The Christianity of the future in Latin America will remain dominant but now plural and competitive. The decline of Catholic monopoly and the surge of Protestant and Pentecostal churches, visible since the 1980s but with deeper roots, are explained in the context of social, cultural and political changes that have drawn churches into public space in new ways. The impact of democracy, violence, and a newly open civil society on churches and religious life is visible in new ideas about rights and associational life and in the withdrawal of the institutional churches from political confrontation, diversification of political positions and multiplication of voices in all churches. Keywords: Protestantism, Pentecostals, Neo Pentecostals, civil society, politics, violence, democracy, rights Introduction Writing about the future of Christianity in Latin America reminds me of a comment by Peruvian theologian Gustavo Guti?rrez who some time ago wrote : At present we are in the position of those trying to decide whom a newborn child resembles.

Better to photograph the child and decide later on whom it resembles.1 A photograph I took almost 40 years ago may be a good place to start. The photograph records my first encounter with an evangelical street preacher in Latin America, which came in 1968, in the Guatemalan market town of Solal? (see Figure 1). The market was in full swing, and in the midst of people buying, selling and bargaining, a Protestant preacher was working the crowd. The majority of Guatemalans are Indians, the audience was entirely com prised of Indian men and women, and the speaker, I remember, was preaching the Gospel in Kakchiquel, the language of the region. Holding a Bible in his hands, he illustrated his sermon by pointing to a hand-painted canvas that depicted heaven, hell, the judgment of the nations, the temp tations of this world, and the ways of the righteous and of the sinner. I found the scene stirring enough to save the slide for more than three decades, but at the time it seemed litde more than an interesting sideshow. The religious experience was new, as was the leadership: ordinary, often non-white, and barely lettered men using a popular language, who recall the circuit-riding 1 Gustavo Guti?rrez, We Drink from Our Own Wells: The Spiritualfourney of a People (Maryknoll NY, 1984), p. 92.</page><page sequence="3">The Future of Christianity in Latin America 123 preachers of nineteenth-century North America. The signs were there, but they slipped by most observers. None of it fitted into the accepted scheme of things at the time. From the vantage point of 2008, it is easy to see this preacher as a pre cursor of the wave of Protestant, especially Pentecostal Protestant religion that swept Guatemala and all of Central America in subsequent years.2 He and others like him have since then gone on to transform the religious landscape and the public presence of religion throughout Latin America. The five-hundred-year monopoly of Catholicism has been replaced by religious pluralism. Particularly in the big cities (and Latin America is a heavily urban continent), the religious scene is a blooming confusion of churches, chapels, street preachers, and television and radio evangelists competing for attention and vying for members and a share of public goods and public space. Catholicism Past and Present Latin American Catholicism entered the twentieth century monopolising the religious field, but to borrow the language of economics, the church was a lazy monopolist, its power and position guaranteed by law, custom and elite links. Lazy monopolists have little incentive to keep day to day operations vital, and as a result the church was left vulnerable to new challenges and competitors - including innovative religious expression - that began to ap pear with growing force as the twentieth century passed its midpoint. The world of Catholic monopoly seems a distant memory today. The public face of religion and the ways in which religion is present in the public sphere have been utterly transformed. The past was marked in many coun tries by multiple images and symbols of religious-civic fusion such as Te Deums with the presence of political and ecclesiastical 'authorities' at the highest level, or the repeated joint presence of politicians, clergy and military officers at the inauguration of public works, the opening of stores or fac tories, and a wide range of events. This omnipresent triad offered a public affirmation of the identification of ' the church ' (only one was recognised) with political and economic power and social hierarchy. The public face of religion now is quite another matter: street preachers abound, men (mosdy men) working public spaces with a Bible, a loudspeaker and something to stand on. New churches proliferate, and new voices jostie for space and attention. Where there was monopoly now there is pluralism, where a limited number of spaces were once officially reserved for religious practice (with a 2 On these changes see in particular, Virginia Garrard-Burnett, Protestantism in Guatemala: Living in the New Jerusalem (Austin, 1998); and David Stoll, Between Two Armies: In the Ixil Towns oj Guatemala (New York, 1993).</page><page sequence="4">124 Daniel H. Levine Hmited number of authorised practitioners), now there is a rich profusion of churches, chapels and mass media programming, not to mention campaigns and crusades that carry the message to hitherto 'profane' spaces like streets and squares to beaches, sports stadiums, jails, bars and nightclubs. This new landscape challenges the traditional role of the Catholic Church as the church - officially acknowledged wielder of moral and social authority within the boundaries of a defined national territory. In Casanova's terms, the church is no longer church ? a religious institution with an official or semiofficial monopoly in a given territory - but rather one actor among many in an open civil society.3 But making this change work is no easy task, and learning to live in a world that no longer can be defined by one church in mutual alliance with one state can be unsettling. Institutions long accus tomed to public support may find competition and cultural openness pro vides less opportunities for growth than signs of decay, cultural peril and disintegration. One way to appreciate the extent of change is to consider how the state of religion, society and politics looked to the region's Catholic bishops when they met in 2007 at Aparecida, Brazil, for their Fifth General Conference.4 This was the latest in a Une of conferences of the region's Catholic bishops that have set an agenda for Latin American Catholicism, and provided a new moral vocabulary with which activists and believers can understand the world.5 Earlier conferences at Medellin (1968) and Puebla (1979) gave many activists and social movements a sense of legitimacy and put important concepts into the shared understandings of the region. From Medellin came the idea that sin can refer to more than individual moral failings ? whole social structures can be sinful if they are built on and continue injustice ? and the concept of 'institutionalised violence', that unjust societies can condemn many to needless early death through poverty and disease, and that this is sinful. Puebla made famous the commitment to a 'preferential option for the poor ', meaning that given a choice, church resources and people should side with the poor and accompany them in their struggles.6 Aparecida can also be understood as an effort by Pope Benedict XVI to continue the policies of his 3 Jose Casanova, Public Religions in the Modern World (Chicago, 1994) p. 217. 4 I discuss Aparecida in detail in Daniel H Levine, 'The Future as Seen from Aparecida' in R. Pelton (ed.), Aparecida: Quo Vadis (Scranton, 2008). 5 For prominent examples of this point of view see Gustavo Guti?rre2, 'La Opci?n Preferencial por el pobre en Aparecida' Paginas, Lima, no. 206 (August 2007), pp. 6?25 ; and Cecilia Tovar, 'Retomando el Camino de Medellin: La V Conferencia General del Episcopado en Aparecida'. Paginas, Lima, no. 206 (August 2007). pp. 42? 51. 6 Although conservatives have regularly insisted that this 'preferential option' is not 'socially exclusive ' and embraces attention to the poor in spirit, the documents have generally been taken as intended to focus attention on the materially poor, the oppressed, and the ex cluded.</page><page sequence="5">The Future of Christianity in Latin America 12 5 predecessor John Paul II, while placing his own mark on them and becoming acquainted with and open to what is, after all, the major Catholic region of the world. In the run up to Aparecida, the world that Catholic leaders saw around them was like night and day compared to the one in which most had been born and raised. The unquestioned Catholic monopoly was gone, replaced by a plurality of churches and a new presence of religious competition (for members, space, public sanction and goods) throughout the region. Statistical reports (including national census data and a series of surveys and studies) confirmed what they could see every day. The numbers of men and women identifying themselves as 'Catholic' was in steady decline, while those declaring affiliation to Protestant (especially Pentecostal and neo Pentecostal churches) had grown, along with a smaller, but still notable segment that affirmed no connection to any church or religion. Surveys also regularly report a substantial sector that declares itself cat?lico en mi manera, (or as Mallimaci and Villa put it, cuenta propista, on one's own) picking and choosing the kinds of issues on which they adhere, or even listen to 'official teachings '.7 The decay of monopoly and the growth of pluralism in religious ex pression and organisation have been accompanied by processes that have moved religious groups, issues and leaders off centre stage of public debate, contestation, coalition formation and political discussion. This is an inevi table consequence of transformations that have accompanied the d?mocra tisation of civil society and politics of the last two decades. There are many more options and vehicles for expression now than in the past; church leaders can no longer monopolise the public expression of religious com ment, nor can they count on being king makers or critical veto players. The effort is bound to run into multiple figures working the territory. There is simply a lot of competition out there. The convergence of these multiple pluralisms means that simple references to church and state, much less ex clusive attention to the institutional Catholic Church (or to the statements of its official leaders and spokespersons) no longer suffice as a guide to under standing religion, or its place in society and politics in Latin America today. A close look at the organisations and vehicles of mobilisation that the church presumably 'controls' and could use to further its agenda, reveals that the bishops' capacity to manage groups and members is much weaker than they would like or that they often imagine. Many of the 'resources' that prelates commonly list or rely upon turn out, on closer inspection, to be hollow shells, groups that exist more on paper than in reality. Even where 7 Fortunato Mallimaci and Martha Villa, Las Comunidades Eclesiales de base y el mundo de los pobres en la Argentina.

Levine groups are in existence, members prove much less malleable than the evi dence of formal ties and documents might indicate. Catholic bishops have long relied on models of organisation that operate with close clerical super vision and control. But the effort to ensure loyalty by insisting on separate groups with built in clerical supervision runs into the problem of control in a world where citizens have too many skills, connections and possibilities to engage to be treated as sheep by a shepherd, or to be controlled or moved en bloc in traditional ways. In this world, loyalty is more likely to be secured through provision of spaces and engagement, not by demarcation of boundaries.8 If the last half century has witnessed dynamic and far reaching transfor mations in what religion means in Latin America, these changes are all the more startling coming from Latin America itself, a part of the globe where for so long the monopoly of the Catholic Church seemed secure, if never wholly unchallenged. Change arising from within religion (any religion) was in any event a surprise to most social scientists, who remained firmly in the grip of theories of secularisation (and related ideas about of modernisation) according to which the progressive spread of science, education, industrial isation and urban life would cut the ground out from under religion. In this view, religion would simply fade away, disengaging from state institutions, fading from public Ufe and becoming a matter of scattered, and decUning, personal devotions or rituaUsed markers of the passage of Ufe stages. Such theories provided the underpinning for enduring academic fashions that pushed researchers to topics other than reUgion in search of a mean ingful research pay off and an effective career boost. The power of academic fashion and intellectual bUnkers cannot be denied, but there are ?so facts that break through our concepts, inconvenient facts that force themselves on us and make us reconsider the foundations of our approaches. What are the facts that have broken through in Latin America to remind us of the power of reUgion, not just to sustain itself but also to change itself as part of a changing world ? A brief list, in no particular order, makes the point. Expectations of inevitable secularisation have been upstaged by the prime fact of an explosion of multiple churches and reUgious spaces.9 It is not that 8 Catalina Romero, 'Religion and Public Spaces. Catholicism and Civil Society in Peru', in Frances Hagopian (ed.), Contemporary Catholicism, Religious Pluralism, and Democracy in Latin America (Notre Dame IN, 2009) argues that the public space emerging within the church is a space of liberty where believers encounter others (both believers and non believers) in voluntary associations, personal development courses, as well as in the arts, music ex pressive mobilizations the internet and mass media. 9 Fortunato Mallimaci, 'Catolicismo y pol?tica en el gobierno de Kirchner', Am?rica Latina Hoy Revista de Ciencias Sociales, vol. 41 (December 2005), p. 60, 'In today's Argentina, people do not believe - be it in politics or be it in religion - more or less than in other periods, but in a different way '.</page><page sequence="7">The Future of Christianity in Latin America 127 Latin America is 'becoming Protestant', to cite the title of David StoU's important early book; it is, rather, becoming pluraUst for the first time in its 500 year history.10 Although the poUtical orientations and social connections of the churches range across the ideological spectrum and up and down the social hierarchy, a fact that presses itself on our attention is that with rare exceptions aU the churches now support some form of poUtical democracy and open civil society. This is a cultural shift of prime significance, with roots in debates within the churches as weU as in the end of the global Cold War which loosened once immutable reUgio-political alUances. The relation of churches to civil society (both the idea and the reaUty of independent groups) is a third fact. CathoUc and later Protestant churches sponsored and pro tected a range of social movements: land leagues, housing coaUtions, neighbourhood groups, or human rights organisations, to name a few. This entailed serving as a conduit for resources and information, training leaders, bringing church inspired activists together with grass roots groups and pro viding legal defence if needed. With the restoration of democracy and the decUning status of many of these movements, churches continue to shape civil society through less mobiUsational civic networks along with institutions such as schools, new media outlets, cooperatives and health centres. Much as one disUkes stratigraphie metaphors, it is worth noting that these new facts and the eye catching changes in reUgion's public faces are under girded by 'deeper' long term social, cultural and poUtical transformations that provide the raw materials and the dynamic of the process. These fifty years have seen significant migration, mostly rural to urban but also intra rural, accelerated in cases Uke Peru or Central America by extremes of civil war and violence, but present everywhere. Cities have grown and bigger cities have everywhere grown faster than smaUer cities. I have already pointed to the important poUtical fact of d?mocratisation which has brought with it an end to civil wars and widespread poUtical violence. Two related facts are ex panded Uteracy and access to mass media along with drasticaUy reduced barriers to organisation and pubUc participation. Together with the growth of cities, these facts set the scene for competition among churches and between churches and other groups, and provide both means and targets for those seeking to gain or hold members, acquire resources and get a pubUc hearing. The preceding lays out what are, in my view, the bare bones that define the situation of reUgion in Latin America today. These are the devel opments that together broke through the inteUectual bUnders of ideas about secularisation, and forced scholars and observers to come to grips with the 10 David Stoll, Is Latin America Turning Protestant?

Levine new experiences of religious practice, meaning and community being created on the ground in Latin America and with the ways in which these interacted with political and social transformations to create a very different world from the unquestioned monopolies of the past. The most general characteristic of Latin American Catholicism over the long span of its history is a pattern of occasional practice, heavy devotion to saints and shrines, and syncretism manifest in everything from the incor poration of pre conquest calendars or deities into Catholic devotions, the persistence of traditional beliefs about healing, and sporadic bouts of reform. Such reform movements typically strove to control antinomian behaviour (especially alcoholism) associated with the ritual cycle of fiestas and saints' days, to ensure a more Christocentric worship in place of 'excessive' de votion to saints, and to purify 'popular' religion and syncretic practices.11 Over the centuries such campaigns had at best partial and short-lived suc cess. The fact that Catholic practice remained dependent on the availability of ordained clergy, and that ordained clergy were scarce in most countries and very unevenly distributed in the best of cases, reinforced the pattern of occasional practice. Following the fall of China in 1949, waves of Catholic clergy came to the region, spurring a succession of reform movements that opened spaces for lay participation and social and political mobilisation with church support.12 Two noteworthy efforts to break the mould of sporadic and clerically dependent practice are the base ecclesial communities, which go by different names, but are commonly referred to as the comunidades eclesiales de base (CEBS), and the Catholic Charismatic Renewal (CCR).13 Beginning in the 1970s, small group-based practices based on lay leader ship began to appear throughout the region. In theory, such communities recreate aspects of the primitive church ('wherever two or three are gathered in my name'). They share a common pattern of reading the Bible, reflecting 11 Devotion to saints and commemoration of apparitions is of course widespread in Catholicism and in the case of Latin America dates back as far as the Virgin of Guadalupe, who appeared miraculously to Juan Diego on a hill outside of what is now Mexico City on 12 December 15 31, not long after the conquest of Mexico by Cortez. Long venerated as the patron saint of Mexico, this brown-skinned virgin is a perfect incarnation of the absorption of the faith into the life and culture of subordinate peasant masses. 12 Bruce J. Calder, 'Interwoven Histories: The Catholic Church and the Maya, 1940 to the Present' in Edward L. Cleary and Timothy J. Steigenga, (eds.), Resurgent Voices. Indigenous Peoples, Political Mobilisation, and Religious Change in Latin America (New Brunswick NJ, 2004), pp. 93-124. 13 It is important to be clear on the meaning of the title. To call these communities ecclesial (as was the case in Latin America) is to evoke the original sense of ' church ' in Greek, which is ekklesia, or to convoke or call together. It is therefore a profound misunderstanding to refer to such groups as ecclesiastical (evoking images of hierarchical institutions). Although to be sure they arose within the Catholic Church, their basic self understanding is com munity oriented, not juridical. They were never conceived as mini parishes.</page><page sequence="9">The Future of Christianity in Latin America 129 on its meaning, and organising some form of community action out of the soUdarities and shared understandings derived from those readings. An enormous Uterature examines the theory and reaUty of CEBs and their Unks to Uberation theology and this is not the place for a detailed discussion,14 though it suffices here to make a few points. The very concept of the CEB was so vague (community groups centred on the Bible) that there was a tendency to count almost any smaU group as part of the category, resulting in unreUable accounts of their numbers. Further, because the groups were and remained reUgious at root, they often failed to meet the expectations of secular analysts or poUtical figures who saw them above aU as potential alUes. Such expectations rested on the idea that something Uke a congregational model of reUgion was emerging here with smaU groups reading and dis cussing the Bible, and in the process learning valuable civic and social skiUs (social capital). The newly emerging citizen was nurtured here, and in re Ugiously related social movements, and could then put the new skiUs and activist dispositions to work in broader areas.15 The passage of time, and the accumulation of empirical research, has cast doubt on the vaUdity of these expectations. Many of the movements created in recent years failed and many activists found their expectations blocked, both within the church and, ironicaUy, by the restoration of democracy that led activists to turn to more direct poUtical action and church leaders to retreat from open support.16 The explosive growth of Pentecostal and Neo Pentecostal churches, often led by a new generation of reUgious en trepreneurs running notoriously tight and hierarchical ships, has also un dermined the beUef that the growth of Protestantism would necessarily mean the spread of congregational forms of reUgious practice, and its associated impact on the d?mocratisation of culture and reUgion, not to mention 14 William. E. Hewitt, Base Christian Communities and Social Change in Brazil (Lincoln, 1991) ; and Daniel H. Levine, Popular Voices in Latin American Catholicism (Princeton, 1992). 15 The trends applied both to Catholics and later to the newly visible Protestant sector. The perspective is deeply Tocquevillian and inspired David Martin to find echoes of the cultural transformations of the Reformation. See his Tongues of Fire: Protestant Expansion in Latin America (Oxford, 1990). On the parallel to Tocqueville, see Rowan Ireland, 'Popular Religions and the Building of Democracy in Latin America: Saving the Tocquevillian Parallel5', Journal ojInter American Studies and World Affairs, vol. 41, no. 4 (1999), pp. 111-36. 16 As Frederick Harris reminds us, participatory ideals can find it hard to survive within theocratic structures.

Levine poUtics.17 Founder-leaders of new churches - such as Brazil's Edir Macedo of the Universal Church of the Reign of God (Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus, or IURD) - works with and exempUfies conventional currents of authoritarian leadership in the culture, reinforcing them with new and highly effective tools including creative use of the mass media. The powerful dramaturgy of much Neo Pentecostal practice, and the way in which it re inforces the power of priests and cuts down on spaces for congregational practice and experience, reinforce this view. In this vein, Kramer quotes an IURD bishop describing the priest as 'super hero of the people', 'an ex ample of Christian prosperity and dominion [who] wields the universal power of Christian prayer on behalf of the community'.18 The CathoUc Charismatic Renewal (CCR) arose from initiatives in the United States in the late 1960s that were an attempt by CathoUcs to combine Pentecostal-Uke practices of baptism in the Holy Spirit with core CathoUc devotions to the Virgin Mary and the saints. The movement spread rapidly through college campuses, received cautious approval from the US CathoUc Bishops (who insisted on supervision by priests and bishops) and began an outreach to Latin America in the 1970s. As the Vatican and local episcopal conferences began to be alarmed by the spread of Pentecostal Protestantism ('the invasion of the sects') initial caution among the hierarchy turned to support and sponsorship that was more open, if stiU tempered with concerns about the need to maintain hierarchical control and clerical supervision. The CCR has grown very rapidly, displaying an astute use of mass media that rivals its Pentecostal competitors. The net result has to been to bring com mon Pentecostal practices Uke speaking in tongues or glossolalia, exorcisms and beUef in divine heaUng into a prominent place in CathoUc experience. AU emphasise the experience of direct contact with the Holy Spirit.19 17 Jean Pierre Bastian, La Muta??n Religiosa de Am?rica Latina. Para una sociolog?a de cambio social en la modernidad perif?rica (Mexico City, 1997) goes further and argues that, far from laying the bases of a new Reformation with democratising cultural and political elements, the ex pansion of Pentecostal Christianity in Latin America has reinforced existing cultural and political strains of authoritarianism. 18 In 'Spectacle and the Staging of Power in Brazilian Neo-Pentecostalism', Latin American Perspectives, vol. 32, no. 1 (January 2005), pp. 95?120. Eric Kramer describes these leaders and the dramatic staging and spectacle that surrounds them, in terms that recall recalls Paul Gifford's account of prophetic and charismatic leaders in Ghana. See Paul Gifford, Ghana's New Christianity: Pentecostalism in a Globalising African Economy (Bloomington IN, 2004). 19 In Chesnut's terms, the CCR is virgophilic, while Protestant Pentecostas are generally virgo phobic and pneumacentric. See R. Andrew Chesnut, Competitive Spirits Latin America's New Religious Economy (New York, 2003). Note that more than imitation is at issue here. Steigenga documents a broad pattern of'Pentecostalisation' of religious belief and practice with elements like the direct experience of charismatic power, a judgmental image of God, pre millenarian beliefs, and speaking in tongues diffused throughout in the Christian community without regard to denominational boundaries. See Timothy Steigenga, The</page><page sequence="11">The Future of Christianity in Latin America 131 Alternatives to Catholicism ReUgious alternatives to CathoUcism have been present from the beginning in Latin America, but they were often suppressed, hidden or incorporated with syncretic CathoUc practices. As pluraUsm and d?mocratisation have lowered the barriers to the expression of reUgious alternatives, a number have acquired an important presence throughout the region. Apart from the growth of Protestantism (in particular Pentecostal Protestantism), reUgious alternatives with noteworthy visibiUty in the twentieth century (and which arouse intense concern in the CathoUc hierarchy) include Afro BraziUan and Afro Caribbean devotions (Macumba, Umbanda, Candombl? and Santer?a), and a loosely defined category of New ReUgious Movements that encompasses groups ranging from Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses or new revelations Uke the IsraeUtes of the New Pact in Peru, to cults Uke the Children of God, or supposed revivals of indigenous reUgions which carry claims to poUtical autonomy. Semi orthodox regional devotions such as the Santa Muerte in Mexico, the Difunta Correa in Argentina, pilgrimages to the shrine for Padre Cicero in Northeast Brazil, or to Jos? Gregorio Hernandez in Venezuela, are a continuous presence in the history of CathoUcism. They become of con cern to the CathoUc hierarchy when, as in the case of the Santa Muerte, they grow in numbers and chaUenge the church's authority, but in total they are not a significant threat.20 The central chaUenge to CathoUcism, and the chief source of concern for its leaders, comes from the growth of Protestantism, the emergence, in re cent decades, of a sector self-described as 'CathoUc in my own way' {cat?lico a mi manera) and of those declaring no reUgion at aU.21 In the last century, the Protestant community in Latin America has grown from a numericaUy insignificant collection of smaU churches mostly attached to immigrant Politics of the Spirit: The Political Implications of Pentecostali%ed Religion in Costa Rica and Guatemala.

Religious Change in Latin America-, on Padre Cicero, see, Ralph Delia Cava, Miracle at Joaseiro (New York, 1970). There is also a small Jewish community scattered across the region (with significant, if shrinking numbers, only in Argentina) and small numbers of Muslims and Hindus, mostly attached to immigrant communities. There have been no significant millenarian movements in Latin America since the nineteenth century; the Canudos in Brazil or the Caste War in the Yucat?n. 21 Cristian Parker, '?Am?rica ya no es cat?lica?

Some of these efforts began much earlier than is commonly reaUsed. The Pentecostal movement, which began foUowing the Asuza Street revival in Los Angeles in 1906, was brought to Latin America not long after, with Swedish missionaries of the AssembUes of God arriving in the city of Bel?m in northern Brazil in 1910.24 Since that time, Pentecostal Christianity has experienced its own waves of change. In Brazil for example, each wave came with a distinctive style: the first wave (1910-1950), arriving with early Swedish missionaries of the AssembUes of God, stressed speaking in tongues; the second wave (1950-1970) empha sised gifts of divine heaUng; and the third wave, including the hugely influ ential Church of the Universal Reign of God (IURD) which has moved massively and with great success into the use of television, 'priv?eges the 22 Statistics on church growth are controversial but there is general agreement on the overall pattern of Catholic decline from overwhelming domination to around 80% across Latin America as a whole.

The very dynamism of the field undermines the validity of snap shot accounts. Whatever the trend lines, Edward Cleary urges caution in making future projections. There is too much inconsistency between sources, a lot of double counting, and misinterpretation of statistics. See Edward L Cleary, 'Shopping Around: Questions about Latin American Conversions', International Bulletin of Missionary Research, vol. 28, no. 2 (2004), pp. 50?4. 23 Protestant churches and missionaries were invited by nineteenth century anticlerical gov ernments, as part of their dual campaign against the local power of the Catholic Church and their desire to 'civilise' their own country by making it more appealing to Northern European (white and Protestant) immigrants.

The end of the global Cold War turned the evangeUsing energies of many North American churches to building organisations and winning souls in the former sociaUst bloc. Resources were directed away from Latin America, making it easier for local leaders and local foundations, already emergent, to consoUdate their positions.27 The pluraUsation of reUgious of ferings is part of the emergence of a pubUc space that is more open, diverse and easy to access than ever before. It is now common in major cities to see old cinemas or markets converted into Pentecostal churches wh?e at the same time the churches themselves construct massive, new purpose-bu?t places of worship. One notable case of a successful new church is the IURD, founded in Rio de Janeiro in 1977 by Edir Macedo. The Universal is generaUy viewed as Neo Pentecostal and syncretic, combining elements of local reUgious practice (such as Umbanda) with classic Pentecostal beUefs and practices, with heavy emphasis on health and heaUng, exorcism of demons, and a promise of prosperity through faith. In Uttle more than 30 years, the IURD has experi enced meteoric growth, controls major media resources, and has now begun to send missionaries to other countries.28 The IURD and other Pentecostal churches in Braz?29 have in common an astute use of the media, including 25 Eric Kramer, 'Spectacle', p. 97. The dramatic staging characteristic of some Neo Pentecostal churches is a significant part of their public impact, which is magnified by astute use of the media and regular public rituals of exorcism (in Portuguese, descarrego means literally discharging or unlocking, that is, releasing a person from a spiritual affliction caused by possession). All of these elements greatly enhance the power of the pastor who is the medium for channeling, through the congregation, the divine power that makes release possible (Kramer, 2005). 26 Dar?o L?pez, La Seducci?n del Poder, documents a transition in leadership among the evan gelical churches in Peru from foreign missionaries to Peruvian natives starting in the 1970s. 27 Chesnut, Born Again and Competitive Spirits; Tom?s Guti?rrez S?nchez, Evang?licos, Democracia y Nueva Sociedad.

Levine radio and particularly television, to promote crusades and evangeUsation campaigns ; incorporation of local music, intense use of exorcism (referred to in the IURD as liberta?ao or Uberation) as a central element in ritual practice; emphasis on divine cure. For its part, the IURD expUcitly rejects the separation of the community of the pure, asceticism and Umits in favour of achievement and integration into the rhythms of ordinary urban Ufe.30 Why Protestantism, and in particular this specific form of Protestantism? There are many competing explanations.31 EarUer changes in CathoUcism (including innovations with Protestant features Uke the emphasis on smaU, bible focused participatory groups in the CEBs) in a sense opened the way to Protestantism, but Protestant growth is a much more massive and general phenomenon. The continuing appeal of divine heaUng and the possibiUty of a change in the way Ufe is Uved is immensely attractive to people with urgent physical and emotional needs, suffering from what Chesnut calls the patho gens of poverty, namely, alcohoUsm, violence (including domestic violence), gastrointestinal disease and status marginaUty.32 There is the further appeal of Uteracy and new forms of community to populations UteraUy on the move, above aU recent migrants to the periphery of major cities aU across the continent. New faiths and the community they bring offer a way of opting out of the extremes of violence associated with internal war (as in Central America or Peru), state repression, or simply with the precarious conditions of the Ufe that poor people lead in urban slums and squatter settlements, including gang warfare, the constant threat of assault, and drugs. Whatever the case, the common thread to note is that conversion to the new churches is a bridge to a different Ufe, a kind of forward-looking contract between the convert and the church (and its leaders). Pare de Sufrir, Stop Suffering, as the signs visible everywhere say, is a powerful call to people who are in fact suffering the effects of poverty, dislocation and violence.33 30 Chesnut, Born Again, p. 46 quotes Edir Macedo, who contrasts his church with traditional Pentecostals: 'We have few relations because other Pentecostals are too fanatical mixing faith with customs. One thing has nothing to do with the other. Traditional Pentecostals for example, base themselves on doctrine rooted in the time of Jesus. We, on the contrary, do not prohibit anything. In the IURD it is prohibited to prohibit. People are free to do what they understand to be right. Our obligation is to teach them that they, on their own accord, have to make the decision whether or not to do this or that' (quoting a document entitled ' O dinheiro ? um bem' or 'money is a good thing'). 31 I exclude arguments that rely on suppositions of anomie, 'loss of culture', or dislocation. On this point, see Steigenga, The Politics of the Spirit chapters 1 and 2. 32 Chesnut, Born Again. 33 This is similar to the general thesis advanced by Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris. Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics World Wide (Cambridge, 2004) that religious belief is tied to levels of existential security, but makes the argument in much more fine-grained terms.</page><page sequence="15">The Future of Christianity in Latin America 13 5 Violence, Democracy, Civil Society In an influential book pubUshed almost 40 years ago, Ivan Valuer argued that for CathoUcism to retain influence and a capacity to shape Latin American culture, society and poUtics in the future, the institutional church had to withdraw from poUtics. Breaking the mutual dependence with power and privilege would free the church to provide the kind of cultural and ideo logical consensus that in his view were a prerequisite to modernisation.34 ValUer's work played a major role in bringing social science perspective to the study of CathoUcism in Latin America which had been dominated by legal historians. His work was both empirical and normative : he beUeved that the path he outUned was measurable and already in progress, and he also argued strongly that it was a good thing, an essential element in the process of development and modernisation. Setting aside the evident functionaUst predilections of this kind of analysis (the dubious notion that social order and 'modernisation' require cultural consensus), ValUer's also ran up against a more practical difficulty. In the very moment that he called for withdrawal from poUtics in the pursuit of unified cultural leadership, new tendencies emerged in CathoUcism anchored in liberation theology and alliances with the Left. PoUtical engagement was demanded but now it was not with estab Ushed power or existing institutions, but rather in opposition to dictatorship, in pursuit of social justice, and a new kind of poUtics. The influence of Uberation theology was felt in various ways in subsequent decades: in the authorship of Church documents critical of injustice, in the establishment, staffing and legitimation of important Church institutions directed to issues Uke land, housing, or human rights; and in general in the articulation and justification of a position that brought churches and their leaders and acti vists into direct, often violent conflict with increasingly fearful and repressive miUtary regimes, promoting social justice and democracy, not only in docu ments and speeches but also through the provision of material and organi sational support. As this position evolved, elements in the churches along with related groups and activists moved to the centre of the very poUtical conflicts that Valuer hoped to supersede. Conflict, not consensus, dominated the relation between reUgion and poUtics in the decades after ValUer wrote. This posture carried high costs : surely there must be an easier way to retain influence.35 34 Ivan Vallier, Catholicism, Social Control, and Modernisation in Latin America (Englewood Cliffs NJ, 1970). 35 There are, to be sure, exceptions. One notable instance was Argentina, where the Catholic hierarchy collaborated with and legitimated the military's 'dirty war' against subversion through the 1970s. See, among others, Fortunato Mallimaci, 'Catolicismo y pol?tica en el gobierno de Kirchner', Am?rica Latina Hoy Revista de Ciencias Sociales, vol. 41 (December 2005), pp. 57-76; Fortunato Mallimaci, Humberto Cucchetti and Luis Donatello, 'Caminos</page><page sequence="16">136 Daniel H. Levine Such a stance reveals less a search for influence, as conventionally defined, than a new sense of mission (centred on ideas about social justice) and a new openness to initiative and leadership by lay persons. The concept of influ ence articulated by Vallier and those who followed his lead turned out to be too undifferentiated: influence for what?36 One could argue that the preceding is too much about politics, and not enough about the ' core ' of religion, which has to do with worship, ritual practices, and the development and spread of the message in enduring or ganisations. But the truth is that from the beginning Catholicism has been so entangled with institutions and symbols of power in Latin America that the line between religion and politics is easily blurred and in any case, difficult to specify or maintain with clarity. The issue is not so much separation or distinction of religion from politics as it is to identify evolving and changing syntheses and how different forms of synthesis affect both politics and re ligion considered separately. Newly confident and growing Protestant and Pentecostal churches have in most cases followed the paths laid down long ago by their Catholic predecessors : making deals with government and ex changing political support for material help and legitimation. They have even attempted, with only limited success, to found explicidy Protestant political parties, a strategy abandoned by the Catholic Church with the decline of Christian Democratic parties.37 Three aspects of this process have had particular significance in shaping the pattern of change within religion and in this way affecting the content and potential direction of the future of Christianity in the region. These are the character of violence, the restoration of democracy, and the emergence of civil society. Violence The last 40 years have been a time of much violence in Latin America. The specific character of this violence (repressive, revolutionary, associated with Sinuousos. Nacionalismo y Catolicismo en la Argentina Contempor?nea', in Francisco Colom and Angel Rivero (eds.), El Altar y El Trono.

To begin with Catholicism, the move of the Church and many key institutions from pillar of the established order to public critic, defender of democracy, and provider of legitimation and resources to social movements and contestational groups of all kinds turned the Church itself into a target of violence. Bishops, priests, nuns and lay activists were abducted, jailed, tortured, killed, 'disappeared' and exiled in substantial numbers everywhere, but with particular signifi cance in Central America and the countries of the Southern Cone (Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay). This experience combined with the diffusion of concepts derived from liberation theology, reinforced an identification of the Church with the victims of violence, and underscored the ' option for the poor' enshrined in the documents of the region's Catholic bishops at their 1979 meeting in Puebla, Mexico.38 These converging influences opened the Church to new ideas about rights and helped turn it (and its institutions) into major defenders and promoters of human rights. In cases like Brazil, Chile, Peru and El Salvador, the Catholic Church, with support from others and access to important trans national networks, put resources behind the promotion of human rights and defence of the victims of repression, helping families, providing legal de fence, locating the bodies of the 'disappeared'. The defence of classic human rights (freedom from torture or arbitrary arrest) was accompanied by pro motion of organising efforts (for example of rural workers) and of the right to participation by those without resources. With the setdement of civil wars across the region and the restoration of open democratic politics, the prominence of commitment to rights and open support of organisations working in this area has come into question. With not-so-subde nudging from the Vatican, the Catholic hierarchy in key cases has moved away from confrontational stances, preferring to concentrate resources on more con ventional moral issues and on responding effectively to Protestant compe tition. The decision in 1992 to close Chile's famous Vicariate of Solidarity, which had been a central source of support and leadership in this area, marked an important milestone. The commitment to rights as an element of religious discourse and action has been studied for the most part in the context of Catholicism, but there are comparable developments within Protestantism, as specific churches and grassroots groups joined in ecumenical efforts (in grassroots communities and national organisations) to defend rights in the context of extreme 38 Penny Lernoux, Cry of the People (New Cork, 1982); Daniel H. Levine, 'Pluralidad, Pluralismo y la creaci?n de un vocabulario de derechos', America Latina Hoy Revista de Ciencias Sociales, vol. 41 (December 2005), pp. 17?34; Anna Peterson, Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion: Progressive Catholicism in El Salvador's Civil War (Albany, 1997).</page><page sequence="18">13 8 Daniel H. Levine violence. The experience of Peru is a case in point. In Peru, rapid growth and diversification of Protestant and Pentecostal churches through the 1980s and 1990s was accompanied by massive violence, in which Protestant and CathoUc activists aUke found themselves caught between the violence of the Shining Path guerrillas and the repressive actions of the state and miUtary. As the count of victims rose, the National Council of EvangeUcals {Concilio Nacional de Evang?licos del Per?, or CONEP) created structures and took pubUc positions in support of human rights, as local churches and activists col laborated with CathoUc groups in grassroots efforts. Echoing the moves by the CathoUc Church noted above, in the Peruvian case the ebbing of the threat of violence and the settlement of civil war spurred pressures within the Pentecostal churches to restore emphasis on evangeUsation (spreading of the Word) as the primary task of the churches.39 Not aU the region's CathoUc churches shared this commitment. Argentina is the most weU known and best documented case of continuing alUance of the church with miUtary rule, an alliance which reached the point of com plicity in human rights abuses.40 But Argentina's experience cannot be read exclusively in these terms. In the 1970s, there were important movements that shared the ideas of Uberation theology, promoted social mobiUsation, and alUed with radical elements in Peronism to form the basis of the Montonero revolutionary organisation. They were defeated. The subsequent defeat and discredit of the Argentine miUtary, and the election of a Peronist government opposed to long standing accommodations with the church (the government of Nestor Kirchner) has opened the country to a genuine pluraUsm, which is stiU resisted by the CathoUc hierarchy.41 The impact of violence on the Ufe of reUgion in Latin America is not Umited to issues of rights. The very intensity of the violence made miUen arian ideas about the end of times seem very proximate to many caught in the middle of the struggle.42 Extremes of violence and internal warfare, par ticularly in Central America, Peru and Colombia, have accelerated internal migration creating waves of refugees, as individuals, families, and sometimes whole communities, fled to the relatively safety of cities. The settlements at the urban periphery where most internal migrants end up have been prime recruiting grounds for the new churches. Other kinds of violence ? no longer poUtical but now driven by gangs, drugs and crime ? of course remain a central fact of the urban Ufe of the poor. Opting out of this violence by 39 L?pez, Los Evang?licos y los Derechos Humanos. 40 Verbitsky, Doble fuego and also El Silencio, Mignone Witness to the Truth. 41 Mallimaci, 'Catolicismo y pol?tica en el gobierno de Kirchner'. 42 Garrard-Burnett, Protestantism in Guatemala; Peterson, Martyrdom; Steigenga, Politics of the Spirit.</page><page sequence="19">The Future of Christianity in Latin America 13 9 opting into a new community of the saved has been understandably at tractive to many.43 Democracy The restoration, or - for the Dominican RepubUc and Paraguay ? the creation of democracy was accompUshed almost everywhere in Latin America in a ten-year period that began in the mid-1980s. MiUtaries withdrew from office (if not from power), civil wars were concluded, poUtical parties reestabUshed, and open poUtics reinstituted. The impact of these transformations on re Ugion is not easy to reduce to a few points, but several issues warrant special mention. Although it took a long time, it is now fair to say that both CathoUc and Protestant churches are committed to the legitimacy of democracy in theory and practice. This is a major cultural change, and has been ac companied by an uncoupUng of specific churches from predetermined pol itical alUances and position. The CathoUc Church is no longer a reUable supporter of conservative poUtics : the bishops defend democracy in general terms44 and with a spur from the Vatican have substantiaUy reduced the institution's role as poUtical protagonist and sponsor and defender of civ? society.45 Protestant and Pentecostal churches are no longer bound to the obsessive anti-leftism of the past. The end of the global Cold War freed them in this regard, while the sheer pace of their expansion has pulled a broad range of people with already formed careers, skiUs, and orientations into the churches. The result has been a much more diverse poUtical presence. ExpUcitly reUgious ties to poUtical parties ? be they CathoUc for Christian Democrats or specificaUy Protestant parties or candidacies - have weakened substantially. Some Pentecostal churches have tried for direct poUtical rep resentation (through specificaUy Protestant parties or alUances), with mixed results. In Peru, early alUances with Alberto Fujimori proved chastening and collapsed with his regime. In Brazil, the AssembUes of God have been sup planted as the key Pentecostal poUtical force by the rapid growth of the IURD, which deUberately places candidates in parties across the ideological spectrum.46 The very idea of a confessional state, which resonates strongly in some fundamentaUst circles around the world finds Uttle echo here.47 There See Chesnut, Competitive Spirits; Smilde, Reason to Believe. 44 Daniel H.

Levine have also been cuts in church sponsorship of social movements and a return to more traditional lobbying on a core group of conventional issues sur rounding subsidies, education, sexuality and reproductive issues and public morality, and thus away from the social justice issues that dominated public debates in the 1980s and 1990s.48 Civil Society The fact of a more open, plural, accessible and less regulated civil society affects the character of religious change by lowering barriers of entry to the newly competitive market and providing incentives for the construction of rules of coexistence among the churches. Interchurch competition remains intense and highly visible everywhere in Latin America, but the sheer physical diffusion of evangelicals and their institutions throughout the society has also dampened the edge of alienation and difference between Catholics and Protestants, particularly in large urban areas where most Latin Americans live. Most of the empirical work of which I am aware affirms that evangelicals (the preferred umbrella term for Protestants in Latin America) are much like their Catholic neighbours in everything but churchgoing: they participate in organisations in similar ways, they live in the same neigh bourhoods, and they consume in comparable patterns. These are concrete changes that lay a basis for cooperation in meeting the ordinary needs of community life. In a public sphere open to all, it is in the interests of all to keep it open.49 In the long run, this can reinforce the commitment of any group to maintaining an open political life. The erosion of monopoly is not limited to statistics of membership or church attendance. The Catholic Church no longer monopolises the moral sphere in the name of religion : its leaders and official voices must share the airwaves, TV screens, public platforms, and arenas of power with re presentatives of these other churches. The creation of a plural and open civil society also affects the internal life of churches, bringing ideas about par ticipation and equality into the daily life of the institution where it often runs into resistance. Even within the admittedly broad net that the Catholic Church casts, there is growing diversity of opinion visible in publications, schools, and group positions, leading Catalina Romero to speak of the de velopment of public space and civil society within the church. 'Through these different forms of association and the construction of new spaces for en counter and interaction', she writes, 'the church has renovated itself and infused religious meaning in everyday life problems. In the last decade, this 48 Drogus and Stewart-Gambino, Activist Faith; Ottmann, Lost for Words. 49 Casanova, Public Religions, p. 217.</page><page sequence="21">The Future of Christianity in Latin America 141 space has begun to close once again due to the intervention of a number of bishops who are trying to take back control of pubUc space in the church itself and in the way the church expresses itself and is represented in civil society, poUtical society, and the state'.50 What Romero identifies for Peru is general in the region: groups proUferate while many prelates, fearing division and loss of control, have tried to rein them in by cutting funds to dissident groups and striving for greater control over schools, universities and pub Ucations. Much of CathoUc tradition is indeed built around hierarchy, and a top down concept of authority, with power and knowledge descending across a large number of levels in complex social settings. But this is not the only CathoUc model available on which to build. Romero states it forcefuUy: 'Understanding persons as friends of God is quite different than looking upon them as serfs, in the same way that inviting them to follow God's project is different than ordering them to foUow the law'.51 The seemingly sudden shift to openness and open competition seems to preoccupy the bishops, but it is also a source of potential energy and commitment in as yet unknown forms. In Latin America today, reUgion is a buzzing, blooming confusion of possibi?ties, fuU of innovation and charged with social and cultural energies. The Future of the Future Christianity will remain dominant but the Christianity in question wiU clearly be very different from the past. Latin America is indeed 'turning pluraUst' but expectations of a thoroughgoing transformation of Latin American cul ture, society and poUtics arising from reUgious change ? something Uke a new Reformation with comparable consequences in economic and poUtical Ufe - are to say the least, premature.52 In the agenda and routines of most of the new churches, poUtical and economic issues are secondary to those of conversion, salvation and personal transformation. As these work out in practice, there may be clear spin-offs in changing patterns of family Ufe and economics (if only by the constraints imposed on what anthropologists refer to as the 'male prestige' syndrome of serial monogamy, irresponsible parenthood, drunkenness, promiscuity and sporadic violence) but these are not the specific goal. These are spirit-fiUed and nascent forms of reUgion, more focused in the short term on intensity and directness of experience 50 Romero, 'Public spaces', p. 22 (manuscript). 51 Ibid., p. 41 (manuscript). 52 For such expectations, see among others Martin, Tongues, or Amy Sherman, The Soul of Development: Biblical Christianity and Economic Transformation in Guatemala (New York, 1997).</page><page sequence="22">142 Daniel H. Levine than on the structure of the movement itself. Their very intensity is what provides the driving edge of growth.53 Robert Orsi has underscored how difficult it is for scholars of religion to enter into the logic and appeal of spirit-filled religious movements. By disciplinary training and tradition, they are committed to an ameliorative and benign view of religion, and attracted to themes like empowerment, trans cendence, movement building and civil society. Orsi suggests replacing these with a more complex and less optimistic portrait in which the engagements that religions frame with the world may proceed in ways that are not so easily channeled into beneficial effects.54 As the academic study of religion evolved in the United States, he writes, it was inconceivable that religion would be anything but good religion in this social and intellectual setting, good meaning acceptable in belief and practice to this domesticated modern civic Protestantism. Proponents of the academic study of religion claimed a place in university culture by asserting that the study of 'religion' - meaning the denominationally neutral version of Christianity recast as an ethical sys tem ? was good and even necessary for American democracy. Outside the walls of the academy, the winds of religious madness howled (in the view of those inside) - fire baptised people, ghost dancers, frenzied preachers and gullible masses, Mormons and Roman Catholics. Religion, as it took shape in the academy, was explicidy imagined in relation to these others and as a prophylactic against them.55 Orsi's comment reminds me of an experience of my own with academic blinkers. A few years ago, I attended a conference on religion, culture and politics in which respectful attention was paid to mock ups of Candombl? shrines and to videos of Afro Cuban dance and its relation to the traditions of Afro Cuban Santer?a. But a film that recorded exorcisms at a huge meeting of an IURD congregation in Brazil, with the raw emotional power of thou sands urging on the pastor with shouts of Sai (Begone !) or Fora o Demonio (Out with the Devil!) elicited little more than nervous titters. Manifestations of the power of the spirit make academics nervous : they are like the ghost in the machine. If we are to grasp the power of the spirit-filled religions growing now in Latin America, and their tamer versions in the Catholic Charismatic movement, we must get past the difficulties that such experience presents to rationalist academics, and grasp the reasons for their appeal. It is striking how much of the change discussed in this article was un anticipated. Scholars missed it, some because of commitments to theories of 53 Warner refers to such churches as nascent and spirit filled, more movements than institu tions. R.

ReUgions are present in the pubUc spaces of Latin America now in very different ways from the past. There is a notable popularisation of language and a diffusion of arenas for reUgious experience that paraUels the 'storming heaven by the back door', that Nathan Hatch points to in his work The Democratization of American Christianity?1 This is evident not only in classic evangeUcal 'campaigns and crusades ' but also in the effective use of mass media, radio and television, and the adaptation of popular music, visible in the appeal of Christian rock and evangeUcal salsa. The process is visible everywhere with a clear incor poration of contemporary language and musical themes and the prominent role played by individuals with media careers in the new churches in Brazil. Although it is always risky to extrapolate from current trends into the future, some elements of continued transformation seem weU estabUshed. There wiU be continued intense competition among churches and denomi nations in an ever-broadening range of arenas and media, continued diffusion of intense, spirit-fiUed forms of reUgious practice, growing inde pendence of Latin American Protestant churches from northern sponsors, and growing projection out of Latin America by these same churches as they carry their message elsewhere in the global South, and also to the North. There wiU be no successful reconstruction of CathoUc monopoly, and no major new confessional poUtical parties of any affiliation. The 56 For too many academics, Orsi writes, 'True religion, then, is epistemologically and ethically singular. It is rational, respectful of persons, non coercive, mature, non anthropomorphic in its higher forms, mystical (as opposed to ritualistic), unmediated, and agreeable to democracy (no hierarchy in gilded robes and fancy hats), monotheistic (no angels, saints, demons, ancestors), emotionally controlled, a reality of mind and spirit, not body and nature. It is concerned with ideal essences not actual things, and especially not about presences in things. Students of mine over the past twenty years in classrooms in New York City, Indiana and Massachusetts have unfailing refused to acknowledge as 'religious' the practice of putting holy water into an automobile's transmission (as pilgrims to a Bronx Lourdes shrine commonly do). Whatever this is, it is not 'good religion'? All the complex dynamism of religion is thus stripped away, its boundary-blurring and border-crossing propensities eliminated. Not surprisingly, there is only one methodology and one epis temology for studying this 'religion'-critical, analytical, and 'objective' (as opposed to subjective, existentially engaged, or participatory), Between Heaven and Earth, p. 188. 57 Nathan O.

Levine association of intense reUgious change with a return to democracy and civic opening that has foUowed periods of widespread violence and repression suggests a puUback from confrontational poUtics and a renewed pubUc stress on conventional moral issues including education, censorship, family, sexu aUty and reproduction, along with competition for state subsidies and privi leges which are both markers of legitimacy and indispensable tools for growth.58 Does the pattern of reUgious change outUned here contribute in some measurable way to 'modernisation' or 'development,' however these no toriously unclear terms may be defined? The question has no clear or un equivocal answer. The expectation that reUgious change in Latin America would provide the cultural foundations for democracy, entrepreneurship, or related phenomena on the Unes of the Protestant Reformation are at best exaggerated, at worst a misleading and mechanical appUcation of models derived from one historical experience to other, quite different contexts. This is not to say that Latin American societies, or their varied reUgious experi ence, are therefore properly classified as traditional or non modern, much less non-western. Latin America has been part of the Western world from the very beginning, but of course it is the Iberian version of that world that set the tone and estabUshed the dominant institutional patterns. Latin America is nothing if not varied, and concepts Uke tradition or traditional are clearly inadequate for a continent that displays such accelerated urbanisation, rela tively high Uteracy, education, and media penetration, and which includes the eighth largest economy in the world (Brazil). The question is better phrased as one that addresses the specific ways in which reUgious change participates in ? drawing strength, accelerating, and in some instances providing shelter from ? the overaU pattern of economic, demographic, social and poUtical transformations commonly conflated un der the heading of 'modernisation and development'.
