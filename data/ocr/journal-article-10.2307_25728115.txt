<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews 135 REVIEW ARTICLE The Qur'an: Formative Interpretation. Ed. Andrew Rippin. Pp. 385. The Formation of the Classical Islamic World Series. Aldershot, Brookfield, USA, Singapore, Sydney: Ashgate Variorum, 1999. ?75.00. The Formation of the Classical Islamic World is an extensive reference series which will ultimately comprise 47 volumes aimed at furnishing an authoritative introduction to the state of current knowledge relating to the religious, social, political and historical institutions of the Islamic world. The series' editor, Lawrence Conrad, uses the preface to this edition to argue that although 'the broad diversification' and 'compartmentalisation' of research into the Islamic and Arabic sciences have provided profoundly theoretical and sophisticated approaches to the analysis of the various sciences and disciplines of the Islamic tradition, these approaches have 'tended to isolate scholarship in one subject from research in other areas'. This series will therefore seek to address this matter by making 'available a critical selection of the published research that has served to stimulate and define the way modern scholarship has come to understand the formative period of Islamic History'. The chronological confines set by the series are the years 600-950 AD: each volume includes a selection of articles published over the period of the last century; indeed, even articles originally published in languages other than English were translated for the purpose of this series. Crucial to every volume is an introduction written by its editor along with an extensive bibliography whose purpose is to draw attention to aspects of research not necessarily represented in a given volume. The selection guidelines for the inclusion of articles appear to vary: some articles were selected because they were presumed to represent 'the best of current scholarship', in addition to their potential influence on future research; others were selected for their synthesis of knowledge of a given discipline; while the inclusion of older material, whose findings in a field may well have been superseded, was felt justified because such material made an original contribution to an area of learning. Bearing these preliminary remarks in mind, it is evident that this volume is by no means an introductory work to the formative discipline of exegesis, but rather an academic impression of its origins, features, personalities and confined aspects of its theoretical framework. Notwithstanding the limitations of space and the seemingly invidious task faced by an editor in areas of scholarship where a surfeit of material is available, the scholarly perspective and interests of an individual editor are vital factors in determining a volume's contents, although Conrad expects that the proposed volumes would achieve 'well-rounded and representative synthesises' seemingly serving as 'well considered points of departure for a more detailed enquiry'. Andrew Rippin's research interests have left a distinct impression upon this volume and upon a second work in this series of which he is the editor: The Qur'an: Style and Contents. He was</page><page sequence="2">136 Journal of Qur'anic Studies largely influenced by the synthesis of the origins and development of the early Islamic tradition refined by the late John Wansbrough. Although the general tenor of the issue of origins was earlier probed by individuals such as Goldziher and Schacht, the defined features of an approach to this issue were furnished with inventive theoretical authority by Wansbrough. Accentuating the importance of salvation history, John Wansbrough was principally concerned with the role played by the religious consciousness of the early Islamic community and its presumed impact upon the emergence of canon: in this instance the canonical status of the Qur'an. He ventured a classification of early Islamic literature using a chronological-stylistic framework, suggesting it betrayed a conspicuous predisposition to the projection of canon. For Wansbrough the comparative sophistication of a given form of Arabic literature rested in direct proportion to the Islamic community's self-conscious attempts to interpret its past: the greater the level of sophistication displayed in this literature, the greater the likelihood that such material was insidiously formulated to satisfy the changing doctrinal needs of this community. The literary methodology and procedures employed in the earliest texts were not preserving primitive practices and procedures nor indeed historical fact, but rather they were deceptively projecting them. Wansbrough was convinced that the chronological sequence of literature on the Qur'an did not presuppose 'a standard or ne varietur textus receptus as early as the middle of the first/seventh century'; accordingly, the cUthmanic codex must be seen as a post third/ninth century occurrence composed from a conflation of Prophetic logia.1 Models and parallels for such intricate processes could be attested from the ancient Near East traditions. Wansbrough referred to a rabbinical model, which, by his own admission, was 'naturally inconclusive speculation'.2 The revolutionary potential of Wansbrough's theories encouraged a number of scholars to venture a reappraisal of the status and function of much of the exegetical, historical, legal and linguistic literature from the formative years of the Islamic tradition; and issues relating to salvation history, authenticity, ascription and the convoluted evolution of canon were axiomatic determinants applied in the attempts to unravel the presumed mystery surrounding the genesis of the Islamic tradition. As we shall see, the legacy of Wansbrough's synthesis of the early Islamic tradition is noticeably discerned in this volume; there are not only articles which develop aspects of the broad thrust of his thesis, but there is also material which serves as a prelude to the ideas and concepts upon which he was to elaborate. Nevertheless, Rippin has also included articles which offer a more conservative appraisal and interpretation of classical source material, including compositions which present qualitative studies of principal figures, themes and literature of the exegetical tradition.</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 137 The volume opens with the article of Claude Gilliot, which is one of the recent (1990) research contributions comprised in this volume, and this surveys the beginnings of Qur'anic exegesis through the veneer of salvation history. Gilliot pursues a line of enquiry which is premised upon the role played by the linguistic sciences and historiography in furtively providing historical depth and authority to the exegetical tradition; the 'irruption of grammar into exegesis' is identified by Gilliot as the critical reference point for this study, forming the basis for a number of the conclusions it reaches. This, however, has the effect of attenuating the role played by exegesis and the Qur'anic sciences in the evolution of grammar, thereby divesting the linguistic sciences of a history of their own, and one which their own theoretical sophistication evidently demands. In the words of Gilliot 'the discipline (exegesis) is marked by hagiography and bears all the marks of salvation history' and the struggle for 'orthodoxy'. Moreover, in his survey of the types of exegetical literature and their procedural features, Gilliot considers issues such as ascription, anachronism, retrojection and religious opposition to illustrate the deceptively artificial nature of this discipline and its real purpose and design: the quest for historical and religious legitimacy. The propensity to underline the salvation motif obscures the relative value of methods of analysis employed in many of these early texts. In the conclusions to his article, Gilliot refers to the Majdz al-Qur3an treatise of the Basran grammarian Abu cUbayda; it is presented as a text on rare words and usage of the Qur'an whose purpose was to sanction recourse to exegesis and establish the Arabic nature of the Qur'an's discourse. However, it is in reality a text devoted to a grammatical appraisal and justification of the linguistic configurations of the readings of scripture and one which belongs to a developed genre of writing whose own chequered history intimates close links with the exegetical and reading traditions. Abu cUbayda's Majdz al-QurJan and the grammatical procedures developed in his accomplished text also provide an important setting for Wansbrough's definitive contribution to this volume: 'Majdz al-Qur?an\ Periphrastic Exegesis' (Chapter 12). This 1970 article tells us much about the way in which Wansbrough's engaged analysis of source material rests not only upon the intrinsic value of such sources, but is crucially extended to this material's supposed role within a wider scheme of affairs. Moreover, emphasis upon this latter aspect can often disproportionately infringe upon the contextual parameters within which this material needs to be interpreted and understood. Wansbrough examined the technical significance of the term majdz as employed by Abu cUbayda, arguing that its use broadly supported Wansbrough's own thesis of the gradual emergence of Qur'anic canon; the term majdz originally referred to a form of linguistic explanation, although eventually it was to develop on a semantic plane to connote a metaphorical expression, being the antithesis of the so called veridical (haqlqa) expression. Wansbrough's vigorous study of this term is</page><page sequence="4">138 Journal of Qur'anic Studies prefigured to a large extent by the presumption that exegetical activity which is masoretic in nature was designed to conceal fractures impinging upon the linguistic integrity of canon. He contended that variant readings of scripture, grammatical analysis and lexical paraphrase were all elements of what he defined as 'masoretic' exegesis, which, according to his chronological typology, developed belatedly.3 Indeed, Wansbrough remarked that the literature of exegesis could not be described as strictly homogeneous. Within such finite strictures, the work of Abu cUbayda constitutes an exercise in periphrastic exegesis employed to rationalise solecisms and 'alleviate the strictures imposed upon the language by Quranic diction'.4 Yet critical to this thesis is the view that majaz denotes a form of textual restoration which deals primarily with ellipsis and anacolutha. Wansbrough argued that over a period of time, later generations of grammarians were to use the term taqdlr when referring to this linguistic device. This line of reasoning is of crucial importance as Wansbrough points to the fact that in the estimation of grammarians the 'restored text (muqaddar) was at least as valid as its original articulation (malfuzY: insinuating that primarily there existed an equivalence between exegesis and emendation; all the more reason to refute the existence of a single ne varietur text.5 Such is the theoretical depth and complexity of Wansbrough's synthesis of the early Islamic tradition that it inevitably hinges on a concomitant presence of factors. If, for example, the existence of canon is shown to have had an earlier provenance, then what purpose does the majaz procedure serve? Moreover, the activities of the linguists in their grammatical analysis of the diction of scripture were anchored to a synthetically derived Procrustean model of grammar. The linguists' inadvertent circumvention of the linguistic authority of canon occurs when they experiment with this abstract model of carabiyya, rendering its definition and elaboration principal objectives: emendation is not a desired motive. Kees Versteegh has attempted to trace the origin and development of early grammatical terminology, illustrating that many of these terms were technically employed in the literature of the early exegetical tradition prior to their use in the writings of the later Kufan and Basran linguists: thus terms such as idmdr (ellipsis), which has the same function as taqdlr, were already assigned a technical value in this early literature. One aspect of Wansbrough's theory depends on whether the appearance of the term qiyds and its usage by grammarians is a late phenomenon: if this were the case, it would suggest that the technical term taqdlr has an even later provenance; and yet it is an incontrovertible fact that throughout the period in which Abu cUbayda was writing such terms had definite technical values; and according to Versteegh, the term qiyds has an even earlier origin.6 In 1995, Rippin used the powerful, but equally expedient, argument of 'ascription' to question the significance of Versteegh's study, suggesting that it was not possible to determine the historical provenance of technical terminology using literature whose own</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 139 chronological constitution was open to question.7 However, it should be stated that the corollary of this antithesis in approaches to the relative authenticity, value and design of the primary sources together with the theories, concepts and trends which they encompass is that it sustains the amenability of the source material to a plethora of discrete interpretations which do not fully appreciate classical perceptions of the Islamic tradition; and their true value is seemingly inestimable. The semantic compass of majdz as employed in Abu cUbayda's treatise is the subject of another contribution included in this volume (Chapter 13). Ella Almagor's 1979 article takes into consideration Wansbrough's preliminary findings regarding the utility of this term, but contends that there is a profound complexity underpinning both its general gist and application and this would have been appreciated by fellow grammarians. Almagor states that majdz is simultaneously connected to a mode of expression. More significantly, having questioned the categorical equivalence of majdz with the device of taqdir, Almagor dismisses the use of the term 'periphrastic' to denote Abu cUbayda's modus operandi in his exegesis of scripture. However, in summarising the nature of the majdz device, Almagor seems to rely to a large extent on biographical detail. She notes that Abu cUbayda is generally maligned in the biographical sources, despite his Basran pedigree, as there is a profusion of anecdotes questioning both his religiosity and the academic integrity of his scholarship. Almagor tries to link this with Birkeland's view of the existence of opposition to tafsir during the early period of the Islamic tradition, adding that Abu cUbayda's implementation of a raa/az-based analysis of the holy text was revolutionary because it used profane literature and sources to illustrate conclusively the soundness of the Qur'anic expression, and this ostensibly provoked the disapproval of his peers. She also suggests that such an approach violated the transcendent character of revelation. However, it should be noted that such endeavours were pursued by generations of grammarians who preceded Abu cUbayda; they believed that they were merely elucidating and verifying the linguistic integrity and superiority of the Qur'anic expression. Maintaining a delicate balance between linguistic justification and elucidation of scripture required great sensitivity: the enthusiasm of linguists unintentionally results in their focusing upon justification and this shifts the focus of their attention away from the holy text. It is worth referring to a further authoritative examination of the majdz phenomenon. Wolffian Heinrich's 1984 article, not included in this volume, places the studies of Wansbrough and Almagor within a broader context while critically appraising the historical development of the haqlqa-majaz antithesis. This article generally dismissed Wansbrough's view that majdz indicated a form of textual restoration, and its author claimed that Almagor's explanation of this term did not encompass the full</page><page sequence="6">140 Journal of Qur'anic Studies technical extent of majaz. Heinrichs believed that the term majaz was originally part of the technical vocabulary of the earliest linguists and that it was invoked to indicate what he describes as a form of explanatory rewriting of phrases. He also asserted that this 'rewriting' might incidentally include transient references to figurative language, but this was not its exclusive function; he reported that the term majaz was synonymous with the frequently adduced phrases macna and tafslr. It was, however, specific to issues of linguistic interpretation along with the idiomatic use of certain words. Intriguingly, Wansbrough argues that the term majaz could not be equated with tafslr, as in 'explanation', because the latter term was not yet a terminus technicus. However, the proposition that majaz is not the equivalent of tafslr is far from conclusive. The term macnahu is occasionally used interchangeably by Abu cUbayda with the term majaz: an example of this occurs in his analysis of Q. 2:34, and at various junctures throughout the text when exploring lexical paraphrase.8 Norman Calder's 1988 study entitled 'Midrash to Scripture: The Sacrifice of Abraham in Early Islamic Tradition' (Chapter 4) examines a theme central to Wansbrough's view regarding Judaic influences within a nascent Islamic tradition. Wansbrough's conclusions apropos the emergence of Islamic canon entail a reassessment of the geographical location and environment which provided the framework for this tradition's inception. The broad confines of his theory suggest that the Meccan sanctuary and Hijaz were not the genuine birthplace of this faith, but overriding issues of religious identity witness this tradition relocate in an attempt to disassociate itself from its Judaic origins. The adoption of both primitive Arabian monotheism and the Meccan sanctuary are discerned as intrusive elements. A selection of early narratives recounting Abraham's sacrifice of his son is referred to by Calder to illustrate the plausibility and convincing nature of Wansbrough's postulate; Calder argues that not only does a comparative analysis of these narratives confirm the absence of a fixed body of scripture at the time these oral traditions were formulated, but they show that the very nature of these themes was undeniably Jewish in origin; moreover, they were assiduously reformulated, expanded and embellished to ensure an Arabic-Islamic bent to their composition; Ismacil displaces Ishaq as the subject of immolation; while the vicinity of the Meccan sanctuary serves as the symbolic location of these momentous events, supplanting Mount Moriah in Jerusalem (the site of the Dome of the Rock and the place which Islamic tradition associates with the nocturnal journey of the Prophet, al-Isra3). Notwithstanding the fact that the literary structures of the narratives referred to by Calder are formulated over an indeterminate period of time, along with the possibility that they are also prone to editorial reformulation (the precise wording of these narratives is used by Calder to highlight perceived discrepancies in canon), one really</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews 141 wonders whether such narratives serve as suitable indicators for inferring the relative status of canon. A number of Calder's assumptions are based on changes in the narrative formula of scripture in order to emphasise the ascription of the Qur'an to God. Thus the shift from the passive to the active tense (from nudiya to nddayndhu) was the result of editorial reformulation; the former is described as non-Qur'anic.9 However, one finds that the nudiya formula is actually retained in the Qur'anic diction: Q. 27:8 and Q. 28:30. If one is to accept the view that editorial reformulation occurred in order to emphasise the supernatural origin of the text, why should the formula be deliberately altered at one juncture in the text but seemingly retained at other points, thereby surely defeating the object of the exercise? Grammatical shifts in person, number and case, and formulaic devices introducing Qur'anic diction, are subtle stylistic and rhetorical features of the Arabic idiom. Furthermore, there are imperative liturgical dissimilarities between scripture and narrative: while the former is pre eminently governed by its devotional value, the latter, despite its exegetical merit, has a subsidiary role in the matrices of the religious sciences. Wansbrough, Calder and, indeed, Gilliot all refer to anachronisms which pervade a number of early exegetical texts, propounding the view that such texts were susceptible to editorial reformulation and seemingly reconciled with developed concepts of orthodoxy;10 Versteegh and Schoeler have suggested that distinctions in terms of the use of asdnid and the modes of narration showed that anachronisms were the result of ingenuous attempts on the part of narrators to introduce explanatory glosses of a particular riwdya, and they were clearly set apart from the main text. Building on the study of Schoeler, Versteegh comments that the disappearance of the 'strict opposition between oral and written transmission' had a bearing on the way later texts were conflated.11 Somewhat related is Jan Pauliny's 1969 survey of the qisas al-anbiya0 literature, which offers an account of the presumed historical background to the qisas genre (Chapter 15). It suggests that its format and content have an illustrious history which can be traced to the formative period of Arabic literature. Pauliny is primarily concerned with the didactic and somewhat functional design of this literature; these narratives are not mere mythology nor aimless storytelling but rather they contextualise the 'purpose and meaning of God's signs'. Furthermore, the structure of the narratives was shaped by the demands of the social environment for which they were intended. Pauliny asserts that the tremendous variety and historical depth in the presentation of this genre highlight its instructive value: the fact that legendary and mythological elements become salient characteristics of the works composed by fifth/eleventh century figures such as ThaclabT and Kisa3! does not, as some have suggested, diminish their functional relevance as a literary genre. The periods which proceed and precede the emergence of these two individuals' work bear testimony to the paraenetic quality of such writing.</page><page sequence="8">142 Journal of Qur'anic Studies The critical issue of whether there was opposition to the exegesis of scripture during the early years of the Islamic tradition forms the focal point of a number of articles in the volume. Harris Birkeland's 1955 contribution refutes the notion that there existed religious opposition to tafslr in the first century, suggesting that a strong opposition to all kinds of exegetical activity developed in the second century (Chapter 3). Birkeland is actually reassessing Goldziher's much earlier contention that definite opposition to tafslr activity existed in the first two centuries of Islam: Birkeland argues that opposition was confined to the second/eighth century.12 These views are challenged by Nabia Abbott in her 1967 seminal work, Studies in Arabic Literary Papyri II: Quranic Commentary and Tradition, a chapter of which is included as Chapter 2 of this volume. Referring to the studies of both Birkeland and Goldziher, Abbott concludes that the only form of opposition to tafslr related to those verses designated mutashdbihdt (ambiguous or parabolic) and that this opposition was characterised by a cautious approach to the interpretation of such verses, rather than an absolute abstention from exegesis therein: it did not temper the vigour and enthusiasm with which scholars from the second/eighth century pursued exegesis. Abbott's article addresses the existence of statements attributed to prominent scholars from that period in which these individuals expressed distinct opposition to the pursuit of tafslr. These were referred to by Birkeland and Goldziher in formulating their own suppositions, yet Abbott points out that scholars who voiced both reservation and caution were themselves quoted in classical compilations as the sources of various exegetical reports. Indeed, early philologists spoke reverently of the fact that the mutashdbihdt components of the Qur'an were unfathomable and yet this did not prevent them from proffering views as to the meanings of these verses. In 1977, Wansbrough introduced a conspiratorial dimension to the arguments: sensing a measure of simplicity in Abbott's approach, he argued that reports detailing widespread opposition to tafslr had a canonising function; the projected concept of opposition to exegesis sustains the impression of a fixed body of scripture.13 This represents a fine example of Wansbrough's prefiguring interpretations of the source material: he positions the narrative within a wider theoretical framework, but one could argue that presupposition here outweighs a demonstration of the facts. Goldziher, Birkeland and Abbott all agreed that the exegesis of verses designated mutashdbihdt was frowned upon within orthodoxy; but, as Gilliot points out in his article,14 there is little attempt to qualify just what was understood by the term mutashdbihdt. The subject of muhkamdt-mutashdbihdt verses and the theoretical implications of this exegetical mechanism are however usefully explored in Leah Kinberg's 1988 overview of the practical implications of these terms (Chapter 14). However, once again the issue of opposition to exegesis looms large in this synopsis. Taking into account Birkeland's contention regarding the status and application of early</page><page sequence="9">Book Reviews 143 tafsir, Kinberg suggests the muhkamat-mutashabihat mechanism resourcefully permitted the resort to exegesis to be configured according to religious requirements, and this adaptability was vital for the medieval discipline of tafsir. However, it is worth noting that philologists were accused of affirming the muhkamat-mutashabihat antithesis as an axiom of exegetical approaches to the interpretation of the text, although they seldom adhered to these theoretical boundaries. Indeed, one does find that despite these perceived strictures, the mutashdbihdt were the subject of profuse exegetical activity, with theories on the inimitability of the Qur'an, aspects of abrogation and the enigmatic letters all being vigorously ventured in the literature of tafsir.15 Andrew Rippin has been hugely influential in exploring the seemingly infinite potentialities of Wansbrough's presentation of the early Islamic tradition and the decisive role canon plays, applying it robustly to his exposition of the early exegetical tradition. This is reflected in his two contributions to this volume, both of which deal with the authenticity of two exegetical tracts ascribed to Ibn c Abbas: al-Lughat fiyl Qur?an and Gharib al-Qur?dn. The 1983 contribution (Chapter 6) is essentially a supplement to the 1981 article reprinted in Chapter 5.16 In line with distilling the different types of Qur'anic exegesis and their historical provenance, Wansbrough was sceptical of the use of profane literature to elucidate the language of scripture. He felt that this was not redolent of early exegetical practices, and that the resort to literary devices such as loci probantes from poetry was a posterior development. One particular text linked with Ibn c Abbas, MasaHl Nafic ibn al-Azraq, included statements linked to authorities from the early Islamic tradition approving of this practice; Wansbrough would argue that such statements represented a tour de force preconceived to provide sanction for such activities.17 Pursuing a number of preliminary observations made by Wansbrough regarding these tracts, Rippin deduced that the Gharib al-QurJdn comprised several layers of 'discrete methodologies and terminologies'. He then suggested that the treatise in question must therefore belong to a subsequent era in which all these terminologies and methodologies were integral components of a developed field of exegesis: Rippin comprehensively argued that the Gharib texts attributed to Ibn c Abbas could not possibly have been composed by this figure. These works were seen as manifestations of a process of projection. Intriguingly, Wansbrough had claimed that the substance of the arguments adduced in these types of treatises betrayed 'an exegetical method considerably posterior to the activity of Ibn cAbbas'; Rippin took the view that 'because of the large number of elements contained in the text which presuppose a prolonged and reasonably sophisticated treatment of the Quranic text' it was 'a distillation of several centuries of scholarly debate'.18 Although the question of the authenticity of these texts is pertinent, the fact that previous scholars were engaged in this type of sophisticated analysis is plausible: the</page><page sequence="10">144 Journal of Qur'anic Studies gharlb and lughat literature constituted literary genres of the developing Arabic linguistic tradition; and leading early Kufan and Basran linguists composed works in these areas of scholarship. The subtle shifts in the evolution of Arabic linguistic thought predicate that these types of genres have a much earlier provenance than has been hitherto accepted. It is understandable that an individual such as Farra3 (d. 207/821) should systematically include forms of gharlb and lughat analysis along with poetic shawahid in his Macanl al-Qur?an\ the nature of this type of linguistic approach was matured by his predecessors in the Arabic linguistic tradition.19 In a similar fashion it could be argued that, although it was the ensuing generation of exegetes after Ibn c Abbas who developed gharlb and lughat forms of analysis, such techniques were nonetheless previously in limited use. Issa Boullata's 1990 article on 'Poetry Citation as Interpretative Illustration in Qur'an Exegesis: MasdJil Nafic Ibn al-Azraq' (Chapter 7) does venture a more temperate interpretation of the resort to such devices as an instrument of exegesis in the early Islamic tradition. Despite agreeing with Wansbrough's contention that the conspicuous processes of accretion are discernible in such texts, Boullata believes that some of the material in the Masd?il text may well be authentic. He also refers to the effectiveness of an orally transmitted tradition common to traditional societies like those found in Arabia, asserting that this was an important channel through which early material of this nature could conceivably pass. As Boullata notes, Wansbrough took the view that the first treatise in which poetic citation had been employed with regularity was FarnP's Macdnl al-QurJdn?? Notwithstanding that the Macanl was modelled on earlier works by Farra3's peers within the Kufan and indeed Basran traditions, the whole purpose of these works was linguistically justifying the Qur'anic diction. The early tafslr of cAbd Allah ibn Wahb (125-97/743-812), Kitdb al-Jdmic, parts of which have been recently published by Miklos Muranyi, makes frequent use of poetic shawahid?1 On a final note, it is worth considering that Isaiah Goldfield's study of the tafslr of Ibn c Abbas, not included in this volume, reported that there existed a fair measure of accuracy in the transmission of early texts of this nature.22 He accepted that 'a degree of augmentation, interpolation, and editing had probably accompanied the transmitted original', an original which was narrated by a group of pupils with all the aforementioned additions. However, he argued that between these recensions the original can be reconstructed.23 Lothar Kopf's 1958 article on 'Religious Influences on Medieval Arabic Philology' (Chapter 11) served as an important locus for concepts regarding the saliency of the theological function of the Islamic sciences and the intricate interplay between history and religious identity.24 Kopf's thesis was that enterprise in these sciences was consciously predisposed to a theological design. He contended that religious strictures detrimentally tempered the progression of creative thought within the</page><page sequence="11">Book Reviews 145 Arabic linguistic tradition: grammatical and philological theories were modified to ensure that they were reconciled with the demands of a voluble orthodoxy. However, a review of some of the examples adduced by Kopf shows there were a number of inconsistencies in his interpretation of the source material and these clearly impinge upon the central premise of his thesis, which is further undermined by his tendency to generalise. This results in an imprecise synopsis of the function of the philological tradition. Kopf based many of his arguments on material derived from biographical sources which were not fully reconciled with material from primary sources. An interesting parallel in this respect relates to the views of both Goldziher and Birkeland regarding opposition to exegesis during the first two centuries of the Islamic tradition. The bases for such an argument were the statements attributed to pious individuals who urged restraint in this area of scholarship; and yet as Abbott showed the same individuals were actively engaged in all aspects of scriptural analysis. A similar pattern is discerned in the linguists' approach to concepts and theories of language. It would seem that even Kopf was conscious of this anomaly: he reported that a number of philologists dared to suggest emendations of peculiar Qur'anic readings, but then refrained on the account of the protestations of the theologians; however, he then adduced a number of instances of the supposed emendation of Qur'anic readings, claiming that 'scholars' had ventured these criticisms. It is also worth pointing out that in the instances referred to by Kopf it was both philologists and grammarians who were the source of these views: this underlines the lack of uniformity in Kopf's postulate that religious considerations hindered the dispassionate articulation of linguistic theories.25 The subject of tawqif al-lugha, the revelationist perspective on the origin of language, is further testimony to the fact that despite the existence of this doctrine of orthodoxy, linguists pursued philological theories which encroached upon the tenets of tawqif al-lugha, additional proof that the manner in which religious restraints operate is rather more subtle than proposed by Kopf.26 Nonetheless, Kopf's article provides an interesting perspective on the development of the philological tradition. In the editor's introduction to the volume, Rippin links the themes raised in Kopf's contribution with an authoritative 1951 article by Edmund Beck (Chapter 8) which explores the religious orthodoxy of the Kufan grammarian Farra3 (144-207/761-822): he suggests that both articles highlight the manipulation of scholarship for theological ends. However while this may be true of Kopf's hypothesis, it cannot be said of the general tenor of Beck's article. The manipulation of linguistic conceptions for doctrinal design is hardly countenanced by Farra3; far from it. Beck's article works towards dispelling the myth that the Kufan grammarian Farra3 was an avid proponent of Muctazilism. He achieves this by meticulously extrapolating the theological thought of this figure, examining allusions by Farra3 to</page><page sequence="12">146 Journal of Qur'anic Studies ahl al-qadar in his Macdnl al-Qur^dn, together with incidental references to religious doctrines which show this linguist aligning himself with the views of Sunni orthodoxy. It is Beck's painstaking deconstruction of the Macdni al-Qur^dn's linguistic discourse which resolves the propensity to orthodoxy espoused by its author Farra3. This article is of immense importance to those wishing to gauge the significance of the early Kufan linguistic tradition and its deep-rooted links with the symbols of religious orthodoxy. And this has obvious ramifications for conventional perceptions of this sophisticated tradition and its many proponents. Indeed, Beck concludes that the orthodoxy theology espoused by Farra3 was to be augmented and given greater form and definition by none other than Ashcari (260-324/873-935). The inclusion of Manfred Gotz's valuable 1965 study of the Kitdb al-Ta^wildt of Maturidi (d. 333/944) provides a fascinating insight into classical exegesis of the theological kind (Chapter 10). The ascendancy of reason in Maturidi's synthesis of theological doctrines through references to the Qur'anic text is striking; moreover, Maturidi's prolegomenon to the work presents an intriguing appraisal of the technical definitions of tafslr and ta3wll and their relevance to theological discourse.27 Gotz compares aspects of Maturidi's theology with the doctrinal stances advanced by Ashcari, although this is appraised in terms of Ashcari's espousing the orthodoxy of the Hanbalites. This exegetical treatise reveals how Maturidi deals with the arguments of the Muctazilites on topics such as maintaining the conception of human free will while upholding the omnipotence of God; and the impressive precision with which Maturidi positions the transcendence of God in his synthesis of religious orthodoxy. Thus Maturidi's Kitdb al-Ta3wlldt is not just countering the speculative exuberance of the Muctazilites in all aspects of their approach to dialectics, but it is consciously challenging the absurdities resulting from corporealism and anthropomorphism in the attempts to grapple with the Qur'anic conception of God and the imagery projected by scripture. The one article in this volume which explores the tradition of variant readings is Ramzi Baalbaki's 1985 digest of the treatment of qird?dt by second and third century grammarians (Chapter 9). It endeavours to define the early grammarians' scrutiny of this substantial corpus of linguistic data, deciding whether approaches to the rejection of idiosyncratic lectiones were reflections of a Kufan-Basran dichotomy. Baalbaki underlines the somewhat radical approach of grammarians to the corpus of Qur'anic readings, suggesting that a number of these individuals were openly sceptical of the fact that the linguistic configurations of the so-called qird?at were not distinguished as emblems of linguistic eloquence, and that they openly indulged in appraising readings on the basis of grammatical norms which they themselves developed. Baalbaki refers to the tangible divide separating nahwl and qdri3 and the fact that grammarians were in a position to assert their independence. However, the key to the</page><page sequence="13">Book Reviews 147 issue is quantifying the nature of the relationship between qira?a and Qur3an. Baalbaki speaks of a well-defined appreciation of the abstraction between the Qur'an and the qira3at, claiming that early grammarians understood a distinction between the two. But from a theoretical perspective the two are intricately entwined: the qira3at are infinitesimal linguistic variations distinguishing the Qur'anic text. It is true that certain dialectal features of variants are readily accommodated by the latitude granted via the doctrine of huruf, however, the subtle interplay among morpho-syntactic variants is far more complex. This helps explain why differences of opinion occur between grammarians and readers. Baalbaki finds it strange that an individual such as Mubarrad (d. 285/898), a distinguished Basran linguist, should write on the subject of ihtijaj (a form of grammatical apologia for Qur'anic readings), particularly as he was a fervent critic of readers and readings which contravened the prescriptive conventions determined by grammarians. However, this assumption clearly fails to grasp the premise of such works: the hegemony of the model of carabiyya as an instrument for the authentication of scripture. He also expresses the view that 'the classification of the qird3at into sabciyya or otherwise can be traced only as far as Ibn Mujahid'. This view clearly requires revision. It is evident that there were many readers and grammarians who produced treatises which collated Qur'anic readings as early as the late 2nd/8th century: the collections composed by grammarians tended to accentuate parity with models of grammar in their criteria for the linguistic justification of readings; the readers' texts favoured a reliance upon more conservative methods, namely the dominion of narration. Focusing on a study of the term khalifa in the literature of early Qur'anic exegesis, Wadad al-Qadi (Chapter 16; 1988) sets out to gauge the manner in which exegetes who lived during the Umayyad period understood this term. Qadi reflects upon whether these exegetes made the telling connection between the political connotation inherent in philological explanations of khalifa and the political reality and legitimacy of the Umayyad caliphate: had scholars justified Umayyad rule adducing Qur'anic verses which referred to khalifa! Qadi concludes that a nexus was made in respect of this term, but only towards the end of Umayyad rule and the ensuing decade. Qadi accepts the limitations imposed on the conclusions she reaches as a result of the relative provenance of the accepted source material which is used to illustrate her argument; some of the material is sourced to regions where an anti-Umayyad sentiment prevailed, although this is by no means definitive proof of the predisposition of such material. Indeed, Qadi takes the view that opposition to the Umayyads can be inferred on the basis of exegetical interpretations of the term khalifa. (The merits of studies relying upon early texts are that they allow classical perceptions of source material to prevail. It is ironic to note however that if one were</page><page sequence="14">148 Journal of Qur'anic Studies to evaluate the methodology employed by Qadi on the basis of Rippin's own critique of Versteegh's synthesis of the evaluation of grammatical terminology in early exegetical tracts and his specific objection that there are problems with the methodology simply because the material found in the texts may have been subjected to interpolation and subsequent glosses, then the conclusions derived from Qadi's study would also presumably remain open to question. But such arguments remain circular.) The volume ends with the contribution of a scholar whose research interests focus upon the legal implications regarding the establishment of Qur'anic canon and the significance of a theory of abrogation (naskh) together with its function in the resolution of scripture. John Burton was of the opinion that the science of abrogation was formulated to surmount so-called contradictions arising from the original legal configuration of the text. His article, which was written in 1970, cogently assesses the historical value of the infamous Satanic Verses episode. The narrative associated with this incident recounts that the Prophet was worshipping in the Meccan sanctuary along with a number of his companions at a time when resistance to his message was most fierce. He had desired that Quraysh might be persuaded to accept his religion. It is while entertaining this desire that verses are revealed to him: (Q. 53:19-20). However, when the Prophet reached the verses which speak of the pre-Islamic goddeses al-Ldt, al-cUzza and al-Mandt, he was said to have been beguiled by Satan who cast on his tongue a number of 'verses' praising these goddesses: 'These are the high-flying cranes; verily their intercession is to be hoped for'. It was reported that Quraysh were delighted that the Prophet mentioned their goddesses in such high esteem and they along with a number of companions fell prostrate when the Prophet completed his recitation of these so-called verses. It is then recounted that the archangel Gabriel came to the Prophet and admonished him for including words which had not been revealed to him; he then revealed to him the following verses: (Q. 22:52) We have not sent before you a Messenger or Prophet save that Satan sought to cast into his recitation something not from it; but God cancels what Satan has cast. Burton noted that classical Muslim scholarship questioned the soundness of these reports on the basis that not only do they compromise the monotheistic message championed by the Prophet, but the very asanid used to relate this event do not inspire confidence. He also remarked that Western commentators such as William Muir, Montgomery Watt and Alfred Guillaume argued that the reports which refer to this event had to be sound as there was no plausible motive or reason for scholars of the Islamic tradition to invent such a narrative; indeed, in the words of Guillaume, 'The incident is the strongest possible testimony to the sincerity of Muhammad'.28 Burton contended that Leone Caetani, who first questioned the historicity of this event and echoed Muslim scholarship's reservations regarding the asanid, was never able to</page><page sequence="15">Book Reviews 149 suggest a motive for the fabrication of this narrative, but that he himself had succeeded in discovering the elusive 'theoretical motive' for the invention of these reports (although never the exact source). Burton claimed that they provide sanction for an elaborate theory of abrogation and were fabricated for that very purpose. Accordingly, the historicity of this narrative could be categorically dismissed. In his article Burton was able to show that by employing a subtle exposition of Q. 2:106, which becomes the locus classicus for the doctrine of naskh, early scholars identified different modes of naskh which were then applied to reconcile legal discrepancies supposedly inherent in the Qur'anic canon. Burton argued that one of the consequences of rationalising these legal discrepancies was that there was a need to place distance between the Prophet and editorship of the Qur'an: the cUthmanic collection reports performed that task. Thus in Burton's estimation, the accounts are completely fictitious and linked to developments in jurisprudence. Burton concluded that the so-called cUthmanic codex reflected the redactional endeavours of the Prophet, a view which stands in contradistinction to Wansbrough's thesis. In accentuating the legal saliency of arguments, particularly in terms of the different modes of naskh, Burton stresses the exegetical relationship between the Qur'an and Sunna at the expense of the Qur'an's liturgical value, which Burton does accept is important in identifying the Qur'an as a source as opposed to a document (mushaf). In his hypothesis variant readings are insidious instruments used to propound legal discourse, although a theological dimension is simultaneously discerned; but Burton evidently glosses over the devotional function of these readings. There is also the fact that many of the variances in readings operate at the morpho-syntactic level; many of the variant readings are univocal. Comparatively, they are less frequently adduced to substantiate legal doctrines. If one were to reduce the prominence of a juridical motive, one might conclude that the Satanic Verses episode bears all the markings of an embellished literary narrative. Intriguingly, in Wansbrough's review of Burton's work The Collection of the QurJan, which represents a thorough fleshing out of the development of a theory of naskh, he commented that it was a remarkable work which was the fruit of many years' study, but that he himself had persistently sought the 'demolition' or at least 'modification' of the work's thesis.29 For Burton the juridical function of scripture together with its liturgical value as a source predicates its fixed status; neither rabbinical models nor literary criticism plays any role in Burton's synthesis of the source materials. Wansbrough on the other hand would argue that the whole purpose of so-called Halakhic exegesis was to create the impression of a fixed canon. The findings and indeed the methodology of these two figures are diametrically opposed, but they continue to represent definitive chapters in academic approaches to the Qur'an and the exegetical tradition.30</page><page sequence="16">150 Journal of Qur'anic Studies All in all, the volume is generally well-produced, although it does comprise a number of typographical errors which stem from the original preparation of the articles. These have been retained in the reproduction of this material: p. viii, 'Wansborough' for Wansbrough; p. 93, 'deveopment' for development; p. 177, 'unquestionalbe' for unquestionable; p. 264, 'suggets' for suggests; p. 327, 'titer for title; p. 328 'leas' for least; p. 333, 'Qatad'as' for Qatada's; p. 334, 'recenion' for recension. And the volume's title erroneously appears under the name The Qur'an: Text and Interpretation in the listing provided for the series. The volume's main strength rests upon it furnishing a broad overview of academic perspectives and approaches to the formative tradition of exegesis, particularly those which are current and predominant. Comprising many fascinating and thought provoking contributions, the volume draws attention to the theoretical debates which have prefigured approaches to exegesis, focusing upon the issues of the emergence of canon, together with perceptions of authenticity, historicity and ascription. The editor has pointed out that the collective aim of these volumes was to provide a categorical introduction to current research strategies and perspectives in respect of a given area of learning. This volume has succeeded in that aim, although one senses that this may have been achieved by relegating an approach which might have afforded a more composed synopsis of the classical sub-disciplines and conceptual features of the formative exegetical tradition. Moreover, knowledge of the subject matter is seemingly presumed and not made explicit even though, as indeed is pointed out in the general editor's preface to the volume, works of this nature often serve as a reference point for researchers and students wishing to acquaint themselves with this tradition for the first time. One striking feature of this volume is that a careful appraisal of the contents, themes and personalities covered in the various articles intimates the substantive nature of the Arabic linguistic tradition's contribution to the exegetical tradition and approaches to the holy text. And this should furnish promising leads and avenues for future academic research.
