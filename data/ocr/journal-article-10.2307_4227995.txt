<plain_text><page sequence="1">J U' JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES Vol. XXXVIII No. 1 March 2004 The Three Laws of Thermodynamics and the Theory of Production Elias L. Khalil The paper takes issue with Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen's interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics (entropy law) and its relevance to the economics of production. The paper concurs with experts on thermodynamics that Georgescu-Roegen has commit- ted a major error. Namely, Georgescu-Roegen's notion of "material entropy," which he christened as the "fourth law of thermodynamics," is unfounded. Of more importance, Georgescu-Roegen's purported law, as the application of the second law to the realm of matter, is a grave conceptual blunder. The paper argues that the first law (conservation law) is the more relevant law of thermodynamics if one wants to account for production costs. Interestingly, the much neglected third law of thermodynamics, rather than the second, should be the one to act as the proper analogy to the nature of production. Despite the shortcoming of Georgescu-Roegen's concept of material entropy, his distinction between funds and stocks is useful. Stocks-such as oil or mineral depos- its-provide flows which necessarily entail the diminishing of the stocks. Funds-such as lakes and forests-provide services which are renewable if the funds are exploited at sus- tainable rates. With the help of the concepts of production cost and funds, Georgescu-Roegen's thesis about the impossibility of full recycling can be affirmed-but without reference to the entropy law or Georgescu-Roegen's version of that law, what he calls the "fourth law of thermodynamics." In the end, the paper shows that the impossi- bility of full recycling of matter parallels the basic insight of the third law with regard to energy.

Khalil To show this, the paper advances the centrality of institutions and technology, what is coined here the "technologicaVinstitutional regime of production" or, in short, the regime of production. The regime is a more-or-less coherent bundle of fundamental institutions and basic technologies that inform everyday productive activities (see Khalil 1995a and 1997). The paper is critical of Georgescu-Roegen's "material entropy" on the basis that it defines resources independently of the regime of production. As Clarence Ayres (1941), Wesley Mitchell (1941), and Erich Zimmermann (1951) argued, resources are not given but rather created by active agents. John Dewey and Arthur Bentley (1973; see Khalil 2003) provided a philosophical framework, the "transactional view," which substantiates the Ayres/Mitchell/Zimmermann thesis. Namely, resources do not exist independently of the active knower. What is a resource depends on the transaction between the knower and the object of knowing, the environment. However, regimes of production are never static. While they are capable of creating more resources with innovations, there is no guarantee that innovations and the cre- ation of resources will continue at a steady rate. A regime of production, which acts as a fund, may face increasing costs of production as the flow of innovations falls behind the rate of exhaustion of stocks. Any particular regime is highly entrenched either because of high transaction costs or because of the path-dependent (inertia) character of innova- tions. The inflexibility of regimes of production in the face of declining resource stocks and innovation rates allows pressures to build up. Such a scenario may provide an endogenous account of the discontinuous development of technologicaVinstitutional regimes-whose investigation is left for further research. The second law of thermodynamics is deceptively an attractive tool to discuss the hypothesis of degradation of the environment. The second law seems pliable enough to be stretched in different directions to dress up some divergent approaches to the eco- nomics of environmental resources.' The entropy law simply states that an isolated sys- tem, consisting of segmented but connected domains, tends toward equilibrium.2 The domains can be made up of different kinds of gases or consist of the same kind of gas but with temperature or pressure differences. Thermodynamic equilibrium, known as the production of maximum entropy, involves the vanishing of differences among the domains.3 It would take a whole volume to survey the manner in which economists and other social scientists have employed this law in divergent and confusing ways. The paper rather limits itself to theoretical clarifications and their ramifications with regard to the degradation of environmental resources. It proposes two theses, one positive and the other critical. Concerning the positive thesis, the paper argues that the first law of ther- modynamics (i.e., the law of conservation) has immediate relevance to the theory of pro- duction and the issue of environmental degradation. This is not a novel conclusion. Many economists have reached the same result (e.g., Ayres and Kneese 1969; Kneese, Ayres and d'Arge 1970; Ayres 1978; Ayres and Miller 1980; Kneese 1989; Ayres 1993; Duchin and Lange 1994). However, this paper reaches this conclusion by relating the degradation of resources to the theory of production via the well-known distinction</page><page sequence="3">The Three Laws of Thermodynamics and the Theory of Production 203 advanced by Georgescu-Roegen (1970, 1971, 1977, 1979, 1981) between funds and stocks.4 Concerning the critical thesis and contrary to Georgescu-Roegen's central claim, the paper maintains that the second law of thermodynamics has only a marginal rele- vance to the theory of production and the degradation of resources. Other physicists and economists have discredited Georgescu-Roegen's "fourth law of thermodynamics," which invents the concept "material entropy" (e.g., Auer 1977; Ayres and Nair 1984; Young 1991 and 1994; Mayumi 1993; Bianciardi et al. 1993). This paper, however, reaches its conclusion via the distinction between microscopic fluctuations and macro- scopic states. The distinction hopefully sheds new insights on the economics of resources in general. One such insight highlights the static character of the entropy law, which economists sometimes confuse with the dynamic version of the law. Such a ver- sion is mostly associated with Ilya Prigogine's (1980) work on far-from-equilibrium ther- modynamics.5 This paper ignores the economic resources literature which applies Prigogine's work or, in general, which tries to link the entropy law to nonergodic dynamics arising from positive feedback (e.g., Perrings 1987; Faber and Proops 1990; O'Connor 1991; passim Burley and Foster 1994; cf. Khalil 1994a and 1995b). The literature focuses on the economics of self-feeding mechanisms, auto-dynamics, discontinuous patterns of regional development, multiple equilibria, discontinuous business cycles, and so on. Such an aspect of the entropy law has also been used by ecologists such as T. F. H. Allen and T. B. Starr (1982). Autocatalytic dynamics has been extended into economics in dif- ferent directions by authors such as, inter alios, Kenneth Boulding (1978), Peter Allen (1988), Chuck Dyke (in Weber et al. 1988, in Burley and Foster 1994) Michael Radzicki (1990), James Buchanan and Viktor Vanberg (1991), John Foster (1993), and, most comprehensively, Barkley Rosser (1991). This paper ignores the issue of positive feedback because it raises problems separate from the one pursued here, production theory in relation to environmental resources. The environmental aspect of production/consumption raises the question of how to model the dependency of a complex organization as a unified purposeful agent on the influx of matter/energy from the environment. In contrast, non-equilibrium, positive feedback is about the specificity on how to model the influx. It is true that nonlinear, dynamic models involve environmental degradation. The point is that using nonlinear techniques borrowed from thermodynamics is about the relevance of the techniques, not the relevance of the laws of thermodynamics.6 Section one provides an overview. The second and third sections deal with the entropy law in connection to production/consumption activities: While section two discusses the entropy law with regard to material flow, section three handles the entropy law in relation to energy flow. Section four argues that Georgescu-Roegen's thesis about the impossibility of complete recycling can be salvaged if related to the conception of technology and institutions as "funds" in Georgescu-Roegen's sense of the term.</page><page sequence="4">204 Elias L. Khalil An Overview This essay uses Georgescu-Roegen's work on the entropy law as the organizing cen- ter of its theses. Georgescu-Roegen (1971 and 1979) has provided the most fundamen- tal rationale for the supposed economic relevance of the entropy law. If one wants to evaluate further refinements of the economic relevance of the entropy law (e.g., Perrings 1987; Faber and Proops 1990; O'Connor 1991; Burley and Foster 1994), one must first deal with foundational issues which no one handled better than Georgescu-Roegen. Georgescu-Roegen was a pioneer in the advocacy of the reconstruction of theory of production on the basis of the entropy law: [Tlhe thesis that I have endeavored to develop in this book [is], namely, that the basic nature of the economic process is entropic and that the Entropy Law rules supreme over this process and over its evolution. (1971, 238) Elsewhere, he similarly asserted, "Most important for the student of economics is the point that the Entropy Law is the taproot of economic scarcity" (1976, 9).7 The paper examines these statements at the conceptual level. If they are found faulty at that level, there would be no need to judge them at the empirical level. To wit, empirical corrobora- tion of Georgescu-Roegen's argument would not amount to a confirmation of the argu- ment if it were, to start, based on defective conceptual grounds. Even when the predictions of a theory are corroborated with facts, the theory would not be substantiated unless it were logically coherent to begin. Otherwise, the theory of cyclical feuds by ad hoc gods should also become plausible given that the weather patterns are found empiri- cally to change seasonally. Concerning the critical thesis, the paper shows that while it has some tangential relevance, the entropy law is conceptually the wrong starting point for the theory of production.8 However, and here is the positive contribution, this should not lead to the repudiation of Georgescu-Roegen's theory of production or the relevance of other laws of thermodynamics. To elaborate, focusing on material flow instigated by production/consumption activity, the paper argues that the dispersion of material resources resulting from waste disposal cannot be explained by the entropy law. The entropy law is rather about what one may call the "vanishing of disequilibrium," where microscopic fluctuations are rele- vant. The dispersion of matter generally is not the outcome of microscopic fluctua- tion-a basic concept of the entropy law. In contrast, by focusing on energy flow instigated by production/consumption activity, there is a certain waste production called "entropic cost," which is based on the entropy law. Namely, it is the inevitable heat waste resulting from the extraction of work (coherent energy in the form, e.g., kinetic motion or electricity) from heat. However, such an "entropic cost" makes up only a minor subset of the costs of the production/consumption process. The major subset involves the expenditure of work, dubbed "production cost," which is not pre- mised on the entropy law. Confusion arises because, while production cost is not pre- mised on the entropy law, it does raise the entropy of the system. But the rise of entropy</page><page sequence="5">The Three Laws of Thermodynamics and the Theory of Production 205 is a by-product of production/consumption; the entropy law cannot explain the cause of production cost and the subsequent rise of entropy. Production/Consumption and Resource Dispersion We first need to understand the character of diffusion of matter in general, abstracted from production and consumption activities undertaken by agents. The entropy law deals with the dissipation of potential differences (i.e., disequilibrium), like temperature or pressure difference between two linked regions. According to the entropy law, an isolated system gravitates toward equilibrium (the disappearance of potential) because of microscopic fluctuations, i.e., the incessant kinetic motion of mol- ecules that make up the gas. As long as there is no microscopic fluctuation behind cer- tain erosions, degradation of resources, or diffusions of matter, such phenomena cannot be explained via the second law. That is, not all phenomena of diffusion are pre- mised on the entropy law. They can be the result of friction or other processes. A second issue is whether the entropy law becomes relevant when we introduce pro- ductive/consuming agents, ranging from non-human to human animals. The harness- ing of abiotic nutrients and the amassing of soils by plants engenders more concentrated matter useful for animals. However, the consumption of plants by an animal engenders, in the end, a dispersion of matter from the perspective of that animal. Here is the issue: Is the dispersion of matter engendered by the animal of the same character as the diffu- sion of matter caused by microscopic fluctuations upon which the entropy law is based? The former takes place in relation to an active organism, while the latter is an objective phenomenon. That is, the dispersion can be defined only in relation to one organism, which could be useful for another organism. This cannot be said with regard to diffusion of matter arising from microscopic fluctuations. Georgescu-Roegen missed this difference when he treated resources in relation to a living organism as objectively "low entropy": Casual observation suffices now to prove that our whole economic life feeds on low entropy, to wit, cloth, lumber, china, copper, etc., all of which are highly ordered structures. But this discovery should not surprise us. It is the natural consequence of the fact that thermodynamics developed from an economic problem and consequently could not avoid defining order so as to distinguish between, say, a piece of electrolytic copper-which is useful to us-and the same copper molecules when diffused so as to be of no use to us. We may then take it as a brute fact that low entropy is a necessary condition for a thing to be useful. (1971, 277-278) Georgescu-Roegen considered "material entropy" to accelerate with the exploita- tion of useful inputs because they show up, sooner or later, as non-useful material waste. In this manner, he conflated "usefulness" with "low entropy" or, what is the same thing,</page><page sequence="6">206 Elias L. Khalil "waste" with "high entropy." In some cases, Georgescu-Roegen qualified the identifica- tion of usefulness with low entropy by alluding to "poisonous mushrooms," which are low-entropuy but non-useful to animals. In such cases, according to Georgescu-Roegen, low entropy acts only as a necessary condition, but not the sufficient condition, for objects to have value (1981, 68). But this still begs the question of why usefulness, which is a quality discovered or invented by the acting agent, requires low entropy. Likewise, although expressing an optimistic view of the viability of recycling in con- trast to Georgescu-Roegen, Malte Faber et al. (1987, chap. 1), set up a foursector intertemporal model along the Austrian theory of capital to emphasize that the econ- omy depletes minerals and emits pollutants, i.e., dispersed resources, which supposedly increase the entropy of the environment. But with the help of human recycling and autonomous environmental recycling, fully depreciated goods and pollutants could be fully transformed, if the rate of production is properly synchronized, into useful, low entropy resources: The supply of the economic system with raw materials from the environmental sector can therefore only be secured if the ecological system possesses the long-run capability of providing a negative flow of entropy into the economic system. (104) 9 The conception of useful resources as "low entropy" was also echoed by Tran Huu Dung (1992, 199). He combined the entropy law and E. Schr6dinger's (1944) thesis that life feeds on low entropy to come up with a conspicuous postulate: "Had living organisms not existed, the entropic increase of the consumed substance (e.g., foods) would have occurred at a slower pace, ceteris paribus." To start, from Dewey and Bentley's (1973) transactional standpoint, one cannot use the term "food" without ref- erence to living organisms. Concurring also with Georgescu-Roegen, Kozo Mayumi (1993, 351) commenced his essay with the assertion that "the economic process consists of two parts: one is production/consumption in which raw materials are transformed into useful economic goods, and the other is consumption in which low entropy inputs are utilized, ultimately resulting in high entropy wastes." There are at least two major problems with the concept of "material entropy." First, the entropy concept, within particular conditions, is objective. In contrast, resources, pol- lutants, and fully depreciated goods are, in important respects, subjective. Following the Ayres/Mitchell/Zimmermann thesis, and Dewey's theory of action, a thing is deter- mined to be a resource only in light of the active agent, powered by tools and organiza- tion (see Khalil 2003). For instance, oxygen was literally poisonous for early life forms until the arrival of cyanobacteria, also called "blue-green algae." Also, if it were not for cyanobacteria, atmospheric nitrogen would have not been available as a resource for the production of proteins, a critical ingredient in all life forms. Likewise, yogurt and many other fermented foods are waste products for the producing bacteria, while they are use- ful for humans. To wit, yogurt is certainly easier to digest than milk for most human adults. If one subscribes to the material entropy concept, why should usefulness to</page><page sequence="7">The Three Laws of Thermodynamics and the Theory of Production 207 humans be the criterion upon which one decides the entropy magnitude? If usefulness is the criterion, the entropy magnitude cannot be ascertained within the particular conditions as an objective characteristic. As noted by Jeffrey Young (1991) and Sjak Smulders (1995; cf. Daly 1992; Townsend 1992), matter cannot be aggregated and conceived independent of technol- ogy. The determination of whether a certain matter is "garbage," i.e., not worth recy- cling, or a resource which could be used as an input depends on the active agent with its specific technological/institutional regime (Khalil 1995a). In other words, what is con- sidered a wasteful good not worth recycling for one society because it is comparatively cheaper to extract fresh inputs from nature could be worth recycling for another society or for the same society at a different time, given the higher cost of mining. Let us examine the iron specks that fall on a factory floor as a result of machine fric- tion in comparison to iron ore in a nearby mine. It is reasonable to regard, under the current technological/institutional regime, the cost of recycling the iron specks or metal fillings as more expensive than mining the iron ore. Therefore, the iron specks on the factory floor are less useful than the iron ore in the ground. But does that mean the iron specks have higher entropy than iron ore? The answer would be positive if one follows the logic of the "material entropy" concept. However, in the event that the next avail- able iron ore deposit lies on the ocean floor or, worse yet, under the moon's surface, the iron specks on the factory floor would probably become more useful relative to mining. In such a case, should the entropy of the iron specks become low relative to the entropy of the iron ore? It would be absurd to reverse the relative entropy magnitudes as a result of the location of the mine. Entropy is objective; it is not a function of the location of the agent and the mine. The second and more important reason why Georgescu-Roegen's concept "mate- rial entropy" is unfounded is related to microscopic fluctuations and macroscopic states (hereafter, the "micro-macro distinction"). Many critics of Georgescu-Roegen's concept have failed to note the micro-macro distinction, which can be elucidated clearly in iso- lated systems. At the micro-level, molecules are in constant motion, where each mole- cule has its own identity. At the macro-level, the unique identities of molecules are irrelevant because they are non-noticeable. 'What is noticeable at the macro level is whether the fast (hot) and slow (cold) molecules are evenly distributed. If the diverse molecules are evenly distributed in the system, the system has a homogeneous tempera- ture, i.e., maximum entropy or maximum disorder. If the molecules are not evenly dis- tributed, the system has some order (i.e., hot and cold regions) and hence has not reached its maximum entropy or maximum disorder. Once a systerm reaches maximum entropy (i.e., equilibrium among its regions), it reaches a macrostate that corresponds with a huge amount of microstates as entailed by the particular identities of the mole- cules. That is, for the single macrostate of equilibrium (maximum entropy), there is no single arrangements of parcular molecules. In fact, the stochastic motion of molecules at the micro level is what brings about and sustain the macrostate of equilibrium.</page><page sequence="8">208 Elias L. Khalil We do not have such mico-macro issue with regard to the dispersion of materials. To begin, what might the initial collection of inputs from nature, the construction, the usage, and ultimate degradation of, e.g., clothes, buildings, and bridges, entail? Can the initial and final states be differently described from the micro and macro perspectives? That is, does the dispersion of matter involve microscopic fluctuation which leads to equilibrium at the macroscopic level? Let us assume that, using initial and final states separated by an analytical time period, materials in the final state are more dispersed than the same materials in the ini- tial state. This entails that fresh inputs from nature would be more concentrated than the total final depreciated outcome. Metaphorically speaking, let us take a sand box of size X that is full of sand and includes Y amount of beads hidden from sight. Production activity amounts to the search, collection, and assembly of beads into a necklace. In con- trast, the activity of consumption and ultimate depreciation amounts, as Georgescu-Roegen appropriately has argued, to the breakup of the necklace and the inescapable dispersion of individual beads into a sand box of size of size nX, where n &gt; 1. The end result of production/consumption is the greater dispersion of matter, where Y beads are hidden in a larger sand box. Such dispersion is the result of agency intervention. But even when the dispersion is not the result of agency interven- tion-such as the case of the diffusion of top soil-can we describe the dispersion of mat- ter as premised on the entropy law? Can the difference between the initial and final concentrations of matter be described as the rise of net entropy as Georgescu-Roegen argues? One must be careful. In classical thermodynamics, entropy is measured in terms of state parameters (temperature, pressure, chemical composition, and so on) with no explicit reference to the microscopic level. With the advent of the Boltzmann Law, the statistical definition of entropy is valid to every system characterized by the micro-macro distinction, S = knW (1) where k is Boltzmann's constant and W stands for the number of equally probable set-ups or states accessible to the system at the microscopic level.1" That is, greater W means greater disorder at the microscopic level. The probability (P) of each set-up is 1/W and, hence, S= -k ln P (2) 12 But how does the linking of cold and hot regions, which engenders equilibrium in isolated systems, generate greater entropy or disorder (lower P)? That is, how could one intuitively relate the equilibration of temperature to greater entropy? The connection is simple, but worth reiterating.13 The linking of hot and cold domains allows the rela- tively hotter molecules more locations to occupy. This raises the net amount of micro-</page><page sequence="9">The Three Laws of Thermodynamics and the Theory of Production 209 scopic set-ups (W). Thus, the rise of entropy, which is measured at the macroscopic state as the disappearance of difference in temperature, is nothing more than the increase of disorder or possible set-ups at the microscopic level. That is, the entropy magnitude arises from the probabilities of different distributions of set-ups at the microscopic plane. As put by Jeffrey Wicken:14 The basis for assigning a thermodynamic system an entropy quantity comes from the irreducibility of its matter-energy distribution uncertainties. At any point in time a system can have only one particular distribution of physical elements and thermal energies (microstate) out of many alternative distribu- tions consistent with macroscopic parameters. Entropy is a measure of this uncertainty. It is a property of the macrostate, of the ensemble of possibilities, rather than of any microstate. A configuration of scrabble pieces is not a macrostate. (1987, 21) That is, the different configuration of scrabble pieces cannot be described as entropy because each macrostate corresponds to a particular microstate. There has to be incessant and non-noticeable motion of micro pieces, engendering innumerable microstates, so that the macrostate of equilibrium can be the subject of the entropy law. The incessant motion at the microscopic level, in the sense of objective statistical distri- bution that arises from the constant interaction of molecules, engenders the phenome- non of equilibrium at the macroscopic state. There is equilibrium because such a macroscopic phenomenon is the most probable; that is, the great majority of micro- scopic set-ups yield the same equilibrium phenomenon at the macroscopic level."5 There has to be a precise and non-arbitrary micro-macro distinction in order for entropy to have the meaning assigned to it by physicists. There can be no entropy, in the sense of entropy law, defined for a system whose constituent parts are arranged in a fixed setting like the unique "configuration of scrabble pieces." The beads in the X or the nX-sized sand box do not constitute or behave according to the entropy law because they are not subject to microscopic fluctuation. The beads or resources were dispersed because of the intervention of the agent or intervention, in case of soil erosion, wind. There could be an entropy increase if the beads break out stochastically and spread from the X to the nX sand box as a result of inertial kinetic energy and when the micro-macro distinction is pertinent. The process of production/consumption obviously does not set the beads to roam randomly in the sand box. The process of production/consumption just transforms the state from being concentrated to being less concentrated: there is, to start, no micro- scopic uncertainty with regard to the location of the beads in order to engender higher entropy. The transformation certainly makes-given the empirical conjecture about the greater dispersion from the X to nX sand box-the second round of production, for the same agent with the same endosomatic or exosomatic technology, more difficult.16 But the rise of difficulty seems unrelated to the question of entropy. The difficulty appears</page><page sequence="10">210 Elias L. Khalil to be the result of the worsening of the environment from the perspective of the acting agent with a certain technology and institutions. Contrary to Georgescu-Roegen's "material entropy," the possible dispersion of resources brought out by the intervention of the agent, or the result of erosion, cannot be couched in objective entropy magnitude. If there is a process of dispersion of resources, and the micro-macro distinction does not apply, it cannot be premised on the entropy law. Table 1 attempts to summarize the conceptual distinctions discussed above and show where the analysis is leading. In light of the previous section, the set on the left encompasses the diffusion of matter which arises from friction, temperature changes, and other stochastic interactions-while the subset within the set captures only the cases where diffusion engenders the dissipation of available energy or higher entropy. In con- trast, in light of this section which focused on material flow, the set on the right encom- passes the dispersion of matter arising from production/consumption carried out by an agent with specific tools, organization, and behavioral habits. The right-hand set differs from the left-hand set for two reasons: First, resources are defined in transaction with the agent-they cannot be identified abstractly. Second, the dispersions of resources are, in most cases, not characterized by the micro-macro distinction necessary for the increase of entropy. This does not mean that the cost of production/consumption activity is totally unrelated to the second law. As the Carnot cycle shows, there are cases, represented by the subset in the right-hand set of table 1, where the transformation of energy from one form to another incurs "entropic cost." But, to caution, not all costs of production/con- sumption resemble "entropic cost." Table 1.

Georgescu-Roegen observed the transformation of heat into work through the exploitation of temperature potential by the Carnot cycle as illustrated by the steam engine: All steam engines must ... work in cycles between a hotter and a colder temper- ature. In general, we can obtain work only from a source that involves a differ- ence of temperature, of electrical or chemical potential. Only such energy is available (useful) to us as humans, homogenous energy is unavailable (useless) to us. (1992, 148) However, he immediately confused such a Carnot transformation and its inefficiency or entropic waste with the everyday cost of production/consumption activity as intuitively understood by cost accountants and economists:17 "These fundamental thermodynamic concepts are clearly anthropomorphic" (1992, 148). Through the depiction of the steam engine or the Carnot cycle as human bound, Georgescu-Roegen smuggled in the entropic waste of the steam engine transformation as the general case of all costs of production/consumption: "[T]hermodynamics is in essence a physics of economic value," and the "root ... of economic value ... lies in the entropic degradation of energy and of matter in bulk" (1992, 147, 148). It is true that the human economy is constrained by the entropy law-as manifested by the waste generated by the Carnot-like transformations in the utility industry and the expenses incurred by heat pumps (refrigeration). However, such a constraint is no differ- ent analytically from transportation costs which, in part, arise from friction resistance and gravitational force. If one would like to conceive the entropy law as more than a fence surrounding the human economy, why not also establish frictional or gravita- tional laws of the economy? The inefficiency of the heat engine and the cost of the heat pump form a small, although important, subset of the total cost of production. As argued below, the other types of cost cannot, even indirectly, be explained by the entropy law. The steam engine and other mechanisms, such as physiological metabolism, start with a chemical potential, the basis for the production of incoherent energy, what physi- cists call "heat." In turn, as it moves as a result of temperature gradient, the heat is exploited in order to obtain coherent energy, i.e., what physicists call "work" or what thermodynamicians call "free energy." The term "free" should not mislead economists into thinking that the cost of production of coherent energy is zero. It is "free" in the sense of what one is able to extract from nature beyond production cost. The term "production cost" is narrowly used here to denote such out-of-pocket cost in the classical Ricardian/Marxian sense. Since the focus here is not on the anthropo- centric decision-making criterion such as optimization but rather on the ecosystem flux of matter/energy, it is more appropriate to use concepts such as "production cost" rather than "opportunity cost." 18</page><page sequence="12">212 Elias L. Khalil In contrast, the term "entropic cost" has a different origin. The extraction of work in the sense of coherent energy involves unavoidable "entropic cost," i.e., the inevitable loss of some incoherent energy to a colder sink for reasons unrelated to friction (Khalil 1990b, 168-171). As a result, the entropy of the source-and-sink as a whole increases-but along with the production of coherent free energy, viz., work. The net rise of entropy (which could be imprecisely expressed as the loss of some heat to the sink) is certainly inefficient from the perspective of lost opportunity. It is nonetheless unavoid- able. As stipulated by the second law, heat flows only (because it is the most probable macroscopic phenomenon) from hotter to colder bodies. Put simply, in order to harness heat and transform it into work, the agent must let it flow from the hotter source to the colder sink. Some of the flow has to be foregone to the colder sink in order to keep the heat flowing, and in the process to keep allowing the agent to "steal" a portion of the flow by transforming it into work. If the agent planned to harness 100 percent of the flow, there would be no flow because there would be no sink for heat to flow toward. 19 Thus, in order to reap energy from nature, the agent has to allow a minimum amount of energy-specified by the temperature gradient between the source and the sink-to escape back to the environment. The basic lesson is that it is a theoretical impossibility for the actor to claim all the energy. Similar to A. G. Williamson's (1993, 70) illustration, table 2 shows the spontane- ous (what thermodynamicians call "natural") movement or absorption of thermal, inco- herent energy Qi from the initial state (source) at a high temperature Th to the final state (sink) at a colder temperature TC.20 The spontaneous flow of heat is "preyed upon" by the purposive agent in the first stage of production. The agent applies a Carnot-like mechanism in order to "steal" coherent energy, that is, work (w), whose maximum level in the ideal (reversible) cycle equals w(max) = Qi(Th- Tc)/Th (3)21 Table 2.

A portion of Qi has to be allowed to escape to a sink; otherwise, the production of w would not take place. That is, w=Ql-Q2, (4) where Q2 is the amount allowed to escape. Thus, the efficiency (e) of the Carnot cycle, e = w/Qi, (5) must always be less than 100 percent even for the reversible cycle. Or, in light of equation (3), the efficiency of the ideal cycle is a function of the temperature potential, e = (Th-Tc)/Th (6) From the standpoint of the first law of thermodynamics (conservation law), the agent's second stage production/consumption process is depicted by table 3.22 As table 3 sketches, the second stage involves the expenditure of work in order to construct mat- ter/energy into output useful from the point of view of the agent. The process is nonspontaneous, or what some thermodynamicians call "non-natural" (Williamson 1993). Such a construction cannot meet the specific needs of the agent without his/her intervention. In comparison, table 2 shows spontaneous change in the sense that the heat flows from source to sink and the initial state changes into a final state without the agent's intervention-although the agent does intervene in order to extract w from such a spontaneous flow. Table 3 depicts the nonspontaneous process, where purposive exer- tion of w is needed to effectuate the change from an initial to a final state. Following the conservation law, the nonspontaneous production/consumption process could be expressed as wi + RMj = Ok+Q (7)23 Table 3. Expenditure of Coherent Energy (Work) Nonspontaneous Process (Production/Consumption of Useful Effects) Initial State &gt; Final State (matter/energy input) T (Output and heat) Work Expenditure</page><page sequence="14">214 Elias L. Khalil where RM is raw material input at level i, ok output at level k, and Qi incoherent heat. Since matter cannot be reduced to a common substance, the inputs and outputs can be measured via a composite unit made up of all the relevant products. Given a measure- ment unit, the inputs and outputs are at specific levels, viz., i, j, k, 1, which are specified by the production function. To note, while wi is the origin of the by-product of incoherent heat, Ql, not all of expended wi is necessarily transformed into Qi. Also, a portion of RM might release some incoherent energy. Such a representation of matter/energy flow is a simplification. It hopefully cap- tures the relationship between the entropy law and what is commonly called production cost. In equation (7), output can be partially recycled back as RM, while the rest is ejected to the environment either during production/consumption as by-product waste such as packaging or, at the end of production/consumption, as end-product waste such as exhausted buildings and automobiles. In equation (7), the degradation of work (which could be partial) in the second stage of production, w -X Q, as a result mainly of friction, may raise the entropy of the environment. But such a rise of entropy is only a consequence of friction and other vari- ables such as gravity and diffusion of current densities. The rise of entropy is not the result of the entropy law strictly understood as the outcome of microscopic fluctuation. This rise is similar to the rise of entropy as a consequence of the joint chemical reactions behind the breakdown of tree leaves. These processes are "downhill" in the sense there is no Carnot inefficiency (e &lt; 100 percent) as we witnessed in the first stage of produc- tion, i.e., the extraction of w from Ql, Q, -X w. But "downhill" does not mean the pro- cess is spontaneous; it is downhill only in relation to energy transformation from coherence to incoherence. While the second stage of production involves downhill energy transformation, it presupposes purposive, nonspontaneous action of agents, ranging from unicellular to multicellular organisms, in order to transform matter into a more useful output. Can we conceive the everyday costs of production/consumption, i.e., w, a la con- ception of the ineluctable wasted thermal energy that is allowed to escape to the sink in the Carnot-like transformation? To start, the steam engine and other transformations of the uphill kind, viz., Qi -o w, consist of one subset of production/consumption activi- ties in general (see table 1). It is the first stage needed to produce coherent free energy, w. The second stage involves the application of the "stolen" w to construct/consume pro- teins at the cellular level or to construct/consume nests, webs, tunnels, clothes, high- ways, tools, and buildings at the social level. The cost of the first stage or subset of production/consumption-ignoring the production cost of maintaining the heat engine-mainly consists of the lost opportunity of escaped heat via the sink. The escaped heat is necessitated by the entropy law and, hence, the lost opportunity can be reasoned on the basis of the entropy law. In contrast, the cost of the second stage of production/ consumption, viz., the expenditure of coherent energy, is not necessitated by the entropy law but rather by production activity constrained by the law of conservation.</page><page sequence="15">The Three Laws of Thermodynamics and the Theory of Production 215 It is true that the second stage of activity engenders ex post greater entropy as work turns into dissipated heat. But the expenditure of labor effort itself is not technologi- cally called for by the entropy law. In addition, the metabolism which underpins effort expenditure amounts to the transformation of chemical energy into kinetic energy-a transformation which involves entropy production but is not explained by the entropy law. The expenditure of effort, which admittedly causes entropy to rise, is not occa- sioned by microscopic fluctuation-i.e., is not premised on the spontaneous dissipation of available energy-and therefore is not expressive of the entropy law. The expenditure of work simply does not involve microscopic stochastic interaction which presupposes or explains the expenditure itself. While the point is obvious and may not be denied by Georgescu-Roegen, it needs stressing. Given the preference function or consumer demand, production cost or effort expenditure is not related even indirectly to the entropy law. So it is misleading to enter the theory of production via the gate of the entropy law. The rise of a system's entropy as a result of the downhill vanishing of work into heat is simply a consequence or a by-product. The entropy law cannot be the explaining item (explanans) while production cost is the explained phenomenon (explanandum).24 While production cost ex post raises net entropy, it is expended to counter surface friction, gravitational force, air resistance, chemical reaction, and a host of other variables. In fact, the expenditure of production cost (PC) expresses the first law rather than the second law of thermodynamics. In contrast, the inefficiency associated with the Carnot-like transformation of heat into work is the testimony of the second law. In this case, the entropy law is the explain- ing item (explanans) while the loss of heat to the sink is the explained phenomenon (explanandum). The loss of heat amounts to a loss of opportunity rather than an actual expenditure of effort. Thus, it is justifiable to distinguish that cost by dubbing it "entropic cost" (EC). Given that a measurement unit is found, which could be taken here in matter/ energy units, the difference between EC and PC could be clarified further. EC is the dif- ference between the incoherent energy (IE) input and the coherent free energy (FE) product. EC = IE-FE (8) The incoherent input, IE, ends up (following the first law), as EC and as FE, whereas FE is nothing other than w. EC would be zero only in an imaginary, 100 percent efficient Carnot cycle. In contrast, in order to obtain surplus (S) needed for current or future consump- tion, it is necessary to work, i.e., apply FE to produce output, 0. But FE or w is nothing other than PC-remembering that there is nothing free about "free energy," FE. Of course, FE or PC does not need to be expended in the current period; it could be stored for future production as in the case of storing electricity. When FE or PC is expended</page><page sequence="16">216 Elias L. Khalil following the accounting method, PC expresses the difference between produced or attained output and surplus, measured in matter/energy units: PC = O-S (9) A portion of total output is, as a truism, set aside to compensate PC, and another portion ends up as S-where the S is either currently enjoyed or invested for future enjoyments. The confusion between PC and EC is the nucleus of Georgescu-Roegen's ground- ing of production on the entropy law. It is true that EC and PC engender greater entropy: As shown in table 2, the extraction of work entails greater entropy, and, as shown in table 3, the expenditure of work (i.e., w vanishes into incoherent heat) also means greater entropy. However, the entropy change which allows the extraction of work is necessitated by the spontaneous change dictated by the entropy law itself. In contrast, the entropy change occasioned by the expenditure of work is a by-product of the nonspontaneous process of production/consumption. To satisfy human tastes, EC and PC have to be incurred. While both costs engen- der higher entropy, it is only EC which occurs because of the entropy law. The expendi- ture of PC is called for because of other technologicalphysical limitations. While the absence of the entropy law would entail zero EC, there would still be a need for effort expenditure to facilitate the processing of matter. The degradation of matter is not, therefore, explainable by the entropy law. Given that EC and PC increase entropy, it might be appropriate to overlook the dif- ference between them if the focus is on the level of the ecosystem and its irreversible transformation. However, the difference between PC and EC should be highlighted if the focus is on the level of production. Georgescu-Roegen confused the two levels of analysis. He examined the level of the ecosystem and its irreversible degradation and consequently derived a lesson with regard to the economic scarcity problem facing pro- duction. He claimed that if there is no entropy law, there would be no economic prob- lem of scarcity, i.e., PC would not exist because there would be indefinite, 100 percent recycling of the same quantity of energy and matter: Most important for the student of economics is the point that the Entropy Law is the taproot of economic scarcity. Were it not for this law, we could use the energy of a piece of coal over and over again, by transforming it into heat, the heat into work, and the work back into heat. Also, engines, homes, and even living organisms (if they could exist at all) would never wear out. There would be no economic difference between material goods and Ricardian land. In such an imaginary, purely mechanical world, there would be no true scarcity of energy and materials. A population as large as the space of our globe would allow could live indeed forever. An increase in the real income per capita could be supported in part by a greater velocity of use (just as in the case of money cir-</page><page sequence="17">The Three Laws of Thermodynamics and the Theory of Production 217 culation) and in part by additional mining. But there would be no reason for any real struggle, whether intra-species or inter-species, to arise. (1976, 9) However, if we imagine a world free from the entropy law, the economic problem would not vanish. There would still be a need to search and process matter, and even energy, because the gifts of nature are not offered in forms ready for consumption. Other than accounting for the inefficiency of the Carnot cycle, the entropy law can- not be the basis of production theory. Even with zero EC and an imaginary entropy-free world, PC is not zero. Georgescu-Roegen's paradigm, in effect, disregards PC or makes it a derivative of EC. Once PC and EC are distinguished, the entropy law would be marginalized. The Technological/Institutional Regime as Fund Georgescu-Roegen's "fourth law of thermodynamics," or "material entropy," is a grave conceptual mix-up. Nonetheless, it contains a vein of truth that can be salvaged. Namely, if we replace the concept of "material entropy" with "material waste," Georgescu-Roegen's "fourth law" would begin to make sense. In this regard, Georgescu-Roegen's thesis would have nothing to do with some imminent march of matter to deteriorate on its own according to a law similar to the second law of entropy. Rather, the deterioration would be directly the result of production of waste and hence related to purposeful agency of production. In this manner, Georgescu-Roegen's "fourth law" can be re-stated: Material waste is irrevocable in the sense that even in a closed system (i.e., open only to energy influx), the inflow of energy cannot fully recover the degraded matter into useful form, i.e., full recycling is impossible. Georgescu-Roegen expressed the theoretical impossibility of full recycling as the impossibility of having a machine in "perpetual motion of the third kind."25 That is, it is impossible to have a machine in a closed system which is able, as a result of full recycling material waste, to reproduce goods at a steady, zero-growth scale forever in historical time. Consequently, Georgescu-Roegen is critical of the ecological "green" agenda behind the energetic dogma. The ecological energetic agenda postulates the possibility, if production is tuned properly, of everlasting sustainable reproduction at zero-growth 26 level. As Mayumi (1993, 353) argued, however, Georgescu-Roegen's "forever" reproduc- tion by the machine of the third kind treats time in a historical sense, while the thermo- dynamics concept of "infinite" time-needed in order to model finite movement in quasi-static adjustments-treats time in an analytical sense. Of more importance, the boundary between Georgescu-Roegen's closed system containing the machine of the third kind and its environment is ambiguous. Once defined, the Carnot engine could produce coherent energy (work) forever if the temperature of the source is higher than the sink's. Georgescu-Roegen would concede this. But if the concern is with the produc- tion of material output rather than work, Georgescu-Roegen could still maintain that</page><page sequence="18">218 Elias L. Khalil the machine of the third kind would need influx of matter, which is impossible in a closed system. However, as long as the system receives appropriate energy from the outside, it is possible for the expenditure of work to separate matter and make it more useful (Bianciardi, Tiezzi, and Ulgiati 1993). This is exactly achieved, inter alios, by photosyn- thesis, where oxidized carbon is separated from the air by green plants with the aid of solar energy. As long as there is an adequate influx of energy, it is possible, from the theo- retical standpoint, to achieve complete recycling of matter. Agents may not try to achieve complete recycling because it is simply cheaper to excavate fresh inputs than to recycle waste. The hurdle, that is, does not arise from theoretical impossibility but rather arises from practical considerations. Interestingly, though, the impossibility thesis, i.e., the rising difficulty of produc- tion as matter becomes more dispersed, is analogous to the third law of thermodynam- ics. One consequence of the third law is that it becomes harder to lower the temperature of a system as the temperature approaches absolute zero (Kelvin scale).27 Absolute zero is equal to (-459) Fahrenheit or (-273) Centigrade. At absolute zero the atom freezes in the sense that it does not have any kinetic energy. Analogous to the lowering of tempera- ture, the collection of matter becomes harder as a result of greater dispersion. This is similar to the increasing difficulty of finding and collecting the same amount of beads from a sand box as the box size increases. To warn, though, the analogy of the impossi- bility of full recycling with the third law need not intimate an overarching general law of nature. The analogy can be simply for illustrative purposes (Khalil 2000). It would still be interesting to investigate empirically how the dispersion of material resources, and the consequent difficulty of production, creates new challenges. The chanllenges may instigate innovation and the evolution of the production process. Stated differently, while it is true that resource dispersion cannot be axiomatic as a phys- ical law, one can still study how resource degradation, difficulty of recycling, and inno- vation are connected to the technological/institutional agent undertaking production activity (Khalil 1995a, 1997). The question of the degree of recycling cannot be discussed in abstraction from the acting technological/institutional regime of production. Resources cannot be couched in an entropy-like objective magnitude such as "finite mineral dowry of our abode" (Georgescu-Roegen 1992, 147). Resources are useful insofar as they are defined in rela- tion to the particular agent characterized by the acting technologicaVinstitutional regime of production. One would not need to resort to the entropy law once resources are conceived as regime-specific and once production cost is seen mainly as the outcome of the law of conservation (see Young 1991). The irrelevance of the entropy law, at least at first princi- ples, does not invalidate Georgescu-Roegen's insight about the deficiency of the "green" energetic dogma-although the insight has to be defended on empirical rather than the- oretical grounds. The idea that full recycling is impossible on practical grounds may</page><page sequence="19">The Three Laws of Thermodynamics and the Theory of Production 219 shed light on the economy-environment interaction as undergoing an irrevocable pro- cess of change. The idea of irrevocable change, once emancipated from the entropy lexi- con, means that the physical environment cannot be kept in a steady state. Conclusion It was my intention to distinguish between entropy arising from the entropy law, on one hand, and waste (some of which might be measured in terms of entropy) arising from consumption/production on the other. The failure to delineate the two has led a few economists to think that the economic process can be basically captured by the entropy law. The concept of entropy might, at best, be relevant for measuring the degra- dation of matter or the rise of waste as argued by Reiner Kummel (1989) and oth- ers-irrespective of whether it was brought about by the entropy law or instigated by human production/consumption. However, this does not mean that the economic pro- cess is governed by the entropy law. The paper advanced this point on the basis of three distinctions: First, there is a dif- ference between the dissipation of available energy 'a la entropy law, on one hand, and the diffusion of matter arising from soil erosion and friction in general on the other. Second, there is a distinction between the latter and the instigated dispersion of resources brought about by the purposive agent. Third, there is a demarcation between the latter and the dispersion occasioned by the Carnot-like transformation of incoher- ent energy (i.e., heat) into coherent free energy (i.e., work). Georgescu-Roegen failed to make the three distinctions: First, he lumped the subset of dissipation a la entropy law with the general set of diffusion of matter. Second, he conflated the latter with the exclu- sive set of consumption-instigated dispersion of resources. Third, he grouped the latter with the subset of production-instigated dispersion of resources occasioned by Carnot-like transformation. Therefore, Georgescu-Roegen's attempt to ground the impossibility of full recy- cling on a law of nature is flawed. If empirical observations show the difficulty of full recycling, it would not entail a confirmation of Georgescu-Roegen's "fourth law." Such observations should instead pose questions about the evolution of institutions and tech- nology in the face of ongoing struggle against the stream of depleting environmental resources. These questions emerge when we start thinking about the technologicaV institutional regime of production as a fund which offers services and, corollary, viewing resources as dependent on that regime of production. As such, the economic process is not a passive victim of the march of entropy. The living process of the economy should not make us helpless, arrested by the hypothesis of inevitable environmental degradation, where all we can do is try to slow down the arrival date of doomsday. Rather, insofar as resources are formulated by the regime of production, there are payoffs from the refinement of the tools of technology, the enhancement of the effectiveness of economic organization, and the adoption of appro-</page><page sequence="20">220 Elias L. Khalil priate policies. Such undertakings exploit the extent to which a particular regime can handle challenges and can generate appropriate innovations. Notes 1. The usage of the term "resource" is not restricted to the stocks of minerals in the earth's crust. It includes the environment in its capacity as a fund-i.e., insofar as being unclogged by pollut- ants and capable of assisting the recycling of factors that enter into the renewability of non-exhaustible resources. 2. To clarify the standard lexicon employed here, an "isolated" system is one which is insulated from matter and energy influx and outflux; a "closed" system is one which is insulated only from matter influx and outflux; and an "open" system is one which exchanges matter and energy with the surrounding system. 3. There is some similarity, although of the superficial kind, between the concept of equilibrium in thermodynamics and the idea of equilibrium in economics (see Mirowski 1988a and 1988b). In thermodynamics, once two isolated different gases are connected, they reach (from the macroscopic viewpoint) maximum mixture through the incessant, stochastic motion of molecules at the micro level. Besides being stable, the equilibrium mixture is unique since entropy is maximum under the given conditions. Neoclassical economics also employs the ideas of stability and uniqueness in order to characterize market equilibrium. However, the standard models of market equilibrium do not permit incessant fluctuation of agents at the micro level. In fact, in market equilibrium agents are supposed to have exhausted any desire to trade at the reigning system of prices. 4. Heinz Kurz and Neri Salvadori (2003) provided, from the Sraffian framework, a critique of Georgescu.Roegen's concept of funds. They argued that the Sraffian treatment of fixed capital as circulating capital within the joint-product framework can take care of the depreciation as well as the problem of capital utilization. But Georgescu-Roegen's main concern is that pro- duction depends not only on stocks but also on funds that prevent the speeding of production at will. 5. Prigogine's work (1980) can be seen as a reformulation of Schr6dinger's (1944) thesis that life is "anti-entropy" in the sense that the organism is an orderly entity, counter to the increase of disorder in the universe. However, is it proper to discuss the organized matter of the organism in the same way one discusses the orderly matter of ice in comparison to liquid? I think we need another conceptual apparatus to account for the living organism, which falls outside the scope of the paper. 6. The difference between the study of nonlinear dynamics and production activity carried out by purposeful organization is detailed elsewhere (Khalil 1990a). 7. Other extensions of the entropy law by economists, who distance themselves differently from Georgescu-Roegen's agenda, include, inter alios, John Gowdy (1984), Robert Ayres and Indira Nair (1984), Malte Faber andJohn Proops (1985 and 1990), passim W. van Gool and J. Bruggink (1985), Richard Chase (1985), James Swaney (1985), Malte Faber et al. (1987), John Proops (1987), Joseph Vogel (1988), Richard Norgaard (1984a, 1984b, and 1989), Martin O'Connor (1989 and 1991), Tran Huu Dung (1992), Matthias Ruth (1993), and Mathias Binswanger (1993). An early reference to the grounding of economics on the entropy law (which I owe to Barkley Rosser) is Julius Davidson (1919). 8. For more expository purposes, see Khalil 1990b; cf. Lozada 1991; Williamson 1993; Bianciardi, Donati, and Ulgiati 1993; and Khalil 1991 and 1994b. 9. Martin O'Connor (1991, 101-104) leveled a useful critique of Faber et al. for misusing the concept of entropy change in two senses. First, they implicitly took entropy as an indicator of whether the economic society is producing goods and pollutants in a synchronized manner</page><page sequence="21">The Three Laws of Thermodynamics and the Theory of Production 221 with the fully recycled resources by the environment. In this sense, a well-balanced, steady-state production of zero growth a la Herman Daly (1979) could be characterized by a constant level of entropy. Second, they took entropy as a measure of the dispersion of resources occasioned by production. O'Connor argued that this is a defective and inconclu- sive basis on which to measure waste generation and disposal impacts either qualitatively or quantitatively-as discussed further below. 10. This is equivalent to the comparative statistics method used in general equilibrium theory. 11. In order to satisfy Boltzmann Law, i.e., for each molecule to have equal probability at occupy- ing any location in the system, the gas is assumed to be ideal (see Atkins 1984). The molecules of actual gases are constrained by space-time hurdles, like viscosity, which prevent the gas from attaining equilibrium instantaneously. 12. Given such a statistical definition of entropy, the arrow of time or the notion of irreversibility in physics cannot be grounded, contrary to Georgescu-Roegen's desire, on the entropy law (see Raju 1994). The fact that all isolated systems observed so far move toward equilibrium (maximum entropy given the constraints) does not exclude the theoretical probability of motion in the opposite direction. The movement toward equilibrium is simply a statistical rather than a theoretical proposition. 13. Paul Atkins (1984, chap. 4) provided a crisp and intuitive explanation of the relation between the tendency toward the dissipation of available energy (equilibration) and entropy (micro- scopic disorder) (see Khalil 1990b, 165-168). 14. Wicken (1987) emphasized the micro-macro distinction in relation to another problem. Namely, he fruitfully distinguished between the entropy law, on one side, and information theory of Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver (1949) on the other. Although Shannon and Weaver used the term "entropy" to measure information content of a message, information theory is not based on the micro-macro distinction that is so crucial for the entropy law. 15. Georgescu-Roegen (1971, chap. 6) intensely rejected Boltzmann's statistical representation of the law of entropy on the basis that it is mechanistic, i.e., non-purposeful or non-teleological. Georgescu-Roegen rather favored the formulation of classical thermodynamics. To note, his critique of Boltzmann's formulation differs from the earlier noted stipulation that Boltzmann's interpretation involves ideal gases (i.e., atomistic) in isolated systems. The atomistic representation cannot provide an explanation of self-feeding, nonergodic dynam- ics-which is not an issue related to the fundamental issue of production, i.e., the man-envi- ronment metabolism. Georgescu-Roegen's critique of Boltzmann's interpretation as mechanistic does not stem from the concern for self-feeding dynamics. Rather, it stems from the belief that the entropy law is not statistical but endemic of the cosmos as a teleological sys- tem. Georgescu-Roegen's view of the entropy law (which follows classical thermodynamics) as a non-mechanistic, teleological law is the crux of Georgescu-Roegen's paradigm. Georgescu-Roegen strongly argued that the tendency of an isolated system to reach equilib- rium and for entropy to rise to its maximum, is an irrevocable process, i.e., a theoretical inevi- tability rather than the result of a high probability a la Boltzmann. However, as argued elsewhere (Khalil 1993, 29-30), the make-up of the entropy law is as mechanistic as Boyle's law (which states that for a body of ideal gas at constant temperature the volume is inversely proportional to the pressure). The fact that the second law includes time as a variable, which distinguishes earlier from later states, does not deny its mechanistic nature. Newton's laws, the epitome of the mechanistic approach, could also accommodate the time variable. 16. Following Alfred Lotka's (1945) lexicon, endosomatic tools consist of devices attached to the organism like claws, wings, teeth, and so on. In contrast, exosomatic tools (which are not restricted to humans) are detached from the body like sticks, arrows, and computers. 17. In this context, see D. H. Judson (1989) for relating, not without the problem of unified mea- surement, the Ricardian theory of value and the energetic theory of value. 18. Needless to say, if out-of-pocket cost is expended optimally, production cost would equal opportunity cost. However, the concept "opportunity cost" is not mentioned here because</page><page sequence="22">222 Elias L. Khalil the concern is with ex post ecocentric energy flows, not ex ante anthropocentric optimization decision criterion. This should not mean they are inconsistent. While energy flow account- ing, called "net energy analysis," has been advocated by Robert Costanza (1980; cf. Berndt 1985) to replace the familiar opportunity cost concept, the opportunity cost concept could accommodate net energy analysis with some modifications as argued by David Huettner (1976). In any case, for the purpose of identifying how entropy law relates to production cost, it is more useful to define production cost as simply consisting of energy flows or actual expenditures. 19. The heat engine analogously resembles the inherent inefficiency of the all.too-familiar vac- uum cleaner. While vacuum cleaners could have different rates of efficiency, none could attain full efficiency. The dirt that is sucked up by the air cannot be totally retained by the fil- ter-irrespective of whether the filter is a bag, a basin of water, or a screen. Some of the dirt inevitably is ejected back into the surroundings because, in order to retain suction power, the filter has to be porous enough to allow particles of air to exit. Inescapably, the pores also per- mit the smallest specks of dirt to escape with the exiting air. In order to attain a fully efficient vacuum cleaner, one would have to block completely all the pores. Albeit, this would also block the exit of air, which would engender the loss of suction power-reminiscent of the dilemma of the heat engine. 20. I prefer the term "spontaneous" to natural," which is more commonly used in the physical chemistry literature. The opposite of the word "natural," i.e., "unnatural," denotes the change of states, from initial to final, by purposive agency in comparison to the spontaneous flow of heat. But such purposive process is part of nature. Thus, the terminology "naturaVunnatural" may convey the wrong impression that purposive action by organisms (including humans) is not part of nature. 21. We cannot attain the maximum w in real (irreversible) Carnot transformations. 22. The table is the outcome of clarifications proposed by A. G. Williamson in private correspondence. 23. While equation (7) represent flows, the role of funds such as capital tools and the agent's social and endosomatic organization and institutions are implied by the purposive, everyday expenditure of cost w. 24. Actual, accounting cost is certainly not a simple idea. But the purpose here is not to develop a theory of value. Rather, the aim is to show the relevance of the cost imposed by the entropy law as opposed to the out-of-pocket, accounting cost of actual effort expenditure. 25. It is a machine of the "third" kind in order to distinguish it from the impossible machine of the first kind, which violates the first law of thermodynamics, and the impossible machine of the second kind, which violates the second law of thermodynamics. 26. Such an agenda is epitomized by, inter alios, the concept of "steady-state economy" offered by the model of Herman Daly (1979) and by the model of Faber et al. (1987), discussed above, of well-synchronized four sectors of resource extraction, pollution control, recycling by humans of waste products, and recycling by the environment. 27. According to the third law also, as temperature goes to zero, the entropy S approaches a con- stant SO. Furthermore, the third law stipulates that the entropy of a pure, perfectly crystalline substance is zero if the absolute temperature is zero. References Allen, P. M.
