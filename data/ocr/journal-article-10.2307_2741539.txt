<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Implications of the Paleolithic Symbolic Evidence for the Origin of Language' by ALEXANDER MARSHACK Peabody Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. 02138, U.S.A. 22 XII 75 [The following article bears on the subject matter of Jonas and Jonas's "Gender Differences in Mental Function: A Clue to the Origin of Language" (CA 16:626-30). It is scheduled for a pre- vious appearance in the American Scientist (March 1976) and will also appear in the proceedings of the New York Academy of Sci- ences Conference on Origins and Evolution of Language and Speech, September 22-25, 1975. It is republished here, with the permission of the Academy and the American Scientist, in accordance with CA's policy to reprint, either in the original or in translation, articles whose original publication would not have reached the international audience represented by Associates.--EDITOR.] In this introductory paper I shall present some new analytic data and a few theoretical considerations and interpretations based on the data which may be relevant to an understanding of the evolved human capacity for symbol-making and lan- guage. Based largely on the tool industries and on the occasional hu- man skeletal material excavated during the last century, the European Paleolithic of the last 400-500,000 years has been di- vided into three stages or periods: an early or Acheulian with indications of the presence of nearly modern man (Swans- combe), a middle or Mousterian during which Neanderthal man lived, and a late or Upper Paleolithic when Neanderthal was gone and a number of fully modern Homo sapiens types ap- peared. I shall present symbolic materials from each of the periods with an analysis of the cognitive and linguistic problems they pose. In 1931 a collection of animal statuettes and one crude an- thropomorphic figure were found at the small cave site of Vogelherd in south Germany (Riek 1932-33). They represent the most important group of symbolic artifacts made by early Cro-Magnon man. The Middle Aurignacian level at Vogel- herd in which one set of these statuettes was found has been carbon-dated recently at c. 30,000 B.C., which is exceedingly close to the Mousterian ending at c. 35,000 B.C. In the forty- five years since these statuettes had been excavated and pub- lished, they had been locked in a bank and had been unavail- able for study. The following descriptions are based on the first analyses of these figures that have been permitted?

Analysis of this horse and the other animal statuettes from Vogelherd indicates that they are out of place in all the standard chronologies of styles of rendering animal images which begin with an assumption that the first animal images were crude outlines. In looking at the statuette, we see an animal and a horse. Because of this obvious recognition, animal images of the Upper Paleolithic were long termed aspects of "hunting magic." The concept was supported by the heavily weighted nature of the Paleolithic archeological evidence consisting of tools and animal bones and by generalizations about "primitive" human be- havior in anthropological theories of the first half of this cen- tury. Let us approach the image analytically, not as the "horse" we recognize but merely as a human artifact, a symbolic prod- uct which had a manufacture and use at the very beginning of the modern period. Microscopic examination of the statuette revealed that eye, ear, nose, mouth, and mane had been carefully carved but that these had been worn down by long handling and perhaps by carrying in a pouch. Ithe length of time required for such wear on ivory might be a number of years. The microscope also revealed that at one point in the use of the horse an angle that was still fresh had been cut into the shoulder representing a late use of the horse, perhaps as part of a symbolic "killing," though for what purpose is not known. The horse had obviously not been made to be killed for success in a hunt but had been kept and used and then at some point had a differentiated, specialized use. Every one of the Vogelherd images, including the 'crude human figure, had evidence either of long-term use or of an applied symbolic marking. Figure 2 is the anthropomorphic image, crudely and hastily carved, perhaps feminine with two rough breast marks. It con- tains three sets of marks on the body, made by different tools a FIG. 2. a, crude anthropomorphic figure from Vogelherd, Germany, c. 32,000 B.C., with three sets of marks made by different tools and types of stroke, suggesting a periodic symbolic marking. b, detail of the marks on the anthropomorph, indicating the different en- graving points and types of stroke. Animal statues from Vogelherd were similarly "used" by being periodically marked. marking different types of strokes. This quite clearly represents a use of the image, but whether for a killing, a curing, a birth, or as an act of participation or supplication is not clear. From an Aurignacian level at La Ferrassie in France come sets of carved vulvas with the same type of overmarking. The technique of using images by symbolic overmarking persists for 20,000 years to the end of the Upper Paleolithic. A decade of research has shown that Upper Paleolithic im- ages were often used and reused and that any image could be used in a number of different ways and contexts (Marshack 1969). Among such uses was the association of a primary image with a library of subsidiary motifs and symbols. The animal or human images we recognize were, therefore, almost never merely representational or reportorial; they were symbols made for use in a variety of cultural contexts. Another Vogelherd statuette will clarify the problem. Figure 3 illustrates the fragment of a horse or reindeer marked "un- - ~~~~~~~~t FiG~~.3. a, frgmn of an anml figure.. . fro VoEled Germany The . moi iniae tha thi was no aanml mad tob:_le _gin hutn maic bu ersne ybl i:: th utr. b, th C. sceai redto of th marin on th sttete Ths iS--s the earliestknown "decorative" motif associated with an a l i - sL | | ~~~~~~~~i X Al. - I,:- t L: Z-- c-Z l-x U: C~~~~~~~~~ -. | ~~-7/l Fso. 3. a, fragment o an animal figure frm Vogeiherd, Germany earIest3 know "dagecortie moiosscaedwt an animal imarfomVge.hr,Gray Vol. 17 N No. 2 J 3une 1976 275</page><page sequence="3">realistically" with a motif of multiple zigzags, multiple arcs, and many small strokes. The statuette is dated at about 29,000 B.c. and is slightly later than the horse of figure 1, making it the earliest known "decorated" animal image of Homo sapiens. ,Clearly the overengraved motif is not a trap, a hut, or a male or female sex sign, to mention some of the traditional interpre- tations of the many motifs that are associated with animals. Geometric patterns associated with animals are found through- out the full Upper Paleolithic and have posed persistent prob- lems for interpretation. They are currently under intensive in- vestigation. The multiple zigzag and the multiple arc show up later both east and west of Vogelherd as decorative motifs, first in the East European Upper Paleolithic and then in the French Magdalenian. I am not at this point interested in their meaning or dispersion but rather in their use with a recognizable image as an aspect of the earliest Homo sapiens symbolism. One class of symbol is used with another class as part of a complex, in- terrelated tradition of usage. This, of course, is the way in which diverse symbol systems are used today. In 1891, at the site of Cro-Magnon in Les Eyzies, France, where the first Cro-Magnon skeletons were found, there was excavated a reindeer rib with a crudely engraved anthropo- morph overmarked with a zigzag motif (fig. 4). Significantly, it was published without the zigzag overmarking since this was considered distracting and meaningless (Riviere 1897: fig. 2). The zigzags, however, represent a significant aspect of the image's use. again one class of symbol used with another. I have already published evidence for the presence of a sys- tem of sequential, cumulative notation in this period, the Auri- gnacian of the early Upper Paleolithic (Marshack 1970, 1972a, b, c, 1974). In addition, the Aurignacian burials provide a well- known evidence for a use of amulets, pendants, and beads, forms of personal decoration that have been considered hall- marks of Upper Paleolithic symbolism. . Remember, we are here but a single step-about four or five thousand years-from the Mousterian. The questions, then, are obvious: how long would it have taken for diverse symbolic traditions of this complexity to have developed? Could they have evolved rapidly in a few thousand years? What level of language competence would have been required to support such interrelated systems, images, and usages? At what point would that level of linguistic competence have been manifested, since the traditions illustrated here must have developed later? There seems no choice but to look at the Mousterian and at the still earlier near-Homo sapiens of the Acheulian period. The literature on Mousterian symbolism published during the last century was concerned with certain gross aspects of .Neanderthal ritual or ceremonial behavior. This was because the available evidence was composed primarily of Neanderthal burials, animal bones arranged intentionally in a burial or cave, and bits of red ocher occasionally found in habitation sites. It seemed from these artifacts that Neanderthal man used the natural materials around him symbolically-skulls, horns ~~~~ d .... ui.IIIII.-OII FIG. 4.

The image is overmarked with a zigzag motif, indicating that it had been used symbolically. and antlers, mineral colors, stone slabs-but that true art and symbol expressed in the manufacture or alteration of forms had to be assigned to the following Upper Paleolithic cultures and to fully modern man. Discussions of Neanderthal symbolism referred vaguely to the "first" awakening of the religious spirit and to the supposedly "new" Neanderthal awareness of death and the passage of life and time (Blanc 1961). The recent re- search of Lieberman may have constituted an effort to explain this apparent inadequacy in the Neanderthal record (Lieber- man and Crelin 1971). A recent study by S. Binford compared Neanderthal burials with those of the Upper Paleolithic and found a comparative poverty in Mousterian grave goods, sug- gesting a lesser social capacity and stratification (Binford 1968). Solecki published the report of a Mousterian burial on a bed of flowers at Shanidar, leading him to dub his Neanderthalers "the first flower people" (Solecki 1971).2 The sense one gets from these data and interpretations is of a struggling, seminal, almost mute awareness of death and a kind of incipient proto- symbolism. There is, however, accumulating evidence of a different type. H. Martin, in a classic report on the Mousterian site of La Quina in France, published in 1910 the illustrations (fig. 5) of a pendant made from a reindeer phalange (5.0 cm) and another from the canine of a young fox (3.3 cm) which had been frac- tured in the process of boring the tiny hole and had, therefore, according to Martin, been discarded (Martin 1907-10). He also illustrated a bovid shoulder blade engraved by a Neander- thaler with exceedingly fine, long parallel lines, forming a com- position of a type that is found later in the Upper Paleolithic. In 1909 D. Peyrony found a small bone in a Neanderthal burial at La Ferrassie in France (fig. 6) of which he wrote, "[it] con- tains a series of fine intentionally incised marks recalling the notched bones of the Aurignacian. Perhaps it had some mean- ing and was placed intentionally by the side of the corpse" (Capitan and Peyrony 1921). These artifacts were never again mentioned in the profes- sional archaeological literature since they were unique and FIG. 5.

(Reprinted from Martin 1907-10.) 2 After my delivery of the present paper, Leroi-Gourhan (1975) published an analysis of the pollens in the soil of the Shanidar buri- al, identifying at least seven species of flower that had been laid around the corpse, many of which, according to Solecki (1975), have been used in folk medicine within recent or historic times. Whether these flowers were used "medicinally" or whether plants were used as hallucinogens in Mousterian times cannot, of course, be ascertained. But that flowers were used symbolically in con- texts which were related to human processes opens the intriguing possibility that species of flowers or plants may quite early have been used in essentially symbolic curative efforts, with random success occasionally uncovering a potential potency or biological effect. 276 CUR RE NT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="4">i~~~~~~ FIG. 6.

In the early 1970's J. Kozlowski found a non-utilitarian fragment of bone in the Mousterian site of Bacho Kiro, Bul- garia, that had been engraved with a zigzag motif in a most un- usual manner (fig. 7). The microscope revealed that when the ~~~~~~V ?- :S ~~~~~~~~~ a FIG. 7. a, non-utilitarian fragment of bone from the Mousterian pe- riod engraved with a zigzag motif, Bacho Kiro, Bulgaria. b, detail of the zigzag motif, indicating the circular marks of turning in the angles of the zigzag at left. c, schematic rendition reconstructing the sets of zigzags on the Bacho Kiro fragment. maker came to the end of an engraved line in the zigzag at left in fig. 7b, he did not lift his tool to make a joining line in the other direction, but left it on the bone and turned or twisted it, leaving the print of the turning in the corner of each of the angles. It was clear that these were not work or cutting marks but the creation of an intentional zigzag image. In the later Upper Paleolithic the zigzag appears as a ubiqui- tous motif on non-utilitarian fragments, as decoration on tools and "batons de commandement," and in association with ani- mals painted or engraved on cave walls. Figure 8 is a typical Magdalenian zigzag motif from the end of the Upper Paleo- lithic. It was first engraved on a fragment of bone and then symbolically ochered red. In studying the above artifacts the researcher is faced with analytic problems which, supposedly, belong only to the study of the artifacts of Homo sapiens. In the manufacture of a tiny pendant, for instance, clearly one hand did the boring while the other, somehow, held the object steady. But having made the pendant, the Neanderthal artisan now had to provide a string, perhaps of skin, fine enough, about 1 mm wide, to thread the tooth or phalange, a craft skill that would require a two- handed manipulative discrimination, including a visual acuity and a control in the working of a pliant material, that was per- haps finer and more delicate than that required to bore the hole. If, as seems possible, the pendants were part of a cultural tradition, they pose a problem. They were not tools made for practical use or in order to make other tools but were instead part of a sequence and strategy which was "non-adaptive" ex- cept in a cultural context. The engraved artifacts pose an even more intriguing problem since they suggest the presence of a tradition of non-representational symbolic marking that may have required some form of "linguistic" explanation. There is a growing body of Mousterian engraving and carving that will probably alter the nature of the discussion of early symbol use and language. The most important document for our purposes was found by Laszlo Vertes at the Mousterian site of Tata in Hungary more than a decade ago (Vertes 1964). It is the carved and shaped section of a mammoth molar about 41 inches (10.8 cm) long, ovaloid, and big enough to be held comfortably in the hand (fig. 9). It has been carbon-dated at about 50,000 B.C., which would place it in the Middle Mous- terian. In the original Hungarian publication it was poorly illustrated as a grey blob. Actually the surface is the brilliant white of polished enamel or cementum, making it the most sensuous of all Paleolithic mobiliary artifacts both to the touch and eye. Vertes published it as a "churinga" of the type usually made of wood and used ritually in Australia and comparable also to a class of non-utilitarian symbolic plaques made of bone and ivory found in the Upper Paleolithic. At one point in the use of the plaque-and perhaps more than once-it had been ochered red. Such ochering occurs on both the Australian churingas and the Upper Paleolithic plaques. The microscope reveypaldpr nther interestinc data. FIG. 8. Symbolic zigzag motif on a fragment of bone from the Mag- dalenian period, the Grotte de Goyet, Belgium, c. 12,000 B.C.

The lamelle or section came from a mammoth molar, a large, heavy, composite tooth weighing a number of pounds (fig. 10). There is clearly a rough cognitive-visual connection between flakes that are struck from a pebble core and plates sectioned from the tooth. But there is a profound qualitative difference. The materials are different and require other work- ing strategies and sequences. But, more important, in working Paleolithic stone one plans for a functional edge. Here the arti- san planned for a "non-utilitarian," symbolic object. As you can see, the section of tooth was cut and carved and the rear was then bevelled back making a nearly perfect oval (fig. 11). Work of th'is type and quality had not previously been documented for the Mousterian. The microscope also shows that the thin edge of the highly polished face was rounded as though from long handling with no evidence of the original cutting or scraping. Here, then, is evidence for the manufacture of symbolic artifacts intended for long-term, probably periodic use within the Mousterian, 20-30,000 years before the appear- ance of the Aurignacian images which had a comparable cul- tural usage. I should note that the Mousterian skills and strategies in- volved in making the churinga and pendants and in marking the sets and zigzags are similar to those found in the later Upper Paleolithic bone industries.

This is the only example of such skilled, careful workmanship of bone from the Mousterian. small number of symbolic artifacts in the Mousterian record is due, in part, to a use of other materials. If one were to at- tempt to reconstruct the symbolic cQmplexity of the hunting- gathering cultures of the historic period from what remains in the archeological record, one would find the task impossible. Australian symbolic artifacts are largely a perishable "soft- ware," composed of wood, feathers, blood, ocher powders, in- cisions, circumcisions, sand drawings. songs, dances, myths, and so on. Only the rock faces would retain the painted and engraved evidence for a strange symbolism. In like manner, the evidence for American Indian and Eskimo shamanism or periodic group ritual and ceremony would be largely dissolved in any long burial. The fact is, sparse though it may be, there is now evidence for a number of contemporaneous symbol systems in the Mousterian. How far back does such evidence go? I present one rare and, therefore, still tentative example from the period before the Mousterian. In 1969 Frangois Bordes, a leading authority on the Mous- terian cultures, published a report on an engraved ox rib (fig. 12) that he had excavated at the site of Pech de l'Az*, France, in a level that was approximately 300,000 years old, that is, from the Acheulian period of Homo erectus, who was already verging toward being sapiens (Bordes 1969). The man of'this period was already building huts (de Lumley 1969). Bordes de- scribed the rib as the earliest intentional engraving yet ex- cavated (Bordes 1972). A full description of my analysis of the bone and the tradition of which it is a part is now in press (Marshack n.d.). The microscope showed that the image had been made sequentially as a series of connected, festooned double arcs, beginning at left and ending at right with a mul- tiple marking (fig. 12b, c). Precisely this tradition of engraving festooned or serpentine images on non-utilitarian objecta and on cave walls appears later throughout the full 25,000 years of the Upper Paleolithic. It is perhaps the most prevalent motif of the Upper Paleolithic, yet it has not until now been system- atically studied. From the Italian cave site of Romanelli, at the very end of the Paleolithic, c. 8500 B.C., there comes an en- graving of a serpentine meander on a piece of limestone, made by attaching one section to another in the manner of the Pech de l'Az6 engraving (fig. 13). Meander or serpentine marking in this tradition has been found as far as Australia, in the cave of Koonalda, dated at about 20,000 B.C. (Edwards and May- nard 1971). I have refrained from any interpretations of the above images or traditions since I am, at the moment, interested in them only as products of the human capacity for symbolling and in their possible relation to the origins of language.. 278 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="6">a 1 a e FIG. 12. a, engraved rib from an Acheulian level at the site of Pech de l'Aze, France, c. 300,000 B.C. b, detail of the central engraved portion of the rib, indicating the festooned serpentine image. c, schematic rendition of the primary engraved image on the rib with the subsidiary marking of angles and parallel lines. Briefly, I indicate these points: 1. We have evidence that in the Mousterian at least there was a variety of symbol systems. Items such as the pendants and the churinga probably served as markers and referents in culturally structured intragroup relations involving age, sex, rank, and role differentiation and in symbolic group activities such as rituals and ceremonies. These are the ways in which such artifacts have been used in historic times. In addition, images such as the zigzag and the meander may have had a phenomenological reference, documenting awareness of the natural world. Such images, however, were probably used sym- bolically, instead of being mere abstracted representations (Marshack n.d.). The marking or accumulation of sets forms still other systems. Finally, the skill in using tools and in work- ing bone evidenced in the carving of the churinga suggests that it was made by an adult male familiar with some specialized aspect of Mousterian symbolism and was perhaps intended for shamanistic or group use. FIG. 13. a, non-utilitarian limestone pebble with engraved, sym- bolic meander or serpentine image, from the site of Romanelli, Italy, the late Upper Paleolithic, c. 8500 B.C. b, line rendition of the meander image, indicating that it was made intentionally, sec- tion by section, in a tradition that was maintained through the full Upper Paleolithic. No such assumptions of complex, "artificial," cultural struc- tures have been made before for Mousterian daily life. Add to the above artifacts the evidence of ritual burial and the cere- monial arrangements of bones and skulls and one has a picture of a symbolized cultural complexity that was fully sapiens. If there was language, it would have been involved in mark- ing these intragroup relations and activities. Language, in fact, may have been as useful, or more useful, in this cultural realm than in the comparatively self-evident strategies utilized in hunting, butchering, and gathering. 2. The symbolic artifacts document a cognitive capacity and competence for abstraction, modelling, and manufacture of a different order than that which can be deduced from the sub- sistence tool industries. Although this competence involved a use of hands and tools, it is probably allied to linguistic com- petence rather than to tool-making both in an evolutionary sense and in contemporaneous Mousterian usage. It is significant in this regard that where symbolic artifacts are known in the Paleolithic record, they always document aspects of adult tool or material use which are different from those involved in subsistence activities. The complex nature of this difference needs to be explained since it is apparently inti- mately related to linguistic competence. 3. In tool manufacture or in subsistence activities such as digging, gathering, hunting, butchering, or hut building, the strategy sequences are performed visibly and move toward verifiable ends. One gets a cutting edge, a tuber, a shank of meat, a shelter. The skills may require learning and a certain cognitive capacity, but they do not necessarily require a com- Vol. 17 * No. 2 J June 1976 279</page><page sequence="7">plex use of language. Symbolic artifacts, on the other hand, are not validated or explained by their utility in the natural or phenomenological world, even when they are derived from the real world or are directed at it. They are viable only within " artificial" or cultural contexts. In the field of paleoarcheology there has not been, to date, a substantive discussion of the nature of such cultural contexts and certainly not as they may have functioned in hominid evolution. "Culture" has most often been described as those subsistence activities involved in tool-making, hunting, and adaptive problem-solving in the phenomenological world with some discussion of proto-cultural changes in interpersonal rela- tions due to biological changes concerned with sex and matura- tion (Laughlin and d'Aquili 1974, Isaac 1972). The data I am presenting suggest that the capacities evolving in man were far more complex. 4. In the manufacture of a Mousterian symbolic image, one hand (presumably the right in most cases) held the cutting tool and shaped the image. The other hand held the material being worked, adjusting it for orientation and judging weight, size, hardness, pressure, and so on. The right hand was forming a particular class of image in what might be termed a "specify- ing" activity which, though non-linguistic, was related to ''naming.'' It was not merely the manipulative capacity of the hominid hand as tool-user that was involved (Napier 1962), but a two- handed competence with a highly evolved right-handed, vision- oriented specialization for symbol-forming, aided by a left hand supplying a different input. This, of course, has relevance for lateralization, cerebral dominance, cross-modal association, etc., but involved also are such "modes" or aspects as motiva- tion, planning, cognitive modelling, symbolic sequencing, and an exceedingly fine acuity in the kinesthetic, somesthetic, and visual inputs. Above and behind these testable skills there is the more generalized capacity to create and to function within long-term, artificial (or cultural) "equations of relevance." In the Mousterian each of these modes is totally human and far more evolved than is evidenced in a chimpanzee's use of symbol or tool. Some comparisons, however, may be useful. If one assumes that in the Acheulian and Mousterian the use of symbolic images required some form of spoken language to maintain and explain the tradition, one must explore the possi- bility that visually oriented "two-handedness" of the human type, with all of its cross-modal neurological correlates, evolved in conjunction with an increasingly lateralized, corticalized capacity for vocal communication. A brief model for such a possible evolutionary development follows. Most biological systems have a certain range of potential variability. In scientific research and under laboratory condi- tions it is often this range that is tested rather than the system of behavior that is functional under biologically "natural" con- ditions. In part, it is some aspect of this capacity for potentially variable behavior that will function adaptively for an organism under new environmental conditions and then be selected for genetically. The behavioral systems of the anthropoids exhibit the widest range of what I heuristically term the "potential variable capacity." It is an aspect of this capacity that is cur- rently being tested under artificial conditions in chimpanzee research on language acquisition. The range of the "potential variable capacity" inherent in the eye-hand-brain system of the early hominids is, at most, roughly suggested by the chimpan- zees' capacity for tool, gesture, and symbol use in the wild and in the "cultural" conditions of the laboratory. One assumes some degree of evolved difference in the be- havioral capacity of the hominids, associated with such factors as upright posture, full bipedalism, freed hands, and the brain- structuring that would accompany such anatomic changes. Still, the chimpanzee capacity does suggest aspects of the evolv- ing potential and these require study for their relevance to spoken language. In the wild, chimpanzee hands are used in a number of wavs: (a) relationally to gesture, groom, and hold; (b) practically to gather food, make and use simple tools, and solve simple manu- al problems in time and space; and (c) agonistically to display, threaten, throw, or hit. They already function, therefore, cross-modally in different contexts. Unfortunately, while chimpanzee cognition and handedness (including the use of the hand in vision-based "language" sys- tems) have been studied in the laboratory and wild, the primate call system has not been explored to ascertain whether it has any inherent potential variability within the species capacity. Early research to test if the chimpanzee could vocalize human phonemes was perhaps asking the species to perform at biologi- cal levels for which it was not suited, much as though it had been asked to perform two-handed tasks involving complex, separate cognitive strategies and sequences for each hand like those involved in skinning an animal or playing the piano. Primate call systems are used to differentiate and institute affect reactions. Instead of trying to teach the chimpanzee to vocalize human language, it is possible that a human could learn the chimpanzee call system and its relational and affect usage and then be able to modulate or modify both the calls and their usage in order to "affect mark" aspects of structured cultural relations and situations, including elements of a hand- gesture system or a symbol-sign system. It is at this level of possible potential variable capacity in the eye-hand and the affect-call systems that the evolution of speech may have begun. Whether the results of such tests with the chimpanzees were positive or negative, the data would be of significance for the continuing study of speech and language origins. Theoretically, of course, there should be some degree of po- tentially variable capacity in the chimpanzee call system, even without hominid laryngeal development. Still, by the time of the hominid differentiation, it was probably the increased po- tential variability in the capacity of both systems, the eye-hand and the vocal-auditory, that contributed toward the develop- ment of speech and language. At the point in time during which the hominids were making and using the multipurpose Oldowan chopper, the hands, ac- cording to the industry and faunal evidence, were already func- tioning as variable doers, specifiers, and differentiators. They were involved in rather complex strategies and sequences re- quiring specialized locating, securing, processing, forming, and object discrimination. The hominid omnivores not only were making stone tools and killing animals, but also were apparent- ly involved in a "cultural" differentiation of classes, according to their presence in different realms, areas, and periods: wood usable or not, insect edible or not, serpent dangerous or not, amphibian reachable or not, carnivore threatening or not, roots ready or not, stone practical or not, fruit ripe or not, nest- ing bird present or not, and so on. Any regular or structured relation to such diverse objects and species from different realms, areas, and periods would have involved the hand-eye system of an omnivore in cognitive and spatio-temporal strategies of the so-called logical class, includ- ing evaluations and judgments as to size, weight, hardness, distance, speed, and so on. But it would also have included some form of cultural terrain "modelling" with the indications of place and direction perhaps performed by pointing. Many of these capacities are already evidenced in simple, non-lin- guistic form in the chimpanzee (Teleki 1974). In the hominid context the complexity probably would have involved some ac- tivity specialization and dispersal by age, sex, and perhaps rank. Relational and subsistence activities were both becoming "cultural." The hands involved in these complex, specialized, often "cul- tural" or learned skills would already be involved in a system with potential for internally relevant, iconic signing. Before the development of a formalized gestural syntax, a concomitant 280 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="8">capacity for modulation of the call system would have made it possible to lend affect to the hand-signing process. Since affect vocalization serves in various ways to affirm or negate, that is, to warn, calm, approve, demand, comfort, in- dicate state, and mark events or situations via the limbic sys- tem, modulated vocalization could have served in what might be termed "adverbing" and "affect-negation/affirmation."3 A hand can gesture "snake" and indicate size and direction, but concurrent modulation of the danger or fear call could in- dicate whether it was dangerous. The hand, then, would be involved in what might be termed description or modelling with a tendency toward "nouning," some "adjectival" marking, and "verbing" or indication of action or process. The two systems overlap, with a degree of redundancy. To the extent that objects, species, areas, or actions had strong affect, a specifying, modulated vocalization within a hand signing context would itself have "naming" content. The specific vocal- ization accompanying a signing for serpent, for instance, could itself become a sign for the class. Once instituted as a functional mode, such specifying affect vocalization could function at a distance in time and space from the object. It would thus be- come an abstracted, non-iconic symbol, and, though originally of limbic derivation, it could now serve, proto-linguistically, in a gestural, symbolically structured situation with lessened affect. Being volitional, such modulated vocalization would require as- sociation with the hand-eye signing system. In fact, it could function only with reference to the inputs or the iconography of the visual system. Modulated affect vocalization without such cross-modal reference to the visual system would have little communication value. The question is whether such vocalization entailed a use of the "potential variable capacity" of the hominids and subse- quent selection for an increase in that adaptive capacity under increasingly "artificial" cultural conditions or whether it await- ed some mutation with subsequent selection for an increase in a newly instituted capacity. The primate hand can also indicate state, affect, negation and demand. It is significant that these two evolving systems, the hand-eye cognitive and the vocal-auditory marking, as they became increasingly lateralized, specialized, separate, and cross-modally associated, did not lose their original limbic-motor connections and modes. They still exist in man. Instead they became overlain by superseding neocortical functions and ca- pacities. Such a model has the advantage of operating at each point in evolutionary development within the biological capacity of the species and its evolving sub-systems, as well as within the adap- tive needs of the developing hominid cultures. In such a model it is the culture complex and not tool-mak- ing or hunting that provides the environmental matrix and the selective pressures. In fact, tool-making and hunting remained profoundly conservative for some two million or more years. With an increasing complexity in hominid cultures there would be need for an increased capacity for variable marking both in the visual and the vocal modes. This would be due in part to the increasing variability and the concurrent culturalization of objects, processes, actions, and relations. The formalized "struc- tures" that result from production within both modes under these conditions will be discussed in another paper. The problem of language and speech origins is clarified from another direction by the ontogenetic nature of the language capacity. If at any point in the evolutionary process "language" or proto-language was to be learned, it would not have been in the context of the hunt. It would have been learned young and before the individual was economically productive. It would have been learned in the context of the maturing, generalized cognitive capacity and within a child's widening, increasingly complex relational competence. Language and symbolization are always learned as an aspect of the marking of cultulral and relational "equations of relevance. " The non-limbic, voluntary modulation of a danger call, for instance, could call a child back to a hominid windbreak or shelter even if there was no immediate danger. But such a vol- untary call could be uttered only if the adult knew of potential dangers. Call modulation could also express approval of an effort or a developing skill in the child, or the utility or capacity of a stick, stone or bone. Such affect-related marking would be possible and useful only in the context of other, already known and learned equations. It could serve as proto-language, once again, only in a cultural context. This, of course, poses a profound theoretical problem. Lan- guage production always marks or describes less than is known, for both speaker and hearer. It marks or describes an aspect of what is "known," and what is known is largely non-linguistic. This is true at any point in the evolution or the ontogeny of language. What are some of these non-linguistic aspects of "knowing"? A chimpanzee learning a man-made "language" in a man- made context is learning some of what man knows but he is also using the primate potential capacity for learning, not simply a use of hands or a use of symbol, but also certain forms of non-linguistic "equations of relevance." These are funda- mentally relational and only partly "cognitive." The language mode itself is such an equation of relevance. This form of knowledge is apparent in those human aphasias where production of language is damaged but in which the equations for which language is sought remain undamaged. The effort toward speech, itself an equation, may be likewise un- damaged. The outsider can often supply the word or phrase, and the equation or concept is affirmed. These equations are often purely cultural formulations, culture-specific, culture- bound, and without phenomenological reference. They are often not "logical" in the psychologist's use of the term, or "cognitive" or primarily linguistic. In contrast, in certain aphasias the patient can lose the ca- pacity for formulating or specifying equations or sequences of relevance yet maintain a capacity for the production of non- sensical phonemic language. The "deepest" structures of lan- guage, in this sense, are equational and non-linguistic. To return to our primary data, the symbolic images of the Mousterian and Upper Paleolithic could probably be "named," and the meaning and use of any one image could perhaps be explained. But the use of such artificial images was itself a mode and an "equation of relevance," one that had to be learned yet could not be linguistically explained. Human languages, like human image systems, function only in devised contexts. The search for language origins, therefore, should be directed to- wards the complex nature of the evolving, generalizing hominid capacity for artificial, cultural modelling and symbolic struc- turing in all modes.
