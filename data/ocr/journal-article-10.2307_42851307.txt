The term came into prominence among biologists and comparative psychologists from about the mid-thirties, chiefly at the hands of Konrad Lorenz and a few subsequent scholars, but its rapid development has been a 'post-second-world-war' phenomenon, and it is during the past ten years or so that its public vogue has increased with the growing number of 'Sunday Books' : i.e., those gaining the prominence of weekly colour supplements and television reports. The literature is varied and colourful. Some books (whether one agrees with them or not) are at the highest level of science: the greater part of the work of Lorenz himself is unquestionably of this order; as is that of Thorpe, Tinbergen, Hinde, and many others. So too, though on a different conceptual plane, are books like Goodall's In the Shadow of Man. At the other end of the spectrum are the artistes of the pavement theatre, chief among whom is Robert Ardrey, who - armed with a flashy, flourishing one-man band (bazookas blowing, cymbals clashing, drums thumping) of a literary style - is calculated to call forth a blush (not of shock but of scientific and philosophical embarrassment) on every page. Desmond Morris has a foot in both camps. He knows better than Ardrey, but his legs stretch very far indeed. Elastic has nothing in it, and so far there is no sign of a snapping-point. The picture is the more confused in that the popular literature is not confined to the pavement artistes. Lorenz himself has written popular books ( King Solomon's Ring ; On Aggression) which, though of a different order from those of Ardrey are nonetheless controversial. So . . . there are clashes and cleavages. Many who admire Lorenz in many ways (Hinde, for example, who thinks him a 'giant') are nonethe- less seriously critical of his views on the instinctive basis of aggression in human nature. And many (Lorenz included) would want to discard some of Morris's extremes, and especially the popularizing zeal of Ardrey's music. Acknowledging his literary 'flair' and powers of</page><page sequence="2">128 REVIEW ARTICLE popularization, Lorenz nonetheless says : 'It is when he comes to popularize my ideas that he makes me sweat*. The camp of the ethologists is therefore itself in colourful disarray. Not surprisingly, it is also exposed to attacks from without, and not surprisingly these come from practitioners of subjects who feel their territory is being invaded: biologists, experimental psychologists (that strange unhappy, faceless breed), anthropologists, etc. Some of the critics are balanced and sound; others are as bizarre as the ethological extremists. Thus, if you ever tire of Robert Ardrey's flamboyant performances, you can turn divertingly to Ashley Montagu who is playing his trumpet on the other side of the street. Of the two, Ardrey is preferable. He is, at least, an outright shocker - a kind of fluting, ebullient, pavement- theatre version of Rossini - whereas Ashley Montagu takes himself very seriously, and his strident tones are aggrieved, anxious, sad. Even the theatre-queues would try to unglue his lips from the mouthpiece of his old-fashioned cornet, and move him along with a quick shilling. The great trouble in all this is that Ethology becomes equated with the Ardrey and Morris image (including, perhaps, Lorenz's On Aggression) and the critics therefore savage an absurdly over-simplified position, whilst leaving the serious dimensions of the subject unexamined. It is the old story: (a) every movement suffers from its lunatic fringe, and (b) it is the easiest way for those who do not want to trouble their minds with the claims of a subject, to make fun of its loonies. Meanwhile, the publicly flamboyant criticism makes it clear that the subject's serious dimensions are simply not understood. It suffers, therefore, from its popular exposure and contentiousness and the public's sense of its significance alike. And such marketability engenders more books of the same genre. Nowadays newspapers, publishers, agents, sniff books into being. Market research - not intellectual soundness - is the pointer. Much of this current discussion on both sides is also lacking in reliable historical and analy- tical perspectives. Frequently not much is known by the disputants about the roots of ethology in earlier comparative psychology; about its development; about the ways in which animal studies were taken into account in earlier sociological theories concerning the nature and development of social institutions; and no link at all seems to have been seen between the detailed analysis of 'instinct' in animal studies and the sociological analyses (from the turn of the century to now) of the 'self' in society, and the significance of 'sentiments', 'sanctions', 'values' in all this. The picture is therefore given of a new science of the comparative study of animal behaviour; a new focus upon biological evolution and its relevance for understanding human behaviour ; a new insight into the relevance of all this for anthropology, psychology, and sociology. But, like the New Left, this is all very old, and we will come back to it later. What is certain is that it is high time that this literature was critically assessed not only in an ad hoc way - book by individual book - but as a whole. It is a necessary task now to assess its varied levels of contribution; to place it in perspective; and, above all, to consider its rela- tions to psychology and sociology and to see whether some clear conceptual and theoretical integration might not be possible and worthwhile. A review article can be only indicative, but a range of recent books make some reflections on the task seem timely. Lorenz : Collected Papers First, it is of the greatest value to have, now, the publication in English of important papers by Konrad Lorenz. These are excellent and beautifully produced books. The style - both of Lorenz and his translator Robert Martin - is clear, attractive, engaging throughout, though dealing with arguments concerning conceptual clarification so detailed as easily to have become tedious. They cover an enormous range of scientific reference. The two volumes cover the period 1931-1963 (Vol. 1. 1931-42; Vol. 2. 1941-63) and the papers, therefore, besides being important in their own right, have the virtue of covering the period of development of ethology - from the 'thirties until very recently. They also deal with varying aspects of it: the con- ceptualization and analysis of 'instinct'; studies of particular animals and species; general</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW ARTICLE 129 issues of scientific method; and the relations between ethology and other subjects. All these studies demonstrate to the full Lorenzi prodigious knowledge of animal species, of the exten- sive literature, of his insistence upon and indefatigable carrying out of the most careful com- parative studies, and of his capacity for painstaking accuracy. As Hinde has said, he has a certain paternalistic style that might offend some, but his work unquestionably proves him a consum- mate scientist studying a range of facts in which he is not only interested and deeply absorbed, but which he also loves. 'The Establishment of the Instinct Concept' (Vol. I, p. 259) is particularly important as one of the earliest statements of the ethological position. It shows, too, that Lorenz himself is not among those who claim a new science. He plainly roots his own position in Darwin, but also discusses the various theories of instinct in comparative psychology through Spencer, Lloyd Morgan, MacDougall, and others to his own newly formulated departure. In all cases, his critical assessment is careful, balanced, fair. This paper and 'Inductive and Teleological Psy- chology' (Vol. I, p. 351) also make important points very clear. For example (a) that the 'reflex' is not a basal unit of behaviour, nor the central nervous system simply geared to 'react' to external stimuli, but ' ... it is one of the most important functions of the central nervous system to produce its own stimuli . . . ', (b) that, therefore, the explanation of animal behaviour in terms of conditioned reflexes is completely insufficient; (c) that certain specific behaviour patterns are innately determined and as recognizable within a species as elements of anatomical structure; (d) that these patterns are sometimes 'released' in situations of environmental insuf- ficiency, so that they are not then serving adaptation; (e) that it is the release of the behaviour itself that the animal 'desires', but also that (f) elements of 'conditioning' and 'learning' are linked with these, giving rise to 'intercalated patterns' in which 'instinctive and purposive components are incorporated'. Lorenz, in short, very clearly and thoroughly establishes his concept and analysis of instinct, and we are left in no doubt about its important implications. Volume II offers more papers on conceptualization and method, some on scientific method generally, some comparing ethological methods with other methods of studying behaviour, and - perhaps the most important for our purposes - one in which observations are made concerning the nature of animal and human society. Two points concerning Lorenz's conception of science and scientific analysis are worth noting. The first is his much-repeated insistence on the importance of sheer observation. A scientist must saturate himself at first hand with the facts in his field. He must persistently, painstakingly, unhurriedly - without too much of a particular hypothetical guide at first - concern himself with 'seeing what is there', with becoming thoroughly familiar with his subject-matter. On the face of it, this seems to run counter to our current notion of the 'hypo- thetico-deductive' methods of science; but this is only on the face of it. Lorenz is very persua- sive that long observation - without the tight confines of hypotheses - is necessary, and that it is only with long looking, with a rich familiarity with the subject matter, that regularities become noticeable, and required lines of explanation become clear. Lorenz, in short, is inducti- vist in spirit ; not in dogma but in his degree of empirical emphasis. The second point is that Lorenz is at pains to make it clear that no awareness of the functions that behaviour serves (within a physical, biological, or social system) can be sufficient. In addition, a detailed analysis of elements and a causal explanation of their interconnections is necessary. His central point is that when systems break down, no amount of knowledge of their functions will put them right. Only with a causal knowledge of what goes into the interconnections and operation of their elements can they be put into working order again. Like some we know in sociology (Comte, Durkheim, etc.), Lorenz learns much about the causal interdependencies of normal behaviour from their pathological instances. These points are directly relevant to Lorenz's notions as to the importance of ethology for the understanding of man and society - of special interest to us. Contrary to many assumptions, Lorenz is quite agreed that human society is qualitatively different from animal societies:</page><page sequence="4">130 REVIEW ARTICLE more flexible; more to be explained in terms of culture, history, institutional learning. But his insistence is that we should look at human behaviour, and see the regularities- of percep- tion, impulse, emotion, dispositions towards action, patterns of behaviour - which are there, and which are rooted in our own nature as a specific species. Basic and innately given com- ponents of experience and behaviour underlie the accumulated fabric of our complex culture and history, and it is of the utmost importance that we should know about them. Again - contrary to common assumptions - Lorenz has no simple-minded 'purposive* or 'hormic' psychology in mind. His emphasis that, in animal instinct, the behaviour itself is compulsively desired, becomes relevant. Aggression is his most emphasised example. If man has an innate component of aggressive behaviour, this will be a perennial fact it is important to bear in mind. It is not that man is aggressive for some purpose; but that he desires the aggressive behaviour as such. Similarly, if a young child has an instinctive component of clinging to its mother, this may fulfil the function of bringing it near to the breast and feeding, but Lorenz does not hold that the warm close attachment is sought for this purpose. It may be an insistent and impor- tant behavioural component in itself and the deprivation of it may lead to ill consequences (of the stunted growth and development of the child). And Lorenz argues that although man is capable of rational thought, the establishment of knowledge, and is educable in many of these directions, it may nonetheless be the case that certain innate components of his nature and behaviour are unalterable (in the sense of being ineradicable elements of his endowment). He points with much force to the growing incongruity between : ' . . . man's mastery of his external environment and his stunning inability to solve the intra-specific problems of man- kind*. But Lorenz has interesting points to make about the differences between animal and human society (here he comes close to the position which, in sociology, has long been held) and he is much more moderate and clear on this than almost anyone else. His crucial distinction is made clear by a discussion of the relation between individual and society ('part and whole') in animal and human social systems. It is that almost all the features of the animal society are concomitant with that behavioural repertiore of the individual which is innately established, whereas in a human society, a far greater range of variability and plasticity of behaviour; of rational knowledge, judgement and purpose; is involved in learning and in cumulative cultural and historical processes. This, of course, is a position long accepted. Thus, Lorenz argues: There are very many qualities of an individual which can indeed only be 'understood' through the structure of the total entity (the total society), but which the individual possesses as innate, inherited features and not as traditionally transmitted acquisitions. In the animal, this is almost completely so. Having discussed two kinds of 'learning' - the conditioning of responses, and the development of personal recognition of specific individuals (let us briefly note that this is what earlier writers referred to as the development of 'habits' and 'sentiments' with the operation of instinct) - Lorenz then goes on to show that these account for only very minor modifications of the 'social repertoire' of animals, in their dis- tinctive societies. . . . Even with the highest and - with respect to the structure of their societies - furthest differentiated vertebrates, we have not yet encountered a major structural character of such societies which could be modified by conditioned responses. However much the behaviour of such organisms towards their extraspecific environments may be modified through experience and acquisition, all behaviour patterns directed towards conspecifics remain relatively unaffected ... I am literally unable to quote one single case - even with dogs or monkeys - when a behaviour pattern relevant to conspecifics is influenced by conditioned responses. A clear example is given in Lorenz's description of jackdaw societies. In relation to eating» seeking food, recognising enemies which evoke alarm and flight, the preference of nesting</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW ARTICLE I3I sites - their behaviour is dependent upon the experience of individuals and transmission through the 'social tradition', but, clearly distinct from all these: . . . the behaviour of the birds with respect to one another exhibits not the slightest variability. All the behaviour patterns which ensure the social co-ordination of the colony members are - ' photographically identical' . This conclusion can be demonstrated by the data of very wide comparative studies. (For the sociologist it is extremely interesting to see here the tremen- dous significance of the comparative method as distinct from artificial experiment - and to this we will return.) This picture of animal society is very clear, and Lorenz says quite forthrightly : Without doubt, the ethologist can see more clearly than anyone else the fundamental difference between these functional analogues of ethical behaviour in social animals and the unique phylogenetically unpre- cedented phenomena of rational responsibility exhibited by mankind. Now this is surely clear enough. Lorenz has two main emphases concerning human society. The first is his persuasion and insistence that - overlaid by all the complexities of cultural and historical 'acquisitions' of behaviour - it is still a mistake to think that man is (behaviourally) a tabula rasa on which social learning writes the total story. His emphasis here, it must be noted, is not to replace any wider explanations of social order, variety, and change by a naive (and all-sufficient) 'instinct theory' (it is, and it has always been, his opponents who are naive in thinking this) but only to insist that instinctual components are there , and that wider theories will be insufficient and in error unless these, too, are taken into account. Thus it may be a colossal danger to ignore the possibility that there are instinctive propensities towards aggression in man, and to assume that 'human nature' can be moulded and altered by social conditioning and 'education'. Ardrey has a significant point here when he argues that there is almost a conspiracy to error in the great majority of American psychologists (and other social scientists) in flatly denying the facts of instinct. It is true. The shocking naivety is on their side; on the side of the 'con- ditioners' - the Skinnerians and Eysenckians and other post Pavlovian-Watsonians. But reason does not, and will not, prevail here. Only a small package of gelignite inserted by elec- trode is likely to dislodge and disturb the concrete memory traces in these solidified brain-pans. An example is the recent book in memory of Schneirla. It is said here (as it has been said ad nauseam for generations now) that Schneirla (undoubtedly a substantial contributor to com- parative psychology) saw the 'fallacies' of the concept of instinct, and pointed out: . . . that the uncritical extrapolation of incompletely supported conclusions from research with infra- human species to specious solutions of the problems of humanity was the result of anthropomorphism, zoomorphism, and a disregard of the law of parsimony and of Morgan's canon. The pessimistic implica- tions of such fallacious thinking for human society were countered by Schneirla's reliance on the highly evolved plasticity of human behaviour for solutions to the problems of human aggression and violence. And yet, later in the substance of the book, the grand change that is made is to replace the term 'instinct' with that of 'instinctive drive)' - which concedes all the points recent theorists have made without admitting it. The plasticity of mind of such contemporary psychologists has led to one thing only : a concrete one-way cul-de-sac. Lorenz has much more of importance to say about 'domestication', 'neoteny', the prolon- gation of 'investigatory' behaviour throughout human life, the liberation from a rigid instinc- tual equipment, etc., and about the implications of all these for many aspects of human society - the division of labour, aggression, cultural development - all of which has since become the stock-in-trade of the subject. And in all that he says he remains scrupulously clear about the hypothetical nature of all his arguments and evidence, and very positive in his concern for</page><page sequence="6">132 REVIEW ARTICLE the co-operative integration of the life-sciences, and, indeed, for a satisfactory science of society : ... At this very time, we need an inductive, scientific discipline of human sociology more than any other discipline, for the most pressing problems of mankind are social problems of such a kind that they cannot be solved by philosophical speculation but only by patient , inductive research work. All this, however, was written between 1935 and 1955, and has since been much used and abused in 'popularizations'. Popularization - and 'Conjectural Evolution : Ardre y , Ashley Montagu , Morris The books by Ardrey and Ashley Montagu are scarcely worth mention, excepting to point out that Ashley Montagu's own introduction and first page to his Matt and Aggression are every bit as brash and exaggerated in their claims as the Ardrey statements they were chiefly intended to attack. The book is a fantastic publishing enterprise aiming at an entire denun- ciation of ethology and the notion of 'instinct* in application to explanations of human behav- iour, but is nothing more than a reprint of review articles - all of them very uneven. It is pleasant to note that the British Anthropologists 'incorporated' show an admirable balance of judgement. Edmund Leach, despite criticism of Lorenz, nonetheless sees him as a reliable scholar, whereas the Ardrey book, he concludes ' ... is best left alone altogether'. Geoffrey Gorer too, takes Lorenz seriously, and - though not dismissing Ardrey - nonetheless concludes caustically that his book (The Territorial Imperative) is 4 ... so full of oversimplifications, questionable statements, omissions and plain inaccuracies . . . ' that it 'demands a wrapper - "Handle carefully. Read with critical scepticism." ' No more need be said. It is more instructive to glance at Desmond Morris. Consider this on the knowledge about man which anthropology and comparative sociology can provide. ( The Naked Ape , p. 10) The earlier anthropologists rushed off to all kinds of unlikely corners of the world in order to unravel the basic truth about our nature, scattering to remote cultural backwaters so atypical and unsuccessful that they are nearly extinct. They then returned with startling facts about the bizarre mating customs, strange kinship systems, or weird ritual procedures of these tribes, and used this material as though it were of central importance to the behaviour of our species as a whole. The work done ... was, of course, extremely interesting and most valuable in showing us what can happen when a group of naked apes becomes side-tracked into a cultural blind alley. It revealed just how far from the normal our behaviour patterns can stray without a complete social collapse. What it did not tell us was anything about the typical behaviour of typical naked apes. This can only be done by examining the common behaviour patterns that are shared by all the ordinary, successful members of the major cultures - the mainstream specimens who together represent the vast majority. Biologically, this is the only sound approach. It is, surely, too grossly lacking in care to require comment. But there is a particular feature of Morris's reasoning which deserves note: a facile evolutionism which starts from 'functions' and works by assumptions and assertions backwards. He is full of such instances. For example : 'the male mandrill has a bright red penis with blue scrotal patches on either side of it. This colour arrangement is repeated on its face, its nose being bright and its swollen, naked cheeks an intense blue'. A similar 'repetition' is true of the female gelada, and Morris claims that 'the inescapable conclusion is that the mandrill and the gelada have brought their genital signals to a frontal position for some reason'. After much discussion of sexual intercourse in terms of mounting from the rear, face-to-face positions, and the like, he then asks us to consider our own nature as human beings. And it all proceeds by questions (pp. 71-6)* Like geladas, we spend a great deal of our time sitting up vertically, We also stand erect and face one another during social contacts. Could it be, then, that we, too, have indulged in something similar in the way of self-mimicry? Could our vertical position have influenced our sexual signals?</page><page sequence="7">REVIEW ARTICLE I33 Having raised such spicy questions, Morris has not the slightest difficulty in answering them. When considered in this way the answer certainly seems to be yes. The matter becomes more interesting (little flecks of saliva begin to gather at the corners of one's mouth.) Can we, if we look at the frontal regions of the females of our species, see any structures that might possibly be mimics of the ancient genital display of hemispherical buttocks and red labia? The answer stands out as clearly as the female bosom itself. The protuberant, hemispherical breasts of the female must surely be copies of the fleshy buttocks, and the sharply defined red lips around the mouth must be copies of the red labia ... If the male of our species was already primed to respond sexually to these signals when they emanated posteriorly from the genital region, then he would have a built-in sus- ceptibility to them if they could be reproduced in that form on the front of the female's body. And this, it would seem, is precisely what has happened, with the females carrying a duplicate set of buttocks and labia on their chests and mouths respectively. Now this is certainly exciting reading. No doubt we look at one another's faces in new ways, with new insights and interpretations. But my concern here is not so much with the buttocks, the red labia, and the protuberant breasts, but with the method of speculation. Is this biology? Is this natural science ? The procedure seems to be that of identifying what 'it would seem' is a function of existing physiological, anatomical, behavioural facts, and then conjecturing backwards to the effect that evolution has necessarily been such as causally to produce them. Now it may be so. It may be so. But where is the evidence? And where is the test? Indeed, where is the science? It could be nothing more than a vast guessing game through the forests of natural history. It is in this way that supposed science becomes a vehicle for generalizations that (in more ways than one) would have made the hair of a medieval scholastic stand on end. Anthro- pology has long been sceptical of 'Conjectural History' but 'Conjectural Evolution' is like a Sunday School Treat in comparison (apart, of course, from the buttocks, breasts, and red labia). It is high time that biologists looked questioningly at it. One must take with a certain pinch of salt, therefore, an account which moves through millions of years with statements like: 'The growth of the brain surged on', and which reminds civilized man of his animal ancestry with such profound statements as: 'Even a space ape must urinate'. No wonder that Lorenz sweats at reading friend and foe alike. Fortunately, however, the work of ethology has grown in more important and impressive ways. Two other books - though both very different - are reliably indicative of this. The Monograph: Jane Goodall One of the best of such studies is In the Shadow of Man by Jane Goodall. Though without the same detailed conceptual framework, this book is of the best of the Lorenz tradition. Jane Goodall loves her subject-matter, is absorbed in the animals she studies and the scientific and intellectual questions which arise, and deeply persuaded of the implications of such know- ledge for the understanding of human nature. There is painstaking care in her observation but also dimensions of speculation going beyond her immediate studies which make her writing sensitive, profound, aesthetically pleasing. There is a touch here, too, of the Darwin, the Fabre, the Lorenz. Jane Goodall is 'an original'. She is also perhaps the world's best evidence for not educating anybody beyond a certain level, but- when they have a definite interest and enthusiasm - to introduce them to the right hands at the right time, and let them do a job. The master-apprentice working arrangement has much to be said for it. The right hands for her were those of Dr L. S. B. Leakey and it was he who encouraged her to undertake her close study of the chimpanzees in the Gombe Stream Reserve on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. Her account of their behaviour is the most fascinating in the literature - not least because 10</page><page sequence="8">134 REVIEW ARTICLE she came to know the animals individually; so that her description of the chimps robbing termite heaps, capturing prey and feeding, involved in periods of sexual excitement, fighting for dominance, experiencing birth, adolescence, illness, death, are all in terms of well-known individuals and their idiosyncrasies, as well as their shared behaviour patterns. Out of her descriptions come points of the greatest importance. Firstly, whilst being able to describe the 'behavioural repertoire' of chimpanzees which is innate and 'species-specific', she also shows much individual difference, much learning, much intelligence, among them - all making the boundaries between man and his 'nearest relatives' less exact. Facial expressions, calls, sequences of birth, feeding, weaning, adolescence, social adulthood, the whole range of social relationships, are clearly described, and in all this there are the most striking similarities between chimpanzee and human behaviour - of gestures, postures, and means of communication - by kissing, embracing, touching, patting, holding hands. The book gives a wide range of convincing examples. But other striking things are demonstrated. For example: (a) that chimpanzees are meat-eating animals; occasional hunters; and pursue certain methods of group-hunting. There was also a certain group-sharing of the prey - yet, interestingly enough, a strong group deference to the primary 'ownership' of the individual who had captured it - to such an extent that even the normal pattern of dominance- submission gave way before it. And (b) that chimpanzees are quite definitely tool-using animals; even tool -making. Stems and twigs are used (deliberately chosen, broken, and fashioned) to get termites out of holes. Leaves are slightly chewed and made into a 'sponge' to get water from small holes in the bark of trees which are inaccessible to the tongue; or to clean out the much enjoyed brains from the skull of a prey. There are examples of using stones as weapons; of clashing tins together to enhance male display. But (c) even more intriguing is her suggestion that the chimpanzee may experience some awareness of 'self', and it is of interest to sociologists familiar with Cooley and Mead that this is concomitant with their early identification of 'others'. 'Self -awareness may not be entirely unique to man. These points are made in a fascinating description of all aspects of individual and group life, only a few elements of which can be mentioned here. There is little doubt whatever, now, for example, of the crucial importance to the offspring of the 'clinging' instinct. It is supremely important to the young to be continually close to the mother. This brings it close to the breast for feeding; but the clinging itself is, as the ethologists put it, the 'consummatory act'. Examples are given of the stunting of growth, the insufficiency of behaviour, the neurotic maladjustments which attend deprivation in this respect, indeed, even death when, for example, the mother dies. Everything that Harlow has said about this bond and about the several 'affectional systems', and everything which Bowlby has come to borrow and build into his account of human 'attachment' is tellingly substantiated. Remarkable observations are also made of aspects of the 'family' group - of females and their offspring; the marked differences between the reactions of female and male offspring from quite an early age, and throughout life; the prolonged bond between mother and 'son' which follows a certain sequence from infancy, through adolescence, to maturity; the period of 'adolescence' itself- of sexual maturity, but not of full physical development and adult social recognition and acceptance; the apparent existence of some 'incest' barriers; and the development of 'pair-bonds' of noticeable kinds. And a fascinating account is given of the other central focus of the relationships of the entire group : the 'dominance-submission' pattern among the adult males, though a similar hierarchy can exist among females too. The point worth great emphasis is that the most intense display, threat, and exercise of aggression among conspecifics takes place in relation to this dominance-submission hierarchy of the adult males, and this is a factor underpinning and giving further evidential support to the instinctive com- ponents of human aggression emphasised by Lorenz and others. The pattern of dominance- submission seems the central feature of the life of the group. These, however, are glimpses</page><page sequence="9">REVIEW ARTICLE I35 only of the wealth of observations that fill this book and give the ethological arguments for relating the study of animals to the understanding of man rich and substantial support. One element of criticism must be mentioned (see further the discussion of Chance and Jolly below) because of its particular interest to sociologists with regard to their own problems of method. Goodall's method was - as closely as can be managed in the study of animal societies - one of participant observation. To succeed in this she furthered the confidence of the chimps by deliberate and systematic 'provisioning' (feeding them with bananas) and it has been argued that in doing so she may have affected and changed the behaviour of the group. This, however, is not mentioned negatively here, but only as a methodological point to which we will return. Systematic Methodology and Comparative Study: Chance and Jolly Social Groups of Monkeys, Apes , and Men by Michael Chance and Clifford Jolly will appeal to sociologists in different ways. The growing influence of ethology has led to the extension of the study of the primates (primatology) and this book brings together much of this work. It differs from Goodall's study in being a methodologically concerned book - establishing con- ceptual agreements, systematic methods of comparative study, etc., - but it is just as insistent upon the study of animal societies in the field. It is because of its methodological awareness, its familiarity with at least some anthropology and sociology, and its deliberate analysis of primate societies as 'social systems' that sociologists will find this an interesting book, both for seeing the 'sociological perspective' at work in animal studies, and for seeing the significance between the study of animal societies and the study of man. The book has been deprecatingly reviewed in one sociological journal, and unfairly so. It is of great utility, firstly, in providing a good introductory survey of the primates : the main divisions of them, and their distribution throughout the world. A virtue which this possesses, and to which the authors hold throughout, is that meticulous distinctions as well as similarities are drawn not only between primates and man, but also (extremely important) between the different groups of sub-human primates themselves. Thus - even among the 'super-family' to which man belongs - the social groups (and the patterned experience and behaviour of individuals within them) of Gibbons, Gorillas, Chimpanzees, Orang-Utans, are in important ways distinct. This makes any simple generalization from 'animals' (even pri- mates) to 'man', insufficient. 'Social Systems' - whatever their biological roots - differ among animal groups within the same broad family divisions, just as they do among mankind. A long section also surveys the behavioural studies of primate societies which have already been conducted, describing and analysing their form, content, and methods. In all cases, the ecology of the particular animal population is clearly studied. The social structure of the pop- ulation is related in functional terms both to environmental features and to the continuing interdependencies of behaviour. The distinctive groupings of animals within the total beha- vioural order of the society are made clear. Sociograms are offered, analysing the patterns of social behaviour: approach behaviour; threat, aggression, submission, ranking; sexual and parental behaviour; grooming and other forms of 'reassurance-through-contact' behaviour; play behaviour - and all with careful precision. The behavioural repertoire (individual and social) of the population is systematically explored. The over-all patterns of social attention and their relevance for forms of group cohesion - with an analysis of the several elements involved - is made clear. A system of analysis is thus laid out which comes very close indeed to that of sociology, and yet includes all the conceptual apparatus of ethology. Indeed, this really amounts to the deliberate incorporation of the 'sociological perspective' (the analysis of social systems) in the satisfactory study of animals ; showing the clear relations between biology, phylogenetic studies, neuro-physiology, psychology, and sociology, and verging on the 'social behaviourism' of a theorist like Mead (so much more correct and many-dimensioned than the Pavlov- Eysenck-Skinner kind). But to come back to method, an extremely interesting point arises.</page><page sequence="10">136 REVIEW ARTICLE I noted earlier than Goodall's study (and others) had been criticised for 'provisioning* to gain the presence and confidence of the animals - in that they may, in this, have actually changed and distorted the behaviour of the groups involved. These difficulties - raised in this book - are exactly on a par with the problems sociologists encounter in trying to set up 'experi- mentar studies of human groups. The upshot is that the methods of 'artificial experiment', so fertile in the physical sciences, are seen to have the same kinds of limitation in the study of animal societies as they have in the study of man. Even similar ethical problems arise (hence Jane Goodall's title !). The intriguing outcome is that these studies of animal behaviour are driven (by the sheer claims of methodological sufficiency) to the use of the comparative method including the careful classification of animal societies on the basis of deliberately constructed typologies. In short, the comparative and typological methods of sociology are found to be indispensable in the satisfactory development of ethology. This seems to me a most positive and promising step towards the conceptual linking up of the 'life-sciences', and the articulation of satisfactory relationships between them. The details of the studies drawn together in this book cannot be satisfactorily indicated in a review article; but extremely important issues are discussed. All the points raised by Goodall are further substantiated with evidence, but the most significant concentration is upon (a) the clear analysis of the basic components of 'sub-human* primate societies, (b) the nature of 'agonistic and 'hedonic' behaviour, and - constructed upon these two bases; (c) a typological distinction between 'acentric* and 'centripetal* societies, placing emphasis upon the 'structuring of attention* distinguishing each, which has clear functions for the survival of the society in its particular environment. Again, the extent to which dominance-submission behaviour appears to be the central element in the entire social order of the group - the ways in which conflict and aggression are predominantly rooted in it and related to it: in which the most basic patterns of perception, attention, and degrees of 'social distance' (experienced and shared by all the members of the group as individuals) are associationally orientated in accordance with it - is strikingly emphasised, and deserves the most careful study and consideration. The observations made on human society are very limited indeed, as the authors are at pains to point out; but the relevance of these studies for the study of man, and, conversely, of the study of man (methodologically at least) for the study of the life of animals, is very plain to be seen. Indeed, to the best of my knowledge, in no other book is the relationship between ethology, psychology, and sociology so clearly and excellently indicated, if not provisionally portrayed, and with conceptual positions so clear as to further the co-operation between the subjects. Much methodological clarification can come out of a critical consideration of the survey of studies, and the analytical ideas, of this book. Conceptual and Theoretical Connections : Hilary Callan Ethology and Society by Hilary Callan explicitly sets out to examine the relations between ethology and the study of human society. A brief initial survey of the anthropological, socio- logical, and ethological literature is better informed about recent than about earlier work (a person who mistakes Hobson for Hobhouse cannot know the literature to which reference is made) and introduces a discussion of the various levels of contact between ethology and soci- ology. Particular themes - aggression and social control, ritualizations of 'greeting', dominance and the position of women - are then considered in detail, and a number of most important points come out. The question as to whether 'instinctive' bases of human experience and behaviour enter, as necessary elements, into any satisfactory understanding of the forms of social life in human society is taken very seriously, and (I think it is fair and correct to say - though Callan is cautious and critical throughout) accepted. The important conclusion is that sociologists should look again at how they define 'social facts'. Sociology need not in any way retract the</page><page sequence="11">REVIEW ATRICLE 137 Durkheimian emphasis - i.e., that the processes of human association are psychologically creative. No new psychological or biological reductionism is being advocated. It is only that there may well be, in man, as in closely related animal species, innately established elements of experience and behaviour which have necessary relevance to forms of social relationships and to aspects of collective life. The gulf between the individual and society may not be there to the extent we have supposed. The natural (inherited, species-specific) endowment of man (as with the animals) may actually be of a social nature in many respects. This is an extremely impor- tant point, and, in fact, links everybody from Darwin to Lorenz; from Lloyd Morgan and Hobhouse to MacDougall, Cooley, Mead, Pareto; from Westermarck to Freeman, Tiger and Fox. A second conclusion is that a 'structural' analysis of social forms seems the most promising link between ethological and sociological analysis, and this is pursued in Callan's interesting examination of the important theme of aggression - and in ways which closely agree with Lorenz, and Chance and Jolly. With similar discussions of 'greeting ceremonies' and other elements of social behaviour, the author concludes that similar elements of structure and function are at work in both animal and human societies, and that similar concepts are appropriate, and can be shared, in the study of them. Again, the detail of this book cannot be sufficiently indicated here, but - though an 'exercise in preliminary thinking' - it comes to some firm conclusions and accom- plishes much. Experimental Psychology - A Poor Relation: Dimond One of the striking things in this whole range of work is the extent to which what has come to be called (by the insistent differentiation of its practitioners) 'experimental psychology* stands out like a sore thumb. For the sufficient observation, description, explanation of the natural/social life of animals as well as the natural/social life of man, artificial experiment has proved to be of decidedly limited scientific use. The carefully pursued comparative method, with the use of typological constructs, has proved essential. Yet 'experimental psychology' still clings to its artificial experimentation with 'parts' of the organism (reflexes and their conditioning, stimulus-response mechanisms, and the like). The day is not now far distant when this entire reflexology (and the dogmatic insistence on the all-sufficiency of 'conditioning' that has gone with it) will be seen as one of the most impoverished intellectual curiosities in the history of the human sciences. The Social Behaviour of Animals by S. J. Dimond is a timely example embodying this approach. Though by no means totally opposed to the work of all ethologists, it is based largely upon Skinner's notion of 'operant behaviour', and is sparse indeed. It is a catalogue of experiments under its various heads ; each item outlined in only the briefest terms. Compared with all the books mentioned above, its impoverished nature is starkly apparent. Conclusions All the points raised above obviously call for a degree of careful criticism impossible in a review article. Attention needs to be drawn to much that has already been worked through in the sociological literature; to significant qualifications to the theories of biological evolution which have followed from studies of social evolution; and, again and again, to the significant differences between human and animal societies. Our conclusion however, in surveying the present range of books, can be quite positive and clear. Interest in the merging of ethology and sociology is growing, and considerable strides have already been made towards conceptual agreement. The literature of the pavement artistes is greatly outweighed by the more serious studies. In 'monograph' type books (like that of</page><page sequence="12">138 REVIEW ARTICLE Goodall) the parallels, the factual evidence, the corroboration of suggestions and the presenta- tion of new ones, are powerful and persuasive. In Lorenz's essays, the conceptual clarifications are presented, worked through to some extent, and - in general - persistently fought for. But Lorenz - though excellent in this - is indicative only as far as sociology is concerned. In the work of Chance and Jolly, however, real steps are taken towards an analysis of animal and human 'social systems' which could incorporate the richness of both etiological and socio- logical concepts alike. And Callan's essay - touched off by Freeman, Tiger, Fox and others - is a constructive effort in the direction of conceptual and theoretical integration. The situation has clearly now arisen when - in many directions of work (ethology, pri- matology, anthropology, sociology) - the kind of close relationship which has long been seen to be necessary and worthwhile between the study of animals and the study of man, and of their species-specific forms of social life, can be conceptually articulated to a point of sufficiency, penetration and exactitude not possible before. The lines of demarcation between man and related animal species, though still clear in many ways, have also in some ways become more questionable. The parallels between the experiential and behavioural repertoires of man and related animals have been demonstrated beyond doubt. The scope for analysing the complex course of primate and human evolution (biological and social) has widened, has become more many-dimensioned and interesting. The concepts for the analysis of patterns of social behaviour, forms of grouping, the structural elements of society, their functions in relation to the environmental challenge of life-conditions, and for the life of individuals within this context - are clearly moving towards the possibility of a shared scheme of analysis. Methods of study can also be agreed. The similarities, and the distinct differences, between animal societies and those of men can be laid bare. Clear questions about the relations between them all can now be put and explored. And it does seem that - no matter how complex human civilisation has become, and may become - it is of the greatest pragmatic importance that we should have the clearest knowledge possible of man's biologically given nature if certain possible cataclysms attending man's power to transform his world are to be averted, and if all the rich potentialities of human fulfilment are to be secured. This exercise of theoretical integration should now be pressed forward - with every care, but with no delay. A satisfactory articulation of the life- sciences lies within our grasp; to achieve it is a matter of crucial practical and intellectual concern.</page></plain_text>
