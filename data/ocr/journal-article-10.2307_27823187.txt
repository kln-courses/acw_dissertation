<plain_text><page sequence="1">Recent contemporary shows London by GEORGE MAJOR taking a variety of approaches, both through formal retrospective exhibitions and group shows, several recent and current exhi bitions in London have sought to trace the trajectory of various artists' development by exhibiting works from distinct periods along side one another, locating recurring themes and motifs which can be found throughout their work. Of these exhibitions, by far the most ambi tious in its scope was at Ambika P3 (closed 4th April) where From Floor to Sky brought together the work of no fewer than twenty eight contemporary British artists, each of whom was asked to contribute two works, one to represent the earliest period of their career and a second more recent one. The exhibition was curated by Peter Karelia, whose aim in bringing together such a broad range of works was to provide an insight into the develop ment of each individual artist's uvre, and as thorough an assessment of contemporary British sculpture as the space would allow. The space itself is very impressive. Ambika P3, at 35 Marylebone Road, is housed in a monumental fourteen thousand square-foot hall, which was originally used as a facility for testing concrete constructions as part of the University of Westminster's engineering department. In converting it into an exhibi tion venue, the bare minimum of interven tion has been made to the space, which retains its industrial appearance and subterranean setting. The works were beautifully installed, each exhibit occupying its own distinct pool of light in the deep gloom of this vast room. Large-scale works such as those of Richard Long appeared quite at home, while smaller and more mtimate pieces such as Keith Brown's crowd of tree stumps (Fig. 56), each with its own carved wooden doppelganger, were sympathetically displayed. Rather than overshadowing these smaller pieces with its scale, the hall provided a contemplative atmosphere. In restricting the selection of the works in From Floor to Sky to one early and one recent example from each of the artists, the curator 56. Clone installation, by Keith Brown. 1980-82.

Currendy, a very different form of the group exhibition can be seen at The Foundling Museum (to 9th May), which includes recent works by Mat Collishaw, Tracey Emin and Paula Rego. Each of these three artists has provided new works to be exhibited among the Museum's permanent collection of paintings, artefacts and furniture throughout its wonderfully preserved eight eenth-century interiors, removed from the old Foundling Hospital. The works touch upon parenthood, childhood, loss and grief, sex and exploitation, themes that resonate with the history of the Hospital, which was Britain's first home for abandoned children. Rego's Oratorio (Fig. 5 7) depicts the fall from grace of women in the eighteenth cen tury, combining imagery of seduction, abuse and infanticide. Oratorio takes the form of an imposing three-metre-tall altarpiece, dom inating the first-floor landing of the Museum. This work bears a particular thematic rela tionship to Hogarth's Gin Lane (1750-51), which is in the Museum's permanent collection. Elsewhere Rego's works on paper maintain similar themes with graphic tides including Rape and Pregnant girl disposing of the evidence. Emin's collection of discarded baby clothes and shoes is a somewhat gender, but never theless unsettling contribution; as a collection of assorted baby clothes hanging on a rail, this understated intervention, almost hidden away in a corner of one of the Museum's qui etest rooms, makes for a ghosdy presence. Equally unsettling, Emin's text Abortion how it feels works in contradiction to the serene atmosphere of the room in which it is found, one otherwise devoted to artefacts relating to the Foundling Hospital's patron, George Frederic Handel. With its incredibly frank account of abortion, this text-piece provides one of the exhibition's most gripping moments. Another striking work is Mat Collishaw's Children of a lesser God, a large scale photographic work recalling Romulus and Remus, depicted as infants cared for by wolves. This ambiguous image of savagery and nurturing provides an affecting analogue of the Foundling Hospital's history. Contain ing such variously moving and powerful works presented in contrasting contemporary artistic vocabularies, this exhibition evokes a compelling sense of the eighteenth-century Foundling's original purpose. Also displaying works of distinct periods alongside one-another, The Approach recendy showed new collages by John Steza ker with works by the artist from the 1980s under the title Tabula Rasa (closed 7th March). This term was first applied by the artist to these earlier works in which he intro duced his recurring rhomboid motif, a two dimensional motif suggestive of a void cut out of a three-dimensional space. Stezaker initially took the tide Tabula Rasa from a piece of music by Arvo Part, written after a period of creative block and tided in refer ence to the composer's dread at the sight of an empty page. But where for Part the tabula rasa is an object of dread, for Stezaker it is less a void to be filled than an addition that is made by the artist onto an appropriated image. In the earlier works this rhomboid motif is silk-screened onto the canvas, while the new works are in the form of collages made using overlaid black-and-white film stills from which the motif has been cut out. These collages are thus more explicit than the earlier works in treating the rhomboid motif as a void or aperture; here it has become a window onto a second image, partially visible underneath the first. The images appropriated for use in the collages all contain elaborately posed figures and Stezaker's interventions produce an arbitrary relationship between what otherwise are unrelated and disjointed scenes, a jumpy continuity evocative of the cutting from one film scene to another. This gives rise to a rather comic effect as one fig ure morphs into another across the boundary between the two overlaid film stills. Waddington Galleries presented works by Barry Flanagan spanning the forty years of his career from the time of his first exhibition in 1966 up until his death in 2009 (closed 17th April).1 The entire range of materials for which Flanagan's work is recognised was represented here, including his early unpre tentious and fragile sculptures made with hessian and sand and his carved stone pieces. But it was Flanagan's celebrated bronzes of hares (Fig. 5 8) that dominated this engrossing exhibition. Flanagan made the decision to change to working in bronze in part for the durability of that material. Even so, for all of their permanence and monumentality, these anthropomorphic and playful animal figures, often incorporating irreverent references to other works and cultural symbols, share the 58.

This expressive playfulness is the common theme that can be traced throughout Flanagan's uvre, from his transient 1966 sculpture, sim ply made by pouring one hundredweight of sand onto the ground, and his hand-printed banknotes, which Flanagan produced in the early 1970s, through to his most ambitious large-scale bronzes. A major mid-career retrospective devoted to the work of Chris Ofili (born 1968) is cur rently on display at T?te Britain (to 16th May).2 Here, Ofili's work is presented in stricdy chronological order, starting with the infamous paintings incorporating elephant dung (Fig. 5 9), with which he found fame in the late 1990s, and his collaboration with the architect David Adjaye on the Upper room, produced between 1999 and 2002, in which his work is at its most highly developed and structured. The later rooms are devoted to a generous selection of Ofili's most recent works. There is a very distinct transition between the Upper room period and the work that follows it. The paintings from the latest stage of his career eschew the bright multi layered surfaces of his works from the 1990s and their fusion of popular culture and poli tics. The latest work, executed in Trinidad, is more subdued and ambiguous but that is not to say that these are necessarily mellower paintings. They are suggestively imbued with folkloric imagery, with barely discernible figures emerging from their deep and richly coloured surfaces. Whatever the differences between the earlier and late works, all the paintings share a sense that the artist is constructing his own mythological world of characters taken both from his own imagin ing and from popular culture or public life. However, in the later paintings these charac ters are no longer immediate and illustrative, as in the pre- Upper room work, but allegorical and distant, more mysterious and with a hint that they may possibly be more malignant too. This retrospective succeeds in demon strating the developments in the work of an artist who helped define the sensational and attention-grabbing art of the 1990s, but whose work would now seem to be moving in the direction of more austere and reflective times. 1 Catalogue: Barry Flanagan.
