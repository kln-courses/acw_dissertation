Literality and God-Metaphors in the Hebrew Bible Gary Alan Long HOW DOES ONE talk about the God of the Bible?' Within the university or seminary classroom, discussions attempt to describe and explain the deity and the religious systems in which he2 is ven- erated. That ongoing dialogue is a facet of God-talk: talk offered by people not responsible for the writing of Scripture but who strive to make sense of its content. I shall look briefly at this facet of God-talk, but I do so only to set the stage for my main interests in this article: (1) notions of literality and (2) the metaphoric lan- guage used for God among the writers of the Hebrew Bible.3 I high- light that one must be ready to use terminology for literal meaning precisely, and I consider the metaphoric language for God along- side a framework of first- and second-order meaning. I turn first to modern God-talk and spotlight two viewpoints. Gary Alan Long is Chair of the Department of Hebrew Language, Institute of Holy Land Studies, Mt. Zion PO Box 1276, 91012 Jerusalem, ISRAEL. 11 wish to offer special thanks to Profs. Dennis Pardee and Cynthia Miller and to Mr. David Clemens for their meaningful comments on earlier drafts. They of course cannot be held accountable for any of this work's remaining errors and insufficiencies. Also, responses from a reading of a draft before the EDSEL group of the University of Chicago Divinity School assisted me in some reformulations. 2My use of the masculine pronoun for YHWH/God is not offered as a statement on how the deity's gender should or should not be contextualized among modern readers of the Bible. I simply follow the writers of the Bible who referred to YHWH/God as a male deity, indicated, among other things, through personal deictics and verb conjugation. 3Macky has argued that in addition to metaphoric language, the biblical authors talked of God in nonfigurative language. As examples of this, Macky claims that, among other things, "negative assertions" (e.g., Deut 32:4 "[God is] without iniquity" ['yn 'wl]) and the linking of God with attributes from semantic fields of 'mn and hy (e.g., Deut 32:4 "God is faithful" ['1 'mwhl) constitute nonfigurative language about God (1990:189-229). 509</page><page sequence="2">510 Journal of the American Academy of Religion GOD-TALK AND CONTRASTING VIEWS The student of religion and philosophy can only discover quickly that scholars have greatly divergent opinions about literal and nonliteral language. Janet Soskice has drawn attention to posi- tivism of the sort espoused by A.J. Ayer, positivism that considers God-talk to be without empirical cognitive meaning because such talk cannot escape figuration (68, 142-3). Ayer asserts the following: [T]here can be no way of proving that the existence of a god, such as the God of Christianity, is even probable. .... For to say that "God exists" is to make a metaphysical utterance which cannot be either true or false. And by the same criterion, no sentence which purports to describe the nature of a transcendent god can possess any literal significance. (1950:115) Such statements arise from a view that sees words and mental rep- resentations as meaningful only through correspondences to the verifiable external world. Nonliteral language is little more than fanciful jargon to be avoided in order to communicate objectively. Literal meanings are supposedly clear and precise; nonliteral meanings are supposedly abstruse and unable to reflect reality properly.4 Ayer objects to the "metaphysician's" reliance on nonlit- eral language to describe the metaphysical, be it God or whatever. He questions the claims of metaphysicians and states that "[i]f what they [metaphysicians] are said to establish does not make sense or, on any literal interpretation, is obviously false, then at the very least the case for their being cognitive has not been made out" (1973:4-5). A substantial and ever-growing corpus of writing stands in con- trast to the frame of mind exemplified by Ayer. Within philosophy, Mark Johnson challenges positivism (1980; 1987), as does the lin- guist and cognitive scientist, George Lakoff (1987; Lakoff and Johnson). Within religion and theology, Ian Ramsey (1957; 1964; 1971), Paul Ricoeur (1977; 1978-9), Sallie McFague, Janet Soskice, Peter Macky (1990), and Marjo Korpel are a few who acknowledge the vital cognitive function of nonliteral language, particularly met- aphor, and its importance in understanding the world and the other-world. Metaphor is meaningful for scientific description, 4This summation is offered by Lakoff and Johnson (186ff) and Lakoff (1987:xi-xvii), who do not hold a positivist position.</page><page sequence="3">Long: Dead or Alive? 511 meaningful for modern God-talk, and meaningful for the talk about God among the biblical writers. THE SENSES OF "LITERAL" Criticism leveled at Lakoff and Johnson's seminal work, Meta- phors We Live By, illustrates the importance of understanding what is meant by "literal" when discussing metaphor. Their work is sig- nificant because they have shown metaphor's pervasiveness in thought and language to the extent that positivism or empiricism, what Lakoff and Johnson call "objectivism," should be rejected. The book has invigorated discussion in many disciplines, but criti- cism centers on what some consider Lakoff and Johnson's absurd notion of literality and metaphoricity.5 Earl MacCormac's critique and Lakoff's rebuttal illustrate that scholars must understand that "literal" has different senses.6 MacCormac contends that Lakoff and Johnson have "no method of distinguishing between metaphoric and nonmetaphoric utterances ... [rather] they distinguish between literal metaphors and figurative metaphors [emphasis his]"-an odd distinction at face value (1985:59). MacCormac adds, "Much of the language that many of us call 'literal' they argue is really 'metaphorical'" (1985:57). In 1986 Lakoff focused on the term "literal" and regretted that he and Johnson had not been more explicit in their book. Lakoff says that people normally assume that "literal" means all of the following senses: Literal 1, or conventional literality: ordinary conventional lan- guage-contrasting with poetic language, exaggeration, approxima- tion, embellishment, excessive politeness, indirectness, and so on. Literal 2, or subject matter literality: language ordinarily used to talk about some domain of subject matter. Literal 3, or nonmetaphorical literality: directly meaningful lan- guage-not language that is understood, even partly, in terms of something else. 51n addition to MacCormac's criticism in the following discussion, I point out the following works: Kittay mentions the "confusion" in Lakoff and Johnson's work (20); Cooper touches on this "serious problem" (22-23); Soskice (81); Macky labels them with the term "radical- ism" (1990:7, 141-2). 6MacCormac's criticism may be found in the following: 1981(161-62); 1985(53-78).</page><page sequence="4">512 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Literal 4, or truth-conditional literality: language capable of "fit- ting the world" (i.e., of referring to objectively existing objects or of being objectively true or false). (1986:292) Lakoff states that people often make various assumptions based on these senses so that the four senses converge into a single meaning of "literal."7 But Lakoff argues against making those assumptions and stresses that the four senses do not converge. He looks at the customary way we English speakers talk of electricity (1986:295).8 We understand it metaphorically, he says, as flowing fluid and crowd movement, and he offers the following for discussion: { 11 A resistor will impede the flow of electricity. {2} A resistor is a narrow gate that will only let a certain number of electrons get through at once, and when there is a whole crowd of electrons they get backed up at the gate. (1986:295) These two utterances9 are metaphoric, he claims, because they describe electricity through something else. As such they are not nonmetaphoric literal (Literal 3). But they are conventional literal (Literal 1) because they are conventional ways to talk about elec- tricity. The utterances are also subject matter literal (Literal 2) because they are conventional ways of talking about the subject of electricity, yet they cannot be truth-conditional literal (Literal 4) because "[b]oth metaphors could not both be objectively true, because fluids are continuous and crowds are individuated" (1986:295).1o They have inconsistent ontologies. The two utter- ances are subject matter literal (Literal 2), but they are not truth- conditional literal (Literal 4). An utterance, then, can be literal in one sense and nonliteral in another. 7The first assumption is conventional literality equals nonmetaphorical literality, that is, the former is "directly meaningful and therefore not metaphorical" (1986:292). The second is conventional literality equals truth-conditional literality, that is, "all ordinary conventional language is capable of referring to objective reality, or of being objectively true or false" (292). The third is subject matter literality equals truth-conditional literality, that is, "there is one and only one objectively correct way to understand every subject; thus the conventional language used to speak of a subject is capable of being true or false" (292). 8Here Lakoff is dependent on the work of Gentner and Gentner. 9Lakoff has not referred to {l}and {2} as utterances, but simply as "sentences" (1986:295). I have called them utterances, and throughout this article I use utterance to refer to an etic, that is, a physically instantiated (etic) word, phrase, or larger syntagm, be it phonetic or graphetic. 10Lakoff believes that "we have no objective way of knowing what electricity 'really is' " (295).</page><page sequence="5">Long: Dead or Alive? 513 Returning to the Lakoff-MacCormac debate, one finds Mac- Cormac stating that his task is to "define the literal as different from the metaphorical" (1985:73). He then adds, "I define the lit- eral as the use of ordinary language to express concrete objects and events" (1985:73). In the first quotation, literal for MacCormac means at least nonmetaphoric literal (Literal 3). The latter state- ment seems grounded in empiricism and conflates conventional, nonmetaphoric, and truth-conditional literality, and Lakoff faults him for not recognizing that literal has different senses and that it is not "theory-neutral" (1986:296).11 That "literal" has various senses is vital to keep in mind. One cannot prudently answer the basic questions of whether literal lan- guage is distinct from metaphoric without knowing which literal is meant. If nonmetaphoric literal is meant, yes is the answer; if con- ventional literal is meant, no (1986:296).12 Those interested in literality and metaphor must be ready to use terminology about literal meaning precisely. One should keep in mind and distinguish, where appropriate, at least two senses of "literal."13 I suggest the terms conventional and nonfigurative. The conventional sense/meaning/interpretation of a linguistic unit, be it 11In addition to Lakoff and MacCormac's dialogue, one can look at two other views of literal meaning. (1) One view equates literal meaning with little more than conventional language (Macky already has made this point about the authors I cite [1990:331). Roland Bartel has said that "[l]iteral language refers to the definitions found in dictionaries.... The definitions [in dictionaries] are literal because of ... general agreement about their meaning . [which has] become standardized through repetition and consensus" (10). Among scholars in religion, Ricoeur has said the "literal ... mean[s] . . . simply current, 'usual' " (1977:290-91). Soskice has stated, "As a shorthand . .. literal speech is accustomed speech" (1985:69). Such a view focuses on the conventional sense of literal and conflates it with the nonfigurative sense. (2) Macky has argued that the literal is "(communicable) independent use" (1990:39). (Macky's formulations appear to be firmly grounded in speech act theory. He states the literal and figurative are "terms used to describe an aspect of speech, of the use of language in speech acts. Thus they are characteristics of 'speaker's meaning' not of 'stan- dard,' or 'word meaning'" [1990:32].) This definition is an adaptation of a dependent/ independent distinction of word use explicated by Bache cited by Macky (1990:35). Figura- tive language is dependent in that it "require[s] us to understand some other use first" (Macky 1990:36). Independent "uses of words are those that can be understood indepen- dently of other uses" (1990:35). Macky clarifies independent use as that which "designates some observable phenomenon" (1990:35) and which "can apply directly to . . . reality" (1990:39). Those last statements appear to link literal language primarily with what Lakoff has called "truth-conditional literality." 12Although figurative and literal language are distinct, the former is continuous with the latter. 13Admittedly, precision is not always necessary, sometimes the general literal-nonliteral distinction is sufficient. Further, a distinction is not always possible to make, as when one discusses authors who make no distinction.</page><page sequence="6">514 Journal of the American Academy of Religion a word or larger unit, should include the common, customary sense/meaning/interpretation that either transcends or is limited to subject matter. For the discussion that lies ahead, "conven- tional" literal includes metaphor, but metaphor that is no longer novel, it is dead. This anticipates my remarks below (pp. 523-529). The nonfigurative sense/meaning/interpretation of a linguistic unit should be the "directly meaningful" (to use Lakoff's phrase) sense/ meaning/interpretation not understood through something else.14 It contains no metaphor whatsoever. FIRST- AND SECOND-ORDER MEANING Up to this point I have focused on some of the complexities of literal meaning. Now I turn my attention to a theory of meaning for understanding the nonfigurative and metaphor: first- and sec- ond-order meaning. H.P. Grice has offered some helpful distinctions of meaning: (1) timeless meaning(s) of an utterance-type, (2) applied timeless meaning of an utterance-type, (3) occasion-meaning of an utter- ance-type, and (4) utterer's occasion-meaning (1969).15 I offer the utterance {3} The tower is crumbling to illustrate his differentiations. (1) Timeless meaning(s) of an utterance-type includes the speci- fication of the meaning an utterance-type might have. Here one has a range of possibilities. For example, a lower level constituent such as the lexeme 'tower' is composed of various senses: as a noun ("a structure with a high height: low width ratio," such a structure used as a "prison," and so forth) and as a verb ("to rise" 14Here I understand fully that I have not really defined nonfigurative meaning; much more should be said. Space simply does not permit an in-depth discussion, but further investiga- tion can begin, on one side of the spectrum, with some of the works of Katz and Fodor, the first to propose explicitly the integration of syntax and semantics within a Chomskyan framework (Katz and Fodor; Katz 1977 and 1981). At the "speech act" end of the spectrum, one can look at the following: Austin (1975; 1963); Searle (1969; 1978; 1980). A "moder- ate" position is represented by Dascal (1983; 1987). Closer to home in biblical studies, one can look at Barr. 15To alleviate any possible misunderstanding, the phrase "timeless meaning" does not sug- gest that senses and meanings do not change over time. Rather, timeless meaning is time- less in that the current senses and meanings have not been linked in time to a specific utterance.</page><page sequence="7">Long: Dead or Alive? 515 or "stand high," and so forth). The timeless meaning of the entire utterance could be, for example, The tower (composed of masonry material) is crumbling / falling to pieces or The prison is falling apart. (2) Applied timeless meaning of an utterance-type is the specifi- cation of the timeless meaning to be connected with a specific utterance. Here one applies a meaning or sense taken from the range of possibilities. For example, the sense of "tower" in {3} is to be a type of "structure" or, considering the (entire) utterance, the masonry tower in disrepair. (3) Occasion-meaning of an utterance-type is what an utterer meant by the utterance. For example, an utterer may use the word tower in {3} with an occasion-meaning of a "prominent, academic theorist," not a "structure." (4) Utterer's occasion-meaning is what an utterer meant in uttering the utterance. For example, the utterer meant the "promi- nent, academic theorist" for the word tower in (3). Relying on Grice's four distinctions, Eva Kittay has discussed first- and second-order meaning. FIRST-ORDER MEANING occurs when the occasion-meaning of an utterance-type and the utterer's occasion-meaning are identical to the "appropriate" applied timeless meaning.16 SECOND-ORDER MEANING occurs when either the occasion-meaning of an utterance-type or utterer's occasion-meaning diverges from the appropriate applied timeless meaning (43-44). Kittay stresses that first- and second-order meaning distinction is not simply one between nonfigurative and metaphoric language (44). Nonfigurative language such as an indirect speech act has second-order meaning. The first-order meaning of the utterance {4} You're stepping on my foot. would invoke a response like {5} I (didn't) know. {4} is an indirect speech act because of the further message behind it, namely, {6} Get off my foot, (please)! 16Kittay explains her use of "appropriate:" "appropriate is the meaning that coheres with the linguistic and situational context of the utterance" (43n5).</page><page sequence="8">516 Journal of the American Academy of Religion This is second-order meaning.17 Perhaps a more significant example that first- / second-order meaning is not solely nonfigurative/metaphoric meaning is seen by comparing simile with metaphor. Without attempting here to define simile in detail, I reserve the term to refer to cross-categori- cal comparisons, comparisons involving two different semantic fields.18 Nonfigurative comparisons are inner-categorical, that is, they are comparisons within a single semantic field. Simile may be exemplified by {7} An education is like a stairway, nonfigurative comparison by {8} A scalpel is like a razor. Simile, defined (incompletely) as a comparison that crosses seman- tic fields, is regarded as figurative comparison. (Novel) metaphors are also figurative. Though both may be considered figurative lan- guage, simile has first-order meaning while (novel) metaphor has second-order meaning (see Kittay:17-19, 140-56, esp. 142-3 and 143nl). Simile, which includes the lexeme "like," however it be graphetically instantiated in biblical Hebrew (e.g., k, kmw, dmh), is figurative because it brings together two (widely) divergent seman- tic fields. But simile has first-order meaning because the occasion- meaning of the utterance-type and the utterer's occasion-meaning are identical to an appropriate applied timeless meaning. (Novel) metaphor has second-order meaning. 17To illustrate Grice's distinctions further, we can look at these last three utterances. The applied timeless meaning of {4} can be characterized as a statement that describes to a receiver that the receiver's foot or feet is/are placed down on top of the utterer's foot. If {4} were not an indirect speech act, that is, the utterer had no other intent than simply to inform the receiver of the condition of foot on top of foot, and if the receiver understood it only as such, then the receiver would respond with {5}. In that case, what the utterer meant by the utterance (occasion-meaning of an utterance-type) and what (s)he meant in uttering the utter- ance (utterer's occasion-meaning) are identical to the applied timeless meaning. But now considering {4} as an indirect speech act, the utterer does not simply wish to inform the receiver of the foot-stepping condition. Rather, in uttering the utterance, the utterer is telling the receiver to get off the former's foot. That is, what the utterer meant in uttering the utterance (utterer's occasion-meaning) is that the receiver is to remove his/her foot/feet from the utterer's. Here then, at least utterer's occasion-meaning has diverged from the applied timeless meaning, thus second-order meaning. 181 offer a detailed definition and explanation in Simile and Metaphor in the Song of Songs (working tile), which I am currently writing.</page><page sequence="9">Long: Dead or Alive? 517 Kittay also contends that her distinction is more than a replica- tion of a sentence/speaker's meaning distinction embellished to account for linguistic units ranging from words to discourse. If speaker's meaning designates the speaker's intentions, Kittay argues that speaker's meaning is not germane to metaphor (or indi- rect speech acts for that matter); metaphoric use of language is not always dependent on the intentions of the speaker (1987:44-46). For example, if one were to find the single utterance {9} Your eyes are doves ('ynyk ywnym, Cant 4:1) within Jerrold Katz and Jerry Fodor's "anonymous letter," I can only think that one would suspect metaphoric language.19 One could construct a situation in which doves were used to refer to, or represent eyes, such as in a work of art. But the point is that one is clued into the metaphoricity of {9} without a knowledge of speaker's meaning.20 Kittay believes that Grice's distinctions of meaning can sup- plant the sentence/speaker dichotomy. Grice's timeless meaning of an utterance-type and applied timeless meaning of an utterance- type are akin to sentence meaning, and utterer's occasion-meaning matches speaker's meaning, but his interjection of occasion-mean- ing of utterance-type is most important to Kittay. Though Grice contends that the occasion-meaning of utterance-type can ulti- mately be subsumed under utterer's occasion-meaning, Kittay argues for the necessity of distinguishing the two (45-49). After setting out her argument, Kittay concludes, My point is that, while the utterer's intention, that is, the utterer's occasion meaning, often coincides with the occasion meaning of the utterance-type, it need not do so. In speaking of metaphor . .. and, those cases in which we can distinguish what is said from what is meant in some systematic fashion, and in which what is meant is dependent on, though not 19The "anonymous letter situation is the case where an ideal speaker of a language receives an anonymous letter containing just one sentence of that language, with no clue whatever about motive, circumstances of transmission, or any other factor relevant to understanding the sentence on the basis of its context of utterance" (Katz 1977:14; the phrase was used in Katz and Fodor). 20Here Macky has overstated the role of speaker's meaning in nonfiguration and figuration (1990:esp. 18-19, 31-32). Considering metaphor, I certainly agree that it is a (linguistic) pragmatic phenomenon, as Macky emphasizes. However, I believe Kittay has successfully shown that metaphor is also a semantic phenomenon.</page><page sequence="10">518 Journal of the American Academy of Religion coincident with, what is said, we ought to distinguish the occasion meaning of the utterance-type from any applied timeless meaning and from the utterer's occasion meaning, that is, from actual inten- tions of an actual utterer. These considerations indicate the need for a linguistic theory not only to account for how we get conven- tional meanings, . . but also to account for how we can have meaning distinct both from the conventional senses of words and from the particular actual intentions an utterer has when produc- ing the utterance. (47, 49; emphasis hers) First- and second-order meaning addresses these issues and cor- rectly views the relationship of figurative language as continuous with, and yet distinct from, nonfigurative/conventional language. METAPHORICITY AND THE ANCIENTS The Awareness of Nonfigurative and Figurative Language A foundational question is whether the ancients were aware that they used what we today call metaphor.21 Frederick Ferre has argued that the Greeks were the first to recognize a distinction between nonfigurative uses of religious language and metaphor: [T]he aim of the philosophic movement in Greek culture was to provide rational and (in intention, at least) literal theory for the understanding of the universe. Such an aim . . . is ... the logical prerequisite for the discovery of metaphor in religious discourse. Only when there is a theory about what is 'literally so' can there be explicit recognition of... metaphorical.... (3.203) Most of the Hebrew Bible, in his view, illustrates "unself-conscious imagery" (3.201). Not until the advent of the Bible's apocalyptic genre were images "consciously constructed with an esoteric signifi- cance known only to the initiates" (3.202; emphasis mine). The Greeks, he affirms, influenced the later writers of the Hebrew Bible so that "by the time Daniel was being written (ca. 166 B.C.) in Hellenized Palestine, the conscious distinction between levels of religious meaning had clearly been made" (3.202). Critiquing Ferre, Soskice argues, 21Soskice treats the issue in some detail and interacts with other scholars (71-83).</page><page sequence="11">Long: Dead or Alive? 519 It is difficult to believe that the prophets, although perhaps lacking a developed set of grammatical distinctions which enabled them to designate metaphors as metaphors, were unaware that in speaking of God as a herdsman or planter [metaphors Ferre uses in his argu- ment] they were using language not strictly appropriate to him. (77) Her appeal to experience as a rebuttal to Ferre is a natural response, and she backs it up with a few biblical metaphors, cited by Ferre himself, that open his thesis to criticism. One could sys- tematically review evidence of metaphoric awareness from each of the cultures of the ancient Near East, but that is best left for another time.22 Instead, I shall focus on evidence within the Hebrew Bible and evidence from Ugarit, the latter being but one example of a culture that predates the writing of the former. Metaphor and Deity at Ugarit Marjo Korpel's significant and stimulating monograph has focused attention on the metaphoric language for the divine among Ugaritic and biblical writers. Korpel addresses whether the ancients in Ugarit and Judah/Israel knew that they were using met- aphors to describe the divine (82-87). Most telling for Korpel is the Ugaritic description of Ba'l's pal- ace. After building the structure on Mt. Sapan (located 40 km from Ugarit) with earthly, apparently nonfigurative materials (cedar, brick, silver, gold, etc.), the god allows a window to be con- structed.23 When the window is in place, the metaphoric character of the palace is revealed: the window appears as an opening in the clouds (Korpel:82-3, 620; KTU 1.4 VII:15-32; de Moor 1987:62-3 1. 15-32). This is compelling evidence, for Korpel, because it indi- cates that the myth-teller was aware of the metaphoric language for Ba'l and his palace. The clouds that gather on Mt. Sapan comprise the storm-god's palace. The other-worldness of the construction is 22One may note de Moor's assessment of metaphoric language in Egypt. Looking at New Kingdom hymns to Amun-Re, de Moor states, "The Egyptians were well aware of the fact that this theriomorphic expression [Amun-Re as Bull] was nothing but metaphor, as was the case with anthropomorphic metaphors . . . ." (1990:48-9). Also, Geller gives evidence that Meso- potamian scribes were conscious of their use of what we call metaphor and simile, though his evidence is not restricted to expressions about deities (x-xiii). 23For the Ugaritic text see KTU (Dietrich, Loretz, and Sanmartin) 1.4 V:10, 11; KTU 1.4 V:18. For a translation, see de Moor 1987:55 1. 10-11, 18.</page><page sequence="12">520 Journal of the American Academy of Religion revealed. Further, Ugaritians could see that no deity, no Ba'l, phys- ically or nonfiguratively dwelt on the mountain in a palace of cedar, brick, gold, and other material; yet the myth affirms this. Further, Ba'l, as a storm-god, is associated with lightening, brq.24 But the myth-teller also seems to describe lightening as an 'arz bymnh "cedar-(lance) in his [Ba'l] right hand.""25 Are we to think that the ancients in observing lightening could not recognize that it was not a nonfigurative wooden lance? The myth-teller apparently associates Ba'l with nonfigurative and figurative lighten- ing (brq and 'arz respectively).26 Considering these bits of evi- dence, I believe it most likely, along with Korpel, that Ugaritians 24RS 24.245:3-4: Ba'l is described as sitting on his mountain and associated with him at that scene are 9b't brqm [1 [ ] "seven lightening-flashes ... (4) tmnt 'isr r't eight storehouses of thunder, 's brq y[ ] a shaft of lightening..." For a commentary on this text and possible restorations in the lacunae see Pardee (chap. 3). KTU 1.4 V:8-9 describes Ba'l as designating the time for (8) wtn qlh b'rpt "his uttering within the clouds, (9) 9rh l'ars brqm his letting loose lightening-flashes to earth." 25KTU 1.4 VII:41; de Moor (1987:64, 1. 41). De Moor says of 'arz, "The shaft of his speak- like thunderbolt," (64n290). Here one may note the limestone stele discovered at Ras Shamra in 1932 (Louvre AO 15.775; for a photograph and the first description see Schaef- fer:123-24 and pl. XVI). In bas-relief it depicts a standing god (he wears a horned helmet) brandishing, in his right hand, a mace above his head and holding, in his left hand, a lance, with branches, pointed downward to the ground. Schaeffer identified the god as "Hadad ou Baal de la montagne, commandant aux orages et aux vents" (123). The lance could well be the representation of lightening as 'arz "cedar-(lance)." (Based on cognate languages, one would fully expect Ugaritic ymn to mean "right hand." With that in mind, it is interesting that the god on the stele has the lance in his left hand.) 26Associated with lightening, Korpel believes that the words for "thunder" show metaphoric awareness (83). The writer refers to thunder nonfiguratively with the word r't, "thunder," but also as Ba'l's ql, 'voice' (for r't see RS 24.245:4 [text and translation given above in my n.24]; for ql see KTU 1.4 V:8 [text and translation given above in my n.24]; KTU 1.19 1:45-46 bl tbn ql b'Z "without the goodness/delight of Ba'l's voice," in a context of weather phenom- ena). However, I do not find this as convincing as the palace-tale or lightening. If thunder were the only piece of evidence at Ugarit, I see little to prevent one from thinking that the Ugaritians really did consider thunder to be Ba'l's voice and that within this phenomenon's semantic field was r't, referring to the phenomenon's shaking, trembling characteristic (if the root is R'D) or perhaps to its sound (if the root is RW'). (The root R'M is also possible but, from the perspective of Ugaritic phonology, is the least likely of the three since the fem. sing. morpheme affixed to a base whose root is RW' is unproblematic [-'(a)t-/], while */- dt-/ &gt; /-tt-/, which occurs if the root is R'D, makes a stronger argument than */-mt-/ &gt; /-tt/ with the root R'M.) Of course, once it is established from other evidence that there was metaphoric awareness, it becomes more likely that thunder as Ba'l's voice was known by the writer to be what we call metaphor.</page><page sequence="13">Long: Dead or Alive? 521 understood that they were using what we today call figuration, more specifically, metaphor. Metaphor and Deity in the Hebrew Bible That Ugaritians distinguished figurative and nonfigurative lan- guage is not an unimportant point-it establishes that another cul- ture was aware of a distinction long before the contents of the Hebrew Bible were committed to writing. But one should not uncritically assume the same for the writers of the Hebrew Bible without considering some evidence. Some writers are explicit about an aspect of their God's other- ness-his nonhumanness. In Hos 11:9c one reads, "For I am God, not a mortal" (ky '1 'nky wl'-'y?). Here, judging from the co-text, one sees that the deity's otherness is, in part, the resolve not to destroy Ephraim. In Num 23:19a-b one reads, "God is not mortal that he should lie, or a human being that he should change his mind" (1' 'ys '1 wykzb wbn-'dm wytnhm). Another aspect of otherness is affirmed by the inability of humans to contain God in a dwelling. In Solomon's dedicatory prayer one reads that all the heavens cannot contain YHWH, much less a temple (1 Kgs 8:27). In Isa 66:1 YHWH says that since the sky is his throne and the earth his footstool, humans cannot pro- vide an adequate house or resting-place. Throughout the Hebrew Bible, God is, from the modern reader's perspective, anthropomorphized and anthropopathized. One reads of his eyes, arms, and anger. He is a vine-planter (he planted (the people of)Jerusalem!) (Jer 2:21). In Lam 3:13 the poet says of God that "He shot arrows from his quiver into my vitals" (hby' bklywty bny 'sptw), anthropomorphic warrior imagery. Yet in Lam 3:10 one reads, "He is a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in hiding" (db 'rb hw' ly 'ryh bmstrym), theriomorphic language. Here in close proximity the writer speaks of God as a warrior, a bear, and a lion. God is also physiomorphized: Deut 4:24 "For YHWH your God is a devouring fire" (ky yhwh 'lhyk 's 'klh); Jer 2:13b-c "[My people] have forsaken me, a source/fountain of flowing water" ('ty 'zbw mqwr mym hyym). Such descriptions of form lead me to consider the admonition in Deut 4:15ff. Here, of course, the people are instructed that since they had not seen a form when YHWH spoke out of the fire at Horeb, they were not to make images in any form: not the likeness of a man, a woman, or crea-</page><page sequence="14">522 Journal of the American Academy of Religion tures of the land, sky, and sea. Whether one sees this passage as a record of Moses' speech, as the polemics of religious leaders during Josiah's reign, or whatever, it reveals an understanding that YHWH was Other. YHWH took no form on this most important occasion; no form, then, could adequately, or should, depict him. Yet the ubiquity of what modern readers call metaphor among the writers of the Hebrew Bible for their God is testimony that through such figuration God, the Other, was comprehensible. The juxtaposition of concrete and abstract is not insignificant.27 In Isa 59:17b one reads, "A helmet of salvation/victory is on his [YHWH] head" (wkwb' ySw'h br'Sw). The psalmist in Ps 93:1a-b claims, "YHWH reigns, clothed with majesty; YHWH is clothed, girded with strength" (yhwh mlk g'wt lbs lbs yhwh 'z ht'zr) (see also Isa 51:9; Pss 65:7; 104:1, 2). The writers were well acquainted with a physical piece of armor, and they could speak of an abstract/ intangible notion such as salvation without linking it to a physical item.28 But claiming that YHWH's armor or his clothes are com- posed of intangible notions shows the writers' awareness of figura- tion to say something meaningful about their deity.29 One may note in passing that in Proverbs (1-9), Canticles, and Lamentations, for example, the writers used figuration knowingly to describe wisdom, a lover, and a city-things that did not directly involve deity.30 If figuration was used knowingly for topics not concerned with deity, I do not think it altogether unlikely that it was used knowingly for deity. In the previous section, I affirmed, with Korpel, that the writ- ings of another culture, writings that predate any of the writing of the Hebrew Bible, demonstrate an awareness that what we call fig- uration was used to speak of gods. With that established, the same could hold true for writings of a later time from another culture. Indeed, I have tried to show passages within the Hebrew Bible that acknowledge explicitly a thorough otherness of the deity: an other- ness that was not human, that could not be confined, and that at 27Korpel uses this as part of her evidence (86). 281 Sam 17:5 (of Goliath) 'He had a bronze helmet on his head' (kwb' nhgt 'l-r'?w); Gen 49:18 'YHWH, I await your salvation' (lyfw'tk qwyty yhwh). 29For more on intangible notions as clothing see Brongers. 301n Cant 5:2 the woman quotes the man as saying, "Open to me, my sister, my dear, my dove, my flawless one" (pthy-ly 'hty r'yty ywnty tmty). The writer certainly knows that the woman is not a nonfigurative dove. The desolate city in Lamentations is not a nonfigurative widow for the writer; wisdom is not a nonfigurative lady in Prov 1-9.</page><page sequence="15">Long: Dead or Alive? 523 least on one occasion had no form, the latter leading to an admoni- tion about worship. These passages, particularly the assertion and admonition in Deut 4:15ff about YHWH and form, along with a historical precedent for awareness, indicate that the writers of the Hebrew Bible were aware that they used language we today call figurative and, to be more specific, figures of speech we call meta- phors. That being true, I move on to consider whether their meta- phors had first- or second-order meaning. GOD-METAPHORS IN THE HEBREW BIBLE: FIRST- OR SECOND-ORDER MEANING? The biblical writers knowingly used (what we call) metaphors to talk of God. But metaphors that are at one time novel become conventional through repetition. The more they are used, the more they become conventional, and this may proceed until their "death."31 As metaphoric language becomes conventional, it becomes a sense within timeless meaning so that an applied time- less meaning, an occasion-meaning, and an utterer's occasion- meaning may coincide-first-order meaning. Thus a novel meta- phor-second-order meaning-as it becomes more conventional moves toward first-order meaning. Even a phrase will in time be treated as a single lexical item with first-order meaning.32 Meta- phors can become conventional, that is, they may become literal, remembering, of course, the distinction of conventional literal and nonfigurative literal discussed above.33 31Burbules, Schraw, and Trathen give three stages in the "evolution of metaphorical inter- pretation": "Fresh metaphors (e.g., 'Freud was the midwife of silences') .... Frozen metaphors (e.g., 'He is burned up') .... Dead metaphors (e.g., 'She kicked the bucket') ... ." (106). Ch. Bally has classified metaphors according to their "valeur expressive": "l'image .vocatrice, imaginatrice," "l'image affective ou affaiblie," or "l'image morte" (Traite de stylistique fran.aise, ?? 202ff., quoted by Henry:214). See also Soskice (71-72). 32For example, "pushing up (the) daisies." 33In addition to scholars I have already mentioned, namely Lakoff and Kittay, Scheffler states, "Metaphorical use . . . fades into literal use; metaphors die" (80). Goodman also affirms that metaphor becomes more literal as its novelty wanes (68). Dascal, reacting against experiments of Gibbs, who claims to show that the processing of the nonliteral inter- pretation of utterances (with co-text) takes no longer than "literal" interpretation (Gibbs), states that "all these experiments make use of conventionalized indirect speech-acts, or idio- matic expressions or else frozen metaphors.... [T]hey provide excellent evidence for the fact that . .. the notion of literal meaning, namely conventionality, is rather important. ... [T]hese experiments therefore lead to the conclusion that such conventionalized (wrongly called non-literal) meanings of many utterances are in fact the literal ones" (Dascal 1987:267).</page><page sequence="16">524 Journal of the American Academy of Religion But no matter how conventional, or "dead," a metaphor may become, it still remains a metaphor. Kittay considers the phrase, "leg of a table" (89). Few metaphors are as dead or worn-out as this one. Yet Victorians resuscitated the phrase-tablecloths were to be long enough to avoid infelicitously exposing a table "leg."34 Death and revivification of metaphors also can play a chief role in puns and jokes. As Kittay has said, "This is what characterizes them as dead metaphors rather than as new lexical items" (143; emphasis hers). Kittay adds the following: The conventional metaphor may, then, be viewed as falling within first-order analysis when its dormant double semantic import is either fully forgotten by the generally competent speaker (a genu- inely dead metaphor) or for practical linguistic purposes safely disregarded. It requires a second-order analysis when it carries the burden of its double semantic import, that is, when it is placed in a setting in which its original literal meaning is highlighted and may be seen as incongruous in the context of the utterance.35 Did the metaphors for God among the writers of the Hebrew Bible have first- or second-order meaning?36 An absolute answer is elusive-such a question can only best be posed to a living inform- ant. But working on the assumption that in ancient studies one has to work with whatever one has,37 I wish to suggest sets of crite- ria for determining whether the biblical writers' metaphors for God more likely had first- or second-order meaning:38 (1) If the metaphoric expression in question has parallels in other ancient Near Eastern cultures and/or in other passages of the Hebrew Bible, and it DOES NOT offer a substantially meaning- ful difference from its parallels, the metaphor is likely to have first-order meaning. 34Revivication of metaphor has been treated in greater detail by Henry (213-227). 351987:89. See also Soskice (73, 74). 36Bourguet has said, "La distinction entre catachrese et metaphore me parait particuliere- ment important pour ce qui est du vocabulaire que s'applique a Dieu," and he offers a discussion (20ff). Though the focus is not on God-metaphors, Wansbrough has expressed interest in plotting how alive or dead a metaphor in Semitic literature may be. This leads him to an analysis of the Semitic root 'TM (103-16). Macky distinguishes between "artistic" and "expository" biblical metaphors; tie latter, in part, being "standard ... not novel," the former, in part, being "relatively novel rather than standard, something the author made up, not just a part of conventional speech" (1988:168-9). 37Dennis Pardee introduced this assumption to me. A similar assumption has been expressed in Thomas Lambdin's festschrift title, Working with No Data. 38Another list of criteria may be seen in Beekman and Callow (133-4).</page><page sequence="17">Long: Dead or Alive? 525 (2) If the metaphoric expression in question has parallels in other ancient Near Eastern cultures and/or in other passages of the Hebrew Bible, and it DOES offer a substantially meaningful difference from its parallels, the metaphor is likely to have sec- ond-order meaning. One is able to find some valuable works to assist in determin- ing whether a metaphor meets the criteria of one of these sets. Korpel, for example, has assembled the metaphors for divinity used at Ugarit and compared them with the Hebrew Bible. She states that of 1454 Ugaritic expressions for divinity and the divine world 711 seem to have a counterpart in the Hebrew Bible (621). She has grouped these expressions into three major categories: anthropomorphic, theriomorphic, and physiomorphic descriptions (88-613). Leo Perdue also has assembled metaphors with biblical and ancient Near Eastern parallels, grouping them within two major spheres of cosmology and anthropology (32-72). Also help- ful are works by Marc Brettler, Manfried Dietrich and Oswald Loretz, Helga Weippert, Manfred Weippert, H.A. Brongers, and Yochanan Muffs. One must go beyond linguistic parallels, though. Othmar Keel,39 Silvia Schroer, and Thorkild Jacobsen, for example, have shown the value of iconography as an avenue of inquiry. Though far less certain than textual evidence, iconography can provide insight into the ancients' concepts of divinity, such as the stele found at Ras Shamra (see above in footnote 25). The metaphors I have in mind that meet the first set of criteria involve little more than the replacement of a divine name in well- establishing metaphors. So, for example, instead of thunder being Ba'l's voice, it is YHWH's (KTU 1.4 V:8; Ps 29:3; Jer 10:13). God in the Hebrew Bible has, for example, eyes, a tongue, and fingers like other deities.40 In set (1) I speak of metaphoric expressions that do not offer a "substantially meaningful difference" from their par- allels. Ascribing to YHWH/Elohim what has been ascribed to 391985. Keel has also assembled iconographic evidence for providing insight into the meta- phoric language for humans in Canticles (1984). 40Eyes: the clause, "He did what was right/wrong in YHWH's opinion [lit. in the eyes of YHWH]" (wy'S hygr/hr 'b'yny yhwh), found, for example, throughout 2 Kgs, is certainly one of the deadest of metaphoric utterances (cf. KTU 1.2 IV:22 = de Moor 1987:40 of Nahar; KTU 1.101:5 = de Moor 1987:2 of Tallay); tongue: Isa 30:27 (cf. KTU 1.5 11:3 = de Moor 1987:71 of Mot); finger; Exod 31:18 of Elohim (cf. KTU 1:3 11:33-35 = de Moor 1987:7 of 'Anat).</page><page sequence="18">526 Journal of the American Academy of Religion other deities is meaningful, but these are metaphors that offer no new significant insight about the deity-a rather exact adoption has taken place. An example of a metaphor that meets the criteria of set (2) is YHWH=HUSBAND.41 The writings from the ancient Near East establish the idea that gods and goddesses could be spouses to one another.42 But YHWH=HUSBAND is a metaphor that offers a sub- stantially meaningful difference from its parallels in other cultures. One first encounters the metaphor in Hosea, where the idea of a legal marriage between YHWH and his chosen people is estab- lished.43 A deity regarded as the husband of a collective people is, so far as I know, unknown in the ancient Near East. The metaphor here, then, is a significant adaptation of marriage between deities, and specifically an adaptation of such marriage found in the Canaanite tradition.44 Hans Wolff makes the point that in Hosea's "eristic appropriation, the sexual aspect [of the idea/metaphor], so important in Canaanite thinking, was excluded with respect to Yahweh" (16). Further, marriage in Hosea expresses the covenant relationship between YHWH and his people and with it notions of obedience (Ostborn:80-2; Hall 1983). Those are meaningful and 41Hos 2; Jer 3; Isa 50:1 (mentions 'divorce document' (spr krytwt]); 54:4-6; 62:5; Ezek 16, 23. For a recent thorough treatment of this metaphor, based on the metaphor COVE- NANT=MARRIAGE, see Adler. 42For Mesopotamia, Jacobsen treats courtship and weddings among the gods as "4th Mil- lennium Metaphors" (27-47). See Korpel's discussion and bibliography for Ugaritic evi- dence (225-28). 43But see Schmitt. Schmitt argues that an "idea which I claim as not founded on the Hebrew biblical text is that the God of Israel is linked to Israel in a relationship that is, or should be perceived to be, marital. The wife of God in Hosea 2, according to this 'careless' interpretation, is Israel" (5). Schmitt contends that the wife is the city of Samaria. Schmitt does not make the point, but if he is correct, I would contend that the city is a metonym for the people. What then becomes an issue is how modern interpreters use the term Israel. Wolff speaks of the marriage between "Yahweh ... and Israel, as it occupied the land [empha- sis mine]" (16). It seems to me that Wolff has in mind the occupants of a land and his use of Israel is then metonymic for the people. It appears that Schmitt is not picking up on the metonymic language for the chosen people, both in Hosea and in scholars whose use of the term Israel would parallel Wolff's. Also see Whitt, who claims that the marriage in Hos 2:4-15 is not between YHWH and Israel, but YHWH and Asherah (34, 56ff). It is in Jeremiah, he claims, that the "metaphor of the people as Yahweh's wife first occurs . . ." (34). 44Jacob; see also Emmerson, who speaks of Hosea's "creative use of motifs associated with the fertility cult of Canaan against which his polemic is directed" (25); Mays, the "portrayal of the covenant in terms of Yahweh as husband and Israel as wife . .. is a prime example of his appropriation of themes from the fertility cult" (9); Ostborn, "When speaking of the matrimony between Yahweh and Israel, Hosea obviously alludes to an idea well known ... that of divine marriage which was inherent in Baalism ... ." (79); Wolff (16).</page><page sequence="19">Long: Dead or Alive? 527 substantial differences. Gary Hall has investigated the develop- ment of the marriage metaphor in the Hebrew Bible, showing how Jeremiah's use, grounded in Hosea's, goes beyond the latter's, and how Ezekiel's use "completely transformed" the metaphor (1980 [I have only seen the abstract in DAI 41/09, 4072]). If Hall is correct, he has shown that the metaphor probably met set (2) criteria throughout its use among the prophets. I offer a third set, but I do so reservedly: (3) If the metaphoric expression in question has NO precise paral- lels in other ancient Near Eastern cultures, the metaphor's first occurrence in the Hebrew Bible is likely to be second-order meaning; subsequent uses would fall within either set (1) or (2). My reservation stems mainly from the difficult task of discovering with certainty a metaphor's inaugural use in the Hebrew Bible.45 Leaving that aspect aside for the moment, GOD=GO'EL ("kinsman- redeemer") can be offered as a metaphor without known parallel in the ancient Near East (for example, Ps 19:15; Isa 43:14; 44:24; 49:7; Jer 50:34). The Hebrew root G'L has a cognate that appears in an Amorite personal name and a cognate in Aramaic.46 The attestations in the latter, though, are based on biblical usage. Recently, Andre Lemaire has argued that the root is attested in a recently discovered Phoenician inscription, but elsewhere I have rejected his argument on philological grounds. So, with the excep- tion of an Amorite personal name, the root is exclusively used in the Hebrew Bible and in literature dependent on its usage there. Whether kinsman-redeemer practice as represented in the Hebrew Bible existed in like manner in other ancient Near Eastern cultures is unclear. Similarities do seem to exist, but direct parallels are not as certain. What is clear is that no other culture used a cognate of the Hebrew root G'L to refer to the human practice, let alone used one to describe the action of a deity.47 GOD=GO'EL, then, is a 45We have already confronted this in the metaphor of YHWH = the husband of a chosen people, see Whitt's comment above in footnote 43. 46Ga-i-la-lum (cited by Huffmon:179; Jastrow 1.202). 47For more on how the human practice in the Hebrew Bible compares with the idea of God as go'el, I refer the reader to Daube (39-61); he demonstrates how particular functions of the human kinsman-redeemer are applied to God but also concludes that specific nuances in many cases cannot be inferred; North (esp. 3-8); Stuhlmueller 1970 (99-131): after treating the practice of go'el in pre-exilic tradition (where he lists the redemptive acts as redemption of slaves, redemption of property, redemption from harm caused by murder, and redemp-</page><page sequence="20">528 Journal of the American Academy of Religion metaphor whose first graphic attestation is to be found in the Hebrew Bible. Yet, to whom does one credit first use? To what extent can its occurrence in ldwd ("Pertaining to David") psalms be regarded as Davidic in source (Pss 19:15; 69:19; 103:4)? Should the attestation in Hos 13:14 be attributed to the eighth-century prophet or to someone later?48 J.J. Stamm argues that Deutero- Isaiah was the first to claim YHWH as gd'el (31-44, esp. 41); Fred- erick Holmgren believes that writers before Deutero-Isaiah regarded God as gd'el but that the "full development of this bold idea was the unique contribution of Deutero-Isaiah" (43-44; emphasis mine). On it goes! I return to the question of whether the God-metaphors of the biblical writers had first- or second-order meaning. To rephrase it, one could ask whether the biblical writers' metaphoric expressions were still "alive," having second-order meaning. An expression meeting set (1) criteria most likely has first- order meaning since it is among the standardized or conventional god-talk used within other ancient Near Eastern cultures. An expression fulfilling the criteria of either set (2) or (3) is only more likely to have second-order meaning. After all, an expression might have been used in speech long before it occurred graphically. When first used, it would have been second-order meaning; through continual use without meaningful difference it would pro- ceed toward first-order meaning. But the graphic analysis could offer appropriately restrained conclusions about an expression's journey between second-and first-order meaning. One must keep in mind, though, that even a first attestation, or an only attesta- tion, could not be proven beyond absolute doubt to have second- order meaning. But working with what we have, an expression's occurrence where it offers a substantially meaningful difference from other use would much more likely be a candidate for second- order meaning than would one meeting set (1) criteria. tion for a husband without a male heir [p. 101-4], he shows that the kinsman-redeemer relationship between YHWH and the people according to Deutero-Isaiah can be classified as (1) YHWH as Israel's kinsman in general (g'l used only to strengthen the bond between YHWH and the people), (2) YHWH as a redeemer from slavery, and (3) YHWH "according to the image of the gd'el-spouse" (106, 105-31). For a more theological reflection on the g6'el, see Hubbard. 48Yee considers 13:14 the product of "R2" (248, 257, 299, 317), the final redactor, for whom the "exile is already a reality" (259).</page><page sequence="21">Long: Dead or Alive? 529 The writers of the Hebrew Bible spoke metaphorically about God. It is difficult to know with absolute certainty whether the metaphoric expressions had for them first- or second-order mean- ing. But considering the sets of criteria above, I believe that one can state when it is plausible that a metaphoric expression had first- or second-order meaning. Where first-order meaning occurs, the metaphoric expression can be considered literal. But from the discussion above, I am not saying that it is nonfigurative, only that it is conventional and even subject conventional.
