<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIII. -THE VISION DELECTABLE OF ALFONSO DE LA TORRE AND MAIMONIDES'S GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED The Visi'6n Delectable was composed by Alfonso de la Torre, probably between the years 1430 and 1440, at the request of don Juan de Beamonte, for the instruction of the young Prince Carlos of Viana. This work, which gained its author the epithet of el gran filosofo among his contemporaries, was published about the year 1480 and subsequently appeared in several Castilian editions.' It was translated into Catalan in 1484, and into Italian by Domenico Delphini in 1556, without mention of the origi- nal author. This Italian version was re-translated into Spanish by a Spanish Jew, Francisco de Caceres, and published at Frankfort in 1623.2 The book treats in allegorical form the Seven Liberal Arts of the medieval curriculum, and also the chief prob- lems of scholastic philosophy, theology, ethics, and politics. While meditating upon his work, the author falls into a deep sleep, and sees in a vision the threatened destruction 1 The earliest edition known was probably printed at Zamora about the year 1480.

Suddenly the maiden, Gramatica, appears and also the child Entendimiento, whom she received and instructs in the mysteries of her art. The first six chap- ters of the First Part describe Entendimiento's ascent of the mountain and his visits to the dwellings of Logic, Rhetoric, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astrology, thus completing his instruction in the Seven Liberal Arts. I have shQwn in another article 1 that Alfonso de la Torre was indebted to the Anticlaudianus of Alanus de Insulis for most, of his allegorical material, and that the chapters on grammar, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, and music are derived from Isidore of Seville's Etymologiae., The chapter on logic is borrowed from Al-Ghazzali's treatise on that subject included in his Maka-sid al-Faldsifa, which was translated into Latin about the middle of the twelfth century by Dominicus Gundisalvi. I wish to show here that chapters eight to nineteen of the First Part, which discuss the most important questions of scholastic philoso- phy and theology, are derived from the Moreh Nebuchim or Guide of the Perplexed of Maimonides, the greatest of all Jewish philosophers.2 ' The Seven Liberal Arts in the Visi6n Delectable of Alfonso de la Torre, Romanic Review, Vol. iv. 2 Sr. Mendndez y Pelayo in his Origines de la Novela, Vol. I, p. cxxiv, says of the Visi6n Delectable: "Como texto de lengua cienti- fica, no tiene rival dentro del siglo XV; la grandeza sintttica de la concepci6n infunde respeto; algunos trozos 8on de altisima elocn-- encia, y la novedad y atrevimiento de algunas de sue ideas merecen consideraci6n atenta, que en lugar mde oportuno penedmos dedi- carlas."

P. WICKERSHAM CRAWFORD Moses ben Maimon, or Maimonides, as he is more gene- rally called, was born March 30, 1135 at Cordova, the cen- ter of intellectual activity of Arabs and Jews in the Middle Ages.1 His father, Maimon ben Joseph, was descended from a family of scholars, and was himself a learned Tal- mudist, mathematician, and astronomer. Early in life, the young Moses devoted himself to the study of the Bible, the Talmud, natural sciences, and mathematics, but the times were not conducive to the peaceful development of science and philosophy. In 1148, when he was thirteen years old, Cordova was captured by the fanatical Almohades, and both Jews and Christians were given the choice of em- bracing Islam, exile, or death. It is believed that his family preferred exile, and after many trials and hard- ships, settled at Fez (1160) and later (1165) at Fostat. near Cairo, where Maimonides completed his famous com- mentary on the Mishnah (1168). Although busily occu- pied with the practice of medicine at the court of Saladin, he fouLnd time to continue his theological studies, and there completed in 1190 his Dalalat al-hairin or Guide of the Perplexed, more commonly known by its Hebrew title, to the Visi6n Delectable than appeared on a superficial examination. The credit for the first suggestion of this indebtedness, however, belongs entirely to him.

Like most of his works, it was written in Arabic with Hebrew characters in order to make it more accessible to Jews who had forgotten their own lan- guage. When he died in 1204, his reputation as the greatest Jewish scholar and theologian of his time was firmly established. I need not dwell here upon the many-sided intellectual activity of Maimonides. He made important contribu- tions to the astronomical and medical knowledge of his time. In his Commentary to the Mishnah, he was the first to formulate the creed of Judaism. His codification of the Rabbinical law, entitled Mishneh-Thorah, shows his powers as a dogmatic theologian. It was, however, as the author of the Guide of the Perplexed that he earned the title of the Jewish Aristotle, and this work still remains one of the most important contributions to Jewish theology. He was well acquainted with Aristotelian philosophy through the medium of the Arabic commentators, as well as with ancient Jewish literature. He had amassed a rich store of philosophical knowledge which he determined to employ in the service of Judaism. He believed that Jewish theological doctrines agreed with the results ob- tained by philosophy, and attempted in this work to reconcile the Old Testament and the teachings of Aristotle. The Guide at once attracted great attention, and was translated during his lifetime and with his co-operation, into Hebrew by Rabbi Samuel ibn Tibbon. This trans- lation was completed in 1204 and is a faithful reproduc- tion of the ideas of the master. A few years later it was again translated into Hebrew by the poet Judah Charizi. The poetical gifts of this translator were wholly unsuited to the more serious task of interpreting theology, and his version met with little favor.</page><page sequence="5">192 J. P. WICKERSHAM CRAWFORD It is not within my province to discuss the fate of the Guide in Mohammedan circles, nor the bitter quarrel which it provoked among Jewish theologians, dividing them into two hostile camps,' nor the great influence which it exerted upon the subsequent development of Jewish theology. It had a definite influence upon Christian scho- lasticism, and it may be truly said that no work of a Jewish thinker was so diligently read by Christian scholars during the Middle Ages as the Guide of the Perplexed. A Latin translation of the Guide was composed as early as the first half of the thirteenth century, probably at the request of the Emperor Frederick II, who is known to have been well acquainted with the work. The investiga- tions of Joel and Guttmann have shown that the two celebrated Masters of the Roman Church, Albertus Mag- nus and Thomas Aquinas, owe a great deal to Maimonides, and in many respects it may be said that the Guide of the Perplexed is a precursor of the Summa Theologiae.2 The influence of the Guide is evident in the Speculum Majus of Vincent de Beauvais and in the works of Duns Scotus.

WICKERSHAM CRAWFORD Delectable, I wish to show the indebtedness of Alfonso de la Torre to the famous work of Maimonides. When En- tendimiento reaches the dwelling of Astrologia (Part I, Chapter vri), he is denied admittance until he strips him- self completely of the sordid vestments of false doctrines. On being asked the reason of his coming, Entendimienta replies that he desires to learn the truth concerning the universe, the certainty of the existence of God and of the end and purpose of man. Razon praises the excellence of true knowledge, and Entendimiento expresses surprise that kings, noblemen, and knights do not attain this. Raz6n then declares the five reasons why men do not learn the truth and certainty of things: (1) Ignorance of the purpose and end of creation; (2) Pleasures of the body dull the spiritual and intellectual senses; (3) Incapacity for learning; (4) Difficulty of acquiring knowledge; (5) Men cling to things learned in childhood. The children of Moors hate Christianity, and peasants detest cities and the refinements of civilized life.' En- tendimiento is warned that he may not enter until he has banished all such preconceived notions, and he promises to do so, declaring: No me movera mas la verdad dicha por la boca del cristitano que del judto o6 moro o gentil, si verdades sean todas, ni negare menos la falsia dicha por la boca de uno que por la boca de otro, showing a tolerance 1 In the auide, I, Chap. xxxi, 108-9, Maimonides quotes Alexander of Aphrodisias to the effect that there are three causes which pre- vent men from acquiring knowledge: (1) arrogance and vain glory; (2) the subtlety and difficulty of any subject; (3) ignorance and want of capacity to comprehend. Maimonides adds as a fourth cause, habit and training. Villagers do not care for the refine- ments of civilized life, and in the same way a man clings to the opinions formed in his youth. The second cause of Alfonso de la Torre is taken from the G?ide, I, p. 123 and constitutes one of the reasons wlhy metaphysics can not be made popular.</page><page sequence="8">ALFONSO DE LA TORRE AXD MAIMONIDES 195 which was not without danger in the fifteenth centnry.1 Verdad then orders that permission be granted him to enter. Chapter nine is devoted to a description of the alle- gorical figur-es Terdad- and Razon, and of the garden, filled with marvels of all kinds, into which Entendimiento is introduced. Asked why he has come hither, he replies that he wishes to learn the ultimate purpose of the creation of man. He is then conducted to the dwelling of Sabiduria, all formed of precious stones. She proposes to prove to him the existence of God: that He is ruler of the world, thereby refuting the doctrines of fate, chance, and fortune; that God is the beginning and end of all things, and that man was created for eternal happiness, which cannot be attained until after death. Verdad then states in dia- logue form twenty-six propositions to prove the exnstence, unity, and incorporeality of God, the truth of each one of which is accepted by Entendimiento.2 In the eleventh Chapter, Sabiduria gives philosophical proofs of the existence of God, based on the preceding propositions, all of which are found in the same form in the Guide, Part II, Chapter i.A Entendimiento is fully convinced of the existence of God, but asks for evidence of the unity of God. Sabiduri a adduces the following arguments: (1) If there were two or more Gods, either they would be equal in power, or the contrary would be 1 Maimonides shows the same love of truth, regardless of the source, in his Mishneh-Torah. See LAvy, op. cit., p. 9. 2These correspond closely to the twenty-six propositions, by the aid of which the philosophers prove the existence, unity, and incor- poreality of the Primal Cause, quoted by Maimonides in the intro- duction to the Second Part of his work. The last proposition, Que el cielo no es engendrable ni corruptible, is only admitted as an hypothesis by Maimonides to demonstrate his own theory. ' Pp. 11-17.</page><page sequence="9">196 J. P. WICKER5HAM CRAWFORD the case. In the first instance, one of the Gods would be superfluous; in the second, one would be imperfect, which would be an abomination; 1 (2) God is infinite in power, knowledge, and kindness; infinite means incapable of measurement. If there were two infinite Gods, they would be equal; one would be a measure of the other: then neither would be infinite. Entendimiento is thus convinced of the unity of God, but asks whether He may not be one of the heavenly bodies. Sabiduria replies that this has been disproved by the twenty-second proposition,2 namely, that every substance requires an agent for its existence, and continues: Por estas pruebas se prueba que de necesario hay Dios, y es uno; et no es alguno de los cuerpos vi*sibles ni sensibles; antes es uno, incorporeo, invisible, inmortal, omnipotente et bienaventurado. She tells of the Gentiles who wor- shipped the elements and of those who worshipped the sun, moon, and stars: De aquestos fueron los sabios en el tiempo de Abrahan, y estos decian que los bienes deste mundo descendian a los mortales por el sacrificio que facian ar los cielos et a las estrellas, etc., and tells of their absurd beliefs and practices. This is merely an unintelligent summary of Chapter xxix of the Third Part of the Guide, which Maimonides devotes to the Sabean religion of star-worship. Sabiduria then gives I This argument is found in the Guide, I, Chap. Lxxxv, p. 360, as one of the propositions of the Mutakallimfln or Arabic theolo- gians, to prove the unity of God. Maimonides, however, objects that it would not be an imperfection in either deity to act exclusively within his respective province. He treats the belief in the unity of God in the Guide, I, Chaps. L and Li. l in reality it is the twenty-fifth proposition. Cf. Guide, ii, p. 8: "Each compound substance consists of matter and form, and requires an agent for its existence."</page><page sequence="10">ALFONSO DE LA TORRE AND MAIMONIDES 197 a brief account of classical mythology, the greater part of which is borrowed from Isidore of Seville's Etymologiae, Lib. viii, Chapter xi, De Dues Gentium. Fortunately, she adds, God had freed mankind from these errors. The twelfth Chapter deals with the power of G(od. Sa- biduria declares that God's power is limitless and in no way imperfect, but Entendimiento objects that many of the things desired by God do not come to pass, and there- fore his power cannot be limitless. Sabiduria replies: El poder de Dios es en dos maneras, am como se voluntad es en otras dos maneras; ca hay una voluntad de Dios, la cual es comparada et causada, et hay otra absoluta. La absoluta siempre se cumple, la caneada ciimplese segun el complimiento de sus causas. It is a mistake to say that God is not omnipotent because he cannot create another God like unto himself, or because he has no power in matters which imply an evident contradiction. Another mistaken belief is that God, without legitimate cause, could violate the laws of Nature; for if God wishes to create one thing from another, he must first deprive it of its original essence and form, and endow it with a new essence and form. God can do all things which are possible and which do not abrogate his power. This theory that im- possible things are not ascribed to the Creator is developed by Maimonides in the Guide, III, Chapter xv. The paragraph which follows on the omniscience of God is based upon Maimonides's discussion of the same in the utide, III, Chapter xvi. God is omniscient, but not in the way in which men understand this. Sabiduria then explains what is meant by the kindness of God, refuting the opinion of ignorant men that the evils in the world far outnumber the blessings, by the argument that man, who is only an infinitesimal part of the universe, believes</page><page sequence="11">198 J. P. WICKER5HAM CRAWFORD that the whole universe exists only for himself. The author here develops, with additional illustrations, the theory advanced by Maimonides, Guide, IlI, Chapter xii. In the thirteenth Chapter, Sabiduria explains the four false doctrines concermnng the Providence of God, and proves wherein lies their falsity. 1. Some have said that all things in heaven and on earth are subject to chance and fortune, and in their folly they even denied the existence of the Ruler of the world. This blasphemy was refuted by Aristotle. 2. Nothing occurs without cause, and all things are in the same manner caused by God. When a leaf falls, or a spider is trampled upon, or when a fly is killed, it is as much the result of God's will as the destruction of a kingdom, the conflagration of a city, or the death of a multitude of people. This doctrine would imply that precepts are useless and that freedom of action is denied. 3. The Providence of God resides in the separate in- telligences, that is, in the angels, stars, or heavens. Since Divine Providence does not extend beyond the sphere of the moon, the sublunary world is left to chance. 4. All things in the world, both good and evil, are ruled by fate, governed principally bv the constellations and stars. The first of these propositions corresponds to the first of the four theories concerning Divine Providence men- tioned by Maimonides, namely, that there is no Providence at all for anything in the universe; everything is subject to chance.' The second proposition corresponds to the third of Maimonides, namely, that everything is fore- ordained.2 The third proposition and most of the illus- I Guide, III, Chap. xvii, pp. 65-66. 'Guide, III, pp. 68-70.</page><page sequence="12">ALFONSO DE LA TORIE AND MAIMONIDES 199 trations are taken from the second theory of the Philo- sophers, discussed and refuted by Maimonides.' The fourth proposition cited by Alfonso de la Torre, concerning the part played by fate in the affairs of men, is not found in the Guide. The fourth argument mentioned by Mai- monides is that Providence bestows its blessings upon all creatures according to their merits; therefore, all beings, even the lowest animals, if innocently injured or killed, receive compensation in a future life. Maimonides cites as fifth the Jewish doctrine that evils and blessings are bestowed upon men in proportion to their merits. In the fourteenth Chapter, after having dismissed these opinions which are false and yet contain an element of truth, Sabiduria proceeds to expound the true doctrine concerning the Providence of God. Some things are or- dained by God, others are left to fate and Nature, others are subject to the choice and will of men, and others depend uponi chance and fortune.2 God created the world, endowing it with the greatest perfection which it could receive, and then the ailgels with the highest degree of perfection, and after that, the Intelligences and heavenly bodies. He endowed men with reason in order that they might serve him, but since excesses both in man and Nature were inevitable because of the imperfection of the sub- stance, he gave to the planets and other stars authority over all things created and corruptible. Nature then instituted the principle of generation and corruption. By a concrete illustration she shows that the same incident may be imputed to the Providence of God, or to the influence of the planets (fate), or to free-will, or to ever-changing fortune.

WICKERSTAM CRAWFORD ningunos, y damos a' Dios bendito su perficion, et dejamos al fado su constelaciwn, et a la virtud su libertad, et a la fortuna su mutacion. This explanation is not very satis- factory, but the author adds a phrase on the freedom of the will at the end of the Chapter which modifies all that precedes. Los hombres no pueden acusar la Providencia ni el fado ni la fortuna, ca por fuerza es que ellos hayan la culpa en ser malos, y el premio por ser benos; ca en su poder es de hacer lo uno et dejar lo otro. Maimonides believed that men are endowed with free-will, and that in the lower or sublunary portion of the universe, Divine Providence does not extend to the individual members of species except in the case of mankind.' The power of God is again discussed in the fifteenth Chapter. Entendimiento asks why God did not ereate only good things in the world, since he foresaw all good and evil things before the Creation. Sabiduri a replies that God is only omnipotent over all possible things; that corruption is inherent in the substance from which man was created. Man and the world might have been created perfect, except for the imperfections in the substance.2 Chapter sixteen treats of the Creation of the world. Sabiduria declares that only one thing must exist of neces- sity and that all other things have possibility of existence, pues cierto es que toda cosa posible tiene causa por la cual es, et sin aquella no ser'a ast 3 . . . As? es el mundo en respecto de Dios glorioso, et todas las cosas que en el son, que es efecto y cosa producida, o obra de Dios sacada de su Guide, III, Chap. xvii. 2This theory is found in the Guide, III, Chap. vi, pp. 24-25, and Chap. xv. 8 Guide, TI, Chap. xii, p. 57: "It is clear that whenever a thing is produced, an efficient cause must exist for the production of the thing that has not existed previously."</page><page sequence="14">ALFONSO DE LA TORRE AND MAIMONIDES 201 Wo ser a su ser, y su perfecion despues que no era, de Dios recibe la perfecion toda y el ser que tiene.1 By his own volition, God saw that the world could not be created with- out material, efficient and final causes; he created matter, and from it made all things except the Intelligences and angels. He created the heavens from the fifth essence, and imperfect things from matter. Mas en la primera pro- ducion del mundo, todo esto se hizo sin primeria ni post+ rimeria de tiempo ninguno que sea.-2 Entendimiento objects that since man is engendered from man, and matter must be produced from some other matter, how then could God create matter? Sabiduria replies that man errs in judging the past by his own knowledge and tells how difficult it would be to make a boy whose mother had died at his birth, understand the truth concerning conception and gestation. Man has the same difficulty in understanding the actions of God.3 Chapter seventeen discusses the nature of angels or Intelligences. Sabiduria, agreeing with Maimonides, de- clares that there are as many Intelligences as there are movements of the spheres. In understanding they re- semble God and delight in the contemplation of his power, wisdom, kindness, beauty, and glory. They do his will, are immutable, and are not subject to time.4 Entendi- 1 This doctrine of the Creatio ex nihilo is frequently discussed and approved by Maimonides. 2 Maimonides states the same doctrine in the Guide, II, Chap. xni, p. 61, in denying the existence of time before the Creation. 3Guide, II, Chap. XVII, p. 77: " It is quite impessible to infer from the nature which a thing possesses after having passed through all stages of its development, what the condition of the thing has been in the moment when this process commenced; nor does the con- dition of a thing at this moment show what its previous condition has been." The illustration of the child whose mother died in child- birth is taken from the same chapter, pp. 77-79. 'Guide, II, Chap. v. 6</page><page sequence="15">202 J. P. WICKERSHAM CRAWFORD miento asks whether angels can sin, and on receiving a negative reply, objects that those had sinned who tried to become equal to God, yet they did not partake of the cor- rupting substance. Sabiduria replies that her answer must be accepted by faith, and sums up the doctrines concerning the evil spirits. Entendimiento asks regarding the size of angels, and is told that if they were corporeal, they would be like the third part of the world,' but that their virtue extends farther, just as a man's soul extends throughout his whole body. The term " angel " means messenger, and all prophets sent to the world were angels.2 Entendimiento asks the nature of the protection ac- corded men by angels, and Sabiduria, reproaching him for his ignorance, says: Un hombre de 108 voluntarios, Ss le dijesen que un angel entraba en el vientre de una mujer, el cual, segun te dije, e8 tan grande como la tercera parte del mundo, y que el facia los ojos al niwki et las nartices, y que el le hacia los otros miembros, creerlo hia; et si le decian que la vimiente del hombre tenia virtud informativa fasta el advenitr del anima racional, no lo cteeria.3 Man has intelligence which is the good angel sent from, Heaven, and from his substance he has sensuality, his evil coun- sellor. Sometimes the soul is so perfect that the light of the intelligence allows a man to foretell the future; in other cases, when the soul is less perfect, a man may have true Guide, u, p. 53. ' Guide, II, Chap. vr, pp. 37-38: "Angel means 'messenger'; hence everyone that is entrusted with a certain message is an angel." This theory is developed at length by Maimonides in his chapters devoted to Prophecy. ' This illustration is translated from the Guide, II, Chap. vr, pp. 39-40.</page><page sequence="16">ALFONSO DE LA TORRE AND MAIMONIDE5 203 dreams.' Sabiduria then mentions the various degrees of prophecy,2 according to the manner in which the prophets received the message from God, and discusses the beliefs of mankind in regard to magic and divination. Magic was instituted by Zoroaster and was continued by Demo- critus. This error became so general that the Egyptians believed that Moses employed this art in changing sticks to serpents and water to blood. She then mentions the following kinds of magicians and explains their functions: divinos, fitonicos, idolatras, arriolos, astrologos, magos, aruspices, gene ticos, matemdticos, agoreros, prestigiatores, sortilegos, geomantticos, epirmanttcos, hidromdnticos and ariomanticos.3 Many of these practises are merely super- stition and idolatry, but the astrologer may make use of magic and divination for good ends.4 The question of the final cause of the world is then dis- cussed. Entendimien'to asks whether the universe, angels, heavens and earth were created for man. Sabiduria re- plies that God is the efficient and final cause of the world, and that he wished all things created to have some share in his kindness and wisdom. It is an error to say that the angels, heavens and stars were created by God for men; 6 I The doctrine that the real eseence of prophecy is perfection acquiredl in a dream or vision is treated by Maimonides in Part II, Chap. xxxVI. He there says that the action of the imaginative faculty during sleep is the same as at the time when it receives a prophecy, only in the first case it is not fully developed and has not yet reached its highest degree. 2 These are treated in the Guide, II, Chap. xLv. ' All of this material Is borrowed from Isidore's Etymologiae, Lib. viiI, Chap Ix. ' This is an addition of the Spanish author. Maimonides believed that astrology is hot a science at all and should be given no credence. I Maiionides, Guide, III, Chap. :ki, teaches that the universe does not exist for hian's sake, in refutation of the doctrine of Aris- totle. He, however, concludes that the question as to the object of the Creation must be left unanswered.</page><page sequence="17">204 J. P. WICKERSHAM CRAWFORD that would be like manufacturing a very heavy hammer in order to make a needle.' Inferior things are subject to more perfect things; by his understanding, man rules the lower animals, and is subject in turn to the angels, and the latter to God.2 The final cause of man is in three manners: (1) Man mav spend his life speculating on the study of the sciences and the knowledge of God. This is the vida ange'lica; (2) Man may follow the dictates of his passions. This is the vida bestial; (3) Man may be sincere, prudent, and tem- perate. This is the vida humana. The first and third correspond to the fourth and third kinds of perfection attainable by man, according to Maimonides. The author appears to have misunderstood the second kind of per- fection as stated in the Guide, namely, bodily perfection.3 The eighteenth Chapter opens with a description of the maiden Naturaleza. At her feet was Aristotle, and grouped about her were Thales of Miletus, Empedocles, Parmenides, Anaxagoras, Pythagoras, Democritus, Anaximander, Alex- ander of Aphrodisias, Averroes, and Albertus Magnus. Razon explains that Entendimiento has come in quest of knowledge and Aristotle suggests that he be instructed in the first beginning of things. Naturaleza then expounds the various theories concerning the primer principio and then declares the true doctrine, following in great part Aristotle's Physics. She continues, drawing a parallel between the universe 1 The same figure is used by Maimonides in this connection, Guide, I1, Chap. xrv, p. 58. 2G-uide, III; Chap. xm, p. 53: "Man is superior to everything formed of earthly matter, but not to other beings; he is found ex. ceedingly inferior when his existence is compared with that of the spheres, and a fortiori when compared with that of the Intelligences."

Primero has de pensar que este mundo es uno, y es por una orden proporcionado muy ingeniosa et por un vinculo indisoluble: y es uno, as,s comro u hombre es uno; conviene a saber, Pedro 6 Juan;2 y ass como en el hombre hay diversidad de miembros y de, virtudes que mueven et son movidas, et otras que mandan et otras que obedescen, asimesmo en el mundo. E asi como en el hombre hay carne, nervios, huesos et humores diversos, asi la espera del cielo se compone de muchas esperas, et de cuatro elementos en lo que se compone de aquellos; e ast como aqut no hay lugar ninguno vacto, mas es todo lleno, asi en el mayor mundo es todo Ileno, y en el centro de medio es la pella de la tierra, a la cudl circunda el agua, et aquella es circundada del aire y aquel del fuego, y aquella es circundada del cuerpo quinto, que es el cielo.3 She explains the motion of the spheres, their uniformity of revolution and the theory of the mingling of the elements by which are engendered and destroyed all created things, and by which the various phenomena of Nature may be explained. Alfonso de la Torre here follows closely the doctrine of Maimonides as stated in the Guide, Part I, Chapter LXXII. Naturaleza, still following the same chapter of the Guide, gives a minute description of the analogy between the Universe or Cosmos and Man, the Microcosmos. There are four forces present in every living thing: attraction, retention, digestion and secretion; and it is through an ' This is borrowed almost literally from the Guide, I, Chap. LXix.

In the same manner, the elements are subject to excesses of various kinds, which produce calamities in the world, and Naturaleza enumerates a few of the catas- trophes caused in the world by the excess of some element. MIost of these examples are taken from Isidore's Etymolo- giae, De Diluviis,l and show that Alfonso de la Torre's attitude toward geography and physics was as uncritical as that of Pliny or Solinus. The analogy between the Universe and Man is still fur- ther developed. In the rnayor mundo, there is a first intelligence which is God, who makes all things move; likewise there is in man the virtue of understanding by reason of which he is honored and compared to the angels. In this respect alone he resembles God, for in other things he is like dumb animals.2 The understanding of man is the best thing in the world, for it is not of the substance of the earth, but rather of the light of the intelligence. He who understands reason must excel among men of lesser understanding, since he more closely resembles God than they. The closer he comes to God, the better does he know, love, and obey him: and the more man loves him, the greater delight does he take in virtuous actions.3 Por aquestas cau*sas ya dichas el hombre es dicho menor mun- do; ca hay en e'l figura et complimiento del mayor, et no decimos esto de todo hombre, sino del intelectual; ca el otro no es hombre, sino que tiene un grado sobre el jimia o bruto.4 1 Lib. xIn, Chap. x2I.

Enten- dimiento is convinced of the truth of this doctrine by the concrete illustration of the ship, borrowed from Maimon- ides. If ten persons know of the existence of a ship and none of them know its attributes, he arrives at the most correct notion of its nature who can ascribe to it the greatest number of negative attributes. In like manlier, man can come nearer to a knowledge of God by a concep- tion of his negative attributes. Entendimiento asks how some men can be nearer God than others, and Naturaleza replies with an apologue. A hundred men went out hunting with a king, lost their way, and returned half blinded by the reflection of the sun on the snow; some lost their way completely; others entered the city but did not see the palace; others entered the palace, but could not see the king. In like manner, when men approach God, although deprived of understanding, some are nearer to him than others. This illustration is borrowed with a few unimportant changes from the Guide, Part III, Chapter LI. The remainder of the chapter is devoted to a discussion of the immortality of the soul. Here again the source is the Guide, which reproduces, except in a few details, the teaching of Aristotle, according to the conception of his commentator Alexander of Aphro- disias. The twentieth Chapter is a recapitulation of the things seen by Entendimiento in the dwelling of Naturaleza, and 1 Guide, I, Chap. Lx, p. 221.

WICKBRSHAMI CRAWFORD a summary of the doctrines already treated concerning the creation, fate, corporeal objects, time, *nature of the sky, climate, the various natural phenomena, and the peculiari- ties of certain birds and animals, with anecdotes about them in the manner of Pliny. The Second Part of the Visi6n Delectable, which is chiefly concerned with ethics and politics, shows less in- debtedness to the Guide of the Perplexed than the First Part. The first Chapter describes the arrival of Enten- dimiento at the abode of Razon, a magnificent building in the estilo mudeljar, guarded by the Cardinal Virtues. Razon and Verdad occupy the highest places, and the blessed company of men of great authority are seated about them, except Socrates and Seneca, who sit at their feet. Entendimiento expresses his gratitude for the infor- mation which he has already received, but cannot under- stand why man alone breaks the laws of Nature, while the intelligences, heavens and planets obey the will of God. Either God is indifferent to man and has not created him for any purpose, or man is indifferent to God, and to the motive for his creation. He is granted permission to explain himself more fully, and argues that we should expect to find all the virtues among the clergy and ministers of justice, but that these classes are more dissolute than other men. His arraign- ment of the evils of the clergy is a furious one. Dudo si hallareis en el mundo gente mas apartada de saber; ante paresce que acordadamente han escogido los mas idiotas para aquello. They are ignorant, make fun of knowledge which yields no financial return, are intemperate, gluttonous, adulterous, tainted with simony, false and hypocritical. He also finds many abuses among the ministers of justice, and adds: y sub*o en mi corazon que los de la casa</page><page sequence="22">ALFONSO DE LA TORRE AND MATMONIDES 209 primera nos enganiaban, porquw decian que habia otro mundo y no curaban del, y que era falsia; y que ellos asi lo entendtan que era burla, ca en otra manera trabajarian por haberlo: y los de la casa segunda pense que nos hacian, servirlos et complir sus leyes, et obedescer suw mandami- entos por temor, y que no habia otra cosa sino nascer et morir. Various other questions are then discussed, such as the ultimate aim of human endeavor; the three kinds of lives, vida contemplativa, bestial, and humana; the passions in- herent in men; the reason why there are more evil men than good; why God did not create man so that he could not sin; whether things are subject to fate, and the benefits of the four Virtues: Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Tem- perance. In the last named subject, the author shows an intimate acquaintance with Aristotle's Ethics. Various questions of economics and politics are also treated, in- cluding a description of the gradual development of society, much of which is taken from Isidore's Etymologiae.1 Ver- dad then gives a brief account of the birth, death, resur- rection, and ascension of Jesus, and of the doctrine of the Trinity. She declares that only with this true belief can man be saved. Razon offers to tell Entendimiento the doctrine of the ultimate end of man, a doctrine which has been the opinion of all philosophers and especially of the wise men of the Gentiles, Jews, Moors, and of some Christians: en los gentiles, Anaxagoras, Platon et Aristotiles; en los judios, rab' Aquiba 2 et rabi Abrahan et Benazra,3 et maestre ILib. xv, Chap. i; Lib. v; Lib. vm, Chap. xr.

Men of this kind receive the highest degree of perfection and resemble angels. They flee the world and spend their lives in the contemplation of the glory of God. This is MIaimonidess doctrine of the conditions necessary before one receives the gift of prophecy. Entendimiento thanks God for having allowed him to learn these secrets hidden from men, and asks permission to remain in that celestial company. The author then declares that he had written of what he had seen, when the vision was ended, and asks his patron that the work should not pass into the hands of a third person, lest he be unjustly criticized. Y eso mesmo seria redargiiido porque lo puse en palabras vulgares, et toque tan abiertamente las cosas encubiertas y secretas, como hasta hoy ningtno lo haya querido hacer en los que han escripto antes de agora, et por ventura me arguiirian los tales de presuntuoso et audaz. He completes the book with a salutation to the young Prince Carlos, and asks that it be accepted as the first fruits of his labors. The close relationship of this work with the Moreh works of great value on Biblical exegesis, Hebrew grammar, re- ligious philosophy, mathematics and astronomy.

It is probable that Delphini's version was trans- lated into Spanish by the Spanish Jew, Francisco de Caceres, because the latter recognized that Chapters viii- xix of the First Part of the Vision Delectable are really a commentary on the Guide of the Perplexed.' In view of the hostility to the Jews in Spain, culminating in the edict of expulsion, it was a dangerous attempt to embody the teachings of the great Jewish theologian in a work which purported to be Christian. Gallardo 2 mentions a certain Bachiller de la Torre who translated the Ethics of Atistotle in a version which was published at Seville in 1493. He adds in a note: No sabemos si e8te Bachiller 8er1a persona distinrta del que sigue, i. e., the author of the Visio6n Delectable. This would not be difficult to believe, since Alfonso de la Torre shows an iIntimate knowledge of this work. Gallardo also quotes a maniiscript account of the estab- lishment of the Inquisition at Toledo in 1485, which is not without interest.3 All the judaizanres were ordered to embrace the Catholic faith within forty days, but in the first two weeks of the allotted time, not a single Jewish convert to Christianity had availed himself of this oppor- I Clceres omitted in his version Chapter xv of the Second Part, dealing with the life of Jesus and the doctrine of the Trinity.

Y despues prendieron al Bachiller de la Torre que era uno de los caXpitanes, y lo colgaron, e a otros cuatro hombres. I merely quote this document as a possible means of identifying the author of the Visi'kn Delectable with the unfortunate Bachiller de la Torre whose death is here mentioned. The name is so common in Spain that the document presented is of slight value, but the Visio6n Delectable contains such conclusive proof of the author's familiarity with Jewish theology, that the identification may not be entirely unsupported. HIowever, the fact that the work of Maimonides was used to so considerable an extent by Alfonso de la Torre should not be without interest to the student of Spanish letters. One more title is hereby added to the list of philosophical works which have been influenced by the Guide of the Perplexed. J. P. WICKERSHAM CRAWFORD.</page></plain_text>
