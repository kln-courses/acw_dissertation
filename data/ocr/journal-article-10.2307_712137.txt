<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 193 of Homer, in a few medieval manuscripts and in partial extracts accompanying the text of many Iliad manuscripts, notably in the margins and between the lines of the celebrated Venetus A, the most important source for the Scholia vetera. They were first printed by Lascaris in 1517, and appeared thereafter in some editions of the Iliad until the nineteenth century, when interest in them progressively evaporated in consequence of the recovery of the Scholia vetera following Villoison's edition of the Iliad in 1788 based on Venetus A and including the A and B scholia. Since then the Aristarchan A scholia and the exegetic bT scholia have become the ones to occupy scholars, and the D scholia were finally, with a few exceptions, excluded from H. Erbse's wonderful seven-volume edition (Scholia Graeca in Homeri Iliadem) of 1969-88. They are, however, needed, especially as it has become clear that the glossographic element is not some low-level late compilation, but has its origin in school practice in Athens long before the Alexandrian period to which the A scholia relate, and the mythological explanations, regularly quoting leading ancient scholars by name, are now attributed to a 'Mythographus Homericus' of probably the second century A.D. Publication, however, involves serious difficulty. There is a plethora of late Byzantine sources for the elucidation of Homer, including Eustathius, prose paraphrases of the whole Iliad, the large Etymologica, and an alphabetical lexicon entitled Lexeis Homericae, all of which need to be compared in detail with the D scholia; and additionally numerous fragments of papyri have been found in the last century offering the same or similar material. In particular the papyrus fragments of glossographies, now called the Scholia minora and discussed by A. Henrichs in important articles in ZPE 7 and 8 (1971), provide a fascinating subject for scholarly comparison. M., of the University of Genoa, has been preparing an edition of the D scholia for many years; half of the fourteen articles reprinted in this volume, and all the material in its predecessor (Studi di Filologia Omerica Antica I, Pisa, 1979), are preparatory to that edition. M. is highly qualified for this desperately difficult work, being papyrologist, lexicographer, and Homerist; he has published and re-ordered relevant papyrus fragments, has recently produced a new Italian Greek lexicon comparable to LSJ (Vocabolario della Lingua Greca, Turin, 1995), and has written a popular Introduzione a Omero (Florence, 1990). He explains here (p. 147) his plan for the edition: it will be of five volumes, I containing the papyri, II-IV the D scholia, and V the Lexeis Homericae, previously published only up to the letter e by V. de Marco (Rome, 1946). The most interesting and relevant articles in the present volume are VI, on later Greek paraphrases of Homer; VII, a survey of the Homerica which have now appeared on papyrus; and the last two articles, XIII being a presentation of two papyrus fragments in the form they will take in the coming edition, and XIV on the manuscript tradition of the D scholia. He deserves our congratulations and best wishes for the successful completion of his task. University College London M. M.WILLCOCK J. ALVIS: Divine Purpose and Heroic Response in Homer and Virgil: The Political Plan of Zeus. Pp. xi + 269. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 1995. Cased, $58.50 (Paper, $21.95). ISBN: 0-8476-8014-2 (0-8476-8015-9). In this ambitious study, A. proposes to offer 'sustained political interpretations of Homer's two epics' and to trace 'continuities of political concerns' from Homer to Virgil. In practice, this turns out to mean an interpretation of the theodicy of each of the three poems, according to which Zeus/Jupiter is explicitly concerned with 'political justice' and the education of the mortal characters, who are to be weaned away from 'heroic' selfishness and made aware of their dependence on divine favour and the community at large. Unfortunately, his analysis of the Homeric epics, in particular, is far from persuasive. The discussion relies much too heavily on arbitrary assumptions about the nature of divine providence and heroic society, and it is initially quite unclear what A. means by 'political' in this context (there is no consideration of either ancient or modem political theory until the very end of the chapter on the Odyssey). Zeus appears to be concerned above all to keep the heroes in their place and prevent them from becoming 'self-sufficient', but is also said to have an overriding interest in abstract justice. It is never made entirely clear whether the two are equated or are supposed to conflict with each other (and vague references to 'general rules of fairness' certainly do not help). A. also tends to assume that any future event prophesied by Zeus must be part of his ? Oxford University Press, 1997</page><page sequence="2">194 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW plan, sidestepping the problem of the relationship between the gods and an overriding 'fate' which has loomed so large in critical literature on the poem. So, too, it is assumed, without adequate argument, that the actions of other gods and goddesses can be traced back to Zeus: his 'goading' of Hera and Athena at the beginning of Iliad 4, for example, is said to make him 'ultimately responsible' for the breaking of the truce (against the more obvious interpretation, that he simply gives in to Hera). The chapter on the Odyssey is better, though here again the relationship between Zeus and the other gods is over-simplified. Here, too, A. would have benefited from a closer study of recent critical literature, particularly in his rather literal-minded discussion of the role of Penelope in the latter part of the poem. The chapter has interesting-though not wholly original-things to say about tensions between heroism and domesticity, 'spiritedness' and prudence in the epic and its hero; but the underlying assumption that Zeus is out to 'provide a lesson for gods and humans' fails to convince. The last two chapters, both devoted to the Aeneid, are by far the best part of the book. A.'s discussion here is much more rigorous and systematic. and he finally makes some attempt to relate his interpretation of the poem to ancient theories of government. His main thesis is that the poem can be read as a kind of meditation on the Platonic conception of the tripartite soul. In particular, Virgil is concerned with the relationship between 'spiritedness' and bodily desire (on the one hand) and reason (on the other): can spiritedness ever be wholly subordinated to reason? On the divine level, this theme is worked out through the relationships between Jupiter (reason), Juno (spiritedness), and Venus (desire); on the human, through conflicts within Aeneas himself, and in his relations with Dido and Turnus; and on the political plane, reflected in the opposing demands of individual liberty and pax Romana. In outline, this line of interpretation is suggestive if somewhat schematic, and may well have more to offer than tired arguments about whether Aeneas succeeds or fails as a Stoic hero. But once again, the detailed working-out is often confused and unconvincing. A. tends to equivocate, for example, as to whether pietas should or should not be equated with reason, as to whether Jupiter should be regarded as a mere symbol or as a 'real' anthropomorphic god, and so on. The argument would have been clarified by the inclusion of a more systematic discussion of the status of Virgil's gods (and, yet again, by some consideration of recent studies, particularly Feeney's The Gods in Epic [Oxford, 1991], which is not even mentioned; it is symptomatic that an article published in 1972 is referred to as 'recent'!). The reader who is put off by the disorganized and tortuous course of the argument (not to mention the lack of an adequate index) is likely to be further discouraged by the style of A.'s prose, which is ponderous and often inelegant. The volume is also marred by a very large number of errors in Latin and Greek words and quotations (phthonis, campi lugenti, numerous inaccuracies in accentuation). Ultimately, this is a book which promises much but fails, by and large, to deliver. A. certainly has some interesting ideas; but his lack of methodological rigour, clarity of exposition, and familiarity with recent scholarship are shortcomings which cannot easily be overlooked.

This is the third Euripidean volume to appear in the Alma Mater series of Greek and Latin texts, of which A. and de C. are respectively director and secretary. The two plays included, Med. and Hipp., make a better thematic pairing than those in the earlier volumes: Alc. and Andr. (I, 1955, 2nd edn 1982); and Ba. and Hec. (II, 1960). This volume can also draw on more recent textual study, especially that of Barrett (introduction in Euripides. Hippolytus, ed. and comm., Oxford, 1964) and of Diggle (OCT, replacement of Murray, complete with Vol. III in 1994; Med. and Hipp. are both in Vol. I, 1984).
