<plain_text><page sequence="1">Circuits of Meeting and Telling: Joyce, Psychoanalysis, and Narration Tony Thwaites University of Queensland Joyce and psychoanalysis have had a rich and complex history over the last thirty years or so,1 and both also have much to say about meetings and their complexities. What does it mean for Joyce and psychoanalysis to meet? I. Jewgreek Is Greekjew Ulysses commemorates the meeting of Joyce and Nora in more thor oughgoing ways than the incidence of a date. It is also in many ways a book about meetings?about their fatefulness and what "Ithaca" will call their "imprevidibility" (Li 17.980); about what follows and what does not follow from them; about the futures to which meetings do, or do not, lead; and about the ways in which those future events not yet encountered cast their shadows before them and revise and rewrite what has led up to them, in all sorts of retrospective arrange ments. "I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives" (II 7.763-65). This is one of the ways we find it put in "Aeolus," the first episode to be shared by Bloom and Stephen, though the two are only to meet some ten hours and three hundred pages later. Their non-meeting here takes on some of its meaning from that encounter which has not yet taken place. It turns the episode into something like one of those stage farces of opening and closing doors: not so much Hamlet as The Comedy of Errors. Here we have Stephen thinking of the way in which one can never know the first event in a series at the time at which it occurs; knowledge of it as the first event is always retrospective, look ing back on it once the series of events is well under way It is not, of course, a serious suggestion about this particular match and this act. On the one hand, J. J. O'Molloy, lighting his cigarette in the offices of the Freeman, is not someone to whom the day will bring Stephen into a closer orbit. On the other hand, though, Bloom will have more to do with O'Molloy later that day, in "Cyclops"?and Bloom is still 679</page><page sequence="2">on the very fringes of Stephen's awareness, little more than a slightly insistent interruption. What is more, that curious sentence is, as com mentators often point out, a parodic borrowing from sentimental fic tion.2 Stephen is not so much endorsing it as ironically citing the very sort of received wisdom and style that Bloom himself revels in?the sort of thing he might even have read that morning, in "Matcham's Masterstroke" (U 4.502). If Stephen notes with irony what Bloom takes straight, the real irony is that he is describing precisely what will hap pen, even if he does not yet know it, and in the very language that will turn out to be so characteristic of the one with whom he will be meeting. This statement about retrospective sorts of arrangements reveals itself to be a precise example of retrospective sorts of arrange ment. At the very moment Stephen is missing the mark, he is hitting it in a series of errors that, as he has yet to affirm, will be the "portals of discovery" (LI 9.229). Psychoanalysis knows all about meetings too. The dream work stages a delicate dance between a latent content and what Sigmund Freud calls "the day's residues": events that need not have occurred but are brought into the orbit of the dream by nothing more than the contingency of their having happened.3 A friend, a color, a snatch of conversation from some time during the previous period of wak ing?all of these can be the grain of sand around which the uncon scious can secrete the dream-pearl. The famous primal scene itself is not a time bomb ticking away; it is a moment that, if it ever occurred at all, turns to trauma only much later on, in retrospect, with the thor oughly contingent advent of another quite unrelated event. This is the famous logic of Nachtrdglichkeit.4 Case histories are not only the recounting of what happened at regular meetings, sometimes over years; they are, above all, detailed studies of how these meetings can miss one another. Freud's best known case histories, after all, the ones that repay the most attention, are the failures. Before the treatment is over, Dora dismisses Freud as one would a servant.5 The Wolf-Man keeps returning in misery time after time to reveal that the previous treatment, the one that was supposed to have cured him, did not?as Freud notes in the cascad ing footnotes to successive editions of the text (17:1-122). The very structure of the primal scene itself is that of a missed encounter, an event that need not even have taken place. The breaking of the trans ference is itself a refusal. The slips of the tongue, the bungled actions and parapraxes of everyday psychopathology suggest that the very possibility of there being a subject lies in a non-encounter. Hence, we have the Cartesian variations Jacques Lacan will cast in the late 1950s: "1 think where I am not, therefore I am where I am not thinking"; "I think about what I am where I do not think I am thinking."6 Given all of this, we should not be surprised that the meeting 680</page><page sequence="3">between Joyce and psychoanalysis should be oblique, indirect, cir cling, retrospective. A meeting is in some ways a speculation on the future, on the mutual future of both parties casting their lot together in the awareness that the event may change both profoundly: we can think of Joyce and Nora, if not Frank and Eveline. We could say that, in general the meeting between literature and psychoanalysis is at its weakest where it is most direct, which is to say where literature serves merely as the source of exempla for what psychoanalysis knows already Thus, the most extended of Freud's writings on literature, "Delusions and Dreams in Jensen's Gradiva," is perhaps the least interesting of them, in that it merely confirms the already-known; the essay on "The Uncanny," however, offers a genuine sense of psychoanalysis's discovery through literature of something it did not know before, and of its finding there, at an unfamiliar remove in these stories of ghostly doubles, its own ghostly double (9:1-95,17:217-52). (We may add that this is precisely why the most interesting of the case-histories are the failures: they are the ones that refuse to confirm the already-known, and thus the ones psychoanalysis has to ponder most carefully) We have to suspect that where Joyce and. psychoanalysis meet? these bodies of writing which are all about how there is a non-encoun ter at the heart of every meeting?it has to be as a meeting that never quite takes place, a non-address. We know^ that for all of his interest in literature, Freud seems to have been quite unaware of Joyce.7 Joyce's antagonisms towards Freud, on the other hand, are legendary: we have the "grisly old Sykos" of Finnegans Wake, doing their "unsmil ing bit on 'alices, when they were yung and easily freudened" (FW 115.21-23), and the letter to Harriet Shaw Weaver that makes Jung "the Swiss Tweedledum" to "the Viennese Tweedledee" (SL 282). We have Italo Svevo's assurance that Joyce knew nothing at all about psy choanalysis, at least when he left Trieste in 1915;8 but we also know, from Daniel Ferrer's work, that Joyce certainly read Freud some ten years later, since his notebooks record passages from the case histo ries of "Little Hans" and "The Wolf Man."9 The names translate one another: German Freud is Irish Joyce, and both are the name of the sinthome, joy, that supplementary and unanalyzable kernel of jouis sance, the identification with which Lacan will, from the mid-1970s on, see as the aim and end of all analysis?and which Lacan sees all of Joyce's writing as forming. As Lacan also points out, though, proper names are untranslatable, and to attempt to translate one can onl; be seen by its bearer as an insult.10 Joyce and Freud are thus brough together not so much by sympathy as by mutual insult. Or by sleepwalking. Though Freud and Joyce were to know many of the same cities, we rarely catch them in the same place at the same time. Their travels read like the non-meetings of "Aeolus." In late 681</page><page sequence="4">October 1904, Joyce and Nora arrive in the Trieste where Freud had studied briefly twenty-eight years earlier?some six weeks after he had passed through again, returning home to Vienna after the trip to Greece that he describes in his 1936 paper "A Disturbance of Memory on the Acropolis" (22:237-48). Joyce was in Zurich between 1915 and 1920; but since the heretic Jung had resigned from the International Psychoanalytic Association in 1914, Switzerland was off the agenda for much psychoanalytic activity after that point.11 There are occa sions when they might both have been in Trieste at the same time: Freud made at least two trips to Rome and Italy during Joyce's Trieste years and may conceivably have passed through Trieste en route, so we are left with the spectral possibility of the two men passing each other in the street. As far as I can tell, there is only one occasion on which the two were definitely in the same city at the same time, though they would hardly have crossed paths. Early in June 1938, according to Ernest Jones, the old and ill Freud, in flight from Vienna with his family, spent twelve hours with Marie Bonaparte in Paris before leaving for Dover and London (643). A strange, protracted scene: a younger Irishman, in unknowing pursuit of an older Jewish man, who may not have his voice but has his name. Only much later in this long day are they brought together, by proxy, in two events which repeat and invert each other. On 7 December 1921, some two months before Ulysses is finally published, Valery Larbaud gives a lecture on Ulysses as part of a Joyce benefit at Shakespeare &amp; Company.12 Among the 250 or so people crowded into the bookshop is Lacan?a year younger than Stephen at this time, when Joyce is some two to three years older than Bloom. Questions of paternity, inheritance, and what it means to be a son will soon be of prime importance to him, and he is at a discussion of a literary text which is all about these things, with an audience of litterateurs, in a room lined with books and the portraits of writers. It begins to look not so much like "Aeolus" as "Scylla and Charybdis." And half a cen tury later, there is its inversion: on Bloomsday 1975, Lacan addresses the Fifth International James Joyce Symposium, at the Sorbonne.13 IL As He and Others See Me What is a meeting that does not quite take place? If it never quite takes place, where and when could we ever come across such a thing? Let us look at some of the ways in which Ulysses thinks through such a possibility. Bloom is about to head north up Kildare Street, for the National Library, but something happens to change his plans before he gets there: 682</page><page sequence="5">Mr Bloom came to Kildare Street. First I must. Library Straw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turned up trousers. It is. It is. His heart quoppecl softly To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved to the right. Is it? Almost certain. Won't look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too heady. Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Get on. Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes. Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me? Didn't see me perhaps. Light in his eyes. The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold stat ues: quiet there. Safe in a minute. No. Didn't see me. After two. Just at the gate. My heart! His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture. Look for something L His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded Agendath Netaim. Where did I? Busy looking. He thrust back quick Agendath. Afternoon she said. I am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. Freeman. Where did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Potato. Purse. Where? Hurry Walk quietly. Moment more. My heart. His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion have to call tepid paper stuck. Ah soap there I yes. Gate. Safe! (U 8.1167-93) The straw hat, tan shoes, and "[tjurnedup trousers" belong to Blazes Boylan, who is dressed to kill and is the last person Bloom wants to face at the moment. So Bloom does a hairpin turn and swerves in through the museum gate as if that had really been his destination all along, with an elaborate pantomime of being so busy with his own thoughts, admiring the architecture, and searching for an imaginary object in his pocket, that he did not even notice who was there in. th street ahead of him. Boylan is, no doubt, amused and not taken in fc a moment: we can be sure that, as an impresario, he sees a lot of bac actors. To whom is this show addressed? The obvious answer, Boylan, is inadequate. The purpose of the whole charade is, after all, precisely to avoid addressing Boylan. "I am pretending not to notice you whom I am addressing" would just give the game away We have to thin! of Bloom's pantomime as addressed elsewhere to a third party alto gether?something like a detached and purely hypothetical observe, who would be able to see quite clearly that Bloom is incontrovertibly turning off into the museum grounds simply because he is interested in the architecture and the statues and that this decision has notlv 683</page><page sequence="6">ing whatsoever to do with Boylan, who has not even been noticed: an impartial observer?the world itself, perhaps?who, if called on, would be able to bear all that out to Boylan. There is, of course, no one at all, real or imagined, who could fill this role. In Lacanian terms, Bloom is addressing something quite other than the small "o" other of imaginary identification. That "small other" would be the other person, with whom I identify and in whom I see my image: in this case, Boylan as the figure of masculinity and sexual potency who is everything cuckolded Bloom is not, and who has replaced Bloom in Molly's eyes and bed. But, as we have just seen, that is not the case: Boylan is the last person Bloom, wants to have to address. His actions are for the "big Other," the symbolic Other: the empty position of judgment itself, that impossible place from which one can be seen and judged. Once the pantomime is aimed at convincing that symbolic Other, it does not even have to fool Boylan any more (which it is hard to imagine it managing anyway). "No matter what you may think of what I am doing," the action seems to say in its very non-address to Boylan, "the big Other to whom I am really addressing this knows the truth of my actions. That is what lets me perform them in front of you, even in the knowledge that I am being seen, and that my desires are perfectly visible, and that the very disguise I give them is transparent." There's something death-defying in this act without safety net, where the very mortifica tion of the performance provides a strange sort of surplus enjoyment, a masochistic Schadenfreude, There are many scenes like this in the book, and they cluster thick and fast in this particular episode, "Lestrygonians." We have Bloom's attempt to discover whether the statues in the entrance to the National Museum have anuses and his being caught in the act by Buck Mulligan; we have his determined attempt to avoid Nosey Flynn in Davey Byrne's; and we have the curious little pantomime he must go through in order to leave the Burton Restaurant: "Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said: ?Not here. Don't see him. Out. I hate dirty eaters. He backed towards the door" (If 8.694-97). Bloom has been standing in the doorway, where "[s]tink gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens" (U 8.650-51). The description we get is of what registers on Bloom's awareness?a panoply of wet moustaches and wolfed "gobfuls," "saucestained napkinfs]," toothless mouths, and a piece of "half masticated gristle" which the text will shortly vomit up again as the "sick knuckly cud" a ravenous terrier chokes up on the cobblestones in Duke Lane (Li 8.655, 658, 660,1031). It is all very disgusting, but in the middle of it, with the same circuit of address, there is something Bloom himself does not quite want to digest: "Chump chop from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad booser's eyes. Bitten off more 684</page><page sequence="7">than he can chew. Am I like that? See ourselves as others see us" (U 8.660-62). It is a disturbing thought?momentary perhaps, like a little cloud gone the next moment, but, as always, its capacity to disturb may be measured by the very rapidity with which Bloom veers off into something else altogether, to one of those Bloomisms made up of partly-digested and half-remembered fragments from his own reading (Cormac, the "last pagan king of Ireland" choked to death while he was eating?li 8.663-64). And though it does not seem to be immediately in Bloom's mind, we readers may remember quite vividly the way in which our own entry into his life was waylaid by "gizzards," "giblet[s]," and, above all, those kidneys with their "fine tang of faintly scented urine" (II 4.02, 04-05). To enter the kitchen in "Calypso" with its "[g]elid light and air" (Li 4.07) is also to pause momentarily on the threshold with that slight shock of culinary dis gust. Bloom, seeing himself as others see him at the doorway of the Burton, is catching an impossible glimpse of our first sight of him in the kitchen at Eccles Street. This drama of visibility is one of the things that will triangulate Bloom and Stephen before they have even met. If we ignore the single sharp glint of that word "Chrysostomos" on the very first page, the book's first sustained passage of interior monologue is set off by the glimpse Stephen has of his bleary face in Mulligan's shaving mirror: "Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this face for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too" (U 1.26, 136-37). The mirror's half-circle sweep "to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea" (li 1.130-31) and the Stephen he sees in it, reflected back at him, do not quite coincide with the Stephen he imagines for himself, or would like to imagine for himself, or would like to imag ine himself for others, or would like others to imagine him already for himself, or.. .. The circuit of Mulligan's gesture carries the flash of the mirror out over the world beyond the book's Dublin morning in 1904 and gives us, too, as readers, our first glimpse of Stephen: it returns to him, as it were, through us as that point of accusation, judgment, interrogation. This glimpse "as . . . others see me" that "asks me too" is quite explicitly where we, the readers?impossibly, but structur ally?sit.14 The shorthand for this impossibility, which offers to u as fantasy the very place of that "Other" from which everything is judged, is fiction, and it is from this fantasized circuit of the novelistic that Joycean writing breaks. Such a circuit of address already implicitly breaks with any psy chology, typology, or characterology, and it does it in quite the same way in which Lacan insists that psychoanalysis breaks with psychol ogy15 Here, things already no longer work on the level of the ego and ego-relations: that ego,which, as Lacan says, is an object.15 In Gerald Prince's classic work on narratology, for example, literary character is 685</page><page sequence="8">"an existent"17?that is, "an actor or an item of setting." In the sen tence "Susan looked at the table," according to Prince, Susan and the table are equally existents; the difference is that character is "an exis tent endowed with anthropomorphic traits and engaged in anthropo morphic actions" (28, 12). Psychological and literary character is an object?of a particular kind, to be sure, but an object nevertheless, to be described by a plenitude of traits, just like tables. Our relationship to such an ego-object is one of imaginary identification, of likes and dislikes, and of the ways in which we can find ourselves mirrored in such characters. But the Bloom we have just seen here is part of a circuit of address around that empty space of the big Other?a sort of speculation, in the economic sense, on whatever is within or behind or beyond or above it, on those impersonal and unconscious structures that subtend it. The not-quite-meeting between Bloom and Boylan is triangulated by something which is neither of them, and, because of that, there is something which escapes imaginary identification. This circuit of address and all that follows from it is even more fundamental to Ulysses than interior monologue, for it makes interior monologue possible and, indeed, produces any sense of interiority. For there to be that incessant murmur of interiority, interiority must be ever-so-slightly dislocated from itself, never quite coincident with itself, able to address itself in a circuit across a gap that is at once unimaginably thin (because nothing at all separates addresser and addressee) and unimaginably vast (because it is literally nothing that separates self from itself, the gap is irretrievable). Thus it is no longer quite interiority as such, for that "as others see me" is, of necessity, something that is perpetually open to all sorts of unforeseeable, abso lute futures in which I will be seen in that arc of the flash of the mir ror. Joycean address is an opening of, or to, futurity: to what has not yet arrived or must be kept open, to an irreducible and ineradicable "not yet." Narration and its address necessarily partake of this same logic. Far from being a way of transmitting a content from one constituted point (the author or that perennial narratological stand-in, the narra tor, with all of the Ptolemaic epicycles of Arranger, Parodist, Catechist that it might entail) to another (dear reader), narration too is an indirect circuit around an empty place in which all manner of things are already caught up. When the moocow comes down that road at the very beginning of A Portrait?"His father told him that story" (P 7)?we have, behind Stephen and Simon Dedalus, a tale that is not so much invented as passed on, made up not only out of actual frag ments and memories of stories the father has heard or had passed on to him since his own childhood, but, beyond that, out of those vague, general, and quite uncoded ideas that circulate in a society, the sorts of things you say to children, or at least "nicens little" children 686</page><page sequence="9">(P 7): babytalk and moocows. The story precedes both its ostensible addresser and addressee. The name for this circuit of address on the level of narration is free indirect discourse. Free indirect discourse is hardly Joyce's invention?though we have to say that even if it were it would cast shadows before it. That "see ourselves as others see us" is in a sense nothing more than what the novel before Joyce offers us. Is it not, for example, exactly what Jane Austen provides at the very beginning of Emma, with that famously ironized view of an Emma that is precisely what Emma does not yet know of herself but will come to know? The story resolves itself by making those two viewpoints coincide, the charac ter's and the narration's. It collapses imaginary identification?what 1 imagine myself to be, and the ways in which I see myself reflected in the eyes of the others around me?onto symbolic identification as the narrational universe itself confirms my judgment. The fantasy of that most novelistic of devices, third-person omniscient narration, is that the Other can and does answer that anxious "Che vuoi?"?"What do you want of me?"18 Fantasy is not a consolation prize for unattained desires, so much as a way of structuring desire: the fantasy of third person narration teaches how to desire and what can act as objects of my desire, through a narration of maturation and ethical pedagogy. It affirms that there is indeed such a place of knowledge, that it exists and responds, that it is person-like and yet not divided against itself, and that in it, the mirrored and fractured labyrinth of my own imagi nary identifications is already somehow to be found and affirmed as a truth it knows. In a word, novelistic narration offers us the fantasy that we can, quite impossibly, occupy the place of the big Other. III. Ineluctable Modality of the Tellable For psychoanalysis, then, Joyce's real innovation is not interior monologue or stream~of-consciousness, which stays well within the already familiar boundaries of psychology and the realist novel What Joyce performs?as does the not-quite-meeting with psychoanalysis he stages before the event?is a sort of doubled and redoubled atonal ity of address. On the one hand, with Joyce, we have a free indirect discourse which no longer gathers itself up into that fantasy of the Other's reply; on the other hand, we have a certain opacity which refuses to yield itself. It does these by a process of multiplication and overbidding. We see this most directly in the proliferation of technics and styles as Ulysses progresses. At the very moment when the book moves towards its narrative resolution?the meeting of Bloom and Stephen, Bloom's return home, and his long-avoided encounter with Molly after the day's events?its narration diverges in the most 687</page><page sequence="10">unprecedented and alarming ways. We must be clear about this: the point lies in the divergence, rather than in the styles of any one of these episodes. Even the most apparently unnovelistic of technics, taken on its own, plays out that novelistic strategy of the fantasy of the impossible reply of the Other. In those earlier mortifications of ''Lestrygonians" and behind the scenes in the next episode, Bloom is all too repeatedly aware of how ineffective his defensive responses are in the eyes of Boylan and Mulligan. "Cyclops" gives us Bloom as seen with implacable hostility and contempt but responds by making that narrative viewpoint itself contemptible. "Nausicaa" shows us a Bloom caught in a disreputable pleasure, but this time it responds with a narrative framework in which this is sublimated and comically disavowed, in a way that is no less transparent than Bloom's strate gies for avoiding Boylan. "Oxen of the Sun" makes literature itself tell the story. In "Circe," the trial and public humiliation are staged in ways both literal and impossible, as if it were no longer narrated at all but just there, present, to be seen. After this, things proceed in a more kindly way: Bloom has, after all, been able to take care of Stephen "in orthodox Samaritan fashion" (LI 16.03); at last and late in this very long day, something has happened to Bloom about which he can be unequivocally pleased. "Eumaeus" acts as if it were an attempt at a public statement, in a public idiom we have glimpsed before?one Bloom knows, and one that we can well imagine him turning his hand to: "My Experiences, let us say, in a Cabman's Shelter," "at the rate of one guinea per column" (U 16.1231, 1230-31). With "Ithaca," the narration inflates out into what the universe itself might say of all of this?if, that is, the universe were built with the contents of Bloom's bookshelf. "Ithaca" is scientific only if we share Bloom's view of what science is: an autodidact's fantasy of objectivity, of factuality as an endless compendium of facts. Here, we find everywhere the fantasy that was nervously broached in the agonized avoidance of Boylan in "Lestrygonians": the universe itself now seems to testify, with the same thoroughness and in the same voice as the rolling oceans and infinite night skies of all those potentially endless lists, to no one in particular and in response to no one in particular, that Bloom is all right and, indeed, for all that has happened, a fortunate and happy man. With Bloom asleep, the narration moves beyond that fantasy (and, importantly, across the sexual divide) to Molly, who represents not the truth of Bloom's situation so much as the "necessary counter signature," no longer even answerable to that Bloomian fantasy-at one-remove which has implicitly driven so much of what has gone before. Linking and separating the episodes are their successive solutions to the question of address. In this, what the multiplying technics of the later part of Ulysses do is in a direct line from A Portrait's careful 688</page><page sequence="11">separation of narration and focalization, where the narration is always (even in the final first-person pages) coming from somewhere just to one side of Stephen?within or beyond or behind or above, indeed. Even more markedly than in A Portrait, however, the sheer accelerat ing variety and multiplicity of the technics of Ulysses do not move towards a psychological portrait of a "true Bloom" or towards some stable point from which the narrative could be addressed. Instead, the episodes form an increasingly serial structure. The analogy I have in mind here is not so much musical as painterly In 1891, Monet exhibited a series of fifteen paintings of haystacks. They were the first of the series that was to occupy him in later life?paintings which cast variations on the same object and even the same view of the same object: Poplars, Rouen Cathedral, Mornings on the Seine, London Bridge, and Water Lilies. As Richard Boothby says, in making a point art history has long known: Monet's interest Lies not so much in the stacks themselves as in the light that animates them. It is not the focal subject matter of the paintings that most concerns him, but rather the way in which the ostensible subject presents an occasion to register infinitely less tangible aspects of the total environment in which it is situated. "For me the subject is insig nificant/' claimed Monet, "what I wish to reproduce is what is between the subject and myself." To that end, as Thadee Natanson remarked, Monet might just as well have decided to paint "a cube of stone." The haystacks themselves function, as Gustave Geffroy pointed out, as objcts passagers, merely transitory objects, that serve to reflect the subtle effects of light and air that surround them.19 What Monet is attempting to do, says Boothby is render visible the invisible conditions of visibility itself: to paint light itself. In their divergences, the proliferating technics of the last episodes of Ulysses have precisely such a seriality. It is a commonplace to say that their focus is increasingly not only on the narrated events but on the narration itself. That is true, but it is not quite enough. What seriality draws attention to, just by virtue of being serial, is something not present in any one of the terms. The seriality of the successive episodes of Ulysses, as emphasized by the Gilbert and Linati sche mas,20 regardless of their differences, draws attention to something which is not present in any narration and which cannot itself be narrated, precisely because it is the condition of all narration. We can borrow Stephen's terms: a sort of ineluctable modality of the tel lable or, to use his description in A Portrait of that "fluid and lambent narrative" that finally "refines itself out of existence, impersonalises itself, so to speak" into the famous withdrawn God of creation (P 215), a lambency in which narration is bathed. One of the effects of the remarkable innovation of these later episodes and the way their 689</page><page sequence="12">succession "sandblasts]" of all that has gone before (SL 241) is that it highlights increasingly that circuit of address within which the tell ing itself turns and yet which is itself untellable. There is nothing the slightest bit mysterious, transcendental, or obscurantist about this: it is simply a logical condition of reliability. That which lies between two narrations, the very possibility of narration and the tellable, is untellable for the same reason that the difference between two notes of music?the very thing which allows us to hear that they form a melody?is itself not a note or a melody. What comes increasingly to haunt the last episodes of Ulysses is an untellability which can never be addressed directly but which can only be glimpsed in those ever greater spaces between increasingly outlandish tellings. For Boothby, this luminous enveloppe which is the real subject of Monet's serial paintings, this impossible attempt to render the invisible conditions of visibility itself, has the logic of the Freudian unconscious, inas much as the unconscious is the unthought condition of the possibility of thought itself (19-20). In the midst of light, we find the opacity of light itself. Something opaque intrudes into narration, as the very condition of narration: something that in this welter of words?these attempts to justify to speak as if there were a closure possible?keeps some sort of dark and never fully visible non-sense, as a resistant and senseless kernel of enjoyment, like that fine tang of faintly scented urine which arrested us at the doorway. With the escalating narrational discontinuities of Ulysses, we are faced, on the level of narrative, with what Lacan will call the sinthome?the enigma at the heart of sense, the knot that, although it is itself meaningless, holds meaning together. The logic of the sinthome is everywhere in the narrated events. Stephen refuses to pray at his mother's deathbed, despite the pain it causes to his mother and to him. As Mulligan points out, there is something supremely senseless in this action, not to mention cruel (Li 1.91-94); but in that very meaninglessness, it marks out an "any thing, but not that" beyond which Stephen cannot go, since it is not an optional trait or a belief to be gently and tactfully belied but the core of his very singularity.21 Take it away, in all of its senselessness and all-but-unbearability, and Stephen too might vanish. The potato Bloom carries in his pocket is a talisman not because it is "a killer of pestilence by absorption" or "[preservative against Plague and Pestilence" but ultimately because of the bald assertion that "[i]t is nothing-There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it" (U 15.1357-58,1952, 3513-20). But the narration itself is also sinthomah as we see, say, in the sheer excessiveness of the parodies of "Cyclops" and the way in which they go on (and on) well after the point has been made (which is precisely why they are, as the schemas have it, gigantism); in the ways in which those questions and answers of AQfl</page><page sequence="13">"Ithaca" might invoke exactitude and precision but only as an end less circling fascination with the sheer facticity of those enumerations; and, indeed, in the ways in which the technics of all of the episodes throw the attention increasingly and ever more ingeniously onto the gaps between the narrated events and the narration of them. The sinthome as enigma is twofold. At first, in the seminar on the sinthome, Lacan will say that the enigma is the enunciation which can not find its enunciated, the utterance to which there corresponds no signified sense, but later on in the same seminar, this will be reversed: the enigma is the enunciated in search of enunciation, the statement that cannot find its instant of possible utterance. With the first, we have a precise description of those moments of opacity, the riddles which fill the text and which the text itself poses. With the second, we have a precise description of Joycean free indirect discourse. Both of them unhinge the circuit of address. Together, they are the sinthome. The sinthome's function is to knit together the symbolic and the real? that overlap of registers in which meaning is generated (Seminaire 20). It does this, however, as a sort of non-encounter; where the symbolic and the real threaten to drift apart, the sinthome is the way in which the encounter?tuche?can be the generation of meaning, though at the cost of the meaninglessness of the sinthome itself. The sinthome is the meeting of the real and the symbolic at the very place in which they need not meet: a striking of a match. Because the sinthome brings things together that are quite alien to each other (Seminaire 132), it is also invention, and boundless inven tion. What is it to invent? In particular, what is it to invent with words, these already stale and somewhat nauseous words, which, like the terrier's cud, have already passed through at least one mouth? Invention is not just a matter of choice and the assertion of a freedom and individuality through that choice. One does not choose one's language, says Lacan in this same session, one only imagines having chosen it (Seminaire 133). This is a familiar logic, one that Zizek calls that of the forced choice: I did not choose this option, but I affirm it as if I had anyway.22 It is the logic of things as different as falling in love and the idea of a social contract, but there is a somewhat surpris ing twist: rather than choose a language, Lacan insists, one creates it. This creation will surprisingly take us quite a distance away from the voluntarism or utilitarianism implicit in the idea of invention: One creates a language to the extent that at each moment to give it a meaning is to give a little prod, without which it would not be living. It is living only insofar as is created at every moment. That is why there is no collective unconscious. There are only particular unconsciouses, to the extent that each of them, at every moment, gives a little prod to the language it speaks. (Seminaire 133)23 691</page><page sequence="14">Joycean creation is a matter of taking this language one did not choose and at every moment marking it with the prod of singular ity of that moment. It is to invent what already imposes itself. What one takes, what imposes itself on one, is this language, already replete to sickness with meaning at this heaviest hour of the day In "Lestrygonians," there is no escape from the thoughts that are beset ting Bloom, which he is forever pushing back; even a leaflet seems to be addressing him ("Bloo .... Me? No"?li 8.08). What one invents is not more meaning, for whatever meaning one might raise is already there, in language, waiting to impose itself. Invention's prod is not meaning at all; it is the swerve that sends meaning elsewhere, its "but not that_" It is the claritas of the epiphany, according to Harari (69), where a small piece of the real, a found object as it were, reveals itself not as saturated in a hitherto unsuspected, transcendent meaning, but as the vertiginous gap of the sublime within the most banal or para lytic of meanings: "the hole," as the most terrible of the epiphanies names it, "we all have ... here."24 We recall, in closing, that as early as The Interpretation of Dreams, this navel is the name Freud first gives to that unanalysable core, the mismatch or non-conjunction that, with out itself having meaning, nevertheless sustains meaning: There is often a passage in even the most thoroughly interpreted dream which has to be left obscure; this is because we become aware during the work of interpretation that at that point there is a tangle of dream thoughts which cannot be unravelled and which moreover adds noth ing to our knowledge of the content of the dream. This is the dream's navel, the spot where it reaches down into the unknown. The dream thoughts to which we are led by interpretation cannot, from the nature of things, have any definite endings; they are bound to branch out in every direction into the intricate network of our world of thought. It is at some point where this meshwork is particularly close that the dream wish grows up, like a mushroom out of its own mycelium. (4:525) NOTES 1 On the one hand, psychoanalysis has played an important and growing part in Joyce criticism since the mid-1970s. Two of the earliest major markers (for reasons of space, I confine myself to monographs) are Mark Shechner's Joyce in Nighttown: A Psychoanalytic Inquiry into "'Ulysses" (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1974), and Sheldon Brivic's Joyce Between Freud and Jung (Port Washington, N.Y.: Kennikat Press, 1980). Any list of key psychoanalyti cally inflected work on Joyce since then would have to include Brivic's Joyce the Creator (Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Press, 1985), The Veil of Signs: Joyce, Lacan, and Perception (Urbana: Univ. of Illinois Press, 1991), and Joyce's Waking Women: An Introduction to "Finnegans Wake" (Madison: Univ. of" Wisconsin Press, 1995); Karen Lawrence's The Odyssey of Style in "Ulysses" (Princeton: 692</page><page sequence="15">Princeton Univ Press, 1981); Christine van Boheemen's The Novel as Family Romance: Language, Gender, and Authority from Fielding to Joyce (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1987); Vicki Mahaffey's Reauthorizing Joyce (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1988); Suzette Henke's James Joyce mid the Politics of Desire (New York: Routledge Publishers, 1990); Kimberly J. Devlin's Wandering and Return in "Finnegans Wake": An Integrative Approach to Joi/ce's Fictions (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1991); Jean-Michel Rabate's James Joyce, Authorized Reader (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1991), Joyce Upon the Void: The Genesis of Doubt (Houndmills, Basingstoke: Macmillan Publishers, 1991), and James Joyce and the Politics of Egoism (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2001); and Luke Thurston's James Joyce and the Problem of Psychoanalysis (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ Press, 2004). On the other hand, Joyce also becomes crucial to psychoanalysis when Jacques Lacan turns to him in his 1970s seminar and after, recorded in Le Seminaire XXIII: Le. Sinthome, 1975-1976, ed. Jacques-Alain Miller (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 2005). Jacques Aubert, whose 1973 book The Aesthetics of James Joyce (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1992) is a standard refer ence, acted as Lacan's guide to Joyce at this time and drew together the first publication of Lacan's work on Joyce entitled Joyce avec Lacan (Paris: Navarin, 1.987). Rabate is as much a Lacanian scholar as he is a Joycean, as seen in his Jacques Lacan: Psychoanalysis and the Subject of Literature (Houndmills, Basingstoke: Palgrave Press, 2001), and his editorship of the two impor tant collections, Lacan in America (New York: Other Press, 1990), and The Cambridge Companion to Lacan (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2003), The same can be said of Thurston, who edited the collection Reinventing the Symptom: Essays on the Final Lacan (New York: Other Press, 2002), and is the translator of Roberto Harari's seminar, How fames Joyce Made His Name: A Reading of the Final Lacan (New York: Other Press, 2002). Further references to the Lacan Seminaire and the Harari book will be cited parenthetically in the text, the former as Seminaire. 2 As John Gordon says, in "The Match in 'Aeolus': A Vestal Version," JJQ, 39 (Spring 2002), 550, this passage "is obviously, as everyone says, a parody of hack novelistic rhetoric and the portentous sense of ineluctable causality that often goes with it." He cites, in turn, Robert Spoo, who, in his ]ames Joyce and the Language of History (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1994), p. 82, says it "parodies the teleological rhetoric of the nineteenth-century Bildungsroman" Don Gifford, with Robert J. Seidman, in "Ulysses" Annotated: Notes for James Joyce's "Lllysses," rev. ed. (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1989), p. 146, calls it a "stylistic intrusion" that "echoes the Dickens of David Copperfield and Great Expectations." Later critics and annotators often echo this. Jeri Johnson's notes to her Oxford World's Classics edition of "Ulysses": The 1922 Text (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1993), p. 815, invoke the same novels. Further references to the Johnson edition will be cited parenthetically in the text. So does Robert H. Bell, for whom "[i]t is as though Pip or David Copperfield, with their mannered elegance and sentimental styles, had suddenly materialized in the Dublin newsroom?see Jocoserious Joyce: The Fate of Folly in "Ulysses" (Gainesville: Univ. Press of Florida, 1996), p. 120. Paul van Caspel suggests that here "[t]he situation reminds [Stephen] somehow of a passage such as might be found in certain cloak-and-dagger stories" and that Joyce is "clearly parodying phrases that we only expect to encounter in 693</page><page sequence="16">a certain kind of novel, belonging to so-called trivial or pulp literature"?see van Caspel's Bloomers on the Liffey: Eisegetical Readings of Joyce's "Ulysses" (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ, Press, 1986), p. 115. 3 Sigmund Freud, The Interpretation of Dreams, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Trend, ed. James Strachey et al. (London: Hogarth Press, 1953), 5:561-62. Further references to Freud's writings will be cited parenthetically in the text by volume and page number. See also his Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (15:212). 4 The Standard Edition usually, but not always, translates this as "deferral" or "deferred action." Though Freud uses the term as early as the 1896 "Project for a Scientific Psychology" (see, for example, 1:356), the locus classicus is the Wolf-Man case history, where it is only with the much later dream of the wolves that the very young child's sight of his parents copulating will become something traumatic: "He received the impressions when he was one and a half; his understanding of them was deferred, but became possible at the time of the dream [at age four] owing to his development, his sexual excitations and his sexual researches"?see "From the History of an Infantile Neurosis" (17:37-38). 5 Freud, "Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria" (7:1-122). 6 Lacan, "The Instance of the Letter in the Unconscious or Reason since Freud," Ecrits: The First Complete Edition in English, trans.

G. Jung, trans. R. F. C. Hull (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1966), 15:122-23. As Shechner says of it, in Joyce in Night town (in a comment that is true of much of Jung's output), "it should not be confused with psychoanalysis" (p. 264). 8 Italo Svevo, James Joyce, trans.

Patrick Healy, in "Joyce: Through the Lacan Glass," Lacanian Ink, 11 (1995), 28, points out that "Jung's essay on Ulysses was considered wounding and rude by Joyce, who asked Daniel Brody why it was so, to be told that one only needed to translate Joyce's name into German," 11 See Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud, ed. Lionel Trilling and Stephen Marcus (Harmondsworth: Penguin Publishers, 1964), p. 288.

Press, 1997), pp. 371-72. 14 If the "Telemachia" episodes begin by staging that site from which "others see me," they end with a reminder that this is an empty place. After picking his nose on the beach, Stephen has just remembered that he has no 694</page><page sequence="17">handkerchief: My handkerchief. He threw it I remember. Did I not take it up? His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, 1 didn't. Better buy one. He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, care fully For the rest let look who will. Behind. Perhaps there is someone. He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship. (LI 3.498-505) Whatever comes to occupy this point from which the gaze seems to originate is not ail-seeing but blind. In the cabman's shelter that evening, the sailor Murphy reveals that he and his fellow sailors "come up this morning eleven o'clock. The threemaster Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks" (U 16,450-51), but whether or not he might (quite improbably) have actually seen Stephen's guilty act is irrelevant. The little cloud that serves to triangulate Bloom and Stephen at the beginning of the day works in a similar way (it 1.248, 4.218), as does the trajectory of the viceregal carriage across Dublin in "Wandering Rocks," but now with a political, almost panoptical, dimension. 15 Lacan, "The Subversion of the Subject," Ecrits (pp. 672-73). 16 Lacan writes, in The Seminar of Jacques Lacan, Book 11: The Ego in Freud's Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis 1954-1955, ed. Jacques-Alain Miller, trans. Sylvana Tomaselli (New York: W. W. Norton, 1988), p. 44, "[T]he ego isn't the L ... It is something else?a particular object within the expe rience of the subject.
