<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV.-CRITICAL REALISM AND SUBSTANCE. BY RoY WOOD SELLIARS. CRITICAL realists are in the stimulating position of being forced to reanalyse many categories which idealism had too hastily thrown into the discard. In recent writings I have tried to show that knowledge of genuinely external, or transcendent, objects is possessed by the human mind and have pointed to the mechanism which mediates such direct knowledge. Such direct knowledge, I have argued, rests upon the cognitive, or revelatory, value of discriminated contents which function within the act of cognition. The critical realist differs from the naYve realists chiefly in two ways: (1) he is aware of the mechanism making knowledge possible and not, as the naive realist, only of the result; and (2) he is led by reflexion to revise the content of knowledge, that is, the object as thought. Such a theory of knowledge may be said to lie between naive realism and representative realism, for it asserts, with the first, the directness of knowing and, with the second, the contents and processes which mediate this direct knowing. Its insight comes from a more careful study of the conditions and claims of knowing than was possible in the seventeenth century. Now, may not this alteration in theory of knowledge involve a new approach to the category of substance ? Instead of rejecting substantial things-as the idealist was led to do-may we not accept them and interpret them without landing in any self- contradiction ? In the present paper I wish to study the category of substance in the light of modern science and critical realism. As a physical realist I believe in physical systems (ordinarily called things) which exist independently of our knowing them and which have specific characteristics. From the very beginning I want to dissociate this return to substance from Cartesian dualism. I can see no a priori reason why certain evolved physical things, such as human organisms, should not have mental properties and include psychical processes. Such, as is well known, is the thesis of emergent, or 82</page><page sequence="2">474 ROY WOOD SELLARS: evolutionary, naturalism. X But more of this particular point later. The elimination of substance as a category began with idealism. The first step was the rejection of physical sub- stance. Leibniz and Berkeley may be said to have inaugurated this development. And then came empiricism and phenomen- alism with a like attack upon spiritual substance. Something of a compromise on this latter was symbolised by the adoption of the term subject by the idealism of the nineteenth century. When we look over this movement, we soon realise that it was motivated by two lines of argument which reenforced one another, viz., (1) an epistemological motive and (2) a logical motive. The first cast doubt on genuinely external, or transcendent, objects, while the second sought to point out contradictions in the very idea of such realities. I shall argue that this whole development had only a partial validity. Because of an inadequate epistemology, possibilities were ignored which must again be brought to light. It is my present purpose to explore these possibilities. While I have indicated them in my books, I have apparently done so in such a terse fashion that they have been misunderstood or ignored. I. Locke is a convenient point of departure. I believe that it can be maintained that Locke's theory of substance was somewhat of a parody of even the Medieval doctrine. As is well known, Locke formulated his position in such a way as to leave substance, or matter, a hidden core supporting adjec- tival entities called primary qualities. This construction was, open to the objections, advanced by Berkeley, which we shall shortly study. Is substance unknowable ? Is it something hidden by its very nature from cognitiona? Does it support entities which can be called qualities and which are really extrinsic to it ? I shall try to show that this whole formula- tion is vicious and unnecessary. The physical realist believes in physical systems having definite knowable characteristics. Is this belief vulnerable to Berkeley's arguments ? In other words, can we think external physical things without falling into logical absurdities'? We may call external things physical systems and consider them substantial or substantive. What do we mean by this ? Surely several things. We consider them existents which are continuants and not dependent upon something else like mind or deity for their existence. This means that we hold</page><page sequence="3">CRITICAL REALISM AND SUBSTANCE. 475 them to be self-existent. Such self-existence does not imply self-sufficiency in the sense that they are unaffected by their surroundings. Surely self-existence does not involve isolation of the sort affirmed in extreme pluralism. Pbysical systems are concrete bodies in, definite commerce with other physical systems. And commerce presupposes existence rather than creates it. With this frank physical realism in mind let us for a inoment return to Berkeley's criticism of Locke's formulation., Locke had set up a substratum spread under accidents. Notice that we have spoken of things having characteristics. We have not as yet set up any theory as to what character- istics are nor as to how things possess them,. That we shall do shortly. In the Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous, Philonous suggests that this substratum is some- thing in its own nature entirely different fromn its accidents. Hylas replies: "I tell you, extension is only a mode, and Matter is something which supports modes. And is it not evident the thing supported is different from the thing supporting? " And Philonous: " So that something distinct from, and exclusive of, extension is supposed to be the sub- stratum of extension?" Clearly, this leads to the difficulty of conceiving the relation between matter (substance) and its primary qualities if they are thus external to each other. But we must ask whether this construction is necessary. Is the relation of its characteristics to a physical thing to be thought of as a relation between an unknowable substratum and the accidents it supports ? It is obvious that we must determine the nature and the reach of knowledge, on the one hand, and the relation between an object and its determinate nature, on the other hand, before we can go farther. In what follows I shall try to reanalyse the whole situation and keep in mind both the ontological categories and the cognitive approach to those categories. Surely characteristics are not adjectival entities supported externally. When properly in- terpreted they are intrinsic to the thing known. The thing is the reality and includes its nature seamlessly. It is our thinking which distinguishes between a thing and its charac- teristics and is easily misled into a false separation between the two on the ontological side. We reify that about the object which we can discern and are then, perhaps, led to the idea of a substratum to support these reifications. I shall argue that we must at one and the same time give up this kind of a substratum and this kind of qualities. We must think more delicately and carefully.</page><page sequence="4">476 ROY WOOD SELLARS: II. Let us disregard Locke and come back freely to the deliverances of our own knowing. Can we then harrmonise our cognition with the ontology which it seems to set up? To me it is a demand of knowing that the object known be of a determina3te nature. It is a that-what. But Locke's construction is a parody of this demand. The determinate nature of an object is intrinsically inseparable from the object and not stuck oni it externally in some incomprehensible fashion. Here we are face to face with ontology. It is evident that characteristics are not entities and do not need support. Their relation to their object is far more intimate than that. They are elements of the nature of the, object. But even this way of putting it is not penetrative enough. We must not think of the nature of an object as in any way distinct from the object. The object is a determinate object. Thus when we say that a physical thing is extended we do not mean that there is some substratum which possesses an adjectival entity called extension but simply that the thing is correctly thought of aos extended. It is that kind of a deter- minate object. To say that a thing has a definite structure does not mean that there is a substratum which owns an entity called structure but simply that the thing is intrinsically structured. And so on. This means that we must not be controlled by grammatical forms or by metaphors, but that ,we must seek to clarify our actual thought of objects. This analysis signifies that when we speak of that-what or things with determinate natures we really mean determinate ,objects. As we shall see, our unavoidable cognitive approach -to objects tends to make the nature of objects, that which we iknow about objects, stand out almost in abstraction from the ,object. It is to avoid this epistemological abstractness that we must stress ontologically the fact that the reality is a determinate object in determinate relations with other ,objects. I would hold, then, that the categories of object -and the nature of the object are mutually implicatory. The Teality is the determinate thing. But our knowledge picks out the determinations of the determinate thing and abstracts ,them, for it is the only way we can think the object. Thus,, -unless we are on our guard, our inevitable cognitive approach .tends to introduce a dualism into the object which ontologi- cally does not exist. We speak of a thing (subject of the judgment) which has properties (predicates of the judgment). But we should penetrate beyond this logical form to reality as thought as against the mechanism of our thinking it.</page><page sequence="5">CRITICAL REALISM AND SUBSTANCE. 477 Logical structure must not be identified with ontological structure. Now if this basic reality of a determinate object, a that- what, is once granted, we can reject at once the scheme which dominated representative realism of the Lockian type and animated Berkeley's dialectic. ' Support' and ' inhere in' and 'spread under' are clearly totally misleading metaphors for this basic and ultimate unity. The determinate nature of an object is not something distinct in any fashion from the object. The object aind its nature, or characteristics,. are intrinsically one. In knowing its characteristics, we know- the object; and this is the only way we can know it. And, for the physical realist, the object is. a physical system of a definite sort. We must not think of the object as retreating from its characteristics into a sort of majestic aloofness; nor must we think of an inner core as unknowable and an outer shell as knowable. To know a physical system is to know it as extended, massive, structured, behaving, etc. That is the way the object manifests itself and that is the way the object is in itself. If this analysis holds, Locke committed the sin of separating the object (physical system) and its nature so that the object becomes a something-I-know-not-what back of its nature as a complex of primary qualities which are, as it were, hypos- tatised into entities which must be supported. Knowledge is given the deceptive goal of a substratum which cannot be known and which yet cries out to be known. But if this substratum has no deterininate nature, is it even a possible object of knowledge? And if it has no determinate nature and is, therefore, not a possible object of knowledge, is it not, as Berkeley argued, a complete fiction? Surely, the only way of intellectual salvation is to see that the attempt to change the nature of an object into a set of entities called accidents, or qualities, is to distort the intrinsie and unique identity of a thing and its characteristics. In fact, I am reluctant to use the term relation in this connexion for I have found that philosophers have constantly been mis- led by it. It seems to me, rather, that when we speak of the. characteristics of a thing we are making a logical distinction which invdlves no existential'separateness. III. Since I anm at present engaged in a constructive analysis, I shall disregard the history of the distinction between a sub- stance and its accidents, only registering my conviction that</page><page sequence="6">478 ROY WOOD SELLAR S: this distinction is a mistake. It is truer to our actual think- ing to speak of a thing and its characteristics. And even here we must not be misled by language. A thing is not separate from its characteristics, nor are characteristics separate from the thing. The characteristics of a thing are that about a thing which can be cognitively grasped. There are, then, two errors to be avoided. We must not reduce a thing to its characteristics because the reality is a determinate thing. And we mnust not rob a thing of its de- terminate nature and thus make it an unknowable. Idealism has always tended to make the first mistake, while agnosticism has made the second. We must move with more delicacy than have these positions. We know things. What, then, does knowledge grasp? Idealism and neo-realism tend un- avoidably to identify the that with the what. Existence disappears into its characteristics. The object passes into knowledge without a remainder. It is against this that the critical realist protests. Knowledge is knowledge, and yet it is never the actual equivalent of the object. It reveals the object, and yet it is other than the object. We cognitively grasp the nature of the object but, in so doing, we get the nature as an abstraction. No literal part of the object gets into our minds. It is, as it were, the ghostly, outline, or form, of things which we grasp. To realise this is to understand what human knowledge of external things is. It inevitably falls short of being itself. And yet it is knowledge. This means that we must not expect of knowledge what knowledge cannot give. It is a revelation of the structure, relative quantity and behaviour of objects; but the objects as realities are structured, massive, energetic; they play a role in the economy of nature; they exist. To appreciate our knowledge of things is at the same time to understand what knowledge can never be. Being is always other than knowledge. To know a thing is not to be it. It is a cognitive grasping of the determinate nature of an object, these determinations being translated into human formuloe of measurements and patterns and possibilities. In this sense, it is a genuine vision of the nature of the object, that is, of the object as a determinate thing. But such a vision pre- supposes the object's existence, presupposes that there is a realm of being. I am quite aware that this epistemology which stresses the peculiar nature and reach of knowledge breaks sharply with immanentist traditions. It is, however, inseparable from a frank physical realism. We interpret things in terms of logical ideas which reveal their characteristics or determina-</page><page sequence="7">CRITICAL REALISM AND SUBSTANCE. 479 tions. We believe that physical systems are extended, measurable, structured, active. But this does not mean that things are equatable with a complex of universals. Sense- data and universals are immanent, are intrinsic to the act of cognition; while characteristics are as transcendent as physi- cal things themselves. It is in this fashion that an adequate epistemology harmonises with ontological demands. IV For my form of critical realism, knowing is an interpreta- tion of the object, a peculiar grasping of its characteristics or determinations in terms of, and by means of, logical ideas held before the attention in the complex act of cognition. These logical ideas are intrinsic to the mental act which is a brain-mind act resting on the activity of the whole organism. It is a postulated revelation of the nature of the object and this turns out to be pattern, that is, constitution, composition, behaviour, all presented at the scientific level of cognition in terms of the results of measurement. What we know about things is a kind of abstraction, a sort of ontological form, the logical outline of things. We are now in a position to discuss the age-old question of univiersalia in re. I would distinguish sharply between universals and charac- teristics or determinations. Universals, like all logical ideas, seem to me to be always in mente. That is, they are intrinsic to the complex act of cognition by means of which the object is known. It is the characteristic of the object that is in re, as constituting its determinate nature. Thus universals are in re only in a Pickwickian sense as cognitively revealing the specific characteristics which are intrinsic to things. In knowledge they are so one with the characteristics which they reveal that we do not at the moment distinguish them and give them their proper locus. And yet as soon as we step from epistemology to ontology we must do so or else get into all sorts of unreal problems. Because universals are logical tools for revealing the characteristics of things the statement that universals are in things is an ellipsis for say- ing that we know the characteristics of things in terms of universals. And this cognitive union expresses an ultimate correspondence between them which makes the ellipsis almost Justifiable. The determinations of reality are translatable into universals. It is for this reason that we can speak of the physical world as having a logical structure. It is, if you will, a touch of anthropomorphism, and yet an unavoidable</page><page sequence="8">480 ROY WOOD SELLARS: one. And since the critical realist maintains that the object with the assistance of the subject controls this logical struc- ture in the mind, it is an anthropomorphism which calls attention to man's oneness with the world. Yet ontologically the characteristics of a thing are as trans- cendent as the thing itself and one with it. They are also as specific as the thing of whicn they are the characteristics. Each specific characteristic is sustained by the object and is seamlessly one with it. In this fashion the critical realist assigns universals to epistemology and characteristics to ontology. This distinction between universal and characteristic seems to me to clear up many points which have hitherto involved confusion. It rids us of the temptation to postulate entities of a timeless sort called essences (Santayana and Drake) or eternal objects (Whitehead) with their ingressions and embodiments. To speak of essences as embodied in objects is to resort to a misleading metaphor. And yet, unless the distinction between universals and characteristics is made, universals must be in re or else agnosticism follows. I would also suggest that this distinction does justice to the motives underlying Stout's distributive theory of universals. It is the specificity of characteristics that Stout-if I mistake not-has in mind. In this analysis I am, I presume, nearer to Aristotle than to Plato. In fact, I am very much of an anti-Platonist even though I recognise to the full the contributions of Plato to an adequate theory of knowing. But while I am nearer to Aristotle than to Plato, I dissent from Aristotle in my con- ception of ontological form. I would take a step still farther from Plato, a step still nearer naturalism and to the intrinsic unity of form and matter. Being is always formed being. There is no being without form and no form apart from being. But more of this later. This distinction between universals, as intrinsic to the act of cognition, and characteristics as intrinsic to the object known enables us to deal with another of the puzzles of thought, the problem of individuality. Idealism has tended to conceive an object as a complex of universals. This led to the difficulty of differentiating one thing from another. The realist, on the other hand, appealed to a stuff which, united with universals, would give individuality. The stuff of a thing was the principle of individuality. But this stuff was unknowable and also the nature of the union was scarcely thinkable. We may say that physical realism has always been handicapped by this apparently unescapable dualism.</page><page sequence="9">CRITICAL REALISM AND SUBSTANCE. 481 Let us see whether critical realism can avoid it. Do we know one element of reality and are we ignorant of another element ? Or do we know an object in knowing its characteristics? It is readily seen that, once we clearly distinguish between universals and the specific characteristics of an object which they cognitively reveal, this traditional problem takes on a new and solvable form. A physical system is not a peculiar union of a stuff and universals. Instead, it is an organised whole with determinate characteristics expressive of what it is. In knowing these characteristics, we know the physical system. But, unless we are very careful, cognition, which knows the object in terms of its characteristics, leads us to abstract and reify the characteristics and thus to introduce a dualism in the object. It has been our thesis, instead, that ontological form is intrinsic to the object. The reality is a formed, or deter- minate, stuff. Knowledge reaches to things and illuminates them; and yet there is a plus to things which must not be ignored. We are here confronted by one of the most delicate problems of thought. It is the question of the precise grasp of knowledge. It grasps objects after its own nature; we do know objects. And yet this grasping is always other than a being of the object. The abstracted form of an object is a shadow, an outline. The reality is the formed object. In this sense, cognition enables us to know an. object, and yet such knowledge is other than being. The physical realist believes that ontology rejects as inadequate and mistaken a purely logical realism. V But before I study the category of being in more detail I would like to say a few more words about universals and their r6le in cognition. I shall be very brief and concern myself with the relation of universals to sense-data and to the specific characteristics of things. First, how can two objects be known by means of the same universal ? My reply is, that specificity does not involve uniqueness. The roundness of one pea is existentially as specific as the roundness of another pea, both being expressive of the metabolism of the pea in the pod. This specific characteristic is intrinsic to the kind of physical system, to its energies, to its line of growth. Yet this fact does not pre- clude the similarity of results. Hence, they can both be correctly enough revealed by the same logical idea, sense- datum at the perceptual level, universal at the explicit, judgmental level. Let us remember that it is things that we</page><page sequence="10">482 ROY WOOD SELLARS: compare primarily and not universals; this is because cogni- tion is directed first at things. And this is why we speak of two things as alike when they are revealed by the same universal. We have every reason to accept the world as it is known. And this world of ours is known as containing many similar things. And once we distinguish between logical ideas functioning in acts of cognition and specific characteristics intrinsic to objects, this otherness involves no contradiction. We do not have to speak even of the same universal embodied in different matter. Our epistemology must harmonise with the necessities of ontology. And by this distinction between universals and specific characteristics we have shown how this is possible. We should note that universals grow up in the mind in the process of knowing objects. They are moulded upon that activity, and universals take final form in judgment with its use of language. Here we have a high level of symbolisation and generalisation. All this tends to make us forget that in specific acts of cognition these tiniversals are nearly always specified to fit specific data. This shape is never quite like that shape; this colour is seldom the exact shade of that other. In strict universals we stress what may be called a type which covers and permits variations. These variations are the instances. For this reason it has seemed to me best to speak of logical ideas or logical discriminations to cover both sense- data and universals. I would hold that such logical ideas reveal the characteristics of objects and are so used in inter- pretative cognition. Logical ideas may be sensory or they may be conceptual. In both cases their function is the same in cognition. And it is out of primitive logical ideas that universals in the strict sense arise and it is upon them that they rest. There is this much truth in the distributive theory of universals. And yet this theory reflects still more a con- fused sense of the specificity of characteristics in the object known. We are at last ready to handle the problem of substance constructively. Our point of departure is this, that we know individual physical things in terms of their specific character- istics and that these are not entities supported by an unknow- able substratum, but the outline, or form, of the thing disclosed to cognition and standing out abstractly as a consequence. We also realise that knowledge has the reach peculiar to its nature. It grasps the characteristics of things but cannot participate in their being. This ultimate thing knowledge can never do. It is as near to an external thing as we can</page><page sequence="11">CRITICAL REALISM AND SUBSTANCE. 483 get. But to know a thing is not to be it. Knowledge falls short of existence. And, finally, let ine point out that, contrary to Dr. Bosanquet's dialectic, the critical realist regards the existent as a that-what and never a mere that. VI. From the beginning, then, we can reject the Lockian construction as false and misleading. A clearer idea of characteristics shows us 'that they are not entities to be externally supported by a substratum. It is the whole determinate thing which exists. Characteristics taken by themselves are abstractions. But if characteristics taken by themselves are abstractions, what is it that exists? How shall we conceive existence? We are on the track of the meaning of such terms as stuff, matter, physical reality, content of being. What do these terms stand for? To answer this question we come back again to the context of cognition. The act of cognition is the expression of ourselves as existents and is directed toward another existent. Both the known and the knower are realities. Now in going back to the, level of naive realism we quickly note our sense of exist- ences, that is, of something as real as ourselves to which we must adjust ourselves. This sense of reality is, I am sure, coexistent with any specific knowledge. It furnishes the context of it. Things are as real as we ourselves are. All this involves no intu1ition of being but merely our sense of reality, something which grows up in us on adequate psycho- logical grounds. It has been abundantly proven that our sense of external existence grows up in us step by step with our sense of our own existence and vice versa. Thinghood is, accordingly, a category which has a normal development in human thought. It develops step by step with our know- ledge of the nature of these existents which surround us. Now I should hold it a great mistake to assume that our sense of reality involves any intuition of the content of exist- ence. It is much more an attitude with correspondent meanings. The nuclear ingredient in our thought of thing- hood is this sense of external existence. It furnishes the sheet-anchor of knowledge but is not itself an element of knowledge. Rather is it a presupposition of knowledge with which knowledge must harmonise. Hence it is not a pre- dicate in the ordinary sense, a fact which both Hume and Kant realised and which is often to-day expressed by the saying that we cannot define existence. The most we can</page><page sequence="12">484 ROY WOOD SELLARS: do is to point out the experience and indicate its psychological foundations. Now this affirmation of an object, this sense of external things, is the context of cognition. From the time of Aris- totle it has been recognised. The subject of a judgment symbolises an individual: thing which is interpreted by predicates. Individual things are, then, existents. They are substan- tives. Here we have the ultim-late fact which all knowing presupposes and develops. It seems to me that, in philosophy. the terms, matter, stuff, content of being, etc., have but reflected this ultimate situation. They have stood for being existence, what exists. None of these terms should be taken to imply any particular scientific theory of the content of being. Matter in the philosophical sense may be variously interpreted-according to the prevailing knowledge-as inert stuff, energy, electricity, waves in ether. But in each case it presupposes this, more basic meaning of that which exists; And clearly, if critical realism is right, the characteristics of being must conform to our tested knowledge. Being must be capable of organisation to form physical systems capable of various kinds of behaviour. To-day our knowledge of the external world proclaims that that which exists is active and system-forming. The kind of matter that Berkeley rejected as unable to cause ideas is no longer believed in. We conclude that that which exists is known as regards its characteristics. It is not an unknowable substratum supporting accidents. Knowledge is directed at things and is an interpretation of them, but it does not deny, rather does it presuppose, their self-existence. This means that things have a kind of reality that predicates can never have. Knowledge is a vision of the characteristics of things, but things exist. And this is why we feel that a thing cannot be reduced to its characteristics taken abstractly. To ignore this is the mistake of idealistic rationalism. And there is a kind of logical realism to which Mr. Russell frequently succumbs which commits the same mistake. Another way of putting what I am driving at is this. The specific char- acteristics of things are not entities but distinctions in the nature of things; and these distinctions are translated into universals or logical ideas in our mind. Now when these logical ideas are taken apart from the reference of cognition in which they reveal the specific characteristics of things they are mere logical contents sustained by the mind yet having no concern with existence. Those 'who forget their cognitive use forget existence.</page><page sequence="13">CRITICAL REALISM AND SUBSTANCE. 485 Now because we, the 'knowers, are also existents, this sense of existence is deepened by our feeling of our own activities and purposes. This is the reason why voluntarism-when properly understood-has always checked extreme rational- ism. Voluntarism has expressed a fuller sense of reality than external cognition alone could grant us. Of course, this does not mean that we must naively read into nature at the inorganic level our feelings and volitions, as analogical pan- psychism has tended to do. I have argued, then, that cognition haos an existential -ontext expressed in such a category as thinghood'okr existence. As I understand it, all the critical realists are at one here. Thus Strong speaks of a sensibly mediated intent, Santayana of animal faith, myself of an interpretative affirmation. We respond to the things-which are stimulating us at the level of perception. But there has been much misunderstanding of a phrase we have used. I have said, for instance, that we cannot intuit the stuff of things. What does this mean? It is simply a way of calling attention to the nature of our actual knowledge of objects. In knowing, we grasp interpretatively the characteristics-for instance, the structure, relative size and mass, the ways of behaving-of things; but we cannot literally get over to, and absorb or sample, the things them- selves. We know objects, but we cannot be them or have them materially in our minds. Thus this expression was not meant as a declaration of agnosticism but as an indication of the nature of human knowing as mediated by logical ideas. Naive realism, because it accepts sensory qualities, is led to what I might call an inspectional view of knowing. It seems that we are aware of the literal surface of things. Now the critical realist is led to refine the predicates in terms of which we think things until this surface-quality is re- linquished. In this it is one with science. Knowing finally turtns out to be a grasping of the structure, composition, relative sizes, connexions and behaviour of things rather than of sensory qualities. Thus all temptation to a literal inspection of things vanishes. We assuredly know objects, but we now better realise what knowing is and what it grasps. We may say that, after its kind, human knowing has no fixed limits. It can explore and decipher the characteristics of physical systems as far as man's patience and technique will carry him. But such knowledge cannot transform itself into something else. It can never become the equivalent of being. Self-existence, or substantiality, is the ontological context which knowing presupposes.</page><page sequence="14">486 ROY WOOD SELLARS: What, then, are characteristics? And what is their rela- tion to physical systems? I think that it is best to follow the detailed categories of thought as this is directed to things. We think things as structured, extended, behaving, massive. Surely we must regard these categories as giving us specifie insight into the very nature of things. These determinations are not stuck on a blank substratum; they arise out of, and are intrinsic to, determinate things. And we cannot get nearer to things than their determinations or nature. Being is a that-what. VII. In this concluding section I wish to examine very briefly three things: (1) the distinction between primary. and secondary qualities; (2) the position of panpsychisn1; and (3) the substitution of the category of event for that of substance. I should hold that there is no good reason to retain-and many reasons against retaining-what I should call sensory, qualitative predicates in our thought of external things. These must be taken up into a more critical judgment which brings out the fact that they are functions of many condi- tions and cannot be so reformulated that they give insight into the external object. The external event with which colour, e.g., can be correlated seems of the nature of an electronic vibration. Size, shape, structure and behaviour predicates-seem to be not sensory in a qualitative sense so much as formal and relational. Critical realism points out that such predicates are revelatory of the characteristics of things but need refine- ment and development before we accept them as adequately interpretative of things. This development is carried through by science. A critical predicate gives not an intuition of the absolute 'size of an object-an ideal that perception at first suggests-but a ratio which is yet significant for the object. It seems to me that we must distinguish between the characteristics of an object, which must be specific and intrinsic, and the terms in which we formulate and estimate those characteristics. To say that an object is five feet long is a very indirect way of getting at the size of an object, and yet it must give us something of the nature of a revela- tion of the actual size of the object. It must enable us to think the object clearly. I have argued in many places that the so-called primary qualities are really those characteristics of objects which are in some measure reproducible in our mind in an abstract way. Thus the pattern of things is</page><page sequence="15">CRITICAL REALISM AND SUBSTANCE. 487 reproducible in different media. The form of the cause can appear in the effect, whereas passive qualities would have no way of reproducing themselves. It should be noticed, then, that I would not speak of .prinmary qualities but of intrinsic characteristics. I might point out in this connexion that the essence wing of critical realism, while they have usually asserted their belief that colours and flavours are not a part of the essence of the object, have never clearly explained why this class of essences are never embodied in objects. In other words, they have never gone far into the logic of science. Perhaps it is because of this that many younger thinkers are following Whitehead instead. We come now to panpsychism and neutral monism. It will be recalled that I denied the necessity of starting with ontological dualism. It has always been my argument that the knowledge gained by the so-called objective sciences- those sciences depending upon the facts of perceptual ob- servation-was limited to the characteristics so revealed. In other words, I denied that such knowledge participated in the content of being. But, so I have held, in consciousness we are literally on the inside of being in the case of our brains. Consciousness is a qualitative dimension of beinzg character- is tic of this high level of emergent evolution. I have called this the double-knowledge approach to the mind-body problem.' It is, I think, fair to point out that Mr. Russell has adopted this position lately without, apparently, any awareness of my priority. I would also point out that this position cannot be connected with the neutral-monism view because the episte- mology is entirely different. Mr. Russell has been swinging to my form of critical realism and away from the view that sensations are neutral entities having an external status, as in his Analysis of Mind. His old view was, of course, a, development of James's radical empiricism. The older panpsychism was analogical and agnostic. It was reared on a theory of unknowable things in themselves. Recently Strong and Drake have devised a doctrine which makes sentience an almost unknowable mind-stuff (but how does it deserve the name sentience?) while consciousness with its contents are appearances. " All the data of consciousness," writes Drake, "are mass-effects, products of 'fusion '." It is an ingenious doctrine of motor reaction which leads to the 1 Sellars, Evolutionary Naturalismn, ch. xiv.; Aristotelian Society Proceedings, 1922-3.

There is a fusion which is an illusory fusion, a6nd not- a cerebral integration. I have great admiration for the ingenuity of the doctrine. But I myself believe in actual integration with intrinsic, emergent novelties. All 'levels of the psychical seem to me to be such intrinsic novelties, of the nature of a qualitative dimension within the brain-mind. As to the content of being at lower levels, I have no first-hand information. Thus my theory of knowledge excludes any form of naive materialism. It is important to note that the Drake-Strong doctrine of essences, which are not mental but are appearances somehow intuited, goes with their theory of consciousness as against mind-stuff. I, on the other hand, hold that logical ideas are discriminations within the act of cognition intrinsic to the cerebral response, which is, itself, a part of the whole organic response to the object. Last of all, I come to the doctrine of events. Why substitute this category for that of a substantial system within which events occur! I must confess that the motives of Russell and Whitehead seem to me connected with a rejection of the permanent core, or substratum, view. I certainly would not hold matter to be changeless. I would introduce the notion of activity into the very heart of being. And yet I still feel that the term event does not furnish'a suitable category for such systems as minerals and organisms. Where is the idea of system, of organisation? And Russell still seems to me to want to identify things with logical construc- tions. At heart, he is not yet a frank physical realist. In a recent review in MIND of my kook, The Princijples and Problems of Philosophy, Miss Stebbing took occasion to say that she did not quite understand my view of substance.
