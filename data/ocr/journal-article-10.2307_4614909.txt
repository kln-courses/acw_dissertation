<plain_text><page sequence="1">Poetry Today In an essay appended to The Night of Akhenaton, a new selection of the poetry of Agnes Nemes Nagy (1922-91), the Hungarian poet argues that her work is situated in "a no-man's land of the nameless." It is a striking phrase which, moreover, points to analogous aspirations of other key twentieth-century European writers. Recalling Rilke's remark about poets standing arrested at borders and grabbing at "nameless things," this image of an unclaimed or uninhabited land- ambiguous or indefinite in character and perhaps extending between opposing armies-provides a graphic way of thinking about how certain poets have lingered solitarily in zones ignored or avoided by others. Some of those zones are perilous. Nemes Nagy conceives "no-man's land" and "nameless" in no mystical way. She is speaking about ordinary Budapest streets and certain "nameless emotions" that can be garnered in them. Later she contemplates mere forests, lakes, or fall- ing snow: This downpouring of silence, I don't even know if I'm hearing it, this hardly-there snow-pallor, I don't even know if I'm seeing it Only the pine tree, only the roof, outlines on which it falls as it hesitates at peripheries brightens and appals. What she means by emotion thus com- prises questioning, self-questioning, and learning, all cognitive phenomena that are usually associated with rationality alone. It is this poetic angle and critical viewpoint that provoke thought, for only a few stubborn observers, from philoso- phers David Hume and Maine de Biran to the contemporary neurologist Antonio Damasio, have likewise considered emo- tions to be essential for understanding the human condition. Some poets may be "specialists of the emotions," as Nemes Nagy contends, but certainly the overall role of the emotions in literature has never been satisfactorily elucidated. For her, poetry wages an "epistemological cam- paign . . . in the domain of our own unnamed emotions in order to enlarge our awareness." Be assured that she does not equate poetry with epistemology. She is ex- tremely attentive to the music of the Hun- garian language, especially its rhymes- of which her most recent translator, the poet George Szirtes, provides pleasing parallels. Her critical remarks are in fact prefaced by a technical description of how "agglutination" in Hungarian is one of the reasons twentieth-century Hungarian poetry-taking advantage of the language's assonantal riches-is much more rhymed than is usual in most other literatures. As for</page><page sequence="2">Poetry Today 789 rhythm, the sharp juncture of the syllables has made it possible for three rhythmic systems to live side by side in Hungarian poetry: one stressed, one quantitative, and one a combination of the two. This unusual feature ... proves without doubt its thorough prosodic sophistication, its rich poetic possibilities. The reputation of this incisive poet was launched just after the Second World War. She and her husband, the critic Balazs Lengyel, co-founded the best Hungarian literary magazine of the day, Ujhold ("New Moon"). Yet after a bril- liant start, during which T. S. Eliot, Eugenio Montale, George Seferis, Eugene lonesco, and Samuel Beckett were asso- ciated with the review, it was banned in 1949 by the Communist government. Lengyel and other contributors were sent to prison, while Nemes Nagy was si- lenced for awhile. She subsequently wrote children's books and translated foreign poetry, all the while writing poems (though never prolifically). An initial Selected Poems (University of Iowa Press), translated by Bruce Berlind, ap- peared in 1980, followed eight years later by Hugh Maxton's Between: Selected Poems of Agnes Nemes Nagy (Dublin: Dedalus Press / Budapest: Corvina Press). During those last years of her life, her work was rediscovered by younger Hun- garians. As Szirtes explains in his sensi- tive, witty, and penetrating introduction to this new selection, Nemes Nagy "was always too distant, too unbending, too disdainful of popularity to be a popular writer, but was at the same time acknowl- edged to be of the first importance.... She has exerted a lasting influence on poets coming after her: on Zsuzsa Rakaovszky, on Gyozo Ferencz, and on M6nika Mesterhazy. To some degree it is a moral influence as much as a matter or range or technique, something to do with integrity." Despite her suffering at the hands of Stalinist hard-liners, Nemes Nagy was never an engage writer. Yet she some- times alludes to recent Hungarian his- tory, most notably in the Akhenaton se- quence (which gives an overall title to Szirtes's selection). It is a series of long and short poems, portraying the revolu- tionary and spiritual-minded Egyptian pharaoh, who keeps a notebook and de- sires to invent a new kind of god: In carving myself a god, I kept in mind to choose the hardest stone that I could find. Harder than flesh and not given to wincing: its consolation should appear convincing. Yet this renewal of faith in affirming acts and sentiments (in the last poem, "love" as embodied in Nefertiti becomes the new deity) must first come to terms with the bloody 1956 uprising of the Hungarians against their tank-driving Soviet overlords. Employing the mod- ernist technique of juxtaposing disparate historical periods, Nemes Nagy passes these tragic events through Akhenaton' s mind: I only wish that you, my love were as small as the god on the wafer And the tanks were already coming, The street ran along its stone bed before mountainous waves of metal, and soft bodies ran between stone and metal still trailing a few balloons behind them ...</page><page sequence="3">790 The Antioch Review I dwell on this underlying political element because Nemes Nagy master- fully evokes intricate emotions that seem, upon subsequent readings, to comprise even more aspects than one had noticed. Szirtes pinpoints the "crystalline" quality of her verse, "something both highly clear and highly structured in the experience of reading her poems," and he adds that "this does not mean that the clarity is itself the poem: as with a crystal there is an awareness of refracted light, of light held and turned about various facets." Some facets are political and especially historical, for she is sensitive to how the past coincides with the present. Her po- ems are tightly crafted and often succinct, with formal metrical and rhyme schemes at work, yet they express more polysemy, provide more interpretative possibilities, than most concise poems composed by other hands. An allusion to imprisonment is perhaps even hidden in this late poem, a terse quatrain presumably dealing with ennui, weariness, forebodings about death and nothingness, or the unsurpassable border of sheer physical materialism: The empty sky. The empty sky. I can't tell what might satisfy. No more perhaps than a few bars across the window to stop my eye. In other words, Nemes Nagy high- lights a single perception, but not a single emotion; she brings forth nexuses of co- existent feelings, some of them mutually contradictory. Moreover, the repetition of the opening words indicates a move- ment from perception to apperception, from awareness to self-awareness. This, too, is typical. Staring at the sky culmi- nates in self-conscious staring, musing, then wishing. By the way, if her wish about the window bars is fulfilled, will it result in inner peace or a sentiment of entrapment? Probably both. Emotional ambiva- lence is all too human, and it functions as an equivalent of poetic truth for Nemes Nagy. She is lucid about human contra- dictions and paradoxes. A poem squarely narrated in the first person, yet on a "strange afternoon," becomes no less than "evidence" of the narrator's "not-me sense." The me and the not-me? The self and the other; that is, the self as other? Here the concept of no-man's land once again proves useful. For Nemes Nagy (like all of us) is caught between irresolvable antinomies: subjectivity and objectivity, ideas and things, physics and metaphysics, faith and disbelief, heritage and rupture. Her list would include art and science, as well as thinking and feeling. She lingers in such no-man's lands not because she pre- fers states of limbo, but rather because she is acutely aware of the truth they represent; how, in human experience, oppositions at once struggle against each other and interrelate. The latter dichotomy of thinking and feeling is crucial. It is not ideas about existence, but rather unsettling, uncanny, not immediately definable feelings that open up access to our most genuine rela- tionship with aliveness. By focusing on feeling (while naming no specific ones), Nemes Nagy seeks to restore the imme- diacy of this deep relationship, which- she avers-can be sensed at any moment: on the corner of Kekgoly6 Street, for instance, when sunlight falls at a certain angle on the castle. What she calls emotion is thus neither sentimentality, as she explains in her es- say, nor modernist surrogates for tradi- tional poetic emotions. Pointing to the "recurring waves of avant-garde reviv- als, [and] the various fads and schools" of twentieth-century poetry, this Hungarian avant-gardist cautions: "Not that emo- tion does not sneak back into the poem</page><page sequence="4">Poetry Today 791 under various excuses and guises: instead of private emotion collective emotion, instead of manifest emotions suppressed emotion, instead of 'beautiful' emotion 'ugly' and 'true' emotion, instead of a complex of related emotions fragments, allusions, visions; instead of pathos irony, and so forth." In her quest for rarer, life-revealing, "post-illusion pockets of emotion" (as she defines it), she expands her purview to include "crucial things in our lives [that] happen in domains beyond the senses, among atoms and solar eruptions, nucleic acids, and ozone shields." Mod- ern science by no means intimidates her. On the contrary, in her long poem "Be- tween," she combines facts and perspec- tives from ornithology, meteorology, ge- ography, geology, and astronomy, in order to announce "decimations and incisions, / droughts and visions, / inarticulate res- urrections, / the unbearable vertical ten- sions / between up-above and down-be- low." This apocalyptic or primeval natural pageant may at first seem beyond human- ness and thus beyond emotion, though the spectacle itself necessarily engenders an emotion. And in the following, and final, stanza, Nemes Nagy leaves the reader with an even stranger sentiment. Rather like Mozart, who claimed that music lies between the notes, the Hungar- ian poet outlines an almost palpable "be- tweenness." But is this betweenness, in- cluding the cryptic "between sky and sky," the locus of a metaphysics? These "betweennesses" are all no-man's lands, in any event: Various climates and conditions. Between. The stone. The tracks of tanks. A line of black reed on savannah border, written on pond and sky in lines, in double order, two dark stones with cryptographs stars' diacritics, acutes and graves- Between sky and sky. In comparison to the "explosions in deep mountain bores" of "Between" and other poems drawing on geology (a fa- vorite subject), the "cumulations of con- crete anxieties" unearthed by archaeolo- gists in the prose poem "A Terraced Landscape" seem pathetically funny. Among other appurtenances of existence, these "anxieties" are often hats: turbans, a velvet beret, a swineherd's fur toque, a coolie hat, a sailor's cap. "Objects carry 'news,"' proclaims Nemes Nagy, then continues: "If we try to enclose in a poem the being of an object that has somehow touched us as it is, then-perhaps-we may capture a corner of a Ding-an-sich world sufficient unto itself. And where is the poet to find objects for this purpose? In Kekgolyo Street." This ideal Ding-an-sich world is of course that of her mentor Rilke and the philosopher Edmund Husserl, whose re- spective examples encouraged question- ing, among Nemes Nagy's contemporar- ies and immediate precursors, of the poet-observer's overly anthropomorphic vision of the material world. The idea spread that objects should be depicted as they really were. Poets experimented with this paradox of recovering, through words, not "me and the mimosa tree," as the French poet Francis Ponge famously put it, but rather the "mimosa tree without me." In a late poem entitled "In the Gar- den," Nemes Nagy offers a more complex variant by imagining wiping "the as-if from the as-if-now, / the as-if-it- existed." As in the Akhenaton sequence, super- posing the past on the here and now enables this self-styled "objective lyric poet" to discover still another no-man's</page><page sequence="5">792 The Antioch Review land. "In the Garden" adds a temporal dimension to the object-in-itself world. "A person might in fact believe," she writes, "the past would fade away. But no, / it vanishes, then reappears, / ( ...) just like the seasons which sometimes / condense into seed and sometimes ex- tend / down the unmarked highways of space-time...." Some objects, like seeds, grow into objects that produce more seeds; perceiving reproducible liv- ing things must thereby take time into account. Nemes Nagy's allusion to Einstein is hardly gratuitous. Hence, those who have previously visited the garden return to "walk round in circles, during the whole monotonous / journey turning their backs on us, / though sometimes they might turn round to face us." Even an inert coil of cable left behind on a boulder once again seems charged with electricity and to resemble the luminous faces of the revenants, "now blazing, now fading / away on the spiral cables / of time." The prisms of con- sciousness, in the present, are indeed multifaceted. The unresolved dialectics of another poem, "This I have seen. . . ," similarly evoke this feeling of not so much dkjia vu as dajei vecu: This I have seen (This I have never seen) Here I have been (Here I have never been) Perhaps in some other life (Some other dying, possibly) Wearing veils, I came this way ... Such lines show Nemes Nagy at her most enigmatic, though it is important to remember that, long before her, Saint Augustine similarly analyzed the pres- ence of things past (and things future, not to mention "things present") in the present time of consciousness. Sensing the pres- ence of the past causes the Hungarian poet to suspend belief in superficial ap- pearances and objects-in-themselves- an act that itself creates a particular emo- tion. This especial ambivalence about the real world is probably best summarized in a poem more likely set in primordial Central Europe than in California. The poet imagines herself wandering through a stand of gigantic sequoias. At first, they represent a "Platonic idea of pine forest. / Pine forest but ten times greater." Den- drological details then become precise and sensual: ... a fibre-knotted husk whose pocks suggest a breasted creature, a breasted deity, whose touch might be the salvation of your palms could you but reach above her swollen root. At the end, Nemes Nagy turns her imagination-the verbs remain in the conditional tense-to sunlight peeking between trees. She concludes that "its glance would mark a shining path that lit / here and nowhere else and answered no known question." For some readers, such (imagined) perceptions surely open out onto the spiritual, or at least the mysteri- ous. Yet here as elsewhere, Nemes Nagy cogently restricts herself to what can be known, which is very little. She scruti- nizes the shining path of photons; it gives an answer, surely; but the question, she knows, lies in another, still unexplored, no-man's land.
