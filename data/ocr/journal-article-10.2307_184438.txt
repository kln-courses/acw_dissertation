<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Problem of a Unified Physical Theory of Matter BY E. KOLMAN N THE following, limiting ourselves to two objects-the processes X and T-we will compare three kinds of regularities in their specific manifestation in physics: (I) interac- tion; (2) causality; and (3) functional depend- ence. In considering as objective all the regularities which are inherent in things and material processes themselves, and in considering causality and functional depend- ence merely as one-sided abstractions of interaction, which in its turn is an abstraction from the universal interconnection of things, we avoid such an arbitrary definition of causality as, for instance, the possibility of exact prognosis1 which leads to the negation of causality. We also avoid placing functional depend- ence above causality. (I) Interaction of the processes X and 2, which we will sym- bolize as X &lt;- 2, is characterized as follows: a) X and r are connected by logical necessity; b) X and ' are definitely connected, which is usually expressed thus: the action X and the action r are mutually equal. The 1 Cf., for instance, Max Planck "Die Kausalitat im Naturgeschehen," "Scientia" of March I, 1933, where he says: "Ein Eregnis ist dann kausal bedingt wenn es mit Sicherheit vorausgesagt werden kann," and where, proceeding from mechanistic materialism, Planck arrives with logical consistency at the recognition of an omniscient absolute spirit. 400</page><page sequence="2">E. Kolman 401 principle of conservation and transformation of energy is a present day formulation of this. c) the connection r &lt;-&gt; X is equally true; d) the connection includes in itself no statement as to time (neither of succession nor of simultaneity); e) the connection includes activity, effective, active compulsion; f) the connection is transitive, i.e. if X -* 7' and rT &lt; V, then X *-, V is true; g) the connection is but a link in an endless chain: (. ... +z,-,X T+r V ... .). (2) The causal connection of the process X (cause) and the process ' (effect), which we will symbolize as X --, , is char- acterized as follows: a) X and r are connected by logical necessity; b) X and Tare definitely connected, which is usually expressed: the cause is equal to its effect; c) the connection is asymmetrical, i.e. T -&gt; X would not be true; d) the connection includes a succession in time, i.e. X precedes T in time, which we will symbolize as Xo-&gt; Y; e) the connection includes activity, the process X represents the active principle and the process 7 the passive principle; it includes effective active compulsion; f) the connection is transitive, i.e. if X - T and ' -&gt; V, then X --- V; g) the connection is but a link in an endless chain: (.... - Z -- X -r -&gt; v- ....), whence follows the relative character of the concept of cause and effect, for each of the links in this chain represents both a cause and an effect; h) the connection reflects only one-sidedly the real interaction of X -&gt; r, due to abstraction from its co-existent (in interaction) connection X-- '. (3) Functional dependence, which we will consider in the most abstract mathematical form of 2' = F(X) is characterized as follows: a) X and T are connected by logical necessity; b) X and are definitely connected;</page><page sequence="3">402 Unified Theory of Matter c) the connection Y = F(X) allows X = F-~ (2), while, of course, the identity of F = F- is not obligatory;2 d) the connection r = F(X) says nothing as to succession or simultaneity in time; e) the connection r = F(X) has not the force of effective necessity; f) the connection r = F(X) is transitive, i.e. if Y2 = F(X) and X = G(V), then V = H(T); g) the connection r = F(X) expresses only partly the causal connection X -&gt; and even less completely the interaction 2. From a comparison of these types of regularities it is obvious that the time sequence in which all the processes in reality take place, and which possesses the substantial property of one-sided direction (from the past to the present and so on to the future), constitutes the obligatory characteristic of causality, conditioning the asymmetry of causal connection; but we do not identify causality with mere sequence in time. We must recognize that if two processes X and r are objectively connected (materially), i.e. if X &lt;- r, while X precedes 2, i.e. X 0-&gt; 2, it follows that causal connection, i.e. X -&gt; 2, exists between them. 3. From a further comparison of these types of regularities we see that efficacy, or activity, is not only an essential, but also a specific characteristic of causal connection, which distinguishes it from mere sequence in time, since the latter is considered detached from the processes that take place in it. 4. By efficacy we should not understand something extraneous, something applied to matter. One should not conceive it as something emanating from matter, like the Newtonian idea of force necessary to put inert matter into motion. Matter itself is both an active and passive principle. The active principle is connected with the time-form of existence of matter, the passive 2 This identity takes place only for symmetrical functions, for instance, if x + a . bx-I' then y - a by -</page><page sequence="4">E. Kolman 403 with the space-form. Of course the concepts of efficacy as well as of force, at the very beginning, acquired an anthropomorphic character, connecting themselves with muscular sensation as an expression of the movement of our body and of its effects on the outside world. The concept of efficacy of activity should be purged of these anthropomorphic features which include both mechanistic and finalistic factors. 5. Causal connection is not included in functional dependence as an incidental case, for the absence of symmetry and the presence of efficacy and conjunction in time, are the tokens which characterize causal connection as against functional dependence. That is why theoretical physics, in studying ma- terial processes with the aid of functional dependence, is con- strained to introduce special conditions, giving it an interpretation different from mathematics. 6. First of all, time (t) as a variable is added to functional dependence.3 This t constitutes an exceptional independent variable-from the standpoint of physics d is senseless-and is substantially the sole independent variable in physics. All quantities which characterize the condition of the physical sys- tem are considered as manifold finctions of time gk(t). Thereby, not only sequence in time is introduced, but also asymmetry, although of a somewhat different character from the asymmetry of causal connection. The independent variable, t, does not act directly upon the dependent X. Instead of this there is only a possibility of free choice of the specific value of to which deter- mines the specific value of Xo. At the same time, a continuous, uniform change of t is presupposed. 7. However, even in this changed form, functional dependence of theoretical physics differs sharply from causal connection. It does not contain-at least explicitly-the factor of efficacy. Formally it rests on the view-point of description and not of explanation, and only the interpretation of symbols introduces causal conception and banishes phenomenalism. Further, in the functional dependence of theoretical physics the one-sided direc- t Cf. also G. Windred, "The History of Mathematical Time," in "Isis," Nos. 55, 58 (I933).</page><page sequence="5">404 Unified Theory of Matter tion that is characteristic of causal connection is absent. This occurs because the variable t, like all variables in mathematics and geometry, is bi-directional, whereas real physical time is uni-directional. Thus, in the fouir dimensional world of the theory of relativity (x, y, z, t) the coordinate of time differs from the space coordinate not only in being measured with the imaginary unit /-I, but also by the fact that ds must always be greater than zero. 8. Physical idealism, notably Machism, deduces the uni- directionality from the irreversibility of macroprocesses, banishing the concept of "uni-directionality" of time, as well as the concept of time itself for microprocesses in favor of statistics.4 From Heisenberg's "uncertainty principle" they deduce not that we have no right to regard electrons as globules, nor that the physical quantities are indefinable, but that they are indefinite in principle. From Schroedinger's equation they deduce not the temporal limitation of our knowledge, but the "decline of determinism"5 while determinism is identified with dynamic regularities so that statistical regularities may be made equivalent to indeterminism. 9. Thus, theoretical physics, becoming more and more trans- formed into branches of both geometry and "algebra," is losing both matter and determinism, while a very important r81e in that process is played by the concept of time that is detached from matter, that is "dephysicized." Hence it follows that the efforts to unify the bifurcated physics in a purely formal way are 4Extremely characteristic are the arguments of E. Zilsel in an article "Ueber die Symmetrie der Kausalitat und die Einsinnigkeit der Zeit." "Naturwissenschaften," No. 12, 1927, where the proposition of "unidirectial time being included in the second principle of thermodynamics" is coordinated with arguments springing from it against the materialistic conception of history. Cf. also H. Reichenbach, "Axiomatik des rela- tivistischen Raum und Zeitlehre," 1924; R. Carnap, "Die Abhangigkeit der Eigenschaften des Raumes von denen der Zeit," 1925; Zilsel is, however, compelled to admit the exist- ence of a connection between the unidirectionality of time and the difference between mass (which is his terminology for "matter") and field and consequently, the impos- sibility of reducing the unidirectionality of time to the second law; nevertheless he is reluctant to carry out this argument to the end. 5 Cf., for instance, A. Eddington, in "The Decline of Determinism," "Nature" of February 13, 1932, makes the following deduction: "So far as the physical universe is concerned, determinism appears to explain nothing."</page><page sequence="6">E. Kolman 405 bound to end in failure; for it is a case of a revision of concepts, and above all, of the concept of time, as this was quite clearly stated by Schr6dinger.6 Therefore, the unified physical theory of matter, relativist quantum physics, or what is the same, quantum relativist physics, cannot be obtained by simple infer- ence, by the addition on a parallelogram of classical physics (Cl Ph), relativist physics (R Ph), quantum physics (QuPh), and relativist quantum physics (R QuPh), by passing on from extreme cases for h = o or for c = co to a case with finite values of these quantities, but by a qualitatively different method which includes in the very basic concepts the guarantee of a solution C/Ph (h = o, = oo) P h R,uPh ( c)) (h,C- ) R2u Ph(h0,C) of existing contradictions which, by the way, are not solved even in non-relativist quantum mechanics. Io. The way for the creation of a relativist quantum physics should include first of all, a correct interpretation of the quantum of action h,-the elementary action of matter-which represents the product of energy by time. Since it has been demonstrated 6 E. Schrodinger, "Spezielle Relativitatstheorie und Quantenphysik," Sitzungsberichte der Preuss. Akademie der Wiss., no. I2, I931, p. 328, where he says: "Durch diese Sonderstellung der Zeit erweist sich die Quantenmechanik in ihrer gegenwartigen Gestalt und vor allem in ihrer gegenwartigen Interpretation als durch und durch unrelativistisch. Das wird nicht behoben, wenn man blos durch Adaptierung des Formelapparates eine rein ausserliche Gleichstellung das heisst formale Invarianz gegen Lorentztransformation herbeifiihrt."</page><page sequence="7">406 Unified Theory of Matter that this action in respect to space extends to the entire universe, its discontinuous character has to be attributed to the factor of time, allowing for elementary portions of time, for its quantifica- tion. This notion was broached time and again in scientific lit- erature, not so much by speculative physicists as by theoreticians working on the basis of experiment. Thus, J. J. Thompson in his work "The Intermittence of Electric Force,"7 writes: "We shall suppose that the electric field has a structure in time and instead of the electric force being a continuous effect, consist- ing of a continuous flow of momentum into the body under its action, it is really discontinuous and consists of finite increments of momentum separated by finite intervals of time. On this view, when a body at a place P is acted on by a force, we mean that there is at time at some chance of its receiving an increment of momentum, let this chance be at, i will be the average time between the increments." For the element of time Thompson gets a quantity on the order of io-21 seconds. Some suggestions in the same direction were expressed also by other authors, as for instance by H. Latzin in a nebulous and mystified form in his essay "Quantentheorie und Relativitat,'8 saying that the atomic world represents a leap form fluctuation of the reality, and demanding, though very indefinitely, that there be "a qualitative distinction between time and space." i . The question of discontinuity of time in connection with the problems of recent physics was first put by Robert Levi in the article "L'atome dans la theorie de l'action universelle et discontinue," C.r. I83, o026, 1626, wJiich computed for an atom of time the value 4,5 X o-24 sec. The same question was treated by G. J. Pokrowsky (Moscow) in a number of articles contributed to the "Zeitschrift fur Physik," beginning in 1928, namely in Vol. 5I, Nos. 9-Io (1928), "Zur Frage nach einer oberen Grenze fur die Energiedichte," "Zur Frage nach der Struktur der Zeit," and further in Vol. 65, Nos. 1-2 (1930), "Zur Dirac'schen Theorie 7 Proc. of the Royal Soc. of Edinburgh, XLVI, p. 90. 8 "Naturwissenschaften," No. 87, 1927.</page><page sequence="8">E. Kolman 407 von Protonen und Elektronen." The same set of notions is worked out by G. Beck (Zurich) in the same Journal, Vol. 53, Nos. 9-o1 (1929), "Die zeitliche Quantelung der Bewegung." Pokrovsky first starts from the assumption that the density of energy has the same upper limit as the density of the mass in the atomic nucleus and hence deduces a maximum density of energy of the order of 1014, a maximum possible temperature of the order of zo13, and a maximum frequency of radiation of the order of Io23. He goes on to point out the possibility of "experi- mental verification" of the existence of atoms of time of the order of 4.3 X I0-24 sec. by means of comparison with the period of the shortest vibrations of penetrating radiation, and he alludes to observations by Millikan and Cameron in I926 which confirm this supposition. Beck tries to motivate systematically this assumption by pre- suming that at the basis of any motion lies the velocity of light, so that the motions of lesser velocities are lapses into states of rest lasting from one to several elements of time. From the relation of hvo = Mc2 he obtains for the atom of time, which he designates as a "chron": I 6.55 X Io-27 -2 IX =_- = 6.5 X 127 = 4-37 X IO-24 sec. vo 1.66 X io-24 X 9 X IO20 Hence Beck arrives at the existence of an atom of the extension of "odon" that is equal to 1.31 X 0o-~1 cm., and he verifies the obtained results by substituting them in the formulae of dimen- sions of the basic electromagnetic quantities, and comes to the conclusion that, whereas to the mass of an electron there corre- sponds a frequency of one vibration per 7.0 X Io7 chrons, to a heavy mass there corresponds a frequency of one vibration to each chron. This he takes to be the explanation for the inac- cessibility of gravitational waves to observation, and he finally comes to the conclusion that the density of energy in space is a constant, that no transposition of energy takes place. Referring to Beck's quantification of time, Pokrovsky in his</page><page sequence="9">408 Unified Theory of Matter work of I930, on the basis of the theory of Dirac, from the equa- tion moC2 e /= D2 4! I-- deduces the existence of an upper limit of the energy of the quantum, and defines the maximum possible frequency of radia- tion (mo + mo)c2 h in which mo and Mo are rest masses of electron and proton, whence for one chron the value is 4.3 X Io-2 sec. The least possible time between two leaps of an electron is 0 c where X0, the diameter of the electron, coincides with this quan- c tity; u is the probability of the leap, where v is the velocity of the proton. Further application is given to the theory by E. Regener in "Messungen uber das kurzwellige Ende der durchdringenden Hohenstrahlung," "Naturwissenschaften," II (1929), and in the domain of regularities of astrophysics by W. Anderson in "Zur Theorie von G. J. Pokrowski iiber die obere Grenze fur die Masse eines Sternes," Ztschr. f. Phys., 53, 547 (I929), and "Die Theorie von G. J. Pokrowski und die Kontraktationsenergie der Sterne," Ztschr. f. Phys., 55, 386 (1929), and also in thermodynamics by S. Suzuki in "Die obere Grenze der Energiedichte und einige Thermodynamische Schlussfolgerungen," Phys. Ztschr., r3, 618 (I930). In an analogous way F. O. Wollaston in "The Nature of Time," Nature, 3r, I (I931), obtained 8.12 X r1-21 sec. as the value of a time quantum from the expression h/mc2 by substituting for m the mass of the electron (instead of the proton).</page><page sequence="10">E. Kolman 409 Of decisive value for this theory will be the results of future measurements of the wave length of the hardest components of cosmic radiation. I2. As seen from the brief analysis given here, these works either, as in the case of Pokrovsky, fail to develop beyond the starting point or, as in the case of Beck, drop again into the "equalization" of time and space on the ground of their common discontinuity. In scientific literature there are efforts at quantifi- cation of space which give some positive partial results, yet they are incapable of giving a generalized unified theory. Thus, V. Ambarzumian and D. Ivanenko in the article "Zur Frage nach Vermeidung der unendlichen Selbstruckwirkung des Elektrons"9 attempt to overcome the contradiction encountered in quantum electrodynamics of the formal appearance of the infinite reaction of the electron upon itself, by introducing, instead of differential equations, equations in finite differences, considering three-dimen- sional space as an integral cubic point-cell, and arriving at the admission of minimum wave-length. he2 m?C2 of maximum frequency M+ mC2 I h t' and of elementary time interval At = -Ax. c Another contradiction of quantum electrodynamics, the formal appearance of infinitely great energy in the origin of coordinates of empty space, is not eliminated.

In this connection it is necessary to note the work of A. Markov "lber die Ableitbarkeit der Weltmetrik aus der 'Friiher als'-Beziehung,"12 in which the author shows that by admitting in atomic structure the rela- tion of "time precedence" XO-&gt;T, it is possible in a formal axio- matic way to deduce from it the metrics of space-time, while these metrics for "great" intervals will coincide with the "ordi- nary" one. I3. In distinction from these assumptions, we propose to proceed from the discontinuity of time and the continuity of space; the four-dimensional space-time interval will then be continuous on three axes and will have a cellular structure on one axis. Hence it follows that Lorentz's invariant of transformation: dx12 + dy2 + dZ12 - c2dt2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 - c2dt2 will have to assume such a form that instead of differentials of time it would include finite increments of time, integral multiples of I chron. This we will achieve, bearing in mind that the principle of invari- ance of the velocity of light in a vacuum is deduced from the extreme abstraction-the point, non-material source of light. From this will result a different form of the equations of the elec- tron theory. Thus for instance, in aFik s (i, k= I,2, 3, 4), OXk aFkl aFui aFik . + . o (i, k, I = I, 2, 3, 4) instead of ax a Y a~z aOX aoO aOZ at ) at ' t ' ~ t ' at ' t will enter finite increments, and so forth. The "odons" obtained by Beck will then have only formal, but not physical meaning. 12 Phys. Z. d. Sowjetunion, I, 3, I932, S.397.</page><page sequence="12">E. Kolman 4"I Since we shall have to deal with equations containing both differ- entials (or their integrals upon the continuous space interval) and finite differences, the apparatus of tensor analysis will have to be adjusted accordingly. 14. It is necessary to emphasize with all clearness that the discontinuity of time is by no means conceived by us in the sense of absolute discontinuity, the "atoms" of time, or chrons, are not presumed to be final indivisibles.13 The essence of the introduc- tion of discontinuous time consists in that just time, and not space, realizes in the space-time state of matter its structural character. At the present stage of our knowledge, since we investigate processes, which do not descend, for instance into the depth of the electron, the inevitable further divisibility of the chron-again assuming, however, an integral figure-is not revealed. It is further necessary to note that of the very "mech- anism" of the leap from chron to chron we are as yet unable to say anything. We should warn, however, that the very idea of the discontinuous structure of time may appear to be absurd because it is unusual, although on the other hand some eminent psychophysiologistst4 on the grounds of an analysis of individual perceptions of time, did insist on the discontinuity of time, which in itself nevertheless gives as little support to this supposition as the "common sense" arguments fail to prove anything against it. 15. The way suggested here for the creation of a unified physi- cal theory of matter, after mathematical elaboration of this theory, will be justified, only if it be possible: (a) formally to combine relativist electrodynamics and the theory of gravitation with wave mechanics, as is the case in the projective general field-theory of Schouten and Van Dantzig15 which satisfies the 13 Discontinuity of time, as indeed any other theory, may be splendidly made use of by idealists and theologians. Cf. for instance the views of Mutakillimun, the Arabian mediaeval philosopher of orthodox-Islam tendency, who supposed that time is discontin- uous and that God at each new instant, by a special act, creates the world anew. 14 Cf. for instance the work (Russian) of I.
