<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 7  The Constitutio n I s Powerles s  Myths of Equality under  Law  The "natural  order"survives because  of, rather than in  spite of,  American law.  The  law sanctifies  the  order  in  theory  and secures  it as  a  social fact. Neither  the  first nor the  second Reconstructions has  substantial- ly altered this  course:  indeed, the arguments against  both  Reconstructions  have seemed,  in the  end, to  carry the  day. Thus  law continues  to  protect  the advantages  of  some  Americans while  obscuring  the  disadvantages  of  others, all through  a  carefully  crafted  set  of legal  fictions that  subvert  the  constitutional promise  of  "equality."  That  promise  thus  becomes,  perversely, a  guarantee of  privilege for some;  and it  becomes,  tragically, a  lifeless abstraction for others.  The  bell  curves of  American social  life are  preserved by  law.  We  cannot  be  made equal;  we are  not  yOen  permitted  to try.

Perhap s i t was fair to suppos e tha t  the stat e wa s responsibl e fo r th e continuin g segregation .  No, sai d the chie f justice : "Th e lower courts ' 'findings ' a s to 'whit e  flight' ar e bot h inconsisten t internally , an d inconsisten t wit h th e  typical supposition , bolstere d her e by th e record evidence , that 'whit e  flight' ma y resul t fro m desegregation , no t de  jure segregation. "  Again, Justice O'Conno r agreed . "Wha t th e Distric t Cour t di d i n  this cas e .  .  .  and ho w i t transgresse d th e constitutiona l bound s o f it s  remedial powers, is to make desegregative attractiveness the underlyin g  goal o f it s remed y fo r th e specifi c purpos e o f reversin g th e tren d o f  white flight .

"  What had "directly caused" the demographic separation of black an d  white citizens ? O'Conno r wa s no t certain , bu t sh e leaned i n favo r o f  the "typica l supposition. "  "Whether the white exodus that ha s resulted in a school distric t tha t  is 68% black wa s caused b y th e Distric t Court' s remedia l order s o r b y  natural, i f unfortunate , demographi c forces , w e hav e i t directl y fro m  the Distric t Cour t tha t th e segregativ e effect s o f KCMSD' s constitu - tional violatio n di d no t transcen d it s geographica l boundaries.

"  The reporte r no w though t h e recognize d th e genr e o f th e tale : i t  was tragedy .  The apparent deficit s in minority achievemen t were also insufficien t  to justif y th e tria l court' s plan . "Jus t a s demographi c change s  </page> <page sequence="6"> 312 |  The  Constitution Is  Powerless: Myths of Equality  independent o f dejure  segregatio n wil l affect th e racia l composition o f  student assignments, " th e chie f justic e continued , "s o too wil l numer - ous externa l factor s beyon d th e contro l o f th e KCMSD an d th e Stat e  affect minorit y studen t achievement . . . .

"  "External factors"—the reporte r briefl y wondere d wha t those migh t  be. H e waited fo r th e chie f justice to elaborate , bu t ther e was to b e no  clarification. Jus t "externa l factors" ; th e detail s wer e lef t t o th e  imagination.  The chie f justic e continued , "Th e basi c task o f the Distric t Cour t i s  to decid e whether th e reductio n i n achievemen t b y minorit y student s  attributable t o prior dejure  segregatio n has been remedied to the exten t  practicable."  The Kansa s Cit y judg e ha d no t don e hi s job . "Althoug h th e  District Cour t ha s determined tha t '[segregatio n ha s caused a  system  wide reduction i n achievement i n the schools o f the KCMSD,' i t neve r  has identifie d th e incrementa l effec t tha t segregatio n ha s ha d o n  minority studen t achievemen t o r th e specifi c goal s o f th e qualit y  education programs. "  But th e reporte r kne w tha t identifyin g th e "incrementa l effect " o f  centuries o f educationa l inequit y woul d b e no eas y task. Presumably ,  the chie f justic e kne w i t too .  "Insistence upo n academi c goal s unrelate d t o th e effect s o f lega l  segregation unwarrantabl y postpone s th e da y when th e KCMSD wil l  be abl e to operat e o n it s own." Afte r all , the chie f justice noted , "ou r  cases recogniz e tha t loca l autonom y o f schoo l district s i s a  vita l  national tradition. "  But then , racia l segregatio n wa s a  part o f tha t tradition , an d s o to o  was resistanc e t o th e desegregatio n effort . So , fo r tha t matter , wer e  pervasive educationa l inequities—racia l disparitie s i n funding , i n  physical resources , i n th e curriculu m itself—inequitie s tha t persis t t o  this day, crystallized i n the often absur d differences betwee n urban an d  suburban schools . Woul d th e en d o f th e segregatio n effor t signa l a  return t o thes e traditions ?  The chie f justic e took a  surprising tack . Thos e awfu l traditions , h e  suggested, were already no more; the unfortunate student s who labored  under them had long since graduated. "Minorit y students in kindergar - ten throug h grad e 7  in the KCMSD alway s have attende d AAA-rate d  </page> <page sequence="7"> The Constitution Is  Powerless: Myths of Equality |  31 3  schools; minorit y student s i n th e KCMS D tha t previousl y attende d  schools rate d belo w AA A hav e sinc e receive d remedia l educatio n  programs fo r a  period o f u p t o seve n years.

"  It wa s time fo r eac h individua l t o sin k o r swim .  Associate Justic e Clarenc e Thoma s echoe d th e chie f justice' s  sentiments: "T o ensur e tha t distric t court s d o no t embar k o n suc h  broad initiative s in the future, w e should deman d that remedia l decree s  be mor e precisel y designe d t o benefi t onl y thos e wh o hav e bee n  victims of segregation.

"The mer e fac t tha t a  schoo l i s black doe s no t mea n tha t i t i s th e  product o f a  constitutiona l violation. "  What, then , di d i t mean ?

I t was , th e reporte r knew , a n extraordinar y  moment: Thoma s wa s turnin g a  hal f centur y o f constitutiona l  jurisprudence o n it s head . Full y fiv e decade s ago , i n Brown  v.

Now, remarkably , Thoma s wa s suggestin g tha t i t wa s no t segrega - tion bu t th e effor t t o desegregat e tha t perpetuate d th e malevolen t  myths o f black inferiorit y an d white superiority . "Tw o threads in ou r  jurisprudence hav e produce d thi s unfortunat e situation , i n whic h a  District Cour t ha s take n i t upo n itsel f t o experimen t wit h th e  education o f th e KCMSD's blac k youth." Th e reporte r wince d a t th e  harshness o f th e metaphor .  "First, the cour t ha s read our case s to suppor t th e theory tha t blac k  students suffer a n unspecified psychologica l har m from segregatio n tha t  retards their menta l an d educationa l development . Thi s approach no t  only relie s upo n questionabl e socia l scienc e researc h rathe r tha n  constitutional principle , bu t i t als o rest s o n a n assumptio n o f blac k  inferiority."  "Such assumptions, " Thoma s concluded , "an d an y socia l scienc e  research upo n whic h the y rel y certainl y canno t for m th e basi s upo n  which w e decid e matter s o f constitutiona l principle. "  Thomas accuse d th e Kansa s Cit y judg e o f "misreading " Brown  an d  the earl y desegregatio n decisions . Som e member s o f th e assemble d  audience wer e shakin g thei r heads . Wa s i t disagreement ? Dismay ?  Something worse ? Thos e familia r wit h th e desegregatio n case s kne w  that th e socia l scienc e evidenc e offere d t o th e Cour t i n  Brown—evidence o n whic h th e Cour t ha d expressl y relied—describe d  a viciou s cycl e o f racis m i n whic h racia l prejudic e generate d racia l  segregation, whic h i n tur n generate d racia l difference s i n self-concep t  and achievement , which i n turn seeme d to legitimat e an d heighten th e  prejudice.

"Th e lowe r court s shoul d no t b e  swayed b y th e eas y answer s o f socia l science , no r shoul d the y accep t  the findings , an d the assumptions , o f sociolog y an d psychology a t th e  price o f constitutiona l principle.

The reporter wa s not sur e just wha t Thomas was saying. Tha t ther e  had bee n n o officia l segregation ? Tha t i t ha d cause d n o harm ? Tha t  it n o longe r cause d harm ? I f h e wa s sayin g th e first , the n h e wa s  clearly mistaken . I f he was saying either o f th e last two, then how di d  he purpor t t o know ?  Ironically, fo r al l o f hi s dismissal s o f socia l science , th e justic e  seemed quit e willin g t o dra w som e socia l scienc e conclusion s o f hi s  own. "Give n tha t desegregatio n ha s not produce d th e predicte d leap s  forward i n blac k educationa l achievement, " h e asserted , "ther e i s n o  reason t o thin k tha t blac k student s canno t lear n a s wel l whe n  surrounded b y member s o f thei r ow n rac e a s whe n the y ar e i n a n  integrated environment.

Compared t o the roaring indictment of desegregation's unprinciple d  failures, Brown's  successes—i n reducin g th e ga p betwee n blac k an d  white achievement , i n reducin g negativ e racia l attitude s b y virtuall y  every conventiona l measure—becam e mumble d asides .  "Although th e ga p betwee n blac k an d whit e tes t score s ha s  narrowed over the past two decades,"—Thomas's grudging acknowledg- ment wa s barely audible—"i t appear s tha t thi s has resulted mor e fro m  gains in the socioeconomi c statu s o f blac k familie s tha n from desegre - gation."  Those gains , presumably , wer e unrelate d t o th e dismantlin g o f  segregation.  "It i s clea r tha t th e Distric t Cour t misunderstoo d th e meanin g o f  Brown I."  Thoma s wa s i n ful l voic e again .  </page> <page sequence="10"> 316 |  The  Constitution Is  Powerless: Myths of Equality  "Segregation wa s not unconstitutiona l becaus e i t might hav e caused  psychological feeling s o f inferiority .

Thomas seemed to b e saying tha t raciall y separate school s woul d hav e  been constitutional , provide d neithe r th e "black " no r "white " school s  were provided "superior " resources .

Wa s i t unequa l regardles s o f th e purpose ? Regardles s o f th e  effect? Regardles s o f th e context ? Thoma s di d no t explain .  "Of course , segregatio n additionall y harme d blac k student s b y  relegating them t o school s wit h substandar d facilitie s an d resources.

"  Reconstruction's opponent s wer e u p t o th e task ; the y had , afte r all ,  some rathe r obviou s precedent . I n 186 8 Democrat Jame s A . Johnson  of Californi a note d tha t th e Declaratio n o f Independenc e proclaime d  that "al l me n ar e create d equal. " But , o f course , ther e wa s mor e  here—or less—tha n meet s th e eye :  This i s the iteratio n o f abstrac t politica l principles , applicabl e alone ,  governmentally, t o thos e wh o mad e i t an d thos e wh o inheri t thei r  institutions. Tha t al l me n ar e created equa l i n a  general sens e i s no t  true, a s every one knows. Bu t i t i s equally a s well known tha t al l are  equal before th e law.

I t was not intended to destroy distinctions in society. N o change  was made o r contemplated i n the fixed statu s of the inhabitant s o f the  several States.

Th e effort , Wille y insisted , was both unnecessar y an d  unfair:  The proposition befor e th e committee was to conside r whethe r i t was  necessary t o mak e specia l provision s fo r colore d person s i n orde r t o  secure them equa l privilege s wit h othe r member s o f th e community .  The law is as open to a colored person as it is to a white person. S o far  as that matte r i s concerned, al l members o f th e community stand , a s I  conceive it , upon a  perfect equality . I  do no t suppos e that i t wa s the  object o f the honorable Senato r from Massachusett s to make a  distinc- tion i n favo r o f colore d person s ove r whit e persons ; bu t an y specia l  enactment i n regard to their privileges on this road certainly would be  a distinction agains t white passengers, while it would not enlarge under  the law, in any respect whatever, the privileges and remedies of colored  persons. What , then, i s the necessity for an y action on this subjec t o n  the par t o f the Senat e or on the par t o f Congress ?  Delaware's Saulsbur y agreed , an d h e wa s certai n tha t i t wa s no t  "equality" tha t wa s a t issue : "Whe n thes e negroe s g o abou t stickin g  their head s int o railroa d cars , and amon g whit e peopl e . . .

Occasionally , i n cases like Washing- ton v.  DaviSy  the concept s g o han d i n hand ; i n othe r cases , they ar e  simply differen t aspect s o f th e natura l order .

Certainl y the assertion is not a logical  one; tha t a  characteristi c ma y b e relevan t unde r som e o r eve n man y  circumstances does not suggest any reason to presume it relevant under  other circumstances where there i s reason to suspec t i t i s not.
