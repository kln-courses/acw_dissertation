<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF BIBLE AND RELIGION Vol. XVII January, 1949 No. i Plato and Christianity: A Philosophical Comparison JOHN WILD* F, THEREFORE, Plato has said that by loving, knowing, and imitating this God, without Whom no nature exists, no doctrine instructs, and no act benefits, we are wise, and that by participating in Him we are blessed, why then should we investigate the others? No others have approached more closely to us than these (Plato and his fol- lowers)." ' In these words of the City of God, St. Augustine expresses his recognition of the remarkable harmony between Christian and Platonic philosophy. He then proceeds to give a brief but careful account of the points of agreement and difference, for the instruc- tion of contemporary Christian readers. This account is sound and still illuminating. But modern scholarship has revealed many facts about Plato and his dialogues which were not known to Augustine. New problems have also arisen in the modern world and their solution requires all the religious and philosophical light at our disposal. The purpose of this article is to examine the relation between Platonism and Christianity as it appears at the present time with special reference to contemporary moral and social issues. In attempting briefly to summarize Christian doctrine for the sake of this compari- son, we shall follow Augustine in emphasizing its implicit philosophical presuppositions rather than its revealed dogmas. What is the Christian view of God, the world (including man), and the goal of human action? These are the questions we shall first try to answer. Then we shall consider Platonism under the same four headings, comparing and contrast- ing the two. I think that such a study, even when undertaken in such a summary manner as this, may be as illuminating in our time as it was in that of St. Augustine. I. A Brief Summary of Christian Natural Theology and Anthropology 1. Christian Natural Theology. According to a central strand of Christian thought, including St. Augustine, St. Thomas and many others, the existence of God can be rationally demonstrated by empirical argu- ments. He is perfect being, containing, there- fore, the sufficient reason for His existence within Himself and requiring no external cause for His generation and support. He is un- limited in perfection and power, good, im- mutable, eternal, unique, and transcendent. He is also intelligent, and possesses freedom of action to an unlimited degree. Indeed His creation of the world was a free act of choice, arising from no external compulsion which would be inconsistent with His autonomy, nor from any internal necessity either natural or moral, each of which wou'd be inconsistent with His perfection and completeness. In the mediaeval controversy which is summarized in question 19, Part I, of Aquinas' Summa Theologica it became clear that the freedom of God presupposes His absolute * JOHN WILD is Professor of Philosophy in Harvard University.

Those who limit the perfection of the divine activity also limit His freedom fol- lowing Leibnitz who in his doctrine of the best of all possible worlds maintained that God's act of creation was dictated by His understand- ing of what was best. This implies some lack or imperfection in God, and places Him under a moral necessity which limits His freedom of choice. Christianity is committed to the doctrine that God is absolutely free, and that His creative act is utterly unconstrained by any necessity whatsoever either external or internal. This does not imply, however, as Professor Lovejoy2 would have us believe, that this creative act is in any sense irrational or caprici- ous. In ourselves we know that an irrational act is never fully free,-much less so in God. His free act, though not dictated by any reason, is nevertheless in accordance with reason, and wholly reasonable. Being intel- ligent and free, God is certainly personal, for by a person we mean an individual substance with reason. God is a substance or independ- ent being, and certainly rational. Therefore He is personal, indeed according to the doctrine of the Trinity, a society of persons. 2. The Christian Philosophy of Nature. First of all the world is a free creation of God ex nihilo, not merely the forming and moulding of a pre-existent matter. Being the work of a first cause that is intelligent and good, it is also good. In the words of Genesis: "God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good" (Gen. 1, 31). This does not mean that non-intelligent forms in every case attain all the further perfections they require to activate their nature. Individual entities are constantly being deprived and distorted by chance and accident. But in general, for the most part (all natural law being based on a constant tendency never without chance exceptions) these things achieve what they require, so that the species is maintained, and the order of nature pre- served. This is their general function, to fit into this order and to sustain it. Man is not subordinate to this order. He has a higher function. He is the highest material being, since he is intelligent and free. He also is good. He does not always freely choose the good, nor does he always attain his natural end. This of course is true. But he is good by nature. That is, everything has been given him which he requires for the proper perfection of his existence, sufficient material resources, a living body, sensory faculties, and most of all, reason by which he can as- similate the entire universe as a microcosm on the tablets of his mind, and plan alternative courses of action,-and will by which he can choose among these to act in a truly human and natural manner. All these necessary facilities have been granted him. To realize his nature he needs only to use them himself in a free and spontaneous manner. If he does not do so, he has only himself to blame. 3. The Goal of Human Action. The moral ideal of Christianity is expressed in the saying: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your your soul, and with all your mind" and "You shall love your neighbor as yourself" (Matt. 22, 37-39, Revised Standard Version the New Testament, Nelson, 1946), which is presented as a summary of the law and the prophets. It is therefore given as a command, but not as an extraneous fiat expressing that with which we are entirely unfamiliar. "Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made." (Rom. I, 20) Christian moral teaching is the sharpened and clarified expression of a moral imperative at least dimly and vaguely known to all men. The fact that this teaching is given in the form of a command has important implications for the theory of human nature. It certainly implies that man possesses rational under- standing. We do not command sticks and stones, for they act automatically in accord- ance with their nature and have no understand- ing of anything they do. Hence the presenta- tion of the law as a commandment also implies the freedom of man. There is no sense in</page><page sequence="3">PLATO AND CHRISTIANITY 5 commanding that which is impossible, or that which must be done inevitably. We do not command a cripple to walk normally, or a child to breathe. Such acts are not free. A command is issued only to a free being who is not constrained by necessity to one mode of action alone. Little sense can be made of the New Testa- ment unless it is taken for granted that human beings possess a rational faculty which, if exercised at all, can give them some knowledge of their nature, and of that general pattern of action (the moral law) which is required for its completion. What is the content of this moral law as understood by Christianity? Human nature cannot be activated without the cooperation of many individuals working together in a social structure for the common good. This social nature of man is emphasized in Christianity by its doctrine of the Kingdom of God. Its teaching in fact is oriented to this social concept, and its earthly purpose may be exhaustively summarized as the establish- ment and propagation of a social order. What is the nature of this kingdom? Any basic human group must provide three major goods to its members: 1, the material artifacts necessary to sustain physical life; 2, political decisions and policies governing com- mon action; and finally 3, noetic concepts and insights fitting into some coherent apprehen- sion of themselves and the world in which they live, and providing them with an over- arching purpose for the living of a common life. The New Testament contains sharp and clear- cut teachings with respect to these poietic, politic, and noetic endeavors of man. They may be summarized as follows. The essential need for food and other ma- terial artifacts is clearly recognized, but of the three essential needs of man, it is the least important. If men's minds can be clearly illumined by a sound overarching purpose, and if this can elicit their whole-hearted devo- tion to a worthy common end, these things will easily be achieved. The material re- sources of nature are sufficient for the satis- faction of all necessary human needs. "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well." (Matt. 6, 33) Any confusion of mere material welfare with the ultimate end of human life is sharply condemned. This I take it is the meaning of the first temptation. Man of course must have bread. But he cannot live on bread alone. To set up the accumulation of material possessions as the chief aim of a human life is to commit a fearful error and to confuse man with an animal. We cannot serve God and Mammon. The rich farmer hoarding up his grain for the sake of reaping profit is bitterly condemned. "Fool! This night your soul is required of you; and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?" (Luke 12, 20). Of what value are all the material possessions in the world compared to the health of the immaterial soul? The Gospels show little interest in property rights and the so-called crimes and punish- ments devised for their protection by the Roman Law, so little in fact that the parable of the Unjust Steward (Like 16) has caused no little trepidation in modern commentators. But the New Testament agrees with Natural Law that the values of friendship and co- operation are certainly to be placed above those of legal property rights. Nevertheless, though the need for material things is a definitely subordinate one, it is a necessary one, for man possesses a material body which must be sustained if life is to be lived at all. How then are these material ne- cessities to be provided and distributed? Judging by the acts of the Lord himself in feed- int the multitudes two principles are clear. First no one has any more right than anyone else in having these necessary needs satisfied. God wishes everyone to be fed. He has taken care that there is enough for all. Our own success in providing for the future will depend upon the zeal and energy we show in making use of the plethora of material goods with which we have been surrounded. The second great need of man for plans and choices of common modes of action is also</page><page sequence="4">6 JOHN WILD clearly recognized in the Gospels as an essential but subordinate need. If political power is sought as the highest end this can lead only to disappointment and corruption. This, I take it, is the meaning of the third temptation and its rejection (Matt. 4, 8 ff.). Political rule and power are by nature meant to serve the ends understood and freely chosen by the higher faculties of intellect and will which belong to the immaterial soul of man. Aside from these, political power is of no value. Hence little respect for ruling princes and pow- ers is shown in the Gospels. "The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors." (Luke 22, 25) The exercise of political power is thus looked upon as a duty or service to be performed not for the supposed interests of the rulers but for the common good. The implica- tion of the significant word "called" is clearly that most of the recognized rulers of existent states, who rule for their own or for narrow party interests, are not true "benefactors" or rulers at all. The benefit attained by political order is justice. This is certainly the legitimate aim of all political enactments and arrangements. The word 5&amp;Kato.bi6, often translated righteous- ness, is found ubiquitously in the New Testa- ment. Our word justice probably conveys its meaning more adequately. From the early Greek period when the word was forged it has suggested the exact, equal measure of the balance scale. Justice is always some sort of equality, though not necessarily an abstract arithmetical equality. It is not just to treat unequals equally. But with respect to the basic natural needs of men there is an approxi- mate natural equality. We have already noted that material needs should be equally satisfied. There is no reason to doubt that this principle applies also to the higher noetic needs as well. In spite of the effort of Mark to emphasize the secret and ex- clusive character of the parables, this is not borne out by the other Gospels, nor even by much of the record as presented by Mark. The teaching of Jesus is presented to all the disciples alike with no discrimination, and he seems willing to instruct great crowds of those coming to hear him without distinction. His teaching is given to anyone willing to hear,- even to foreigners, criminals and outcasts. The values of life are to be granted to everyone, according to need, with no holding back or in- vidious exclusions. But how about the providing of these bene- fits? Where do they come from? Primarily from God, who is the creator of the natural world and of man its highest product, so much more valuable than grass, lilies, the birds of heaven and all other natural creatures (Matt. 6, 26). As to the secondary goods that can be provided by the free activity of man, these should be provided for the benefit of all by each man according to his abilities. This seems to be the best summary of New Testament teach- ing on justice. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for such a kingdom of justice, and blessed are they when they are persecuted for the sake of such justice. To establish and to maintain a really just social order is the aim of politics. It cannot be brought into existence in the face of prevailing evils, however, without heroic acts of devotion involving much more than justice,-the burn- ing fire of sacrificial love. Guided by such love the Christian life is a constant attempt to imitate God and his creative generosity, which we may hope to attain in our present disordered state only by the granting of special aid from God himself. To be truly human is to be like God, so far as human limitations permit. So far as we act as God acts, we may be as God is, and thus achieve a mode of human perfection which is as that unlimited perfection of our Heavenly Father. This is the constant burden of New Testament teaching. God is himself a society of persons each sharing perfectly and identically in the supreme values of divinity, and coAperating in different ways for the attainment of a single end willed by all. This is the model for human society. We are commanded to be perfect as our Heavenly Father is perfect (Matt. 5, 48)-to</page><page sequence="5">PLATO AND CHRISTIANITY 7 realize and activate the nature he has given us, as He is perfectly active and complete. We are to love our fellow men as he loves us. We are to forgive them as he has forgiven us. We are to treat them all without distinction as our brothers, as He has made them all without distinction His children. We should feed them all and nurture them all when they are young with the same care, as He has made the earth and the sea and the things thereof not just for a few men but for all alike. When our brother turns against us and does evil to us as an enemy we should not follow our belligerent instincts and return evil for evil, but rather follow the example of God Who sends His light upon the unjust as well as upon the just. As for the terrible injustices inflicted by evil men upon those who suffer, this is a far lighter evil than the actual performance of unjust acts. To do injustice is far worse than to suffer it. "Be not afraid of them that kill the body but are not able to kill the soul. .. ." (Matt. 10, 28) When we are tempted to use force as a means of achieving a good human end, we should think of God Who could easily dominate men by force and indeed wipe out all His enemies in the twinkling of an eye, but Who does not do so because of His respect for human freedom, and His preference for one good act freely chosen from wisdom, love and devotion, over a million "good" acts motivated from fear of force. Physical force is not intrinsically evil. It has its place in the world of sub-human nature. But in the affairs of men it is always unnatural and always an evil. Men can understand. To use force on them is therefore out of place, and always leads to bitterness, and confusion. Hence those who take to the sword, as the rec- ord of history shows, ultimately perish by the sword. Such is the Christian conception of a just social order of human cooperation where man is no longer a wolf to his fellow man. It has actually worked as a living social force in West- ern history, and is still working at the present time, though often not knowing itself as such, and often no doubt under strange disguises. In this connection I think we must remember the story of the two sons in the Gospel of Mat- thew, each being given a command by his father to work in the Vineyard. The first son answered and said, "I will not; but afterward he repented and went. And he went to the second and said the same; and he answered, 'I go, sir,' but did not go. Which of the two did the will of his father? They said, 'The first'." (Matt. 21, 29-31) Actions speak louder than words. 4. The Christian Ideology and Its Enemies. Sacrificial action cannot be long sustained in any effective cooperative pattern unless it is illumined and guided by a sound view of the world and man's position in it. This brings us to the third kind of need, the noetic needs of man. Human beings will not continue to struggle against militant opposition for a dis- tant goal unless their reason tells them that this goal is really in accordance with the nature of things, and not a subjective interest supported only by opinion and prejudice. The building of a new social order requires a metaphysics and a theology. The very heart of human action is the thought or ideology directing it. "The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light; but if your eye is not sound, your whole body will be full of darkness" (Matt. 6, 22-23) This is true not only of individual action but of social action as well. When the common purpose or group ideology breaks down, and can no longer be rationally defended, the group begins to disintegrate. Singleness of purpose and endeavor means the sharing of one and the same idea by many minds. "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand." (Matt. 12, 25-26) The Christian ideology, as we have inter- preted it, contains the following three essential elements. First, the doctrine of a basic intelligent cause and free creator of the universe, and of man as a free and rational entity, therefore as Augus- tine explains, made in the image of God; Second, the doctrine that God is directly con- cerned with each human individual and with</page><page sequence="6">8 JOHN WILD the concrete events of human history, so con- cerned in fact as to have incarnated Himself in the actual flesh of a human individual, to in- augurate a just social order. This profound concern for concrete history is an essential element in Christianity which is clearly ex- pressed not only in the Old Testament and New Testament but in the many Christian philoso- phies of history from Augustine's De Civitate Dei to Toynbee's recent study. Third, the recognition of the rationality and freedom of man with the consequent rejection of any deterministic conception of history such as that of Hegel, Marx, or Spengler. The New Testament breathes the spirit of freedom. Nowhere is there any reference, so far as I know, to any ruthless elimination of human free choice for the sake of some predetermined whole into which human life is to be rigidly fitted. It is hard to reconcile the New Testa- ment with those absolutistic conceptions of autocratic theological determinism which have sometimes been presented under Christian auspices. On the basis of this analysis, we may identify three inimical ideologies with which it seems to me Christianity cannot be reconciled. In the first place Christianity is irrevocably opposed to any materialistic, or as it is now called na- turalistic ideology which attempts to defend the doctrine of a self-evolving universe with no intelligent first cause, and sees in man and his constructions the highest cosmic being, subject to no higher law. Christianity must see in this dubious doctrine not only a lethargic failure of rational analysis but an assertion of that human pride or self-exaltation which has played a leading role in the disintegration of human life and civilization. In the second place, Christianity is com- mitted to the view that the choices and deci- sions made by individual men and cultures in the nexus of human history are of ultimate im- portance in determining the final destiny of the human soul, and that they are also an ultimate concern of God Himself. Hence it must be basically opposed to any extricationist doctrine which would maintain that the world of matter is bad, that concrete history is hopeless, and that the aim of religion is merely to save a few pure souls from this vale of desolation, and to usher them into another world. Such doc- trines have been and still are widely confused with Christianity. But they cannot be recon- ciled with the Incarnation, the central doctrine of the Christian Faith. If matter were evil and history hopeless God would have been a fool to have got Himself incarnate. In the third place, Christianity must be op- posed to any absolutistic or autocratic view of God as a cosmic despot bringing all things into being, even the plague, and black death, mur- der, torture and the concentration camp by His decree, and leaving no room for the spon- taneous and free choices of man. This view is also widely confused with Christianity, but it is absolutely inconsistent with the marked respect for human freedom and the condemna- tion of all oppressive violence which are clearly expressed in the New Testament. We must now terminate this brief and inade- quate attempt to characterize Christian philos- ophy. Let us now turn to the Platonic philosophy, by which I mean the philosophy of Plato himself, in order to compare the two. What are the chief similarities, the chief differ- ences, and which preponderates over the other? II. A Brief Summary of Platonic Natural Theology and Anthropology 1. Platonic Natural Theology. According to Plato the existence of the divine is rationally demonstrable. Two modes of proof are clearly expressed in the Dialogues. The first of these is a version of the so-called teleological argument. In the Laws (886 a 2) this is definitely given the first position. "In the first place", says Plato, the existence of the divine is proved by "the earth and the sun and the stars and the universe, and the fair order of the seasons...". Such order cannot be ex- plained without an intelligent ordering cause. All science is a search for order. Hence it pre- supposes that order is there. If it were not, the world would be unintelligible. Hence all</page><page sequence="7">PLATO AND CHRISTIANITY 9 science, whether it is aware of the fact or not, presupposes a first ordering principle capable of accounting for the existence of the order it is seeking. This teleological argument is sug- gested with many variations throughout the dialogues (especially Tim. 29, 47, and Phil. 28). The second is developed in great detail from Laws 891 c to 897. The gist of the argument is as follows. Physical things do not move them- selves. But the world is full of physical mo- tion. This must have a source in something that is self-moving. That which can inaugu- rate motion in itself is soul. This was later developed by Aristotle and his successors into the argument from motion and change to a first mover. These arguments are clearly and explicitly stated. Idealistic thinkers, including Mr. Rutenber in a recent book,3 have held that the ontological argument can be derived from cer- tain statements of Plato. This is certainly open to serious doubt and is in my opinion incompatible with the clearcut rejection of idealism at Parmenides 132. The basic prin- ciple of the argument from the varying degrees of perfection is clearly stated at Phaedo 100ff., and in other passages. That which only par- ticipates in beauty, existence, and other perfec- tions must have its first source in something possessing these perfections without restric- tion. But the acceptance of this as an argu- ment for God depends upon the thesis that God is ultimately to be identified with the idea of the good, which is open to question, though accepted by many commentators including Jaeger, Ritter, Adam, Friedliinder and Dies. If this thesis is correct, as I believe it is, we may also find an implicit form of the argument from contingency at Republic 511, where the de- pendency of all things on something intrinsi- cally necessary and self-sustaining (the good) is strongly suggested. In conclusion we may say that of the five later causal arguments developed by Christian philosophy, four are at least implicitly stated by Plato. Two of them, the argument from motion, and the teleological argument are explicitly developed in great detail, though with certain defects which had to be later re- moved. Plato certainly held that the existence of a first principle higher than man could be rationally demonstrated. What is the nature of this being? Here there are important differences. First, the Platonic Deity is only the maker or moulder of a coexistent matter or spatial re- ceptacle, not a creator ex nihilo. Plato cer- tainly never reached this concept. Hence though we read everything possible into Plato's Deity, He still remains a finite being, limited by the external necessity of the receptacle, and subjected to an inner moral need for emanating order and law. Thus even if we hold, as I think is reasonable, that the pattern guiding the demiourgos of the Timaeus is mentally con- tained within a mind and soul, there is only one pattern, leaving no choice of alternatives. There is no possibility of making no world at all, for lacking any vice of envy, He was mor- ally constrained to make or to mould the best possible world. This anthropomorphic conception of a finite God, regarded on the analogy of a human artificer, leaves no place for any essential divine freedom, either with respect to acting or not acting, or with respect to what is to be achieved. This is no doubt a major reason for Plato's failure to focus even human freedom in any very clear and decisive fashion. As we know, this concept was clarified only after the long mediaeval controversy in which Christian thought finally rejected the deterministic im- plications of the theory of a finite God, and turned rather to the view that God is really free, which demands not only the lack of any external constraint expressed in the doctrine of creation ex nihilo, but also the lack of any in- ternal moral constraint, expressed in the doc- trine of unlimited perfection. Without these doctrines, the unrestricted freedom of God in creation cannot be defended. But in spite of this failure to focus the mys- terious and intricate nature of freedom, there are other elements in Plato's explicit theology which tend in another direction. Thus at Re- public 380-1 God is said to be absolutely</page><page sequence="8">10 JOHN WILD changeless, not subject to any external influ- ence, nor to any internal motive leading to transformation. This of course implies un- limited perfection, as Plato himself sees at this point, for he says explicitly "Both God and the attributes of God are in every way best" (381, b 4). In the earlier dialogues Plato thinks of the ideas as the source of all being and intelligi- bility. They are pure, changeless, and truly existent, and sometimes Plato speaks of them as though they could exist alone apart from life and understanding. But in other passages of the later dialogues this view is further qualified. The ideas cannot exist all alone by themselves in forlorn abstraction. Thus at Sophist 248e, a long criticism of this doctrine of the friends of ideas, possibly Plato's own students, is finally terminated by a question and a negative answer. "Heavens," we are asked, "shall we ever be easily persuaded that motion and life and soul and under- standing are absent from the truly existent? Can we believe that it neither lives nor understands, but exists alone in a dreadful fixity, having no trace of insight?"' These passages have been interpreted by many of the best modern commentators as implying an ultimate union of the perfect ideas with a perfect life and consciousness. Perhaps this is hinted by the famous description at Republic 509a ff. of the idea of the good, from which all the other ideas are derived, as being itself beyond all essence and idea. If this in- terpretation can be accepted, we may refer to God as unrestricted intelligence, as well as perfect beauty and goodness (Rep. 379a). If, as the Neoplatonists supposed, the first hy- pothesis of the Parmenides is an outline of Platonic theology, He is perfect unity (Iv) coinciding with perfect existence (6v). These hints and suggestions of unrestricted divinity are to be found in Plato. But it would be pressing things too far to identify this strand of thought with Plato's theology. It remains only a strand of his thought, not as yet freed from association with the very different mythological and anthropomorphic picture of a finite God subject to moral necessity, and struggling against an alien necessity to mould a best possible world. 2. The Platonic Philosophy of Nature. Plato's philosophy agrees with Christianity in its essential opposition to any form of mon- ism or absolutism. The world of time and change, in which finite entities are acted upon and act on one another, possesses only a limited subordinate existence. But it does exist. These entities cannot be discarded as mere illusions. Hence Eleatic monism is rejected. They are quite distinct from one another, and do not melt into an indeterminate fluidity. Hence the Heraclitean flux philosophy is also rejected. These finite things possess determi- nate natures or forms, and fit into an intelligible order or cosmos, to which each nature contrib- utes something. In the Timaeus Plato clearly recognizes the basic elements, inorganic things, plants, animals and men, and a large array of demonic entities beyond the level of man. All this is perfectly consistent with a Christian philosophy of nature. The chief point at issue is the value to be attached to this finite world of changing enti- ties. Here the anthropomorphism of Plato's theology leads him sometimes towards a dualis- tic view in which evil is regarded as a positive force of material necessity or even as an evil soul (Laws Book X), working in a positive way against the divine action, rather than as a privation, resulting primarily from the misuse of freedom. There are certain statements in the Phaedo for example which seem to imply that matter and the human body are evil, and a final state of release from all bodily entangle- ments is portrayed in the myth (114b). Life is then viewed in a Manichaean manner as a conflict between forces of evil and forces of good. This of course is absolutely incompat- ible with Christianity which, following the words of Genesis, regards all positive existence including that of matter and the human body as good, and which must therefore recognize evil as a privation of being, rather than any- thing positive in character. Hence for Chris- tianity freedom from the body cannot be re- garded as a human good but, if it occurs, rather</page><page sequence="9">PLATO AND CHRISTIANITY 11 as an incomplete state of existence in which something essential to human activity is lacking. Nevertheless in spite of this dualistic element in Plato, there are many indications of another independent trend of thought. Thus at Republic 353 ff. the virtue or excellence of any entity including man is defined as the degree to which it fulfills or realizes its natural func- tion. On this view the nature of any entity is regarded as good, and evil can only be the failure of this entity to gain those modes of action which it requires for its completion. Certainly the body is not regarded as evil in the Republic (cf. 443e ff.). And even in the Phaedo, the most Manichaean passages, when read carefully in the Greek, contain important qualifications. The body is evil not intrinsically but only in so far as the soul comes to pay too much attention to it, which is not the fault of the body but rather of the soul. Thus the soul is not so much extraneously enchained, as rather her own accomplice in chaining herself to the body (Phaedo 83). Necessary appetites are clearly distinguished from unnecessary appe- tites, as in the eighth book of the Republic (559). There is nothing evil about the neces- sary appetites and their realization. But when the soul seeks physical things beyond necessity it falls into confusion and is led astray by its own free choice. Thus it is the soul which entombs herself in the body. She is not naturally entombed except by the misuse of her faculties, in seeking material possessions and delights, which the many call life, but which is really death. The aim of the Phaedo is to save men from this death by converting them to the true life of reason which most men confuse with death (64b). It would be futile to deny the dualistic elements in Plato's thought, but in my opinion this non-dualistic tendency represents the more dominant trend. Man is a composite being consisting of a body together with an inner nature that ani- mates it and uses it as an instrument as long as the body is alive. This animating principle or soul has two major portions, that which desires and strives to complete itself, like the active tendency towards completion which is found in all natural entities, and that which cogni- tively assimilates things as they really are in themselves. In man the highest of these cog- nitive faculties is rational insight or noesis which is capable of apprehending the formal nature of each thing as it really is in itself, and thus of guiding human action to its natural goal. The universal pattern of action which is required for the realization of human nature can be apprehended by reason. This is the moral law or the natural law. This precise term was in fact employed by Plato himself in the Gorgias (483e) for the first time in western history. The widespread impression that the concept of natural law was first developed by the Stoics is erroneous. Not only the phrase, but the concept itself is explicitly developed in the Platonic literature. This general pattern of action is always at least dimly known and recognized in those un- written laws which are the foundation for all the more special written enactments 'and decrees (Laws 793). "If they are rightly ordered and made habitual, they shield and preserve the written law; but if they are misunderstood and fall into disorder, then they are like the props of builders which slip away out of their place and cause a universal ruin." The other creatures are bound to the law of their nature by a natural necessity. They must obey in any case without understanding. But man is bound only by a moral necessity. If he is to realize his nature, he must under- stand the law of his being and obey it. But he is free to misunderstand if he so chooses, and to disobey. In this case, he must accept the natural sanctions or penalties which follow from any violation of nature. Thus at Republic 444 the moral order is com- pared to the natural order of physical functions which keeps the body in a healthy state. "The creation of health is the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the body; and the creation of disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this natural order.</page><page sequence="10">12 JOHN WILD And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the creation of injustice the pro- duction of a state of things at variance with the natural order?" This conception of a natural order and a na- tural law lies at the root of the whole Platonic ethics. The duty of man is to become what he really is,-to live a genuinely human life. What does this law command? 3. The Goal of Moral Action. First of all it demands the establishment of a cooperative social order without which even the most rudimentary material needs cannot be satisfied (Rep. 369 C 20). Plato sharply opposes the sophistic view that society is a human construct based merely on a conven- tion or contract. As against this he asserts roundly that it is based upon our natural need (369b). These needs fall into three distinct groups: 1, the need of physical things to sus- tain the body; 2, the need of political delibera- tion and planning to sustain the activity of the soul; and 3, and most important of all, the need of rational insight to provide the commu- nity with a sound and appealing overarching purpose, and to maintain it by educational procedures throughout the change and flux of generations. No matter how ineffectually these functions are performed, they must nevertheless be per- formed in any human community. It must carry on poietic activities to satisfy its mate- rial needs for food, clothing and shelter. It must have some understanding of its nature and the nature of the world in which it lives. Finally it must guide its political activities by these noetic insights. In Plato's Republic, the picture of a truly natural human society, these functions are performed by the artisans, the guardians, and the soldiers and administrators. The fruits of their endeavors are enjoyed by all the citizens in common according to the princi- ple of Platonic justice: from each according to his ability, to each according to his need. Material possessions are instruments not ends. Hence the artisans will be given enough to sustain a comfortable mode of life and to perform their functions. "Under the influence either of poverty or of wealth workmen and their work are equally liable to degenerate" (Rep. 421 E). Hence each extreme will be carefully guarded against by social legislation. The guardians and the administrators will live under an even stricter regimen. "They will receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay, enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more ....Gold and silver we will tell them that they have from God; the diviner metal is within them, and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current among men, and which ought not to pollute the divine. ... The commoner metal has been the source of many unholy deeds, but their own must remain undefiled." (417) The guardian and administrator "in the execution of his work, and in giving his orders to another... will not regard his own interest but always that of his subjects" (347). No city in fact nor any social enterprise will ever be well governed unless it is governed by those who are impelled by a sense of duty in the per- formance of a necessary function, rather than by any motive of self-interest. Such rulers must be guided by an understanding of those natural rights and duties which are prescribed not by any arbitrary decree of any tyrannical ruler or class, but by nature herself. To every individual will be allotted a necessary function which he is best fitted to perform. He will be given whatever is required for the effective performance of this function, as well as his fair share of the common fruits of cultural endeav- our. The most important of these is education. Every child will be given as much education as he can possibly stand,-so far as it lies within the power of the community. Those who cannot understand the basic principles underlying the way of life and the policies of the community, will be expected at least to hold right opinions concerning these, and to carry out their functions to the last degree of their ability. Force will be avoided as the plague, for it is the ruin of all natural order and justice. The first step in the decline of civilization is class war in which the administrative class</page><page sequence="11">PLATO AND CHRISTIANITY 13 finally "enslaves their friends and maintainers whom they have formerly protected in the con- dition of freemen and makes them into subjects and servants" (547). In spite of the many disagreeable things that Toynbee has to say about Plato, the basic principles of his theory of the decline of civilization can be found in the eighth book of the Republic. Toynbee's pene- trating description of the disastrous effects of militarism in history would be anticipated by any careful reader of this dialogue. The at- tempt to rule the tame and rational creature man by force, which is required only for the rule of non-cognitive beings, is a violation of nature which must be punished by the natural sanctions of rebellion, revolution, and the dis- integration of civilization. The failure to tend the higher cognitive faculties of the human soul is the ruin of indi- vidual men and civilizations. Hence in the Gorgias Socrates defends the thesis that it is worse to do injustice than to suffer it, against the rhetoric of Polus. "What do you mean," says the latter. "If a man is detected in an unjust attempt to make himself a tyrant, and when detected, is racked, mutiliated, has his eyes burned out, and after having had all sorts of great injuries inflicted on him, and having seen his wife and children suffer the like, is at last impaled or tarred and burned alive, will he be happier than if he escape and become a tyrant, and continue all through life doing as he pleases and holding the reins of government, the envy and admiration both of citizens and strangers? Is that the paradox which as you say cannot be refuted? "Instead of refuting me," says Socrates, "you are trying to make my flesh creep." (Gorgias, 473) For Socrates and for Plato this is no paradox, but a hard and sober truth capable of convinc- ing any man who will take the trouble to think. Power is worthless unless it is directed by sound insight into a natural end. To suffer injustice affects only the subordinate part of man. It need not affect the higher immaterial portions. Hence it is necessarily the lesser evil. Doing injustice on the other hand is im- possible without a basic ignorance and derange- ment of the intellect and will. Hence it is the greater evil. These principles, so reminiscent of New Testament teaching, do not apply simply to the individual human being. They apply to all social groups as well, for as Plato says, the state is only the individual writ large. There is no divorce between the Platonic morality of individuals and that of states. The individual cannot attain his good except by working with others. And the aim of all social organization is simply to achieve the good of all the individ- ual members. What a contrast this is to our present sharp divorce between individual psychology and social psychology, the isolated human individual, and that hypostatized mon- strosity which we call the group, the state, the social whole, the cultural soul, the objectiver Geist of Hegel, as though the group were some- thing more than its members. Is it any wonder that under the influence of this mon- strous misconception we have accepted a pre- posterous double standard of morality, so that all those fiendish acts for which we would bitterly blame and condemn an individual like deception, espionage, cruelty, torture, blood- lust, and murder, are passively accepted as normal when performed in the name of that fictitious leviathan, the state? Human nature is a material likeness of the Divine. Hence the true statesman must al- ways have his eye on the divine pattern. As Plato says, "no state can be happy which is not designed by artists who imitate the heavenly pattern.... And one feature they will erase and another they will put in until they have made the ways of men as far as possible agreeable to the ways of God." (501c) This basic conception of the imitation of God (6OwoaLs 0Oe4) underlies the whole Platonic ethics, for all existence to some degree partici- pates in the divine perfection. Hence the aim of all activity is to intensify such participation. This applies not only to the political activity of the human group but to the individual ac- tivity of the human person. The same princi- ples apply to both. They are expressed with peculiar clarity in the great speech contrasting the lawyer with the philosopher in the Theaete- tus. This speech culminates with the following exposition of the theme of divine imitation.</page><page sequence="12">14 JOHN WILD 'We ought to fly away from earth to heaven as quickly as possible (but notice-this flight is not to be thought of in extricationist terms). To fly away is to become like God so far as that is possible (4wvy) b 6poowLcs Oe^ Kcar4 rh - vwarb6) and to become like him is to be just and holy as wisdom directs. But Oh my friend you cannot easily convince mankind that they should pursue virtue or avoid vice, not merely in order that a man may seem to be good, which is the reason given by the world, and in my judgment is only a repetition of an old wives tale. Whereas, the truth is that God is never in any way unjust-He is perfect justice; and he of us who is the most righteous is most like Him. Herein is seen the true cleverness of a man, and also his nothingness and want of manhood. For to know this is true wisdom and virtue, and ignorance of this is manifest folly and vice.... There are two patterns eternally set before them; the one blessed and divine, the other Godless and wretched: but most people do not see them or perceive that in their utter folly and infatuation they are growing like the one and unlike the other, by reason of their evil deeds; and the penalty is, that they lead a life answering to the pattern which they are growing like." (176) As a man thinks and sees in his heart so is he. 4. The Platonic Ideology and Its Enemies. The very essence of a human civilization or a human group of any sort is the way it under- stands itself and its overarching aim,--what we now call its ideology. The Platonic ideol- ogy is centered in his conception of God. What is this? It is best summarized I believe in his own words at the end of his last dialogue, the Laws (Book X). It certainly contains close approximations to the three essential ele- ments in Christian ideology. The first two are perhaps best summarized in Plato's own words at the end of his last dialogue, the Laws. "Then the three assertions-that the Gods exist, and that they are concerned with the affairs of men, and that they can never be persuaded to do injustice are now sufficiently demonstrated." (Laws, 907) This is the core of the Platonic ideology. First, though there are a great number of di- vine beings, there is one supreme God, clearly referred to at Phaedo 106 d, Republic 382 d, 597 c, and Laws 913 d. This thesis is certainly accepted by the most reliable commentators. John Burnet saysS that "it cannot be doubted that Plato personally believed in One God". Grube8 admits a strong monotheistic tendency. Taylor' says that on Aquinas' definition of monotheism as a belief in the sovereignty of a supreme will and intelligence over all lesser objects of worship, Plato was a monotheist. St. Augustine, together with almost all the Neo-Platonists, held that Plato's whole hierar- chical philosophy culminates in a single su- preme source of being and intelligibility as is expressly stated in Republic VI and in the ladder of the Symposium. That this being has a direct concern for the individual events of human history is also asserted in the passage we have just read. In- deed Plato holds here that next to complete atheism, the disbelief in any divine care for individual thoughts and deeds is the most serious of all theological misconceptions. Plato's own sense of the primary importance of concrete living acts as over against mere rational abstractions is expressed at Timaeus 19 b 4, after a theoretical discussion in which the nature of the polis has been abstractly con- sidered as it is in general. "I feel now about this order," Socrates says, "as if someone had beheld certain fine living creatures either only painted, or perhaps alive but utterly at rest, and had come to desire to behold them moving and exercising... ." It is now realized8 that at the end of his life Plato planned a great philosophy of history which was to include an account of the origin of the world in the Timaeus, early pre-history in the Critias, past history in the Hermocrates, and the outline of a sound practical program for the establishment of a future political order in the Laws. Only the first and last members of this vast tetralogy were ever completed. But a deep and intense interest in the philoso- phy of history is an integral portion of the genuine Platonic heritage, and it is significant that Augustine, the author of the first great influential attempt to interpret the meaning of human history was influenced by Plato more than by any other philosophical writer. Even if we accept Plato's mythical tales of transmi- gration as authentic beliefs, which is very dubious, it still remains true that the events of human history are of tremendous importance</page><page sequence="13">PLATO AND CHRISTIANITY 15 and have a decisive effect on the ultimate des- tiny of the immortal soul. As for the third element, the freedom of man and the rejection of any deterministic view of history, here also we find a Platonic parallel. It is true that Plato never works out a com- plete and detailed theory of freedom. Never- theless it is certainly implicit in his doctrine of man, and at certain points is unambiguously expressed. Thus in the Myth of Er at the end of the Republic the souls of those who are about to be born into the world are gathered together before the three daughters of Necessity, Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos. Lots and samples of lives taken from the knees of Lache- sis are spread before them and then they are addressed as follows by a prophet: "Mortal souls behold a new cycle of life and mor- tality. Your guiding spirit will not be imposed upon you. You will choose your spirit. Now let him who draws the first lot make the first choice of the life with which he will then be joined of necessity. But virtue (&amp;per9l) is not despotically forced (a5&amp;rarorov) upon anyone. As he himself honors or dishonors her so will he have more or less of her. The responsibility lies with him who chooses. God is not responsible for this." (Rep. 617 e) Here we find the three factors of chance (in the drawing of the lots), necessity (in the im- plications of the choices once made), and choice (in the choosing of the life) all recognized. Chance may restrict or enlarge the range of free choice, but it always leaves room for important choices to be made. Once a choice has been made for good or ill, the Fates work out its consequences with inexorable necessity. But the choice of virtue or vice is not despotically imposed by God. He is no despot. Here man is responsible and free. He himself de- termines by free choice the moral quality (cf. Laws 904 a) of his life. This view is certainly irreconcilable with any absolutistic theory of historical determinism. Plato was always ready to toss even his most cherished convictions into the burning fire of dialectical criticism. No one has attacked his ideas with more intensity than Plato himself. Many readers of the dialogues have interpreted this critical fire as an all-consuming fire of scepticism. This I believe to be a mistake. It is rather a testing, purifying fire from which certain basic doctrines emerge unscathed. I have tried to suggest to you what these basic convictions are. I do not see how anyone can read the dialogues carefully without seeing the remarkable degree to which they approximate the philosophic doctrines of the Judaeo-Chris- tian tradition. The world has been made and ordered by a first intelligent cause, who is concerned with the individual events of human history, but who leaves man free to choose for himself what mat- ters the most, the moral quality of his life. Man is free either to exercise his understanding, to grasp his nature and his natural end, and to cooperate with his fellows in attaining it, or to neglect reason, his highest natural faculty, and to follow his subjective passions which must lead him into chaos and tyranny. The facts show plainly that man has not followed the former course. Plato is no optimist. As he says (Rep. 379), "few are the goods of human life, and many are the evils, and the good is to be attributed to God alone ...". But even in the darkness and ruin which surround us, the faculty of reason is still accessible to give us light. This light is dim and flickering. Neverthe- less it is the best that is naturally available. Hence if we are wise we shall accept the advice of Simmias in the Phaedo 85 d and "cling to the best and most stable of human theories as the raft upon which we sail through life, unless we discover some word of God on which we may still more safely sail." This famous pas- sage is not the only text in which Plato suggests the possibility of special aid from above. Once a civilization begins to disintegrate as in Plato's own time, so formidable are the diffi- culties standing in the way of any individual attempting to live a natural human life that as he asserts in the Republic 492 e, "in the present evil state of community life whatever is saved and comes to be as it should be is saved only by the special allotment of God (0eo9 poopa), as is most truly said."</page><page sequence="14">16 JOHN WILD So close is the agreement between the major theses of Platonic philosophy and those of Christianity that even their enemies and dis- eases are the same. The chief philosophic enemy of Platonism is that philosophic natural- ism or materialism which must deny the exist- ence of any higher immaterial being, and the existence of any immaterial or truly rational faculty in man. As the doctrine of divine sovereignty in Christianity can be easily twisted into a theological absolutism which turns God into a despotic ruler or king, so is the Platonic doctrine of an inclusive cosmic order, which unfortunately influenced St. Augustine, easily misinterpreted as a forceful dictatorship which stifles freedom of choice. Just as the Christian doctrine of divine transcendance has been, and still is easily twisted into a theory of extricationism for the benefit of pure souls desiring an escape from life as something naturally evil, so is the Pla- tonic doctrine of divine imitation and the practice of death in the Phaedo readily inter- preted as a condemnation of matter and change and a call to world flight. Sometimes these diseases have passed from the one parent body to the other, and aided and abetted each other. But the best Christian thought as well as the most authentic Platonism have resisted them. Both have held that God is no despotic tyrant, and that the material world is not hopelessly corrupt. In view of this amazing agreement concern- ing God, the world, and man, and his noetic, politic, and poietic needs, it is no wonder that great thinkers like Philo and St. Augustine, deeply immersed in both traditions, should have imagined some initial contact to explain the similarity, Plato in Egypt perhaps, or even in Palestine. This of course is impossible. But the truth is perhaps even more hopeful in its implications. What it would seem to im- ply is the capacity of the human mind, working seriously and critically by itself, to arrive at a close approximation to the central truths of religion, and on the other hand the essential reasonableness of Christianity. From this thought I believe that we may take courage and hope.
