<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEIDEGGERS TOPIC : EXCESS, RECESS, ACCESS by Thomas SHEEHAN (Chicago) Bergson has written that every great philosopher thinks only one inexhaustible thought and spends his whole life trying to express it : Et c'est pourquoi il a parlé toute sa vie. x Over the half-century of his professional life, Martin Heidegger continued to insist that his thinking was focused on one topic only and that this topic was utterly simple. However, the task of defining and articulating that simple topic, die Sache selbst, has proven to be no easy matter either for Heidegger himself or for his commentators. It is a truism to say that the subject matter or issue of Heidegger's thought is „the question of Being* ' {die S eins frage), but like most truisms, it is both correct and potentially misleading. Indeed, it could be argued that one might enhance clarification of Heidegger's topic by retiring the terms „Being" and „the question of Being" from the discussion. For one thing, „the question of Being" is a condensation of a longer phrase (its earliest form reads : the question of the meaning of Being), and for another, the full form of the phrase underwent changes throughout Heidegger's career (the question of the meaning of Being -&gt; the question of the truth of Being -&gt; the question of the place of Being). For another thing, the word „Being" {das Sein) has two 1. Henri Bergson, Oeuvres, Édition du centenaire, ed., André Robinet, Paris : Pres- ses Universitaires de France, 1970, p. 1347.

There is the added problem that the word (especially capitalized in English) seems to suggest inevitably a metaphysical super-entity, which is anathema to Heidegger's intentions. Furthermore, when we read about Being „hiding itself' or „sending itself ' to man, we may find it hard not to believe that Heidegger has lapsed into theology, mysticism, or some kind of metaphysical anthropomorphism. And perhaps most important of all, talk about Being „itself" {das Sein selbst} can easily lose sight of the analogical character of Being. We know that, ever since he read Brentano's dissertation and raised the question about the unified meaning of das Sein, Heidegger has never been after a univoca! „something" subsisting on its own. Over and above the Being of man, implements, nature, artworks, ideal objects, and so forth, there is no second level of „Being itself" in some kind of Platonic hypostasization. Rather, the „itself" (in German we could equally say : überhaupt) refers to the analogically unified meaning of das Sein (in Aristotelian terms, its pros hen unity) which is instantiated in all cases of the Being of this or that. The real task, of course, consists in sorting out Heidegger's unique reading of this analogical unity. Over and above the foregoing problems with the use of the word „Being," there is the matter of Heidegger's audacious claim that the question of Being has been entirely forgotten in the Western philosophical tradition. In that regard Professor Helmut Franz tells an anecdote about a philosophy conference in 1958 at which Heidegger had discussed this supposed fate of metaphysics. A Protestant participant asked Heidegger whether it were not the case that at least Martin Luther was an exception to this charge. Heidegger quipped : Would you care to guess how many Catholics ask me the same thing about Thomas Aquinas ? 2 2.

After the painstaking work of Etienne Gilson and others, is it not the legitimate claim of neo-Thomism that Aquinas raised metaphysical questioning to a new and creative level by his thematization of the primacy of esse, the existential act of Being, over essence ? Whereas Aristotle's philosophy retained form as the highest actuality, Aquinas compared form to esse as potency to a higher actuality. „Being [esse] is the actuality of every form or nature" (S.T., I, 3, 4, c). „Being itself [ipsum esse] is the most perfect of all ; indeed, it is compared as act to everything. For nothing has actuality except insofar as it is. Thus Being itself is the actuality of all things" (S.T., I, 4, 1, ad 3). And since in God there is perfect simplicity and nothing potential, it follows that at the apex of reality essence is existence : „God is Being itself subsisting per se" (S.T., I, 4, 2, c). „The divine essence is Being itself" (S.T., I, 12, 2, ad 3). Surely, the neo-Thomist insists, there is no f orgetf ulness of Being here ! And indeed, the various attempts to rescue Aquinas from Heidegger's indictment generally consist in demonstrating - irrefutably, as far as I can see - that in Aquinas existentia or ipsum esse has primacy over essentia, indeed that essentia is reducible to esse. 3 And yet Heidegger, who is far from ignorant of Aquinas' metaphy- sical revolution and of its rediscovery in this century, and who freely grants this achievement, still maintains that in Aquinas, as much as in Plato or Nietzsche, „Being" is forgotten. Clearly Heidegger's „Being" means something different from Aquinas' ipsum esse or actus essendi. As a preliminary and merely formal indication of the difference, we may say that Heidegger is asking for the possibilizing condition of what Aquinas called esse, and that from this viewpoint all the ultimate 3.

One way to get at the simple topic which commands Heidegger's thought is to distinguish the two meanings of „Being," the one that was the sole and exclusive topic throughout the history of metaphysics, and the other that is the prerogative only of a pre- or post-metaphysical thinking. In the first sense, „Being" refers to the highest ontological or theological principle discoverable by traditional ontology. This we shall call generically „beingness" {Seiendheit). In the second sense, ,. Being" refers to a pre-ontological principle undiscovered and un- discoverable by the tradition : the prior event whereby beingness can „be" at all. And by this Heidegger does not mean creation, but, in the most general terms, the happening of the world of sense in which man lives and moves and 'is. Let us not yet give a name to this second sense, other than to say that it is „Being" in Heidegger's use of the term. We can see already why Heidegger eventually dropped das Sein from his lexicon in order to avoid confusion with „beingness" in all its historical forms. „BEING" AS BEINGNESS The problematic of metaphysics is that constellation of questions which ultimately reduces to one : What is the „core" of each and every thing that exists ? In other words, what is a being insofar as it is at all ? This is the question of beings as being (Greek : on h'ei on). Aristotle articulates this clearly : „The ever-puzzling question which has always been asked and still is being asked today - namely, the question 'What is a being?' - comes down to this question: 'What is beingness ?' " {Metaphysics Z, 1, 1028 b 2). Explanation : The uniqueness of a properly philosophical question is that it looks away from and „beyond" the obvious dimensions of things in order to ask about what we may call the „-ness" dimension of things. It moves, for example, beyond vitues to virtue-»m in Plato's Meno, or beyond pious acts to piety in the Euthyphro, and so on. In the broadest sense, the philosophical question is that of the „essence" or</page><page sequence="5">HEIDEGGERS TOPIC : EXCESS, RECESS, ACCESS 619 „X-ness" of X. Here we do not use „essence" in contradistinction to „existence," but in the broad sense which covers both sides of that distinction. And if we designate this „essence" as ousia or „beingness," we use that latter tenm not in the specifically Aristotelian sense, but in the broader sense which covers „essence" or „beingness" in the whole tradition, that is, wherever the question „What is a being as being ?" (i.e., in its beingness) is asked. 4 If every philosophical question is an inquiry into the „essence" or „X-ness" of X, the highest form of philosophy, prõtê philosophia, does not ask about the „essence" of particular regions of things (the X-ness of all Xs, the Y-ness of all Ys), but asks about the „is-ness" of all that is. Now, to designate this „is-ness" or state-of-being which characterizes beings as beings, Aristotle took over from popular usage of his day the noun ousia. It is derived from the present participle of the verb eimi, einai („to be") and specifically from the feminine singular, ousa, just as the neuter of that participle supplies the words on or anta („a being," „beings"). The noun ousia in its popular and non-philosophical meaning referred to that which was properly one's own, one's present possessions (for example, livestock, tools, land), one's holdings or property or „substance." When taken up by Aristotle as a philosophical term, it came to mean a concrete reality or that which makes anything (a tode ti) be a concrete reality. In English we use the word „reality" in this bivalent sense. It can refer to a concrete individual or state-of- affairs („A united Vietnam is now a reality," „Widespread crime is a reality") or equally to that which lets a concrete individual be real („What is the reality of contemporary capitalism ?"). The word ousia refers both to that which is and to its „is-ness" or „state-of-being." Heidegger sometimes translates it (or equally, to on, which has the same bivalence) as „das Seiend s ein" a being-in-its-state-of -being. Ousia was eventually translated into Latin as, among other things, essentia, but not in contradistinction to real existential being. When St Augus- tine in De Doctrina Christiana, I, c. 32, no. 35, says that „God is that 4. Martin Heidegger, The End of Philosophy, trans., Joan Stambaugh. New York : Harper and Row, 1973, pp. 1-10.</page><page sequence="6">620 Thomas SHEENAN essentia which the Greeks used to call ousia" he is not denying real actual being of God. „For just as sapient ia comes from sapere, and as scientia comes from s cire, so also essentia comes from esse" (ibid.). Here, essentia means „beingness," inclusive of both essence and existence in the narrower senses, and it characterizes a being insofar as it is at all and is what it is. We may use ousia or beingness, therefore, as a heuristic device to indicate the unknown in the question, „What is a being as such ?" Thus Aristotle can say that the question which defines first philosophy comes down to the question, „What is beingness ?" And ¿n that regard Heidegger can read the whole history of meta- physics, from Plato through Aquinas to Nietzsche, as controlled by this same question, the search for the analogical unity of beingness as the substantial ground and cause of actual beings, regardless of the particular interpretations of beingness that emerge in the tradition. In Prof. Werner Marx's phrase, the history of metaphysics as a whole and in each of its parts is an „ousiology" or doctrine of ousia in the broad sense of that word. Regardless of whether whatness (essence) or that- ness (existence) is given priority, metaphysics always moves within the same heuristic parameters. One may wish to claim that certain forms of beingness are improvements over others (e.g., Aquinas' „existential' ' beingness over Aristotle's form-centered beingness), but then one is only speaking of revolutions within metaphysics and not of a revolution against metaphysics. Moreover, metaphysics works out the beingness of beings in a two- fold pattern that constitutes a unified science. The question „What is a being as being ?" asks about the entity's ontological constitution in general and about the beingness of the highest entity, the divine. In Heidegger's telling, all metaphysics is onto-theo-logical : ontological in that it transcends beings to their beingness, and theological in that it seeks ultimate cause or ground (theion). Heidegger goes so far as to say : „Even Nietzsche's metaphysics as ontology is ... at the same time theology." 5. 5. Martin Heidegger, Nietzsche, Pfullingen : Neske, 1961, II, 348.</page><page sequence="7">HEIDEGGER'S TOPIC: EXCESS, RECESS, ACCESS 621 So far, the discussion of „Being* ' as beingness has led to these conclusions : (1) The exclusive prerogative of traditional metaphysics 'is the question of the beingness (state-of -being) of beings, the whatness and/or thatness of whatever is under discussion. (2) The tradition's name for the beingness of beings is the „Being" of beings under a variety of nomenclatures : the idea of beings, the energeia of beings, the esse of beings, and so forth. But thus far Heidegger's discussion of beingness has gotten no further than discovering the unity of the metaphysical tradition in the most general terms. There is a second step in his reading whereby he uncovers a first level of the hidden meaning of that unity. Beingness in all its historical forms conceals a certain relation to man. The beingness of beings is fundamentally not something „out there' ' in beings but rather the meaningful relatedness, the intelligible presentness, of things to and for man. That does not necessarily mean that beings are „objects" for man the „subject" (this is only one form of relatedness, and a fairly modern one). Rather, beingness as this implicit referredness of beings to man - even if it is suppressed or overlooked - means the „intelligible disclosure" or „revealedness" of beings, in Greek, their alëtheia. When we speak here of „intelligibility", we mean »it not just as „theoretical knowability" but rather in the broader sense of „meaningful accessibility". And the peculiarity of the Greeks as the spiritual forefathers of the West consists in the fact that in a unique way their culture - their poetry, drama, sculpture, thought - understood implicitly and celebrated at large this openness or revealedness, this up-front-ness of things. The word eidos - the visible shape or meaningful appearance of things - summarizes and typifies this Greek vision. It says that the world of things is open, accessible, present for man. To be is to appear. To be sure, the „to- ness" or relatedness to man is not thematized (and if it were, it would not denote, at least in the Greeks, any kind of objectivity before a subject). The implicitness of it all constitutes the beauty and the naïveté of the Greek world. Man is „all eyes" and therefore caught up in seeing the world as just „there." No subjectivity, no anthro-</page><page sequence="8">622 Thomas SHEENAN pocentrism, only captivation by the openness of things. Greek culture lives the „natural attitude" at its (best. Thus the word ousia, whidi we initially and very blandly translated as „beingness," has overtones of „presentness" (parousia) and „open- ness" (detheia), indeed of „emergence into presentness and openness" (physis). All these terms really indicate the same phenomenon. By pushing the problematic of ousia back to that of parousia and detheia, Heidegger has located the proper issue of Greek philosophy in the disclosive bond (logos, legein) between man and beingness. The „togetherness" of man and beingness, already formally indicated in Fragment 3 of Parmenides, is the hidden issue : the appearance or openness of things in conjunction with the essence of man as allowing that appearance to happen. Heidegger cannot claim that this togetherness of beingness and man was explicit and thematic in early Greek thought (what he calls the „first origin"). In fact, the first task of his deconstruction and retrieval of the Greeks is to uncover this dimension and thematize it for the first time - what he calls the „second origin". But thematizing it is not enough. The second origin includes as well an articulation of what the first origin left unsaid, namely, how the happening of dêtheia and parousia takes place. Negatively, then, we may say that his problematic is not the original Greek meaning of aletheia and presentness, no matter how much Heidegger-commentators seem to think it is. Positively, we may anticipate a bit and say that Heidegger is after the hidden movement which is the bond between man and aletheia and which makes aletheia possible at all. He is after the „beingness" of beingness, the essence of „essence," which he finds in the kinetic bond {logos as kinesis) „between" man and beingness. But if this bond was not thematic in the tradition, neither was it unknown. With Parmenides philosophy sought to clarify beingness by reflecting on the thinking (noein) of beingness (cf. Fr. 3). In Plato the disclosure of the Ideas takes its bearings from the soul's monologue (logos) with itself (cf. Sophistes, 245 e). In Aristotle the categories of beingness are connected with the assertorie knowledge of logos. In</page><page sequence="9">HEIDEGGER'S TOPIC : EXCESS, RECESS, ACCESS 623 Aquinas the agent intellect is seen as revelatory excessus towards beingness. In Descartes First Philosophy is explicitly founded on the res cogitons. In Kant, „The conditions of the possibility of experience in general are at the same time the conditions of the possibility of the objects of experience/' In short, the proper subject matter of philosophy has always been implicitly seen as the bond between beingness and man, between the openness and presence of things and the essence of being human. 6 We may now add two more conclusions to those already made concerning the explanation of „Being' ' as beingness : (3) The problem- atic of beingness is implicitly phenomenaiogicû : beingness is the appearing (openness, presentness) of things. (4) The problematic of beingness is implicitly phenomeno/og/W : it points to the problematic of the disclosive bond - essential to the appearing of things - between man and beingness. And if we pull all four conclusions into a unity, we have a clear, if schematic, definition of metaphysics. It is the ontological-theological search for the beingness (ultimate what-ness and that-ness) of things, one which unfolds historically in various modes of beingness, all of which are implicitly modes of the presence or appearance of things in necessary conjunction with man's essence as „allowing" this appearance. Now, if Heidegger is willing to concede that much to the traditional notion of „Being" as beingness, what is left over as the topic for his own thinking ? What could possibly have been forgotten in meta- physics ? Answering this question will require intermediate steps, but for now we may be satisfied with a formal indication of the direction in which Heidegger will move. Beingness is the intelligible presence of ¡beings, it 's that which allows beings to show up in the specifically human world. Beingness, therefore, is the possibilizing condition of beings showing up. But the prior question which Heidegger asks is : What lets beingness itself show up, what puts it into action in the specifically 6.

Thomas Sheehan, Listening 12, 3 (Fall, 1977), 111.</page><page sequence="10">624 Thomas SHEENAN human world ? In other words, if beingness is the presence of beings, what occasions the presence of presence ? Or yet again : If beingness is the „essence" of beings, what is the „essence of essence" ? AH such ways of putting Heidegger's question indicate a shift of focus from beings towards beingness itself. Of course, metaphysics is already aware of beingness, but only in terms of how it allows beings to be meaningfully present. Heidegger seeks to become aware of beingness in and for itself. Granted that beingness is always and only the beingness of beings, the question remains : What brings about beingness ? And since, as the tradition implicitly knew, beingness is necessarily tied into man's essence, what about man's unique relation not to beings but to the „happening" of beingness ? Clearly, these questions are not to be read as pointing towards creation but rather towards the disclosive bond between man and beingness, a conjunction operative wherever man is man and beingness appears, but which gets covered over both in everyday life and in the thematic science called metaphysics. To look ahead and anticipate some of Heidegger's own terminology, we may say : This bond is proper to man, indeed he is appropriated into it willy nilly, for beingness „needs" man in order to appear. In order to be truly what he in fact already is, man must personally re-appropriate his state of being already appropriated into this bond. We are alluding to the language of Ereignis and Eigentlich- keit and therefore to the unity of the so-called earlier and later Heidegger. The issue in both periods is the same : that of coming towards or becoming {zukommen) that which is essential, prior and already operative (das Ge-Wesene), or equally, letting this „alreadiness" come towards oneself. What is this „alreadiness" ? It is the always already operative disclosive bond into which man is appropriated and which is registered in his essence in terms of his own alreadiness : his thrownness. Resolve and authenticity (Eigentlichkeit) mean simply waking up to and „allowing" one's appropriation - unto - beingness (Ereignis). Heidegger's topic, then, is not the question of „Being" as beingness (the tradition beat him to the punch on that), but the question of the disclosive bond or appropriation which lets beingness</page><page sequence="11">HEIDEGGERS TOPIC : EXCESS, RECESS, ACCESS 625 happen at all. If the heuristic device for indicating the sought-for unknown in all of metaphysics was „beingness," Heidegger's heuristi- con goes under a plurality of headings : the question of the meaning of beingness, the area-of- projection {Entwurfbereich) of beingness, the „truth19 of beingness, the clearing or place of beingness, and so on. But these formal indications of Heidegger's topic require more concrete demonstration, and that means an intermediate step. If phenomenology is always and only about the immediate presence of whatever it deals with, and if metaphysics is about the presentness of present beings, then how can Heidegger go „behind'' that presentness to ask how it comes about - if he intends, as he claimed he did, to remain a phenomenologist to the end ? Clearly, beingness itself - and not just beings - must become a phenomenon, something seen as immediately experienceable by man. Concretely this means focusing on the unique correlation between beingness and man, and, more specifi- cally, freeing beingness from its traditional imprisonment in the copula of sentential logic. These services were performed for Heidegger by Edmund Husserl's ground-breaking work, Logical Investigations. HUSSERL : PHENOMENOLOGICAL ACCESS TO BEINGNESS With such questions as these, Heidegger came time and again to the text of Husserl's which was to remain the most important for him : Logical Investigations VI, chapter 6, „Sensuous and Categorial In- tuitions." 7 Although he began reading the work as early as 1909, when he entered Freiburg University, it was some years before its import for his own question about the unified meaning of beingness became apparent to him. The title of this chapter at one and the same time pointed towards Kant and away from him. Whereas the general theme of the Second Part of the Sixth Investigation, „Sense and Under- 7.

But Husserl's chapter broadens the range of intuitive givenness beyond Kant's limitation of it to the realm of the senses and sense data. Husserl's aim in this Investigation was phenomenological clarification of truth (i.e., true knowledge) by means of a phenomenological analysis of the identity-synthesis, specifically by analyzing how categorial as well as sensuous meaning-intentions are fulfilled. For such a phenomenologi- cal clarification, the categorial content must itself become a pheno- menon, an immediate and intuitable given, analogous to the immediate givenness of sense data. And since intuition bespeaks an „immediate presence to...," then the dimension of the categorial must enter presentness. What is this dimension of the categorial ? It is the tradition's name for beingness, that which makes a thing accessible to understanding as what and how it is. Both Kant and Husserl stand within the long tradition wherein the doctrine of beingness (Seinslelne) is a doctrine of categories (Kategorienlehre). In that tradition, beingness is always - explicitly or not - correlative to a revelatory enunciation (logos) and specifically to a categorial-predicative enunciation (logos apo- phantikos, apophansis). To that degree, ontology is the theoretical revealing of beingness-as-categorial. (To be sure, in this sixth chapter Husserl was not explicitly interested in elaborating the categories the way metaphysics from Aristotle to Hegel was, but only in establishing the analogy between sensation and categorial intuition. Thus, although the categorial intuition appears in the Investigations, it does not become an explicit ontological thematic.) Husserl discusses the phenomenological presentness of the categorial dimension in terms of a „surplus" (Ueberschuss) of meaning over and above the perceptual sensuous presentation. For Kant, only thé sense</page><page sequence="13">HEIDEGGERS TOPIC : EXCESS, RECESS, ACCESS 627 &lt;iata are given, and the category (e.g., „substance" ') is simply a form for organizing that data. Husserl, however, demonstrates how the propositional categorial form of a statement can attain to intuitive fulfillment. When one says, „The landscape is beautiful" or just „Beautiful landscape !" he knows the landscape as beautiful. The entrance of this „as- factor" indicates the surplus of meaning beyond the sense intuition. The landscape as beautiful = the landscape is beautiful. But there is nothing in sense perception corresponding to form- words like „is." Rather, the surplus of meaning requires another act, the categorial, in order to be seen. This categorial act, to be sure, is founded on sense perception, but it also lets the sensuously appearing object be manifest as what and how it is, i.e., in its beingness^dimemian beyond the purely formal sense of being in the copula. And since for Husserl intuition is the model for knowledge (because true knowledge must have the character of fulfillment and identity), then he will have to broaden intuition beyond that of individual objects to include general and categorial objects in a categorial intuition. The object of categorial intuition is „what is universal, what is merely documented in [sensuous] intuition" (Logical Investigations, p. 778). As far as Heidegger is concerned, this discovery of the surplus of intuitable categorial meaning and the rendering of this surplus as equally present as is sense data, mark the major achievement of the chapter. Beingness is given to a categorial intuition in a way analogous to how the sensuous being is given to sense intuition. Beingness - that whereby one knows a thing as what and how it is - is not derived from the Table of Judgments as it is in Kant, but is given as a phenomenon. There are two levels of givenness, and man has immediate access to both. Husserl's discovery, his rendering present of the beingness- dimension of beings, may be roughly diagrammed as follows : categorial intuition &gt; BEINGNESS sensuous intuition » BEINGS</page><page sequence="14">628 Thomas SHEENAN With this discovery of beingness as the presentness of beings, itself immediately present, Heidegger now had a clue for returning to Plato, Aristotle, and the whole tradition, and for reading ¡beingness in terms of time, and specifically in terms of the one moment of the present. To say that something „is" is to say that it „is-present-now." All of metaphysics implicitly reads beingness in terms of the present. But Husserl's discovery also opened up for Heidegger the question which his master did not pose. Now that Husserl had broken the stranglehold of the apophantic assertion in ontology, i.e., now that he had rescused beingness from the copula and had rendered it present for itself as an immediately intuitable phenomenon, Heidegger could ask about how // is given. If beingness is the givenness of beings, and if this givenness- of... is itself given, then it too can be treated as a phenomenon and can be questioned as to tibe „how" of its becoming present. To use language that Heidegger developed in his earliest courses after World War I, Husserl had uncovered the Bezugssinn operative in ontology : the sense of relation between beingness and man. But the Volhugssinn remains to be settled : the sense of the „how" in which the Bezugs sinn is carried out. For Heidegger that Volhugssinn essentially has to do with man's temporality, his presence-by-absence, his having of himself and his world by being out beyond himself in self-absence. That dimension of absence into which man is appropriated is what makes possible the happening of beingness as the presence of all that is. With his reading of Logical Investigations Heidegger had found the clue to transcending the problematic of the beingness-of -beings so as to ask the question of the meaning of beingness as such. For all his lack of regard for the tradition, Husserl had brilliantly uncovered its major premise, unspoken since the Greeks, that the true field for philosophy was the correlation between eidos and logos, between the presentness/appearance of beings and man's essence as essential to and bound into that appearance. By reading that correlation in terms of immediate phenomenological presentness, Husserl freed the being- ness-issue from its captivity in Kantian formalism and opened the way to the promised land of the question about the possibilizing condition</page><page sequence="15">HEIDEGGERS TOPIC : EXCESS, RECESS, ACCESS 629 of beingness. But he was refused access by his self-restriction to the issues of consciousness and objectivity. It was Heidegger's privilege to enter that land and to chart its topology. This he did by pushing the eidos-logos correlation of immediacy and presentness back to the prior question of the kinesis or movement which is the very enactment {Vollzug) of the bond between man and beingness. Since kinesis is primarily a matter of presence-by-absence (in Aristotle's terms : energeia that is still bound up with dynamis ; hence, energeia ateies), Heidegger enters the promised land by reawakening the question of absence (future, past) as the condition of presence (beingness). THE „KINETIC" MEANING OF BEINGNESS It is well known that Sein und Zeit (hereafter : SZ) was projected in two Parts, the first of which was to determine, on the basis of a new understanding of man as temporality, the time-character of being- ness in general and of its possible variations, whereas the second Part would use this time-character of beingness as the due for reducing the traditional ontology to its underlying temporal content. The second Part would confirm by historical „deconstruction" what the first Part had established by phenomenological „construction* ' : the new doctrine of the analogical unity of all modes of beingness. Unlike the traditional feport that claimed that „beingness qua stable presentness" exhausted the meaning of beingness, Heidegger would show that the absential moments of temporal movement (the so-called „past" and „future") are the co-efficients of - that which allows - beingness as presentness. The meaning of beingness would be read in terms of time on the basis of an analysis of man's essence as temporality. Each of the two Parts of the work had three projected Divisions, but the work got no further than Part I, Division 2. Part I as a whole is entitled „The Interpretation of Existence in terms of Temporality [= Part I, Divisions 1 and 2] and the Explication of Time as the Transcendental Horizon for the Question of [the meaning of] Beingness [= Part I, Division 3]." SZ I.I would establish that the</page><page sequence="16">630 Thomas SHEENAN structure of man's existence is „care" (Sorge), SZ 1.2 would interpret the meaning of care as temporality (Zeitlichkeit), and SZ 1.3 .- the unpublished Division entitled „Time and Beingness" - would show how Zeitlichkeit, in its horizon-forming function called Tern por alitât f determines the analogically unified temporal meaning of beingness. The complexity of the analysis of individual issues within SZ can tend to block a dear view of the overarching movement of the whole work. To state it simply : Man as „excess" (ahead of himself and already in a world) holds open the area of „access1 ' to (or intelligibility of) beings. As an „excess" which makes possible „access," man is the Da, the „there" or open area of intelligibility, where „intelligibility" does not mean „theoretical knowability" but more broadly, the „accessibility of beings in meaningfulness". SZ I.I reads human being as constituted by three moments. (1) Existentiality : Man's existence is ahead of itself. (2) Facticity : Man is ahead of himself by being already in a world of meaning. (3) Being among (Sein bei) : Man's already-ahead-ness holds open the realm of intelligibility within which he has access to, and in everdayness is „fallen into," the things of his concern. These three moments are in fact reducible to two : (1) Existence is already projected possibility, i.e., factical existentiality, (2) which yields possible encounter with things. Excess possibilizes access, and the whole is called „transcen- dence." Part I, Division 2, „Existence and Temporality," first shows what existence is ultimately already-out- towards, viz., its most proper pos- sibility of dying ; and secondly shows how man is called to take over and accept that aheadness, viz., in conscience and resolve. It then spells out the temporal meaning of the whole structure. In the excess-dimen- sion there are two moments, aheadness and alreadiness. (1) As ahead of himself, man is becoming his most proper possibility. This becoming or „coming towards" (Zu-kommen) is man's proper „future" (Zu- kunft). (2) But what man ultimately becomes is that which he already and essentially is, his own aheadness or finitude, concretized in his dying. Here is the temporal dimension of „what-man-already-essentially-</page><page sequence="17">HEIDEGGERS TOPIC: EXCESS, RECESS, ACCESS 631 is" or more briefly, „alreadiness," Gewesenheit. The German word unites the meanings of „already being" {gewesen is the past participle of sein) and of „essence" (Wesen). This „alreadiness" is not a past which lies behind man (Vergangenheit), but an essential condition, always already operative, which structures his present and future. In that sense, „alreadiness" lies „in front of" man, along with the future, as a moment of his excess. The excess- dimension, therefore, is structured as a dynamic of possibility : becoming what one already is. As excess, it holds open the horizon within which man can „make present," or render accessible in meaning, the beings he meets. The structure of care (being ahead of oneself, already in a world, and among beings) finds its ground or meaning in the structure of temporality as self-tran- scendence. Human being is nothing other than this self-transcendence : letting things have access by becoming what one already is. Very roughly : EXCESS (becoming what one already essentially is) &lt; ACCESS (letting beings be meaningfully present) After SZ 1.2 had shown that primordial time is the unified structure of man's self-transcendence (and here it is called „temporality," Zeitlichkeit), the next but unpublished Division, 1.3, was going to specify and work out what was implicit in the foregoing, namely, that transcendence as excess-access forms the analogical unity of the in- telligibility of whatever is intelligible. In this horizonal function, primordial time is called the Temporalità or time-character of being- ness. But what is this „time" ? It is not the linear chonos (i.e., the number of motion according to before and after) which the West has known explicitly at least since Aristotle. For Heidegger, „time" is the more original movement constitutive of intelligibility, the kinesis whereby the domain of intelligibility is opened up. This unique movement is metabole^ the change-over {Umschlag) from something into something (ek tinos, eis ti), hence, the disclosure of the heretofore undisclosed. This movement, which is already found implicitly in the</page><page sequence="18">632 Thomas SHEENAN Pre-Socratic nations of aletheia and physis and which is echoed in Aristotle, is the dynamic structure of intelligibility as such, the e-vent or „coming-out* * of the meaningful presentness (disclosure) of anything at all, an event which happens only on the basis of man's appropriation unto excess. The e-vent of intelligibility (a-letheia) in its specifically kinetic structure (Ereignis) is the topic of Heidegger's thought. Therefore, Division 3 of Part I was to look away, as it were, from the excess-access structure of human being in order to focus on the movement of intelligibility itself in its analogical unity. Regardless of which kind of thing is revealed in its meaningful presence, the same process is at work. Just as in motion privativeness allows presentness (a moving being is present as moving only because it has not yet arrived at its essential completeness : Aristotle's energeia ateies), so likewise a meaningful being is present as what it is only on the basis of the private self-absence (excess) of man. We might speak of a „back- ground" which remains in the background (let us say, in „recess") in order that beings may emerge into the foreground of meaningfulness. Indeed, man's excess holds open that recessive background-dimmsion. The „connection" between excess and recess is what allows access. The early Heidegger will stress man's self-excess, as if this „pushed" open the horizon of intelligibility. The later Heidegger will rather stress that the horizon is already open and recessive, and that this is what evokes man's excess and allows access to beings. In both periods the topic is the same. The excess/recess-dimension is man's proper dimen- sion, he is appropriated unto it. In order properly to be what he already is, man must re-appropriate his excessive appropriation unto recess, not in the sense of overcoming and controlling it, but in the sense of accepting it as ever recessive. Only because he is already appropriated unto this excess/recess-dimension {Ereignis : the event of being appropriated unto absence) can man acquiesce in and become this condition and thus re-appropriate what he properly is, i.e., achieve „authenticity" (Eigentlichkeit : „properness"). To describe man's condition as appropriated unto the recess-dimension, Heidegger some-</page><page sequence="19">HEIDEGGERS TOPIC: EXCESS, RECESS, ACCESS 633 times speaks of man as „called forth" or „tuned in" or „drawn out." But of course there can be no hypostasizing of the recess-dimension as if it were someone or something that calls or tunes or draws. The receding is known only as it is registered in man's ineluctable exceeding of himself. The sameness of excess and recess is equally described as Ereignis and Enteignis : man's ownness consists in not being his own ; he is appropriated unto his own disappropriation. In Eliot's words, „And what you own is what you do not own / And where you are is where you are not" {East Coker, III). We may further specify the earlier diagram : EXCESS ACCESS RECESS &lt; » The unity of excess-recess on the one hand and access on the other is captured by the fundamental Greek noun aUtheia or verb aUtheuein. At the heart of those words is „recess" or „hiddenness" {lethe) - not a complete and absolute hiddenness, not a rithil absolutum, but a withdrawal which makes a „clearing" wherein and whereby beings can appear and be accessible. Compared with the presentness of beings, this dimension of withdrawal is an „absence," but an absence which is itself present in a unique way. As registered in and held open by man's excess (for example, in his being-towards-death), this absence is indeed experienced and hence is present, but in a way different from the presentness of accessible beings. We might say that it is present by calling man forth into his excess or self-absence. In short, it is present privately : presence-by-absence. This privative absence clears the arena for beings-in-their-beingness, the what-ness and how-ness of appearing things. The Greeks had already experienced aUtheia as the openness of beings without thematizing the let he- dimension (excess/recess) which renders that possible. Because this possibilizing dimension is intrinsically withdrawn or hidden (this is what Heidegger calls „the mystery," Geheimnis) , it lends itself to being „forgotten," even though it constitutes the essential withdrawnness of man himself. When it is</page><page sequence="20">634 Thomas SHEENAN forgotten, man finds himself „fallen in among beings-in-their-being- ness" (access) without being aware of the very dimension which allows that fallenness. The fact that metaphysics thematizes the beingness of beings does not break out of this fallenness but only reinforces it. To surpass metaphysics would mean to awaken to the authentic „place" (topos) within which metaphysics, and the every dayness which it thematizes, are embedded. Thus, Heidegger can adapt to his own purposes the protreptic which Aristotle enunciated : „It would be out-of -place (ato pon), then, if man were to choose not the life of his true self but that of something else" (Nie. Ethics, X, 7, 1178 a 3 f.). The call of conscience in SZ is precisely the call to that „place/1 to man's constitutive state of self-excess (or in the later language, to his being „called forth") as the arena for the presentness of beings. Heidegger's topic - which is this topos - now begins to come into focus in the various ways it was expressed. (1) In its earliest articulation, that topic was called the question of the meaning of beingness, and that meaning was thematized as the kinesis or time-character of beingness. Pres-ab-sence was seen as the appropriation of man unto excess so that access can happen. (2) Soon after, Heidegger called the topic the question of the „truth" of beingness. The focus there is not on the „truth" (meaningful disclosure) of beings - for beingness is that - but on the meaningful disclosure of the withdrawal-dimension or Entwurfbereich of beingness itself. That which is essentially operative in alëtheia is let hi itself, even though this /¿/¿¿-dimension recedes in favor of the beings which become manifest in their beingness. (3) In his later writings Heidegger speaks of the question of the place or topos of beingness. Here the pres-ab-sence which remains Heidegger's topic is called the „clearing" of the domain in which beings can be meaningfully present. Throughout these various expressions of the topic, Heidegger's effort remains the unifying task of a „topo-logy," a revelation of the topos of beingness. It would be illusory to think that Heidegger promised some sort of secular beatific vision, an intuitus esse qua esse in pure presentness. Because privative withdrawal is of the essence of the clearing, the task</page><page sequence="21">HEIDEGGERS TOPIC : EXCESS, RECESS, ACCESS 635 is not that of stripping negativity and absence from the clearing but rather the more difficult one of allowing the clearing its intrinsic hiddenness (lëthë). This requires an awakening from the forgottenness of this withdrawal, not so as to extinguish the recess, but so as to let oneself be drawn out into it. It is a matter of awakening from the forgottenness of withdrawal (= Irre) unto recollection of that with- drawal. Recollection of the „mystery" is awakening unto Ereignis. If the topic is essentially kinesis, presence-by-absence, then strictly speaking there is no „content' ' to the thought which is aware of the topic. There is only a „going- with-the-zè/wj/j," a being-underway. This is, in a fundamental sense, „method," but not in the usual sense of a technique or procedure for philosophical thinking. „Method* ' for Heidegger means „going- vAUi-kinèsis" (meta tèi hodõi} met-hodos). Thus, the topic and the pursuit of the topic are one and the same thing, what he once called „a great simplicity." 8 For Heidegger, „Alles ist Weg" 9 everything is a matter of the fundamental movement of excess-recess-access, which man already essentially „is." Therefore there is no method which could show us for the first time the topic of philosophy or lead us to the place of thought. For we are already there. The point is not to be led to the topic /topos but rather to remember what we already know and to become what we already are. In the words of the poet, We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time. 10 8.
