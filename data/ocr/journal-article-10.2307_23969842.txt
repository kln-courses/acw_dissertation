<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Incarnation. An Interdisciplinary Symposium on the Incar nation of the Son of God. Edited by Stephen T. Davis, Daniel Kendall, S J, and Gerald O' Collins, S J. Pp. xxv+404. Oxford University Press, 2002. isbn ο 19 924845 ι. £35. This is a symposium based on the pattern already established by the three authors for studies of the Trinity and the resurrection. The preface gives an overview of the volume, which follows on the debate about incarnation and myth. Gerald O'Collins poses in the opening chapter twelve central issues about incarnation. He raises the critical issues in a framework which suggests their amenability to classical solutions. There follow five chapters on the biblical roots of the doctrine of the incarnation. Andrew Dearman considers the Old Testament, focusing on the anthropomorphic presentation of God and the notion of the image of God. Tom Wright sees Jesus' self-understanding as the basic clue to incarnation in the New Testament. Gordon Fee re-examines Paul's Christology and Jean-Noel Aletti concentrates on Romans 8 as a basis for incarnation.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 851 There follows a patristic and medieval section, stressing the value of Chalcedon and of Aquinas' Christology for today. Alan Segal looks at incarnation in the categories of Judaism and Platonism. Sarah Coakley offers an interpretation of Chalcedon that both sets boundaries and is open to mystery. Brian Daley offers late patristic reflection on the personhood of Christ, and Eleonore Stump indicates the rich resources in Aquinas for coping with christological difficulties. In a philosophical section, Stephen Davies offers a robust defence of the rationality of incarnation, and Stephen Evans gives a contemporary account of kenosis which deals with the most recent objections. Brian Leftow argues for the compat ibility of incarnation and timelessness. The final papers extend the discussion of incarnation further. Linda Zagzebski develops a fascinating framework for an exemplarist virtue theory of ethics based on Christology. David Brown discusses the representation of the humanity and divinity of Christ in twentieth-century art, and Margaret Shuster explores the handling of incarnation in Christmas sermons. The strength of this volume lies in the high quality of the arguments presented, and in the commonality of basic belief among the symposiasts. There is little here, for example, of the tradition of Schleiermacher or of the emancipatory theologies. It will be unlikely to persuade critics of traditional doctrines of incarnation, but it succeeds in demonstrating that a comprehen sive rational case for the orthodox tradition can still be made, and remains a significant element of inter-Christian dialogue. It would be interesting to imagine whether a much more pluralist summit could move things forward a stage further. G. M. Newlands G. M. Newlands</page></plain_text>
