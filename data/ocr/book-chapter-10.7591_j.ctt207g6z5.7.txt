<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> C H A P T E R  4  Unmasking the Masquerade:  Fetishism and Femininity from the  Goncourt Brothers to Joan Riviere  The feminist ideology of the masquerade and the Freudian  ·  discourse of fetishism could hardly be more antithetical on first  consideration. The former, as constituted by Luce Irigaray, Michele  Montrelay, Mary Ann Doane, and Judith Butler, in response to  Joan Riviere's pivotal essay "Womanliness as a Masquerade" ( 1 929) ,   aims a t  a destabilization of  masculinist psychoanalysis, whereas the  latter in its vivid imaging of castration anxiety qualifies as one of  Freud's most explicitly phallocentric essays . And yet, the masquer­ ade and fetishism in their shared dependency on the lexicon of  phallic surrogation prove to be curiously compatible at specific  theoretical junctures. Both theories may be characterized in terms  of a defensive posture toward the symbolic order of castration, and  both articulate surrogation in a language of veils, prosthetic ap­ pendages, and sexual travesty.  In addition to examining the rather strange points at which  femininity and fetishism, or feminism and psychoanalysis, dovetail,  collide, and mutually refract (nodes where patriarchal Freudianism  loses a measure of its phallocentrism, moments where feminist  theory confronts some of its own theoretical inconsistencies and  lacunae) ,  this study of sartorial language in the Goncourt brothers  and Baron Octave Uzanne also entails an engagement with what  Joan Copjec has provocatively termed the female "sartorial super­ ego." Beginning with an investigation of mid-nineteenth-century  idioms of fashion, material culture, and female consumerism, I  want to experiment with grounding a feminist ontology of feminin- 65  </page> <page sequence="2"> 66 Feminizing the Fetish  ity in the constructions, both erotic and social, of a certain kind of  Verkl.eidungstrieb ("will to dress," "sartorial drive") or clothing fetishism. 1  The debate over the impossibly vexed question What is feminini­ ty? seems more rather than less elusive with each new attempt  within psychoanalysis and feminism to theorize the female subject.  In the late twenties and early thirties many important women  psychoanalysts endeavored to extend or challenge Freud's writings  on femininity Ueanne Lampl-de-Groot, Helen Deutsch, Ruth Mack­ Brunswick, Marie Bonaparte, Karen Horney, Joan Riviere , to men­ tion only the most well known) , but successive generations would  find even the more unorthodox among them too timid when it  came to articulating female sexuality as something other than a  second-best version of its masculine counterpart. Though since the  thirties the validity of femininity as a category for understanding the  feminine has become increasingly the target of skepticism, there has  also been a concern to preserve the history of its representations.  With a rather curious consistency, nineteenth-century authors  strategically retrieved representations of eighteenth-century wom­ an, projecting her as fiction,  fixture, and even fetish of the femi­ nine. In the Goncourt brothers' La Femme au dix-huitieme siecle and  in the fashion writing of Octave Uzanne, literary portraits of  eighteenth-century libertinage and sartorial pomp are often used  to praise and at the same time to pathologize (implicitly) a high  culture of flirtation, seduction, and masquerade. These writings  provide an interesting illustration of how one century's reading of  another leads to epistemological shifts or new developments within  adjacent disciplines, demonstrating, specifically, how the nineteenth  century's reading of eighteenth-century woman created a vision of  femininity that in turn passed into early psychoanalysis .  As in the case of "cabinet fiction," an important microgenre of  nineteenth-century literature may be defined in the Goncourts'  proleptically New Historical reconstruction of eighteenth-century  feminine culture. Coining the expression "elegant reality" (la realite  elegante) for a descriptive mode devoted to foregrounding "the  pretty" and "distinguished" detail , Edmond de Goncourt matched  style to content in his examination of what he called [Cminilite. 2  1 .

Similarly Uzanne, a kind of "lesser Goncourt"  in his literary career, made a point of resuscitating the terms feminie  (roughly, all that falls in the domain of woman : beauty, ornament,  love) and femmenie (accenting la femme herself as circulating tempta­ tion [poupee d'Eros] within the Gallic "commerce of gallantry") from  the neglected pages of Littre's dictionary.3 Uzanne's texts on "les  artifices de la beaute" equally constitute a distinctive genre in which  metonymies of costume, natural physique, and attitude coalesce in  an eroticized sentimental prose. Here the mimological rhetorical  conventions by which fin-de-siecle writers represented feminine  narcissism, worldliness, and display are clearly placed in view. By  focusing on a genre that might be called (after the Goncourts)  elegant realism, we can clarify the history of gender cliches and  better understand. its imprint on psychoanalytical assumptions.  Jules and Edmond de Goncourt were far more notorious for their  virulently misogynistic view of the female species, which they placed  on a par with the animal order in the evolutionary chain, than for  any sympathetic investigation of womanliness. Novels such as Germinie  Lacerteux ( 1 865) or Manette Saloman ( 1 867) capitalized on sensation­ al illustrations of the insatiable sexual urges of women. And as  Elisabeth Badinter has shown, the Journal was equally replete with  depictions of women psychically enslaved to their physical morphol­ ogies and bodily functions .

As naturalist writers who lingered over the most scrofulous  particulars of disease, the Goncourts not only contributed to the  general nineteenth-century medicalization of eighteenth-century  literature but they also pathologized the much-trumpeted libertin­ age of ancien-regime aristocrats . To the debauchery indulged in by  ladies of noble station the Goncourts attributed a psychopathology  of emptiness ,  ennui, vapors, hypochondria, hysteria, and what they  referred to as "a kind of intellectual libertinage [une sorte de libertin­ age de pensees]" (F 3 1 6) .  In brief, as their posthumous reception  bears out, a prudish but no less prurient habit of diagnosing the  consequences of promiscuity informed their historical panoramas,  even at the risk of placing their idealized vision of the ancien  regime in jeopardy.  Despite the fact that Madame du Barry, Madame de Pompadour,  and Marie Antoinette had set redoubtable examples of licentiousness  before the populace, the Goncourts' documentation of the eighteenth­ century aristocrat, with her cultivated mien and seductive allure,  afforded some kind of narrative reprieve from their characteristi­ cally gynophobic vituperation. As Juliette Adam, one of the few  women spared their contempt, would write : "The Goncourts so  loved and frequented eighteenth-century women that they despised  the women of the nineteenth . . . c onsigning them to wickedness,  debauchery or imbecility."5 Published in 1 862 , La Femme au dU:­ huitieme siecle marks the culmination of a series of works by the  Goncourt brothers dedicated to the nostalgic recuperation of ancien­ regime political and aesthetic values . Histoire de la societe fran&lt;;aise  pendant la Revolution et pendant le Directoire had appeared in 1 854,   Histoire de Marie-Antoinette in 1 858 ,  portions of /;Art au diJ&lt;:-huitieme  siecle in 1 859,  and Les Maftresses de Louis XV in 1 860. In this fruitful  period of a collaboration that critics unfailingly describe as incestu­ ous , they elaborated an ideal of feminine beauty, charm, and even  intelligence matched by a prose style at once frothy and rhetorically  fetishistic.  In this context, the expression rhetorical fetishism refers to the taste  for epithet, mannered syntax, and tropes of hyperbole and accu­ mulation commonly used by the Goncourts to render the codes of  feminilite. As in the language of fetishization, whereby the verbal  substitute for the phallic referent is reified to the point where its  5.

Une langue d'extase et d'exclamations, une langue qui escalade Jes  superlatifs ,  entre clans la langue franc;:aise et apporte l'enflure a sa  sobriete . On ne parle plus que de graces sans nombres, de perfections sans  fin. A la moindre fatigue, on est aneanti; au moindre contre-temps, on  est desespere, on est obsede prodigieusement, on est suffoque. Desire-t'on une  chose? On est folle a perdre le boire et le manger. Un homme deplait-il? C'est  un homme a Jeter par !es fenetres. A-t-on la graine? on est d'une sottise  rebutante. On applaudit a tout rompre, on loue a outrance, on aime a  miracle. Et cette fievre des expressions ne suffit pas ; pour etre une  femme "parfaitement usagee", ii est necessaire de zezayer, de moduler,  d'attendrir et d'effeminer sa voix, de prononcer, au lieu de pigeons et de  choux, des pizons et ces soux.  Astonis_hing! miraculous! divine! these are the common epithets of (wom­ an's) chatter. An idiom of ecstasy and exclamations that goes beyond  superlatives, enters the French language and brings turgidity to its  sobriety. One speaks only of infinite charms, of endless perfections. At the  slightest fatigue, one is reduced to nothing; at the slightest contretemps,  one is in despair, one is prodigiously obsessed, one is suffocated. Does she  desire something? She is crazed to the point of bringing up herf ood and drink .  A man displeases her? He is a man to be thrown out the window. Has she  gone to seed? She is revoltingly stupid. She applauds to breaking point, she  praises to the limit, she loves miraculously. And even this fever of expres­ sions is not enough : to be a woman "perfectly in the know," it is  necessary to lisp, to inflect, to soften, and to effeminize one's voice, to  say in the place of pigeons and cabbage, "pizons" and "soux." (F 7 1 ;  authors'  italics)  Here it is perhaps no accident that the paradigm of feminine  speech is predicated on error (of pronunciation)-for the discourse  of womanliness seems destined to the regime of surrogation.  The Goncourts complemented this rhetorical fetishism with a  more clinical fetishization of the female body typically found in the  work of eighteenth-century authors. Their portrait of eighteenth­ century woman often derived from writers such as Marivaux,  Rousseau, and Retif de la Bretonne. From the world of Marivaux's  La Vie de Marianne, with its titillating scenes of sartorial strategy in  </page> <page sequence="6"> 70 Feminizing the Fetish  love, they took inspiration for the theme of the mask.6 A device of  dupery designating the veiling of ulterior motives in the game of  love through skillful manipulation of multiple visages, marivaudage  was treated as the ensign of phallic woman. Like painters preparing  fastidious physiognomical and characterological studies for each  genre of feminine beauty (and reinforcing this technique with  constant allusions to Boucher, Fragonard, and Watteau), the Goncourts  developed prototypes of the eighteenth-century seductress. As a  fleshy, bovine, Venus evolves through the century, imperiled by the  "orgies of the Palais-Royal," only to reemerge under the brushstrokes  of Boucher as a smirking nymph, she is evoked as "le masque de ses  amours [the mask of her loves]" (F 254) .  The marivaudage of the  feminine facial mask, at least in rather simplistic Freudian terms,  suggests an artful incognito designed to prolong the male viewer's  distraction from the absorbing prospect of a hypothetical female  phallus. 7 Evoking Marivaux again in a manner that strikingly  foreshadows the twentieth-century psychoanalytical debate on the  masquerade, the Goncourts identified eighteenth-century woman's  ultimate refinement as the ability to appear as if she were no  longer wearing a mask:  "She can say : that's how nature made me.  What she will leave visible, as if by negligence or oversight, will have  the irritating charm of a modest, veiled copy of the original; and  the veil that she preserves is so light, so transparent, that it hardly  creates a barrier to the male imagination" (F 270) . In the qualifiers  "comme par negligence" and "qu'il ne sera presque pas un obstacle,"  the psychosexual innuendos of veiling (as in Nietzsche) shine through;  woman masquerades as essential femininity ("telle que la nature  m'a faite") ,  but her essentialism is only a more invisible form of the  mask.8  6. The roster of theoretical voices contributing to the philosophical treatments of  the mask is long. From phenomenological and anthropological analyses (elaborated  in the 1 940s and 1 950s by Roland Kuhn, Georges Buraud, Gaston Bachelard , and  the early Foucault) to Derrida and Lacan's post-Nietzschean interpretations of the  veil as trope of the woman's phallic prevarication and its feminist critique (Jacqueline  Rose, Gayatri Spivak, Mary Ann Doane) there have been seemingly endless  reappropriations of this discourse .  7. It is this aleatory technique of delay without consummation that Roland  Barthes would assign to marivaudage in his Fragments d'un discours amoureux: "To speak  amorously is to expend without an end in sight, without a crisis ; it is to practice a  relation without orgasm. There may exist a literary form of this coitus reservatus:  what we call Marivaudage" (Barthes , A Lover's Discourse, trans. Richard Howard  [New York: Hill and Wang, 1 978), p.  73 .   8 .  The use of the veil as  a metaphor for womanliness and philosophy alike has  been a recurrent theme in the discourses of deconstruction and feminism. From  </page> <page sequence="7"> Unmasking the Masquerade 7 I  If Marivaux captured the ethic of falsity implicit in the feminine  masquerade and Rousseau epitomized the cult worship of erotic  synecdoche (from the stolen ribbon to the famous deformed nip­ ple) , it was nevertheless Retif de la Bretonne who most influenced  their portrayal of femininity. Like no other writer he appreciated  the inherently fetishistic nature of the prosthetic appendages fa­ vored by eighteenth-century fashion. 9 Many of his texts sexualized  the extremities of the female anatomy and its sartorial extrusions :  corsets, crinolines, and, most especially, shoes. In his novella Un Joli  Pied, for example, the elegant shoe completely upstages the charms  of its wearer:  Elle s'assit et posa son joli pied sur une chaise , de sorte qu'on le voyait  en entier. Rien de si charmant clans la nature par sa petitesse, par la  grace et !'elegance de sa chaussure : c'etait un soulier de couleur puce  brode et garni d'un cordonnet en argent sur Jes coutures ;  le talon mince  etait assez haut, mais place de maniere qu'il ne faisait pas refouler le  pied ; la forme par devant etait la plus mignonne qu'on puisse voir.  Saintepallaie etait hors de lui-meme.  She sat down and placed her pretty foot on a chair, so that one could  see the whole foot. Nothing in nature was ever so charmingly small,  graceful, and elegant as her shoe ; it was footwear of puce brocade  garnished with silver braid along the seams; the thin heel was quite  high, but placed so as not to compress the foot; the shape in front was  the most adorable sight imaginable. Saintepallaie was beside himself. 1 0  Passages of this kind furnished the Goncourts with conceits for  rendering the psychology of fashion. As they built up a language of  libidinously charged vestimentary details in La Femme au dix-huitieme  siecle they cited Retifs Le Pied de Fanchette:  Nous entrons clans le regne des artistes en tout genre, des modistes de  genie, aussi bien que des cordonniers sublimes, uniques pour monter un  pied et le faire valoir, lui donner la petitesse, la grace, la tournure, la  "lestete" si vantee, si goutee , si souvent chantee par le dix-huitieme  siecle, le je ne sais quoi enfin de ce pied de Mme Leveque, la marchande  Nietzsche to Derrida, Luce Irigaray, and Gayatri Spivak a genealogical discussion  can be traced, culminating in Spivak's notion of the "feminization of philosophizing."  9. The Goncourts used Rousseau as an exemplar of hyperbolic sentimental  display, localized in passionate attachments to feminine bagatelles (we have only to  recall the famous episode of the stolen ribbon).  10 .

At this point we enter into the realm of art in every sphere, from the  couturier of genius to those sublime shoemakers, unique in their ability  to raise up and thereby enhance the foot, endowing it with the smallness,  grace, shape, and "lightness" so celebrated and enjoyed , so lyrically  praised by the eighteenth century; it was this ''.je ne sais quoi" of the foot  of Mme Leveque (a silk merchant in the town of Lyon) that inspired  Retifs Foot of Fanchette. (F 2 75)  Ultimately one might argue that the Goncourts' reading of Retif  allows us to supplant the notion of mask with the modern figure of  construction, and here we mean to literalize the Foucauldian (and  now feminist) figure of social construction so as to designate the  actual props, cages, stays, and struts appertaining to the eighteenth­ century female body.  It is of course the extravagant, preposterous coiffure that consti­ tuted the most familiar cliche associated with the period. The full  symbolism of mounted piles of hair, as prolongation of the female  body and verbal constellation of fetishistic signs, is, however, less  well understood . As Chantal Thomas has recently remarked in her  analysis of the names for hair fashions popularized by Marie  Antoinette and her followers , "the coiffeur not only had to have the  talent of an architect, he also had to show himself capable of  chronicling the daily news." 1 1  La Femme au dix-huitieme siecle offers an  exhaustive glossary of what the Goncourts referred to as "!es  coiffures parlantes" (speaking hairstyles) , from "le pouf au senti­ ment," in which strands of hair from deceased loved ones were  interwoven; to "Jes coiffures a !'insurgent," commemorating seismic  political events ; to "la coiffure a la Dauphine," an image of gender  crossover with its phallic resemblance to une queue de paon, or  "peacock's tail" (F 282-87) .  Instead of signifying a timeless, essen­ tial femininity, which may have been what the Goncourts wished to  evoke, the exaggerated coiffures of the eighteenth-century French  noblewoman disclosed the historically commodifying conditions of  her erotic construction, one that was, of course, essentially nine­ teenth century in its character and function.  In the section of his Passagen-Werk on fashion, Walter Benjamin  claimed that it was hard to find a more erotic fetish than the  i 1 .  Chantal Thomas, La Reine scelerate (Paris: Seuil , i 989), p. 88.  </page> <page sequence="9"> Unmasking the Masquerade 73  enhanced head of hair, which, in its negotiation between the dead  realm of inert consumer artifacts and the enticing, animated do­ main of sexual stimulants , fostered a psychoanalytical mediation of  material culture and gender differentiation. He gave the example  of the multiple erotic significations that were "dissimulated" be­ neath the feminine hat. As opposed to the strict political codes of  rigidly typified male headgear, women's hats suggested infinite  possibilities of meaning beyond the simple symbolization of the  sexual organs. Thus, he noted the peculiarly mimetic agency of  the capote, a form of bonnet contemporary with the crinoline : "The  wide brims of the capote are turned up, in this way suggesting how  one should turn up the crinoline so that the man might the more  easily have sexual relations with the woman." 1 2 This penchant for  an eroticism of the retrousse, or "turned up," was turned inward in  the case of the corset, described by Benjamin as a passage for the  torso (a kind of Passagen-Werk of the female anatomy). 1 3 The corset,  Benjamin claimed, was a particularly freighted signifier for nineteenth­ century eroticism, for it gave off the aura of the renferme (closed-in)  associated with clandestine prostitution.  Anticipating Benjamin, the Goncourts dismantled the apparent  eroticism of coiffure, corset, and crinoline. Consider, for example,  their rendering of a panier :  Cette toilette, avec son incroyable deploiement de jupe, represente le  panier dans l'ampleur, la grandeur, l'enormite de son developpment. Le  panier que !es princesses de sang vont bientot porter si large qu'il leur  faudra un tabouret vide a cote d'elles , le panier commence a grandir sur  le modele des paniers de deux dames anglaises venues en France en  1 7 1 4 ;  et chaque annee ii est devenue plus usite, plus exagere, plus  extravagant. I I  s'est etoffe de fac;:on a couvrir Jes grossesses de la  Regence : ii s'est repandu par toute la France comme un masque de  debauche ,  pendant ces jours de folie.  This dress, with its incredible unfolding of the skirt, represents the  hoop in its full amplitude, grandeur, and monstrosity. Worn so wide  that princesses of noble birth soon needed an empty stool beside them,  modeled after a petticoat sported by two English women who came to  France in 1 7 14 ;  this panier has each year become progressively wide- 1 2 .

Upholstered to disguise the  pregnancies of the Regency, the panier spread all over France like a  mask of debauchery during these days of folly. (F 26 1-62)  In this image of a furnished feminine persona (identified as  "debauchery's mask") ,  all traces of seduction are forfeited . As the  beaux-arts critic Charles Blanc argued in a section of his aesthetic  analysis of women's fashion,  �Art dans la parure et dans le vetement  (Art in Adornment and Dress) ,  this eighteenth-century fondness for  amplitude ultimately defeated its purpose, calling femininity's bluff  by revealing its attempt at empowerment through sartorial bulk :  To exaggerate width would be to run counter to the proposed end, it  would be to miss the goal by overstepping it ;  because excess ,  which can  only be produced by an increase of size, would end in spreading out the  figure and overwhelming it, unless in order to balance the enlargement  of the figure that puffs and paniers would give it, a structure of curls  and feathers were erected on the head, like those worn by the Princesse  de Lamballe and Marie Antoinette during the reign of powder. 14  Like the oversized falbala, constricting corset, or spiky, totemic hair  ornament, the panier afforded a caricature of mythic femininity. In  the spread of the woman's hips, merging with the footstool used to  prop up her volumnious skirts , femininity seems to evaporate by  virtue of its overly emphasized materialization. Again and again, in  their representations of eighteenth-century fashion, the brothers  called attention to the charade of femininity by highlighting the  structural supports and surface drapery sustaining and simultaneously  exposing the illusion of a swollen,  imperious, expansive , incorpo­ rating female body. In contrast to the nineteenth-century body­ that pert, coquettish, curvaceous female form that, as Debora  Silverman has recently observed, became embedded as a design  motif in the art-nouveau furniture and interiors that the Goncourts  helped to anticipate-this eighteenth-century body defied domesti­ cation .  15 This is of course probably why the Goncourts seemed so  1 4 .

'1\.rchaeologists of material culture," as Debora Silverman has described  them, the Goncourts distinguished themselves as masters at creating a rhetoric of  plasticity and texture-upholstery, drapery, lacquer-which both feminized domestic  artifacts and literalized woman as material construction. "La mode" is portrayed as  the "furniture" of women's bodies, an extensive "frame" that inadvertently demystifies  the masquerade of womanliness in its nomenclature. Silverman has noted , "the  </page> <page sequence="11"> Unmasking the Masquerade 7 5  intent on denaturalizing its impression-the obviousness of femi­ nine artifice (as in Baudelaire's aesthetic of maquillage) guarantees  the failure of an autonomous (nonpatriarchal) definition of femininity.  But there are risks in underscoring the feminine mask, for this  exposed transparency of artifice also reveals the extent to which  masculinity relies for its own mythic gender on a contrivance of  gender in the opposite sex. As Judith Butler has observed, mascu­ linity is equally vulnerable to the masquerade critique, especially  when it is "taken on by the male homosexual who, presumably,  seeks to hide-not from others, but from himself, an ostensible  femininity." 1 6  This over-exposed quality of the gender masquerade  serves to explain why the Goncourts' gongoristic idiom of eighteenth­ century fashion occasionally seems to come undone much in the  way that their social snobbery and bourgeois monarchism appear to  be undercut by their moving fictional portraits of exploited working­ class women. Ostentatious articles of clothing rendered with color­ ful adjectives or meticulously matched to fascimiles of feminine  speech patterns come apart at unexpected moments in their texts ,  revealing a latent instability of sexual identity. In Les Ma/tresses de  Louis XV, for example, they described "la Pompadour" appointed  as Venus in a gown of metallic blue. The way in which the train of  her dress aspires to phallic stiffness serves to overlay a masculine  persona on the feminine frame :  Elle etait la mere des Amours , Venus elle-meme, clans un habit de  mosai:que d'argent, festonne de taffetas peint, chenille d'argent et bleu,  frange d'argent, et trainant avec la majeste d'un manteau royal une  grande queue d'etoffe bleue a mosai:que d'argent.  She was the mother of Love, Venus herself, attired in a mosaic of silver,  festooned with painted taffeta, wrapped around in silver and blue ,  Goncourts clarified how the rococo interior was inseparable from its female identity,  for the Louis XV style moderne was initiated to oppose the grand gout of Louis XIV  with the ethos of la grace, a petite, amorous, and explicitly female form. . . . F urniture  with anthropomorphic female names multiplied : la causeuse, 'the chatterer' ; la  bergere, 'the shepherdess' ; la chifof nniere, 'the dresser' ; la marquise brisee, 'the divided  marquise' ; la chaise a la reine; la chaise longue; and especially la toilette. The feminiza­ tion of rococo furnishings culminated here, as toilette named both the small dressing  table for women and the art of women's preparation of their bodies for display" (Art  Nouveau in Fin-de-Siecle France: Politics, Psychology, and Style [Berkeley : University of  California Press, 1 989] , pp. 27-28) .   1 6.

All metamorphoses suit this beauty, as they do the gods of Fable ;  and  tomorrow may she shed the raiment of Versailles for a hunting costume ;  may she don masculine dress with a large, English-lace collar encircling  her bared throat; may she wear her hair straight, and may there be two  or three patches thrown here and there on a face that speaks unruli­ ness : she will be a Venus of the hunt. 1 8  Commentators on cross-dressing have often insisted that men's  clothing when worn by women only enhances the spectacle of  femininity. In this case, however, it would seem that Madame du  Barry has so entered the spirit of her travesty that her character, in  its forcefulness and projection of a predatory will , attests to some  kind of veritable sex change.  In their portrait of Marie Antoinette the Goncourts took this  gender ambivalence yet a step further, obliquely associating the  scandal of the Diamond Necklace Affair (in which the queen was  implicated in a conspiracy to buy one of the most valuable jewels in  France for resale on the black market) with the stony dazzle of  Marie Antoinette's character, and discerning a natural disposition  to power in the queen's body.

In a paper entitled "Adorning Marie-Antoinette" (delivered a t  the Modern  Language Association annual meeting, Washington, D.C. ,  December 27 ,  1 989),  Pierre Saint-Amand described the way in which the masquerade of the royal  </page> <page sequence="13"> Unmasking the Masquerade 77  age ("as if made for the throne," according to Madame de Polignac)  and the way in which her blond hair settles on her head like an  organic crown ("le diademe d'or pale de ses cheveux blonds")  suggest a subliminal monarchism-an overdetermined will to rule­ that decided1y corroborates the female sovereign's primordial  masculinity. 20  In La Femme au dix-huitieme siecle the Goncourts gave this transves­ tite female ruling class a globally imperialist socioeconomic status,  attributing the French fashion industry's "domination" and "seduction"  of Europe to the Frenchwoman's ingenuity and exigence in the  field of frippery : "all of Europe is under the sway of our fashions"  (F 2 74) .  A patriarchal tendency to export culture and conquer  markets is here imputed to the lady skilled in feminine wiles.  Finally, in an astonishing passage framed in the context of a  political allegory equating the demise of the aristocracy with female  empowerment, the same creature who passes for the consummate  embodiment of feminine charm is also unmasked as a paragon of  malen'ess :  Cette influence, cette domination sans exemple, cette souverainete de  droit presque divin, a quoi faut-il l 'attribuer? Ou en est la clef et  l'explication? La femme du dix-huitieme siecle dut-elle seulement sa  puissance aux qualites propres de son sexe, aux charmes de sa nature,  aux seductions habituelles de son etre? La dut-elle absolument a son  temps, a la mode humaine, a ce regne du plaisir qui lui apporta le  pouvoir clans un baiser et la fit commander a tout, en commandant a  l'amour? Sans doute, la femme tira de ses graces de tous les temps, du  milieu et des dispositions particulieres de son siecle, une force et une  facilite naturelles d'autorite . . . . I I  y a dans toutes ces physionomies la  resolution et l 'eclair d'une idee virile, une profondeur dans la mutinerie  meme, je ne sais quoi de pensant et de pen;:ant, ce melange de l'homme  et de la femme d'etat dont vous retrouverez Jes traits jusque sur Ia  figure d'une comedienne, de la Sylvia . . . .   persona was in a sense extended, hardened, and further materialized in the  narcissistically erotic space of Trianon. Saint-Amand writes, "Theater, balls, fashion  shows, Trianon was a seductive paradise. Everything was constructed in order to  reflect back the queen's image to herself. Mirrors were everywhere, and more were  put in at night to mask the windows. The space was saturated with ornamentation."

This influence, this domination without example, this sovereignty of near  divine right, to what must it be attributed? Where is the key to the  explanation? Did eighteenth-century woman owe her power solely to the  innate qualities of her sex, to the charms of her nature, to the habitual  seductions of her being? Or did she owe it exclusively to her epoch, to  the fashion, to the reign of pleasure that brought her power in a kiss  and allowed her to rule everything in ruling love? Without a doubt,  woman will draw from the graces of every century, from the milieu and  particular temperaments of her age, a strength and a natural facility for  authority. . . .  In all these physiognomies, there is the clarity and resolu­ tion of a virile idea, a profundity even in rebelliousness, an "I  don't  know what" of perspicuity and thoughtfulness, this mixture of the man  and woman of state that you can trace through to the features of the  actress Sylvia . . . .   Put the portraits aside, open up history : the genius of the eighteenth­ century woman will never give the lie to this physiognomy. You will see it  take over the largest roles, grow bigger, become, through application,  study, and sheer force of will ,  male enough, or at the very least, serious  enough, to explain, and legitimate, even its most astonishing and  scandalous usurpations. (F 294--95)  This masculine face stamped indelibly on period physiognomies of  women, this "scandalous" propensity to usurp male prerogative,  this fundamental commutability of femininity and masculinity, ulti­ mately implies that there is absolutely no fixed sociopolitical basis  for sexual difference. Woman's social construction is revealed as  just that : no more than an evanescent agglomeration of codes and  commonplaces , no less than a materially ornamental construct that  gives narcissistic pleasure to the female subject by enhancing her  body in her own eyes .  Half a century later Proust would render this idea in one of his  portraits of Swann's mistress . Odette emerges as an impossible  construction, for she is made from clumsy sheaths and unadhering  parts. In the gaping seams of her mechanical body, we glimpse the  emptiness of her feminine essence :  II faut d'ailleurs dire que le visage d'Odette paraissait plus maigre et  </page> <page sequence="15"> Unmasking the Masquerade 79  plus proeminent parce que le front et le haut des joues, cette surface  unie et plus plane etait recouverte par la masse de cheveux qu'on portait  alors prolonges en "devants'', souleves en "crepes", repandus en meches  folles le long des oreilles ;  et quant a son corps qui etait admirablement  fait, ii etait difficile d'en apercevoir la continuite (a cause des modes de  I'epoque et quoiqu'elle filt une des femmes de Paris qui s'habillaient le  mieux), tant le corsage, s'avam;:ant en saillie comme sur un ventre  imaginaire et finissant brusquement en pointe pendant que par en  dessous commenc;:ait a s'enfler le ballon des doubles jupes, donnait a la  femme !'air d'etre composee de pieces differentes ma! emmanchees !es  unes dans Jes autres; tant Jes ruches, Jes volants, le gilet suivaient en  toute independance, selon la fantaisie de leur dessin ou la consistence  de leur etoffe, la Iigne qui Jes conduisait aux noeuds, aux bouillons de  dentelle, aux effiles de jais perpendiculaires, ou qui Jes dirigeait le long  du busc, mais ne s'attachaient nullement a I'etre vivant, qui selon que  !'architecture de ces fanfreluches se rapprochait ou s'ecartait trop de la  sienne, s'y trouvait engonce ou perdu.  I t  must be remarked that Odette's face appeared thinner and more  prominent than it actually was, because her forehead and the upper  part of the cheeks, a single and almost plane surface, were covered by  the masses of hair which women wore at that period, drawn forward in  a fringe, raised in crimped waves and falling in stray locks over her ears ;  while as for her figure, and she was admirably built, it was impossible to  make out its continuity (on account of the fashion then prevailing, and  in spite of her being one of the best-dressed women in Paris) for the  corset, jetting forwards in an arch, as though over an imaginary stom­ ach , and ending in a sharp point, beneath which bulged out the balloon  of her double skirts, gave a woman, that year, the appearance of being  composed of different sections badly fitted together; to such an extent  did the frills, the flounces, the inner bodice follow, in complete inde­ pendence, controlled only by the fancy of their designer or the rigidity  of their material, the line which led them to the knots of ribbon,  falls of  lace, fringes of vertically hanging jet, or carried them along the bust,  but nowhere attached themselves to the living creature, who, according  as the architecture of their fripperies drew them towards or away from  her own,  found herself either straitlaced to suffocation or else completely  buried .2 1  2 1 .

What is brought to the  fore by the Goncourt brothers' masculinized representation of  eighteenth-century femininity is the extent to which this undecidability  was featured all along in the culturally endorsed clothing fetishism  of an entire epoch. La Femme au dix-huitieme siecle leads, one could  say, to a reappraisal of vestimentary female fetishism and its hither­ to suppressed connections to masquerade.  Interestingly enough, it was Freud who inaugurated this under­ taking in a little-known lecture delivered to the Vienna Psychoana­ lytic Society in 1 909. Going against the conventional ban on female  fetishists , he suggested that "all women . . . a re clothes fetishists"  because fashion ,  by magnetizing the gaze, both represses and  de-represses a woman's desire to show herself:  In the world of everyday experience, we can observe that half of  humanity must be classed among the clothes fetishists. All women, that  is, are clothes fetishists . Dress plays a puzzling role in them. It is a  question again of the repression of the same drive , this time, however,  in the passive form of allowing oneself to be seen,  which is repressed by  clothes, and on account of which, clothes are raised to a fetish.  Only  now we understand why even the most intelligent women behave  defenselessly against the demands of fashion. For them, clothes take the  place of parts of the body, and to wear the same clothes means only to  be able to show what the others can show, means only that one can find  in her everything that one can expect from women.23  2 2 .

The female superego (or to defer  again to Joan Copjec's expression, the "sartorial superego") that  emerges assimilates fetishism into narcissism and in the process  takes away many of narcissism's pejorative connotations.24  Copjec's notion of the sartorial superego (derived from J. C .   Flugel's 1 930 classic The Psychology of Clothes and applied to the  functionalist ethics of dress codes in the modern age, particularly as  they appertain to that curtailing of male display that Flugel calls  'The Great Masculine Renunciation") invites us to consider the  "low" culture of fashion writing (along with its massive upsurge in  consumer appeal in the fin de siecle) as the source of an ethic of  womanliness as masquerade. Though Flugel applied the term to an  ascetic turn in dressing rather than to appanages of decadent  display, one could say that in the high pageantry and "exotic  magnificence" that Flugel emphasized in eighteenth-century cos­ tume there was a ceremonial aura approaching religious decorousness.  Paradoxically, puritanical dress codes shared with ancien-regime  splendor a general tendency to subordinate the human body itself.  As Flugel noted : "during the period of artificiality that distin­ guished the eighteenth century, the body was largely to serve as a  support for gorgeous clothes."25 This anaclitic, purely supportive  social body describes, on the one hand, the dependency of the  female masquerader on a masculine social gaze that mandates  subordination of the female body, but on the other, it prepares the  ground for redefining the notion of "support" as an anchoring,  stabilizing ontology for the female subject, what Flugel called "the  extension of the bodily self." The latter option might allow us to  reread fashion writing not as a genre of egregiously reductive  female typecasting but as the literary support structure of a critical  femininity.  One of the most adept and prolific devotees of the genre was, of  course, Octave Uzanne, whose apostrophes to muffs, gloves, para­ sols, and the fan so delighted the public that, to his consternation,  24.

Uzanne situated himself in a line of "women's" poets famous for  privileging rhetorical preciosity over concision and pith :  Le style compact du savant ou de l'archeologue ne convient guere a un  sujet oil Jes graces seules doivent regner, ou un poete ami de la femme,  un Ovide, un Petrarque, un Musset ou un Swinburne trouvait assurement  d'assez subtils vocables pour traduire la pensee clans une forme exquise.  The compact style of the scholar and archeologist hardly suits a subject  on which only the graces should reign supreme, only poets such as  Ovid, Petrarch, Musset, or Swinburne, true friends of woman, find  vocables sufficiently subtle to translate the idea of so exquisite a form.28  Fashion, he vehemently insisted , was woman's only "literature" and  he himself the only true "historian" of this art form. The names of  clothes were in themselves poetic vocables (''The muff!" he exclaimed.  " It's name alone has something adorable, downy, and voluptuous  about it.")29 Uzanne described new outfits ("costumes inedits") as  unpublished masterpieces , avenues for fantasy and escape for the  imagination, subjects over which women argued and "epilogued." If  in some instances he applied the language of textuality to fashion,   26. In his preface to  a new edition of  Les Omements de la femme (Paris: Librairies  Imprimeries Reunies, 1 892) ,  originally published in 1 882 ,  Uzanne complains that he  was henceforth referred to exclusively as ")'Auteur de l'Eventail" (the author of the  Fan) .   27 .

[Oh ! those divine close-fitting chemises, frilled with wide  lace collars, how they plunged the spirit into a disquieting obsession  with the forms that they were destined to array ! ] ."30 Adjectives such  as fanfreluche (from the Latin fanfaluca, meaning "bagatelle ," and  the German pompholux, "air bubble") ,  turned here as a past partici­ ple so as to heighten the power of sartorial affect, add a mimologically  "feminine" mannerism to Uzanne's hackneyed repertory of mytho­ logical allusions. They also serve to underscore the dark, obsessive  side of clothing mania that U zanne understood to be the secret  bond between himself and his female reader.  What stands out in Uzanne's belletristic tributes to the narcissistic  female fetishist (perhaps more than in the works of his canonical  rivals) is an almost palpable will-to-be woman, a desire to write  himself as woman through the art of sartorial describing. The  effect of his rhetoric can be almost uncanny ; even if one rejects the  cloying, overly "artistic" undulations of his style it comes back at us  with the force of a shocking reflection. Uzanne (much like  Clerambault, rumored to have secretly dressed up in the Muslim  veils that he so delighted in photographing on Algerian women)  doubles the already doubled feminine masquerade, creating a  masculine travesty or cross-dressed impersonation of women in  prose.  Uzanne began his most renowned work-a history of the fan­ with a statement indicating his pleasure in rhetorically "trying on"  women's garb : "I..:auteur de l'Eventail ose se presenter a vous clans  le neglige du home [The author of The Fan dares to present himself  to you in the deshabille of home] ."3 1 Alternately speaking as a  woman and to a woman, he shifts from the role of transvestite to  lover, cajoling his addressee in the confidential tones of an habitue  of the boudoir: "Causons done, s'il vous plait, de cette causerie  intime qu'un terme plus malpropre qu'impropre appelle le deboutonne  de la conversation [Let's chat then, if you will, about that intimate  patter which might itself be called , using a term more malapropric  30.

Elsewhere,  he adopted the voice of the fetishist regressing, as Freud described  him, to that last moment when the mother could still be regarded  as phallic . Infantile phantasms of the most blatant variety hover  around this memory of the "maternal muff":  Tout enfant, nous aimons a jouer avec le grand Manchon maternel , a  passer les mains au rebours clans l'electricite des longs poils , a plonger  notre visage clans l'odeur fauve et capiteuse du pelage et a nous servir  de ce sac fourre clans des espiegleries inconcevables, en y faisant  cache-cache avec des menus objets ou en y enfouissant le chat familier  qui s'acagnarde en sa tiedeur.  As a small child , we loved to play with the big maternal Muff, stroking  and touching the electricity of its long hairs ; plunging our face into the  heady, animal scent of its skin ; getting up to unthinkable monkey-tricks  with this furry sack, from playing peek-a-boo with small objects to  burying our dear cat inside to snuggle in its warmth. 32  When Freud wrote of hair and fur becoming a fetish for his  juvenile subject, he would hardly have found a more appropriate  example than this quasi-autobiographical passage by Uzanne. What  is perhaps more interesting, however, is the way in which this blazon  of the muff succeeds in personifying femininity even as it blocks  perception of the mother by privileging the sartorial part over the  living whole. The muff flirts ! Despite the safely distancing effect of  fetishistic displacement, the woman's dangerous sexuality shines  through, communicated through the very medium chosen to thwart  its immanence.33 One could say that in this description and those  like it throughout Uzanne's work, the fetish is the feminine ; their  languages are one and the same.  Following in the steps of the Goncourt brothers, U zanne evolved  his discourse of femininity out of the nostalgically reconstructed,  extremity-enhanced body of eighteenth-century woman :  Du Manchon, ornement du dehors , je conduirai le lecteur a la Chaus­ sure,  a l'ensorcelante petite Mule, cette friponne qui cache son museau  3 2 .  Uzanne, Les Ornements de la femme, pp. 23g-40.  33 .  Uzanne created a similar effect in the section "Furs" in Les Ornements de la  femme: "Thus amid her furs, woman, this adorable plant, this mimosa pudica, releases a  beauty more mysterious, more gentle, more alluring, more envelopped and envelopping,  as if the electricity of this furry skin were wafting into the air surrounding this  provocative daughter of Eve, a sensuality enticing like a subtle caress that lightly  brushes our senses as it passes" (p. 4 1 ) .  </page> <page sequence="21"> Unmasking the Masquerade 85  de soie ou de maroquin sous le flot des dentelles et que Fragonard nous  fait voir clans /es Hasards de l'escarpolette, lancee gracieusement en l'air,  s'envolant plutot que tombant a terre, avec un esprit et une volupte de  facture qui ne se retrouvent plus que clans Jes peintures des Cytheres  d'autrefois.

Wouldn't it be charming to gratify  oneself with the history of these stylish feminine shoes, footwear that  has always had its fanatical admirers, inspiring Restif de la Bretonne's  novel Fanchette's Foot which begins like an epic poem: "I am the truthful  historian of the brilliant conquests of a beautiful woman's adorable foot?"  (LE 4-5)  Like Maupassant's character Olivier Bertin (a ladies' man and  society painter) in Fort comme la mart ( 1 889), the narrator of The Fan  warrants the sobriquet "realist Watteau," for in addition to reviving  the eighteenth-century taste for scenographies of feminine frivolity,  he is as guilty as Bertin of garnering favor as a "photographer of  dresses and coats ."34  There are several possible explanations for Uzanne's strategic  revival of a clothed rather than a partially naked eighteenth-century  female body (and certainly Fragonard and Boucher provided am­ ple visual examples of the latter) . His foremost concern was to  counteract the encroachment of the execrated "modern nude" (as  in Manet's Olympia or Degas's bathers) on the aesthetic taste of the  fin de siecle . Uzanne complained that "la nudite qu'elle expose  exprime une beaute malsaine et sincere, une volupte perverse, une  34. Guy de Maupassant, Fort comme la mort (Paris : Gallimard, 1 983),  p. 1 04 .  Bertin  exhibits all the symptoms of Uzanne's confessed affliction-vestignomia, or clothing  mania. He penetrates the secrets of feminilite with his intimate knowledge of "the  thousand little nothings" comprising a woman's toilette ; he experiences vertigo and a  sense of religious awe upon entering the commercial "sanctuaries" where feminine  accessories are displayed ; his eyes become uncontrollably riveted by fabric, and his  hands reach for lace like those of the kleptomaniac fetishists described in crimino­ logical records of the 1 880s.  </page> <page sequence="22"> 86 Feminizing the Fetish  maniere de sadisme delirant et capiteux [the nudity displayed by  the modern nude was an overly sincere, unhealthy beauty, a per­ verse voluptuousness, a sadistic manner at once ecstatic and heady ] ."35  Vampiric , gaunt, anemic , chlorotic , convulsive , and above all  hystericized, this decadent nu pathologique excited hallucinatory flights  of eloquence in Uzanne's "sociology of women," published in 1 9 10 .   Seen in  this light, Uzanne's Verkleidungstrieb may be interpreted as  part of a deep compulsion to keep the specter of the "essential"  naked female body at bay. Pathologizing the nude was an ingenious  technique for sustaining the fetishistic illusion of an idealized  femininity. In Son Altesse la femme (Her Highness the Woman; 1 885) ,  the  narrator prostrates himself accordingly before a hieratic goddess  whose aloofness, in contrast to the vulgarly available "modern  nude" inspires reverence and awe. The work is imbued with a  nostalgic cult of the woman of yesteryear, specifically the eighteenth­ century type designated as la Caillette. "La Caillette ! "  Uzanne teases  his reader, "ce joli mot vous trouble et vous surprend, tres curieuse  Lectrice ! . . . C e mot resume clans sa plus haute et sa plus mignonne  expression le type gracieux, evapore et fripon de la femme au  XVIII  siecle.

This word resumes in its highest and most  appealing expression the gracious, vaporous, roguish type of  eighteenth-century woman) ."36 Vapid , frivolous, feckless, pervious  ("She takes on a lover like a new dress, because it's the custom") ,  debauched ("In her person there is a kind of exquisite depravity of  sentiment and expression") ,  and flighty-a cross between a quail  (caille) and a pebble (caillou)-la Caillette emerges as the most  fetishizable male fantasy of the masquerading woman to be found,  identifiable (as Uzanne notes) in the works of every major libertine  author of the eighteenth century : Duclos, Casanova, Crebillon fils,  Marivaux, Retif de la Bretonne, and the marquis de Caraccioli (A  1 1 7- 1 8) .   For Uzanne la Caillette looms large a s  a historic reminder of  an  age of erotic theatricality long gone. He implicitly pays homage to  the "constructed" eroticism of the eighteenth-century female body  35.

Here Marie Antoinette receives  special praise for ushering in "un systeme d'outrance, de retroussis,  de boursouflure qui, en quelques annees, prit de pyramidales  proportions [a system of excess, of curling, of puffing up, that, in a  few years, took on pyramidal proportions] ."37 In their expenditures  and disregard for functionalism, the coiffures of eighteenth-century  woman transparently signify sexual pleasure enjoyed in and for  itself; a disinterested, gratuitous gratification forever insubordinate  to civilization's reproductive aims.38  If  eighteenth-century fashion was occasionally harnessed in the  service of an apology for libertinage, it was also evoked for purely  aesthetic purposes . Uzanne dilated on the "heroism" of eighteenth­ century woman's grand tenue : "On observe son heroisme, ses  stratagemes d'amour, ses coquetteries, son mepris de l'opinion, son  extravagance clans les modes, et a la fois sa science de fee pour  draper un chef-d'oeuvre de costume avec quelques metres d'etoffe  sans valeur [One observes her heroism, her strategies in love, her  coquetry, her contempt for opinion, her extravagance in fashion,  and her fairy genius in draping a masterpiece of costume in meters  of priceless cloth]" (A 267) .  In the monumentalization of falling  drapery, in the exorbitant spectacle of fabric thrown in abundance  over horizontally extending poufs, the rococo acquires a solemnity  and pomp normally reserved for the classical sublime. Eighteenth­ century woman's grandeur "freezes" an erotic credo of perpetual  foreplay in time and testifies to the mysterious process by which  raw materiality is converted into the value-saturated commodity  fetish. Equally, we can see in his larger-than-life shroud an allegori­ cal representation of the female body's transformation into woma_n- 37.

This tiny, jewel-like book contains marvelous  illustrations of the most remarkable eighteenth-century fashions in hairdressing.  38. Uzanne's endorsement of this symbol of nonutilitarian, antibourgeois sexuali­ ty forms a piece with his apology for an ethic of libertinage in Le Bric-a-brac de l'amour  (Paris :  Edouard Rouveyre, 1 879), p. 1 26. In a chapter on libertinage Uzanne  bemoans the nineteenth-century censorship and medicalization of open sexual  practices : "Today we understand sexual libertinage to be 'a sensual derangement  and a bodily intemperence' when we would rather hear only 'tasteful delicacy and  delectation of pleasure,' variants on this spinet of love which, alas, possesses no more  than a single octave" (p. 1 26). Forced to go underground, undermined by the sickly  nineteenth-century taste for sentimentality, libertinage has suffered many setbacks,  according to Uzanne. His chapter concludes with a plea to bring back the pleasures  of a grand century.  </page> <page sequence="24"> 88 Feminizing the Fetish  liness : nothing becomes something; a lifeless robe becomes an aura­ soaked veil.  For Uzanne, as for Georg Simmel , writing a mere decade later,  the veil was perhaps the preeminent sign of the feminine, the  image behind the image of his cherished fan: "In the gesture of the  fan, in the glistening of precious stones or the fold of the veil, is  there not, for sensitive souls, the whole secret of the heart?" "The  little veil is a total symbol,"  he wrote ; "when a mistress takes it off or  puts it on, glimmers of abandon, hope, and tenderness if not  melancholia and inexpressible sadness pass through her gaze."39  Rarely did he miss an opportunity to expatiate upon the seductive  symbolism of this most mysterious feminine accoutrement. Entering  a sanctuary of intimate apparel he confesses:  Je ne sais rien de plus troublant, de plus cajoleur a l'oeil , de plus souple,  de plus adorable, de plus chatouilleux au toucher que tous ces voiles  legers, brillants et superfins . . . . A u course d'une recente visite a une  maison de grande lingerie de luxe, ii me sembla vivre clans un milieu  Edenique ou Jes houris auraient laisse leurs voiles de lumiere .  I know of nothing more troubling, more cajoling to the eye, more soft,  adorable, and tickling to the touch than these light, sparkling, transpar­ ent veils . . . . D uring a recent trip to one of the great lingerie shops, it  seemed that I was living in an Edenic milieu where the houris might  have left their veils of light.40  Refuting the symbolism of Nietzsche's misogynist veil, Simmel  observed that the "girdles and petticoats that fulfill the function of  a fig leaf' paradoxically render concealment itself ornamental.4 1 As  39.

In speaking of Nietzsche's "misogyny" I am  referring specifically to passages in Beyond Good and Evil and The Gay Science in which  Nietzsche claimed that woman's self-adornment and concern with beauty were the  emblems of philosophical mendacity. For a critique of the veil as philosophical  metaphor of femininity (linking the discourse of the veil to fetishism as "faked  orgasm"), see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's essay "Displacement and the Discourse  of Woman," in Displacement: Derrida and After, ed. Mark Krupnick (Bloomington:   Indiana University Press, 1 983) ,  pp. 1 6g-g5. More recently, Mary Ann Doane has  examined these problems in relation to film theory in her essay "Veiling over Desire :  Close-ups of the Woman," in Feminism and Psychoanalysis, ed. Richard Feldstein and  Judith Roof (Ithaca : Cornell University Press, 1 989), pp. 1 05-4 1 .   </page> <page sequence="25"> Unmasking the Masquerade 89  if picking up where Uzanne left off, he located the mystery by  which femininity acquires value in a chain of dual significations :  "consent and refusal,"  "giving and not-giving," and "having and  not-having." Flouncing, waving, winking, veiling-all these gestures  are for Simmel the legible expressions of a dual signification that  places the male possession of woman enticingly into question :  It seems to be the universal experience of male sensibility that the  woman-indeed, the deepest, most devoted woman, whose charm is  inexhaustible-holds back some ultimate, indecipherable and unattainable  quality even in the most passionate offering and disclosure of herself.  . . .  From the perspective of the man, however, the woman's mode of  being appears as a Not-Yet, an unredeemed promise, an unborn profu­ sion of obscure possibilities that have not yet developed far enough  beyond their psychic location to become visible and apprehensible .42  If one follows Simmel's optimistic association of ornamental secrets  with the outlines of an untapped feminine potentiality, then one  might say that Uzanne's vestignomia leads not to an alienated panto­ mime of masculinity (foregrounded by the Goncourts) but, rather,  in the direction of a nuanced intimation of the female sartorial  superego.43 Using Simmel, then, we might interpret Uzanne's fetishistic  language of clothes as referring to a "Not-yet" of femininity-a  fullness without emptiness.  I have used Uzanne and the Goncourt brothers' readings of  eighteenth-century woman to demonstrate the historical relativism  of femininity as a literary and psychoanalytical invention. It seemed  to me that their texts provided particularly clear illustrations of  how certain stereotypical attributes of womanliness came to be  codified in such a way as to survive into our own time. The  Goncourts' La Femme au dix-huitieme siecle exemplified the unmasking  of discursive femininity by the eruption of masculinity onto the  42 .  Simmel, "Flirtation," pp. i47-48.  43 .  Pierre Saint-Amand's emphasis on the ornamented body of Marie Antionette  leads in this direction. He makes the case that "the history of Marie Antoinette could  be reconstituted according to a series of adornments, each one corresponding to a  crucial moment in her short life. Framing her flight to Varennes and ultimate  beheading as a staged set piece, an act called "The Final Wardrobe," Saint-Amand  reads the fullness of her character as she stands disheveled, badly dressed, her hair  shockingly white before the crowd. Paradoxically, he argues, the crowd makes of her  lack of adornment a kind of martyrized ornament.  </page> <page sequence="26"> 90 Feminizing the Fetish  sartorial image. By contrast, Uzanne's speaking fetishes blur the  gender distinctions habitually assigned to specific apparel, as in R.  Redelsperger's "Memoirs of a Corset," in which the narrator,  personified as a talking corset stay, is both feminized as it ·shapes  itself to the female body and masculinized as it competes with a  jealous husband for the attentions of his lingerie-smitten wife.44  Uzanne's cross-dressed writing of the feminine may ultimately be  read through a feminist perspective as a send-up of gendered  textuality, a pastiche or "performance" of sartorial pleasure that  serves to unfix ontological gender codes.  By investigating these representations of the constructibility of  femininity, I hoped to underscore its tenuousness as a masquerade  of gender. But the theory of the masquerade itself has proved to be  inextricable from essentialist commonplaces associated with femi­ ninity. As we all know, Joan Riviere's articulation of "womanliness as  a masquerade" has endured, renewed by film critics such as Mary  Ann Doane as part of her effort to define the psychology of female  spectatorship. What remains somewhat unclear to me is just why  one would want to retain such a theory. With its language of veils ,   masks, and sexual travesty, the discourse of the masquerade seems  always to participate in the very obfuscation of femininity that it  seeks to dispel. Though invented by a woman psychoanalyst to  explain the "flaunting of femininity" on the part of intellectual  women, the theory of the masquerade-associated with the art of  camouflaging masculine as feminine-may ultimately qualify as just  another mask of phallocentric psychoanalysis. Even if one wants to  argue that the masquerade provides a "screen-test" for a female  superego, the psychohistorical perplex remains : if femininity, in its  most historically flamboyant incarnation ultimately reverts to mas­ culinity (as the Goncourts' text seems to suggest) , then in what does  the construct of femininity inhere?45 How did woman come to be  identified with womanliness and then trapped behind the mask of  the masquerade? Is the masquerade feminism's fetish?  44. R. Redelsperger, "Memoires d'un corset," J;Art et  la Mode ( 1 880) : 33-36. The  corset speaks throughout in the first person, bragging of his intimate knowledge of  women, recounting his seduction of a married lady and near destruction at the  hands of the husband who tugs too hard on the laces.  45.

As Stephen Heath has pointed out, no  thorough examination of Riviere's life and contribution to the  history of psychoanalysis exists to date.46 She was analyzed by  Ernest Jones (with whom, according to Heath, she probably had an  affair) , by Freud (whose collected papers she translated) , and later  by Melanie Klein. After she herself became an analyst, D. W.  Winnicot became one of her patients . A bibliography of her work  appeared in the International Journal of Psychoanalysis in 1 963,  but  aside from the masquerade essay her writings remain shrouded in  oblivion.  That Riviere's theory of the masquerade has secured so privi­ leged a place in contemporary critical thought seems all the more  curious when one rereads the piece closely-it contains some bi­ zarre twists and leaves issues unresolved. Riviere's premiere analy­ sand was "an American woman engaged in work of a propagandistic  nature which consisted principally in speaking and writing."47 Later  we learn that this lady propagandist is a southerner, plagued by the  fantasy of seducing a black man intent on raping her. Riviere (who  was English and for a time educated in Germany) makes no  mention of the American sociocultural context of racism, fear, and  bigotry so clearly at work in the fantasy life of her patient. The  woman dreams of washing off her guilty pleasure after sex with the  black man (a masquerade of innocence according to Riviere) , but  the question of her erotic negrophobia-and by extension, of  psychoanalysis and race-are never alluded to in Riviere's elabora­ tions of the case (nor, to my knowledge are these issues addressed  by subsequent critics ,  with the exception of Mary Ann Doane) .48 At  the very least, the lesson we might draw here is that the chosen  prototype of the masquerading woman is a problematic figure- 46.

Further references to this essay will be abbreviated "MR".  </page> <page sequence="28"> 92 Feminizing the Fetish  abstracted from history and culture and blind to the psychosexual  politics of racism.   Riviere's paragon of femininity i s  a successful career woman, an  exemplary wife, an accomplished homemaker, and an elegant  dresser. The only signs betraying her suppressed inward instability  are those of sartorial extravagance and what Riviere refers to as a  tendency toward "compulsive ogling and coquetting," particularly  manifest during her delivery of public lectures ("WM" 37) .  Riviere's  interpretation of the jarring contrast between her intellectual seri­ ousness and her simpering, flirtatious manner emphasizes theatricality  and gender crossover: "The exhibition in public of her intellectual  proficiency, which was in itself carried through successfully, signi­ fied an exhibition of herself in possession of the father's penis,  having castrated him. The display once over, she was seized by  horrible dread of the retribution the father would then exact.  Obviously it was a step towards propitiating the avenger to endeav­ or to offer herself to him sexually"("WM" 37) .  Though the explana­ tion is somewhat crude and fails to contest the primacy accorded  castration and Penisneid in Freudian theory, what is perhaps of far  greater concern in her argument is its elliptical logic, a logic  leading away from rather than toward any resolution of the famous  "riddle of femininity." Womanliness is construed as an effect of  masked masculinity, as the passage most often cited by feminist  critics attests :  Womanliness therefore could be assumed and worn as a mask, both to  hide the possession of masculinity and to avert the reprisals expected if  she was found to possess it-much as a thief will turn out his pockets  and ask to be searched to prove that he had not stolen the goods .  The  reader may now ask how I define womanliness or where I draw the line  between genuine womanliness and the "masquerade." My suggestion is  not, however, that there is any such difference ; whether radical or  superficial, they are the same thing. ("WM" 38).   Clarifying the contours of the empty representation lying at the  very core of Riviere's notion of womanliness , Stephen Heath has  written of this passage : "In the masquerade the woman mimics an  authentic-genuine-womanliness but then authentic womanliness  is such a mimicry, is the masquerade ("they are the same thing") ; to  be a woman is to dissimulate a fundamental masculinity, femininity  is that dissimulation ."49 A double cover-up, a make-believe sem- 49· Heath, "Joan Riviere," p. 49.  </page> <page sequence="29"> Unmasking the Masquerade 93  blance of womanliness superimposed on a pretend masculinity, a  camouflage of persiflage-this notion of womanliness (recalling the  Goncourts' portrait of the phallic femme d'etat) exhibits the structur­ al logic of fetishism insofar as the (Freudian) fetish functions as a  substitute for something that was never there in the first place.  Riviere herself encourages this analogy when she implies that the  male equivalent of the female masquerade is fetishism. Summariz­ ing the case of a transvestite she noted: "The excitation was  produced by the sight of himself with hair parted in the center,  wearing a bow tie . These extraordinary 'fetishes' turned out to  represent a disguise of himself as his sister; the hair and bow were  taken from her" ("WM" 40 ;  author's emphasis) .  One might con­ clude here that fetishism is failed masquerade, for when the man  dons the mask of womanliness it remains an unconvincing repre­ sentation of femininity, whereas the opposite is true when women  adopt a cover-up for masculine attributes-their travesty appears to  be entirely believable.  What impresses me in all this is not so much that the sex  anatomically endowed with a penis seems perverse when it tries to  pretend not to have it (implicitly reinforcing the security in being  male) in contrast to the woman (who instinctively, "naturally" veils  her lack) but, rather, that the disguises adopted by both man and  woman refer back to a travestied masculinity, or as Lacan would say,  to a veiled "phallus" possessed by nobody.5° Femininity remains  devoid of content except insofar as ( i )  the layers of its dissimulation  are stripped away to reveal a fundamentally masculine Imago; ( 2 )  it  slides into masochism (as in the case of female Harlequin romance  readers who, as Ann Douglas has observed, enjoy "the titillation of  seeing themselves, not necessarily as they are, but as some men  would like to see them : illogical, innocent, magnetized by male  sexuality and brutality") ; and (3) it mimics what Lacan termed  "virile display."5 1  Lacau, rather underhandedly, returns the masking function to  masculinity even as he springs sexual identity loose from biological  essentialism.  In "La Signification du phallus, "  he uses the masquer­ ade to corroborate Freud's "view that there is only one libido, his  50. Doane also notes that Riviere's argument "makes femininity dependent on  masculinity for its very definition" ("MR" 47) .   5 1 .

Lacan's appropriation of Riviere points to a similar  conclusion despite its distortion of her argument. Where Riviere  had described the masquerade of womanliness in blindly hetero­ sexualist terms as a compensatory feint for a phallicism that risks  tabulation to lesbianism,  Lacan sees (heterosexual) woman as suc­ cessfully obtaining a semblance of manliness through masquerade:53  Paradoxical as this formulation might seem, I would say that it is in  order to be the phallus, that is to say, the signifier of the desire of the  Other, that the woman will reject an essential part of her femininity,  notably all its attributes through masquerade. It is for what she is not  that she expects to be desired as well as loved. But she finds the signifier  of her own desire in the body of the one to whom she addresses her  demand for love. Certainly we should not forget that the organ actually  invested with this signifying function takes on the value of a fetish.  With Lacan's formulation, we come full circle from male fetishism  as female masquerade manque to women masquerading as fetishes,  that is, as false phalluses that permit the imaginary phallus which  both sexes want, but which neither sex has, to continue functioning  as a manque a etre ("lack in being") that generates desire as it is  brought into being.54  In her analysis of the costumes in Federico Fellini's film Juliette of  52 .

Lacan, "The Meaning of the Phallus," p. 84. Judith Butler's reading (Gender  Trouble, p.84) of Riviere as "fearful of her own phallicism" provides a crucial  antiheterosexualist critique of the masquerade theory. She says ; "the donning of  femininity as mask may reveal a refusal of a female homosexuality and, at the same  time, the hyperbolic incorporation of that female Other who is refused-an odd  form of preserving and protecting that love within the circle of the melancholic and  negative narcissism that results from the physic inculcation of compulsory  heterosexuality" (p.  53) .   54.  Butler offers important critiques of Lacan's model of woman masquerading as  a fetish . "At least two very different tasks can be discerned from the ambiguous  structure of Lacan's analysis," she argues. "On the one hand, masquerade may be  understood as the performative production of a sexual ontology, an appearing that  makes itself convincing as a 'being' ; on the other hand, masquerade can be read as a  denial of a feminine desire that presupposes some prior ontological femininity  regularly unrepresented by the phallic economy" (Gender Trouble, p. 47) .   </page> <page sequence="31"> Unmasking the Masquerade 95  the Spirits, Michele Montrelay, elaborating on Lacan, describes how,  when woman masquerades as a fetish, the results are unremittingly  negative : "In this mountain of crazy objects, these feathers , hats ,  and strange, baroque constructions rising up like so many silent  insignia, a dimension of femininity is clarified which Lacan, appro­ priating Joan Riviere's term, designated as masquerade. But it must  be noted that this masquerade takes 'saying nothing' as its only end.  Absolutely nothing. And to produce this nothing, woman disguises  herself with her own body."55 Here the female body is fetishistic  insofar as it functions as a disguise or foil that lures the male  subject into wanting something that he does not really desire  (woman) in order to preserve free and clear the erotic territory of  the ideal phallus (le manque a etre) that he continues to covet  elsewhere . Whether as prosthesis or personification of "nothing"  the masquerading woman appears in the self-depreciated role of  lack sustainer, a kind of supporting "cast" or "mainstay" of one in  the theater of phallocentric illusion.  In the first of two important essays on the female film spectator,  Mary Ann Doane attempts to redress this negative turn despite an  initial avowal that "the mask of femininity conceals a non-identity.''56  Her interpretation, influenced by the body poetics of Irigaray  (though diverging sharply from Irigaray's use of la mascarade to  indicate the female mimicry of the Oedipus complex, of woman's  induction into the male libidinal economy), hinges on a question of  nearness/farness. The masquerade, she claims, "in flaunting femi­ ninity, holds it at a distance. Womanliness is a mask which can be  worn or removed. The masquerade's resistance to patriarchal  positioning would therefore lie in its denial of the production of  femininity as closeness, as presence-to-itself, as, precisely, imagistic"  ("FM" 8 1-82 ) .  For Doane, the wearability of the masquerade-the  beguiling ease with which such cladding is removed-affords wom­ en a critical distance from the claustrophobia of their own bodies .  It also advances a feminist project: the masquerade proves to be an  uneasy spectacle for the masculine viewer, serving both "to  defamiliarize female iconography" and "to disarticulate male sys­ tems of viewing" ("FM" 82 ) .  In this piece, Doane takes us to the  55. Michele Montrelay, J; Ombre et le nom: Sur la feminite (Paris : Minuit, 1 977) ,  p.  7 1 .   56.

She concludes her  article optimistically prophesying the advent of a female spectator,  but this spectator remains a specter awaiting definition.  Returning to the topic six years later, Doane is more circumspect  toward the pitfalls involved in trying to use the masquerade as a  counterdiscourse to that of the female screen fetish ("her status as  spectacle rather than spectator") ,  yet even here the argument  concludes on a futuristic , hypothetical note :  Riviere's patient, looking out at her own male audience, with improprie­ ty, throws the image of their own sexuality back to them as "game," as  'joke," investing it, too, with the instability and the emptiness of the  masquerade. Heath refers to this as a "strong social-political, feminist  joke" in the manner of Virginia Woolf in Three Guineas. As long as she is  not caught in her own act. As long as she does not forget that the  masquerades of femininity and masculinity are not totally unreal or  totally a joke but have a social effectivity we cannot ignore. We still need  to tell our own jokes, but hopefully they will be different ones. Structurally  different ones. ("MR" 52-53 ;  author's emphasis)  In this 'joke" we see the glimmering outlines of an ironic, sexually  volatile, politically feminist subject with some chance of survival but  little protection against the risk of getting "caught in her own act."  In  the end, her "act" depends too much perhaps on Doane's laconic  contention that masquerade can generate femininity from within ,   eschewing reference to masculine essentialisms and the fetishistic  conceit of the present/absent phallus.  Where does this leave us theoretically? Freud , Riviere, Lacan,  Montrelay, and Doane all seem to concur that femininity, handi­ capped by its lack of a visual signifier equivalent in symbolic import  to the phallus and historically relative in the forms of its social  construction, disappears upon close inspection into a conceptual  void, or at best, survives as a surrogate masculinity.57  57 .  Alice Jardine reconfigures this void in another way when she applies fetishism  (as a synonym for oscillation and "a demand for doubling") to the ambivalence  within contemporary feminism over "essential" differences. In contrast to paranoia  (which for her implies that women know what they are in knowing that they are  different) , feminist fetishism, oscillating between "Women are different" and "No,  they are not," reinvents the epistemological "dark continent" of womanliness.  Jardine's feminist fetishist, it appears, is plunged anew in darkness; deprived, on the  one hand, of an empowering, "fetishistic" illusion of masculinity, and on the other,  of the small comfort afforded by womanliness as a masquerade.

Teresa Brennan  (New York: Routledge, 1 989), p. 75·   </page> <page sequence="33"> Unmasking the Masquerade 97  If the "womanliness as a masquerade" controversy sounds a  pessimistic note in the quest for an enabling articulation of femininity,  a different tactic may be in order. A return to the earlier problem­ atic contained in Freud's singular conception of the universal  female clothes fetishist may in fact provide an alternative approach.  Despite its patronizing undertone, Freud's stark announcement ''All  women . . . a re clothes fetishists" allows us to think of woman's  sartorial autoreification as the symptom of an extended, projected  affirmation of female ontology.  Citing Louis Flaccus's "Remarks on the Psychology of Clothes"  ( 1 906) ,  Flugel offers specific strategies for imparting an ethic to this  narcissistic female fetishism: "Whenever we bring a foreign body into  relationship with the surface of the body . . . t he consciousness of  our personal existence is prolonged into the extremities and sur­ faces of this foreign body, and the consequence is-feelings, now of  an expansion of our proper self, now of the acquisition of a kind  and amount of motion foreign to our natural organs, now of an  unusual degree of vigour, power of resistance, or steadiness in our  bearing:'58 By reading sartorial augmentation as a complex sensation­ an inmixture of prolongation,  vigor, resistance, steadiness, and  thrilling contact with the "foreign"-Flaccus anticipated the notion  of a sartorial superego. Years later, in a similar vein, the Lacanian  analyst Bela Grunberger offered a revised look at feminine narcissism:  If woman, following the tendency toward increased social homogeniza­ tion and the effacement of sexual difference, seeks to benefit from a  certain sexual liberty (the same enjoyed by men), then she cannot help  investing her love life in a narcissistic mode. She will valorize her  corporal superego in the most extended sense, going from her body,  her clothes, and her adornments toward her "interior," her house and  everything that functions as material support for her love life.59  In this context, Grunberger's notions of physically extended subjec­ tivity and "material support" literalize sartorial figures of speech as  they recode them within the rhetoric of feminist psychoanalysis.  Such a rhetoric allows female subjectivity to be theorized in terms  of an aesthetics of ornamentation without immediate recourse to a  58 .

As Georg Simmel  wrote in what looks like a prescient effort to wean gender theory  from its fixation on feminine lack: "It is, of course, a mistake to  regard this 'lack of differentiation' simply as a deficiency and a  condition of inferiority. On the contrary, it is the thoroughly  positive mode of being of the woman, which forms its own ideal  and has no less legitimacy than the 'differentiated state' of the  man."6° Foreshadowing Irigaray's utopian dream of an asymmetrical  sexual difference beyond sameness , Simmel's "thoroughly positive  mode of being of the woman" encourages the unmasking of the  masquerade as a theoretical "get-up" for defensive womanliness but  falls short of dispensing with it altogether. Simmel's affirmation of  ornament, recalling the Goncourts' exultation in "cette mode de  parade, de magnificence, d'eclat, imposee par I' etiquette aux femmes  de la cour [this fashion of parade, magnificence, show, imposed by  etiquette on ladies of the court] , imparts an ethic of sartorial  presence to the aesthetic of masquerade. In this sense we might  reread the theory of the masquerade as corrected, so to speak, by  sartorial female fetishism,  which supplants the notion of femininity  as empty content or infinitely layered veil, to replace it with a  theory of materialized social construction.  60 .
