In the present article, prominent interpretations of the trickster are briefly summarized and subsequently applied to an exemplary trickster: the fox in the oral traditions of the southern Central Andes. The considered interpretations of the role and function of the trickster turn out to be somewhat problematic. For this reason the article proposes an alternative interpretation of the trickster, mainly founded on current research in cognitive anthropology. [Southern Central Andes, Quechua, Aymara, Chipaya, trickster, Andean oral traditions, cognitive anthropology] Matthias Pache, M.A. in Ethnology (Bonn 2007: "The Fox as a Trickster in Andean Folktales"), M.A. in Psychology (Bonn 2009), and maîtrise in Contemporanean Societies - Europe Americas (Institut des Hautes Études de l'Amérique Latine, Paris 2006: "The mundus inversus in Andean Animal Folktales"). - Lecturer in language and culture of the Mapuche at the Univer sity of Bonn since 2009. 1 Introduction The worldwide existing category of protagonists called trickster by ethnologists or literary specialists has often been described as a puzzling and above all fascinating phenomenon.1 Ethnologists first discov ered or rather constructed the concept of the "trick ster" at the end of the 19th century. Protagonists which are to be classified within this category can be found in different cultures on all continents - in Africa, Polynesia, Asia, Europe, and very frequently in North America.2 These different trickster figures show a considerable "family resemblance" (Witt genstein 1953, cited in Sperber 1996: 17),3 but the correspondence between this Western concept and the indigenous reality is a matter of critical debate (cf. e.g., Pelton 1993; Beidelmann 1993). In the course of the last century, ethnologists, psychologists as well as specialists in religious and literary studies have proposed many different inter pretations of the role and the (mainly social) func tion of tricksters. In the present article, I briefly summarize important interpretations of the trick ster and discuss them with reference to a concrete example: the fox in the oral tradition of the southern Central Andes. Based on this discussion, alternative interpretations of the trickster will be developed. Babcock-Abrahams (1975: 147); Hynes (1993a: 216f.); Ma karius (1993: 67); Pelton (1993: 122f.). Mower (2001); Doty (1993); Koepping (1984); Levy (1974); Stein (1993); Vecsey (1993); Weber und Weber 1983: 85). Just to mention an example, there is a worldwide association of tricksters and nets or webs: Michabo, a trickster among the Algonquin-speaking populations of the eastern Woodlands of North America copies net fabrication from spiders and im parts this knowledge to humans (Brinton 1969 [1876]: 177). Ananse, a trickster of the Ashanti and other Akan in Ghana, is a spider (Vecsey 1993: 107). Raven, a trickster among differ ent populations on the northwestern coast of North America teaches both the spiders and humans how to fabricate nets/ webs (Hyde 1998: 18). Among the Okanagan, an indigenous population living in the present states of British Columbia and Washington, there are stories in which the Great Spirit charges coyote, the trickster, to teach the humans how to catch salmon (Hyde 1998: 22). Loki, a trickster in Scandi navian mythology, is also associated to the invention of nets and fishing for salmon (Golther 2004: 504).</page><page sequence="2">482 Matthias Pache 1.1 Interpretations of the Trickster William J. Hynes (1993b), a specialist in religious studies, defines six central characteristics of trick sters, stressing the fact that not every trickster au tomatically shows all of them. Tricksters have an anomalous and ambiguous personality, they play tricks and deceive their environment, they have the ability to shift their shape and to invert situations. They often act as messengers of imitators of the gods and as a sacred and at the same time lewd bricoleur.4 1.2 The Role of the Trickster First interpretations of North American tricksters made by Brinton (1969 [1876]) and Boas (1969 [1898]) focused on their ambiguous character, their simultaneously acting as a fool, and a culture hero. Considering Michabo, a trickster in the oral tra ditions of indigenous populations of the eastern Woodlands, Brinton (1969: 178 f., 186 f.) interprets this protagonist, based on etymological specula tions, as a former light deity, as a degenerate cul ture hero that has been transformed, in the course of time, into an egotistical fool ( 1969: 175 f.). Boas, on the other hand, interprets the foolish-egotistical character as original trait of the trickster ( 1969: 11). Other authors preferred a psychodynamic inter pretation of the trickster, as Paul Radin (1954) did in his analysis of Wakdjunkaga in the myth cycle of the Sioux-speaking Winnebago or Hochunk in the Great Lakes Region. Radin (1954: 154) inter prets the trickster's adventures as a description of man's coming to consciousness. The trickster him self is, following Radin, a personification of a re mote, primitive past of manhood, but also of man's present inferior traits of character (cf. also Bischof 1996: 437, 518; Jung 1954: 204). Claude Lévi-Strauss (1958: 251), to cite another interpreter of the trickster's role, postulates that mythical thinking is thinking in oppositions and that myths have the function of transcending these oppositions. Thus, Lévi-Strauss gives the follow ing explanation of the mediating (and as a result of this: ambiguous) character of the trickster: trickster simply embodies the myths' attempt to mediate and transcend opposites (1958: 254). Mac L. Ricketts (1966: 336f.; 1993: 105) under stands trickster as a parody of the shaman. Man has two dilferent possibilities to respond to the world and its mysteries: in the way of the shaman and in the way of the trickster (Ricketts 1966: 344 f.). The shaman's attitude towards the "Great Unknown" is awe. He "represents the religious experience of hu mility ... before Spirit" (Ricketts 1993: 87) and tries to manipulate the world in an indirect way, through the worship of supernatural beings and cooperation with them. Trickster embodies the opposite attitude towards the unknown world. He tries to submit it di rectly without help from others, only through his own wit, and in playing irreverent tricks (Ricketts 1966: 335-339,344—347). Because of this opposite attitude towards the world that trickster and shaman stand for, the latter are parodied and become an object of ridicule in trickster tales (Ricketts 1966: 336-338). The literary specialist Barbara Babcock-Abra hams (1975: 150f., 172) relates the adventures of Wakdjùnkaga to the "rites de passage" (cf. van Gen nep 1986; Turner 1969) and their tripartite struc ture of separation, marginality/liminality, and re aggregation. Trickster as a "marginal figure" lives "betwixt and between" all sorts of social and spa tial boundaries and positions (Babcock-Abrahams 1975: 155). He embodies opposites, escapes and at the same time confuses all sorts of structure - he is "paradox personified" (148). With his ambiguous and paradoxical character, trickster epitomizes the paradox of the human condition and ex ploits the incongruity that we are creatures of the earth and yet not wholly creatures of the earth in that we have need of clothing and spiritual ideals to clothe our naked ness, of money, and of language - of human institutions. Further, he embodies the fundamental contradiction of our existence: the contradiction between the individual and society, between freedom and constraint (Babcock Abrahams 1975: 160f.). In her interpretation of different trickster figures, Laura Makarius (1993: 71, 84) emphasizes the as sociation between the transgressing and breaking of (blood) taboos and the attainment of superhuman, ambivalent, sacred, magical capabilities. In doing that, she reconciles the seeming inconsistency be tween the trickster as a taboo-breaking fool and as a culture hero: trickster receives magical goods and powers through the transgression of taboos "on be half of his group, thereby obtaining the medicines or talismans necessary to satisfy its needs and desires. Thus he plays the role of founder of his society's ritual and ceremonial life" (Makarius 1993: 73), and at the same time he "take[s] upon himself the sins of humanity and set[s] humans free, by virtue of the fa miliar process of redemption" (83). For this reason, the trickster's behaviour is depicted as silly and stu pid: he thus becomes a victim of his own tricks and "pay[s] the price of his violations" (84). 4 Cf. also Babcock-Abrahams (1975: 159f.); Hyde (1998: 17, 185; 2001: 185); Weber und Weber ( 1983: 103). Anthropos 107.2012</page><page sequence="3">The Fox in the Andes 483 1.3 The Function of the Trickster Different scientists have not only tried to describe the role of the trickster, but have also undertaken several attempts to explain the character of the trick ster and have given several interpretations of pos sible functions of the trickster or rather of telling trickster tales. Some authors underline the deep ly satisfying entertainment character of trickster myths5 and postulate a social venting function (Dundes 1964: 108; Hynes 1993a: 206f.). Trickster tales are also said to serve pedagogic goals and to affirm social rules and values by breaking them and giving negative examples.6 Ricketts (1966: 348, 350) conceives the function of trickster myths as to impart people with the in sight that man's possibilities are limited. Some of these limitations are natural, some of them are cul tural. Within these boundaries, man "is to live with all his powers" (348), without taking neither life nor himself too seriously and without fearing or serving transcendent powers. Trickster gives man a "pur pose for living this life. He says that this life is good, that it is to be grasped with enthusiasm and enjoyed to the hilt" (350). Babcock-Abrahams (1975: 184f.) postulates the creation of communitas (cf. Turner 1969) as a cen tral function of the performance of trickster tales. Communitas is a hardly structured "modality of so cial relatedness" (185), in which status does not have any importance and social roles are reversed, and that prevails, for example, in carnival. This marginal state, "freed from the constraints of social structural roles" (185) highly correlates with cre ativity and fantasy. Trickster tales hence allow it to throw doubt on all sorts of rules and to provide hu mans with new perspectives. 2 A Concrete Example: The Fox in the Southern Central Andes 2.1 The Southern Central Andes as a Homogenous Cultural Area The fox tales or cuentos1, considered within the framework of this article, have been recorded dur ing a fieldwork trip from July to September 2006 in the Altiplano of the southern Central Andes, in a re gion between Lake Titicaca (Puno Province, Puno Department, Peru) in the north and Coipasa Lake (Atahuallpa Province, Oruro Department, Bolivia) in the south. The different indigenous groups that settle this region are all holder of a common Ande an culture (cf. Gade 1999: 33-36), although there is no genetic relationship between the languages they speak: Quechua Collao, Aymara, and Chipaya (Ade laar and Muysken 2004: 167-169, 187, 259-261, 362f., 612, 619f.). Nevertheless, a great number of phenomena in these languages evidence long and intense contact between the different indigenous groups (cf. e.g., Adelaar 1987; Hannß 2008: 8-10). At present, culture and way of life of the Quechua-, Aymara-, and Chipaya-speaking populations in the southern Central Andes are extremely similar or even identical.8 In addition, more or less identical versions of the fox tales, that are analyzed in this article, can be found in other regions of the Andes, sometimes far away.9 The fox tales analyzed within the present article do not possess any elements that would be specific for only one of the three indige nous groups, Quechua, Aymara, or Chipaya. These points taken together, a relatively undifferentiated analysis of the presented fox tales seems justified. 2.2 Biological Sketch of the Andean Fox The Andean Fox (Dusicyon culpaeus) belongs to the genus Dusicyon, whose main distribution lies in southern and western South America. The pre dominant habitat of the Andean Fox are open and rather dry areas (Gudemann 1992: 389), its colour is grey, its length is up to 115 cm, and its main activity is nocturne (Itier 1997: 315). The main prey of the Hyde (1998: 188 f.); Hynes (1993a: 202-206); cf. also Bab cock-Abrahams (1975: 182). Hyde (1998: 295); Hynes (1993a: 205,207f.); Pelton (1993: 138); Vecsey (1993). The term cuento will be used in this article as a synonym of "oral tradition," "myth," and "tale." 8 Cf. e.g.. Gade (1999: 36-41); Garr (1972: 178); Johnsson (1986: 33); Leleu (2005: 246-258); Manga Quespi (1994: 168); Marzal (1971: 253f.); Murra (1984: 122-124); Ortiz Rescaniere (1989: 137-167); Schramm (1988: 170); Wach tel (1990: 17 f., 64, 72, 112, 281 f.). Llachön, home of the Quechua-speaking storyteller ("The Fox and the Condor") is situated in an area that once was dominated by Aymara but also by Puquina- and Uru-speak ing populations (Adelaar and Muysken 2004: 260; Wachtel 1990: 506-509, 512f.). Oruro, the city where the Aymara speaking storyteller ("The Fox and the Birds") comes from, lies in proximity of a region where Quechua is spoken today (Adelaar and Muysken 2004: 260). The village of Santa Ana de Chipaya, where the Chipaya-speaking storyteller ("The Fox and the Woman") comes from, is surrounded by Aymara speaking people (Wachtel 1990: 14). 9 Cf. e.g., Dedenbach-Salazar Saenz (1999); Itier (1997); Os terling (1984); Payne (2000); Pino Saavedra (1982); Taylor (1996) Anthropos 107.2012</page><page sequence="4">484 Matthias Pache Map: The southern Central Andes (Wachtel 1990: 15). Andean Fox are different small birds, mice (Morote 2.3 The Fox in Central Andean Culture Best 1988: 88) but also young llamas and lambs. To a lesser degree it also eats corn and different fruit There is not much archaeological information about (Itier 1997: 311 f.). the role of the fox in the Andes before the arrival of the Spaniards (Zuidema 1985: 186). In dictionaries from colonial times the fox is inter alia associated with slyness, theft, wilderness and the uncivilized, and a certain creative power (Bertonio 2006 [1612]: Anthropos 107.2012</page><page sequence="5">The Fox in the Andes 485 164, 431; Gonzalez Holguin 1989 [1608]: 37, 47, 421). Other sources from colonial times like "Ri tos y tradiciones de Huarochiri"10 depict the fox as worthless (Taylor 1980 [1608]: chap. 2: 35), ner vous and easily startled (chap. 5: 49f.; chap. 6: 60f.) as well as knowledgeable (chap. 5: 45). In different colonial sources, the fox appears as a bringer of bad tidings,11 as a death messenger (Guaman Poma de Ayala 1936 [ca. 1615]: 282), and as playing a cer tain role in agricultural contexts.12 In precolonial times a deity in the shape of a fox was adored in Pachacamac, a sanctuary and oracle on the coast south of the present city of Lima.13 At present the fox seems to be associated in the southern Central Andes with the following aspects:14 wilderness,15 slyness and skill,16 ruse and decep tion (Morote Best 1988: 88), with the underworld,17 with the transition to adulthood (Urton 1985: 259 270), with theft (Chirinos Rivera y Maque Capi ra 1996: 196-198; Morote Best 1988: 88), and the ability to foresee the future in different contexts.18 As a protagonist of the cuentos, the fox is also as sociated with a certain stupidity:19 "Es un animal tonto para nosotros. Inteligente, pero tonto ... al mismo tiempo. Sena mejor decirlo 'tonto vivo'."20 The fox as a protagonist of oral traditions is clever and stupid at the same time.21 Being a skillful cattle thief (Chirinos Rivera y Maque Capira 1996: 196— 198), the fox is killed with poison22 or with traps23 in some regions. In other regions, however, the fox is respected and feared (Itier 1997: 312) and is re garded as a legate of the pachatierra, maintaining the reciprocal relationship between humans and the earth by taking cattle, and, thereby, guaranteeing the farmers' prosperity.24 The fox plays also an impor tant role in agricultural contexts, foreseeing, for ex ample, the richness of the harvest (Chirinos Rivera y Maque Capira 1996: 194; Urton 1985: 261). His entire tail or its tip helps men, as a talisman, in giv ing a speech, in seducing women,25 and in carrying out transactions26 - the person thereby attains the ruse and skillfulness attributed to the fox (cf. also Morote Best 1988: 87). 10 The manuscript edited under this title was probably part of the documents belonging to the clergyman Francisco de Avila and was used by him to fight the religion of the indigenous population in Huarochiri, near Lima (Dedenbach-Salazar Saenz 2003: 4 f.). 11 Betânzos (1968 [1551]: chap. 17: 52f.); Cobo (1956 [1653]: chap. 45: 359); Taylor (1980: chap. 2: 35). 12 Arriaga (1999 [1621]: 44); Guaman Poma de Ayala (1936: 859,1138,1159,859). 13 Cieza de Leon (1984 [1553]: chap. 50: 226); Garcilaso de la Vega (1995 [1609]: book 6, chaps. 30-31: 393-395), based on that: Calancha (1976 [1638]: vol. 3, chap. 19: 925); Al bornoz (1989 [end of 16th century]: 191); cf. also Eeckhout (1998); Taylor (1980: chap. 5: 43-45, 234 f.). 14 The following information is based on different sources like dictionaries, ethnological articles, oral traditions, and direct reports recorded during my own fieldwork in 2006. 15 Chirinos Rivera y Maque Capira (1996: 198-203); de Lucca (1983: 376, 547); La Riva (2003: 19). 16 Rosat Pontacti (2004: 66); de Lucca (1983: 217); Uhle (1968: 53-59). 17 Arnold and Yapita Moya (1992: 13); Schramm (1988: 174); van Kessel (1994: 233); Urton (1985: 260). 18 Chirinos Rivera y Maque Capira (1996: 194); Morote Best (1988: 87); Urton (1985: 260); van Kessel (1994: 234). 19 Pers. comm., 04.08.2006, Juan Condon Quispe [change of name], 23, Chipaya speaker. 20 Pers. comm., 18.08.2006, José Condori Quispe [change of name], brother of Juan, 45, Chipaya speaker. 21 Chirinos Rivera y Maque Capira (1996: 198); cf. also Lausent (1984); Morgante (2001). 22 Pers. comm., 19.07.2006, Wilhams Ccori Valdivia, 26, from Puno City, Peru, student, Quechua speaker; cf. also data from van Kessel (1994: 233). 23 Pers. comm., 27.07.2006, Beatriz Chayna Choque, 48, from Paucarcolla, Puno Province, Puno Department, Peru, farmer, Quechua speaker.

Sparakt 2.5 Interpretation of the Role of the Fox First of all, when comparing the fox, as he appears in the three cuentos presented above, with tricksters' typical features and characteristics (cf. chap. 1.1), there can be no doubt that the fox in the Andean oral traditions has to be considered as a trickster. As to the different interpretations of the trick ster's role proposed by different authors (cf. chap. 1.2), there are also certain accordances. Within his failing attempt to fly and to trans gress cosmic levels, the fox appears as a carica ture of a shaman (cuento l).53 Exploding and at the same time providing humans with potato and chunu (freeze-dried potato), he is at the same time a fool and a culture hero (cuento 2).54 Furthermore, the ambiguous, clever, and at the same time stupid fox more or less successfully transcends several differ ent categorical and spatial boundaries - although not in a mediating role55 - (cuentos 1, 2, 3; cf. Lévi Strauss 1958) and violates taboos and social norms (-cuentos 1, 3; cf. Babcock-Abrahams 1975; Maka rius 1993). He personifies a lack of impulse control (cuentos 1, 3; cf. Jung 1954; Radin 1954) and ap pears as a marginal figure, when he hangs between heaven and earth or when he prowls around the woman's house (cuentos 1, 3).56 The different interpretations of the trickster pro posed by the authors cited above are hence applica ble to the fox in the oral traditions of the southern Central Andes. But an important problem emerges: the particular interpretations do not apply to all of the three fox tales. If the trickster-fox is only inter preted as a boundary-crosser, as which he appears in all three cuentos, there would be the following unre solvable difficulty: one would have to show that the spatial and categorical transgressions described in the tales are comparable to each other. For this rea 58. After throwing [the penis] away, the fox didn't come back. 59. Then this penis got lost. 60. Up to here is the cuento. 61. Thank you. son, an alternative and broader interpretation of the trickster-fox is proposed.57 The fox, always dissatisfied with the status quo, is said to generate all sorts of social conflicts. His transgressions of limits, his ambiguous character, his marginal status, his taboo-violating behavior, his lack of impulse control, his culture-heroic deeds, and failing shamanic flights are only facets that re flect the social conflictive character of the fox. In cuento 1 the fox lies to the condor, misbehaves when he is in heaven and thus breaks the promise he made to the condor. The latter, thereby enraged, leaves the fox alone in heaven. The fox insults the parrot, whereupon the latter also gets angry, cuts the cord, and so kills the fox. In cuento 2 the birds are deceived by the fox who wants to kill them. In the next episode of this cuen to, the duck, fearing that the fox deceives her, in turn and thereby, causes the death of the little foxes. The fox vows vengeance and threatens the duck to kill her. In the last episode of the tale, the straw, al though begged not to do this, pricks the fox where upon he explodes. In cuento 3 a woman cheats on her husband with the fox, then mutilates/castrates the latter and lies to her husband. A herdswoman tries to grind the fox' penis and the latter in turn violates the herdswoman and her daughter. To sum up, the fox can be interpreted as a pro tagonist whose role consists in (directly or indirect ly) creating a whole range of conflictive situations: insults, lies, threats, deception, mutilation, murder, and violation. 2.6 Interpretation of the Fox' Function 2.6.1 A Cognitive Perspective When, in a further step, asking for the reason of this role as a highly conflictive protagonist, another im portant point has to be considered: the cuentos ' per formance itself. The tales of the Quechua-speaking population in the southern Central Andes are con 53 Cf. footnote 41; cf. Ricketts (1966, 1993). 54 Cf. Boas (1969 [1898]); Brinton (1969 [1876]); Makarius (1993). 55 Cf. the Chipaya cuento, cited by Cerron-Palomino (2006: 285-291) concerning the fox in the role of a (failing) me diator. 56 Cf. Babcock-Abrahams (1975). Another Andean trickster fig ure, the Ukumari, or Juan Oso, or Juan del Oso (Taylor 1997: 348-352; Urton 1985: 270-272; Weber Ch. 1987), would fit much better than the fox in Babcock-Abrahams' interpreta tion of the trickster as a marginal figure. 57 The already existing interpretations of the trickster presented in this article and the interpretation that is proposed in the fol lowing paragraph are not mutually exclusive. Anthropos 107.2012</page><page sequence="12">492 Matthias Pache versational and dialogical (Mannheim 1999: 49). The performance of a tale requires an active partic ipation of the listener in form of verbal or nonverbal assent, repetition of the last phrase, or interruptions in between in order to ask questions or to add de tails (Mannheim and van Vleet 1998: 327; cf. also Fourtané 1997: 119). Questions are also asked if the listener already knows the cuento. How many questions are asked, or if any at all, this strongly depends on the person. But even in case a person does not ask questions re lating to the content of a cuento when listening to it, there is always a certain active participation of the listener. There are different reactions and comments of the listener, like "yes," "oh," or "and then?"58 Tell ing a cuento can, therefore, be understood as con versational and dialogical, and, in a broader sense, as a harmonious social interaction. In the context of an explanation of the world wide spreading of religious concepts, the cognitive anthropologist Pascal Boyer (1994, 1996) has pro posed the following theory: Modestly counterin tuitive representations that violate intuitive knowl edge about certain ontological categories (as e.g., supernatural beings that are not subject to physi cal or biological laws) are attention-demanding and, therefore, significantly easier to recall than ba nal or completely bizarre concepts. This recall ad vantage of counterintuitive representations favors their cultural transmission. The violation of intui tive knowledge can occur by two means: on the one hand, through so-called breaches of general native expectations (e.g., a living entity being able to pass solid objects), on the other hand, through the trans fer of properties from one ontological category to another (e.g., a nonliving object, like a rock, that is able to reproduce like a living being) (cf. also Bar rett 2008: 322-324, 335 f.). Some empirical research confirms Boyer's the ory.59 Up to now the cognitive advantage of coun terintuitive contents in stories has only been test ed concerning objects or persons with more or less counterintuitive features.60 Moreover, only few re searchers investigating the recall advantages of counterintuitive concepts (e.g., Gonce et al. 2006; Upala et al. 2007) have considered the variable "context" and if so, it has only been taken into ac count in a special sense. It was shown that previous expectation of intuitive or counterintuitive content or post hoc explanation of these contents strongly influenced their recall. If the results of research presented in the last two paragraphs are put together - on the one hand, the recall advantage of slightly counterintuitive con tents of stories, on the other hand, the fact that per formance of oral traditions can be understood as a harmonic social interaction - the following can be deduced: in the harmonious context of oral tradi tions an antisocial, conflictive protagonists is atten tion-demanding and, in a certain way, counterintui tive. The oral performance of tales as a harmonious social interaction thus contributes to a greater sa lience (and thereby better recall and easier cultural transmission) of conflictive contents. Results of current research in cognitive anthro pology hence gives a plausible explanation of the conflictive character of the fox in Andean cuentos, but also of the conflictive character of tricksters in general, or, from an even broader perspective, it ex plains the rather conflictive and brutal content of oral traditions in general like, for example, fairy tales (Grimm and Grimm 1937). Cognitive anthro pology would also account for the fact that trickster is above all a protagonist of oral traditions and only in a lesser degree of written literature (Hynes 1993a: 203 f.; cf. also Reesman 2001). To sum up, the fact that conflictive contents are preferred within oral traditions is certainly based on their greater salience. But there is no reason to re strict possible reasons for this only to human cog nitive architecture and its limited capacities which bring humans to concentrate on counterintuitive, attention-demanding contents. Another limitation that brings people to prefer salient, counterintuitive contents over banal contents is to be considered as well: the limitedness of the material on which cul tural representations are made. To every represen tation made, there are both spatial (ceramics, paper, textiles) and temporal restrictions (time to tell sto ries). Together with the limitedness of human cog nition, the limitedness of material might thus be an other reason for the relative overrepresentation of counterintuitive concepts in tales, newspapers, cin ema, etc. 2.6.2 A Social Perspective When, in a further step, going beyond the cognitive perspective in order to determine a social function of the trickster, the following - admittedly rather speculative - explanation seems appropriate: On the one hand, it is plausible that there is a certain identi 58 Pers. comm., 05.09.2006, Juan Condon Quispe. Similar phe nomena have been attested for oral traditions in other Native American cultures (cf. Burns 1980; Jacobs 1959). 59 Barrett and Nyhof (2001); Boyer and Ramble (2001); Upala et al.

Anthropos 107.2012</page><page sequence="13">The Fox in the Andes 493 fication of storyteller and listener with the trickster, the drives of the fox being very human (e.g., hun ger, sexuality, fear of injure). On the other hand, at the same time, the protagonists' mode of interaction sharply contrasts with the mode of interaction of storyteller and listener. This might suggest the lat ter in a subliminal way that they are in fact not at all like the fox, i.e., dissatisfied and antisocial. Telling fox (or trickster) stories would thus inter aha have the function to suggest man's satisfaction with the status quo and induce him to socially de sirable behavior. The simultaneously occurring sug gestion that storyteller and listener are not as stupid as the trickster might still increase the acceptance of a suggested satisfaction with the status quo and ac count for the trickster's silly character. The stupidity of the fox as a means of increasing the acceptance of the suggested satisfaction would explain, in the case of the central Andean cultures, why the fox as a pro tagonist of oral traditions appears as rather stupid, while as a wild animal and cattle thief he is mainly associated with cleverness and skill (cf. chap. 2.3).
