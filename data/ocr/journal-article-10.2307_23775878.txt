Miller, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, and approved April 3, 2014 (received for review February 24, 2014) The ability to implant electronic systems in the human body has led to many medical advances. Progress in semiconductor technol ogy paved the way for devices at the scale of a millimeter or less ("microimplants"), but the miniaturization of the power source remains challenging. Although wireless powering has been dem onstrated, energy transfer beyond superficial depths in tissue has so far been limited by large coils (at least a centimeter in diameter) unsuitable for a microimplant. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome by a method, termed midfield powering, to cre ate a high-energy density region deep in tissue inside of which the power-harvesting structure can be made extremely small. Unlike conventional near-field (inductively coupled) coils, for which cou pling is limited by exponential field decay, a patterned metal plate is used to induce spatially confined and adaptive energy transport through propagating modes in tissue. We use this method to power a microimplant (2 mm, 70 mg) capable of closed-chest wire less control of the heart that is orders of magnitude smaller than conventional pacemakers. With exposure levels below human safety thresholds, milliwatt levels of power can be transferred to a deep-tissue (&gt;5 cm) microimplant for both complex electronic function and physiological stimulation. The approach developed here should enable new generations of implantable systems that can be integrated into the body at minimal cost and risk. biomedical electronics microstimulator Progress in semiconductor technology has led to electronic devices that can augment or replace physiological functions; their ability to be implanted for direct interaction with organ systems relies on overall miniaturization of the device for sim plified delivery (e.g., via catheter or hypodermic needle) and access to interstitial spaces. Advances over the past few decades enable most components in a biomedical device, including elec trodes, oscillators, memory, and wireless communication systems, to be integrated on tiny silicon chips. However, the energy required for electronic function remains substantial and the consumption density has not been matched by existing powering technologies (1). As a result, the vast bulk of most implantable electronic devices consists of energy storage or harvesting components. Although considerable progress has been made in energy storage technologies, batteries remain a major obstacle to min iaturization (2, 3) because their lifetimes are limited and highly constrained by the available volume, requiring periodic surgical replacement once the unit is depleted. Energy-harvesting strat egies have been developed to eliminate batteries or to extend their function. Previous demonstrations include thermoelectric (4), piezoelectric (5-7), biopotential (8), or glucose (9,10) power extraction. However, these methods are anatomically specific and, in their existing forms, yield power densities too low (&lt;0.1 pW/mm2) for a microimplant. Alternatively, energy can be transferred from an external source. Ideally, power transfer should be completely noninvasive and not specific to regions in the body. Most existing approaches for this type of transfer are based on electromagnetic coupling in the near field (11-20). Though well-suited for large devices and prostheses (21, 22), near-field methods do not address key chal lenges to powering a microimplant: weak coupling between ex tremely asymmetric source and receiver structures (23), dissipative 7974-7979 | PNAS | June 3, 2014 | vol. 111 | no. 22 and heterogeneous tissue (24), and regulatory power thresholds for general safety (25). These challenges, compounded by the intrinsic exponential decay of the near field, severely limit mini aturization beyond superficial depths (&gt;1 cm), even if the battery can be removed. Theory has indicated that these problems can be overcome in the electromagnetic midfield (23): energy transfer in this region, defined to be about a wavelength's distance from the source, occurs through the coupling between evanescent fields in air and propagating modes in tissue. Using a patterned metal plate to control the near field, we demonstrate milliwatt levels of power transfer to a miniaturized coil deep in heterogeneous tissue (&gt;5 cm), with exposure levels below safety thresholds for humans; this enables us to power a microimplant capable of delivering controlled electrical pulses to nearly anywhere in the body. The device consists of a multiturn coil structure, rectifying circuits for AC/DC power conversion, a silicon-on-insulator integrated cir cuit (IC) for pulse control, and electrodes, entirely assembled within a 2-mm diameter, 3.5-mm height device small enough to fit inside a catheter. We demonstrate wireless function by op erating it in human-scale heart and brain environments, and by wirelessly regulating cardiac rhythm through a chest wall. Theory Since the first experiments in the 1960s (11), wireless powering for implantable electronics has primarily been based on coils coupled in the near field. Because quasi-static (nonradiative) magnetic fields mediate coupling, energy transfer through tissue is not sub stantially different from that in free space (20). Here, we describe a different approach in which a planar electromagnetic structure Significance Advances in miniaturization paved the way for tiny medical devices that circumvent conventional surgical implantation, but no suitable method for powering them deep in the body has been demonstrated. Existing methods for energy storage, harvesting, or transfer require large components that do not scale to millimeter dimensions. We report a wireless powering method that overcomes this challenge by inducing spatially focused and adaptive electromagnetic energy transport via propagating modes in tissue. We use the method to realize a tiny electrostimulator that is orders of magnitude smaller than conventional pacemakers. The demonstrated performance characteristics far exceed requirements for advanced electronic function and should enable new generations of miniaturized electronic implants.

PNAS I June 3, 2014 | vol.111 | no. 22 | 7975</page><page sequence="3">By exploring such global solutions across a range of frequencies with appropriate dispersion models for biological materials (24), we were able to establish optimal power transfer for the chest wall structure. The solution yields a highly oscillatory electric current density that forces the output field to converge on the microim plant (Fig. LB). Due to the high dielectric permittivity exhibited by biological materials at microwave frequencies, complete con trol of the propagating modes in tissue requires that the source "lens" affects evanescent wave components that lie outside of the light cone kj+kj&gt;kl (Fig. 1C). Coherent interference of these modes confines the field at the focal plane to subwavelength dimensions, with a spot size subject to the diffraction limit in a high-index material. Unlike conventional near-field coupling, energy from the midfield source is primarily carried in propa gating modes. As a result, the transport depth is limited by en vironmental losses rather than the intrinsic exponential decay of the near field. Theoretical studies have shown that energy transfer implemented with these characteristics can be 2-3 orders of mag nitude more efficient than near-field systems (23, 26). Alternatively, for a given efficiency, the characteristic size of the coil can be made an order of magnitude smaller despite its depth in tissue (Fig. SI). The implementation of such a lensing source, however, requires electromagnetic structures more complex than conventional coil or dipole elements (27, 28). Experimental Realization Our physical realization of midfield powering consists of a metal plate patterned with slot structures and excited by four in dependent radiofrequency ports (Fig. 24 and Materials and Methods). For appropriate phases between the port signals, the slot-array structure generates circular current paths that approx imate the optimal current density (23). When positioned above tissue, the structure couples power from the external circuitry into the tissue volume with high efficiency (&gt;90%), as evidenced by both low levels of backside radiation and a pronounced minimum in the scattering spectrum (Fig. S2B). Analysis of the fields on the surface of the skin shows that the evanescent spectrum approx imates the theoretical optimum (Fig. 2S), although the contribution of the radiative modes is ~2x greater owing to the inherent di rectionality of the planar structure. Regardless, when transferring power to a device submerged in a liquid solution with dielectric properties mimicking muscle tissue, experimental and numerical studies show that the design obtains efficiencies within 10% of the theoretical bound (Fig. 2C). At the scale of a microimplant, standard methods for electrical measurements are unsuitable because of coupling with con ductive wire probes. We instead developed a custom integrated probe that separates the powering and measurement modalities by encoding the electrical power level into the frequency of optical pulses. The probe consists of a tiny power-harvesting coil (2 mm diameter) with terminals connecting to a circuit load configured with a rectifier, a microelectronic pulse control unit, and a light-emitting diode (LED; Fig. 2 D and E). A represen tative device with a yellow LED is shown in Fig. 2D inside a 10 French (~3.3 mm) catheter sheath for size reference. An optical fiber guides light to a terminating photodiode at the measure ment location. We were able to calculate the power transferred to the coil, calibrated for circuit-dependent inefficiencies, by recording the end-to-end power levels at multiple reference flash rates.

Results We evaluate the performance of our powering system in complex tissue geometries by designing two configurations that simulate power transfer to devices in the left ventricle of the heart and the cortex region of the brain. The source and device positions within a porcine tissue volume, shown in Fig. 3 A and B using MRI reconstructions, are separated by at least 5 cm. When coupling 500 mW into tissue (approximately the output power of cell phones), we measured the power transferred to the coil to be 195 pW for the heart and 200 pW for the brain configurations. These levels are far greater than requirements for advanced in tegrated circuits (Table SI); in comparison, cardiac pacemakers consume ~8 pW (1, 29).

Conclusion We have demonstrated a wireless powering method that can power microimplants at nearly any location in the body. Because the performance characteristics shown here far exceed requirements for integrated technologies (optoelectronics, microelectromechanical systems sensors, and logic units), there are considerable possi bilities for new generations of microimplants: the size, for exam ple, can be further reduced to micrometer scales (23) or more sophisticated functions implemented, such as real-time moni toring of chronic disease states or closed-loop neural sensing and control. Future systems may also incorporate a small recharge able battery to enable continuous operation without an exter nally worn power source. These capabilities should substantially increase the viability of implanting electronics in living systems. Materials and Methods Numerical Methods.

Peaks in the autocorrelation function are marked with squares. function because the plane-wave components are eigenfunctions of propaga tion in the multilayer structure. At each depth z, for example, we apply a dyad GH(ky,ky,z) to calculate the magnetic field H(kx,ky,z) = GH(kx,ky,z)}c(kx,ky). An inverse Fourier transform yields the fields at each depth. The fields in Fig. 4A were calculated using a commercial electromagnetic simulator (CST Studio Suite; Computer Simulation Technology). The patterned metal plate was placed above a tissue multilayer (1-cm air gap, 4-mm skin, 8-mm fat, 8-mm muscle, 16-mm bone, 144-mm heart) and the fields calculated by a time-domain solver. A similar simulation setup—with tissue layers simplified to a slab with the di electric properties of the liquid solution (0.5% saline)—was used to obtain the simulation curve in Fig. 2C. The port phases were reconfigured at each depth to maximize power transfer. Electromagnetic Region of Operation. To select the frequency of operation, theoretical efficiency vs. frequency curves were generated by solving for the optimal 1/ in a multilayer model of tissue (1-cm air gap, 4-mm skin, 8-mm fat, 8-mm muscle, 1-mm bone, cx&gt; heart) across a wide search range (10 MFIz to 4 GFIz) for coils oriented in the x and z directions (23). Fig. 1A shows the magnetic field component Hx at 1.6 GHz. The upper frequency bound is selected to be about the self-resonance frequency of the coil. The coil losses were taken into account using an analytical model for a loop of wire em bedded in uniform tissue, as well as impedance matching by imposing the constraint Q&lt;10, where 0 is the quality factor (30). Using the Debye dis persion model for each tissue type (24), the peak efficiency was found to occur at 1.6 GHz. Because each efficiency is the maximum that can be obtained by any implementation of the source, we concluded that 1.6 GHz is the optimal frequency for this configuration. Source Design. The midfield source realization consists of a patterned metal structure excited at four ports with rf signals of controlled phases (Fig. S2A). The plate was fabricated on a 1,6-mm FR4 substrate with feed and patterned copper layers. Semirigid coaxial cables were used to connect each excitation port to the control board. An rf signal at 1.6 GHz was brought from the signal generator to the control board and then separated to four lines using a Wilkinson power divider. Following power division, the signals were con nected to parallel stages for variable attenuation, phase shifting (analog 400°, +3.5/-2.0° error), and amplification (gain 14 dB). The phase shifters are 7978 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1403002111 voltage controlled and adjusted using a National Instruments 9264 CompactDAQ module via LabVIEW. Probe Design. The probe consists of a receiving coil, rectifier, charge pump, flash control integrated circuit, and an LED (Fig. 2D). The coil was wound with an inner diameter of 2 mm using copper wire (200 urn diameter), with variable number of turns (between 1 and 15) depending on the design frequency. For the rectifier circuit, two Schottky diodes (Skyworks SMS7630 series) and two 10-nF capacitors were arranged in a charge pump configu ration. At low frequencies, an additional capacitor was used to match the impedance of the coil and the rectifier. A charge pump and flash control integrated circuit was placed after the rectifier for upconverting the recti fied voltage to the 2.0 V necessary to drive the LED. Charge was stored on a discrete 4.7-pF capacitor, and discharged through the LED (ROHM PICOLED) when a specified threshold voltage was reached. The entire probe was en capsulated in epoxy, connected to an optical fiber for power information readout. The minimum power to operate the device is ~10 pW. All compo nents were bonded to a printed circuit board of Rogers 4350 substrate. Efficiency Calibration. The efficiency of power transfer was experimentally measured with the probe in Fig. 2£. To calibrate for the circuit losses, which are substantial (&gt; 50%) in the design, the nonlinear behavior of the circuitry was exploited to form a set of linearly independent equations from which unknown coil parameters can be solved. This system of equations was obtained by considering the circuit in Fig. S3 A where the coil is represented by an inductance (Lc), in series with a resistance (Rc) and a voltage source (Vc), where the latter two parameters are unknown. The nonlinear circuit was characterized at two reference pulse rates, n and r2, by finding the corresponding pseudoimpedances ZRn := when the circuit is at res onance. The corresponding amplitudes ln,n and V^n were found using har monic balance analysis with commercial circuit design tools (Advanced Design Systems; Agilent). From the reduced circuit in Fig. S36, we obtained the following equations by a straightforward application of Kirchhoff's voltage law: l/c,n = (fic+Z«1n)'c,n for n=1,2. The two equations are linearly independent if the reference rates correspond to operation in a nonlinear region of the circuit. For each powering configuration, an additional equation was obtained by adjusting the power level at the source until the observed pulse rate equals r-i and r2. Recording the two reference power levels Ps, 1 and Ps,2, an Ho et al.</page><page sequence="6">additional equation Vc,2/^,1 = \j'Ps.2 / Ps.\ was obtained, permitting the un- Probe Trajectory Visualization. A power measurement device was attached to known parameters Vc,n and Rc to be solved. The efficiency was then found by the end of a fiber optic cable and submerged in a liquid solution (0.5% saline), directly calculating r\= \Vc,n\2 /SRcPs.n- When including intermediate circuit los- a custom-built 3D positioner (LEGO Mindstorms) moved the device in an ses, the efficiency in Fig. 3 A and B was reduced by a factor of ~2, depending on S-shaped trajectory. A photo sequence was obtained in a dark room with 1/2-s environmental loading effects. The power flowing through the pulse control exposure every 5 s while the device was in motion. The entire S-shaped path units was measured to be 90 pW and 82.5 pW for the body and head was completed in 20 min.
