Mactoux. (Centre de Re- cherches d'Histoire Ancienne 68.1; Annales Litt&amp;- raires de l'Universite de Besangon 329.) Pp. 607. Les Belles Lettres, Paris 1986. This collection of 26 papers, presented at the University of Besangon in 1984 and covering four main topics (Plu- rality and Polytheisms, Divine Figures, Heroic Figures, and Imperial Figures), examines the ways in which polytheistic structures reflect historical and social realities. In the first section J. Naudou describes the tension be- tween singularity and multiplicity in the Rig Veda; P. Brule' constructs a typology for modes of multiplication in Greek polytheism (using the daughters of Kekrops as an example for analysis); and P. Lveique, concerned with principles of grouping Greek divinities, argues that the basic groups re- flect earlier Neolithic concerns with the definition of the community, the relation between male and female, and the establishment of the institution of marriage. We are on more familiar ground in the second section where F. Dunand, rejecting Frazer's notion of progress from theriomorphism to anthropomorphism in Egyptian cult, uses Sobek to illustrate that the crocodile image is incorporated into representations of this god in all periods of Egyptian history. P. Debord examines the epigraphical evi- dence for the relation between Artemis/Meter Anaitis and the Persian Anahita in northeast Lydia. He argues that later syncretism with an imported Persian figure does not con- tradict a local Lydian origin for the figure known as (Mu- -rip) 'AVieLLrt. His interpretation has implications for the much disputed origin of the god Men with whom Anaitis is often coupled. 0. Longo attempts to construct a Dionysiac theology from Euripides, Bacchae 274-83, and with only Pausanias as a source, relates it to a reconstruction of the worship of Dionysos at Thebes. This section concludes with three articles on different epithets of Artemis (by G. Mi- roux, C. Montepaone, and E. Lepore). The most ambitious presentations are found in the sec- tion on heroic figures. S. Carvalho uses cross-cultural com- parisons to explain the nature of mythic twins (e.g., the Greek Castor and Pollux) as link between the human and animal realms (note their birth from eggs) and as a reflec- tion of the concerns of the hunting and gathering societies where this type often seems to have originated. While this explanation may work for the non-Greek societies examined here, it does not take into account the particularly Greek development with its emphasis on the divine nature of this pair and their consequent importance as savior gods. C. Brillante argues for hero cult in the Mycenaean period on the basis of a rather problematic interpretation of ti-ri- se-ro-e on Tn316 (as a Mycenaean hero) and di-pi-si-joi on Fr1204 (as "the thirsty dead"). He couples these readings with evidence for votive deposits in the dromoi of Myce- naean tholos tombs and evidence for bothroi in Grave Circle A at Mycenae. There are problems with these arguments, in particular a failure to acknowledge the difference between possible offerings at tombs in the Mycenaean period and the fully articulated hero cult of the Archaic period. J.-C. Car- riere relates Hesiod's myth of the five ages to the historical context of the developing polis and shows how there is in- tertwined with the idea of degeneration a Hesiodic vision of political evolution in the rest of Works and Days, where the epic eris of war is reinterpreted in terms of peace as com- petition between equals and as competition between rich and poor. P. Scarpi distinguishes between founder gods and culture heroes and argues that at Athens the location of cult places to Athena, Hephaistos, and Prometheus indicates a hier- archy of prestige. He interprets an ambivalence about cul- ture heroes as an ambivalence about technological develop- ment itself. C. Jourdain-Annequin uses literary sources to show how Herakles was associated in cult with places of exercise and sanctuaries outside the city and argues that be- cause Herakles was associated with rites of separation when young boys became ephebes, myths of Herakles as hunter played a pedagogical role, providing a model for the ephebes taken to border areas to learn the use of weapons. N. Va- lenza-Mele's article collects images from vase painting to distinguish good centaurs (who serve as guides for the matu- ration process of young men) from bad centaurs (who rep- resent a challenge to the adult male community). A.-F. Lau- rens also examines the imagery of vase painting and uses a semiotic approach to argue for semantic consistency in the Athenian iconography of Theseus and Erichthonios. She ex- plains the scene of Bologna inv.

A. Bresson, noticing structural similarities in myths of col- ony foundation, explains the killing of a father figure in these myths as a solution to the problems of succession and separation of the colony from the parent city. In the concluding section on imperial figures, P. Briant uses epigraphical evidence to argue that the spread of Persian divinities westward to Asia Minor does not conflict with the literary evidence for Persian toleration of indigenous cults in conquered territory, but was the result of the dispersal of Persian communities to new areas of the Empire. Three of the concluding articles deal with the creation of Roman im- perial ideology. R. Etienne traces the shift in Roman con- cepts of imperial aeternitas from the first through the fourth centuries. E. Smadja argues from the formulae of dedications in N. Africa in the second and third centuries that the concept of victory and its relation to the emperor underwent impor- tant changes. She explains the high concentration of dedica- tions to Victoria in North Africa by the military aggression necessary to keep local populations in check, especially in Mauretania. M.-C. L'Huillier, drawing on work of Barthes and Marin, analyzes Latin panegyrics from Gaul to examine the fluid relationship between rhetoric (parole) and political power in the third and fourth centuries. She concentrates on five panegyrics in honor of Constantine to show how the de- velopment of imperial theology accommodated the legitimi- zation of Christianity. The collection as a whole illustrates a variety of tradi- tional and innovative approaches to the material, presenting structural analysis of literary texts, semiotic analysis of icon- ography and cultural systems, theoretical models drawn from other disciplines, as well as straightforward empirical discussions of archaeological and epigraphical evidence.
