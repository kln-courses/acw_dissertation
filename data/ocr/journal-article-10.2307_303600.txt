<plain_text><page sequence="1">Responsibility Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak Responsibility annuls the call to which it seeks to respond. What is it, then, to be responsible to a changeful thought on the question of responsibility? "[W]hat could be the responsibility ... [toward] a consistent discourse which claimed to show that no responsibility could ever be taken without equivocation and without contradiction?"1 To open an essay with such a question is perhaps already to betray the ideal of academic responsibility in which one was trained. That ideal was to give an objective account of an argument with textual demonstrations, and sub- sequently to evaluate it, on its own terms as well as by the standards of an impartial judgment. By comparison with the imperatives of that austere responsibility, the first years of this writer's teaching career, which began in 1965, seemed to be haunted by demands of an extreme irresponsibility toward the impersonality of history and augury: "Do we like it?" "Is that relevant to us?" and then, "to me?" 1.

For it is, first, to show that one is already partisan, and, secondly, it is to reveal that one's anxiety is for one's responsibility to the text, not the other way around. Yet, is there not something like a resemblance between those imperatives-requiring ob- jectivity toward, or relevance from, the text-and my opening question? For have we not guessed that the early lesson of disinterested objectivity was, in fact, an unacknowledged partisanship to a sort of universalist human- ism which dictated that one show, even if by the way and by default, that the literary or philosophical text in general is good. And as for the other, does one not, given the current demand for the justification of an interest in "deconstructive philosophical speculation" in a politically inclined female migrant, demonstrate again and again its relevance to such inclinations and such provenance? How, then, to be responsible to the warning for: a community of well-meaning deconstructionists, reassured and rec- onciled with the world in ethical certainty, good conscience, satis- faction of services rendered, and the consciousness of duty accom- plished (or more heroically still, yet to be accomplished)?2 or to the reminder that it is especially when the philosopher-or anyone- tries and tries to explain and reveal, and the respondent tries and tries to receive the explanation and the revelation, that the something that must of necessity not go through is the secret and changeable "essence" of that exchange? Perhaps there is no answer to this question but the constant attempt "to let oneself be approached by the resistance which the thinking of re- sponsibility may offer thought."3 Perhaps to be responsible to the question of responsibility is not to resist what will have happened, that the reader(s) will have judged, necessarily with, and in spite of, standards, necessarily re- lated and different. In this the thought of responsibility is a more affirmative formulation of what was written thirty years ago: "[T]hought is ... the blank 2. Derrida, "Passions," 15.

For this reader, the difficult giving of permission to be approached by that which most resists thought is susceptible to a literal translation (with all the necessity and impossibility that translation calls for and by which it is called).5 This specific "translation," in this essay, takes off from a literal understanding of statements such as the following: [T]hese new responsibilities cannot be purely academic. ... Be- tween ... [the principle of reason and an-archy] ... only the setting- to-work [mise-en-oeuvre] of this "thought" can decide.... To claim to eliminate that risk by an institutional program is quite simply to erect a barricade against a future.6 One attempts, then, to set the thought of responsibility to work in ways that are not purely academic. The peculiar (con)textualities of the the- aters where each of these attempts is made inscribe an experience of the necessity of such translations and their impossibility. These experiences also teach how conservative it is to remain content with radical institutional programs. Not being a philosopher by talent and training, I cannot philoso- phize the delicate ruptures involved in the brutality of these literal transla- tions. That more profound speculation would look upon the night of non- knowledge and non-rule in which all decisions are taken, even when it is the most detailed knowledge that has been set most responsibly to work.

The space of this essay may be distinguished from those more perilous watches as the quicker tempo of the eve and the morning- after of that night, the night of non-knowledge, when a just decision tears time, the time of effect following just cause.7 What the two spaces share is that "the limit of . . . [the] formalization ... [of a problematic is] a sort of intermediary stage."8 This is perhaps one way of being responsible to the thinking of re- sponsibility, that whatever is formalizable remains in a sort of intermediary stage. The rest cannot be purely formalized. These steps must be formally taken and experienced as limits before the usual beginnings can be made. Full formalization itself must be seen not as impossible but as an experi- ence of the impossible, or a figure for the impossible, which may be to say the "same thing."9 I can formalize responsibility in the following way: It is that all action is undertaken in response to a call (or something that seems to us to re- semble a call) that cannot be grasped as such. Response here involves not only "respond to," as in "give an answer to," but also the related situations of "answering to," as in being responsible for a name (this brings up the question of the relationship between being responsible for/to ourselves and for/to others); of being answerable for, all of which Derrida presents within the play, in French, between repondre a and repondre de. It is also, when it is possible for the other to be face-to-face, the task and lesson of attending to her response so that it can draw forth one's own. (I believe both Derrida and Luce Irigaray have seen the psychoanalytic model at its impossible best to accede to this sense of responsibility.)10 7.

My readings will insist that (the thinking of) responsibility is also (a thinking of) contamination. If one will, then, seem to have shown that deconstruction is relevant to what is called the political sphere, after all, it will be the moment to ask you to remember that such demonstrations can only happen within the intermediary stage. 1. Of Spirit: Heidegger and the Question Of all the texts of Derrida that I have read, this seems to me to be the one that assumes in the reader a careful and intimate reading of all the texts on method that have come before, a familiarity with a special- ized vocabulary that might otherwise seem deceptively "metaphorical" or transparent. It is, therefore, a "secretive" text, both in the colloquial, and in the Derridian, sense. In the first sense, because it seems to guard its own secret, it is difficult to understand. (To a careless speed-reader, it will even provide confirmation of stock responses.) In the second sense, because, even though to the responsive reader, the text wishes to reveal itself to the full, it still seems to leave the reader with questions. There is nothing authorized about the reading I offer below, and especially about the "rea- sons" that I submit for the secretiveness of the text. Indeed, I have not tried to pry out the secret by referring to less secretive writings by Derrida on the Heidegger question. The secrecy of the secret does not disappear with revelation. "The secret never allows itself to be captured or covered over by the relation to the other, by being-with or by any form of 'social bond.'... No responsiveness." 12 One of the reasons for the "secretiveness" may be the impossibility of a fully justified position of accusation. of Psychoanalysis," in Margaret Whitford, ed., The Irigaray Reader (London: Blackwell, 1991), 105-17, 83-84. 11.

In Being and Time, Heidegger had found it prudent to keep the question of the spirit open, broachable only within quotation marks, if at all.13 Already in the opening pages of his text, Derrida suggests that, in fact, Heidegger's entire earlier philosophy was de- pendent upon a question of the spirit that was merely avoided or foreclosed. The spirit works away at the text, finally to emerge with a terrifying role, perhaps precisely because its question had been avoided. Toward the end of section 5, Derrida demonstrates this with reference to the Rectoral Ad- dress 14: "[S]uddenly, with a single blow ..., the lifting of the quotation marks marks the raising of the curtain .... [T]he entry on stage of spirit itself.... Six years later, and here we have the Rectorship Address" (OS, 31; I take responsibility for extrapolating from this closely orchestrated prose). Here, for the first time, Derrida writes, Heidegger defines spirit. The definition is not in contradiction with Being and Time, for spirit still does not seem to belong to subjectity, "at least in its psychical or egological form" (OS, 37). We are not speaking, in other words, of the human spirit, even in the most metaphysical sense. Thus, by appealing to such a "spiritual force," unattached to the merely human, the address may seem ... no longer to belong simply to the "ideological" camp in which one appeals to obscure forces-forces which would not be spiritual but natural, biological, racial, according to an anything but spiritual interpretation of "earth and blood." (OS, 39) But, and this is why we must proceed cautiously, every comparable gesture turns back "against its 'subject' "-against, if I may say so, its agent, for "one must . . . use this word, in fact. . . . Because one cannot demar- cate oneself from biologism, from racism in its genetic form, one cannot be opposed to them except by reinscribing spirit in an oppositional determi- nation" (OS, 39). Thus, one binds the philosophical a-partness of spirit by determining it into a narrow sense as that which is the opposite of biologism or genetic racism. It loses its (non)character of guarding question. Hence, it no longer remains prior to-or outside of-all differences between sub- 13. Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, trans.

It belongs to the subject(s) who rallies (or rally) in its name. It becomes negotiable. It is made to take a side and thus becomes unilateral. Thus, reinscribing spirit in an oppositional demarcation, ... once again mak[es] it a unilaterality of subjectity, even if [especially?] in its volun- tarist form. This constraint ... reigns over the majority of discourses which, today and for a long time [he cannot say forever] to come, state their opposition to racism, to totalitarianism, to nazism, to fas- cism, etc., and do this in the name of an axiomatic-for example, that of democracy or "human rights"-which, directly or not, comes back to this metaphysics of subjectity. .... The only choice is the choice between the terrifying contaminations it assigns. Even if all forms of complicity are not equivalent, they are irreducible. The question of knowing which is the least grave of these forms of complicity is always there-its urgency and its seriousness could not be over- stressed-but it will never dissolve the irreducibility of this fact.... [I]t calls more than ever, as for what in it remains to come after the disasters that have happened, for absolutely unprecedented respon- sibilities of "thought" and "action." (OS, 39-40) I have quoted this passage at such length because it should be read carefully and slowly. No academic eager to take sides (in "thought") cleanly without any "active" responsibility wants to acknowledge the final and irreducible complicity between all unilateral binding of the spirit in a single cause. And all sustained "activists" know that victories are warnings, without being able to articulate it philosophically, and often silencing that knowledge in the interest of the decision. Derrida attempts to deconstruct that gap. It is not that we must not take sides. We must continue to know, and to make known, "which is the least grave of these forms of complicity." It is just that the decisive testing of the intellectually clear "thought"-which can construct systemic ways and means of avoiding logical risks through the fine-tuning of knowledge-must therefore be in "action," the element of which is the risky night of non-knowledge. This is a position against the vanguardism of theory, not against risk-taking. It is not heroic enough for armchair left liberals. But for those of us who have seen Gandhi's Ram- Rcjya (the kingdom of Rama), where, to give Gandhi the benefit of a doubt that he perhaps did not fully deserve, Rama was a nomination of the spirit of indigenous democracy, become the excuse for a state on the brink of a fascism committed to the genocide of Muslims; and who have seen Marx's</page><page sequence="8">26 boundary 2 / Fall 1994 project of the proletarian's collective use of reason (class-consciousness), where rationality is the nomination of the human spirit, become an imperi- alism that, in postcoloniality, hankers after an underdeveloped capitalism as an alternative to genocide; and for those of us who daily see the covert and overt violence regularly practiced by the ideological and systemic ma- nipulation of rational principles, such as due process, human rights, and democracy-these warnings must be taken seriously. We cannot neces- sarily assume, however implicitly, that the European-style invocation of spirit is uncontaminated, whereas other invocations of spirit are by definition ignorant or fundamentalist.15 The passage I have quoted is hard to under- stand only if the lessons of history ("the disasters that have happened") have not been heeded. Indeed, inspirational academic heroics must resist understanding here. The implacable logic of the terrifying contamination is doing its supplementary labor in these becomings, these happenings. A "responsible" thought describes "responsibility"-caught in a question necessarily begged in action-as attending to the call of that irreducible fact. This is a practical position, an elaboration of the earlier position that, in effect, practice norms theory.16 15. I have discussed this at greater length in "A Critique of Multiculturalism," a paper pre- sented at the Nordic Conference on "Social Movements in the Third World: Economy, Politics, and Culture," forthcoming in an anthology on multiculturalism edited by Thomas Keenan, to whom my thanks for an astute first reading of this essay, and for insisting that I spell out my surreptitious argument on contamination. 16. This statement is shorthand for the position that can be developed from passages such as the following: "No constituted logic nor any rule of a logical order can, therefore, provide a decision or impose its norms upon these prelogical possibilities of logic ... They are (topologically) [since the "'structural unconscious'... is absolutely excluded" by the sort of inspirational academic heroics I describe, this "metapsychological" notion may be incomprehensible] alien to it, but not as its .. .'radical' foundation; for the structure of iterability [alteration in every practice, including theoretical utterance] divides and guts such radicality. . . '[T]heory' is compelled to reproduce, to reduplicate, in itself the law of its object or its object as law; it must submit to the norm it purports to analyze" (Jacques Derrida, Limited Inc., ed. Gerald Graff [Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1988], 93, [741, 97). Luce Irigaray's formulation, with reference to psychoanalysis as theoretical system, is useful for us here: "Will you object that we would be straying into the realm of anything goes? Then you are admitting that you have forgotten that any living body, any unconscious, any psychical economy brings its order to analysis. All you have to do is listen. But an order with the force of an a priori law prevents you" (Irigaray, "Poverty of Psychoanalysis," 83-84). For a discussion of body/unconscious/drive-instinct economy and psychoanalysis as system, I take the liberty of directing the reader's attention to my "Love," under consideration with American Imago.</page><page sequence="9">Spivak / Responsibility 27 As a practical academic, it is my unauthorized conviction that it is because of this academic resistance to acknowledgment of complicity that Derrida writes this most painful text in a language that must be learned: in other words, it may be accessible to a reading that is responsible to the text. (The steps of such a reading are laid out in Paul Celan's search for Lenz embedded in "Shibboleth.") But why is this text painful? I think because in a sense more re- stricted than the general position outlined above, deconstruction cannot not acknowledge complicity with Heidegger. Precisely because of "respon- sibility," Derrida cannot, and indeed will not, unlike Richard Rorty, simply separate the man from the work.'7 I have been arguing, in a certain way, that Derrida's is "a teaching language." And indeed that is what Derrida says of the Heidegger of the Rectoral Address: Here we have a teaching language .... No more than in 1933 does it rehabilitate the concept of spirit deconstructed in Sein und Zeit. But it is still in the name of the spirit, the spirit that guides in resolution toward the question, the will to know and the will to essence, that the other spirit, its bad double, the phantom of subjectivity, turns out to be warded off by means of Destruktion. (OS, 41) I have been spelling out so far that, according to Derrida, the phan- tom of subjectity cannot be warded off. Indeed, that is the responsibility Heidegger gives up and thus moves relentlessly toward unilaterality. This unilaterality has a bad trajectory, because the philosophy of Destruktion cannot be used to ward off accountability, answerability, responsibility as repondre de.18 It can only ever be a reminder of its open-ended and irre- ducible risk. You will remember that between the journal and the book-form pub- lication of De la grammatologie, Derrida changed the word destruction to deconstruction. Heidegger's case demonstrates why Destruktion (as task) must not be used to ward off responsibility but rather (as event) must be acknowledged as a reminder of how we are written. Unable as we are 17. Richard Rorty, "Taking Philosophy Seriously," New Republic, 11 Apr. 1988, 31-34. 18. Since many positions against deconstruction are based on hearsay, this is the most common accusation brought against it. In the New York Times Book Review, for ex- ample, Walter Reich casually remarks that the denial of the Holocaust owes something to "a number of current assumptions, increasingly popular in academia, regarding the indeterminacy of truth" ("Erasing the Holocaust," New York Times Book Review, 11 July 1993, 34).</page><page sequence="10">28 boundary 2 / Fall 1994 (and should be) not to take sides, Derrida is therefore also speaking of the folly of "doing" deconstruction as if it were fully under our control. (This, of course, also relates to the conviction that the decisive ethico-political evaluation of thought is not self-contained but is in its setting-to-work.) In other words, paradoxically (impossibly), yet necessarily, in the setting-to- work, deconstruction may be bound to good or bad uses. This is the double bind of deconstruction, its peculiar humility, responsibility, and strength; its acknowledgment of radical contamination. It can be undertaken by some- one who has learned it to philosophize with it, against philosophy. Even "knowing" it is not enough, just as knowing the rules of a card game does not mean that you have learned to play it well. Deconstruction is caught be- tween the high rollers of the establishment who, without the patience or the training to read the material carefully, congratulate themselves on having discovered its lack of moral muscle; and the "defenders": those who claim it learnedly for philosophy, disowning its dependence on the un-philosophical or diagnosing the latter as simply literature; and those who do "correct politics" with it.19 But Nazism is a consequence that requires a careful reckoning of the lesson of deconstruction; not a denunciation that will please academics, but also not a defense that will endorse the two different kinds of defenders. It is in this position that Derrida writes for those who will read with care. We must not forget that the object of his investigation is still a speech that is given at a university, and the point of his critique is that Destruktion cannot be used to ward off the dangers of the necessarily unilateral subject. Be- fore we pursue the critique further, it might therefore be pertinent to quote 19. And, if it is "literature," it is where literature also is given over to its other, however the (con)text would limit it. This note is sounded all through Derrida's work. A recent ar- ticulation: "Suppose we knew what literature is ... we still could not be sure that it is literary through and through [de part en part].... Nor could we be sure that this decon- structive structure cannot be found in other texts that we would not dream of considering as literary. I am convinced that the same structure, however paradoxical it may seem, also turns up in scientific and especially juridical utterances, and indeed can be found in the most foundational or institutive ones.... In the suggestion that a deconstruction of metaphysics is impossible 'to the precise extent that it is "literary,"' I suspect there may be more irony than first appears. .... For a deconstructive operation possibility, becoming an available set of rule-governed procedures, methods, accessible approaches would rather be the danger" (Derrida, "Invention of the Other," in Attridge, Acts of Literature, 327, 328; translation modified. The embedded quotation is from Paul de Man, Allegories of Reading: Figural Language in Rousseau, Nietzsche, Rilke, and Proust [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979], 131).</page><page sequence="11">Spivak / Responsibility 29 another statement of it in a speech given by Derrida himself at Colum- bia University, where he spoke of the responsibility of the academic in a modern university, necessarily imbricated with the structures of a postin- dustrial managerial society: "One can doubtless decenter the subject, as is easily said, without retesting the bond between, on the one hand, respon- sibility, and, on the other, freedom of subjective consciousness or purity of intentionality."20 Heidegger, in using Destruktion as if he could control it, bypasses this challenge with murderous consequences. The armchair deconstructor, decentering his or her subject at will, denies the [prior] axiomatics en bloc and keeps it going as a survivor, with minor adjustments de rigueur and daily compromises lacking in rigor. So coping, so operating, at top speed, one accounts and becomes accountable for nothing: not for what happens, not for the reasons to continue assuming responsibilities without a concept. How would it be if a fully deconstructive or destruktiv text could be produced? Its surface would be "given over to ... an animal machine ... a figure of evil" (OS, 134). Let us pursue this enigmatic pronouncement. In the section that follows the passages we have been reading, Derrida reads Heidegger as the latter names the animal, and exposes a humanist teleology for Heidegger's "deconstruction of ontology" (OS, 57).21 20. Jacques Derrida, "Mochlos; or, The Conflict of the Faculties," in Richard Rand, ed., Logomachia: The Conflict of the Faculties (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1993), 11. The next quoted passage is from the same page. This passage is also worth consid- ering, because, three pages before this passage, Derrida brings up Heidegger's Rectoral Address, offers a short analysis, and remarks: "I cannot explore this path today" (8). I believe the exploration in Of Spirit leads him to a different conclusion from the one offered in "Mochlos." 21. Of Spirit takes up a question that was first put forward in 1968 ("Ends of Man," in Jacques Derrida, Margins of Philosophy, trans. Alan Bass [Chicago: University of Chi- cago Press], 1982): "The 'destruction' of metaphysics or of classical ontology was even directed against humanism .... [But, t]he subtlety and equivocality of this gesture [of a return to man], then, are what appear to have authorized all the anthropologistic defor- mations in the reading of Sein und Zeit" (118, 127). Of Spirit makes Heidegger himself also responsible for such a "deformation." Further, "[i]n the thinking and the language of Being, the end of man has been prescribed since always . .. in the play of telos and death" (134). As we have seen, in Of Spirit, death in Heidegger is seen to be without a semantic content. "Are we to understand the eve as the guard mounted around the house or as the awakening to the day that is coming, at whose eve we are? Is there an economy of the eve?" (136). The economy of the eve is a responsibility that must annul the call even as it recalls it in a "link without link [lien sans lien] of a bind and a non-bind"</page><page sequence="12">30 boundary 2 / Fall 1994 Let us focus on the comment on that most Heideggerian/Derridian gesture, the "sous rature."22 It might be thought of as a gesture of ward- ing off-keeping a thing visible but crossed out, to avoid universalizing or monumentalizing it. As we have been reading it, this gesture can only be used (indeed must be performed in deconstruction as task in view of de- construction as event) in the form of a warning of an irreducibility outside of intentional control, rather than a controlled gesture of saving oneself from the worst consequences of that irreducibility; as in Heidegger's im- plicit reliance upon Destruktion in the Rectoral Address.23 The gesture in Heidegger's Zur Seinsfrage seems not inconsonant with this: Heidegger proposes to write the word Being under a line of era- sure in the form of a cross (kreuzweise Durchstreichung). This cross did not represent either a negative sign or even a sign at all, but it was supposed to recall the Geviert, the fourfold, precisely, as "the play of the world" ... [which]-recalled in this way by an erasing of "Being"-[allows the decipherment of] the becoming-world of the world. ... It means in this case that one cannot derive or think the world starting from anything else but it. But look at this other propo- sition of crossing-through (Durchstreichung) from twenty-five years earlier. (OS, 52) And we flashback to the animal. I will attempt the daunting task of summa- rizing Derrida's itinerary. Derrida deduces a certain "anthropomorphic or even humanist tele- ology" in the thinking of Dasein in view of the difference between "the (Derrida, Given Time, 27). And finally, "[i]s not this security [of 'Being is the nearest'] what is trembling today ... [and t]his trembling is played out in the violent relation of the whole of the West to its other, whether a 'linguistic' relationship . . ,or ethnological, economic, political, military, relationships, etc.... It is precisely the force and the efficiency of the system that regularly change the transgression into 'false exits' " (133, 134-35). 22. I should perhaps mention that Henry Staten (Wittgenstein and Derrida [Lincoln: Uni- versity of Nebraska Press, 1984]) had mentioned to me in conversation that, upon being asked his opinion of my introduction to Of Grammatology (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Uni- versity Press, 1976), Derrida had said that I had overemphasized the "sous rature." This entire discussion might therefore be marked by a peculiar excess, in its own way a failure and a feature of my responsibility. 23. This tone, as far as I know, was sounded by Derrida only once, when speaking to the Soci6te frangaise de philosophie in 1968: "1 have attempted to indicate a way out of this framework via the 'trace,' which is no more an effect than it has a cause, but which in and of itself, outside its text, is not sufficient to operate the necessary transgression" ("Differance," Margins, 12).</page><page sequence="13">Spivak / Responsibility 31 animal's privation [Entbehrung] from Dasein's privation [Privation] in com- prehension of the world" (OS, 55, 54). The animal "lack[s] access to the entity as such . . . as if .. the Being of the entity . .. were crossed out in advance, but with an absolute crossing-out, that of privation" (OS, 53). This is not the philosophical crossing-out that the philosopher must practice to "recall" that Dasein cannot get behind the world worlding. It is a "crossing- through of the crossing-through" (or being-crossed-through) (OS, 56). Further, "the animal can be after a prey, it can calculate, hesitate, fol- low or try out a track, but it cannot properly question. ... [I]t can use things, even instrumentalize them, but it cannot gain access to a tekhne" (OS, 57). Thus, in terms of the question and of technology, Dasein's definitive predi- cations, "it is always a matter of marking an absolute limit" between Dasein and the animal (OS, 54). Yet, "the lizard" (Heidegger's example) does have "a relationship with the sun-and with the stone [Heidegger's example of the non-living], which itself has none" (OS, 52). Derrida extends the set, or ensemble, that predicates the animal: "We should now have to say of spirit what one says of the world for the animal: the animal is poor in spirit [Geistarm as it is Weltarm, as it were], it has spirit but does not have spirit and this not-having is a mode of its being-able-to-have spirit" (OS, 55). It is important that the animal is absolutely off-limits to the decon- struction of ontology. Heidegger can only mention, not use, "the animal crossing-through"; or rather, his philosophy is used by it, although he implies a negative "hierarchization and evaluation" by using "the words 'poverty' and 'lack' [Entbehrung]" about the animal: What is signaled by this animal crossing-through, if we can call it that? Or rather, what is signaled by the word "crossing-through" which we write a propos of the animal "world" and which ought, in its logic, to overtake all words from the moment they say something about the world? (OS, 54) For the animal has some relationship with the world, and yet the animal is absolutely marked off from Dasein. Therefore, every inauguration of the world by Dasein is struck through by the inaccessible animal. Heidegger's philosophy "responds" against its grain to the animal by the formalizable logic of contamination-not just a threat, but a compromise: Can one not say, then, that the whole deconstruction of ontology, as it is begun in Sein und Zeit and insofar as it unseats, as it were, the Cartesian-Hegelian spiritus in the existential analytic, is here threat-</page><page sequence="14">32 boundary 2 / Fall 1994 ened in its order, in its implementation, its conceptual apparatus, by what is called, so obscurely still, the animal? Compromised, rather, by a thesis on animality in general, for which any example would do the job. . . . These difficulties-such at least is the proposition I submit for discussion-- ... bring the consequences of a serious mortgaging [hypotheque, the word for a large mortgage loan taken out, for instance, to finance the purchase of a house] to weigh upon the whole of his thought. (OS, 57) This is an indictment, and Derrida stands behind it: "Such ... is the proposition I submit." It may be remembered that the discussion of correct politics began with the impossibility of avoiding the unilaterality of subjec- tity. In Derrida's reading, that is one of Heidegger's major philosophical irresponsibilities in the period of the Rectoral Address: to try to ward off that unilaterality by way of the crossing-through of Destruktion. In this chapter, we see "the epoch of"-both the era of and the bracketed-in philosophi- cal region of-"subjectity"-given the adjective "Cartesian-Hegelian" (OS, 55). And, in the passage quoted at length, the deconstruction of ontology in- sofar as it unseats the Cartesian-Hegelian spiritus-by withdrawing it from subjectity-is claimed to be threatened, or, rather, compromised, by the ani- mal. It is in this context that Derrida brings up the question of a specifically political responsibility again. Between the stone and Dasein, the animal is "the living creature." "[P]rivative poverty indeed marks the caesura or the heterogeneity between non-living and living on the one hand, between the animal and human Da- sein on the other" (OS, 55). [This] absolute limit between the living creature and the human Da- sein, tak[es] a distance not only from all biologism and even all phi- losophy of life (and thus from all political ideology which might draw its inspiration more or less directly from them) but also . .. from a Rilkean thematics which links openness and animality. Not to men- tion Nietzsche. (OS, 54) Derrida does not mention Nietzsche much in this book. But here is one indication why, for him, Nietzsche remains a less dark figure: be- cause he reckons with the living animality of the human. As for Heidegger, Derrida asks, What is being-for-death? What is death for a Dasein that is never defined essentially as a living thing? This is not a matter of opposing death to life, but of wondering what semantic content can be given to</page><page sequence="15">Spivak / Responsibility 33 death in a discourse for which the relation to death, the experience of death, remains unrelated to the life of the living thing. (OS, 120) It is not only that Destruktion cannot be used to avoid the unilater- ality of subjectity when spirit is bound by a stand taken in its name. That, as it were, is the limit above. But it is also that, not being able to fill life and therefore death with meaning, not having made room for the animal-in-the- human, Heideggerian philosophy cannot be a philosophy of life that is, as it were, the limit from below. We must keep these earlier elaborations in mind when Derrida dis- cusses Heidegger's refusal of evil to the animal because evil is spiritual (geistlich) (OS, 103).24 By Derrida's reading, I can suggest that "we should now have to say of evil what Derrida says of spirit for the animal: the animal is poor in evil [Bosarm as it is Geistarm, as it were], it has evil but does not have evil and this not-having is a mode of its being-able-to-be/have evil" (see page 31). The discussion of the animal emerges in Of Spirit in the wake of a typographical gesture, the crossing-out. We may now be ready to read the passage about the fully Heideggerian text: To dream of what the Heideggerian corpus would look like the day when, with all the application and consistency required, the opera- tion prescribed by him at one moment or another would indeed have been carried out: "avoid" the word "spirit," at the very least put it in quotation marks, then cross through all the names referring to the world whenever one is speaking of something which, like the animal, has no Dasein, and therefore no or only a little world, then place the word "Being" everywhere under a cross, and finally cross through without a cross all the question marks when it's a question of lan- guage, i.e., indirectly, of everything, etc. One can imagine the surface of a text given over to the gnawing, ruminant, and silent voracity of such an animal-machine and its implacable "logic." This would not only be simply "without spirit," but a figure of evil. (OS, 134) Deconstruction or Destruktion cannot become a matter of obeying and applying an obsessive typography, of qualifying everything one reads, writes, or says: "everything, etc." One must recall that these typographi- 24. For a full appreciation of the argument of the book one must follow carefully Heideg- ger's curious trajectory regarding the word spirit, its citation, and the valorizing of related words, painstakingly outlined in it. In this passage, an earlier relationship between geistig and geistlich is shown to have been altered.</page><page sequence="16">34 boundary 2 / Fall 1994 cal gestures are ways of recalling limits that one cannot cross rather than acting out theoretical safeguards against all previous philosophy. The spirit cannot be bound by politicizing in its name, but Heideggerian philosophy cannot give itself over to its own open animality, either; and it has no typo- graphical arsenal for recalling that limit. And therefore, since the paragraph I quote above is constructed by imitating the "logic" of dreamwork, it is that unprotected flank that provides the name of the text where every wish of a destruktive philosophy is fulfilled, everything you want to say is eaten up, the Nietzschean philosopher's self-modeling on the cud-chewing (rumi- nant) cow goes out of control, not responsible before the spirit but taken over, not by the animal (for it is out of reach) but by an animal-machine that is crossed-through before crossing-through.25 Remember: the animal cannot be evil by this philosophy. Therefore, in the dream of its fulfillment, (the surface of) the text controlled by the animal (machine) is (a figure of) evil. To get the force of "figure," I can, once again, turn to "Shibboleth," my vade mecum of responsible reading.26 This is an indictment of Heidegger's irresponsibility to, and in, phi- losophy, the irresponsibility of that philosophy from its powerful start. It is not the cop-out of: philosophy good, man bad. An ex-Derridian said to me recently, "Heidegger was a Nazi, and Jacques should have said it." This as- sumes that Derrida does deconstruction when he philosophizes, but turns it off when there's need for plain talk. It seems more responsible that, instead of falling back on the deceptive simplicity of a proposition (Heidegger was a Nazi) and taking that as sufficient fulfillment of his philosophical respon- sibility, this philosopher, who has unceasingly deconstructed propositions, would philosophize with all stops pulled out, without denegating his com- plicity, to present Heideggerian philosophy as pharmakon, what could have been medicine turned into poison.27 It is not necessary to utter that proposition, after all. Heidegger sim- plified matters by taking out party membership. 25. Friedrich Nietzsche, On the Genealogy of Morals and Ecce Homo, trans. Walter Kaufmann (New York: Vintage, 1969), 23. 26. In "Shibboleth," a "figure" recalls an impossibility, here perhaps the impossibility of the animal. In a brilliant passage where figure and trope become synonyms, Derrida re- calls Ulysses by using "polytropy," Homer's first predication of his hero. Derrida's search for Ulysses, that other Mediterranean given over to troping, is all over his text. For his "schoolmates," the shape of the word figure leads into all the binds and double binds of responsibility ("Shibboleth," Acts of Literature, 386-87). 27.

For them the happy euphoria of being in the right. That their relationship to dominant capital is not unlike deconstruction's to Heidegger and therefore involves "responsi- bility" is not something they can arrive at through their own thinking, which will not open itself to what it resists. And they are certainly not willing to see if they are able to learn it through deconstruction. For them, deconstruction remains caught in the competition of whose sword is sharper.28 Of Spirit is concerned with philosophical argument, semantic con- tent, rhetoric, and typography, all of which recall limits (and all of which must remain open to "setting-to-work"). It is therefore noteworthy that the dream of the saturated Heideggerian corpus is not connected to an argu- ment but staged as a momentary and declared pause in square brackets in a long footnote about the "markers and signs" in Heidegger, of "impercep- tible-for Martin Heidegger as much as for anyone[-] ... strata appear[ing] prominent after the event," concerning an "example ... more and other, than an example," regarding "the very origin of responsibility," signs and markers that assign . . . so many new tasks to thought, and to reading . . . not only for reading Heidegger and serving some hermeneutical or philo- sophical piety. Beyond an always necessary exegesis, this rereading sketches out another topology for new tasks, for what remains to be situated of the relationships between Heidegger's thought and other places of thought. (OS, 132-33) In other words, the dream floats up where Derrida appears to be rescu- ing his thought by way of his "new politics of reading," which may seem to be a case of: thought salvageable, man limited.29 Trying to learn "the 28.

I cannot forget that Freud's main criticism of wild psychoanalysis was its ir- responsibility, its ignoring of the robust response-accountability structure of transference.30 (Is it simply this feeling of unease that makes me sense a similar moment of unease in Derrida? He openly censures Heidegger for his dis- loyalty to Husserl, again in terms of irresponsibility to his own philosophy of crossing-out: And the fact remains, beyond any possible contestation, that he erased [he didn't cross out this time, he erased] the dedication of Sein und Zeit to Husserl so that the book could be republished, in a gesture which reconstitutes the erasure as an unerasable, mediocre, and hideous crossing-out. [OS, 121] But in the same note, he points out [and to me, as a product of imperialism, this is a rare courage] that, in a text delivered in 1935 in Vienna ... [r]ight after asking the question "How is the spiritual figure of Europe to be characterized?" Husserl adds: "In a spiritual sense clearly the English dominions and the United States belong to Europe, but not the Eskimos or the Indi- ans of the traveling zoos or the gypsies who permanently wander as vagabonds all over Europe." [OS, 121] He is even aware of the hierarchization and racism internal to an imperialist mind-set: It is apparently necessary, therefore, in order to save the English dominions, the power and culture they represent, to make a dis- tinction between, for example, good and bad Indians . . . and this reference to spirit, and to Europe, is no more an external or acciden- Transference, Translation, trans.

It plays a major, organizing role in the transcendental teleology of reason as Europocentric humanism. .... The question of the animal is never very far away: "just as man, and even the Papuan [my emphasis- J.D.] represents a new stage in animality in contrast to the animals, so philosophical reason represents a new stage in humanity and in its reason." [OS, 122] Having pointed this out, Derrida engages in balancing the two sides: Would [Heidegger] have thrown the "non-Aryan" out of Europe, as did he who knew he was himself "non-Aryan," i.e. Husserl? And if the reply is "no," to all appearances "no," is it certain that this is for reasons other than those which distanced him from transcendental idealism? Is what he did or wrote worse? [OS, 122] It is then that I can hear unease. "Where is the worst [le pire]? That is perhaps the question of spirit." Why does he cite the title of his book there? In French, the monstra- tive is even stronger: "voila peut-ietre la question de I'esprit."31' Is it that an exercise in judgment, weighing the good against the bad, cannot not be, in a certain sense, a failure of the open-endedness of responsibility or the indeconstructibility of justice? I cannot know, but I mark the moment.) Let us return to the note on the animal-machine. At the end of the dream-pause, before marking the end, Derrida writes: "The perverse read- ing of Heidegger." Perverse, but possible, not idiosyncratic; the perverse reading.32 The article is not indefinite. And the French-"la lecture perverse de Heidegger"-even allows "Heidegger's perverse reading." It may, of course, be said that Of Spirit attempts to con-verse with Heidegger, to turn with him into the dark, perhaps perverse, recesses of his philosophy as it juggles with spirit. I could take perverse in the colloquial sense and contrast it to Derrida's critique of the eminently sane supporters of the later Heidegger. 31. Jacques Derrida, De I'esprit: Heidegger et la question (Paris: Galil6e, 1987), 96. 32. Derrida, like Milton, is often a creative literalist of Latin in the vernacular. Per-verse carries the possible double charge of "through (its) turning," as well as the more common "by turning away," "turning in the wrong direction."</page><page sequence="20">38 boundary 2 / Fall 1994 Let us turn to the structuring of this long footnote, which deals pre- cisely with the question: Has the question been preserved in another form in the later Heidegger? The sentence this long note divides runs as fol- lows: "Language, always, before any question,* [note reference] and in the very question, comes down to [revient a] the promise" (OS, 94). The note glosses the thought of what is anterior to the question. And it prepares us to weigh the next sentence: "This would also be a promise of spirit." Let the reader work out the citing of the title of the book again at this juncture where the promise (thought must obey it to be thought) is judged harshly over against the question (thought must recall the responsibility to be answerable). In the footnote proper, Derrida lets texts of the later Heidegger lengthily point at the now "pre-originary pledge [gage] ... [which] en- gage[s] ... [the question] in a responsibility it has not chosen and which assigns it even its liberty" (OS, 130); but then he offers his own comment, in tones of unmistakable emphasis: But it has to be admitted that the thought of an affirmation anterior to any question and more proper to thought than any question must have an unlimited incidence . . . on the quasi-totality of Heidegger's previous path of thought .... [T]his step transforms or deforms (as you like) the whole landscape to the extent that that landscape has been constituted before [devant] the-inflexible-law of the most radical questioning .... [L]et me recall that the point of departure of the analytic of Dasein-and therefore the project of Sein und Zeit itself-was assigned by the opening of Dasein to the question; [here Derrida again brings up Cartesian-Hegelian subjectity] and that the whole Destruktion of ontology took as its target, especially in post- Cartesian modernity, an inadequate questioning of the Being of the subject, etc. This retrospective upheaval can seem to dictate a new order ... to construct a quite different discourse, open a quite differ- ent path of thought ... and remove-a highly ambiguous gesture- the remnant of Aufklirung which still slumbered in the privilege of the question. (OS, 131)33 33. In view of the sentence that follows, it may not be irresponsible to claim that Derrida is here deeply troubled about Heidegger's letting go of the last vestige of the Enlighten- ment. Derrida's own ambiguous attitude toward the Enlightenment, which he honors in Leibnitz's formulation of the accountable principle of reason (principium reddendae ratio- nis) more than in Kant's formulation of the public use of reason, is indeed to that which</page><page sequence="21">Spivak / Responsibility 39 I have encountered many uncomprehending readings of this text, particularly from readers who imitate the snazz without working on the in- timidatingly precise argument. The point is, of course, that it is not an open denunciation but the double bind of deconstructive responsibility, practiced in the philosophizing, hard to shoulder, hard to recognize. But what is one responsible for?-for the understanding and applause of impatient aca- demics? I therefore take the liberty of recommending a slow reading of the next sentence: "In fact, without believing that we can henceforth not take account of this profound upheaval, we cannot take seriously the imperative of such a recommencement" (my emphasis). He gives his reasons, and it is after this that he proposes a "new strategy," "another topology," and, strictly speaking, begins the last movement of Of Spirit, deconstructing Heidegger, for his "schoolmates," those who have learned that deconstruction is not exposure of error but "a new politics of reading." In the footnote, he says no more about new strategy (although the text will henceforth and gradually de- clare his own [de]construction of Heidegger more and more), because "my purpose bound me to privilege the modalities of avoiding (vermeiden)- and notably the silent dramaturgy of pragmatic signs" (OS, 133). Curiously enough, it is after this enigmatic sentence that the footnote pauses upon the dream of the full-dress production of the drama of prag- matic signs: a figure of evil. And this dream of a figure comes before the can recall a limit in its very extensive resource: "Even if the gift"-and I believe respon- sibility may be one name of the necessary and impossible immediate transformation of the gift into simulacrum-"were never anything but a simulacrum, one must still render an account of the possibility of this simulacrum. And one must also render an account of the desire to render an account. This cannot be done against or without the principle of reason (principium reddendae rationis), even if the latter finds there its limit as well as its resource" (Derrida, Given Time, 31; for the Leibnitz reference, see Derrida, "Principle of Reason," 7f.). Again, "[n]othing seems to me less outdated than the classical emancipa- tory ideal. We cannot attempt to disqualify it today, whether crudely or with sophistication, at least not without treating it too lightly and forming the worst complicities. But beyond these identified territories of juridico-politicization on the grand geo-political scale, other areas must constantly open up that can at first seem like secondary or marginal areas" (Derrida, "Force of Law," 971-73). Derrida's critique of Heidegger, rendered in my irre- sponsibility for cruder readers, is that he let go of the Enlightenment (which may have opened up to margins) in the name of a spirit that can be traced to a "Europe" that cannot open up to margins. Incidentally, on a more restricted scale, our relationship to capitalism, and Derrida's and my relationship to imperialism, indeed feminism's relationship to both (divided along North-South or postcolonial lines), shares the structure of the relationship between possibility and the principle of reason.</page><page sequence="22">40 boundary 2 / Fall 1994 final paragraphs of the footnote, which seem to admit that even in the later Heidegger, "the proper of man arrives only in this response or this respon- sibility" (OS, 135). Derrida is duty-bound to admit this, for "at the Essex conference ... Frangoise Dastur reminded me of this passage of Unter- wegs zur Sprache, which indeed passes question. I dedicate this note to her as a pledge of gratitude" (OS, 136). A philosopher's responsibility is to acknowledge a counterexample to his general argument. In order to show, I think, that it is no more than a passage that passes question-that utters "Shibboleth" with the correct accent, as it were-Derrida launches this elaborately orchestrated note to show further that the only way to respond to the thought of responsibility that Heidegger betrayed is to deconstruct Destruktion: another strategy ... 34 In keeping with the strategy of the deconstructive project, this chap- ter in the book has already begun to chip away at the identity of the man named Heidegger, first by constructing Trakl as Heidegger's ventriloquist, upon Derrida's own contestatory authority, as follows: What is spirit? the reply is inscribed in maxims which translate cer- tain poetic statements by Trakl.... [F]or lack of time I will have to restrict myself to the gross affirmation which I think is hardly contest- able: statements like those I have just cited and translated by spirit in-flames are obviously statements of Heidegger. Not ... productions of the subject Martin Heidegger. (OS, 84-85) Next, Derrida undermines "Heidegger's identity" another degree by imposing the word revenant upon the Trakl-Heideggerian stranger whom the spirit follows on a "journey [that] would permit an interpretation ... more originary ... than ... the origin and decadence current in the dominant, i.e. metaphysico-Christian interpretation" (OS, 89). "His step carries him into the night," writes Derrida, like a revenant. ... "Revenant" is not a word of Heidegger's, and no doubt he would not like having it imposed on him because of the negative connotations, metaphysical or parapsychic, that he would be at pains to denounce in it. I will not, however, efface it. (OS, 89) There is no serious attempt to justify these impositions at this stage in the text. And in a couple of pages, a crucial sentence will be divided by the 34.

(What is it to say "for lack of time I will ... [make] a gross affirmation" when one is looking forward to a beautifully shaped seven-page footnote?) "Martin Heidegger"'s authority is being de- constructed here, his text taken over (or cathected?) by "another strategy," a greater responsibility than allegiance to a proper name. If Trakl's statements are statements "of Heidegger," what does it mean to say, as Derrida will in the next chapter, after a careful discussion of what "origin-heterogeneous" (in place of the earlier position of the question at the origin) might mean in Heidegger, that the gestures made to snatch Trakl away from the Christian thinking of Geist seem to me laborious, violent, sometimes simply carica- tural, and all in all not very convincing.... It is with reference to an extremely conventional and doxical outline of Christianity that Hei- degger can claim to de-Christianize Trakl's Gedicht. What is origin- heterogeneous would in that case be nothing other-but it's not nothing-than the origin of Christianity: the spirit of Christianity or the essence of Christianity[?] (OS, 108-9) No, it's not nothing. The final Heidegger (is it the one with the proper name?) is being delivered over to that very metaphysico-Christianity he mightily contested. And after this, the book launches an exchange between Heidegger and his Christian apologists-"[s]ince I'm doing the questions and answers here, I imagine Heidegger's reply" (OS, 111)-each vying to claim the other's space, casually ecumenical, this Heidegger even accom- modating the Judaic "spirit" (ruah) with an "I am opposing nothing. .. no[t] even (I'd forgotten that one) [the discourse] on ruah. . ... I said it is on the basis of flame that one thinks pneuma or spiritus or, since you insist, ruah, etc." (OS, 111, 112). "Those I [Derrida] called theologians" had, in their turn, enthusiastically invoked "my friend and coreligionary, the Messianic Jew. I'm not certain that the Moslem and some others"-Heidegger's "etc." matches this--"wouldn't join in the concert or the hymn" (OS, 110, 111). In this easy multicultural chat, a whitewashed Heidegger answers reproaches with "I follow the path of the entirely other" (OS, 113). The call of the entirely other, to which one bears responsibility, and which the ques- tion recalls, has now been made into this. And "crossing is not a neutral word," Derrida writes, "-[it] runs the risk ... of recalling the cross-shaped crossing-through under which one leaves being [I'6tre] or God to suffer" (OS, 112; word order changed). The crossing-through itself is given over to Christian metaphysics as Christ the man (Dasein?, I'etre is in lowercase) is crossed-over on the Cross as God under erasure. Perhaps I am speak-</page><page sequence="24">42 boundary 2 / Fall 1994 ing irresponsibly here, but this last movement of the book seems to me to confront European Christianity in its profound anti-Semitism even in its self- consciously ecumenical pose.35 Indeed, introducing this last moment is a fairly straightforward passage: One can, then, imagine a scene between Heidegger and certain Christian theologians.... It would in truth be an odd exchange.... We are talking about past, present, and future "events," a compo- sition of forces and discourses which seem to have been waging merciless war on each other (for example from 1933 to our time). We have a combinatory whose power remains abyssal. In all rigor it exculpates none of the discourses which can thus exchange their power. It does not leave a clean place open [ne laisse la place nette] for any arbitrating authority. Nazism was not born in the desert. We all know this, but it has to be constantly recalled. And even if, far from any desert, it had grown like a mushroom in the silence of a European forest, it would have done so in the shadow of big trees, in the shelter of their silence or their indifference, but in the same soil. ... In their bushy taxonomy, they would bear the names of reli- gions, philosophies, political regimes, economic structures, religious or academic institutions. In short, what is just as confusedly called culture, or the world of spirit. (OS, 109-10) "Whose power remains abyssal." The word abyssal combines both the nuances of the abyss and the interminable counterreflection of the mise en abime-the facing mirrors on the heraldic blazon. The potentiality for something like Nazism (and I, quite without authority, would include here the demonization of that other People of the Book, Islam) is an always possible potential in Christian Europe's cultural heritage. When, at the end of the book, we read that the only hope is in the shuttle of dialogue-"it's enough to keep talking, not to interrupt"-we cannot forget the grim description of such exhanges in the passage above (OS, 113). The imagined exchange between the final Heidegger and his contemporary interlocutors can achieve nothing. And Of Spirit ends with a deliberate disregard of Heidegger's philo- sophical cautions, even as a parody of Heidegger's first principle is offered: the spirit will do the rest. But this spirit is a ghost (there is an interesting printer's error in the translation, almost as if the translators cannot brook 35. I take the liberty of referring to my discussion of Freud's Moses and Monotheism in "Psychoanalysis in Left Field," 58-60.</page><page sequence="25">Spivak / Responsibility 43 such irreverence), it is in flame as well as ash, and it is unavoidable. In the version of Of Spirit, Martin Heidegger and the question dead-end in this shuttle, a caricature of the response-structure of responsibility. The de- construction of Heidegger has taken off elsewhere, following the track of a responsibility Heidegger himself gave up, halfway to its testing in its setting- to-work. One must learn to read in order to see it happen, to respond to the argument. This is not the conflation of literature and philosophy.36 It is the use of the resources of writing to philosophize. 2 This unauthorized formalization of the silent dramaturgy of Of Spirit is no more than an intermediary stage. I want now to offer another instan- tiation of what I have learned from this text of responsibility: the animal- machine of fully programmed information, and a "European" combinatory whose power remains abyssal, so that the two sides seem to engage in an interminable conversation, while a specter does the rest. I am, of course, miming a progression of images rather than, strictly speaking, following an argument. Is this responsible to the text? But concept and metaphor are in each other.37 3. Conference on the Flood Action Plan (FAP) in Bangladesh, European Parliament, Strasbourg I do not read here the silent dramaturgy of pragmatic signs that con- vention considers decadent to "read," because it is nothing but the trans- parent scaffolding that supports the text of reason. I read, rather, the dra- maturgy of the apparently unrehearsed staging of what convention regards to be (the transparent textuality or theater of) facts. I rush in to supplement where Derrida postpones: And as, since the beginning of this lecture, we have been speaking of nothing but the "translation" of these thoughts and discourses into what are commonly called the "events" of "history" and of "politics" (I place quotation marks around all these obscure words), it would also be necessary to "translate" what such an exchange of places 36.

(OS, 109) The "moment" in that last sentence may be standing in for the in- definitely differantial prow of the present on the move. But I literalize. I aim to sidle into the parenthesis to see what script puts quotation marks around those obscure words in another text, not only translated from Europe but transferred, yet remaining the same. I read the unfolding of a small confer- ence arranged by the Green Party at the European Parliament. So much has been written about the relationship between orators and rhetors that it seems unnecessary to belabor the point. Derrida himself has written on the elaboration of that topic in Rousseau.38 The parliamentary setting, with its representatives, who must vertreten (represent) rather than darstellen (represent), has been exposed by Marx by way of a sustained theatrical metaphor.39 What is also surely obvious is the monumentalized role that the delicate and irregular beat of responsibility-as-accountability plays here. The Members are responsible to their constituency. Derrida has indirectly written about the conventions of the representation of "the public," to whom the representative is responsible, in "Call It a Day for Democracy." 40 Let us also remember the other, slightly odder sense given to "re- sponsibility": the transference of "responses" volleyed from one subject to another, drawn by a mise en abime. There is a mise en scene of this in the structuring of a parlement-a place where men (typically) reason together. Let us add to this that the conference was arranged by a group- with a representative in Parliament-that feels responsible to Nature (ani- mal as well as a world worlded as "earth") as the Other of the Human-a group self-consciously responsible for the picking back up of the abdicated responsibility of being human-on-earth, as it were, and representative of those who have recalled this responsibility, those human beings who are fully human, at last. It may, I think, be said that they speak in the name of spirit against technologism and capitalism. Does this "re-inscribing of spirit in an oppositional demarcation" make it a unilaterality of subjectity? And how terrifying is the contamination? 38. Derrida, Of Grammatology, 229-68 and passim. 39.

But there is yet another codicil to be added to the account of how "political" and "human" responsibility was, in this case, bound to a structure. (And the very thought of the codicil calls for a caution. There can be no assumption that "pure" responsibility can appear, unstructured and unstaged. The call is a gift, but the response is, unavoidably, an exchange- effect. This is the stimulus of a persistent critique, which must forever try to maintain the precarious balance between construction and destruction: deconstruction.) The codicil, then: The entire set described in the text was staged as a dialogue, between the forces of "Development" and the voices of a "developing nation," charging the Developers with constructing a theater of responsibility to disguise the mechanics of unrestricted capital investment. (Dialogue is, in fact, the accepted proper name of responsibility as exchange-of-responses, implicitly understood as the flow of propositions or constatations rather than responses from both sides. It is a word given status and currency by the participatory movements in the sixties that have displaced themselves in the New Social Movements of the seven- ties and the eighties, of which the European Green Party is an inheritor. I have already indicated a possible scenario of responsibility that can be constructed out of the party's presuppositions, broadly understood. This other feature, the implementation of that responsibility through dialogue, 41.

The thinking of the relationship [or nonrelationship, or "relationship"] between justice and law inaugurated by "the Force of Law" inevitably determines my understand- ing of the relationship between responsibility and dialogue.42 For I think it is right to say that in that word, in this particular Anglo-U.S. usage, the "false" etymology of "dia," as the two that converse, mingles with the "original" sense of something coming about through the telling, the middle voice of dialegesthai mingling also with telling, as in a calculus. But let this remain a parenthesis, for to dwell on this would restrain us from the empirical narra- tive. Yet, let it be said that the often repugnant and smug congratulation that the inclusion of empirical narrative brings to an academic in the humanities is even less productive when unaccompanied by such musings.) Indeed, the conference was organized for the establishment of a dia- logue. The word dialogue (and confrontation, about whose relationship to responsibility much could be written) was repeatedly used in the confer- ence literature precisely as that phenomenon the establishment of which would be the first step toward the restoration of responsibility. Let me quote a sentence that will highlight the justice/law, responsibility/dialogue route that must be taken as given in order to decide, necessarily in the night of non-knowledge: "The legal basis for public consultation and people's par- ticipation must be ensured first ... [in order] to have a meaningful dialogue with the World Bank."43 I am speaking of a conference that has been described in the follow- ing way: In a victory for Green Party activists from France, Germany, and the Netherlands, the European Parliament will host an unprecedented open debate of the merits of the FAP May 26 and 27, 1993, where project opponents will have an opportunity to present their case di- rectly to many of the governments funding the scheme. Let me give the bare bones of the situation. (If Derrida had been obliged to give gross affirmations for lack of time, I am obliged to summarize, 42. Derrida, "Force of Law," 947. 43.

Bangladesh is a small, fertile country continually in the making by the play of huge young rivers. These young rivers rise in the neighboring countries and gather force until they reach Bangladesh on their way to the Bay of Bengal. They deposit enormous quantities of silt as their waters di- vide into innumerable tributaries as they reach the open bay. It is quite like the way the great blood vessels finally break into capillaries to disperse into the skin. The entire country, apart from the mountains to the north and east, is thus soft alluvial deposit, and the coast is a collection of many small shifting deltas covered by mangrove swamps. Because these rivers are young and strong, they move. When the Brahmaputra River is at maximum flood, for example, bedforms up to 15m[eters] high migrate downstream as much as 600 m/day.... Lat- eral channel movements as high as 800 m/yr are common.... Many experts consider the confinement of such rivers to be impossible.... [This is also] one of the world's most earthquake-prone locations. An active fault line lies along the northern edge of the delta, at the foothills of the Himalayas. The largest earthquake on land known to seismologists, registering 8.7 on the Richter scale, occurred in this region in 1897 .... Witnesses reported that the quake caused plumes of water to gush from the ground. ... In areas of recent sand and silt deposition with high water tables, such as the Bengal delta, earthquakes lead to liquefaction, the temporary loss of strength of sands and silts, which behave like viscous fluids rather than soils.44 It may be said, only half fancifully, that the grounding of the ground is evident here as one thinks from the worlded world. What is crossed out has been already, and is being crossed out, by the moving weave of water. At Bangladesh, the land mass of the Indian subcontinent narrows, and the Himalaya is squeezed up into its highest peaks. Thus, the mon- soon winds here travel much longer over ocean and sea, gather force in the incopious width of the Bay of Bengal, and dash more quickly at a much higher mountain wall. It is a country of great rains. In this combination of turbulent flowing and pouring-keep the dis- tinction in mind for later-the Bangladeshi fisher-folk and grass-roots peas- 44. James K.

Every thirty years or so, there are devastating floods. They have learned to bear this, not quite to cope with the extraordinary inundations, but to bend with them and rise again. As for the yearly floods, they have learned to manage them, welcome them, and build a life-style with respect for them. Indeed, the moving floodwaters leave algae that alleviate the need to fertilize, and Bangladesh notionally produces enough to feed the entire population. (I must keep to the point of the essay and therefore cannot speak of the inter- nal class exploitation and lack of interest in land reform.) I will touch upon this later in the essay. The Bangladeshis' main source of protein is fish. The grass-roots fisher catches fish in rivers and waters that are still common property. (On my level of miming the logic of the concept-metaphor, is it absurd to ask if the relationship between Dasein-animal-world is different here from Heidegger-lizard-stone? It is in the context of the Flood Action Program in Bangladesh that I began to get my kind of handle on Derrida's obsti- nate insistence, in the face of learned participants in his seminar who cited Heideggerian passages apparently to the contrary, that Heidegger never speculated on eating. And his equally insistent refrain: What is it to eat?45 If, in a certain conventional theology, to eat God's flesh is to establish ex- change with spirit, what is established by eating mere flesh [or fish]? Is the argument on the fetish, contrasting the two, akin to the humanist teleology of [Heidegger's] Christian metaphysics in the differentiation between Dasein and the animal? When the anthropologist learnedly transforms the racist language of the fetish into the scientific discourse of the totem, how much by subreption [as in Kant's analytic of the sublime] does the psychoanalytic set subl[im]ate all of this from "real" castration to circumcision as [recall- ing the fear of] "castration," so that the self-conscious [super-egoic] sense of responsibility, recognizable as such, takes quite another form?46 How does the ecology of fish-eating in the geology of turbulent youthful rivers transform the eating of sacrificial flesh in Islam, of which these circumcised subalterns are devoutly observant in season, as far as means will allow? 45.

Especially if they occupy Derrida's question to Heidegger-"What is it to eat"-from a position that is not-quite-not fetish/totem, yet marked by sacrifice and circumcision?47 How does the question of woman complicate each one of these categories? Has Heidegger ever been faulted because today's Bavarian grass roots may not think as he does? But I am dragged beyond my summary by the problematic of [wo]man-fish-water. Let us resume.) In 1988, there was a disastrous flood-one of the three expected in a century. It is alleged that Danielle Mitterand, who was in the coun- try at the time, spoke of the devastation to her husband-of course, she knew nothing of what has been summarized so far-and Franpois Mitte- rand-ironically, his name means "middle landowner," a traditional small- time class-exploiter of the common-property landless grass roots-decided to make flood control in Bangladesh the centerpiece of Third World Aid at the Paris Summit.48 FAP (Flood Action Plan) 25, the first French plan, is an allegory of right reason (Figure 1). To impose upon the changeful riverscape the straight lines of massive "pharaonic" embankments is the plan.49 Just over ten billion dollars are being circulated to generate further capital according to the changeful laws of the International Monetary Fund. The governments of the Group of Seven countries are involved as "donor" countries.50 47. It is striking how, in neighboring India, where the dominant culture is "polytheist" in its imaginary, the same great rivers are symbolized as mothers/goddesses. One only has to cross the border to feel the weight of the shift. I have gropingly discussed the "polytheist" imaginary in "Response to Jean-Luc Nancy," in Juliet Flower MacCannell, ed., Thinking Bodies (Stanford: Stanford University Press, forthcoming). 48. If the story is true in its detail, one is put in mind of the representation of Defoe's "Susan Barton" in J. M.

Who gives or can give? The gift is a limit that permits and annuls all recognizable human giving.51 But here, far from that limit, the name of giving is scientifically appropriated for coercive lending, solicited by comprador capital and a compromised state, used as staging props for a nation seeking alms.52 Is responsibility to be produced by a debt trap? 53 This monstrosity- a bonded donation-mortgages the future of the country.54 I foolishly read philosophy as blueprint here: Know still what giving means [veut dire, literally, wants to say], know how to give, know what you want and mean [veux dire, literally, wants to say] when you give, know what you intend to give, know how the gift annuls itself, commit yourself [engage-toi, literally, stake yourself?] even if commitment is the destruction of the gift by the gift, give economy a chance.55) The World Bank coordinates the effort, shored up by innumerable business enterprises and consultancies and government allocations and international agencies. The country is "consultantized," the possibility of agitation for peoples' rights effectively blocked, since the de facto law is in the hands of the donors via a Flood Protection Coordinating Organization set up by executive decision of the Ministry of Water Development, which describes itself as an ad hoc staff body, directed by the "donors' " own policy role of the high embankments or levees over the Mississippi in the United States flood disaster of 1993 will make the issue clear to American readers.

It is not con- ceivable that some First World consulting agency will, first, be tracked down after the organization has been dismantled; and, second, respond at the subaltern's call.56 (In other words, the element of legal calculus of one sort in the name of a collectivity of individuals conceived in terms of tirelessly gathered details of life and living has been blocked. The certainty that Jus- tice always eludes these calculations makes it all the more important that their possibility be sustained. "[I]t is just that there be law."'57) We must recall that Development is the dominant global denomina- tion of responsibility: The story is that the rich nations collectively hear the call of the ethical and collect to help the poor nations by giving skill and money. There are, therefore, elaborate and visible structures of public con- sultation in place. The ways in which these structures are manipulated- well-publicized occasions of exchange that are minimally disseminated or not disseminated at all, promises that are made without intention of per- formance ("pure" performatives), and in-house decisions not to honor the results of consultation, being only a few-can be documented.58 It was to redress the imbalance between structural rights and the possibility of their exercise that the European Green Party called the most public meeting it could devise. Knowing that responsibility in its setting-to-work can never reduce out the unilaterality of subjectity, we still compute how the form of com- plicity of the Green Party and the World Bank (shorthand for all the parties involved in the FAP) are "not equivalent." Undoubtedly, these are two "European" ways of helping the "people" of Bangladesh. For the World Bank, the "people" is the name of the final instance of justification for its enterprise. The justification, always crudely formulated, is a parody of Marx's conclusion, based on Victorian Britain, the herald of modern imperialism, that capitalism maximizes social produc- tivity. Marx was involved in working out how the interest of capitalism could be diverted from capital to the "social," how poison could be measured into medicine.

The World Bank is not involved in the diversion of interest from capital to "social." The "people," rather far from Marx's tough rationalist definition of the "social," remain a promised possible beneficiary of the trickle-down from capital-intensive "social productivity." The real interest remains the generation of global capital through consultant and contractor.60 The World Bank does not merit the deconstructive reading and supplementation that Marx's attempt commands. We owe it no such responsibility. It falls far short of the call. The Green Party as such, on the other hand, whatever the sympa- thies of individual members, does not act in the name of the "people" as the last instance. Their last instance is "Nature," even though it is always Nature-for-the-human as the human-for-Nature. Here, we can take all the precautions against imagining that Nature can ever be anything but that which comes back after and before the human. This said, we can now notice that the elaborate dramaturgy of the parliament/conference structure of responsibility/representation keeps the party on the other side of the subaltern as well. Yet, we certainly will not consider this distance equivalent to the rapacious double-talk of the World Bank. One can act "politically" to make the distinction clear. Thus, some- what haphazardly, selected members of the Bangladeshi opposition to the FAP responded positively to the party's call. But they felt it inappropriate to sign the resolution drawn up for the support of the Bangladeshi people by interested members of the European Community. One might think that pointing out this complicity between the party and the bank is enough proof of "a combinatory whose power remains abyssal." These are two faces of "Europe," after all-global and bloated, earthy and ascetic. But one must note, once again, the former's formal re- fusal of responsibility, even as "exchange."

A Mr. Van Ellen, whose designation is not im- mediately clear from his faxed communication, offered the most interesting response: "I consulted in The Hague with the Netherlands Government and here in Dhaka with the Government of Bangladesh (FPCO), the World Bank, and [the] panel of experts. I have been advised not to participate and as a consequence I have to decline your invitation." The World Bank's Water Resources Advisor (Asia Region), W. T. Smith, provided the curtest refusal: "I regret I will not attend since I am not currently involved in the FAP."61 The monumental structure of any conference attempts to control the turbulent flow of new and old thought in the name of intellectual and pro- fessional responsibility. Let us attempt to draw an analogy between this and the nature of the Flood Action Plan. I have already indicated the broad similarity: the monumental pharaonic concrete hard structures are built in an attempt to control the turbulent young waters of the great rivers. We will see at the end how both-though not in equivalent ways-serve to silence the subaltern. But now let us take the analogy in another direction. Let us think of these stupendous drains, driving the continually shift- ing text-ile waters by the violence of reason into the shortest route to the sea as the violence of Reason itself, driving the continually differantiating text- ile of meanings into the shortest route to Truth. But the absolute fulfillment of these drain-dreams and their attendant systems would be the perverse dream of Reason against that principle of reason which is obliged to give an account of itself, fulfilled in every detail, for itself: an animal-machine; with all inconsistencies programmed, the land reduced to whatever can be fed into Geographical Information Systems, its surface given over to that ruminant gnawing. This implacable logic began with the systematizing of land into survey in early modern Britain, the condition and effect of con- quest and imperialism.62 The worlding of infinite geometries for control of the country as information is its working-out. It is in the interest of this that cul- 61. All correspondence available in the dossier of the conference. 62. Crystal L.

This is a dream that requires the kind of unconnected monitory pause that a deconstructive censor let slip in that long footnote of Of Spirit. Nazism, which showed the risk of Destruktion literalized, was, ostensibly, defeated, although the demonization of Islam and the progressively militant xenopho- bia in Europe and the United States give proof that the "big trees" in the "European"-by Husserl's expanded definition of Europe-forest that shel- tered Nazism can still be, however confusedly, called "culture, or the world of spirit."63 This dream, the animal-machine of exploitation fully transform- ing land into information for a manipulation that will obey a myriad minute rules of programming also belongs to that culture, that spirit, in the name of Reason-the public use of reason-"white" mythology. It is the subaltern, the fisher and the grass-roots peasant, who pro- duces a constant interruption for the full telos of Reason and capitalism, for those who have the patience to learn. I will tax my readers' patience with one example among many. Living in the rhythm of water, the Bangladeshi peasant long sowed two types of rice paddy seed. One of them survived submerged in water, the other came to full growth after the season of rain and flood. In 1971, agri- cultural reformers introduced a different variety of rice for a single high-yield 63. One or two conferences do not constitute evidence, but even one conference provides a counterexample to statements such as "it was precisely insofar as Heidegger remained faithful to certain precepts of 'Western thought' that he was prevented from identifying wholesale with the 'racial-biological thinking' of the National Socialists: a party whose doctrines and deeds represented .. . the very negation of that tradition" (Richard Wolin, "'L'Affaire Derrida': Another Exchange," New York Review of Books 11, no. 6 [25 Mar. 1993], 66). As we have seen, Derrida values the monitory virtue of the Enlightenment and the accountable principle of reason. It is the unreasonable confidence in the European tradition that he warns against. In July 1992, I attended a conference on Global Civilization and Local Cultures in Darmstadt, Germany. The country was ablaze with violent xenophobia. The conference did not once mention this, but spent three luxurious days on the assumption that Civili- zation was the Enlightenment (Habermas today), the theoretical champions of the local (read fragment) were the "postmodernists," and the good local color would be discov- ered by enlightened cultural relativism toward exotic practices. This is what is meant by Nazism (xenophobia today) growing up in the shelter of the big trees in the European forest (confusedly) called culture.</page><page sequence="38">56 boundary 2 / Fall 1994 crop. In the intervening years, the peasant has quietly and gradually shifted the time of sowing of this modern crop to Phalgun-Chaitro (February- March). As was their established custom, accommodating the play of land and water, they now sow pulses and vegetables before this. And now, at the reaping time of the new crop, the old flood-seed is sown, so that in the rain and flood-time, the fields are once again full of that submersible paddy.64 (By contrast, the land "protected" from water by the embankments loses the fertilizing algae, thus providing an opportunity for the enhancement of the debt trap and the destruction of the ecobiome by the peddling of chemi- cal fertilizers.) I hesitate to call this silent interruption "flood management" by exporting a metaphor of Nature as the "great laboratorium, the arsenal which furnishes both means and material of labor," coming from (what is confusedly called) European culture, producing an evolutionary account.65 I hesitate to denominate the responsible deconstruction (learning critique from within, leading to a new setting-to-work, as in Derrida's reading of Heidegger) as "technology transfer," as if a "gift" from a superior civilization. Count this interruption in the nature of a permanent parabasis, the peasant's rather than the philosopher's disarticulated rhetoric, a setting-to- work, not an explication, of the philosopher's dream. Ask the question again: What exactly does the fulfilled dream of Reason bring about on its way? If the subaltern offers us, say, learning, and the ecological deconstructor supplements this with the persistently intermediary stage of its transfor- mation into exchangeable, but internalized, knowledge (not merely knowl- edge of knowledge), the "murderous" supplement of the animal-machine bypasses the implication of responsibility with subjectity, even freedom of intention, and substitutes information command. This figure of evil continues the work of imperialism by destroying what is, no doubt confusedly, called "culture," in this case a popular culture, traditional learning and knowledge, traditional agronomic patterns, and, what I have left until last, the traditional pattern of subaltern women's freedom on the impermanent floating islands, or chors.66 In place of the destroyed culture of learning, a continually ex- 64.

A large sec- tion of the postcolonial subjects of Bangladesh is, of course, crazy about Geographical Information Systems, and not in the service of accountable reason. They provide the "European" interminable dialogists the opportu- nity to invoke "the Bangladeshis" as the willing beneficiaries, just as the interminable dialogists at the end of Of Spirit had invoked the "Messianic Jew... and the Moslem" (OS, 111). The question or affirmation about the intractable agency of the specter is left open at the end of Of Spirit, since its textual function is nothing more (and nothing less) than the transcription of spirit as ghost.67 Derrida has written elsewhere on spectrality in connection with Marx.68 Is it possible to imagine that, since responsibility must bind the call of the ethical to a response, that one must act here as if responsibly to the specter called "commune-ism," whose threat Development must des- velopment and the continuity of subaltern insurgency, a permanent parabasis: "By the mid-eighteenth century, the Bengalis had extensively engineered the delta, both to protect against floods and to ensure that the silt-bearing river-waters could fertilize and irrigate fields. The first Britons to travel across the delta reported seeing thousands of kilometers of canals and embankments. .... What they never realized, says Willcocks [the imperial water engineer who first made sense of the structures in a report published in 1930] was that the primary purpose of the canals was to irrigate and fertilize the land of the delta ... The British oversaw the gradual destruction of the ancient feudal system under which landlords forced peasants to maintain the dykes and clear the canals. .... As the canals silted up, they began to overflow and became, for the British, 'a menace to the coun- try.' Inspectors were appalled to see that the peasant farmers continued to cut holes in the canals, and the British police, who tried to stop them .... Willcocks concluded with proposals for the restoration of the ancient works, in order to 'bring in again the wealth which central [the larger part of today's Bangladesh flood plain] and west Bengal once enjoyed.'... The ancient works took many years to construct. They were built, moreover, in small steps, bending to the will of the rivers at each stage. It was a training, rather than a taming, of the rivers. The Bangladeshi authorities and their foreign advisers today show neither the patience nor the contrition to adopt such an approach. They want to mould the rivers to their design" (Fred Pearce, The Dammed: Rivers, Dams, and the Coming World Water Crisis [London: The Bodley Head, 1992], 243-45). The peasants and fishers are still cutting embankments. 67. If the French revenant provides one sort of link with the entire chain on venir in Der- rida's work to the extent that the subterranean neologism e-venir occupies the place of the presenting of the present, the English provides its own kind of commentary by clan- destinely making visible Heidegger's kinship with Christian metaphysics: the holy ghost. 68.

That setting-to-work need not call on a European left monoculture.69 This space of intimate learning, of human-animal-watery ground, is, after all, an ongoing response to the weave of land and river by the landless and on common waters. Nothing but an intermediary question can be posed and left suspended in the space of an essay. Because we have less power than the World Bank, and because some of us are of color, when we confront the World Bank, we sometimes claim that the subaltern speaks. Also, as I have indicated before, if an academic includes empirical details in her essays, joins demonstrations, participates in international conferences with political-sounding titles, and engages in solidarity tourism, we think of her as an activist. Such assump- tions might be put in their place by the fact that (1) the World Bank took little notice of the organized protesters at the conference; and (2) in order to locate the subaltern, the heterogeneous collection of subjects in the space of difference-from the two "Europes" and from those who can protest at a conference at a parliament-we will have to cross other frontiers. This conference was, however, an intermediary stage of strategic and tactical setting-to-work that involved a range from heads of the donor states all the way down to low-level functionaries of the client state, people involved, di- rectly and indirectly, in making decisions and implementing them, decisions not always made in the night of non-knowledge, and affecting the subaltern. To address (1) above concretely, I cite extracts from an internal memo circulated by the deputy director of the Environment Department of the World Bank. This is his answer to the question, "What happened at the conference?": There must have been 30-40 Bangladeshis present (all seemingly opposing FAP), with a smaller group of about six, who were official speakers. These, I understand from Ross Wallace, are the standard characters appearing at all the FAP events in Dhaka. They are, as you know, extremely articulate, and complement each other very well. Professor Shapan Adnan gives the fact in great detail, K[h]ushi Kabir gives a sociological perspective (giving emphasis to the in- come distributional and women's issues) [Ms. Kabir had in fact been 69.

Dr. Hashemi (a very sym- pathetic person I thought) gives the economic, Mohiuddin Farooq[ue] presents the legal questions (a very nice fellow, but didn't make much sense), and a young woman (Mushrefa Mishu) who is presi- dent of the Student Unity Forum, gives the passionate anti-colonial anti-establishment stuff, which the adults wouldn't get away with.70 This is a silencing of protest, of course. Anti-imperialist discourse is put in its place with cynical flippancy. In case the World Bank should be obliged to back down (the protest meant something, after all), as they were in the case of the Narmada Valley Project in India in March, 1993, a formula for recoding defeat as victory is given in advance: A clear statement from the Bank on the size and composition of the program emerging from the Regional Studies could perhaps help position us better from an external relations standpoint-although perhaps not with the government. Absent that, the opposition will strengthen in Europe and possibly in the US, and if a year from now a much more modest program does emerge, the NGOs [nongovern- mental organizations, presumably Bangladeshi] will claim victory. This makes it clear that the interminable exchange is indeed be- tween Europe and Europe. The "others" can be dismissed as poor players, a stale act. But we must also note that the issue is how to claim responsi- bility for a "victory," to stage recapitulation in such a way that it looks like a responsible response to reasoned inquiry. All responsibility is a simulacrum of responsibility, perhaps. But all complicities with this necessity are not equivalent. And what Derrida has said, with justified irritation, about those who respond to responsibility with the cant of the decentered subject is nothing compared to what can be said to those who act out the reasoned responsibility of Europe to the people of the rest of the world in the interest of the self-determination of international capital: Whence comes the law that forbids one to forgive whoever does not know how to give? "I saw then clearly that his aim had been to do a good deed while at the same time making a good deal; to earn forty cents and the heart of God; to win paradise economically; in short, to pick up gratis the certificate of a charitable man....

There is no genuine effort on the part of any- one to ask the rural poor what they think or want." It is to be noted that no remedy is indicated for this problem anywhere in the memo. No genuine effort can, of course, be made by the programming dream of the perfect animal-machine to accommodate the singular rhythm of human/animal/ water. And, on the mundane register, it is absurd to think that the ethical rhythm of responsive transference with the Bangladeshi subaltern can ever become the necessary, but impossible, goal for the functionaries and asso- ciates of the bank. The infinite care with which Derrida had compiled a list of the duties of the new Europe, and then reminded the self-same Europe that a list of quite other duties silently supposes it, can never become a part of the bank's investment in Development.72 The point is, however, that even when the bank is questioned by the representatives of a Europe that is responsible to the human being in Nature, the subaltern is silenced. In conclusion, a few hints. The feasibility of sane technology transfer by building on traditional flood-management methods was elaborated with care and precision by the president of the International Rivers Network, based in Berkeley. No one but the Bangladeshis knew that in the overlong Bengali speech of Abdus Sattar Khan, an aging leader of the peasant movement, this flood-management technique, and the detailed account of all the major rivers in Bangladesh, was given in an old-fashioned perorative way. I am not romanticizing this particular person. He is not a "great leader" and is apparently not specifically associated with the mobilization against the Flood Action Plan. I certainly do not know enough about him to credit him with authenticity, simply because, in that company of card- carrying international activists and Development officials, he seemed a guileless old man. But there can be little doubt that he was staged as a slice of the authentic, a piece of the real Bangladesh. If the World Bank's internal memo represents the silencing of protest, the misfiring of the staging of this elderly man is also a species of silencing. 71. Derrida, Given Time, 31, 32-33.

But even here, we are not in the register of the speech of the every- day frustration of the quietly "flood-managing" fisher and farmer with the incomprehensible giant systematically destroying their established rhythm of existence. It is often forgotten that the persuasive accomplices of the World Bank are, in appearance, well-meaning, educated Bangladeshis extend- ing help to these subalterns. The first impulse that comes from below is of trust-in-responsibility. And, indeed, Sattar Khan had come to the confer- ence trusting, trusting that his old-fashioned, fact-filled speech against the FAP would be heard. And, although in his case the trust was not in principle misplaced, there was such a great gulf fixed between his own perception of how to play his role in a theater of responsibility and the structure into which he was inserted that there was no hope for a felicitous performance from the very start. In order to hear him, "Europe" would need him to represent responsibility, by reflex, in "Europe"'s way. In other words, he would have to change his mind-set. That is how the old colonial subject was shaped. When we do it, we call it education. To begin with, the European Parliament had no provision for simul- taneous translation from the Bengali. In the event, an imperfect English translation was read out of synch by a Bangladeshi who was attending ("participating in") the conference, and it was this imperfect, well-meaning, amateur production that was available through the headphones in simul- taneous translation in the other conference languages. For the first time, the hall was full of impatient hubbub: "European" discipline was breaking down. The man's style, practiced on a lifetime of subcontinental popular oratory-another theater that Kipling was already mocking in the nineteenth century-declaimed with now-ridiculous passion to an absent audience. (The Bangladeshis present, from a younger, more professional generation, swung between embarrassment and sympathy.) Of course, Sattar Khan's paper far exceeded the twenty allotted minutes. In the monumental struc- turing we inhabit, the exceeding of allotted time is negotiable and depends on gender, status, and the temperament of the moderator. In this case, the benevolent egalitarian young U.S. moderator cut the speaker off. Sattar Khan responded, in generally incomprehensible Bengali, with a "Friend, I am a poor peasant"-which was not, strictly speaking, the case, but under the circumstances, a fair rhetorical representation and, I have no doubt, infinitely more effective in those simulacra of parliamentarianism that we</page><page sequence="44">62 boundary 2 / Fall 1994 encounter in former colonies, where the battle is between who is and is not a colonial subject rather than on grounds of cultural difference-"you must hear me out!" Therefore, he was, of course, allowed to continue by way of a gesture of benevolence toward someone who could not understand the rules. He read then at breakneck speed, and the entire ad hoc effort at translation collapsed. This incident can only stand in for the subaltern's inability to speak, for Mr. Sattar, a middle-class peasant party leader, was far, indeed, from the landless peasant and the grass-roots fisher, however "indigenous" he was by contrast with the other participants. It stands in successfully, however- by virtue of the fact that the subaltern's inability to speak is predicated upon an attempt to speak, to which no appropriate response is proffered.73 It is, in fact, a failure of responsibility in the addressee that can be reckoned irrespective of the fact that all communication is infected by destinerrance.74 In 1991, before I had read Of Spirit, I had written as follows about the subaltern inhabitants of the cyclone- and tidal-wave-prone southeast coast of Bangladesh: If this was an eco-logic where the unlikely material subject was the pulse of the tide and the rhythm of the water-logging of the wind, I was in no way ready, daily encountering these very people's savvy discussions of the U.S. Task Force ... simply to narrativize them as an earlier pre-scientific stage where the proper help was to "control" Nature so that these people could be redefined as passive.... What would it be to learn otherwise, here? Better offer the contradiction: they will not move except as unwilling refugees .... I could respect the relief workers' bemused on-the-spot decision that this other kind of resistance to rehabilitation must not be allowed to develop into an aporia. But the vestiges of intellectual sophistication I possessed saw through with distaste the long-distance theorist's dismissal of the aporia as anachrony or his embracing of it as the saving grace of a-chrony. I was adrift.75 73. I have tried to show an extreme case of this, where a woman tried to "speak" in- surgency against a regulative psychobiography by inscribing her body in death, and at a deferred time, and yet was not able to secure a response, from upwardly mobile women of her own family, two generations removed ("Can the Subaltern Speak?" in Master Discourse, Native Informant, Harvard University Press, forthcoming). 74.

I am not satisfied with so easy a reasoning.76 Was there no lesson there at all to learn, then? Is the subaltern transparent? This may seem inconsequential to the reader, but it is precisely this type of uncaring damming of a drift that marks Heidegger's generalization of the animal. There is, according to the view I am discussing here, no gauge of intention but rational expectations, logical self-interest, reason written by something confusedly called European common sense. The subaltern mental theater is no bigger than this, just as for population control, the subaltern female is nothing but a crotch. There is something like a relation- ship between this and the perverse dream of fulfilled Reason, although all complicities are not equivalent. No doubt these easy generalities come out of exchange with local people, sometimes through relayed networking, rightly perceived as a con- trast to the World Bank's structured alibi for consultation with the subaltern. Yet, the complicity is in that abyssal power of "European" exchange, for responsibility is still traduced here by impatience and inattention. I will close with an example of the silent gnawing of such a betrayal. In "Birth of a Megaproject," James Boyce, an authoritative witness against irresponsible Development, claims that "[t]he Bengali language dis- tinguishes between the normal beneficial floods of the rainy season, which are termed barsha, and harmful floods of abnormal depth and timing, which are termed bonna. The English word flood conflates these two very different phenomena."77 The sources cited are Bangladeshi. Boyce's observation is repeated in a number of subsequent Western articles; I am presuming that Boyce is the source of this. His interpretation of the information is incorrect, in a way common to genuine, but anthropologistic, Euro-U.S. benevolence, as if someone, hearing people use "see you later" and "see you soon" inter- changeably, should claim for the English language a profound philosophy of time where soon and later were identical. Professor M. Aminul Islam, who is cited by Dr. Paul, Boyce's direct source, writes as follows: 76. See, for example, an otherwise excellent piece by Peter Custers, "Banking on a Flood- Free Future? Flood Mismanagement in Bangladesh," Ecologist 22, no. 5 (Sept.-Oct. 1992): 244, 246. 77. Boyce, "Birth of a Megaproject," 419.</page><page sequence="46">64 boundary 2 / Fall 1994 In all the three study villages flooding is referred to [as] barsha and bonna [This idiosyncratic construction carries a trace of the names of two different kinds of times, perhaps]. ... Barsha (June-October) is a normal inundation and is taken as a benevolent agent. ... Bonna is perceived as disastrous.78 Neither of these native Bengali speakers is making a claim for Ben- gali (or, indeed, many north Indian languages), where barsha-&lt; Sanskrit varsa, a nominal construction from the verbal root vrs, meaning, roughly, "to drop down"-means "rain" or "rainy season." What they are claiming is that, in their study area and in "ecologically similar" areas, when the sub- altern says "the rains," s/he includes a certain normal inundation. If time and historical circumstance had obliged the English speakers to take as much trouble with Bengali as a foreign linguist has to with European lan- guages in order to venture a remark about meaning in published prose about the general language, this "authoritative" comment on Bengali would not have been offered. And I am not speaking of high Bengali either but of the mother tongue spoken by the illiterate expert of "flood management." Monthlies and bleeding are not good and bad words for bleeding in the English language. In the context of this water-borne land still in the making in the rough theater of mountain and wind, the strict differentiation between rain and flood fixed in the (Indo-)"European" mind-set is persistently deconstructed, the one implying the other. When the balance is disturbed so that the oppo- sition begins to come clear again, the signification is: disaster. However sympathetic the intention, to rob the mother tongue of the subaltern by way of an ignorant authoritative definition that is already becoming part of the accepted benevolent lexicography is a most profound silencing. These words, too many, can only point you toward such silences. 78. M.
