<plain_text><page sequence="1">Church, Abortion, Irish Society Raphael Gallagher The debate on abortion, and the related issues of the right to travel and freedom of information, can be approached as separate dilemmas facing the Church in Ireland this autumn. My argument will revolve on the opinion that the forthcoming debate should be understood as a catalyst for other fundamental questions of how the Church sees its participation in the shaping of society in Ireland 1992. If the abortion and related debates are addressed in the wrong context, fundamental aspects of the Church's mission could be dangerously compromised. I am thinking of the type of mistake implied in the comment of D. H. Lawrence's essay Apropos of Lady Chatterley's Lover: The desires of the moment are easy to recognize but the others, the deeper desires, are difficult. It is the business of our chief thinkers to tell us of our deeper desires, not to keep shrilling our little desires into our ears.' The mission of the Church is to call people to discipleship, giv ing witness to the values of a gospel way of life. This witness is at the service of establishing the conditions necessary for God's reign of love, justice, peace and freedom. The litmus test for faith in Jesus Christ is not reducible to any single issue. It is the Creed which defines the necessary conditions for membership of the Church at the service of the Kingdom of God. Abortion is a critical issue on its own terms: I am not denying that. My claim is, rather, that if the Church sees the abortion issue in isolation from the wider context of the mission of the Church, we are both narrowing the debate on abortion and risk ing serious damage to the mission of the Church in the long term. That is the modest aim of this article. In my view there are gospel-related arguments that can illustrate why abortion as a moral norm is not compatible with a Christian ethic. But I am worried that, on the one hand, we can use bad arguments to defend a good cause and, on the other, that we can get so Raphael Gallagaher is Provincial of the Irish Redemptorists. Address: Marianella, Orwell Road, Rathgar, Dublin 6. 459</page><page sequence="2">THE FURROW entangled in a single issue that we miss the emerging spiritual questions of our society which have deeper, if not so immediately politically pressing, consequences for the preaching of the gospel in Ireland. THE PRESENT SITUATION The Church in Ireland is going through a period of low energy, damaged morale and drifting leadership. How we approach the abortion debate will say much about the reversal or continuation of these trends. For some, a rigid authoritarian role exercised by the Church is the optimum way to reverse the above trends. I do not share this view because the Church's mission rests on the gift of faith which, admittedly, should lead to deep moral convic tions. It is clear that people do not need to have faith, as I am using the term, to lead moral lives. The problem is that the Church could try to use the power of moral authoritarianism to force people into a nominal acceptance of the Christian way of life. That would do violence both to the free gift of faith and to the consciences of those who have either left the Church or who never belonged to it. Given the many public and emotional aspects of the abortion debate, it is going to be difficult for the Roman Catholic Church to clarify what its agenda is. This is not a criticism of the validity of public comment; the problem is within the Church. Although the core mission of the Church is related to proclaiming the values of the gospel, it is unrealistic to think of the Church, in an idealized way, separated from the world. What concerns me is not the Church's involvement in political debate, but the wrong type of involvement. The Church should not allow itself to become a political power-broker in particular political debates. In these debates there will be winners and losers. The irony of such scenarios is that the combination of the alienation of the 'losers', together with the perception of the Church as a political power-broker may make short-term political gains; however, in the longer term, the freedom to preach the gospel with honesty, and to do that to all and not just to those who are 'on our side', is lessened. At the centre of a Church of disciples is the free act of faith: this is a platitude, but it can be easily undermined by the percep tion of the Church as authoritarian, repressive or intolerant of new thinking. It is a matter of discussion whether the Church is really so as it is perceived by many, but pastorally, I am regularly meeting people for whom the perception is real, for them. Some of the perceptions I encounter are: women feel not listened to and a male Church is not really interested in their 460</page><page sequence="3">CHURCH, ABORTION, IRISH SOCIETY stories or insights; many lay people feel not trusted by the Church authorities; the Church (whatever about the theory of the communion of the people of God) is experienced as clerical and male in its structures and mode of operation; our preach ing can often reinforce guilt-feelings rather than encourage forgiveness and the freedom of children loved by a tender God. CONSEQUENCES These attitudes have pastoral consequences of significance for my concerns in this article: 1. The power-model of the Church is increasing the sense of alienation of many Catholics. Those of us with positions of public authority within the Christian community can appear arrogant, however sincere our personal goodwill to understand people on the level of counselling or sacramental celebration. 2. Traditionally, the Church dealt with questions of personal morality in private and we developed a nuanced way of doing so, through distinctions like the objective-subjective orders and the use of principles to be applied with pastoral benignity in our sacramental practice. What is new for the Church in Ireland is the public nature of moral debate: Church authorities can no longer hope to control what is publicly discussed, or who offers a view on what. The Church has become overly defensive about this public dimension of moral debate. Resorting to the language of authority and power is not a good substitute for dialogue and participation in public discussions. These perceptions, with their pastoral consequences, clarify the current agenda for the Church. A Church that is interested, in the first instance, in preserving authority and defending the present form of the institution fails to be sensitive to the emergent faith-spiritual questions of being Catholic. Many people are looking for fresh ways of experiencing the Church as community and then applying the light of the gospel to their struggles of faith and doubt. It is not that people want to rewrite the gospel to suit their own agenda - though no doubt this may be the wish of some, as it has been in all eras of the Church. The problem is that if the Church is perceived as having pre-given institutional answers, this is intimidating for people who have new questions and experiences. I sense a new spiritual awareness in the Church and an open ness to find solutions to modern problems in line with the gospel. The blocking point centres on the way the Church is organized: answers that are given from above may not be in correspondence with the questions raised from below. When this happens, 461</page><page sequence="4">THE FURROW the truth in the answer is inaccessible because it is not in line with the aspect of truth sought through the new question. There is the further problem of dealing with the ambiguity of life. The legalistic categories of an authoritarian mind, almost by definition, do not achieve this. Life is ambivalent, rarely more so than in terms of personally distressing moral problems. Very often the best we can hope for is that the gospel principles of life can be integrated and applied to doing the truth in love. Of course, an institutional model of Church will not deny this in theory, but, in practice, it can make the process difficult. What gospel discipleship does is to give a directive sense of solving tragic problems, a communicated feeling for dealing with ambiguity rather than a pre-given answer. I am thinking of stories like that of the woman taken in adultery. The directive sense of Jesus' response is clear, the feelings of ambivalence of the woman (and of the crowd) are communicated. But much is left hanging in the air. None of the foregoing invalidates the Church's authority to teach. What it implies, however, is that the mode in which the teaching is done has consequences for the effectiveness of the Church's proclamation of the gospel. Given the near-certainty of a public debate on abortion and related topics, I will draw guidelines, arising from the above comments, for Church par ticipation in the debate. 1. The whole Church is called to proclaim the gospel. Within the total Church the Hierarchy are the ultimate custodians of the truth of the Word. 2. Thought they are the custodians of the Word, the Hierarchy are not the exclusive possessors of the Word; the teachers can also learn, especially from those whose experience brings a dif ferent insight. This is particularly true in the area of abortion. The experience in choosing or rejecting abortion is articulated best by those who make the decision: women. 3. Because the whole Church is called to proclaim the gospel, the various vocations within the Church should support and complement each other. 4. In proclaiming the gospel the Church's main task is to witness to the truth of what is essential to our faith and this witness is primarily the responsibility of the Hierarchy in that they are in the apostolic line of the first witnesses of the mighty deeds of God (cf. Luke 24:18 ff). 5. Besides the foundational duty of witness, the proclamation of the gospel involves the further task of clarifying what may not be obvious. This complementary task should be esteemed within the Church: to give witness to the truth and to scientifically 462</page><page sequence="5">CHURCH, ABORTION, IRISH SOCIETY explore the formulation of that truth in an ongoing way are com plementary and not opposing tasks. 6. The proclamation of the gospel is always with a view to influencing the concrete lives of people, ambiguous as they often are. No proper proclamation can ignore concrete circumstances and no proclamation is gospel-based if it leads one further away from the possibility of encountering Jesus, which can happen either through the watering down of gospel demands or through a guilt-provoking moralism that would deny that the power of grace is abundantly greater than the shackles of sin. There is a particular lesson here for preachers: it is easy to condemn the evil of abortion in general moralistic tones and forget that in your congregation are people struggling to rebuild their lives after, very slowly and painfully, coming to terms with the possibility of forgiveness, A PASTORAL EXAMPLE An illustration from my own pastoral experience might con cretize what I have so far been trying to articulate. Several years ago I received a phone call from a young girl who informed me that she was pregnant. She was unmarried, living in a flat and though reared in a strict Catholic home had not been to Mass for some years. She told me she was going to England on a flight later that night for an abortion the next morning. I asked her to meet me: I spent three hours with her, first listening to her story and then trying to argue that there were real and practical alter natives to having an abortion. She was emotionally distraught and it soon became clear to me that she was not hearing my arguments. Because she was so shocked, emotionally shattered and genuinely frightened of her family's reaction if they found out about the pregnancy, she could see only one solution. I did my best, but she took the flight to England and had the abortion. About a month later she contacted me again. I felt I was meeting a different girl. She was in deep remorse over what she had done and could not understand how she had agreed to hav ing an abortion. She wanted to receive the sacrament of recon ciliation, which she did. I tried to explain her guilt in terms of her state of mind at the time of the abortion: whether she had the necessary freedom in her action (because of her agitated emo tional state) or the necessary knowledge (because she was not actually thinking of what she was doing), I left to the judgment of God, but I tried to communicate to her that her sense of guilt now was one thing, her sense of moral repsonsibility at the time of the abortion a more uncertain thing. I advised her to receive counselling and encouraged her to take up again the practice of 463</page><page sequence="6">THE FURROW her faith, both of which she did. A year later she was at Mass, where the sermon was on abortion. Here I clearly have only her word for it but what she heard from the sermon was that abor tion was such an abominable evil that it is doubtful if God would forgive such people, they were all excommunicated anyhow and the guilt of what a person does in abortion will haunt them till the day they die. The girl has not since gone back to Mass. This is a true story, in capsule form, and I do not claim it to be representative. But it made a deep impression on me as to how the Church should approach the abortion dilemma in general and public debate in particular. The circumstances of each case can be different; the fragility of many women who find them selves pregnant is real; moralizing preaching can do immeasurable harm. PARTICIPANTS IN THE PUBLIC DEBATE My comments so far have concentrated on the context in which I believe the Church should approach the abortion debate in Ireland. The debate will be a public one: it might be interesting to reflect, briefly, on how other participants in the debate approach the question, for example, politicians and the media. Political language, naturally, reflects the agenda of a parti cular party. It might be useful to examine how the abortion language of a political party coheres with their general economic and social policies. Suspicion could attach to the language of politicians if, for instance, their language on abortion implies one tone while their language on economics implies a different tone. Similarly, abortion-language in the media should be scrut inized. I understand, from a communications point of view, the need to simplify issues: but the media may be failing in their public service responsibilities if they allow the debate on abor tion to be conducted through language that is confined more often to slogans than to clarifying phrases. Similar to the point made about political parties, it might be useful to see how consis tent is the media-use of language about abortion. Church language on abortion should be subjected to the same scrutiny as political and media language. There is, within the Church as in the other fora, the danger of using slogans to avoid real debate and much the same fear of examining the assump tions on which Church language on abortion is framed. I would note some of the following mistakes in our Church talk on abor tion: a confusion between biological life and the human person, an imbalance in the comparative evaluation of foetal and mater nal life, an anthropomorphic concept of God which sees God as 464</page><page sequence="7">CHURCH, ABORTION, IRISH SOCIETY the direct cause of events which are more properly the result of humanly controlled causes, a confusion between arguments based on reason with those based on authority. The Church, too, can confuse public debate on abortion by using imprecise language. I will try to draw together some of the lessons from the above points. 1. Given that any public discussion of moral issues in Ireland tends to be acrimonious, it would be helpful if the Catholic Church saw herself as a contributor and not as final arbiter. The charism of infallibility relates to matters of doctrine referring to the life of the Church; there is no such guarantee of infallibility in matters of public policy and debate. To be the final arbiter of doctrine for its own members is one thing: to contribute to a public debate that is reaching out for new solutions to current problems is guarded by the virtues of humility and prudence rather than the guarantee of indefectibility in matters doctrinal. 2. Given the variety, indeed incompatibility, of the phil osophic assumptions of those engaged in the public debate on what is a human issue, and not only a religious one, the Church should rely on the power of argument rather than on the argu ment of power. 3. Given that the Christian view of life tends to be maximalist (e.g. in the language of perfection) and that the language of politicians, especially when talking about law, tends to be minimalist (e.g. in the general effort to include as many view points as possible) the Church should present her arguments as a call to a particular vocation rather than as a threat to impose sanctions on those who disagree. 4. Given that the Christian message is not, in se, dependent on any particular political philosophy, the Church should be wary of being identified with or manipulated by political or media philosophies, of whatever hue. I accept that the Church, in public debate, should try to use philosophically accessible language, rather than religious language in the technical sense. But if the Church's own doctrine becomes so tied to a particular mode of philosophic language it will appear that Aristotle or Thomas or Plato is our saviour and not Jesus Christ. The basis of the call to live the moral life as Christians will become hopelessly confused between adherence to humanly-formulated philosophies and an inner surrender to Jesus the Lord of all life. A reflection on the present situation in our country will serve as an introduction to clarifying this point. THE LANGUAGE IN PUBLIC DEBATE I would note two significant current trends in public debate in Ireland: religion is increasingly seen as a matter of private choice 465</page><page sequence="8">THE FURROW which should have minimal public influence; morality is similarly seen as a matter of private conscience and insofar as this imp inges publicly, it should be done through law that is as non interventionist as possible, subject to constraints of the common good. If these trends are the prevailing ones, or at least very com mon, it will mean that the abortion debate will be circumscribed by these assumptions. Generally speaking, official Church statements use the word in an exhortatory sense ('abortion is an abominable crime') to urge a particular form of conduct. This use of language has biblical antecedents (e.g. 1 Cor. 13:4 ff). Its use, however, should be cir cumscribed by the already mentioned guidelines which define the Church as the communion of baptized believers rather than an ordered institution of the teachers and the taught. Another cau tion is necessary in the exhortatory use of the word abortion. It tends to be a tautological term, in that the word already includes the qualifying terms and implied circumstances which make it morally unjustified. The major contribution of the Church to a public debate on abortion may be on another level of discourse, that of morally normative language. Though there is a technical distinction, I believe that the confusion between the exhortatory and normative use of abortion language is a common error in public debate. The language of exhortation urges a particular form of con duct but does not deal, as such, with explaining the validity of the pros and cons of particular prohibitions. The language of normative morality deals with such questions and tries to explain what is to count as unjust conduct, and why. What is missing in Church discourse about abortion is the freedom to clarify what abortion means at the level of a moral norm. This touches on the role of theological debate. Clearly, no theologian should present a private view as if it were official Church teaching, or of equal authority to it, or as if no previous authoritative teaching on the matter has to be taken into account. Equally, the teaching of the whole Church suffers if theologi cal debate is not encouraged, precisely to understand better and probe deeper the meaning of God's will. The teaching charism of the hierarchy is to witness to the faith: the scholarly gift of theologians is to probe hidden meanings and explain what may not be immediately obvious. To identify the truth and to explore the inner meaning of the truth are com plementary, not contradictory, roles. Though others could quote more restrictive statements from other popes, I find the state ment of Paul VI helpful: 466</page><page sequence="9">CHURCH, ABORTION, IRISH SOCIETY The magisterium of the Church cannot propose moral norms until it is certain of interpreting the will of God. And to reach this certainty, the Church is not dispensed from research and from examining the many questions proposed for her consideration from every part of the world. This is at times a long and not an easy task (AAS, 58 [1966], 219). HISTORICAL BACKGROUND The historical development of the Church's teaching on abortion may be a useful starting point in our search for appropriate con temporary Church language on abortion. Though abortion was quite common in Roman society, the prohibition of abortion was absolute in the early Church, a position broadly supported by the medical profession through the Hippocratic oath. The opposition of Christians to abortion was developed in a pro abortion society through appeal to Christian insight rather than to law. Distinction between formed and unformed foetuses, and the related question of ensoulment, were not seen as central to the argument: they were of relevance only in the sense of clarify ing what type of sin was involved in abortion. The position of the early Church on abortion was strongly counter-cultural and enshrined a value that is 'almost absolute' for Christians, to use the words of John Noonan, who is the authoritative historian on the issue. As canonical legislation assumed a greater role in the Church, theologians were forced to examine the conflict situations of real life not directly covered by law. Thus, Sanchez (1550-1610) argued for some exceptions to the absolute ban, particularly in cases of rape, a view accepted as probable (and thus theologically tenable even if not entirely the safest opinion) by St Alphonsus Liguori (1696-1787). What the classic theologians of morality tried to achieve (and St Alphonsus is pre-eminent here) was to preserve the core truth of an absolute prohibition of abortion, but to do so through nuanced principles that allowed a balance of application in different and difficult cases, particularly where the value of the mother's life was to be given greater moral weight. Since the pontificate of Leo XIII (1878-1903) the canonical prohibition of abortion has become stricter, for varying reasons: abortion was becoming a public policy in many countries; medical science was increasingly capable of solving older cases of foetal-maternal conflict, and the debates of theologians were judged by the official Church to be unhelpful to the Church's public political opposition to the growth of a pro-abortion lobby. The current official position of the Church, reflecting the 467</page><page sequence="10">THE FURROW near absolute prohibition of abortion, is usually formulated in a principle like: 'no direct killing of the innocent is morally permissible'. LESSONS FOR TODAY Using this generalized summary as a backdrop, I will highlight some important elements for the approach of the Church to the dilemma of abortion now. 1. The early Church insight on the absolute moral wrongness of abortion comes from Christian insight in a society where the Christian view was counter-cultural. Secular and canonical laws later came to reflect this insight. Though the abortion debate now is a human rights issue, rather than a specially religious one, the above insight may still have validity as to where we, as Church, place the weight of our energies in the abortion debate. 2. Aristotelian biology, the debates on formed and unformed foetuses and the question of ensoulment, are peripheral to the abortion debate. They are theories from a previous age, now scientifically discredited. The two core issues today are, as in the past: 'What determines when a being is human?' and Ts it ever lawful to kill human life?' Those who appeal to the above, discredited, theories, seem to be trying to prove that the Church's official abortion teaching was in some way once, more liberal. This is to miss the point. All that can be proved historically is that the Church has shown the possibility of doctrinal development within the same absolute value-truth. I find it ironic that it is not the 'liberal' lobby for abortion who appeal to past theories, a practice more usually indulged in by 'conservatives' and with equally dubious credibility. It is clear that the Church should avoid any appeal to outdated biology. Equally, however, Church language should be sensitive to contemporary scientific research. There is a vigorous debate, among scientists, as to the process of the development of the human person. It is important for Church language to be framed in a way that can both debate with science and incorporate new doctrinal insights when that is appropriate. Even if we work with the 'safer' view, taking fertilization rather than other moments as decisive in the process of personhood (as advocated in the 1974 Vatican Declaration, On Procured Abortion, par. 13) we should do so in a way that allows further development of our definitions, if necessary. Otherwise we may be again making the mistake, already alluded to, of confusing the languages of biology and personhood. The advice of Professor Tony 468</page><page sequence="11">CHURCH, ABORTION, IRISH SOCIETY Glenister, formerly Professor of Anatomy in the University of London, is worth pondering: One must hope that the theologians, moralists and jurists will realize that the conception and formation of an individual is a process extending over a period of time and that it is difficult to define precisely the biological status of the early developing being at any particular moment. The timing of a flash of light can be established precisely: the timing of a dawn is much less precise: its significance may however be transcendent (The Tablet, 2 December 1989, p. 1401). 3. The recent development of the Church's opposition to abor tion in, primarily, canonical terms has had a negative effect on the proper role of theology in the service of articulating moral norms. 4. The use of civil law to solve the personal dilemmas of abor tion also needs to be carefully analyzed. It has been acknow ledged by Cardinal (then Bishop) Daly that 'the pressure to conform morally to what is legally permissible becomes all per vasive' (stated in an interview, The Irish Times, 4 December 1980). What has happened in Ireland seems to be as follows: Since the 1970s the episcopal Conference has acknowledged the right of the legislature to enact laws according to their own judgment, while affirming the right of the bishops to give their own views on the moral aspects of any particular law. The pastoral conse quences of this strategy need to be more positively addressed within the Church. Law will always be an imperfect mechanism for the enforce ment of moral norms. No legislation, however well framed, can take account of all the moral ambiguities of life. To try to cover every possible situation would be a legal nightmare and is bound to give rise to distortions, contradictions and perhaps even injustices. Given the inadequacy of law, as a way of solving dilemmas of the moral conscience, it seems inevitable that the episcopal Conference will have reservations about many of our laws. But having acknowledged the right of the legislature to pass laws according to their own best judgment of the common good, I believe that the emphasis of the Church in approaching issues of public morality needs a reassessment. This takes me back to the mission of the Church which is to give witness to a gospel way of life. That way of life is seldom straightforward and abortion may be one of the personal dilemmas encountered. If the law is an uncertain instrument to convey Christian insight, then it would be misleading for the 469</page><page sequence="12">THE FURROW Church, in the context of its overall mission, to place too much emphasis on the law-debate. That may prove to be the major challenge for the Church in the debate about abortion: while participating in this public debate, how does the Church avoid being so identified with one or other legal stand that the deeper conscience issues raised by abortion are not addressed through the healing light of the message of Jesus? 5. The formula 'no direct killing of the innocent' has func tioned well as long as the double-effect theory and the direct/ indirect distinctions are accepted. It would be unwise for the Church to ignore the current vigorous theological debate about these issues. The meaning of 'direct' is disputed and, in any case, it is little consolation for anyone to know they are going to be killed, but 'only indirectly'. I appreciate that the above theory and distinctions helped to preserve the sense of a moral absolute while allowing for limited exceptions. Is it possible for the Church to find other ways of formulating a prohibition on abortion that do not, in practice, undermine the exhortatory prohibition that abortion is a moral evil? It is possible at least to speculate about the possibility of such formulae, for instance: Human life in the womb enjoys the absolute respect due to all human life; if a conflict arises which threatens two lives, that of child and mother, one should, while endeavouring to save both lives, try to save the life of the mother rather than allow two lives to perish; in the immediate aftermath of the violent crimes of rape or incest medically supervised intervention can be considered. I want to stress that the above is offered simply as an example for consideration. There would want to be close theological examination of any new formula before it could be accepted as solid pastoral guidance, or before it could be demonstrated to be a better formula than the traditional one. It would be particu larly interesting, and appropriate, to have a reasoned inter change of such formulae between members of other Christian Churches, as well as with the theologians of my own Church. If we are able to discuss various ecumenical attempts to refor mulate a common Christian doctrine of the Eucharist, it should be possible to hope for a calm ecumenical debate about the ques tion of abortion and how best to formulate Christian principles to guide us on this question too. Many aspects have not been touched on in this article: for instance, technical legal and medical questions. My concern has been a particular one: what is the proper context for the Church to consider the abortion question and how can the Church be a partner in a public debate on abortion. How this concern is 470</page><page sequence="13">CHURCH, ABORTION, IRISH SOCIETY addressed will say much about the future of the Church in Ireland. There are so many important questions facing us: for instance, the alienation of many Catholics from the institutional Church and the phenomenon of nominally practising Catholics whom we, the pastors, have neglected to help appreciate the life, liturgy and doctrine of their Church. In the last analysis it is towards issues like these that the bulk of our energies should be directed. We might surprise ourselves by the extent to which a greater concentration on such questions might help the Church to make a positive contribution to any debate on abortion.</page></plain_text>
