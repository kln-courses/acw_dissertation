<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHEELS and MAN BY STEPHAN F. de BORHEGYI One of maris most important inventions , one that dramatically altered his way of life, was the abstraction of the idea of rotary motion and its subsequent use in the wheel. Man has been mak- ing tools for some 500,000 years, but his use of wheels, pulleys and wheeled vehicles is barely 6,000 years old. Rotary motion in the form we know it in machines and vehicles is therefore a comparatively recent addition to maris equipment. Although the development of such machines, as in the case of any other human tool, has been cumulative and progressive, rotary motion was probably discovered independently by many human societies living in far different parts of the globe. Once a society was able to conceptualize a circle, it was on the road to discovering the principle of rotary motion and its many applications, such as the spinning wheel, the spindle whorl, the fire drill, the rotary quern, the pulley, the potter's wheel and the vehicular wheel. The vehicular wheel, which revolutionized trans- portation, is basically a disc equipped with bearings to allow it to spin freely. The manufacture of a disc requires in itself the performance of another rotary motion, namely tracing a circle. Tracing a true circle can be accurately executed only with an appropriate instrument. A length of string, one end of which is fixed, or by a forked stick or bone, one prong of which is rotated on the other as a fixed point can serve as such an instrument. As a matter of fact, the wish- bone of a bird may well have been the first, acci- dentally discovered "compass," which many used successfully to draw a perfect circle in the sand. Once the concept of a free-spinning disc was developed, the next step toward the invention of the wheel and its application to vehicular transport was logical. The earliest known vehicular wheels were probably made of horizontal cross-sections of fallen tree logs. In the Near East the use of solid spokeless wooden wheels most probably coincided with the domestica- tion of draft animals: the oxen, the mule and the horse. The first wheeled vehicles were clumsily built four-wheeled wagons or two-wheeled carts. Each wheel consisted of three wooden discs, held together by wooden, copper or bronze clamps. The existence of such disc- wheeled vehicles is known to us primarily through pictographic symbols and miniature terracotta replicas. Such replicas, employed probably in magico- religious contexts, are first found in Mesopotamian tombs and burials and would indicate that massive wheeled wagons and carts were used as early as 3250 b.c. by the Sumerians, and were soon followed and imitated by other cultures between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, on the Indus River and in Anatolia. Then their use gradually diffused into North Africa and through the Caucasus to Europe, the Middle Danube area, and to northern and western Europe. By 1500 b.c. wheeled vehicles were used as far east as China. Meanwhile, by 3000 b.c., lighter and fast-moving two-wheeled mule and horse drawn chariots made their appearance in Mesopotamia, Anatolia and Egypt. They changed the military history of the Middle East, spurring nations to conquer foreign lands and estab- 18</page><page sequence="2">Creamish white, terracotta chariot with solid wheels.

The first spoked wheels appeared around 2000 b.c. in Mesopotamia, and then in Egypt. By 1000 b.c. they were universally in use around the shores of the entire eastern Mediterranean. Meanwhile, the earlier wooden wheels and wooden chariots were rapidly being replaced by more durable ones plated with or made entirely out of metal, first of bronze, and later on of iron. And so the wheel was rolling on its way to revolutionary success all over the Old World. The ultimate success of equipping wheels with com- fortably bouncing rubber tires or tubes was not pos- sible until after the sixteenth century, when the dis- covery of the New World brought inventors of wheels and horse- and oxen-drawn vehicles face to face with the discoverers of solid and liquid rubber in Mexico. The natives of Mesoamerica were first stunned by the unfamiliar horses and vehicles. The Spaniards were awed by the Indians' bouncing rubber balls. The Indians soon took to the horses, mules and carts while the Spaniards began experimenting with rubber. And so, the rubber covered wheel came into use, to the mutual benefit of the Old and New World. Two-wheeled, terracotta country cart with reclining women.

Nor were any of the draft animals known to the people of the New World until they stood eye to eye with the mounted conquistadors of Spain. For this reason it is especially important to realize that small clay figurines and effigy whistles equipped with four wheels, represent- ing animals, were known and used in ancient Meso- america long before the arrival of the Spanish con- quistadors. As in ancient Mesopotamia, these four- wheeled miniature animals were found in tombs and burials at many archaeological sites in Mexico and El Salvador. Among the animals represented are the deer, jaguar, dog, alligator, spider monkey and small ro- dent. They are known since 1880 when the explorer- archaeologist, Désiré Charnay, dug some up at the site known as Tenenpango, on the slopes of the volcano Popocatepetl, just southeast of Mexico City. Since this first discovery several more wheeled figurines have been excavated at archaeological sites located in northern and central Veracruz on the Gulf Coast of Mexico (Panuco, Pavon, Tres Zapotes, Remojadas, Cerro de las Mesas, etc.) at the Mexican Highlands (Atzcapotzalco, Valley of Teotihuacan, Culhuacán, Santiago, Ahuixotla, Chalco, etc.), at Oaxaca, and on the west coast of Mexico (Lake Chapala, Cojumatlán, Tepachtitlán, Guerrero, Iguala, Nayarít), and also at the Lempa River, in eastern El Salvador. Of these, the Salvadorean pieces seem to be the oldest (dating possibly to the end of the Late Pre-Classic period, around 200 B.c. to A.D. 200), while the rest of the known wheeled zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures and whistles from Mexico are the products of Classic times (a.D. 200 to A.D. 900) . Precolumbian wheeled figurines are still consid- ered rarities and collectors' items. The Milwaukee Public Museum is fortunate enough to possess several miniature disc-shaped wheels from the Valley of Mexico (catalog numbers 14323 to 14325 and 52910 a and b) and three complete miniature Classic period four-wheeled effigy whistles from central Veracruz, on the Gulf Coast of Mexico. One whistle represents a jaguar; the other two represent a deer and a spider monkey. All three were donated to the Museum in 1968 by the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company of Milwaukee, to enhance the Museum's exhibit on " Inventions." Toys usually mirror the world of grown-ups. How- ever, although the people of Mexico had miniature vehicles, they were apparently still far from having full-sized wheeled vehicles. Except for the Incas of South America, who had admirable roads and high- way systems for pedestrians and their domesticated beasts of burden, the llama and alpaca, the rest of the native population of the Americas had neither paved 23</page><page sequence="7">Two hollow, terracotta roller seals, from Tlatilco, Mexico; Pre-Classic Period, 500 b.c.

To be sure, the dog was used by some of the Plains Indians to pull loads and "travois," and the Maya Indians did build some paved roads (sacbê). The latter were most likely used only for ceremonial processions and for the convenience of pilgrims flocking to the ceremonial centers for pre- scribed celebrations. Therefore, the general lack of good roads and animals for transportation may be the reason why the prehistoric inhabitants of the New World never developed wheeled vehicles. That they knew the basic principles of rotary motion is clear, not only from the miniature wheeled animals, but, as in the Old World, from numerous other archaeologi- cal objects of clay or stone which involved some form of rotary motion. The many circular spindle whorls ( malacates), hollow roller seals, jointed limb figurines, pump and bow drills, just to mention a few, are all mute testimonies to the inventive and mechanical genius of Precolumbian man. While he unquestionably knew how to put rotary motion and wheels to other uses, he never had de- veloped a need for wheeled vehicles. Perhaps heavy stone blocks or objects could more easily be trans- ported with the aid of log rollers than carts. Lacking pack animals, human porters wearing tumplines and/or specially designed wooden carrying boards such as the cacaxtê had free use of both of their hands so they could cut the jungle growth on their path or climb narrow and winding mountain trails where no carts could be used. So when the "toy" wheel was invented in Mesoamerica around 100 b.c., there was no need for it to be used for transportation. The four-wheeled miniature animal figures and effigy whistles here de- scribed were perhaps used by their makers not as movable toys but for some now obscure religious cere- monies, probably in connection with the rotation of the sacred calendar or with the movement of celestial deities. They were never developed for vehicular trans- 24</page><page sequence="8">Highland Guatema- lan Indian merchant carrying a heavy load, with the aid of the tumpline and wooden carrying board (cacaxtê).

But the Mesoamerican wheeled "toys" whatever they were used for will forever attest the historical and sociologi- cal facts that any human society is capable of discover- ing independently the basic mechanical principles un- derlying technical progress. Whether such principles will be developed and applied to practical or cere- monial uses depends entirely on the timeliness, the practicability and the orientation and needs of the cul- ture which made their initial discovery.
