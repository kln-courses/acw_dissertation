If no exact equivalent for the Hebrew existed, we can frequently trace a semantic development in Greek and discern what was in the mind of the translator as he rendered his Vorlage into Greek. In this connexion should be considered mLaxet6 o[0E , which in Classical Greek has the same sense as £taxox0·r , (a) 'look upon', 'inspect', 'observe', 'regard' ; (b) 'visit' ; (c) 'review' ; (d) 'consider', 're- flect'. By far the greatest number of examples of this verb occurs as a rendering of pdqad, and it may be well first to dispose of the other Hebrew verbs which are rendered by emaxtxo0aL. vna, 'examine', 'try', 'prove', 'test.' An example of this is found in Mal. iii 10, ubehdnzni na' bdao't (and try me in this) : etuaxa4xaOe 8] Ev Tro6Uo. Apparently the LXX left out the pronominal suffix of the first person to avoid the idea of trying or tempting God: "Now make a test in this." The semantic development of the Greek verb 'look upon', 'examine', 'test' makes it possible to serve as a rendering of bdhan. ati_, Qal, 'seek', 'consult', 'require', 'demand'. 2 Chr. xxiv 6 maddsza' lo'-darastd 'al-halewiyfm lehdbP (why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in?) : Ai&amp; Tc oux teneaxz+o nepl T'V v A£U£LTzV TO~U L£aevyxoi. In this case the Greek rendering can be explained by this development: 'look upon', 'look to', 'look upon (with demand)' 'require.' In the light of 2 Chr. xxxi 9, where darasis rendered XtuvOMVsTro, in the verse under consideration x's7ctX4o does not refer to applying for information,</page><page sequence="2">H. S. GEHMAN The verb ddras moreover occurs in 1 Chr. xxvi 31, nidrds7 (they, i.e., the Hebronites, were sought for): 's raxTaoav. Through a semantic development 'look upon', 'look for', 'search for', the Greek verb adequately reproduces the Hebrew sense. ;1n, 'see', 'look at', 'look after'. Sir. vii 22, behemdh lekd re'jh 'ene(y)kd (if thou hast a beast, look after it thyself): xTvy aoi at LV; C7LtXCtTOU 'urt. In this case the Greek etymological or literal sense well represents the Hebrew. tity, 'rejoice', 'exult'. There is an example of this verb in Jer. xxxii (xxxix) 41, wesastf 'dle_y)hem leh.tib 'otdm (yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good). Here the LXX has a free translation: xal cLaxCao[iaL TOro a&amp;yeoaoi0 auL rTOu. In this instance the LXX does not attempt to reproduce the sense of the Hebrew, and the extent of the meaning of the verb is 'look upon', 'observe', 'make it a point.' We may wonder, however, whether the translator by his rendering wished to avoid an anthropomorphism. an, Piel, 'comfort', 'console'. One example of this occurs in Job. ii 11, Idnfd-lo' g ilenahdmo (to bemoan and to comfort him). In the LXX this is rendered T0o rocpcxaXoa xoa mtLaxr0ClaOca uTO6v. The most that can be said is that in this verse the LXX has a free rendering and does not attempt to make a literal translation. rln, 'seek out', 'spy out', 'explore'. A reference to this verb may be made in the translation of Num. xiv 34, bemispar hayydmim 'dser-tartem 'et-ha'dres. In Bab the rendering reads: xorz&amp; tbv &amp;apLOb6v TCov jspxev 06aog 7xexoc60ae (instead of xTccr aocr0e£) T'v yiv. In this passage the Greek may be understood: "You have looked the land over, i.e., examined it", and thus the sense of the original is reproduced. 1j3 'inquire', 'seek', 'investigate carefully', 'consider'. Lev. xiii 36, loJ-yebaqqer hakkohen lasse'dr ha.s.sdhb (the priest need not seek for the yellow hair): oiux mlax-Tvo t 6 iepeu 7cep -rp TpXi¢oSr T ccvOaS. The Greek verb adequately represents the Hebrew in this semantic development: 'look upon', 'look carefully', 'in- spect', 'look for'. In Num. xvi 5, boqer weyoda' YHWH (in the morning YHWH will show) the translator read boqer as a verb and accordingly rendered: st7cxs'TocT xa yvco 6 06sq. 198</page><page sequence="3">199 Again the Greek shows the same range of meaning as in the previous example.-Ezek. xxxiv 11, zbiqqartim (and I will seek them out): xcl am,ox4ola au-ra. In this connexion the sheep are Israel, and the Greek expresses the Hebrew sense: 'look upon', 'look carefully', 'search for', 'seek out'. In the following verse (12), in a similar usage, the A-group and Lucian read aTrLxeTrreTLx instead of -qre. In Ps. xxvii (xxvi) 4, ulebaqqer behekalo is usually interpreted "to inquire in His Temple." In the LXX this is rendered: xol sraxsTTcraOL t0'r O vav aUTOU, which may signify: "to look upon His Temple (in meditation)." In this case the translation is as difficult to understand as the original, and the Greek may represent this interpretation: 'look upon', 'contemplate in meditation.' In Aramaic, beqar in the Pa'al (yebaqqar) is found in Ezra iv 15; this verb probably should be emended to the plural, or perhaps to the Ithpaal, so that the sentence means: "that search may be made in the book"; this is rendered: 'va sTersax4TarL £v [ LX[(. In this instance we have the semantic development: 'look upon', 'look into', 'investigate', 'search', 'make search.' In v. 19 of the same chapter zbaqqarz (and they made search) is rendered in the first person plural: xal eCreaxsisOx0 with the same connotation. In Ezra vi 1, zbaqqarz (and they made search, i.e., and search was made) is rendered: xcxl shrsaxecTro. With a similar interpretation Ezra vii 14, lebaqqara' is translated £k7ax+ma60ol. There is one occurrence of the Ithpaal, Ezra v 17, where yitbaqqar is interpreted by e',axsTrrco. In all these cases the Greek verb reproduces the Hebrew or Aramaic sense in this semantic development: 'look upon', 'look into', 'investigate' or 'make search'. A comparison of these passages of Ezra with the corresponding ones in 1 Esdras shows a similar use of the Greek verb in the latter: Ezra iv 15, 19 and 1 Esdras ii 18 (21), 22 (26); Ezra v 17 and 1 Esdras vi 20 (21); Ezra vi 1 and 1 Esdras vi 22 (23); Ezra vii 14 and 1 Esdras viii 12 (13). By far the largest number of occurrences of islrx6TopiL is found in the renderings of pdqad, which has a wide range of meanings, all of which can be reduced to an original common denominator: 'to attend with care' (E. A. SPEISER, BASOR 149, 21). This root has a comprehensive representation in other Semitic languages, where it shows as extensive diversity of nuances as in Hebrew. The verb pdqad is widely used in the sense of 'number', 'record', 'ETIIIKEIIOMAI</page><page sequence="4">H. S. GEHMAN 'enroll', and Greek xlaoxtcoaOC reproduces the Hebrew meaning. In the sense of 'number' it may refer to the census of the congre- gation: Ex. xxxviii 25 (xxxix 2); in xxxviii 26 (xxxix 3), however, the LXX has the noun i7aoxzse+. This verb moreover is used in connexion with a census of the first-born of Israel (Num. iii 40, 42). The verb also refers to a census made for the division of the land: Num. xxvi 54, 63, 64 (bis). It furthermore denotes a census taken for performing religious services: Num. iii 15(bis), 16, 39; iv 23, 29, 30, 34, 37, 38, 41, 42, 45, 46, 48, 49(bis). This verb in the sense of 'number', 'enroll', or 'record' is employed, however, most frequently in a census for military purposes : Num. i 3, 19, 44, 47; ii 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 24, 26, 28, 30; 1 Sam. xiii 15; xiv 17(bis); xv 4; 2 Sam. xxiv 2, 4. From this military usage the transition to 'muster' was very simple: Josh. viii 10; Judg. xx 15 (bis), 17; xxi 9; 1 Sam. xi 8; 2 Sam. xviii 1; 1 Kings xx (xxi) 15 (bis), 26, 27; 2 Kings iii 6. In this category should also be placed Sir. xlvi 14 (Hebrew text of H. L. STRACK, 1903; I. LEVI, 1904; R. SMEND, 1906): "And He mustered the tents of Jacob." Pdqad may also signify 'visit' in the sense of making a social call. Thus Samson visited his wife (Judg. xv 1): ineaox6+ao Sap+y v T v yuvocxa oCiUo5. In this connexion should be considered Sir. vii 35, of which the Hebrew is not extant: '[L 6xvet mrtxzKneaorl appcoxTov (do not hesitate to visit a sick man). Closely related to this is the use of this verb with les,lom, 'to visit for peace', i.e., 'to bring greetings'; of this there is an example in the Hexaplaric addition 1 Sam. xvii 18, xocl Toi &amp;3aeXypo6u ou rclx ei £l pv7v. Pdqad, even though it may be rendered 'visit' in a general sense, also means 'remember', 'remember kindly', 'bear in mind favorably', 'take notice of'. Examples of this occur in God's relation to an individual. Thus God visits Sarah (Gen. xxi 1); Hannah (1 Sam. ii 21); Jeremiah (Jer. xv 15). The Psalmist in his prayer is not deserted by God, who inspects him at night (Ps. xvii [xvi] 3): pdqadtd layelh: x£6Xec+&amp; vuxTO6 (thou hast visited by night). Another example of God's visiting (pdqad) is found in Sir. xxxii (xxxv) 21: "he (the lowly) will not cease (in his prayer) until the Most High does visit (erCroxa4qtox)." In contradistinction to MT (Ps. cvi [cv] 4) in the LXX the Psalmist prays that God may visit his people with salvation. Most frequently, it should be noted, this usage refers to God visiting His people: Gen. 1 24-25; Ex. iii 16; iv 31; xiii 19; Ruth i 6; Jer. xxix (xxxvi) 10, his people 200</page><page sequence="5">'EIIISKEIIOMAI in exile; Zeph. ii 7, the remnant of the house of Judah; Zech. x 3, His flock, the house of Judah; Ps. lxxx (lxxix) 15, a vine, i.e., His people; Ps. lxv (lxiv) 10, God also visits the earth. In Zech. xi 16 it is not certain what is meant by lo'-yipgod; the verb has been interpreted as 'visit', 'think of', 'care for', 'miss', and the Greek ou [L7 arlmx4qrcxT is equally ambiguous. Closely allied to this usage of pdqad is the meaning 'visit' in the sense of 'care for' (Ps. viii 5); u uS6O &amp;vOpt)rcou or Mrncx. uctro6v; (or the son of man that thou visitest him?). In reference to the unfaithful shepherds who neglected God's flock, i.e., His people, the prophet writes (Jer. xxiii 2) : welo' peqadtem 'otdm (and you have not visited them); the LXX renders literally: xcxl oux neGxr£4cxaOe curoc. In this instance the verb pdqad without a negative would have a favorable sense, but when the Hebrew in the second part of the verse employs pdqad with an inauspicious signification the LXX avoids repetition and chooses ex8x&amp;o instead. According to Sir. xlix 15 (18) the bones of Joseph received a providential visitation in being transported from Egypt to Palestine: xcal tr&amp; 6ocr crToi6 The verb pdqad (visit), however, may also have an unfavorable connotation, which conveys the concept of divine punishment. The divine visitation may happen to be general without reference to specific individuals or people (Job xxxv 15) : ki-'ayinpdqad 'appo. This is rendered into Greek in the same word order: OrL oux 'a-rv £7LGXt7'r6£voo opy¥]v oc uTou. It may occasionally refer to punishment upon individuals: Is. x 12, the king of Assyria; here the Lucianic text has £7rlx£4o+oia in agreement with MT, but some in the group read £rxmaxlx£Ta instead of LXX £7ir£L. In Jer. xxix (xxxvi) 32 God will visit (punish) the false prophet Shemaiah: £raLox£4o[cxL d lcapcx[av. God will visit upon Jehoiakim, his offspring, and his servants their iniquity (Jer. xxxvi [xliii] 31): xcdl iLarc.xoaL 5in' auo'v x.T.X. God will visit (punish) the unfaithful descendants of David on account of their transgressions (Ps. lxxxix [lxxxviii] 33: £rLxitXo[axL. In Sir. ii 14 the Greek employs the verb 'visit' in an ominous sense: xocl T-rL noar oa0t rcXv x toxrT 6 K6upLo; He will also visit (punish) His own people: Jer. v 9, 29; ix 8 (9); xliv (li) 13, 29. The same verbs are also employed in God's punishment of the men of Anathoth (Jer. xi 22); God will also visit (punish) all the nations (Ps. lix [lviii] 6); Judah will furthermore be included among the nations visited by God (Jer. ix 24 [25]) as well as those 201</page><page sequence="6">H. S. GEHMAN that will not submit to Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. xxvii [xxxiv] 8 [6]). God will visit the oppressors of His people (Jer. xxx [xxxvii] 20); Edom is especially mentioned in connexion with the visitation by God (Jer. xlix [xxix] 8 [9] ; Lam. iv 22). In the lament for the calamities brought about by the sins of Jerusalem the prophet says (Jer. xiii 21): mah-to'meri ki-yipqjd 'alayik (What wilt thou say when He shall visit, i.e., punish thee .. .; cf. AV, RVmg 1)). There are serious difficulties in the interpretation of this passage, but the LXX renders it: -r ep eZ 6trv axxXxTcovtc a£; (what wilt thou say when they visit, i.e., punish, thee?). In its interpretation the LXX, in using the plural verb, indicates that God will use the supposed friends of Judah to carry out the divine punishment. In all these cases £7Utax7ro{at translates pdqad with the same sense in view. In Ex. xxxii 34 the infinitive of pdqad with the first person pronoun suffix referring to God clearly has an ominous sense and bears the general meaning of 'visit.' In this case poqdi is rendered cLxrx-tzoocL. In the main clause, however, upaqadti 'ale(y)hem hattad'td (I will visit their sins upon them), the LXX, in avoiding a repetition of the verb tcmaxrTco£[L, employs a synonym, sTc&amp;o. A further development of the meaning of pdqad is 'appoint', 'assign', 'make responsible'. Examples of this are: Num. iv 27, ipeqadtem adlehem (and you shall appoint, or assign, their charge unto them): xcx strLaxt C auctrou6 (thou shalt make them responsible). -Num. iv 32, ubesm t tipqedu 'et-keli mismeret massi'dm (and by name you shall appoint, or assign, the objects of the charge of their burden). In this case imrcaxcxaoe reproduces the sense of the Hebrew verb.-When Moses asked YHWH to appoint his successor (Num. xxvii 16) he said: yipqod YHWH... 'I. 'al-hd'eddh (let YHWH appoint a man over the congregation); in this case 'Erm- axsd&amp;a0co has the same sense as the Hebrew verb. According to Neh. vii 1, gatekeepers, singers, and Levites were appointed; here wayyippdqedZ is rendered xal £ax£X£nyav with the same significa- tion. In his proclamation Cyrus (Ezra i 2) says: wehz'-pdqad cdlay (and He has charged me), which is rendered: xxl cxUgS4 es7Ceax&amp;4cro in' £~£. In Neh. xii 42 happdqid (the overseer) is rendered srcaxxsCaaV 1) Abbreviations of English Versions of the OT quoted in the article: AV Authorized or King James Version, 1611 RV Revised Version, 1885 JV Jewish Version, 1917 RSV Revised Standard Version, 1952 202</page><page sequence="7">203 with the nuance that the singers were organized, or placed in charge, under an overseer. The basic sense of pdqad-stCLx&amp;sTcotaL is illustrated in the grim incident (2 Kings ix 34), where Jehu gives orders concerning Jezebel: piqedzi-na' 'et-ha'drirdh hazZo't (now look after, or attend to, this cursed woman); here the Hebrew meaning is brought out in the rendering: 'ECLaxt a6o &amp;£ 0 T8 V xa7paj£v"V TauT7v. From the basic idea underlying the meaning of pdqad, 'attend with care' can be derived the sense of 'to miss', 'to be missing', 'to be lacking', 'to be empty'. In this connexion staoxsTxoai is used to render pdqad with the same connotation. Thus, if one looks intently for a person or thing and cannot see or find the object of his search, it is lacking or missing, and the place under scrutiny may be vacant or empty. There are examples of this usage in the Qal: 1 Sam. xx 6, 'im-pdqo&amp;dyipqedeni 'dbikd (if thy father miss me at all) : siv sTixlas6- [LVO4 £7trX£7Ct j£ 6 7raTlp Cou. In this case the Greek has the same sense as the Hebrew. In referring to the ark of the covenant, the prophet says (Jer. iii 16): welo' yipqodu (neither shall they miss it). The LXX, however, interpreted the verb as a Niphal in the singular: ou8s mLaxcpOeayOc, a reading which can be explained palaeographically. The occurrences of pdqad in the Niphal in this sense. however, are more frequent: Judg. xxi 3, lehippdqed ... sebet 'ehdd (that there should be lacking... one tribe): -To £xTL- axe7xcva... cpuXv tiFxcv ;-1 Sam. xx 18, wenipqadtd ki yippdqed mosabekd (and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty): xal £CTnX£e7r CTy OTL £aTeCX£TCg TLMG xaO3poa aou. In this case the LXX presents a literal rendering of the Hebrew. In the following verse (19) instead of tered the LXX apparently read tipqod for the Niphal ofpdqad, as is illustrated by £7xtlX£6 ; this represents a better Hebrew original and is adopted by RSV.-2 Sam. ii 30, wayyippdqedz (and were lacking): xcl ZCaxesTCJGav.-2 Kings x19, ')s 'al-yippaqed (let none be wanting, or missing): avw3p p) eCtaxer-qJTCO. It was noted above in 1 Sam. xx 18 that the two occurrences of the verbs pdqad and srtLaxntrotL had the distinctions of sense: 'to be missed' and 'to be empty'. In 1 Sam. xx 25, 27 David's place was empty: wayyippdqe_d meqom Ddwid: xal LCTxxCY 6 06TC0 0 T0 o AueasI. In all these instances iimaxsnoLoaL is to be interpreted with the same nuance as pdqad. At this point should be considered Ezek. xxiii 21 : wattipqedi et Zimmat ne'zrayik (and thou didst miss the lewdness of thy youth): 'EIIISKEIIOMAI</page><page sequence="8">H. S. GEHMAN xoal er6execo Tr v &amp;ivotdmav veo60t4 ou. From the sense of 'miss' can be derived the various translations: "Thus thou calledst to remembrance", AV RV; "thus thou didst call to remembrance", JV; "thus you longed for", RSV. A study of the verb eitax6&amp;eTcopL as an equivalent of pdqad leads to a consideration of the noun ctiCX£t¢S, which in Classical Greek signifies 'inspection', 'visitation', 'investigation', 'inquiry'. This usage is found in books of which we do not have a Hebrew text. In 2 Mac. iii 14 ; v 18 staoxL4tq denotes an investigation or inspection of the Temple treasury. It may also refer to a consideration or examination of the terms for a truce (2 Mac. xiv 20). This noun may furthermore include an inquiry or investigation concerning transgressions against the law (3 Mac. vii 12). It is also important to observe that the noun snctaXe¢L has followed the same trend of meaning as the root pdqad. As a translation of the plural of the passive participle Qal of pdqad the LXX employs the singular £TCrox£t&amp; in the sense of 'enumeration', 'enrollment', or 'census'. This interpretation is very frequent: Num. i 21 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45; ii 32(bis); iii 22 (bis), 34, 39, 43; iv 36, 37, 40, 41, 44, 45; xxvi 7, 14, 18(A), 21, 23, 27, 31, 38, 41, 45, 50, 51, 62, 63; 1 Chr. xxiii 24. In translating the noun pequdddh (reckoning) the LXX represents the same meaning (1 Chr. xxiii 11): e¢s ictoxteLv piav (in one reckoning). In this connexion it should be observed that in inter- preting mipqqd (numbering) the translators applied the Hebrew sense to irntaxe+t (2 Sam. xxiv 9; 1 Chr. xxi 5). As in the case of the verb pdqad, the noun pequdddh occurs with the nuance of 'visitation' in a pejorative sense. Thus it may refer to death, which is the common fate of all mankind (Num. xvi 29): pequddat kol-hda'ddm yippdqed 'dle(y)hem (and be visited after the visitation of all men); in Greek staoxt¢LS likewise signifies 'visita- tion': dt xat xCT' 7rt aX%OCtV CrVT6COV V OPCn07(OV £7ta7X07rC £a7TaC aUZTV. The use of em£Cbxt£¢ (visitation) with the nuance of divine 'punish- ment' occurs in the following examples in Jeremiah: xi 23 ; xxiii 12; xlviii (xxxi) 44; li (xxviii) 18. The noun pequddah, however, also bears the meaning of 'over- sight', 'charge', 'responsibility'. In the instance of the 'appointed charge' of the sons of Merari it is called (Num. iii 36) pequddat mismeret which is rendered in Greek: y rxnt c¢ls 0 cpuXacx'. In describing the allocation of the sons of Aaron to their service in 204</page><page sequence="9">205 the Temple, the Chronicler writes (1 Chr. xxiv 3): lipequdddtdm (according to their appointed duty, or responsibility): xcar&amp; vTV e7crxe4Lv ac&amp;o&amp;v. A similar interpretation is found in verse 19: 'elleh pequdddtdm : aSr] T] eLacrxeL aucTov. The sense of 'responsi- bility' is closely related to that of 'oversight' in the administration of David's kingdom, as may be observed in 1 Chr. xxvi 30: 'al pequddat Yisrda'l (concerning the oversight of Israel), which is rendered literally with the same signification: riL T71q 5rcLGX4e(O TOV 'IcpoAX. The noun 7riaxorosq in its etymological sense well expresses the meaning of the Qal passive participle of the Kethib, happe- qidim *), 2 Kings xii 12(11) : 'those put in charge', i.e., 'the over- seers': Tr epya c ov emxoC6ov o'Lxou Kuplou. In 2 Chr. xxxiv 12, 17 the plural participle of the Hophal with the same connotation is similarly rendered sCrdxoroL. In this connexion should be considered the occurrence of ectaxonrc in two passages. In Ps. cix (cviii) 8 the sense of pequdddh in the context is uncertain, but the line may be rendered: "Let another take his charge, or office"; the Greek may be similarly interpreted: xal T eV crtaxontv auToi X?aoit e&amp;epO4. In 3 Mac. v 42 erLaxor I may be noted with this development: 'oversight', 'care', 'attention', 'protection'. At this point may be considered rtaGxorn in the same order of semantic development as was followed in the treatment of the verbs pdqad and e7cLxeTCoPL. In Ex. xxx 12 ectaxoMrc, 1° renders the Qal passive participle plural and in the second instance it stands for the Qal infinitive of pdqad. The singular s7rCxo7rC likewise repre- sents the Qal passive participle plural of pdqad in Num. i 21 (B); vii 2; xiv 29; xxvi 18 (22), 47 (43); in all these occurrences el- axornc signifies 'census', 'numbering', or 'enrollment'. The noun ercaxon I moreover may refer to a divine visitation in a favorable sense as of 'taking notice' or 'remembering kindly'. It occurs in the dative as a translation of the Qal infinitive absolute of pdqad in Gen. 1 24; Ex. iii 16; xiii 19. In Gen. 1 25 the infinitive absolute is rendered ev Tx emLcxoQ7t. An ameliorative connotation also is observed in Job x 12, where pequdddh is interpreted in the sense of 'care', 'kind attention'. In Job xxxi 14, however, God visits Job not with providential care, but to prove him: weki- yipqod: a v 8a xl r7Laxo7orIv, where the accusative is the object of *) The Kere, however, has the Hophal: hammupqadim. 'EIIIKEIIOMAI</page><page sequence="10">H. S. GEHMAN 7COLTOCI (B), QOLnrYTCa (K) understood, and the sentence is to be rendered: "when He visits, or makes inquiry". In this case the visitation cannot be limited to a favorable or an unfavorable sense. In Jer. vi 15 be'et-peqadtim, the expression is rendered ev xciLpc e7rLxo=n7 acru c&amp;v, where 'visitation' bears an ominous meaning. In Num. xvi 29 in a reference to divine visitation the Niphal of pdqad is rendered sTCCxortC eGcrT; here the noun is to be understood in a pejorative meaning. A similar translation of the Niphal occurs in Is. xxiv 22, where ercLxor7 (visitation) connotes punishment; likewise in Is. xxix 6 TCrCxont refers to the visitation of YHWH with an ominous sense. As a rendering of pequdddh (visitation) in a day of calamity eMcLxoQn (Is. x 3) likewise bears an ominous signification. Further- more in Jer. x 15; xi 23 the nounpequdddh is used in an unfavorable sense of divine visitation; in the former passage ev xaLpco emaxor7S ocutov and in the latter ev Ev.auTww eSCLX0oT7 aurcov (Bab(vid)mg Lucian) such an interpretation is obvious. Sir. xvi 18 speaks of the majesty of God and in this connexion alludes to God's 'visiting' the heavens, the earth, and the deep (bepoqdo). Here the Greek reads ev xT T7CICXOr=C CUTO, and the Greek noun which stands for the Hebrew infinitive may be interpreted 'visitation', 'contempla- tion', 'reviewing'. In this connexion should be considered the sense of the verb ecLxeTopLaL in Sir. xvii 32, auVpCLLv io4ouq opacvov aucrcS 71.X77rre'TC.L (He himself looks upon the host of the height of heaven). In this instance the verb could well be understood as 'contemplates' or 'reviews'. Finally should be considered 71acxo7wn in a propitious sense: Sir. xviii 20, £v cpa TCCGxog~S £upCa£6S CiXacapov (in the hour of visitation thou shalt find forgiveness).-Wis. ii 20, acrTaL yap aOcTOi e7Claxor7c x Xo6yov ac&amp;To5 (for he will be visited according to his words; i.e., "for, according to what he says, he will be protected", RSV).-iii 9 (NA), xa.l C Laxoq qv To e ,XXTOXLe (O6iOL4, A) auTou : "and (His) visitation will be upon His chosen (holy) ones."- iii 13, e xocpl 6 ap v e 7MCFxo07C duXcov: "(the barren one) shall have fruit at (His) visitation of souls." On the other hand, mTcLxornc has also to be noted with an unfavorable connotation. In writing about the unfaithful wife, Sirach (xxiii 24) observes that there will be rCLaxo07C (visitation) upon her children. To return to the Wisdom of Solomon, the writer (Wis. xiv 11), in connexion with idols gives erCLcxontY an unfavorable sense: 'v eS&amp;cXoQ O&amp;vcov 206</page><page sequence="11">'EIIISKEIOMAI ercLxo0n7 Cacrat. In a reference to the men of Sodom in the same book (Wis. xix 15) their punishment will be lighter than that of the Egyptians; nevertheless the word ercaxo0rc is employed in an unfavorable signification: &amp;XX' q TLg e7McLxo0c77 ecaTL aVcTOv. In a discussion of divination, soothsayings, and dreams by Sirach (xxxi [xxxiv] 6) erCmxor0C can be considered in a neutral sense: eav t) Ycapa ' Y'+iTOQu Ocxo7aXO v eL[xo7 ": "if they be not sent from the Most High in a visitation (or, as a visitation)." This investigation shows that mcLxecozioL and its related nouns reflect a semantic development that is an exact parallel to what took place in pdqad and some other roots. It is obvious that a non- Jewish Greek reader would have met serious difficulties in under- standing certain passages. The Jew, however, who had no knowl- edge of Hebrew or Aramaic may have comprehended many passages of Hebraic Greek through his acquaintance with traditional inter- pretation and the language of the synagogue. Yet it has to be ad- mitted that he would have had numerous difficulties in grasping the exact meaning. Moreover the Hellenic Jew, who still had some knowledge of the original languages of the Old Testament without being able to read them fluently may have preferred to read the LXX by frequent reference to the original. Moreover the translators had a high respect for the original text of Scripture, and their aim was to reproduce the sense of the Hebrew and Aramaic. In conse- quence, in many instances they wrote a Hebraic Greek and imposed on certain words a Semitic coloring. Yet it cannot be maintained that they arbitrarily forced strange meanings into the Greek words. As this study shows, it was possible to preserve in the Greek vocab- ulary of the LXX a semantic development parallel to what took place in Hebrew. 207</page></plain_text>
