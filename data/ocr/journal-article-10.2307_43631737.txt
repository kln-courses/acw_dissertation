<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cynthia Davidson A Conversation with Elia Zenghelis Elia Zenghelis, architect of the seminal Hotel Sphinx project on Times Square and in 1975 a founding partner of the Office for Metropolitan Architecture, with Rem Koolhaas and the painters Madelon Yriesendorp and Zoe Zenghelis, is widely known today for his career in architectural education. In 2000 he received the Annie Spink Award for Excellence in Education from the Royal Institute of British Architects in recognition of his teaching, which began at the Architectural Association in London in 1963, and continues today, most recently as the Davenport Visiting Professor at the Yale School of Architecture in the fall of 201?. While stateside, the Greek- born British citizen, who now lives in Athens, discussed his life and work in four interviews, between November 1 and December 14, 2013, in New Haven and New York. The syn- thesis of these conversations that appears here is but the tip of an iceberg that one day, no doubt, will find its way to book form, if only as one of many early histories of OMA. But first, a bit more background. In his now nearly 50 years of teaching, Zenghelis has counseled hundreds upon hundreds of aspiring architecture students, including - to name only a few - Koolhaas and Zaha Hadid at the AA, Laurinda Spear at Columbia, Greg Lynn at Princeton, and Pier Vittorio Aureli at the Berlage Institute. At the AA he also brought in new teachers, including Leon Krier and Demetri Porphyrios, in these instances individuals whose particular ideology might seem at odds with Zenghelis's own interest in modernism and rational architecture, but whose presence introduced multiple points of view. Today even his "practice" is conducted with students in intensive, one- or two-week workshops, in which they work as a team, with Zenghelis as principal, to produce an architectural project. When Greek projects came to OMA, Zenghelis opened an Athens office, but he left the firm in 1987 and then formed an architectural partnership with Eleni Gigantes (whom he would later marry). In 1989 he became Baukunst Professor at the Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf, then, simultaneously, a teacher at the Berlage Institute. His recollections of these years in ed- ucation and practice are the story of a career in architecture. 69</page><page sequence="2">CYNTHIA DAVIDSON: Elia, tell us about your childhood, and how you came to pur- sue architecture. ELIA ZENGHELIS: One catalytic factor was the environment I grew up in. I was a war child, born in Athens in 1937. From the age of three to the age of nine I lived in the tense atmosphere of the German occupation and then in the civil war that followed the with- drawal of the Germans in *44. We lived in an apartment that spanned the whole width of the block, so it had two views. One view was over the ex-Royal Gardens - the king was in exile in Egypt - and the other looked across the river Illissos - now covered over - to the district of Pangrati, which went up the slopes toward Mount Hymettus. During the civil war, the Royal Gardens were occupied by the British, who intended to impose the king, and Pangrati was held by the popular, mostly left-wing Greek army that had fought the Germans in the mountains during the occupation, and claimed the right to self-de- termination. This is an oversimplification - it was much more complex, but it is not too far from the truth. CD: You were living on the dividing line? EZ: Yes. Our apartment was in a row of apartment blocks that ended in two cross streets, one of which became a bridge over the river. Both streets had a good view of the Pangrati district. I remember very clearly the British tank that would pass below our windows on the garden side of the apart- ment until it reached one of the cross streets, where it would turn to face Pangrati and fire! Then it would turn back and slowly move past our windows until it reached the other cross street, and do the same. My heart would go wild with fear each time the tank's engine noise stopped, waiting for the blast. And there was continuous firing and explosions on the Illissos side. Buildings were being blown up at night. On the hill oppo- site our house was the beautiful all-marble Panathenian Stadium; but on that same hill the communists were storing their arsenal. These British Meteors - I think they were the first fighter jets - were diving right in front of our bedroom windows, firing at this arsenal. One day they hit it and all hell broke loose. All our windows - not only ours, but everybody's - flew in. Once, the communists blew up an apartment block on the other side of the river to make rubble for a roadblock. Obviously they were anticipating a British surge, because the next day a long column of tanks crossed the river, went up Pangrati and over the roadblock as if it were not there, and vanished into the distance - and then silence: the British had won. CD: Were you frightened? EZ: Naturally. I was a child. I still have a certain subconscious fear of that kind of noise. I'm terrified of thunderstorms; both the lightning and the thunderclap remind me of the din I lived with that winter. During thunderstorms, I try to hide in an interior space if I can. CD: How aware of the civil war politics were you as a child? EZ: As a child, there were the Greeks and the conquerors. I had a father who leaned toward the left and a grandfather who, for his own reasons, hated "the Bolsheviks," as he called them. You grow familiar with politics in Greece. More vivid for me was the physi- cal manifestation of the effects of politics and war: the horror of bodies floating in the river during rainstorms; the number of maimed ex-soldier beggars, the very real presence of poverty and the way it contrasted with what we had: an apartment, a living room, 70 Log 30</page><page sequence="3">Elia Zenghelis, 20«.

All this marks a susceptible seven-year-old. There was this contrast between the Royal Gardens, which were lush and green, and where the buildings were distinguished and well-kept, and the side that my bedroom window faced, which was a city of ruins. The most striking characteristic of Athens, and Greece in gen- eral at the time, was dust. The roads were not properly paved, so when the wind blew, dust covered the city like a translucent shroud. Such was my perception of what a City was. I hated that city. I loved the Royal Gardens, where we played cops and robbers, but architecture seemed to consist of a miserable pile of ruins. Athens was a very miserable looking place. CD: Were you an only child? EZ: I was an only child. Nobody was having children after the war broke out. My father was in banking. He had wanted to study ar- chitecture, and in fact was sent to Germany to study. But my grandfather, who was Greek consul at Marseille, became addicted to gam- bling. He had married a rich woman and he spent all of her money at the Monte Carlo Casino and went broke. My grandmother divorced him and he died shortly after that, relatively young. CD: How did the architecture student become a banker? EZ: He was recalled from Germany as there was no money to continue his studies. It was also the responsibility of the eldest boy to ensure that his sisters - he had two - were properly married. Rich banker relatives took him under their wing and he started work at the Bank of Athens, one of the major Greek banks at the time. He began as an errand boy, then was sent to the north of Greece to run a village branch, then to a bigger branch, and because he was a member of the family, grad- ually he became one of the directors. When he and my mother were splitting up after the war he was sent to South Africa to open a Bank of Athens branch in Johannesburg. He left Greece in 1947 while the civil war was still raging. There were a lot of Greek indus- trialists in South Africa and the bank did very well. In 194-8, when I was 11, 1 went on my first air trip to South Africa in a Dakota DC-3, one of those now fabled two-engine propeller planes, aviation's mules of endurance. But it took five days to get to Johannesburg because we had to stop to refuel every few hours. In those days the luxury of flying was unbelievable. Suddenly I was discovering a sort of sensuality in life: airplanes, limou- sines, luxury restaurants, hotels, the desert, the jungle, Kilimanjaro. When I arrived in Johannesburg it was night. My father picked me up from the airport with a big American car - a Studebaker, I remember - I thought it was a luxury taxi. When I realized it was his car I couldn't believe my eyes. CD: So Johannesburg was a real surprise. EZ: Superlative, divine. I was awestruck. You had to look up to see the skyscrapers, which were 20 to 30 stories tall. They were kind of grouped together, a little like a mini Manhattan, and the avenues and streets on a grid gave the city center an order that I found magnificent. The experience of looking up to confront a city that dwarfed me became, for me, the sine qua non of its idea: refuge, secu- rity, protection, comfort - my idea of civi- lization. I was entering adolescence, and my new awareness of the sensual materiality of the city went hand in hand with the growth of my own sexuality. In all this, Johannes- burg was the ultimate measure of beauty, the ideal. From that moment I became obsessed with cities, their illumination, their build- ings, their trees, their plans. 72 Log 30</page><page sequence="5">CD: How did this obsession manifest itself? EZ: I started drawing my own cities, awe- some cities that would outdo all others. And I started collecting pictures and postcards of New York. The skyscraper became, leťs say, the object of my "research," the model par excellence for the city's architecture. But also the park. The lushness of grass was a new delight for me. And trees, because during the war the Germans had destroyed 75 percent of the Greek forests. CD: Tell me about the city plans you drew as a boy. EZ: I started drawing them when I was in Johannesburg. I made a plan of a city in be- tween lakes and rivers, with parks and huge deciduous trees. I had not been to France, but my parks were laid out in a grand, French- garden style. But my most enduring obsession became my postcard collection of grand 19th- century hotels along the Italian and Swiss lakes. This grew into an intense interest in the hotel and its possible derivatives as an ur- ban typology. Having experienced the luxury, servicing, and lifestyle of hotels, the hotel became for me the city's urban archetype, the example par excellence of the way people should live. The common living rooms, col- lective meeting places, huge lounges, lobbies, and outdoor gardens became the magical equipment of my ideal city. CD: How did your interest in architecture come about? EZ: I was flirting with the idea of becoming an architect, but I was also good at sciences. I like mathematics. It is the art of abstrac- tion par excellence, where things that could only be described in very long, complicated ways are short-circuited and represented by symbols. Abstraction, this reduction to the essence, is also the essence of art. The ability to abstract is very important, and that's what mathematics teaches us. I was also painting a lot, and I even flirted with becoming a painter at one point. I was taking lessons in painting and I had developed my own technique in oil. I was doing lots of oils, and I really loved it. Later I decided it was all very second-rate, and I threw it all away. CD: So how did you come to apply to the Architectural Association? EZ: At first I thought I should study at Karslruhe, where Egon Eiermann taught, and which was very popular in Greece. But in Johannesburg I had started working for a Greek architect during my school holidays. He subscribed to Architectural Record. One issue reviewed all of the architectural schools in the United States, and also the AA - but no other schools in Europe. I was struck by the review of the AA. It was extremely positive, extolling its radical system of having prac- ticing architects and no tenured professors teaching, the power of the students in hiring and firing staff, the progressive courses that were solely based on projects, the absence of exams or a grading system, etc. The article also talked about the AA's rationally struc- tured syllabus and its renowned teachers, such as Peter Smithson, who was the designer of the syllabus at the time. CD: So what year did you formally enter the Architectural Association? EZ: In 1956, and I graduated in '61. In those days it was not compulsory to take a year out. CD: Who was your tutor when you entered? When did you encounter Arthur Korn? EZ: John Dennys was first-year master - a very inspiring person. I encountered Arthur 73 Log 10</page><page sequence="6">Korn straight away; he was involved in all the years. The first year was great fun, with a Bauhaus-influenced foundation course. You started with the legendary "primitive hut" - Laugier, etc. You were told you are on a desert island and you have to build yourself a hut with bamboo and thatch, as there were no other materials or tools. You were given three weeks to do it and to make a model. Then you had to design an observation platform by a lake - and progressively design more complex structures into which func- tions were inserted. In the second year you dealt with materials. Each term you had to design a building in a different material. In the fall it was timber, in winter it was brick, and in summer it was steel. In the third year you had an urban design project run by Korn, and then a reinforced-concrete building as a major, two-term project. It had to be designed in detail, with working drawings, right down to window and door schedules and every conceivable construction detail - plus you had to calculate the structure for the exams in structures. You had to be an engineer and a designer. The working drawings were a phenomenal task. I got bored with this project. In fourth year you went into a series of large-scale urban design projects, big build- ings. This was under John Killick, from Howell, Killick and Partridge, one of the bet- ter-known firms in London. And of course we were doing big housing projects like Robin Hood Gardens. In those days the London County Council was very active with a lot of good young architects who had come back from the war, people like Alan Colquhoun and Bob Maxwell. In the fifth year you had to construct your own thesis, write and design your own project. I became acquainted with Yeovil in Somerset, and I chose to design a civic center for Yeovil for my thesis. By then I had the reputation of be- ing a formalist. In those days to be called a formalist was a serious accusation. It was all right with Killick. Technically it was not sup- posed to go well with Smithson, but I man- aged - a cost analysis did the trick. He left halfway through the year and Bob Maxwell took over. A young Cypriot architect, Panos Koulermos, was one of the tutors in the fifth year, and we became friends. When I gradu- ated he took me to work at his office, Douglas Stephen and Partners, where Ken Frampton and Bob Maxwell were partners. CD: What kinds of projects did you work on at Douglas Stephen? EZ: A lot of housing projects, which Douglas gave me a free hand to design, though I later discovered these were on spec in case clients could be convinced to invest. So none of them were "for real." Douglas began to trust me a lot, but I paid dearly for that trust, because I was put in charge of the construction of a terrible building designed by a guy who was fired. I was asked to save the building when it was too late. But I learned a lot. CD: Was this also housing? EZ: No. It was a branch of the Ministry of Works - an office tower with a shopping mall at the bottom, on three levels, then a park- ing level, and then a tower on top of that. It had passed planning approval, so I could only make minor variations and stylistic changes in the materials and the details, alongside dealing with the clients and the local authori- ties. But I saw it to the end. It turned me into a "professional." I was angry with Douglas because he knew I wanted to be given a building from the beginning and have it built. So I did get frustrated. On the side, I kept doing my own projects. CD: For yourself? Or for clients? 74 Log 30</page><page sequence="7">EZ: Entirely for myself, and one or two com- petitions every now and then. I did a com- petition with some friends for a hospital in Kuala Lumpur. We did a very beautiful slab, but the current research on hospitals postu- lated that they should be single -story mat buildings. Ours was very vertical. At the of- fice I also did the competition for Amsterdam's City Hall, together with Adrian Gale and Ken Frampton. CD: Were you teaching at the AA while work- ing for Douglas? EZ: Yes. I started teaching almost two years after I finished because I had developed friendships with the students, who were only two years younger. I found that I liked it a lot. In 1 961 1 was taken on as a tutor in the second year. CD: Were you still doing the building materi- als program in second year? EZ: No, it had changed. I remember a very interesting program for a Benedictine mon- astery. The clockwork schedule for the daily life of the monks introduced a kind of proces- sional hierarchy that yielded a very clear sequence for the plan of the building. My sit- uation changed when the second-year master was caught driving with high alcohol content in his blood, just when the drink- and- drive legislation was first introduced, and im- prisoned. On his recommendation, I took over second year, in 1964. Meanwhile, the first year underwent radical changes under its new master, Tony Dugdale. The slightly anachronistic foundation course was replaced by a playful "fun" year, experimenting with demountables, inflatables, and other cunning inventions - "plastics," etc. Students then coming into the second year had forgot- ten whatever they knew about architecture before they entered the school. While teach- ing in the second year, I became obsessed with the first, which was given to me to run when Dugdale left. I took this very, very seriously. I was very young and inexperienced, and I don't know if I would do it the same way now, but I restructured the complete first- year syllabus from scratch. CD: What did you introduce for first year? EZ: My first year became a complete crash course on architecture and the city. It began with an exploration of the urban environ- ment through perception and ended with the design of an urban centrality. I also introduced a brief lecture series on history, because there was none. Especially a history of the 19th century, from the French Revolu- tion onward, following my conviction that there is a clear relationship between architec- ture, politics, and history, and in particular, revolutionary movements. The year was focused on London as a city. After the first "perception" exercise, we analyzed the Bedford Estate around the school and the sequence of Georgian squares. Then we studied the sequence from Regent's Park, through Portland Place and Oxford Circus, to Regent Street, Piccadilly, and the Haymarket, ending up in the Mall - the com- plete Nash sequence, into which we incorpo- rated a series of architectural interventions. I had a big class of 80 students and brilliant tutors: Alan Colquhoun, Adrian Gale, Pat Hodgkinson, Mike Wilford, John Miller, Michael Carapetian, and, for a short while, Norman Foster. There then followed a period of cri- sis that started around 19 69. The principal of the AA was John Lloyd, who changed his name to Michael as a consequence of belonging to a mystical sect that followed the teachings of Gurdjieff. The school became staffed with an increasing number of Gurd- jieff followers, and the projects started to be 75 Log 30</page><page sequence="8">permeated by mystical undertones, subtly displacing architecture or investing it with extraneous properties. The chief doctrine of this group, if it can be called a doctrine, was to advocate some kind of collective self-help, bottom-up design, accompanied by a strange rejection of buildings, because buildings were the product of top-down design - a weird rejection for a school of architecture. I tried in vain to argue that "design" is not something you do by committee, but in the end, I left this for another audience. Meanwhile, the large and beautiful studios were invaded by so-called "discussion" rooms, dark and cozy hexagonal spaces, like grottos, in which they burned incense and cooked rice while having dis- cussions about architecture, life, and death, but almost never with drawings. But Lloyd left one great legacy. Teaching at the AA was horizontal, from first to fifth year, as in all schools of architecture. John Lloyd had the ingenious idea to make it vertical instead: he introduced the Unit System, a system that was later followed worldwide. CD: So Rem arrived at the AA when John Lloyd was the principal? EZ: Yes. I was in the middle school. He joined my unit in '69, after a traumatic first year. According to him, he would go home in tears because of the fun-based post-Archigram ideology of the first-year master. In fact, Renťs end-of-year report had stated, "If Rem wants to become an architect, he'd better pull his socks up." Rem was a very seductive, aggressive fighter. I was very young, and he was only seven years younger, 24-. He had already worked as a journalist, and he was pas- sionately engrossed in architecture. He was researching Ivan Leonidov and had already started writing a book on Leonidov in col- laboration with Gerrit Oorthuys. So Rem came as a second-year student and stayed two years. He also became one of my lecturers, on Russian constructivism and, in particular, Leonidov. Also on the Berlin Wall, which was his history thesis. CD: Were you already with Zoe? EZ: Yes, we were married when I was 21 and still a student. She studied painting and stage design at what was then called the Regent Street Polytechnic. CD: I know the events of 1968-69 are very important in your thinking about the world. What happened at the AA in *68? EZ: Very little. That was a strange thing for me personally, because we had had a very traumatic period in Greece in 1967. In fact, that year I was being tempted by Panos Koulermos, who had opened an office in Athens, to join the partnership there. And I seriously considered it. In March y67 1 went down to Athens to discuss joining the part- nership of Spyros Amourgis, Nicos Kalogeras, and Koulermos. I was going to be the fourth partner. We were in the midst of the negotia- tions at the time of impending elections in Athens. The press at that time was a kind of yellow journalism, raging mostly against the universally hated royalty and raving about an imminent royal-military coup to prevent the elections from taking place and bringing the "socialist" party to power. I sensed that it was something like a self-fulfilling prophecy. It was clear that Andreas Papandreou would win the elections in a landslide. I remember expressing my worries to my future partners. It was April. We had gone to Athens by car, so we drove back to London, arriving in the evening of the 20th. I remember hearing the BBC news on the morning of the 21st. The first statement was that a military coup had taken place in Athens during the night. Tanks 76 Log 30</page><page sequence="9">had closed in on all the streets in Athens, Papandreou was caught in his pajamas, most politicians had been arrested, etc. CD: So you didn't join Panos. EZ: No I did not. At first I decided I would never go back, so I applied for British citizen- ship and I got it. For two years I refused to go, but then I missed Greece, so I went. In the meantime I took a minor part in what we called the resistance in London, working for a group organized by Eleni Cubitt, wife of James, who at the time was RIBA president and AA Council chairman. The dictatorship would go on for seven years. CD: What did you think of the student riots in Paris in '68? EZ: After the shock of the coup and dictator- ship, watching the events in Paris on tele- vision was one of the most exciting things at the time. I felt that after this, the world was not going to be the same. And in many respects it was so, although I felt deflated by the fact that, in the end, everything returned to "normal," and the dictatorship was ac- cepted worldwide. And also a little alienated, because nothing really happened in the UK or at the AA. I became conscious of the extent to which the British were apolitical and to what extent I was different from the British. Some of us did try to bring the spirit of the French rebellion into the AA, and a year later we succeeded. The majority of teachers and students wanted Michael Lloyd to be fired and to have a completely new constitution for the AA that made it more independent from the council and transferred its powers to the students and staff. The only person who could fire Michael Lloyd at the time was Cubitt. We went to see him and complained about what was going on at the AA. Cubitt told us to mind our own business, which was to teach, and kicked us out, but two days later he fired Michael Lloyd. Meanwhile, the planning department at the AA fell into the hands of some politically active people - for once there were politically active people - but they were conservative Marxists and made demands of ambivalent value. They called themselves the SRC, for Student Revolutionary Council. They were quite useful up to a point in getting rid of Michael Lloyd, but their chief objective was tenure for the teaching staff. Tenure would have meant that the AA would no longer be the AA, so we were given the task of restructuring the whole AA and rewriting the constitution. For two years we had no principal. It was run by the student and staff committee. I felt we needed a principal, but the SRC was against it. They wanted tenure and no principal. We reached a compromise by forming the School Community, the fundamental aspect of the new constitution. The School Community was like an Athenian democracy. If the main hall was filled to a point that reached a quorum, a vote could be passed that could override any votes of the council. The school belonged to the council, and the council would hire and fire staff, including the principal, but we managed to make it so all this became the community's responsibility. I remember that, together with Rem, over the course of two days we made 600 telephone calls. We told students, "You have to be interested, you have to come to the lecture room and vote, because big events are happening, it's your future, you have to take matters into your own hands." Until then, students were not involved in any of this. But suddenly they became very active. The vote was taken and power passed to the School Community, where it resides to this day. So it was a very lively period. One of the votes was whether to have a new chairman. The compromise was to change the name from principal to chairman. The chairman 77 Log ]0</page><page sequence="10">Rem Koolhaas, Madelon Vriesendorp, Elia Zenghelis, Zoe Zenghelis, Exodus, or the Voluntary Prisoners of Architecture, London, 1972.

I was then made chairman of a committee for the selection of a new chairman! After interviewing a lot of candidates, it was agreed among the students that we would reduce the list to two, and that the stu- dents would vote for one to be chairman. So we presented the school with Ken Frampton and Alvin Boyarsky. They were required to give a talk to the school about what they wanted to do. Alvin was unbearably nega- tive, moaning, "Why do we have to give a talk, why can't you decide yourselves," etc., but in the end he gave a thoroughly inspiring, open-ended talk, whereas Ken gave a very exhaustive and systematic talk that was a bit oppressive, with everything subject to one ideological view of education, politics, and culture. I was a supporter of Ken and I shared many of his views, but the school felt it was too much of a one -party line to provide a rich enough education. Alvini talk was how to turn the idea of the units into a public forum, to ensure sufficient conflicting ideologies to enter into a permanent public debate in the so-called forum. He stated that the units had to regularly declare their program and have it debated by opposing positions. The School Community voted overwhelmingly for Alvin. In retrospect, Pm glad Alvin got the job. He proved to be an astonishingly good chair- man. He himself was not an adherent of a particular ideology, but he was an incredibly 78 Log 10</page><page sequence="11">Square of Biological Emergencies, from Exodus, includes entries for Amsterdam City Hall competition by Koolhaas (top left) and Zenghelis , with Adrian Gale and Kenneth Frampton (lower right). Abstraction of Barcelona's S ant Pau Hospital (lower left) leads to a cemetery. good impresario. It was unbelievable how he brought people together and made them debate. Even though he knew I had voted for Ken, he was incredibly loyal to me, to the end of his life. Perhaps the most loyal and strong support Pve ever had. CD: While all this was going on, you contin- ued to teach. EZ: I had the second and third years, and gradually I also had fourth- and fifth-year students, as the rest of the school was mal- functioning during the 1969-70 crisis. The unit literally became a school within a school. I believed that a minimum knowledge of history was crucial for any action and for understanding why today we do things dif- ferently from yesterday, and how we came to this point. I had courses in political theory and ideological debates with historians, econ- omists, and architectural historians. These courses became very popular. People were coming to the lectures and seminars from the Bartlett, the London School of Economics, the Imperial College, the Royal College of Art, Goldsmiths College, Kingston and many parts of London, as were the lecturers, some of whom were important activists at the time. In those days we were all Marxists. CD: And Rem does his history thesis while he's in your unit. He goes to Berlin to see the wall. 79 Log 30</page><page sequence="12">EZ: Yes. He thoroughly surveyed and docu- mented it. His presentation and reinterpre- tation were shrewd and inspiring, while upholding an iconoclastic tenor toward the scholarly pretentions of the "history thesis." Without a doubt it was the seed that impelled the concept for Exodus. My acquaintance with Rem, as well as the whole history of Checkpoint Charlie, was a very important part of my maturing professionally. But in '72, Rem left for the States. He never finished the AA. It was later that Alvin gave him the Diploma. CD: So before he left you did Exodus, or the Voluntary Prisoners of Architecture together. How did that come about? EZ: Exodus was a by-product of Renťs study of the Berlin Wall. We jointly agreed that before he left for the States, we should do a competition together. We had both taken part, separately, in the competition for the Amsterdam City Hall. Our projects were fairly similar. Actually, in Exodus, the Square of Biological Emergencies features our respective Amsterdam City Hall projects. Rem and I made the drawings, Madelon and Zoe colored them with watercolors. It was Rem's idea to bring Maddie and Zoe and their painting into our own projects. At first they both were quite reluctant about what they saw as undue pressure and interference in their work. The collages we all had a go at, in differ- ent ways. Casabella had launched a compe- tition under the ambitious but strange and abstruse title, "The City as Significant Environment." Although it got no prize, mention, or other distinction, Casabella pub- lished it and put the collage for the Private Allotments on the cover of the magazine. CD: Rem then went to Ithaca. Did he know Mathias Ungers, or did you? EZ: We only knew of him and his Berlin work. I met him later, at Cornell, through Rem. Rem had a tendency to suddenly and enthusiastically fall for people, and that's what happened when he met Ungers. CD: You then made your first trip to the US. Did you take a leave from the AA to do this? EZ: Yes. This trip I owe entirely to Alvin. When he heard that Pd never been to the US, and that I wanted to go to continue my col- laboration with Rem, he set up a teaching appointment at Syracuse for me. CD: Did you teach design at Syracuse? EZ: Yes, studio. It was very well paid com- pared to the AA. I lived in Ithaca, at the house with Rem and Madelon. Everyone was in love with everyone, and Rem with Mathias. He arrived there in the midst of the Ungers/ Colin Rowe controversy and imme- diately joined sides. As a result, I never met Colin Rowe. In fact, I was not allowed to, ei- ther by Rem or Mathias, or even Colin Rowe himself. In retrospect, the whole hullabaloo seems infantile. And to think that the whole rumpus was about whether one could create , in a moment of conscious wisdom, what took centuries of unconscious evolution to accomplish. CD: What kind of relationship did you have with Ungers? EZ: Immediately very good and very friendly. I remained friendly with Mathias almost un- til his death, but I had not seen much of him. In the late '90s, when I last saw him, he bore a grudge against Rem because he felt that af- ter the strong friendship and solidarity of the early years at Cornell, Rem had dumped him. CD: In 2006 Rem and Hans-Ulrich Obrist 80 Log 30</page><page sequence="13">interviewed Mathias about his life and work [see Log 16, 2009]. They were going to do a series of interviews, but Mathias died. Now there's a new book on the Berlin Green Archipelago, by Florian Hertweck and Sebastien Marot, which documents that Rem had more to do with it than Mathias credited him for. EZ: That's correct. It was really Rem's proj- ect - and at a time when Mathias was capti- vated by Rem. Mathias would never admit to that, but I know that the entire archipelago concept, and all its implications on the terri- tory, was Rem's. They worked on the Berlin project together. It was difficult working with Mathias because he tended to be obses- sive and sensitive, on account of his age and reputation - and being young, we could easily injure his pride. We were originally planning to do the Roosevelt Island competi- tion in New York with him, but it was clear he was going to dominate rather than col- laborate, so we decided to do separate entries. But our projects contained jointly discussed notions and we exchanged ideas and criti- cism in the process. CD: What did Ungers' concept of the city within the city mean to you? Did it accord with your own ideas of the city? EZ: The idea of the archipelago, which was developed with Rem's initiative, evolved from Mathias's concept of the city within the city, which had an indelible effect on me. It became a guiding principle and the basic strategy for my approach to the contempo- rary metropolis. The project I gave the Yale students this fall [2013], for example, was founded on the premise that large cities can- not rely on one center with concentric circles of diminishing importance. The area they oc- cupy is too big for this: beyond a certain size, cities should become polycentric. The idea of the archipelago is the structuring principle for implementing this strategy. Borrowing from Massimo Cacciari's theory of the archi- pelago, each centrality has something that the others don't, a lack that connects them. The archipelago generates densities and eliminates sprawl, not only between the island-central- ities, but also at the periphery, and the city shrinks within clearly defined limits. CD: When Rem moved to Manhattan to be at the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies, did you go back to London? EZ: I went back to London but I then re- turned to the US to teach at Columbia for three consecutive years, '7?, '74, and '75. Those years in New York, and at the Insti- tute, were unforgettable. I stayed at Rem and Maddie's. They lived on West Seventieth Street, from where we would walk every morning, through frozen Central Park and down Fifth Avenue, to the Institute to work in the office there, which faced the Empire State Building. Those were intoxicating days for me. New York was the embodiment of every dream I had ever had about cit- ies; it was truly hallucinogenic. Along Fifth Avenue, in the upper Fifties, the skyscrapers looked like overblown Florentine palazzos. CD: When did you do the Hotel Sphinx proj- ect and why? EZ: New York in those days was not all gentrified, and certain streets were danger- ous. Sometimes you walked past a welfare hotel, where bums who would taunt you sat outside on the front steps. And you knew these bums urinated in the staircases inside. And the question that came to me was, would they urinate in the stair if they lived at the Hilton? So I started thinking that the so- called "existenz minimum" should be that of a luxury hotel. I extended that to the idea 81 Log 10</page><page sequence="14">Elia Zenghelis, Hotel Sphinx, New York, c. 1972-76. Exploded axonometric detail of "neck" and "head." Drawing: Zoe Zenghelis, 1975. Image © The Museum of Modern Art / Licensed by SCALA / Art Resource, NY. that a luxury hotel offers the possibility of an alternative way of living. I thought that life in a mix of apartments and houses, in a con- centrated and congested urban condition, can be very exciting, especially if an efficiently managed luxury hotel supports that life. You had the best of both worlds. In Hotel Sphinx you had your apartment, or even your villa - the stepped sides of the building are made up of villas with courtyards. The apartments would be serviced by the great variety of social and public facilities on the lower floors and the "neck" of the Sphinx. That was the ideal apartment type. The whole edifice sat like a Sphinx that faced the Times Building. The front of the Times Building is a billboard, and the Sphinx is a counter-billboard. The ideological mes- sages of this billboard were architectural, hence Lissitzky's Lenin Tribune projecting toward - and in dialectical opposition to - the Times Building. The front and sides are faced in stainless steel and draw their image from a very "Manhattanist" chrome-plated orange juicer that Madelon had bought at a New York street market. The rest of the building is in glazed red brick, typical of many Manhattan buildings. There are two towers in the back, on Forty-eighth Street - the building is between Broadway and Seventh Avenue - and Forty- seventh Street went through the middle of it. CD: Why did you do it? EZ : We worked on these "ideological" ima- ginary projects with a lot of passion. On the one hand, they were polemical, as they stood against a trend that vacillated between Team X's and Colin Rowe's discourses, and on the other, they were to be supporting images for Rem's theory of Manhattanism, as he was writing Delirious Nei» York at the time, testing each chapter in lectures at my Columbia class. 82 Log 10</page><page sequence="15">Elia Zenghelis, Hotel Sphinx, New York, c. 1972-76. Axonometric. Drawing: Zoe Zenghelis. Image © The Museum of Modern Art / Licensed by SCALA / Art Resource, NY. CD: Was the Egg of Columbus Circle another one of these projects? EZ: Yes, as were most of the projects we did at the time. I never thought it was successful. I didn't like it very much then, and I don't like it now. CD: What was the symbolism of the egg? EZ: The idea of the Egg of Columbus is that architecture is easy - indeed, we make it complicated. Under the Smithsons, ar- chitecture projects were seen as problem- solving exercises. Problem solving was part of the architectural jargon, projects were called "problems." In fact, many remember Rem's pronouncement, "It's clear, there are no problems." The name for the Egg of Columbus Circle is a reference to the apocryphal story of how Christopher Columbus challenged his critics to make an egg stand on its tip. After they gave up, he just crushed the tip of it and it stood upright. The symbolism was also a riposte to the architectural com- munity's tenets of received wisdom and convoluted indoctrination. Despite puffery in pamphlets like the Team X Primer , every- thing they sanctioned appeared as torture instead of pleasure . Our critique of the architectural estab- lishment was presented in various forms besides writing. In Gericault's 19th-century 83 Log 30</page><page sequence="16">painting, The Raft of the Medusa, we saw the half- starved survivors at the moment they see the rescue ship Argus approaching as an apt representation of the architectural community. It is said that before the raft was found, the survivors had started cannibal- ism. In the Egg of Columbus Circle the raft is dropping by parachute onto the rescue ship of the city. While I was doing the Hotel Sphinx and this project, Rem did the Welfare Palace Hotel and other projects. There is a big axo drawing, called New Welfare Island , in which we put all the projects we had done for New York. Rem's swimming pool, The Raft of the Medusa , a Malevich tektonik meet- ing Norman Bel Geddes' ship on Roosevelt Island, the Sphinx, the RCA Building, Rem's counter-United Nations in the river, etc. Then, of course, we did the Roosevelt Island competition. CD: What was the thinking for that project? EZ: For Roosevelt Island we extended Manhattan's urban grid onto the island. Seventy-second Street fell approximately in the middle of the site, and became the main street. The streets were constituted according to the principles of Manhattan streets, with a tower at either end and one midblock, with browns tones in between. The towers were faced in glazed brick, in the colors of the American or Dutch flag, and the brownstones were rendered in different colors. As I was teaching at Columbia, I gave the Roosevelt Island competition as a project to the class. Bob Stern was teaching history and theory at Columbia at the time. He was also doing the competition, and we all presented our respective projects at the studio's final jury. The next day was the "real" jury - Bob won, and his project was realized. CD: When did the Office for Metropolitan Architecture become a reality? Were you thinking about it when you were all in New York together? EZ: It was New Year's Eve, 1975, in a New York restaurant. It was a small favorite of Rem and Maddie's, half French, half Japanese. It was the three of us. It was then that the name was decided. The naming was celebrated in a postcard with an American flag painted by Madelon. It had taken a long time to get to this name. Before that, names like The Dr. Caligari Office for Architecture had been floated, after Robert Wiene's movie The Cabinet of Dr Caligari . CD: Was this movie especially influential on your thinking? EZ: Very much. Because of his reverence for the movie, and the fact that the setting, the architecture , framed the action in a very in- strumental way, Rem was early on suggesting that name, and later, The Dr. Caligari Office for Metropolitan Architecture, but until that New Year's Eve, the actual name of the office was left pending. The idea of the metropolis came after experiencing Manhattan. I was very forcefully reminded of this just half an hour ago when I came out of Grand Central Sta- tion, after some years of absence. The "im- ages" of New York are one thing, but being here is another thing altogether. CD: So the ambition behind the name was an idea about the metropolis, or what consti- tuted the metropolitan in architecture. EZ: Yes, and that architecture existed for the city. Rem was already working on Delirious New York and was under the spell of Dali, as the title reveals. Moreover, the book makes frequent use of aphorisms that are remi- niscent of Dalinian expressions, especially in his romantic novel Hidden Faces , a story 84 Log 10</page><page sequence="17">Ella.

Certain of his statements are indicative of this: "At the age of six I wanted to be a cook. At seven I wanted to be Napoleon. And my ambition has been growing steadily ever since." "Intel- ligence without ambition is a bird without wings." "There are some days when I think I'm going to die from an overdose of satisfac- tion." It's worth noting how frequently the word overdose is used in Rem' s texts, as well those of Rem fans. And finally, "There is only one difference between a madman and me. I am not mad." CD: That's all Dalí? EZ: Yes. Rem's and Dali's writing styles are intelligent, iconoclastic, eloquent, and su- premely funny - and very comparable. CD: Did Dalí have an influence on you? Not on your writing, but on your thinking? EZ: Rem certainly had an influence on my thinking; Dalí had an influence on Rem. Dali was living, appropriately enough, at the Hotel St. Regis in New York. I was in New York when, in the '80s, Rem decided he had to meet Dalí to discuss the paranoid-critical method. Rem managed to make the appoint- ment - and now I'm telling you the sequel, as Rem narrated it to me: he walks into the room and says to Dalí, "Master," or whatever, "I'm an architect-admirer and fan of yours, and I want to talk to you about the paranoid- critical method, the way you use it, because I also use it in my own work." Dalí turns to him and says, "Money!" And in a powerful crescendo, "Money Money Money Money Money . . ." so loud that in the end Rem left in a near panic. He went straight home and told me the story. CD: It's clear that Dali's paranoid-critical method influenced Delirious New York . Did the personification, or anthropomorphism, of buildings and their psychoses that Madelon was painting influence you? Because the Hotel Sphinx has anthropomorphic qualities. EZ: Madelon's obsession with seeing build- ings as individuals did influence me. I think it also influenced Rem. Rem might say it was the other way around, but it worked both ways. Madelon had an astonishing and very idiosyncratic imagination and she managed to make any reality transcend itself, into another reality beyond, belonging to a whole world that existed in her fantasy: an amazing vision, always surprising you with its ever- innovative richness. And her influence very strongly seeped into Delirious New York . The Hotel Sphinx, especially the anthropomor- phic aspect of its neck and head, was in part a by-product of Madelon's influence, while 86 Log 30</page><page sequence="19">Rem Koolhaas and Elia Zenghelis/OMA, Roosevelt Island Redevelopment, New York, 1975. Competition entry. Image © The Museum of Modern Art / Licensed by SCALA / Art Resource, NY. also being a counterpoint to that other an- thropomorphic symbol, the Statue of Liberty. CD: Which is something that Madelon often painted, moving the statue around. EZ: She did. And elements of it are trans- posed to the Sphinx. The Bar in the Sky is a quotation from the crown of the Statue of Liberty. The Hotel Sphinx also reflected the time when I was discovering the Art Deco of New York, circulating, whenever possible, through the midblock series of intercon- nected lobbies. Art Deco detailing came into the design of the Hotel Sphinx and Rem' s Welfare Palace Hotel. CD: Charles Jencks called the Sphinx sur- rationalist architecture. Not surreal, but surrational. For Jencks, surrationalist was a neologism for the reunion of real urban function and existing urban fantasy. Was the Sphinx a union of function and fantasy, and did that make it surrationalist, as opposed to pure rationalism? EZ: Charlie is a whiz -kid of isms and it is best left to him to decide on them. We were neither advocating nor opposed to any isms, but we did not adhere to any either - and Charlie's would not be an exception. Equally, were not necessarily opposed to pure ratio- nalism; we just did not adhere to it. And we were certainly not against modernism, which we saw as an unfinished chapter. Here we enter a whole discussion about "trends" and "factions." I always feel un- comfortable with classifications. I disagreed 87 Log 30</page><page sequence="20">Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas, Elia Zenghelis/OMA, Dutch Parliament Extension, The Hague, Netherlands, 1978. Competition entry. © OMA. with trends that searched for "newness," as I believed there was nothing new to be dis- covered. For example, Archigram rejected rationalism as it had evolved, and they were moving away from what they saw as indoc- trination, which they considered boring. In adopting a pop imagery, they were celebrat- ing consumerism. But to go back to your question about the surrational: we did find surrealism inspiring for our purposes, as it invests architectural drawing with a substitute reality, with hid- den promises that are enigmatically calm and motivating. In the case of Dalí, what is often seen as cheap sensationalism is explained in The Secret Life of Salvador Dali as the product of memory and moments of boredom. When children get bored they resort to imagina- tion, they invent. Dalí recalls the walks that his nanny would take him on along the coast of Cadaques, where he grew up. The nanny would sit on the beach, ignoring him. In his intense boredom, Dalí would see a window carved out of her fat body, and inside that window, a fantastic and hallucinatory land- scape would emerge that would mesmerize him. And there is an exact painting of this description. He also describes his memories as a growing embryo in his mother's womb. It's all beautifully described in a chapter about "intra-uterine memories." So I suppose what Charlie calls surra- tionalism could be an application of the same method to the processes of rationalism: a method by which a window of fantasy opens onto the landscape of reality. CD: At this point in time were you more interested in ideology than in style? EZ: We always rejected the idea of style and argued that architecture was subject to ideol- ogy: architectural ideology, separate from but allied with political ideology. We considered 88 Log 10</page><page sequence="21">style an aesthetic category of historians, ex- traneous to the intrinsic essence of architec- ture. We never discussed a subject in which we were in agreement, no matter how impor- tant it was to us. Politically I leaned to the left of Rem's liberal views, but this divergence was immaterial to our work at the time. CD: While you were in New York you still had an obligation at the AA, no? Running the famous Unit 9 in the Diploma School. EZ: I taught at the AA throughout Alvini chairmanship. He supported me and I sup- ported him. At first I taught with Leon Krier, then with Rem, then Rem and Zaha. Zaha took over Unit 9 [in 1980], and I finally left the AA in 1985. CD: How did you meet Leon? EZ: I had seen his projects in Controspazio : a modernistic university project, like a ma- chine extrusion, and his beautiful aerial view of the Echternach project. He seemed to be at a crossroads, switching over to his now time-honored and particularized Krier- traditionalism. I liked both the drawings and the projects, which had the unambigu- ous - but rare, in those days - stamp of an architect. I asked around to find out who this guy was, because I was looking for someone to join our teaching team. A student who was working at [James] Stirling's office part-time told me, "Leon works at Jim's office!" I asked him to tell Leon that Pd like to meet him. That evening Leon came to my house. We in- stantly became friends, and he started teach- ing with me [in 1973]. The year after he had his own unit [in the Intermediate School]. CD: Didn't Leon have Zaha as a student? EZ: Yes. Our studios were next to each other, on the very top floor, and had an intercommunicating door, which we used regularly. Zaha came into our unit a year later [1975, the year Rem joins as a tutor]. That's where she did her magnificent Museum for the 19th Century, on Char- ring Cross Station and Hungerford Bridge [1976-77]. Zaha was a strong and very talented personality and we soon became friends, a friendship that endures to this day. As we were planning to enter the competition for the Houses of Parliament in The Hague, we considered asking her to join us. Thinking we could control her impulsive temperament, Rem suggested that we ask her to observe certain criteria and OMA rules as a stipula- tion for the collaboration. She overheard him, and she broke in and declared, "If you guys want to work with me, it will be you who will have to observe my criteria and rules of work." It was a turbulent and emotional but very creative and exceptionally memorable collaboration. I think it produced the best projects any of us ever did. On one occa- sion I lost my temper and swore at Zaha. She immediately burst into tears. I think this was a ploy of hers. Rem and Maddie pampered her for hours while accusing me of unspeakable cruelty. Zaha then decided to be on her own. She was teaching with us, but we did separate projects for the Irish prime minister's resi- dence competition. CD: Was most of OMA's work being done in London? EZ: Yes, but just as Mathias had been obsessed with going back to Germany and opening an office there, Rem wanted to have an office in Holland. So eventually there were two offices. But most of the work we are talking about was done in London, although I went to Rotterdam at regular intervals. 89 Log 10</page><page sequence="22">Rem Koolhaas and Elia Zenghelis/OMA, Irish Prime Minister's Residence, Dublin, Ireland, 197 9. Axonometric from COMPETITION ENTRY. © OMA.</page><page sequence="23">CD: Tell me about the project OMA did at Checkpoint Charlie. EZ: In 1981, Josef Kleihues, the organizer of IBA [. Internationale Bauausstellung] in Berlin, invited us to enter two competitions for what was then West Berlin, a veritable "city in a city," a capitalist island surrounded by the vast socialist capital of the DDR. One was at Lützowstrasse in the Tiergarten area, and the other on Friedrichstrasse by the famous Checkpoint Charlie at the Berlin Wall. Rem and I were now doing separate projects in the office, but we held weekly interoffice mini juries to review each other's work. For these competitions we each chose to do one. It was natural, given his past preoccupation with the wall, that Rem chose the Checkpoint Charlie site. I got a joint ñrst prize with Vittorio Gregotti for my Lützowstrasse entry. Despite doing a truly magnificent project for Checkpoint Charlie, Rem did not get a prize. His entry was a dense project of two-story- high courtyard houses, with the occasional third-floor room - it was a precursor of the Fukuoka project, and better - but that was the problem. In the historically false Kleihues doctrine of "the rehabilitation of the Berlin block" - in truth, a ploy to erase the me- mory of 40 years of unpleasant history - the building regulations stipulated a seven-story building to line up with the other buildings on the block. While Gregotti and I were reaching an agreement on how to collaborate on the Lützowstrasse site, Rem kept trying to get the Checkpoint Charlie site. He managed to convince Kleihues to ask the winner, Oriol Bohigas, if he would release the part of the site that faced the wall for Rem to do a project. Being the gentleman he is, Bohigas obliged. But Rem insisted the building should not be higher than the wall, which he believed would never come down, while Kleihues maintained that the building regula- tions had to be observed, prompting another stalemate. In exasperation Rem gave up and asked me to take over. Kleihues requested that I comply. I agreed and the job slipped into my hands, but I had to forego Lützowstrasse, which then slipped into Gregotti's hands. I did not do the project I won, I did one neither of us had won. CD: So you had to start again. EZ: I had to start again. I also had to have the blessing of Bohigas, who was getting an in- ferior site - not a very comfortable situation. It was like stealing a piece of his prize. In the end I cheated on Kleihues's regulations. To achieve Rem's wish that the horrors of the wall would not be visible from the building, I pushed the building some seven meters back from the building line and placed only the access corridors on the street side, while the apartments looked onto a quiet, common garden in the back. CD: Wasn't IBA partly a political strategy to show the East how good life was in the West? EZ: Probably, yes. But it was more important to spare the residents the sight of people try- ing to escape. I had a tactical as well as con- ceptual reason for pushing the building back. I had begun to detect a German tendency for historical amnesia. What they don't like to remember they try to cover up, as if it never happened. Healing the scars of Berlin smoth- ered the reason for the scars, and thus erased its memory. One of the results of the bomb- ing of Berlin was that it was like a mouth with broken teeth, with lone buildings stand- ing in vacant urban blocks, their party walls now exposed. These "firewalls" gave Berlin a beautifully poignant identity. True, they were stark reminders of the tragedy of the war, but the war was part of the city's history, and 91 Log 30</page><page sequence="24">history cannot be smothered. By pushing my building back I was also exposing, on either side of it, seven meters of firewall. You still see them today, even though my ground floor has been destroyed by commercial infill, an extension we were supposed to be commis- sioned for, but never were. Thanks to the professional help I had, this project probably constituted my most enjoyable building experience. There are many aspects of the profession I have never really liked. I don't particularly like clients, contractors, subcontractors, negotiations, arguments, or the wheeling and dealing of site meetings. A lot of the things about the mechanisms of putting a building up that I had to live through during my time at Douglas Stephen I found distasteful. I prefer the design of buildings that convey ideas that are important to me, ideas about the poten- tial instrumentality that architecture pos- sesses and its role in the city, etc. I don't care whether they get built or not. After all, the history of architecture does not only consist of built projects. Boullée and Leonidov are but two examples. I was lucky to have Hans Kollhoff as a very responsible and dedicated contact archi- tect, a student of Ungers whom I had briefly taught when I was Ungers* surrogate in Los Angeles. A modern architect who had done some very beautiful buildings in Berlin. I want to conclude this question of German amnesia with an anecdote. Two days after the wall fell down, Eleni and I went to Berlin because we had work there at the time. Hans picked us up at the airport in this new, big black Mercedes. He wanted to drive us around the city, in particular along Köpenicker Strasse, one of the longest streets of the city, which went in and out of East and West Berlin. Hans was full of excitement. Looking at the scar that the wall was leaving on the city, Eleni recalled a project she had done for the Boulevard Peripherique in Paris - a circular park that contained public ame- nities around the city's center and a major public resource. She suggested it as a fitting idea for the ring that the wall created around former West Berlin. Hans said, "What do you mean?" We said, the wall is a historical feature, it stands for 40 years of history in the city, and something ought to be done with it as an entity. Hans went into an uncontainable rage. He screeched, "We have to eliminate this scourge! We have to forget about it! We have to build over it! We have to seal that gap with what was there before!" We said it was wrong - and impossible - to forget 40 years of one's history. Even if they were traumatic years, one has to remember them in order to make the ones that follow healthy and enjoyable years of quality. They are part of one's collective memory. We wondered, if one becomes oblivious to history, what future can one have? Well, they're now leading Europe. * * * CD: In 1977 Architectural Design did an issue on OMA that said part of OMA's agenda was to make the banal surprising, and that the Egg of Columbus Circle represents the rev- elation that architecture can be easy. Do you still subscribe to those ideas? EZ: Yes, theoretically speaking. We make architecture unnecessarily difficult with our self-indulgent pretentions. If you accept that architecture follows a common language, as it always has, then, as such, it is easy. Of course there have been architectural cultures that reflected the differences in civilization, and there are always good architects who produce better architecture than a lot of others who do not. This opens up a whole other issue: there are too many architects, there are too many architecture schools, and the study of architecture is too popular. As for making the banal surprising: tak- ing a seemingly populist stand with such a 92 Log 10</page><page sequence="25">Elia Zenghelis/OMA, Lützowstrasse, IBA Housing Competition, Berlin, i98i.

It was also a hype that made an impossible claim, a delib- erate display of subversive snootiness. CD: But you yourself are implicated in the proliferation of students. You keep teaching! EZ: I believe in the way I do it, and this does not contradict what I said. I think there should be good schools of architecture and there should be good teachers, but there are far too many and they are not all good. It's a mass production. As Leon said a long time ago, half the schools should close down. En- try should be more difficult, and the admis- sion criteria should not be based on school income requirements. There should be more ways of facilitating students to branch out into other disciplines after the first year. Tell- ing students early on is an important respon- sibility that, unfortunately, nobody takes in the present system of education. The first two years should be test years, but they should always count as credit for another degree. One should find what each student is good at. At this level, teaching is a bit like playing the role of an architectural midwife. So the num- ber of schools and the surfeit of architects is one of my hot issues. The other issue, and it's another chap- ter all together, is that I believe, generally speaking, that women are better at archi- tecture than men, even though in my 45 years of teaching, of my four best students, three were men. I believe this is the case only because the men paid greater attention to the fundamental importance of the frame and context of architecture in human culture and history, and therefore to the importance of theory. This is a responsibility that talented women still have to undertake. CD: What was the idea of the exquisite corpse at OMA in the late '70s? EZ: It was a manifesto to underline our op- position to all the doctrines about urban sequences, contextual relationships, formal composition, and architectural synthesis. It was also an assertion that a certain level of pluralistic instrumentality is involved in the making of things; a claim that more than one player is implicated, especially in the dimen- sion of time. CD: Did you think someone else could add to or change the project, or that you could put elements together that looked like they didn't come from the same hand? EZ: It was more an acceptance of the inevita- ble vulnerability of the product. It was never a pretense of multiple authors - that was counter to our convictions. We have already discussed the appeal of surrealism. I person- ally always claimed total control of a project, from beginning to end, even in urban design. What bothered me about Colin Rowe's col- lage city was that I could not accept the idea that what takes centuries to evolve can be achieved in a moment of gratuitous compo- sition. The collages and accidents are there because clashes and contradictions occur in history. You cannot generate them, they are not a question of inspiration. Suprematism offered us exquisite corpses as inspirational context. Malevich's tektonik was a form without content, like an empty canvas waiting to be filled in. Today, though, while I acknowledge that it was very inspir- ing for architectural exercises, I do not see it as a paradigm for architecture. CD: Is there a paradigm for architecture that you subscribe to today? EZ: On the scale of making the city, the Toronto Dominion Center; on the scale of making architecture, the Barcelona Pavilion. They are both silent but complete lessons 94 Log 30</page><page sequence="27">OMA, Checkpoint Charlie Apartments, constructed 1987-90. Photo ©Javier Sanchez- Matamoros Perez. Courtesy OMA.

The Barcelona Pavilion is a complete course on the essence of architecture. Toronto Dominion is a complete course on architecture in the city. If you study them properly, they contain all you need to know in order to continue from where they leave off. CD: Given the so-called manifesto for mod- ernism that was embedded in the office's work, how would you describe your confron- tation with postmodernism as seen in OMA's storefront for the Strada Novissima at the Venice Biennale in 1980? EZ: Isn't that made self-evident by our con- tribution to that charade? The only reason we were included was Charlie Jencks's pressure on [Paolo] Portoghesi, who was otherwise dead against it. This was understandable, because Strada Novissima was the apotheosis of postmodernism in architecture, and our entry made our position against this miasma very obvious. What was most distressing about postmodernism was that the aban- donment of modernism was in the name of historical respect, together with the illusion that there was a need to move on to some- thing else. The claim to historical continuity was manifested with depressing quotations from the past that randomly crept onto new buildings, whether as pitched roofs or as decoration. The upshot was cheap, miscon- strued, bad copying that ended up devaluing the original. It was an insult to history. CD: Did you sense that there was an ideo- logical position at stake, or did it seem more stylistic? EZ: There was obviously an ideological posi- tion at stake, and an ideological position was claimed. But the appearance was totally sty- listic. I could see no ideology. There is an un- deniably ideological position in Leon's work, even as he turns against modernism. He has always been explicit about his appreciation of Le Corbusier and of good modernism. But he does not trust it, and quite correctly. One cannot dispute his resentment of the devasta- tion modernism has done to cities. But the ideological position taken has a certain deficit, with a two-sided flaw: politi- cal and stylistic. To explain what I mean, look at the architecture of Quinlan Terry, who graduated from the AA with me. Throughout his third, fourth, and fifth years, his work had a "stylistic" bias: his projects were in a Gothic, Byzantine, or other eclectic style. Peter Smithson dismissed his fifth-year thesis as "irresponsible." And there is the catch: while Terry was taking a polemical position against modernism, he was not taking into account the fundamental demands that his architecture was making on craftsmanship, not ordinarily modernism's calling. Crafts- men are hard to find, as craftsmanship is a time-consuming art that is gradually disap- pearing in an age that finds it unaffordable. This is the political side of the flaw. The stylistic flaw stems from the fact that the architectures invoked have certain im- manent and distinguishing properties that are unassailable, like proportion, size, construc- tion, and materials. Once these are violated the architecture collapses. If one examines architecture before the Modern Movement, it becomes instantly evident that questions such as proportion, the relation of the horizontal to the vertical, of floor to ceiling heights, and the volume of space are intrinsic and funda- mental to its integrity. At the same time, these are properties that no developer will pay for today. What you get instead are shriveled and inept pastiches of either Georgian or other admired 18th-century paradigms. In the end, it's the difference between beauty and ugliness. The so-called postmodern archi- tecture is doomed to produce ugliness that is inspired by beauty: it's a trap architects fall 96 Log 30</page><page sequence="29">Left to right: Madelon Vriesendorp, Rem Koolhaas, Elia Zenghelis, and Zoe Zenghelis in Central Park, New York City, c. mid-1970s. into when they fail to recognize the inbuilt contradictions of what they are trying in vain to achieve. CD: How was the wall that OMA did for Strada Novissima a critique of that project? EZ: It was not a wall, it was a flimsy cur- tain made from white gauze you could see through. It was a rejection of the idea of a so-called "postmodernist" street more than a criticism. We lifted one corner of the cloth and pinned it higher, leaving a little trian- gular gap for the entrance to our space, and inside we exhibited large paintings of our projects. The flimsiness of our facade, com- pared to the monumentality of all the others, gave it a certain delicacy and freshness. CD: Was there any reaction to it from your peers along the Strada? EZ: Jim Stirling liked it. It was one of those strange things, when the last person you ex- pect comes and congratulates you. But in the main, they mostly avoided us. I don't remem- ber meeting Portoghesi even once. CD: Just the year before, at the '79 Trienale in Milan, you defended modernism as a formulation of program and not a matter of style. How do you see program as a genesis for architecture? EZ: The program contributes in determin- ing the plan, and the plan is of the essence in determining the form. Apart from this, archi- tecture exists in the mind as a preconception. The plan sets the choreography of the action, and this sets the choreography of the form, which otherwise follows one's tenets. We did not talk much about form but we certainly took great pains to illustrate it. Then we were perhaps avoiding cliche discussions about the obvious, but recently form seems to be seen as a product of computation. I believe that I as an architect decide, and my parameters are the ones that count. CD: After you and Rem stopped teaching Unit 9 together [1980], you did the Antiparos proj- ect in Greece. Tell me about this. EZ: The opportunity offered itself when a Greek friend and client, Ion Siotis, bought land on Antiparos, a small Cycladic island in the Aegean, the islands with the vernacular architecture that Le Corbusier admired. This was the happiest and most productive period of my OMA stint. CD: In a painting that you and Zoe made for Antiparos [see Log 50 postcard], 16 villas seem to be simply cast over the landscape. You used the term confetti to describe it. This seemed to be a new idea, and the way the villas are strewn across the landscape almost seems to anticipate the distribution of program at La Villette. EZ: There is certainly a relationship between Antiparos and La Villette. Without Antiparos, I would not have had the confidence I had when interpreting the brief of La Villette. Until then, all our work engaged the big scale, congestion, and high densities of the 97 Log 10</page><page sequence="30">Initial hypothesis (scale: I /20,000) The strips Point grids . or confetti metropolis. Antiparos was the antithesis to all that. The site was an empty expanse by the beach, with just the sea and the horizon, and I felt rather lost. Seeking inspiration, I made a model of the site, but the shape of the model looked like a pork chop, and because I could not get rid of this unfortunate analogy my imagina- tion was stunted even further. It was only when looking at the inhabited landscape on the mountain slopes of neighboring islands that I realized they were fabricated com- positions, the elements of which were lines (roads and walls), points (farmhouses and outbuildings), and surfaces (the distinct farms that the roads and walls defined). I then saw the site as an empty canvas waiting for a composition: a painting first, in place of the well-disciplined and trodden path of dealing with the fabric, the grid, and the volumes of the city. When Rem saw the painting he said he liked the confetti. That's how the term entered the OMA terminology. Composition has remained a very important priority in architecture for me. That was quite contrary to what I'd been taught by the Smithsons. CD: How did Antiparos lead to La Villette? EZ: I applied the compositional approach of Antiparos to the layout of the program that required the distribution of numerous small, pointlike servicing structures. The param- eters were the same, they were confetti. La Villette was done immediately after Antiparos. It was a catalytic episode in the OMA annals, as it foretold the team's even- tual dissolution. La Villette was the project that made me realize that I was tired of the by then malfunctioning "collaboration," al- though the beginning was joint and positive. The Dutch landscape, consisting of those var- iegated strips of flowers that you see on every trip to Holland, was the inspiration from the start - the claim that it was the section of the Downtown Athletic Club is a post-rational- ization that Rem liked to broadcast. CD: How did you interpret the program? EZ: The competition brief turned the entire site into a programmatic park. The strips ac- commodated the required programs. There were two existing buildings, the old abattoir and the Museum of Science by [Adrien] Fainsilber, which was being built at the time and included a series of outdoor ob- jects that we incorporated into our scheme. A 98 Log *0</page><page sequence="31">Rem Koolhaas and Elia Zeng- helis/OMA, Parc de la Villette, Paris, France, 1982. Programmatic diagrams. © OMA. canal divided the site in two. It was 25 meters wide, so we divided the site into 25-meter- wide strips that also incorporated the canal. We then reorganized the program's hierar- chies in five overlaid layers. We had one main circulation element, a boulevard, running perpendicular to the bands, and a secondary, circuitous path that meandered through the bands. The calculation for spacing the grids for each element was the square root of A - the entire available area - minus the total area of each particular object, divided by the number of times that this object needed to appear. The square root of that produced the grid. The main boulevard was the starting point for all the grids. As each confetti had a different grid, they generated, through this pseudo-scientific operation, a rich composi- tion and set of relationships. CD: So you worked out the bands with Rem, and then did the grids? EZ: Yes. Rem would come every two weekends when we had little juries, and he was extreme- ly useful at these. But the first stage ended in a very irritating way. Rem was in America dur- ing the last three weeks and he came back after we had submitted it. A disgruntled participant showed it to him in Holland and complained that I had been a slave driver. Rem rang me up and after some abuse told me that I had humiliated him with this bad project. He was referring to the now well-known black-panel plan. I was baffled at his ranting and told him to stop behaving like a spinster. This threw him into an uncontrollable rage and the whole con- frontation ended ominously. And that is when I decided I had to leave. CD: This is before the jury, before the presen- tation for the competition? EZ: Yes, it was before. After that, Rem an- nounced that the second stage - which our scheme was selected for - would be done in Rotterdam, and that he was going to make a model. But at Rotterdam nobody knew the project, so every few days I was called over to supervise and make working drawings for the construction of the pavilions. I ended up going frequently to Rotterdam and getting more and more irritated. And then Rem and I went to Paris. CD: You both went? EZ: Yes, even though we were hardly on 99 Log 30 -U -&lt;vss and em ulation The final layer</page><page sequence="32">Rem Koolhaas and Elia Zenghelis/OMA, Parc de la Villette, Paris, France, 1982.

When we got to Paris, he announced that he would present the proposal alone. Stupidly I did not object. After presenting, Rem left in anger without saying a word, while Bernard Tschumi was celebrating. The next day Joseph Rykwert called me and asked if we could meet. We met for dinner and Françoise Choay joined us. During dinner they asked why I had not gone to the jury and I told them. They told me that it was a disaster, that Rem was abomi- nable, rude, and negative, whereas Bernard was obliging and extremely accommodat- ing. A month before the final jury [François] Mitterrand had decided to cut all the Grands Projets , and La Villette was one of them, forc- ing the jury to ask the participants to make cuts. Rem had turned down all suggestions, in effect saying take it or leave it. I suppose that if one does not see this as destructive, in a way it's an admirable single-mindedness. Françoise and Joseph thought our project should have won, but they said the majority of the jury was of the opinion that one could not collaborate with such a fixated individual. CD: These are the moments that make history in architecture. The things that get built and the things that don't. EZ: That evening I was miserable. I decided I was going to look for the first opportunity to quit. By then OMA had split into the Greek OMA and the Dutch OMA. I saw Rem very rarely after that. He was in Rotterdam all week, and when he came to London he would spend the weekend with Madelon and his young children. Fortunately, other Greek projects followed soon after. And opening an Athens office was partly an opportunity to dis- tance myself a little from Rem's testy personal- ity, and chiefly to form a partnership with my former student and close friend, Elias Veneris. CD: These would be the Cephalonia projects? EZ: Yes. The minister of the environment, Antonis Tritsis, an architect, had seen La Villette and commissioned me to do a series of projects for his native island, Cephalonia. Tritsis was a buoyant and boisterous character, a left-wing activist who claimed to have once fought alongside Che Guevara. I don't know if that was true, but when I went to La Paz, all the architects of my generation asked if I knew Antonis Tritsis. The island's capital, Argostoli, is on a bay within a bay called Koutavos. This bay was so polluted that the whole town stank. It had a Napoleonic bridge, built at its mouth by the French in 1812 and blocking its cur- rents, and an installation where the Greek army was making asphalt. Next to this was a cheese factory that discharged its waste into the bay. Finally, the lush copse at the end of the bay, filled with fresh water streams that ran down from the mountains, had been made the town's garbage dump: an idyllic location with a polyphony of pollutants. Clearly the first priority was to deal with the pollution, so I decided to create a liquid park with installations in the water, turning its entire surface into a resource through a series of mobile mechanical and architectural ele- ments that oxygenated the water and reintro- duced a current around the end of the bay - a functional, mechanical project, filled with enjoyable, eye-catching elements. I generated five stations around the bay that corresponded to the changing landscape, created an inter- face between water and land, and reinforced existing activities. Linking the stations was a circular promenade and bicycle path that went around the bay and over the bridge, and a battery- charged electric boat that was pro- pelled by a big waterwheel that oxygenated the water while crossing the bay. I was also asked to develop a project for two magnificent and popular sandy beaches 101 Log 30</page><page sequence="34">Rem Koolhaas and Elia Zenghelis/OMA, Parc de la Villette, Paris, France, 1982.

These were very enjoyable proj- ects that I was lucky to develop together with Veneris, projects that, in traditional Greek fashion, were shelved when the opposition came into power. * * * CD: Why did you stop teaching Unit 9? EZ: Rem no longer wanted to teach and he stopped first. He was a great teacher. For me, teaching has always been a dialectical way of learning, and an essential way of keeping in touch with my elemental self, so I have never considered stopping, but I had been doing the same thing for so many years at the AA that it was beginning to feel stale. I was asked to teach at Princeton, which was a welcome change, and the time in Greece kept me away for long periods. Later, Ungers convinced me to take over the chair Jim Stirling left at the Düsseldorf Kunstakademie. CD: What did you do your last years at the AA? EZ: I was taking on external students. Alvin started pressuring me to become more in- dependent, even to pull out of OMA. He thought I was being exploited by Rem and he was getting irritated at my acquiescence. I remember arguing that this was not deliber- ate. I could never match Renťs ambition. He saw me as self-indulgent, a fairly accurate charge from his point of view. His indigna- tion was fair. "I run around, all over the place," he would say, "looking for work, meeting people, and you just sit down and design ." He provided the work, no question; 102 Log 30</page><page sequence="35">I could not face the "going around," and my complacency must have been extremely ir- ritating. On the other hand, I think he loved this intense whirlwind of alternating activity. He had very limited patience for sustained concentration. He always quoted Leonidov's claim that human nature can only maintain cycles of 20 minutes for each activity - often alternating with 20 minutes of sleep. But someone had to just sit down and design , and that takes time. Of course, I liked doing it. After La Villette, our relationship was crucially damaged, and I decided that, at an opportune moment, I would break up the dwindling collaboration. My decision to do this was my own initiative, before the tension Rem generated became an insufferable bur- den. It was a kind of divorce, and a break, the fulfillment of the desire for mental tranquil- ity, and a clean slate. To begin with, I took a year off, taking a teaching engagement at Princeton as a trial and first step. Rem reacted angrily at first, accusing me of disloyalty, egotism, and irresponsibility. He then met me in New York and tried to argue that what I was doing was inconceivable, a folly, and ut- terly oblivious of reality. He had always made a point about what he said to me was "the discrepancy between your view of reality and reality." I was very reluctant to contradict him, but I was determined that I would not return. I did not rejoin OMA, knowing that much of the work I had been doing was due to Rem, and that the office in Rotterdam was being flooded with commissions. I liked to concentrate on one thing at a time, an unde- niable weakness for an architect. After that we rarely met. We made sev- eral attempts to meet at Rotterdam when I was at the Berlage, all cancelled for various reasons. And I tried to get him the Mies van der Rohe Award for European Architecture for the Maison à Bordeaux when I was a member of the jury, but it was given to Peter Zumthor for his Bregenz Kunsthaus. Eventually I persuaded Rem to come to the jury of Pier Vittorio Aurelio gradua- tion review at the Berlage. Wiel Arets, Bart Lootsma, and others in the Berlage faculty all said, "You think you can get Rem to come for any minor project at the gradu- ation reviews?" I knew what to tell him to activate his curiosity, and he came, to everyone's stupefaction. CD: You now live in Athens with your wife Eleni. When did you meet? EZ: I met her first in 1985, when she was a student of Zaha's at the AA. I had admired her work, and in particular the park encir- cling Paris, along the Boulevard Peripherique, and also a very imaginative project for a floating island. When she finished at the AA she worked on Checkpoint Charlie for a while with Matthias Sauerbruch. I got to know her later, and we married in 1994. CD: Do you practice architecture together, or is Eleni an independent practitioner? Did you form an office? EZ: We formed a partnership, which we called GZA - Gigantes Zenghelis Architects. But I was immersed in education, and with the exception of a few projects, like the Moabiter Werder Housing in Berlin, I took a backseat. Eleni did most of the projects. CD: Is it true that you gave up practice to just teach? You were also teaching at Düsseldorf in the '90s. EZ: I did not give up practice. Since I was heavily engaged in teaching, Eleni had to both run the office and design the projects, but I did not abandon the office. I was in- volved all along, as an advocate and help- ing hand. I was at Düsseldorf until my 65th birthday, when I had to retire according to 103 Log 30</page><page sequence="36">GZA, Moabiter Werder Parliamentary Housing, Berlin, 1995. Plan. Competition entry. Courtesy GZA. German law. I had been living in Brussels, where I also taught, and started teaching at the Berlage in 1992, a year after it was founded by Herman Hertzberger. I taught there for nearly 20 years, until 2010. In the early years the Berlage was in Amsterdam. Amsterdam, Brussels, Düsseldorf formed an isosceles triangle that I would drive every week. Once I became a pensioner, I kept being asked by various universities to do workshops, and I discovered that I could run workshops as my own office and be involved in the design of the projects. My argument is that working with me, the students gain experience in teamwork collaboration and the design of enjoyable projects. CD: How has this workshop model worked out? Have you found it rewarding? Do the students find it rewarding? EZ: Yes, my experience is that there is a re- ciprocal feeling of recompense, during and after the end of each workshop. We have had tangible results that we all were happy with, and from which we could draw prof- itable paradigms. CD: How far do you take these workshops? Are they more concept and drawing or do you take them to a technical stage? EZ: It depends on the time available, though they are never too technical. If we have only one week, they remain on a conceptual level; if we have two or more weeks, they are de- veloped accordingly, into a more tangible product, but the emphasis is usually to draw some paradigmatic conclusion. And from there we developed the idea of the emblematic image of the project. CD: Your theory of representation was part of the little pamphlet the AA produced for an OMA show in 1981. You wrote that one of the major contributions of OMA was how the work was depicted, the drawings and paintings. Do you still insist on this with your students today? EZ: I believe in the importance of so-called "paper architecture." In other words, of the project that stands for a building, where the instrumentality of the idea is more important than a building. Ever since Boullée we have had a sequence of unrealized projects that has been very important for both architec- tural theory and practice. Leonidov never had anything built, but he was a precursor of Mies van der Rohe and many other developments in later practice. I believe in the role of the archi- tect as a promoter of ideas; indeed, I enjoy this role, rather than embracing the agonies and vicissitudes of getting a building done. Plus, I realized that in our day and age, unless one manages to have the power where one's word is accepted as law (as usually happens in medi- cine), then putting a building up becomes a se- ries of compromises that I find unacceptable. I think compromise is the worst procedure with which to handle the realization of a building, even though I realize the extent to which it is exercised; and this puts me off practice. CD: So architecture for you, at this point, is more a generator of ideas? EZ: And one has to see it as a discrete and 104 Log 30</page><page sequence="37">DOGMA &amp; Elia Zenghelis, Hellenikon Metropolitan Park, Athens, 2004. Competition entry. Courtesy DOGMA. absolute entity that can neither be tampered with nor compromised. Though I don't want to appear a dictator, I have to be dogmatic if I want architecture realized, something you cannot be these days when you are dealing with contractors, subcontractors, or clients. Of course Fd love to build, but with age a certain fatigue creeps in and you want things to be more "ideal." When you are the archi- tect you want to be in control, and you want the people to whom you give instructions to carry them out. That's that. CD: Because the process of building can often strip ideas from a project, do we still have the possibility of a potent project today? Some- thing that actually might change the way we think or operate, either as architects or as a society? EZ: Not under the present political and eco- nomic conditions of neoliberalism, not when everything is so completely subjected to the dictates of the market, that higher authority that overrules. CD: In the course of your now 50 -year career, have those forces become more dramatic? EZ: Ever since Margaret Thatcher and her buddy Ronald Reagan, yes, they have. Now, of course, they have reached their universal apotheosis: first Russia joined in, and cur- rently China is leading the way. Everything is smooth now. We no longer have conflict, and the conditions of conflict are, I think, very, very useful. Cynthia Davidson is the editor of Log. 105</page></plain_text>
