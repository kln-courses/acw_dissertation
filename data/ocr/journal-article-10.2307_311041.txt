<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONVENTION AND INDIVIDUALITY IN ILIAD 1 MARK W. EDWARDS RECENT investigations into the effects on Homeric poetry of the techniques of oral composition have been accompanied by calls for a poetics of oral poetry, for some new kind of critical approach necessitated by the powerful effects of tradition and the resulting problems in identifying the poet's individual contribution.' The approach must obviously be made with an understanding of the traditional patterns of language, scene composition, and plot structure. Our knowledge of these patterns is rapidly increasing, but mlch remains to be done in applying it to appreciation of the poems. The main structure of plot in the epic is given substance and life by a number of techniques of expansion. Primary among these is the use of direct speech of the characters, expanded by various methods, one of the most important of which is the insertion of "hortatory" and "apologetic" paradeigmata.2 In the narrative parts the story is carried forward almost entirely by a succession of type-scenes, with only occasional use of short passages of description, similes, or apostrophe by the poet.3 The major means of giving dignity, color, and emotional impact to the narrative is by controlled elaboration of details of the type-scenes, by skillful selection of the amount of elaboration in a particular instance and of its nature and relevance to the situation. Fortunately the substantial size and fairly homogeneous nature of the Homeric corpus usually allow comparison of a particular instance of a type-scene with a number of other instances, so that it is simple to 1 See most recently G. S. Kirk, Homer and the Oral Tradition (Cambridge 1976) 69-85, 201-217. The question is summed up by J. B. Hainsworth, "The Criticism of an Oral Homer," JHS 90 (1970) 90-98. 2 On the reasons for the use of these paradeigmata see especially Norman Austin, "The Function of Digressions in the Iliad," GRBS 7 (1966) 295-312 (now in Essays on the Iliad, ed. John Wright [Bloomington 1978] 70-84). 3 I am not attempting to distinguish between type-scenes which have a high proportion of repeated verses and those which have the same basic pattern but little or no verbal similarity. J. A. Russo set up four categories (Arion 7 [1968] 281-294); see also T. B. L. Webster, From Mycenae to Homer (London 1958) 240-241. On the use of description see most recently T. M. Andersson, Early Epic Scenery (Ithaca 1976) 15-52.</page><page sequence="2">2 Mark W. Edwards identify special features and suggest reasons for their inclusion. Just as in the case of formulae, though it is not possible to any substantial extent to compare Homer with his contemporaries and predecessors, it is fairly satisfactory to compare him with himself.4 The elaboration is not added automatically or mechanically. A common scene such as the arming of a hero may range from half a verse (II. 9.596b) to many pages (if the decorating of Achilles' armor is included), and even in such a ritualized procedure as that of sacrifice, where many verses are repeated verbatim, there are nevertheless no identical descriptions of the whole type-scene. This variety contrasts sharply with the poet's habit of repeating passages of considerable length without change when a message is entrusted to a messenger and later delivered by him. Even more important and interesting than the amount of elaboration used is its nature. Whitman pointed out that the preparations for Achilles' libation and prayer to Zeus before Patroclus' departure for battle (II. 16.220-229) are described in minute detail, as this is "an extremely solemn and critical moment in the plot."5 One might further stress that Achilles' prayer, though fairly long, is quite formal and has none of the personal emotional appeal found in Andromache's cry to Hector (1. 6.429-432) and in Evander's speech in Virgil's adaptation of the scene (Aen. 8.560-583). Probably the convention of the prayer type-scene was against a passionate outburst by the hero here, and certainly the use of a physical action as a means of expressing and conveying emotion is characteristically Homeric; but one may suspect that the decision to involve the audience by having them watch (for ten verses) the silent, anxious Achilles sedulously unwrapping and cleansing the special chalice, rather than by having him put his love for Patroclus into words, is the result of superb artistic insight on the part of the poet. Sometimes the regular kind of elaboration for a common scene is shunned, and the scene is treated with an imagination which seems akin to that seen in the endlessly different similes. The varied and effective amount of elaboration of the standard elements of donning armor in the arming scenes of Paris, Agamemnon, Patroclus, and * Cf. M. W. Edwards, AJP 89 (1968) 282-283. An excellent attempt to compare the Homeric with the cyclic epics has been made by J. Griffin, "The Epic Cycle and the Uniqueness of Homer," JHS 97 (1977) 39-53, but little has yet been done to compare the type-scenes in Homer with those of Hesiod or the Hymns. 1 C. H. Whitman, Homer and the Heroic Tradition (Harvard 1958) 250o.</page><page sequence="3">Convention and Individuality in Iliad I 3 Achilles is too well known to need description, and it is also frequently observed that the details are suitably modified for the arming of the night expedition of Odysseus and Diomedes in Iliad io. Less often noticed are the occasions when these formal elements are abandoned entirely and the emphasis is achieved by elaboration of a different type. Before his duel with Hector, Ajax arms himself in half a line (1. 7.206b) but is then dignified by nearly twenty verses of simile, spectator reaction, and description of his great shield. Hector, who in spite of his status is never given a standard arming scene, also puts on in half a verse the armor which Patroclus wore to battle (Il. 17.194b), and there then follows the ill-omened history of the armor and the dire forebodings of Zeus. The major weight of the emphasis on Sarpedon in Iliad 12 is carried by his famous colloquy with Glaucus, but the description of his shield which immediately precedes (294-297) suggests that the whole might be considered a surrogate arming scene. In the following pages each scene in the first book of the Iliad will be considered as an example of a type-scene, whose standard elements will be identified (if this has not already been done in detail by others). The individual features of the scene will be examined and compared with those found in other instances of the same type-scene, in order to show alternative presentations of the scene which the poet adopted in other circumstances but did not choose to avail himself of here; in observing this choice one may hope to see the genius of the individual poet at work. Finally, suggestions will be made - necessarily subjec- tive - about the reasons for the amount and nature of the elaboration. Iliad I has been chosen partly because of its interesting content (especi- ally the proem and the voyage to Chryse) and partly because the existence of an excellent study of its formulae by P. Chantraine made a preliminary investigation of that aspect unnecessary.6 ' "Remarques sur l'emploi des formules dans le premier chant de l'Iliade," REG 45 (1932) 121-154. A fairly full bibliography of work on type-scenes is given in M. W. Edwards, "Type-scenes and Homeric Hospitality," TAPA Io5 (1975) 51-53. More emphasis should have been given to the work of G. M. Calhoun, whose article "Homeric Repetitions" (UCPCP 12.1 [Berkeley 1933]) appeared in the same year as Walter Arend's seminal book Die typischen Szenen bei Homer (Problemata 7, Berlin I933) and identified many type-scenes and the importance of their elaboration. As usual the importance of this approach was seen by Milman Parry (The Making of Homeric Verse, ed. Adam Parry [Oxford 1971] 446, 452-454, 456-457, 461) and carried further by A. B. Lord (The Singer of Tales [Cambridge, Mass. 1960] esp. 68-98; "Composition by Theme in Homer and Southslavic Epos," TAPA 82 [1951] 71-80). The most important recent advances have been made by B. Fenik (Typical Battle Scenes in the Iliad and Studies in the Odyssey [Hermes Einzelschr. 21 and 30], Wiesbaden 1968 and</page><page sequence="4">4 Mark W. Edwards THE PROEM (I-I2a) Even within the small compass of the proem it can be seen (but has not previously been pointed out) how some of the many standard motifs used are picked out for elaboration and others, which are elsewhere expanded, are here given in summary form. (I use "motif" for a recurrent idea which seems not to be analyzable into component parts as a type-scene is.) In the first verse, as in the Odyssey, the long hymns to Aphrodite and Hermes, the Thebaid, and the Epigoni, the Muse is summoned to tell of a specified topic, which is then amplified in the usual paratactic or cumulative style.7 The invocation of the Muse is very brief (there is a much more elaborate form at II. 2.484-494), but the topic, the minis, is expanded into three and a half verses by addition of the standard motifs of sending souls to Hades and giving men's bodies to dogs. Both these motifs occur elsewhere, but they are found together only here, and they swiftly and effectively set the tone of suffering and death (not glory) which will pervade the whole epic.8 Very brief again are the two following motifs: first "the will of Zeus was done," which is found in expanded form in the proem of the Works and Days (5-8), in II. 16.688-690 = 17.176-178, and of course in scenes of actual decision making such as 1.5I1-530; and the "what part of the tale will you choose?" motif, here in two simple (if impres- sive) lines (6-7) but given more color by a second appeal to the Muse in the corresponding place in the Odyssey (i.Io) and expanded else- where in that poem.9 The final question to the Muse, "who did it?", 1974) and M. N. Nagler, Spontaneity and Tradition (Berkeley 1974). There are good remarks on the type-scenes in Iliad I in E. A. Havelock, Preface to Plato (Cambridge, Mass. 1963) 72-84. On arming scenes, besides Arend's chapter and the well-known article by J. I. Armstrong (AJP 79 [1958] 337-354) see also P. J. Kakridis, "Achilleus' Riistung," Hermes 89 (1961) 288-297. The technique of expansion in catalogues and androktasiae is well brought out in C. R. Beye's article in HSCP 68 (1964) 345-373. 7 See Kirk (above, n. I) 78-81; M. W. Edwards, TAPA 97 (1966) 137-148; M. Parry (last note) 255-256, 308. 8 Excellent studies of the invocations of the Muse in Homer and Hesiod are given by W. W. Minton in TAPA 91 (1960) 292-309 and 93 (1962) 188-212. The minis itself is a common plot structure; see M. M. Willcock, CQ 14 (1964) 152 n.6. The "sending souls to Hades"motif recurs at Il. 5.190, 6.487, and I1.55. For the "giving bodies to the dogs" motif see J. Griffin in CQ 26 (1976) 169-173 (some 12 examples). J. Redfield's article on the proem (CP 74 [1979] 95-IIo) appeared too late to be of use in the present study. 9 H. Friinkel, Early Greek Poetry and Philosophy (trans.

II. 2.487, 11.219, 14-509, 16.113), is expanded by means of "epic regression";x1 after Apollo's name is given the poet anticipates his anger and the plague (just as he has already anticipated Achilles' anger) and then moves backward in time to Agamemnon's insult to Chryses and further to the time of the latter's arrival at the ships, at which point the forward movement of the plot begins."1 This technique, which eases the burden on the hearer and increases his anticipation by giving him an outline of the plot before the narrative begins, is also found in a number of the digres- sions in the Iliad (Phoenix's autobiography [9-447 f], the Meleager tale [9-529 f], the Niobe story [24.602 f]) but is not used in the Odyssey proem. The proem is thus made very short (especially by comparison with that of the Theogony) by the use of unusual brevity for a number of the motifs. The two which are elaborated to some degree, the menis and "who did it?" motifs, are used to stress the theme of suffering and death, rather than, for instance, the justice of Zeus, and to prepare the listener for the first episode of the story. SUPPLICATION SCENE (Izb-33) Scenes of supplication may be divided into four elements: the approach of the suppliant to the supplicandus;12 a gesture of supplication; the speech of the suppliant, including a vocative, a specific request, and an offer; and the response of the supplicandus. The pattern can be seen in simple form in three successive examples in Odyssey 22 (310-329, 330-360, 365-377). The approach of the suppliant is elaborated not by background material about the capture of his daughter and her presentation to 10 See most recently T. Krischer, Formale Konventionen der homerischen Epik (Munich 1971) 136-14o. 11 Most editors place a paragraph division between lines 7 and 8, perhaps encouraged by the postponement of the subject of the sentence to 7 and the combination of the two heroes' names in the line. But exactly the same con- struction of sentence and verse (with similar bridging of the mid-verse caesura) is found at I1. 19-47-48 and 20o.158-160 with no paragraph break following. (The same verse structure also appears at I1. 7.168, 23.838, cf. 3.314, 8.333 = 13.422). The distinction between the introduction and the start of the narrative proper would best be made after the first word of line 12, where the narrative first begins to move forward. Van Leeuwen had the courage to mark it here. Even major changes in scene often occur at places other than the verse end. 12 I hope the reader will forgive my use of this and a few other Latin terms, which are obvious in meaning and far handier to use than the English equivalents.</page><page sequence="6">6 Mark W. Edwards Agamemnon, which is left for a more leisured occasion (i.366-369), but first by an anticipatory account of his purpose; he comes to ransom his daughter and he brings gifts, that is, he is behaving with due propriety on such an occasion. The gifts are, however, not enumerated, as they are, for example, in the ransoming of Hector (1. 24.229-237), as this would slow down the poet's rapid movement here. He does find space for a second elaboration, again highly relevant and effective; the suppliant bears the staff and insignia of Apollo, indicating his status and the wisdom of granting the request of one who has the god behind him. The descriptive material, as often, is not merely decorative but most significant. For comparison, one may refer to the enormous expansion preceding the supplication of Priam to Achilles in Iliad 24.142-476 (the message from Zeus, preparation of ransom, discussion with Hecuba, harnessing of wagon and chariot, prayer to Zeus, omen, meeting with Hermes, arrival in Achilles' shelter); or the Lycaon- Achilles scene, where the suppliant's approach (II. 21.64-70) is preceded by an account of his history and of Achilles' amazement at seeing him again, and further amplified by his dodging under the hero's uplifted spear. Occasionally the element is omitted entirely, as in Scamander's panic-stricken appeal to Hera (II. 21.367-368). The approach is usually followed by a gesture from the suppliant as he touches the knees or chin of the supplicandus. In the Priam-Achilles scene the old king not only clutches Achilles' knees but kisses his hands (I1. 24-478), the exceptional gesture being further emphasized by the following verse, "those dreadful, man-slaughtering hands, which had killed many of his sons," and a simile continues the effect of the tableau. In the Lycaon scene there is a different touch; Lycaon grasps Achilles' knees with one hand and with the other desperately clutches at the spear poised above him (Il. 21.71-72). Aphrodite begging Ares for the loan of his horses does not go so far as to touch his knees but kneels before him (II. 5-357), and the suppliant Hera contents herself with clinging to the hand of Sleep (II. 14.232). Dolon's first appeal to the two Greeks is accompanied only by his tears (II. 10.377), and the element is held back for use in his last vain supplication (454-455)- It is omitted entirely in Iliad 11.130, where the suppliant is standing in a chariot and it is impracticable, and its omission receives amusing emphasis when Odysseus deliberates whether to drop his modest branch in order to clasp the knees of Nausicaa (Od. 6.141 f). In the present instance it is also omitted, either for rapidity or because it is unfitting for a priest in full regalia; or better perhaps because in its place stand a few words indicating that the scene is a public assembly</page><page sequence="7">Convention and Individuality in Iliad I 7 (15). No other supplication scene takes place in such circumstances, and it is clear that the poet chooses to handle it in this way to depict as early as possible the contrast between Agamemnon's sentiments and those of the rest of the Greeks. "Homer, with little prelude, leaves the stage to his men and women, all with characters of their own,"13 but the following speeches of suppliant and supplicandus are so well prepared for by the speech introductions that when Achilles recounts the events to his mother later on he can without obscurity omit the direct speech and leave the other verses unchanged (12 ~ 371, 13-16 = 372-375, 22-25 = 376- 379). The suppliant's speech contains, after the usual vocative, a wish for success and safe homecoming (18-19) before the request and offer (20); a similar wish follows the request in Priam's second supplication to Achilles (II. 24-556-557). In the latter instance it contains irony on the poet's part; here perhaps it veils a hint of trouble if the offer is not accepted. In some supplication scenes the offer is omitted if inappro- priate, as in Odysseus's appeals to Arete (Od. 7.142 f) and Circe (lo.481 f), and in the very odd scene where Nestor supplicates the whole army (Il. I5.660 f). The response of the supplicandus is preceded by the reaction of the other Greeks (22-23), enabling the poet to condemn Agamemnon's conduct even more by means of the familiar "all the others.. . but not.. ." motif. The army's sentiments are expressed briefly and explicitly; much more elaborate versions of their feelings in other circumstances can be found in several places in the more leisurely Iliad 2 (142-149, 270-277, 333-335, 394-397). Agamemnon's reply in- corporates in a few verses a large number of brutal aspects; Bassett has put it most strongly: "The 'good' man reveals the following qualities: (i) lack of aid6s, both for age and for the sacred fillets of Apollo; (2) utter repudiation of the unanimous will of the assembly (22-23); (3) lack of royal dignity, and needless discourtesy to an humble suppliant who has been courteous and gentle (26-28, 32, 18 f); (4) disregard of the interests of the army and the expedition in ignoring the harm that a grossly insulted Olympian might do (28), and (5)... in saying that 18 Aristotle, Poetics 146oa9, quoted by E. T. Owen, The Story of the Iliad (Toronto 1946) 4. Calhoun (above, n.6) 2o n.6I sees effect in the abrupt inter- ruption of the verbatim repetition at 379, but this seems to me to go too far. G. Highet, "Speech and Narrative in the Aeneid," HSCP 78 (1974) 216-217 comments briefly on some Homeric exairiples; a full treatment of speech introductions in Homer is given in M. W. Edwards' article in HSCP 74 (1970) 1-36.</page><page sequence="8">8 Mark W. Edwards Chryseis will share his couch in Argos he gives Clytemnestra some justification for her own infidelity."14 In this brief scene the poet has thus expanded the approach element with very relevant elaboration; omitted the gesture, replacing it by the much more important participation of the whole army; and reinforced the words of each speaker by an anticipatory introduction. In Agamem- non's few words he not only sets himself against the will of the army but also characterizes himself in most vivid fashion. PRAYER SCENE (34-43) Prayer scenes have been analyzed by L. C. Muellner15 into three elements, which are (in brief): the invocation of the deity; the claim to favor on the basis of favors in past or future; and a specific request for favor in return, with implied or explicit reference to the deity's sphere of action. A final element may be added, the deity's response16 and two elements preceding Muellner's: the setting of the scene and a gesture of the precator. A simple form of the type-scene may be seen at II. 15-370-378 (Nestor's prayer to Zeus). In the present instance, the first element (the setting) is lightly but effectively expanded by the mention of the seashore, an indication of course not of topographical precision but of the connotations of desola- tion and misery which the motif usually carries.1? The gesture is omitted, perhaps because the poet is still moving the action swiftly - Muellner comments on the "fierce conciseness" of the priest's prayer. The invocation is not a standard list of titles (as in Achilles' prayer to Zeus, II. 16.233-235) but is used specifically to characterize the local priest of the regional Apollo. The claim to favor and the request are simple, and the god indicates his favorable response by immediately coming down to earth.18 14 TAPA 65 (1934) 48-49. His last point is overstated, but cf. Laertes' respect for his wife's feelings about a concubine (Od. 1.430-433). See also Griffin (above, n. 8) 164 and J. T. Kakridis, Homer Revisited (Lund 1971) 130-131. 15 The Meaning of Homeric EUXOMAI through Its Formulas (Innsbrucker Beitrige zur Sprachwissenschaft 13 [Innsbruck 1976]) 27-28. 16 Muellner (last note) 18. 17 Cf., for example, II. 1.327, 350, 23-59, 24.12, Od. 2.260, 13.220. Is it fanciful to see a similar pathetic fallacy in the long list of significant Nereid names at II. 18.39-48? 18 I am grateful to the anonymous reader for pointing out the significance of the titles in the invocation. Muellner (above, n.15) 22 suggests that the phrase used in line 43, T70o ' KAvUE . . in itself implies only that the deity heard, not necessarily that he assented.</page><page sequence="9">Convention and Individuality in Iliad I 9 In other examples of this type-scene the preparations are sometimes much elaborated, as in Achilles' prayer to Zeus at Patroclus' departure, in Hecuba's to Athena (II. 6.269-311, including the brilliant symbol of the ill-omened robe which Paris brought back together with Helen), and in Priam's prayer to Zeus (1. 24.283-307). The gesture of raising the arms is often mentioned, usually in the phrase XE;pag &amp;vacaXdv;19 if appropriate, they may be stretched out toward the sea (Achilles to Thetis, II. 1.351; Polyphemus to Poseidon, Od. 9-527). The claim to favor is often amplified by adding a further element, the promise of hecatombs after the request has been granted (II. 10.292, etc.). The present scene is thus simple and unadorned, except for the gray coloring of loss conveyed by the sea. This suffering, and his power to call down the god, are the only characteristics the poet need give to Chryses; more would only detract from more important characters and issues. DIVINE VISITATION (44-53) The intervention of a deity in human affairs is often preceded by a description of the journey from Olympus to earth; the numerous examples are collected by Calhoun20 and show a good deal of range in extent of elaboration. An expanded example may be seen in the visit of Hermes to Calypso (Od. 5.28-75), the elements of which consist of dispatch by another deity, preparations for the journey (donning of sandals, or sometimes the harnessing of a chariot [II. 5-711 f, etc.]), description of the route, a simile (here stressing speed and distance, but often menace), and the arrival beside the person sought.21 19 This phrase is restricted to prayers, with the exception of the preliminaries to the Odysseus-Irus fight in Od. 18.89; so too are the forms of XElpas aElparL. In suppliant scenes Xpag dpEryvv; (and other forms) is used (II. 22.37, 24.506, Od. I2.257, 17.366), as it is when the gesture is toward the sea (and exceptionally at II. 15.37I). The forms of XEpE rIEr&amp;daaas seem to have no association with supplication or prayer. 20 Above, n.6, 15 n.46. 21 The variety and pertinence of the similes in divine journeys have been studied by Krischer (above, n.io) 19-23; see also W. C. Scott, The Oral Nature of the Homeric Simile (Mnemosyne Supp. 28, Leiden 1974) I5-20. Of special interest are: Thetis' journey in II. 18.615-19.3, which is interrupted for the arrival of dawn (and the start of a new book?); Poseidon's highly elaborated journey in II. 13-17-38, which is followed by a very short form in 44; and the places where Iris descends without mention of her dispatcher or the message she has been given (I1. 2.786 f, 3.121 f, 23.197 f).</page><page sequence="10">10 Mark W. Edwards The descent of Apollo here is based on the usual elements but has several distinctive features. The introductory verse (44) is modeled on the standard verse fl7 U Ka-r' O TAv'Xo;Loo Kap-JVWv &amp;teaga, which occurs five times in the Iliad and twice in the Odyssey. But the last section of this verse, the participle after the C caesura, cannot simply be changed to the masculine form for a male deity. The poet could have avoided the difficulty by using a different standard verse, concluding with a simile, as for Apollo's descent in II. I5.237 fl 8 Ka-'" "I&amp;aIv dp~V Cp7K L EOLKWS, or by introducing a short simile at the end of the present verse, such as 7j)i7' dto')IA7 or VVK7 EOLKCVS. Instead, he substitutes the phrase XWoEIEVO~ K p, conveying the god's furious reaction and fore- shadowing the trouble to come. Then in place of the preparations for the journey there follows a description of the god's appearance and the sinister clatter of his characteristic bow and arrows as he moves. The description suggests the picture of a hunter on the mountains, but it is more than decoration and anthropomorphism; it is a frightening fore- shadowing of the god's power and his menacing intentions against the Greeks. The technique is not unlike that in which the line between a metamorphosis of a deity and a simile describing a deity is not clearly drawn, the best example of which is the " meteoric " flight of Athena in II. 4-75-85, which actually terrifies the beholders as a "real" meteor would do.22 At last there comes the simile, VVK7'r EOLKCOS, effectively vague in meaning but clearly conveying speed, suddenness, silence, and danger, and now sharply differentiating the god from any mere human hunter.23 The final arrival element takes the form of the description of his action, like a hunter again, as he crouches and looses his arrows from the twanging silver bow, in a line (49) which again suggests both sound and sight. At the end of the scene there is a further touch of description. If this passage is compared with Achilles' account of the events to his mother later on, one notices that he tells of the priest's supplication in words identical with those previously used (omitting the direct speech) and 22 Also effectively ambiguous are the cases of Thetis rising from the sea like a mist (II. 1.359) and Athena shimmering like the dismal portent of a rainbow (II. 17.547-551, noticed by Fenik [Battle scenes, above, n.6] 182-183). Usually it is clear whether the deity is like a bird in speed (II. 15.237-238) or has taken the form of a bird (Od. 5.337, 353, 3.372, 22.240), but II. 13.62-72 and Od. 1.320o are ambiguous. 28 This simile is also used for the terrible shade of Heracles (also an archer) at Od. i .6o6, and for the terrifying impact of Hector as he bursts through the gates of the Greek wall (II. I2.463). Night is often sinister and destructive (II. I6.567).</page><page sequence="11">Convention and Individuality in Iliad I 11 goes on to describe Apollo's launching of the arrows and their deadly effect in straightforward terms: )KE 8 ET L2PYELOLL KaKOV PEA SAo o't O 'v Aao% OvOr7KOV ErTarUUTEpOL, T-r E87T" X70 K7-qAa OEOEo lrTav'v7 cv&amp; arpa-rov pEVpVV AXaLt6v (382-384)- But here the poet passes over the immediate effect of the arrows and composes a magnificent line which first imitates the sound of the shot and then describes the wide panorama of pyres burning day after day over the plain: flAA'- aLEL SE '7VpaL VEKVWY KalovKro OatzlaL (52).24 After this tour de force the return of the deity to Olympus, usually found at the end of this type-scene, is naturally omitted. The whole passage has thus avoided purely decorative ideas such as the donning of sandals and has also bypassed the possibility of having Apollo interview Calchas and hear the tale of his wrongs from him before going into action. Instead, the poet has composed a short scene with powerful and imaginative effects of sight and sound, concluding with a picture as vivid as that of a good modern film. SUMMONING AN ASSEMBLY (54-56) The scene is linked to the preceding one by the familiar "for nine days ... then on the tenth" motif, found five times in each poem. The examples of the summoning of an assembly have been examined by Arend and others.25 Here there is little elaboration, as the poet is still moving swiftly; the two lines (55-56) are however of some significance, as they assign the initiative to Achilles, presumably to change the focus from Agamemnon to him and prepare for his leading role in the debate. They also involve the goddess Hera, who will play a large part in the rest of the epic. The longest example of the summoning of an assembly is in II. 2.50- Io09, which is expanded by the insertion of a meeting of the chiefs, a 24 The onomatopoeic effect of flAA' is likely to be intentional, in view of PE'Aos in the previous verse and the repeated use of these syllables in the very noisy passage at II. i6.ioz-io8. 25 Arend (above, n.6) Ix6-I2x; Lord, Singer (above, n.6) 146-147; Nagler (above, n.6) 119-130.</page><page sequence="12">I2 Mark W. Edwards simile, a personification of Rumor, the activity of the heralds, and the long account of the pedigree of the speaker's staff. Of lesser extent, but offering an interesting comparison to the present instance, is the assembly summoned by Achilles in II. 19-40-55, where the tense circumstances lead the poet to build up his climax with the gathering of the crews of the ships, the stewards, and the wounded chiefs, ending with Agamemnon himself. Appropriate kinds of elaboration are used for the battlefield assembly of the Trojans (II. 8.489-496: topographical description and account of the spear Hector holds instead of a staff); for the assembly of Ithacans (Od. 2.6-24: description of Telemachus and the aged Aegyptius, who will open the debate); and for the Phaea- cian assembly (Od. 8.4-25: Athena's participation, and description of Odysseus). ASSEMBLY SCENE (57-305a) As usual, the person who summons the assembly addresses it first, though there are some exceptions.26 The speeches in the assembly have been intensively studied by D. Lohmann,27 and most of them need not be considered here. Examples of certain type-scenes do, however, occur during the assembly and must be considered separately. PONDERING SCENE (188-194a) At one point in the assembly the dialogue is interrupted by action, as Achilles ponders whether to kill Agamemnon, half draws his sword, and is dissuaded by Athena. The scene follows the usual pattern of pondering scenes, which have been analyzed by Arend and others, and 26 At II. 2.225, I8.254, Od. 2.25. From the political point of view it is interest- ing that there is no set formula of address to the assembly. Most speakers address Agamemnon or another speaker; Chryses (I.I7) addresses Atreidae and Greeks in a formula repeated only by Achilles at the funeral games (23.272 and 658, with singular Atreide); Agamemnon himself uses another formula (2.110o, 19.78), which also occurs in battle scenes. At 7.327 and 385 what seems to be an assembly is addressed by a formula designating only the chiefs (used also at 23.236); what is definitely an assembly is addressed by Agamemnon by a formula designating only the chiefs at 9.17, and it is tempting to alter the text - the following eight verses are identical with 2. 1-- i8, and 9.17 should probably be replaced by 2.110o. 27 Die Komposition der Reden in der Ilias (Berlin 1970); see also W. Schadewaldt, Iliasstudien (Leipzig 1938) 144-145.</page><page sequence="13">Convention and Individuality in Iliad I 13 as usual there are two stated alternatives of which the hero will even- tually choose the second.28 Here the internal dilemma of Achilles is stressed by two external descriptions; first, his heart is doing the thinking "within his hairy chest" (I89);29 and then his indecision is vividly externalized by his half drawing his sword, which will remain in that state, as a symbol of the dangerously poised situation, during the following conversation with Athena.30 This way of visually presenting a mind torn two ways is only surpassed at the beginning of Odyssey 2zo, where the hero tosses and turns like a blood sausage on a spit. DIVINE VISITATION (194b-222) As usual in the Iliad, the hero's perplexity is dissolved by the visit of a deity (on the type-scene, see on lines 44-53 above). Achilles is drawing his sword; jAKETO 8' EK KOAEOZO Eya ~O 0OS &amp;pyUvpO-qAlo would have been natural. But the crisis is acute, and Athena loses no time - not only does she dispense with sandals, similes, and so on, but she brusquely shoves aside the patient old epithet and bursts into the verse at the C caesura; and the verse actually concludes AO6E S' jO-v-r. . . The effect on an audience must have been striking.31 Exactly 28 Arend (above, n.6) io6-ii5; Russo (above, n.3) has pointed out some differences between the pondering scenes in the Iliad and those in the Odyssey. The pondering monologues studied by B. Fenik, Homer: Tradition and Invention (Leiden 1978) 68-90, are of a different type from the present example. 29 This is the only instance of i-rop (for the usual Kaz-a qpEva KaL KaT-a OvUo'dV) in a pondering scene (Arend i i). 30 F. M. Combellack (CP 36 [I941] 60-63) suggests that when Athena pulls his hair Achilles takes his hand off the hilt of the sword, which remains half drawn; then in 219 he places his hand on the hilt again and thrusts it back into its sheath. This seems the best interpretation. Friinkel (above, n.9) seems to suggest the whole episode is almost instantaneous ("All this takes place after Achilles has already begun to draw his sword and before he thrusts it back into its scabbard, that is to say, in a brief moment" [69]), which is hard to accept; human time stops for scenes between gods, as at II. 20.291-32o, but in this case a man is involved. Of course there is no problem about what the rest of the army is thinking during the exchange between the hero and the invisible goddess: " It is a regular feature of the narrative technique in the Iliad that when a god enters into conversation with a mortal the bystanders are forgotten" (Fenik, Battle scenes [above, n.6] 75; see also 37). 31 eoo &amp;apyvpdqAov is found in this position seven times in the Iliad and four in the Odyssey. The epithet is dropped in the same way in II. 1.220, probably under the influence of the present line (cf. the phrase clusters identified by J. B. Hainsworth, Festschr. L. R. Palmer [Innsbruck 1976] 83-86), and in II. 11.29, where two verses of elaboration of the JAot are substituted. M. W. Edwards</page><page sequence="14">14 Mark W. Edwards the same technique is used for Athena's appearance to Diomedes in II. 10.507, where the usual verse os 0 0- CV00' dOPW"PLMVE Ka7dE pEV KC Kal KaT- Ovltdv (11. 1.193) is truncated by the omission of the last phrase and the insertion of -rdpa 8' 'tAOrVf...32 That this substitution of a new ending in place of a traditional epithet is intended to be artistically effective is suggested by the example at II. 6.473, where the normal rrovAvfoor'Epfl after XOovl is dropped in favor of the vivid apr~xvo'dwaav, which both draws attention to the bright glitter of the helmet against the ground and also beautifully reinforces and explains the fright of Hector's infant son.33 So Athena arrives. The element of dispatch by another deity is inserted (i95-I96), she stands behind Achilles, and before the expected address to the person visited she takes him by the hair, an action which may have amazed Homer's audience as much as it did the hero. No- where else does a visiting deity take a comparable liberty in attracting a hero's attention, but Athena has no time to spare, and once again the poet uses a physical action to illustrate powerful emotion. The astonished Achilles whirls around --three finite verbs in verse 9934 - and speaks to her. This again is exceptional; in the overwhelming majority of cases where a deity comes down to address a mortal the deity begins the conversation. (The only cases where this does not occur are when the deity appears in the form of a guest, who must first be greeted by the host [Od. I.I22, 5.86], or as a child or youth, who is naturally addressed first by the older person [Od. 7.21, 13.227].) His words are aggressive; characteristically, he disguises his understanding of the other's purpose, as he does with Patroclus at the beginning of Iliad 16, and launches his complaint against Agamemnon. Athena makes her has collected (TAPA 97 [1966] 167-175, esp. 172-174) a number of examples where a regular ornamental epithet following the C caesura has been omitted in favor of beginning a new sentence. 32 It should be said that there are four other cases where this final phrase is dropped without any special effect. The whole expression KaTm cpe'va Kat KcT' OvLd6v occurs ten times in the Iliad and eleven in the Odyssey. Russo (above, n.3) 292 drew attention to the quick appearance of Athena in Od. 20.3o, but there the effect is less striking as it occurs at the mid-verse caesura and does not usurp the place of an expected line ending. -- The usual combination is found twelve times in the Iliad and three in the Odyssey. This kind of substitution is not covered in Edwards' examples (see n.31). 34 Od. 15.222 has something of the same effect. These verses are different from those which contain three standard progressive action verbs, such as II. 1.459, Od. 12.359 (mentioned by Muellner, [above, n.151 32).</page><page sequence="15">Convention and Individuality in Iliad I 15 suggestion, Achilles assents briefly (as in his similarly reluctant response to Thetis in Iliad 24.139-140, and his one-line speech to Hector at 20.429), and to complete the physical illustration of his decision he thrusts his sword back into its sheath. The visitation pattern is con- cluded by the return of Athena to Olympus. The scene is thus given unusual power by the physical actions which accompany it: the abrupt appearance of Athena, her action, and Achilles' own rapidity in accosting the goddess. MEDIATION SCENE (247-304) There is a further physical counterpart to emotional stress as Achilles disgustedly dashes to the ground the staff which represents the justice of government under Zeus (245-246; cf. 237-239); the motif is used again to demonstrate Telemachus' resentment at his powerlessness in Od. 2.8o0.5 Then Nestor arises as mediator. This may be considered a type-scene - admittedly an almost inevitable one in any kind of dispute --as there are several parallels in the Iliad. Here Nestor addresses both parties and is answered by them in turn (in speeches containing a careful verbal parallel, 288-289 and 295-296); at the end of the book Hephaestus (573 f) addresses only Hera but indirectly urges Zeus to be gracious; at Iliad 24.65 f Zeus addresses only Hera but acknowledges the force of both viewpoints; and at 23.492 f Achilles gives a mild reprimand to Ajax and Idomeneus jointly. The present example is amplified by the ceremonious introduction of Nestor (247- 252) and the "apologetic" paradeigma which asserts his right to speak and to be listened to (260-274).36 DISMISSAL OF THE ASSEMBLY (305b-307) S. E. Bassett examined these scenes and showed that there is no formal adjournment.37 Sometimes the reaction to the last speaker is elaborated to lead into the breakup of the assembly, as at II. 2.142-150 and 394-398 (with a simile in each case). Here the poet takes care to *" See F. M. Combellack, CJ 43 (1947-8) 209-217. I suspect that the idea of 234-237, "By this staff, which will never bear leaf again ... ," conceals the idea "only when this staff bears leaf again [will I help you again] ", which is like the when-this-iron-floats practice in making treaties in ancient Greece (Aristotle, Ath. Pol. 23.5, Herodotus 1.165) and may have been a standard motif. 36 See n.2 above. "7 CC Dismissing the Assembly in Homer," CJ 26 (193o-31) 458-460.</page><page sequence="16">16 Mark W. Edwards mention the departure of Achilles to his shelter, as a preparation for his reception of Agamemnon's heralds; and he takes the opportunity to mention Patroclus, as he does in 345, in order to introduce him into the story at an early stage. DEPARTURE BY SHIP (308-312) Concurrently with the departure of Achilles and Patroclus Agamem- non dispatches a ship to return Chryseis. The scene is given a moderate amount of elaboration. It will be discussed below, together with verses 477-483- PURIFICATION AND SACRIFICE (313-318a) No other account of a purification of this kind survives; it may or may not have been standard. The sacrifice is told with minimal detail, because a much fuller version will be given of the sacrifice at Chryse; see below, on verses 447b-474- MESSENGER AND GUEST SCENES (318b-348a) The type-scene of dispatch of a messenger was included in Arend's work, so details need not be repeated here.38 In this example the order to the messengers is as usual given in direct speech, perhaps with some brusqueness as the vocative is omitted.39 Agamemnon's words include the threat that if the woman is not given up he will go in person to take her, which represents a slight backing down on his previous statement that he would go himself (185).40 The poet wants to retain the possibility of a direct confrontation between him and Achilles, but of course will not bring it about as the outcome could only be anticlimactic. The reluctant journey of the heralds is slightly elaborated by a mention of the desolate sea. They arrive as messengers, who would 38 Arend (above, n.6) 54-61; see also Edwards (above, n.6) 62-67. 39 This was suggested by Bassett (AJP 55 [1934] 145), but I am not sure I would expect the vocative when the names have already been given (320) and the narrative is moving swiftly. 40 Both G. S. Kirk (Songs of Homer [Cambridge 1962] 215) and G. P. Goold (Illinois Class. Studies 2 [19771 33) think the words of Achilles (II. 1.356, 507, 2.240, 9.IO7, 273, I9.89) imply an earlier version in which Agamemnon went himself to take the woman; contra (among others) F. M. Combellack, Gnomon 28 (1956) 414 n. I. I do not see why the later references by Achilles are not sufficiently justified by Agamemnon's words at II. 1.185 and 324-325.</page><page sequence="17">Convention and Individuality in Iliad I 17 normally enter the house, go up to the destined recipient, and deliver their message. These heralds, however, have no message to deliver, for Agamemnon did not deign to give them words to repeat to Achilles (probably a discourtesy). So they stand silent, and with this the pattern switches (as it also does in the embassy scene in Iliad 9) to that of the reception of a guest; for a guest normally stands in silence at the door until observed and invited to enter.41 Achilles sees them, not with surprise, as a host does (e.g., II. I1.645, 777), but with displeasure (330); the type-scene element is present but changed in nature. As guests he welcomes them ("XalperE" [334]), gives them their titles, and invites them to approach ("&amp;crrov '" [335]). With the same courtesy, startlingly different from Agamemnon's behavior, he hands over the woman and they depart. The change from messenger scene to guest reception intensifies the restraint and politeness of Achilles, just as in Book 9 it sharpens the difficult role of the envoys as both mouthpieces of Agamemnon and friends of Achilles. PRAYER, DIVINE VISITATION, AND SUPPLICATION SCENES (348b-43oa) The following episode is a skillful meshing of these three type-scenes. It is expanded by means of a long recapitulation of the past and a considerable amplification of the request of the precator. First the seashore motif is repeated in enlarged form (349-350), not only to express Achilles' loneliness and sorrow but also to prepare for his mother's emergence from the waters. The gesture element of the prayer scene is present (351), a minimal invocation (T47rEP 352), and the claim to favor, here taking the unusual form - though it is a re- current motif in other circumstances - of the shortness of the hero's life.42 The prayer is however incomplete, as there is no specific request. This is because before that point in the prayer is reached the poet interrupts it to bring on Thetis, in a brief divine visitation scene (357- 41 See Edwards (above, n.6) on the effect of this in II. 9.192-193. C. Segal (GRBS 9 [1968] IOI-I14) and Lohmann (above, n.27) 227-231 stress heavily the correspondences between the heralds in Book I and the embassy in Book 9; some of these are inevitably due to the pattern of the type-scene, but if Edwards' idea that there is a change of type-scene in each case is valid the likelihood of an intentional parallel between the two scenes becomes even stronger. Calhoun (above, n.6) 7-8 lists other examples of a character realizing something without explicit mention of it. 42 Griffin (above, n.8) 177-178 shows the importance of this motif both for Achilles and for Hector. It is naturally often associated with Thetis.</page><page sequence="18">I8 Mark W. Edwards 360). The poet again refers to the sea from which she comes, and she sits beside her son and inquires about his grief, as in a number of other examples.43 In answer Achilles not only recapitulates the story from the beginning of the Iliad but also gives a short account of the capture of Chryseis, which the poet's convention may have prevented him from bringing into the narrative.44 (The tale of Briseis' capture and Achilles' killing of her husband will not be brought in until it is given great impact in II. 19.282 f.) This part of his speech covers 26 verses, a number of them repeated from earlier in the book. The length of the account may be intended to emphasize Achilles' hurt once again before his virtual disappearance from the stage for so many books; and of course it is also good psychology for a man in his sorrowful state to pour out his woes at great length to his loving mother's ear. After the tale is done, the prayer scene is resumed with the specific request which has been postponed from his previous speech, that she will go to Zeus (393-412). The request takes the form of an outline of the elements of the supplication scene he wishes her to enact. First he describes the approach to the supplicandus (394), then the offer; the latter takes the form of a claim to favor (since both parties are gods) and is amplified by a tale of her assistance to him, which may well have been invented by the poet for the occasion (394-4o6).45 After this account the approach element is repeated (407, as with the ring form that so often encloses a paradeigma), this time with the addition of the gesture (taking his knees), and the specific request that the suppliant is to make of Zeus (408-412). The prayer scene is concluded with Thetis' assent, after a characteris- tic lament continuing the motif of Achilles' early death (414-418); and she explains that there will have to be a delay, for a reason which will be discussed below. The whole episode is completed with the final element in the divine visitation type-scene, the return of Thetis, 43 On the simile (359) see above, n.22, and Kakridis (above, n.14) 104-105. For the deity's question, cf. Thetis in the intentionally similar scene at the beginning of II. I8, where Achilles' violent outburst of grief takes the place of a prayer, and Athena's visit to the sleepless Odysseus in Od. 20o.33 f. Krischer has pointed out the similarity of this scene to that in Sappho's ode to Aphrodite (Hermes 96 [1968] 1-14). Fenik (Battle Scenes, above, n.6) 76-77 notes other examples where the deity asks what the problem is, although (as Achilles remarks here) she already knows the answer. 44 So Krischer (above, n.io) 93-94. 45 See M. M. Willcock, CQ I4 (1964) 141-154, esp. 143-144, and B. K. Braswell, CQ 21 (I971) I6-26, esp. I8-I9. On the whole idea of the poet's free invention, Willcock, HSCP 8i (I977) 41-53-</page><page sequence="19">Convention and Individuality in Iliad I 19 elaborated by an allusion to the still sorrowing Achilles whom she leaves behind (429-430). Analysis of this episode as a combination of three type-scenes accounts for the absence of a request from Achilles' first prayer (called substandard by Muellner46); and the presence of most of the elements of all three scenes, neatly woven together, indicates the cohesion of the idea of the type-scene in the poet's mind. THE VOYAGE TO CHRYSE (43ob-487): ANALYSIS Because of the high proportion of its verses which occur elsewhere, especially in the Odyssey, the voyage to Chryse has often been con- temptuously dismissed from the Iliad as a cento by some "late" rhapsode.47 The true reason for the recurrent verses is that the episode is composed of a series of regular type-scenes, all with a high ratio of standardized verses, together with the prayer of Chryses, which also naturally includes verses repeated from elsewhere. The type-scenes are: arrival by ship (430-439); handing over a gift (44o-447a); sacrifice, meal, and entertainment (447b-474); retiring for the night (475-476); departure and journey by ship (477-483); and arrival by ship (484-487). The extent and nature of elaboration in each of these will first be examined, and then the importance of the episode as a whole will be explained. ARRIVAL BY SHIP (43ob-439 AND 484-487) This type-scene is thoroughly analyzed by Arend.4s The first of the two versions here is the fullest of all; of the thirteen elements which Arend identifies it includes ten, and of those omitted two are obviously not applicable in the case of an overnight stay (beaching and propping up the ship) and the third (description of the harbor) is an amplification which is found only on the occasion of Odysseus' landing on Ithaca 48 Above, n.15, 23. 47 Even by P. Chantraine, whose article (above, n.6) otherwise shows an exceptionally clear understanding of formulae for its date and is still most useful; he gives a full listing of the episode's repeated verses (148-149 and 15I). Schadewaldt saw its value for the balance of the book (above, n.27, 145-146). Arguments for considering the episode a late insertion are most recently given by G. P. Goold (above, n.40) 33. 48 Above, n.6, 79-81. In what follows I modify his framework by omitting his first element (the fixing of the time) and dividing into two elements the lowering of the sails and stowage of the mast.</page><page sequence="20">20 Mark W. Edwards (Od. 13.96-113). By contrast, the instance at the end of the episode (484-487) includes only one verse for the arrival and one each for beaching the ship and propping it up for a long stay, the elements which were omitted at Chryse; Arend well suggests that the reason is the poet's dislike for repeating similar elements within too short a space.49 Of the nine verses of the longer scene four occur in identical form elsewhere, three of them in Telemachus' landing in Ithaca in Od. I5-485 f, which is the next most detailed version. Besides those of the Chryse episode there are only six examples of a landing where the mechanics are gone through in detail; in many of the frequent landings in the Odyssey the formal details are passed over and instead a full description is given of some specific relevant item such as an account of the country. This variation in technique recalls that used for the arming-scenes of Ajax and Hector. The poet is thus using the fullest appropriate means of expanding the arrival of the ship. HANDING OVER A GIFT (440-447a) Next Odysseus restores Chryseis to her father. The closest parallels identify this scene as one based on the bestowal of gifts, for example Achilles' courteous presentation of the jar to Nestor at the funeral games (II. 23.616-650) and Helen's gift to the departing Telemachus (Od. 15.123-130). Chryseis is now to be restored without ransom, as Calchas bade (99), and so Odysseus plays the part of a donor. The usual pattern of a gift-giving scene is: the approach of the donor; the handing over of the gift; a short speech by the donor; and the pleased acceptance by the recipient, usually without a speech (though Nestor as usual has a few suitable remarks, 11. 23.626-650). In three cases the same verse is repeated for the receipt of the gift (II. 1.446 = 23.624 = Od. 15.130), with in the present case the addition of an object noun and adjective in the following verse.50 SACRIFICE, MEAL, AND ENTERTAINMENT (447b-474) It is not surprising that the most detailed of all the type-scenes in Arend's study is that of a sacrifice, since it describes a complex religious ritual.51 Of the twenty-one elements into which Arend divided sacrifice 49 Above, n.6, 79. 50 Note that this repeated verse is not used at I1. 1.596, where the sense is the same but the type-scene is that of a greeting, not a gift-giving. 51 Arend (above, n.6) 64-78; see also David M. Gunn, "Thematic Composi- tion and Homeric Authorship," HSCP 75 (1971) 1-31, esp. 22-31.</page><page sequence="21">Convention and Individuality in Iliad I z2 and feast scenes (some of which might well be subdivided) this scene contains eighteen; the only ones not included are the offering of hairs plucked from the beast, its actual slaughter, and the cry of womenfolk (which would be impossible here). A close parallel to the present example is the sacrifice in 11. 2.402 f, which also omits these three elements and the hand-washing as well (here in 449), but is expanded by the insertion of the summoning of the chiefs. Only one example is longer than this, Nestor's magnificent extravaganza for the eyes of young Telemachus in Od. 3-418-476, which adds the preliminaries of catching the cow and gilding its horns, includes the only occurrence of the cry of womenfolk, and also shares only with Eumaeus' pig sacrifice (Od. 14.4I3 f) the plucking of the hairs of the beast and its actual slaughter. In this example, however, Nestor's prayer is un- characteristically short (445-446), because it has been anticipated in lines 380-384 and the repetition of the element at length would be undesirable. Chryses' prayer begins with the same two verses of invocation as his earlier call to Apollo and includes three further verses which are similar to or identical with those of Achilles' prayer to Zeus in II. 16 (1.453 _ 16.236, 1.454-455 = 16.237-238). The fullness in the de- scription of the sacrifice and feast, combined with the repetitions in the prayer, mean that of the 23 verses of the sacrifice and meal (447-469) all but four (447-449 and 456) are found elsewhere. It must be noted however that there is no verbatim parallel to the whole scene, and as Chantraine wrote, " Mme pour un motif aussi banal que cette descrip- tion de sacrifice, on observe un jeu de formules traditionnelles, non une repetition m6canique." 52 A feast scene normally concludes with entertainment in the form of conversation (e.g. II. 2-433 f, 7-324 f). Here this would be inappropriate, and the poet substitutes further drinking and the singing of a paean to Apollo (47o-474), which also signifies his assent to Chryses' prayer.53 52 Above, n.6, I27. 53 Chantraine's objection to line 471 (above, n.6, 152) on the grounds that it places the libation after the drinking, is not valid, as this libation does not belong to the regular type-scene of feasting and is actually the prelude to the paean to Apollo. The verses parallel to 470-471 in other scenes similarly serve not as part of a feast but as prelude to another action; the examples are: II. 9.175-I76, before the departure of the embassy; Od. 3.339-340, after the conversation which follows Nestor's sacrifice and before the retiring for the night; Od. 21.271-272, following the vain efforts of the suitors with the bow and preceding its delivery to Odysseus. In Od. 1.148 (= II. 1.470) the verse is used as part of the suitors' meal, but the circumstances are unusual in that another</page><page sequence="22">22 Mark W. Edwards The element is thus turned to good effect. Even more powerful is the substitution after the meal of Priam and Achilles, where they gaze at each other in mutual wonder (II. 24.629-633)- RETIRING FOR THE NIGHT (475-476) This type-scene has been examined by D. M. Gunn.54 Here it is naturally treated very briefly, as we have no special interest in any of the present company. DEPARTURE AND VOYAGE OF A SHIP (477-483) Arend discusses in detail the relation between the departure of the ship here and that when it is dispatched from the Greek camp by Agamemnon (308-3 11), a passage which repeats part of Agamemnon's announcement that he will return Chryseis (141-144). The only elements used in the earlier scene are those which are important, that is, the choosing of the crew and the embarking of Chryseis and the cattle for sacrifice; there is no mention of mast, sails, or wind. But on the homeward voyage the poet uses much more elaboration, concen- trating on motifs of divine favor and joy; Apollo sends the favorable wind (479), and the wave sings against the bow as the vessel surges easily ahead. Even more detail is sometimes added; in Telemachus' sailing from Ithaca (Od. 2.417 f) besides the favoring wind there is meal description, that of Telemachus and Athena, has immediately preceded and the poet is hard put to it to avoid use of the same phrases for both in close proximity (on this see W. C. Scott, TAPA 102 [1971] 541-551). Reinhardt (Die Ilias und ihr Dichter [G6ttingen 1961] 89) drops the lines on grounds similar to Chantraine's. The only verse about which I feel doubt here is 473, which is obelized in Allen's P99 (= PSI II 113, Pack2 6o8) and contains a nominative (KODpOL XXat(Zv) oddly placed after the subject ol in the preceding verse; in the similar verse 11. 22.391 the construction is quite normal (cf. Edwards [above, n.7] 168 nn.139 and 155). There is however a similarly awkward construction in Hesiod fr. 204.46-47 MW, and II. 21.505-506 is fairly close. Removal of 473 would solve some of the problems which have led to the obelizing of 474. 54 Above, n.5I, 17-22. The lines describing sunset and sunrise (475, 477) have provided ammunition for those who think the episode is late, because 477 is found twenty times in the Odyssey and only once again in the Iliad (24.788), and 475 does not recur in identical form in the Iliad but is found six times in the Odyssey. Van der Valk points out however (AC 35 [1966] 49-50) that the Iliad contains verses which are obviously related to 475 (2.413, 11.194 = 209 = 17.455), and the absence of 477 may simply be due to a preference for a more solemn formula, e.g., at 11. 19.1-2.</page><page sequence="23">Convention and Individuality in Iliad I 23 more elaboration in raising the mast and setting the sail, and in Od. 15.290 f there is even a description of the geographical features passed on the way (295-298), perhaps because of the possibility of ambush by the suitors. The expansion here may therefore be regarded as full but not exceptionally so. The final beaching and propping up of the ship (484-487) has already been mentioned.55 THE VOYAGE TO CHRYSE: GENERAL COMMENT Many (but not all) of the type-scenes in the episode are elaborated, but not exceptionally so in extent; all are standard scenes and have a high ratio of recurrent verses, but there is as much variation in detail as there normally is between occurrences of the same type-scene, and they conform to the usual principle that identical type-scenes do not elaborate the same elements if they are in close proximity. The high proportion of recurrent verses results from the unusual conglomeration of this kind of type-scene, and the large number of verses found only here and in the Odyssey is the natural result of the frequency of sea voyages in that poem and their absence from the rest of the Iliad. These facts should therefore not be considered as evidence of "late" insertion of the episode. But why should the poet compose such a cluster of standard type- scenes here? The answer emerges if full weight and appreciation is given to the remarkable five-verse scene which immediately follows, before Thetis' journey to Olympus begins. " ABSENT BUT MUCH CONCERNED" SCENE (488-492) Achilles still sits in angry dejection by his ships, taking no part in assemblies or battle but longing all the time in his heart for the clamor and the fighting. There are a number of examples of this sudden view of a character who is not participating in the immediate action or perhaps even aware of it, but who is intimately concerned (at least in the poet's mind). Often they have a strong emotional effect. The closest parallel to the present scene is at II. 17.401-41I, where at the height of the battle over Patroclus' body Achilles is said to be still unaware of his death. Similar (if less moving) is II. 13.521-525, where 55 On the amplified version of this landing found in a Ptolemaic papyrus see Stephanie West, The Ptolemaic Papyri of Homer (Papyrologica Coloniensia III, Cologne 1967) 32-35. The Hymn to Apollo need not have been the source of the additional verses, as they may well have occurred in other epics now lost.</page><page sequence="24">24 Mark W. Edwards the death of Ascalaphus is followed by a short passage stating that Ares is unaware of his son's fall and is still sitting with the other gods on Olympus.56 Also rather similar are several passages in the Catalogue of Ships where Achilles, Protesilaus, and Philoctetes are stated not to be at the head of their troops.5' The expression in the present scene is concise but emphatic, especially the full-verse nominative phrase in 489.58 The effect of this scene is to enclose the whole Chryse episode between two passages describing Achilles' desolation (428-430 and 488-492). This accounts both for the insertion of the voyage and for its length, for when Achilles enters the story again after what seems to be a considerable length of time he is still found to be in deep despair. We are to feel that days and days of battle and assembly have been going on without him (490-49I), instead of the 24 hours or so (one night away from camp) that the poet has actually described for the return of Chryseis; and the long elaboration of each type-scene has given the impression of a considerable span of time during which Achilles' grief has endured. It is of course also for this reason that the poet has invented the twelve-day vacation of the gods, which some commenta- tors have seemed to consider a historical fact which the poet uses the Chryse voyage to fill up.59 He wants the twelve days for the moving 56 These two passages, together with II. 17.377-383, are grouped by B. Hellwig as cases where a transition is made by means of reference to a character who is not observing the previous action (Raum und Zeit im hom. Epos [Spudas- mata II, Hildesheim 1964] 91 n.94). Fenik (Battle Scenes, above, n.6) I39 draws a parallel between 11. 13.513 f and 5.503 f, which is not close to our passage, and to I. II1.57-59, 13-345-360, and 15.596-600, which are all quite similar to ours. 57 11. 2.686-694, 699-703, 721-725. 58 Bolling's strictures against this verse (The Athetized Lines of the Iliad [Baltimore 1944] 63-65) seem to me unjustified; 11. 3.328-329 (which he quotes) is a good parallel. The adjective KVSd&amp;VEpa5 is used only here to qualify &amp;dyopg (490) and elsewhere always goes with acd~x, but the idea is not unhomeric. 59 Kakridis has other (very amusing) examples of this " Wirklichkeitsfanatis- mus" in Das Altertum (Festschr. Schadewaldt, Stuttgart 1970) 51-64. The point is best seen by J. T. Sheppard (The Pattern of the Iliad [London 1922] 21 : "The second panel [i.e., the voyage] is, as usual, an interlude, which serves to make the hearer realize the long waiting of Achilles, still sitting in his hut, his anger eating at his heart") and F. M. Stawell (Homer and the Iliad [London 1909] i6: "We understand Achilles' restless longing all the better when we think of those twelve days in his hut alone"). Owen for once misses the point ("But why [Thetis' mission] should be postponed for as much as twelve days it is hard to see" [above, n.I3, io n.i]). Other suggestions are made by Calhoun (above, n.6) 17, Reinhardt (above, n.53) 95, and Schadewaldt (above, n.27) 146.</page><page sequence="25">Convention and Individuality in Iliad i 25 picture of the long isolation of the hero, and just as in the text the voyage extends from Thetis' departure from Achilles to her journey to Olympus (after another view of him), so the details of the voyage seem to spread over the twelve interminable days of his waiting. SUPPLICATION SCENE (493-532) This begins normally with the approach of the suppliant to the supplicandus (495-499)- Her gesture includes both embracing his knees and raising her hand to his chin- but Athena's remark that she kissed his knees is just malicious exaggeration (II. 8.371). There is no offer; in its place is the claim to favor element, which is placed before the request, as in a prayer scene. This inversion may be connected with the fact that the claim to favor is only hinted at, as it has been told in detail in Achilles' foreshadowing of the interview (396-4o6).60 The poet does not repeat in detail either the complaint of Achilles (though some of his verses would have fitted here61) or the words of his request for the Greek defeat. Doubtless if realism were all-important Thetis would be much more eloquent on her son's behalf, but the poet condenses the material in order to emphasize the interaction of the divinities and the prospect of Zeus' great decision, rather than going once again over the familiar facts of the case. Everyone awaits the next element, the response of the supplicandus, the decision of Zeus. It does not come, and the poet inserts a repetition of the supplication, to increase the tension even further. The nearest parallels are Hera's repeated request and increased bribe to Sleep after his first refusal (II. 14.264-269), and Iris' second attempt to persuade Poseidon to obey Zeus after his angry rejection of the order (II. 15.201- 204), but in neither case is the effect so impressive as Zeus' awful silence. Finally he answers, and his response begins in comical harass- ment; he nervously pushes Thetis away from his knees (522) and then assents, with a not very successful attempt to preserve his dignity (524-527). The poet, surely partly at least tongue-in-cheek, adds the three impressive verses which so inspired Phidias (528-530). 60 I would agree with Braswell (above, n.45) 19 n.2 against Willcock (same note) 143 that the lack of repetition of the Briareus tale here is not due to its invention; the repetition of a tale which is not part of the actual epic narrative would be very surprising. Aristotle's remark (quoted by Braswell) that the great man does not like to be reminded of favors done him by others is also very pertinent. 61 The only repeated verse in Thetis' appeal to Zeus is 507, which was used by Achilles in his first short prayer to her (356; it is repeated at II. 2.24o by Thersites).</page><page sequence="26">26 Mark W. Edwards The poet has individualized the standard scene and has carefully differentiated it from Achilles' anticipation of it (394-412), not by lengthy eloquence from the parties concerned, but by the device of inventing the silence of the supplicandus and repeating the timid request of the suppliant.62 This builds up to the humorous disparity between the mighty ruler of the universe and the henpecked husband. DIVINE ASSEMBLY SCENE (533-604) Assemblies of the gods are handled differently from those of men. Often the gods are already in session when the scene begins, and the speeches begin without further ado.63 This is the case here, except that Zeus arrives late because of his session with Thetis. Often the council is combined with a feast (as here), or the drinking may begin even before the debate (II. 4.1-4). The quarrel begins, as did the human one earlier, but of course with much more humor. MEDIATION SCENE (571-583) Amid the general embarrassment that follows Zeus' threat of violence against his wife, Hephaestus speaks up as mediator. The scene has been discussed with the earlier mediation scene above (247-304). GREETING SCENE (584-596) Hephaestus hands a cup of wine to his angry mother, with words of good cheer; his words are amplified with a short hortatory paradeigma (590-594). Hera herself behaves similarly towards Thetis at II. 24.101- 102. These scenes have been treated elsewhere.64 FEAST AND ENTERTAINMENT SCENE (597-604) This is elaborated by the tomfoolery of Hephaestus in the role of Ganymede and the song of Apollo and the Muses, which has significance 62 The repetition has a kind of negative variant of the claim to favor, " so that I may know by how much I am the least honored of divinities" (515-516), which benefits Thetis' doleful temperament. 63 As at II. 7.443, 22.166, 24.23, Od. 1.26. Once they arrive without apparent summons (Od. 5-3), once there is a very brief summons (II. 8.2), and once a very elaborate summons prepares for the great battle of the gods (II. 2zo.4-15). This last is the only instance mentioned by Arend. 64 By M. W. Edwards (above, n.6) 55, with a collection of parallels. On the paradeigma in the speech see Willcock and Braswell (above, n.45) and Lohmann (above, n.27) 80-85.</page><page sequence="27">Convention and Individuality in Iliad I 27 in portraying the god in a very different role from that which he played at the beginning of the book; nec semper arcum tendit Apollo. RETIRING FOR THE NIGHT (605-61 1) The scene is moderately elaborated by description of the homes of the gods; on such scenes see note 54 above. The last verses prepare for the "all the others.. . but not.. ." motif which will introduce the action of the following book. This technique also links Iliad 9 to 10 and 23 to 24. This is the first time that a complete book of Homer (other than the battles) has been divided into type-scenes, and the perhaps tedious analysis has, I think, resulted in a better appreciation of each scene and of the book as a whole. In all ancient poetry an understanding both of the genre and of many literary tropes is essential for evaluation, and in the case of epic the indispensable prerequisite is knowledge of the universality of type-scenes and the regular features of each one. Of course, repeated type-scenes occur in any kind of literature, just as they do in life, but it is natural to suppose that standardization of elements and the technique of treating them at greater or lesser length arose from the demands of varying circumstances on the oral singer. But I feel that Homer, as in the case of formulae, has developed a technical device into an aesthetic one. Observation of the varying amounts of elaboration, and realization of the uniqueness of much of the material used, adds much to appreciation of the detailed perfection of the poems. There is another aspect too. In the case of formulae, we have learnt not to base much interpretation on recurrence of a certain verse or sequence of verses, as they are generally used in each instance without any reference to other cases where they are employed. To a large extent this is likely to be true of type-scenes as well, and caution must be used in interpreting correspondences which may arise simply from the repetition of the same type-scene. Here too, however, the aesthetic often predominates over the merely technical, and I do not feel that it is just a type-scene tradition that makes the death of Patroclus correspond so closely with Hector's, or produces the overpowering irony of Thetis' second visit to Achilles (11. x8.73 f) after the fulfilment of the request he made at her first visit has led to his personal disaster.65 Whether the 6S On repeated type-scenes see Nagler (above, n.6), esp. zoo-z201.</page><page sequence="28">28 Mark W.
