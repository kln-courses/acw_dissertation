MALAY MUHAMMADANISM T^HE spirit of scepticism, against which theologians have to contend in the West, is replaced in the Far East by the curious readiness of the laity to accept several irreconcilable faiths at one and the same time. The Japanese, for instance, practically possess two state creeds; the Chinese see nothing inconsistent in a man simultaneously being a Buddhist, an ancestor-worshipper and a Confucian agnostic; in the Straits Settlements, men who do not personally profess Christianity often make prayers or offerings at Christian altars in the belief that such acts may be profitable. One well-meaning but illogical Chinaman is, in fact, reported to have actually offered up the sacrifice of a piece of pork at the shrine of a Mussulman saint. Under the circumstances it is not surprising that the religion of the Straits-born Chinese should have been sarcastically defined as "a belief in the Virgin Mary, the Prophet Muhammad and all the ghosts in Singapore", - and yet we may more charitably explain it as a kindly appreciation of the possibility that religious truth may not be the monopoly of any one creed or race. Muhammadanism itself is intolerant; it allots special divisions of hell to rival creeds, punishes a renegade as a murderer, and refuses to borrow any belief from living religions that are in arms against it. If however a rival creed will consent to surrender and to be absorbed into the Mussulman world, the missionary zeal of the Moslem is willing to make great concessions. It will, for instance, accept what is really an idolatrous shrine as the tomb of one of its own saints and so permit an old cult to survive under a new name. In this way the Malay Peninsula has come to be dotted with sacred localities of suspicious origin where old Hindu and Indonesian divinities are still worshipped under other designations. The Peninsular Muhammadans who are strict enough to reject every unorthodox cult however much disguised, are in a distinct minority. The average Malay may be said to look upon God as upon a great King or Governor, - mighty, of course, and just, but too remote a power to trouble himself about a villager's petty affairs, - whereas the spirits of the district are comparable to the local police, who may be corrupt and prone to error but who take a most absorbing personal interest in their radius of influence and whose ill-will has to be avoided at all costs. In the present chapter we only propose to discuss the purely Muhammadan elements in the religious beliefs of the Malay. Those elements were mainly introduced from Southern India. The Malays are consequently Sunnites like the Moslems of the Deccan; but Persian influence has been so great throughout India that even the Indian Sunnites have become infected with Shiite "heresies". In the Malay Peninsula traces of Shiite influence are visible in the Muharram festivities, in the peculiar respect paid to Ali, Hasan and Husain, and in the tone of much of the old Malay literature. In the matter of religious law the Malays are Shafeites. These explanations of the Malay religious stand- point are, however, somewhat technical; the average native of the</page><page sequence="3">Peninsula is generally unaware of the existence of rival Mussulman sects and of the divergence of his creed from the truer Sunnite beliefs. It is usual for Europeans to base their ideas of Muhammadanism upon a perusal of the Koran. Excellent as this method may seem, it is open to the practical objection that it entirely overlooks the social conditions prevailing when the Koran was written and the development that the creed has since undergone. Thus it comes about that the English reader of the Koran, by emphasizing those texts which appeal to his Christian appreciation, and by ignoring the real ideas of the Twentieth Century Moslem, ends by picturing to himself an ideal Muhammadanism such as no man has ever professed; indeed he usually goes a step further and makes invidious comparisons between this ideal faith and the imper- fect mundane Christianity practised by the men that he sees around him. Upon this imaginary Islam he also bases his opinion of the causes which make Muhammadanism so acceptable to its many converts and so unyielding to the proselytizing efforts of other creeds. Of course such lines of argument are misleading and unfair. We must judge modern Islam by what is actually believed by its votaries and preached in its mosques, and we must try to understand its missionary work by studying the arguments which appeal to its proselytes and not by those which would carry weight with us. On these points we are not altogether without data. The Masdil Sa-ribu is a Malay work professing to give the questions by which an enemy of Islam tried to confound the faithful, and the replies by which he was himself confuted. "Why is the sun round? - because it is perpetually bowing before the throne of God"; "when the Prophet was alone in the desert how did he effect the ritual shaving of his head? - he used the great wing of Gabriel as a razor". So run some of the questions and answers. Even in the best Malay work, the Bustanu's-salatin , the line of argument is equally unsatisfying: on the Prophet being questioned as to the successive supports of the earth, he mentions one animal after another, and when no finality is reached in this way regarding the real basis of the world, he turns furiously upon his enquirer and condemns him for impertinent inquisitiveness. In short, the arguments of Malay theologians might appeal to a Moslem but would hardly satisfy any one else. Popular accounts of conversions are even less satisfactory. The stories of the conversion of the Sultans of Malacca (as related in the Sejarah Melayu) and of the Sultans of Kedah (given in the Hikayat Marong Mahawangsa) rest upon the miraculous. An unwritten account of a religious revival in Acheh (quoted by Dr. Snouck Hurgronje in his book on the Achehnese)1 is very typical of Malay religious ideas. It is there related of the local saint Teungku di-Kuala that, on his return to his country, he found his fellow-countrymen to be very lax in the observance of their religious obligations so that the Arab zealots despaired of converting to better ways a people "whose mosques were the cockpits and whose prayers were bets". "Let me deal with them" said the holy Teungku. Accordingly he set himself up as a dealer in talismanic spells and in this guise taught the Moslem confession of faith to an Achehnese who wanted a magic formula to make his gamecock achieve success. The triumph of that cock was the making of the saint's reputation. Other customers came to learn the same formula, 1 "The Achehnese", II, 311, 312. 2</page><page sequence="4">and so at last, the Moslem confession of faith was heard throughout the land. Meanwhile the Teungku's original client protested that his monopoly was being infringed and was only pacified by being taught a further wonder-working spell - the Five Daily Prayers. This second talisman became as popular as the first, and the saint never rested until his countrymen's zeal for cock-fighting had led them to accept one after another all the cardinal doctrines of Islam. Yet all these arguments, poor as they are, represent more than the average Moslem deems necessary. The truths of Muhammadanism, he says, are not things to be argued about; they must be accepted without discussion. Witness this story of the Prophet himself: 44 'Out upon thee, Abu Sofian', cried Muhammad as the Koreishite chief drew near, 'hast thou not yet discovered that there is no God but the Lord alone?' - 'Noble and generous Sire! had there been any other God beside, verily he had been of some avail to me.' - 'And dost thou not acknowledge that I am the Prophet of the Lord?' continued Muhammad. - 'Noble Sire! as to this thing, there is yet in my heart some hesitancy.' - 'Woe is thee!' exclaimed Abbas, 'it is no time for hesitancy, this. Believe and testify at once the creed of Islam, or else thy head shall be severed from thy body.' So Abu Sofian repeated the formula of belief in God and in His Prophet." The modern Malay is even more impatient of "hesitancy": "Abu Jahl! how deeply is he accursed! what shall be his punishment for his resistance to Muhammad? When Muhammad had flung him to the clouds, he appeared to the eye like a tiny beetle."1 The fact is that Englishmen and Malays materially differ in their conception of the nature of religion. Great scientific discoveries have been made independently of the Bible and have caused theology to be looked upon by us as only one of several branches of knowledge. No really intelligent Christian nowadays would study sacred books with a view to discovering the causes of the sun's rotundity, nor would he explain the twinkling of the stars by saying that they were all trembling from fear of the Judgment Day; he would be satisfied with the view that religion provides "a rule by which to live and a hope in which to die", and he would not claim for it that it was the only key to all the sciences. It is otherwise with the Moslem. The Koran and the writings of the great Muhammadan saints and jurists breathe a spirit of wisdom, civilization and knowledge which is far above the moral, spiritual and intellectual level of the average modern Malay. To the earnest Moslem, theology represents all knowledge; the discoveries made by Muhammadan man are as nothing in importance beside God's revelations. It is not to be supposed that the Malay, ignorant as he usually is of the details of his religion, bases his belief on logical considerations or on philosophical grounds; he believes in his creed implicitly and blindly, and he escapes conversion because he is never open to any argument that does not rest upon the fundamental doctrines of Islam. For him, theology is the basis of research; if a scientific fact conflicts with the sacred books, he simply disbelieves the scientific fact. The nearest English parallel to the Moslem standpoint is the case of those earnest Christians who use purely biblical reasoning to prove an ethnological point such as the alleged descent of a 1 "The Achehnese", II, 256. 3</page><page sequence="5">modern nation from the lost ten tribes of Israel; any one who has been drawn into a discussion with a supporter of the Anglo-Israelite theory will doubtless understand from the type of argument used how it comes about that no Malay is ever converted to Christianity. The difference between the English and the Malay conception of religion evinces itself even more clearly in the case of persons indifferent to their creed. Where theology represents only one branch of knowledge, it may be ignored; where it represents all morals, science and civilization, it can no more be shaken off than race or nationality. An Englishman who is a careless Christian may describe himself as being no Christian at all, and yet the same man, however careless about his duty to his country, would bitterly resent the imputation that he had ceased to be an Englishman. There is in Islam something of the spirit of race or nationality, - a sense that religion is more than a rule of life for individuals; that it is, in fact, a noble type of character, a freemasonry or bond of union between all who profess it. The Muhammadan confes- sion of faith is not so much a creed as an oath or declaration of fealty such as every militant power is wont to exact from those who wish to avoid the penalties of resistance. If we view religion as a faith, a man may change his creed with his opinions, but, if we view it as a cause, we can understand why Islam should attach so little importance to the spiritual conversion of its proselytes and why it should treat a renegade as a traitor who has broken his allegiance. We can also understand the missionary zeal of Islam: every convert swells the community of Muhammad and so renders more possible its conquest of the world. No religion makes conversion easier; it is unnecessary to know the law of the Prophet or to obey his injunctions; the mere utterance of the "two words" of the confession of faith is sufficient to admit a man frankly, fully and irrevocably to the ranks of the elect1. To interferior races Muhammadanism offers a prouder position among the nations of the earth; it makes them partakers in a world-wide movement. To the more civilized peoples it appeals far less, so that (to quote Dr. Snouck Hurgronje) "the Western Nations showed it the door while the Persians, after a forced conversion, formed heretical sects and so preserved a great portion of their ancient beliefs."1 A curious illustration of the Moslem view that religion is largely a matter of national classification occurs in one of the acts of the Caliph Al-Mamun. That monarch once questioned some natives of the Hauran as to their faith, and, on being unable to make out exactly what they believed in, he ordered them to register themselves within six months under the Jewish, Moslem, Christian, Magian, or any other religion known to the Koran. This decree naturally caused great consternation among its victims until a Muhammadan jurist advised them to classify themselves as Sabaeans, for Sabaeans are mentioned in the Koran and even have a special hell reserved for their use, but no one at that time actually knew what the Sabaean doctrines were. Accordingly these tribes of the Hauran came down to us in Arabic records as "Sabaeans", much to the bewilderment of modern historians, until at last the learned Professor Chwolson in his great work "die Ssabier und der Ssabismus" 1 "The Achehnese," II, 279. The whole subject of Indonesian Muhammadanism is exhaustively dealt with in the work here quoted. 4</page><page sequence="6">explained away the difficulty and rechristened the mysterious tribesmen as "Pseudo-Sabaeans". Islam is therefore more than a mere movement in the domain of philosophy and thought; it is a great quasi-political force, a militant brotherhood, a definite type of civilization of which all its members are extremely proud and with which inferior races delight to associate them- selves. It aims at the conquest of the world for God and for Muhammad. In theory at least, it is held together by the five so-called "Pillars of the Faith",1 of which one is doctrinal and four are matters of ritual observance. These five "Pillars" of Islam deserve the very greatest attention. The first or central Pillar of the Faith is the taukid or doctrine oi the Unity of God. Although the saint-worship of Islam and the reverence paid to holy places may be considered to detract from the noble simplicity of this great central dogma, there is nothing in Muhammadanism that can compare with the tauhid as a means of maintaining the purity of the faith, of destroying degrading superstitions, and of giving a certain moral eminence to the devouter Moslems. Whenever in times of pestilence or trouble the people of a Malay district fall back upon their old primi- tive faiths and offer up vain sacrifices to the spirits of the country, the interest aroused by the resurrection of dead creeds and long-disused ceremonials tends to make the European observer more sympathetic tc the wizard and his formulae than to the few "fanatics" of the mosque who would kill all this primitive religion by their unwavering allegiance to the One True God. Yet it is to the everlasting credit of the Malay race and of the Moslem religion that they can produce men who even in their worst hours of distress steadily denounce all who are willing to traffic with the powers of darkness in order to gain some temporary relief from their troubles. The Five Ritual Prayers make up the second of the "Pillars of the Faith". The law imperatively ordains that every Moslem shall pray at least five times a day at certain definite hours and in a regularly specified way, and that the midday prayer on Fridays shall be amplified into a full service. Other prayers are recommended; no prayers are actually obligator except these five and the few prescribed for use at funeral ceremonies. The sight of Indian and other Muhammadans engaged in their devotions even in the most public places has done a great deal to create an impression that the Mussulman is more sincere in his belief than the Christian. A study of the Malay literature on the subject does not altogether bear out this idea; the books devote most of their attention to minor points such as minute details regarding the processes of ritual purification, and to discussions regarding the nature of the temporal blessings which the recital of these prayers may be expected to bring. We may also add that the Malays are extremely lax in the observance of the daily prayers and compare very unfavourably in outward devotion with their Indian and Arab co-religionists. The third Pillar is the annual fast during the month of Ramazan. Throughout that month, every Muhammadan is commanded to abstain (in the daytime only) from eating and drinking, from conjugal intercourse and even from such things as smoking, betel-chewing and taking snuff. On the whole, this injunction is loyally observed. 1 Rukun Islam. 5</page><page sequence="7">The fourth Pillar is the pilgrimage to Mecca. This is enjoined on all who can possibly afford it; and though there may be many cases of neglect to comply with the rule, the Malays can at least claim that they send more pilgrims to Mecca (in proportion to their numbers) than are sent by Indians, Persians, Moors or Turks. These pilgrims on their arrival at Mecca at the proper season (the commencement of the month Dzu'l-hijjah) proceed to the sacred mosque, perform their ablutions at the sacred well ( zamzam ), kiss the famous black meteoric stone which is set in the wall of the Kaabah, make the circuit of the Kaabah seven times, visit the traditional footmark of Abraham in the historic enclosure, utter certain prayers, and finally return to again kiss the black stone. On the ninth day of the month, the pilgrims all visit Mt. Arafat (near Mecca) which is said to have been the place where Adam was reunited with Eve after his expulsion from Eden. On the tenth day, the pilgrims throw pebbles at certain pillars - the ceremony often spoken of as the stoning of Satan; and then (at a place called the Mina Bazaar) they offer up a sacrifice to God. These last incidents correspond in date with the festival known as the hari raya haji in the Malay Peninsula. The last Pillar of the Faith is the payment of the religious tax or tithe. This obligation has been much misunderstood in British Malaya where it is assumed that every peasant is bound by the law of Islam to contribute a tenth of his agricultural produce as a sort of land-tax. The payment of "tenths" lies at the basis of the Malacca land revenue and has considerably influenced the taxation of crops in other places, but, as a matter of fact, the zakat or "tithe" is not confined to agricultural produce, it does not usually amount to a tenth, and it is intended for certain specified objects such as the emancipation of deserving slaves and debtors, the supply of funds for the Holy War, and the bestowal of gifts on indigent travellers, pious paupers, and converts to Islam. This religious tax ought to be paid to the Imam or chief mosque authority and to be disbursed by him; the Malay chiefs, by identifying themselves with the Imams and by a liberal interpretation of the term "the pious poor", succeeded in securing the tax for themselves. The British Govern- ment now stands in the place of the chiefs and has in that way come to represent the indigent and pious Moslem for whom the tithe was originally intended. The evil of this confusion between religious and civil revenue shows itself chiefly in the unwillingness of the Malay cultivator to pay for the support of his religious services. In former times any special contribution would have probably been misappropriated, while the native chief who took the lion's share of the religious tax might be expected, if only for the sake of appearances, to be responsible for the bare needs of the mosque. The Sultan was head of both church and state and had the revenues of both; the separation of church and state has left the church destitute except for its small religious endowments ( wakaf ). The principle of absolutely voluntary contributions for mosque- maintenance is rather alien to Malay Muhammadanism which trusts a good deal to compulsion in religious matters, so that the abrupt transition (under British influence) from the old state of things to a purely secular form of government has been a great source of anxiety to all connected with mosque-administration. The Five Pillars of Islam are theoretically recognized as of para- mount importance and obligation, but they are not always enforced, 6</page><page sequence="8">while some other observances of less theoretical weight are much more strictly observed. Such, for instance, are the rites of circumcision for men and of incision for women. According to strict law these rites are not obligatory, and it is even uncertain that Muhammad himself was circumcised. Abstention from forbidden foods and drinks is an obligation of minor importance, yet a Malay who habitually neglects his five daily prayers would shrink with horror from the sin of eating pork. Again, it is as sinful to drink spirits as to eat pork; Malay public opinion however treats the former as a much less serious sin than the latter. Malays are also apt to allow local custom to override religious law in many matters of dress and ceremonial, and they are very much affected by the worship of local saints and divinities. All these criticisms are only tantamount to saying that the Malay is an imperfect Moslem; he is certainly not an indifferent one and he comes relatively near to realizing the spirit of the religion in the form in which he has received it from India. Of the Five Pillars, one is doctrinal, four are ritual; not one is ethical. It would be too much to assert that there is no attention at all paid to ethics in the faith of Islam but it is to be regretted that there should be so little. The Koran itself sets a good moral standard; unfortunately the Koran is not much studied, except in the Arabic text and without much reference to its meaning. The formal side of Muhammadanism has come to receive more attention than the spiritual side so that the devout Moslem is the man who says many prayers rather than the man of upright or moral life. Harun "the Orthodox", a typically religious Caliph, was a cruel libertine; Nushirwan "the Just", who (though not a Moslem himself) has come to be considered a typically fair-minded King, acquired that reputation in great measure because he was the bigoted persecutor of the Manichaeans. The ethical standard of a Muhammadan country is national, not religious. The average religious man in Islam is largely a formalist; the Moslem saint is usually a mystic. To understand this position it is necessary to again mention the fact that theology is believed to be the key to unlock the secrets of the material as well as the spiritual universe, so that theological arguments based upon the letter of the Koran are pushed to absolutely useless lengths. For instance the spelling of the name Muhammad is taken to typify the ideal man: the head resembles the letter mim , the arms the ha, the body a medial mim , the legs a dal. Besides these extreme speculative tendencies, the mere fact of complete absorption in any one study creates a mystic. Just as Confucius claimed to forget his sorrows in the pursuit and attainment of knowledge, so too the Moslem mystic despises everything else as he comes to concentrate his attention on the glories of the Lord. Man is but a mirror, God is the resplendent sun; man is a phantom, God is absolute being. As a Persian poet has expressed it: Poor copies out of Heaven's original, Pale earthly pictures mouldering to decay, What care although your beauties break and fall, When that which gives them life endures for aye!1 1 Translated by R. A. Nicholson. The following passage from an early (XIV Century) Turkish poet, Yunus Imre , illustrates the pantheistic idea [Gibb's "History of Ottoman Poetry", I, 170]: 7</page><page sequence="9">The Malay aspirant to sanctity is a man of ecstatic absence of mind who forgets the interests of this world, its pains and its pleasures, in his meditations on God's greatness or in his recitation of God's Word. This mysticism, especially when it takes the pantheistic form of self -identi- fication with emanations from a divine principle, comes dangerously near a heretical claim to divine honours, and leads to the most bitter dissensions between rival sects of mystics; it lies also at the foundation of many performances, such as the so-called dabus- dances, in which the participants (who stab themselves with awls) assert that their divine ecstasies protect them from the sensation of earthly pain. In certain respects, Muhammadanism has done a noble work in the Malay Archipelago. In Java it destroyed a great material civilisation, but it also put an end to widow-burning, abolished the degrading influence of caste, and gave the people a happier religion than the pessimistic faith of the Hindoos. It gave the Malays the literature that they possess and a certain amount of knowledge of the great world. Yet we cannot say that it has been an unmixed good to these peoples. In the first place it weakened the force of Malay customary law (&lt; adat ), the great bulwark of the subject against the tyranny of his chief. Its doctrine of the "holy war" struck at the very roots of all morality and pity by practically denying human rights to non-Muhammadans, by justifying the kidnapping of Sakai and Semang aborigines, and by countenancing piracy and murder when the victims were only "infidels" whom it was legitimate to slay. Islam also prejudicially affected the status of Malay females. What we know about the position of women under the old Indonesian customary law goes to show that it was relatively a high one - perhaps even higher than that of men; Muhammadanism reduced that position, in theory, to one of absolute dependence on the male sex. When all justice has been done to the personal teaching of Muhammad, the fact remains that the Malays are most prosperous, most intelligent and most industrious in those parts of the Peninsula (such as the Menangkabau States) where they have kept to their traditional customs in opposition to the doctrines of Muhammadan Law. There remains a further question: what of the future of Islam in the Malay Peninsula? Modern requirements are making it difficult to observe the ritual law; it is hard for a clerk or mechanic either to keep the fast or to recite the five daily prayers or to find time for the pilgrimage to Mecca. The example of surrounding races is beginning also to affect the Malays in matters of clothing and diet, and even as regards abstinence from alcoholic stimulants. Every year brings additional laxity in what the devouter Malays would consider essentials of religion. Still, the successful resistance which Islam offers to the proselytizing " The thunderbolt that fiasheth forth , that , flashing weaves itself in birth , " The poison-snake that , deep in earth , to creep and cover is fain , am I. " The cloud that doth to heaven ascend , the rain that doth to earth descend , " The haze and mist that doth before the sightless eyes remain , am I. " Who buildeth bone and flesh and skin , who keepeth this a living thing , "Who lieth Wisdom's crib within , and Power's milk doth drain , am I. " Who summer brings and earth doth cheer , who makes our Heart-house His repair, " Who doth consent to dam and sire , who knoweth serfhood's gain , am I. " It is not Yunus sayeth this , 'tis Power's Tongue that speaketh thus , " Who credits not , a paynim is; - the First and Latest e'en am I!" 8</page><page sequence="10">efforts of Christianity indicates that the Moslems of the Peninsula are less attached to the teachings of their religion than they are to the great community of which that religion is the common bond. The citizen of a great country does not give up his allegiance whenever his country chooses to alter its laws. If Islam was merely a creed these changes might be fatal to it or, at least, would lead to great secessions; but Islam is more than a belief, it is a great religious brotherhood to which every Malay is proud to belong. Political differences in the past have exercised an estranging force, for, in theory, all the Moslem world was to have constituted a single nation under one elective ruler. These differences are now being effaced by the gradual subjection of the various Moslem princes whose powers detracted from the influence or recognition of the Caliphate; the claimant to the Caliphate himself, the Sultan of Turkey, remains free, active and independent. The destruction of the different national ideals of the different Moslem states has created the international ideal of the Panislamic movement which by uniting all Islam under one political head is to make it once more a great world-power. 9</page><page sequence="11">II. BELIEFS REGARDING THE WORLD OF SPIRITS WE have seen that the orthodox Malay believes in the One God, Omnipotent and Eternal. His conception of true divinity is extremely high and is altogether opposed to anything anthropomorphic; he cannot even mention the doctrine of the Trinity or the missionary version of the birth of Christ without adding the words "may God forgive me for this blasphemy!" He also considers the divine to be so immensely above the merely supernatural that there is no parallel in his mind between the nature of God and that of his subjects, the angels, the saints, the houris, and the spirits, both good and evil, who inhabit heaven or hell. This noble ideal of divinity is, however, too high for general acceptance, so that most Malays either permit the great pure central doctrine of Islam to be buried under a mass of petty superstitions as to saint-worship and the talismanic value of different Muhammadan observances, or else, in time of stress and danger, turn deliberately to the cult of older divinities, of whose historical position they are ignorant and whom they believe to be evil spirits whom it is sinful to adore. Between the Moslems who adore saints and those who bow the knee to devils there is really very little to choose, for both alike offend against God's precept that worship shall be paid to Him alone; yet, in popular estimation, the former practice is not actually reprehensible so that every attempt is made to give a similar veneer of orthodoxy to practices of the latter type. To worship a tree-spirit is sinful; to worship God for manifesting his power through the medium of the tree is quite another matter. To openly adore the Four Great Indonesian Spirits of the Sea is a thing that a fisherman must be very desperate to do, yet he has only to invoke the same divinities by the names of the Four Archangels, and he may offer sacrifices to them before the very eyes of the Elders of his mosque. In this way a quasi-Muhammadan character has been given to rites which properly belong to a very much older religion, until at last it has become difficult to distinguish between the real essence of these ceremonies and the inconsequent gibberish with which the Malay magician veils the true purport of what he is doing. It would also seem that the Hinduism of the Malays was, in its time, equally superficial, for the attributes of the old primitive Indonesian Gods are often hidden under Sanscrit, as well as Arabic, names. Add to these difficulties the further confusion resulting from dialectic variations in language, from local peculiarities in belief, and from the interpolations or omissions made by transmitters of formulae and ceremonial, - then only can we fully understand how very general any inferences must be if they rest upon the tissue of absurdities that passes for Malay magic. It seems fairly clear from the beliefs of non-Muhammadan Indonesians (and inferentially from the beliefs of the Malays themselves) that all things, organic and inorganic, were once credited with the possession of souls. This primitive animism survives most distinctly in 10</page><page sequence="12">the well-known Malay ceremonies connected with the rice-soul at seed- time or harvest, but it is also traceable in a large number of other practices. Whenever a peasant injures anything he must propitiate its personality, its living essence, its soul, its tutelary spirit - call it what we will. If the hunter slays a deer he must excuse himself: it is not the man but the gun or the knife or the leaden bullet that must answer for the deed. Should a man wish to mine or to set up a house, he must begin by propitiating the spirits of the turned-up soil; should he desire to fish, he will address the spirits of the sea and even the fish themselves; should he contemplate planting, he begins by acknowledging that rice has a living essence of its own which he is bound to treat with respect. In short, he considers that all nature is teeming with life and that his own soul is walking in the midst of invisible foes. Clearly connected with this theory of universal life is the idea of special sanctity attaching to weird or abnormal objects. Exceptional things, thinks the Malay, must have exceptional soul-personalities, so that while it is practically impossible for him to ceremonially propitiate the manes of every tree that he fells or of every bird that he snares, he is very careful to respect anything that is quite out of the common. Trees of unusual size, rocks of peculiar shape, animals with strange deformities, - all such things are sacrosanct. A Malay dares not injure them; to do so would bring down upon himself the wrath of unseen powers. Of course, it is not to be supposed that the Malay peasant is fully aware of the animistic character of his belief. He acts as his ancestors acted before him; he does not reason why. He is satisfied with the fact that a tree has a spirit attached to it; he does not stop to enquire whether that spirit is the soul of the tree or the tutelary genius of the tree or merely a ghost that has taken up its abode in the tree; all he is certain about is that some unseen power is connected with the tree. We are left to discover the true character of Malay beliefs by comparing one superstition with another, and by tracing the idea that is common to them all. The peasant speaks of a very localized spirit - such as the spirit of a tree, rock or pool - sometimes as a puaka, sometimes as a penunggu, and sometimes as a dato' The puaka is really the soul of the object, the penunggu or "guardian-watcher" is that soul when explained as being a tutelary spirit, and the data9 is the tutelary spirit when identified with the soul of a Moslem saint. Other terms which suggest an animistic origin are jembalang , the highly localized gnomes of the soil, and badi , the evil forces generated by the destruction of anything; these expressions are often used in juxtaposition as though they were practically identical in meaning. Similar animistic ideas are connected with the words daulat and andika or adika : any insult or injury to the highly placed - even if it be a presumptuous act done in ignorance - is believed to lead to punishment at the hands of the offended majesty (daulat) of kings or (andika) of high officers of state. Examples of this belief in daulat are very common. Every commoner who marries a princess or a woman of saintly ancestry is said to be exposed to the vengeance of outraged dignity; it is related, for instance, in the Malay Annals that it was difficult to find a consort for Sang Seperba , the founder of the great Malay dynasties, owing to the fact that vengeance overtook every girl who had the insolence to mate with 11</page><page sequence="13">so nobly-born a hero. Even the presumptuous handling of royal insignia is believed to bring down a curse. These beliefs are often explained by the theory that there is a special tutelary spirit (jin kerajaan or }in nafiri) that watches over royalty, but it seems much more reasonable to suppose that every extremely localized power is only a special manifestation of the general animistic theory that all nature is alive and that every injury brings down on the wrong-doer "the ancient blinded vengeance and the wrong that avengeth wrong". The common word keramat, which must be familiar to every resident in the Malay Peninsula, is an Arabic expression that is applied to anything miraculous or wonder-working; it is used of "haunted" tombs, rocks and trees, and also of sacrosanct animals that are believed to be invulnerable. It is essentially a term introduced for the purpose of giving an orthodox Mussulman appearance to things that generally appertain to primitive non-Muhammadan superstitions. The souls of the dead are considered in Malaya, as indeed every- where else, to furnish a rich recruiting-ground for the army of evil spirits. They supply the hantu bangkit or sheeted bogey of the graveyards, and the more peculiar hantu bungkus (also known as hantu kochong and hantu golek) which is so tied up by its funeral-wrappings that it can only make its way along the ground by rolling over and over on its side. More malignant, however, and far more potent than these spirits of the cemetery are the ghosts of murdered men, of women who have died in childbirth and of children who have died unborn. The best-known of the birth-spirits are the langsuyar (or burong), the pontianak (or mati- anak ), and the penanggalan (or tenggelong). The langsuyar, which for some unexplained reason (unless perhaps for its cry) bears the name of a bird of prey, is represented as a beautiful woman whose flowing tresses conceal an orifice in the neck or back through which the viscera may be seen; it is generally said to be the ghost of an unchaste woman who died pregnant. The ghost of a still-born child is the pontianak or mati-anak ; its shape is not very definitely known. The third of these birth-spirits, the penanggalan, is a spirit of doubtful origin but of very definite shape, - a horrible wraith made up of a human head with long dependent viscera - and, like the other two, it is said to prey on women in childbed. If the buta-ranggas, another vaguely known spirit-bird, is also a birth-spirit, it is probably a local variant of the same idea and illustrates the fact that Malays hearing of the same thing under different names are apt to mistake synonyms for separate entities. One thing is certain: all these ghosts are ancient Indonesian ghosts. They must be so not only because the belief in them is so widespread in the Archipelago, but also because the Muhammadans consider that death in childbed is a thing that entitles a woman to all the honours of martyrdom for the faith. We have so far been dealing with one single idea. Spirits of mur- dered men, of slaughtered deer, of turned-up soil, of fallen trees, of outraged symbols of greatness, of women and children untimely dead, - all alike are souls vengeful against the source of their misfortunes, nor do they discriminate between the guilty and the innocent. They represent essentially the spirit of blinded vengeance; and we have no evidence that the old Indonesians ever thought that the unseen world was also 12</page><page sequence="14">peopled with the ghosts of those who had perished in the fulness of time. Disease was the weapon of these evil spirits, an unseen wound delivered by an unseen hand. Special illnesses were sometimes connected with special spirits: the outraged majesty of kings punished its victims with diseases of the skin, while the peculiar yellow glow sometimes accompanying a rainy sunset is still associated with the spirits of jaundice. Moreover, as illnesses vary in severity, the degree of severity is explained as depending on the nature of a man's relations with the spirit of disease. Is a patient only slightly indisposed? - then the spirit must have passed him without actual contact and must have left him uninjured save by the polluted air. Has a man symptoms that come to nothing in the end? - then the spirit must have addressed him but not attacked him. The actual attack, they say, can often be actually seen: the paroxysms of the delirious show the unfortunate man struggling in the clutches of his invisible foe; the griping pains of cholera, the choking in diseases of the throat, - what are they except indications that a spirit is twisting the entrails or garotting the neck? So argue the Malays, and one result of the argument is a cruel one, for if the appearance of a man-eating tiger near a small hamlet is sufficient to scatter the inhabitants, how much more then should men flee from the vicinity of a disease-bearing spirit that can neither be seen nor resisted? Inspired by such ideas, men will occasionally leave the poor victim of some malady to perish miserably in the forest while they themselves seek safety in flight. No community can develop its civilization so long as it has to flee from place to place whenever one of its members becomes the prey of an illness; if it is to prosper it must find some other means of protection against the spirits of disease. Hence arose the witch-doctor. It is easy for us to smile at his impostures, but he has played an invaluable part in communities where animistic views are held as to the origin and nature of sickness. We now pass on to spirits the are not to be explained as the souls of objects prematurely destroyed. We have already alluded to the con- servativeness of the Malays which makes them unwilling to give up any cult that they can possibly retain under a thin Muhammadan disguise; in fact we can go so far as to say that their demonology is made up of the strata of several successive religions. The upper stratum is, of course, Moslem; the Malays accept the whole demonology of the Persians and Arabs and have even added to it by assuming mere demon-epithets such as "accursed" (mala'un) or "misbegotten" ( haramzadah , jadah ) to be the names of new varieties of devils. The next stratum is Hindu. The great God Siva (Betara Guru or the Supreme Teacher) is still propitiated as a mighty demon, powerful both by land and sea; Kala survives as an evil spirit of the forest; Sri, the Indian Ceres, is invoked at the harvest-festivals as the tutelary Goddess of Grain; other deities such as Indra and Ganesha (Sangyang Gana ) are occasionally mentioned in incantations. Five Hindu divinities - Maheswara (Siva the Supreme Lord), Brahma, Vishnu, Kala and Sri - preside over the Five Divisions of the Day and materially influence the calculations of fortune-tellers. The nymphs and fairies of the Indian Olympus ( dewa , indera , chendera , bidadari) are constantly referred to by Malays. The evil spirits of the forests ( buta , gergasi, raksasa) are represented as fierce tusked ogres 13</page><page sequence="15">that still infest the jungle and live on human flesh; indeed, the aborigines of Kedah are said to have been ogres ( gergasi ) and to have so affected one of the Malay Sultans of that state (who was of aboriginal blood on his mother's side) that he became a cannibal and had to be driven from the throne. Hanuman is still vaguely remembered as a dog-faced or horse-faced demon, meteors are described as the ghostly arrows of Arjuna, and the legends of the Indian Ramayana have become folk-lore in the Northern States. The ancient literature of the Malays is also full of references to Hindu mythology. It is comparatively easy to identify those portions of Malay demonology which owe their existence to the historic Moslem or Hindu influences, but below these upper strata of beliefs we find further strata belonging to primeval religions of whose character we know very little. We are here dealing with a very mixed race of people who have probably preserved traditions handed down to them from several distinct sources. A few facts stand out fairly distinctly. The fishermen along the coast of the Peninsula sacrifice to four great Spirits of the Sea who go by many names but whose scope of authority is always the same: one is the Spirit of Bays,1 another that of Banks or Beaches,2 another that of Headlands,3 and the last and fiercest is the Spirit of Tideways or Mid-currents.4 Most of the designations given to these ancient divinities are merely descriptive of their functions. So long as things go well, the names of the four Archangels are considered sufficient; if things go badly, Sanscrit words are used; if matters become desperate, the fisherman throws prudence to the winds and appeals to the spirits in pure Indonesian terms which they cannot fail to understand. On land we have one supreme divinity who is in some mysterious way associated with the colour black, as the "Black Youth" (awang hitam) or the "Black Spirit" (jin hit am, hantu hitam ), the King of the Earth, whose foot is on the heart of the world and whose hands are on the gate of heaven. The four deities of the sea and the one "black deity" of the land represent in all probability the Gods of some ancient local race whose blood runs in the veins of the Malays. Of course there is great confusion in this demonology. The functions of the "Black Youth" must necessarily clash with those of the old supreme divinity, Siva or Betara Guru, who has now been relegated to the position of an all-powerful spirit of the country; they must also clash in many details with those of another great demon, the "Spectre Huntsman", who appears to be a forest spirit of Sumatran origin. Nevertheless the three deities, though their powers overlap, are distinct enough in their main characteristics: the Black Youth is some old divinity of the aborigines; Betara Guru is Siva, the Supreme Teacher, the First Magician from whom all native magicians claim to derive their rites; the Spectre Huntsman represents in all probability a deity of the old Sumatran immigrants since he is worshipped on both sides of the Straits. The true Sumatran tradition is represented by many names that occur in incantations: Wan Po' and Wan Melini, the fair dwellers on Mt. Siguntang-guntang, the legendary cradle of the Malay race; Demang Lebar Daun, the old ruler of Palembang; and the great Serpent, Si-katimuna, that the Malay hero Sang Seperba slew. The old Menang- kabau religion appears in some measure to have been a worship of 1 TSlok. 2 BSting. 3 Tanjong. 4 Laut, tali hams. 14</page><page sequence="16">very localized divinities, the Gods of particular mountains and rivers, deities, in fact, like the Fairy Princess of Mt. Ophir near Malacca. This last Goddess is represented as having dwelt in a lovely garden on the summit of the great mountain, as having been guarded by a tiger, and as being in possession of the power of changing her appearance. Examples of such localized spirits (other than the souls of rocks and trees) are as rare in the Malay Peninsula as they are common among the Malays of Sumatra. We have now dealt with two great classes of spirits: the souls of the dead and the Gods or demons of old religions. This brings us to a third class. The Malays are prone to believe inexplicable natural phenomena such as will o'the wisps, meteors, echoes, rainbows, changes of light and shade in the jungle, and clouds of extraordinary shape and colour to be spirits. Echoes are the cries of ghosts;1 St. Elmo's fires are spirits of the sea settling on masts;2 the rainbow is a celestial serpent of enormous size;3 a sudden shadow in the forest is a spirit flitting by.4 Moreover traditions of animals with which the Malays were once acquainted have grown into stories of ghosts as the reality has been lost sight of; thus the account of the Sumatran orang-outang (mawas) has become the tale of a semi-human spirit of gigantic strength with sharp arms of iron that enable it to fell a path for itself through the jungle. Probably the balong bidai or gulong bidai , an evil spirit of the waters that rolls up a man as in a mat and drags him below the surface, is only the echo of the story of some sea-snake, for we read of it in at least one old romance (the Hikayat Koris) as a mere serpent which "coiled round the oars of the galley of Koris Mengindra". A fourth class of spirits is made up of demons that can be generated at the will of man. There exists a belief among Malays that the incidental products of a confinement (such as the liquor amnii, the caul, and the placenta) are themselves endowed with possible life. The apparently causeless smiling or chuckling of a baby is explained by the suggestion that he is thinking of his "younger brother", the placenta, his companion in his antenatal days. In some parts of Malaya, the people ceremonially throw the placenta into the sea; in other parts they bury them under a tree, or plant a tree over them, - the tree remaining as a primitive record of a person's age. Abdullah, in the account of his voyage to Kelantan, refers to a woman who described her age by saying that her "tree" had withered in the fullness of time and that a second had grown up in its place. The exact explanation of these mysterious beliefs appears to have been lost, but of their connection with the generation of evil spirits there is distinct evidence. The demons over whom the Maharaja Boma reigned were (so the Hikayat Sang Samba distinctly tells us) created by the incidental products at his birth; it is also common for Malay wizards to explain in the same way the origin of the spirits whom they are addressing. These theories are quite alien to the Moslem belief which attributes the creation of genii to fire, and states that Satan was accursed for refusing to pay homage to Adam on the very ground that fire was a nobler element than the clay out of which man was formed. The Malays all agree that familiar spirits can be generated by magicians and kept in captivity to serve the will of their masters. Unfortunately, the accounts given of the modus operandi for creating 1 Hantu-hantuan. 2 JSrambang. 3 Ular danu. 4 Jin lintasan. 15</page><page sequence="17">such genii differ so greatly that it is impossible to trace any connection between them such as might throw light on the origin of this superstition. Curiously enough, both the two best-known familiars - the bajang and the pelesit - are connected with animals; the sight, therefore, of such creatures about a house is sufficient to create the wildest excitement. A proverbial rhyme runs: Should you see a pSlgsit1 coming through the gloom, Spit on it with pepper, bang it with a broom! The pelesit is said to dislike such treatment; who indeed would not? None the less, it is a very serious thing for a Malay to be credited with the possession of one of these familiars; and the danger of the situation is not lessened by the fact that the victim of such suspicions often himself believes some spirit to have unaccountably taken a fancy to him and to be carrying out projects of vengeance which were only conceived in a hasty moment of passion and were never seriously intended to be put into execution. Over and above the beliefs that have been already mentioned, there exist a number of superstitions which do not lend themselves readily to classification. The Malays imagine the forest to be peopled with invisible elves2, which may be identical with the echo-spirits; they invoke a tiger- spirit3, which is said to be connected with disease; and they also speak of other ghostly denizens of the forest such as the hantu denai , that haunts jungle tracks, and the hantu songkai , that interferes with the snares of hunters. They believe also in ghostly animals and in men who have the power of transforming themselves into tigers. In this chapter we have been dealing solely with the supernatural beings which the Malays assert to exist on earth; we leave to subsequent pages their theories regarding the acquisition of magical powers by man, their views on divination, their trust in talismans, their procedure in dealing with spirits, and their beliefs in imaginary animals such as the dragon and the fiery rhinoceros. 1 The pSISsit is a kind of grasshopper. The Malay version is: datang pSISsit di-tSngah malam - di-sSmbur lada pukul pSnyapu. 2 Orang bunian. 3 Hantu bSlian. 16</page><page sequence="18">III. BELIEFS REGARDING OUR WORLD AND ITS HISTORY TT need hardly be said that the orthodox Malay does not believe the world to be round, - or rather that if he does, he understands the expression to mean circular and not spherical; "how can the earth be round", he argues, "when we can all see for ourselves that it is flat?" He thinks that the universe is built up in zones or layers. High above all is the yarash or empyrean heaven surrounding the Throne of Glory; beneath it there extends the crystalline heaven in which is set the Judgment Seat of God. Next in order come the seven abodes of the blessed: the Mansion of Splendour (or heaven of pearl), the Mansion of Rest (made of ruby and garnet), the Garden of Mirrors (of yellow metal), the Garden of Eternity (of yellow coral), the Garden of Delights (of white diamond), the Garden of Paradise (of dull gold), and the Everlasting Mansion (of pure musk). A sort of eighth or inferior paradise is formed by the Garden of Eden. Below the Garden of Eden stretch the seven zones of the sky, then come the seven strata of the earth and, last of all, the seven circles of Hell: the Deep Pit for sinful Moslems, the Blazing Flame for Christians, the Intense Fire for Jews, the Furious Fire for Sabaeans, the Scorching Heat for Magians, the Hottest of Fires for idolators and the Bottomless Pit for hypocrites. The earth itself, the Moslems say, is a vast plain shut in on all sides by the giant mountain-ranges of Kaf. Over the world, from East to West, from the boiling fountains of the morn to those of the sunset, there extends a rainbow-sea over which the ship of the Sun is daily towed along by three hundred and sixty angels to give warmth and brightness to the dwellers upon earth. Alexander the Great, that indefatigable sightseer, is said to have visited the seething pools from which the sun rises, and to have found them to be one hundred and eighty in number, - the difference in distance between pool and pool explaining the changes in the length of the solar day. The rainbow-sea, which slants up at one end from the springs of the dawn and slopes down at the other to the wells of the evening, cannot be deemed to rise anywhere to any very great height for there exists a Moslem legend that Og, the giant King of Bashan, was in the habit of snatching up fish from the ocean and holding them up to the sun to roast. The moon and planets are said to travel like the sun, while the stars are suspended like lamps from the vault of heaven. All alike attest the glory of God: the sun spends its night in adoration below the Throne of Glory, the stars are shivering through fear of the Judgment Day, thunder is the murmur of the angels, and eclipses are the work of demons who are everlastingly being thwarted by the unforgetting Mercy of the Lord. Were it not for the existence of the Kaf mountains which serve to steady the world, the earth would be in a state of perpetual tremor. The great range itself lies beyond the boiling fountains of the sun and is separated from them by a zone of eternal darkness in which is hidden 17</page><page sequence="19">the well of the Water of Life that Alexander set out to discover and that Khizr alone found. In this gloomy region are also located the famous tribes of Gog and Magog, - dwarfish Jews who are only prevented from overrunning the world by a great rampart set up against them by the Macedonian conquerer. Night after night these indefatigable Israelites endeavour to break through the wall, but, just as they are about to succeed, dawn comes, the dwarfs are driven underground by the over- powering heat of the sun-fountains, and the barrier is miraculously repaired during the daylight hours, at a time when its assailants are sleeping soundly with no covering round their bodies save their own enormous ears. Some day nevertheless, the dwarfs will find a ruler, Dajjal or Antichrist, who will lead them over the broken barrier to the conquest of the world; they will eat up every fruit, herb, and living thing, - until, at last, the Messiah will come, Antichrist will be overcome by Christ, Asrafel will sound the last trump, and all alike will die. Antichrist himself will be no dwarf, but a giant mounted on a donkey so stupendous that a thousand men will be able to march in the shadow of one of its ears. Can any one marvel, says a Persian writer, that Jews should be arrogant when they are the destined heirs of all these glories of Dajjal? The Almighty is said to have created the heavens and the earth in seven of His days, - each of his days being equal to a thousand years of human computation. He created man in the following manner. He first sent the Angels Gabriel, Michael and Asrafel, one after another, to procure the glutinous clay from which man was to be made, but all three returned with their mission unfulfilled owing to the protests of the earth herself. He then sent Azrael who carried out the command relentlessly and paid no heed to prophecies of the evil that man would one day do. God gave the clay the shape of Adam and sent it a soul by the hands of Gabriel. As the soul entered the mouth of Adam, Adam sneezed and exclaimed: "glory be to God!" "God be merciful unto you!" said Gabriel, - whence it has become customary to say "God bless you" whenever a person sneezes. Eve was subsequently created (in the manner described in the Bible) and dwelt with her husband in Eden, free to eat of all the fruit in the garden save only of grain, which the Moslems believe to have been the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. Now Satan, being unable to enter into the garden owing to the vigilance of the Angel-guardian of the Gate, induced the serpent (which in those days walked on four legs) to swallow him and to bear him along into Eden. Then, when the voice of the devil through the mouth of the serpent had induced Adam and Eve to partake of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, the Angel of God's wrath touched the man and woman with his flaming sword and tore from them the celestial skin that they had worn in their earthly paradise, so that only a little patch hidden under the skin at the base of the finger-nails serves in these days to indicate what man's complexion might have been. The Angel also shore off the limbs of the snake and compelled it to walk on its belly and eat dust, it and its descendants to the end of time. After these acts of retributive justice the trees of the garden, lowering their boughs to the ground, lifted up the four offenders and hurled them out into the world, Adam falling on Adam's Peak, Eve at Jeddah, and the serpent at Ispahan. From the tears of contrition that Adam wept were created the spices for which Ceylon is famous; from his tears of joy when God sent 18</page><page sequence="20">him Gabriel as a comforter, sprang up the narcissus and the amaranth. Gabriel taught Adam the art of sowing cereals, the use of draught-cattle, and the proper preparation and consumption of food; he also reduced Adam's stature to merely human size and sent him on a pilgrimage to Mecca where on Mount Arafat he once more met with Eve. Eve after- wards twice bore him twin-children, a son and a daughter at each birth; and it was agreed that each brother should receive the other's twin-sister in marriage; but Cain's sister was the fairer and the dispute that arose led to the murder of Abel and to the first entry of Death into the world. The Muhammadan account of Old Testament History approaches so closely to our own that only the more important divergences need be noticed. It is related that Satan survived the Flood because Noah in a moment of annoyance with the ass (which was slow to enter the Ark as Satan was tugging at its tail) urged the poor beast on with the words "come in, you accursed one", - a remark which was interpreted as a direct invitation to the devil. It is also said that the pig was created to serve as a scavenger for the Ark and that it owes its uncleanness to the reasons which called it into being. The "fire of Nimrod", to which allusion is sometimes made in Malay literature, refers to a story that Abraham in his early years was the subject of Nimrod, an impious and idolatrous king, who would have burnt the patriarch had not the burning fiery furnace refused to consume the chosen of the Lord. The Moslems attribute to Abraham the building of the Kaabah and the fixing of the details of the pilgrimage to Mecca; they claim that the famous Zamzam well is the well miraculously created for Hagar in the wilderness, and they explain the origin of the rites of circumcision and incision as follows: Sarah invented the latter rite as a nominal (but altogether unjust) punishment for Hagar, and the Almighty met this petty piece of spite by imposing the rites as an obligation upon Abraham, Sarah, and their descendants for ever. The story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife is a favourite theme of Arabic and Persian writers and forms the subject of one of the oldest Malay romances. The accounts given of Moses are only amplifications of the Pentateuch version; a certain special interest attaches, however, to the details about Korah. Korah ( Karun ) is said to have been instructed by his cousin, Moses, in the use of the philosopher's stone so that he was enabled to acquire enormous wealth, to own gardens, palaces and pavilions filled with gold, and to impress the children of Israel by ostentatiously parading the keys of his treasuries before the eyes of all the people. Then God, - so the Koran tells us, - "ordered the earth to swallow him, him and his palace." "Those who desired the things of the earth said: 'would to God that we had the wealth of Korah'. But the wise exclaimed: 'woe be to you; for the gifts of God are worth more to him who believes and who acts uprightly'." The Malays believe to this day that the treasures of Korah may sometimes be found at no great depth below the surface of the earth, and that their exact position can be discovered by the use of magic; cases have even been known of credulous Chinese wasting their money on a search for the riches of Korah. To the Malays Solomon is a great historic figure. He is still looked upon as the ruler of the animal world; the very trappers in the jungle address their prey in the name of "God's prophet, Solomon". His adven- tures with the Queen of Sheba are recorded in romance, his seal (the 19</page><page sequence="21">pentacle) is drawn by sorcerers on talismans and gives its name to the five-pointed starfish, and his wealth, like the treasure of Korah, is much sought for by local magicians. It is not at all clear how this last superstitition arose. According to the Alexander legend, Andalus (the Palembang of the Sejarah Melayu) was certainly the city in which the treasures of Solomon were gathered together round a fountain of molten bronze, but the walls of Andalus were immeasurably high and the few men who reached the parapet were only seen to laugh wildly and to disappear for ever behind it. The historical tradition of the Persian Book of Kings has reached the Malays and is given at some length in the Bustanu's-salatin; it has also influenced the Sejarah Melayu and some other books dealing with the alleged descent of Malay rulers from the famous Alexander the Great. The Persian story is that one of their sovereigns married a daughter of Philip of Macedon and almost immediately afterwards divorced her. The unfortunate princess, after leaving her husband, dis- covered that she was pregnant; but Philip, anxious to conceal the slight that had been put upon him by the contemptuous way in which his daughter had been treated, hushed up the whole incident and brought up his grandson as his son. Alexander, the child in question, having learnt his true origin when he came of age, put forward a claim to the Persian throne and overthrew his younger brother, Darius, who resisted him. This perversion of the facts of history was partly due to the desire of the Persians to explain away the humiliating fact of their conquest by Macedon, but it was not made till a late date when Alexander had been accepted as a Moslem hero and had been identified with a mysterious Arab "Dzu'l-karnain" who is mentioned in the Koran. Passing over the many legends centering in Alexander, the story goes on to say that, at his death, his kingdom was divided, the territories East of the Tigris being partitioned up among Parthian "tribal kings" (muluk-i- tawaif), while those to the West fell under the dominion of the Seleucid Kings of Syria and the Ptolemies of Egypt. Such, at least, is the account given in the Bustanu's-salatin', the Malay Annals, with their usual inaccuracy, state that Alexander was succeeded by his son, Aristotle, i We next hear of the ascendancy of the Romans in whose time another great figure in Mussulman history - Nabi Isa or Jesus Christ - is admitted to have been born. The Muhammadan account of the facts of the New Testament concedes almost everything that Christians profess: the Annunciation (Kor. Ill, 40 - 43), the Virgin Birth (Kor. LXVI, 12), the slaughter of the innocents, the flight into Egypt, the story of John the Baptist, the miracle at Cana, the healing of the sick and blind (Kor. LXI, 6), the raising of the dead to life (Kor. Ill, 43), the twelve disciples, the betrayal for thirty pieces of silver, the Ascension, and the Second Coming. There are some divergences, notably the curious accept- ance by Muhammad of the Manichaean explanation of the crucifixion: "they did not slay Jesus, neither did they crucify him, but one who resembled him" (Kor. IV, 156). These concessions to Christianity seem to cover a good deal; the Malays, however, like all Moslems, are bitterly opposed to the usual Christian doctrine on two points. The first arises out of the insistence of missionaries on the Malay words for "begotten son" in the expression "the only begotten son of God"; Malays vehemently maintain that the words, if taken literally, are contradicted 20</page><page sequence="22">by the fact of the Virgin Birth, and, if taken metaphorically, are inappli- cable owing to the blasphemous suggestiveness of their associations. The second point is the doctrine of the Trinity; Muhammadans are strongly unitarian and look upon polytheism as the one unpardonable sin. The Bustanu' s-salatin gives a fairly accurate enumeration of the principal Roman Emperors and Sassanian kings up to the days of the Prophet, but the only ruler in these lists who is more than a mere name is Nushirwan, the type of "justice". After Nushirwan the predominant Persian element in Malay tradition shows itself only in the manner in which the story of Muhammad and his successors is treated. This little book is no place for a detailed biography or appreciation of the great Arabian prophet, especially as on such questions the Malay version would necessarily differ greatly from the English. The main incidents - about which all writers are agreed - are these. Muhammad was born at Mecca, the posthumous son of Abdullah bin Abdu'l-muttalib of the illustrious house of the Kuraish. It is quite incorrect to describe him as a "camel-driver" of humble origin; his grandfather had been the most influential man in Mecca, his uncles were strong enough to protect him for years against religious persecution, and his own relative, Abu Sofian, was leader of the armies that Mecca sent against him. On reaching man's estate, Muhammad married Khadijah, a wealthy widow, in whose service he had been employed. Her money enabled him to devote himself to religious speculations in the course of which he came into conflict with the corrupter elements in the religion of the people of Mecca. A few facts about this early period are extremely important: Muhammad's earliest converts were his own immediate relatives who had excellent opportunities of judging whether he was sincere; those of his near relatives whom he failed to convert still remained sincerely attached to him; for many years his progress was so slow that he can have had nothing to encourage him save faith in the character of his mission; his claim to be considered the "sent" ( rasul) of God involved the use of a modest word which had not in those days the special associations of apostleship. His comparative failure at Mecca led to the famous flight to Medina, a place where he had many converts and where he soon became a great political power. Then followed a long series of petty wars conducted with varying fortunes: at one time he was besieged in Medina, at another he was the master of Mecca; on one day he was the victor of Badr, on another the vanquished of Ohod; in the end he triumphed and was strong enough to send envoys to Egypt, to Persia and to the Emperor of the East. When the proud Persian sovereign, Khusrau Parwiz, tore up the Prophet's letter, "even so", said Muhammad, "shall his kingdom be torn to pieces". By this time, however, the Prophet was an old man, and he died without having led his armies beyond the confines of Arabia; it was left to his successors to conquer Egypt, Syria, Persia and Mesopotamia, and to make a world-power of the Muham- madan Empire. Malay writers on early Muhammadan history neglect the great issues and love to dwell on three points of comparatively minor importance: the campaigns, the miracles and the Prophet's "testamentary injunctions" to posterity. The wars form the subject of a number of romances: one on the conquest of Syria, another on the defeat of Heraclius, a third on the expedition against the Jews of Khaibar, a fourth on the campaign 21</page><page sequence="23">of Badr, and a fifth on the siege of Medina; only in all these cases the historical treatment is so inaccurate that the city of Khaibar, the plain of Badr and the moat ( khandak ) round Medina are turned into the names of kings. The miraculous element in the Prophet's life has inspired a number of Malay works, such as the history of the journey to heaven on the monster, Al-burak, the legend of the cleaving of the moon, and the account of the shaving of Muhammad by Gabriel, when the houris of heaven so sought for the falling locks that not a single hair was allowed to reach the ground. The curious treatises purporting to record the "testamentary" admonitions of the Prophet1 are really of the nature of theological tracts and their dissemination (according to Dr. Snouck Hurgronje) usually coincides with a religious revival accompanied by outbursts of intolerance. Of the annals of the world subsequent to the early days of Muhammadanism the well-read Malay is generally ignorant or owes his information to English sources. To him history is a branch of theology; the superior interest attaching to ancient chronicles is due to the fact that they help to elucidate allusions in the Koran. As for the average uneducated peasant, his views about the universe are of the very simplest. He peoples the regions of the air with spirits and fairies who dwell in distant realms known as keinderaan , where the great divinity Indra amuses himself with the heavenly nymphs, and keyangan (historically the heaven of Siva), which he believes to resemble keinderaan except in some details that he is not in a position to explain. He believes these fairylands to lie beyond the clouds at several days' journey from us across a great airy interspace; he considers also that they resemble the earth in so far that they possess forests and tigers as well as the glorious palaces and dancing-grounds of the Gods. He does not trouble himself about the movements of the sun or the supports of the earth; it is enough for him that the world is stable and that there is sufficient regularity about the actions of the heavenly bodies to justify his confidence in them. Eclipses, which constitute the one eccentricity of which the great luminaries are guilty in his eyes, he explains by supposing that a great dragon or snake, Rahu, makes periodical efforts to swallow the sun and moon, but it is extremely improbable that he attaches any real importance to the noisy demonstrations by which the monster is to be frightened away. Thunderbolts are more terrifying; he believes them to be real missiles of which the points are the prehistoric stone weapons occasionally found in the Peninsula. Other natural phenomena he simply sets down as the work of evil spirits. The Malay peasant believes that far away in the great ocean there lies a shallow sunken bank, the relic of an old Atlantis, upon which there grows a wonderful coconut tree, the Pauh Janggi , that drops its fruit upon the waters. Near the roots of this tree there is a gigantic cave or hollow, "the navel of the seas", in which there lives a monstrous crab; to the rush of water caused by the movements of the crab, the Malay fisherman attributes the cause of the tides. This old Atlantis is said to have been the home of genii whom its submersion scattered over the face of the earth much to the annoyance and distress of humanity. Of 1 Wasiat nabi. This really means that the Prophet is alleged to appear to some one in a dream and so, though dead, to give advice regarding the affairs of the present day. 22</page><page sequence="24">the true size of the world and of the might and wealth of the nations, the average Malay has no idea whatever. He pictures England to himself as an enlarged Malaya in which all the conditions of tropical life are reproduced: "there must be Malays there", he contends, "for, if not, who would there be to plant rice?" Holland is another England; Turkey is an England glorified by the acceptance of the true religion. India is a continent divided into the "Kling country" producing coolies and money-lenders, the "Bengali country" producing Sikh policemen, and the "land of Bombay" which is vaguely associated with penal servitude. Germany, Arabia, China, Japan, Siam, Burma, Java, Manila, and certain portions of Sumatra, of Borneo and of Celebes are also vaguely known through their representatives dwelling in Malaya. The rest of the world is a mere blank. Of history, the Malay peasant knows nothing. He believes the ages to be divided into two periods: the golden age and the present age. In the golden age, birds and animals could talk, heroes and fair princesses enacted in real life the wildest dreams of romance, and mighty magicians, such as Sang Kelembcd, walked the earth turning all that opposed them into stone, as indeed many a rock testifieth to this day. That age is past; the glory of Malaya is departed and her children have fallen upon evil days. So dreams the peasant; nor is it altogether wise to make light of these unhistorical imaginations, for it is on the contrast between this golden past and the inglorious present that the fanatic and the agitator base their most passionate appeals. 23</page><page sequence="25">IV. BELIEFS REGARDING LIFE AND LIVING THINGS T^HE Malays have borrowed from several distinct traditions their beliefs regarding the mystery of the creation of life. The more religious among them base their opinions upon the vague assertion of the Koran that man is generated from "a single drop of blood". The more ignorant of the peasantry of the Peninsula consider the father to be more important than the mother; they argue more or less as Apollo argued in the "Eumenides." The Malays of antiquity seem to have held a very different view; they looked upon the mother as the predominant influence upon the personality of a child. In one old romance, the Hikayat Indera Mengindera , we read that when a prince of the heavens wished to be born as the son of an earthly king he transformed himself into a mushroom or into some other object of the same sort, and inspired his intended mother with a passionate desire to eat him. Some of the aboriginal tribes of Malaya still hold the belief that the souls of men are incarnate in the form of birds and are born into the world through the birds being eaten by women. A theory of the same kind seems to underlie the curiously important part played in Malay romance by the "longings" (idam) of pregnant women. The more educated Malay of the present day attributes the generation of life to the fusion of three vital elements1 which exist separately at first, but finally unite in the mother to form or to complete the embryo.2 These three elements bear Arabic names that are often mentioned in the incantations of magicians; the names are also known to other Indonesian races such as the Bugis of Celebes, and their functions are explained in a curious Malay poem, the Shaer lbarat Manikam Pari . From another standpoint, life is created by the union of body and soul. We are told that God sent Adam g. soul by the hands of Gabriel; that it entered the body by the mouth; that, when it reached the throat, Adam sneezed; that, when it arrived in the stomach, Adam became fully conscious but found that his feet were still feet of clay; and that only when the soul had permeated the whole body, was Adam able to rise up and walk. From a traditional saying of the Prophet we learn that he considered the soul to be the smallest of all created things. In dealing with these legends regarding the origin of existence it is necessary to be extremely careful in the use of such expressions as "soul" and "life", and to use the Malay equivalents for such expressions with strict reference to the religious associations with which they are invested. The modern Christian defines the soul as the immortal essence which at first resides temporarily in the human body and afterwards lives eternally in heaven or hell. The same definition ought to appeal to Moslems since they have derived the idea of the soul from the same religious sources as our own. Unfortunately, however, this explanation 1 Wadzi, mani, madzi. 2 Manikam or jauhar. 24</page><page sequence="26">of the character of the soul presents the very greatest difficulties if we are to assume its identity with early beliefs. The union of soul and body may explain the life of man but it does not throw any light upon the nature of life in other animals. The doctrine of the resurrection of the body seems somewhat superfluous if it was originally believed that the spirit alone would live eternally in hell or heaven. Finally, the conditions of the period of existence between the day of death and the day of judgment suggest very serious problems, especially if taken in conjunction with certain Moslem theories on the subject. Muhammadans all agree that the very angels of heaven shall perish when Asrafel sounds the last trump, that Death himself shall be the last to die, and that God shall then bring the dead to life and judge between the just and the unjust. It seems difficult to assume that this doctrine contemplated the souls of men being alive while the angels were being slain by Death; - the ancient belief seems rather to have been that the soul was only a spirit of life, the common possession of all animate things, that the Angel of Death removed this Spark and destroyed all consciousness till the resurrection of the body, that God would restore life to the bodies of men but not to those of other animals, and lastly that He would decree eternal life or everlasting punishment for these new-risen or newly- created corporeal forms. The Malays themselves are extremely vague in their terminology regarding the future existence of the soul. When giving a funeral feast in honour of the dead, they speak of the deceased as arwah , an Arabic expression suggestive of the breath of human life rather than of immortality; when they speak of a soul in relation to its heavenly existence, they use words like malaikat (angel) or terms like nyawa and semangat which have highly-specialized non-Muhammadan meanings of their own. There is no word by which the English idea of a soul can really be translated into Malay. The Hindu belief in re-incarnation seems to have been once held by the Malays. The Indian spirit or soul, which passed from body to body and from life to life, was known as sokma , and the body as raga, - Sanskrit expressions which only survive in literature. The term for being re-incarnated, menjelema , is widely used and understood; it occurs con- tinually in lyric poetry whenever a passionate lover wishes to assure his beloved that even in future earthly lives he would be true to her. Nor is this the only instance of a feature of Hindu belief owing its survival to its poetic beauty: the Malay suitor compares the revivifying influence of his beloved's presence to the "water of life" ( ayer utama jiwa) that Siva alone possessed, or to the "never fading flower" (bunga wijaya mala ) that could bring the dead to life. Indian philosophy has, on the other hand, had very little influence upon Malay thought; traces of the old Hindu religion are only to be found in the demonology, poetry, divination, and in certain portions of the romantic literature of the Peninsula. The spirit of life, - which, according to the ancient Indonesian belief, existed in all things, even in what we should now consider inanimate objects - is known as the semangat. It was not a "soul" in the modern English sense, since it was not the exclusive possession of mankind, its separation from the body did not necessarily mean death, and its nature may possibly not have been considered immortal. At the present day, if a Malay feels faint, he will describe his condition by 25</page><page sequence="27">saying that his "spirit of life" is weak or is "flying" from his body; he sometimes appeals to it to return: "hither, hither, bird of my soul". Or again, if a Malay lover wishes to influence the mind of a girl, he may seek to obtain control of her semangat , for he believes that this spirit of active and vigorous life must quit the body when the body sleeps and so be liable to capture by the use of magic arts. It is, however, in the ceremonies connected with the so-called "spirit of the rice-crops", that the peculiar characteristics of the semangat come out most clearly. The Malay considers it essential that the spirit of life should not depart from the rice intended for next year's sowing as otherwise the dead seed would fail to produce any crop whatever. He, therefore, approaches the standing rice-crops at harvest-time in a deprecatory manner; he addresses them in endearing terms; he offers propitiatory sacrifices; he fears that he may scare away the timorous "bird of life" by the sight of a weapon or the least sign of violence. He must reap the seed-rice, but he does it with a knife1 of peculiar shape such that the cruel blade is hidden away beneath the reaper's fingers and does not alarm the "soul of the rice". When once the seed-rice has been harvested, more expeditious reaping- tools may be employed, since it is clearly unnecessary to retain the spirit of life in grain that is only intended for the cooking-pot. Similar rites attend all the processes of rice-cultivation - the sowing and the planting- out as well as the harvest, - for at each of these stages there is a risk that the vitality of the crop may be ruined if the bird of life is scared away. In the language used by the high-priests of these very ancient ceremonies we constantly find references to Sri (the Hindu Goddess of the Crops), to the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, and to Adam who, according to Moslem tradition, was the first planter of cereals; - many of these references only represent the attempts of the conservative Malays to make their old religions harmonize with later beliefs. Beneath successive layers of religious veneer, we see the animism of the old Indonesians, the theory of a bird-spirit of life, and the characteristic view that the best protection against evil lies in gentleness and courtesy to all animate and inanimate things. It is not clear that the old Indonesians actually believed in the immortality of the semangat. They must have had some faith in a future existence from the great care they obviously took to avoid the vengeance of any animal whose life they destroyed, but the spirits of the dead that they propitiated appear to have invariably been spirits of revenge. We have no evidence of any rites paid to the souls of departed ancestors, nor do we find any trace of a belief in the continued ghostly existence of great magicians such as Sang Kelembai whose fame still fills the folklore of many districts and whose spirit might perhaps have been expected to haunt the scene of his exploits. It may have been the case that the Indonesian "bird of life" was believed to die in the fullness of time along with the body to which it was attached, and that it only survived as a spirit of vengeance when its master was prematurely slain. The hells and paradises of the modern Malay - naraka, jahannam , shurga, keinderaan , and keyangan - are all borrowed from foreign religions. A curious old tradition speaks of the semangat as being sevenfold, as though a man was once believed to have seven souls. Any explanation of this tradition must be entirely conjectural; the fondness 1 The tuai. 26</page><page sequence="28">of the Malays for certain figures, such as seven and forty-four, makes it extremely doubtful whether the theory of the seven souls is based on anything more serious than a love for lucky numbers. By all Malays - whether orthodox Moslems or not - it is believed that evil spirits are specially potent and active throughout the period of gestation, and, most of all, at the moment of generation and the moment of delivery. Prayers must be uttered to avert evil influences; prickly branches are hung over the door at the time of a confinement in order that terrible demons, such as the penanggalan , should be scared away by the fear that their trailing viscera may be caught in the thorny clusters; taboos of the strictest character are imposed on the acts of both the father and the mother of an unborn child. An expectant father may not shave nor cut his hair; he may not take life nor maim a living thing; he may not even sit on his own door-step to gossip with the neighbours. Some of these taboos are intelligible enough: the fallen locks of hair may be used in processes of quasi-sympathetic magic, and the injury done to a living thing may bring retaliation in kind upon the child of the man who did the wrong. Others are not so readily explained, as, for example, the peculiar prejudice against severance or division, instanced in the objection to "dividing" a house by a stranger entering at one door and departing by another. The occurrence of an eclipse of the sun or moon is believed by Malays to place pregnant women in a position of exceptional danger, - why, it is impossible to say. Everything unites in the Peninsula to make the people view the period of gestation as one of terrible risk: Muhammadanism so considers it; Hinduism so regarded it; the old Indonesian belief in the generation of evil spirits from the souls of unborn children and from the products of childbirth such as the caul and the placenta made a confinement a time of spiritual terror. After the first few days of life, a child's special liability to the attacks of demons seems - according to Malay belief - to considerably diminish. A few ceremonies for protection against evil spirits at the time of the ritual shaving of a child's head or at the time of circumcision suggest that those occasions are also periods of danger; but, speaking generally, the magical practices which attend almost every incident in Malay life do not imply that the man is exceptionally weak at such times. He recognizes that his possible foes are many and powerful, and he wishes to avert their enmity in every possible way. Of his methods in dealing with evil spirits we shall speak in the next chapter. At this point it will suffice to say that special exposure to danger is believed to occur whenever portions of a man - such as the hair or the nails - are severed from the parent body, the theory being that injury to such discarded portions may in some way be used to affect the living body itself. A Malay husband, if he found his wife treasuring up a lock of his hair, would regard her conduct with extreme suspicion. Sleep is also con- sidered a time of special peril owing to the supposition that the spirit of life is absent from a slumbering body and may be injured by too abrupt a recall. Sickness indicates the presence of demons. Certain periods of time are unpropitious: Friday, for instance, is unlucky because demons are said to be exceptionally numerous and active on that day, and serpents are then believed to renew their stock of venom. The time and manner of death and even the conduct of the funeral ceremonies are supposed to exercise a very material influence upon the future state of 27</page><page sequence="29">the soul. Malays have inherited, for reasons already explained, a horror of premature death: death by violence or by drowning makes a man a malignant spirit; death in childbirth makes a woman a vampire. The feeling goes further: the Malays show none of that peculiar indifference to death which is characteristic of the Chinese and the Japanese peoples; on the contrary, like the ancient Greeks, they have a horror of perishing, and especially of perishing without the proper funeral rites. Death himself is a monster, such that the very angels of heaven fainted at the sight of him; he is a symbol of terror: "like the Death-angel when taking a human life". The departing soul does not gladly soar to a better world; it lingers weeping by the side of the tomb, longing to return once more to the earth. Such a feeling is quite alien to Islam; it indicates that the Indonesian ancestors of the Peninsular Malays took a very gloomy view indeed of the immortality of the soul. There is no trace whatever of any belief in happy hunting-grounds or in Elysian fields reserved for the spirits of the departed. The old Indonesian theory that animals and even trees and stones possess "souls" of their own narrows very considerably, in native minds, the gulf that separates humanity from the brute creation. The Malays believe that all animals could or can speak, that tigers seek their victims by divination, that elephants have a kingdom of their own far away in the North of the Peninsula, that many beasts are only men in animal shape, that the wild dogs use magic to capture their prey, that many animals (such as the wild boar and the orang-outang) occasionally possess talismans which render them invulnerable, that serpents use bezoar-stones to light their way at night, that most animals, plants and even minerals understand Malay, and that grains of alluvial tin may be driven by insult or ill-treatment to desert the bed of a stream. Much of the magic of the jungle is based on the supposition that plants and animals think and act as men. As a rule the peasants of the Peninsula are keen and accurate in their observation of animal life but are extremely unhappy in their inferences. They have noticed, for instance, that man-eating tigers have the great canine teeth almost entirely worn away; they infer from this that the loss of the teeth is a punishment for man-eating, and not that the beast is driven by the loss of his weapons to the desperately dangerous expedient of preying on man. They also observe that venomous snakes have stumpy tails, and they assumue that the use of venom causes the tail to drop off. They see that a certain bird (the racquet-tailed drongo, dissemurus platurus) follows the long-tailed monkeys to prey on the insects disturbed by the shaking of the boughs as the animals leap from tree to tree; they conclude that the bird is the slave or herdsman of the monkeys. They find pieces of iron - the tools of some long-forgotten immigrant mining race - in the vicinity of the lair of a wild-boar; they infer that the iron belonged to the wild-boar. They note the abundant existence of gall-stones in a python and of stones in the stomach of a crocodile; they invent theories to explain the use of the stones. They see that the sex of crocodiles is outwardly indistinguishable; they believe that the male crocodile is never caught by man. They observe the various changes in coloration that accompany the growth of certain animals such as the tapir, the wild boar, and the hamadryad; they treat the variations as representing distinct animals. They notice the marks on a deer's legs and explain them by assuming that the deer was once a man and suffered 28</page><page sequence="30">from ulcers. They trace a certain resemblance between an imported antelope-horn and the horn of the unicorn on the English coat-of-arms; they infer the identity of the two. The result of all this accurate obser- vation and inaccurate inference is that the Malays possess very complete scientific lists of names of birds, animals and plants together with a quantity of animal folklore of very variable value. The wealth of Malay nomenclature in the province of natural history is in itself a fruitful source of error. The identity of different dialectic names for the same animal is not always recognized; the local name is taken to represent the real animal, the foreign name is assumed to represent a rare or fabulous variety of the same genus. Moreover the tales of hunters and fishermen rarely lose in the telling. "The snakes of today are not as the snakes of my youth", - an old Malay once observed. "I was walking one day over a pass when I noticed a hamadryad crossing the road, his head being hidden in the bushes on one side and his tail being lost in the bushes on the other. As I dared not step across him, I waited for him to pass, - and it was three quarters of an hour before the last of that animal's tail had disappeared from my path". There are many instances of the names of real animals being invested with fabulous qualities through the exaggerations of tradition. The legends of the orang- outang (mowas) and of the water-snake (ular bidai) have already been mentioned as giving rise to the belief in certain kinds of evil spirits. Other instances are the whale, the sea-serpent and the fiery rhinoceros. The whale is known as the "sea-elephant"1, and owing to its rarity is invested with many elephantine attributes by people who have never seen it; we hear, for instance, in Malay poetry of a whale from the Sea of Acheh which "entered the jungle and broke its tusks". The sea-snakes (which abound in the Eastern seas and are very venomous) are known in certain coast-districts as ular belera and in others as ular selimpat , - the names in both cases being suggested by the flattened shape of these serpents' tails; but the people who know them as ular selimpat , believe the ular belerang (as they call it) to be a more venomous sea-snake still, - so venomous, indeed, that, if it bites a boat's rudder, it can kill the whole boat's crew. It is difficult to trace the exact origin of the belief in the fiery rhinoceros, but exaggeration has invested it with long red hair, with a phosphorescent horn and with singularly savage qualities. The Malays have derived from Indian literature a belief in several kinds of dragons: the naga umbang , or great sea-serpent, the naga anta- boga or great serpent that enfolds the world, the naga bora , which kills its prey by spitting out a deadly venom that slays whatever it touches, the naga api9 or fire-breathing dragon, and the naga gentala, or monster dragon which never moves but simply sucks in its prey by drawing in its breath. From the same source, the natives of the Peninsula have derived their faith in the existence of certain fabulous birds: the garuda , or eagle which bore the chariot of Vishnu suspended from its talons, the walimana or harpy (the human-headed winged steed of the great Earth- demon), the chentayu , a mythical bird that lived on dew over the fall of which it exercised a certain control, and the chandrawaseh , which is now clothed with the legendary attributes of the bird of paradise. The Malays also believe in the existence of a peculiar gold-yellow snake of very small size to which they give the Sanskrit name of chintamani : the 1 Gajah mina. 29</page><page sequence="31">finding of this snake is believed to be token success in love. It is possible that the peculiar attributes of this snake are explicable by an indecent interpretation of its name. The Malays believe that certain men - notably the inhabitants of the Korinchi districts in Sumatra - have the power of transforming themselves into tigers. Cases of metamorphosis into other animals such as dragons, apes, elephants and crocodiles, are recorded in literature or belong to folklore, but such cases are looked upon as miraculous or exceptional, whereas the transformation of Korinchi men into tigers is considered to be a matter of everyday occurrence. All such animals are looked upon as sacred or invulnerable. In a few places a connection is traced between local families and particular mammals, birds or fish, - members of a family being forbidden to eat of the flesh of the animals with which they are associated; the origin of this custom is obscure. A certain number of animals are looked upon as ominous, unlucky or unclean. The dog is unclean and unlucky; he is supposed to look forward to the day when he will crunch the bones from his master's funeral feast. The cat is associated with rain; to give a cat a bath is said to bring on rain. The peacock and the argus-pheasant are looked upon as unclean. It is possible that some of these superstitions have a Moslem origin, as the peacock is believed to have guided the serpent to the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden, while the cat is said, like the pig, to have been created during the sojourn of Noah in the Ark. There are also curious beliefs associated with the origin of certain animals. The crocodile is said to have been created and cursed by Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet, who made the reptile's backbone out of sugar- cane joints and its tail out of the midrib of a palm. In all probability the name of Fatimah is only used to cloak a very ancient legend of the origin of the beast. A flatfish resembling the sole is said to have been created from the discarded remnants of a fish half -eaten by Muhammad and is still known by the name of the relics of the Prophet's meal (ma nabi ). There are similar stories regarding the creation of several kinds of fish. In the naming of real animals the Malays are usually accurate and observant; they err rather on the side of over-elaborate classification. They possess over 500 names of fish and over 500 names of birds, and, even if we allow for dialectic variations, it is quite clear that their lists must be fairly complete. They possess both generic and specific names; they class, for instance, all the larger felidae under the generic name of harimau and the smaller under the generic name of kuching , and then proceed to distinguish between them by specific descriptive names. They give the generic name rusa to all the larger deer whatever their appear- ance, but distinguish from them the barking-deer and the chevrotins. It is interesting also to note that the Malays recognize only one variety of the larger chevrotin, tragulus napu , but several of the smaller, tragulus pygmceus ; this is in entire accordance with the views of American zoologists. The Malays apply one generic name to both the tapir and rhinoceros; but the descriptive names applied to the species are very numerous. For smaller mammals they have a large number of names, especially under the generic musang ( viverridce ), tupcu (which includes all the varieties of the sciurus and of the tupaia) and tikus (which includes all rats and mice except the bamboo-rat to which a special name is given). 30</page><page sequence="32">The Malays distinguish between at least two bears though only one seems to be known to science, and recognize a number of monkeys which are not always to be definitely identified. In the matter of reptiles, Malay nomenclature is fairly complete. The gavial and the crocodiles are included under one generic name though the specific difference is every- where recognized. The lizards go by many names: the house-lizards, the flying-lizards, the skinks and the so-called chameleons ( callotes ) have all separate generic names. The various turtles and tortoises are classified with considerable accuracy; in fact, the wealth of native names suggests that one or two of this class of reptiles have yet to be identified by European scientists. Frogs and toads are classed together, but descriptive names are given to the most important varieties. The names of snakes are very confusing owing to dialectic divergences, and are unsatisfactory from a scientific standpoint, but European methods of classifying snakes are far too technical to be expected of any Asiatic race however observant. Birds are extremely well divided up: the generic names for birds of prey (hawks, kites and eagles), for kingfishers, for barbets, for woodpeckers, and for trogons being all most accurately used. The same accuracy is observable in the Malay names of fishes, though the sharks and the rays are in a few instances confused. The names of shells and shell-fish vary a good deal and are known to comparatively few people. The tiger is the most feared of Peninsular mammals; he represents the type of ferocity in native proverbs and legends. A distinction is drawn between the tiger and the tigress in the way the two kill their prey: the former is said to break the neck, the latter to bite through it. The other mammals do not seem to inspire any terror among the peasantry of the Peninsula though many would be dangerous if hunted or attacked. Reptiles rouse great alarm. Crocodiles claim a much longer roll of victims than the tiger; while the more deadly serpents (though snake-bite is of rare occurrence) are feared above all animals owing to the sudden- ness and certainty of the death that they inflict. The hamadryad is considered to be the most venomous - perhaps because of its size, - and the banded karait ( bungarus fasciatus ) is thought almost equally deadly. Scorpions and centipedes are not considered specially dangerous to life, but a large black and yellow spider (pesan-pesan) and a mouse- coloured bird-spider with short legs (laba-laba berok ) are believed to destroy human life. In the department of fables and folk-tales, the smaller chevrotin is the "king of the forest"; he represents the triumph of guile over the brute force of the tiger, the elephant, the shark, and the crocodile. He plays the same part in Sumatra, Java and Borneo, and yet the wiliness of this little animal is not very remarkable and is certainly insufficient to prevent his being easily captured by man. He seems to owe his reputation to his small size and apparent defencelessness, - features which would render his survival amid the terrors of the forest inexplicable except on the supposition that he possesses more than an average share of brains. His very insignificance adds to the point of the fable and lends a certain piquancy to the story of his triumphs. 31</page><page sequence="33">V. BELIEFS REGARDING SCIENCE AND MAGIC QRTHODOX Muhammadans believe that all knowledge is included in theology, - but this only means that they consider any science to be unworthy of attention if it cannot be studied on theological lines. Law is theology because the only law that the devout recognize is religious law. Medicine is theology because the recovery of the patient has to be expedited by prayers and religious amulets. Any "science" whatever - be it natural history or divination or the interpretation of dreams - must be illuminated by religious texts and arguments if it is to carry conviction to the minds of its readers. Even the most disgusting pamphlets on obscene subjects are full of religious references; the European student is sometimes startled to find a Moslem writer plunge into sacred metaphors where an Englishman would, for decency's sake, use no lang- uage more definite than that of asterisks. Some of this revolting misuse of theology is rank hypocrisy such as we find in Europe when works like literal translations of the Arabian Nights are published or read "in the interests of science" by people who are in no way connected with Eastern studies. Generally speaking, however, the religious spirit inspiring Moslem books is not a mere pretence; it shows that the author honestly chooses to base his reasoning upon God's word rather than upon the fallible experiments and observations of men. We need not criticize too severely this mental attitude; it is bad for scientific research but has the merit of creating earnest and devoted men. The Indonesian sections of the Muhammadan world care very little about abstract science. The average Malay is interested in medicine, divination and the Black Art, - in the first because it concerns his health, and in the last two because he thinks that he sees in them an easy road to prosperity and wealth. A native doctor usually learns his art by apprenticeship to some other physician - in most cases a near relative of his own. He accom- panies his teacher from patient to patient and gradually learns something about the symptoms of disease and the properties of medicinal plants. His pharmacopcea is limited: - an aperient or two, a few simples for curing skin diseases, some styptics for checking the flow of blood, various vegetable products consumed by women to expedite delivery, three or four kinds of cosmetics for cooling the skin, and a few things (like the skin of the mangosteen fruit) which he uses to stop diarrhoea. He knows a little about the rules of diet, and also about fomentations and massage. Needless to say he also acquires a thorough knowledge of the weaknesses of human nature. Any Malay who practised his medical art in all its naked simplicity would, professionally speaking, come to a bad end. He would betray his methods at once to his rivals and he would fail to satisfy his patients who expect more ceremonious treatment for their complaints than a mere order to swallow an aperient or to limit their consumption of curry and rice. He is therefore compelled to divert 32</page><page sequence="34">attention from his real medicines by mixing them up with other drugs, by seeming to trust to incantations, by dwelling on minor issues (such as the exact moment at which the remedy should be applied), by pre- tending to produce from the patients body needles or insects which he alleges to be causes of disease, and by many other proceedings which are deliberately intended to deceive. His treatment of a disease seems to vary with every case, but in real essentials it remains the same. His dodges perplex or mislead rival practitioners, while they delight his patients with the special attention that he appears to be devoting to their individual needs. Unfortunately the deception does not always end there. It sometimes happens that a European observer is looking on, noting down the sham remedies, overlooking the real, and drawing worthless conclusions from the little comedy that has been deliberately got up to throw dust in his eyes. Malay medicine is not to be studied merely by the observation of isolated examples of its practice. The healing art, as practised in the Peninsula, may be divided under three heads. The first (and most important) is the treatment of disease by the use of the simple remedies known to the natives. The second (and most primitive) assumes an illness to be the work of demons and addresses itself directly to the work of exorcism. The third deals with the protective or curative value of religious talismans and amulets. Of these three branches, the first is too technical to be dealt with in this work,1 and the second belongs really to the province of demonology. The procedure of a witch-doctor usually begins with a diagnosis or endeavour to find out what particular evil spirit is affecting the patient; when the demon has been identified, he is either induced by prayers and offerings to quit his victim's body or else he is driven out of it by threats and by the performance of things that he dislikes. This form of sorcery is condemned as impious by good Muhammadans and is only resorted to in very extreme cases. The third of the branches of medicine already alluded to corresponds in some ways to our "Christian Science": prayer and faith take the place of drugs; a text from the Koran is usually washed in water and the water is drunk by the patient. Connected with this belief in the sacro-sanctity of certain objects is the wearing of protective amulets - usually texts - by Malay children whom it is desired to defend against certain illnesses. There exists also a practice (often disgusting in its details) of consuming portions of the flesh of tigers, pythons, and other animals with a view to acquiring courage, health, sexual power, or any other quality ascribed by popular superstition to the beasts in question. Of divination there are many forms. There is the gift of second sight which is believed to be innate in certain individuals such as Tengku Temena (in the story of Abdullah's voyage to Kelantan) who came down to speed his parting guests and, after gazing abstractedly into space, predicted that the journey would be safe and prosperous, as indeed it was. Few persons are credited with the actual gift of prophecy ascribed to Tengku Temena; the Malay augur prefers to trust to calculations and books. The most common method of taking the auspices is based upon the use of magic squares or tables of lucky and unlucky times: the "five ominous times" or periods during which the influences of old Hindu divinities are predominant, the "seven ominous times" which are ruled by the great heavenly bodies, and other "travel time-tables" ( ketika 1 A good account of this subject is found in "The Achehnese", II. 47-53. 33</page><page sequence="35">langkah) involving intricate calculations from Koran texts and calendars. Besides these influences on the fortunes of the day, we have the "Rejangs" (a series of symbols for each day of the month), the Rijalu'l- ghaib or invisible saipts whose position in the heavens affects the omens, the Jaguni or Sanskrit Yogini who play a part somewhat similar to that of the Rijalu'l-ghaib , and the "castles" or signs of the zodiac, the functions of which belong to true astrology. We have also the use made of ominous occurrences and of the interpretation of dreams. Apart, however, from the primitive "Rejang" calendar, from the belief that certain things are lucky or unlucky, and from the faith in second-sight, very little of the extensive lore of divination is of Indonesian origin. The cloudy skies of the Eastern Islands do not lend themselves to the study of the stars; astrologers (ahlu'n-nujum) only occur in romance; horoscopic calculations on sand are so little understood by native romance-writers that the word for "sand" ( ramal) is believed to mean "treatise" or "astrological table"; while the names of presiding influences in the tables of lucky and unlucky times are all foreign. Nevertheless, the "science" of divination has taken so firm a hold of the natives of the Peninsula that its foreign origin has been entirely lost sight of. It cannot be passed over in silence; it has become a national belief. The practice of magic arts enters into every department of Malay life. If (as the people of the Peninsula believe) all nature is teeming with spiritual life, some spiritual weapon is necessary to protect man against possible ghostly foes.. Now the chief and most characteristic weapon of the Malay in his fight against the invisible world is courtesy. The peasant will speak no evil of a tiger in the jungle or of an evil spirit within the limits of that spirit's authority. The great demon of the tideways ( Mambang Tali Harus) is essentially wicked, but he is the "Ruler of the Sea" ( raja di-laut) and must be treated with the deference due to kings. The wandering spirits of the waters which prey on drowning men are obviously cruel, but the Malay does not presume to sit in judgment on their actions; he claims blood-brotherhood with them. The Hindu divinity, Siva or Betara Guru, is a mere devil from the Moslem stand- point; yet the Malay addresses him as "grandsire" and begs for his favour to his children. It is the same with the demon-king of the jungles when the wizard invokes him: "I crave pardon for all my errors, "For all shortcomings I crave pardon; "Peace be with you, Lord of the Forests." The tiger is the symbol of kingly oppression; still, he is royal and must not be insulted; he is the "shaggy-haired father" or "grandfather" of the traveller in the woods. Even the birds, the fish and the fruits that serve as human food are entitled to a certain consideration: the deer is addressed as a "prince", the coconut-tree as a "princess", the chevrotin as "emperor of the jungle" (shah alam di-rimba). In all this respect paid to unseen powers - for it is the soul of the animal or plant that is feared - there is no contemptible adulation or cringeing; the Malay believes that courtesy honours the speaker more than the person addressed. The "kindly words and gentle ways" (bahasa) with which the magician makes his appeal to the spirits of the jungle are often accom- panied by small, gifts of food, drink and even money. In bygone years 34</page><page sequence="36">these offerings may have been of value and may have been intended as bribes or rewards; at the present time they are purely formal presentations and are symbolic of the donor's courteous good-will or of his submission to the higher powers. They consist of food of many kinds so that the gift may be adapted to the taste of every spirit, however coarse or fastidious that spirit's appetite may be; raw flesh is provided as well as cooked flesh, black fowls as well as white, vegetable as well as animal food, spirituous liquor for the gnomes of the mines and copper money for the sacrificial ships (lanchang) on which the demons of a district are borne away to sea. Incense is burnt, lustration is practised, rice is scattered about, and "neutralizing rice-paste" (tepong tawar) is used to sterilize the active elements of ill-luck. We have here all the features of what must once have been an elaborate system of ceremonial, but realities have given place to forms and true gifts have been replaced by simple marks of courtesy and homage. The laws of politeness are believed to be binding on all things. A being that can be wronged must none the less be treated with formal respect. Certainly no decent Malay sparrow would have ever so far forgotten himself as to plead guilty to the slaughter of poor Cock-robin; his reverence for the ghost of the deceased bird would make the nursery-rhyme run somewhat as follows: "Who killed Cock-robin ?" "Not I", said the sparrow, "But the Bow and Arrow, "They killed Cock-robin". Even the crocodile has to excuse himself when he drowns a victim; he must rise to the surface and call the sun, moon and stars to witness: "it was not I that killed him, "it was water that killed him". While courtesy is the national weapon of the Malay in his dealings with the unseen world, it is not his only means of defence. The native of the Peninsula believes that an esoteric knowledge of the origin of any being gives the possessor of that knowledge an extraordinary power. A sorcerer who wishes to force some man or woman to do his will has only to refer to the mysterious elements which go to make up the human embryo; if he wishes to control a demon, he alludes to the theory of its generation from the placenta and other concomitants of childbirth; if he wishes to overawe a crocodile he tells it that he knows its origin: "I know the source from which you spring, "To the Prophet's child you owe your life; "Your form she kneaded in glutinous clay, "Your bones she framed from sugar-cane knots, "Your head from the root of a coconut palm, "Your blood from saffron, your eyes from stars".1 Even the iron-worker is supposed to be fully conversant with the essential character of the metal that he manipulates; tradition has it that the craftsmen of old were thus enabled to mould steel as though it was wax and to leave the imprint of their fingers on certain daggers (keris pichit) which have become the heir-looms of royalty. Akin to this view regarding the powers conferred by esoteric knowledge is the further belief that if a 1 See Skeat's "Malay Magic", p. 624. 35</page><page sequence="37">man knows exactly what an animal blindly fears, he can (by personation or suggestion) terrorize that animal into abject submission. The trapper appeals to his prey in the name of God's Prophet Solomon (the legendary lord of the animal world), or in the name of the Almighty, or in the name of the Mussulman creed, or in the name of Muhammad himself. He sometimes claims great powers or attributes: "I am God's Prophet Solomon", or again: "I am the equal of the Archangels, "I sit upon God's Judgment-seat, "And lean on the pillar of God's Throne of Glory". He threatens the unwilling with the things that they most fear: "At sea, you shall get no drink, "On shore, you shall get no food"; or again: "If you do not come hither at once, "You shall be counted a traitor to God, "And a rebel against His Prophet Solomon". More logical than the supposition that special forms of knowledge give supernatural power is the view that knowledge is in itself a power since it enables man to avail himself of the forces of nature or of the unseen world. Spirits, like men, are supposed to have their likes and their dislikes; some ghosts hate the sight of certain plants such as the gandarusa ( insticia gandarusa); the gnomes in mining-land object to limes; the Demon-Lord of the Tideways vanishes at the threat of indecency. Knowledge of these little details helps the magician to scare away an unwelcome ghostly visitor. Let us suppose that a district is overpopulated with spirits of misfortune or disease, - the sorcerer calls together the inhabitants for a mimic battle and drives out the demons by the power of numbers and noise; or else he tempts his unseen foes on board a model ship where they find every luxury that appeals to their ghostly palates, - and then he cuts the vessel adrift to float down the river to the sea and to sail away to the original home of all spirits, the Sunken Bank at the Navel of the Seas, the place where the double-coconut grows. Woe betide the unfortunate man who picks up a vessel with such a terrible crew! Or, again, the magician may "indicate"1 some person to receive the special attention of spirits of disease, much as a man sets his dogs upon an enemy. Sometimes by the use of a waxen or other image, or by the exhibition of a "sample" such as the parings of a man's nails or the clippings of his hair, the wizard conveys to the world of ghosts a knowledge of the person he wishes them to attack - and the ghosts are ever ready to profit by the hint so kindly given. Here the practices of Malay witchcraft come very close to sympathetic magic - to the view that there is "a certain physical sympathy between a person and his image": "It is not wax that I am melting "But the liver, heart and spleen of So-and-So". Nevertheless there is a marked difference between the animistic magic of the Malays and the "sympathetic magic" defined in Frazer's "Golden 1 MSnuju. 36</page><page sequence="38">Bough" and accepted by Mr. Skeat as the explanation of the use of waxen images in the Peninsula. The folllowing invocation (quoted by Mr. Skeat himself) shows the real nature of the practice: "Salutation to thee, Oh Prophet! Ruler of the World! "Lo! I am burying the corpse of So-and-So. "Do you assist in killing him or making him sick". The actions of the sorcerer merely illustrate or indicate to the spirits the exact nature of the service that he expects of them. If these performances were really based on a belief in "a certain physical sympathy between the person and his image" it would be unnecessary to invoke the spirits at all. The Malays also accept the theory, derived (in part, at least) from their Hindu ancestors, that asceticism {tapa) confers supernatural power. In old romances we read of heroes who, after practising incredible austerities for enormous periods of time, succeeded in making themselves invulnerable or invincible in war. An encounter between two such warriors may be described as more than homeric; the combatants turned themselves into giants or dragons and hurled thunderbolts or volcanoes at each other. Modern ascetics are content with more modest claims; they are generally impostors who pretend to go without food and assert that their privations enable them to cure diseases or to show where the riches of Koi;ah or Solomon are hidden. Sometimes they are genuine fanatics with political or religious ambitions. In A.D. 1898 one of these adventurers, - known for his austerities as Teungku Tapa, - appeared in Acheh, represented himself as the incarnation of a legendary hero, secured a number of devoted followers, and gave some trouble to the Dutch before they succeeded in killing him in battle in A.D. 1900. The followers of schools of mysticism also claim to be exempt from the pain of wounds and attribute this freedom to their habits of prayer, fasting and ecstatic devotional exercises. Religious frenzy can, in fact, bring about a certain indifference to suffering which is mistaken for immunity from pain and so creates a profound impression upon a credulous people. Where men believe implicitly in the miraculous, even the crudest forms of imposture may become dangers to the peace or prosperity of the community. In A.D. 1899 a swindler appeared in Malacca Claiming to possess a miraculous yeast ( taped ) which had the power of expanding banknotes into notes of higher denominations. He was promptly arrested, but the absurdity of the whole story from the European point of view caused the case to be laughed out of court. The man promptly claimed his acquittal as evidence of the bona-fides of his claims, and so imposed upon the peasantry that the unusual number of mortgages made by the victims of the fraud led to enquiry and again brought the matter to the attention of the District Officer. Every Eastern race believes firmly in the possibility of a man becoming invulnerable. This curious theory has to be reckoned with by Europeans because it is continually made use of by insurgent leaders to induce Asiatics to face the terrible engines of scientific warfare. Cases where warriors seem to lead "a charmed life" can always be quoted for the encouragement of the superstitious, while cases where magic has failed to act may be explained away as due to flaws or omissions in the processes by which invulnerability was to have been acquired. In any case the belief in this form of magic never dies; it has encouraged many 37</page><page sequence="39">a petty conflict in Acheh as well as the murderous rebellion of the Boxers. The Malays assert that there are several ways of securing immunity from serious wounds. In the first place, the body can become hard enough to be impenetrable to weapons and even impervious to decay after death; this peculiar hardness may be attained by any person born with a complete caul. Secondly, protection may be secured against all but superficial wounds if sufficient mercury is rubbed into the body, - the theory being that the pressure of a weapon or missile against the skin will cause the quicksilver to rush subcutaneously to the point of impact and so prevent any deep penetration. Again, the body can be made so slippery that any weapon glides off the treacherous cuticle and leaves the man unharmed. Finally we have the use of talismans which disturb an enemy's aim or paralyze his arm or shatter his missiles to fragments. The fabled mawas which has never been killed and the famous "lone boar" which escapes the gun of the sportsman must clearly owe their protection to a talisman or amulet, - the sharp steel of the arm of the mawas and the chain connecting the tusks of the lone boar. Great is the joy of the Malay who finds in the forest some piece of iron which he takes for one of these charms! In opposition to the art of securing invulnerability we have the art of overcoming it by countercharms - silver bullets or magic weapons guaranteed to defy any powers of witchcraft that may stand in their way.1 Modern Malay Magic is not exclusively animistic. Throughout the Peninsula we meet with examples of amulets and formulae which are considered to be sufficient (in themselves and without the intervention of spirits) to rouse love,2 to sow dissension between other parties,3 to silence the testimony of hostile witnesses, to reduce one's foes to submission,4 to create airy cavities in water so as to save a submerged man from being drowned,5 to obtain a favourable wind, to make oneself invisible, and even to secure good prices for one's goods.0 In some cases, no doubt, the efficacy of the talisman rests on the animistic theory that rare objects have soul-personalities of peculiar potency. In other cases the amulet owes its virtue to the sanctity of the Koran or of the holy attributes of God; indeed, a certain degree of supernatural power is believed to attach itself to the persons of saints or descendants of the Prophet, to the touch of a holy hand and even to the water in which a holy foot has been washed. Close as this idea comes to the ancient belief in the divine majesty of kings, the modern cult of holy men takes the form of a degenerate Muhammadanism and is based upon the theory that God manifests His power in the miracles performed by His chosen vessels. The ready acceptance of this belief (rather than the belief itself) is due to older Indonesian ideas. Some notice should be taken of the position of the wizard himself or "Pawang" as he is called. The Pawang is, in some respects, the lineal representative of the old priests of Siva; his office, like that of the Brahman, is hereditary, he is entitled to certain contributions from the villagers for whom he intercedes with the unseen world, he possesses "regalia" or insignia of office, he practises a few austerities and occasionally observes some degree of sexual purity. More than that, he often appeals directly to Betara Guru (Siva the Teacher) "the original 1 PSluru tunang. 2 pgngaseh. 3 pgmbgnchi. 4 Chucha or pSnundok. 5 Pgruang. Pilaris. 38</page><page sequence="40">teacher, who art from the beginning and art incarnate from thy birth", while the magnitude of his claims - "I am the equal of the Archangels, etc.", - is characteristic of the Brahman but would be rank blasphemy in a Moslem, and perilous arrogance in an Indonesian who speaks :apologetically even to the soul of a pigeon. It would, of course, be a mistake to push the analogy between the Pawang and the Brahman too far; the guiding principles of the old Hindu religion have been lost sight of by the modern Malay so that the magicians of the present time cannot distinguish between the more ancient and more modern elements in their formulae and ceremonies. The word pawang itself is not Hindu; it must date back to a still older creed and is now used of all practitioners who use the formulae of old religions in the pursuit of their daily avocations. A sailor, a fisherman or a trapper may be a pawang . Whatever claims a Malay wizard may put forward on his own behalf or on that of his fellow-sorcerers, the power of securing immortal life is not among them. Only one man is spoken of as immortal, the prophet Khizr who, when separated from the rest of Alexander's army in the gloomy regions at the base of Mount Kaf, came upon the Fountain of the Water of Life and inadvertently washed his luncheon of dried fish in it, thereby losing his meal (for the fish revived and swam away) but securing for himself an unending existence and giving rise, in all pro- bability, to the legend of the Wandering Jew. No one can now hope to emulate this success. A wizard, the Malays say, may become invulnerable, he may transform himself into an animal, he may preserve his body from decay, he may even (like Si-Ujut, the "Dutch infidel" of an Achehnese poem) be submerged for days under the keel of a sea-going ship and yet survive, - but, sooner or later, he must succumb to Death. While the "sciences"; of medicine, divination, invulnerability and magic are those which appeal most forcibly to the mind of the Malay peasant, the educated classes devote themselves to the more orthodox studies of religion, Arabic, Malay and mysticism. Men who devote long years to the study of unremunerative theological subjects and who are prepared to face persecution and even death in support of unpopular religious views, are by no means uncommon: many are to be found at Mecca, some travel even to Cairo and Constantinople in the pursuit of knowledge. Actual centres of theological study are rare in the Peninsula, Trengganu being perhaps the best known, but religious leaders with bands of earnest disciples are often met with, and controversies between rival mosques or schools of thought are frequent and bitter. The study iOf Muhammadan Law is a regular pursuit, and the more distinguished "Kalis" or native judges in matrimonial courts are often men of very considerable legal attainments. The study of palace-language and cere- monial is now dying out, as the introduction of new European elements into the etiquette of Sultan's courts is destroying the importance of a knowledge of precedents; evidence of the former popularity of this branch of research is visible in historical books such as the "Malay Annals" where the author dwells lovingly even on such minor details as the proper way of wearing a shoulder-cloth (tetampan) and the exact number and nature of the different musical instruments that went to make up a royal band. The interest in customary law is being given up, as English law tends to override it. The Malays are still intensely proud of their diction; one of their Sultans has spoken with envy of the creator 39</page><page sequence="41">of a single poetic expression, imbangan bayu , much as General Wolfe envied the authorship of Gray's "Elegy". Malay is, truly enough, a melodious language; the men who speak it are prone to refer rather contemptuously to the sound of other tongues, - to what they describe as the harsh 44 gro'-gra' " of the Kling, the nasal 44 chon-chen " of the Chinaman and the sibilant "kas-kus" of the English. A curious feature of the work of native students of language is their passion for words and especially for fanciful etymologies such as the theory that Singapura is derived from sungai pura , 44the river of cheats" (from the business done on Boat Quay), and Sumatra from sama utara, "equally North", from the fact that the Equator cuts it exactly in two. On the whole, however, the subjects that used to occupy the thoughts of the Malays of old are losing ground except in the domain of theolo- gical study. The native of the Peninsula is becoming less of a Malay and more of a Mussulman; his national ceremonies are being discarded, his racial laws are being set aside, and his inherited superstitions are opposed to Moslem belief as much as to Western science. His allegiance is being gradually transferred from national to Pan-islamic ideals and from the local Sultans, whose fettered dignity he compares to that of a "ship in the tow of a dinghy", to the Sultan d-muadzam , or Sultan par excellence, the now acknowledged head of one hundred millions of Moslems. Apart from possible elements of disloyalty and political danger, there are many deplorable features in the present abrupt lines of change. While English- made laws may be superior, in the abstract, to the customary or religious law of the Malays, they cannot command the respect which accompanied immemorial custom or divine injunction, they obviously rest on mere force, and their violation does not necessarily lower the criminal in the eyes of the community. Again, while there can be no question of the real value of European medical science, the execution of sanitary measures has often (it is to be feared) to be left to European doctors who, in ignorance, offend terribly against native custom, and to petty officials who have no belief in their work and simply take it up in order to prey upon native householders ignorant of what is wanted and only too willing to pay to be left alone. The very natural love of the people for their own language is combated or discouraged by individual English- men in order that it may not interfere with the spread of English; the love of a Malay for his own Sultanate is condemned as tending to perpetuate arbitrary territorial distinctions in what is now a federated whole; the love of a student for the history or literature of his country is ridiculed as a futile devotion to unimportant things. It is not too much to say that the average Englishman resident in the Malay Peninsula would consider it waste of time to attend to what he terms 4 "native prejudices". Yet racial dominion rests upon character, - not upon wealth, nor even upon intelligence. It is a matter of real regret that the patriotism of the Malays, their self-respect, their reverence for immemorial law, their loyalty to their rulers, their traditions of courtesy, and their love of study for its own sake, - things that contain the germs of national progress, - should be continually depreciated and dishonoured as not being "business". No economic prosperity need altogether blind us to the element of truth in the criticism passed by Socrates on certain admired types of statesmanship: "they have filled the city with markets, docks, and suchlike trash, instead of soberness of thought and strength of character." 40</page><page sequence="42">LIFE AND CUSTOMS INFANCY1 T IKE most Eastern ceremonies the rites that accompany a Malay birth are very elaborate and very incongruous. The newly-born child is first spat upon by the midwife in order that he may be protected against the old Indonesian spirits of disease. After this he hears from the lips of his father (or from some learned man if the father be illiterate) the Moslem tenets, the adzan or "call to devotion," and the kamat or "final exhorta- tion to prayer." He is then handed back to the midwife in order that she may imprint on his forehead the caste-mark of the Hindu. Having been thus received into three religions at once, the child is put to rest by his mother's side - along with a piece of iron, a quantity of rice and a number of other articles that the Malay considers necessary for the defence of infancy against its natural and spiritual foes. The presiding authority on these occasions is a woman, the bidan, or midwife. The mighty pawang , or wizard, is also there, but he plays a humble part. He chooses an auspicious place for the birth and he surrounds it with thorns,2 nets, dolls and bitter herbs, in order to keep the spirits of evil from getting at the mother and child in the perilous hour of their weakness. He selects the exact spot by dropping some sharp-pointed chopper or axe-head and marking the first place where it sticks into the ground. Thorns are thought to be dangerous to the trailing entrails of the vampire;3 bitter herbs are unpalatable to everyone; dolls may be mistaken for the baby; nets are puzzling to spirits because of their complexity, and even a much-perforated coconut is sometimes hung up over a Malay door in order to bewilder a ghost by the multiplicity of its entrances and exits. The pawang' s duty begins and ends with these primitive precautions. The elders of the mosque, great though they are on other days, are even less important than the pawang on the occasion of a birth; the bidan , is supreme. She has charge of mother and child; she takes the infant from the moment of his birth, washes him with the proper water, rubs him with the prescribed black cloth, and finally brings him to a proper sense of his position by banging a brass tray near his ear or (in extreme cases) by lighting Chinese cracker^ in his immediate neighbourhood. The midwife's word is law: "obey the! bidan" is a Malay proverb that is quoted to silence any fool who dares to dispute the word of an expert. The bidan gets ready the child's first' resting-place, the platter of rice on which he is laid and the iron nail that usually keeps him company. The honour of the first introduction she gives to the child's grandmothers, for there is a local saying that "an old woman takes to a baby like an epicure to a sardine." Next in order of presentation after the grandmothers come the religious dignitaries of the mosque. They are not credited with any special 1 Ante-natal ceremonies are dealt with in Appendix A. 2 Duri mengkuang and duri bulang. 3 Penanggalan: it has long pendent bowels. 41</page><page sequence="43">love for babies, but it is the duty of these pious people to "open the child's mouth;" and it is considered good form on the infant's part if he anticipates the ceremony by indulging in a good "mouth-opening" scream as soon as he looks on the faces of his benefactors. A cry of this sort, though it is welcomed as a sign of intelligent anticipation, does not release the baby from the prescribed formalities. The imam ceremonially opens the child's mouth with a golden ring that has been dipped in a compound of sireh- juice and sugared and salted water: "In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate - may He lengthen your life; may He teach you to speak fittingly in the courts of kings; may He give to your words the attractiveness of sireh, the sweetness of sugar and the spiciness of salt." When this little function is over and the ring has been tied to the child's wrist, another function begins. The baby has to be solemnly presented to the foster-mother or wet-nurse - a serious forma- lity in a place where relationship by fosterage may some day be a legal barrier to marriage. Sooner or later this function also comes to an end; the guests go away; the child is put to sleep, and the bidan can devote all her attention to the mother.1 During the first few days and weeks of his existence the Malay child is the subject of innumerable precautions against evil spirits. He is spat upon, morning and evening; his resting-places are smeared with sacrificial rice and with cosmetics that no ghost can approach; his cot is fumigated with the incense that the evil is known to abhor; his bath contains potent ingredients (such as manganese-dust and talismans of all sorts) that make the water purifying both to soul and body. On the seventh day the child begins to be taught the ways of the world. He is made to eat fruit - banana beaten into pulp and flavoured with salt. He is given a name, experimentally; but the name may be changed afterwards if it seems to bring ill luck. He is shown to the neighbours and receives his necessary quantum of feminine adulation. He has his head shaved. A sacrifice may be offered up on his behalf; feasts may be given in his honour. If his parents are unusually proud of him they offer up vows at some shrine, to be fulfilled in later years when the child has survived the perils of infancy. In short, the seventh day is the celebration-day of a baby's birth and everything possible is done to honour the child on that occasion. From an orthodox standpoint the great event on this occasion is the religious sacrifice2 that accompanies the ritual shaving of the head. The sacrifice should consist of two goats for a boy and one goat for a girl, and it may be offered up at Mecca on the child's behalf. But orthodox rites of this sort are not always the most important in the eyes of the Malays. It is about the fortieth day after his birth that the child is first presented to the Spirits of the River. As soon as the sun is high in the heavens the infant is carried down to the river bank by a merry crowd of men, women and children, who take with them a quantity of parched rice,3 yellow rice, purifying rice-dust,4 two coconuts, a fowl, an egg (of a black hen), a quid of betel, seven long packets of cooked rice,5 seven square packets of cooked rice,6 a light bucket of palm leaf, and a banana-flower. As the procession approaches the stream the bidan or bomor in charge of the child stops for a moment, sets fire to a bundle 1 The treatment is the very severe one of "roasting" (&lt; diang ). 2 Akikah. 3 Beras berteh. 4 Tepong tawar. 5 Lepat. 6 Ketupat. 42</page><page sequence="44">of herbs and raises it aloft till all can see a column of dense smoke ascending into the air. Then, advancing to the edge of the stream, the bearer of the child makes an offering to the Spirit of the Waters - the egg, the quid of betel, the seven long rice-packets and the seven square rice-packets. The purifying rice-dust is sprinkled about like holy water to avert all evil influences; the grains of parched rice and yellow rice are scattered over the face of the stream, and the fowl and the two coconuts are put down into the water itself. The older members of the crowd now raise their voices in a loud song to drown any crying on the infant's part as the bomor or bidan places one of the child's feet on the two coconuts and the other on the fowl. The bucket and the banana- flower are next set adrift and float down stream bearing away any possibilities of evil that may still lurk about the spot. If the baby is a boy, a boy fishing further upstream should now catch a fish with his casting net; if the baby is a girl, the fisher should also be a girl. But in Upper Perak, at any rate, the baby himself should be caught under the net, along with a number of other young children who receive five cents each for being members of the finny tribe for this occasion only. After such an auspicious beginning it is considered unlikely that the infant will ever lack fish for his dinner. When these river-rites have been concluded the crowd goes back to the house to witness the first cradling of the infant. The ceremony begins by the baby being allowed to loll in the lap of luxury, with cakes on all sides of him and fifty-cent pieces for him to spurn beneath his restless feet. Meanwhile his swinging-cot is being got ready. It is draped or made by means of one or more (usually seven) long rolls of black cloth, the ends of which are festooned with cakes and hard-boiled eggs. As it is always possible that some unlucky influence may be lurking in the cosy folds of the newly-made cradle, a cat is put in to absorb or drive out the evil spirits of the locality. By way of making assurance doubly sure the cat is succeeded first by a curry-stone and secondly by a coconut-grater smeared with chalk or lime. When all these prior occupants have been given time to purify the place the cot is considered fit for infantile habitation. The inevitable midwife comes forward, lifts up the baby and sets him down in his new home. The old people start rocking the cradle, and the wife of the imam , or some other pious old lady, begins to chant the "Lullaby of Our Lady Fatimah": Barang-siapa berpadi emping Padi emping huma di-tengah; Barang-siapa berhati mumin Hati yang mumin istana Allah. And so on.1 The peculiar drowsiness induced by this poetic outburst enables the child to sleep through the next item in this set of ceremonies - the handing round of curry and rice to enable the elders of the party to get some share of the good things of this world that have been hitherto monopolised by the baby. The imam recites prayers, the visitors disperse, and the parents bless the midwife and reward her with yellow rice, roast fowl, and a piece of white cloth that serves as an emblem of the stainlessness of their affection for her. These things are not her real fee. She receives her fee - in hard cash - at the lustration that marks 1 See Appendix B, where the full text is given. 43</page><page sequence="45">the mother's complete recovery. On this occasion the mother is led by the midwife to the well and is made to hold a pair of betel-nut scissors in one hand and a foul-smelling cloth in the other. The scissors and the smell keep the spirits at a distance while the bidan carries out the puri- fication. On the return to the house the bidan is paid off and her duties are at an end. If a child is born to a Sultan of Perak after his accession to the throne the child cannot be brought up in the palace by his mother. He is called an anak banta and must be given over to adoptive parents. He is believed to bring great ill-luck to his adoptive father and mother until he comes of age, and great good fortune to them afterwards if they survive the perils that dog them during his minority. This rule applies to children of both sexes and has been illustrated in the case of two sons and several daughters of H.H. the present Sultan. By a curious set of coincidences misfortune has steadily pursued the families into which these princes and princesses have been received, and it still remains to be seen whether the blessings of the future will make up for the evils of the past. The theory itself is not hard to understand; in the days of Malay rule the intrigues of a palace could not have been healthy for the children of rival queens. The ceremonial treatment accorded by Malays to a girl-baby does not greatly differ from that which they give to a boy. The girl has the "exhortation to prayer" repeated in her ear, while the boy hears the "call to devotion." The boy's "caste-mark" is said to differ sometimes from that of a girl; the former has a broad-arrow, the latter a cross.1 The votive sacrifice for a boy is two goats while that for a girl is only one. These differences are in favour of the boy and suggest a certain religious or ritual preference for male children; but they do not imply that the Malays as a race are indisposed to welcome the birth of daughters. "While the elder sister is still only able to lie on her back may the younger be born," is a proverbial Achehnese good wish that expresses a welcome to girl-children and a desire for many more. As we might expect from their old matriarchal customs, the Malays are as ready to offer up vows on behalf of a daughter as they are on behalf of a son. Of course there is not the slightest trace of anything like female infanticide having been prevalent among them. At first the baby is wrapped up in some simple swaddling clothes - the lampin and the bedong - to keep him from injuring his limbs by over-indulgence in aimless kicks. After some months the child is pro- moted to wearing a barut , a sort of broad wrapper of the cholera-belt type, designed so as to leave him free to exert himself and learn the arts of crawling and walking. Later still, he is promoted to the very superior class of Malay children who wear no clothes at all. But such a promotion is only attained after many preliminary stages of culture. The development of a child is measured by his prowess in infantile arts. A crawler is regarded as superior to a child that can only lie on his back, and as the peer of all other crawlers; but when compared with a toddler he is a very inferior being indeed. The grades of infantile aristocracy are as follows: first comes the stage at which infants can only lie on their backs; then comes the ability to turn over, to crawl, 1 Skeat, "Malay Magic," p. 336; but in most places it is a cross for both girls and boys. 44</page><page sequence="46">to toddle, to walk, to run - and so on. The proud mother does what she can to expedite her child's education and to make rival mothers jealous. She teaches him to eat banana, fruit-mash and rice-pulp long before such a diet is good for him. She introduces him to the great world by taking him outside the house with very little thought of the temper- ature and innumerable precautions against the malignant spirits of envy.1 She encourages him to crawl, and teaches him to walk by fastening him to a sort of windlass that revolves on a pivot at a convenient height above the ground. She weans him as soon as possible by the simple process of rubbing bitter herbs upon her breast. These attempts to accustom a child to the life (and particularly to the food) of later years are probably responsible for the heavy mortality among native children. Malays notice this death-rate. They see that certain mothers seem incapable of bringing up children - "like the tuman fish that eats its own young" - and they attribute such an incapacity to a horoscopic incompatibility between mother and child. In cases of this sort they hand over the custody of later children to a more successful matron (Abdullah himself was so treated), or they give the infant an unattractive name like Hudoh (ugly) in the hope that Death will not think the child worth snapping up. In no case are Malays fond of high-sounding names for children; they prefer nicknames as more usefully descriptive. A West Indian negro may call his son "George Washington" and a Tamil Moslem may name his boy "Sultan Muhammad," but the Malay policeman is content to fire his son's ambition with some modest and practical appellation such as Peral or "Corporal." Although every child must be given an Arabic name, that name is usually abridged to an easy mouthful - Mat for Muhammad , Pin for Arifin , Pi hi for Shafei , Din for Jamaludin, Lah for Abdullah , and so on. Moreover, the Malays have a whole series of conventional or descriptive names that they give to their children in order of seniority: Long or Awang to the eldest child, Along to the second, Ngah to the third, Anjang or Panjang to the fourth, Andak or Pandak to the fifth, Teh or Put eh to the sixth, etc., all in succession according to age. These conventional names2 though they bewilder the beginner, are often a guide to the advanced student when he wishes to find out the relative seniority of the members of a Malay noble house. In a few cases the names given to the children of a family give some indications of their parents' tastes or ideas. A succession of names ending in ar-rashid (the Orthodox) always suggests that the father is a strict follower of the Muhammadan faith. A name taken from old Javanese legend implies that the giver has a pretty taste in romance. But fanciful naming is rare. The average Malay is content with stock names, such as Long Mat and Anjang Abdullah ; indeed, he will often elect to drop his own appellation and be called after his child - Pa' Long or Pd Awang , the father of his firstborn. 1 This ceremony, turun ka-tanah, coincides and corresponds in details with the presentation to the Spirits of the River ( turun ka-ayer). 2 Timang-timangan. 45</page><page sequence="47">CHILDHOOD Between the ages of two and six a Malay child is allowed to amuse himself by playing games in the immediate vicinity of his home while making himself useful by running small errands for his parents. He wears nothing, eats very simple food, and puts his relatives to so little expense that the possession of a large family is never regarded as an economic difficulty. At the age of six he usually begins to receive some sort of education. At various periods between early childhood and adolescence every boy and girl has to submit to certain ceremonial operations, such as ear-boring (in the case of girls) and circumcision (in the case of boys.) By far the most important of these rites is circumcision. It takes place after a boy has passed an examination in the Koran and represents his formal admission to the communion of Islam. In certain portions of Malaya (especially in the Northern States) it is accompanied by such a wealth of irrelevant detail as to suggest that it has been grafted upon an ancient festival belonging to an older faith than that of Islam, but whatever may have been its origin the event is important enough from an orthodox Muhammadan standpoint to justify the sincere gratification of a Malay father at seeing the com- pletion of his son's training in the creed of his ancestors. The education of a Malay child is now conducted on European lines and bears no resemblance whatever to the system that prevailed in former times. Indeed, except for the existence of occasional Koran- classes, there used to be no schools - in our sense of the word - until the period of European ascendancy. Education was based upon a sort of apprenticeship. Most boys picked up a good deal of industrial knowledge by assisting their parents in the work of agriculture, fishing and trapping. They acquired manual dexterity by working in wood and rattan, and they gathered a large amount of miscellaneous information regarding crops, fruit-trees, irrigation, boats and the ways of fishes, animals and birds. They learnt also to be observant. A few youths of exceptional gifts would go further and learn something of art and metal-working by giving occasional help to a village craftsman; a few more would specialise in reading and writing, either for religious purposes or with a view to becoming doctors, diviners, sorcerers and letter-writers. The young bloods of a village, eager for distinction in war, might study fencing, talismans, the points of a keris , and the many ways of making oneself invulnerable. In the matter of proverbs, old saws, folk-lore, tradition, history and popular verse, the girls were generally better instructed than the boys. But it must always be remembered that "the trail of the amateur" was over all Malay education. A silversmith, for instance, could not live by his art; in a small Malay village there was not enough work to support him. He had to be a farmer like all his neighbours, and he only used his art to supplement his income. If his fame spread to other places he might be summoned to the Sultan's court and be made to work for the ruler; yet even there the rarity of silver prevented a silversmith being constantly employed. Apart from a certain amount of local renown there was no inducement whatever to lead a boy to become an artist or man of letters. Moreover, 46</page><page sequence="48">there was no real competition. A village could not support two smiths: the most skilful artificer soon drove out his rival and monopolised what work there was. And an artist who has it all his own way is rarely a great artist. As with all incidents of Malay life the sending of a boy to a Koran- class was accompanied by much elaborate ceremonial. A feast was given; the mosque-teacher was invited to it, and the proud father publicly handed over his son to the educational authorities with a deep obeisance and a little formal speech: "Imam, I have a favour to ask of your kindness. Here is my boy, Si-Alang. I desire to place him in your hands so that he may be taught to read the word of God. You will need a torch to lighten his path to knowledge, so please let me present you with this cane for use as a rod of correction in the event of his showing any indifference to the Divine Light. You should not poke out his eye or break his bones, but - short of such extreme measures - all things are permitted unto you." To which the Imam replied, "I accept this youth as my disciple; please God, he will learn in time the little that I know." All this ceremonial is becoming a thing of the past. The penghulu now visits parents, talks about "average attendances" at the village school, and finally threatens the father with the wrath of the Government if he allows his son to grow up in ignorance. Even this is sometimes ineffective. I have seen a Malay mother go down to a school, smash her son's slate, tear up his books, and defy the head master - and all because the boy's irregularity in attendance prevented his being presented at the annual examination of the class. On this occasion I ventured to suggest that the visiting-teacher might be sent round to bring her to a more reasonable frame of mind, but my proposal was met by the crushing rejoinder that the lady was the visiting-teacher's wife. The old Malay Koran-schools were often residential. Boys were sent to live in the house of some renowned teacher, the parents supplying each of their sons with a sleeping-mat and pillow, a cooking-pot and a sack of rice. Three lessons were given daily. They lasted for an hour at a time - one after the early morning prayer, the other after the midday devotions and the third after vespers. At other times the boys helped their master in his housework and in the care of his rice-fields and orchards. The instruction was of a most primitive character. A pupil began by learning to repeat correctly the Arabic formulae with which every lesson began and ended. When he had mastered these preliminaries he proceeded to study the alphabet, less for its own sake than as a sort of guide to reading Arabic prayers and texts. Through much memorising and through the assistance given him by his knowledge of the lettering he would in time succeed in being able to read the Koran and the principal prayers from end to end. There his education stopped. The general drift of the text was explained to him, but not the con- struction of the sentences nor the meaning of the Arabic words. A slight amount of dogma was also imparted. Religious doctrine can, of course, be made to vary greatly according to the needs of the locality. A Patani imam once gave a lecture on "infidels" in the presence of a Siamese Governor and of a European visitor. "Infidel," he explained, was the name given by Muhammad to the lusts of the heart.1 It did not necessarily refer to other faiths. Other religions had prophets of their own who were 1 Nafsu yang didalam diri kita. 47</page><page sequence="49">nevertheless true prophets like Nabi Isa , the prophet of the Christians, and Nabi Musa, the prophet of the Siamese. Here he bowed to his foreign audience. Doctrines of this sort are not mere diplomatic state- ments to meet the needs of the moment; they are sedulously preached by Moslem advocates of peace and conciliation in every part of the world. Of course they differ very greatly from the teachings of Acheen and of Arabia, and although they furnish matter for debate among the amateur theologians of the village they are looked upon as rather wasted when taught to children. In practice the Malay boy has to memorise his Koran and his prayers before he can be admitted by circumcision to the community of Islam, and he can afford to postpone his studies of doctrine to a later date. At first sight nothing could appear more futile than the Koran-class instruction given to boys all over the Moslem world. It is mere parrot- like repetition of certain texts in a language not understood by the pupils; and, even if it develops the memory, it would seem to be useless either as an intellectual training or as an education in morals. But it is never safe to condemn a system that has proved acceptable to a large section of humanity. In some schools the more logical process of teaching a boy Arabic before teaching him the Koran has been tried and found wanting. Arabic is a very difficult language; the teachers were unskilful, and the pupils became discouraged and gave up a task that seemed hopeless. Modern educationists are inclined to insist on the necessity of making study interesting to the student. They may be right; but few of us owe our knowledge of Latin grammar to the intrinsic interest of the subject. Encouragement, reward, the admiration of one's fellow schoolboys, and even the much-maligned "rod of correction" are brilliant torches along the path to knowledge. The Malay child who mastered an Arabic "broken plural" or some eccentricity in the ways of the Arabic verb would never receive as much praise and satisfaction as the boy who learnt a new prayer and was able to chant it correctly to the great joy and pride of his parents and the envy of the whole neighbour- hood. Incidentally and almost unconsciously the learning of successive prayers and texts led an intelligent Malay boy to pick up a good deal of knowledge about the meaning of Arabic words and the syntax of the language. The process was slower, but the steps were pleasanter and more encouraging. Every prayer represented one more step to the good; it was a milestone on the way to wisdom. The duller boys dropped out, and were content with what they knew; the cleverer boys went on and studied more. Learning took a strong religious tinge and became rather fanatical, but it was never stifled by the form in which instruction was given. Meanwhile a boy learnt his Arabic alphabet and with a little coaching could apply it to the reading and writing of Malay. Manners were recognised as a very important item in the education given at these old Malay Koran-classes; and nothing is more deplored by natives of the old school than the alleged inferiority of the present generation in this branch of instruction. A boy was taught to be silent until he was addressed, to keep his eyes cast down in the presence of his superiors, to behave unobtrusively at a public meeting, and to adapt his language to the occasion on which it was used. He generally learnt these lessons well; Malay courtesy is admired by all. It is only right to add that some few religious leaders, in their anxiety to teach humility, 48</page><page sequence="50">have taught their followers to cringe in a manner that is as objectionable as the truculent self-assertion which every good Malay considers the acme of bad taste. But such cases are rare. The well-educated Malay of the older generation is a master of courteous manners and quiet dignified language; he creates difficulties by his very anxiety to avoid any expression of opinion that may seem to disagree with a view of the person addressed. A well-known Malay member of a State Council was once asked point-blank for his views on an issue regarding which his sovereign had not yet expressed an opinion. With great reluctance the chief rose and spoke at considerable length in a manner that roused the keen aesthetic appreciation of his critical fellow-countrymen. "An excellent speech," said the Sultan, when the applause had subsided. "But what did he say?" enquired the bewildered Resident. "Oh, he did not say anything at all, but the way in which he said it was magnificent!" At the conclusion of a boy's education his parents give an enter- tainment at which he is enabled to display his best manners and his knowledge of Arabic ritual. This feast is part of the circumcision ceremony. The formalities begin when the boy is clad in royal garments and is set upon a royal throne for all and sundry to see. Then on the following day he is stripped, bathed and purified; he is stained with henna like a bridegroom and is dressed in the garb of a pilgrim to Mecca. In this guise he recites prayers to the assembled guests in order to prove the sufficiency of his learning. When the prayers are over he rises and prostrates himself before his teacher in gratitude for past kindnesses. The parents now come forward with the customary gifts: a suit of clothes, a sum of money and certain articles of food. Then there follows (in some parts of Perak) a very curious ceremony. The boy is taken to an inner room, where he is stripped and covered with a rich cloth, while his mouth is filled with yellow glutinous rice and his body is sprinkled with the purifying rice-dust. After this, two coconuts and two small packets of rice are slowly rolled over him from head to foot. A hen is placed on the boy's chest and is encouraged to peck up any grains of yellow rice that may still be adhering to the boy's mouth. This is done to drive away ill-luck. The circumciser (or mudin ) then comes forward and gently taps the boy's teeth with a stone. This is also done to avert misfortune. Feasting follows. The boy is dressed again and is carried in procession round the village and down to the river for another ceremonial purification. There the circumciser makes an appeal to the Spirit of the Waters, deprecating his wrath. The usual purifying rice powder is scattered on the stream and the usual offerings are made - yellow rice, a quid of betel, an egg, seven long packets of cooked rice. When the Water Spirit has been propitiated the boy is washed by his mother and has his long lock of hair solemnly shorn off by the mudin. The people then return to the house to witness the actual circumcision itself. While this is taking place the boy is made to sit either on a banana trunk or on a sack of rice.1 The ceremonies vary greatly in different States. It is usual to circumcise a number of boys at one time so as to minimise the cost of the celebrations. In such cases the son of the giver of the feasts is treated as the king for the occasion, while the other boys (whose parents contribute nothing) play the part of mere attendants upon the central 1 See Appendix C. 49</page><page sequence="51">figure. At the Perak Court the muditi is a regular officer of State with a recognised title;1 but he carries out his work under rather disturbing conditions, for the great chiefs stand round him with drawn swords ready to slay him if he mismanages the operation. In Patani the boys are carried about on a dais in the shape of a bird or animal; in Perak they are borne on men's shoulders. In the towns of the Straits Settlements the royal ceremonies are less conspicuous. More attention is paid there to the religious details, while motor cars, jewellery and brass bands make up for the absence of the regalia and symbolism of the Native States. A Malay girl is taught something of the Koran, though she is not expected to attain to the same standard of proficiency as her brothers. When her religious education is complete she is dressed like a pilgrim to Mecca and is admitted to the community of Islam by a ceremony much simpler and less public than the circumcision-rites of boys.2 On this occasion her ears are bored and her teeth used to be filed down and stained "black as a humble-bee's wing." Tooth-filing and tooth-staining are now obsolete; the ceremonies attached to them seem to have been little more than precautionary rites against evil spirits. Ear-boring is still practised, but the huge, round ear-studs3 which were assumed after this ceremony and worn by girls as emblems of their maiden state, are now becoming ceremonial and are only put on for the wedding itself in order that they may be formally discarded a few days afterwards. 1 To ' Gembira. He appears in the Estimates. 2 In Patani this ceremony is performed in infancy. s Subang. 50</page><page sequence="52">BETROTHAL Malay girls are usually kept shut up in their own homes from the age of ten to the time of their marriage. This seclusion varies in rigour in different parts of Malaya, being strictest among the "Jawi pekan" population of the towns and least strict in the districts where the ancient customary law is observed. The confinement of girls to their houses served to guard them from the dangerous notice of the chiefs and also from the risk of their injuring their matrimonial prospects by any foolish compromising acts. In the law-abiding Menangkabau communities of Sumatra a good deal of freedom could be safely allowed, provided that the women kept in parties by themselves and did not indulge in tete-a- tete interviews with fascinating young men. Out of this degree of freedom there grew up a pretty custom that has greatly influenced Malay literature - the practice of holding rhyming contests between the rival parties of the men and the girls. A girl might be suddenly inspired to extemporise or quote some pantun or verse that was apposite to the character, history or appearance of some young man who happened to be present. The opportunity was not to be missed. The person chaffed (or one of his friends) would retort with a second pantun. The contest would then continue till one or other party was at a loss for a proper reply. The Malay quatrain is a very easy thing to extemporise, owing to the fact that its first two lines are mere jingles put in to rhyme with the last two, and also because every line is sung slowly and is followed by a chorus or refrain that gives time to the other party to think of an appropriate answer. At the same time there can be a vast difference in quality between one pantun and another, and there is every scope for skill and wit in these poetic contests, punctuated as they are by the applause or laughter of the audience. While, therefore, in everyday life the negotiations for a wedding are of a very commonplace order, it is quite otherwise in ceremonies and in literature. The heroine of a romance is always wooed in verse, and even the bearers of a formal proposal of marriage are expected to announce their errand and receive their answer in an appropriate succession of quatrains. The diplomacy of a marriage generally commences when the parents or friends of the prospective bridegroom make advances to the girl's family with a view to finding out (without exposing themselves to the humiliation of a public rebuff) whether a proposal of this sort would be likely to be well received. Enquiries such as these need a good deal of tact. The suitor's party do not wish to take any risks and the girl's parents do not like to show any suspicious eagerness to part with their daughter. Hints are sometimes used. What could be more innocent than the position of the little silver vase containing the sireh that is offered to a visitor? Yet if this vase is upset and left lying on its side, the quick-eyed enquirer knows that his quest is useless; the lady's people do not desire the marriage. If his hints become broader and the vase still remains upright he knows that he can proceed to more definite action. Professional marriage-brokers are often employed at this stage; their very presence suggests their errand to the girl's parents. When it seems likely that the proposal of marriage will be well received the ladies of the young man's family call upon the bride, make 51</page><page sequence="53">much of her and endeavour to appraise her character and charms. The meaning of such overtures can hardly be mistaken; but it is essential that a real understanding should be arrived at before the marriage can be openly discussed. A rebuff would be fatal to any friendly relations between the two families; it would indeed be an insult. "Do not start by speaking of 'agreements' and go on by calling them 'enquiries,' " says one proverb. "Let your word, once given, be held like a fort," says another proverb. Betrothal - because of the feuds that may spring out of a broken promise - is the one occasion in life when the Malay tolerates no indecision and no evasion. Let us therefore suppose that the proposal is welcome to both parties and that there are no real difficulties in the way. "One side has the curry, the other side has the spoon;" it only remains to bring the two together. The main details - the amount of the settlement to be made on the bride, the value of the wedding gifts, the probable duration of the engagement, and other questions of the same sort - are roughly settled by custom and are known to both parties. All that is left is to have them definitely laid down so that no misunderstandings may arise afterwards. As these matters are too delicate for direct negotiation between the parties, they are usually referred to the penghulu and elders of the village. At this point secrecy ceases to be possible, even if every one is pledged to it. Both parties submit their case to arbitration, knowing in outline what they have to expect and ready to abide by the decision of their elders if it is unfavourable to them on the minor issues that have to be decided. By a recent discussion of the Perak State Council the following scale of "dowry" (or settlement by the bridegroom on the bride) was laid down for observance in ordinary cases: For a Sultan's daughter $1,000 For the daughter of a Raja Muda or Bendahara ... 500 For the daughter of a major Chief 250 For the daughter of a minor Chief 125 For the daughter of a man of some position ... 62.50 For the daughter of a peasant 31.25 This scale is not universal or compulsory even in Perak. It was only drawn up for the guidance' of Kathis who have to appraise the mas kahwin for purposes of divorce in cases where no definite sum was actually agreed upon at the time of the wedding itself. But this scale of settlements shows approximately what the bridegroom expects to have to pay and what the penghulu and his elders are likely to fix. Other matters have also to be arranged. The cost of the wedding festivities has to be paid by the bride's family, but the bridegroom has to contribute to it. The penghulu has to fix the amount of this contri- bution of "money to go in smoke."1 In former times in Perak it used to be $6£, but the exact sum can be modified by agreement. The penghulu has also to fix the approximate date of the marriage, so that neither side may evade its obligations by prolonging the engagement indefinitely. When everything has been arranged in such a manner as to leave no loophole for future disputes the agreement has still to be confirmed by a formal proposal and by its formal acceptance. Malay etiquette expects the suitor's parents or guardians to proceed on his behalf to the lady's house and, after many apologies and much 1 Belanja hangus. 52</page><page sequence="54">circumlocution, to enquire (usually in verse) whether the young man may be permitted to offer himself for acceptance as the lady's slave. It also insists that the girl's relatives shall declare themselves quite unworthy of the proposed honour. The most that they will admit is that they are like the proverbial expression, "nearly up to but not attaining." As for the girl herself, "she cannot cook, she cannot sew, look to it that ye be not deceived in her; she is a buffalo that has been allowed to run wild; she may have some defect that has escaped our observation." The suitor's family reply politely that they have long been seeking a buffalo of that description and that she exactly meets their wishes. Ceremonial gifts of betel-nut are then brought forward in two boxes adorned with palm blossoms and decorations of gilt or coloured paper. Slipped over the sireh-leal in one of these boxes are two rings of the pattern known as bunga nyior: ; one of these rings is a pledge of good faith to be given to the girl's parents, and the other is a betrothal- ring to be given to the girl herself. After these rings have been passed round from hand to hand so that everyone may be able afterwards to testify to the occurrence the suitor's mother is invited indoors to see the girl. Of course such a visit is never unexpected. The girl is there, dressed in her best and overcome by self-consciousness as her future mother-in- law comes in, addresses her as "my child," kisses her and gives her the engagement-ring as evidence of her betrothal. The girl answers by doing obeisance. The ladies of the suitor's party then strike up a verse declaring that they have been attracted from afar by the lodestone of the damsel's beauty.1 The girl's relatives sing in reply that the strangers from a distance are welcomed as friends. After a few more quatrains of this sort refreshments are handed round and the suitor's relatives go home. The public proposal of marriage and its public acceptance give finality to the contract. Its nature can no longer be questioned, and it has to be carried out unless one or other contracting party elects to pay damages for its violation. Even the discussion of details cannot be reopened. The appropriate Malay proverb on this occasion is Putus benang boleh di-hubong ; patah arang sudah sakali : "broken thread may be tied together; broken charcoal is broken for ever." Broken charcoal is the symbol of finality. The contract is final: the bystanders have witnessed it, the whole village is invited to testify to it. The rule as to its breach is tanda empat pulang delapan : "if the engagement rings are worth four dollars, the girl's relatives must return eight." If the man does not carry out his promise, he forfeits the betrothal gifts; if the lady is false, she returns the gifts doubled in value. Nowadays the presents may be worth much more than four dollars, but that sum meant a great deal to the poverty-stricken ryots in the days before British ascendancy. After this settlement the suitor and the girl are looked upon as definitely engaged and are allowed to interchange small complimentary gifts. They are not, however, supposed to see anything of each other, as any conduct suggesting forwardness on the lady's part would be an offence against the Indonesian rule that forbids "the well to seek the bucket" or "the pestle to seek the mortar." Of course they do see each other; curiosity is strong, even if affection is not. "On some one evening," as a Malay puts it, "after prayer- time the suitor may slip round with his relatives and peep through the chinks in the wall of the lady's house 1 See Appendix D. 53</page><page sequence="55">at a time when his future mother-in-law will have induced her daughter to sew or play chess as she sits in the full glare of the lamp-light. Some men, intoxicated with love, cannot sleep after this vision; others can." The latter must be very phlegmatic persons; disappointment might well be expected to increase the tendency to insomnia. About a week after the public proposal of marriage the prospective bridegroom pays a ceremonious visit to the family of his betrothed. He is entertained to dinner on the verandah, brings gifts of money, is very obsequious to his future mother-in-law, and finally goes home about midnight after receiving a present of a complete suit of new clothing, with the explanation that they are "a miserable set of rags that may be of use to you to wear when bathing, but, alas! we are poor people and can give you nothing better." He is not allowed to see his betrothed; it is now her turn to look through the chinks in the wall. When the month of Shaaban comes round and the annual fast is imminent, the girl's parents send over to the house of her betrothed a gift of rice-powder, limes, loofah-fibre, perfumes and other cosmetics used in the ceremonial ablutions that precede the Malay Lent. This delicate attention is acknowledged by return-gifts of cakes and small sums of money for spending at the minor feast days that occur about this time. Similar courtesies are shown once or twice during the Fast itself, but the great festival of the hari raya is not used for any exchange of civilities between the betrothed. In every country it sometimes happens that a man falls desperately in love with a girl already engaged to someone else. In such cases every possible opposition must be made to the new suitor if a feud with the first suitor is to be avoided. On this point all Malay law was explicit. Still, if the new candidate for the girl's hand had "a strong party to back him, plenty of money and no lack of personal courage," he was not likely to find that her relatives were really unwilling to accept him as her husband, provided, of course, that he made such a show of force as would acquit them of the charge of connivance. Even with the com- plicity of the girl's relatives the abductor's task was a hard one. He had to defend himself against the murderous enmity of his injured rival until such time as the authorities could step in and put an end to the quarrel. Indonesian custom knew by experience that it had to concern itself more with pacifying feuds than with preventing them; it never hesitated about compounding an offence. If a man's betrothed was seduced or abducted, the law stepped in and made the wrong-doer pay compensation all round and a fine to the Bendahara as well. If he failed to pay, he was sold into slavery for the debt. If he paid, the matter blew over. Marriage by abduction became a recognised institution,1 with a special scale of enhanced payments associated with it. In the old wild days of Malay rule these abductions often led to most tragic results. If a girl was famous for her beauty the report of her engagement was enough to bring about a crisis. Any disappointed suitor - or perhaps some gay Lothario tempted by the spice of danger that attends the plucking of forbidden fruit - might have recourse to the simple expedient of seizing the girl and threatening to drive his keris through her heart if any attempt was made at a rescue. An outrage of this sort was known as panjat angkara and was hazardous in the 1 Panjat adat. 54</page><page sequence="56">extreme. Even if the abductor escaped instant death he dared not sleep, lest he should be murdered in his sleep; he dared not eat, lest his food should be drugged; he had to be constantly on his guard, lest he should be suddenly speared by a treacherous thrust through the thin flooring of a Malay house. His one chance of life lay in the fact that his desperation made his enemies chary about approaching him, while it made his friends eager to purchase his safety by promises of compensation. The "Malay Annals" record the case of a Javanese chief who succeeded in winning a Malacca wife by a desperate pan jot angkara, Many abductors were less fortunate. In one case, mentioned by Sir William Maxwell, a certain Mat Taib, a poor retainer of the Sultan, asked for Wan Dena, the daughter of the Bendahara of Kedah, in marriage. The relatives refused. He then forced his way into her house, seized her by the hair, drew his kris and defied everybody. Eventually he was drugged - probably with his friends' connivance, for he was not slain - and the girl was released and married to one Mat Arshad. A year later Mat Taib ran amok , killing Mat Arshad and wounding Wan Dena. But it must not be supposed that this panjat angkara was a recognised and regular form of marriage like panjat adat . It was far too violent for that; it was a savage variant of the crime passionnel , and had much in common with the amok , which is only the Malay form of suicide. How else can one explain the action of Hang Kasturi, who, when his intrigue was dis- covered, slew the girl in the most cruel manner, stripped and exposed her mutilated body, and then fought all comers till he was slain?1 Incidents of this sort were the exception, not the rule; the seclusion of Malay girls did not lend itself readily to broken vows and breach-of- promise cases. The average Malay engagement pursued its tranquil uneventful course until the prosaic incident of a rice harvest placed the families of the prospective bride and bridegroom in a position to entertain their friends. In the old days of native rule a bad harvest meant a general curtailment of the wedding-festivities. In the present age of security and peace the beneficent alien money-lender is always ready to make up for the deficiencies of the crops. The marriage-ceremonial has become more elaborate than ever, while the people are sinking more and more into debt. 1 The story is given in the "Malay Annals" and is very famous. 55</page><page sequence="57">MARRIAGE The formalities attending a Malay wedding are so elaborate that a European is apt to lose sight of their essential features in his bewilder- ment at the quantity of incidental detail. Indeed, the actual marriage service is a very simple rite that lies outside the customary celebrations. These celebrations should go on for at least seven days. The first three days are given up to the "henna-staining" festivities; the fourth day is devoted to the adornment of the happy pair, to their meeting and to their sitting in state; the fifth and sixth days are days of little importance; the seventh day witnesses the ceremonial lustrations of the married couple. The fourth day is the most notable. Its afternoon and evening ceremonies - the procession of the bridegroom to the house of his bride, his entry and the "sitting in state"1 - are the events that the European guest is usually invited to witness. During the first three "henna-staining" days the bride is at home to those of her lady-friends who express a wish to assist in painting her fingers with henna. She receives such guests and accepts whatever gifts they bring, while the male friends of her family are being entertained by her relatives on the verandah. The actual henna-staining is done by a professional expert and the assistance given by the visitors is purely nominal. The first "henna" night is known as the hinai churi , because the staining is done in private and in a very small way; the second night is the hinai besar , when the fingers, the toes and even the sides of the feet of both bride and groom are painted with henna. Both nights are marked by feasts and dancing. On one of the two nights a special "henna-dance" is performed; the other dances and amusements are of the regular Malay type and are only given for the amusement of the guests. On one of these two nights also a special wedding-dish of rice2 is served. The third night is marked by more feasting, by the chanting of Arabic hymns3 and by the ceremonial presentation4 of certain gifts of food from the relatives of the bridegroom to those of the bride - a huge dish of rice adorned with red eggs stuck on a tree-branch, and a certain quantity of raw material (such as coconut and firewood) for the preparation of the coming feast. These gifts are presented to the sound of much music and gun or cracker firing. The morning of the fourth day is taken up with the ceremonial shaving5 of the bride's fringe and with her adornment for the festivities of the evening. Her hair to the width of a finger's breadth all round the forehead is drawn forward and shaved off, while the band plays special tunes in honour of the event. After this shaving is over, the bride puts on her bridal dress and jewellery. She wears a gold- embroidered jacket with tight sleeves, a pair of loose silk trousers and a silk sarong. In her hair she fixes a number of artificial flowers of tinsel- work, kept in position with wires; to her ears she attaches the heavy, round ear-studs6 that are the emblems of virginity. On her arms, over her tight sleeves, she puts on an assortment of bracelets and anklets, notably the dragon-shaped pontoh . She is also adorned with golden 1 Ber sanding. 4 Serah. 2 The nasi hadap-hadapan yang berastakona. 5 Andam. 3 Dzikir maulud. « Subang. 56</page><page sequence="58">nail-protectors, with hollow anklets, with necklaces, with three heavy crescent-shaped breast ornaments known as dokoh , and, in many cases, with as much additional jewellery as her mother can borrow for the occasion.1 While these andam- ceremonies are taking place at the bride's house, the bridegroom is also being decked out for the evening procession. He is dressed as a warrior king. He wears the soldier's short coat,2 made of rich silk with a gold edging. He also puts on loose trousers of silk and gold, a rich waist-cloth, a stiff head-dress or turban, with artificial flowers and pendent ornaments, a keris mounted in gold, royal bracelets,3 a royal necklace of gold and three or more of the crescent- shaped orna- ments known as dokoh. When the procession is ready it starts off with the bridegroom (and sometimes with many symbolic gifts) to make its way slowly and circuitously to the house of the bride. It cheers itself upon the way with the sound of much cracker-firing, with shouts, with shots, with the banging of drums, with the clanging of gongs and with as many other noises as the village is capable of producing. The bridegroom himself is borne in state by the best means of conveyance obtainable, be that conveyance a motor-car, a carriage and pair, a dog-cart, a horse, an elephant, a jinrikisha, or even the humble shoulders of a coolie. As he approaches his destination the noise becomes more and more deafening, and when he stops it is impossible to hear anyone speak. This is the signal for the bride's people to suddenly become awake to the fact that something is happening. "Who is this visitor? Whence comes he? Does he come in peace or in war?" A colloquy ensues. Sometimes the bride- groom's party apologize for his coming: "He comes by no wish of his own; he is drawn by some magnet of irresistible attraction, by the breath of the breeze, by the swirl of the tides." A duenna from inside the house shouts, "Let him be welcome then; but he must doff his weapons and pay tribute in the land where a queen holds sway." To which his supporters reply, "His wallet is torn, his money is lost, he can only give an earnest of the gifts that are to come." In this way he may be admitted on payment of "tribute" or little gifts to all and sundry of the old ladies of the house. Or, again, the bride's friends may affect complete ignorance of the bridegroom's personality; they may want him described so as to assure themselves that, there is no mistake. All this, of course, gives unlimited opportunities for friendly chaff. Or again, they may pretend to resist him and hurl sweetmeats at the advancing host of the bridegroom's supporters. A mimic battle ensues and goes on until some well-meant act of treachery gives the bridegroom admission and prevents the jest from lasting too long. His followers crowd in after him. It is usual at this stage for the young man to display a timid modesty that accords very ill with his truculent soldier-dress. He is Mars overcome by Venus; he is a poor fainting creature whose eyes have to be guarded with a fan lest a sudden glimpse of his betrothed should overpower him; he has to be held up by his friends lest his limbs should give way. Everyone hastens to reassure him and to lead him to the bridal dais where his bride is waiting. There the pair have to be 1 Nowadays there is great variety in bridal costume, even in Perak, to which these rules apply. 2 Baju alang. 3 Pont oh. 57</page><page sequence="59">ceremonially seated together with their little fingers interlocked. The process is like an exercise in physical drill in which the performer is made to sink slowly down into a squatting posture and then to straighten his knees and stand erect. Bride and groom have to go on doing this together till they succeed in seating themselves slowly and exactly at the same moment - as custom requires. They also sometimes have to exchange vows that they will cherish each other and each other's good name. Once seated they are expected to remain motionless while the eyes of all the guests are fixed upon them. In Perak the guests are allowed to come up in strict order of precedence and lay offerings of silver on a platter before the newly-married pair. One by one they come up, doing obeisance, first to royalty (if present) and then to the bride and bridegroom, as king and queen of the evening. The married pair interchange mouthfuls of rice as evidence of their new relation to one another; the feast begins, and at last the guests are sent off in honour to their homes, the less distinguished being sometimes presented with packets of boiled rice and the more distinguished with the telur joran or coloured eggs stuck on branches. At the close of the "sitting in state" the bride is allowed to leave her husband and to return to her mother; and the hasty rush of the frightened girl, with the jingling and clanging of her ornaments, is a proverbial source of gratification to the bystanders, as a sign of her modesty after the uncomfortable splendour of her position. On or about the seventh day the ceremonial bathing takes place. A temporary bath-house is built on a dais above a flight of seven steps, and is prepared for the reception of the bridal pair. The two march up together into it, either holding a handkerchief or with their little fingers interlocked. They sit side by side on a bench or on a banana stem. The bride's hair is untied. In some cases the water is passed through a cloth filled with flowers and palm-shoots; in some cases coconut-milk, lime-juice and rice powder are used as cosmetics for these ablutions; in all cases everything possible is done to give a ceremonial character to the whole lustration. In the south the pipe carrying the water is carved into the shape of a dragon's mouth at its extremity. Both in the north and in the south of the Peninsula the lustration ceremony includes the passing of a curious bridal cord round the necks of the married pair, and it ends with the severance of this cord. But long before this cord is severed the excited matrons who wash the bridal couple have turned the water on each other and the ceremony turns into a general fight, in which syringes are the guns and the missiles are streams of water. The spectators are splashed and wetted until the signal for the cessation of the fun is given by the breaking of the cord that binds the bride and the bridegroom. At a Patani wedding, observed by Mr. Winstedt, this severance was effected by fire; the flame of the burning ends was blown out by the bridegroom and the soot of the charred extremities was rubbed on the foreheads of both him and his wife. Guests and hosts, bride and bridegroom, wet and dry, all now return home, put on their wedding garments and meet again for a further feast and for a further bersanding or "sitting in state." Throughout this period of the ceremony the married relation between the bride and bridegroom is only nominal. They see very little of each other and are not permitted to be alone. It is not till three days, or 58</page><page sequence="60">a week, or even a fortnight has elapsed after the "final" fourth day1 that the bridegroom is allowed to have the bride to himself. If he is not satisfied with her and has reason to question her virtue he is entitled to announce his dissatisfaction by appearing in public without his keris , or minus his headdress, or otherwise "incomplete." In that case he can claim a refund of half the dowry. But the marriage is not considered void2 and the passing of such a public affront on his wife's family is not likely to conduce to the success of his future life. It is considered bad taste as well as bad policy to create a quarrel at this stage. Any differences are enquired into and can be amicably settled without the cognizance of all the scandalmongers of the village. In all the ceremonies that have been described hitherto no account has been given of the true marriage service (if we may so call it) in which the blessing of the Almighty is invoked upon the union of his servants. This detail is generally overlooked by spectators as it is very simple and very private. What happens is this. The imam or other officiating elder opens the proceedings with a religious appeal, such as, "I exhort you to the fear of Allah." To this his hearers reply, "Amen." Then the bride's guardian3 is expected to repeat a formula offering the bride in marriage to the bridegroom and mentioning the amount of the marriage-settlement. But as the formula is long, and as it is in Arabic, and as the guardian is usually too illiterate and too flustered to be intelligible in a language that he does not know, he appoints some more learned man to be his attorney4 and to make the offer in his name. The offer is then made by the attorney. As soon as it has been made the presiding elder gives a warning tug to the bridegroom's arm by way of telling him that he must now express his acceptance of the offer. He does so - in Arabic. This formula is short enough to present little difficulty even to an illiterate man, but the nervousness of a bridegroom occasionally makes him use some expression that is not to be found in any Arabic dictionary. Everything has then to be repeated all over again - the offer, the warning tug, and the reply. At last the bridegroom gets his words right and the marriage is nearly valid. It is made quite valid by the two necessary witnesses being appealed to, and by their replying that they have heard everything that has taken place. The presiding elder then repeats a prayer5 more or less to this effect: "O God, make union between these two as Thou didst make union between the water and the earth." The ceremony ends. The bride need not be present at all, and if she is a maiden and under age her consent need not be asked. What is fairly evident from the elaborate wedding ceremonies of the Malays is the fact that the actual religious rite is looked upon as a legalising form like the signing of the register in an English church or the attendance at the Mairie in France. The major incidents - the henna- staining, the shaving of the forehead, the procession, the sitting in state, and the lustrations on the seventh day - all lie outside the scope of Moslem law: they represent survivals of older customs and religions. Henna-staining is a custom that prevails in most Muhammadan countries and was probably imported with Islam. The procession of the armed and mounted bridegroom, the mimic resistance offered to him and the 1 Hari langsong. 2 A divorce, however, follows. 3 Wali. 4 Wakil. 5 The khutbah nikah. 59</page><page sequence="61">efforts to overcome it either by bribery or battle may be far-away echoes of a time when marriage by capture or marriage by purchase was the recognised rule of the day. Many of the other incidents have no special reference to marriage. The sitting in state and the ceremonial lustrations, for instance, are not confined to weddings. The shaving of the forehead is hard to explain: certain superstitions are connected with it; inferences regarding the bride's virtue are drawn from the way the hair behaves. In one old romance, the "Hikayat Koris," a distinction is drawn between wives for whom a bridegroom thought it worth his while to shave his own forehead and those to whom he did not pay that compliment. We can see traces of marriage by purchase in the advances paid at betrothal and in the other customary gifts. We find signs of the matriarchate in the rule that the bridegroom must reside in his wife's house for some considerable time after his wedding. Upon the simple Moslem marriage-rite there is superimposed a whole mass of ancient custom that the Malay refuses to discard. He considers the religious ceremony to be legal but inadequate; he wants the other things as well. He does not change old customs for new: he adds the new to the old. In old days high officers of state used to come on painted elephants to their installation. In 1907 the Raja Bendahara arrived in a carriage and pair, but the painted elephants followed behind. In 1908 the Raja Muda came in a motor-car with carriages and elephants in his train. "What will be used at the next installation of a Malay Chief?" asked a critical spectator. "An aeroplane," said the Dato' Sri Adika Raja. But it is also safe to predict that the aeroplane will be followed by a motor-car, the motor-car by a carriage and pair, and the carriage and pair by a painted elephant. Last of all will come a faithful retainer, prepared to carry the Chief on his shoulders should our modern con- trivances end by leaving his old master in the lurch. 60</page><page sequence="62">ADULT LIFE Immediately after his marriage a Malay husband settles down to live in his father-in-law's house. He gives his services to his wife's relatives, helps in their rice-fields, looks after their fruit-trees and repairs the family dwelling. This idyllic state Of things may go on for some time, but sooner or later it is apt to be ended by the growth of the new family. When the old home ceases to be big enough, the young couple desire to set up an establishment of their own. This is not a difficult matter. During some idle month, when rice is not being planted, the husband and his friends clear an acre or two of good dry soil on which to erect a small house and plant a little garden of coconuts and fruit-trees. If the ancestral rice-lands are of small extent, they proceed to extend them by adding a little field or two. By degrees they build and furnish the new house, and make everything ready for the flitting. The migration would not, however, be reckoned as an incident in Malay life if there were no ceremony attached to it. Ceremony dogs every detail, from the propitiation of the Earth Spirits when the soil is wounded by the digging of the foundations of the new house, down to the great day when the old parents invite the neighbours to witness everything that has been done. The villagers assemble; the old people make a speech enumerating all the articles with which they are endowing the new household; the young people express their complete satisfaction with all that has been done for them, and the flitting is accomplished. These formalities are not intended, as a cynic might suggest, to advertise the family reputation for generosity; they are necessary to avoid disputes. Should there subsequently be a quarrel or divorce, every neighbour will be able to testify to the proper distribution of the family property. When the speeches are over, the neighbours go home enriched by an additional subject of conversation, while the new householders indicate their approval of everything by keeping indoors for three days, so as not to display their radiant faces to any malignant spirit of envy that may be lurking about the village. Possessed of a house, a garden and a rice-field, they are now in a position to earn a comfortable living. Of course the above procedure is not invariable. A Malay official cannot afford to live in his wife's house if the Government desires his presence in some other place. Old parents, when their last remaining daughter is married, sometimes move to an annexe or enlarge the house so as to retain their daughter and to save themselves from the danger of being left alone in their old age. Moreover, it is not always possible to find unoccupied land in the vicinity of the house of the old people. The cultivation of all available land in the rice-growing districts of Penang and Province Wellesley has led to an annual exodus to Krian for the padi-planting season. In such cases the new household is apt to make its home in the new country while the old parents keep to their ancestral village. Krian has been largely populated by this planting-out of young families from Province Wellesley; the coast of Selangor is being settled from Malacca; the whole Peninsula is being helped by a similar tide of migration from Sumatra and Banjermasin. But Perak itself is not yet over-populated, and the Perak Malay does not leave his native country. Once settled in his new house the young Malay is "king 61</page><page sequence="63">in his own place"; he can "think of what he pleases and sing whenever he likes." So the proverbs tell us. They also recognise that woman's kingdom is the home - a fact which militates against the young hus- band's perfect freedom. Apart, however, from what the Malays call "the foe in one's own blanket" the householder is independent enough. He works whenever he likes and takes a holiday as often as he pleases. For a few weeks in the year he is very busy in the rice-fields; during the remaining ten months he enjoys comparative leisure. He has his meals at irregular times, goes to mosque irregularly, does a little fishing at odd moments - indeed, apart from padi-planting, most Malay work is done at odd moments: it is not the great business of life. Religion supplies him with a time-table - the lunar calendar of the Muhammadans - with its incidents for each day, week, month and year. It divides up the day with the five daily prayers (which he forgets) and insists on his attending mosque every Friday, unless he can find some excuse for his habitual absences. It also marks off certain days of the year as great religious festivals. The general impression among Malays seems to be that people go to mosque more consistently now than they did in the days of native rule, but there can be no doubt that the easy-going nature of the people is against regularity in any form. The Moslem year is a lunar year unconnected with seasonal events. It begins with the month Muharram. The first day of the year is notr marked by any festivities nor does the month itself contain any special - Sunnite holidays, but Indian Shiite influence shows itself in Penang in the boria performances and in occasional lamentations over the death of the Prophet's grandson Husain. A boria is a troupe of strolling minstrels, generally dressed and drilled as soldiers and headed by a Captain and an Army Chaplain. The troupe visits the houses of wealthy or popular Moslems and serenades them till paid to go away. The songs are sometimes eulogistic and sometimes comic; the tunes are admirably suited for their purpose - pleasing at first and monotonous after a time, so that the troupe is gladly welcomed and gladly dismissed. The religious element is entirely absent from the boria performances and there is no apparent reason for their association with the month of Muharram . Safar , the second month, is regarded as unlucky: to take up any enterprise in Safar is like beginning a journey on a Friday. It is the month in which Muhammad's fatal illness declared itself. The last Wednesday of the month is a religious event, a day of penitence and of ceremonial purification from the sins of the world; but it has been turned by the light-hearted Malays into a sort of bathing-picnic known as the Mandi Safar. The Malays do not take kindly to fasts, but they pay very great attention to the fact that the month is an unlucky one in the matter of work. The twelfth day of the third month is the anniversary of the Prophet's birth and also of his death, but the former event is regarded as the more important. The day is wholly a day of rejoicing, marked by much good cheer and by the chanting of many maulud or Arabic hymns and discourses about the life of Muhammad. In consequence of this great festival the name maulud is often given to the whole month in preference to the orthodox Arabic description of RabVu-l-awwal . Malays, who do like long Arabic words, sometimes use the expression "the four months with the same name" when speaking of the months 62</page><page sequence="64">RabVu-'l-awwal, RabPu-l-akhir&gt; Jamad u-l -awwal, and Jamadu-l-akhir . The names are not the same, but they seem to possess certain family likenesses and are all equally unpronounceable. The next great Moslem holiday is the 27th day of the seventh month, Rajab, the anniversary of the Prophet's journey to heaven. It is a great occasion for chanting and prayer and it is commemorated by all Malays of piety and learning. The eighth month, Shaabcm , is rendered dismal by the approach of the ninth, the Fasting Month. The fifteenth night of Shaaban is believed to be the time when the Almighty shakes the Tree of Life causing the fall of leaves that represent the lives of men. Throughout this night in some parts of Arabia the mosques are thronged with agonised suppliants appealing to the Almighty to allow their lives to be prolonged throughout the coming year. Such scenes are rare in the Peninsula. The Malay calls this event the kanduri roti9 because of the cakes that they eat to commemorate it. The concluding days of Shaaban are marked by many feasts, because the Great Fast is coming on when men may no longer dine in comfort. They represent the days of preparation for the Malay Lent and should be marked by ceremonial ablutions to purify the soul and by much food to fortify the body. They are soon over, and the Great Fast begins. Throughout the month of Ramazan a Moslem is forbidden (between sunrise and sunset) to eat, drink, chew, smoke or swallow. It is a time of misery, mitigated by the possibility of sleeping all day and feasting all night. During the whole of this period the Spirits of Evil are believed to be chained up, so that the superstitious Malay can (and does) go about at night without fear of ghostly visitants. As each sunset approaches a faithful few find their way to the mosque and await in prayer and meditation the exact moment when they will be permitted to break their fast. When sunset comes the worshippers share a light meal of rice-gruel (kanji buka puasa) before returning to their homes. The whole of the month is treated as a sort of a religious retreat, during which great princes like the Sultan of Perak offer a generous hospitality to the pious poor who flock to the palace-assemblies. All through the night there may be heard the long wailing sound of the Arabic chants with which the devotees beguile the weary hours. At last the dawn approaches, the last long meal is taken, and the exhausted worshipper curls up on the floor in sleep. As the end of the month approaches, the fervour of devotion becomes more intense, the special Arabic chants ( tarawih ) become longer, and the strain becomes more cruel. The 26th night is the "Night of Power"1 on which the Koran was sent down to Muhammad, a night when the very trees of the forest are believed to bow in homage towards Mecca; it is a great event and is marked by ceremonial lustration, by nocturnal feasts and by religious services of unusual length. It is the culminating point of the Ramazan devotions. After the "Night of Power" the weary worshipper scans the horizon anxiously for a sight of the new moon that is to put an end to his long-drawn troubles. The new moon comes at last; the Great Fast is followed by the Great Feast. Every Malay dons his finest garments, calls on all his friends, gives his family the best dinner he can afford, sends small gifts 1 Lailatu'l-kadar. 63</page><page sequence="65">of cakes to his European acquaintances and apologizes to his seniors for any offence that he may have committed during the past year. The rejoicings go on for the first three days of the tenth month, Shawwcd. This festival, the hari raya besar , is the nearest Malay equivalent for the English Christmas, the Greek Easter or the Chinese New Year. The next great day is the 10th of the twelfth month, Dzu'l-hijjah. It is the month of the Pilgrimage. On this 10th day the pilgrims at Mecca visit a place called the Mina Bazaar, near Mount Arafat, and offer up a sacrifice to mark the conclusion of the Haj. The day is known in the Straits as the hari raya haji. It is the great day of the haji, the man who has been to Mecca. It is the anniversary of his pilgrimage. On this day the haji - who is often a humble Javanese gardener working in some Singapore or Penang compound - puts on the gorgeous robes and turban of the Arab, takes a holiday and astonishes his employer by his sudden magnificence. The transformation does not last long. In two days the haji is back at work along with his less fortunate friends who have never been to Mecca. This festival is the last of the Moslem year. The Malay possesses another year, a solar year, with holidays and festivals that have no connection with religion. It begins with some definite sign - the height of the Pleiades above the horizon or the seasonal ripening of some fruit1 - telling the ryot that the time for planting is at hand. The true Malay year is a sort of farmer's almanac. Its first festival is marked by the reading of prayers, the burning of incense, and the singing of chants over the mother-seed that is to be used in the rice-nursery. The calendar is marked by further festivals at every stage of cultivation - at the sowing, the transplanting and the harvesting. It is supplemented by special holidays, when mimic fighting or mock-propitiation is used to get the better of the ghostly denizens of the district who prey upon the crops. This solar calendar is only unsatis- factory because it is unauthorised and uncontrolled by any supreme authority, so that its details vary in every part of the Peninsula. It is the relic of an old agricultural religion and belongs properly to the province of Folklore and Malay Belief. None the less its holidays are observed and its feasts are well attended. The exact day for each event is fixed by the local pawang , but it turns upon the state of the crops and the details of the padi-planting industry. The industry is the subject of a special pamphlet and need not be considered here. One thing alone must be discussed: how does rice-planting pay? The whole of Malay life turns on this industry and the crucial point in it is one about which we have singularly little information. Mr. Hale, usually a reliable authority, estimated the average harvest from a five- acre block of good irrigated land in Krian at a total of 3,000 gantang of padi , representing a gross value of $240. Against this he set the land-rent ($5), the water-rate ($10) and a sum of $48 for interest on borrowed capital at the local money-lenders' rate of 24 per cent. Mr. Hale was appealing for a reduction of taxation, and in his anxiety to forestall any criticism of his figures he made out a strong case against himself. His figures seem too high. In 1907 a most interesting experiment was made in Krian by order of the Director of Agriculture. Eight small pieces of land were marked off and cultivated in different ways in 1 The per ah fruit. 64</page><page sequence="66">order to test the relative effectiveness of different processes of planting. The bulkiest crop (366 gantang to the acre) was obtained from the land cultivated by Banjarese according to their own native methods. Some instructive differences were noticed in the three other fields cultivated by Banjarese on their own lines as modified in some small detail by the Director. The average for the four Banjarese fields was 328 gantang per acre. A field cultivated by Tamils gave a poorer result. A field treated with bone manure gave a miserable crop (128 gantang to the acre); selection of local seed by weight was a failure (164 gantang to the acre), and the importation of special seed from Ceylon resulted in a complete fiasco. The local ryots, who saw in these experiments an attempt to improve on their own methods, summed up the situation with the pithy proverb that it is useless to teach swimming to ducks. Still, these figures make it abundantly clear that Mr. Hale's estimate of 600 gantang to the acre is too high for an average. The crop of 366 gantang was declared to be a fair crop for the locality.1 Mr. Hale's estimated price of 8 cents per gantang is also rather high. Taking 350 gantang at 8 cents as a conservative estimate we find that the harvest of land in Krian, after deducting land-rent and water-rate, works out at $25 an acre. If we set against this sum the tithe taken by the mosque, the cost of buffaloes (if used for ploughing), and the money-lender's interest at 24 per cent., it may fairly be contended that rice-planting does not pay. As a matter of fact, it does pay. Mr. P. A. Thompson2 estimates the gross value of the rice-crop in Siam at about £3 55. an acre, and looks upon this figure as very profitable, though it corresponds almost exactly with the Krian estimate. A loan at 24 per cent, is not a business transaction, nor does a Malay borrow money to open up new land; indeed, he could not get his loan till he has cultivated his land and secured his title. He borrows money for some wedding-ceremony or as security for a friend; and we ought not to lay at the door of the rice-growing industry the improvidence and recklessness of individual ryots. When all is said and done, a profit of $125 (on a five-acre block for some five months' work) is good profit, as native incomes go, especially when we remember that much of the work of padi-planting is little more than the leisurely duty of watching a growing crop. Rice-growing is not the Malay peasant's sole means of livelihood. He usually has his little holding with its thirty or forty coconut trees round his house.3 With an annual yield of 50 nuts per tree and an average price of 4 cents a nut he may get anything from $50 to $80 a year from this source. If he resides near the sea he can earn an appre- ciable amount by working as a fisherman. If he lives near a forest he may gather and sell rattans and other jungle produce. In some places he can make great profits by cutting the nipah palms and making house-roofing. If his house is near a high road he may keep a cart or carriage and earn an occasional dollar by letting it out on hire. In many cases he has some special source of income of his own - he may be a mosque-official or a Koran-teacher or a school-master or a smith. 1 In the following year much better crops were obtained, one plot yielding 600 gantang to the acre. The mill buys padi at 7 cents a gantang , paid in advance. 2 "Lotus-land," p. 183. 3 I have heard it said on good authority that 25 coconut trees will support a Malay family. 65</page><page sequence="67">Separately considered these sources of profit amount to very little; collectively they mean a great deal. They must represent an average of some $15 to $20 a month and would be much more if the rice-planters made full use of their opportunities and leisure. As it is, the Malay peasant is never likely to furnish a plentiful supply of cheap labour; he is far too well-off for that. He may take odd jobs and small contracts, but he will not consent to exchange his lot for that of a regular wage- earner on an estate. Why, indeed, should he? His life is varied, pleasant, and healthy; it supplies him with all that he needs; it allows him ample leisure and absolute personal freedom. It enables us to understand why the ceremonies at a peasant's wedding can go on for a week and be attended by the whole village without dislocating the industries of the locality. All that is necessary is the choice of a suitable season - the month after the harvest - when everyone is at leisure and the granaries are full. Agriculture is the soul of Malay life. The ryot may hear of lunar months and of the years of the Hegira, but he speaks of "years of rice" or "years of maize," and he dates an incident as "so many harvests ago." He is essentially a planter; his festivals are seasonal; his joys and sorrows depend on the crops; and his whole life is regulated by the great rice-planting industry. 66</page><page sequence="68">SICKNESS AND DEATH When a Malay becomes so ill that the ministrations of the local herbalists are of no avail he sends for the pawang. Now the pawang is a very unorthodox person: historically he is the priest of an older religion and theoretically a trafficker with evil spirits and a dabbler in the blackest of black art. To the pious dignitaries of the mosque the pawang is an abomination, because he represents the accredited agent of the Devil. But the sick man is not likely to stand upon such ceremony; believing as he does that all sickness comes from the Evil One he will not be deterred by any rules of propriety from entering into negotiations with his tormentor. He sends for the pawang. The pawang realises the delicacy of the situation and begins with mild measures: he tries to feed the Evil One. He hangs out baskets of food and cakes in the jungle - raw food and cooked food, vegetable food and animal food, dainties to suit all tastes. If the spirit is malicious enough to go on tormenting the poor sick man after such kindness has been shown, the pawang tries a little mild deception. Having built a sacrificial boat, filled it with money and provisions, and induced the evil spirits to step on board, he sets it adrift on the river to float away to its fate in the Great Sea. If the demon of disease is too canny to be taken in by these temptations - well, there is no help for it: a berhantu ceremony must be resorted to. It is wicked; but what else is the poor sick man to do? Sir Frank Swettenham has described a berhantu ceremony;1 so has Mr. Skeat.2 These accounts must suffice for those who desire to know what the performance looks like. But descriptions are of all sorts: one may dwell on the ridiculous aspect of an incident, and another may resolve itself into detailed inventory of the pawang* s paraphernalia and a word-for-word record of the formulae that he uttered. In neither case does the description give much of a clue to the real significance of a berhantu ; and, after all, the principal question is, "What does the ceremony mean?" Sir Frank's sick man was a reigning Sultan; Mr. Skeat's was a peasant, the brother of his collector. Sir Frank's pawang was "a woman in male attire - in ordinary life she was an amusing lady named Raja Ngah, a scion of the reigning house on the female side"; Mr. Skeat's pawang was a man of no special importance. Sir Frank's orchestra consisted of "five or six girls holding native drums" and was headed by the daughter of Raja Ngah; Mr. Skeat's was only the pawang'' s wife, "an aged woman whose office was to chant the invocation." Sir Frank's ghostly visitant was the aristocratic Israng , the special familiar of Raja Ngah; Mr. Skeat's was the plebeian tiger-spirit, the common property of the whole Malay world. There is a vast difference in the importance of the incidents described; Mr. Skeat's may be called a vulgar or workaday berhantu , while Sir Frank's represented a minor incident in the history of the State. In a shadowy way we can also find outlined for us in the dry records of a Straits Settlements blue-book the story of a much greater berhantu - one that was a major incident in the history of the State. When Sultan Abdullah was charged with complicity in the assassination 1 "Malay Sketches," pp. 153- 159. 2 "Malay Magic," pp. 436 - 444. 67</page><page sequence="69">of the British Resident, one of the allegations against him was that he had "sent off a boat to Pasir Panjang to fetch down the Raja Kechil Muda and his son, Raja Ahmad, to conduct a main berhantu in his presence," and that the object of the performance was in some way connected with the murder of Mr. Birch. Mr. Plunket, who conducted the enquiry, had only a vague idea of what a berhantu was. He described it as "a superstitious performance which the Perak people have learnt from the Sakais or wild men of the interior for looking into the future by calling up spirits and questioning them; on this occasion in all seriousness the Sultan sent for Raja Kechil Muda and his son (as skilled persons in such performances) to conduct a main berhantu as a preli- minary ceremony to carrying out the conspiracy, already formed against Mr. Birch's life The performances on the first and second nights were merely preliminary introductions to what was to follow, but on the third night Sultan Abdullah, having been possessed by seven spirits in succession, spoke out and declared that Mr. Birch would be dead in a month." Such was Mr. Plunket's interpretation of the incident, though his account is not borne out by the evidence. The performance took place at Batak Rabit on or about the 24th August, 1875. There is no doubt from the evidence that the pawang at this great berhantu were the Raja Kechil Muda and his son, Raja Ahmad. "On this night," said one witness, "the devils asked to be paid, and Raja Kechil Muda replied that the devils would be paid with a boatload of offerings when Mr. Birch was dead. One of the Sultan's devils declared that the devil which would kill Mr. Birch resided at Kuala Perak." Another witness testified as follows: "Raja Ahmad said that he could qall up Mr. Birch's spirit for $100. The Sultan agreed to pay this sum Raja Ahmad said that what the Sultan wanted was being done. The Sultan said, 'Will what I want happen?' Raja Ahmad said, 'It will'." Another eye-witness described "the performance which took place. At its conclusion Raja Ahmad said to Sultan Abdullah, 'Now I have done for Mr. Birch, but I won't do it properly unless you pay me.' Sultan Abdullah replied, 'I will pay you without fail if you can only get Mr. Birch out of Bandar Baharu'." The evidence records the surprise that was felt at a berhantu being held when nobody was ill, and it works up to the conclusion that the Sultan "wanted to do something wrong to Mr. Birch and that he wanted to kill him by sorcery." Although the eye-witnesses were very reluctant to talk about what had happened, the general drift of their evidence was that the wizards were the Raja Kechil Muda and his son, that the fee was $100, besides the offerings to the spirits, that the spirits invoked ("the Sultan's devils") were the jin kerajaan or divinities of the State, and that the hope was that these mighty spirits would wreck Mr. Birch's launch off Kuala Perak and down him in the sea. In the three berhantu performances to which reference has been made we find that the importance of the incident increases with the importance of the pawang , the greatness of the spirits, and the magnitude of the fee. "As one star exceeds another in glory," says Sir Frank Swettenham, "so one jin surpasses another in renown, and I have named them in the order of their renown. In their honour four white and crimson umbrellas were hung in the room, presumably for their use when they arrived from their distant homes. Only the Sultan of 68</page><page sequence="70">the State is entitled to traffic with these distinguished Spirits; when summoned they decline to move unless appealed to with their own special invocations, set to their own peculiar music, sung by at least four singers, and let by a Biduan (singer) of the royal family There are common devils who look after common people; such as Hantu Songkai , Hantu Melayu and Hantu Belian ; the last the Tiger-Devil, but out of politeness he is called Belian to save his feelings." It was this last "tiger-devil" that Mr. Skeat saw; and even Raja Ngah's familiar, Israng, whose antics are described in "Malay Sketches," was not as aristocratic as the umbrella-using dignitaries of whom Sir Frank speaks. On one point Sir Frank is in error, though so near the truth that the very subtlety of the distinction has led him off the trail of an interesting fact. There are two Sultans in Perak: one is "the Sultan of the State" and the other is the Sultan "who is entitled to traffic with these distinguished spirits." This latter sovereign, the Sultan Muda as he is called, is chosen from the royal house; his wife is a titular queen, the Raja Che ' Puan Muda ; and he has a deputy or heir-apparent known as the Raja Kechil Muda, But it is the law of the State that this spiritual Sultan, prince of the blood-royal though he be, may never succeed to the secular Sultanate of the State. His kingdom has nothing to do with this visible world of Perak; he rules over the Spirits of the Land and can convene eerie courts to be attended by ghosts of all grades of dignity from the great "Twin Brother of the Heavens," who came into existence when the universe was created, down to the humble arak-arak jin sa-ribuy "the ghosts who follow in procession, a thousand ghosts at a time." The president of this ghostly court is the Sultan Muda (or his deputy, the Raja Kechil Muda). He knows the exact title by which each Spirit must be addressed and the subtle distinctions of rank between them. He alone can summon the very highest ghosts in the land, and his fee for doing so is $100 in all. These facts may throw some light on a few of the details of the mysterious berhantu at Batak Rabit that was brought up against Sultan Abdullah at his trial. They may also explain the following minor incident in the early history of British intervention in Perak. When the Pangkor Treaty was made and Sir Andrew Clarke's advisers were looking for a Malay title to serve as a dignified equivalent for the English term "ex-Sultan," some one in Singapore unfortunately coined the expression Sultan Muda as suitable for the purpose in view. With many expressions of goodwill and with the very best intentions this devil-derived dignity was offered by the British Government to the aged and religious Sultan Ismail, a descendant of the Prophet, by way of consoling him for the loss of the throne of Perak. The embarrassed ex-Sultan - not knowing exactly what to think - suggested in a mild way to Mr. Birch that another title, such as Sultan Baginda , would suit him better. Mr. Birch suspected that the new title might conceal some deep design and referred the matter to the Singapore adviser on Malay affairs (Mr. T. Braddell, c.m.g.) for an explanation of the difference between the two designations. Mr. Braddell was completely non-plussed. In the end, it was decided, with some misgivings, that the ex-Sultan might be allowed to please himself in this matter. Among the regalia of Perak is a set of small cups (resembling Chinese tea-cups but with serrated rims) that are used by the Sultan 69</page><page sequence="71">Muda in his incantations. So, too, a very handsome golden bowl,1 with a cover of gold and a saucer of suasa studded with precious stones, is said to have done service in these berhantu ceremonies. Under the ancient Government of Perak it was the feudal obligation of the villagers of Pasir Garam to erect the nine-staged pavilion used for the ceremonial lustrations after a princely berhantu. Although few people in Perak know who the Sultan Muda is and although his office and that of tjie Raja Kechil Muda do not figure in the Annual Estimates, every section of his duties and every detail of his costume are most clearly defined by the unwritten custom of the country. The ceremony of the berhantu commenced at 8 p.m., when the Sultan Muda, dressed in the prescribed robes, made his formal entry and took his seat on the puadca, a narrow mat only used on such occasions. His head would be veiled with a scarf of many colours. Rice-dust was scattered about to avert ill-luck, incense was burnt, and the Sultan Muda, grasping a handful of sambau grass, bowed, folded his arms, and gave the signal for the invocation to begin. The Chief Minstrel2 - to the accompaniment of an orchestra of drums - then chanted his appeal to the Spirits of the Country, one by one in the strict order of their precedence, to attend the audience of their King. A strange assembly was this ghostly Court of Perak. It numbered among its aristocrats spirits borrowed from all religions and from every part of the world, souls of orthodox rulers like Ali, Ahmad and Solomon, deities of India like Brahma and Vishnu, nature-gods like the "Supporter of the Heavens" and the "Ruler of the Storm," and divinities of special localities like the Dato' of Mount Berembun. Invoked by their proper names and titles - for no mistake was permissible on this point - the Spirits would come in, one by one, announcing their arrival by the flicker of the tapers used in the performance. As each Great Spirit arrived the Sultan Mudas would turn to the Chief Singer and enquire in set phrases if all was well. In language that was equally well studied the Singer would reply that all was indeed well, and that the object of the meeting was the convocation of all the Spirits to a great feast to be held on the morrow. The Singer would then go on to invoke the next Spirit in order of precedence, and, as the Ghosts of Perak are many, the ceremony would drag on far into the night. Early the next morning the Sultan Muda and the Raja Kechil Muda paid their first ceremonial visit to the pavilion of lustration, the great nine-storeyed scaffolding erected by the men of Pasir Garam. At the summit of the pavilion was the image of a bird, the jentayu that lives on the dew of heaven and is ever calling for the rain. Below this image were many minor decorations and offerings - streamers of cloth and paper, strings of flowers and fronds, square rice-packets and long rice- packets, cakes and pastry, jars of water, joints of sugar-cane, food of all sorts - and prominent among them all would be the grisly head of a pink buffalo sacrificed in honour of the occasion. Everything was on a lavish scale, befitting the greatness of the ghostly guests. The Sultan Muda having seen that all was ready would return home. Then in the half-light of evening, "when faces can just be recognised," he would 1 Known as a Mutidam. It is an Achehnese bowl and is said to date back to the time of Mar hum Besar Aulia'llah. 2 Biduan. 3 As the medium of the Spirit in question. 70</page><page sequence="72">come back and ascend the tower along with his heir-apparent and a train of attendant pawang. Bowing to the four quarters of the heavens he would wave the offerings in each direction as an invitation to the Spirits to approach and partake of the provisions that had been consecrated to their use. Later on the whole party, meeting at the palace, held another and wilder berhantu , appealing desperately to the Spirits of the Country to help the sick king in his hour of distress. The great drums of royalty, the holy regalia of the State and even the maiden daughters of the royal house were brought out to do honour to the invisible guests; the feast was of the very best, and every effort would be made to thoroughly propitiate the Spirits. The sick Sultan was laid on a curious sixteen-sided dais, the peterakna panchalogam , specially prepared for these occasions, and the berhantu invocations would then go on as before. On the third day (or later) the Sultan, if cured, was taken to the lofty nine-staged pavilion and was ceremonially bathed by the Sultan Muda and his attendants. This lustration marked the final recovery of the royal patient. It gave the Sultan Muda a claim to his fee of $100 - $25 for himself, $25 for the Raja Kechil Muda, and $50 for his suite of wizards. We are, of course, speaking of royal illnesses. When the patient was a man of humble birth, the ceremony was simpler, the pawang was less authoritative, the spirit was a "common devil," and the fee was less - witness the ceremony recorded by Mr. Skeat. All these things are questions of degree. In describing a berhantu we must allow for the importance of the occasion, and lastly we must reckon with another possibility suggested in the pithy summing-up of my Malay informant about these berhantu performances: "All these things cost money - and sometimes they only make the patient worse." Was the Spirit at a berhantu ceremony to be regarded as an enemy to whom the sick man had to pay ransom? Or was he an ally called in to fight the hostile Demons of Disease? Probably the latter - or the berhantu against Mr. Birch would have been meaningless - but possibly he was a little of both. The ways of demons are inscrutable. The ghosts of the State should be the allies of the State, but they might consider it a service to the country to remove a Sultan instead of curing him. In such a case the Sultan's appeals might be promises of repentance. We will return therefore to the eventuality already suggested - the possi- bility that the din and excitement of the coming of the Spirits may have only pushed the patient a little nearer to the grave. Hope is given up; the pawang returns home to find excuses for his failure, and the poor despairing invalid, having failed to get well either by fair means or foul, hands himself over to the last ministrations of the orthodox leaders of religion. The imam and his fellow-dignitaries of the mosque are bound by duty to attend at the deathbed of a dying believer and to prepare him for the great change by repeating seven times in his ear the assertion of the Unity of God, the cardinal pillar of the Moslem faith. As with the Hebrew whose last words should be "Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is One God," so also the dying Moslem should pass to the hereafter while testifying to the same great truth. He endeavours therefore to listen to the imam and to repeat the Arabic formula after him, "though feebly and incorrectly for the power of his tongue is broken." He dies, and the attendants immediately bind up his jaw, pinion his arms to his 71</page><page sequence="73">sides, fasten his lower limbs together and lay him reverently on a couch in the great centre-room of his house. At nightfall torches are lit and the neighbours assemble, the men to pray and the women to weep and lament, while the inmates of the house are kept busy providing refreshment for all who come to render the last honours to the dead. All through the night, if possible, the Koran should be chanted. In the morning the preparations for interment commence. The men prepare the Iodise coffin in which the body is borne to the grave and the rough litter on which the coffin is carried. The women get ready the sireh, the small coins and the fragrant leaves that are to be used in the course of the coming ceremony. As noon approaches the body must be washed for the last time. For this purpose it is usually laid on rollers of banana-trunk, but in special cases of distinguished honour it may be allowed to rest on the legs of relatives and friends. The lustration is done by an expert, and consists partly of real cleansing and partly of ceremonial purification. When all is over, the body is dried with a towel, perfumed with camphor and sandal-wood, plugged against im- purities, and shrouded in a long white wrapper with fastenings taken from its own unravelled edges. The last toilet of the dead is now complete. A short prayer is said, a little money is scattered about, and the body is placed in the coffin and borne outside the house. There a short funeral service is held. When this is over, a pall is thrown over the coffin and the litter is lifted on the shoulders of the attendants and borne to the cemetery, a procession following and singing the creed. It would be quite wrong to use a wheeled vehicle for such purposes, and many are the devices resorted to for evading the difficulty. In some very stately funerals it is said that concealed hearses have been used while the "bearers" marched by the side of the hearse and pretended to carry the coffin. In some cases the bearers have stood in the carriage and supported the coffin on their shoulders. But the law on the point is unmistakable. Even the present constitutional Sultan of Turkey at the lowest ebb of his fortunes was able to veto the use of a gun-carriage at a military funeral given by the Young Turks. A Malay grave is like an English grave, except that a long niche or cavity is usually dug along the side of the main trench. The body rests in the niche and not in the principal hollow. Should the earth be too loose to allow of a niche being made, a cavity is dug along the bottom of the trench and the body is laid in this cavity. In some cases a sort of three-sided bottomless coffin is used. In all these methods the essential point is that the body shall lie on the earth but not the earth on the body. The niche or cavity is closed in by a plank, or else the three-sided coffin is placed over the corpse to protect it from the soil above. The loose coffin used in the procession to the cemetery is not buried at all, the body is taken out of it for interment. When this is done a clod of earth is held to the nostrils of the dead to suggest a notion of what is happening, and the fastening of the grave-clothes is partially unloosed to allow him to rise slightly when listening to the prayer known as the talkin. The body is then placed in its aperture; the aperture is closed up and the trench is filled. After the burial a few more prayers are said - notably the talkin or last exhortation to the deceased - and alms are distributed among the pious poor. A few of the friends go back to the house of mourning 72</page><page sequence="74">and assist in chanting the Koran during the night. On the third day a funeral feast is held in honour of the departed. If the relatives can afford it, similar funeral feasts may be held on the seventh, fortieth and hundredth day after the death. Gifts are made to the mosque authorities - a mat to the expert who washes the body, the pall to the imam who recites the burial service, and other customary fees in rice, coconuts, sugar-cane and money. Temporary wooden marks are set up to show the place of interment, and are replaced at a later date by tombstones if the relatives of the deceased are well-off. Round posts are set up for a man, flat planks for a woman. Of the two marks put up, the headstone is much the larger, and the space between the pair (about three feet) is usually filled up by a low ridge of earth. A few monuments are very elaborate. The tombs of the early Perak kings were of the Achehnese type - ■ four-sided monumental headstones carved with the confession of faith. So are the graves at the ancient Pefak capital, Bruas, and so also is the tomb of the great Upper Perak female saint, To' Temong, who played some part in the legendary history of the country. About a.d. 1700 the type seems to have suddenly changed. The gravestone of the Sultan Marhum Besar Aulia 'llah is of a curious polygonal type narrow at the base and increasing near the top. The monument of Marhum Kahar is of the same type and far more elaborately carved; the headstone is joined to the other by a long stone block five or six feet long and carved with the triple crescentic dokoh that was the sign of royalty and a long narrow cutting that fills with rain and supplies water for the birds of the air to drink - but whether this was its real object I cannot say. Older graves have been found in Perak; some indeed are lined with slabs of stone and contain broken pottery and even cornelian beads. But were they Malay? Of their origin nothing is known. The Malays, who are extremely conservative in the matter of old ceremonial, give us nothing in their burial-customs that is not of the most orthodox Moslem character. It may be that they used formerly to dispose of their dead otherwise than by interment - but this point must be left to be dealt with in the course of another chapter. 73</page><page sequence="75">CONCLUDING NOTES The Malay cares nothing for consistency; he does not exchange old customs for new; he keeps both the new and the old. He is indeed afraid, to give up the old. "Again and again have I tried to abandon this inconvenient system [of coinage]," said a Pahang prince to Abdullah Munshi; "but the tigers took to eating men, and the crocodiles became hungrier, and I desisted." The Malay is afraid to give up an ancient practice because he fears the vengeance of the creators of the practice; he thinks that the dead hand of some old lawgiver may reach out over the intervening centuries and strike down the impious being who dares to alter what past ages have approved. To meet this difficulty he keeps the old while adopting the new. He has gone on preserving custom after custom and ceremony after ceremony till his whole life is a sort of museum of ancient customs - an ill-kept and ill-designed museum in which no exhibit is dated, labelled or explained. For the Malay has not retained these old ceremonies for their own sake or because he loves them; he has preserved them as mere formalities: dead things for the satisfaction of his dead ancestors. If the European observer examines the bridegroom's offerings at a Perak wedding he will see that they are mere dummies of wood and paper got up to represent coconuts, firewood and cattle. Malay custom is largely a matter of dummies. Some day when elephants become scarce the elephant at a raja's installation will be replaced by a figure of bamboo and tissue-paper, a mere symbol to be borne along in the train of a prince. Why indeed should it be otherwise? The elephant is no longer there as a beast of burden; he only figures in the procession to gratify the ghostly majesty of ancient kings who like to see their descendants keep up the traditional forms of royalty. Malay ceremonial, as we have said, is a museum of dead customs kept up for the benefit of the dead. It is unlabelled and unexplained because the men of old who made each custom may be safely trusted to know its nature and its meaning, and if the men of old had left us records of their times in the form of ancient history and literature they might have helped us to understand every incident in the long drama of Malay ceremonial. But they have left us very little. As guides they fail us; they force us to infer and to surmise where we ought to be able to speak with confidence; all that they can do is indicate the lines on which research must proceed. We must work historically. We can best begin by eliminating the modern Moslem elements - the henna- staining, the marriage contract and prayers, the entire funeral ceremony, the practice of circumcision, and the festivals that make up the lunar year. Of the Hindu elements we cannot speak so positively: they probably include the bridal rice, the bridal thread, much of the lustration ceremony and some details of the propitiatory sacrifices. But when we have eliminated these Hindu and Moslem details we are still far from the bedrock of Indonesian custom; we have to distinguish between essentials and accessories. Dances and feasting are accessories to weddings all over the world, yet they are not really a part of the marriage ceremony; they belong to the great province of merrymaking. The "enthronement" at a Malay marriage is merely honorific; the "lustrations" are rites of 74</page><page sequence="76">purification; the offerings to evil spirits are made to avert ill-luck. Rites of this sort, like feasts and dances, accompany every great Malay ceremony; they are common accessories, not true essentials. It is only when we have set aside these items that we get at the real traces of old Indonesian custom. To describe a Malay wedding by giving an account of the bersanding is like publishing the menu of a wedding breakfast as an example of an English marriage-service. After this rough classification of the items that make up our Malay museum of ancient custom we can proceed to discuss the various exhibits one by one. Let us begin with the Moslem exhibits as being the most modern and the easiest to identify and understand. In the matter of marriage-custom Islam has exercised very little influence. It brought in the brief religious service at which the contract is ratified and witnessed, and it identified an old Indonesian customary payment, the mas kahwin , with its own mahr or marriage-settlement. These two items represent the barest requirements of Muhammadan Law. In the matter of un- essential Islam only introduced one rite - the henna-staining. This henna-staining is accompanied in Malaya by a peculiar dance performed to a special tune: the dancers (men and women in turn) balance a cup or vessel to which lighted taper are affixed while they go through the prescribed steps; they are expected to play with the cup and even to invert it without extinguishing the lights by the jerkiness of their move- ments. In the matter of funeral-ceremonies Islam exercises a complete monopoly. In circumcision we should expect a similar monopoly, and we find it in Southern Malaya (if accessories are eliminated) but not in Northern Malaya, where the circumcision-ceremonies are very elaborate, take place at a comparatively late age and are regarded almost as a recognition of puberty and as a preliminary to marriage. In the matter of the calendar the influence of Islam is very distinct: it monopolises the festivals of the lunar year and surrenders the solar year to older Malay creeds. These few points summarise Muhammadan influence on Malay ceremonial. What are we to make of them all? It would seem that when Islam came to the Peninsula it found in existence a solar calendar, a very elaborate system of wedding-ceremonies, a complete absence of burial ceremonies and - in the North but not in the South - an important festival that was accepted as analogous to circumcision. There is evidence to show that such inferences would not be incorrect. Cremation was practised by the Malacca Malays during the first half of the fifteenth century - so every contemporary Chinese navigator tells us most positively. Cremation is still found in Hindu Bali and is constantly mentioned in old Malay romances; it is, in fact, the common practice of Hinduism and Buddhism. It is not found among the abori- gines of the Peninsula, nor is it to be traced among such wild tribes as the Borneo Dyaks and Philippine Igorrots. Under the circumstances, we might have inferred that the ancient Malays buried their dead till they accepted Hinduism and Buddhism; that they then began to burn their dead, and that they finally abandoned cremation for burial when they became Moslems. Curiously enough, there is strong evidence against such an inference, plausible though it seems at first sight. In the North of the Peninsula there is positive proof of the existence of tree-burial, a practice that survives to this day in spite of the hostility of Buddhist 75</page><page sequence="77">priests, Moslem Imams and Siamese Governors. The Buddhist Malayo- Siamese are like their Moslem cousins in that they believe ordinary religion to be sufficient for ordinary cases, but consider that exceptional cases demand exceptional treatment. If a man dies a "bad" death he is not interred or cremated; he is given tree-burial so that his soul may have peace. The body is "rolled up in a mat and then in a casing of split bamboo so as to form a cigar-shaped bundle which is suspended between two trees in a waste place or hung up in the fork between two branches."1 Moreover, even when a man has died a normal death his relatives sometimes attempt to combine the new and the old by putting the body into an aerial coffin2 for some days prior to cremation. Tree-burial must at one time have been a very common practice in the Northern States of the Peninsula though we cannot trace it in the South. There were also other and stranger ways of disposing of the dead. "Among the Malays [of Patani]," says one authority, "interment is the universal rule at present; but it is said that until recently people who had died a bad or unlucky death were frequently cast out to be eaten by dogs and vultures."3 There are no vultures to be found further south than Perak. We may, however, compare with the Patani tradition the following passage in the "Malay Annals" giving the words of the Aru Ambassador to Pasai, "Better die at once and on this spot: if the dogs of Pasai are to eat me, be it so!" Let us also couple with these words the following statements of ancient Chinese writers on Java: When their parents die they carry them to the forest and allow them to be eaten by dogs; if they are not devoured completely they are very sorry. The remains are burned, and often the wives and concubines are burned also to accompany the head.4 Their burial rites are as follows. When a father or mother is about to die the sons and daughters ask whether after death he or she would prefer to be eaten by dogs, to be burnt or to be thrown into the water. The parents give their orders according to their wishes and after their death their directions are carried out. If it is their wish to be eaten by dogs the body is carried to the seashore or into the wilderness where dogs soon arrive; if the flesh of the corpse is eaten completely it is considered propitious, but if not the sons and daughters lament and weep and throw the remains into the water.5 The circumcision-ceremonies both in the North and the South are very elaborate. In the South they are made elaborate by the accessories (the enthronement, the lustrations and the propitiation of evil spirits); but the essentials are Moslem. In the North the rite of circumcision is regarded as the equivalent of the Buddhist tonsure ceremony: one is masok Melayu , the other is masok Siam . When the Northern Malays became Moslems they may well have grafted circumcision upon the old tonsure ceremony. In any case, Malay ceremonial bears out clearly enough the view that Islam overlaid Hinduism in Southern Malaya and Buddhism in the North. We can now pass to the Hindu elements in Malay ceremonial. They are hard to identify because Malay Muhammadanism itself came from 1 "Fasciculi Malayenses," Anthropology, Part II (a), page 84. 2 Aerial coffins are said to be used by the Northern Sakai also in the case of the death of one of their Dawans. 3 "Fasciculi Malayenses," Anthropology, Part II (a), page 77. 4 History of the Ming Dynasty. 5 Ying Yai Sheng Lan (a.d. 1416). 76</page><page sequence="78">a Hindu country and has a strong South-Indian colouring. Still in the bridal rice1 shared by the newly-married pair, in the bridal thread2 passed round them at the lustration, and in the bathing pavilion3 erected for this rite, we have not only Indian customs but actual Indian names. These, of course, are minor details. The influence of Hinduism went further: by creating Malay dignities and the whole theory of kingship it may be said to be behind the entire ceremony of enthronement. But Hinduism exercised its power at second-hand; its direct influence is neither interesting nor important in matters of custom. The accessories of Malay ceremonial - the enthronement, the lus- trations, and the propitiatory rites - demand some attention. The propitiatory rites belong to the province of Malay Magic or Malay Belief; they need not be here discussed. The lustrations are probably Hindu. The bersanding or enthronement is extremely interesting, though not in the sense in which it is usually studied. It is a ceremony in which the bride and bridegroom play at royalty; they sit in state on a royal dais, wear regalia and receive the homage of the assembled guests. They play most interesting parts - the parts of an ancient king and queen - acted to the staging of an old-world throne and court. The European observer looks on and thinks that he sees a wedding. But he forgets that the subject of the drama is royalty and not marriage; he will learn nothing about Malay marriage-theories from a mere glorification of the bridal pair. Let us compare for a moment the enthronement of a Perak bride- groom with the enthronement of the Sultan himself - and in this connection it may be mentioned that a Perak prince wears as his wedding-jewels articles taken from the actual regalia of the State. At his coronation a Sultan wears a golden chain, three gold breast-ornaments, golden bracelets shaped like dragons, a gold-sheathed keris , a golden- hilted sword and a silver seal mounted on a piece of wood. A Perak prince at his wedding only wears the chain, the breast ornaments, the bracelets and the keris. The difference is important. The chain, the breast ornaments, the bracelets and the keris are true regalia; the sword and the seal are dynastic heirlooms. The sword is the "sword of Alexander"; the seal is the "seal of Alexander"; they are historic things, but there is no legend attaching to the regalia worn by the bridegroom. The Perak bridegroom is imitating royalty in general; he is not copying any particular line of kings. The drama at which he is playing is other than the Perak dynasty; it has remained practically unchanged (as the "Malay Annals" prove to us) since the days of the Malacca kings; it probably goes back to the old Palembang kingdom with its strong Javanese affinities. Wherever the old Palembang tradition exists - in Pahang, Johor, Riau, Malacca, Selangor and Perak - the "enthronement" or bersanding varies very little. But if we leave the Palembang area and cross into Patani, we find a complete change. We see an "enthronement," it is true, but it is not the enthronement of a Palembang king. The ceremony is different; the regalia are different. We see before us the ghost of the ancient Northern Courts and of the old and high civilisations that have been crushed out of existence by the Siamese. From the custom and ceremonial of the Northern Malays we may yet learn much about the history of this most interesting part of the Peninsula. 1 Nasi berastakona. 2 Benang pancharona. 3 Pancha-persada. 77</page><page sequence="79">We can go back further still, to the old Indonesian days before the Malays knew aught about Hinduism or Buddhism or Islam. Do the pantun- contests at a wedding or betrothal speak of a time when women had more liberty and when courtship was allowed to precede marriage? Probaby they do, though that time is indeed remote. The freedom allowed to unmarried girls among most of the less civilised Indonesian tribes and even among the Menangkabau Malays makes it seem probable enough that there was a time when Malay marriage was a matter of mutual selection. Despotism would soon change all that; the will of a chief was not to be gainsaid. The poetic elements remained, but their tone changed; the bride became a diamond to be bought and not a girl to be courted. It seems fairly clear that the position of women has sunk since the old Menangkabau days when they owned all the land and treated a husband as "the dog about the house." The fact that the Malay husband still comes to live in his wife's house is evidence that the wife's position must once have been the higher one. The customs of the Dyaks, Bataks and Igorrots suggest a further question: Did the Malays ever practise trial-marriage? There is no evidence of it in the present wedding ceremony; on the country, the virtue of the bride is guarded, praised and prized. Still, it would be unsafe to speak confidently on this point beyond saying that if the practice of trial-marriage ever existed all traces of it have long since passed away. Again, we may ask ourselves: How long are these old Malay ceremonies likely to survive? Not long, perhaps. The Malay is becoming educated; he is commencing to believe in newspapers and books, and, above all, he is beginning to have a good conceit of himself. Why should he defer to the custodians of these ancient customs, old and ignorant people who cannot read and write? He does not discard - he would not be a Malay if he did - but he improves upon what went before and his improvements are of a most deadly character. There was once a Malay who tried to introduce poetic elements into the official letter-writing of the State Secretariat with which he was connected. The object was laudable enough, but the fond expressions used by Malay lovers seemed singularly out of place in official documents. Anyone who attends a modern Malay ceremony, be it a wedding or an ear-boring or even the installation of a prince, will be struck by the inevitable confusion between the new and the old. Not even Malay conservatism will suffice to preserve the old customs of the country from the disinte- grating influence of modern improvements. The change in Malay life is not really for the worse. The ancient Malay planted for his own consumption; the Malay of the future will plant to sell. In the old days of insecurity when trade was impossible the size of a holding was regulated by the needs of the family and rarely exceeded two or three acres of rice-land and a garden of some ten or twelve coconut-trees. Surplus rice was almost unsaleable; the extra labour was wasted. But the modern Malay - in Krian, at least - deals with five-acre blocks and exports what he does not need for himself. The size of the holding of the future will be regulated by capacity to produce rather than by capacity to consume. The present time is a time of transition. In their early admiration for foreign art 78</page><page sequence="80">many Malays melted down their precious native silver and had it remade by Chinese craftsmen. They now regret it. Such mistakes are inevitable in days of change. Compared with the great economic move- ments that are going on all round us the changes in ceremonial may seem of little account, but seeing how much national history is crystallised in the old ceremonies of the people it would be a pity if Malay custom was allowed to perish unrecorded. 79</page><page sequence="81">APPENDICES A By Raja Haji Yahya ANTE-NATAL CEREMONIES BAB PERI MANDI BUNTING DAN MELENGGANG PERUT DAN MENEMPAH BIDAN Maka sa-t&amp;lah gSnap-lah 7 bulan p&amp;rSmpuan itu m&amp;ngandong, maka ibu bapa laki-laki itu-pun bSrsiap-lah akan sakalian alat h&amp;ndak mSlenggang dan mandi bunting s£rta mSn&amp;mpah bidan akan m£nantu-nya itu, sSrta b&amp;rmuafakat dSngan ibu bapa si-pSrSmpuan itu.

Padi Sniping huma di-tSngah, GSliga di-puncha kain; Hati yang mumin istana Allah, Masok shurga jannatu'n-naim. GSliga di-puncha kain, Orang bSrtanak di-bawah sSntul; Masok shurga jannatu'n-naim, Ini-lah anak baginda Rasul. Orang bSrtanak di-bawah sSntul, ChSrana bSrisi timah; Ini-lah anak baginda Rasul, Yang b&amp;rnama Siti Fatimah. ChSrana bSrisi timah, Timah di-tSmpa si-Undang; Yang bSrnama Siti Fatimah, Dia yang pandai m&amp;ngarang. Timah di-tSmpa si-Undang, Puchok kundur asam-nya kandis; Dia yang pandai mSngarang, Budak yang tidur, jangan mSnangis! Puchok kundur asam-nya kandis, Pina-pina jalan ka-huma; Budak yang tidur jangan mSnangis, Fatimah tgngah mSngarang bunga. Pina-pina jalan ka-huma, Orang bSrgolok di-dalam padi; Fatimah tSngah mSngarang bunga, MSngisi tSngkolok baginda Ali. Orang bSrgolok di-dalam padi, Pisau pSnyadap di-hujong galah; Isi tSngkolok baginda Ali, HSndak mSngadap Rasul Allah. Pisau pSnyadap di-hujong galah, Minta sadapkan umbi akar; HSndak mSngadap Rasul Allah, HSndak m&amp;minta akan Dzu'l-fikar. Another of these lullabies runs as follows: Ratib rantau mSlawan tandang, Di-sabong orang di-kSdai China; Igau rantau tiada di-pandang, Laksana sudah tSrk&amp;na guna. BSrSmpat tidur di-pSntas, BSrlima dSngan guru-nya; Laksana dawat dSngan kSrtas, KStiga-nya kalam akan judu-nya. Junjong perak gSmala ganti, Sauh di-laboh nakhoda-nya; Jauh di-mata ingat di-hati, Anak di-kawal ayah bonda-nya. 84</page><page sequence="86">Tikar puchok tikar mSngkuang, TSmpat dudok raja MSlayu; Ikan busok jangan di-buang, Buat pSrSnchah daun kayu. Anak itek mati-nya ISmas, Di-sSmbSleh orang dSngan sikin-nya; Hilang bangsa karna mas, Hilang budi karna miskin-nya. The following Perak lullaby for royal babies is however by far the most interesting owing to its historical allusions: Bunga merah tinggi di-tambak, Tambak bSrukir taman b&amp;rawan; SSri Sultan Raja Perak, Asal Iskandar Nushirwan. Bunga merah banyak di-taman, Sunting dayang masok ka-dalam; Di-Makkah Nabi Akhir-zaman, Di-Johor Mahkota Alam. Dari Tanjong mudek ka-Bota, Singgah bSrhSnti di-BSrahmana; Tuan di-junjong jadi mahkota, MSnjunjong sipat dSngan sSmpurna. B&amp;rahmana t&amp;bing-nya tinggi, Pulau di-t&amp;ngah pasir-nya halus; Tuan laksana mas p&amp;langi, Derja di-tSntang badan akan haus. Balai bSsar bSratap kajang, Istana di-sSlat di-sabSlah kiri; fintahkan mati gSrangan abang, Ka-mana lagi m&amp;mbawa diri. Zaman raja di-BSrahmana, Gajah di-chSlong di-bawah bukit; Jikalau ada tuan bSrguna, Mohonkan tolong badan yang sakit. TStak sa-ranting buatkan golek, Hendak mSnuba sungai Buiman; fingku bSrtentang adek b&amp;radek, Laksana bunga kSmbang sa-taman. HSndak mSnuba sungai Buiman, Singgah bSrmalam di-rotan gStah; Raja ini raja bSriman, Sa-isi alam mSnjunjong titah. Singgah bSrmalam di-rotan gStah, Pagi-pagi buka puasa; Raja ini raja bSriman, Daulat-nya tSrdiri senentiasa. 85</page><page sequence="87">c CIRCUMCISION Maka budak itu-pun di-naikkan oleh mudin itu ka-atas batang pisang atau ka-atas karong. Maka sSpit-nya-pun lalu-lah sSgSra di-kSnakan oleh To' Mudin kapada dzakar-nya itu tang sudah di-pumpunkan kulit-nya itu tiada t&amp;rk&amp;na ka- pada isi-nya. Maka kSpala budak itu di-chongakkan oleh orang tua-tua, tiada di-bSri ia mSmandang-nya lagi. Hata sa-tSlah sudah yang dSmikian itu, maka To' Mudin itu-pun sSgSra-lah m&amp;ngajar mSnguchap dua kalimah shahadat. Maka budak itu-pun mSngikut-lah s£p&amp;rti pSngajar mudin itu. Maka ISpas itu mudin itu bSrkata pula: "Halalkan darah kamu dunia akhirat." Maka jawab budak itu: "Halal dunia akhirat." Maka mudin itu-pun s&amp;gSra-lah mSnampar paha budak itu tiga kali bSrturut-turut; maka lalu-lah sSgSra di-kSratkan-nya. Maka sa-tSlah sudah putus itu, maka luka-nya itu-pun baharu-lah di-tasakkan oleh To' Mudin itu dSngan ubat-nya yang bSrchampur dSngan gula puteh, kSrtas api, minyak nyiur, atau daging. Maka ubat itu-pun di-bubohkan di-atas puchok daun pisang yang sudah bSrlayur, lalu-lah di-balutkan kapada luka itu. Sa-tSlah sudah maka budak itu-pun di-angkatkan pSrlahan-lahan ka-tSmpat tikar bantal-nya, tang sudah di-sSdiakan di-buboh puchok pisang bSrlayur dan di-buboh pula abu; jikalau sa-kira-nya turun darah k£lak tiada-lah k&amp;na titek itu. Dan sSrta pula budak itu di-bSri mSmakai kain puteh lgpas panjang lima hasta dan sa-hSlai kain batek akan jadi punjut-nya supaya kSsSnangan ia tidur. Maka sa-kStika lagi ISpas b&amp;rkhatan itu hari-pun malam-lah. Maka bapa kanak-kanak itu dSngan kaum kSluarga-nya pun bSrjaga-lah mSlayan budak itu jangan tidur ISsak ka-sana ka-mari; di-pSgangkan paha-nya. Maka budak itu-pun tidur-lah bSrsandar dSngan bantal pSrlahan-lahan. Maka jikalau sa-kira-nya tiada orang jaga mSmggangkan paha budak itu, maka di-bubohkan oleh mudin sSng- kang di-tambatkan kapada paha budak itu kanan dan kiri sa-bSlah mSnyabSlah. Hata datang kSesokan hari-nya, maka mudin itu-pun mSnyuroh siapkan ayer hangat daun mSrsapat hSndak di-tanggalkan kundang budak itu. Maka lalu-lah di-bawa-nya turun ka-ayer pSrlahan-lahan sSrta di-basoh dSngan ayer s£jok. TSlah sudah di-buboh tangkal p&amp;mantan tSrap bSrpintal itu, maka budak itu-pun di- mandikan, langsong di-bawa-lah naik ka-rumah, langsong di-basoh luka itu dSngan ayer hangat itu di-pSrsuchikan di-buboh pula ubat.

Maka makan itu tiada-lah boleh bSrtambah sa-kali-kali, takut lambat baik. Maka s6bab bSralas pinggan itu dfingan daun pisang takut luka itu kSlak sopak yaani puteh.
