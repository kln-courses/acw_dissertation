<plain_text><page sequence="1">ART HISTORY OR THE HISTORY OF CULTURE: A CONTEMPORARY GERMAN PROBLEM* J. P. HODIN Professor Otto H. F6rster, editor of the Wallraf-Richartz-Jahrbuch published in Cologne, has recently written a book entitled Entfaltung und Zerfall: Ein Versuch uiber Grundformen der deutschen Kunst. The volume discussed here is the second edition, although unchanged as far as the text is concerned.' Elabo- rated from lectures delivered in 1932 at the University of Cologne, the work of Mr. F6rster arouses our interest for several reasons. Typical of a certain kind of German art literature, it does not deal with aesthetic problems in a specialist or one-sidedly analytical manner, but views art rather as the expression of a larger complex of ideas and facts. The book discloses the spiritual crisis with which the German art historian has been confronted not only by the Nazi ideology-in itself only the climax of a development of older date-but by the war, the de- struction and defeat which it brought in its train. As such, this book may give us an opportunity of studying more closely certain problems connected with its approach, such as the question of European, particularly Christian-European, culture as opposed to the concept of national culture. It leads us to think further of the question of the kultur-philosophische approach to works of art, its method and terminology, with its tendency to generalize, its polemic character, and its more or less negative attitude towards contemporary developments and its conclusions as to the future. We intend in the following lines not so much to criticize but rather to hold a conversation with the author, and by seizing on salient points in his exposition to inform the non-German scholar on recent trends in art historic thought East of the Rhine. We may hope to find also something of the link, which is so badly needed, between the German and the non-German approach to problems of art, since no genuine progress is likely either in German or in American literature on art historic or critical topics unless the one learns from the other. In other words, until a basis has been found which combines on the one hand, a world view and method based on scientific thought, and on the other hand a metaphysical and morphological approach and its terminology. In reconciling both, as many prominent scientists of today have already done, new vistas are opened up which will benefit the purely cerebral, as well as the purely empathic and emotional approach to works of art. The art historian and critic has neither to shut his eyes to contemporary philosophic thought wrestling with the facts which science has revealed, nor to the wisdom inherent in former mind conceptions on which the great arts of the past have been based. Bertrand Russell expresses the whole matter in a nutshell when he says that science is aiming at a world view which comes very near to that of the old Chinese. * The quotations in this essay, with a few exceptions, are deliberately taken from writers of Germanic extraction; 1 Otto H.

HODIN Mr. Fdrster views art as a phenomenon of symbolic significance, expressive of the basic character of a nation, its geographic and mental climate. He is op- posed to the lart pour lart formula, developed by the late nineteenth century. He understands however that even this attitude is "symbolic" of the loss which modern man has suffered in abandoning the concept of the wholeness of life which had been achieved in such an exemplary manner in the ideal of the Gottesreich both politically (in the German-Roman Empire) and spiritually. It is for this reason that Mr. Forster emphasizes the German development in art, and particularly in architecture, which found its climax in the building of the cathedral of Speyer, rather than stressing, as others have done, the Gothic or the Baroque. The Baroque is for Mr. Forster the last great manifestation of the spiritual development of this unitary aspect. We can now recognize the dilemma into which the author will be led by the limitation dictated by his major theme, i.e., Grundformen der deutschen Kunst: Entfaltung und Zerfall der Abendlandischen Gottesreiches. The main title stresses the national, the Germanic point of view, the subtitle the Christian, the Universal, the European. In trying to avoid this dilemma, the author presents the former as the unity of both. Mr. F6rster attacks his problem from three different angles. In part one, God's Castle (Die Gottesburg; Carolingian, Ottonian, Romanesque Churches): the Palace of the Spirit (Der Palast des Geistes; the Gothic cathedrals; or in terms of space, infinite space-Gothic, mastered space-Baroque, etc.); the Castle, the Palace, or Mansion House (Der Herrensitz); the Town-all represent for the author Symbols of the Universe (Symbole des Weltgebdudes). In part two, the Symbols of the Soul of the Universe (Symbole der Weltseele) are enlarged on. We meet here with the changing aspect of the representation of man: man as the object of God's action (Der Mensch als Gegenstand der Tat Gottes). The God-filled and the Knightly Man (Der gottdurchdrungene und der ritterliche Mensch). The Ensnared Man (Der verstrickte Mensch), and finally The Suppressed Man (Der verdrangte Mensch), who is modern man, of course. The Symbols of the Matter of the Universe (Symbole des Weltstoffes) are dealt with in part three. "Art, as all human endeavour, is realization in matter." Stone and Gold, Line, Light, Color, etc., are its mediums in different phases of spiritual unfolding. In a compactly constructed picture, often rendered poetically, always logically and sincerely, Mr. Fdrster covers the whole development from the times of Charlemagne until the present day including not only specific art historic facts but, and one is inclined to say mainly, spiritual, religious, racial, social, general cultural facts, focussed on Germany and the Germans, and all this not, as he points out, in a "pragmatic" way, or analytically, but "sinnbildlich," by viewing them as symbols expressive of a spiritual unity. He goes so far as to deplore the use at all of terms which are dictated by the art historic "scientific" character of the work, seeing in the elimination of such terms and their replacement by a direct primary vision of the works of art the ultimate aim of his striving. This is a basically different approach from that adopted by Professor Thomas Munro. Mr. Munro, polemizing with the romantic philosopher on art who "revels in the uniqueness and constant change of all phenomena, including works of art ... and who prefers to think of art as a process of creating and experiencing," stresses the need for clear thinking about the arts on the lines of a naturalistic, relativistic</page><page sequence="3">ART HISTORY OR HISTORY OF CULTURE 471 point of view of philosophy.2 Again we can compare Mr. Fdrster's viewpoint with the statement of Professor George Boas: "Our dislike for purple passages and fine writing has increased as the years have gone by and our love for clear thought and simple expression has increased. We have been led to believe that there is a growing interest in sentences which can be verified, whose truth can be tested by fact rather than by deep feeling. Ambiguity and vagueness seem to be getting out of fashion even in a field where they were evidences of profundity only a few years ago."3 The strange fact however remains that, although one cannot find a single mistake in the art historic statements in Mr. Boas' book, wrong conclusions have certainly been drawn from the working hypotheses in the book under review.4 Yet it is from such a book that one can derive the high degree of inspiration, for which one looks in vain from Wingless Pegasus. The tightrope dancing of rationalism above the solid ground is comparable to the playing of an instrument on one string only. It seems to some extent to be a matter of taste or temperament, but in the last analysis it is surely a question of different types of people of which the one group has purely rationalist-cerebral inclinations whereas the reactions of the other are more complex. We would like to repudiate here the supposition of positivist origin, that the ratio is a develop- ment of feeling, replacing it in a mature state of mind. The great merit of Mr. Fdrster's book lies in the fact that he interprets the works of art, architectural and otherwise, from his own experience. He presents them furthermore not as art historic examples or stylistic developments but as spiritual facts. This approach is comparable to that of Auguste Rodin in his book on the cathedrals of France. From the theoretical point of view Mr. Forster's method can be identified as an approach by empathy. "Modern aesthetics," wrote Dr. Wilhelm Worringer already in 1908,5 "which has made the decisive step from aesthetic objectivism to aesthetic subjectivism, i.e., which no longer proceeds in its research from the form of the aesthetic object but from the at- titude of the subject, culminates in a theory which is called in a general and wide term the empathy doctrine." Mr. Fdrster's method, however, can not be declared to be purely an empathic one because he does not only experience the works of art in a direct way as if they had never been seen or interpreted before, but, as we shall see later, his description and interpretation makes use of a large range of traditional German knowledge, historic, cultural, philosophic, and national. Nevertheless, Mr. F6rster proclaims his method and aim to be not "to read into" the works of art any interpretation which is not exclusively derived from the contemplation of the works themselves or anything which arises from other disciplines. He also makes it clear that he is opposed to any idea of Kunst- geschichte als Geistesgeschichte, a term coined to describe the approach of the late Professor Max Dvorak of Vienna. The final results however seem to be 2 Thomas Munro. The Arts and Their Interrelations. A Survey of the Arts and an Outline of Comparative Aesthetics. New York, 1949. 3 George Boas. Wingless Pegasus.

HODIN much the same as both Mr. Dvorak and Mr. F6rster give vital interpretations dictated by the genuine appreciation of the works they study. There is no doubt that Mr. Dvorak too departs very decidedly from the direct impact the works of art have made on him personally. The term Grundformen, "basic forms" (Mr. F6rster does not use the term Ur-formen, "primary forms"), of German art forces the critical mind to react a priori. Can it then be said that German basic forms exist in the visual arts and particularly in architecture? Notwithstanding the fact that Germany is from the cultural point of view but a part of a greater unit-rightly emphasized by the author as a most essential fact-it cannot either from the time factor or in the question of formal inventiveness be the initiator of the styles known generally as Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque. Has it not created only variants, although significant and often great ones, but nevertheless only variants of those styles and spiritual movements which are the expression of European culture? We quote here examples from the book itself: "The building types, taken over by the Germans, were formed in the countries of the Mediterranean as the final phase of Greco-Roman architecture." Or: "The Germans, at the time when their architecture and figural art were just beginning, were confronted with a form world which, far from being primitive, was indeed highly differenti- ated. It reached them in a finished state, for which they were not prepared from their Germanic past. They were as little given by nature the urge to shape in a figurative way as they were to build in stone...." What is called by Mr. F6rster "the oldest German world symbol," the "Codex Aureus" of St. Emmeram, was probably made in Reims. With regard to the Gothic conception we can read: "This new world symbol did not come into existence on German soil, but more than a lifetime before the buildings of Strassbourg and Cologne were started, it had been supremely realized in the reconstruction of the old cathedral of Chartres, which had burned down in 1194.... It was in the central counties of France ... that the spiritual powers which have formed Europe found their natural centre. In Paris the World-University grew, in the monasteries of the country other centres of philosophic endeavour; the many castles of the nobility were the homeland of the poetry and culture of the age of knighthood and there too we have to look for the starting point of the crusades which united Europe, at least in their idea, for the first time." Speaking of the Jesuit church of St. Michael in Munich the author remarks that "sometime before, the central church of that order had established an epoch in church building style, il Gesti in Rome." "II Cortegiano, the work of Count Castiglione, produced at the court of Urbino under Federigo's son and successor, sketched the new ideal which dominated Europe during the following three centuries." In connection with the Belvedere in Vienna and the Sanssouci in Potsdam, it had to be admitted that "the original of all these lay-outs is Versailles." So also, one can compare the Palatine chapel at Aachen with San Vitale in Ravenna, or the interior of the choir in Cologne with Amiens cathedral, the Elizabeth church at Marburg with other French examples, etc. In these latter instances, however, the author tries to re-interpret the essence of the varied development in Germany as something which has been deepened and spiritually ennobled through the experience of the German nation, as compared with its origin in the West (France) or in the South (Italy). It sounds</page><page sequence="5">ART HISTORY OR HISTORY OF CULTURE 473 like an echo from a statement such as: "Individualism is the root of all art; and because the Germans are without any doubt the most particular and the most self-willed of all the Peoples; so they are also-when they succeed in mir- roring the world clearly-artistically the most important of all the peoples."6 It is here that a false note creeps in, much against the will of the author himself, and not where description and interpretation are dictated by a humble love and understanding. We ask, what are the German basic forms of art? The author defines them as living phenomena, not abstract categories, which appear as the creations of the same people in a certain space of time and are essentially connected through the intention leading to their creation; so that with the classification into one or another group something essential (wesentlich) is stated about the wholeness of the work in question, about its reality as a form growing out of its native soil- Lebensgrund. This definition, we fear, does not enable the author to isolate German art from the unity of the European spiritual and stylistic development. The ambiguity of the national and supra-national outlook leads Mr. Fdrster into a controversy against the current conception and application of styles in general and induces him also not to acknowledge comparison in style and quality as the only means of art historic appreciation, i.e., of understanding and defining a work of art. He wishes to replace it by a kind of poetical participation mystique. One understands only too well what Mr. Fdrster's mystic inclinations lead him to hope for: the direct expression of the essence of a style and not the mere enumeration of its elements, a work which has already been so admirably done by Professor Alois Riegl of Vienna in his Stilfragen. But can the essence of life be given in words, we ask? How could art, one of its emanations, obey such a demand? "The stylistic description and the iconographic, theological, historic interpretations do not even when combined produce a whole," says Mr. Fdrster. All results of comparative art research give only answers to the question, "how?" How has Diirer, how has Raphael shaped the same theme? We must seek for a method which is directed towards the wholeness of the artist's Tat. In replacing the question "how" with the question "what" (What is a temple, what is a portrait of the seventeenth century, what is a castle seen in its whole complex of relationships), the question of the essence of the work of art is posed. After castigating again and again the belief in absolute "style" as the only raison d'etre of the work of art, even seen as a mere abstract principle, the nationalist spirit of distortion creeps in once more. It is said that to do real justice to any work of art we must judge it only in accordance with its own and not with some "foreign measuring rod" and this only two lines after it has been stated that the changes in artistic ideas and their representation are dictated by laws "which going beyond national frontiers have equal validity for whole groups of nations." This ambiguity between the national and the supra-national leads of necessity to the German realm of art being taken, so to speak, out of the context of the European stylistic development, whereas ideologically the wholeness of it is emphasized; it often means also that wherever a non-German beholder will find a less developed or later or cruder form of such stylistic examples, explainable certainly by tradition. by aeovranhic or climsatic conditins+ mhr cit.' 6 J.

We reject this hypothesis as untenable. The author must not, despite all this, be accused of any narrowness of outlook. There are many statements in the book, as mentioned already, which prove the contrary and we may recognize in it a product of a struggle between a nationalist ideal which has dominated intellectual life in Germany for decades and a unitary spiritual attitude, a European attitude-a fact which is probably significant of the German situation of today. The whole book is altogether not under- standable unless we do understand it from the desire to show present day German man what genuine religious, moral, aesthetic, and cultural values are, and this after the complete blackout that Nazi ideology has produced in a generation which today represents the mature population of Germany (the age group of 35-45 years). The author entangles himself thereby in contradictions, but this is pardonable because of its moral intention. It is a didactic book for the Ger- mans. The non-German is, however, informed that the old ideology, the romantic-nationalist, metaphysically conceived nationalist ideology continues. We know that a book cannot change a people. Nevertheless it might have been better perhaps to take the decisive step, to accept fullheartedly the present age, not only to see it as the age of dissolution of an old unitarian world view. When compared with the universal humanist attitude of Andr6 Malraux and his elabo- ration of a global point of view on art, the history of which is for him the history of the evolving image of man throughout the ages, the acceptance of modern art principles without hesitance,7 as established in his Psychologie de l'Art, Les Voix du Silence and Le Musge Imaginaire de la Sculpture Mondiale, it will become clear that any national point of view has today lost very much of its attraction and ground, even if it is used, as Mr. F6rster apparently uses it, only to show the greatness of past spiritual unity, and thereby to encourage the present to new great efforts. Mr. Fdrster is not pessimistic in his spiritual vision. In his indecision, however, between the national aspect of German art and the European aspect of art in Germany, he produces doubts on both sides. That his attitude does not allow a vigorous acceptance of the present era of science and of developments beyond it for his special realm of research, which is art history, as Karl Jaspers for instance has accepted it in the realm of philosophy and science,8 is probably 7 "La grande resurrection de notre temps... est garante de notre art, car aucun age touch6 A la fois par les archaiques grecs, les Egyptiens, les sculpteurs Wef, Michel-Ange, ne pourra rej6ter C6zanne. La premibre culture artistique universelle ... n'est pas un envahis- sement, mais une des conquetes supremes de l'Occident.... Si la qualit6 du monde est la matiere de toute culture, la qualht6 de l'homme en est le but. C'est elle qui la fait, non somme de connaissances, mais h6ritibre de grandeur; et notre culture artistique, qui sait qu'elle ne peut se limiter A l'affinement le plus subtil de la sensibilite, tatonne devant les figures, les chants et les pobmes qui sont l'h6ritage de la plus vieille noblesse du monde- parce qu'elle s'en d6couvre aujourd'hui la seule heritibre."

Whereas in former ages men have stressed the general and the universal and seen in unity the desirable goal, modem nationalism stresses the peculiar and parochial, the differences and the national and racial individualities. Mr. Forster in expressing his enthusiastic admiration for the Romische Reich Deutscher Nation wishes to make the universal acceptable to the traditional German nationalist feeling without loss of face. He has of necessity to emphasize the past at the expense of the present and the future. The starting point of his whole reasoning is a statement of Heinrich Wblfflin made in 1898 "that the Italian High Renaissance is a complete and free expres- sion of the Italian people. It is ... not a product of any school but grown, as it were, in the open field.... For our consciousness this fact has only been blurred, because ... a nationally conditioned fact has been taken for a general fact.... The art of the High Renaissance in Italy remains an Italian art and the ideal enhancement of reality, which took place there, has been only the enhancement of an Italian reality." Without going into the fact of what the Renaissance has meant for European culture, apart from its starting point in Italy, one wonders how the author would have fared if he had chosen another statement of W6lfflin defining an opposite principle. "The Quattrocento and the Cinquecento as stylistic terms ... define a development of seeing, which in its essence is inde- pendent of any specific way of thinking or of any special ideal of beauty.... The classical character of the Cinquecento art is based on ... formal elements. It is here a question of developments, which repeat themselves everywhere, a question of universal art forms: the quality that makes Raphael excel the older generation is the same as that which, applied to other tasks, makes Ruysdael a classic amongst the Dutch landscape painters."9 In his attempt to distinguish the specifically German element from the wider context of a universal development, in his metaphysical approach, too, this book of Mr. F6rster's continues a trend of thought which found in Oswald Spengler's Der Untergang des Abendlandes'0 its widest acceptance. Spengler could be quoted here in many instances which are discussed in Mr. F6rster's book. We will re- strict ourselves only to the definition of style as "something inaccessible to the understanding of art, the revelation of something metaphysical, a mysterious 'must,' a destiny," and to the morphological viewpoint of Goethe accepted by Spengler as the only true one, the means of which are: Nachfiihlen, Anschauen, Vergleichen, die unmittelbare innere Gewissheit, die exakte sinnliche Phantasie. Spengler's book itself, although the most outstanding, is only one among other German works voicing this mentality. We have already quoted J. Langbehn's Rembrandt als Erzieher, and there are others, all of which use a similar partly metaphysical, partly symbolico-poetic terminology although with different aims. It is unmistakably a school of thought, a German habit of thought, so to speak, and one needs only to compare the statements on art in these different works with those of Mr. F6rster, or of Hans Sedlmavr's Verlust der Mitte: Die bildernde I Heinrich W6lfflin.

HODIN Kunst des 19 und 20 Jahrhunderts als Symptom und Symbol der Zeit,"1 or Wilhelm Hausenstein's Was bedeutet die Moderne Kunst: Ein Wort der Besinnung,'2 or Wilhelm Worringer's Problematik der Gegenwartskunst,"3 or G. F. Hartlaub's Fragen an die Kunst,'4 or Martin Heidegger's Der Ursprung des Kunstwerkes,'5 to realize this. Without Oswald Spengler's morphological conception, his idea of Entfaltung und Zerfall, (derived from Goethe's study Geistes-Epochen: Nach Hermanns Neuesten Mitteilungen, 1817), as well as his mysticism, and without Leo Frobenius' Kulturkreislehre, none of the above mentioned books published after the second world war are thinkable.'6 One feels how personally Mr. Fdrster is concerned when presenting his mirror of a thousand years of great spiritual achievements to the ideologically confused German nation of today. We doubt, however, whether it is the most effective way. In accepting present day man in all his tragic greatness, as Malraux does, one can arrive at definitely more positive results. The acceptance of the principle of science and the humanism based upon it might also produce a platform from which we can admire the past without despairing of or diminishing the value of the present. Professor Werner Heisenberg, the physicist, is more up to date than Mr. Sedlmayr. Some of his statements can produce as intense a poetical sensation as those of any mystic. One need only to read his lecture delivered on November 26, 1941, at the University of Leipzig on the Unity of the Scientific Outlook on Nature to realize this. "We are witnessing a change in the external features of the world... .The struggle for its re-shaping is carried on with all our resources and absorbs all our powers.... A fundamental and lasting change, which has gradually matured in some field of intellectual activity, can also be of importance on a world scale, [sic] in the shape of our future.... It appears that the various branches of science are beginning to fuse into one great entity... ."17 "Never lose sight of the role your particular subject has within the great performance of the tragicomedy of human life," writes Professor Erwin Schr6dinger. "Keep in touch with life-not so much with practical life as with the ideal background of life, which is ever so much more important; and keep life in touch with you. If you cannot-in the long run-tell everyone what you have been doing, your doing has been worthless."'8 Or: "We have inherited from our forefathers the keen longing for unified, all-embracing knowledge....

They both seem to believe that humanism, that love and devotion, that religious sensation, that the experience of the miracle of life die with the fading out of Christian dogma."

"19 "Long years of neglect have not deleted the deep impression made in my youth by the age-old attempts to answer the most urgent questions of the human mind: the questions about the ultimate meaning of existence, about the Universe at large and our part in it, about life and death, truth and error, goodness and vice, God and eternity.... Getting old ... I feel ... the desire to summarize the results of the scientific search in which, during several decades, I have taken a small part, and that leads un- avoidably back to those eternal questions which go under the title of meta- physics."20 Has not Professor Niels Bohr used the term "irrational" to describe the new feature of the physical world discovered by Planck? And did not Albert Einstein proclaim: "The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious side of life. It is the deep feeling which is at the cradle of all true art and science. In this sense, and only in this sense, I count myself amongst the most deeply religious people."' Why, then, we ask, this perpetual distrust of science and scientists as expressed so often in Mr. F6rster's and Mr. Sedlmayr's books? Should the reader of these lines ask, what all this has to do with art history and particularly with German art history, then we can only answer: the German art historian of the type discussed above, is as much concerned with art as he is with a world-view underlying its manifestations, and that it is the scientist who is at the root of the changing world view of today, not the art historian. Mr. Fdrster's book has not produced the same sensation as Mr. Sedlmayr's book, but the fact that his critics closely connect them, stressing the more positive character of the latter, (Verlust? . . . Nein: Gewinn der Mitte), the fact that both Mr. Hartlaub and Mr. Hausenstein published remarks in their respective studies to remind us that their ideas were written down before or without the knowledge of Mr. Sedlmayr's book show only that we are dealing here with a typical aspect of post-war Germany. It will remain for the future to see how far the German art historian can move away from a terminology and a trend of thought which is more representative of the nineteenth than of the twentieth century, in what degree he can critically assimilate what foreign writers have brought forth in this field of studies. On the other hand, one would like here to implore those American art historians and aestheticians of an advanced school not to cut the wings of Pegasus too short and to derive some true inspiration from those European colleagues who still believe that without recognizing "the reality of the human soul"22 and the power of human imagination no adequate interpre- tation of art is possible. 19 Erwin Schrodinger.
