<plain_text><page sequence="1">Graven Images, Astromagical Cherubs, and Mosaic Miracles: A Fifteenth-Century Curial-Rabbinic Exchange By Eric Lawee In an excursus incorporated into his sole surviving work, a commentary on the Torah, a fifteenth-century rabbi, Aaron Aboulrabi, describes a colloquy between himself and an unnamed pope and his cardinals concerning the "cherubs that Moses was commanded to make in the holy of holies" (Exod. 25.18-20). In Aboulrabi's telling, his curialist interlocutors expressed wonderment at the two gold entities that surmounted the gold slab covering the "ark of the covenant," located in the holiest section of the ancient Israelite tabernacle. Indeed, they pro posed that these tabernacle cherubs reflected "the craft of talismans manufactured in accordance with the potencies of the constellations"; breached biblical prohi bitions on "other gods" and "graven images," especially as articulated in the Decalogue; and bore within them the potential to subvert, "in the mind of any person," the "miracles and wonders" associated with Moses. In the continuation of his vignette, Aboulrabi relates the "beginning" of a discourse he says he deliv ered "in the metropolis of Rome in the palace of the pope" in response to these startling assertions. In it he rebuts the image of Moses as an astromagical adept drawing down stellar powers and explicates the cherubs in such a way as to greatly discount their significance. In sharp counterpoint to the curialist presentation, Aboulrabi sets forth a philosophically oriented disquisition on the cherubs that puts them at a far remove both from astral theurgy and biblical proscriptions on idolatrous representation. Aboulrabi's story raises many questions and invites more than a little skepti cism: Did a wandering rabbi passing through Rome really meet with a pope and his cardinals? If so, where and under what circumstances? Who might the pope in question have been? In what language was the curial exchange conducted? And so forth. Seen in terms of such questions, the main scholarly tasks arising from Aboulrabi's narration seem clear and fairly circumscribed: analysis of the ac count's main religious-intellectual and literary lineaments and possible wider his This study grew out of a larger project that benefited from material support afforded by the Maurice Amado Research Fund in Sephardic Studies of the Center for Jewish Studies, University of California, Los Angeles, and from the Faculty of Arts at York University in Toronto. It was written during my year as a visiting fellow at the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies. A preliminary version benefited from the comments of participants in one of the institute's interdisciplinary seminars. My colleague Tom Cohen was especially generous in his efforts to improve many of the paper's formulations. Daniel J. Lasker helpfully commented on the paper's second section and enhanced the Appendix. Specific points benefited from the expertise of Joseph Goering, Moshe Idel, Marty Lockshin, Bernard Septimus, and Joseph Shatzmiller. The observations of two anonymous reviewers led to improvements in the paper's overall structure and focus.

Seen from this vantage point, Aboulrabi's autobiographical digression points to com plex and influential themes in medieval thought and evokes important trends in Christian-Jewish dialogue and disputation on the threshold of early-modern times. The following essay investigates the many-sided complexity of Aboulrabi's ex egetical vignette while introducing its well-nigh wholly forgotten author to the world of medieval scholarship.2 It begins with a brief sketch of Aboulrabi's life, literary activity, and spiritual complexion as it emerges from his sole surviving work.3 It then tries to recapture some of the long and involved history of Christian and Jewish reflection on the cherubs, paying special attention to the recurrent role played by these sacred sculptures in intra- and interreligious polemic. This con 1 For this formulation, see Gabrielle M.

Never abundant, Aboulrabi scholar ship experienced its heyday, such as it was, in the nineteenth-century's closing decades, which saw, among other things, what remains the fullest study of Aboulrabi to date, an article by Joseph Perles ("Ahron ben Gerson Aboulrabi," Revue des ?tudes juives 21 [1890], 246-69) that, however, mostly cites texts. No sustained accounts have since been forthcoming. Even passing mentions of Aboulrabi are scant. One notes an article by Kaufmann Kohler in The Jewish Encyclopedia (12 vols. [New York, 1901-6], 1:11), where the evident sympathy for Aboulrabi may be presumed to reflect Kohler's vision of him as a prototype for his own reformist religious tendencies, and a mostly unelaborated description of Aboulrabi as "perhaps the most interesting figure in Sicilian Jewish intellectual life in the Middle Ages" by Cecil Roth ("Jewish Intellectual Life in Medieval Sicily," Jewish Quarterly Review 47 [1956 57], 326-27; Roth also mentioned Aboulrabi fleetingly in The History of the Jews in Italy [Philadel phia, 1946], pp. 209 and 242). One also stumbles upon references to Aboulrabi in more recent studies on such topics as premodern Jewish approaches to scriptural authorship (Abraham Joshua Heschel, Tor ah min ha-shamayim be- 'aspaqlariyah shel ha-dorot, 2 vols. [London, 1962-65], 2:209; Menahem M. Kasher, "Quntres seder ketivat ha-torah," in Torah shelemah, 43 vols.

As the volume's printed foliation is noncontinuous, at times illegible, and periodically inconsistent, references herein after to Aboulrabi's commentary are by biblical lemma wherever possible and in addition by folio, assuming continuous foliation. Aboulrabi's glosses on Genesis and the beginning of Exodus (through Exod. 12.15) appear in a late manuscript (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Mich. 211/5, fols. 129-73 [film no. 20528 at the Institute for Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts in Jerusalem]) copied from the printed edition; see Catalogue of the Hebrew Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library: Supplement of Addenda and Corrigenda to Vol. 1 (A.

After investigating the conceptual and discursive components of the speech ascribed to the curialists by Aboulrabi and the arguments and literary overlay of his own more involved rejoinder, the essay takes up the question of historicity before exploring the seemingly eccentric talismanic conception of the cherubs that stands as the center of discussion. This conception becomes more comprehensible when situated in two larger frameworks. The first is an ascendant astromagical trend, building on earlier ancient and medieval discussions, in late-medieval Chris tian and Jewish theology and biblical scholarship, and the other is Renaissance inflected magical approaches to Moses and religious architecture in fifteenth century Italy. The concluding section seeks to place Aboulrabi's account in the longer trajectory of Christian-Jewish scholarly interaction in general and devel opments in Italy in particular during that fleeting historical moment when "the Middle Ages and the Renaissance were yet indistinct."4 An appendix supplies the relevant text in English translation.5 Aaron ben Gershon Aboulrabi was born in Catania, Sicily, into a scholarly family living amidst a Jewish community with little to show for itself by way of first-rate Hebrew scholarship.6 His precise years are unknown, but he refers on two occa sions to exchanges with "the sage, the prince Moses Hefetz," invoking the blessing for the dead for this figure, known in Latin sources as Moses Bonavoglia. Since this royal physician, who also served as Jewish Sicily's "chief judge" (Dienchelele [Hebrew dayyan kelali]) for several decades, was no longer alive in 1446, that year emerges as the terminus a quo for Aboulrabi's only extant work, at least in the version that has come down to US.7 A terminus ad quem for the work is much 4 Frank Talmage, "Keep Your Sons from Scripture: The Bible in Medieval Jewish Scholarship and Spirituality," in Understanding Scripture: Explorations of Jewish and Christian Traditions of Inter pretation, ed.

Norman Roth's recent assertion that Aboulrabi "very probably was born and educated in Aragon" (Medieval Jewish Civilization: An Encyclopedia, ed. Norman Roth [New York, 2003], p. 610) lacks substantiation, albeit there is clear evidence for a Spanish branch of the Aboulrabi family, and perhaps for its original Spanish origins; see, e.g., the documents referenced in the indices s.v.

Leaving aside tenuous arguments from silence (e.g., Aboulrabi fails to refer to the 1453 fall of Constantinople although he traveled extensively in the eastern Mediterranean), the best one can do is to correlate Aboulrabi's life span with that of his father-in-law, Moses ibn Gabbai. An Aragonese rabbi who fled Spain for North Africa after anti-Jewish riots in Spain in 1391, by which time he was already a rabbinic figure of note, ibn Gabbai passed away in 1443. As Aboulrabi married one of ibn Gabbai's daughters, it seems reasonable to assume that he could not have lived too long past the 1470s, even granting ibn Gabbai a second marriage and a daughter born to him from it later in life.8 At some point Aboulrabi set out on his lifelong career as a scholar-wanderer. Whether his departure occurred before or after the mid-1450s, which saw mes sianic expectations grip Sicily's Jewish communities, and Catania's especially, re mains unclear.9 That his surviving work was composed a considerable time after his departure from the island of his birth is suggested by his self-characterization in its introduction as one "hurled from pillar to post" and his references to stays in Treviso in northern Italy, in Turkey, in a number of more easterly centers (Egypt, Damascus, Jerusalem), and as far north as Kaffa in the Crimea.10 These travels pose to anybody seeking to understand Aboulrabi the twofold challenge of delin eating their impact on his state of mind and of understanding his teachings in light of the percolation of ideas in a late-medieval Jewish world where itinerancy was common and its intellectual impact consequential.1" Though his literary impulse may have found some expression prior to his de parture from Sicily, Aboulrabi's travels evidently nourished his yen to write. His surviving tract refers to three tomes of, it would seem, a philosophic-theological cast and another study devoted to grammar, to his mind the pivot (as his extant [Palermo, 1884-95], 1:464), Hacker's date should be moved back slightly, to 1446. For Bonavoglia's life and activities, see Salvatore Fodale, "Mose Bonavoglia e il contestato iudicatus generalis sugli ebrei siciliani," in Gli ebrei in Sicilia dal tardoantico al medioevo, ed. Nicol? Bucaria (Palermo, 1998), pp. 99-109; and Bresc, Arabes de langue, pp. 309-10. 8 Ibn Gabbai completed his main work of biblical scholarship, "Eved shelomo (found in Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Hunt. Donat. 25, fols. lr-253v), in 1422. For his date of death, see Israel M. Ta-Shma's entry in Encyclopaedia Judaica, 16 vols. (Jerusalem, 1972), 7:233. That Aboulrabi cites his father-in-law without a blessing for the dead might suggest an earlier date for his own work, but such an argument from silence conflicts with the terminus a quo established above. 9 Nadia Zeldes, "Ma'aseh mufla' be-sisiliyah: hosafot u-verurim le-'inyan 'ha-tenu'ah ha-meshihit be-sisiliyah,' " Zion 58 (1993), 347-58.

Aboulrabi, who did not suffer from modesty, observes that the "thirst" of one wishing to fathom the true purport of these passages would indubitably be "quenched" upon perusal of his work.13 While traveling, Aboulrabi found occasion to engage in intra- and interreligious disputation. In Jerusalem he upbraided a Karaite (that is, a Jew who denied the authenticity of rabbinic interpretations of Scripture accepted as authoritative by Rabbanite Jews like Aboulrabi) for a misguided (i.e., nonrabbinic) construal of a piece of Sabbath legislation.14 A wrangle with a Christian "cleric from among the gentile scholars" centered on a midrash on the "suffering servant poems" of Isaiah 52-53, which, on the understanding of Aboulrabi's rival, lent itself to a Chris tological interpretation.'5 Aboulrabi's accounts of these tussles suggest an individ ual energized by religious debate and self-assured enough to take on all comers, Western Christendom's leading clerics included. Aboulrabi's exegetical tome bears marks of its author's combative mettle throughout. Its introduction announces that a main focus will be interpretations of the Jewish Middle Ages' leading scriptural exegete, Solomon ben Isaac, an eleventh-century northern French savant customarily called by his rabbinic acro nym "Rashi." Aboulrabi explains that this focus arises from Rashi's heavy reliance on "the eminent oaks of old," the rabbinic sages of antiquity-a reliance that evoked Aboulrabi's ambivalence to say the least.16 Though by no means the whole story, rabbinic dicta as relayed by Rashi often receive exceptionally rough handling in Aboulrabi's pages. Indeed, these pages are nearly unique in medieval rabbinic literature in their harsh denunciation of what Aboulrabi deemed exegetically wob bly or theologically unsound midrashic interpretations, including some of the legal ones that formed the foundation for medieval Jewish life.17 12 Perles, "Ahron ben Gerson Aboulrabi," p. 251 n. 1, supplies some references to the lost writings. 13 Perushim le-rashi ad Gen. 1.27 (fol. 16r). Other references to this work occur in the glosses ad Gen. 49.10 (fol. 59r) and Deut. 13.7 (fol. 160v). 14 Ibid, ad Deut. 25.4 (fol. 166r). 15 Ibid, ad Gen. 1.27 (fol. 16r). For more on this exchange, see below, p. 783. The biblical text in question was a long-standing crux of Christian-Jewish debate (see The Fifty-Third Chapter of Isaiah according to the Jewish Interpreters, trans. S. R. Driver and A. Neubauer, 2 vols. [Oxford, 1876-77; repr. New York, 1969]), while Christological interpretation of rabbinic dicta was an innovative tool of the high- and late-medieval Christian mission to the Jews (for discussion and bibliography, see Jeremy Cohen, Living Letters of the Law: Ideas of the Jew in Medieval Christianity [Berkeley, Calif., 1999], pp. 317-63). The particular rabbinic interpretation invoked by the priest was popular among Christian disputants since it posited a figure greater than Abraham, Moses, and the ministering angels, thereby ostensibly providing an authoritative rabbinic allusion to Jesus. Somewhat unusually among Jewish apologists, Aboulrabi accepted the identification of the suffering servant with the Messiah rather than suggesting a different referent. (Corporate Israel was a favorite choice for Jews expounding the text in polemical settings.) 16 Perushim le-rashi, fol. 13r. 17 This side of Aboulrabi's tome proved attractive to nineteenth-century scholars arguing Judaism's need to adapt to the modern world, who eagerly sought premodern exemplars of religious diversity</page><page sequence="6">A Curial-Rabbinic Exchange 759 Alongside crisp and eclectic erudition, Aboulrabi's extant work offers glimpses of a wry, stormy, brooding scholar who experienced more than an occasional bout of religious despair. Evidence of spiritual inquietude bubbles to the surface when he glosses Rashi's comment on the divine blessing accorded to Ishmael, a testi monium in which Muslim polemicists had found allusion to Muhammad."8 Ra shi's vision, grounded in the polysemic character of a key term, was of the quick eclipse of Ishmael's "chieftains (nesi im)" as if "clouds (nesi'im)" ("as clouds they will be consumed").19 To Rashi's reading Aboulrabi counterposes the stark me dieval reality of Ishmael's latter-day offshoots, Islam's potentates, enjoying on going dominion while "it is we who are 'consumed in his anger and by his wrath are hurried away' (cf. Ps. 90.7) in consequence of our many sins, and they are established in God's blessing and are given leave by him to lord over us. "20 More defiant in tone is Aboulrabi's gloss on the Mosaic promise that those who have lapsed into idolatry while in exile will yet "find" God should they seek the divine with "all your heart and all your soul" (Deut. 4.29): Woe to the ear that hears [this]. Behold, we have sought him though in our hands there is no idolatry but rather anguish and sufferings all our days simply to hold fast to our faith, and he is as a deaf one who hears not and a dumb one who opens not his mouth (cf. Ps. 38.14). Nor can one allege [our failure to seek God] "with all [our] heart and soul" (cf. Deut. 4.29) since, in light of the many evil calamities we suffer, it is indisputable that we are seeking with our heart and our soul. Indeed, we have not forborne to elevate and exalt his holy Torah to the point of "our being slain all day long" (Ps. 44.23). With great bitterness of spirit, an aching heart, and streaming tears have I written these [words] here.21 Grammatical exegesis gives way to a cri de coeur. When Aaron Aboulrabi took up questions surrounding the tabernacle cherubs, he joined a long conversation concerning these images stretching back to antiquity. At its center stood biblical sculptures whose function and signification had per plexed and stimulated Jews and Christians over the ages and whose form, at once elusive and strikingly characterized by outstretched wings, proved an inspiration to medieval thinkers and iconographers alike. It is necessary to evoke some high and dissent. Thus, Aboulrabi's modern rediscoverer, Joshua Heschel Schorr, a leading "Jewish Enlight enment" figure, stressed Aboulrabi's independent and occasionally insubordinate stance toward mid rash and eulogized him as "one of those rare individuals" whose love of justice begets a refusal to "cover up transgression among the ancients." In particular, he highlighted Aboulrabi's willingness to "express his teaching publicly . . . even when it contradicted the teaching transmitted from our rabbinic sages." See "R.

To biblical interpreters in Greco-Roman antiquity like Josephus, the cherubs of the Hebrew Bible could be a matter of considerable puzzlement-be it the cherubs assigned to guard the Garden of Eden following the primeval sin (Gen. 3.24); the ones glimpsed by Ezekiel upholding the divine throne in that prophet's mysterious theophany (Ezek. 10); the beings mentioned in scriptural descriptions of God as "the One enthroned atop the cherubs" (1 Sam. 4.4, 2 Sam. 6.2, 2 Kings 19.15, etc.); or the "two cherubs of gold" that Moses was instructed to attach to the tabernacle ark cover from between which God promised to impart to him "all that I will command you concerning the Israelite people" (Exod. 25.17-22 and 37.7_9).22 Describing these cultic cherubs (and, elsewhere in his writings, their counterparts in Solomon's Jerusalem temple [1 Kings 6.23-29, 2 Chron. 3.10 13 and 5.7-8]), Josephus stressed that the entities in question possessed forms "unlike any that human eyes have seen. "23 In so doing, he may have wished to reconcile the cherubs with the Decalogue's interdiction on representation. As wholly novel beings, the cherubs would be exempt from the ban on depiction of things "in the heavens above, or on the earth below, or in the waters under the earth" (Exod. 20.4).24 As on the literal level they could confound, the cherubs could on other planes inspire. Working out of the Jewish Hellenistic tradition and interpreting allegor ically as was his wont, Philo cast the winged tabernacle sculptures as, in one "physical allegory," representative of the outermost sphere of the fixed stars and inner sphere through which the planets traveled and, in another, as equating to the two hemispheres. In a "higher allegory" that proved resonant (and which Philo ascribed to inspiration), the cherubs were identified with the primary divine pow ers, "goodness and sovereignty.

Citing a tradition transmitted by a "He brew doctor," and apparently reflecting a long-standing Jewish idea of the exis tence of two supreme intermediary beings, Origen found the cherubs significative of Christ and the Holy Spirit.26 This understanding ramified in early-medieval times, with the cherubs assuming a place in Marian readings of the tabernacle in the Greek East and in the Christological and ecclesiological interpretations of the tabernacle that abounded in the Latin West. In the latter the cherubs typically served as types of the two testaments that, in Isidore of Seville's understanding, reflected the "multitudinous wisdom" that overshadowed the propitiatorium ("mercy seat," understood as "the sacraments of Christ") or, in Gregory the Great's supersessionist gloss, proclaimed as one the message of Jesus's incarnation, death, and resurrection.27 The rabbis of classical Judaism's great talmudic and midrashic corpora also discovered multitudinous meanings in cherubs.28 On the basis of an etymologically fanciful midrash that likened a cherub's form to "a youth,"29 both the tabernacle cherubs and their temple successors were said to signify God's relationship with the Jewish people, even as some rabbis indicated their awareness that such notions could invite pagan disdain.30 A third-century homily brings into relief a growing the Text in Philo and Origen," in Interpretation and Allegory: Antiquity to the Modern Period, ed.

And . . . when necessary they readily come to the point of death to avoid defiling their conception of the God of the universe by any act of this kind contrary to his law" (cited in Jaroslav Pelikan, Imago Dei: The Byzantine Apologia for Icons, Bollingen Series 36 [Princeton, N.J., 1990], pp. 1-2). Origen's approach was adumbrated in some measure by Irenaeus, who had equated the powers of the Word and Wisdom with Christ and the Holy Spirit and, in turn, with the angelic "Cherubim and Seraphim" that "glorify God with unceasing voices." See Stroumsa, "Le couple," pp. 46-47; and, with reference to the passage's relationship to Origen, Iain M.

It envi sions Jews on pilgrimage in Jerusalem being shown the temple cherubs, their "bod ies intertwined with one another," and being told: "Look! You are beloved before God as the love between man and woman."'31 Such celebratory midrashim on the cherubs notwithstanding,32 rabbinic literature copiously elaborated scriptural in junctions against visual representation. While different analyses turned in vary ingly stringent holdings,33 all yielded prohibitions on many cultic and some non ritualistic images-plastic portrayals of the divine, to be sure, but depictions of the human figure as well.34 During the sixth- and seventh-century transition from rabbinic to medieval Ju daism, Byzantine Christians witnessed the rise of a cult of images and, in turn, justifications for representational expressions of devotion in which the cherubs were enlisted as legitimating precedents. Responding to the assertion that those who set up what is "revered and worshipped in the form of paintings and carving" in Christian "sanctuaries" transgressed Old Testament proscriptions, Hypatius of Ephesus, a close theological adviser to Justinian, during whose reign images as sumed a central role in Byzantine life,35 observed that God did not forswear the ways of material representation in all things sacred. Consider Moses, who had issued the proscriptions in question at divine behest but who also included in the tabernacle "golden images of the cherubs in beaten work. "36 Hypatius availed himself of the time-honored doctrine of "accommodation" to explain the enigma. In this view, God made prudential concessions to imperfect humanity so that the divine message should be absorbed and heeded. The cherubs epitomized this divine 31 Ibid., fol. 54a. See also a talmudic resolution to apparently conflicting biblical data concerning the cherubs' disposition (did they face each other or not?): if "Israel obeyed the will of the Omni present," the cherubs faced each other; if not, they turned away from each other (bBava Batra, fol. 99a). 32 For samples, see the sources assembled in Kasher, Tor ah shelemah (above, n. 2), 20:35-40. 33 Mekhilta de-rabbi Ishmael ad Exod. 20.4 (trans.

As, in bygone days, the cherubs brought religious truth within the ken of Israelites whose imaginations faltered before the idea of divine incor poreality, so, now, images did the same for unsophisticated Christians seeking signposts of salvation.37 Less than a century later, Gregory the Great formulated the version of this teaching that would reverberate in Western Christendom for a millennium: "what writing (scriptura) gives those who read it, the picture provides for the unlearned who see it."31 In the centuries after Hypatius, some Greek-speaking Christian apologists in voked the cherubs to refute Jewish (and, over time, Muslim) charges of idolatry. Leontius, an early-seventh-century bishop in Cyprus, composed the first in a series of adversus Judaeos texts in which this charge became a major point of conten tion.39 Reproaching Jews who accused Christians of gross error "on account of images," Leontius insisted that the critics might as well condemn God for ordain ing the cherubs.40 Anticipating the rejoinder that the cherubs constituted a divinely sanctioned exception to an otherwise inviolable wider prohibition, Leontius sum moned Solomon's inclusion of cherubs in the Jerusalem temple on his own initia tive, arguing that, as in the case of this ancient Solomonic prototype, so Christian sacred portraiture was permitted when created with proper religious intent. At any rate, icons were not gods but reminders of Christ and his saints as well as adornments in the churches. I Greek-speaking Christians would, in the face of Jewish accusations of idolatry, reprise such arguments for centuries, invoking the cherubs as their prime example.42 Holding forth in Arabic along similar lines was the ninth-century Melkite bishop of Harran, Theodore Abu Qurrah. Though the disaffection from icons of his Christian community reflected the fast-expanding, relatively aniconic dar al isldm, Abiu Qurrah suggested in his Treatise on the Veneration of the Holy Icons that Jewish denunciations also informed the unjustified misgivings of his fellow 37 Alexander, "Hypatius," p. 181.

He said to him [Moses]: 'Make two hammered cherubs...."' Hearkening to ideas of his fellow Palestinian monk of a generation earlier, John of Damascus, Abfu Qurrah further explained the surfeit of Old Testament prohibitions on images as a function of audience: the historical contingency of ancient Israel's inordinate proclivity to "run wild in wor shipping idols" impelled a corresponding act of divine governance (tadbir) ac cording to which otherwise desirable images were inordinately restricted.44 If, ac cording to Hypatius, God had compromised by allowing images like the cherubs, according to Abui Qurrah, the divine compromise lay in the opposite direction: the inordinate number of restrictions on otherwise desirable sacred images. Like Leontius, Abtu Qurrah conjured sacred artifacts from the distant Jewish past in order to counter Jewish criticism of Christian sacred artifacts in the present.45 By so doing, he hoped to steel the resolve of coreligionists whose experience of Jewish and Muslim scorn fostered a preference for mainly imageless worship. Though they barely resonated in the Christian climes inhabited by Abiu Qurrah, the eighth- and ninth-century Byzantine iconoclasm controversies generated im passioned battles over religious images in which the cherubs played a major role. John of Damascus instanced them and other Old Testament artifacts, like the copper snake fashioned by Moses to heal the Israelites of serpent bites in the wilderness (Num. 21.4-9), in tomes arguing image worship's nonidolatrous char acter. Gregory II did the same in letters sent to the first iconoclastic emperor, Leo III. The cherubs again served as examples of religiously salutary products of human hands in letters sent by Hadrian I to Constantine VI and Irene just prior to the Second Council of Nicaea (787). At Nicaea, where Byzantine iconoclasm's first wave was suppressed, objections to icons and images grounded in Old Tes tament verses were met by counterassertions of their spiritual merit rooted in appeals to the tabernacle and its cherubs.46 At the same time, the primary expositor 43 See Sidney H.

While some, like Hugh of Speroni in the twelfth century, asked his coreligionists who had ever taught them "to draw pictures, to set up crosses, to fabricate, worship, adore, and kiss idols,"49 others avidly extracted meaning from the tabernacle cher ubs.

On one level, he taught, the cherubs imparted to ancient Israelites an awareness of the existence of spiritual substances in the higher world, that is, of angels. Seen thus, their duality betokened "the multitude of heavenly spirits" while forestalling their becoming objects of worship.52 On another level, the cherubs pointed forward Christologically. In surmounting the mercy seat, a long-standing type of Christ, as if carrying it, they signified the angels' adoration of Christ. Here, then, was an epitome of Thomas's approach to Old Testament cultic instruments: a blend of ad litteram appreciation of the rational purposive ness of ancient Israelite ritual precepts pro tempore illo with disclosure of their symbolic fulfillment in the lex evangelica that rendered those precepts obsolete.53 Jewish scholars in the West also sought to penetrate the significance of the tabernacle cherubs and their cognates. While depicting the monitory cherubs sta tioned east of the garden after the first human couple's expulsion from Eden as "angels of destruction," Rashi reprised the rabbinic view that the tabernacle cher ubs possessed "the form of a child's face."'54 The lexicographically oriented An dalusian exegete Abraham ibn Ezra felt constrained to note the etymological flim siness of this view while upholding its possible correctness on other grounds.55 From Christian Spain, Moses ben Nahman spoke allusively of the tabernacle cher ubs' relationship to other biblical cherubs, including those of Ezekiel's theophany,56 surability with that of "alii doctores" according to whom the cherubs bore the "similitude of youths." His knowledge of this rabbinic perspective is presumably indebted to Rashi (as below, n. 54), though the plural "doctors" suggests awareness of a larger number of authorities, presumably encompassing the classical rabbinic sages. For Nicholas's reliance on Rashi, see Herman Hailperin, Rashi and the Christian Scholars (Pittsburgh, 1963), pp. 137-246 (for "Hebraei dicunt," in distinction to places where he specifies "Rabbi Solomon" as his source, see p. 291 n. 76). 52 Summa theologiae la2ae, q. 102, a. 4. The unmentioned source of this view is Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed 3.45 (trans. Shlomo Pines, 2 vols. [Chicago, 1963], 2:577; hereafter Pines). In the Guide, however, the instruction to include two angels is presented in more explicitly elitist terms ("that the belief of the multitude in the existence of angels be consolidated"). (For Maimonides' incorporation of notions of divine accommodation "prominently into his entire oeuvre," see Benin, Footprints of God, pp. 147-65.) Maimonides also provided Thomas with the idea that fabrication of a lone cherub might have brought about error ("it might have been thought that this was the image of the deity who was to be worshipped ... or that there was only one individual angel, a belief that would have led to a certain dualism [i.e., the ancient Israelites might have deified God and the lone cherub]. As, however, two cherubim were made, . . . measures were taken against the error that they are the deity" [Guide 3.45; Pines, 2:577]).

Like some of their Greek speaking predecessors, Latin controversialists summoned the cherubs as warrants for the cult of images and icons. A mid-twelfth-century Latin translation of the turn-of-the-eighth-century Byzantine anti-Jewish tract Dialogue of Papiscus and Philo illustrates the shift from East to West. When its fictional Jew assails Chris tians for "adoring wood" in the form of crosses and icons contrary to divine decree, his Christian counterpart retorts that Jews venerate the book of the law made of "unclean skins" and would rightly do the same to the lost tablets of the law and gold cherubs fashioned by Moses were these to be rediscovered.58 An exchange over the subject of images in the immensely popular and influential Disputation of a Jew and a Christian by the abbot of Westminster Gilbert Crispin59 is equally heated.

Solomon's inclusion of cherubs and other representations in the Jerusalem temple clinches the Christian's case that the law disallows only idolatrous images whereas "for God we make pictures, for God we make carvings, for God we make sculptures."6 A few decades later, in The Ring, or the Dialogue between a Christian and a Jew, Rupert of Deutz's Christian again answered Jewish charges regarding images by invoking the cherubs and the copper snake.62 Such arguments did not go unchecked in the West where, beginning in the later twelfth century, Hebrew anti-Christian literature flourished. In Wars of the Lord of the Spanish-born Jacob ben Reuben, composed around 1170,63 the issue of religious images comes to the fore when the Christian "Denier" highlights the seemingly flagrant discrepancy between the Decalogue's interdicts on fabrication of "other gods" and graven images (not to speak of their worship) and the sub sequent divine command to Moses to raise a snake on a pole so that those afflicted by serpent bites could gaze on it and live (Num. 21.9).64 As it was inadmissible that the divine will with regard to images had simply changed, the Christian insists that the latter episode must harbor "a great and deep profundity"-this being its intimation that Jesus, who, in crucifixion, reassembled a snake on a pole, cured Original Sin's lethal bite.65 The Jew parries that it is only the Christian's errant the Law, p. 182) is that "Gilbert took pains to package his work of Adversus ludaeos polemic more realistically than did many of his predecessors."

Gerlinde Nie meyer, MGH QQ zur Geistesgesch. 4 (Weimar, 1963), pp. 79-82. Cherubs, however, do not crop up in the debate. Writing in the same period in his Tractatus sive dialogus contra Judaeos, Walter of Ch?tillon invoked the copper serpent rather than cherubs as part of his refutation of the Jewish charge that Christian objects of worship entail idolatry (PL 209:444).

Images put in the service of beautification of an artifact or building were permitted, as occurred in Solomon's temple or, indeed, in the case of "Moses our master himself, who fashioned two gold cherubs when constructing the tabernacle."66 Despite such shows of bravado, several otherwise aggressive northern European Jewish polemicists evince more than a little difficulty and discomfort as they un dertake to distinguish valid Jewish representations from perfidious Christian ones. In his Book of Joseph the Zealous, the mid-thirteenth-century Joseph ben Nathan Official first recurred to his father's view that the cherubs, having only faces and wings, did not imitate any actually existing thing, then added an argument from their setting: since, standing in the tabernacle, the cherubs were occluded from human view (with the exception of "the high priest once a year"), they did not infringe the Decalogue's prohibition on images made "for yourself" -that is, in "a place that you can see." Aware of Solomon's sculptured lions, however, Joseph also urged, like many a Christian before him, the argument from intention: like the lions, the cherubs were not manufactured with a view to their being wor shiped.67 A later anonymous Jewish controversialist, perhaps sensing the tenu ousness of such tactics, invoked a rabbinic legal concept to forestall anticipated Christian appropriation of the divinely ordained copper snake: "the mouth which prohibited [images generally, like those used by Christians] is the same mouth that permitted [this particular image]."68 In the case of the cherubs, this approach was even said to have a scriptural basis: "you shall not make for yourself a sculptured image" means that one is not to fabricate cultic implements "on your own au thority" but "on my authority you may." With the boundaries between licit and illicit images set down, if not illumined, by the inscrutable divine will ("one should not scrutinize the commandments of the Creator.... [W]hat He prohibited is prohibited and what He permitted is permitted" ),69 this bellicose polemicist felt free to castigate Christians for bestowing "divine honors upon the idols in their houses of abomination."70 A startling interpretation of the cherubs at the turn of the fifteenth century suggests ongoing Jewish unease over the "forms and images found in the children 66 Ibid., pp. 56-59. 67 Sefer yosef ha-meqanne, ed.

The Bohemian rabbi Yom Tov Lipmann Muhlhausen wrote his Book of Polemic mainly against Christianity in the period of the reform movement associated with Jan Hus, who, along with earlier Czech reformers, condemned image veneration. In it Miihlhausen argued that the message of the cherubs stand ing above the ark and the prohibitions inscribed on the tablets housed within the ark were wholly coordinate but directed at distinct audiences. The tablets com municated proscriptions on illicit representation to the literate while the cherubs announced visually to the unlearned populace: "Look! This is what I have in structed not be made." On the basis of this perhaps partially tongue-in-cheek interpretation (later to be reprised with full seriousness by John Calvin), Muhl hausen condemned the gross misapprehension of the cherubs upon which he be lieved the "stupid" Christian "policy" of making sacred images was based.71 As a former Jew, Miihlhausen's contemporary Pablo de Santa Maria, arch bishop of Burgos from 1415, was especially sensitive to Jewish denunciations of Christian devotional practices. In a vitriolic work penned against his former co religionists, Pablo had his Christian spokesperson refute the claim of a Jewish interlocutor that the cherubs lacked human form by appealing to Jewish sources, then had the Christian respond to the further claim that image worship was tan tamount to idolatry by invoking the cherubs and the various figures included in Solomon's temple. Adding theological ballast to his scriptural examples, the Chris tian adduced the time-honored distinction between the dulia offered to images and the latria reserved for God alone.72 Needless to say, the Christian's arguments carried the day. Having arrived at reflections on the cherubs penned by a fifteenth-century Ar agonese convert to Christianity, the circle begins to close, for not long after Pablo de Santa Maria composed his fictional debate between a Christian and a Jew over the cherubs, Aaron Aboulrabi, born in Aragonese Sicily around the time of Pablo's 71 Sefer ha-nissahon, repr. of the Theodor Hackspan edition (Altdorf-Nerenberg, 1644), with cor rections by Johann Christoph Wagenseil, introduction by Frank Talmage (Jerusalem, 1984), p. 44. Calvin writes in his Institutes of the Christian Religion 1.11 (trans. Henry Beveridge, 2 vols. [London, 1949], 1:92-93): "it is therefore mere infatuation to attempt to defend images of God and the saints by the example of the Cherubim. For what, pray, did these figures mean, if not that images are unfit to represent the mysteries of God, since they were so formed as to cover the mercy-seat with their wings, thereby concealing the view of God, not only from the eye, but from every human sense, and curbing presumption?"

With a conspectus of Christian and Jewish teachings on these cherubs in hand, we are ready to assess the particulars of Aboulrabi's report. Aboulrabi's narration of his curial audience appears without forewarning amidst an explication of the instructions for the tabernacle as set out in Exodus 25. After deriding, as in the nature of "a thick cloud," the exegesis upon which some pinned a scriptural mandate for the existence of four rather than two tabernacle cherubs, Aboulrabi disarmingly detours from his running commentary to relay a query put to him "when I was in the metropolis of Rome in the palace of the pope, with the cardinals surrounding him." Aboulrabi mentions the pope only obliquely, as pro prietor of his "palace (heikbal)" and center of the curial circle. He imparts no further information regarding the language in which his audience unfolded, its number of participants, or its public or private character. Rather, following his brief bit of autobiographical staging, he offers a purported transcript of his curial interlocutors' address: They said: We are most amazed and astonished about the matter of the cherubs that Moses was commanded to make in the holy of holies in a manner that the potency of the voice and speech concerning all that he [Moses] wished to know would come forth from them. This is tantamount to the craft of talismans manufactured in accordance with the potencies of the constellations and the wisdom of aspects [i.e., the angular relationships between planets-conjunction, opposition, and so forth].73 There is no greater [violation of the prohibition against] "other gods" [Exod. 20.3] than this. He [God] had already enjoined as a root of the Decalogue at its beginning: "You shall have no other gods besides me. You shall not make for yourself a sculptured image, or any likeness, and so forth" [Exod. 20.3-4]. It [also] states: "You shall not make molten gods for yourself" [Exod. 34.17]. Such [prohibitions] are many, and there is no greater [ex ample ofl molten gods than the cherubs. It would [therefore] arise in the mind of any person that all of the miracles and wonders that Moses would perform [literally, "ac tualize"] were by means of the potency of the cherubs, as it states: "[When Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with him] he would hear the voice addressing him from above the cover that was on top of the ark of the pact between the two cherubs, and so forth" [Num. 7.89]. Therefore we have queried you whether there is an answer to our question. The curialists' "question"-which actually takes the form of a litany of stark declarations-brims with surprising turns. Foremost among these is the initial claim that the cherubs smack of the talismanic. Not far behind is the proposal that they violate scriptural interdicts on idolatrous representation. Implicit in this linkage is an understanding of the Decalogue's ban on images as an extension of its immediately prior interdict on "other gods"-a reading of the Decalogue 73 Hebrew: "hokhmat ha-mabatim" (mabatim being a Hebrew equivalent of the Latin term derived from aspicere). In addition to the aspects of conjunction (two planets separated by 0 degrees) and opposition (a separation of 180 degrees), two planets could be trine, sextile, or quartile to one another (i.e., separated by 120, 60, or 90 degrees respectively). For various aspects' negative or positive mean ings within the horoscope, see Laura A. Smoller, History, Prophecy, and the Stars: The Christian Astrology of Pierre d'Ailly, 1350-1420 (Princeton, N.J., 1994), pp. 19-20.</page><page sequence="19">772 A Curial-Rabbinic Exchange stretching back to Augustine at least.74 However that may be, the curialist asser tion of the cherubs' idolatrous character is wholly unexpected in light of the millennium-old Christian propensity to cast the tabernacle cherubs as validators of image worship. It was, it will be recalled, an argument made by Christians most assiduously when discussing these winged sculptures with real or fictional Jewish opposites. Ensnaring the Old Testament sculptures in a last unforeseen coil, Aboul rabi's prelates assert that the talismanic interpretation of the cherubs inevitably subverts Mosaic miracles in "the mind of any person." While the precise nature of the feared subversion goes unspecified, it emerges brightly in Aboulrabi's re sponse, which contests the notion that Moses was a wonder-working magician who made celestial powers active in the transformation of terrestrial affairs. In deed, as Aboulrabi's narrative unfolds, this becomes the key issue: were Mosaic wonders brought about by the divine will or by the astromagical manipulation of cherubic talismans? Though represented as a stenographic account, the curial speech at times belies its reconstituted character. Most obviously, Aboulrabi renders words spoken by members of the Roman curia into flowing rabbinic Hebrew. Then, too, he has the curialists speak in a collective, anonymous voice ("They said") that masks the manner in which any individual curialist might actually have raised a particular concern. More subtle indications are discernible of the speech's partial origins in the mind of its Jewish "scribe" rather than the ipsissima verba of the Christians whose discourse he alleges to relay. The prelates speak of "the potency of the voice and speech" concerning all that Moses desired to know. In so doing, they adroitly allude to a verse in Numbers 7 to be cited at the end of their address while almost imperceptibly glossing the "voice" said to be addressing Moses in the biblical text with the more determinate and readily intelligible "speech" (dibbur). At the same time, this prefatory observation deftly infiltrates the philosophic notion of "po tency" (koab) into the biblical verse, thereby adumbrating the magical theme to come. What is more, this term turns out to be a Leitwort in Aboulrabi's rejoinder, suggesting that its interpolation in the Christian presentation is designed to pre pare this discursive development. Other less consequential instances of anticipa tion and verbal parallelism augment the reader's awareness of the curial speech as an act of re-creation rather than direct discourse.75 With this awareness, the reader wonders anew: are Aboulrabi's curialists real? Even if so, it seems clear that Aboulrabi's presentation of their speech is too well crafted to be an actual record of their extemporaneously delivered oral query. Full of novelties, the curial speech is also replete with pregnant ambiguities and silences. As mentioned, the nature of the danger posed by magical cherubs to the Mosaic miracles goes unclarified. What Moses "wished to know" and the precise manner in which the cherubs facilitated that aim remain unexplained. The speech's conclusion is also less than limpid. The prelates assert that the magical interpre 74 See Pelikan, Christian Tradition, 4:216. 75 The prelates speak of all that Moses "would cause" (literally: "would actualize," hayah po^el), thereby preparing another bit of philosophic nomenclature that recurs in Aboulrabi's response. Simi larly, they query Aboulrabi (darashnu 'elekha), anticipating Aboulrabi's address (nidrashti) in re sponse.</page><page sequence="20">A Curial-Rabbinic Exchange 773 tation of Mosaic wonders might gain credence from the verse in Numbers that speaks of "the voice" heard by Moses in the tabernacle, but rather than elucidating this gnomic proof text, their speech stops short. Such lacunae notwithstanding, the astonishment felt by the pope and his cardinals at "the cherubs that Moses was commanded to make" seems altogether justified by the end of their address, with heavy uncertainties hanging over the nature of the wonders performed by Moses and the legitimacy of the central cultic institution of Aboulrabi's ancient forebears. In other words, at this point in his narration, Aaron Aboulrabi is more than happy to have his readers see him with his back to the curial wall. Having imparted the curial query and some of its larger implications, Aboulrabi resumes his monologue in a bridging passage. He begins by describing his response to the curialist claims: "upon my hearing their words-[which are] 'straightfor ward to the intelligent person' (Prov. 8.9)-I addressed that which they asked me." He seems to allow the validity, or at least plausibility, of the curial doubts, at least on the surface. Yet it seems unlikely that Aboulrabi shared this biblically ornamented aside with his Christian interlocutors. Aboulrabi next describes ges tures of homage made before individual members of the church hierarchy: "I addressed that which they asked me, after taking leave [to speak] and expressing the requisite obeisance from me to them, each one according to his rank in stature and distinction." Just what "gestural acts of deference"76 Aboulrabi performed remain unclear. Of course, offsetting these unspecified gestures of humility is the self-aggrandizement inherent in Aboulrabi's retelling of an appeal to his sapience made by Western Christendom's leading clerics. Reinforcing this element of self advancement is a conspicuous feature of the unfolding narrative: upon completing their speech, pope and cardinals disappear from Aboulrabi's tale, never to return. By reporting his "communication" with the Christian prelates in this way, Aboul rabi leaves the impression that he delivered a response to their doubts so compel ling as to leave his initially assertive interlocutors with nothing to say. In tackling the curialist queries, Aboulrabi again alleges to convey words uttered at Rome at some point in the undefined past ("I addressed that which they asked me.... Following are the beginning of my words") even though, as with the curialist speech, some features of his narration undermine his pretense of immac ulate historical reconstruction. First comes a scriptural flourish in which Aboulrabi entreats divine aid: "May 'the one who gives the wise their wisdom and knowledge to those who know' (Dan. 2.21) supply an 'answer of the tongue' (Prov. 16.1)." By conjuring the image of Daniel preparing to resolve mysteries before gentile eminences, this solicitation of a higher power, with its conventional avowal of humility, turns back on itself, as Aboulrabi invites comparisons between himself and a biblical hero renowned for his ability to decode impenetrable ciphers. How ever apposite the biblicism in this context, it seems unlikely that Aboulrabi, even if he did address the pontiff and his retinue, did so by way of such scriptural allusions (minimally, in his written account he cites verses in Hebrew that would have required translation for a Christian audience). More tellingly, by the middle 76 Geoffrey Koziol, Begging Pardon and Favor: Ritual and Political Order in Early Medieval France (Ithaca, N.Y., 1992), p. 63.</page><page sequence="21">774 A Curial-Rabbinic Exchange of his response, Aboulrabi can be found addressing his reader in the second-person singular, placing this question in his reader's mouth: "Now if you were to say, 'If so, what is the rationale for the making of the cherubs in terms of what they accomplish?' I would first state a general proposition in order to open the eyes of the blind." By this point in his presentation then, if not earlier, the pretense of a verbatim rendering of words first expressed in Rome is abandoned. (Apart from the issue of second-person address, it seems safe to assume that despite Aboulrabi's spiritedness, he was also politic enough to avoid addressing Christendom's leading clerics in such a way as to imply their "blindness.") Here, then, are some of the more telling elements in Aboulrabi's vignette that lead his reader to understand that the translation "from referential event to written text" has entailed transfor mations "radical enough to disrupt ... the proposed identity between event and text" that is elsewhere implied.77 Aboulrabi's main speech bears a threefold structure. In the first part, scriptural data are summoned to undermine the claim that the miracles of Moses were no more than astral magic performed with cherubic aid. A philosophic analysis pitched in the same direction follows and then a concluding section that seeks to explain the increment of divine immanence found in the tabernacle. Though he depicts his humble obeisance before the Christian prelates at his speech's outset, his characteristically self-assured, even condescending tone reasserts itself in the body of the discourse where Aboulrabi scrutinizes the premises of the curial pre sentation, latent and explicit, and finds them wanting. Seen thus, his presentation is not without a touch of interreligious animus, even as it leaves its Christian dramatis personae behind. The scriptural argument against the cherubs' astromagical role commences with a chronological salvo: "It is known to all, and explicit in the Torah" that "ac cording to God's will and command," Moses "performed many miracles and wonders before the manufacture of the cherubs." Nor should it be believed that these earlier feats were accomplished through noncherubic astromagical tech niques. Retrojecting this suspicion into the ancient past, and more or less reprising the language used in the speech of the pope and cardinals, Aboulrabi explains that the Egyptian "wise men and astrologers" pursued the prospect that Moses worked his miracles through "the potency of the wisdom of the constellations and craft of talismans." The ultimate finding of these evidently hostile inquirers was cate gorical. Against their initial intuition, " [t]hey discerned and discovered that all his deeds and wonders occurred through the potency and will of God, who contra venes all [determinations of the] astral networks, and not through the governance of the stars."78 By formulating the finding of Moses's foes as he does, Aboulrabi indicates for the first time how the notion of talismanic cherubs might subvert 77 For the cited formulations, see Laurence de Looze, Pseudo-Autobiography in the Fourteenth Cen tury: Juan Ruiz, Guillaume de Machaut, Jean Froissart, and Geoffrey Chaucer (Gainesville, Fla., 1997), p. 153. 78 Philo found it similarly expedient to adduce such testimony. Those who saw Moses's staff per forming miraculous feats regarded the event "not as works of human cunning [i.e., magic] but as brought about by some higher power." See John G. Gager, "Moses the Magician: Hero of an Ancient Counter-culture," Helios 21 (1994), 181.</page><page sequence="22">A Curial-Rabbinic Exchange 775 Mosaic miracles "in the mind of any person." To understand the cherubs thus is to suggest Moses's equivalence to a pagan magician and deny that his "miracles and wonders" originated in the divine "potency and will." (Elsewhere Aboulrabi found the builders of the "tower of Babel" falling into a similar error by ascribing the flood to stellar causation.)79 Invoking a formula found in earlier Hispano Jewish sources, Aboulrabi counterposes to an astrally governed cosmos a vision of divine governance in which God, "Lord of lords," remains able and willing to contravene, as necessary, stellar causality.80 Little would one know from such ro bust assertions that astral magic played a major role in Aboulrabi's biblical exe geses elsewhere-a theme to which I shall return. To buttress his claim for the divine origins of Mosaic wonders, Aboulrabi ap peals to Mosaic utterances and the hostile testimony of the Egyptian Pharaoh and his court. There is Moses's statement, "You may have this triumph over me: for what time should I plead in behalf of you" (Exod. 8.5), which, as understood by Aboulrabi, stressed that Pharaoh's petition for the removal of the frogs (Exod. 8.2) would occur solely at the omnipotent deity's discretion. By allowing Pharaoh to define the interval of the plague's cessation, Moses drove home the point that "his [Moses's] deed was from God, who is powerful whenever he desires."'81 Aboulrabi takes the statement, "I stand guilty this time. God is in the right and I and my people are in the wrong" (Exod. 9.27), as evidence of Pharaoh's accep tance of the evidently providential design visible in the miraculous events. Simi larly, unable to match the infestation of lice unleashed upon Egypt, Pharaoh's magicians proclaim, "This is the finger of God" (Exod. 8.15), thereby conceding in Aboulrabi's understanding that the plague "was the work of the Lord." In sum, Scripture teaches that every deed of Moses accorded with "the will of God." With the divine origins of Mosaic miracles and their independence from cherubs scripturally secured, the question of "the rationale for the making of the cherubs in terms of what they accomplish" imposes itself forcefully. Unfortunately, though Aboulrabi places this query in his reader's mouth toward the center of his presen 79 Perushim le-rashi ad Gen. 11.5 (fol. 19r). 80 For the formulation in Moses ben Nahman's Torah commentary, see Perushei ha-torah, 1:98 (ad Gen. 17.1). The concept is ascribed there to the Andalusian scholar "Samuel [ibn Naghr?la] the Prince." For shiddud ma ^arekhet in its association with certain divine appellations, see ibid., 1:303-4 (ad Exod. 6.2); and T. Zevi Langemann, "Some Astrological Themes in the Thought of Abraham Ibn Ezra," in Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra: Studies in the Writings of a Twelfth-Century Polymath, ed. Isadore Twersky and Jay M. Harris (Cambridge, Mass., 1993), pp. 55-56. 81 In his commentary on Exod. 8.4-5 (fol. 70v), Aboulrabi stresses the same point, observing that the verb used in this verse accentuates the fact that the frogs' removal came about "from God" such that no special pleading to astral powers would yield a different result. In interpreting thus, he may have had in mind the understanding of the exchange between Moses and Pharaoh proposed by the eleventh-century Babylonian authority Samuel ben Hofni, as reported by Abraham ibn Ezra (Perushei ha-torah, 2:55, ad Exod. 4.6). Samuel wondered why Pharaoh should have responded to the invitation to fix the time of the plague's cessation by stipulating "tomorrow" (Exod. 8.6) rather than immediately. He posited that Pharaoh, having chalked up the plague's existence to the "constellation of the stars of heaven," sought to trick Moses?whom he suspected of knowing of the plague's imminent end in advance?by requesting that the plague be prolonged an extra day. Stress on the fundamental theo logical importance of divine freedom and omnipotence is a feature of Aboulrabi's work from its outset. See, e.g., Perushim le-rashi, fol. 14r.</page><page sequence="23">776 A Curial-Rabbinic Exchange tation, he then recurs to a philosophic analysis of the cherubs' ostensible magical efficacy in keeping with rationalist expressions found elsewhere in his work.82 In so doing, he draws from the vocabulary of Aristotelian physical and metaphysical theory, beginning with what he casts as a "general proposition" needed to "open the eyes of the blind": the scientifically "demonstrated" view that "every act de rives from a potency and that every potency is the potency to bring about some act since potency and act are [from the category of the] correlatives and the ex istence of any correlative requires the existence of the other thing to which it is related. It follows that it is impossible for something that lacks potency to bring about any act."83 Applying this "general proposition" to the case of "figures and talismans" made of "inanimate minerals, trees, and stones"-which lack a ca pacity even to occasion a change in themselves-Aboulrabi asks, "How then can they bring about an act in another?"84 Applying the conclusion implied in this rhetorical question to the case at hand, it becomes clear that handmade trans mutations of gold in figure alone ("gold reworked by human hands," possessing "neither potency nor sentience nor act") are incapable of bringing about changes, let alone wondrous ones, in other bodies. Findings from the scientific examination and exegetical inquiry fully match, even if the former are now set forth in more technical and elevated theological terms: "it is necessary to affirm and believe that all that our master Moses ... would do was not through the instrumentality of any created thing but rather from God alone, Lord of lords."85 Exercising the exegete's prerogative, Aboulrabi forgoes a full-blown theory of miracles (nor, apparently, did pope and cardinals press him on this score). The issue of the agent of miracles, and the degree to which miracles constituted breaks in nature, exercised Muslim, Jewish, and Christian theologians alike. So did the challenge of delineating the boundaries between the divine role and human con tribution (if any) to wondrous events. While Aboulrabi implies that Moses was more than a bystander in the miracles associated with him, speaking repeatedly of "all that Moses did," he insists that Moses's role as a vehicle for the production of wonders did not rise to the level of agency. In so doing, he tacitly argues against the view sure to arise, in the curialists' estimation, "in the mind of any person," 82 Recourse to philosophy in treating all manner of problems is characteristic of Aboulrabi. For a grammatical sample, see his discussion of an adjective's capacity to bear a modifier in Perushim le rashi ad Num. 19.2 (fol. 136r). 83 Hebrew koah (reflecting Greek dunamis) is rendered here as "potency" rather than "potentiality" because this translation allows for a uniform translation of this polyvalent Hebrew term as it arises in different contexts in Aboulrabi's report. In what follows, no effort is made to impart the complex Aristotelian teachings out of which Aboulrabi's remarks arise. See, e.g., Charlotte Witt, Ways of Being: Potentiality and Actuality in Aristotle's Metaphysics (Ithaca, N.Y., 2003). 84 Cf. Aristotle's Physics 202al3-20 and Metaphysics 1046al0-ll. 85 In adding the phrase "Lord of lords ( 'elohei ha- 'elohim)" to his claim of miracles coming "from God alone," Aboulrabi may have meant to reinforce his point regarding nature's ultimate subordi nation to the divine will in keeping with Maimonidean understandings of the term Jelohim. See Guide 2.6 and 2.30 (Pines, 2:261-62 and 2:359), where Maimonides suggests that this term refers, on one hand, to God's governance of forces in nature and, on the other, to those forces themselves. On this understanding, Aboulrabi's formulation might be rendered: "from God alone, Governor over the forces of nature."</page><page sequence="24">A Curial-Rabbinic Exchange 777 if the notion of talismanic cherubs is accepted,86 thereby joining the company of such distinguished theologians as Thomas Aquinas, Nicole Oresme, Levi ben Ger shom, and Hasdai Crescas, all of whom rejected a theory of miracles according to which prophets were the agents of supernatural events.87 Drawing what amounts to his full-scale rebuttal of the curialists to a close, Aboulrabi drastically discounts the significance of the sculptures that had elicited so much anxiety in his interlocutors, though he is elsewhere more than willing to assign symbolic significance to sacerdotal artifacts.88 It was for "the honor of the tablets [found in the ark] and their glory" that "God desired to make his presence dwell in the ark of the covenant 'from above the cover, from between the two cherubs' (Exod. 25.22)." If anything, it is the tablets of the law, not the cherubs that adorned the ark containing them, that stand out as ancient Israel's sacred artifacts par excellence. What they attracted to the tabernacle, however, was not astral efflux but divine presence. With the divine "indwelling" (shekhinah) there installed, it was natural to make the space above the ark cover between the cherubs the conduit for prophecy. Not wishing this greater intensity of divine immanence within the tabernacle to be misunderstood, Aboulrabi hastens to reassert his vision of a transcendent deity "above all his creations" to whom alone "glory and might" belong.89 And doubling back to the cherubs, he clinches his antitalismanic argu ment by citing the divine warrant to Moses: "There [in the tabernacle] I will meet with you and I will impart to you from above the cover, from between the two cherubs [. . . all that I will command you]" (Exod. 25.22). His reading stresses the divine warrant that communications were not to issue "from" the cherubs but "from between" them. Having delivered this exegetical coup de grace, and thereby having returned himself both to his scriptural point of departure in Exodus 25 and to his interpretive metier, Aboulrabi leaves his autobiographical detour behind to resume commentary in an impersonal exegetical voice. Before attempting to set this detour in several broader contexts, a crucial point about its substance must be stressed. Like the curialist speech that he relays, Aboulrabi's discourse on the cherubs departs from earlier paradigms of interpre tation, treating the conundrum of the cherubs' reconcilability with the Decalogue only obliquely while following the curialist presentation in riveting attention on the cherubs' talismanic status and its implications for Mosaic miracles. By devot 86 The pope and cardinals had suggested that the idea of astromagical cherubs generates the corollary that all of the miracles and wonders that Moses would perform (literally, "would actualize") were due to the "potency of the cherubs." Aboulrabi now asks how, lacking "potency," cherubs could "bring about an act" in other entities. 87 See Aviezer Ravitsky, "The Anthropological Theory of Miracles in Medieval Jewish Philosophy," in Studies in Medieval Jewish History and Literature, 2, ed. Isadore Twersky, Harvard Judaic Mono graphs 5 (Cambridge, Mass., 1984), pp. 231-72; and Howard Kreisel, "Miracles in Medieval Jewish Philosophy," Jewish Quarterly Review 75 (1984), 115-31. 88 Aboulrabi argues that the tabernacle in general imparts the wonders of God and man "on the land," i.e., in that place "most distant from the stars." In this context he offers a microcosmic inter pretation of this structure since it is known that "the tabernacle that Moses made attests in its entirety to the template of the cosmos." By way of example, he offers the (commonplace) equation of the seven branched candelabrum with the seven planets. See Perushim le-rashi ad Num. 8.2 (fol. 126r). 89 How Aboulrabi's transcendent stress here comports with his immanent interpretation of the deity expressed elsewhere (Schwartz, "Divine Immanence," as in n. 2, above) requires clarification.</page><page sequence="25">778 A Curial-Rabbinic Exchange ing most of his attention to these intertwined questions, Aboulrabi apparently confirms the centrality of these issues for the pope and cardinals (whose presen tation, it will be recalled, concluded, perhaps tellingly, with a request for insights regarding "our question" in the singular). In short, there is next to nothing ste reotypical in the "Christian" speech or "Jewish" response set forth by Aboulrabi, and this finding clearly has a bearing on one's answer to the question put at the outset: did Aboulrabi really meet with a pope and his cardinals? To that question a related question may now be added: is there any wider context in which this discussion of astromagical cherubs may be set? I turn to the first of the questions, allowing at the outset that a degree of improbability hovers over Aboulrabi's claim to have been consulted on the subject by Western Christendom's foremost religious authorities, all the more once the elements of literary reshaping in his report have been brought into relief. Medieval accounts of legendary rabbinic audiences before popes clearly exist. Some of these are prospective, belonging to the realm of Jewish eschatology; that is, these accounts envision the future Jewish messiah meeting a pope.90 Others, however, relate to premessianic times. In one account, written in the thirteenth century but purporting to be from the early eleventh, a rabbi appears before an unnamed pontiff seeking intervention in acts of violence perpetrated against French Jews only to deliver a speech from "the perspective of the most advanced, as well as the most assertive, in mid-thirteenth century papal thought."'91 In others, an acclaimed Jewish scholar's son is abducted, is baptized, rises in the church hierarchy, and eventually attains the papacy, whereupon his father, having come to plead before the pope, induces him either to renounce Christianity or to die a suicide-martyr's death in expiation of his apostasy.92 While interaction between medieval Christian and Jewish scholars was com 90 In one such, in a manner reminiscent of Aboulrabi's narration, the pope is in his "house" (bayit) "surrounded" by cardinals (Saperstein, Decoding, pp. 103-6, with thanks to Professor Saperstein for sharing the Hebrew text with me). For more on this theme, see Kenneth R. Stow, The "1007 Anon ymous" and Papal Sovereignty: Jewish Perspectives of the Papacy and Papal Policy in the High Middle Ages, Hebrew Union College Annual Supplements 4 (Cincinnati, 1984), pp. 22-23; and Moshe Idel, Messianic Mystics (New Haven, Conn., 1998), p. 61. 91 Stow, The "1007 Anonymous," p. 37.

To cite an example contemporary with Aboulrabi, when the Aragonese theologian Joseph Albo re layed what a Christian scholar "said to me" and introduced his response with phrases like "my answer was as follows," he induced the modern editor of his work to believe that he was reporting "a record of an actual disputation" whereas further investigation "shows that Albo took his Christian arguments directly from his Jewish predecessors and not from a Christian contemporary."94 Similarly, though Joseph ben Nathan Official's Book of Joseph the Zealous told of encoun ters between the author's father and the "pope," the most specific of the passages that report on these yields nothing but "vague generalities" such that it seems likely the exchanges occurred with a lesser church official, perhaps a bishop.95 While free of such legendary elements as a "Jewish pope," Aboulrabi's exeget ical vignette does echo widespread topoi of premodern Jewish literature. In ad dition to the confrontation between Jew and gentile, "one of the most popular themes in Jewish folklore throughout the ages,"96 there is the trope of gentile reliance on Jewish learning, a theme born of Hellenistic Jewish apologetics that was rehearsed by twelfth-century Andalusian-Jewish savants and that persisted in high- and late-medieval Jewish literature and on into early-modern times. In the century after Aboulrabi, a Palestinian kabbalist could dream that he was trans ported to Rome where a pope ("Roman Caesar") told him: "You are the wisest and most skilled of men in the wisdom of truth [i.e., Kabbalah]. I, the most knowl edgeable, want you to reveal to me some of the secrets of the Torah...."9 The 93 See, e.g., Berger, "Mission to the Jews" (above n. 60); Joseph Shatzmiller, "Contacts et ?changes entre savants juifs et chr?tiens ?

What also seems to argue in favor of the invented character of Aboulrabi's curial encounter is the central role accorded to astral magic elsewhere in his tome. Though, read in isolation, Aboulrabi's account of his meeting in Rome suggests that he would never countenance astromagical interpretations of biblical artifacts or narratives, that appearance proves deceiving. For now, to test his curial account, it suffices first to note two striking examples of Aboulrabi's immersion in astro magical interpretation and then to draw the implications of both of these and of the wider body of astromagical evidence in his work. In explicating the famous episode of the Israelites' worship of a golden calf, Aboulrabi affirms that Aaron "intended to make a talisman in the form of a calf," for which purposes he used an engraving tool designed to impart shape to metal. Indeed, Aboulrabi goes so far as to have Aaron attempt a computation of the planetary positions on the day of the calf's fabrication.98 Aboulrabi concludes his remarks with a tantalizing reference to Moses's use of the "power of holy names" to achieve wondrous feats.99 Moving beyond such local interpretations, Aboulrabi elsewhere assigns a fundamental structuring role to the astromagical worldview in order to explain the need for the narratives in Genesis and the beginning of Exodus. Prompted by a question raised by Rashi to the effect that the Torah (that is, "instruction" or "law") should have commenced with an enumeration of com mandments such as appeared only later in the Book of Exodus, Aboulrabi argues the indispensability of the earlier narratives in Genesis and Exodus on the grounds that they serve to eradicate from the minds of "skeptics (meharherim)" any notion that Israel's triumph as reflected in these first two Mosaic books might have oc curred in consequence of "service of the heavens performed through their [the Israelites'] wisdom [which is] akin to the craft of talismans." Such, indeed, was the belief of the Egyptian Pharaoh, who estimated that "Moses had come to van quish him with wisdom possessed by Moses through service of the heavens." On Aboulrabi's reckoning, one overarching reason that the biblical accounts of crea tion and events through the Jewish people's miracle-studded reception of the To relevant sources. In most cases, such sources speak not of "theft" or any other illicit subterfuge but simply of various branches of ostensibly non-Jewish learning originating in Jewish antiquity and being transmitted, often openly from teacher to disciple (e.g., Jeremiah to Plato) or to other nations, the Greeks in particular. 98 Perushim le-rashi ad Exod. 32.1-4 (fol. 96v). Since the sun and moon were both in the sign of Taurus and in conjunction with the malefic planets Mars and Saturn "in the second face in trine aspect," and since each was "close to its house or exaltation" (that is, the point of "maximum action"), "this calf came out." For the cited definition of "exaltation" (the probable translation of Aboulrabi's Hebrew nes?ut), see Willy Hartner, "The Mercury Horoscope of Marcantonio Michiel of Venice," in idem, Oriens-Occidens: Ausgew?hlte Schriften zur Wissenschafts- und Kulturgeschichte (Hildesheim, 1968), p. 451. (I am indebted to Prof. Tzvi Langermann of Bar Ilan University for crucial help in disentangling this passage.) For Aboulrabi's probable main precursor in this approach regarding the calf, see below, pp. 786-87. 99 Perushim le-rashi ad Exod. 32.1-4 (fol. 96v). In this context, Aboulrabi refers to Menahem Re canati's Sefer ha- Hggulim (on which see Moshe Idel, R[abbi] Menahem Reqanati ha-mequbbal [Jeru salem, 1998], p. 77). Professor Idel informs me that this is a unique later Hebrew reference to Recanati's lost work.</page><page sequence="28">A Curial-Rabbinic Exchange 781 rah were not superfluous was that they confuted a fundamental misconception of cosmic causation that otherwise might arise ("in the mind of any person," one could almost say) -a misconception according to which it was astromagical forces rather than special divine providence that had shaped the chosen people's distinc tive destiny.100 In short, though Aboulrabi's stance toward astrology still needs to be delineated with care, it is clear that he recognized the reality of astrology and astral magic but wished to limit their encroachment on God's providential designs for the Jewish people. Just how his exegetical assent to astral magic comports with his stalwart, philosophically sustained rejection of astromagical cherubs also re quires clarification. Like the contemporary Christian proponent of astrology Pierre d'Ailly, Aboulrabi was evidently inclined to preserve "a supernatural causality independent of the stars, at work in the case of miracles and other preternatural events."101 He was evidently disinclined to infuse astromagical influence into the most sacred Jewish spaces. Whatever the reasons for Aboulrabi's rejection of the infiltration of astral magic into "the holy of holies," it might be argued that the speech ascribed to the pope and cardinals by Aboulrabi-in which several of the themes and concerns broached by him at the very outset of his exegetical tract (astromagical conceptions of Jewish history, Mosaic miracles) arise-is a projec tion of his own interests and anxieties. Seen as such, it becomes suspect as an inscription of any actual address delivered by curialists, instead taking on the look of one side of Aboulrabi's religious identity arguing with another. Finally, in seeking to pin down the historical actuality of Aboulrabi's report of a curial encounter, there is the problem that he fails to specify the pope he met and where he met him. As regards the second question, though the Lateran Palace might first suggest itself as the referent of Aboulrabi's "palace of the pope," it had been destroyed by fire and earthquake in the fourteenth century; the Vatican (and Palazzo Venezia, for Paul II) served as the papal residence from the late 1370s on.102 On the slim evidentiary base that Aboulrabi's account affords, the site of his curial encounter remains a matter of speculation and contributes an element of vagueness to his account that renders it slightly questionable.103 Little more tractable is the question of the pope whom Aboulrabi met. Faulty nineteenth-century dating of his work led the few scholars who addressed this issue to identify the pontiff in question either as Martin V (who, by virtue of his election at the Council of Constance in 1417, put an end to the Great Western 100 Perushim le-rashi ad Gen. 1.1 (fol. 13v). 101 Smoller, History, Prophecy, and the Stars, p. 52. 102 Corinne Mandel, Sixtus V and the Lateran Palace (Rome, 1994), p. 38 (with thanks to Tom Cohen for the observation regarding Palazzo Venezia). 103 Stretching the imagination, one might equate Aboulrabi's papal "palace" with the Roman Stu dium curiae, which bore the title of universitas sacri palatii in Aboulrabi's day. Here, at least, is a curial venue where the sort of conundrums ascribed by Aboulrabi to the pope and cardinals might actually have garnered attention.

Though his papacy was no boon to Jews,107 Nicholas's scriptural interests and ties to leading Roman humanists and Christian Hebraists, most notably Giannozzo Manetti, are well attested.108 Yet Aboulrabi's failure to identify the pope whom he met, or to refer to the pope directly after his initial setting of the scene, detracts from the credibility of his claim to have spoken before a pontiff and his cardinals. If one can easily argue the fictional character of Aboulrabi's account of his curial audience, a number of points urge strongly in the opposite direction. To begin circumstantially, it is worth noting that Jewish audiences before popes did occur. In the mid-thirteenth century, a Jewish delegation defended the Talmud before Innocent IV.109 Toward the end of the century, the eccentric self-declared kabba listic messiah Abraham Abulafia attempted an audience with Nicholas 111.110 In the 104 perles?

Martin's treatment of Jews exhibits ups and downs (see Edward Synan, The Popes and the Jews in the Middle Ages [New York, 1965], pp. 135-36) while the evidence for his dialogue with a deputation of Italian Jews relies on a fictional exchange found in the sixteenth-century Ibero-Jewish chronicle Shevet yehudah of Solomon ibn Verga (ed. Azriel Shohat [Jerusalem, 1946], pp. 107-15). Here a pope bearing the invented name Marco Florentine (ibid., p. 201 n. 24)?who may, however, be modeled on Martin V?speaks with two Jews unknown from other sources (p. 210 n. 11). Prior to so doing, he improbably offers a robust defense of Jews in the face of calumnies made against them by a Christian seeking their destruction. 107 Roth, The History of the Jews in Italy, pp. 164-66. 108 Christine Smith and Joseph F.

In short, rabbinic-papal encounters are attested, though the nonpetitionary and largely nonpolemical char acter of the one described by Aboulrabi departs from the exchanges just can vassed.'12 Aboulrabi's account of a curial audience also bears elements of literary and biographical plausibility. Aboulrabi's account is free of most of the vagueness that characterizes other Jewish narratives involving rabbinic-papal encounters. Indeed, its degree of detail is striking, from the reference to "the metropolis of Rome" and "the palace of the pope" with the "cardinals surrounding him" to Aboulrabi's request for leave to speak and reference to his expressions of obeisance before members of the church hierarchy, "each one according to his rank in stature and distinction." What is more, speaking historically and biographically, the possibil ity of Aboulrabi's encounter with a pope and his learned princes is patent. It comes from the pen of a Sicilian-born rabbi who traveled in Italy at a time when the papal seat had been reestablished there and meshes with other passages in Aboul rabi's work that report religious discussions across confessional lines. Indeed, in relating his aforementioned clash with a churchman over the "suffering servant poems,""113 Aboulrabi again has this cleric posing a question to him that was "great in his eyes and in the eyes of all the eminent personages (sarim) surrounding him" and again relays "my answer to him in the presence of all the eminent personages." Even granting some stereotyped features of these reports as reflected in their verbal symmetries, it is hard to see why Aboulrabi should have serially fabricated out of whole cloth such parleys (as well as his previously mentioned sparring match with a Karaite rival), all the more as the conventions of his exegetical genre hardly required such autobiographical insertions. On such grounds alone, one might give serious consideration to the truth of Aboulrabi's claim to have been summoned by figures otherwise used to receiving petitions for aid or redress from far-flung corners of western Europe and to ruling on all manner of questions spiritual and temporal in the Christian domain. The claim becomes more compelling still in light of the fact that, as has been seen, the view imputed by Aboulrabi to his interlocutors departs more or less completely from conventional Christian understandings of the cherubs, not to speak of ste 111 See most recently Frank Talmage, "Trauma at Tortosa: The Testimony of Abraham Rimoch," Mediaeval Studies 47 (1985), 379-411. 112 Meetings between rabbis and members of the church hierarchy who eventually ascended to the Holy See are also attested. Meir ben Simeon, a mid-thirteenth-century leader of Narbonnaise Jewry, held extended discussions with Archbishop Gui Fulcodi not long before the latter became Clement IV in 1265: see Robert Chazan, "Guy Fulcodi and His Jews," Revue des ?tudes juives 132 (1973), 587 94; and Ben-Shalom, "Between Official and Private Dispute," pp. 48-49. Both those authors assume the historicity of this encounter. By contrast, Stow (The "1007 Anonymous," p. 24) implies lingering skepticism when he tells of Meir's re-creation of a "number of purported exchanges on the subject of lending at interest he had with the Archbishops of Narbonne." In 1379 Shem Tov ben Shaprut debated Cardinal Pedro de Luna, the future Benedict XIII; see Norman E.

To these points must be added two others that handsomely fill out the picture. First, for all of its intriguing eccentricity, the talismanic interpretation of the cherubs debated by Aboulrabi and his Christian counterparts fits snugly into a later fifteenth-century Italian milieu. Second, the talismanic conception of the cherubs came to fifteenth-century Italy in the name of Jewish sources, making it more understandable that Christian prelates should summon a rabbi to illumi nate it upon arrival there. It is to elaboration of these points that I now turn. Though the theme of Moses the magician traced to pagan antiquity"14 and was well represented in early-medieval literature (especially in instances where medi eval writers attempted to fathom events at the time of the Israelite exodus from Egypt),'15 the image of Moses as an astromagical adept using cherubs as his tal ismanic conduits was hardly a commonplace. Certainly it is curious that such an anomalous conception of the cherubs should have circulated and occasioned a lively debate at one or another quattrocento papal court. Efforts to trace back such a curiosity to its origins lead in some obscure and unexpected directions. One is a recondite strand of the medieval Jewish biblical commentary tradition reflected in Marsilio Ficino's circle. Another is magical conceptions of Moses and ancient Israelite religious architecture in fifteenth-century Italy. In the Latin West, astrological and magical concerns acquired new currency in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries as works on natural science, astronomy, as trology, and magic preserved in Arabic were translated into languages of western Christendom, with Jews often facilitating this massive act of cultural transmis sion."16 Long suspect because of its associations with pagan superstition and idol atry, astrology increasingly came to be viewed as a science."17 At the same time, 114 John G.

A key text was The Aim of the Sage, a compilation of largely Hellenistic magic composed in eleventh-century Spain, translated into Spanish, and subsequently rendered into Latin under the name Picatrix, whence it became the Bible (or, in Rabelais's famous characterization, diabolical patron saint) of much late-medieval and Renaissance magical lore."8 The thirteenth century also saw the first documentable use of the phrase imago astronomica in Latin literature and the rise of a lively Scholastic debate over the efficacy and permissibility of occult practices, including ones involving astrological figures.1"9 While theoretical discussions of the astrological figure abated somewhat in the later Middle Ages, this period saw ample use of astrological images, especially for medical pur poses.120 In one notable case, Pope Boniface VIII was treated using a talisman, leaving his cardinals astonished both at the use of this curative technique and at the pope's acceptance of this bit of medical astrology.12' Interest in astrological images revived greatly in the later quattrocento under the auspices of Marsilio Ficino. In the final part of his Three Books on Life (1489), this translator, physician, and philosopher merged Scholastic theories of magic and astrological images with ideas born of Neoplatonism, Avicennian "oriental philosophy," and late-medieval Jewish astromagical thought to produce "the full est Renaissance exposition of a theory of magic and the most influential such statement written in post-classical times."'122 Even after Ficino penned an apologia in the Thought and Work of Three Twelfth-Century Jewish Intellectuals," Aleph 1 (2001), 60.

Jewish magic, while it stretched back through the rabbinic era to biblical times, was, like its Christian counterpart, transformed through contact with Arabic as tromagical learning. New trends are first attested in writings of two doyens of twelfth-century Andalusian scholarship, Judah Halevi and Abraham ibn Ezra. In his Judeo-Arabic Book of Refutation and Proof on Behalf of the Despised Reli gion, Halevi cast as infidels those who sought to provoke encounters with the divine through "the calling down of pneuma and making of talismans."5124 He returned to the issue while defensively explaining the ancient Israelites' fabrication of a golden calf. After assimilating this image to the idea of directional orientation in prayer (qibla), Halevi offered the historicizing argument that, following habits of worship then widely in vogue, the Israelites fell prey to blandishments of "as trologers and talisman makers" in their midst who counseled the calf's construc tion in order to attract celestial potency. On this view, the trespass regarding the calf involved no idolatry except in a few instances. Rather, the sin lay in the Israelites' autonomous effort to forge a spiritual connection with God using im ages that lacked divine sanction. That figures carved out of gold could legitimately be used for such purposes explained why there was "nothing strange in the images that God commanded with respect to the cherubs." With this fleeting observation, Halevi furtively identified the cherubs as divinely mandated devices for attracting celestial power and enhancing Israelite fortunes in the wilderness.125 Halevi's colleague Abraham ibn Ezra, "the most famous Jewish astrologer of all time," advanced astromagical ideas in a far wider compass than Halevi while again typically cloaking them in elliptical prose.126 Beyond casting the golden calf as an astromagical instrument (as, possibly under his influence, Aaron Aboulrabi would after him), ibn Ezra alluded to the talismanic properties of various taber nacle appurtenances and of the garments worn by the high priest.127 Though usu ally more guarded, he stated explicitly in one place that the cherubs aimed to attract "the higher power (koab 'elyon)," a key phrase in ibn Ezra's astromagical 123 Copenhaver, "Scholastic Philosophy," p. 523; Kaske and Clark, "Introduction," p. 56. 124 Kit?b al-radd wa-'l-daltl f? i-d?n al-dhal?l (Al-kit?b al-Khazar?) 1.79, ed.

" 128 In advancing such interpretations, ibn Ezra became the first Jewish thinker to interpret a "significant number" of biblical phenomena, including some biblical laws, in astrological terms.129 Wholly different in his bearing toward astral magic was ibn Ezra's younger contemporary Moses Maimonides, to whom the "faultless proofs" of astrology's futility were as patent as the "organic and insoluble link" between this pseudo science and idolatrous star worship.130 Mosaic law was far from being the well spring of efficacious occult arts, as Halevi and ibn Ezra maintained. On the contrary, it had the eradication of specious astromagical spirituality as its "foundation," with many commandments being pitched toward that end.'13 On the basis of exhaustive reading in Arabic literature on the subject, most notably ibn Wahshi ya's Nabatean Agriculture,132 Maimonides described the ancient idolators' ram pant use of talismans "with a view to causing spirits to descend." Though long in retreat before the forces of Abrahamic monotheism, many misbegotten beliefs and practices remained "generally known at present," with "images made of cast metal and stone" still being made to serve astromagical functions even as the divine law aimed to bring about conditions in which "it would not be imagined that any star harms or helps in anything pertaining to the circumstances of human individuals . . . in view of the fact that such an opinion leads to star worship."'133 For a century and half after his death, Maimonides' thoroughgoing repudia tion of astrology-combined with the generally negative attitude toward astral 128 Perushei ha-torah le-rabbenu 'Avraham Jibn cEzraJ, 2:177 (concluding line of the excursus on Exod. 25.40).

In the latter chapter (Pines, 2:540-50), Maimonides catalogs these laws, demonstrating his historicizing approach to segments of Mosaic law (see Amos Funkenstein's article cited above in n. 52; and idem, "Maimonides: Political Theory and Realistic Messianism," Miscellanea mediaevalia 11 [1977], 90-96).

Yet even when the topic was heatedly debated, especially when controversies over Jewish rationalism erupted in Spain and southern France, relatively few Jewish thinkers followed Maimonides in dis missing astral magic as a wholly prohibited and ineffective deception.134 Indeed, during a late-medieval "ibn Ezra Renaissance," astral magic attained great cur rency as Spanish writers in particular produced gloss-commentaries on Abraham ibn Ezra's Commentary on the Torah. Uniting these works, beyond their attempt to combine philosophic and kabbalistic concepts into a broader theological sys tem, was an emphasis on Neoplatonic doctrines such that these authors have been dubbed, by their leading student, "the Neoplatonic circle."'135 What matters in the current context, though, is the wide-ranging development in these writers' works of astromagical hints strewn throughout ibn Ezra's exegetical corpus. In particular, these authors developed understandings of the cherubs and Mosaic miracles akin to the ones imputed by Aboulrabi to the Roman curialists. Several members of the Neoplatonic circle understood prophecy in general, and Mosaic prophecy in particular, in astromagical terms, believing that prophets re ceived astrological information that affected the nature and timing of their ac tions.'36 They also interpreted miracles, including the Egyptian plagues, as products of magical operations, though at least one writer who offered a "comprehensive astrological interpretation of Jewish history and ritual," Joseph ben Eliezar, sought to mute his expressions on this score lest people come to believe that wonders like the plague of hail did not come about "by [virtue ofl the word of God."'137 Some 134 For followers, see Schwartz, 'Astrologyah, p. 115.

Getinio added that the cherubs were manufactured "with this inten tion alone." Though he also felt sure that the cherubs' talismanic function ex plained their duality, he was not expert enough to explain just how this was so, though he was convinced that "the masters of talismans" undoubtedly "knew the reason."5138 In a similar vein, at the turn of the fifteenth century a Navarrese rabbi, Shem Tov ben Shaprut, opined that the indwelling of the divine presence in Israel's sacred shrines required "the designs of the Temple, its vessels and sacrifices.... "139 Taken in aggregate, the teachings on ancient Israel's religious architecture and Mosaic miracles of the "Neoplatonic circle" yield an understanding essentially at one with the view of Aboulrabi's pope and cardinals that the cherubs facilitated "the potency of the voice and speech concerning all that he [Moses] wished to know. "140 To be sure, one wonders about the plausibility of a link between the writings of long-forgotten turn-of-the-fifteenth-century Spanish glossators on Abraham ibn Ezra and Christian thinkers in later fifteenth-century Italy. As it turns out, how ever, such a link exists. Its origins lie in the thought of a yet more mysterious later medieval Jewish thinker: the early-fourteenth-century Portuguese rabbi David ibn Bilia, who was "perhaps the most radical" advocate of astral magic of the Jewish Middle Ages.141 Though ibn Bilia's Commentary on the Torah has not come down, a passage from it appears in the commentary on ibn Ezra by a leading member of the "Neo platonic circle," Samuel ibn Zarza.142 In it, ibn Bilia, basing himself on an un identified "Book of Talismans," described the manner in which metallic forms created at auspicious astrological moments might allow one to foresee the future: "It is written in the Book of Talismans that when zuhal [Saturn in Arabic] is conjoint with 'u.trid [Mercury in Arabic] in the [house of] Aquarius, which has the form of a man, and the ascendant is Gemini, the domicile of Mercury; and it is Wednesday, which is the day of Mercury ... when, at the time of conjunction, the stars have this configuration, pour whatever metal you wish into a mould of a handsome man. The form that is composed of them [the stars of this configu ration] . . . will foretell the future."'143 In the continuation of his remarks, ibn Bilia assimilated these divinatory devices to Laban's "household idols" (terafim; see Gen. 31.19), now understood not as 138 Schwartz, 'Astrologyah, pp. 182-88, and "Le-darkhei ha-parshanut ha-filosofit" (above, n. 2), pp. 86-87. 139 Langermann, "Some Astrological Themes," p. 37. 140 Indeed, Joseph ben Eliezar uses the same verb as Aboulrabi's curialists when he explains that the tabernacle vessels allowed the Israelites "to know" future events (Schwartz, 'Astrologyah, p. 161). 141 Ari Ackerman, "A Magical Fragment of David Ibn Bilia's Me'or Enayim," Kabbalah: Journal for the Study of Jewish Mystical Texts 1 (1996), 76. 142 On this figure, see Schwartz, Yashan be-qanqan hadash, pp. 53-57. 143 For the original Hebrew passage, see Schwartz, 'Astrologyah, pp. 102-3 n. 22.

Rounding out his exposition, ibn Bilia remarked, "[T]hat which testifies to this is the cherubs and the one who is enlightened will contemplate [this fact]." Such contemplation suggests ibn Bilia's general belief in "the divinatory role of the metallic form, fabricated in a particular astrological moment, related to the special influences of the various planets" and his conviction that the divine presence in the ancient Israelite tabernacle was due to the cherubs' "anthropoidic and metallic nature."'145 What comes next is a "wonder" in itself: as has recently been discovered, David ibn Bilia's ruminations on astromagical images in general and the cherubs in par ticular made their way from Portugal to Italy through the agency of Samuel ibn Zarza; in Italy they found acceptance in the circle of Florentine scholars dominated by Renaissance magic's leading theoretician, Marsilio Ficino. In his Three Books on Life of 1489, Ficino cites the view of "the astrologer Samuel Hebraeus, leaning on the authority of David Bil the astrologer," that the "ancient makers of images made statues which foretold the future" and that "the harmony of the heavenly bodies was accommodating to the statues. He says that they cast metal according to the form of a handsome man in the day of Mercury.... "146 Assuming Aboul rabi's presence in Rome in the opening decades of the second half of the fifteenth century, it remains only to clarify some earlier stratum of Italian diffusion of these ideas and to locate them at one or another papal court prior to their appearance in Ficino's work. While such clarification is far off, a place to seek it is not. Yohanan Alemanno was a rabbinic mentor to Pico della Mirandola and long time resident of Florence whose earliest presence in Italy dates to the midquattro cento.147 A scholar of broad interests and syncretistic proclivities, Alemanno was drawn to mystical-magical ideas. One of the few Jewish writers to cite the Hebrew Picatrix, he enthroned magic as the peak of his ideal curriculum and viewed "de scent of the spiritual powers by means of statues and preparations of mixtures and qualities" as the apex of "divine worship.'5148 Indeed, to Alemanno it was 144 Ibn Ezra had interpreted similarly: Perushei ha-torah le-rabbenu Avraham Hbn cEzra\ 1:94, ad Gen. 31.19.

Ficino continues with a fuller rendition of ibn Bilia's teaching: "he [ibn Bilia] says that the harmony of the heavenly bodies was accommodating to the statues. He says that they cast metal according to the form of a handsome man in the day of Mercury [Wednesday] in the third hour. ..."

Alemanno also spoke admiringly of Moses's magical powers. Just as King Sol omon was a consummate magician who constructed the Jerusalem temple in mi crocosmic form with the aim of drawing down the divine presence, so Moses, the other supreme magician in history, "knew how to direct his thoughts and prayers so as to improve the divine efflux." When wishing to perform "signs and won ders," Moses employed magic to induce emanations to create "new supernatural things." 53 Though Alemanno's works were mostly composed after 1489, their origins lie in materials gathered some two decades earlier.154 That fact places Alemanno in proximity to Aboulrabi, especially since some teachings of Alemanno have points in common with the ideas on the tabernacle cherubs and Mosaic miracles set forth by Aboulrabi's pope and cardinals. To be sure, no direct link connects the views of Ficino and Alemanno with the talismanic view of the cherubs advanced by Aboulrabi's curialists. Still, Alemanno's teachings, along with Ficino's Three Books on Life, do supply some conceptual context for particulars of that speech. In judging how much historical context they supply, one does well to remember that Latin translations of Hebrew works "do not exhaust the possible range of Jewish writings that could inspire the Christian intellectuals" working in quattrocento Italy."'5 149 Cited in Moshe Idel, Absorbing Perfections: Kabbalah and Interpretation (New Haven, Conn., 2002), p. 487. 150 Idel, "Seder ha-limmud," and "Astral Dreams," p. 112.

The contextual circle tightens with the discov ery of connections between the late-medieval Hispano-Jewish "Neoplatonic cir cle" and magically oriented Christian and Jewish Neoplatonists in later fifteenth century Italy. It is conceivable that curialists in Aboulrabi's day-especially if that day is extended to the 1470s or 1480s-should have learned of an astromagical interpretation of the cherubs that they considered at once tenable but troubling. And while the idea that these curialists might then have solicited Aboulrabi's help may yet engender skepticism, this skepticism can be mollified once an attempt is made to place Aboulrabi's rabbinic-curial colloquy in a longer trajectory of Christian-Jewish religious and scholarly interaction in Italy in later medieval and early Renaissance times. In the early Middle Ages, Christian scholars mainly addressed Jewish ones in a polemical or missionary mode while Jewish scholars, then mostly concentrated in Muslim lands, often perceived Christendom and its Jewries as intellectually de generate. A striking expression of this latter sentiment occurs in a letter sent by Maimonides to the southern French scholar Samuel ibn Tibbon in which he mar vels that "a son born among the stammerers [Christians] should [nevertheless] pursue the sciences."'156 For his part, ibn Tibbon perceived a shift in the rhythm of religio-intellectual developments in the Islamic and Christian spheres, once ob serving that "the true sciences are far better known among the [Christian] nations ... in whose lands we live than they are in the lands of Ishmael."157 Nowhere were the new prospects for interfaith scholarship implied by ibn Tib bon's comment pursued more avidly than Italy, where, in the thirteenth and four teenth centuries, Christian-Jewish religious and scholarly interchanges flourished. Ibn Tibbon's student Jacob Anatoli serves as a case in point. While a physician at the court of Frederick II, he worked "in an environment of sophisticated Christian intellectuals,"'158 collaborating with the Christian polymath Michael Scot on Latin translations of Averroes and even quoting Scot in his sermons.159 In the second half of the thirteenth century, Anatoli's student Moses of Salerno, another court translator, studied Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed with the Dominican friar Nicholas of Giovinazo. In this same period, a "Thomistic school" of Jewish thought arose in Italy whose foremost exemplar was another court translator, Judah ben Moses of Rome.160 156 Lgerot ha-rambam, 2:531. 157 Samuel ibn Tibbon, Ma'amar yiqqavu ha-mayim, ed.

For the Thomistic school,</page><page sequence="40">A Curial-Rabbinic Exchange 793 If anything, the fifteenth century saw an intensification of such interreligious liaisons in Italy, including at the papal court. The century's early decades saw Jewish students begin to enter Italian universities regularly. Among the first to take advantage of the new dispensation was Moses Bonavoglia, the Sicilian rabbi and physician with whom Aaron Aboulrabi conferred on matters of biblical interpre tation.161 In later decades, one Jewish university graduate assumed the position of doctor and familiaris to Popes Martin V and Eugenius IV while the Jewish scholar Moses di Rieti, whose Lesser Sanctuary earned him the (highly exaggerated) so briquet "Dante Ebreo," attended Pope Pius 11.162 Two figures who illustrate the intensification of cross-confessional scholarly exchange in the mid-fifteenth century are the aforementioned Giannozzo Manetti and Yohanan Alemanno's mentor, Judah ben Yehiel. The latter, while cultivating a distinctive amalgam of talmudism, medieval philosophy, and Renaissance humanism, earned doctoral degrees in phi losophy and medicine and had the honorary title "Messer" bestowed upon him by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick 111.163 The former, apostolic secretary in Rome from 1453 to 1455, studied with at least two Jewish scholars. Included in his list of readings were exegetical works of Abraham ibn Ezra.164 The picture of intense Christian-Jewish interreligious dialogue in or around Aboulrabi's day is illustrated further by the career of Giovanni Pico della Miran dola. Pico's invention of Christian Kabbalah was made possible by Flavius Mith ridates, a Sicilian-born Jewish convert to Christianity who arrived in Rome in the 1470s and rendered a range of kabbalistic works into Latin for Pico. Mithridates' father was Nissim Abu al-Faraj, an astrological-kabbalistic adept perhaps known to Aboulrabi, who imparted Jewish learning to his son in Sicily.165 Pico's mentor in Kabbalah, Yohanan Alemanno, has already been mentioned. Another Jewish tutor, Elijah Delmedigo, produced writings for Pico and other Christian notables, including the future cardinal of San Marco, Domenico Grimani.166 This sketch of patterns in later medieval and early Renaissance Italian Jewish see Hava Tirosh-Rothschild, Between Worlds: The Life and Thought of Rabbi David Ben Judah Messer Leon (Albany, N.Y., 1991), p. 119, and the literature cited there.

That said, it is clear that Aboulrabi's report occupies a complex space between historical occurrence and textual reworking on the one hand and between biblical exegesis, theological-philosophic reflection, and polemical en gagement on the other. Whether historically grounded or not, the report is accurate in important respects. It points to conundrums about the universe and God's immanence within it that genuinely exercised Christian and Jewish thinkers, and it represents the sort of exchange that occurred with increasing frequency in later medieval and early-modern times between Christian and Jewish savants-an ex change in which shared religious or scholarly concerns were addressed in a manner largely free of polemical animus and in an atmosphere marked by considerable mutual respect. APPENDIX A Translation of Perushim le-rashi (Constantinople, [1525?]), Fol. 91v Paragraph divisions have been added to the original. When I was in the metropolis of Rome in the palace of the pope, with the cardinals surrounding him, I was asked this question. They said: We are most amazed and astonished about the matter of the cherubs that Moses was commanded to make in the holy of holies in a manner that the potency of the voice and speech concerning all that he [Moses] wished to know would come forth from them. This is tantamount to the craft of talismans manufactured in accordance with the po tencies of the constellations and the wisdom of aspects [i.e., the angular relationships between planets-conjunction, opposition, and so forth]. There is no greater [violation of the prohibition against] "other gods" [Exod. 20.3] than this. He [God] had already enjoined as a root of the Decalogue at its beginning: "You shall have no other gods besides me. You shall not make for yourself a sculptured image, or any likeness, and so forth" [Exod. 20.3-4]. It [also] states: "You shall not make molten gods for yourself" [Exod. 34.17]. Such [prohibitions] are many, and there is no greater [example of] molten gods than the cherubs. It would [therefore] arise in the mind of any person that all of the miracles and wonders that Moses would perform [literally, "actualize"] were by means of the potency of the cherubs, as it states: "[When Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with him] he would hear the voice addressing him from above the cover that was on top of the ark of the pact between the two cherubs, and so forth" [Num. 7.89]. Therefore we have queried you whether there is an answer to our question. So, upon my hearing their words-[which are] "straightforward to the intelligent per son" [Prov. 8.9]-I addressed that which they asked me, after taking leave [to speak] and expressing the requisite obeisance from me to them, each one according to his rank in stature and distinction. Following are the beginning of my words: May "the one who gives the wise their wisdom and knowledge to those who know" [Dan. 2.21] supply an "answer of the tongue" [Prov. 16.1]. It is known to all, and explicit in the Torah, that our master Moses, upon whom be peace, had, according to God's will and command, performed many miracles and wonders before the manufacture of the cherubs. [What is more] Pharaoh's wise men and astrologers tested him in a searching</page><page sequence="42">A Curial-Rabbinic Exchange 795 investigation [to determine] if his deeds occurred by means of the potency of the wisdom of the constellations and craft of talismans. They discerned and discovered that all his deeds and wonders occurred through the potency and will of God, who contravenes all [determinations of the] astral networks, and not through the governance of the stars. As Moses said to them: "You may have this triumph over me: for what time should I plead in behalf of you" [Exod. 8.5]. This was to inform Pharaoh that his deed was from God, who is powerful whenever he desires. Thus did he [Pharaoh] say: "I stand guilty this time. God is in the right and I and my people are in the wrong" [Exod. 9.27]. So did the magicians say to Pharaoh: "This is the finger of God" [Exod. 8.15]. They conceded that it [the plague of lice] was the work of the Lord. Thus it is clear that every deed of our master Moses, upon whom be peace, was in accordance with the will of God, blessed be he. Now if you were to say, "If so, what is the rationale for the making of the cherubs in terms of what they accomplish?" I would first state a general proposition in order to open the eyes of the blind [cf. Isa. 42.7]. It is demonstrated in science that every act derives from a potency and that every potency is the potency to bring about some act since potency and act are [from the category of the] correlatives and the existence of any correlative requires the existence of the other thing to which it is related. It follows that it is impossible for something that lacks potency to bring about any act. Now figures and talismans are made of inanimate minerals, trees, and stones that lack potency even with respect to [bringing about change in] themselves. How then can they bring about an act in another? Now the cherubs were from the mineral167 of gold reworked by human hands. They possess neither potency nor sentience nor act. If so, it is necessary to affirm and believe that all that our master Moses, upon whom be peace, would do was not through the instrumentality of any created thing but rather from God alone, Lord of lords. For the honor of the tablets and their glory God desired to make his presence dwell in the ark of the covenant "from above the cover, from between the two cherubs" [Exod. 25.22] and from there did he choose to make overflow his prophecy and all of his wonders. He is blessed above all his creations for to him alone belong glory and might. The proof168 [that the cherubs did not draw down astral forces] lies in the verse, "There I will meet with you and I will impart to you from above the cover, from between the two cherubs [.. . all that I will command you]" [Exod. 25.22]. It did not say "from the cherubs" [but from between them]. 167 Reading "mi-mahsav" for "mi-shahsav." 168 Reading "re'ayah" for "re'ayot."
