<plain_text><page sequence="1">Viewpoint Beethoven's Orpheus-or Jander's? EDWARD T. CONE Owen Jander's interpretation of the Andante con moto of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto (see this issue, pp. 195-212) is provocatively fas- cinating as an imaginative suggestion, but as a literal prescription it is likely to arouse strenu- ous opposition. Jander himself seems undecided about how he wishes us to take it. On the one hand he speaks of Marx's "discovery," and he announces his own "intention here to demon- strate that the constantly resurfacing rumor about this piece of music is indeed true" (my italics). Later he characterizes the "five musi- cal-programmatic sections" revealed by his analysis as "in my opinion, incontrovertible." Yet, as his conclusion frankly admits, "All of the above may be nothing more than an amaz- ing array of coincidence." Coincidence or not, Jander himself--regard- less of what he may expect of his readers-is ob- viously convinced of the truth of his basic hy- pothesis that Beethoven had the Orpheus legend in mind. In view of his scrupulous docu- mentation, he may well be right. But on that as- sumption, just how well does his reconstruc- tion match program to music? Certainly the way he fits the dialogue from Kanne's Hell-gate scene to Beethoven's opening colloquy is brilliant-even though he does have to transfer Orpheus's opening line. After that, however, he falters. "Evidence suggests," he says, "that the story continues right to the last measure of the movement." By this he means that the music depicts not only Orpheus's en- trance into Hades, but also his further adven- tures there. But where is the evidence? Finding no single poetic source that seems to fit the di- rection of the music, he concocts one by juxta- posing lines from Ovid and Virgil, sometimes out of their original order. Even so, his version moves from Orpheus's confrontation with the Furies directly to his homeward journey with Euridice, drastically telescoping the action. There are other problems as well. Why is the imitative reference to the lyre reserved for the depiction of the return journey? Surely Orpheus accompanied himself while he sang to the Fu- ries-as attested by Gluck's orchestration and by Kanne's libretto ("Ihr Saiten"). Then there is the question of role. At the outset we are asked to accept the piano as representing Orpheus and the orchestral strings as those forces marshalled against him. But in Jander's analysis, those roles become strangely confused during the latter half of the movement. The three thunderclaps are relegated to the piano (not very convinc- 19th-Century Music VIII/3 (Spring 1985). ? by the Regents of the University of California. 283</page><page sequence="2">19TH CENTURY MUSIC A (13 mm.) mm. 1-5 6-13 (i) A' (13 mm.) 14-18 19-26 (i) -----~~~ B (13 mm.) 26-32 33-38 (V) B' (26 mm. + 39-44 45-64 (i) cadenza) (upbeat in 38) .----"" Coda (9 mm.) 64-72 (i) Example 1 ingly-are those the best "crashes" of which Beethoven was capable?); and Euridice's final speech is divided between strings and piano. Surely, however, whether or not we wish to at- tach any programmatic value to their parts, we hear the piano on the one hand and the strings on the other as maintaining their distinct iden- tities from first to last! Let me therefore offer a counter-program. Taking Beethoven at Jander's word, I too shall accept the movement as depicting some phase of the Orpheus story. Unlike Jander, for whom "any attempt to analyze the form of this move- ment without constant reference to its Orphic program is ... futile," I hold that any attempt to impose a program without constant reference to the musical form is futile. So I shall begin with a brief analysis-which, being purely musical, finds not five sections but two, each of which is again bifurcated. In both cases the second sub- section is a modified repetition of the first; the last subsection is expanded by a cadenza and fol- lowed by a coda. True, these articulations are somewhat obscured by the elided cadences that conclude both principal sections (mm. 26 and 64). In ex. 1, this device is indicated by the lines linking the repeated measure numbers. I have also tried to show, by still further bifurcations, how the two variations correspond to their orig- inals. This is obvious in the case of the closely matching first pair; less so in the second case, where the variation doubles the length of the thirteen-measure model-not to speak of the interpolated cadenza. The details are shown in ex. 2. What emerges, then, is a two-part form: AA'- BB'-Coda according to thematic structure, i-i- V-i in E minor according to the chief cadences. From both points of view, the third and fourth subsections are closely bound together. More- over, B', despite the partitions that indicate its parallels with B, is essentially unitary. It is not broken up by the cadenza, which merely ex- pands a single chord (V9). According to this anal- ysis, I can find no justification for the major the- matic and temporal break in the program that Jander assumes at m. 47. I conclude either that Beethoven was not trying to represent the entire journey through Hades, or else that he was do- ing so very ineptly from a musical-formal point of view. Preferring to think the best of Beethoven, I confine my hypothetical reconstruction of the story to the Hell-gate scene alone, and I next ex- amine details of the individual phrases to see what support they may offer. When I do so, I dis- cover that the confrontation between the ag- gressive, peremptory strings and the pleading piano is not limited to the obvious contrasts of dynamics, texture, and melodic material. The linear and chordal motion as well is most re- vealing: mm. 1-5: The strings outline a half-cadential progres- sion in E minor: i-VI-ii0-V. 6-13: The piano, accepting the challenge, picks up the dominant and leads it, despite a pause on III, firmly back to the tonic. 14-18: The strings try to divert the tonal direction toward VII. This they do by substituting C# in m. 15 for the C of m. 2. 19-26: The piano parries the threat by using v to ef- fect a deceptive cadence in VII; a second phrase insists on returning to i. 26-38: The strings, impatiently overlapping the pi- ano's cadence, try a new diversion, this time toward VI, through the melodic rise A-B-C. But the piano, equally impatient, interrupts and reinterprets those moves in such a way as to force the strings to return, by way of the melodically awkward harmonic minor scale (C-D#-E) to i. In that key the piano de- scends to a half-cadence on V. mm. 33-34 35 36 37 38 (V) 45-46 47-48 49-50 51-54 55-63 (V) 64 (i) Example 2 284</page><page sequence="3">38-47: The strings now show signs of indecision or exhaustion-but not only through the obvi- ous change in dynamics. This time they cannot overlap the piano V and must conse- quently lose their initial downbeat. Gradu- ally they accede to the piano's occupation of E minor, demonstrating acquiescence by rising smoothly through the melodic minor scale to E. (Notice how neatly this move an- swers that of mm. 14-18. There, C# replaced C? in an attempt to dissuade the piano from its resolution; here the same substitution suggests submission.) 47-64: The piano, as if emboldened by its apparent success, makes its most impassioned appeal so far, breaking away from the thirteen- measure model and freeing its melody from periodic and motivic constraints. Harmoni- cally, however, its burden is simple and fa- miliar: an expanded i-iv-i4-V7-i. (From a programmatic point of view, the free expan- sion might emphasize that here Orpheus is making his supreme effort. And if one wishes to hear an imitation of the lyre in this passage, I have no objection.) 64-72: The strings, completely subdued, recall their move to VI; now of their own accord they continue to a iv-V-i cadence. The pi- ano, having gained their acceptance, joins them in the progression, even imitating their motif of mm. 68-69 with a version of its own, mm. 69-70. A certain amount of anthropomorphism has adulterated the above description, for in the in- terests of concision I have combined two steps: a rudimentary harmonic outline, and its possi- ble programmatic interpretation. In so doing I hope I have made clear why I prefer reading the entire movement as a depiction of the single scene of Orpheus's encounter with the Furies. Let me make it clear, though, that I do not in- sist on the relevance of my program. I offer it only as one that is more convincing to me than Jander's, and one that equally well fits the his- torical context he has described. But in the ab- sence of a well-defined iconography (which mu- sic has never had, even in the days of the Baroque figures or of Wagnerian leitmotives), only a definitive word from the composer could designate a program as anything but conjecture. A more crucial question emerges here. Re- gardless of which program we choose, do we need one at all? Indeed, in the absence of a de- scriptive title or other verbal indications, have we the right to accept any? I have argued elsewhere that a program can in- fluence our experience of musical content by giv- ing it a specific conceptual context, but that this context can only be exemplary--that is, "sugges- tive of the total expressive potential" of the com- position, but by no means exhausting it. If the music is good enough, one can ignore the pro- gram and "let the music communicate its ex- pressive message through one's subconscious as- sociations with its symbolic gestures."' Beethoven, I am sure, would have agreed. Czerny, as quoted by Jander, reports the mas- ter's belief that "music is not always so freely felt by the hearers when a definitely expressed object has already fettered their imagination." I take that as a warning, not against the com- poser's use of a program, but against the listen- er's undue reliance upon it. If, as Jander sug- gests, Czerny's surmise that the Andante represents "an antique tragic scene" derives from Beethoven himself, can we not infer that the composer, unwilling to "fetter the imagina- tion" of his pupil, gave him only a vague sugges- tion of the program? I realize that the act of making an identifica- tion affords deep pleasure, at least for many of us. The more difficult the identification, the greater the pleasure, as every bird-watcher knows. I am further convinced that this plea- sure is at some level aesthetic: to be made aware of the iconography of a puzzling picture, such as Piero della Francesca's Flagellation, greatly en- hances my enjoyment of the picture as a work of art, not to speak of my appreciation of it as a his- torical and biographical document.2 But Piero was working within a tradition of clearly recog- nized pictorial and iconographic norms. He had no reason for wishing to conceal his subject. On the contrary, as an artist working on a commis- sion for a patron, he had every reason for wish- ing that subject to be obvious. That it is no longer so is due not to his secrecy but to our ig- norance. Our pleasure in the identification is thus fully legitimate, and it is all the greater be- cause of our conviction that we are at last seeing the picture as Piero meant us to see it. These arguments clearly fail to apply to the 'Edward T. Cone, The Composer's Voice (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1974), p. 168. 2See Marilyn Aronberg Lavin, Piero della Francesca: The Flagellation (New York, 1972). 285 VIEWPOINT</page><page sequence="4">19TH CENTURY MUSIC concerto movement. Jander's investigation is certainly valuable for the light it throws on cul- tural history and on Beethoven's literary inter- ests, but its effect on our aesthetic enjoyment will always be tainted by the suspicion of ille- gitimacy. The case has not been proved, and even if it should ever be proved, the question would still remain: to what extent can a private program, never intended for public consump- tion, be relevant to the proper understanding of a composition? There is, to be sure, a joy in satisfied curiosity that explains our delight in the revelation of the secret program behind Berg's Lyric Suite; but is our musical reaction to the work really affected thereby? We are perpet- ually teased by compositions that seem to em- body undisclosed programs-e.g., the Andan- tino from Schubert's A-Major Sonata, D. 959; or Chopin's B-Major Nocturne, op. 32, no. 1. Would we be gratified or disappointed to have our imaginations fettered by the discovery of the composers' extra-musical intentions? Jander believes that such knowledge, whether or not sanctioned by the composer, can be especially relevant to a proper performance. If that is true, it is hard to understand why the composer should choose to withhold such cru- cial information. Nor does Jander tell us just how a performance in which "all of the musi- cians involved will be seeking to communicate the often-told story of Orpheus" will surpass, or even differ from, one in which all the musicians are seeking to communicate the musical val- ues, formal and expressive, revealed by Beethoven's text. My own "counter-program" tried to put some of those values into words. I must now confess that it was not, in fact, really designed as a program. Rather, it was an attempt to ver- balize the expressive effects of the most obvious musical gestures. If those effects constitute a program at all, it is a highly abstract one that could be adapted to any number of specific sce- narios--the Orpheus scene among them. (It will be noted that my account mentioned the Orpheus story only once, and then only paren- thetically. The other images can all be read as metaphors, as verbal parallels of specific musi- cal events.) I contend that a performance based on such an approach would adequately project the con- tent of the movement whether or not the play- ers kept before them the image of Orpheus and the Furies. That is an example of what I meant when I wrote, "The best program music ... can be heard as absolute music."3 Nevertheless, Jander has certainly aroused my curiosity: I eagerly await a sequel in which he will expand his teasing suggestion "that the op. 58 is a cyclic work and that it should eventually be recognized as Beethoven's 'Orpheus' Concerto." , 3Cone, The Composer's Voice, p. 169. 286</page></plain_text>
