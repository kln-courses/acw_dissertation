<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hanslick's Animism* FRED EVERETT MAUS A simple account of Hanslick's relation to contemporary musical aesthetics and musical analysis E duard Hanslick's short book, On the Musically Beautiful (as Geoffrey Payzant's recent translation renders the title),l has profoundly shaped recent philosophical discussions of musical aesthetics, and philosophers have acknowledged its centrality in this area. According to Francis Sparshot, Hanslick's emphasis on formal 273 relations "has won acceptance as one of the permanently possible positions in the aesthetics of music."2 Roger Scruton writes that Hans- lick's essay is marked ... by a philosophical seriousness and competence that have few rivals in the field of musical aesthetics.3 Volume X * Number 3 * Summer 1992 The Journal of Musicology ? 1992 by the Regents of the University of California * This is a slightly revised version of a paper presented at the American Musicological Society Meeting in Oakland, 199o.

That these citations from Sparshot and Scruton come from The New Grove bears witness to the institutional authority of Hanslick's book, as does the inclusion of passages by Hanslick in anthologies for use in teaching aesthetics (cf. Morris Weitz, ed., Problems in Aesthetics [New York: Macmillan, 1959], or Frank Tillman and Steven Cahn, eds., Philosophy of Art and Aesthetics [New York: Harper and Row, 1969]).</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY Peter Kivy closes a recent article about Hanslick with vividly worded praise: It seems to me that Hanslick's little book, for all of its vagaries and mistakes, shines out like a beacon of musical clarity and truth in a century that saw the writing of more nonsense about music than any other period in history that I can think of. That of course is why musicians, musicologists, and philosophers today continue to be drawn to it.4 Kivy identifies Hanslick's book as a beacon, isolated and elevated, shedding light in the darkness of nineteenth-century nonsense. A beacon serves as a guide, but also as a warning; as Kivy's figure im- plies, Hanslick writes, in part, to help his readers steer clear of various dangerous errors. The consensus among these writers reflects a remarkable conti- nuity between Hanslick's most explicit formulations and the concerns of contemporary writers on musical aesthetics. There are two main aspects of this continuity. (1) Aestheticians treat Hanslick as a reward- 274 ing interlocutor: they continue to discuss Hanslick's claims and argu- ments respectfully, much as philosophers concerned with ethics dis- cuss the views of Aristotle, Kant, or Mill. (2) Further, apart from the specific claims or arguments that it contains, Hanslick's book defines the basic issues of musical aesthetics in a particular way, and Hans- lick's conception of the topic continues to dominate recent discus- sions. Much of the book investigates alleged relations between music and feeling or emotion. Hanslick argues that no such relations are pertinent to the beauty of music; instead, he claims, the beauty of music derives from its "specifically musical" traits. The book focuses on a stark contrast between feeling-based theories of musical beauty and Hanslick's own account of what he calls "a beauty ... that consists simply and solely of tones and their artistic combination." (p. 28) Such contrasts continue to influence discussions of musical meaning or content, whether or not the authors endorse Hanslick's conclusions. Kivy's article, entitled "What Was Hanslick Denying?," attempts to specify the claims about music and emotion that Hanslick opposes. The title reflects a striking fact about Hanslick's exposition: much of the book is taken up with arguments against views that Hanslick re- jects. Apart from his arguments against the aesthetic relevance of 4 Peter Kivy, "What Was Hanslick Denying?," in The Journal of Musicology VIII (Winter 1990), i8.</page><page sequence="3">HANSLICK'S ANIMISM relations between music and feeling, Hanslick also devotes a chapter to arguments that music owes little to nature, and another chapter to the demonstration that familiar distinctions between content and form have no application to music. His positive claims about musical beauty and musical experience take up a relatively small portion of the essay, and it is easy to feel that the positive account remains somewhat elusive. At two different points Hanslick recognizes the slightness of his positive account. In a "Foreword to the Eighth Edition," he identifies "the one main thesis" of the book as "a negative one," namely that "from all the customary appeals to feeling, we can derive not a single musical law" (p. xxii). He continues: To the aforementioned thesis there is an antithesis: that the beauty of a piece of music is specifically musical, i. e. is inherent in the tonal relationships without reference to an extraneous, extramusical con- text. It was the sincere intention of the author to elucidate fully the "musically beautiful" as the vital issue of our art and the supreme principle of its aesthetics. If, however, the polemical and negative element took an overemphasis in the realization of this intention, I hope the reader will pardon this, considering the special circum- 275 stances of the time. (p. xxiii) And Hanslick elaborates, explaining that his negative emphasis was shaped by the need to counter the "spokesmen for the 'music of the future.' " This explanation is not altogether convincing; one might think that an effective argument against these "spokesmen" could appro- priately include the detailed articulation of a persuasive alternative position. A more 1ertinelt explanation comes in the chapter devoted to the natiure oi musical l ealt v, in which, after offering metaphors of music as arabesque and as a kaleidoscope, Hanslick, as though doubt- ing the adequacy of his descriptions, writes that "it is extraordinarily difficult to describe this specifically musical, autonomous beauty" (p. 30). Perhaps the reason that Hanslick did not fully elucidate musical beauty is just that he found it a daunting task. Of course, this sug- gestion raises the question of why a description of musical beauty should be so daunting. Recently several writers have suggested that Hanslick's sketchy, abstract positive account of musical beauty has been filled out in greater detail by twentieth-century music theory and analysis. Joseph Kerman links Hanslick's views to the self-imposed limits of musical analysts. As Kerman puts it,</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY If music is only "sounding form," the only meaningful study of music is formalistic; and while Hanslick was not an analyst, later critics took it on themselves to analyze music's sounding form in the conviction that this was equivalent to its content.s Similarly, Edward T. Cone claims that by the late nineteenth century, a ... formalistic view, expounded by critics like Gurney and Hans- lick and furthered by theorists like Schenker, was gaining support.... As a result, even those who still defended the possibil- ity and relevance of musical expression were loath to define its na- ture in any specific terms.') According to Kerman and Cone, Hanslick's work articulates the un- derlying assumptions of musical analysis, and figures in an account of the historical origins of analysis; meanwhile, analysis "furthers" Hans- lick's aims by offering a more precise account of "music's sounding form." Nicholas Cook, arguing along similar lines, has suggested that Schenker's theories can be regarded as an extension of Hanslick's 276 position; indeed, Cook claims that "Schenker can be read as an apol- ogist for Hanslick," and, he adds, "so, too, can Forte, and Lerdahl and Jackendoff, and even Nattiez."7 In evaluating these claims about the relation of Hanslick's thought to music theory and analysis, one must account for the fact that Hanslick writes disparagingly about musical analysis. Comment- ing on the difficulty of describing the beauty of music, he states that music ... can be talked about only in dry technical definitions or with poetical fictions.... Music demands once and for all to be grasped as music and can be only from itself understood and in itself enjoyed. (p. 30) Hanslick offers only one brief passage of analytical writing in the book, and he does not seem completely pleased with the result; after commenting on a passage from Beethoven's "Prometheus" Overture, he writes that such analysis "is apt to destroy all beauty" (p. 14). 5Joseph Kerman, "How We Got into Analysis, and How to Get Out," in Critical Inquiry VII/2 (Winter 1980), 315. 6 Edward T. Cone, "Schubert's Promissory Note," in 19th Century Music V/3 (Spring 1982), 233. 7 The argument about Schenker appears in Nicholas Cook, "Schenker's Theory of Music as Ethics," in The Journal of Musicology VII, 415-39. The citation is from his contribution to a collective article, "The Future of Theory," in Indiana Theory Review X (1989), 71.</page><page sequence="5">HANSLICK'S ANIMISM It may be that Hanslick's disdain for "dry technical definitions" simply reflects a need for better analytical methods; perhaps an ex- cellent analysis, using methods not yet available to Hanslick, could exhibit the beauty of a composition, although Hanslick's analysis does not. In one passage, Hanslick sketches some requirements for "an 'exact' science of music after the model of chemistry or physiology" (p. 35). Evidently Hanslick regards this project as a part of empirical psychology; he describes the proposed science as an investigation of the nature of each separate musical element and its connection with a specific impression ... and finally the reduction of these detailed observations to general laws. (p. 34) His discussion shows that Hanslick is aware of the need for such a theory to reflect the complex interactions of musical elements, avoid- ing the simplifications of an atomistic approach. This passage suggests that Hanslick would have approved of the general goals of contem- porary theory and analysis, though of course one cannot know whether he would have been satisfied by the work of any particular theorist such as Schenker or Forte. 277 On the basis of the material I have cited, one can suggest that aesthetics and musical analysis bear complementary relations to Hans- lick's thought. Aestheticians generally accept Hanslick's conception of an important range of questions about emotional expression, emo- tional arousal, and purely musical qualities, but aestheticians may argue for different answers to Hanslick's questions. Music theorists and analysts, in effect, presuppose Hanslick's conclusions about the aesthetically relevant qualities of music. They do not continue to pur- sue his arguments about the irrelevance of feeling to musical beauty, working instead at more refined descriptions of "tones and their ar- tistic combinations." Some passages that make it harder to accept the received view of Hanslick's position This tidy account of Hanslick's relation to more recent thought probably does capture the role of Hanslick's work in the self- conception of many aestheticians and analysts. The problem is that this account must ignore some of the most interesting and memorable passages in Hanslick's book.8 In particular, his positive account of 8 The following reading is based on what a present-day reader can find in Hans- lick's essay. In the current historicist mood of much musicological work, this may seem problematic: if I want to argue that Hanslick has not been fully understood, shouldn't I show what his text might have meant in its original context? Of course such an</page><page sequence="6">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY musical beauty, brief and elusive as it is, includes several intriguing passages in which Hanslick attempts to convey the aesthetic qualities of music; his descriptions are not technical, and they are not confined to neutral generalities about "tones and their artistic combinations." These passages mostly present analogies or metaphors, and Hanslick's book gives clear instructions about how to interpret such language. In writing about music, according to Hanslick, one often resorts to figurative language, and, as he puts it, We may use such epithets to describe music (indeed we cannot do without them), provided we never lose sight of the fact that we are using them only figuratively. (p. 32) Accordingly, if Hanslick's position has been more adequately articu- lated by such subsequent writers as Schenker and Forte, perhaps theory and analysis can simply replace Hanslick's figurative descrip- tions of music. The figurative language would be merely provisional, retaining little interest once one begins to have an exact science of music. 278 But, despite Hanslick's own endorsement of such an interpreta- tion, I believe it would be a mistake to dismiss Hanslick's poetical fictions. Careful reading of Hanslick's language reveals patterns of which Hanslick's own general theory gives no indication. These pat- terns suggest an account of Hanslick's musical experience that differs sharply from his own self-conception. At several conspicuous points Hanslick describes music anthro- pomorphically, as though listening to music is like being in the pres- ence of another person or several interacting people. Discussing the importance of the "principal theme" of a composition, Hanslick likens the treatment of the theme to a process of reasoning. The theme, he writes, resembles approach can be exciting; this is clear from the discussion of Hanslick's relation to metaphysical writings in Carl Dahlhaus, The Idea of Absolute Music, transl. by Roger Lustig (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989). But my own interest is less in the historical Hanslick than in the present state of thought about music. To a remarkable degree, Hanslick's essay has a life of its own in current conceptions of the possibilities for musical aesthetics and music theory. In rereading this familiar text, I want to imply that the current view of Hanslick's essay arises, not just from historical ignorance, but from a kind of blindness to certain issues about music, perhaps even a willful blind- ness. I want to direct attention to words that we have been reading and, somehow, disregarding. If my interpretive suggestions are valuable, I expect they would provide a good starting point for a more historical investigation (in the course of which some of my suggestions would undoubtedly be revised or rejected).</page><page sequence="7">HANSLICK'S ANIMISM a logical axiom, the rightness of which we take in at a glance, but which needs to be challenged and expounded by our intelligence in order for us to see what happens in the musical development of it, analogously to a logical demonstration. (pp. 81-82) Hearing a piece is like sympathetically witnessing a process of argu- mentation. The description implies that a composition brings with it a sense of a thinking or arguing agency whose behavior the listener perceives. This agency might be identified with the composer, but perhaps Hanslick's lack of specificity registers an inarticulate sense of a persona, distinct from the actual composer.9 The passage continues by offering an alternative analogy: The composer puts the theme, like the principal character in a novel, into different situations and surroundings, in varying occurrences and moods. (p. 82) Here the sense of agency divides. Hanslick refers explicitly to the agency of the composer, who controls the general course of the music; the theme takes on a distinct animation, moving through a series of 279 adventures. Another passage offers a similar animation of harmony and melody. Hanslick denies that either factor is regularly more im- portant than the other, and explains: Neither the principle of subordination nor that of opposition applies to the essence of the relation of harmony to melody. Both can in one place pursue their own lines of development and in another place readily subordinate one to the other. (p. 34) Again, Hanslick attributes a story-like quality to music; in this case the characters are melody and harmony, rather than a main theme, and their interactions are not explicitly subordinated to the control of a composer. These descriptions depict music, not simply as patterned sound, or sound in motion, but as sound that is understood the way one understands other people, by attributing thoughts and by following a succession of responses to situations. Apparently the identification of 9 In mentioning the possibility of a "persona," I allude to Edward T. Cone, The Composer's Voice (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1974). For a discussion of Cone's book, including several critical responses to the notion of a persona, see the collection of papers "The Composer's Voice and Music Criticism," in College Music Sympo- sium XXIX (1989). Independently of Cone's work, Jerrold Levinson has also written about the persona of a musical composition; see Music, Art, and Metaphysics (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1990).</page><page sequence="8">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY agents or characters is shifty, not attaching permanently to any one aspect of the music. At one point, Hanslick acknowledges the role of psychological states in music and also implies that these states may be associated with something like a body: Thoughts and feelings run like blood in the arteries of the harmo- nious body of beautiful sounds. They are not that body; they are not perceivable; but they animate it. (p. 82) Hanslick's continuation implies that the composer is the bearer of these thoughts and feelings; however, there is some tension between this ascription and the cited passage, which seems to grant the com- position its own body, and thus an independent anthropomorphic role. Hovering around this passage, but not explicitly asserted, is the suggestion that hearing music is like being in the presence of a beau- tiful body. Such a figure carries the possibility of a sexual quality in musical experience, as though Hanslick recognizes that music can be 280 seductive. The mention of blood is surprisingly specific, but not unique in Hanslick's book: elsewhere he refers to "rhythm, the artery which carries life to music" (p. 28). Hanslick attempts to clarify the nature of musical beauty by com- paring music and arabesque. The comparison is placed prominently near the beginning of the chapter devoted to Hanslick's positive ac- count of musical beauty, and it deserves close attention. The analogy moves through three stages. First, Hanslick offers a description of the experience of viewing arabesque: We follow sweeping lines, here dipping gently, there boldly soaring, approaching and separating, corresponding curves large and small, seemingly incommensurable yet always well connected together, to every part a counterpart, a collection of small details but yet a whole. Though this passage is not explicitly about a beautiful body, Hans- lick's description is pervasively erotic: gentle dipping, approaching and separating, corresponding curves, and so on. This time the erot- icism does not directly involve a possible relation of the listener to the body of the music, but rather the relations of parts of the piece. Hanslick continues to a second stage of the analogy: Now let us think of an arabesque not dead and static, but coming into being in continuous self-formation before our eyes! How the</page><page sequence="9">HANSLICK'S ANIMISM lines, some robust and some delicate, pursue one another! How they ascend from a small curve to great heights and then sink back again, how they expand and contract and forever astonish the eye with their ingenious alternation of tension and repose! There before our eyes the image becomes grander and more sublime. Hanslick animates the lines of arabesque by regarding them as inter- acting characters. The analogy implies another way of identifying musical agents: now the characters whose behavior one follows are not themes, or harmony and melody, but interacting musical lines in a polyphonic texture. Again, the interweaving and pursuit of these lines is erotic. The "robust and delicate" lines (or, as one might trans- late, "thick and fine" lines) seem to follow a heterosexual model. Men- tion of a small curve that ascends to great heights, then sinks back, or of expansion and contraction, gives some physiological specificity to the eroticism. Hanslick concludes the comparison by adding a third element: Finally, let us think of this lively arabesque as the dynamic emanation of an artistic spirit who unceasingly pours the whole abundance of 281 his inventiveness into the arteries of this dynamism. Does this mental impression not come close to that of music? (p. 29) The artistic spirit may be the composer, though again Hanslick's lan- guage leaves open the possibility that he is describing a persona. The artistic spirit energizes the composition by pouring fluid into its ar- teries. Once again, the music has a circulatory system. The relation of the artistic spirit to the composition is ambiguous; it is not clear how distinct the composition is from its source. The allusion to a fluid that pours into the composition invites one to speculate about the relation in bodily terms. Perhaps the composer or persona fathers the com- position; or perhaps the composition is a fetus, nourished by the fluids it receives from the artistic spirit. But apparently the spirit and the composition share a circulatory system; perhaps the composition is a sort of limb. In fact, the most precise physiological analogue for the composition, as Hanslick has described it, is not a limb, but an erect penis which, like the composition, owes its condition to the fluid that engorges it; Hanslick's previous eroticized descriptions of inter- acting lines facilitate this association. (Having made the association, one can read of erection in the immediately preceding claim that the image "becomes grander and more sublime.") After the delicate in- teractions of sweeping lines, this final integration of the composition</page><page sequence="10">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY as the phallus of an "artistic spirit" may seem disappointingly reduc- tive, subordinating erotic interplay to a simple figure of unity and power. 1 A new account of Hanslick's musical experience On the basis of these passages, I suggest that Hanslick's experi- ence of music involves several elements that are not usually identified with his thought. Hanslick animates musical events, hearing themes, harmony, melody, and interacting lines as characters whose behavior a listener may follow. He also hears whole musical textures as ema- nating from a single controlling agency, sometimes identified with the composer. And his animism is sometimes eroticized, in its references to embodiment or in its descriptions of musical motion. There is an obvious objection to this interpretation. Hanslick's book has been read and reread by many philosophers and musicians, and it may seem implausible that all these readers have failed to notice important aspects of Hanslick's views. The response to this objection involves several points. (1) As I have indicated, Hanslick himself does not offer any clear generaliza- 282 tions about the anthropomorphic or erotic qualities of music. A read- ing that focuses on Hanslick's most explicit, literal generalizations can simply avoid the passages I have cited. (2) Relatedly, the inter- pretation depends on a willingness to linger over figurative language, even when the consequences are at odds with the author's explicit assertions. Aestheticians and music theorists have not typically culti- vated such readings, though they are familiar enough in psychoana- lytic or deconstructive literary criticism. I believe such an approach can lead to many important insights; musical scholars should explore such readings, across a wide range of texts about music."l (3) It is easier to single out aspects of Hanslick's writing as evidence of a distinctive form of musical experience when more substantial ac- counts of related forms of experience are available. It is easier to identify his animism after reading Edward T. Cone's book The Com- poser's Voice and recent writings on dramatic or narrative qualities of music.l2 It is easier to recognize the inexplicit sexuality in his descrip- 10 I do not mean to deny that one might find the progression exciting, a sort of male striptease. " I have been involved in such work for years. Among other writers working along these lines, I have been especially impressed by Suzanne Cusick, Marion Guck, Sanna Pederson, and Robert Snarrenberg. 12 A short list of excellent studies in this area would include the following: James Webster, "Brahms's Tragic Overture: the Form of Tragedy," in Robert Pascall, ed., Brahms: Historical, Documentary, and Analytical Studies (Cambridge: Cambridge Univer- sity Press, 1983); Anthony Newcomb, "Once More 'Between Absolute and Program</page><page sequence="11">HANSLICK'S ANIMISM tions after reading recent discussions of music, gender, and sexu- ality. 3 Hanslick's suppression of eroticism The erotic qualities of Hanslick's descriptions bear a complex relation to his attacks on feeling-based theories of musical beauty. Though his negative arguments explicitly address issues about emo- tion, they often drift, inexplicitly, toward issues connected to gender and sexuality. Hanslick distinguishes two broad claims about the relation of feel- ing to musical beauty, meanwhile complaining that the advocates of these views do not distinguish them clearly. Indeed, there are many matters about which, as he puts it, previous writers on aesthetics "leave us entirely in the dark" (p. 3). (Here Hanslick's own language makes contact with Kivy's figure of a beacon.) Hanslick continues: However, when we allow our eyes to adjust a little, we arrive at the discovery that in the prevailing view of music the feelings play a double role. Of music in the first of these two roles, it is claimed that to arouse the delicate feelings is the defining purpose of music. In the 283 second, the feelings are designated as the content of music, that which musical art presents in its works. The two are similar in that both are false (p. 3). Hanslick already associates a twinge of sexual disgust with these claims about music and feeling through his strange scenario of dis- covering the two claims in the dark, licentiously mingled, and this accurately forecasts an element of sexual uneasiness in his discussion of music and feeling. Having separated the two claims, Hanslick argues against them in different ways. To the claim that feelings are the content of music, he replies that music is incapable of representing feelings. To the claim that the purpose of music is to arouse feelings, he replies that music Music': Schumann's Second Symphony" (19th Centurv Music VII/3 [Spring 1984]); New- comb, "Schumann and Late Eighteenth-Century Narrative Strategies" (19th Century Music XI/2 [Fall 1987]); Leo Treitler, "Mozart and the Idea of Absolute Music," in Music and the Historical Imagination (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1989). I discuss issues arising from these essays and others in "Music as Narrative" (In- diana Theory Review XII [1991]). In my interpretations of Hanslick, I often emphasize musical agency and its indeterminacies, as I did in "Music as Drama" (Music Theory Spectrum X [1988]). '3 See, for instance, the essays in Susan McClary, Feminine Endings (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1990); or Lawrence Kramer, "Musical Form and Fin- de-siecle Sexuality," in Music as Cultural Practice, 1800-1900 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 199o).</page><page sequence="12">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY can indeed arouse feelings, but this arousal has nothing to do with musical beauty. Further, Hanslick argues that strong emotional re- sponse to music is incompatible with the attentive contemplation that is required for appropriate musical experience. These arguments, in Hanslick's treatment, become involved with issues of gender and sexuality. For Hanslick, beauty is inseparable from determinacy. He writes that every artistic activity consists in individualizing, in impressing the specific upon the unspecific, the particular upon the universal. (p. 21) Though music is hard to describe, Hanslick insists that a beautiful composition is something definite and precise. His arguments that music cannot represent feelings depend on this claim about the de- terminacy of aesthetically relevant musical qualities. In the course of his arguments, Hanslick cites various emotions. It is conspicuous that the emotion he mentions most frequently is love; again and again, he argues in various ways that music is incapable of distinguishing love 284 from other emotions such as anger or yearning (pp. 8-19). The in- tention of these arguments is to deny music a certain capacity of erotic representation. But they can also be read as an inexplicit response to the diffuseness or imprecision of erotic qualities in music. The sug- gestion would be that Hanslick is aware of, and disturbed by, the diffuse sensuality of music; therefore, he argues that it does not exist by shifting the topic slightly, to love rather than sexuality, and impos- ing strict conditions of determinacy on the representation of love. Similarly, in arguing against the relevance of programmatic content, Hanslick asserts that programmatic music cannot even specify the gender of its protagonist. He writes that "it would be conceivable that Beethoven's 'Egmont' overture could be titled 'William Tell' or 'Jeanne d'Arc'" (p. 75). Discussing the possibility of a musical depic- tion of Orestes, he claims that a composer can only produce "musical forms which could easily signify a woman instead of a young man, pursued by bailiffs instead of Furies" (p. 79). Though these passages explicitly deny the power of music to represent a determinate person, one can also read in them a worried response to a combination of sensuality and indeterminate gender in animistic perception of music. (Perhaps the "woman pursued by bailiffs" is a prostitute; this image would associate the indeterminacy of musical representation with sex- ual promiscuity.) Hanslick's arguments against the aesthetic relevance of emotional reactions to music depend heavily on a distinction between mental</page><page sequence="13">HANSLICK S ANIMISM and bodily responses to music, identified with a distinction between activity and passivity. Hanslick grants music considerable power over the feelings of listeners, but he regards this as a physical phenome- non, an effect of sheer sound, and he considers susceptibility to these effects a sign of weakness. Hanslick writes of listeners who "in passive receptivity allow the elemental in music to work upon them" (p. 58). He elaborates the description: Slouched dozing in their chairs, these enthusiasts allow themselves to brood and sway in response to the vibrations of tones, instead of contemplating tones attentively. (p. 59) Hanslick emphasizes the bodily impact of sound, and in these descrip- tions the passive response to music takes on sexual qualities. He writes of "the impression which certain chords, timbres, and melodies make upon the whole human organism" (p. 51), and describes music as an "amorphous demonic power, as it acts on the nerves of our whole body" (p. 50). And he depicts music as a penetrating force: 285 For one who has to hear or make music while in a distressingly 2 agitated mood, music throbs like vinegar in an open wound. (p. 5o) Anecdotal material about Goethe allows Hanslick to link such musical experiences to love: When Goethe at a great age came to know once again the power of love, there awakened in him at the same time a susceptibility to music such as he had never known. But, Hanslick notes, Goethe was "too perceptive not to recognize the large component of nervous agitation in this manifestation," and Goethe sensibly wished for a cure from the condition (p. 50). Hanslick singles out several groups, including young people (p. 54), savages (p. 61), ancient Greeks (pp. 62-63), and modern Italians (p. 64) as particularly vulnerable to such passive responses. Among the adults of his own society, he singles out women: Anyone who glances around a bit at the opera will soon notice how, with lively accessible melodies, the ladies automatically nod their heads this way and that, but never with an adagio, however moving or melodic. (p. 54) He identifies a woman, Bettina, as the author of "the most instructive examples" of confused, enthusiastic descriptions of music:</page><page sequence="14">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY With the pretension of speaking about music itself, she instead goes on about the obscure influence it has upon her feelings. (p. 67) Relatedly, he offers to explain "why women, who are by nature pre- eminently dependent upon feeling, have not amounted to much as composers." The explanation is that composition demands renunciation of subjectivity ... it is not feeling which com- poses music, but the specifically musical, artistically trained talent. (p. 46) In Hanslick's view, men are more capable of the attentive, active role that is required for composition or for proper musical experience. Hanslick's discussions of the effects of music contain some of the most vehement writing in his book. An extreme example is his strongly worded condemnation of listeners whose emotional arousal affects their behavior, for instance by moving them to dance or to forgive their debtors: 286 To undergo unmotivated, aimless and casual emotional disturbances through a power that is not en rapport with our willing and thinking is unworthy of the human spirit. When people surrender themselves so completely to the elemental in an art that they are not in control of themselves, then it seems to us that this is not to the credit of that art and is still less to the credit of those people. (p. 61) Evidently Hanslick regards the image of passive, bodily response to sound, linked in his thought to the primitive, the southern European, and the feminine, with considerable abhorrence. Perhaps the vehe- mence of his attack on emotional or bodily responses to music is related to Hanslick's own eroticized descriptions of music. That is, Hanslick is ambivalent about his own sense of the musical composition as a harmonious body of beautiful sounds, his own experience of musical lines dipping gently, approaching and separating, expanding and contracting. To resolve the ambivalence, he adopts crude dichot- omies between mind and body, activity and passivity, that allow him to place eroticized responses to music on the negative side.l4 Thus, he can disavow any sensuality in his own musical responses by issuing a 14 Hanslick did not have to invent this system of linked dichotomies, which, as many feminists have pointed out, is readily available to Europeans.

Here is a description of the pleasure of active listening: It is a splendid and significant thing to follow the creative spirit as it magically opens up before us a new world of elements, coaxes them into all imaginable relationships with one another, and thus builds up, demolishes, produces, and destroys, controlling the entire wealth of a domain which elevates the ear into the subtlest and most highly developed of the sense organs.... Thus to take pleasure in one's own mental alertness is the worthiest, the wholesomest, and not the easiest means of listening to music. (p. 64) 287 To listen actively is to identify with the omnipotent force that shapes the material of a piece. The sounds of a composition are the passive material across which the creative spirit and the listener share a sense of control and power. Recognition of the creative spirit's power ele- vates or empowers the ear. In enjoying the total control exerted over the world of musical elements, one also enjoys one's own mental alert- ness. The bond between creative spirit (composer or persona) and listener is like the homosocial bond between men, constructed as iden- tification rather than desire, based on shared recognition of their desire for and control over women.l6 Hanslick's account of active listening creates a comfortably masculine position for the listener. Music and mother nature A different pattern, less directly related to the experience of a listener, can confirm the importance of masculinity in Hanslick's 15 The German has a zestful, punitive beat: "ein Hangen und Bangen in klingen- dem Nichts." i6 For subtle exploration of this configuration, see Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Be- tween Men (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985). My comments bring the passage in contact with the gender thematics of this paper. The passage is also, more obviously, about imperialism.

In a chapter on "The Relation of Music to Nature," Hanslick argues that music owes little to natural sources, and must be regarded as cultural in origin. At the beginning of the chapter, he casts the topic in a maternal figure. The arts, he writes, can receive physical material or representational content from nature and, he continues, In both, nature is related to the arts as a motherly dispenser of the first and most important dowry. In the interest of musical aesthetics, we must now reexamine this endowment and look into what wise na- ture (the more munificent for being wise) has done for music. (p. 68) This sounds pious. But, as Hanslick immediately explains, nature has done little for music; it provides raw materials from which one can construct instruments, and that is all. "We receive from mother na- ture only material for material" (p. 68). Music is not much indebted to a mother; Hanslick's praise of nature's maternal munificence turns out to be sarcasm. Here one might recall psychoanalytic claims about the relation of boys and mothers, for instance, Nancy Chodorow's arguments that 288 boys are more likely [than girls] to have been pushed out of the preoedipal relationship, and to have had to curtail their primary love and sense of empathic tie with their mother. A boy has engaged, and has been required to engage, in a more emphatic individuation and a more defensive firming of experienced ego boundaries.'7 One can sense, in Hanslick's figuration of music as independent from a maternal nature, a masculine pride in this firmly individuated art. A violent encounter As I mentioned, there is one passage of musical analysis in Hans- lick's book. The analysis appears in the second chapter, which con- tains Hanslick's arguments that music is incapable of representing feeling. After presenting a general argument, based on a claim about the nature of emotion, Hanslick changes course, suggesting that a reader who is not convinced by the general argument can explore the issue by considering a particular musical example. Hanslick intro- duces the analysis: 17 Nancy Chodorow, The Reproduction of Mothering (Berkeley: University of Cali- fornia Press, 1978), pp. 166-67.</page><page sequence="17">HANSLICK'S ANIMISM Let anyone whose heartstrings are made to resonate by a piece of instrumental music try to demonstrate with plain arguments what affect constitutes its content. The test is essential. (p. 12) Hanslick then comments on a few measures from Beethoven's "Prometheus" Overture. (Example i reproduces Hanslick's musical example.) The analysis focusses on the interaction of rhythm and contour, and the symmetries that a listener will encounter. Having finished the analysis, Hanslick states its result: Beyond this [that is, the structure that he has described] we cannot by any means discern any further content in the theme or, at any rate, anything we might call a feeling which it represents or must arouse in the hearer. Such an analysis, of course, makes a skeleton out of a flourishing organism; it is apt to destroy all beauty but also at the same time all misguided interpreting. (p. 14) Payzant's words "analysis" and "organism" translate Hanslick's words "Zergliederung" and "K6rper"; "dissection" and "body" would be more precise. "Admittedly, such a dissection turns a flourishing body 289 into a skeleton." The violence of this remark comes along with a strange failure of logic. Hanslick takes himself to be demonstrating that the beauty of the passage has nothing to do with feeling by providing an exhaustive account of the content of the music. But his own description, he acknowledges, destroys the beauty of the music. Hanslick's opponent might not be impressed by this test.l8 '8 There is another failure of logic. Dissection does not kill. This figurative ambiguity-has Hanslick killed the piece or just taken apart what was already dead?- translates the literal uncertainty about whether or not the description has left out something of crucial importance. There is more to say, in general, about dissection as a recurring figure of analysis, and much more could be made, in that context, of Hanslick's figure of dissection. Ian Bent has done some work in this area. Discussions of death, corpses, and dissection-roughly speaking, as figures for textuality, language, or representation-have been conspicuous in recent literary the- ory. See, for instance, Maurice Blanchot, "Two Versions of the Imaginary" (in The Gaze of Orpheus, transl. by Lydia Davis [Barrytown: Station Hill, 1983], pp. 78-89); Paul de Man, "Autobiography as De-Facement" (in The Rhetoric of Romanticism [New York: Columbia University Press, 1984], pp. 67-81) and "'Conclusions': Walter Benjamin's 'The Task of the Translator'" (in The Resistance to Theory [Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1986], pp. 73-105).

But that is not what he writes. Hanslick writes as though his analysis has harmed the music, and this violence that distorts a simple point invites interpretation. In Hanslick's remark one can read that the beauty of the music is linked to the image of a flourishing body, and that he does not permit himself to include this body in his de- scription, and that this omission damages, even kills, the music. The language of Hanslick's analysis, it turns out, is not purely technical. Here is the beginning of his description: The tones of the first bar, following a descent of a fourth, sprinkle quickly and softly upward, repeating exactly in the second. The third and fourth bars carry the same upward motion further. The drops propelled by the fountain come rippling down so they may in the next four bars carry out the same figure and the same configu- ration. (p. 12) Viol. 2 Viola Bassi 290 ( t-r I! Ar-- IF A- I J I IX I X - I IX - II</page><page sequence="19">HANSLICK'S ANIMISM Rather than describing a beautiful body, Hanslick describes a ma- chine (or, perhaps, an inanimate natural phenomenon). In the de- scription of a fountain, one might sense the suppression of specific bodily imagery-the throbbing of a circulatory system, or ejaculation. A similar substitution appears after Hanslick's eroticized description of a living arabesque; he moves immediately to an analogy between music and a kaleidoscope, which, he admits, is "no more than a me- chanically ingenious plaything" (p. 29). In both passages, the mechan- ical replaces and suppresses the bodily.9l Incidentally, Hanslick must have written the musical example from memory, since he misquotes the music; the analysis describes his own incorrect version. In Beethoven's version, there are two chords in the third and seventh measures, not in the fourth and eighth. This timing creates a strong drive to the top of each melodic gesture; Hanslick's version diminishes the energy of the passage, introducing a coarsely emphatic articulation of the paired four-measure units. Hanslick's notation, like his description, removes the vigorous anima- tion of the music, mechanizes the music. What contemporary musical aesthetics and musical anal- 291 ysis can learn from Hanslick I began by citing testimonies to Hanslick's eminence in musical aesthetics and his ideological and historical relation to music theory and analysis. Hanslick's influence, as I noted, has derived from three aspects of his book: its specific arguments, especially concerning mu- sic and emotion; its general conception of musical aesthetics in terms of the opposition between feeling and specifically musical beauty; and its articulation of a positive theory of musical beauty that seems to create an important role for music theory and musical analysis. If my interpretations of Hanslick's book are correct, there is something else to learn from it: from Hanslick, we can learn that a preoccupation with the dichotomy between emotion and purely mu- sical structure, or a preoccupation with mechanistic musical analysis, may prevent contemporary aestheticians and theorists from confront- ing important aspects of musical experience, may even serve as a way of evading these aspects. Perhaps, rather than continuing to cite Hanslick as the proponent of a "permanently possible position" on 19 Hanslick writes that the excerpt from the "Prometheus" Overture is a "ran- domly selected passage" (p. 14). But the story of Prometheus provides an apt allegory of Hanslick's analysis, and one may speculate that this affected Hanslick's choice. Prometheus stole fire from the gods; as punishment, he was chained to a rock, where an eagle attacked his liver daily. Hanslick plays the eagle, grimly mutilating the music as punishment for its claims to animation and warmth.</page><page sequence="20">THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY music, we should begin to think of Hanslick as a particularly gripping, even alarming example of the discrepancy that can develop between musical experience and theoretical formulations about music. And perhaps, rather than continuing to elaborate or debate Hanslick's most explicit formulations, we can benefit from Hanslick's example by exploring, directly, the issues that Hanslick's Essay broaches and also denies: the animistic and erotic qualities that listeners find in music.20 University of Virginia 20 One should not expect that an exploration of music and sexuality will repro- duce Hanslick's crude alternatives of feminine passivity and masculine power. Suzanne Cusick has shown this in a dazzling paper "On a Lesbian Relationship with Music: A Serious Attempt Not to Think Straight" (forthcoming in Philip Brett, Gary Watson, and Elizabeth Wood, eds., Queering the Pitch [New York: Routledge, 1993]): she asks what happens when music is treated as a lover or a beloved, and offers a sensitive account of complex interactions of pleasure, intimacy, and power. 292</page></plain_text>
