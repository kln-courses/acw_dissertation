(The Form of the Personal, Vol. I.) $3.75. The Self as Agent will be followed by a second volume: Persons In Relation. Together they constitute the Gifford Lectures which John Macmurray delivered in 1953-54 at the University of Glasgow under the title "The Form of the Personal." Study of both vol- umes will be required for adequate understanding of the impact of the "pioneering venture" which, as Professor Macmurray him- self says, is more selective than systematic. But such study will be rewarded by a challenging, imaginative, and suggestive orienta- tion to persistent metaphysical issues. Our philosophical tradition has suffered, Macmurray contends, because philosophers have failed to realize that "all our primary knowledge, arises as an aspect of activities which have practical, not theoretical objectives: and that it is this knowledge, itself an aspect of action, to which all reflective theory must refer" (p. 13). As long as the "I think," or theoretical activity, was given priority,</page><page sequence="2">420 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the self became an isolated subject for whom the world was an Other to be known. From this basic dualism there followed other disastrous dual- isms: mind-body, fact-value, and human action unsupported by a cosmic unity of intention and action. Logical Positivism is the development of this same fission on the theoretical, "objective," side and Sartreian existentialism is the antithetic revolt against the primacy of the intellect. Only if the knowing subject can be seen as an important but not primary phase of the agent self, or person, can comprehensive truth be discovered in philosophy. Professor Macmurray seeks to substantiate the thesis: "All mean- ingful knowledge is for the sake of action, and all meaningful action for the sake of friendship" (p. 16). Whether this thesis be correct or not, Macmurray's conception of the philosophical quest is clear: "How can we know what we should do?" (p. 24). And, if he is to answer this question, the phi- losopher must seek both theoretical consistency and a "comprehen- sive adequacy. " This means that the philosophical hypothesis proposed will include a way of life which, when acted upon, will be more satisfactory than any other alternative. To begin with, for Macmurray the underlying certainty given to all of us is not the cogito, or "I think," but the "I do." It may help to focus part of the issue before us if we stop right here to note what Macmurray and many others always seem to overlook, that when Descartes in the "Second Meditation" asked: "But what am I ?" he did not reply simply with "A thing which thinks." He went on to define a thing which thinks as "a thing which doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, which does imagine and feels" (italics mine). His criterion of truth was indeed rationalistic, but his definition of the "subject" was not merely as subject-knower, but as willer . Indeed, it is resistance to his will which, on Descartes' view, leads the subject to suspect that he is not the only being in the world but is in some sort of interaction with the source of his "adventitious" ideas. True, Descartes introduced a dualism of mind-body and thought-exten- sion, but he had his reasons, and they included analysis of his experience of ideas and volitions, which would indeed differ from Macmurray's, as we shall now see. Companion to his contention that the self is essentially will, is the conviction that the experience of will would be illusory if it did not make a difference to the equally real world. This means that initially we know for a certainty not only that there is a real Other but that it is to some degree indeterminate. Only if will is certain can we know that the Other exists to be modified to</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 421 some degree by will. The will thus becomes our introduction to a public world, for thinking is "inherently private" (pp. 71, 73) and "the contrary of action. However far we carry the process of thought it can never become an action or spontaneously generate an action" (p. 73). A philosophy, therefore, which gives think- ing primacy never can legitimately make of other persons, the world, or God more than an object of thought. It may be doubted, as hinted, that the critique of Descartes, or even the suggestive exposition of Kant's philosophy as a whole, which Macmurray gives as a background to his whole study, are sufficiently analytic; it may be doubted that the thinking of these philosophers necessarily led to the kind of dualism they expounded and to the formal dualism of theory and practice suggested by Macmurray, but one can well see why, given his conclusion about them and others of similar persuasion, Macmurray is now con- cerned to make a new start. For anyone convinced (a) that what- ever existence is, it must be independent of thought, and (b) that action is such that it cannot be thinking, has indeed ground for working to eliminate such dreadful dualisms. The alternative, then, is to begin with the Self or Agent, in which action and thought are contrasting modes of activity but not equal in status (p. 86). "When we act, sense perception and judgment are in continuous activity, along with continuous move- ment" (p. 86). Action is never intellectually blind, and the self in full action is the self employing all of its capacities. The self in thought, however, is the self withdrawing from total activity into one kind of activity, reflection. Action is inclusive; it is ultimately characterized by "right and wrong" and not simply the "true or false" which characterizes intellectual activity (p. 89). To summarize: "I do, and to know that I do, are two aspects of one and the same experience. This knowledge is absolute and necessary. It is not, however, knowledge of an object but what we call 'knowledge in action' " (p. 91). Now, one might be willing to grant that thinking is one neces- sary aspect of a larger dynamic unity, and one might also grant that the self as agent acts in the same world which it as subject knows. But why this gets us out of a mind-body dualism, except by fiat, is hard to see! So far as I can discover Macmurray simply tells us that the self as agent is a self that includes a body and interacts with a physical world. Later we are told that "my consciousness . . . does not accompany but is integrated with my bodily movements and is a part-determinant of them" (p. 118). No phenomenological or other analysis is given to show why "will" and "resistance" positively do involve the certainty that the Other</page><page sequence="4">422 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY is a specific kind of ontological Being, or why body even probably is non-mental. The best Macmurray can say is that no proof can be given without reverting to the primacy of the theoretical, the very view which his hypothesis is challenging. Macmurray is, of course, aware that the conception of an agent self which incorporates both the "body" and the "mind," both the doer and the subject self, will need careful exposition. He does indicate why this relation of mind-body cannot be expressed in terms of models patterned after mathematical, dialectical, or organic unity. His own view is that we can adequately avoid the distortions of these models only if we ascend to the unity of the personal, which means that doer-thinker constitute a unity in which the thinker is the "self-negation" of the doer. The kind of unity he has in mind is best suggested by the moral struggle in which different elements of our nature are in competition with each other and yet could not be in competition unless they were phases of an indivisible whole. The whole he appeals to is a whole of action of which the theoretical is a focus. When we know the world we know it "primarily as an aspect of our action in the world . . . (p. 101) ; "primary knowledge is the knowledge that arises in action, apart from theoretical intention " (p. 101). In the remaining half of this book Macmurray suggests the consequences which this general orientation to philosophical prob- lems might well have for interpreting our experiences of percep- tion, reflection, causality, and value. Since this review cannot begin to do justice to the suggestiveness of Macmurray's reflections on the nature of time, space, movement, causality, natural law, theory of knowledge, and value, it will be limited to his theory of perception. Tactual, rather than visual, experience is the paradigm of per- ception in Macmurray's view. For it is here that a doer experi- ences resistance most clearly. Resistance is not a sense-datum, though a sense-datum may be involved, but a practical experience in which some " doing " of the person is at least momentarily frustrated. "Tactual perception, as the experience of resistance, is the direct and immediate apprehension of the other-than-myself " (p. 109). At the same time, the experience of resistance alone does not tell us what the Other is. This practical opposition of self and Other is the awareness of both as correlatives negating each other. If the opposition of self and Other were essentially a-theoretical, rather than a practical one, "the distinction would fall within the self and be purely logical" (p. 109). In other words, for Macmurray, the experience of resistance becomes the basic ground for asserting inter-acting co-existence</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 423 between self and Other, and in this interaction the Other is seen to be the very condition and continuing support of action. The fundamental "epistemological" situation, once more, is not that in which brute sense-data lead one to infer an Other in some way characterized by them, but it is a practical experience in which resistance directly reveals the Other which then may be further discriminated in terms of tactual data. Furthermore, since the experience of resistance does not immediately give me "the Other doer," I can understand the Other only mediately by analogy with, or in contrast to, myself. And this means that all knowledge is necessarily "anthropomorphic in the sense that whatever charac- teristics we attribute to the Other must be included in the full characterization of ourselves" (p. 117). On what grounds then do we discriminate the organic and the material world? On the ground that a difference in our personal behavior is demanded by the forms of their resistance, and of their support, and that "organic" and "material" are abstract dimen- sions from the inclusive category of the personal. Indeed, on fuller and final analysis, Macmurray finds that since the Other gives a kind of resistance and support which makes personal action pos- sible both now and in the predictable future, he decides that the world is one action informed by the unifying intention of a cosmic Agent. The other dimensions of experience, time, space, move- ment, causality, and law, are finally interpreted as abstract phases of such practical interaction of agents with a more ultimate Agency. Criticism must indeed be cautious when one confronts a per- spective which is presented frankly as tentative and incomplete. But some points for further clarification and argument may be profitably suggested. First, it never becomes clear why the pri- macy of the practical (doing) over the theoretical (thinking) in- volves one in the definition of the personal as a unity, however conceived, of "mind" and "body." What exactly do these dimen- sions entail "under " the personal? What gives "doing'" unity and continuity? Are we to define mental and physical in tradi- tional or contemporary terms? Second, as already hinted, if the experience of resistance is the basis for awareness of Other, it is at least open to doubt that this Other must be "body," or the particular kind of non-mental ordi- narily called "physical." To use tactual experience as the para- digm of perceptual knowledge of the Other is already to assume that the differences between visual and tactual qualities are prop- erly and best defined in physiological or physical terms. A different form of this same concern may be expressed by</page><page sequence="6">424 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY noting, thirdly, how Macmurray concludes, from the experience of resistance, that the Other is "organic" and "material." Surely resistance is discovered in experience between minds with different and obdurate convictions. How, then, can one be so sure that practical resistance yields the non-mental Other? And if the per- sonal is used to define the dimensions "organic" and "material" in the Other, does this presuppose a given meaning for them in the person? In any case, what is the argument defining the per- sonal as a unity of mental-organic-physical? In other words, Macmurray seems to feel that because the dual- ism of Descartes and Kant will not work, we are justified in making a first postulate which unifies these different dimensions of the world as somehow already known. To repeat, from the primacy of the practical (as will or doing), on what grounds does it even probably follow that resistance presupposes the kind of action in which thinking and body (or time and space as he later interprets them) are unified? Fourth, one may ask further whether the experience of resist- ance by itself is adequate justification for belief in an Other inde- pendent of oneself. Even Descartes and Berkeley, let alone other idealists, realized that while the experience of resistance was a basic evidence for inferring an Other, this experience alone, with- out systematic connection with other experiences, did not suffice to distinguish between the order of dreams, the orders of the existenit, and the order of the real. Fifth, while Macmurray also needs to render less ambiguous his criterion of truth, it is paramount that he indicate how we would be able to account for error on his view, both in the area of natural and of valuational knowledge. Sixth, MIacmurray maintains that the intellectual can never pass into action, for it is restricted to clarifying the range of possi- bilities for action. But, if this is so, can the intellect really g,uide action or must it simply "rationalize" the practical activities which must forever on this view be regnant? It may be that the attempt to close the door to sceptic-producing dualisms by making the practical primary, will in fact open the door to the worst of all seepticisms, the enslavement of intellectual function to activity. For while Macmurray does say that theoretical activity guides response (p. 180), does his theory, which subordinates it to the practical, allow it sufficient freedom to live and guide by its own rules ?
