American naturalists all agree that traditional theism, with its belief in a supernatural personal god who is absolutely transcendent to nature, is inconsistent with the view that nature is all that there is. Yet despite the rejection of the traditional God of theism, some naturalists have found pantheism, with its belief in a divinity thoroughly immanent to nature, congenial. Nonetheless, no philosophically rigorous and systematic juxtaposition of the metaphysical and ethical commitments of pantheism with those of naturalism has been undertaken. This essay seeks to fill that gap by investigating the viability of pantheism from the perspective of the ordinal naturalism of Justus Buchler. Several reasons can be adduced for the choice of Buchler's ordinal naturalism. First, Buchler's ordinal naturalism is in my estimation the most philosophically austere presentation of the natu ralistic position. Because Buchler's ordinal naturalism is unrelenting in its defense of the naturalistic position that whatever is, in whatever way it is, is in and of nature, his form of naturalism is ideally suited for making explicit the claims of naturalism in relation to pantheism. Second, the ethical com mitments of Buchler's ordinal naturalism are ostensibly strikingly similar to those of pantheism, largely due to Buchler's defense of ontological parity as the cornerstone of ordinal naturalism. A critical examination of pantheism from the perspective of Buchler's ordinal naturalism will reveal that despite prima facie evidence showing metaphysical and ethical commitments common to both, naturalists are not justified in em bracing pantheism. The theistic implication of pantheism that the pantheistic divinity is of ontologically superior value categorically bars the naturalist from accepting the pantheistic divinity. To familiarize the reader with Buchler's ordinal naturalism, this essay opens with a brief overview of what American naturalists hold, followed by an exposition of Buchler's ordinal naturalism, at the conclusion of which some remarks are offered on what Buchler means by the divine. Once Buchler's position has been clarified, the essay then unearths the latent assumptions 1.1 am greatly indebted to Robert Corrington, Professor of Philosophical Theology at Drew University, for his guidance in the writing of this article.

The chief problem of pantheism with respect to naturalism is that although panthe ism appears to collapse the ontological distinction between nature and the divine, the pantheist still holds nature or the natural to be inferior in certain respects. This simultaneous bolstering and undermining of nature reveals an unresolved contradiction within pantheism about the status of nature in connection with the divine or the sacred. Buchler's form of naturalism does not accept the presence of such a contradiction. For Buchler, whatever the divine or the sacred may be, it is undeniably an order of nature, not nature as a whole, nor some aspect of nature that unifies or permeates all of nature, as pantheists are wont to argue. Justus Buchler on Nature, Religion, and Ethics Writing in the mid-twentieth century, the American philosopher John Herman Randall, Jr., encapsulates the uniqueness of American naturalism by stating that naturalism "can be defined negatively as the refusal to take "nature" or "the natural" as a term of distinction.... It is opposed to all dualisms between Nature and another realm of being."2 Naturalism can therefore be defined in part by what it opposes and excludes, namely, foundational and reductionistic thought. Whereas the traditional idealist desires circularity, closure, unity, har mony, and purpose, and believes that these traits permeate and undergird the whole, the naturalist jettisons the conception of a totality and its interconnec tions, embracing in its stead the parts and the differences between and among them, and accepts that such things may be disconnected from one another. The naturalist seems to be immersed in the flow and flux of things?in medias res is precisely where the naturalist dwells; this is chiefly due to the naturalist's acceptance of the brute fact of existence, for which no explanation can be given that can account for its being there. For this reason, the naturalist does not desire to have a vision of the truly real, the really real, the ultimately real, or the archetypal thing. Absolute foundations appear to be anathema to the naturalist. For the naturalist, nothing lies behind, beyond, above, or below nature as its justification. In sum, we can say that the naturalist's vision is not synoptic, catholic, all-encompassing or far-reaching. The naturalist's worldview takes into account what William James calls in the lectures on radical plural ism the "each-form," rather than the "all-form" revered by the monist, and by extension the idealist. For the naturalist, nature is therefore not a symbol, 2. John Herman Randall, Jr., "Epilogue: The Nature of Naturalism," in Naturalism and the Human Spirit, ed. Yervant H. Krikorian (New York: Columbia University Press, 1944), 357.</page><page sequence="3">158 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy an imitation, or an emanation pointing to some mysterious origin other than itself. Let us now turn from this general description of naturalism to Buchler's unique form of naturalism. In an article on religious naturalism, Ursula Goodenough argues that the core message of naturalism can be encapsulated by the attitude of mindful ness found in Buddhism.3 This attitude resembles a kind of phenomenological bracketing of the prejudices and presuppositions that hinder seeing each thing in its complexity, particularity, and uniqueness. Mindfulness is a path and a way of being in the world that reminds us that the manner of seeing the world is far more valuable than the possession of it. In my estimation, Buchler's naturalism is also advocating a way of doing metaphysics, a way of philosophizing about nature that practices mindfulness. For me, mindfulness is nothing other than the virtue of charity, a state of mind that exhibits restraint, leniency, and forbearance for whatever is encountered, in whatever way it is encountered. Charity limits the ego's reach, keeps it at bay, and checks its desire to dominate and devour whatever it happens to encounter. Buchler's designation for what I have labeled the virtue of charity is the "sense of encompassment." The following pivotal statements by Buchler starkly render the sense of encompassment in terms of the human process: "Man is born in a state of natural debt. ... From first to last he discharges obligations."4 The recognition of the state of natural debt is designed to undermine what Buchler calls the "metaphysics of egocentrism" that puts forward the view of an ego utterly estranged from nature. Lacking in natural indebtedness, the egocentric metaphysics is convinced of the absolute value and finality of its categorial framework. However, for Buchler, the categorial frame work constructed by any metaphysician cannot but be in a state of natural debt, for it is one of an indefinite number of ways of exhibiting nature's traits. In other words, recognition of natural indebtedness breeds the virtue of charity within one's metaphysics. In Buchler's metaphysics, the virtue of charity takes the form of a radical naturalism that is ordinal; its purpose is not to dominate or devour nature, but rather, in the words of the Buchler scholar Beth J. Singer, to exhibit a "radically complex and pluralistic" nature.5 According to Buchler, philosophy has been considered chiefly an assertive affair concerned with telling. A distin guishing mark of Buchler's philosophy is its keen awareness of another equally valuable dimension of philosophy, namely, its artistic or exhibitive dimension. 3.

For Buchler, therefore, how my philosophy is portrayed is no less important than what it says. In sum, Buchler's way of philosophizing is commendably peaceful, gentle, and humble. And his metaphysics, to which we advert now, eminently exhibits these characteristics through the virtue of charity. Buchler's metaphysics is through and through ordinal; it is the view that what ever is encountered, in whatever way it is encountered, is an inclusive complex of relations?an order?that is itself included within other complexes of relations or orders. An order is the location of something within the world from a certain perspective; thus, every order is related to some other order, but not to every other order. Clearly since an order is defined by a unique set of relations and every order is a subaltern complex of some other order, ordinality precludes the existence of ultimate simples having no relation to anything whatsoever. For Buchler, ordinality as metaphysical complexity "implies the likelihood of access, and this means continuing experience and query. ... The traits of any complex can never be regarded as fully and finally ascertained or completely circumscribed. A complex, if it is accessible at all, is analyzable and interpretable without end; . . . , is manipulatable in an indefinite number of orders."6 We have here the virtue of charity with respect to whatever is encountered. Ordinal naturalism is not in the business of privileging one complex of relations over another with the honorific appellations absolute and ultimate, thereby reifying such a complex to the point of removing it from its relations and locations. Traditional idealistic philosophies touting static, foundational realities usually require the positing of a mysterious inner vision, an esoteric seeing with the mind's eye, or an a priori apprehension of innate ideas. What usually ensues is the whitewashing of the complexity of nature, a draping of the mysteriously accessed categories upon whatever is experienced, with the intent of smoothing out its rough edges, erasing its differences and relations to suit the preexisting categories. Whereas this kind of traditional idealism has the consequence of forestalling further query, understood as the indefinite discrimination of what ever is encountered, ordinal naturalism ramifies query, or as Buchler puts the matter, "Query, by its products, multiplies the complexes of nature."7 Indefinite query or infinite probing of nature's orders is only possible because, as Stephen David Ross has argued,8 nature itself is inexhaustible for Buchler; 6.

Stephen David Ross, "The Inexhaustibility of Nature," The Journal of Value Inquiry 1 (1973): 241-53.</page><page sequence="5">160 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy nature is not a container of all containers or an order of all orders; it lacks a definite circumference and definable limits. Buchler describes nature as the availability of orders, as the provision of orders. Nature itself is not an ultimate category. Indeed, Buchler's definition of nature is not a definition of nature as such, which cannot be given; rather, it is a definition that adverts to the fecun dity of nature, the "sheer putting forth or bringing forth, sheer geniture"9 of orders. Thus the definition of nature is in terms of what is experienced, what can be discriminated as the plurality of the "sphere[s] of (or for) relatedness"10 that are the orders of and in nature, not nature as such, namely, not nature as an order, which is meaningless for Buchler. To speak of nature as an order or the grand order is to equivocate; the analogy between the orders of nature and nature as an order fails because experienced orders can always be located as subaltern orders, something that cannot be done of nature as such. Thus the inexhaustibility of nature and the inexhaustibility of human query preclude speaking of nature as such, or nature as a whole in any meaningful sense as an order. Hume made a similar argument in Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, in which he insisted that the argument from design is flawed because the analogy between a designer within the world and a designer of the world fails precisely because no experience of a universe being designed has been had and could be had that would allow the analogy to be made in the first place. As with the idealism described above, this kind of analogizing through equivocation accomplishes its task through the collapsing of differences. Ordinal metaphysics for Buchler goes hand in hand with a defense of onto logical parity,11 which is the claim that no complex is more or less real, more or less natural than any other complex. Every complex of relations or order is a natural complex that is in and of the one nature; every complex locates and is located by some other complex, all of which are in and of the one nature. For Buchler, poetic and mythic works are no more or less real, no more or less natural than buildings, planes, and cars; furthermore, such human artifacts are no more or less real or natural than trees and lions. In my estimation, no other Western philosopher before Buchler has put forward such a radical metaphys ics; no other philosopher before him has so consistently and explicitly set aside all claims to ontological priority. The history of Western philosophy is the history of the defense of one form 9. Buchler, The Metaphysics of Natural Complexes, 276. 10. Ibid., 95. 11. For the concept of ontological parity, see Justus Buchler's Metaphysics of Natural Com plexes, 30-51, and "On a Strain of Arbitrariness in Whitehead's System," The Journal of Philosophy 66 (October 2, 1969): 589-601.</page><page sequence="6">Volume 32, No. 2, May 2011 161 or another of ontological priority, from Parmenides's One, to Plato's Forms, to Leibniz's monads, to Heidegger's Being, and so on. The West has therefore produced a parade of philosophers insisting that a single trait of nature is incommensurably real in connection with all other traits. This seems rather acutely indigenous to the character of Western thought, which prizes ego infla tion at all costs. In contrast, the East has chiefly sought either to restrict or even ultimately to eliminate the ego. In sum, while ego inflation has as its counterpart ontological priority, ego deflation has as its counterpart ontological parity. Not surprisingly, the West has looked with extreme suspicion upon every mention of mysticism and pantheism, both of which reduce the ego's promi nent stature. While the mystic annihilates the ego by its total immersion in the divine presence, the pantheist devalues the ego either by arguing that the ego is nothing in comparison with the divine whole or by arguing that the ego is not better than anything else, because everything is permeated by the indwelling pantheistic divinity. Why do mysticisms and pantheisms both mesmerize and terrify us in the West? What have we kept in abjection,12 that is to say, what have we violently buried, discarded, disfigured, and warped to bolster the ego? Should we not face our abjections with Buchler's ontological parity in mind? That ontological parity opens the path to a genuine encounter with our abjec tions is reason enough to be conducting this investigation into the viability of pantheism from the perspective of Buchler's ordinal metaphysics. The virtue of charity that is put into practice within ordinal metaphysics by way of ontological parity is best exhibited in Buchler's brief and somewhat elliptical analysis of religion in his seminal work, The Metaphysics of Natural Complexes.13 Though he locates the concept of God as a natural complex, he does not diminish the broad scope and power of this natural complex in hu man life. In fact, he suggests by way of the subjunctive mood that were one to understand God as "that complex of nature which preserves overwhelming contrast with the finite,"14 then God would be the goad that keeps query from closing in upon itself by "opening human ways beyond prevailing limits, and constantly renewing in the experiential orders of the world (in the perspectives of man) that sensitivity to the similar and the different which lies at the base of query."15 How surprising for a naturalist to claim that the experience of God 12.

Ibid., 7-8.</page><page sequence="7">162 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy as a natural complex can serve to ramify query. So it appears that for Buchler the concept of God is what Karl Jaspers called a cipher, an object that always points beyond itself, an elusive object that remains perpetually suspended, ever open to reinterpretations, an object that is forever barred from closing in upon itself, thereby fostering the practice of philosophical faith, which, for Jaspers, is "the readiness to keep an infinitely open mind."16 Though Buchler's intent is different from that of Jaspers in that Buchler does not ultimately seek the shipwreck of query into nature's complexes, thinking of Buchler's concept of God as a cipher is surely helpful in understanding what Buchler means by the natural complex that is God. For Buchler, the same ambiguity and proliferation of meanings is attached to the concept and experience of God that is attached to a cipher. Buchler puts the matter as follows: If the concept of God is thought of as viable metaphysically, and not blank ly endured as a stimulus to animism, it must signify a natural complex.... Historically and persistently, there attaches to it a customary formal scheme of traits.... Thus men have recognized in effect that to God belongs great pervasiveness, inexhaustible value as a paradigm, symbolic richness, "su premacy." ... The persistence of the scheme mirrors a difficult, unresolved union of natural (though not universal) discriminations: of that which is always present yet always dark; of unaccountable imbalance, dissonance, and hunger; of perfection, remoteness, inevitability, mystery.17 Buchler does not indicate whether the unresolved ambiguities in the natural complex that is God can or should be ultimately resolved. Though he does not equate the natural complex God with the fecundity of nature that infinitely ramifies human query, it seems to me that for Buchler the natural complex God is perhaps a representation of the human experience of the inexhaustibility of nature, and of the mystery at the heart of nature that quickens infinite determi nations of nature's complexes, without thereby offering a full consummation or encompassment of nature's inexhaustibility. Perhaps the following statements by Buchler lend some credence to this interpretation: "The expression "God willing" is a recognition that the traits, the boundaries, that prevail or arise, govern the life of man. Limitation and situation give birth to the conative forces of overcoming, aspiring. The principle that there always are questions beyond the questions that have been asked, and complexes beyond and within 16. Karl Jaspers, Philosophical Faith and Revelation, trans. E. B.

Buchler, Metaphysics of Natural Complexes, 6-7.</page><page sequence="8">Volume 32, No. 2, May 2011 163 the complexes that are known, besides being defensible as such, preserves the momentum of life and query."18 Thus the natural complex that is God serves as a reminder of the experience of the sheer givenness and availability of the natural complexes that prevail in just the way that each prevails, and of the mystery that is the incipience and arising of such complexes in the first place. For Buchler, therefore, the order or natural complex that is the sacred reminds the human order that it is embedded within a vast and ubiquitous nature of innumerable orders, to which the human order is indebted. Human individuals, human communities, and their products are themselves all products of nature. The human self and its products are in and of nature; as orders of nature or natural complexes, they are continuous with other natural complexes. The sa cred, then, is the reminder that there are no absolute beginnings or endings?no absolute discontinuities of any kind. This is no trivial declaration. Its import becomes evident when we reflect upon Buchler's view of the purpose of phi losophy. For Buchler, the philosopher who furthers query "implicitly perceives that the incompletion within life is perpetual."19 Or to put the matter differ ently: "Philosophy effects a distinctive realization: that the categorial struggle to encompass structures of indefinitely greater breadth is both inevitable and valid. The philosopher comes to see that one perspective can excel or embrace but not annul another. Those who are most truly liberated by the philosophic spirit are likely to be most subject to the compulsion of other philosophies. Such compulsion does not entail literal cognitive acceptance but greater articulative mastery over one's own perspective and over the other, and greater conceptual endowment for the sense of encompassment."20 The virtue of philosophy consists in recognizing that in whatever way we recreate or refashion nature, and whatever rendition of nature we produce, the outcome will undoubtedly be nature reproduced or refashioned in certain respects and not in others. Any human rendition of nature is liable to have been rendered differently, or in different respects. Each rendition includes some natural complex or some trait of a natural complex, while excluding others. No human perspective or rendition can produce "faith in finally determinate rules, imperatives, and canons."21 The "sense of encompassment" that philoso 18. Ibid., 8. 19.

Ibid., 105.</page><page sequence="9">164 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy phy engenders is the ethical demand that no perspective can claim absolute legitimacy; put differently, it is the view that all perspectives are provisional, limited, and relative renditions of nature?relative, because a rendition it self is an order of nature that is conditioned by and conditions other orders of nature. Of renditions or products, Buchler insists that "it is monstrous to suppose that every fact discernible about a product, and every suggestion or implication latent in it, is already possessed."22 Nature and its products cannot be fully and finally encompassed in any meaningful sense; as the encompassing, nature is the sheer availability of orders. For Buchler, then, to have a "greater conceptual endowment for the sense of encompassment" is precisely the op posite of encompassing more and more, capturing more and more in one's metaphysical net. The "sense of encompassment" he advocates is the sense of being encompassed; the sense that in whatever way one renders one or more orders of nature, something of the rendition will inevitably fail to capture the full ramifications, the indefinite relations of the orders rendered. In other words, no perspective or rendition has absolute legitimacy, or as Buchler puts the matter, "All judgments are relative completions."23 For Buchler, then, the sacred is that natural complex which broadens my horizon by unceasingly disturbing my ego's complacency and dogmatism, and awakens in me the awareness of the sheer elusiveness and complexity of the encompassing that is nature. Unique to naturalism is this embedding of whatever is to the plane of nature or the natural, of collapsing the ontologi cal distinction often made between objects that are thought to have absolute value in connection with others that are said to be of lesser or relative value. With this statement, we have arrived at the problem of whether naturalists can also be pantheists. Buchler's form of naturalism undeniably asserts, first, that the sacred is an order of nature among other orders of nature; second, that the sacred is not ontologically superior in value to other orders of na ture; and, third, that the value accorded to a given definition of the divine is only a relative value having no absolute legitimacy?a judgment to value one set of natural traits to the exclusion of others. Keeping in mind the rig orous naturalism of Buchler and the limitations imposed on the nature of the sacred by that rigorous naturalism, we are now ready to consider how pantheists have conceived the divine in connection with nature. It should become clear below that the ambiguous relationship between the divine and 22. Ibid., 149. 23. Ibid., 64.</page><page sequence="10">Volume 32, No. 2, May 2011 165 nature in pantheism poses an insurmountable roadblock to the naturalist's acceptance of pantheism. What is Pantheism? In Western thought pantheism has primarily arisen on the fringes of philosophi cal and religious thought, usually as an iconoclastic alternative to traditional ideas about God and nature. The term has also been mainly employed not by its adherents, but by those seeking to disparage their opponents for hold ing nontraditional ideas. Pantheism has not given rise to a sacred text or an institutionalized religion; rather, its individual adherents have been the sole practitioners of it (with the exception of Stoicism), and they have paid dearly for their eccentric taste in pantheism. But what is pantheism? Providing a gen erally accepted definition of pantheism is a rather impossible task for various reasons. First, pantheists have understood what they mean by pantheism in radically different ways. Second, the problem is complicated by the fact that opponents of pantheism have also defined it differently and have attacked different forms of pantheism. Third, an unacknowledged element of panthe ism has been present within traditional theism, which has not only touted the absolute transcendence of God, but also the immanence and omnipresence of God in God's creation. Therefore the primary task here is first to examine the various forms of pantheism to determine whether some recurring traits of pantheism can be distilled that can provide a foothold for our inquiry into pantheism's connection with naturalism. An unabridged review of Western pantheisms or of philosophies pantheistic in tenor would have to include, among others, the Pre-Socratic material monists Thaies, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, the enigmatic Heraclitus, the Hel lenistic Stoics, the Medieval mystic and iconoclast Giordano Bruno, the 17th century God-intoxicated philosopher Baruch Spinoza, the German idealists F. W. J. Schelling and G. W. F. Hegel, and the transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson, not to mention the variety of current pantheisms influenced by the classical pantheists. For this essay we limit our examination to the pantheisms put forward by Bruno, Spinoza, and Hegel. A brief presentation of how each conceives the pantheistic divinity in connection with nature will assist us in determining whether naturalists can also be pantheists. We begin with Giordano Bruno, a 16th century Italian Renaissance natural ist, who put forward the view that nature is a living, unitary being that can be understood from two different perspectives, enfolded and unfolded: enfolded nature is nature understood as one simple, unitary, divine substance, while unfolded nature is the same unitary, divine substance understood from the</page><page sequence="11">166 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy perspective of its modes as the particular manifestations of the one substance.24 Bruno's pantheism seeks to undermine Aristotle's system by insisting that forms are not external impositions upon a purely passive material substratum; rather, he argues that forms indwell in matter and arise from its womb as its own productions, its own offspring. The counterpart to matter is a world-soul or spirit that permeates nature and rationally directs the unfolding of the forms, shaping matter from within as its indwelling spirit or creative force. Ultimately, for Bruno, matter, form, spirit, and intellect are not to be understood as distinct substances but rather as the one living, divine nature considered from differ ent perspectives. Nature, therefore, is a self-generating organic whole that is directed internally or immanently to greater and greater perfection. However, despite Bruno's tendency to infuse nature with divinity, despite his tendency to do away with idealistic dualisms, abstractions, and hierarchies by conceiving nature as a living, organic, unified whole, one still finds a trace of supernaturalism in his works, perhaps a holdover from neo-Platonism, when he argues that an ultimate principle exists outside nature, as its unknowable and mysterious source, and that nature is only a vestige of this same mysteri ous source. Nonetheless, even this supernaturalism may come to naught in the light of his belief that the divine substance and its modes are two aspects of the same reality that come together or collapse into a unity as the coincidence of opposites that is the one nature.25 So it appears that Bruno ambiguously bolsters and undermines nature in connection with the divine, and, as will emerge below, it is this very ambiguity that bars the naturalist from embracing pantheism. Spinoza, the most celebrated of the pantheists, argues that only one infinite and eternal substance exists as an indwelling cause of everything, which he labels Deus sive Natura, translated as "God or Nature."26 This infinite sub stance has infinite attributes, or essential properties, of which only two essential properties, extension and thought, or matter and spirit, are known to us. All individual things are apparently modes or modifications of the essential prop erties of the one infinite substance, God or Nature. This God or Nature is not a personal divine being who creates a world then periodically intervenes to set it aright; rather, Spinoza's God or Nature is that impersonal divine substance 24.

Elwes, with revisions by SPR Charter (n.p.: Joseph Simon Publisher, 1981).</page><page sequence="12">Volume 32, No. 2, May 2011 167 from the nature of which all things come to be determined necessarily. In other words, no final causality is to be found in Spinoza's system, so that neither God nor Nature acts with purpose driving all things to the good of the whole. However, despite Spinoza's description of God or Nature as a thoroughly immanent divine necessity, he yet distinguishes God from Nature ontologically by arguing that the divine substance is an individual organism that remains unperturbed, while its parts, i.e., phenomenal nature, undergo infinite modifi cations. Spinoza, therefore, divides God or Nature into active nature and pas sive nature. Active nature, or what he calls nature naturing, is God or Nature understood as the infinite, self-standing, unified, sole substance, while passive nature, or what he calls nature natured, is God or Nature understood from the perspective of the individual modes or modifications of the one substance. Put in terms of Buchler's naturalism, nature naturing refers to the inexhaustibility of nature, while nature natured refers to the variety of things that follow from this inexhaustibility.27 But the explanation Spinoza gives for the inexhaust ibility of God or Nature clearly proves that nature naturing for Spinoza is of ontologically superior value in connection with nature natured. In Spinoza's estimation, were the divine substance to be exhaustible, it would be a finite, limited, bounded, and dependent modification of the one substance. But for Spinoza, the divine substance is inexhaustible, has no origin or end, precisely because it is ontologically superior. Once again, the simultaneous bolstering and undermining of nature bans the naturalist from embracing pantheism. Hegel,28 an idealistic pantheist, defends the view that pantheism does not mean "everything is God," that the totality of individual things lumped together is God, but rather that "the All is God" (Pt. II, ?469); that is to say, that God is "the essence within ... individual things" (Pt. I, ?274), "the absolute womb or the infinite fountainhead out of which everything emerges" (Pt. I, ?272), in comparison with which individual, finite, empirically experienced determinate things are nothing. According to Hegel, individual things only have value in sofar as they are negated or sublated, insofar as they are no longer seen to be separate existents with absolute worth. But individual things are nothing other than nature itself, and nature is, for Hegel, nothing more than a momentary "separation or estrangement from God" (Pt. Ill, ?217), which is to be overcome by a return to the unity that is God. 27.

As such, it is a system of anthropo morphism writ large wherein the pantheistic god, who contains all things within himself as in a seed, gives birth to himself by way of nature; this is apparently necessary because God is not only substance but also a personal subject or spirit who can only become a genuine person by having a relationship with itself. Put differently, idealism requires that for something to be genuinely real, unified, or actual, it must undergo a process from unconsciousness to consciousness, from a static state to a living, dynamic, concrete spiritual state, and in order to reach this higher stage, it must undergo genuine suffering through a process of separation and eventual reunion of the self with its other. However, when pantheism infuses-by way of idealism?personality, spirit, and individuality into its system and talks of nature and God in anthropomorphic terms, the problem arises, of course, as has been documented in the pantheism debate of the time, as to whether one can simultaneously be an idealist and a pantheist. Pantheism begins to break down when separate, independently existing spiri tual beings are posited, when spirit precedes nature. The ontological priority of the pantheistic divinity is even more evident in Hegel, than it is in Bruno and Spinoza. Idealism is clearly more aligned with traditional theism than it is with pantheism, and, as will emerge below, pantheism loses its identity when it borrows from idealism. What are the common pantheistic elements among Bruno, Spinoza, and Hegel? Chief among the recurrent concepts is the idea of a divine unity.29 But what is unity, and why does it hold the seat of honor in pantheistic philosophy? Divine unity has meant for pantheists: independence, perfection, personhood, impersonality, power, force, pervasiveness, fecundity, simplicity, infinity, eternal ity, substantiality, essentiality, inexhaustibility, worthiness, oneness, subjectiv ity, spirituality, invariability, goodness, wholeness, completion, immanence, transcendence, purposefulness, consciousness, unconsciousness, life, and so on. However the divine unity is described, such unity is never understood as something that is over against nature, as something that is entirely severed from nature, or as something that has nothing to do with nature. Thus divine unity and nature are related and relatable for the naturalist. Some of the ways in which this relationship has been expressed include the following: divine unity is nature; divine unity permeates and infuses nature; divine unity is the founda tion, origin, and source of nature; divine unity expresses itself or projects itself partly or wholly as and in nature; divine unity is the fountainhead, womb, and inexhaustibility of nature; nature is the self-revelation of the divine unity to 29. For the definition of pantheism as all-inclusive divine unity, see Michael P. Levine, Pan theism: A Non-theistic Concept of Deity (London: Routledge, 1994).</page><page sequence="14">Volume 32, No. 2, May 2011 169 itself; nature is the necessary mediator or stepping-stone for the divine unity; nature is the language of divine unity; nature is the material extension of divine unity in time and space; divine unity is active and passive nature combined, namely, nature naturing, and nature natured, respectively; and so on. Divine unity and nature are the two inseparable poles of pantheism. Clearly, the vari ous forms of pantheism can be categorized by taking stock of the status of nature with respect to divine unity. The primary problem of any pantheism is therefore the problem of the value of nature in relationship to the divine unity. This problem does not arise for the theist for whom the divine unity has no intrinsic relationship to nature. While the divine unity of the theist is the unity, sameness, simplicity, oneness, etc., of nothing other than itself, the divine unity of the pantheist is the unity that is nature, the unity that is expressed in nature, the unity that unifies nature, the unity that is of nature, the unity that nature exhibits, the unity that unfolds as and into nature. Whenever such divine unity is defined without reference to nature, theism rears its head. Because personhood is central to theism, pantheism also loses its distinc tion from theism when pantheism attributes anthropomorphic traits to its divinity. This is closely tied with the problem of nature for pantheism. The more pantheism anthropomorphizes its divine unity through the attribution of personhood by way of consciousness, purpose, morality, goodness, and rationality, the more the second pole of pantheism, nature, is devalued, and treated as a temporary prison-house, a necessary evil that must be endured for the ultimate goal of reunion with divine unity. Idealism in the West has been the chief engine of anthropomorphism writ large, because of its hyper valuation of spirit over matter, and not just any kind of spirit, but human spirit exhibited through human personality. I would therefore argue, contra Schelling and Hegel, that idealism is inconsistent with pantheism through and through. If the personhood of God is central to theism, and if idealism touts the spirit and personhood of the divine unity, then, perforce, idealism contradicts and annuls pantheism, and therefore has no place in the vicinity of pantheism. Indeed, the theist defends its central claim of supernaturalism by insisting that the divine is an absolutely distinct person or spirit. Clearly, then, pantheism has to insist that the pantheistic God is no person, and, moreover, has to divest its divine unity of all anthropomorphic trappings, lest nature is unwittingly transformed into the pole that is absolutely severed from divine unity. Nature therefore disappears from pantheism when the differences between the divine unity and nature are transformed into absolute distinctions, into unbridgeable chasms. Pantheism remains pantheism only insofar as it refuses to fall into the trap of speaking in absolutistic dualisms, which is the central</page><page sequence="15">170 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy mode of conversing about God in theism. For pantheism to remain panthe ism, it must maintain the distinction between the divine unity and nature in an uneasy tension, without thereby transforming the distinction into an absolute duality in which nature is annulled by way of absolute devaluation. For the pantheistic unity to be pantheistic it must be the unity of, in, and through nature. Put differently, nature disappears when pantheism engages in reductionism and dualism?language games only available to the theist who prefers specula tive theorizing about abstractions. Both Spinoza and Bruno oppose such lan guage games in their defense of pantheism. Bruno, for instance, insists contra Aristotle that the forms are not externally imposed upon matter, but arise as the generative activity of matter. Similarly, he infuses matter with the world soul or spirit of the Neo-Platonists, in addition to the divine intellect, both of which were previously understood by the Neo-Platonists as distinct substances or hypostases.30 But most importantly, Bruno argues that matter, spirit, intel lect, and forms are simply different perspectives on the same divine unity. No speculative hierarchies, no absolute dualities are to be found here that lead to the disappearance of nature. Spirit has neither been reduced to matter, nor matter to spirit. Cartesian dualism is not on Bruno's pantheistic horizon. His pantheism embraces no clearly demarcated boundaries, no absolute compartmentalization of the various faces of nature, and no ontological distinctions regarding more or less real things. Bruno expresses this virtue of charity to all things by arguing that the divine unity is not more or less accessible to one form of nature than to another: "You do not come any nearer to proportion, likeness, union, and identity with the infinite by being a man than by being an ant, by being a star than by being a man.... And so in the infinite these things are indifferent."31 Holding to the view that nothing within nature can exhaust an understanding of the divine unity is nothing other than a defense of ontological parity within Bruno's pantheism. For Bruno, therefore, the inexhaustibility of nature is req uisite for developing a proper attitude to the pantheistic divinity. This means that for the pantheist, since no single natural complex within nature can serve to encompass fully and finally the divine unity, any reduction of nature to one or more orders of nature undermines pantheism. Even more to the point, the reduction of nature as such to divine unity by way of the devaluation and eventual disappearance of nature is antipantheistic. Spinoza's antireductionism and antidualism are just as robust as Bruno's. The 30. For the neo-Platonic concept of the hypostatic triad, refer to ?V. 1 of Plotinus's, The En neads, trans.

No otherworldly, supernatural anchor falling from the sky or this-worldly, thoroughly natural anchor is offered by Spinoza for the amelioration of human need and suffering. Simply put, for Spinoza, nature has no beginning, no end, and no outer boundary. Nature lacks ultimate or transcendent goals or purposes, as well as absolute foundations; it is therefore inexhaustible, with no end in sight to its modifications. Essentially, Spinoza has denuded nature of all human projections designed to transform nature into something palatable, into something that provides foundational support. Central to Spinoza's form of pantheism, therefore, is the desire to ward off all human valuations of nature. Nature and its modifications must not be idolized in any respect. All projections by the ego to remake nature and its modifica tions to suit the ego's limited demands must be cast aside. To this end, humans must avoid labeling nature as either perfect or imperfect, either good or bad. With respect to nature's modifications, humans must avoid pitting one part of nature against another, for instance, pitting spirit against matter, or reducing one to the other, and must come to see that each is an essential aspect of the same divine nature understood from different perspectives. The purpose of these admonitions is to remind humans that they are embedded in the universal order of nature, so that they come to understand that they, along with all other modifications of nature, are the common property of God or Nature. As the common property of God or Nature, Spinoza argues that each thing is determined by a nexus of causes, some more proximate, while others more remote, and that therefore nothing is absolutely disconnected or unrelated to anything else. This means that no absolutely independent causes can be discov ered in nature. According to this view, human beings are just as thoroughly in and of nature as is everything natural. The ethical upshot of this argument is that the more we acknowledge that all things are determined by a nexus of causes or causal relationships, which follow necessarily from the one divine substance God or Nature, the greater our deference for the perceived failings of other human beings and for the perceived failings of nature. Spinoza's pantheism inevitably leads to ontological parity. Spinoza puts the matter thus: "He who rightly realizes, that all things follow from the necessity of the divine nature, and come to pass in accordance with the eternal laws and rules of nature, will not find anything worthy of hatred, derision, or contempt."32 Indeed, a spiri tual discipline resembling a phenomenological bracketing of one's prejudices is required for Spinoza's form of pantheism: "the strong man [i.e., the virtuous man] has ever first in his thoughts, that all things follow from the necessity of 32. Spinoza, Ethics, Pt. 4, Prop. 50.</page><page sequence="17">172 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy the divine nature; so that whatsoever he deems to be hurtful and evil, and what soever, accordingly, seems to him impious, horrible, unjust, and base, assumes that appearance owing to his own disordered, fragmentary, and confused view of the universe. Wherefore he strives before all things to conceive things as they really are."33 Spinoza and Buchler are on the same page here. Both agree that the source of ontological priority is, as Buchler puts the matter, "the confusion of what prevails with what we want or do not want to have prevail."34 Put dif ferently, for both philosophers, ontological priority arises from human traits writ large upon some order of nature, or upon nature as such. Naturalism on Pantheism and Divine Unity The list of interests shared by pantheists (not all pantheists agree with all the points here) and naturalists is long: 1. the desire to collapse absolute dualisms that would drive an unbridgeable chasm between the divine and nature, be tween human beings and nature, between spirit and matter, between the body and the intellect; 2. the desire to remove any supernatural causes posited over against nature, causes that are entirely cut off from nature; 3. the desire to cleanse nature of anthropomorphisms; 4. the belief in the inexhaustibility of nature, which is the belief that nature has no outer boundary, no ultimate limits, and that, therefore, it cannot be exhaustively defined; 5. the insistence that all things are in and of the one nature, and a defense of the ontological parity of all orders of nature complementing such a view; 6. the promotion of the virtue of charity with respect to all things arising from the realization that all things are in and of the one nature, and the ethical demand that accompanies this realization, namely, that seeing natural things for what they are requires a kind of phenomenological bracketing of prejudices and emotional attachments. But the naturalist can surely argue that all these similarities are only given prima facie and do not address the primary and substantial difference between pantheism and naturalism concerning the status of the divine unity. That the pantheist agrees with the naturalist that all things are in and of the one nature is commendable, but it fails to address the fact that the pantheist believes that all things within nature are of equal value, have equal ontological status, only because something else absolutely transcending nature is of infinitely greater value, has far greater ontological status, namely, the divine unity, or nature as a whole. The view that human beings can speak of nature as a whole, or as a totality is categorically antithetical to the character of naturalism. Fur 33. Spinoza, Ethics, Pt. 4, note for Prop. 73. 34. Buchler, Metaphysics of Natural Complexes, 117.</page><page sequence="18">Volume 32, No. 2, May 2011 173 thermore, for the nonce, conceding the belief that experience of the totality of nature can be had at all, the naturalist would still deny that the whole of nature has greater value, or is of greater ontological status than the various orders or natural complexes of nature. For the naturalist, the divine unity posited by the pantheist is simply an anthropomorphic need to give closure and boundaries to nature, to reify, objectify, or to make an idol of a false and illusory concept?the concept of a totality or a whole of nature that is good in itself, one that deserves our respect because of its grandeur and sublimity. The claim that nature as such is good or bad is simply denied by the natural ist. But even if the pantheist insists that nature as such and its modes have no moral attributes and purposes, as is the case in Spinoza's form of pantheism, the naturalist will still argue that Spinoza's positing of an infinite substance, absolutely independent of all its transitory modifications, is just the reification of nature as such into a divine being that is unacceptable to the naturalist. To reiterate, the chief difference separating pantheism from naturalism is the pantheist's belief that the divine aspect of nature is the unity of nature, a unity that is of superior value to the various orders of nature. Even more problematic is the pantheist's infusion of nature with a system of internal relations, and a principle of sufficient reason to account for the superiority of the divine unity, and the inferiority of the various orders of nature. Pantheists of all stripes insist that nature as such or the divine unity is an interconnected whole within which each one of the modes, manifestations, and determinations of the divine whole finds its ultimate explanation. They argue that everything has its place in the economy of the divine whole, that everything is connected to everything else by virtue of the fact that it is a part of the divine unity, and that each thing is valuable only insofar as it is one link of the chain contributing to the unity of the whole. That all things are mere cogs in the machinery of a divine whole is a belief that no naturalist can accept. According to Santayana, such pantheistic deference to the whole and its unity covers over the real condi tions of nature, and thwarts the piecemeal progress of human ideals by falsely conflating the ideal with the real: "Pantheism.. . turns the natural world, man's stamping-ground and system of opportunities, into a self-justifying and sacred life. ... To worship nature as she really is, with all her innocent crimes made intentional by our mythology and her unfathomable constitution turned into a caricature of barbarian passions, is to subvert the order of values and to falsify natural philosophy."35 Therefore, according to Santayana, pantheism 35.

Both posit as objective facts what are merely human projections, speculative abstractions lacking natural grounding. According to the naturalist, the outcome is, of course, the whitewashing of the complexity and plurality of the orders of nature. One need only advert to the predicates employed by theists and panthe ists alike when describing the divine nature to conclude categorically that in whatever way the pantheistic divinity differs from the theistic one, both divini ties share precisely the same qualities, and both divinities represent the same thing for their respective adherents. A review of the attributes of the divine unity of pantheism illustrates what I mean: independence, perfection, person hood, impersonality, power, force, pervasiveness, fecundity, simplicity, infinity, eternality, substantiality, essentiality, inexhaustibility, worthiness, oneness, subjectivity, spirituality, invariability, goodness, wholeness, completion, im manence, transcendence, purposefulness, consciousness, unconsciousness, life, and so on. And to argue here that some of these predicates are only found in pantheism, such as impersonality, force, fecundity, inexhaustibility, immanence, and unconsciousness is patently false. For instance, regarding the predicate immanence, the theist has never argued that God is absolutely transcendent from God's creation. If that were so, no divine history could be had, no fall from grace and eventual reunion could be had, and no incarnation could be had. So the theistic God has always been absolutely transcendent and abso lutely immanent. What of the predicate impersonality? Well, the theist has consistently argued that the believer should vigilantly keep in mind that the predicates used to describe God are always somewhat off the mark, due in part to our way of conceiving God, namely, to our tendency to attribute to God anthropomorphic terms. If that is the case, then the attribution of personality to God is no better than the attribution of impersonality to God. Furthermore, whatever we mean by personality, we clearly do not understand this concept in the same way when referred to human beings, as when referred to the theistic God. God's personhood could not very well mean that God has a limited and transitory set of traits, defined by one's innate disposition or temperament, and by environmental forces acting upon what we call the ego over a lifespan. Indeed, God's personhood must be something like a lack of personality, a lack of limited traits belonging to an ephemeral ego. So it appears that for God to be the theistic God, God must be impersonal, so that God can relate to all of God's creation equally without ego-centered prejudices. The theist can just as facilely create space for the other attributes presumably only applicable to pantheism. We need not go through each one of the remaining attributes in question to conclude that both the pantheist and the theist mean to convey ultimately the same thing by the use of these attributes, namely, absolute supe</page><page sequence="20">Volume 32, No. 2, May 2011 175 riority of the divine being, and the hypervaluation of this divine being arising from such absolute merit, such absolute incommensurability. Schopenhauer has gone one step further than we have here and has causti cally argued in his trademark cynicism that pantheism is a nonsensical form of theism; that pantheism presupposes the prior experience of and belief in the traditional God of theism as its starting point; and that having eventually become disillusioned about finding a palatable explanation for the experience of an unknown theistic God, and, according to Schopenhauer, "after it was no longer possible to dispose of this God,"36 the pantheist ends by "identifying] him with the world,"37 by making "the world . . . take over his role."38 How anyone could say that God takes the form of such unbearable torment, misery, and suffering that is our world is beyond belief for Schopenhauer. Agreeing with some naturalists, Schopenhauer argues that only the blindness and prejudice of human beings could lead to the positing of pantheism. No one who saw the world for what it is would transform a creator god to the form of the world that we know. Indeed, no creator god, according to Schopenhauer, would willingly accept that role. We are all well aware that for Schopenhauer, who is an atheist, the solution to the problem of the world's suffering is not the perpetuation of the will or its deification as the pantheistic God, but rather the eventual turn ing of the will against itself, and the ultimate cessation of the will. No divine redemption of the world's suffering is to be had in his philosophy. Is Schopenhauer correct in reducing pantheism to a mangled form of the ism? Is he correct that the word "pantheism" in reducing the theistic God to the world has only given a synonym for the world, and that, therefore, the concept of pantheism adds nothing to the concept of world, indeed, according to Schopenhauer, says nothing at all? The pantheist's response may be that the world or nature is not what the pantheist means by the pantheistic divinity. The pantheist can argue that the pantheist has never strictly equated the pantheistic divinity with nature, and that the distinction between the pantheistic divinity and nature is required for pantheism to be a genuine pantheism. In defense of the distinction, the pantheist can insist that although the distinction is not absolute, for then pantheism would indeed be theism, the distinction is still necessary for pantheism to make sense, and that the distinction clearly states that the pantheistic God is the immanent and unifying substance, source, power, force, fecundity, or womb of nature. The pantheist can further clarify the distinction 36. Arthur Schopenhauer, "A Few Words on Pantheism," in Par erga and Paralipomena, vol. 2, trans. E. F. J. Payne (1974; repr., Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 100. 37. Ibid. 38. Ibid.</page><page sequence="21">176 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy by noting that the distinction can be described as the difference between active nature, the pantheistic divinity as such, and passive nature, nature as we experi ence it with all its variety of individual things. So for the pantheist, although the pantheistic divinity is the unity of nature, it is not for all that what phenomenal nature is, namely, corruptible, finite, dependent, and so on. Indeed, the pantheist can insist that no pantheist has ever claimed that the totality of particular things put together is divine, or that each particular thing is divine, or that phenomenal natures, what the pantheist believes to be the manifestations or modifications of the pantheistic divinity, are divine. For the pantheist, the manifestations or modifications of the pantheistic divinity have only a derived, dependent divinity, and not an absolute, independent divinity. But if the pantheistic defense is taken to its conclusion, then it appears that the pantheist has unwittingly fallen into Schopenhauer's trap, namely, that pantheism is nothing other than mangled theism. Pantheism appears to be a half-hearted theism poorly grafted onto a half-hearted naturalism. As such, it has borrowed elements from both, and thereby produced a theological position that rests on an equivocation of the meaning of nature as both divine and not divine, as both the unity of an absolutely independent divine being and its thor oughly dependent manifestations. An uneasy fusion of naturalism with theism is the result of this equivocation. If the traditional theistic distinctions are to be maintained between infinity and finitude, independence and dependency, unity and multiplicity, then pantheism must admit that it is a modified form of theism. Both clearly favor one side of the duality over the other. Even if pantheism blurs the boundary between the two poles, God and nature, it still maintains the distinction, perhaps fearing that pantheism would indeed turn into atheism and lose the divinity that unifies nature?precisely the point that Schopenhauer sought to make. No pantheist can deny that its divine being is valued far more than its manifestations or modifications, and that no good justification can be given for saying that the divine substance, source, power, force, fecundity, womb is more valuable than nature as we experience it with all its variety. At least no justification can be given that the naturalist will accept. No justification can be given by the pantheist that does not postulate nonnatural, absolute, foundational beings. Buchler's naturalism is uncompromising on this point: "There is no foreground or background, no privileged location, only more and less inclusive orders."39 39. Buchler, Metaphysics of Natural Complexes, 205.</page><page sequence="22">Volume 32, No. 2, May 2011 177 Conclusion: The Economy of the Same and Ontological Priority in Pantheism Schopenhauer's criticism notwithstanding, pantheism does in fact differentiate itself from theism insofar as it admits nature into its divine scheme at all as a necessary pole upholding the pantheistic banner. For this alone, pantheism should be thoroughly applauded. Traditional theism has maintained nature in a state of abjection, being at a loss as to its status in the economy of the theistic worldview. Having been brutally cast aside into oblivion, and buried in a sepulcher never to reappear in the divine economy, save as a transfigured and transformed being, allegedly cleansed of its impurities, nature as such, without human categories draped over it for the purpose of dissimulating its unsavory characteristics, has never been admitted into the theistic economy. As Luce Irigaray has argued in the monologue Marine Lover of Friedrich Nietzsche,^ the theistic economy is a circle that closes in upon itself, an egoistic economy that only admits what it finds palatable, what does not disturb the eternal return of the same, forever contemplating its own primacy. Although addressed to Nietzsche, the monologue has Western philosophy and the traditional theistic God as its aim. She argues in this poetically overflowing work that theism is egoistic, and that it exhibits the "joy of annihilation,... in which man, as he reproduces himself, himself produces his becoming."41 According to her, this "forgetting of one's birth"42 is played out by the theistic God who is nothing other than the "ground of an origin that he gives himself."43 But what is this origin that is forgotten, that is devoured, that is kept in abjection? It is, for Iri garay, nothing other than nature: "Nature can be loved only if she is concealed: as if in a dream. No sooner do they sense nature than the men of yesterday and today climb high onto the roofs and towers of fantasy. ... Their dream: to cover the natural with veils ..., turn away from nature toward certainties that they can no longer even see, as an escape onto dangerous heights?their plains, their plans."44 Unfortunately, neither can pantheism escape Irigaray's devastating indict ment of theism and Western philosophy in general. She addresses the culprits, 40. Luce Irigaray, Marine Lover of Friedrich Nietzsche, trans. Gillian C. Gill (New York: Columbia University Press, 1991). 41. Ibid., 27. 42. Ibid., 30. 43. Ibid., 68. 44. Ibid., 108.</page><page sequence="23">178 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy thus: "And you thrust back to the edges of the place you now occupy the thing that always threatens to engulf you."45 Admittedly, pantheism provides space for nature in the economy of pantheism, but it does so with great apprehension and with numerous caveats, chief among them being that the divine unity is of eminently greater stature and value than nature understood as the divine unity's manifestations or modifications. For the pantheist, nature as the consequent has no value apart from the divine unity, which has absolute priority. Nature is an abjection that remains on the periphery. The equivocal use of the concept of nature by the pantheist exhibits the si multaneous attraction and repulsion, awe and dread of nature?the insistence that nature is both divine and not divine. On the one hand, nature is taken to be the divine unity that is absolutely prior to its manifestations or modifications, while on the other, nature is taken to be the totality of such manifestations or modifications lumped together, namely, nature as we experience it, or phenom enal nature. Nature in the former sense is ultimate and absolutely independent, while nature in the latter sense is contingent and dependent. Buchler's assess ment of this equivocation is clear: "Since the Innumerable Complexes do not constitute an Order, and since in consequence no order has an 'ultimate' location, it follows that no order has absolute priority over any other."46 "No complex can be regarded as, so to speak, transcendently free-floating, as nonordinal, as superseding all orders."47 Minus unconditional priorities, the only priorities available for the naturalist are priorities in some respect, namely, conditional priorities. No abjection of nature is to be found in Buchler's work. He neither demonizes, nor deifies nature. He merely notes its fecundity and the numerous orders that are the one nature. For Buchler, neither the fecundity, nor the numer ous orders available for indefinite human query are more nature or natural than the other. In fact, Buchler gingerly avoids any definition of nature as a totality, or as a grand order, or as a container of all containers. Any talk of nature for the naturalist can only be talk of the orders of nature, and not of nature in any unqualified or unified sense. Pantheism clearly has no place in naturalism. What is more, pantheism fails to uphold the radical ethical demand of Buch ler's form of naturalism to avoid fetishizing or idolizing any order of nature to the point of making it incommensurable with all other orders of nature. Pan theism is a version of theism that has been naturalized, but only half-heartedly. It may just be that no form of theism can avoid hypervaluing the theistic deity, 45. Ibid., 66-67. 46. Buchler, Metaphysics of Natural Complexes, 257. 47. Ibid., 276.</page><page sequence="24">Volume 32, No. 2, May 2011 179 thereby severing it from all other orders of nature, at least in certain respects, if not entirely. Buchler's form of naturalism insists that the value accorded to a given order of nature is relative to other orders of nature. In other words, the pantheistic divinity, as an order of nature, arises from a set of conditional judgments to value some natural traits to the exclusion of others. But the pan theist has kept the innumerable orders of nature in abjection to the pantheistic divinity. Nature is both attractive and repulsive to all of us in certain respects; however, to the pantheist, the attractive orders of nature are clearly of onto logically superior value, and clearly incommensurable with the repulsive orders of nature. Buchler's naturalism finds this ethically objectionable. For Buchler, the divine or the sacred orders of nature must be understood to have relative or conditional value, because they are continuous with other orders of nature in certain respects and not in others. Only in softening the boundaries of the sacred or divine orders, so that they become related and relatable to other orders of nature, can we avoid making a fetish or an idol of the sacred. If theism is liable to demonizing the nonbeliever by claiming exclusive access to the divine or the sacred, then the naturalist should be suspect of pantheism?a halfway house between theism and naturalism.</page></plain_text>
