<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW VOLUME XXXI OCTOBER, 1938 NUMBER 4 THE BASIC ASPECT OF HITTITE RELIGION GIUSEPPE FURLANI UNIVERSITY OF FLORENCE THE religions of ancient Western Asia, though presenting in detail a number of differences, agree in their conception of the relation between man and god. This is the same relation that exists between the servant and his master, or between the sub- ject and his king or prince. According to the religions of ancient Western Asia, man had to serve his god, his king and his mas- ter, and this service constituted his religion.' In fact, man was created solely to serve god, and all his life therefore was but a series of religious acts in the service of his god.2 The religious texts of all palaeo-oriental nations afford us ample proofs that this was the fundamental principle of their religion. I refer to Semitic nations, that is, to those who spoke Semitic languages,3 1 It would be an error to think that this concept is Semitic, in other words, that it is characteristic and exclusive of Semitic nations. It is found also among the Sumerians, the Egyptians, the Hittites, the Hurrians, the Elamites, the Persians. 2 That men were created by the gods for their service is mentioned expressly in the Enrima.0li9, VI, 32-33: i-na da-mi-gu ib-na a-me-lu-tu li-mi-id du-ul-li ilg-ma um-tal-?er, with his blood he has made mankind, he imposed (on it) the service of the gods (and) he freed (them), G. Furlani, 11 Poema della Creazione (Bologna, 1934), p. 103; R. Labat, Le Poeme babylonien de la Creation (Paris, 1935), p. 146. The passage must be under- stood in the sense that Ea forms humanity to free certain gods, guilty of having fol- lowed Tiamat in her foolish rebellion and therefore deserving of the punishment of having to serve the other gods. With the idea of restoring perfect peace in the pantheon without submitting one part of it to the other, the rebel gods to those victorious, Ea created humanity to lay this charge on it, the service of the gods, i.e. the rebel gods. There is not the slightest doubt, therefore, according to this myth, that humanity bears the consequences of a fault, not its own, but of that part of the gods who had rebelled and were defeated. Man must serve the gods because originally a part of the gods had rebelled and were then beaten by Marduk and his followers. This without doubt was the theory of the Babylonians concerning the creation of mankind. 3 With regard to the Babylonians and Assyrians, reference can be made to my book, La religione dei Babilonesi e Assiri, I-II (Bologna, 1928-1929), in which I often have occasion to mention this concept.

W. von Baudissin,</page><page sequence="2">252 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW or to peoples of other tongues: the Sumerians or the Phoeni- cians, the Hittites or the South Arabs. All these saw divinity in masters, princes, or kings who had man as subject or servant. The relation between man-servant and god-prince is ex- plained in its different aspects in full detail in certain Hittite texts. In no other literature of the Ancient East do we find so clear and detailed an exposition of the nature of that relation. This circumstance might lead to the supposition that among the Hittites the concept of man as the servant of god had been de- veloped and elaborated more deeply and fully than among the other palaeo-oriental nations, and that therefore the Hittites felt themselves to be more particularly servants of god than other Eastern nations. We are of the opinion that such a supposition would be erroneous or at least would have no solid foundation, because it is probable that only by the merest chance there has been preserved in the Hittite language itself a quasi-theological text dealing with this aspect of Eastern religion, while no such text is extant in Babylonian, Phoenician, or cognate languages. In other words, it seems improbable that the Hittite text, which we shall cite and explain in the following pages, proves that the concept god-prince and man-servant is exclusively of Hittite origin, or is an integral part of the religious mentality of the Hittites, while being adventitious among the other palaeo- oriental nations and not forming the center of their religious life. However this may be, it is certain that the Hittites had a very clear idea of the nature of the relation which bound them to their gods and which they assimilated to, and even identified with, the relation between master and servant. Indeed, so great was their familiarity with this concept that they even made it a subject of abstract examination. The Hittite text, in which the concept of god-master and of man his servant is explained at length, forms part of a treatise of Kyrios als Gottesname im Judentum und seine Stelle in der Religions-geschichte (Giessen, 1927 et seq.), and also O. Eissfeldt, Gotternamen und Gottesvorstellung bei den Semiten, ZDMG, LXXXIII (1929), 33-36. For the Hittites see A. Gitze, Die Pestgebete des Mur'ili', Kleinasiatische Forschungen, I (1929), 161-251, p. 161; G.

Our text calls those attached to the temples, or those employed in them, by the Sumerian ideogram LU.MES E DINGIR-LIM. These include the priests in the strict and exact meaning of the word, as well as those engaged in duties of a more administrative and economic character: thus it includes, as the title itself says, cooks (of whom there were several orders in the temples of the Hittites), peasants who tilled the fields belonging to the god, i.e. to the temple, herdsmen who looked after the cattle and livestock, shepherds and all those employed in any other kind of work connected with the temple. In the text mention is made of other lower functionaries, all in more or less direct service of the divinity and all held in- dispensable to the proper functioning of the temple and the carrying on of its multiform life. From this it may be seen that inasmuch as these functionaries, artisans, and workmen were employed together with the priests in the service of the god they were in reality servants of the divinity. It is not surpris- ing, therefore, that the Hittite text considers them as standing on the same level as servants stood with regard to their Hittite masters. It is further known, as we have said, that among all the nations of the ancient East man is considered as the servant of his god. It is therefore a matter of no surprise that our text 4 I quote and follow the latest edition by E. H. Sturtevant and G. Bechtel, A Hittite Chrestomathy (Philadelphia, 1935), 148-174, where the text in cuneiform characters is found in transliteration and in the English version, with a commentary principally of a philological character. I have dealt with this text at some length from the point of view of religion in my article Sul testo hittita "I doveri degli adetti ai templi," Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni XLV (1938), 82-130. 6 This is not really the title but the subscription of the first table of the series, which is the only one extant, but it is very probable that this was also the title of the series. For the sub-title see Sturtevant and Bechtel, Chrestomathy, 166 and 167.</page><page sequence="4">254 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW elaborates down to the smallest particulars the concept of man as the servant of god. The passage in question consists of thirteen lines of Article II of the above-mentioned text, and follows immediately on the dispositions of line 20. Article XIV is in part a doublet of Article II. Article XIV does not contain, however, the disqui- sition on god the master and on man his servant, as in Article 1I; in fact, immediately after line 67 (which in its contents corre- sponds more or less to line 20 of Article II) the unknown author goes on to discuss another argument. In the whole of our text, therefore, of which we may say in passing that only the first tablet has been preserved, it is Article II alone which deals with the matter under discussion. In the preceding lines of this Article there is a discussion of the physical and cultural purity which must be found in the bakers of the temples and in those places where the bread intended for the divinity is made." The author takes his cue from the words of these lines to enlarge upon the relation between god and man, between the people (Sumerian UKU) and the gods (Sumerian DINGIR.MES). This disquisition goes from line 21 to line 33, which is the last line of the Article in question. I wish first of all to give a translation of it and then explain and comment on it. 21. Is perhaps the mind (ZI) of the people I (UKU) and of the gods really different? No. (Is it different) somewhat in this? No. 22. The mind is the same (I-a'-pit). When a slave (ERUM) stands before his master (EN-SU) 23. he (must) be washed and must wear clean clothes 24. and he gives him to eat or he gives him to drink. 25. And then he, (i.e.) his master, eats and drinks something 26. and he is refreshed in mind and is gracious 8 towards him. 6 On purity and on the lustrations of the Hittites see Furlani, Religione, 233-242. SOn the meaning of ZI, mind, in this and in some other passages of the same text, see Furlani, Sul testo, 127-128. 8 Some of the terms occurring in our text are of uncertain meaning. See on this subject the notes of Sturtevant on the passage.</page><page sequence="5">HITTITE RELIGION 255 27. If, however, he (the servant) is neglectful 9 and is not zealous 10 28. then (his) mind towards him is different. If the servant gives annoyance to his master 29. then one kills him, one mutilates his nose, his eyes, 30. his ears. He (the master) seizes him (the servant), his wife, his children, 31. his brother, his sister, his relatives, his descendants, be they male or female slaves. 32. Then one disgraces him in public 11 and one takes no account of him. 33. If he should die, he does not die alone but his descend- ants are placed with him.12 The object of these lines is to explain that the mind, or to be more exact the disposition of mind, that the god has towards man is exactly the same as that which the master has towards his servant, in other words, that the relations between god and man are equal to those existing between master and servant. By mind, ZI,13 as is mentioned in the text, meaning disposition of mind, one must understand those spiritual relations which bind the master to his servant and the servant to his master. The text means that man acts towards his god in the same way as the servant acts towards his master, and thus god stands in the same relation to man as the master to his servant. There- fore the text says that the mind is "the same," in fact literally "it is one" (~2). With these words the unknown author of these lines wishes to explain the provisions for sacred rites immedi- ately preceding which require that those who prepare the bread for the gods must be clean, well washed, and wear clean clothes; 9 The text says IGI-wa-an-na-an-za, which is a Hittite term written with a Sumerian ideogram supplied with a Hittite ending. The Hittite word should have as root 'aku- wanna-, according to Sturtevant, A Hittite Glossary (Philadelphia, 1936), 129. But the meaning is not certain. 10 The text has the verb ha-an-ha-ni-ya-i preceded by two small oblique wedges, which means that the word is not Hittite but foreign. Sturtevant in Glossary, 41, translates by "observes, is observant." U Pdr-ra-an-da. For the meaning of this term cf. Sturtevant, Glossary, 119, and the passages of Friedrich there mentioned. n That is to say it dies with him. 13 For the meaning of this term see Furlani, Sul testo, 127-128.</page><page sequence="6">256 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW also the place where the bread is prepared must likewise be clean and not contaminated by any unclean animal (14-20 and XIV, 58-67). As therefore the servant, when he serves his master, must be clean and wear clean clothes, so too the baker of the temple must be clean and pure when he prepares the bread for the divinity; in a larger sense the priest, who is the direct servant of the di- vinity, must be clean and pure when he offers him to eat and must also wear clean clothes. In a still larger sense this applies to man in general,whose life according to the well-known palaeo- oriental idea must be wholly dedicated to the divinity and must be in reality nothing but divine service. From this comparison of the relation between master and servant our text draws other important conclusions. If the servant gives his master to eat and drink and is clean, and if the master eats and drinks and sees that his servant's service is perfect, then he is gracious towards him (23-26), and therefore the servant (though the text does not expressly say this) can easily obtain some reward and favor from his master. Such too was to be the behavior of the priest and of man in general towards god; if he serves him well and shows him respect he may hope to obtain grace and reward. If, however, the servant does not do his duty worthily towards his master but shows himself negligent and disobedient, if in fact he does not perform his service in a perfect manner, then his master's disposition towards him is different; he is no longer gracious and benevo- lent and does not reward him (27). In like manner god shows himself towards his priest or towards those employed in the temple or to a man who is lacking in zeal and respect. In this case the priest or the man cannot hope for the benevolence of the divinity. And if it happens that the servant disobeys his lord, does not follow his commands and completely offends him by his be- havior, then his master either kills him as a sign of punishment, or he cuts off his ears or his nose, or he pulls out his eyes, or again the master may call him to account for what he has done, and not only the servant but also his wife, his children, his brothers, sisters, all his relatives even those on his wife's side,</page><page sequence="7">HITTITE RELIGION 257 in a word, his whole family including the servants and slaves be they male or female, all his descendants of whatever degree 14 (28-31). Nor is this all: the master inflicts on him some defam- ing punishment, that is, he humiliates him publicly till he makes him feel he is less than nothing, so that he may make amends for his fault, and if his failure towards his master has a criminal aspect, the latter kills him together with his whole family, as we have seen (32-33). Identical is the method of the god when anyone of his faithful shows him little respect or commits a crime against him (III. 34). The god's method in this case, a method exactly similar to the one just now described regarding the master, our text describes in Article III. If therefore any- one (ku-is'), not only a priest or one employed in the temple's service, but any man, worshipping that certain god, shows him- self contrary to the divinity, commits an offence against his god, is flagrantly inimical to the god, he is punished together with his wife, his children, his descendants, his family, all his slaves and servants, male and female, and even his cattle, big and small, and his crops, and finally he is destroyed completely (36-37). The text therefore quite rightly concludes its brief disqui- sition on god and man and on the master and his servant with the warning and exhortation to those employed in the temple to have the highest regard for god and to submit to his orders (INIM, III, 38). This then is the disquisition of our text on the relation be- tween man and god, a disquisition which, as may be inferred from what has been said already, is a long and detailed com- parison. As in very many other manifestations of the religious life of the Hittites, so too in this fundamental point of their religion, god and the life of god are conceived entirely according to the nature and life of man."5 This principle has found among the Hittites a theoretical and systematic elaboration, as the 14 This instance of penal co-responsibility, both in the sacred and the profane law of the Hittites, is not the only one in Hittite literature. I shall soon deal with this elsewhere. 15 For the deep anthropomorphic character of the Hittite theology cf. Furlani, Religione, 24-25, and La religiosit&amp; degli Hittiti, Scientia, XXXI, 332-339.</page><page sequence="8">258 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW text we have just examined demonstrates. The Hittites knew very well that relations with the divinity must be conceived and developed along the lines of human relations and to explain this and to expound it more fully they adduced, therefore, these human relations. They were, however, entirely aware of the anthropomorphic nature of their theology and fully alive to its implications and consequences. We have said that the passage just quoted is a long compari- son, rich in many particulars. We may add that it is too an intuitive comparison, and no Hittite could have failed to grasp and understand it at once, because it referred to concepts and ideas which were not at all strange to him. If this were not so, it would have been useless to bring in such a comparison and use it as an explanation. This shows that the relation master- servant was a very common motif, almost a commonplace in the everyday life of the Hittites. But it also shows that the Hittites loved comparisons. This is confirmed by passages in other Hittite texts. In such writings, we observe comparisons used to render some concept more clear."' It is enough to mention the three beautiful comparisons which king Mur'ili' II makes in a prayer on the occasion of the twenty year plague which brought the country of the Hatti almost to the brink of ruin." Of the three comparisons of Mur'ili' II the first mentions a bird who seeks refuge in its nest,18 but this does not interest us now as it has nothing to do with the motif of master and servant. The second and third comparisons, however, deal with this latter motif. They also refer this motif to god and his faithful servant, in this present case to the divinity invoked and to Murvili II. The second comparison says 19 that when a servant finds him- self in difficulties he goes to his master with a prayer. The master listens to him and is kind to him. He helps him in his 16 See on this subject my remarks in Mursili' II e il concetto del peccato presso gli Hittiti, SMSR, X, 29, n. 2, where I mention other instances of comparisons, or parables, since in certain parts the comparisons resemble parables. 17 This refers to the Second Prayer, published by A. Gitze in Die Pestgebete des Murgilig, 204-219. 18 Second Prayer, X, 3. 19 I have mentioned and discussed this comparison in Murvili II, 28. In the Prayer it comes in line X, 4.</page><page sequence="9">HITTITE RELIGION 259 trouble. The servant is Mur'ili' and the master is the god. The former is oppressed by the anger of god, provoked by the sins committed by his father Suppiluliumas and by the Hittites and he begs that he may be relieved of this sorrow. God will certainly help him and will be kind again to him. One should notice that the text quoted above refers to the same circum- stance: the benevolence of the god-master toward the man- servant and his anger and the attendant punishment. The third comparison or parable 20 is on the same lines.2' If the servant has committed any fault and confesses it to his master, the latter can do with him as he pleases. However, as the servant has confessed his fault, the master is placated and he does not punish his servant. The servant who confesses his fault is, of course, Mur'ili', the master who accepts his servant's confession with kindness and benevolence is the god of the temple. Therefore god will not punish Mursilis any more, but will pardon him. In this comparison also we have the benevo- lent attitude of god towards his servant, or the opposite. From a study of these comparisons, which are properly para- bles, for they illustrate by means of allegory some truth or abstraction, there emerges clearly, to our view, the fact that the Hittites were extremely familiar with the motif of the god- master or lord and of the faithful man-servant and of the be- nevolence of the former towards the latter when his anger is appeased. How common this motif was is shown by the con- stant use the Hittites made of it to help them clarify other concepts. We think we have thus shown that the Hittites conceived the relation between god and man in exactly the same way as that between master and servant. Now this idea is at the basis of almost all the religious life of the Hittites of historical times, or of those times knowledge of which is given us by the texts written in cuneiform characters found in the ruins of Bogazk05y. In the periods prior to this the Hittites, of course, did not 20 Second Prayer, X, 5; Furlani, Mursili II, 98-29. 21 This comparison is important also for the Hittite doctrine on sin and on con- fession. For this latter doctrine see R. Pettazzoni, La confessione dei peccati, III (Bologna, 1936), 45; Furlani, Religione, 359.</page><page sequence="10">260 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW conceive the relation between god and man on these lines, but it is evident that they did so interpret it in that epoch of their religious history which we know. I have said that this idea is basic. In fact almost all the many aspects of the Hittite re- ligion are derived from this principle. It is fundamental and all other manifestations of their religion are but corollaries of it.22 The confession of sins is the admission of the servant's fault to his master, as is easily seen from the third comparison of the prayer of Mur'ilis. But all the doctrine of sin among the Hit- tites is a logical result of this idea. What in fact is sin? It is the transgression of the servant, of the believer, of the subject, to the commands and laws of the master, the lord, and the prince.23 In fact, the god-master issues orders and commands which become sacred laws and determine the destiny of every man- servant. All sacred legislation therefore is easily understood, and at its basis stands this very concept of god-master; the sacred laws and indirectly also the laws made by the earthly king 24 are merely the commands of god put in writing. On the other hand, the god-master decrees for every man-servant of his the duty and work he has to perform in life. And thus the doctrine of destiny and its application to men on the part of god is just a corollary of the principle already enunciated several times. The servant and subject must uphold his master and prince, and this explains the sacrifice, which, according to the Hittites and other races of ancient Western Asia, was the service of 22 By this I do not mean to affirm at all that the whole of the Hittite religion is to be brought back to this fundamental concept; far from this, I am convinced that still other principles have contributed to form that whole so rich in religious motifs which is the religion of the Hittites of historical times, the only one at present accessible to us. There must certainly have been in their religion a period which had not developed so clear a conception of the relation of service between man and god. There is no doubt that this conception was formed, developed, and better outlined with the progress of time. 23 Furlani, Religione, 347-348. 24 From the Hittite texts published up to the present there is no evidence, as far as I know, that the Hittites considered also the profane laws as coming from god, though this is very probable, for according to the Hittite idea the king is the representative and vicar of god on earth.</page><page sequence="11">HITTITE RELIGION 261 meals for the divinity.25 Man therefore gives his god to eat and serves him at the table and at his ritual toilet. He must further offer him all that he needs. This explains all the offerings that the Hittites felt themselves bound to make to their gods. The doctrine of sacrifice, of offerings and of personal service to god fits in perfectly with our motif. Still other aspects of the Hittite religion can be referred to this principle. The servant or subject must construct the dwell- ing or palace for his lord. Thus men must build temples for their gods in which these latter may dwell and give ear to their faithful, in which they can impart their orders for the adminis- tration of the world, listen to the prayers of their subjects - even the prayer is but an aspect of our principle - pronounce their judgments on the behavior of the servant-subjects, either rewarding or punishing them - all the judicial activity of the divinity derives from the principle god-master - and listen to their confessions and defence.26 A servant more zealous than others in the fulfilment of his duties and who executes the orders of his master with greater devotion and obedience is protected much more, is looked upon with a benevolent eye, and is open to the favor which enables him to succeed in everything he does. Thus god, satisfied with the life of his faithful servant, grants him his protection and guides him always and everywhere during his life, as is shown very clearly in the life, full of divine intervention, of the pious king Hattu'ili' III of Hatti who was always conscious of the help given him by his goddess Istar of Samuha in the various circumstances of life.27 The servant above all owes respect to his master and must be devoted to him. All that the Hittite religion prescribes to its faithful, i.e. to demonstrate these sentiments towards the divin- ity, fits in with our principle and includes therefore those aspects of offerings, sacrifice, and divine service which are gen- 25 On sacrifice among the Hittites see Furlani, Religione, 292-346. 26 I have spoken on the judicial activity of the Hittite gods in I1 giudizio del dio nella dottrina religiosa degli Hittiti, Revue Hittite et Asianique, V (1935), 80-44. 27 The king has described the interventions of the goddess, in his autobiography, about which, as far as regards religion, see Furlani, Religione, 126-187, and in regard to politics L'apologia di Hattusilig III di Hatti, Aegyptus, XVII (1937), 65-97.</page><page sequence="12">262 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW erally manifestations of such sentiments. The love man bears towards god, all his emotions and his religious sentiments, in fact, all his religious inner life is modelled on that inner and spiritual life of the servant in relation to his master which con- stitutes the basis of this relation. Externally and internally, the Hittite feels that he is the servant of god completely and entirely. To the Hittite religious life was truly a divine service in the strictest and most perfect meaning of these two words. We believe we have shown that the Hittites had a full con- sciousness of the nature of such a relation and that they debated it theoretically in order to translate it better into practice in the religious life of every day.</page></plain_text>
