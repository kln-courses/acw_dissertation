Introduction This article is an extended commentary on a short text in which Ibn Qutayba (d. 276/889) confronts an embarrassing tradition about some monkeys ('). But before we get to the monkeys, we need to locate the text in its intellectual landscape. The most general point that needs to be made is that our text is a typi- cal product of a debate culture. Early Islamic society, like our own, was marked by a diversity of religious beliefs. So what, at an intellectual level, is one to do about such diversity? One answer, our own, is to cele- brate it and admire the riches of each other's traditions. From a tradi- tional Islamic point of view, this would be a peculiar way to go about things. It puts the true believers and the false believers on the same level; it could fairly be described as truth-blind, or more precisely blind to the very notion of exclusive religious truth. Another answer is that the true believers should simply ignore the false believers, and give them no kind of intellectual recognition whatever. This was an attitude that had supporters in the early Islamic period, and it was perhaps the (1) Ibn Qutayba, Ta'wil mukhtalif al-htadfth, Cairo 1326, 324.6-326.14 ; French translation in G.

I first read this text with some attention with a group of graduate students at Princeton in December 1992 ; their reactions encouraged me to persevere. Parts of the material have been presented to seve- ral audiences : at a seminar at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton ; at Yale at the invitation of Leor Halevi ; at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, at the invitation of Tudor Parfitt ; at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem ; and at the Middle East Center, University of Pennsylvania. My thanks are due to all concerned for tolerance, comments, and references. I am also indebted to Patri- cia Crone, Andras Hamori, Hans Kummer, and Andrew Plaks for their comments on a draft, and to Chase Robinson for checking a manuscript for me. 43</page><page sequence="2">MICHAEL COOK prevalent one in the later centuries of pre-modern Islam. But the stan- dard early Islamic position was somewhere in between. The characte- ristic intellectual response to diversity was to stage a debate, and see who won and who lost (2). At the level of the intentions of the partici- pants, this is not in the least a truth-blind approach: we go into the debate in order to show that we are right and they are wrong. But at the level of procedure, the debate-culture is indeed truth-blind: whatever the realities of power in the society at large, the debating room is a level playing field, with the same rules for true and false believers alike (1). The text to which this paper is devoted is not a transcript of such a debate, but its literary form is a typical product of the debate-culture. The major respect in which it differs from an actual debate is that, after launching their initial attack, the false believers are given no further opportunity to participate in the argument. The second point - and this is typical of the openness of the debate- culture - is that the position maintained by the false believers throu- ghout the book from which the text is taken is one which most Muslims down the ages would have found deeply shocking. What the false belie- vers were saying was that the whole edifice of tradition was worthless, if not downright fraudulent ; we have God's word - the Koran - and once we are beyond it we are on our own (4). They advanced their views partly with general considerations about the unreliability of tradi- tion, and partly through attacks on particular traditions ("). Their typical strategy was to take two traditions from the Prophet which contradic- ted each other, and to argue that, since God's Prophet could not have said both, the traditionists had to be lying about at least one of them (6). But another possible strategy was to take a single tradition and ridicule it as so silly that it could not possibly be genuine; the text to be discus- sed is a case in point. The last of these preliminary observations concerns the social under- tones of the debate. Ibn Qutayba's lifetime was a period of acute pola- risation between the elitist religion of the theologians and populist reli- (2) This applies just as much to secular debates : is it better to be black or white ? is it in better taste to sleep with boys or girls ? (for the latter, see the text cited below, note 115).

The elitist strand in the religious attitudes of the time was eloquently expressed by the Caliph Ma'mfin in 218/833 in the decree with which he initiated the Mihna, the inquisition by which he sought to impose the abstract doctrine of the created Koran. "The Commander of the Faithful knows", he says, "that the common people..., who lack the faculty of reason..., are characterised in every region by ignorance of God, and blindness towards Him... unable to know Him properly.., because of the feebleness of their intellects and their aversion to systematic thought (")." With this uncompromising eli- tism we can contrast a passage near the beginning of the book which contains our text. There Ibn Qutayba, a traditionist and litterateur asso- ciated with the restoration of orthodoxy following the Mihna (9),offers suggestions for those in search of appropriate religious role models. He names the great traditionist scholars of the past, men like Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 241/855), and adds: "Then take your cue from the common people in every city and every age ; for it is one of the signs of the truth that their hearts are together in according with it (1')." The issue here is not socio-economic background. Ibn Qutayba was no man of the people, and his message is populism with an audibly upper-class accent ("). What is at stake is rather something we might call religious sensibility. The elite religion of the theologians is austerely rational, abs- tract, and conceptual, whereas the popular religion of the traditionists is full of tall stories, myths, and superstitions. The central issue dividing the two camps was no less than the nature of God: the transcendenta- lism of the elite was pitted against the anthropomorphism of the masses. But here this grand debate finds only a distant echo: our text depicts a skirmish over nothing more than a tall story about monkeys. Yet this humble side-show was not irrelevant to the great theological game. Such stories were just the kind of popular nonsense that an elitist could exploit to make his populist antagonist blush. (7) In this respect the traditionists of early Islam bear comparison with the monks of late antique Christianity (8) Tabari (d. 310/923), Ta'rikh, ed. MJ. de Goeje et al, Leiden 1879-1901, series III, 1112.17 (trans. C.E. Bosworth, The reunification of the 'Abbasid Caliphate (= The History of al-Tabari, vol. 32), Albany 1987, 200f ; for another transmission, see ibid., 204 n. 633). My translation does not attempt to do justice to the rhetoric of the original ; thus the Caliph refers to the common people as al-jumbifr al-a 'am wa'l-sawdd al-akbar min hashw al-ra 'iyya wa-sifat al- 'dmma.

The debate (I) Ibn Qutayba begins by giving the floor to the false believers, who proceed to launch their attack (12): ? 1. They say: "Here's a tradition which a bit of reflection (nazar) shows to be false. You transmit that some monkeys stoned a she-mon- key for adultery. And if she met the legal requirements for stoning, that makes the tradition even more elegant. And while we're thinking along these lines, who's to say that monkeys don't observe lots of the ordinances of the Torah? Maybe their religion is still Judaism. And in that case, maybe pigs are Christians!" Without question the false believers are having a field-day. Ironically going along with the tall story they have culled from tradition, they pro- ceed to introduce the legal concept of ihsan, the set of conditions that a person must satisfy to be liable for the stoning penalty for adultery in Islamic law ("). But the parallel they want to pursue is not with Islamic but with Jewish law. As Muslims were well aware, stoning is the penalty for adultery prescribed in the Torah (De. 22:22-4). There is, moreover, an undeniable connection between Jews and monkeys - undeniable, that is, for either side in this debate. As will be seen in S 7 below, the Koran speaks of God turning people who incur His displeasure into monkeys and pigs. Two other verses, not quoted there, make it clear that on at least one occasion those turned into monkeys were Jews (we shall come back to this). This enables the false believers, in their ironic vein, to suggest that perhaps the traditionists might like to think of the monkeys as still practising Judaism. And they conclude with the even- handed suggestion that maybe the pigs are doing the same for Christia- nity. This is a lot of egg on the faces of the traditionists. How are they going to get it off? At this point Ibn Qutayba - respectfully referred to as Abi Muhammad - comes to the rescue of the true believers: (12) In quoting the text I shall occasionally vary the order of the paragraphs into which I have divi- ded it; these transpositions will be clear from the numbering of the paragraphs. The text will be quo- ted in its entirety. (13) Classically these conditions are a consummated marriage, personal freedom, and belief in Islam (cf. J. Schacht, An introduction to Islamic law, Oxford 1964, 125). Culprits who do not meet these conditions are less severely punished. 46</page><page sequence="5">IBN QUTAYBA AND THE MONKEYS ? 2. AbM Muhammad says: "To this mockery we reply that the monkey tradition doesn't go back to the Prophet or his Companions. It's just something ascribed to 'Amr ibn Maymin. [It goes like this:] Muhammad ibn Khalid ibn Khiddsh related to me that Salm ibn Qutayba informed them from Hushaym from Husayn from 'Amr ibn Maymin who said: 'Back in the time before Islam a she-monkey committed adultery; so the monkeys stoned her, and I joined in' ('4)" Here, then, we have the actual tradition, duly preceded by the chain of transmission through which it comes down to Ibn Qutayba ('5). But already before quoting the tradition he has struck his first major blow for the defence. With reference to the chain of transmission, he points out that the tradition is not something the traditionists ascribe to the Prophet, or even to his Companions - it's just something transmitted from old 'Amr ibn Maymin (,6). This 'Amr was an Awdi tribesman (') who grew up in south-western Arabia before the rise of Islam; he never met the Prophet, and so never became a Companion, but he later moved to Kifa in Iraq, and, perhaps following a Ktifan fashion (1') lived to a very ripe old age, dying in 74/693f (19). His role in the conquest society of Iraq seems to have been a humble one; we learn that he was for ten years baker (khabbaz) to 'Alqama ibn Qays al-Nakha'i (d." 62/681f) (20). At the same time, he is not a figure of any great impor- (14) Zanat qirda ft 'l-Jdhiliyya fa-rajamnathd 'l-qurd wa-rajamtuhd ma 'ahum. (15) Lecomte's translation erroneously has Hashim for Hushaym; this is corrected in G.H.A. Juyn- boll and G. Lecomte, "Addenda et corrigenda" Arabica, 17 (1970), 196. Not noted there is the error found in the Arabic text, and repeated by Lecomte, whereby Salm is corrupted to Muslim (the correct form appears in the parallel in Ibn Qutayba's 'Uyan al-akhbbr, Cairo 1925-30, 2:84.2). The chain of transmission is thus: (1) 'Amr ibn MaymOn al-Awdi (K0fan, d. 74/693f) (see below, note 19); (2) Husayn ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami (K0fan, d. 136/753f) (Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalini (d. 852/1449), Tahdhib al- Tahdhib, Hyderabad 1325-7, 2:381-3); (3) Hushaym ibn Bashir al-WIsiti, d. 183/799) (ibid., 11:59-64); (4) Salm ibn Qutayba al-Sha'iri (Khurasini, settled in Basra, d. 201/816f) (ibid., 4:133f); (5) Muhammad ibn Khllid ibn Khidlsh al-Muhallabi (Basran, settled in Baghdad, no death-date given) (ibid., 9:140). For other versions and transmissions of the tradition, see below, notes 21, 69, 71-3. (16) He does not consider the question whether the ascription to 'Amr is correct. Ibn 'Abd al-Barr (d. 463/1071), by contrast, has his doubts, on the ground that the transmitters are unknown figures (majhailan) (Isti'db, ed. 'A.M. al-Bajdwi, Cairo n.d., 1205.13). (17) For the Bani Awd ibn Sa'b ibn Sa'd al-'Ashira see Ibn Hazm (d. 456/1064), Jambarat ansab al-Arab, ed. 'A.M. Hriin, Cairo 1982, 411; they were part of the tribe of Madhhij. (18) See G.H.A.

It seems to be a coincidence that 'Amr's father bore a name which later came to mean "monkey". (20) Ibn Sa'd (d. 230/845), al-Tabaqdt al-kabir, ed. E.

This is important: it means that, if we cannot succeed in vindicating him, we can still jettison him without risking the collapse of the whole edifice of transmission. In short, Ibn Qutayba has pulled off a very effective piece of damage control. At this point it might be thought that Ibn Qutayba would be wise to quit while he's ahead. But of course, if he could avoid sacrificing 'Amr, and could contrive to rehabilitate the old man and his story, that would be even better. Ibn Qutayba, who is not in the business of conceding arguments unnecessarily, is prepared to attempt this. His aim is thus to salvage the tradition itself. He goes about this by outlining two approaches to the understanding of animal behaviour which are still very much with us today. I accordingly give them their modern names: behaviourism and anthropomorphism. What I take him to be arguing is that on either approach, 'Amr and his story can be saved. He is fortunate here in that he only knows 'Amr's tradition (or only admits to knowing it) in the short form already quoted. There are also longer forms which are considerably more colourful - or to put it bluntly, much sillier. In one of these, 'Amr is looking after his family's flocks on an eminence in Yemen when a male and a female monkey appear; he rests his head on her hand [and falls asleep]. At this point a younger male appears and makes a sign to her. She gently withdraws her hand from under the head of the older male, and follows the younger one, who copulates with her while 'Amr looks on. She then returns and gently begins to reinsert her hand under the older one's cheek. He wakes up in consternation, sniffs her, and cries out. When the other monkeys gather round, he again cries out and points to her with his hand. The monkeys then exit to the right and left, and come back with the younger male ('Amr assures us that he recognised the culprit). The- reupon they dig a trench for the adulterous pair and stone them. 'Amr concludes that he had thus seen stoning among non-humans (Ti gbayr Bant Adam) (21). But Ibn Qutayba does not have to labour under the burden of all this creative detail. (21) This version is quoted by the standard commentators on Bukhdri's Sahih (Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalini (d. 852/1449), Fatt. al-bdri, Cairo 1978, 14:318.7, and cf. id., Isdba, ed. 'A.M. al-Bajdwi, Cairo 1970-2, 5:154.16; 'Ayni (d. 855/1451), 'Umdat al-qdri, Cairo 1348, 16:300.3 ; QastallAni (d. 923/1517), Irshdd al-sdri, Cairo 1304-5, 6:182.32). It is transmitted by the Jurjhni Abi Bakr al-Ismi'ill (d. 371/981). We are told only the first two transmitters from 'Amr: 'Abd al-Malik ibn Muslim al-Hanafi (a KFfan Shi'ite contemporary of Sufyin al-Thawri (see Ibn Hajar, Tahdhib, 6:4240, mentioned only by Qastallini) transmits from 'Isa ibn Hitin al-Raqashi (who is reckoned among the Basrans, see Ibn Hibbin (d. 354/965), Thiqdt, Hyderabad 1973-83, 5:2130, who in turn transmits from 'Amr himself. An earlier commentator, Kirmani (d. 786/1384), has a comparable version which he received from a Medinese scholar (al-Kawdkib al-dardri, Cairo 1934-8, 15:76.8). Two further versions are quoted by both Ibn 'Asikir (d. 571/1176) (Ta'rikh madinat Dimashq, ed. 'A. Shiri, Beirut 1995-, 46:415.21, 416.13) and Mizzi (Tahdhib, 22:265.10, 266.6). Both of the latter are transmitted from the same 'Abd al-Malik ibn Muslim: the first by Shabiba ibn Sawwir al-Fazir1 (a MadW'ini Murji'ite who died in 204/819f, ibid. 48</page><page sequence="7">IBN QUTAYBA AND THE MONKEYS We start with the behaviourist approach: ? 3. Abil Muhammad continues: "One possibility is that he did indeed see monkeys stoning a she-monkey, and inferred that they were doing this because she had committed adultery. This is something no one could know except by inference, since monkeys don't divulge what they are up to (da tunabbi' 'an anfusiha). Thus someone who observes them mounting each other can't tell whether they're com- mitting adultery or not; it's just supposition." So you can't know what monkeys are up to because they don't talk. You can see them mating, and you can see them throwing stones, but you can have no observational basis for construing a given copulation as adulterous and hence imputing a motivational link between the copula- tion and the stoning. Thus far ? 3. Let us now skip to ? 5: ? 5. "Something animals do is to engage in acts of aggression against each other, attacking and inflicting punishment. Some of them do this by biting, some by clawing, some by breaking and crushing. Monkeys use the paws which God gave them to throw stones, just as humans do. So it's not at all improbable that the monkeys engaged in the stoning for some reason which had nothing to do with adultery, and that it was the old man who imputed that motive to them." Here Ibn Qutayba comes back to the behaviourist thesis; I take his point to be that there is no problem about giving a behaviourist account of a stoning episode among monkeys, since the superficially human appea- rance of this behaviour need arise from nothing more than anatomical similarity. He will restate this point in ? 8. In other words, the charge against 'Amr is now considerably reduced: it is only that he adulterated his unimpeachable empirical observation of his monkeys by including a subjective interpretation of their motives. We are accordingly obliged to discount 'Amr as a reliable interpreter of monkey intentions. But this is 12:346.1, 349.1; for this version, see also Dhahabi (d. 748/1348), Siyar a'lam al-nubald, ed. S. al- Arna'it et al., Beirut 1981-8, 4:159.9); and the second by his reprobate contemporary 'AbdallAh ibn Abi Ja'far al-RIiz (for whom see Ibn Hajar, Tabdhib, 5:176f). A nice touch in the latter is that one of the monkeys presides over the proceedings (fa-qdma wdl.id minbum ka-hay'at al-khatib). A long version from 'Abd al-Malik ibn Muslim is mentioned by Ibn 'Abd al-Barr (Istidb, 1206.1). Qazwini (d. 682/12830 in the article qird in his cosmography gives a version of what is clearly the same story on the authority of an eye-witness described as "one of the people of San'A'"; there is no mention of 'Amr (Ajd'ib al-makhlaqdt, 264.27, apud Damiri (d. 808/1405), Haydt al-hayawan, Cairo 1970, vol. 2). The story is repeated by Ibn Fadl AllAh al-'Umari (d. 749/1359) (Masdlik al-absdrt ed. E Sezgin, Frankfurt am Main 1988-9, Book 20-21, 22.27). Most of 'Umari's entry is translated in R. Kruk, "Traditional Islamic views of apes and monkeys", in R. Corbey and B. Theunissen (ed.), Ape, man, apeman: changing views since 1600, Leiden 1995, 29 (and see ibid., 37 n. 5, citing Qazwini); this article was drawn to my attention by Maribel Fierro. 49</page><page sequence="8">MICHAEL COOK hardly the end of the world. At the time, after all, he was just a young pagan (22) minding the family flock in the savannas of south-western Arabia (23) Now we turn to the anthropomorphist approach: ? 4. "Another possibility is that the old man really did know that she had committed adultery through some indication we don't know about. After all, monkeys are the most adulterous of animals. The Arabs coin a phrase from this and say 'more adulterous than a mon- key' (24); if monkeys had not been well-known for adultery, they would not have coined the phrase. Indeed nothing resembles humans more with regard to marriage and sexual jealousy than mon- keys." On the anthropomorphist hypothesis, then, Ibn Qutayba can rehabilitate the whole tradition, the motivation included. Perhaps the old man really did know what he was talking about. After all, figuring out what a mon- key is up to is not like trying to divine the mental processes of a lobster. In particular, monkey attitudes to sexual possession really do look pretty transparent. In consequence, applying the notion of adultery to monkey society seems unproblematic. As evidence to this effect, Ibn Qutayba is proud to adduce the use by the pre-Islamic Arabs of the phrase "more adulterous than a monkey". The pre-Islamic Arabs are, of course, the arbi- ters of correct linguistic usage; what Persians or Puerto Ricans might say would be neither here nor there. Having stated this anthropomorphist line of argument in ? 4, Ibn Qutayba comes back to it in ? 6: (22) In later life he liked to tell people that he had worshipped Allat before the coming of Islam (Fasawi (d. 277/890), al-Ma'rifa wa'l-ta'rikh, ed. A.D. al-'Umari, Baghdad 1974-6, 1:228.6, 229.11; Ibn 'Asakir, Ta'rikh madinat Dimashq, 46:414.24). (23) So the long version as related by the major commentators on Bukhari. In Mizzi's versions, the context is agricultural; in the second, 'Amr has been sent to guard the family's palm trees against mon- keys (for references, see above, note 21). Christian sources describe an invasion by monkeys of the human habitat in Yemen during the reign of the Caliph Walid ibn Yazid (ruled 125-6/743-4) (see Aga- pius of Manbij (tenth century A.D.), 'Unwdn, ed.

However, these authors explain that the refe- rence is to a certain Qird (ibn Mu'5wiya), a notorious adulterer of the tribe of Hudhayl; only Maydrni adds that someone (sc. Ibn Qutayba in this very passage) states that the monkey is the most adulterous of animals, and claims that a monkey committed adultery in the Jhiliyya and was stoned for it by the other monkeys. Likewise the poet Farazdaq (d. c. 110/728) reviles some women as aznd min quriid (A.A. Bevan (ed.), The Nakd'id of jarr an anal-Farazdak, Leiden 1905-12, 773 verse 28). 50</page><page sequence="9">IBN QUTAYBA AND THE MONKEYS ? 6. "But say the old man had some reason to believe that she had committed adultery, and to attribute the stoning to this, that too is perfectly plausible, because, as I have said, monkeys are the most jea- lous of animals, and the closest in their thinking (afham) to humans." This restates the anthropomorphist argument in a more general form: of all animals, monkeys are the closest to us in their ideas - we could almost say, in their culture. So far, so good. There remains, however, a big, obvious loose end: metamorphosis. Again, it might be thought that Ibn Qutayba would be well advised to quit while he's ahead, for as we shall see, metamorpho- sis leads into alarmingly deep waters. Yet Ibn Qutayba has his reasons for wanting to press on. First, metamorphosis is implicitly part of the challenge mounted by the false believers (this is why they suggested that maybe the religion of the monkeys is "still" Judaism, and similarly for Christianity); it would thus be humiliating to duck this challenge. Second, for all its dangers, the idea is enticing - it could give valuable support to the anthropomorphist approach. For if monkeys are of human origin, it surely makes sense to look at their behaviour in human terms. But before allowing Ibn Qutayba to continue, we should break for some background. 3. Metamorphosis in Islam Metamorphosis (maskb) is a well-established idea in Islamic thought (2"). It owes this to its solid scriptural foundations (26). In one verse God tells us that He had changed humans into monkeys and pigs (Q5:60). From two other verses we learn that He had turned Sabbath- breaking Jews into monkeys - or to be absolutely literal, that He had told them to become monkeys (Q2:65, Q7:166) (7). The second of these verses provides more detail: the offenders were fishermen who (25) For a survey of the phenomenon, see Encyclopaedia of Islam, second edition, Leiden and London 1960-, art. "Maskh" (C. Pellat). For some remarks on its dietary implications, see M. Cook, "Early Islamic dietary law", Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam, 7 (1986), especially 222f. A recent study is I.

(26) The word itself appears in a verbal form (la-masakhndhum) in Q36:67, though the context of the passage does not suggest that it refers to metamorphosis. (27) It was by insisting on this distinction that Mujahid ibn Jabr (d. 104/722f), or whoever spoke for him, was able to argue that Q2:65 did not represent literal metamorphosis, but rather a manner of speaking on God's part (see, for example, Mujahid ibn Jabr, Tafsr, ed.

At first sight, all this seems clear enough. But as often, scripture raised more questions than it answered. An obvious, if rather superficial, question concerned the pigs of Q5:60. If Jews were turned into monkeys, what community was the source of the metamorphic pigs? There was a certain logic to the assumption that if the Jews had supplied one set of victims, they could also have supplied the other. Perhaps the pigs arose on the same occa- sion as the monkeys, the young Jews being turned into monkeys and the old ones into pigs (2"). Or perhaps they represented an iniquitous Israelite king and his followers upon whom God inflicted this fate in order to vindicate a righteous but unsuccessful female rebel (29).Or again, the incident could have taken place in the time of Jesus, when those who met the miracle of the Table with scepticism were threate- ned with a unique but unspecified punishment (Q5:114f) (10). All this, however, lacks a certain sense of balance. In the real world, the point of the association of Jews and monkeys was that it provided an ethnic slur for Muslims to use against their Jewish neighbours. The scholars knew kabir, Cairo c. 1934-62, 3:111.6; Ibn Kathir (d. 774/1373), Tafir, Beirut 1966, 1:184.2). This view, though widely quoted by the exegetes, is never accepted (Tabari comes out strongly against it, Tafsr, 2:173.4; cf. also Thsi, Tibydn, 1:290.22; and Ibn Kathir, Tafsir, 1:186.13, insisting that the transforma- tion was both ma'nawi and stari). The most favourable reaction is that of RIzi, who finds Mujfhid's exegesis unnecessary but not implausible (Tafsr, 3:111.21); he gives the analogy of a professor telling a dull-witted student to [go and] "be a donkey" (ibid., 111.7). In terms of Mujahid's views as we have them, his exegesis of Q2:65 cannot be taken as an attempt to deny the reality of metamorphosis across the board, since he is also quoted as saying of the monkeys and pigs of Q5:60 that "they were meta- morphosed from Jews" (musikhat min Yabidd) (Mujahid, Tafsir, 199.9; Tabari, Tafsr, 10:439 nos. 12,224f; Suyfti (d. 911/1505), al-Durr al-manthar, Cairo 1314, 2:295.6). As might be expected, non- literal interpretations of metamorphosis have enjoyed a revival among modern Koranic exegetes (Rashid Ridd (d. 1354/1935), Tafsfr al-Manar, based on lectures of Muhammad 'Abduh (d. 1323/1905), Cairo 1367-74, 1:344.1, 344.9, 345.4; Muhammad 'Izzat Darwaza (d. 1404/1984), al-Tafsir al-hadith, Cairo 1962-4, 2:177.1; Sayyid Qutb (d. 1386/1966), -I;zildl al-Qur'dn, Beirut 1973-4, 1:77.9; Ibr-him al- Qattan, Taysir al-tafsir, Amman 1982-, 1:91.10); but they are not universally accepted (Sa'id HawwR (d. 1409/1989), al-Asdsfi'l-tafsr, Cairo 1985, 1:238.2; Muhammad Jawed Maghniyya (d. 1400/1979), al- Tafsir al-kdshif, Beirut 1968-70, 1:121.22; Ndsir MakArim al-Shir-izi, al-Amthal fi tafsir kitdb Alldh al- munzal, Beirut 1992, 5:249.18, in a passage with discussion of mutation, evolution, and the like).

In their commentary to Q5:114f, the exegetes echo this view (see, for example, Muqatil, Tafir, 1:519.3; Tabari, Tafsir, 11:232 no. 13,024; Rdzi, Tafsir, 12:132.17; AbM Hayyan, Bahr, 4:62.11). However, they tend to complicate things anew by adding monkeys to pigs (see, for example, Tabari, Tafsir, 11:228f nos. 13,012, 13,014, and Tabari's own summary, ibid., 232.18; Rizi, Tafs;, 12:133.23; Abli Hayyin, Bahr, 4:61.19, 62.12). 52</page><page sequence="11">IBN QUTAYBA AND THE MONKEYS this perfectly well: according to what they transmitted, when Q5:60 was revealed, the Muslims proceeded to insult the Jews as "brothers of the monkeys and pigs", and the Jews hung their heads in shame (31). But this is terribly wasteful. What sense does it make to allocate both ani- mals to the Jews and have nothing left for the Christians? If the Jews get the monkeys, then surely the Christians should be left with the pigs. Though poorly supported in the lucubrations of academia, this com- mon-sense approach was probably widespread on the street (32).When Ibn Talib (d. 275/888f), judge of Qayrawin, decreed that Jews and Christians should wear white patches with representations of monkeys and pigs, the two communities presumably got one animal each ("3). None of this meant that the Muslims were themselves secure against the ravages of metamorphosis; but at least in their case the trauma was firmly relegated to the future (34). A second question which readily suggested itself was whether the Koranic data were to be taken as complete. In other words, are mon- keys and pigs the only animals that have been implicated in metamor- phic events? Or are they just the two examples among many that hap- pen to be mentioned in scripture? Could the domain of metamorphosis then extend to, say, hares, bears, lizards, eels, bats, and rats? This is an intriguing question, and one on which opinions differed; there was a tendency for Sunnis to minimise and Shi'ites to maximise the scope of the phenomenon ("'). This issue, however, will hardly concern us here. (31) Muqitil, Tafsir, 1:489.3; Ab'l-Layth al-Samarquandi (d. 373/983), Tafsr, ed. 'A.M.

Robson (ed. and trans.), Tracts on listening to music, London 1938, 41-6. The tradi- tionists transmit a dream in which the Mu'tazilite 'Amr ibn 'Ubayd (d. 144/761) appears metamorpho- sed into a monkey because of his heretical belief in free will (J. van Ess, Traditionistische Polemik gegen 4mr b. 'Ubaid, Beirut 1967, 26f no. 11 (= 13 no. 11, of the Arabic text); for such punishment of this heresy, cf. also Damiri, Haydt al-hiayawdn, 2:203.29). (See now below, note 142). (35) Cf. Cook, "Early Islamic dietary law", 223, 232, 236, 241. It is striking that the Imrmis could generate metamorphic eels, lizards, jerboas, and ants out the same luckless fishermen ('Ayydshi (early fourth/tenth century), Tafsr, Qumm n.d., 2:35 nos. 96f, mostly on the authority of a Koran-quoting eel). 53</page><page sequence="12">MICHAEL COOK A far more profound question than either of those considered so far was the role, if any, of metamorphosis in the origin of species (16). On the one hand, there was the strict creationist view, namely that all spe- cies originated at the creation; by implication, the world's fauna today looks pretty much as it always did, and metamorphosis has contributed nothing more than occasional fireworks without lasting residue. On the other hand, there was the metamorphist position that some species were not created at all; instead they were brought into existence through metamorphosis in later epochs, after which they enjoyed a bio- logical fitness no less than that of created species. It was, indeed, pos- sible to take the view that a large part of the animal kingdom as we now know it was the product of such metamorphic events ("). Mainstream scholarship, however, was creationist (8). Here we need go no further than the particular case of monkeys. As they apply to monkeys, the two views set out above may be spelled out as follows. A strict creationist will hold that monkeys originated at the creation, and that all the monkeys we see around us at the present day are their descendants; in this view the metamorphic monkeys whom God brought into being at a certain point are of minimal zoological significance, since they were doomed to rapid extinction without repro- ducing ("3). This, as indicated, is the mainstream view ("4). A metamor- phist, on the other hand, is likely to hold that there were no monkeys in the world as God created it, and that the entire monkey population of the world today is of metamorphic ancestry. Such metamorphists (36) For a clear and succinct statement of the issue, see Jihiz (d. 255/8680, Hayawdn, ed. 'A.M. Hirin, Cairo 193845, 4:68.6. (37) So far as I am aware, we do not encounter the view that the entire animal kingdom arose in this way. Contrast the theory set out by Plato (d. 347 B.C.) according to which women and animals are products of devolution from men (Timaeus, 90e-92c = (Euvres compl&amp;tes, Paris 1920-64, 10:226-8; I think I owe this reference to Larry Conrad). (38) Thus the Hanafi AbO'l-Layth al-Samarqandi (d. 373/983) outlines metamorphism as the view of "some" and creationism as that of the scholars in general (Bustdn al-'drifin, printed in the margin of his Tanbibh al-ghdfiltn, Cairo n.d., 191.2). (39) For a firm creationist position attributed to Ibn 'Abbis, see Tabari, Tafsir, 2:169.7 no. 1138 (this text is translated in Lichtenstadter, "'And become ye accursed apes"', 158f, but ascribed there to Tabari himself), and Ibn Kathir, Tafsr, 1:184.16; cf. also Tisi, Tibydn, 5:20.9 (but contrast the views ascribed to Ibn 'Abbas in Suytti, Durr, 1:75.32, and Ibn Qutayba, Ta'wil, 167.7 = trans. Lecomte, 152 ?172a). For similar statements from the Prophet and other early authorities, see, for example, T-si, Tibyan, 5:20.10; Ibn Kathir, Tafsir, 2:602.7; Suyiti, Dur, 2:295.7 (and the two traditions which follow there); Bahrfini (d. 1107/1695f), al-Burhan fl tafsIr al-Qur'dn, Tehran 1375, 1:107.17, 2:43.7 (from 'All ibn al-Husayn (d. 94/712f)); and see below, note 59. (40) Where the Koranic commentators pronounce on the issue in their own voices, they endorse creationism (Tisi, Tibydn, 5:20.12; Rdzi, TafsIr 3:112.3, pronouncing both views reasonable in them- selves, but settling the question by adducing the view of Ibn 'Abbis; Qurtubi, Jdmi', 1:441.5). Similarly Ibn .Hajar calls metamorphism a deviant view (madhhbbab shbdhdb), and states it as the view of the majority that traditions from the Prophet suggesting the survival of metamorphic populations into his own time represent the ill-informed opinion of the younger Muhammad, later corrected by revelation (Ibn H.ajar, Fath al-bart, 14:318.14). 54</page><page sequence="13">IBN QUTAYBA AND THE MONKEYS exist, but they are rare (41). Hasan al-Basri (d. 110/728) may have been one of them (42). Kisd'i, the unidentified author of a work of the "tales of the prophets" genre, was certainly a metamorphist: "The monkeys in the world", he tells us, "are descended from these monkeys, namely the ones who transgressed the Sabbath" (43). But by far the most distingui- shed metamorphist is the Andalusian Mhliki Abil Bakr ibn al-'Arabi (d. 543/1148), who argues strongly that metamorphics reproduce (44). In the twentieth century - even the late twentieth century - this whole approach tends to strike us as bizarre, whereas creationism, whe- ther we believe in it or not, is at least familiar. It is therefore worth poin- ting out a significant structural affinity between metamorphism and our own evolutionary perspective. Metamorphosis does for its proponents two things that evolution does for us: it establishes a genetic relation- ship between man and monkey which strict creationism precludes; and it allows for species to come into existence at different epochs over the course of the history of the world. Of these it is the first that interests us here. Should we accept a genetic link between men and monkeys, the next question would be whether such a link could be not just genetic but also cultural. It does not take much imagination to see that post- metamorphic trauma is likely to bring about considerable degradation in the culture of its victims. Yet this need not mean total loss. We do in fact possess some relevant testimony (though the false believers would doubtless have rejected it). There are traditions describing the after- math of the metamorphosis of Jews into monkeys referred to in Q7: 166, an event which is usually located in the town of Ayla at the head of the Gulf of 'Aqaba (45). These traditions describe how the virtuous inhabi- tants of the town, who had of course been spared (Q7: 165), found their erring fellow-citizens transformed into monkeys. What is clear from this (41) A scholar who seems to be wrongly accused of metamorphism is the philologist Zajjdj (d. 311/923) (Ibn Hajar, Fath al-bdri, 14:318.15; 'Ayni, 'Umdat al-qdri, 16:300.15). He quotes the deviant view as one of the two which have been advanced, but does not endorse it (see his Madani al-Qur'dn wa-i'rdbuhu, ed. 'A.'A. Shalabi, Beirut and Sidon 1973-4, 2:427.16). Ibn 'Atiyya (d. c. 541/1146) (al- Muharrar al-wajfz, Beirut 1993, 2:470.23) and Qurtubi (Jami, 1:440.19) quote Zajjdj for the deviant view, but do not attribute it to him. (42) T[isi, Tibydn, 5:20.8. But contrast the position ascribed to him in Suyiiti, Durr, 1:75.32. (43) Kisi'i, Qisa. al-anbiyda' 275.22. He adds that in the same way the pigs, all of them, are des- cended from those who were metamorphosed on the occasion of the miracle of the Table. The pas- sage is cited in H. Eisenstein, Einfuibrung in die arabische Zoographie, Berlin 1991, 13. (44) Ibn al-'Arabi (d. 543/1148), Ahkam al-Qur'dn, ed. 'A.M. al-Bajawi, Cairo 1957-8, 788.6. What is not clear is whether he thought that all existing monkeys were of metamorphic origin. His view is widely cited, though never approved (Qurtubi,Jami, 1:441.5, with negative comment ; Abi Hayyan, Batr, 1: 410.3, without comment; Ibn Hajar, Fati al-bdri, 14:318.15, condemning the view as deviant; 'Ayni, 'Umdat al-qdri, 16:300.15, with a less dogmatic reaction). (45) See, for example, Tabari, Tafsr, 13:180f nos. 15,252-9; other views are given ibid., 181f nos. 15, 260f. 55</page><page sequence="14">MICHAEL COOK testimony is that the victims had lost the active use of human language, but retained the ability to understand it, and were able to respond to it by the use of gesture (41). In one particularly impressive report, meta- morphic monkeys were even able to communicate a figurative use of language in this way (47). Against this, they had apparently lost the abi- lity to unlock a gate ("4). But on the evidence taken as a whole, it would have been unwise to rule out some degree of cultural continuity across the metamorphic barrier. Alongside this empirical evidence, there is also a significant argument from the logic of divine wisdom. Metamorphosis is a punishment (49). Now as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d. 606/1210) points out, "monkeyness" (qir- diyya) is not in itself a distressing condition, the proof of this being that monkeys in good health are not distressed by it ("). Being monkeys is what monkeys do best. Metamorphic monkeys must therefore differ significantly from real ones (qurafd asliyya). We must suppose that des- pite their loss of the capacity for speech and other human actions, the victims of metamorphosis retain the intellectual faculties which make a human a rational person (insdnan 'dqilan fdhiman), and are thus still able to comprehend the horror of what has befallen them C"). (46) See, for example, ibid., 189.13 (no. 15,272), 196.11 (no. 15,283); Maturidi (d. c. 333/944), Ta'wtldt ahl al-sunna, ed. M. Mustafid al-Rahman, Dacca 1982-, 1:165.15; Samarqandi, Tafsir, 1:578.4; Tha'labi, Qisas, 256.19; Kisi'i, Qisas 275.19; Wdihidi (d. 468/1076), Wasit, ed. 'A.A.

Many of these passages also mention that the vic- tims could still recognise their human relatives. (47) A monkey would gesture to its hands, as if to say "through what they have earned" (fa-yimi'u ild yadayhi bi-md kasabat yaddya, Suyitii, Durn, 3:139.1); cf. also Tabari, Tafsr, 13:196.11. (48) It is a common feature of these reports that on the morning after the catastrophe the human survivors only learn the fate of the victims by climbing a wall and looking over it, the victims having failed to open their gate or gates (see, for example, Tabari, Tafsir, 13:189.11, 193.11; Ibn Kathir, Tafsir, 1:186.9); the humans open the gates for the monkeys, who then leave (see, for example, ibid., 186.10). That the monkeys were in fact unable to open the gates is explicitly stated in one version of the story (SuyOtti, Durr, 3:138.14). This is perhaps surprising: Abu, a Hamadryas baboon brought up by an eccen- tric but observant sculptress, was able to turn a key to unlock a gate (Julie Macdonald, Almost human, Philadelphia and New York 1965, 63). (49) Q2:66 refers to it as "a punishment exemplary" (nakal), while Q7:165 speaks of "evil chasti- sement" (adhdb bat's). (50) Rdzi, Tafsir, 3:111.26. (51) Ibid., 111.27. The essence of this argument appears already in Mituridi, Ta'wildt, 1:165.11. He sets out two rival views: according to one, the metamorphosis of Q2:65 involved the total loss of the humanity of the victims (dhahab al-insdniyya minhum); according to the other, their substance (jau- bar) was transformed into that of monkeys, but their humanity (insdniyya) - their intellectual capa- cities (al-fahm wa'l-aql) - remained. Mlturidi then supports the second position with two argu- ments: the fact that the victims are reported to have been distraught on the morning after the transformation, which they would not have been had they entirely lost their humanity; and the fact that their metamorphosis was intended as a punishment. Cf. also Abt Hayyan, Bahr, 1:409.21; Kirmsni, Kawdkib, 15:75.20; Ibn Hajar, Fath al-bdri, 14:318.20; and PE. Walker, "The doctrine of metempsy- chosis is Islam", in WB.

If, he tells us, it is objected to 'Amr's tradition that it implies the transmission of some knowledge of revealed law (ma'drifal-shard'i) among the monkeys from generation to generation down to the time of 'Amr, then we reply that this is exactly how it was. The human Jews, as was well-known, had had the temerity to abandon the stoning penalty for adultery long before the rise of Islam. God's purpose, in a dazzling display of divine ingenuity, was to preserve the original law unchanged among their metamorphic kin as evidence against them (1). No one who takes an interest in the survival of cultural archaisms among marginal populations could fail to be struck by the elegance of this idea. The scholars, however, were not impres- sed; Qurtubi (d. 671/1273) dismissed Ibn al-'Arabi's views with the tart comment that "there is no proof of any of this" (C). Quite apart from the question of proof, they had some reason to be cautious. For once we open the door to religious law for one activity of one animal species, where is this nonsense going to stop (4)? Fortunately it was also possible to combine the best of both worlds. One suggestion seems to have been that the particular monkeys obser- ved by 'Amr (but not, one assumes, monkeys at large) might have been of metamorphic descent, or even actual victims; this would then explain the retention of stoning as a punishment for adultery among the group in question ("). Another view, perhaps the most sophisticated of all, was put forward by Ibn Hajar al-'Asqal~ni (d. 852/1449). He did not take issue with the strict creationists on the genetic aspect of things. But he did suggest that the metamorphic monkeys, before dying out, might have mixed with the real ones (al-qirada al-asliyya), and passed on some of their culture to them - monkeys being a notoriously imitative species. In this way real monkeys could have acquired and preserved a metamorphic heritage ('). (52) Ibn al-'Arabi, Ahkdm, 788.14. The editor has misplaced a crucial comma in line 15: for 'Umar, wa-qulna, read Am,; qulnd (53) Qurtubi, Jgimi', 1:441.19 (wa-ld /iujja fl shay' minbu). (54) One reason why Ibn 'Abd al-Barr dislikes 'Amr's tradition is that the scholars at large reject the notions that we can speak of adultery in the case of a creature that is not legally competent (mukal- laf), and that the set punishments (hudad) can be applied to beasts. He is not, of course, questioning the relevance of such categories for thejinn (Isti'db, 1206.2). (55) That they were actual victims was one of two possibilities advanced by Kirmini (Kawdkib, 15:75.20). That they might have been of metamorphic descent was suggested by 'Abd al-Wihid ibn al- Tin aI-Safaqusi (Ibn Hajar, Fath al-bari, 14:318.12, suggesting that he did not pursue the idea; 'Ayni, 'Umdat al-qdri, 16:300.7).

We can now return to our text. 4. The debate (II) Where then does Ibn Qutayba position himself with regard to the question of metamorphosis? ? 7. Abii Muhammad continues: "My own opinion is that monkeys are actual metamorphics which have reproduced. My proof of this is God's words (Q5:60): Say: 'Shall I tell you of a recompense with God, worse than that? Whomsoever God has cursed, and with whom He is wroth, and made some of them the monkeys and the pigs (al-qiradata wa'l-khandzira).' Here the presence of the definite article in 'the monkeys' and 'the pigs' shows these nouns to be definite, and that the reference is to the monkeys which we actually see today. Had He been referring to something already extinct, He would have said: 'and made some of them monkeys and pigs (qiradatan wa-khandzira)' ('). Unless, of course, Umm Habiba's tradition about metamorphics is genuine - in which case the matter is as the Prophet said there ("). [In any case], we're not saying that they acted the way they did because they were aware of the ordinance of the Torah, as the mockers would have it." (57) For those curious as to the fate of metamorphics in the next world, I should perhaps mention that on the Day of Resurrection God will return them to their human forms; however, any comfort they may derive from this will be short-lived, as they will then be dispatched to hell (Tha'labi, Qisas, 256.23). (58) Some thought that this, or something close to it, was what God had in fact said. Whereas the 'Uthminic codex reads waja'ala ininhumu' 1-qiradata wa'l-kbandzira, Ibn Mas'Fd (d. 32/652f) and Ubayy ibn Ka'b (d. 22/642f) read wa-jaalahum qiradatan wa-khandzira (A. Jeffery, Materials for the history of the text of the Qur'an, Leiden 1937, 39, 129). (59) Umm Habiba bint Jahsh was the sister of the Prophet's wife Zaynab. Lecomte was unable to identify the tradition referred to, but it must have been similar in content to that which Ibn Mas'id transmits from the Prophet on the subject (see for example Ibn Hazm (d. 456/1064), Muhalla, ed. A.M. Shikir, Beirut n.d., 7:432.7, 432.11). Now versions of this latter tradition are found appended to a tra- dition of Umm Habiba of quite different content (Muslim ibn al-Hajjij (d. 261/875), Sahtih, ed. M.E 'Abd al-Biqi, Cairo 1955-6, 2051.5, 2051.16). Despite the fact that these appended versions are not stated to be transmitted by Umm H.abiba herself, their association with a tradition she does transmit may account for Ibn Qutayba's wording. 58</page><page sequence="17">IBN QUTAYBA AND THE MONKEYS Ibn Qutayba, then, is a metamorphist, albeit a cautious one. He bases his position not on wild zoological speculation but on sober linguistic ana- lysis of a Koranic verse. And he expresses a proper willingness to aban- don his view if it is established that the Prophet himself affirmed the extinction of metamorphics. Above all, he studiously refuses to explore the theologically disquieting notion that monkeys might preserve Jewish observances. This is a prudent course to take, though of course it misses out on much of the fun. Even without the fun, though, one might have expected him to exploit the genetic link he has established to enhance the plausibility of the view that monkeys think rather like us. In fact he chooses at this point to fall back on the behaviourist approach: S 8. "What we do say is that they inflicted punishment by stoning - for whatever reason, adultery or otherwise - because of their paws, just as other animals claw, bite or break; the point is that their paws resemble those of humans, and the only way in which a human could inflict harm at a distance is by throwing stones." His explanation of the seemingly human behaviour of 'Amr's monkeys is thus at bottom anatomical, not cultural. He remains, nevertheless, an adherent of genetic metamorphism, as he shows in his parting shot: S 9. "A further indication that monkeys are a metamorphic species is the existence of a consensus that their flesh is forbidden, despite the absence of any scriptural text or tradition to this effect, in the same way that there is a consensus that human flesh is forbidden despite the absence of such a text." So the tabu on eating the flesh of monkeys points to their human ori- gin (0). This is not, as might appear at first sight, an argument from comparative anthropology which could be refuted by reference to the dietary habits of the Cantonese. The point is that the prohibition is something the Muslim community agree on, which means that there must be good reason for them to do so. And what good reason could there be other than a genetic link between the two species? (60) On the question why eating monkey flesh is not expressly forbidden in the Kuran, see Jdhiz, H.ayawdn, 4:40.5. Some claimed that the pre-Islamic Arabs did not eat it, as it is unpleasant enough to forbid itself; a prohibition would thus have been otiose (see also ibid., 61.3). For some legal opinions on eating monkey, which are not as solidly against it as Ibn Qutayba's argument would require, see Damiri, H aydt al- haydwan, 2:205.6 (saying that most Mdlikis consider it permitted); 'Abd al-Razzaq, Musannaf, 4:529 no. 8,745; Ibn Abi Shayba (d. 235/849), Musannaf ed.

Ibn Qutayba and his likes on the one hand, and Nazzam and his likes on the other, are people who understand each other and have a lot in common. Ibn Qutayba might like to present him- self as a populist, but the fact is that in his profligate youth he had fre- quented the circles of the elitists ("'), studying with as objectionably cle- ver a member of that set as Jhi7z (62). Indeed he makes use of this background in his argument -Jhiiz, as might be expected, is the source of some of his zoology (01). The people who transmitted the tall stories Ibn Qutayba had to defend were somewhere to his right, and refused even to speak to people like Nazzim. There were likewise people to the left of Nazz~m, the Dahriyya for whom not even the Koran was an authority. With such people, as not with Ibn Qutayba, Nazz.m had to insist on the reality of metamorphosis (1). Some of them - we might dub them the soft-shell Dahriyya - were prepared to accept the idea of a kind of metamorphosis through gradual environmental change (as with the process whereby blacks become black and blonds become blond) (6'); implicitly they rejected as silly the idea of punctuated meta- morphosis brought about by divine agency. Others - the hard-shell Dah- riyya - rejected even this watered-down environmental conception ((). None of these extremist trends is given a voice in our debate, but they are nevertheless within earshot. 5. The disquieting legacy of Bukhiri The versions of 'Amr's tradition fall into two groups: the long and the short. We have already glanced at the long versions ("7), and there is no need to return to them here. Of the short versions we have so far (61) Ibn Qutayba, Ta'wil, 74.9 = trans. Lecomte, 68f ?78. (62) He had a licence (ijaza) from J.hiz to transmit his Bukhald (see Lecomte, Ibn Qutayba, 58, 194). Cf. his denunciation of Jlhiz as too clever by half (Ta'wil, 71.7 = trans. Lecomte, 65 ? 72). (63) Jahiz notes the strength of marriage (shiddat al-zawdj) and the sexual jealousy (gbhayra 'all- azwdj) prevalent among monkeys, observing that monkeys combine both virtues in a way not found among other non-human animals (Haya'wdn, 4:98.8, 98.12; the passage is paraphrased in Eisenstein, Einfiihbrung in die arabische Zoographie, 123); this latter statement is echoed by Ibn Qutayba in ano- ther of his works ('Uyiin, 2:84.4). Elsewhere Jahiz remarks incidentally that the monkey is an adulterer (al-qird zdni, Hayawdn, 6:46.12). For Ibn Qutayba's use of the Hayawan generally, see Lecomte, Ibn Qutayba, 58f, 195. (64) J~hiz Hayawdn, 4:73.6, 74.1 (translated in J. van Ess, Theologie und Geselwwchaft im 2. und 3. ahrhbundert Hidschra, Berlin and New York 1991-7, 6:175 no. 234). (65) Jahiz Hayawdn, 4:70.9, 73.3.

One is trans- mitted by Khard'iti (d. 327/938f) (0), who was known as a great collec- tor of curious and recondite information (al-mulah wa'l-nawddir) C)). Another is known to us only from a passing reference (C). But by far the most important from the point of view of posterity was a version on which Bukhdri (d. 256/870) conferred near-canonical status by inclu- ding it in his famous collection of traditions (C). Here 'Amr's words are as follows: "In the time before Islam I saw a she-monkey against whom other monkeys gathered together; she had committed adultery, so they stoned her, so I joined in" (73). Ibn Qutayba was some twenty years youn- ger than Bukhdri C(), so we can presume that the tradition was already firmly in place in the Sahih during Ibn Qutayba's lifetime. There is, however, no compelling reason to believe that he had even heard of Bukhdri, who was, after all, just a provincial scholar from the north-east. Thus for Ibn Qutayba, the question why Bukhari should have included such a tradition in his collection was not yet an issue. But by the end of the fourth/tenth century, times were changing C'): Bukhari's Sahih, along with that of Muslim (d. 261/875), was now on the way to beco- ming one of the two most authoritative books in Islam after the Koran (6). It was thus Bukhdri, not Ibn Qutayba, who was responsible for the embarrassment of the scholars down the centuries. How were (68) See above, note 14. (69) Khara'iti, Masawi' al-akhldq, ed. M.'A. 'At., Beirut 1993, 208 no. 490 (zanat qirda bi'l-Yaman fa-rajamahba'-qurad fa-rajamtubd ma'abum), whence Ibn 'Asdkir, Ta'rikh madtnat Dimashq, 46:415.15 (with the reading ra'aytu qirda...). In Khar'iti's isndd the transmitter from Husayn ibn 'Abd al-Rahman (see above, note 15) is the Wsiti 'All ibn 'Asim al-Taymi (d. 201/816) (for whom see Ibn Hajar, Tabdhbib, 7:344-8). (70) See Sam',ni (d. 562/1166), Ansdb, ed. 'A. al-Mu'allimi al-Yamini, Hyderabad 1962-82, 5:75.5. (71) Ibn 'Abd al-Barr mentions a short version transmitted by 'Abbd ibn al-'AwwAm (a Shi'ising Wdsiti, d. 185/801f, see Ibn Hajar, Tabdhbb, 5:99f) from Husayn ibn 'Abd al-Rahmin (Istif'b, 1205.17); but he does not quote the text. Incidentally, Ibn Hajar at one point refers to a saying of AbM Raji' al- 'Utiridi beginning: "I saw a she-monkey commit adultery in the Jhiliyya" (Fath al-bari, 14:303.24). This Abfi Raji' is a figure somewhat similar to 'Amr, except that he settled in Basra and lived even lon- ger, dying in 107/725f or so at an age of 120 or more (Ibn Hajar, Tabdhib, 8:140f); but I cannot trace such a tradition in the biographical sources, and suspect confusion. (72) Bukhari, Sah.lz, ed. L. Krehl, Leiden 1862-1908, 3:20.18 (= mandqib al-Ans@r, ch. 27). Bukhri, transmits the tradition from Nu'aym ibn Hammd (d. 228/843), who has it from Hushaym with the same chain of transmitters as Ibn Qutayba. In another transmission recorded by Bukhari, a Wasiti or Kiifan called AbO Balij appears alongside Husayn between 'Amr and Hushaym (Bukhri, al-Ta'rkhb al- kabir, Hyderabad 1360-78, 3:2:367.7 (no. 2,661); for Abo Bali, see Ibn Hajar, Tabdhib, 12:47); here there is no mention of adultery.

(74) The date of Ibn Qutayba's birth is given as 213/828f (Lecomte, Ibn Qutayba, 31), that of Bukhri as 194/810 (Ibn Hajar, Tabdhbb, 9:48.14). (75) I take this dating from J.

We ourselves do not need to look very far for an explanation. The clue is the context in which the tradition appears. This context is not, as might have been anticipated, that of the heavy Prophetic traditions on the stoning penalty for adultery. Instead, 'Amr's reminiscence is tucked away near the end of a section that collects accounts of interesting things people got up to in pre-Islamic Arabia (7). Many of these traditions, like ours, are not from the Prophet, and they do not serve to establish points of dogmatic or legal significance (7). In other words, they contain infor- mation of antiquarian interest, and the response they invite is typically of the form: "No, really? You don't say C~)!" To understand what these tra- ditions are doing here, we have to come to terms with the fact that BukhAri was a teacher. Students are typically young, and their minds wander; after all, they live in a world in which there are more colourful things than books. A successful teacher has to know how to lighten up on occasion, and that, I suggest, is exactly what Bukhari was doing here. One would have to take a dim view of Bukhdri and his students to sup- pose that his transmission of 'Amr's tradition failed to make them laugh ("). The same was doubtless true for anyone else who transmitted it, including 'Amr himself, if it does indeed go back to him. And why not ("')? But this simple explanation was not an option for the scholars. (77) Bukhdri, Sahilh, 3:16-21. Here the section is divided between a bdb ayydm al-Jahiliyya and a bdb al-qasama fl'l-Jhiliyya, with 'Amr's tradition as the last but one of the latter. Humaydi (d. 488/1095), however, seems to have referred to both babs together as the kitdb ayyam al-Jdhiliyya (see Qurtubi,. Jnmi, 1:442.2, and Damiri, Haydt al-hayawan, 2:204.14, both quoting Hjumaydi's unpubli- shed Jam' bayna'l-Sahljiayn, for which see C. Brockelmann, Geschichte der Arabischen Litteratur, supplementary volumes, Leiden 1937-42, 1:578f; second edition, Leiden 1943-9, 1:413; E Sezgin, Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums, Leiden 1967-, 1:142). It is in any case clear that the two chap- ters form a thematic unit, and that the second chapter heading (which is apt only for the long tradition which immediately follows it) is best omitted; Ibn Hajar, who shares this view, states that the heading did not in fact appear in the recension of the Sahihi transmitted from Bukhdri by Nasafi (d. 295/908), (Fati al-bdri, 14:312.21; so also 'Ayni, 'Umdat al-qdri, 16:296.6). Most of these traditions describe the activities of humans, so that it is perhaps 'Amr's participation in the stoning, rather than the activity of the monkeys themselves, that qualifies the tradition for inclusion here. On the other hand, one tradi- tion describes a flood, and another a good deed performed by a kite. (78) Several traditions include within them statements from the Prophet or material directly rela- ted to dogmatic or legal questions; but this is clearly incidental to the reasons for which the traditions are placed in this section. In only one case is the Prophet the authority for the information on pre-Isla- mic matters (Bukhdri, Sahihl, 3:18.12). (79) Compare the longer versions of our tradition transmitted by Ibn 'Asikir and Mizzi, where 'Amr comes up with the story because someone asks him to recount the most amazing thing (ajab shay) he had ever seen in pre-Islamic times (for references, see above, note 21). (80) Compare the comical reminiscence 'Amr ibn Salima al-Jarmi (d. 85/704f) which appears in Bukhiri, Sahl7i, 3:144.5. (81) Bukhfri in his al-Adab al-mufrad transmits three traditions on laughter (ed. K.Y al-Hat, Beirut 1984, 99f nos. 252-4). In the first two the Prophet tells the believers not to laugh too much ; in the third, he makes them miserable with such talk, whereupon God reproves him for this (lima tuqnit 'ibddlhi cf. Q39:53), and the Prophet dutifully tells his followers to cheer up. For God's own laughter 62</page><page sequence="21">IBN QUTAYBA AND THE MONKEYS The discussion seems to have begun with Humaydi (d. 488/1095), an Andalusian scholar who wrote a work combining the contents of the two Sah.ihs (82). HIumaydi was clearly embarrassed by the tradition, since he questioned whether it belonged in the Sahih at all (H"). He pointed out that it was found in some copies of the book, but not in others 0(), and suggested that it might have been a later interpolation (min al- muqhamat) ("5). He was not alone in this: Ibn al-Athir (d. 630/1233) likewise held the tradition to be intrusive (1). But this was a perilous course, tantamount to an attack on the textual integrity of the Sahih. As Ibn H:ajar pointed out, once we make an exception, the whole work will start to unravel, and no one will be able to rely on anything in the book (1). His position in turn was queried by 'Ayni (d. 855/1451) (), who did not like him, but the alternative was not reassuring. How then and Ibn Qutayba's discussion of it, see his Ta'wil, 266.4 = trans. Lecomte, 235f S?233f. For Ibn Qutay- ba's defence of elite jesting, see his Adab al-kdtib, ed. M. al-Khatib, Cairo 1346, 11.18 (on the jesting of the Prophet and other early Muslims), 13.2 (on mazh al-ashrdf wa-dhawi'l-muria't). For a helpful overview of norms relating to laughter in early Islamic religious literature in general, see E. Rowson in Journal of the American Oriental Society, 115 (1995), 491-3 (reviewing L. Ammann, Vorbild und Ver- nunft: Die Regelung von Lachen und Scherzen im mittelalterlichen Islam, Hildesheim 1993). (82) For his Jam' bayna'l-Sahihayn, see above, note 77. The work is arranged by musnads. I have not had access to the relevant volume (the last?), and so know his discussion only from quotations in later sources. (See now below, note 142). (83) Qurtubi, .ldmi, 1:441.20-442.7; Damiri, H.aydt al-hayawdn, 2:204.10-19 (close to Qurtubi's ver- sion and doubtless deriving from it); Ibn Hajar, Fatli al-bari, 14:319.7f (much abbreviated); 'Ayni, 'Umdat al-qdri, 16:300.11-13 (doubtless from Ibn .Hajar). .Humaydi's starting-point is a mention of Bukhdri's inclusion of the story by Abil Mas'fld al-Dimashqi (d. 400/1010), a scholar known for his interest in the two Sahizis (see Dhahabi (d. 748/1348), Tadhkirat al-huffd;, Hyderabad 1968-70, 1069.3). There is no indication that AbO Mas'Od had ventured a comment. (84) The details are confused. In Qurtubi's version, Humaydi states that the tradition is not found in the transmission of Nu'aymi from Firabri. Firabri (d. 320/932) is the source of all surviving trans- missions of the Sahih, but there was no Nu'aymi among those who transmitted from him (see Fick, "Beitrige", 62 no.1, for Firabri, and 64-6 nos. 5-14, for the transmitters from him). Damiri's version omits the reference to Nu'aymi, which solves a small problem, but leaves us with a larger one, namely that it is precisely the transmission of Firabri that contains the tradition; according to the commenta- tors on Bukhiri, it was Nasafi's transmission that lacked it (Ibn Hajar, Fathi al-badr, 14:319.11; 'Ayni, 'Umdat al-qdri, 16:300.22; Qastallini, Irshad al-sari, 6:182.31 (quoting Ibn Hajar); also Ibn Hajar, Isdba, 5:155.7 (read Firabri for Azizi and Nasafi for Sabi'O); for Ibn Hajar's knowledge of Nasafis recen- sion, which was indirect, see Fick, "Beitrige", 63, no. 3). (85) This, of course, left the problem of the presence of the tradition in Bukhari's Kabir (see above, note 72). Humaydi's solution was that Bukhiri must have adduced the tradition there in order to esta- blish that 'Amr had lived in the Jahiliyya, and not because he set any value on the zoological specula- tions in which 'Amr engaged at the time (wa-lam yubdli bi--annihi'lladhbi annahu fi'l:Jhiliyya) (86) Ibn al-Athir, Usd al-ghaba, Cairo 1280-6, 4:134.20 (wa-hddbd mimmd udkhila fi Sahllih al- Bukhar). (87) Ibn .Hajar, Fathi al-bdri, 14:319.13. He likewise expresses his amazement at .Humaydi's view in his Isdba, 5:155.7. (88) 'Ayni, 'Umdat al-qdri, 16:300.24. 'Ayni was also unkind enough to point out that Humaydi had a more extensive and exact knowledge of the texts of the Sa/.ih than Ibn Hajar (ibid., 300.20); to this Ibn Hajar responded by repeating his argument (Intiqdd al-i'tircd f'T-radd 'ald'l-'Ayni ft sharhi al- Bukbhar, ed. H.'A. al-Salafi and SJ. al-SamarrAi', Riyid 1993, 2:300.11; this work was drawn to my atten- tion by Vardit Tocatly). 63</page><page sequence="22">MICHAEL COOK were scholars who regarded the tradition as an integral part of the Sahih to understand its presence there? We have already encountered one reaction, that of Ibn al-'Arabi, for whom it was an absolutely splendid tradition ("'). But as we saw, his enthusiasm was not infectious. This left no choice but to accept the tradition and find some way to neutralise its most disquieting feature. 'Amr, it is assumed, will have reported accura- tely what he saw; but the appearance of adultery and stoning (siarat al- zind wa'l-rajm) which he witnessed need not imply that either was real (C). How Ibn Hajar thought this appearance might have come about has been seen above ("9). But whether the scholars chose to query the canonical status of the tradition or to interpret it away, with the excep- tion of Ibn al-'Arabi their fundamental concern was damage control. 6. A comparative perspective By way of conclusion, it is worth attempting to place the debate over 'Amr's tradition in some kind of comparative perspective. In doing this I shall concentrate mainly on the phase represented by Ibn Qutayba and his anonymous antagonists. Let us start by looking at some of the ways in which the type of thinking we find in this text is both familiar and alien to us. Several things look familiar. One is the sceptical attitude towards tra- dition which underlies the attack mounted by the false believers, and in turn constrains the thinking of those who would defend tradition. To see such views as the invention of the enlightened or demonic forces of Orientalism is to credit ourselves with too much originality: radical scepticism towards tradition was well-developed in third/ninth-century Islam, though on its way out (2). More generally, we are looking at an elite culture which was to a significant extent committed to working things through in the cool light of reason. Either things are like this or they are like that, and to decide which, we invoke logic and evidence. This is not a world-view suffused with some ineffable spirituality: there (89) See above, note 52. (90) Ibn Hajar, Fath al-bdri, 14:319.5. Ayni snipes at this C'Umdat al-qdri, 16:300.17), but Qastallfin repeats it (Irshdd al-sdri, 6:183.9). This view goes back to Kirmani, who advanced it as one of two sug- gestions (Kawdkib, 15:75.20; for the other suggestion, see above, note 55); 'AynT quotes Kirmani without protest ('Umdat al-qdri, 16:300.9). (91) See above, note 56. (92) It is doubtless for this reason that Ibn Qutayba's work, though it survived reasonably well (Lecomte notes a dozen manuscripts of it, Ibn Qutayba, 137f), seems to be the only book of its kind that we possess. By contrast, a traditionist genre such as the explanation of the rare words found in tra- ditions (gbarib al-hadith) continues to be cultivated down the centuries. 64</page><page sequence="23">IBN QUTAYBA AND THE MONKEYS is no Great Chain of Being (9), no cosmic balance of Yin and Yang, no post-modernist fog 0). On the contrary, the debate culture at its best is a stimulus to lean and disciplined thought. Whether monkeys arise from creation or metamorphosis is not a question to be met with mystifica- tion or transcended on some higher plain of wisdom. Instead we answer it as best we can on the evidence available. This elite culture had little chance of success in cleansing the Augean stables of popular supersti- tion, but at the time it had strong resonance even outside the Islamic community (9). Another thing that looks familiar is the approach to animal beha- viour. We have already noted the appearance in Ibn Qutayba's argument of a methodological issue much discussed in the modern literature about monkeys, the tension between the behaviourist and anthropo- morphist approaches to deciphering their behaviour @() But what of the actual observation of monkeys as we find it in our text? Before going fur- ther, we should pause for some zoological background. In our text, as generally in Arabic literature, we are not talking about monkeys at large, still less the anthropoid apes. The monkey which caught the attention of the Arabs before and after the rise of Islam was (93) This Neoplatonic heritage (for which see A.O. Lovejoy, The Great Chain of Being New York 1960, especially 59, 61-3) was well represented elsewhere in Islamic culture, and with explicit refe- rence to the place of monkeys at the border between animals and humans (see Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safd, ed. K. al-Zirikli, Cairo 1928, 4:317.3; Miskawayh (d. 421/1030), al-Fawz al-aghar, Beirut 1319, 90.9 (with sharp qualification); Muhyi 'l-Din ibn al-'Arabi (d. 638/1240), 'Uqlat al-mustawfiz, in H.S. Nyberg (ed.), Kleinere Schriften des Ibn al-4rabi, Leiden 1919, 93.14 of the Arabic text; Ibn Khaldon (d. 808/1406), Muqaddima, ed. M. Quatrembre, Paris 1858, 1:174.4, 2:373.9. All these passages are refer- red to in Kruk, "Traditional Islamic views of apes and monkeys", 31f, or in sources there cited. (94) Contrast the rich admixture of culturally exotic and scientifically worthless material which prevails in the entry which the late medieval Damiri devotes to the monkey in his zoological reference- book (Haydt al-hayawan, 2:200-6), or even the account of the monkeys of Yemen given by Mas'rdi (d. 345/956) (Muraj al-dhahab, ed. C. Pellat, Beirut 1965-74, 1:232-4 nos. 485, 488f). For these accounts, see Kruk, "Traditional Islamic views of apes and monkeys", 34, 35, and 37 n. 5.

(96) The reader who has not been exposed to this literature may consider two statements by the author of a study of gelada baboons. "I shall make frequent use of the language of conscious decision- making in defiance of Lloyd Morgan's proscription of anthropormorphisms. I do so partly because this is much the easiest way to discuss the animals' behavior, but also partly because fifteen years of field work have made it abundantly clear to me that strategy evaluation is precisely what the animals are doing" (R.I.M. Dunbar, Reproductive decisions: an economic analysis of gelada baboon social stra- tegies, Princeton 1984, 4). "There is a crucial methodological point at stake: to be able to study these kinds of social systems, the observer has to second-guess what his animals are up to, and this means thinking himself into the animal's "state of mind" in just the same way as historians do for past events and cultures... Unless this can be done, it will often not be possible to appreciate the options that are available to an animal, nor to understand how its biological capacities limit these options and constrain its behaviour" (ibid., 231). It is an interesting fact that this tension, though shared by contemporary Western primatologists with Ibn Qutayba, is not found in modern Japanese primatology (see PJ. Asquith, "Anthropomorphism and the Japanese and Western traditions in primatology", in J.G. Else and PC. Lee (ed.), Primate ontogeny, cognition and social behaviour; Cambridge 1986). 65</page><page sequence="24">MICHAEL COOK the Hamadryas baboon ("7) an animal which lives not just in north-eas- tern Africa (the continent on which baboons in general are at home), but also, perhaps through colonisation in historical times, in south-wes- tern Arabia (9). It has been studied by several ethologists, in particular Hans Kummer. The Hamadryas baboon is a species displaying marked sexual dimorphism and a distinctive family structure to which the etho- logists apply the term harem. The mature males have harems and, it might be said, family values somewhere to the right of Jesse Helms: they do not normally copulate with females other than their own, and they spend much of this phase of their lives keeping their females close to them and preventing or punishing their infidelities with immature males. The females, by contrast, though bonded to their males, could be described as would-be adherents of the counter-culture. It follows that what Ibn Qutayba has to tell us about marriage, male jealousy, and female adultery is not some projection onto another spe- cies of the patriarchal mores of Arab and Muslim society. What our text reveals to us here is not the image of the monkey but the monkey itself, knowledge that must ultimately derive from accurate observation of the life of the species ("). This is not to award Ibn Qutayba a posthumous prize. For one thing, he owed much of his zoology to J.hiz ("x,). For ano- ther, both of them could have done much better than they did. On a visit to the baboons of Saudi Arabia in 1980, Kummer encountered a twelve-year-old beduin boy called Mahdi whose knowledge of the spe- cies and insight into its behaviour was far greater than that of Jfhiz and Ibn Qutayba (""). It is conceivable that Mahdi was unique; but it is more likely that there have been many like him over the centuries, and that their understanding, had it been drawn upon, could have greatly enri- (97) I owe my awareness of this species to Patricia Crone. (98) For the distribution of the Hamadryas baboon, see the sketch-map in H. Kummer, In quest of the sacred baboon, Princeton 1995, 15, and for the question of colonisation, ibid., 17f. For a more detailed discussion of the distribution of the animal in south-western Saudi Arabia, see S. Biquand et al., "The distribution of Papio hamadryas in Saudi Arabia", International Journal of Primatology, 13 (1992); the northern limit of its habitat lies somewhat north of halfway between Mecca and Medina (ibid., 225, and cf. 231). The authors note that it is the only extant non-human primate in Arabia, ibid., 224; contrast Encyclopaedia of Islam, second edition, art. "Kird", col. 131a (E Vir6). I know of no recent literature on the baboons of Yemen. Most of the field study of the social life of the species has taken place in Ethiopia, but for some comparative observations see H. Kummer et al., "Differences in social behaviour between Ethiopian and Arabian Hamadryas baboons", Folia Primatologica, 45 (1985), and Kummer, In quest of the sacred baboon, 233-5, 251f.

Nevertheless, what Ja.hiz and Ibn Qutayba have to tell us of baboon behaviour repre- sents precisely the kind of observation that seems to be missing from the ancient Greek and Roman sources (102). This is clearly no accident: it reflects the fact that the Arabs were the first contributors to zoological literature with regular experience of baboons in the wild ("o3). What complicates our picture is the element of silliness in 'Amr's story (as opposed to Ibn Qutayba's discussion of it). His recognition of adultery among baboons is sound enough, but his stoning motif is fan- tastic. It is true that baboons have been known to throw things at tar- gets, e.g. humans ("1), but this has not been reported for the Hamadryas baboon (,1o). What is utterly incredible in 'Amr's tradition is the recourse to stoning as a punishment for adultery - in real life an unfaithful female gets a neck-bite - and the participation of baboons other than the offen- ded male in inflicting the punishment ('"). The kind of scene which 'Amr might actually have witnessed would go like this: "An adult male is leaving the sleeping rock followed by his females. On the way, one of these presents her swelling to a subadult male who then mounts her. As they are copulating, the unit leader looks back, causing the two to sepa- rate and the young male to flee. The leader attacks his female and after biting her on the back, mounts her himself ('0)" But 'Amr was not an ethologist, any more than the Armenian bar-owner who gave Kummer a vivid account of a baboon funeral ('"). The difference is that Ibn Qutayba had to take 'Amr's little fantasy seriously, whereas Kummer was under no obligation to treat the bar-owner's with the same deference. I shall come back to this difference, but in the meantime there is a final similarity to be taken up. (102) I risk this statement on the basis of WC. McDermott, The ape in antiquity, Baltimore 1938. Contrast the anatomical knowledge of non-human primates displayed by Aristotle (d. 322 B.C.) and Galen (d. A.D. 199) (ibid., 88-100). It is characteristic that Galen sees the behaviour of apes as inept mimicry of the actions of humans (De usupartium, ed. G. Helmreich, Leipzig 1907-9, 1:58.23 = trans. M.T May, Ithaca 1968, 1:107; cf. McDermott, The ape in antiquity, 95). (103) Contrast the continuing ignorance of Europeans, richly documented in H.W Janson, Apes and ape lore in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, London 1952, especially ch. 9: "The sexuality of apes". Janson's is a study of the image of the monkey, and could not be anything else. (104) See. D.K. Candland, "Tool use", in G. Mitchell and J. Erwin (ed.), Behavior, cognition, and motivation (= Comparative primate biology, vol. 2, Part B), New York 1987, 94-6. (105) I am indebted to Hans Kummer for confirmation on this point; and cf. Kummer, Social orga- nization, 171 f. Julie Macdonald reports that her domesticated baboon was nevertheless adept at boun- cing and catching balls (Almost human, 54f, and cf. 56). (106) The long versions of the tradition are something else again (see above, note 21). For example, real baboons do not point (Kummer, In quest of the sacred baboon, 261). (107) Id., Social organization, 41. Mahdi gave Kummer a description of such an incident which is far superior to 'Amr's (id., In quest of the sacred baboon, 311). (108) Ibid., 306. 67</page><page sequence="26">MICHAEL COOK Underlying the whole debate is a sense of the comical that is imme- diately recognisable to us. The false believers pick on the tradition because it is ridiculous, and can be made to look even more so (""). As Ibn Qutayba says, they are mocking the true believers ('"') But at the same time, I have argued that the reason the tradition is there at all is precisely that it is funny ("'). One can laugh with it, or laugh at it; either way the tradition is inherently comical, to them as to us. What makes their world very unlike our own is above all the exis- tence of overriding religious authority. At certain points reason stops dead in its tracks: the authority of accredited religious texts (and even the linguistic usage of the tribesmen of pre-Islamic Arabia) is terminal. If the Koran says that God metamorphosed humans into animals, Nazz.m is stuck with this whether he likes it or not; if the Prophet says that metamorphics die out, Ibn Qutayba is likewise stuck with this. The sort of premises which few educated people today would take seriously outside the Bible-belt appear as the starting-points of processes of rea- soning with which we are very much at home. No doubt this seemed much less bizarre to them than it does to us. But this does not mean that it seemed effortlessly natural to them. Both sides of our debate belon- ged to a culture significantly distanced from that which had given rise to the religious texts they were now saddled with. They did not choose the contents of these texts; their role was only to believe in them ("2). At the same time, the two sides had to take account of contemporaries who subscribed to different definitions of the canon, or none at all. Ibn Qutayba had to defend what others classed as superstitions; but he sha- red the concept enough to use it himself. For example, he happily cha- racterised in this way traditions about metamorphosis into lizards and the like ("'). In the same vein, Nazz~m tells the soft-shell Dahriyya that he would accept their view of metamorphosis were it not for religious authority ("'). But whatever distance or irony individual Muslims may at times have felt towards inherited religious authority, they lived with it. In this respect they have much in common with how we used to be, as opposed to how we are now. Yet there is also an interesting contrast between Islam and our Chris- tian past which bears on the debate. Our modern paradigm of religion, (109) See above, ? 1 of the text. (110) See above, ?2 of the text. (111) See above, note 81. (112) Compare the saying "I only work here". (113) See Ibn Qutayba, Ta'wTI, 362.8-364.8 = trans. Lecomte, 315f ?300c, where he speaks of aliddith al-khurdfa. The theme is prominent in his introduction (ibid., 9.9 = trans. Lecomte, 7-9 ? 15). Here again he had a predecessor in Jdhiz, who regarded metamorphic traditions about lizards and eels as jokes (muzdi) and superstitions (khurdfdt) (H.ayawdn, 1:308.6). (114) Jahiz, Htuayiawan, 4:73.6. 68</page><page sequence="27">IBN QUTAYBA AND THE MONKEYS whether we are Christians or not, is strongly shaped by Christianity. Now Christianity is marked by a chasm which separates its message from the contexts in which most of those who believe in it actually think and act most of the time. (Hence the emphasis on doing whatever we do in a Christian spirit.) How would Jesus have run Microsoft? The question itself is ridiculous; Muslims, by contrast - and not just men, women too - could easily find in their heritage a role model for someone running a business (not a modern business, but a business for all that). Or consider the widespread activity of talking dirty. At the beginning of an account of an obscene debate, Jdhiz feels the need to find an Islamic legitimation for what he is doing, and does so by addu- cing examples of the use of sexually explicit language by the Prophet and his Companions ("11). Jesus and the twelve Apostles, by contrast, would be quite useless in this context; a Christian would instead say something like "Well, we are not in church." Where there is a conti- nuous spectrum in Islam there tends to be a sharp break in Christianity. The fact is, however, that the overall similarities between the major forms of the monotheist tradition are more striking than the differences. Seen in a wider perspective, the monotheist universe, in the aspects which concern us here, is a rather distinctive place (116). God, humans, and monkeys exist on three quite separate plains between which there are great gulfs fixed. Interactions which go too far in crossing one of these gulfs pose tremendous threats to the dignity of the superior party. Pagan gods may have human offspring at the drop of a hat. Not so the monotheist God: the very idea is anathema in Judaism and Islam; in Christianity it is strictly a once-only affair, and even then has given rise to endless theological anxieties and complications. Something similar is true of the gulf between men and monkeys. In Judaism the metamor- phosis of the one into the other is known only in a single instance, namely the divine punishment following the attempted construction of the Tower of Babel (,"). In Christianity it is unheard of. In Islam it is entrenched, yet treated with a theological discomfort reminiscent of (115) Jihiz (d. 255/868f), Mufdkharat al-jawdri wa'l-ghilmdn, in Rasd'il al-Jdhi, ed 'A.M. Hriron, Cairo 1964-79, 2:92.3 (with a Prophetic tradition at 93.6). (116) As pointed out, from an East-Asian vantage point, in E. Ohnuki-Tierney, The monkey as mir- ror : symbolic transformations in Japanese history and ritual, Princeton 1987, 21 (1 am indebted to Martin Collcutt for directing me to this book). But for the presence of the idea of the Great Chain of Being in the Islamic world, see above, note 93. (117) Members of one of three groups involved in the affair were turned into monkeys (q6fim) (Babylonian Talmud, Wilna 1880-6, Sanhedrin, f. 109a.27). For this and other references, seee L. Ginz- berg, The legends of the Jews, Philadelphia 1946-7, 1:180, 5:201-4 note 88. On the other hand, J~ihiz reports that the People of the two Books (i.e. the Jews and Christians) deny that God has metamor- phosed humans into monkeys and pigs, admitting only the transformation of Lot's wife into a stone (iajar H ayawdn, 4:107.2). The only mention of monkeys in the Bible is in a list of commodities impor- ted by Solomon, another of them being ivory (1K 10:22, 2Ch 9:21). 69</page><page sequence="28">MICHAEL COOK Christology. This inhibition is not, of course, a result of political cor- rectness. From a Muslim point of view, it was right and proper that infi- dels should hang their heads in shame - indignity (dhilla) was, after all, part of the deal under which they could be tolerated in an Islamic society. What lies behind the inhibition is rather a conception of the human race as a very discrete entity: if all men descend from Adam, and Adam was created, there can be no genetic relationships between either men and God, or men and monkeys. Distaste for monkeys is not, of course, confined to the monotheist universe. In his treatise on the functions of the parts of the body, Galen (d. A.D. 199) repeatedly describes the ape as ridiculous; he likes to explain that nature has given it a ridiculous body to match its ridiculous soul ("'). Likewise the traditional image of the monkey in Arabic poetry is a negative one, as is evident from the role the animal plays in the repertoire of poetic insult ("11). It seems unlikely that this whole tradi- tion was an innovation of Islamic times; indeed the pre-Islamic poet Ngbigha al-Dhubyani (sixth century A.D.) reviles his antagonists as "monkey-faces" (wujabhu quradin) (12)). But we also encounter non- monotheist cultures with very different attitudes to the animal. Consider the case of India, which offers perhaps the richest example of polytheism in a natural homeland of monkeys. In this culture it is axiomatic that it takes all sorts to make a pantheon. It would thus be odd if monkeys were not represented, and sure enough we have (118) See, for example, Galen, De usu partium, 1:59.5 = trans. May, 1:108. I owe this reference to Fritz Zimmermann. (119) The following are a few examples among many from the early centuries of the Islamic period. A poet of the second/eight century, Ism5'il ibn 'Ammir al-Asadi, had a slave-girl whom he loa- thed ; he says of her that she has the face of a monkey (wajhu qirdin) when she prettifies herself (Abi'l-Faraj al-Isbahani (d. 356/967), Aghdni, Cairo 1927-74, 11:371.7; for this poet, see Sezgin, Ges- chichte, 2:472f). The poet Farazdaq is referred to by his rivalJarir (d. c. 111/729) as "the little bald mon- key" (al-qurayd al-aia') (Bevan, Nak.'id, 967 verse 35; and cf. ibid., 251 verse 11). The theme of adul- terousness plays a part in such unflattering comparisons (ibid., 396 vese 11; and cf. Jarir, Dirwdn, apud M.I.'A. al-Siwi, Sharl DTwdnJarfr, Cairo n.d., 591.12, and above, note 24); by contrast, I noticed no mention of the simian virtue of jealousy. The poet Bushayr ibn Ubayy al-'Absi (whom I take to have lived in the first/seventh century) addresses some verses to the "BanO Qird", telling them that they are in no condition to swish their tails (like stallions) since monkey tails are too short for swishing (Abo Tammlm (d. 231/845f), H.amasa, apud AbO'I-'AI' al-Ma'arri (d. 449/1057) (attrib.), Sharh Diudn Hamndsat Abi Tammdmn, ed H.M.

Noeldeke, Delectus veterumn carminum arabicorum, Berlin 1890, 53.2; J.hiz, IHayawdn, 4:67.2; for the date of Bushayr, compare his genealogy with those of other members of the BanD 'Abs as given in Ibn H.azm,Jamhara, 250-2). The most vivid (and again negative) description of monkeys I have seen in poetry is a line of Hass~n ibn Thibit (d. c. 54/674) (Diwan, ed. WN. 'Arafat, London 1971, 1:170 verse 4). I owe almost all my references to Arabic poetry to the Concordance of Pre-Islamic and Umayyad Poetry of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem; I am much indebted to Albert Arazi for making this material available to me.

A lively and much-loved presence on the religious scene, he is associated with Rama, warfare, the sun, lear- ning, and selfless devotion. He has a massive temple, the Hanumdnga- rhi, in Ayodhya, the birthplace of Rama, and he is widely worshipped in villages. Altogether, he is a very successful member of a highly compe- titive pantheon. What is particularly striking is that modernity has not seriously shaken the cult of this monkey god ('22). Over the last couple of decades, there has been intense competition to erect "the biggest Hanuman in India" - one of the functions of such colossal idols being to ensure "that the Pakistanis and so on cannot attack" (123). Of course not all monkeys can be gods, but they can still be sacred: monkeys are honoured and fed at temples, like "the Monkey Temple" at Benares, where they have a king (124). Killing them would be sacrilege. It is not that monkeys are better than us; for people to be turned into monkeys is still regarded as a mishap. "After all, you are only a monkey", as Rama tells the monkey-king Valin after fatally shooting him in rather off-colour circumstances (,'S). But then again, as the same Rama tells the same Vilin, "animals, if they enter Manu's path, are gods" (16). There is a flui- dity here, an absence of great gulfs, which is in marked contrast to the aloofness which characterises the monotheist universe. (121) Unless otherwise stated, the data on Hanumin which follow are taken from the brief but informative account in E.O. Martin, The gods of India, Delhi and Benares 1972, 225-8. For a recent depiction of Hanuman, see A. Hiltebeitel (ed.), Criminal gods and demon devotees: essays on the guardians of popular Hinduism, Albany 1989, 245. Hanuman was introduced into the discussion of the Ayla incident by Lichtenstadter ("And become ye accursed apes'", 163, 169f). (122) For Hanumin's links with the Hindu revivalists, see P Lutgendorf, "My Hanuman is bigger than yours", History of Religions, 33 (1994), 214, 243. I am indebted to David Shulman for referring me to this and other studies. (123) Ibid., 211-15. Contrast the monotheist contempt for such images which inspired Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria in A.D. 391 to make one exception to the general destruction of pagan idols: he had a statue of a monkey preserved, and set up in a public place in the city, so that the pagans could never in future deny that they had worshipped such gods (Cassiodorus (d. A.D. 583) and Epiphanius Scholasticus, Historia ecclesiastica tripartita, IX, 27 (=ed. W Jacob and R. Hanslik, Vienna 1952, 537.26), whence Janson, Apes and ape lore, 17, quoted in Lichtenstadter, "And become ye accursed apes'", 175). (124) The absence of such a monkey population in the Meccan sanctuary presumably reflects a cultural choice. By contrast, we hear much of the presence there of populations of doves (hamdm al- haram) and gazelles (.ibd' al-haram) (Azraqi (d. c. 250/864), Akbbdr Makka, ed. R.S. Malhas, Madrid n.d., 2:141.19, 146.1); a story about a man grabbing a nearby gazelle by its leg (ibid., 145.12) suggests that in the security of the sanctuary gazelles had lost their natural timidity. It is an offense to kill a mon- key in the sanctuary ('Abd al-Razziq, Musannaf 4:529 no. 8,746, and cf. Ibn Abi Shayba, Musannaf, 4:549.17), but that is as far as it goes. At the present day commensal troops of baboons are found in urban centres in south-western Saudi Arabia, where they are treated with considerable tolerance (Biquand, "The distribution of Papio hamadryas in Saudi Arabia", 236). They are not, of course, trea- ted with reverence. (125) The Rdmdaya!a of Vdlmiki: an epic of ancient India, vol. 4: The Kiskindbdhnkda, trans. R. Lefeber, Princeton 1994, 93 (= 18.36).

The Primate Research Institute of the University of Kyoto performs an annual monkey memorial service as an expression of regret for the loss of monkey lives to disease and experiment; in 1982 the ceremony inclu- ded chanting by a Buddhist priest, prayers, and offerings of food which were later consumed by the surviving monkeys (127) Yet here too a human would be metamorphosed into a monkey only as a form of punishment ('21). The Tibetans, like every self-respecting people, have their ethnogenesis. In their case, they are proud to descend from the union of a monkey from south India and a local rock-ogress who sub- jected him to shameless sexual harassment; their offspring were gra- dually humanised - this is clearly seen as an improvement - when fed with a miraculous diet by their simian father (129). Good Tibetans inherit the dispositions of the monkey, bad ones those of the rock-ogress. The monkey was, of course, a Bodhisattva (and a disciple of Avalokitesvara, whom he consulted before succumbing to the importunity of the rock- ogress) ('"). This myth attained currency among Tibetans many centu- ries before descent from non-human primates became respectable among Europeans. In China the ambiguity could be resolved (though it did not have to be) by opposing two of the primate species of which Chinese had particular experience, namely reclusive gibbons and mischievous macaques. Gibbons, who live deep in the forests, "have the same disposition as the Superior Man ('"')"; they are quite different in nature from the "tricky and wily" macaques, who "bustle about without the slightest restraint" (132). "The bad macaques and the good gibbons" was the way one author summed it up in his "Essay on the hateful mon- (127) See PJ. Asquith, "The monkey memorial service of Japanese primatologists", in T. Sugiyama Lebra and WP Lebra,Japanese culture and behaviour: selected readings, Honolulu 1986, 29f; Asquith gives an eye-witness account of the ceremony as performed in 1982, and notes a similar ceremony in Osaka. It would be a mistake to look for a clear-cut doctrinal basis for this ritual; one primatologist said be believed in the existence of souls of monkeys he had come to know, but not of monkeys he did not work with (ibid., 31). With regard to the Buddhist role, it is worth noting that one theme of Japanese art in the fourteenth century was macaques playing on the roof of a temple or around a temple gate (Ohnuki-Tierney, Monkey as mirror, 27f).

This Tibetan myth was noted by Julie Macdonald (Almost human, 3).

Yet even here it was hardly auspicious to be be turned into a gibbon - as may have been the fate of the gentlemen of an army routed in a disastrous southern expedition in ancient times ('134) In the same way macaques were not all bad: the monkey hero of Wu Ch'eng- en's sixteenth-century novel is indeed a hero on a grand scale, though forever getting into trouble because of his monkeyness ('"1). The ancient Egyptians, who imported monkeys, readily ascribed religious signifi- cance to them ('16). This was a culture in which the sun-priest boasted: "I have joined the ranks of the sun apes and am one of them" ('1). The Umayyad Caliph Yazid ibn Mu'dwiya (ruled 60-64/680-3) is said to have had a monkey on whom he conferred the tecnonym Abti Qays. He claimed that this monkey was an old Israelite (shaykh min Bani Isrd'dl) who had committed some sin and been metamorphosed. He used to get him drunk and laugh at his cavortings. He would mount him on a wild ass and have him race against horses. According to one account, it was in the course of participating in this activity that Yazid met his death ('39. It is typical of Islamic religious sensibility that there is no hint of warmth or dignity in the protagonists of this tale of royal depravity (3i9): the monkey is a clown for Yazid, just as Yazid is a clown for the narrator (140). With this we may contrast the story of the Rdja of Nadiya, who spent a lac of rupees on marrying two monkeys. "There was a magnificent parade. In the procession were seen elephants, camels, horses, all richly caparisoned; palanquins carried the guests whose path was lit by torches and fairy lamps.
