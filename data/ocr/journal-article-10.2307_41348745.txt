<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Evolutionary Psychology of Chinese Religion: Pre-Qin High Gods as Punishers and Rewarders Kelly James Clark and Justin T. Winslett* Scholarship on religion in Early China (pre-220 ВСЕ) has been predominantly concerned with the issue of ritual and has tended to be more concerned with placing this within the framework of Chinese history than that of religious studies. As such, other topics, such as deities, have either been neglected or subject to untested claims- often that deities do not exist and that Early China represents an atheist society, an argument that makes little sense in light of contemporary scholarship on religion in the field of cognitive science. This paper addresses the issue of deities in Early China by looking at how the High Deities of Early Chinese societies are represented in pre-Qin (pre-221 ВСЕ) texts through statistical analysis of the corpus of texts and close readings of selected passages featuring High Deities. This paper shows that in contrast to some earlier appraisals of an absence of such agents, these texts are rife with depictions of the High Deities, and that they are often represented as moralizing agents that punish vice and reward virtue in others, something that is argued to be expected in evolutionary psychology.

Unlike most other religions, Chün-fang Yü writes of Chinese religions that "there is no God transcendent and separate from the world" (2007: 1243-1245). Jacques Gernet (1985) holds that the ancient Chinese had no notion of transcendence whatsoever; theirs was a world of radical immanence; the Chinese, he claims, never imagined a spiritual substance distinct from the material. Marcel Granet claimed that the Chinese had no notion of a transcendent Law or God (1985: 476). Even those who concede China's gods contend that they are either unique to a single nonrepresentative thinker (usually Mozi) or inconse- quential to Chinese moral/political thought and life. And so, the gods are irrelevant in the writings of mainstream Chinese thinkers (usually called "the Confucians") who directly channeled "the Chinese mind." China, so it is claimed, is the great cultural exception to otherwise highly pervasive god beliefs. However, recent scholarship on religious topics in Early China (pre- 220 CE) has helped to push forward new understandings in this field. From notable publications by Poo Mu-chou (1998) and Michael Puett (2002) to the large collaborative work Religion in Early China,1 this scholarship has shown that religious life in Early China, as told to us through the textual record, was not one of atheistic humanism but rather was a diverse panoply of various paradigms, idioms, and practices held by diverse communities separated both geographically and tempo- rally.2 Though research has identified many of these ancient and diverse ritual practices, prescriptive paradigms, and religious prescriptions, other topics that fall under the scope of religion, such as deities, remain poorly understood and in some instances completely unstudied. This is an interesting turn of events when one considers that anthropologists such as Pascal Boyer (2001) and Stewart Guthrie (1993) point out that deities, or simply extrahumans, are a primary and nearly universal feature of religion. Claims to Chinese exceptionalism notwithstanding, anthropol- ogy and careful consideration of the ancient texts are converging on a new and richer understanding of China's divinities. Empirical support for Chinese deities can be found in the newly emerging cognitive science of religion. Cognitive science rejects the assumption that cultural groups are radically different. Studies show that our common biological heritage and relatively similar environments produce both relatively similar minds and relatively similar beliefs. Evolutionary processes have shaped human cognitive ^ee Kalinowski and Lagerwey (2009).

These common cognitive faculties include relatively specialized "subsystems" that structure, inform, enhance, and limit our view of the world. Rejecting the empiricist assumption of the mind as a blank slate on which experience writes, cognitive scientists hold that our minds come equipped with a set of cognitive faculties that actively processes our perceptions and shapes our conceptions of the world. Some of these faculties, in turn, have a direct influence upon the origin and development of religious beliefs. According to this model, humans have a natural tendency to believe in gods . Belief in gods naturally arises when certain common cognitive faculties are stimulated.3 A culture without gods is as much to be expected as a culture without beliefs in other persons or the external world. In this paper, we use the cognitive science of religion to reject claims to Chinese religious exceptionalism. More specifically, we take inspiration from supernatural punishment theory, one version of the cognitive science of religion, to direct an examination of ancient Chinese texts for specific conceptions of divinity and their relation to humanity. While the cognitive science of religion in general would lead us to expect to find various sorts of disembodied agents in China, supernatural punishment theory in particular would lead us to expect to find a high, moralizing god with strategic knowledge who exercises a kind of moral providence.4 In order to better understand China's High Deities- Di ф, Shangdi _h$r, and Tian ^ - we have constructed a database of instances of these three terms in texts from the pre-Qin (pre-221 ВСЕ) period.5 This database is composed of intuitively coded, representative passages from these texts where these extrahuman agents appear. By employing this database in these capacities, this paper, guided by super- natural punishment theory, highlights one of the common ways with which these High Deities are represented in pre-Qin texts, as punishers and rewarders. We then show how the representation of these agents as 3The best single- volume introduction to the subject is Barrett (2004). See Johnson and Bering (2005, 2006).

Though these are too diverse to be fully explained in a single paper, by taking a general survey of these representations, common idioms emerge that continue to present themselves in the pas- sages where these agents are punishers and rewarders. Most commonly, this manifests as a moral dimension with these agents being cast as moralizing agents that punish and reward according to moral criteria, something argued for by cognitive theories of religion. This paper will hence present and analyze some of the most salient and representative passages that show these agents under such representations and idioms, revealing them to be both pervasive and fundamental to the under- standing of the High Deities in pre-Qin texts. SUPERNATURAL PUNISHMENT THEORY Cognitive science has converged on a general picture of how our common cognitive faculties produce belief in gods. Human beings are equipped with a cognitive faculty - an agency-detecting device (ADD) - that generates beliefs about agency. When stimulated, ADD immedi- ately produces beliefs in an agent. The evolutionary advantages of agency detection are obvious: without such immediate beliefs/responses to certain motions (rustling bushes) or sounds (things going bump in the night), we might end up as food for a predator or the victim of an enemy. So ADD is highly sensitive, prompting us to instantly respond to slight provocation. Justin Barrett has named the disposition to form beliefs about agents given minimal stimulation the hypersensitive agency detection device (HADD). Upon the detection of agency, another cognitive faculty that cognitive scientists call the Theory of Mind (ToM) begins operating and attributes beliefs, desires, and purposes to the postulated agent. How do HADD and ToM produce belief in gods? If ordinary agents - animals and enemies - are unsuited to account for ones experiences, one might find oneself immediately believing in extraordinary, supernatural personal beings, including ghosts, angels, or gods. And then HADD quickly gives way to ToM: these agents have reasons for the things they do. Surely only a very powerful, minded agent could cause such extraordinary events (and for extraordinary reasons), so we attribute super qualities- super powers and super knowledge, for example - to the causes of super events. There is much more to say here about the cognitive science of religion. It offers explanations of the sustainability and transmissibility of religious belief; certain sorts of beliefs seem to have an advantage because they explain a wide variety of phenomena (sustainability) and,</page><page sequence="5">932 Journal of the American Academy of Religion because they are surprisingly different from most beliefs are easy to remember and pass on to future generations (transmissibility). It also claims to have found a cognitive faculty or set of faculties that detect the kind of design that is often alleged to support Goďs existence; we seem naturally disposed to treat nearly every kind of phenomena- whether human-made or natural - as designed or purposeful. We may even have a natural immortality faculty and may instinctively believe that we have souls that are distinct from our bodies; for example, after people die, we continue talking with them in our minds as though they were still existing (this may partly explain widespread religious practices of ancestor worship).6 Supernatural punishment theory leads us to expect that ancestral groups with high moralizing gods will be more successful than groups without them. Supernatural punishment theory helps explain the puz- zling evolution of larger and larger human groups that depend on high levels of cooperation.7 As group size increases, the ability to detect cheaters, who are a threat to the stability of the group, decreases. Because of the threat of such norm-violations to the group, detection of cheaters and their punishment is paramount but very costly. But the enforcement of moral norms, while costly, enhances cooperation and the benefits that cooperation make possible. Belief in a supernatural punisher would transfer the "costs" of detection and punishment to (a) nonhuman agent (s), thereby reducing the human costs. If belief in "High Gods" that are active in human affairs and supportive of human morality can be inculcated in a group, moral defection can be dimin- ished (and at a fairly low cost). In order to prevent cheaters, such agents must have access to strategic information- they must be super- knowing about defections or cooperations that are hidden from merely human agents. And they must be believed to efficaciously exercise a kind of moral providence - to reward virtue and to punish vice. So supernatural punishment theory leads to the expectation of high moral- izing gods with strategic information who exercise moral providence. The bottom line: groups of god-fearing individuals will outcompete groups of nonbelievers (assuming roughly equal size and complexity). Evidence supporting supernatural punishment theories is wide ranging. We can only here give the briefest sense of its empirical 6See Bering (2002, 2006). While there are good evolutionary explanations or cooperation among kin and members ot very small communities (where one can expect reciprocity for one's cooperative behavior), there are no good evolutionary explanations for large-scale group cooperative behavior. Johnson et al. (2003: 911-912).</page><page sequence="6">Clark and Winslett: Evolutionary Psychology of Chinese Religion 933 support here. Studies show increased voluntary payment (when no one is watching) when the collection can has eyes drawn on it, and less cheating on computer-assisted exams when virtual eyeballs float on the screen (Bateson et al. 2006). When children are prompted with ghost- beliefs, they are less likely to give in to temptation when no one else is in the room. Religious groups with costly religious rituals show remark- ably higher levels of cooperation and last vastly longer than secular groups (Sosis and Ruffle 2003). Finally, Dominic Johnson's survey of 186 people groups showed an extremely high correlation between coop- eration and belief in moralizing high gods (2005: 410-446). Cognitive science of religion holds that religious belief is natural and will routinely take characteristic shapes and forms. The evolutionary psy- chology of religion suggests that religious beliefs that have been chan- neled into moralizing high gods can effectively overcome human selfishness necessary for the gain of cooperative benefits. Taken together, they suggest that successful human groups, including those in ancient China, will likely and repeatedly develop beliefs in high, moralizing, prov- idential gods who exercise moral providence. Armed with this insight, what do we find when we carefully consider the ancient texts? THE HIGH DEITIES OF PRE-QIN TEXTS Michael Loewe (2005 reprint: 17-18) in the 1980s and Roel Sterckx (2010: 415-429) more recently have shown that Early Chinese texts are littered with a panoply of extrahuman agents that make up diverse pan- theons of figures. From the ritual functional agents of shen # and the ephemeral gui Ä to the diverse angry spirits, forces, and malevolencies, many texts from this time reveal a rich and diverse lexicon and dis- course on the extrahuman. Amongst these pantheon of figures sit two extrahuman agents who in many texts are assigned paramount or privi- leged roles in sacrificial rituals and discourses on the extrahuman - the High Deities of Di ф and Shangdi _h^, which are understood as two different terms referring to the same agent, and Tian these "High Deities" rule above this panoply of lesser deities (Loewe 2005: 17). Scholars such as К. C. Chang (1983: 33-34), Kelly Clark (2005: 122), and Herrlee Glessner Creel (1970: 93-99) have discussed some of the relationships between these two agents and their socio-political roles and the relationship to each other in the ancient dynasties of the Shang й (sixteenth-century to eleventh-century ВСЕ) and the Zhou Ш (eleventh century to 475 ВСЕ), with Di/Shangdi being argued to be the highest deity of the Shang with Tian replacing it at the top of the pan- theons in the Zhou. Keightly notes the strong associations with revered</page><page sequence="7">934 Journal of the American Academy of Religion ancestors of the Shang royal line and Dis greater, bureaucratic power when compared with other extrahumans (1996: 253-254). Etymologically, Keightly notes how the term Di , itself, can simply mean "sovereign," with the Shang of Shangdi indicated "superior," and was also employed in the names of the Shang kings and the mythological rulers of China and thus has a clear etymological association with socio-political power.8 Robert Eno points out how these agents are understood in high, if not pre-eminent, positions in sacrificial pan- theons and are often invoked as reflecting or related to those with socio-political authority, particularly with regard to Tian and the Zhou kings (Eno 1990a: 23-24). In his studies on Di , Eno draws upon paléo- graphie arguments to argue for earlier concepts of the term Di as being father, reinforcing the ancestral associations with the Shang royal line, something often argued by paléographie researchers of this term.9 Though the realities of their prominent positions as High Deities and socio-political legitimacy is firmly established in prior research, a full analysis or survey of how these figures are represented in these texts remains to be completed, and much is still unclear about these terms. Their status as High Deities, something that transcends other deities, and their strong socio-political associations already show resonance with the arguments of supernatural punishment theory. However for these arguments to hold, these extrahuman agents must be shown to be represented as moralizing agents possessing specialized knowledge who reward virtue and punish vice. HIGH DEITIES AS PUNISHERS AND REWARDERS Despite what may seem like a very straightforward collection of twenty-eight or so texts composed by important cultural and historical figures transmitted to the modern period, these texts actually contain a vast quantity of information produced by many different hands through- out the entire pre-Qin period. From the perspective of the religious mate- rial contained within in them, notably information on the High Deities that are the concern of this paper, the number of representations and idioms concerning these extrahuman agents should reflect this diversity. 8Keightly (1996: 257). The term di also refers to a category of extrahumans that are not of immediate concern to this paper. Many texts from this time talk about various di such as the Red di Ťffrfí or Yellow di jPfffr that exist in the sacrificial pantheon. Though the full relationship between these di and DUShangdi remains unstudied, when observed together these other di are always beneath a greater agent that in some texts is Di and others Tian . (Loewe 2005: 17). See Eno (2009: 41-102) and Eno (1990b: 1-26).</page><page sequence="8">Clark and Winslett: Evolutionary Psychology of Chinese Religion 935 Indeed, when looking through the database of these passages, one does see a great diversity in terms of how these agents are represented and the capacities in which they are used in the texts. While often not provided with detailed physical descriptions, in some passages, these extrahuman agents are described in highly anthropomorphic form, often taking on the characteristics of rulers or sovereigns. In some passages, these agents are recipients of sacrifices while in others they are used in common curses. Hence, these texts reflect a spectrum of representations of the High Deities that were clearly of concern to these authors. However, though there is great diversity, patterns and similarities present themselves, suggesting representations that these authors, divided in space and time, shared, and which cognitive science of reli- gion would expect. One of the most prominent ways in which these High Deities are represented is in the capacity of providing punish- ments or rewards to human recipients. These punishments and rewards are quite numerous, and when compared with other categories of repre- sentations seen in the database have proven to be the most variable. These agents issue forth generic punishments fa 1П or calamities huo Ш upon individuals or groups. Likewise, the rewards can also be generic, usually described as simply good fortune fu |щ or assistance zhu IÖ. More specific rewards range from these agents bestowing mate- rial rewards,10 fecundity,11 longevity,12 internal powers and strengths,13 portents and omens,14 alleviating problems,15 and even sagehood or transcendent states.16 These agents also inflict specific punishments including famines, droughts and plagues,17 disruptions to the natural world,18 psychological problems,19 abandonment,20 and murder.21 10Guoyu Zhou 1.6, Jin 4.33, and Yue 2.7 and Shangshu Shuoming shang and Hongfan. nMozi Minggui xia ; Shangshu Junyi and Shijing Bigong. uLüshi chunqiu Zhiyue ; Mozi Minggui xia and Shangshu Gaozong rongri. 13 Shangshu Ťaijia zhong, Xibo kanli , Dagaoy Kanggao , Junyi and Duofang-, Shijing Tianbao ; Zhuangzi Zaiyou and Zuozhuan Xuan 3. l4Lüshi chunqiu Yingtong.

Given the nature of these texts as advocating good governance (Lewis 1999: 287-289), it is not surprising that such power and authority are granted and removed by these agents, as cir- cumstances require. The sovereign is often both the intended audience of many of these texts and the subject who suffers these punishments or gains these rewards. Passages commonly show the sovereign's house or state collapsing through either unspecified means or invasion. The reward of rulers with socio-political power is also common, and reso- nates well with previous studies on Di, Shangdi, and Tian that point to their association with the legitimization of the ruling houses of the Shang and the Zhou. Why, then, do these agents bestow these things to these subjects, most often the sovereign? In some of the passages seen, that these extra- human agents engage in punishment and reward is simply passively stated as having occurred, with no explicit explanation as to why. In several passages, however, these extrahuman agents explicitly give pun- ishments or rewards for reasons explained in the passage. These reasons are often of a moral dimension wherein the subjects are rewarded for proper behavior, usually for displaying virtue de Ш, righteousness yi Ш , and sincerity xin fli. Consequently, subjects who do not possess these qualities or are said to have transgressions zui W are punished. Statistical data on the over four hundred passages in pre-Qin texts that represent Di , Shangdi , and Tian in these ways can be seen in Table 1. These quantitative data show how in all of their occurrences punish- ments and rewards figure in more than a third of all passages featuring Di and Tian (though a little more than a quarter of those concerned with Shangdi ). Additionally, in almost two-thirds of the passages where Tian is represented as punisher or rewarder, Tian is also represented in some capacity as moral providence. This is seen to be in 47 percent of the cases with Di and in 60 percent of the passages with Shangdi . When breaking down the analysis by text, as is featured in Tables 2-4, one begins to see greater nuances in the representations of these High Deities. One of the most marked differences evidenced by Tables 2 and 3 versus Table 4 is the greater representation of Tian as an extrahuman compared with Di and Shangdi. Tian is represented in the greatest number of pre-Qin texts, twenty-two, in comparison to the twelve texts that feature Di as an extrahuman and the fourteen that feature Shangdi . This is also consistent with the far greater instances of Tian in general observed in Table 1. Furthermore, the number of texts where Tian is represented as punisher or rewarder is much greater -</page><page sequence="10">Clark and Winslett : Evolutionary Psychology of Chinese Religion 937 TABLE 1.

In the sixteen texts that represent Tian as a punisher or rewarder, only three, the Guliang zhuan , Analects ( Lunyu ), and Yijing , do not show any addi- tional representation as a moralizing agent.2 In the remaining thirteen, the Lüshi chunqiu and Shijing have the lowest number of passages where both representations are seen- at 50 percent. Several passages always represent the two together, while it occurs in most passages in most texts, reinforcing that the two are most definitely seen as strongly associated. When looking only at Tables 2 and 3, one sees a greater restriction of Di and Shangdi as punishers and rewarders in texts, only five and six This does not mean that Tian is not represented as a moral agent in all of these texts, indeed it is represented thus twice in the Analects (2.1 and 7.22) and ten times in the Yijing ( Кип Zhun iÜ, Shi Ěí, Dayou Qian Ш, Lin Bl, Wuwang MS, Cui Ge íř, and Dui jiï:).</page><page sequence="12">Clark and Winslett: Evolutionary Psychology of Chinese Religion 939 TABLE 4.

The passages in these texts, too, generally represent Di and Shangdi in the capacity of moral provi- dence. As seen in column 4 of these tables, this is observed in almost all cases, save for the Guoyu which never represents Shangdi in terms of punishment and reward and moral providence in the same passage.</page><page sequence="13">940 Journal of the American Academy of Religion When looking at this limited corpus as a whole, one observes that these texts share little in common in terms of providence and authorship and represent texts from the entire breadth of the pre-Qin period. Furthermore, when compared with Table 4, save for the Chuci , all represent Tian as an extrahuman and a punisher and rewarder in addition. This statistical information strongly supports the presence of idioms and paradigms related to supernatural punishment theory in pre-Qin texts. As cognitive science would hold, these representations seem to be relatively widespread throughout the corpus of pre-Qin texts. These High Deities are clearly being represented as higher agents possessed of some moralizing characteristic who engage in issuing punishments and rewards. However, these quantitative data can only provide some clues and highlight the larger trends to how these idioms actually function in these texts, particularly if, as supernatural punishment theory holds, these High Deities punish vice and reward virtue. Furthermore, though it seems Gernet and Yü are wrong in asserting a paradigm of nontheism to religion in pre-Qin China, can it be argued that these idioms and paradigms are isolated to specific periods or thinkers in pre-Qin China, or, as cognitive science would hold, they are universal? THE CASE OF THE MOZI Scholars of Chinese philosophy have long claimed the Mozi as an "uncharacteristic" text for its highly anthropomorphized, extrahuman agents. A. C. Graham has noted that these extrahuman agents, Tian amongst them, can be understood as punishers and rewarders. Graham points to the Understanding Ghosts III Minggui xia ВДАТ, Will of Heaven I, II, III Tianzhi shang , zhong , xia З^лё-h, Ф, T, and Antifatalism I, II, III Feiming shang , zhong xia #^_h, ф, T sec- tions as best exemplifying this view, stating that the Mozi argues "that men will act morally only if they cease to regard changes of fortune as their destiny, and come to recognize that Heaven [Tian] and the spirits reward the good and punish the wicked" (Graham 1978: 13-14). Graham's interest in extrahuman agents in the Mozi is motivated by his constant contrasting of the ideas of the text to those found in the "Confucian" texts. "Confucian" texts, he claims, question whether these extrahuman agents exist and adhere to a more secular philosophy in line with Gernet and Yü. The Mozi , then, is unique in its assertion of extrahuman agents like Tian as divine punishers and rewarders (1978: 13-14). However, such a dichotomy between "the Confucians" and "the</page><page sequence="14">Clark and Winslett : Evolutionary Psychology of Chinese Religion 941 Mohists" is problematic if, as seems likely, no such cohesive group as "Confucians" existed in the pre-Qin period, and no people from that time would identify themselves as such.23 Graham is not operating entirely from misconceptions about the philosophical discourse of this time; the Mozi itself is full of criticisms of ideas put forward by characters identified with the philosophical figure of Confucius such as Mencius. For example, in a dialogue between Mencius and Mozi, Mencius raises ideas about the lack of deities in ritual only to be refuted by Mozi (2006b: 48.690). But to assume that this is a discourse against all things "Confucian" is mislead- ing - no such distinction is present in this specific passage nor are texts labeled as "Confucian" bereft of extrahumans. Indeed, the representation of Tian as punisher is found in the texts considered paramount in understanding Confucius, such as in the Analects 6.28 wherein Confucius asks Heaven to punish him if he has committed any wrongdoing: The master had an audience with Nanzi, and Zilu was not pleased. The Master swore an oath, saying, "If I have done anything wrong, may Heaven [Tian] punish me! May Heaven [Tian] punish me!"24 ŤMití, X mzi j 25 And in Mengzi VA. 5, Wan Zhang MM asks Mencius how it was that the king Shun came to be given the throne. Expecting that the answer is to be that Yao bestowed it upon him, Mencius asserts that such is not the case, and rather it was bestowed by Heaven who, along with the people, were to have accepted Shun because: When he was put in charge of sacrifices, the hundred gods enjoyed them.

The theistic aspects of the Analects are further discussed in Edward Slingerland's translation (2003: 62) and by Kelly James Clark (2005). Furthermore, Robert Eno has noted numerous uses of Tian , which he argues to be rhetorical rather than theoretical, among which punishment and moral qualities are found, in his study of the Tian in th e Mengzi and Xunzi (1990a: 102-104, 167-168). It is clear, then, that an understanding of the High Deities as pun- ishers and rewarders is not peculiar to the Mozi nor does it seem to accord to any "Mohist"-"Confiician" difference. Indeed cognitive science would argue that such idioms are quite common, and represen- tations of the High Deities have already been shown to be statistically present in a variety of texts. The representations in these three passages certainly accord well with the ideas of supernatural punishment theory, but are these idioms of punishment for the wicked and reward for the good as widespread through the time of pre-Qin China as they seem to be philosophically?

Indeed, these representations are found in the ear- liest strata of pre-Qin texts, the Shangshu jo]# and Shijing ШШ where they are widely articulated (as seen in Table 2). Both of these texts are composed of material, probably both orally and textually transmitted, that originates over a large span of time from the Western Zhou (elev- enth-century ВСЕ to 771 ВСЕ) and Spring and Autumn (770-475 ВСЕ) periods, though the Shangshu contains some material composed after this and into the Han. In the sections of the Shangshu composed prior to the Qin, one sees High Deities issuing punishments and rewards in all strata of the text - from passages like the Duofang and Duoshi ^dt dated to the Western Zhou to passages like the Gaoyaomo Tangshi Tanggao Щ 1=r, and Yixun ffiWi which are dated to the Spring and Autumn period. That all three of these terms appear in terms of pun- ishment and rewards is temporally well distributed, even appearing in the passages dated to the Warring States and the Han such as the Taishi ШШ and Xianyouyide Clark (2005) has written on many of the aspects of punishment and rewards related to these extrahuman agents in this text, and so it need not be restated here. However, it is worth looking at the example of the Duofang to understand some of the typical ways in which this represen- tation of the gods as punisher is articulated in the passages in the Shangshu: Shangshu ИИ Duofang ^ýj29 The duke of Zhou said, "The king speaks to the following effect: ťHo! I make an announcement to you of the four states, and the numerous (other) regions. Ye who were the officers and people of the prince of Yin, I have dealt very leniently as regards your lives, as ye all know. You kept reckoning greatly on (some) decree of Heaven [Tian]y and did not keep with perpetual awe before your thoughts (the preser- vation of) your sacrifices."' God [Di] sent down correction on Xia, but the sovereign (only) increased his luxury and sloth, and would not speak kindly to the people. He showed himself dissolute and dark, and would not yield for a single day to the leadings of God [Di]- this is what you have heard. He kept reckoning on the decree of God [Di] (in his favour), and did not cultivate the means for the people's support. By great inflictions of punishment also he increased the disorder of the states of Xia. The first cause (of his evil course) was the internal ^Translitérations have been changed to Pinyin.</page><page sequence="17">944 Journal of the American Academy of Religion misrule, which made him unfit to deal well with the multitudes. Nor did he endeavour to find and employ men whom he could respect, and who might display a generous kindness to the people; but where any of the people of Xia were covetous and fierce, he daily honoured them, and they practised cruel tortures in the cities. Heaven [Tian] on this sought a (true) lord for the people, and made its distinguished and favouring decree light on Tang the Successful, who punished and destroyed the sovereign of Xia.30 я&amp;Во isso ттшрЯо шш Mifro mmw Po mmmxzño тшш?

In the above excerpt, he is expounding to the defeated vassals of the state of Shang and explaining how their defeat by the hands of the Zhou mirrors the defeat of the Xia by the Shang centuries before. His explanation for the causes of this are couched in the metaphysical and assigned as the actions of Tian and Di , the latter of whom is said to have "sent cor- rection on Xia." The last king of the Xia ignored this correction and continued to behave wantonly and cruelly. The duke explains then that this internal misrule translated to misrule throughout the land, until his transgressions were such that Tian is said to have "sought a (true) lord for the people" and chose Tang, the first ruler of the Shang, to punish and destroy the Xia. On the rhetorical level, this story serves as an explication of what has happened to the Shang and justification of the overthrow of them by the Zhou. The earlier Shang overthrow of the Xia in the same manner was due to the choice of the extrahuman agents Di and Tian. The highly moralistic language of the passage couched the last king of Xia as morally bankrupt while Tang, the first king of Shang, is morally superior. This moral behavior prompts both Di and Tian to take action, in this first instance by sending down a correction, meant to be a Legge (2000a, reprint: 214-215).

This prompts the second action, the search- ing for a virtuous ruler by Tian who upon finding him is said to have favored him to overthrow the Tang. In this passage, one sees that these extrahuman agents are identified with proper moral behavior and also search for it in others. Furthermore, they are observed to operate as agents, of their own accord, and to select rulers that show proper moral conduct and to attempt to rectify the behavior of those of ill repute by issuing them warnings. Should these rulers not heed these warnings, they are pun- ished with the loss of socio-political power and its transference to the one whom the extrahuman agent selects. This idiom of an extrahuman agent identifying the moral and rewarding them with socio-political power, while punishing the wicked by taking that power away, often through invasion by those who have been rewarded, is typical in the Shangshu and consistent with superna- tural punishment theory. From the perspective of extrahuman agents, it shows how the High Deities are understood in the texts. In keeping with what has been statistically argued, and what Graham has noted as a common idiom in the Mozi , Di, and Tian , in this passage, the High Deities are clearly portrayed as punishers and rewarders who do so in accordance with the respective moral character of those being punished or rewarded. These representations and idiom are common in the other passages of the Shangshu and can be found in one of the other earliest texts of the pre-Qin period - the Shijing é Shijing Tianbao (Excerpt) Heaven [Tian] protects and establishes thee, With the greatest security; Makes thee entirely virtuous, That thou mayest enjoy every happiness; Grants thee much increase, So that thou hast all in abundance.

Tian , in the passage above, blesses the one with virtue and excellence, and is ultimately responsible for one's prosperity (through Tian s protection and establishment of the individual). Using poetic rhetoric of verse repetition and organic imagery to reinforce this point regarding Tian , it also elucidates some of the more common modes of representation of Tian (and indeed the other High Deities throughout the poems of the Shijing) and shows how these agents can be understood as punishers and rewarders in much the same way as was observed in the Shangshu. Tian bestows moral qualities upon those under its protection, and this protection evokes an air of the socio- political observed in the Shangshu (although the idiom of morally good behavior being rewarded with socio-political power is not present, nor is there any explanation as to why Tian is rewarding the individual in this poem). However, in other poems of the Shijing , notably Ban Huangyi Ж and Sangrou elements of such idioms do present themselves. Ban follows a similar rhetorical structure to Tianbao , by stating what Tian , or in the opening stanza Shangdi , does in the opening line of each stanza, describing how Shangdi "has reversed [His usual course of proce- dure]"34 and Tian is "now sending down calamities,"35 "now exercising oppression",36 and "is now displaying its anger," amongst others.3 These stanzas then proceed to describe how and why these agents are doing such things. This is mainly explained as being due to the moral impropriety of the people and the nation. The people are then 32Legge (2000b reprint: 255-256). 33 Shijing (2007c: 9.338).

The closing stanza of the passage, as seen below, provides explicit representation of Tian , pointing to it having mental and emotional capacities, something that the last, warning line explains as allowing it to understand the behavior of individuals. Shijing Ban Ш (Excerpt) Revere the anger of Heaven [Tian], And presume not to make sport or be idle. Revere the changing moods of Heaven [Tian], And presume not to drive about [at your pleasure].

Based on the gathering of this strategic information, punishment and reward are justly distributed. In the opening lines of the Huangyi below, a highly anthropo- morphized Shangdi is recounted to have sojourned through the world in search of a person of proper moral conduct to be made sovereign. Shangdi s choice of the legendary King Da once again reinforces the idiom of the High Deities rewarding the moral with socio-political power. In turn, the passage proceeds to describe these actions of Shangdi in bestowing socio-political power to moral rulers, while pun- ishing the immoral rulers by taking it away. Couched in much more socio-political terms than the previous two passages from the Shijing , this passage shows a great deal in common with those sections of the Shangshu provide justifications for the overthrow of the Shang (though this poem in the Shijing performs it with a far more lyrical and meta- phoric rhetoric). 38Ibid.: 499-503. ...

Numerous passages in both attest to such a representation, though the dynamics of that rep- resentation can be somewhat fluid. In some instances, they are simply passive statements, admonishments or arguments that things have been given or taken by one of the High Deities. However, idioms of the mor- alizing nature of the subject being punished or rewarded are also con- sistent. In keeping with the socio-political readings of these texts, socio- political power awarded to or taken from a ruler on account of that ruler's moral state, good for reward and bad for punishment, is consis- tent with the statements made regarding idioms of extrahumans Graham noticed in the Mozi. As such, the earliest strata of texts in the pre-Qin period clearly configure these agents as punishers and 40Legge (2000b reprint: 448-457).

WARRING STATES Most transmitted texts from the pre-Qin period are dated from the fourth- and third-centuries ВСЕ, with the traditional explanation for this being the massive social upheavals that the societies and the populations underwent at this time that inspired many thinkers to espouse their ideas. However, the prestige placed on many of the writings from this time that later generations, such as the Han, placed upon them have also contributed to their transmission, includ- ing the transmission of their ideas on religion, to the modern day (Graham 1989: 2-4). Some of the earliest texts from this period, and most likely contain- ing materials from before the fourth century, are the Guoyu Sip and the Zuozhuan Žifll, two texts of very similar provenance and content. Both are chronicles of the Spring and Autumn period (770-476 ВСЕ), recounting events from that time with narrative and dialogue. In some instances, this takes the form of proto-historiography, but, like many texts from this time, prescriptive socio-political discourse, alongside prescriptive religious discourse, sits alongside the descriptive character- istics of these texts, much like what has been seen in the Mozi , Mencius , Xunziy Shangshu, and Shijing.42 Guoyu Jin # 2.3 The Duke of Guo dreamt that he was in the ancestral temple where there was a shen with a man's face, white fur and the claws of a tiger. It grasped a battle-axe and stood on the western eaves of the veranda. The lord was scared and ran, the deity said, "Do not run! The Thearch [Di] has issued a command, 'I have sent Jin to enter43 through your gate/" The lord showed respect by kow- towing. He awoke, and summoned Shi Yin to divine this. He replied, "If it is as your majesty says, then it was Rushou.44 He is Heaven Tiaris shen of Punishment. Heaven [Tian] employs appro- priate officials." The lord had him imprisoned and further sent for the important people of the state to applaud the dream.

Now I believe it as well. The sovereign has not thought things out and applauds the entrance of a larger state.46 In our case, how will we recover? I have heard this, 'When a large state is with the Way, a small state entering it is called submission. When a small state is arrogant, a large state entering it is called punish- ment/ When the people are hard pressed by the sovereign's extrava- gance, they will thus succeed in disobeying his orders. Now in praising his dream, the extravagance has surely been extended. This is Heaven Tian capturing him and holding him to a mirror through increasing his illness. The people are sick of his attitude and Heaven [Tian] also deceives him. A large state comes to execute him, and when issuing commands, they are overturned. His ancestral lands have already fallen. The Feudal Lords have grown distant from him and the inner and outer are without close relation. Who is there in this that will save him? I do not bear to wait! I will go."

In the Guoyus Jin 2.3 passage, this dimension manifests in the extrahuman's communication with the lord, the socio-political nature of the punishment the lord suffers from in not heeding the warning of Di and Tian to mend his ways and the relationship between the shen Rushou and Di and Tian , in which Rushou is identified as the punisher of Tian and is said to be employed by Tian for this purpose. The texťs overall didactic matches the idiom observed in the pre- vious examples from pre-Qin texts concerning the High Deities - improper rulers will be punished for their improprieties, usually through the loss of their state. This passage in the Guoyu , however, is interesting in providing narrative descriptions of both the shen and its relationship to Di and Tian that offer greater detail to the process of punishment that these extrahumans carry out and clearly shows these High Deities can certainly be understood in these texts within the framework of supernatural punishment theory- moralizing agents who punish vice and reward virtue. Zuozhuan Xuan 3.3 The Prince of Chu attacked Luhun Zhirong49 and then reached the Luo river where he displayed his army in full view on the borders of Zhou. King Ding sent Wangsun Man50 to work things out with the Prince of Chu. The Prince of Chu heard about the size and weight of the cauldrons from him.51 He replied, "I rely on virtue, not on caul- drons. In the past, just when the Xia had virtue, distant lands painted things and tribute money came from the nine shepherds. They cast cauldrons with the images of things, and when the hundred things were put onto them, they were complete. This made the people under- stand the divine and the wicked. Thus when the people entered the rivers, swamps, mountains and forests, they did not encounter the improper. And as for the demons, monsters and beasties, none were able to encounter them. Then they were able to bring harmony between the upper and the lower so as to inherit the gift of Heaven [Tian]. When Jie had sullied virtue, the cauldrons moved to Shang for six hundred years. When Zhou of Shang terrorized and brutalized, the cauldrons moved to Zhou. When virtue is beautiful and clear, although they are small, they are important. When their wickedness turns round to sullied confusion, although they are large, they are unimportant. 49 A location in modern Henan province. 5 A Zhou noble.

Though intended to awe the attacking Prince of Chu into submission, the prince counters by com- menting that the cauldrons are of no concern to him; rather, he values the moral quality of virtue. To the Prince of Chu these caul- drons are not a source of virtue but are, rather, a by-product of it, cast by the morally proper to instruct the people; though they may be large and impressive, in the hands of the immoral, they are not important. According to the Prince, socio-political authority is a reward by Tian to people of virtue, and as such this is what he respects. This exposition prompts the reader to understand that the Prince of Chu will not attack the Zhou, as they are still virtuous and rewarded by Heaven with socio-political power. From the perspective of extrahumans, this passage once again represents Tian in the idiom of punishment and reward. In terms of the historiography developed by these texts, one again can see a justification of the changing of dynasties through the representation of these agents as punishers and rewarders in this passage. One could argue that given the proximity in time that these two texts have with the earlier Shangshu and Shijing , that these idioms and representations could represent a late Zhou/early Warring States 52Zuozhuan (1990: Xuan 3.3.669-3.3.672).</page><page sequence="26">Clark and Winslett: Evolutionary Psychology of Chinese Religion 953 understanding of these extrahumans which changes in the middle and late Warring States. This would not hold with arguments in cognitive science that would argue for a greater, more temporally and geographi- cally blind set of religious paradigms and idioms, such as supernatural punishment theory, owing to basic human cognitive faculties. Indeed, representations as punishers and rewarders can be observed throughout texts from the entire Warring States, as indicated through the roughly third-century ВСЕ Mozi , Mencius and Xunzi already discussed and by a text dated to the very close of the Warring States, the Lüshi chunqiu. A huge compendium of a diverse array of topics and subjects, this text is representative of a world-building text, what Mark Edward Lewis (1999: 303-308) points out as the start of an "encyclopedic epoch" of writing, wherein a prescriptive microcosm of the world is constructed within the text, a genre that becomes dominant in the early Han. As such, extrahuman agents, such as the High Deities, are also represented in this microcosm constructed by the text and tend to appear often in sections devoted to socio-political and religious discourse. Liishi chunqiu 6.4 King Wen asked, "What steps do you suggest that I take to avert it?" They replied, "Initiate projects and encourage the multitude to enlarge the city walls. Surely this could avert it!" King Wen said, "No, I cannot permit that. Heaven [Tian] exhibits inauspicious signs when it intends to punish the guilty. I must cer- tainly be guilty of something, and that is why Heaven [Tian] has done this- to punish me. Now were I to initiate projects and encourage the multitude to enlarge the city walls, that would simply multiply my guilt. No, I cannot permit it!" They replied, "Alter your conduct and multiply your good deeds in order to avert it. Surely this could evade such consequences." King Wen replied, "I, Chang, am requested to alter my conduct and multiply my good deeds in order to avert it."53 îcïs : тв: w*' тш, J 3CÏ0 : r^pj0 tilo ш*ш, iiozsukWì&amp;&amp; о шш J : гтшшшг, ¥о J 54 This passage explains proper socio-political behavior through the use of historical parables, a common trope in Warring States texts.

The ministers inform him that these are negative signs and urge him to "avert disaster." This passage marks a change, in contrast to the Shangshu , from the expository speeches given by culture-heroes to a narrative in which culture-heroes ask the advise of their ministers, a trope seen in other Warring States texts like the Mencius and Xunzi. In terms of extrahu- man representation, the idea that Tian punishes and does so for moral and socio-political reasons is still very much apparent in this passage. The king of Zhou argues that his illness and the earthquake, inauspi- cious signs, are punishments from Tian , something given only to the guilty. Although his ministers at first encourage him to urge on the masses, he states that as the faults are his, they are not the responsibility of the masses. The ministers then advise him to cultivate his own moral behavior to avert disaster, which the remainder of the passage states the king of Wen did. By according to proper moral behavior, which is asso- ciated with ritual, the reader is told the inauspicious signs disappeared and he reigned for fifty-one years.55 That inauspicious signs and calamities are punishment inflicted by Tian and Shangdi is emphasized elsewhere in this section, in 6.5 a list of ill omens is provided, often revolving around natural disasters, strange signs in the sky or oddities appearing in the countryside. The Lüshi chunqiu s argument as to why this happens is again explicitly stated as: Lüshi chunqiu S 6.5 If these anomalies appear in a state, but the ruler is not sufficiently alarmed to change his ways quickly, then the Supreme Sovereign [Shangdi] will send down misfortune, with catastrophes and disasters quickly following.

Tang thereupon offered a prayer at Singling in which he offered his own body as the pledge, beseeching: "If I, the One Man, am guilty, let the punishment not reach the myriad peoples. If the myriad peoples are guilty, let it rest on me, the One Man. Do not let the One Man's lack of diligence cause the Supreme Sovereign [Shangdi] and the ghosts and spirits to harm the lives of the people." Thereupon, he cut his hair, put his hands in manacles, and had himself prepared in lieu of the usual animals as the offering in a sac- rifice to beseech the blessings of the Supreme Sovereign [Shangdi]. The people were overjoyed, and the rains came as in a deluge.

This is not an understanding isolated to specific texts, or portions of texts, that represent a particular genre of literature (say, "Confucian") or period of time within the pre-Qin corpus, but rather representation that can be found throughout numerous different texts from the beginnings of Chinese literature, as seen in the Shangshu and Shijing to the end of the Warring States and the dawn of Imperial China in the Lüshi chunqiu. These representations manifest themselves in the earlier works of 58Knoblock and Riegel (2000: 210). 59 Lüshi chunqiu, (1984: 9.2.479).</page><page sequence="29">956 Journal of the American Academy of Religion historiography as evidenced by the Zuozhuan and Guoyu and even in the intellectual discourses of the Analects ( Lunyu ), Mozi , and the Zhuangzi. These examples are but a handful, though, of the more than four hundred other instances throughout other texts where these extrahu- man agents are observed to engage in punishing or rewarding others, as shown in Tables 1 and 2, and as such should only be taken to be the most representative of what is clearly a dominant understanding of these agents in pre-Qin texts. The representation as punishers and rewarders is often coupled into an idiom where these extra-human agents are also represented in moral terms in various capacities. In some instances, they are the source of moral providence while in others they are its guardian or defender. Whatever the case, they have strategic information about the morality or the lack thereof in humans, and, based on this information, provide proper punishments and rewards - wherein they punish vice and reward virtue as would be expected from the understanding of High Deities in a large population as described by supernatural punishment theory. Contrary to Gerneťs and Yu s arguments of a lack of theism in Early China and Graham's assertion that idioms of moralizing High Deities who are punishers and rewarders are common only in certain works like the Mozi , it is clear that such ideas were surprisingly common throughout texts produced at this time, often forming cautionary tales and moralizing advice to these text's intended readers. It is clear then that rather than being some small, ancillary realm dealt with by unpopular thinkers, or a vague enigmatic mess that cannot be understood, the realm of the extrahuman was an active area of engagement for many writers and thinkers in the pre-Qin who felt no compunctions in evoking it when need be and no problems in engaging in discourse on it when they felt such was necessary. That modern scholarship has ignored it for so long is unfortunate and partly due to the difficulties in methodology, but thanks to new approaches and the development of searchable databases, online texts, and new understandings of this period from a diverse range of fields, this lack of scholarship is beginning to be addressed and the realm of the extrahu- man in the pre-Qin is being explored.
