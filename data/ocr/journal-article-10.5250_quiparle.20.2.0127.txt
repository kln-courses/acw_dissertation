<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Unctuous Resentment in David Copperfi eld joseph litvak “That’ll do very well,” said Alice. “And ‘slithy’?” “Well, ‘slithy’ means ‘lithe and slimy.’” Humpty Dumpty explaining “Jabberwocky” to Alice in  Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass Near the end of David Copperfi eld, when David has become al- most as successful an author as the one who wrote this novel, his  aunt Betsey says to him: “I never thought, when I used to read  books, what work it was to write them!” David replies: “It’s work  enough to read them, sometimes.”1 Betsey misses her cue here, but  Mr. Omer, the merry undertaker, has earlier paid David the compli- ment for which his humble “sometimes” fi shes: “And since I’ve took to general reading, you’ve took to gener- al writing, eh, sir?” said Mr. Omer, surveying me admiringly.  “What a lovely work that was of yours! What expressions in it!  I read it every word—every word. And as to feeling sleepy! Not  at all!” (674) Nothing like a reader who doesn’t feel sleepy at all to betray a  novelist’s fear of overstaying his welcome—except, perhaps, the  novelist’s fretting, like Dickens’s in his preface to David Copper- </page> <page sequence="2"> 128 qui parle   spring/summer 2012   vol.20, no.2   fi eld, about the “danger of wearying the reader whom I love”  (9). Nor do you have to be the reader whom Dickens doesn’t  love to discern in yourself, as you make your way through David  Copperfi eld, the signs of a certain novel fatigue: the somatic in- dex of the obvious fact that novel-reading, like novel-writing, is  work. How many naps did I take with David Copperfi eld sitting  in my lap? As that image suggests, my fatigue wasn’t necessarily  the same thing as boredom, and my sleep didn’t necessarily mean  the absence of arousal: novel fatigue may well bespeak a labor of  love, by the reader as much as by the writer. Yet it is labor none- theless, and labor of an especially repetitive kind—so repetitive,  in fact, as to make you wonder how there can be any novelty in  the novel at all.2 For the novelty that is the overt promise of the novel as a genre  is what the Dickens novel in particular would seem to deliver in  abundance. To say “Dickens,” in other words, is to evoke the Nov- el as the literary apotheosis of life’s teeming richness and multiplic- ity—which, admittedly, can be wearying enough in themselves. But  to say “Dickens” is also to evoke the demonically insistent antilife  of compulsion and automatism, the mechanical specter haunting  exuberant novelness: not just a thematics but a virtual technology  of repetition that, putting the work into the work of art, makes  novelistic vitality, like the news that’s always old, seem merely a  gimmick in the service of an incipient culture industry. Not that  the work of Dickensian writing and reading, however industrious,  ever looks or feels particularly industrial—like the work, that is,  of the industrial working class in the nineteenth century. As critics  since George Orwell have observed, the imaginaire of Dickensian  work, at the level of character, centers on the semi-anachronistic  fi gure of the servant.3 At the level of authorship, work is the pre- rogative of the Master: when a rising David Copperfi eld speaks  of the “Ordeal of Servants” (590), he means, of course, the or- deal of having servants, not the ordeal of being one. And yet, the  possibility of slippage from having to being, to say nothing of an  even more traumatic déclassement like that suffered by the young  Dickens, or by his fi ctional surrogate David, produces in Dickens’s  work the aggressive “humility,” the manic eagerness to please, the  </page> <page sequence="3"> Litvak: Resentment in David Copperfi eld 129 sullenly conservative class-consciousness, the murderous, transpar- ently disguised ambition, and the tendency to bite the hand that  feeds him (when he isn’t licking it) that make Dickens, majordomo  in a literary genre dominated by governesses, cockneys, and over- achieving provincials, a veritable servant’s servant, the servant par  excellence.4 “Who can tell,” asked Walter Benjamin, “how much  servant curiosity became part of Proust’s fl attery, how much ser- vant fl attery became mixed with his curiosity?”5 The same ques- tion could be asked about Dickens, with servant curiosity and ser- vant fl attery taking their places alongside, or rather, beneath, the  Dickensian master affect: servant resentment, whose prefi x signals  the essentially repetitive character of the strenuous emotional work  undertaken by author and reader alike. Reading a Dickens novel, after all, is nothing if not a labor of  resentment: a vicarious reopening of narcissistic wounds as eroti- cally rewarding as its implicit retaliation for them, a rehearsal—as  the French would say, a répétition—of past injuries and future re- venges. Take the already-repetitive structure of resentment—as the  French, and Nietzsche, would say, ressentiment—and repeat it over  the space of, say, eight hundred pages, and you have a recipe for  success in a world where resentment and subjectivity are indistin- guishable from each other, and where mass entertainment, relent- lessly ministering to our resentment, teaches us how to be our- selves.6 Resentment rarely chooses to know itself, however, in the  fi gure, at once insuffi ciently glamorous and insuffi ciently abject,  of the domestic servant. Instead, in Dickens as in today’s culture  industry, which owes so much to him, the poster child for resent- ment is, precisely, the child: the servant’s victim, or occasionally  even the servant’s friend, but someone much more lovable than the  servant—as lovable, in fact, as little me, with all my delectable in- nocence, plus the eloquent moral indignation that constitutes nine- tenths of my grown-up cultural capital.7 “What is that upon your face?” “Dirt,” I said. He knew it was the mark of tears as well as I. But if he had  asked the question twenty times, each time with twenty blows,  </page> <page sequence="4"> 130 qui parle   spring/summer 2012   vol.20, no.2   I believe my baby heart would have burst before I would have  told him so. (51) . . . it is a matter of some surprise to me, even now, that I can  have been so easily thrown away at such an age. A child of ex- cellent abilities, and with strong powers of observation, quick,  eager, and delicate, and soon hurt bodily or mentally, it seems  wonderful to me that nobody should have made any sign in my  behalf. (150) Only in the shaky syntax of that last sentence does the “splay foot”  (354) of the novel’s semi-educated villain, the hypocritical, unctu- ously mock-humble Uriah Heep, reveal itself. But then, once he  gets his foot in the door, he starts to pop up everywhere in this heap  of a novel: “He seemed to grow and swell before my very eyes”  (355), writes David, whom Agnes “earnestly entreats”: “Don’t re- sent (as I think you have a general disposition to do) what may be  uncongenial to you in him” (345).8 So general as to extend beyond  Uriah Heep (who extends beyond himself); so general, in fact, as  to comprehend almost every other character in the novel, David’s  resentful disposition targets what he fi nds uncongenial because all  too congenial, in the etymological sense of the word: irritating- ly in accord with his own touchy spirit—that of the master who  isn’t one, as Uriah wickedly reminds the adult David every time  he “slips” and addresses him as “Master Copperfi eld” (e.g., 352),  treating him not as the adorable little gentleman he’ll always be but  as a fellow “upstart” (697) who needs cutting down to size. With  somebody similarly threatening to make him say “You’re I, ah”  just about everywhere he goes, Master Copperfi eld can only keep  refusing to recognize these resentful repetitions of himself, system- atically reading his social belittlement through the self-aggrandiz- ing optic of a child abuse that never stops.9 The abuse never stops because the abusers must constantly be  recruited, in the best nineteenth-century way, from the limitless fi c- tional population of servants, with whom the ambitious middle- aged child—“a child of excellent abilities and with strong pow- ers of observation, quick, eager, and delicate”—would otherwise  have to acknowledge an unwelcome specular relation. Has any- </page> <page sequence="5"> Litvak: Resentment in David Copperfi eld 131 one noticed how much time David Copperfi eld spends being tor- mented by the help, especially by those whose “familiar” (274)  manner threatens to make him one of their family? A persistent  concern of Victorian novels in general is what to do if the ser- vants insult you, but even prickly Jane Eyre has nothing on Da- vid Copperfi eld when it comes to petulant status-consciousness.  Cheated, bullied, mocked, slighted, seen through, or merely seen  by a whole parade of insolent waiters, chambermaids, coachmen,  manservants, and lady’s companions, David typically complains of  how these painful encounters leave him feeling “dreadfully young”  (269). But youth, far from being the problem here, covers up the  defi cits of class that observant servants (or should I say other ob- servant servants?) have an unheimliche ability to spot. For this  ability, an abuse in itself, they must of course be punished—re- sentment will have its revenge—and their punishment consists not  just in their being servants but in their remaining servants: while  the minor they’ve assaulted keeps on rising above them, attaining  his majority by mastering—though not without missteps—a lan- guage in which repetition signifi es stylistic virtuosity, these stunted  creatures are forever trapped in an oddly homogeneous Babel of  broken languages, of jargons and catchphrases, dialects and idio- lects, in which repetition signifi es or, more accurately, symptoma- tizes the stupidity, hysteria, and monotony that they deserve. “I’m  a very umble person.” “Barkis is willin’.” “Something will turn  up.” “I never will desert Mr. Micawber.” “I only ask for informa- tion.” “Ain’t I volatile?” “I am a very helpless and defenceless little  thing.” “I am a lone lorn creetur.” “I am a mother myself.” The  “comic” world of the minor Dickens character is a passive-aggres- sive hell, carpeted in wall-to-wall shtick.10 And if every Dickens  servant is permanently minor, as opposed to being, like the Dickens  hero, forever young, every minor character in Dickens is in effect  a servant, sing-singing for his supper the same old tune—is there  any other song besides “Love Me, Goddamnit”?—over and over  and over. Without surrendering any of his precious vulnerability,  little DC grows up to become big CD, who gets to give his enemies  sentences that keep them busy going nowhere.11 Writing well is no doubt the best revenge, for better or for worse.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 132 qui parle   spring/summer 2012   vol.20, no.2   Rising above the servants linguistically—even if that means failing  to rise above the resentment that binds him to them all the more  closely, and that has them all working away diligently in the vast  resentment-machine that is the Dickens novel—David Copperfi eld,  as many readers have testifi ed, becomes a seductive locus of reader- ly identifi cation. (Although Virginia Woolf claimed that no one can  remember the fi rst time he or she read this novel, I could never for- get mine. A quick, eager, delicate boy of thirty-seven, I totally felt  that David’s story was my story.) But even if you choose not to be  seduced, you don’t necessarily get outside the resentment-machine  that is hardly limited to the Dickens novel, however paradigmatic  a place the latter may occupy in the former. For getting outside that  machine entails far more than getting outside the culture industry  that Dickens helped to invent. The sarcasm with which cultural  studies talks about the culture industry is obviously a case of sib- ling, or rather, servant rivalry. Resenting the resentment-machine:  how novel is that? About as novel as the novel itself. Which is to  say that there may be something to be said for repetition. The rep- etition called resentment derives some of its staying power, at any  rate, from the fact that resentment, in addition to being a kind of  remembering, is also a potentially useful critical tool: you really  are abused, although maybe not in the way you think you are.12  But what if resentment’s knowledge precludes other knowledges?  Like Mr. Dick’s incessant copying of texts in order to keep the ever- encroaching thought of Charles I’s beheading out of his head, the  work of resentment can be a strategy for defl ecting similar thoughts  of political and personal terror. Yet, just as the slightly cracked  Charles-less Dick, a would-be autobiographer himself, already in- timates an authorial corps morcelé—that is, just as a certain dam- age has already been done, and not only at the level of the name— so the work of resentment suggests a desperate, endless coddling  of Humpty Dumpty, an exhausting, all-consuming struggle to keep  arresting his fall. “I went in, and found there a stoutish, middle- aged person, in a brown surtout and black tights and shoes, with  no more hair upon his head (which was a very large one, and very  shining) than there is upon an egg” (152). Wait: that’s Mr. Micaw- ber, not Mr. Dick.13 But then, so many of the characters look, and  </page> <page sequence="7"> Litvak: Resentment in David Copperfi eld 133 sound, alike. “I’m only Mr. Dick,” says Mr. Dick, adding his voice  to the swollen chorus of the aggrieved. “And who minds Dick?  Dick’s nobody!” (603). Needless to say, everybody minds Dick, in  two senses of the word “minds,” whereby taking care of Dick and  resenting Dick are one and the same activity: the work of resent- ment is a culture-wide operation of the costliest kind. Not that this  effort of damage control doesn’t hold Mr. Dick together, such as he  is, or even furnish the very principle of his coherence—along with  the coherence of the political and social body supposedly secured  by all the king’s horses and all the king’s men.14 Like all damage  control, however, the work of resentment is entirely determined by  the danger that it seeks to minimize, whether that danger takes the  form of terror, of passion, of joy, or merely of pleasure. Never a  dreary factory, the resentment-machine, of course, can feel as cozy  as one’s home, and no resentment-machine is cozier than a Dickens  novel. But what about those servants, without whom the coziness  of the home would be diffi cult to maintain, and who at the same  time make the home so uncozy? As critics like Harry Levin and Bruce Robbins have argued, the  servant in nineteenth-century fi ction embodies the disavowed pre- history of the bourgeoisie itself.15 We know that almost every Vic- torian novel is a Cinderella story. But how many middle-class prin- cess heroines wish to see themselves in the girl who cleans out the  chimney—especially since the latter represents not only the past  but also the present of the former, the role of middle-class princess,  or for that matter of middle-class prince, involving a certain servi- tude of its own? Less the failure the parvenu has overcome than the  inconveniently close prototype of parvenu “success,” the servants  are themselves the dirty secret that they have to keep cleaning up.  In disavowing the servant, that is, the middle-class master disavows  the elasticity of Service as a category, lest he fi nd himself included  in it. Although Uriah Heep stands out as David Copperfi eld’s pre- eminent monster of resentment—and the competition is stiff—he is  not a servant in the way that Peggotty or Littimer or Mrs. Crupp is  a servant. As a solicitor’s clerk, he enjoys a measure of petit bour- geois respectability, and he in fact moves up in the world—illicitly  and only temporarily, to be sure—taking over the solicitor’s prac- </page> <page sequence="8"> 134 qui parle   spring/summer 2012   vol.20, no.2   tice. Yet Uriah’s worst crime, far more egregious than the fraud  and forgery for which he is fi nally imprisoned, is his “deferential  servility” (354), his servant-like masquerade, because, as I hinted  in my opening remark about David’s coercive humble act, it consti- tutes a grotesque parody of David’s—and Dickens’s—own winning  ways.16 Long before he exposes David as his brother-upstart, in fact  from the very moment he comes oozing into the novel, Uriah is Da- vid’s double and therefore the novel’s number-one scapegoat. Were  David to accept the interpellation issuing from Uriah’s so-called  Christian name, were he to follow Uriah’s doting mother in regard- ing him as “my Ury” (527), instead of following his biblical name- sake in sentencing Uriah’s biblical namesake to a kind of death, he  might then have to undergo a genuine humbling: he might, that is,  have to confront the violent subjection built into his triumphant  subjectivity, the inherent and inescapable sycophancy of his profes- sional “success.” For even when the Cinderella-protagonist of the  Victorian novel isn’t also, as David calls himself, “Scheherazade”  (94), even when the star isn’t a storyteller under pressure, the story  the Victorian novel repeatedly tells is a story of repetition: a story  of how the parvenu can never really parvenir, since, always a ser- vant, even when playing the palace, she or he can never stop do- ing the routine that keeps the resentment-machine going. After all,  nothing does more than the star turn to perpetuate the whole envi- ous, vengeful cycle of modern and postmodern Bildung, in and out  of the Roman. The more David Copperfi eld climbs to the top of  the heap, the more this autobiographical novel can’t seem to think  the king without thinking beheading. As reassuring as it is terrifying—reassuring insofar as it manages  terror—the obsessive thought of losing your head has the advan- tage of giving narrative form both to the individual subject and  to the kingdom itself. As a narrative, the parvenu’s tale—in some  sense terminated, though in principle interminable—is of course  about the inevitable failure within a certain success. Even at the  end, some people are still treating David Copperfi eld like a no- body, and even if he got rid of them, he would still have the task  he’s had from the beginning: seeing to it that his admiring survey- ors continue to survey him admiringly. Yet if the parvenu has to  </page> <page sequence="9"> Litvak: Resentment in David Copperfi eld 135 keep making it over and over again, constantly proving himself a  nonservant and thus constantly proving himself a servant, then he  always stays at a stylized, asymptotic distance from whatever lies  just beyond the spiral staircase in which he is doomed, or privi- leged, to go on turning. To lose this distance would be to risk the  unmanageable terror of what might be called an Un-bildung. Da- vid hates Uriah Heep because Uriah does, or is, an unlovable imi- tation of David’s demand for love. “And yet I always liked you,  Copperfi eld!” (572), Uriah whines, just after David slaps him and  just before David admits, “He knew me better than I knew myself”  (573). But this intolerable perspicacity alone can’t account for the  almost pornographic extent to which Uriah gets under, or rather  on, David’s skin: “But oh, what a clammy hand his was! as ghostly  to the touch as to the sight! I rubbed mine afterwards, to warm it,  and to rub his off” (215). Not even David, though, is taken in by  his dutiful pantomime of revulsion: But, seeing a light in the little round offi ce, and immediately feel- ing myself attracted towards Uriah Heep, who had a sort of fas- cination for me, I went in there instead. I found Uriah reading a  great fat book, with such demonstrative attention, that his lank  forefi nger followed up every line as he read, and made clammy  tracks along the page (or so I fully believed) like a snail. (222) Compulsively, convulsively fi gured as a clam, a snail, a snake  (224), a fi sh (225, 355), a frog (352), Uriah, fi fteen years old when  he fi rst appears, fascinates David in part by holding out a sticky  hand to pull him into a magical adolescent night world of auto-  and homoerotic delights: a world whose mysteries are legendarily  bound up with secretive practices of reading and writing, or at  least of reading and writhing, to invoke Uriah’s characteristic mo- tion, itself signaling the scriptive effect of a clammy track-making  or snaily trace-leaving. Yet the viscous fascination of Uriah Heep—whose very name  suggests the secrets of the water closet—is not so easily circum- scribed in time or space. If it were, it wouldn’t pose much of a  problem for the bildungsroman, which always fi nds a way of put- ting the pervert to work. Indeed, the fascination of Uriah doesn’t  </page> <page sequence="10"> 136 qui parle   spring/summer 2012   vol.20, no.2   even require Uriah to mobilize it. Here are David and Mr. Peggotty  on the track of the prostitute Martha, whom they’ve raptly fol- lowed to a lush scene of riverfront squalor: Slimy gaps and causeways, winding among the old wooden piles,  with a sickly substance clinging to the latter, like green hair, and  the rags of last year’s handbills offering rewards for drowned  men fl uttering above high-water mark, led down through the  ooze and slush to the ebb tide. . . . As if she were part of the refuse it had cast out, and left to cor- ruption and decay, the girl we had followed strayed down to the  river’s bank, and stood in the midst of this night-picture, lonely  and still, looking at the water. (626) Uriah doesn’t need to be here, except in the metonymic link be- tween “piles” and “heaps,” because, through his example of the  deliquescent body, of bodies deliquescing into other bodies, he’s  already infected David with the desire that David, like a good Vic- torian urban sociologist, now projects onto the object of his re- search—a desire to become “part of the refuse” to which he fi nds  himself as disturbingly attracted as he was to Uriah, repeating in  reverse a dirty scene from an earlier Dickens novel: “As he glided  stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and door- ways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile,  engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved:  crawling forth, by night, in search of some rich offal for a meal.”17  The hideous old man, gliding out of the ooze and slime back into  which David, touched by Uriah, will dream of melting, is none  other than Uriah’s confrere in reptilian, redheaded villainy: Fagin,  or simply “the Jew,” as Dickens calls him in Oliver Twist. Uriah,  who knows another upstart when he sees one, gives parvenus a  bad name; but if that name is his own, this makes Uriah a pariah  as well. Nothing so unusual here: as Hannah Arendt points out,  the parvenu and the pariah are “brothers under the skin.”18 The  brother who gets on your skin, and whom you can’t rub off, creepy  Uriah, however, stands for something more diffuse than a partic- ular character or pathology or minority-group politics: he grows  and swells and, more important, seeps into parts of the novel that  </page> <page sequence="11"> Litvak: Resentment in David Copperfi eld 137 don’t appear to contain him, and even, metaleptically, into other  Dickens novels. In one sense an all too readably novelistic entity,  the resentment-machine’s wretched refuse, the anthropomorphic  residue of its own oily effi ciency, Uriah Heep simply abuses fl attery  as a more or less standard rhetorical aid in the ambitious young  man’s would-be brilliant career, turning a little dab of deference  into the greasy kid’s stuff of unctuousness.19 The nineteenth-centu- ry Eddie Haskell, he caricatures, in his hysterical automatism, the  subservience to grown-ups under which the other teenagers labor  less fl amingly.20 But just as the slimy “charm” of middle Ameri- ca’s teen-Satan tended to surpass its ostensible lubricant function,  spreading out into a lubricious, talismanic stain of fascination,  both for and with other boys, and thus into an alluring emblem  of that erotic adhesion banalized as the crush, so Uriah’s unctu- ousness at certain points exceeds any moral determination (this  is how not to get ahead) as it exceeds any worldly effi cacy (this is  how to get ahead). “I have always overfl owed towards you since  the fi rst moment I had the pleasure of beholding you” (355), Uriah  tells David. And so he has, his superabundant unctuousness—“he  writhed and undulated all over” (354)—constituting the unstable,  intransitive medium for a fl oating fantasy irreducible to the mere  specular identifi cation announced by his name, or even to the ur- gent business of minding Dick: a fantasy of Un-bildung, of ecstatic  desubjectifi cation, that, in the style of Deleuze and Guattari, and  with a nod to Humpty Dumpty, we might call becoming-mayon- naise. Who would know better than Uriah Heep what a joy it must  be to stop sucking up, to refuse the social imperative of charm that  keeps one gratifying others, and instead to become the repulsive,  unsocializable substance of gratifi cation itself? So irresistible is this fantasy that it keeps David obsessively  checking on Uriah, whom he has invited to spend the night in his  rooms: There I saw him, lying on his back, with his legs extending to  I don’t know where, gurglings taking place in his throat, stop- pages in his nose, and his mouth open like a post-offi ce. He was  so much worse in reality than in my distempered fancy, that af- </page> <page sequence="12"> 138 qui parle   spring/summer 2012   vol.20, no.2   terwards I was attracted to him in very repulsion, and could not  help wandering in and out every half hour or so, and taking an- other look at him.21 Attracted to Uriah in very repulsion, repeating himself as if to  break out of repetition, David, with clock-like regularity, assumes  his usual stance in this latest rehearsal of his primal scene, where  the object of his captivated nocturnal gaze is another boy in bed. In  the beginning the object is the dreamy Steerforth (90); now it is the  considerably less hunky Uriah-whose very lack of solidity, how- ever, makes for much of his attractiveness. For with “his legs ex- tending to I don’t know where, gurglings taking place in his throat,  [and] stoppages in his nose,” Uriah presents the disgustingly deli- cious spectacle of the body suspended between liquid and solid,  “between sleeping and waking”:22 dissolved, or, better yet, only  half-dissolved, in thick, blissful, oleaginous oblivion. Who could  blame David for not being able to stay away? Introduced into the  novel as the grotesque semblance of a “carved head” (209) on the  end of a beam, Uriah epitomizes the gargoylish ontology of the  minor Dickens character tout court. But here the gargoyle gurgles,  as though literalizing the etymology that makes it overfl ow. Con- structing himself against the gargoyles, the hero of the novel nev- ertheless shares with them the hardness conferred by a lifetime of  resentful Bildung. What is he to do, though, when the gargoyle  of gargoyles, no longer a garg-oyle but just oil, goes soft, as if to  slide right off the building—or when, like a post-offi ce, it opens  its mouth and emits the message embedded in the unctuous semi- liquidity of mayonnaise: “you may”? Only for so long can David  stand in helpless fascination, mimetic in its own suspended uncer- tainty; after all, in the morning he has to go back to work—so,  snapping out of his “waking nightmare” (357), or remembering  that it is a nightmare, and pretending to forget the attraction in re- pulsion, he tries once again to rub Uriah off: “When I went out to  the Commons, I charged Mrs. Crupp with particular directions to  leave the windows open, that my sitting-room might be aired, and  purged of his presence” (358). That the dream of becoming mayonnaise can curdle into mere  nightmare is perhaps indicated by the morbidly excremental color- </page> <page sequence="13"> Litvak: Resentment in David Copperfi eld 139 ation it takes on in the scenes describing Martha amid the “corrup- tion and decay” of the riverfront and the Jew creeping forth from  the slime and darkness that engendered him.23 Even the mucous  consistency of the various animals Uriah is compared to, like that  of the “stoppages in his nose,” helps David reduce his attraction- in-repulsion to so much aversion therapy. In turning away, howev- er, from his acknowledged fascination with Uriah, and from their  undeniable attachment to each other, David merely turns back into  the novelistic resentment-machine, in which Uriah is one of the  hardest workers—though not as hard a worker as David—but from  which Uriah also signifi es a fantasy of escape. Perhaps it is because  Uriah works so hard that he wants out. Repeatedly producing sub- jects who repeat themselves and one another, the Dickens novel  makes exorbitant demands not only on its author and its reader  but on its characters as well. Indeed, novel fatigue would seem to  be the Dickens character’s main occupational hazard.24 In view of  the arduous, not to say tedious, effort necessary to maintain those  hard shells, especially when, as is so often the case, they contain  soft centers, and given the impossibility of getting resent out of rep- resentation, it is surprising, in fact, that more Dickens characters  don’t have nervous breakdowns. As if the job of keeping oneself  together weren’t already stressful enough, the resentful labor of the  Dickens character isn’t just about the care of the individual subject,  about defending it against all the other good and bad eggs: at stake  is nothing less than national security itself, for the sake of which  every subject has a patriotic duty to band together with every other  subject in resenting, that is, in cultivating, their common enemy.  David Copperfi eld has only one Jew joke, and it’s told by the uni- versally beloved Mr. Micawber (710); but then, a Dickens novel  needs only one Jew joke, just as this Dickens novel needs, and gets,  one French joke and one “mulatto” joke. The novel, moreover,  needs its domestic pariahs as much as its foreign ones. The pariah  as parvenu, and vice versa, Uriah Heep serves an important pur- pose, after all, in helping Cinderfella not to know himself. Yet, in  fi guring a certain will-to-emulsifi cation, Uriah moves beyond pa- riah identity, or, better, below it, to crack it open and release some- thing like a pariah erotics—an erotics overfl owing, for instance,  </page> <page sequence="14"> 140 qui parle   spring/summer 2012   vol.20, no.2   into Fagin the Jew, Martha the prostitute, and David Copperfi eld  himself, perhaps even into that Uriah without a U, namely Riah,  the saintly Jewish “fairy godmother” of Our Mutual Friend. Over- performing the task of his own character-building, and with it the  task of nation-building, Uriah exudes the obscene, contagious sexi- ness of what might not work so well for the resentment-machine,  even by working resentfully against it. Of course, everything happens as if Uriah Heep, like all Dick- ens characters, worked just fi ne, as indeed he does. Even his au- toeroticism, under proper supervision, helps build the automaton  of Dickensian subjectivity. That is, even the writhings and jerk- ings and “snaky twistings” (224) of his convulsive sexuality, inge- niously matching the “corkscrew”-like (243) effi ciency and tenac- ity with which he and his mother extract information from David,  inscribe a virtual diagram of resentment, in which a masochistic  doubling back upon the self, a resuffering of the wound, implies a  sadistic return outward, an imagined but nonetheless equally en- joyable movement toward avenging the wound.25 Commanding a  powerful erotics of its own, resentment works, because, like the  culture industry with which it coincides, its work usually passes  for play: in resentment, the “externally” imposed repetition-com- pulsion of alienated labor becomes inseparable from the “internal- ly” embraced repetition-compulsion of sexuality—which in turn  constitutes the most intimate authentication of one’s most private  subjectivity, as comfortable and as comforting as one’s favorite  revenge fantasy. The constant serpentine winding whereby Uriah  Heep comes together (as opposed to the unctuous discharge where- by, left to his own devices, he comes apart) models not only the  genetic structure, the DNA, of resentment itself, but also resent- ment’s signature product and proudest achievement: the corkscrew  narrative of the parvenu’s endless upward spiral, otherwise known  as the Victorian novel. But sometimes, especially if you are one of  the little people the hero has had to step on in his perpetual, diz- zying ascent, if you are one of the mere supporting actors in the  Dickens dream factory, made to bear the weight of the resentment  that’s been projected onto you so that Master Copperfi eld can keep  on nursing his inner child, and if it’s you, quite frankly, who taught  him everything he knows, then being a model character, or, which  </page> <page sequence="15"> Litvak: Resentment in David Copperfi eld 141 amounts to the same thing, a “Model Prisoner” (781), as Uriah  Heep in fact ends up, could make you want to scream “Stop the  novel, I want to get off.”26 Getting off isn’t much of an escape, of course, if what defi nes it,  like what produces the desire for it, is simply more resentment. As  the onanistic Uriah Heep suggests, however, getting off can also  mean getting out: or at least—to borrow Horkheimer and Ador- no’s “emblem of intelligence”—sticking a snail’s feeler out of the  hard, spiral shell and feeling something else.27 When resentment  loses its charm, to the point where even resenting it is no fun any- more, a person might, for example, ease up on personhood, at  least on personhood as it is mechanically, and novelistically, repro- duced. The novel-character’s longing for a novelty that the nov- el doesn’t afford, perhaps a condition endemic to the novel as a  genre, would seem to present a particularly severe personnel prob- lem in Dickens, where the “comic” minor fi gures make up most  of the company. For if novel fatigue or, worse, novel panic sets in  when the work of staying in character night after night, show after  show, just ceases to be sexy, imagine the discontent of the comé- dien who fi nds that the endless comedy is no longer funny. The  genius of the resentment system consists in mitigating repetition’s  tedium by exploiting not only the eroticism inherent in repetition  but its Bergsonian comic potential as well. The exhaust generated  by that exhausting machine, unctuous Uriah, anyway, might evade  comic as much as erotic compulsion: condemned to get shticky by  getting sticky, he makes more goo than the machine needs, work- ing so hard that he works soft. But don’t other Dickens characters  ever get tired of being mechanical encrustations upon the living?  And what might they do when being hysterical stops being hilari- ous—when the routine of embodying the same symptom over and  over becomes just that, routine, taking on the normative, stultify- ing force of, say, seriousness? Uriah Heep may not in fact be the only disaffected contract play- er in the Dickens studio, or even in David Copperfi eld. Consider,  for instance, the case of Rosa Dartle, the high-strung poor relation  and lady’s companion who, when her dashing cousin Steerforth  asks her to sing and play an Irish song, deviates from the script: </page> <page sequence="16"> 142 qui parle   spring/summer 2012   vol.20, no.2   I don’t know what it was, in her touch or voice, that made the  song the most unearthly I have ever heard in my life, or can  imagine. There was something fearful in the reality of it. It was  as if it had never been written, or set to music, but sprung out of  the passion within her; which found imperfect utterance in the  low sounds of her voice, and crouched again when all was still. I  was dumb when she leaned beside the harp again, playing it, but  not sounding it, with her right hand. A minute more, and this had roused me from my trance:— Steerforth had left his seat, and gone to her, and had put his arm  laughingly about her, and had said, “Come, Rosa, for the future  we will love each other very much!” And she had struck him,  and had thrown him off with the fury of a wild cat, and had  burst out of the room. (404) Asking for Irish song, Steerforth gets more than he bargained for:  instead of what he wants—the dulcet lyricizing-away of Rosa’s  trademark staccato style, bristling with thorny questions (“Is it re- ally though?”; “Is it—eh?” [280])—what Rosa delivers, out of her  colonized (though not exactly subjugated) love for him, is a quasi- operatic meltdown, her version of Urian (or is it Heepian?) deve- nir-mayonnaise. As David’s “trance” makes clear, this is a thrilling  moment in the novel, all the more so for its “imperfect utterance”:  a moment as breathtaking and as dumbfounding as the most ex- plosive diva-esque tour de force. For that very reason, however,  this particular Rosa’s turn must not be permitted to stop the show.  Like a nervous impresario covering for his overwrought seconda  donna, Steerforth wastes no time in attempting to reduce Rosa’s  “unearthly” performance to a joke. “Put[ting] his arm laughingly  about her,” promising to love her “very much”—which is to say,  not enough—he would gather her back into the comic fold of re- sentment, where her job is to keep reciting her rigorously legible  neurotic lines the way they were written, not to improvise some  “fearful” cri de coeur that sounds “as if it had never been writ- ten” at all. Steerforth’s attempt to lay down the Law of Comedy  obviously meets with some resistance when Rosa “str[ikes] him,  and thr[ows] him off with the fury of a wild cat, and . . . burst[s]  </page> <page sequence="17"> Litvak: Resentment in David Copperfi eld 143 out of the room.” Then again, there’s always been something a  little scary about the scarred Rosa, not least because, in her comic  hysteria, the violence of all Dickensian resentment, while not, like  her scar, literally on the surface, is as close to it as a crouching  animal waiting to pounce.28 Fascinated by Uriah, David fi nds him- self “dreaming about him, for what appeared to me to be half the  night” (225). Unnerved by Rosa, he has a similar response. Spend- ing the night at Steerforth’s, in a room with a “startling likeness”  (280) of Rosa “above the chimney-piece” (280), I wondered peevishly why they couldn’t put her anywhere else  instead of quartering her on me. To get rid of her, I undressed  quickly, extinguished my light, and went to bed. But, as I fell  asleep, I could not forget that she was still there looking. “Is  it really, though? I want to know”; and when I awoke in the  night, I found that I was uneasily asking all sorts of people in my  dreams whether it really was or not—without knowing what I  meant. (280) David can’t rub Uriah off his skin, and he can’t seem to “get rid of”  Rosa either: fi nding her “quarter[ed] . . . on” him, he awakes—or  is he still dreaming?—with pieces of her sticking to his person. He  oozes with and into Uriah Heep; Rosa Dartle gets on his nerves,  which turn into her, as he “uneasily” imitates her edgy idiolect (“Is  it really, though? I want to know”). In each case, the author-fi gure’s  hygienic distance from the more obviously subordinate character is  compromised. Yet what he risks is not merely sliding back into the  servant position: more excitingly, more troublingly, he risks sliding  with the servant out of the resentment-machine predicated upon  that very anxiety of déclassement. Smeared with Uriah, David gets Dartled too, in a similarly dis- concerting process of ecstatic overfl ow. His dream of Rosa, of be- coming Rosa, anticipates, moreover, his trance in the aftermath of  her unearthly song. For if, in the dream scene, he fi nds himself talk- ing like her “without knowing what I meant,” the singing scene of- fers him a clue, since, there, dumbstruck, he fi nds himself desiring  like her: he hears in her frighteningly real song an echo of his own  passion for Steerforth, and then witnesses, in Steerforth’s “laugh- </page> <page sequence="18"> 144 qui parle   spring/summer 2012   vol.20, no.2   ingly” brutal charade of not-getting-it, a chilling preview of the  fun-making discipline likely to befall him should he be so reckless  as to let the cat out of the bag. It isn’t simply that David and Rosa  both love Steerforth: they both love him in the same structural re- lation to him—the structural relation of, precisely, the servant. For  both Rosa and “Daisy,” as Steerforth calls David, Steerforth’s cha- risma owes as much to his whole intoxicating mystique of aristo- cratic privilege as to his “handsome face” (90) and his “rich profu- sion of brown hair” (309). The supremely distinguished Steerforth  is not just what the parvenu wants to be: he is what the parvenu  wants, with an erotic and affective intensity far greater than any  other feeling in the book, including David’s complicated attraction  to Uriah Heep.29 Steerforth is also, therefore, the one character Da- vid won’t allow himself to resent, although Steerforth, suffering  from (that is, making others suffer from) an advanced case of at- tention defi cit disorder, gives David ample reason to do so. Here,  Rosa differs from David: whereas his parvenu melancholia pre- vents him from owning his anger toward Steerforth, she has clearly  overcome any such inhibition by the time she “str[ikes] him” and  “throw[s] him off with the fury of a wild cat.”30 Not for nothing,  though, has David been haunted by Rosa long before the crouch- ing tiger—both her passion and her rage at its refusal—“burst[s]”  out of her and then “out of the room.” From David’s canine per- spective-don’t forget that this is the hero who bites his stepfather’s  hand—the scariest thing about the feline Rosa is how she reminds  him of what he would rather not know: that, whether avowed or  not, resentment, a work of Bildung, sometimes bursts out of Bil- dung, and sometimes just bursts it; in short, that resentment has a  way of becoming the very damage it sets out to control. Of course, Dickensian comedy manages to put the cat back in  the bag. Who is surprised, at the end of the novel, to fi nd Uriah  Heep still doing his humble-hypocritical routine, only this time  in prison? Or is it any wonder that, at the end, Rosa is still, and  forever, performing her dysfunctional mother-daughter act with  Mrs. Steerforth?: “Thus I leave them; thus I always fi nd them; thus  they wear their time away, from year to year” (804). Dickensian  comedy has little trouble perpetuating a regime of living death:  </page> <page sequence="19"> Litvak: Resentment in David Copperfi eld 145 whenever repetition seems on the verge of differing from itself, of  edging toward, say, a comedy of playful persistence, as it does oc- casionally in Rosa Dartle’s insinuating questions, it catches itself  just in time and reinstates the comedy of “hopeless compulsion”  and hysterical misery—the comedy, that is, of resentment.31 If, as  everyone knows, the laughter Dickens elicits is often mixed with  tears, his comedy is never more heartbreaking than when it blocks  the formation of an alternative comedy: call it a pariah comedy, to  go with pariah erotics, and think of it in terms of “not only the for- bidden question but the suppressed imitation, the forbidden weep- ing or the forbidden reckless game.” I have just been quoting from  Horkheimer and Adorno’s fable of the snail, to which I return: The higher animals have themselves to thank for their great- er freedom; their existence is evidence that feelers were once  stretched out in new directions and not repulsed. . . . Like the  genera within the species of fauna, the intellectual gradations  within the human species, indeed, the blind spots within the  same individual, mark the points where hope has come to a halt  and in their ossifi cation bear witness to what holds all living  things in thrall. (DE, 213–14) Falling asleep while reading David Copperfi eld may be a way of  coping with the ossifi cation of comic and erotic possibility; it may  be a way of retracting one’s own feeler. But then, falling asleep  in David Copperfi eld is a way to dream of Uriah Heep and Rosa  Dartle: to dream of melting into them. Some readers of the novel— gurglings taking place in their throats, stoppages in their noses,  their legs extending to I don’t know where, their mouths gaping  in goofy grins—might also dream of gliding into forbidden places  with these gooey gargoyles, and, unlike the novel’s author-hero,  they might wake from such dreams without rushing to resume  their ossifi ed subjectivity by washing off the oil that oozes from  their bodies as they sleep. Instead of running back into the arms of  “what holds all living things in thrall,” they might linger in unctu- ous uncertainty as to whether or not the dream is over. Imitating  Rosa Dartle, they might ask, “Is it really, though?” Or: What does  a suppressed imitation do when you no longer suppress it? What  </page> <page sequence="20"> 146 qui parle   spring/summer 2012   vol.20, no.2   does a forbidden reckless game do when you no longer forbid it?  Does the unsuppressed imitation or the unforbidden game let you  feel something other than resentment, without either resentfully  smashing it or resentfully mastering it? It may not. And yet, as  mayonnaise would say if it could talk, it may.32 Notes 1.  Charles Dickens, David Copperfi eld, ed. Jeremy Tambling (London:  Penguin, 1996), 789.

The contagion that is Uriah is neatly evoked in a phrase quoted by  Fred Kaplan, in Dickens: A Biography (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins  </page> <page sequence="21"> Litvak: Resentment in David Copperfi eld 147 University Press, 1998), 249. As Dickens fi nished David Copperfi eld,  he complained, Kaplan notes, that he was “exhausted by ‘heaps of  Copperfi eldian blots.’” 9.  In “‘The Reader Whom I Love’: Narrative Secrets in David Cop- perfi eld,” ELH 64 (1997): 212 (hereafter cited as “RW”), Oliver S.  Buckton remarks that “the fi rst three letters [of Uriah’s name] are  homonymic with ‘You are I.’” I will try not to resent Buckton for  beating me to the punch. 10.  The most devastating analysis of the “charm” allegedly exercised by  Dickens’s comic characters, particularly in David Copperfi eld, is to be  found in D. A. Miller, “Secret Subjects, Open Secrets,” in The Novel  and the Police (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), esp.  207–11 (hereafter cited as “SS”). OM, 125–76, offers a rich account  of what Woloch calls “minorness” and a detailed discussion of how  repetition differentiates the minor characters from the protagonist in  David Copperfi eld. On passive aggression in David Copperfi eld see  Alexander Welsh, From Copyright to Copperfi eld (Cambridge: Har- vard University Press, 1987), 147–55. My thoughts about the pecu- liar hell constituted by Dickens’s minor characters are inspired by an  astringent comment in Hilary M. Schor, Dickens and the Daughter  of the House (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 216n:  “The last chapter of any Dickens novel has a . . . feeling of enmire- ment, as all the characters we thought we had left behind rise perkily  up, becoming wholly and annoyingly themselves again, in one last  display of that repetitive quirkiness that novels call ‘character,’ and  Freudians call neurosis.” 11.  I owe “sing-singing for his supper” to the anonymous copywriters at  the Bonny Doon Vineyards, who used this phrase on the label on their  2002 “Big House Red.” 12.  See Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s remark in “Willa Cather and Others,”  Tendencies (Durham: Duke University Press, 1993), 175: “Anyone  who knows how to read anything is experienced in reading, for in- stance, the story of a husband; we have all read that one all our lives,  however resentfully or maybe all the better because resentfully.” 13.  In Dickens and the Trials of Imagination (Cambridge: Harvard Uni- versity Press, 1974), 142–43, Garrett Stewart points out that W. C.  Fields played both Micawber in the fi lm version of David Copperfi eld  and Humpty Dumpty in the fi lm Alice in Wonderland. 14.  This phrase appears in Martin Chuzzlewit, chapter 31, after the  Humpty Dumpty–ish fall of Pecksniff. </page> <page sequence="22"> 148 qui parle   spring/summer 2012   vol.20, no.2   15.

Titolo is interested in Uriah Heep’s failure as opposed to David’s suc- cess; I am interested in the similarity between the two. For a discus- sion of Uriah as David’s unacknowledged semblable and thus “as the  novel’s conscience” (120), see Mary Poovey, “The Man-of-Letters  Hero: David Copperfi eld and the Professional Writer,” in Uneven  Developments: The Ideological Work of Gender in Mid-Victorian  England (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988), 116–23.

Consider, in this light, another of David’s adolescent “terrors”: “The  shade of the young butcher rises, like the apparition of an armed head  in Macbeth. Who is this young butcher? He is the terror of the youth  of Canterbury. There is a vague belief abroad, that the beef suet with  which he anoints his hair gives him unnatural strength, and that he  is a match for a man” (253). Relating his “fi ght” with this bully of a  butcher boy, David writes: “I hardly know which is myself and which  the butcher, we are always in such a tangle and tussle, knocking about  upon the trodden grass” (253). Sure enough, on the next page he re- ports: “I use a great deal of bear’s grease” (254)—presumably, in his  hair. 20.

O’Farrell observes that “Uriah terrorizes David with his as- severation of excess and overfl ow in the system of their connection”  (96–97). I want to explore the erotics of this terror, an erotics in- cluding the desire for one’s own emulsifi cation, as a way out of the  resentment-machine. 24.

Along with  the rest of Dialectic of Enlightenment, and along with other texts by  Adorno, this fragment, titled “In the Genesis of Stupidity,” lies be- hind much of the present essay. 28.

Drawing on the work of Judith Butler, Buckton (in “RW”) discusses  David’s melancholic relation to Steerforth. Buckton interprets David’s  melancholia primarily in sexual terms; my formulation, “parvenu  melancholia,” points to the entanglement of sex and class. 31.

Michael Moon has pointed out to me that one can hear in “mayon- naise” not just “may” but also “nay.” To be sure, there is no guaran- tee that pariah comedy and pariah erotics will not impose interdic- tions of their own. But even “nay” has some “may” in it: in addition  to being an archaic “no,” “nay” can have the emphatic force of “in- deed,” or, even better, the effusiveness of “not only that but also this.”   While I am overfl owing, let me thank, along with Michael Moon,  these other interlocutors who have enriched the present essay: Caro- lyn Williams, Mary Ann O’Farrell, D. A. Miller, Catherine Gallagher,  Ashley Shelden, and, as always, Lee Edelman. </page> </plain_text>
