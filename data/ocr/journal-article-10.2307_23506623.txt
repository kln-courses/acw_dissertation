<plain_text><page sequence="1">FORMSTECHER'S HISTORY OF JUDAISM BERNARD J. BAMBERGER, New York City BASIC CONCEPTS A MONG the creators of German Reform Judaism, Solomon Formstecher occupies a distinctive place. Outwardly, his long career was uneventful; perhaps that is why his literary accomplishments could be so extensive and varied. His published writings include sermons, educational texts, scholarly essays, even a novel.1 But he is best known for the volume entitled Die Die Religion des Geistes (Frankfurt a. M., 1841), in which at the age of thirty-three F.2 presented a comprehensive Jewish philosophy. The present article deals chiefly with the two long chapters on the history of Judaism. Previous studies of F. have centered about his philosophic system (which, by the way, he presents in highly condensed form) 3; his historical chapters have even been dismissed as an artificial construction, in which neither events nor their social background are adequately treated. 4 How much validity there is in this criticism we shall consider later on. We note now that F. was the first modern to attempt a history of the Jewish religion. Such a pioneer effort, whatever its deficiencies, would be worth examining. In fact, it offers much of interest. 1 1 JE Y 436; D. Philipson, The Reform Movement in Judaism, pas simsim (see index) ; C.

BAMBERGER [2] F. is known as the philosopher of Reform Judaism. He operates constantly with the idea of development in religion, and with the distinction between permanent ethical values and transient ceremonial and nationalistic elements. Yet the word Reform does not appear in the book, nor does the author present himself as the spokesman of a sectarian viewpoint. He expounds the totality of Judaism, recognizing the necessity of all its manifestations in the past, and indicating that the destiny of Judaism lies in the direction of what we call Reform. In an interesting passage, . F. gives a brief summary and critique of the philosophies current in his day. He takes the Idealists sharply to task for attempting to comprehend the Absolute : the effort to grasp the inner essence of God, whether by rationalistic or mystical means, is the way of paganism. F. voices the hope for a new Kant, who will substitute ethics for metaphysics — but in a positive rather than a negative way.5 Nevertheless the whole book bears the stamp of post-Kantian idealism. Previous investigators have indicated that F. drew upon Schelling for many of his philosophic-theological con cepts. The historical sections too are based on idealistic presup positions. Without adopting the set patterns of Hegel, F. assumes that the data of history reveal a logical pattern. The history of Judaism narrates the evolution of an idea. Since F.'s history is so intimately tied up with his system atic views, we must reproduce as much of the latter as we need for our purpose. Reality, F. declares, is presented to us in two aspects, Natur and Geist. Nature includes those phenomena that are subject to fixed, mechanical law. But there is also an area of freedom. When a man transcends the mechanistic principle of self-preservation, and sacrifices his comfort or even his life for the sake of another, he has risen from the world of nature to that of Geist (it is not entirely satisfactory to translate 5 Beligion des Geistes 358. (Hereafter, page references without other indication refer to this work).</page><page sequence="3">[3] FORMSTECHER'S HISTORY OF JUDAISM 3 «spirit»). Physically, of course, man belongs to nature; hence he is subject to the stress of conflict between the two aspects of his being. His highest achievement is a unity in which the natural is disciplined, but not destroyed, by the spiritual. In the human spirit the whole organism of the natural world comes to consciousness; but this same spirit is also the consciousness and freedom of the individual. Geist therefore has a double activity : the unfoldment of universal life and of individual life. The first concerns nature and man as part of nature : its content we call natural science and its ideal is aesthetic. The second concerns man alone as bearer of Geist — its intellectual discipline is logic and its ideal is ethical. The source of aesthetic standards is ready to hand in the visible manifestations of nature. The intellect (Vernunft) can operate on this material to determine what is beautiful and what is not. But the intellect is not creative : it can only compare and pass judgment on data. Whence, then, do we derive the basic material of ethics! From what is called revelation, which in anthropomorphic terms is knowledge given to man by God. Put more philosophically, revelation is the apprehension by Geist Geist of the objectively good. F. uses the odd term vorhistoçische Offeribarung to designate super-temporal absolute truth, of which all historical revelation is but a relative and imperfect approximation. Yet he holds that Geist,Geist, when it pursues the ideal of individual life, can come ever closer to the absolutely true. Religion is the word we apply to a group phenomenon — the recognition of a shared ideal and the effort, to achieve it. Ultimately, such ideals are reducible to two — the ideal of universal life, of spirit mediated through nature ; and the ideal of individual life, of autonomous spirit. Correspondingly there are but two basic religions — paganism, the cult of nature, and Judaism, the cult of spirit.0 Pp. 17-72.</page><page sequence="4">4 BERNARD •T. BAMBERGER [4] These matters, together with other philosophic-theological topics on which we need not linger here, are presented in the first eight chapters of the book, which, together with the introduction, occupy only 71 pages. The next two chapters, containing some 120 pages, are a much fuller exposition of the characteristic features of Judaism. F. proceeds by constantly comparing Judaism and paganism. The two systems are alike in many ways. Each advances toward the attainment of its own ideal; each has its revelation, prophets, and scriptures, its sacrifices and ceremonies. F. makes the penetrating remark that the occasional resemblance between a pagan and a Jewish rite is not necessarily proof of borrowing or imitation. Children at various stages of development display strikingly similar behavior patterns without necessarily having learned them one from another. The same is true in the development of religions.7 Essentially the two systems are diametric opposites. Pagan ism, knowing God only through nature, cannot distinguish God from nature. Hence the innumerable versions of paganism, each attached to a particular geographic area, apart from which it cannot survive. When Rome assembled the various local deities into a universal pantheon, she was but presiding over the liquidation of paganism. 8 Judaism, the religion of the spirit, had a temporary connection with Palestine, but is able to survive in any land or climate. Because paganism found its clearest expression in art, Judaism had to oppose the plastic arts vehemently until paganism had passed its flowering and sunk into decay. 9 The original source of religion is revelation, which comes to consciousness in prophecy. The prophet is one whose ethical and religious insights are far in advance of the outlook of his ז P. 161. 8 Pp. 67, 301-2. » Pp. 68 ff.</page><page sequence="5">[5] FORMSTECHER'S HISTORY OF JUDAISM contemporaries. These insights are intuitive and emotional : hence the prophet feels himself the bearer of a divine truth received from outside himself. As reflective thought develops within within a culture, the religious teacher begins to recognize his new insights as the achievement of his own spirit. But then he ceases to be a prophet; and this change is felt at first as a loss. The former prophecies are now enshrined as sacred writings; these writings are preserved from a sterile rigidity by the creative influence of tradition and interpretation.10 Pagan prophecy was the intensification of the life of nature (hence the reliance on natural omens and the like), Jewish prophecy was a heightening of the life of the spirit.11 We cannot fix the beginning of prophecy (Scripture and tradition declare that Adam knew God's will, that Abraham was a prophet and possessed the entire Torah), but we know that it declined after the Babylonian exile, and gave way completely to Scripture and tradition.12 In Judaism the priest, the conservator of older viewpoints, is clearly distinguished from the prophet and his successor the scholar, w7ho are the agents of freedom and progress. In paganism, the priestly and pro phetic offices are combined in the same person, so that no real advance is possible.13 We turn now to the contrasting content of paganism and Judaism. Identifying God with nature, paganism in its more sophisticated period discovers that nature is not God and produces atheistic philosophies. Judaism, which does not attempt to grasp God in His inner essence, finds rational proofs for the existence of a God already perceived and worshipped.14 10 Pp. 73-6. 11 Pp. 93-4. 12 P. 88. 13 Pp. 96-9. 14 P. 102.</page><page sequence="6">6 BERNARD J. BAMBERGER [6] The main line of development in paganism, of course, is not purely negative ; it leads rather to pantheism, and the doctrine that the visible universe emanated from the central deity. In the process of emanation, the principle of evil —the essence of which is detachment and distance from the godhead — acquires cosmic importance.15 Other pagan thinkers viewed creation in terms of a sexual engendering.16 Judaism, however, explains neither the origin of God nor the process of cosmogony. God is independent of the world, which He created by simple fiat. Paganism, rooted in a nature subject to mechanical law, tells of a blind fate to which gods and men alike are enslaved; Judaism proclaims a free and intelligent Providence.17 Thé creation of man, in paganism, was a kind of fall : a portion of divinity sundered itself from the godhead. Hence man's destiny is to re-integrate himself into God, or (as in Persia) to fight on the side of the good god against the power of darkness.18 Judaism declares that man was created by the beneficent divine will; it knows neither of a fall and original sin, nor of incarnation and apotheosis. Whereas paganism teaches that man can become god (through Orphic or similar mysteries), Judaism exhorts man to become like God by cultivating the moral qualities.10 Paganism fluctuates between sensuality and asceticism.20 Judaism avoids both extremes, disciplining the physical by means of the spiritual.21 It does not regard the soul as imprisoned in matter, nor does it attempt to follow the adventures of the soul through reincarnation and metempsy 15 Pp. 106 ff. 16 Pp. 111-2. 17 Pp.

In paganism sacri fice is indispensable : it is a means of uniting the worshipper more more. completely with his god. 24 In Judaism sacrifice has no metaphysical implications : its value is ethical and relative. Both in Scripture and in later literature, sacrifice is treated as a concession to the psychological needs of the people, and as acceptable only when offered with integrity of character, 25 Many of the other ceremonial laws, F. holds, were originally hygienic in intent, or had a symbolic meaning, or served as a defense against idolatry. 26 Heathen ethical doctrine, at its noblest, is crippled by the belief in the absolute validity of evil (for Ahriman also is a god), by its determinism, and by the failure to achieve complete universalism. 27 The future hope in paganism is also deterministic — as in the Avestan scheme of world history and in the Avatars of Hindu mythology. Paganism looks forward to the return of the gods to earth, and to a physical as well as a moral regeneration of the world.28 The future hope of Judaism (if we distinguish its essence from poetic imagery, and from certain concessions to the spirit of ancient times) is the hope of mankind healed in spirit and perfected in righteous ness and this goal is to be attained in freedom. 29 The foregoing contrasts may seem much too sharp for the informed reader. Jewish lore often speaks of cosmogony and 22 Pp. 150 ff. P. 152 11. mentions a special article by F. on this subject. 23 P. 151. 24 Pp. 163 ff. 25 Pp. 165 ff. 26 Pp. 167-71. 227 ד p. 174. 28 Pp. 179 ff. 29 Pp. 185 ff., cf. below nn. 46-7,</page><page sequence="8">g BERNARD J. BAMBERGER |"g] emanation, angels and demons, resurrection, and other concepts which F. has labeled pagan. The fact is that in the course of its development Judaism had to adopt and modify many pagan ideas. The amalgamation of pagan and Jewish elements is the doctrine called Cabala, a subject to which F. devotes much attention. He gives many instances of such syncretism in the chapters we have just summarized; but for the sake of brevity we shall postpone this subject till the chronological presentation. We must note just one more of F.'s basic concepts. The ancient world approached spiritual values by way of emotion. Hence men felt themselves to be the passive objects of divine guidance. In the modern age, Geist has become self-conscious and self-confident. It makes its discoveries by rational thought, and hence perceives itself to be the active subject. (Of course, the free activity of Geist is the gift of God.) Hence F. denominates the early part of man's history as the period of objectivity; the modern period is that of subjectivity. Between these two epochs there was a long and tragic transition, which began with the break-up of the ancient empires and has ended only with the nineteenth century. Thus the history of Judaism begins in the objective period, which is the period of prophecy. This is followed by the period of tradition, which falls into two main divisions. The first is marked by the predominance of objectivity, modified by subjective stirrings. F. therefore calls it the period of subjective objectivity. 111 the ensuing era, the subjective tendency is stronger, but still restrained by the survival of objective elements — it is therefore denominated the period of objective subjectivity. All this ponderous lingo means simply that the history of the spirit is marked by an increasing rationality and independence, in politics as well as in religion. Absolutism in government and in faith is gradually replaced by what we now call democracy, though the word was not yet common in F.'s day. That is why the period of transition is so long and bloody.30 Pp. 198-9.</page><page sequence="9">[!)] FORMSTEUHER'S HISTORY OF JUDAISM 9 The history of Judaism is the record of the spirit in its striving to recognize and attain the ideal of individual life. It is more than the inner history of a national ethnic group. Judaism is bigger than the Jewish people. When Anaxagoras and Socrates, and later Plato, arrived at a concept of spirit or deity independent of nature, they passed from paganism to Judaism.31 F. recognizes that the term Judaism is not entirely satisfactory, even to designate the development that leads from Abraham to the contemporary synagogue; but the distinctions sometimes made by Christian scholars between Hebraism and Judaism, and the like, are altogether unsound. 32. F. states his intentions as a historian — to trace the development whereby Geist strives to realize its ideal. All side issues, of purely archeological interest, all biography, military history, analysis of texts, are to be omitted.33 This may be taken to mean : only such data will be considered as fit into F.'s preconceived and artificial scheme ! F. certainly took much for granted in assuming that the materials for a history were ready to hand, and that he needed only to disengage the essentials from the incidentals. But all history has to be constructed on the basis of the available data. The historian strives for accu racy; he tries not to distort facts, and he does not wilfully omit those that would contradict his theories or mar the symmetry of his patterns. Yet he must choose the « significant » data from the welter of available detail and find a connection between these data. The judgment as to what is significant, and the choice of the connective framework depend chiefly on the Welt anschauunganschauunganschauung of the historian, not on criteria contained within the historical material itself. We shall readily discern the limitations of F.'s method. Yet we may ask : Is it so unreason able to study the history of Judaism in terms of the evolution of an idea? Such a procedure is no more one-sided than the 31 Pp. 66, 280-1. 32 Vorwort pp. vii-viii. 33 Pp. 196-7.</page><page sequence="10">10K) BERNARD .!. BAMBERGER [10j contemporary effort to explain proplietic-pharxsaic religion in terms of Marxian class struggle !34 The idealistic approach has one feature which is both an advantage and a drawback. Viewing all history as a rational process, the idealist is able to do some measure of justice to phenomena with which he is not personally in sympathy. Himself committed to the universalistic ethical emphasis, P. does not wax scornful or angry about nationalism, ceremonialism, and Cabala — as did some of his contemporaries. Eather does he see these phenomena as necessary and beneficial at a certain stage in the development of Judaism. T'he reverse side of this attitude is a kind of idealistic determinism : whatever happened had had to happen and must be justified : and this sometimes leads to grotesque results. Incidentally, the treatment of free will and providence is one of the weaker parts of F.'s philosophic section35 ... And now we are ready to examine the history proper, which occupies the better part of 200 pages. THE PROPHETIC PERIOD P. does not baldly deny the historicity of Genesis; but surely this is implied. The patriarchal narratives are described as a symbolic introduction (Vorbild) ; the patriarchs are ideal embodiments of the religion of the spirit.30 The sons of Jacob stand stand on the boundary between ideal and reality37 — history actually actually begins with Israel in Egypt. Moses, the pupil of the Egyptian priests, was initiated by them into the pantheistic monism which was the mysterion of paganism. Prom this physical monotheism he ascended to the level of ethical monotheism. Straightway he began his struggle to free the enslaved people — a struggle not only to bend 34 L.

By indomitable persistence Moses accomplished the liberation. The miracles in the Exodus story go unmentioned.38 Nor is there a word about what happened at Sinai. It is suggested that the entire legislation which bears the name of Moses was the product of his prophetic insight. The ideal which Moses envisioned, of the autonomous spirit flowering in individual life, could be approached only through a « collective individuality, » a united people. At the very outset, the uni versai mission of Israel was proclaimed : to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (Ex. 19.6). But this theme is not mentioned again until much later. Before the ideal could be brought to mankind, it had to be incorporated in a durable polity, able to resist the pressure of the completely pagan environment.39 We call this polity a theocracy, which is to be sharply distinguished from the pagan hierarchical state, with its fixed castes and orders. Unlike the latter, the theocracy is not based on duress, either physical or psychic, but on a covenant of friendship. Its characteristic feature is the presence of the prophet, who holds his position neither by birth nor election, but by the consciousness of divine choice. Hence he is not completely subject to any earthly authority. The danger of priestly or monarchical despotism was checked by the existence of the prophets, and also by the council of elders which (under various names and in different forms) maintained its influence through the entire period of Israel's nationhood.40 The Mosaic legislation does not distinguish between ethical and spiritual ends on the one hand, and the ceremonial forms which are only means to these ends. At the start ritual had to be invested with highest sanctity, especially since it provided a bulwark against the encroachment of paganism. This same 38 Pp. 208-10. 39 Pp. 211-4. 40 Pp. 216 ff., cf. 140-1.</page><page sequence="12">12 12 BERNARD J. BAMBERGER [12] need accounts for the separatists and exclusive elements in the Torah. Yet the universal aim is never completely obscured; Moses insists that God is the Father of all men and repeatedly enjoins love and kindness toward strangers. 41 The theocracy was based on free choice, not compulsion; hence it had to be established and maintained by the efforts of the people themselves. After a period of confusion, the theocracy took solid form through the leadership of Samuel. The creation of a monarchy could not be avoided; the people sinned sinned — as the Rabbis pointed out — not so much in asking for a king as in wanting to be like other peoples.42 Had the king been chosen merely by popular election, he or his descendants might have claimed absolute power. Therefore he had to be chosen by God's representative, the prophet, and accepted by the people, to emphasize his subjection to God and his brotherhood with the people. Saul failed because an increasing lust for power brought him into rebellion against God. David, however, was an ideal king, faithfully following the guidance of the prophets. (His faults and failings were in personal, but not in public conduct.) The firm establishment of the state by David and the building of the Temple by Solomon completed the body of the theocracy. 43 Israel was now ready to embark on its universal mission. But Solomon's greed and sensuality caused a reversion toward paganism. The division of the kingdom was a dialectic necessity. There was danger lest the Davidic dynasty constitute an absolute despotism, and lest the Solomonic Temple imprison the universal God in a local shrine. The northern kingdom and its temples were a challenge to such excessive claims. But Judah was the « positive pole » in this process ; the northern kingdom 41 Pp. 79, 215.

It was always susceptible to pagan influences. And once the prophetic movement liberated Judah from a narrow particular ism, the Kingdom of Israel was superfluous and had to disappear from history ! 44 This is theorizing with a vengeance. To dispose so cavalierly of a populous and culturally advanced state seems to us almost frivolous. But we have now finished with the Aveakest part of P.'s historical revieAV. The great prophets must he understood against the back ground of JeAvish and of world history. They appeared at the end of the JeAvish national period, when Judaism was suffi eiently strong and mature to expand beyond the limits of a small theocratic state and to embark on its Avorld-historic mission. At this very time the ancient world of objectivity began to break doAvn. The transition from a life dominated by emotion and ruled despotically, to a life of rational freedom, began with the rise and fall of the empires of the Middle East, to be folloAved by bloody struggles betAveen Asia and Europe, the liquidation of paganism by cosmopolitan Rome, the folk migrations, the eastward thrust of the Crusades and the Avest Avard thrust of the Turks, and the wars of religion in Europe. This process, which began in the days of the prophets, Avas viewed by them as a world judgment, to be followed by the messianic era of righteousness and brotherhood. Sentence must be passed on the evils of absolutism and the moral and spiritual limitations of paganism before the religion of the spirit can fully triumph. 45 F. therefore gives little attention to the role of the prophets as champions of social justice in their own time. Their essential mission was to proclaim the universal spiritual goal, and to warn of the world judgment that must precede the attainment of the goal. But they were men Avith human limitations. Despite 4444 Pp. 230-2. 43 Pp. 233-6, 241-3.</page><page sequence="14">14 BERNARD J. BAMBERGER [14] the magnificence of their vision, they failed to distinguish between ultimate and proximate aims and painted, as it were, without perspective. 40 Moreover, they sought to inspire and comfort their contemporaries; and for those whose national life was in tragic collapse, the pure vision of a remote messianic period was not sufficient solace. The prophetic messages there fore contain a mixture of absolute and relative truth, of words instinct with eternal verity and of messages adapted only to temporary needs. The transitory elements are the promises of national restoration, glory, and wealth for Israel reconstituted in Palestine. The eternally valid core of the prophetic message is the vision of universal brotherhood, righteousness, and peace under God's fatherly dominion. 47 The downfall of the Jewish state is viewed as the irresist ible bursting of a seed-pod. P. repeatedly applies to Israel the New Testament phrase, «My kingdom is not of this world.»48 Israel's destiny is to go forth to mankind as the messenger of divine truth. Yet — as we shall see — it is not to perform the active missionary work. Its function is to win mankind by unconquerable loyalty to the religion of the spirit and by exemplifying the ethical ideal in practice. 49 The people, however, sensed this high destiny but dimly, while the agony of national downfall was keenly and vividly experienced. Hence they continued to dream and to labor for the restoration of a Jewish state. 50 THE SECOND COMMONWEALTH The period of « subjective objectivity »51 falls into two parts. The first, from the return of the Babylonian exiles to 46 P. 237. 4747 Pp. 242-52. 48 P 242, 254. 49 P. 254. so p. 255. 51 Above, n. 30.</page><page sequence="15">[15] FORMSTECHER'S HISTORY OF JUDAISM !5 the destruction of the Second Temple, is marked by a conscious striving for national rebirth. These efforts were unsuccessful; F. holds that they had to ־be unsuccessful, since Judaism had already progressed beyond the need of national forms. The Maccabean revolt was more religious than political; the state established by the Hasmonean rulers was short-lived. But Judaism still required, if not a political framework, at least a base of operations, a spiritual center. This was supplied by land and Temple. 52 The history of Judaism in this, and in each of the ensuing periods, may best be understood under three headings. First, the conflict between the ancient and the modern, the objective and the subjective — a conflict that moves gradually toward resolution. Second, the conflict between Judaism and paganism, and their ultimate reconciliation. Third, the form and expres sion of the messianic hope, which is affected by both the previous factors. The objective spirit was predominant during the Second Commonwealth. The sacrificial cult was deemed essential. Prophetic writings were still produced ; some were incorporated into the Bible, others may be found in the Apocrypha. More over, people believed that miracles continued to occur, and that the heavenly voice (Bat Kol) sometimes vouchsafed heavenly revelations.53 But there were also unmistakable stirrings of subjectivity. The instrument of the new trend was Midrash — the free method of searching the Scripture. Men who would not have dared advance new concepts on their own authority failed to realize the originality of their ideas because they supposed they were only expounding the Biblical word. The increasing stress on the duty of studying the Torah stimulated independent reasoning.54 52 Pp. 272-5. 53 p. 276. 54 p. 261-2, 277.</page><page sequence="16">16 BERNARD •T. BAMBERGER [16] The new cult of prayer is another significant development. Formerly worship as a duty had been sacrificial. Prayer had been a spontaneous expression of the individual heart. Now the subjective trend creates the concept of prayer as a fixed religious obligation, with set times and gradually elaborated liturgies.r&gt;s The struggle with paganism in pre-exilic times had been entirely of negative character — uncompromising opposition and rigid separatism were the weapons. Such procedures were also utilized after the return — witness the struggle of Ezra and NehemiahNehemiah against pagan infiltration, the resistance of the pietists against Hellenism, and Ben Sira's warning (3.21) against dabbling in the Greek Gnosis. 58. But simple negation was no longer enough. Paganism had reached its full efflorescence at a time when Judaism was incompletely developed. 57 Hence paganism was able to penetrate rather deeply into Jewish spiritual life. Its influence could not be confined to such externals as the adoption of foreign proper names or the use of Babylonian names for the months.58 Judaism had also to borrow many heathen concepts and to Judaize them, re-interpreting them in terms of the total Jewish outlook, or at least legitimizing them by attaching them to the Scriptures. This fusion of pagan and Jewish elements is the Cabala. It is one of F.'s notable achievements as a historian that he grasped the importance and value of the Cabala in the history of Judaism. Whereas his rationalistic contemporaries (and many of his successors) approached the Cabala with bitter prejudice and denounced it as a mixture of perversity and charlatanism, F. displayed far greater understanding and fairness. He did not like the Cabala ; he perhaps underestimated 55 P. 277. 56 p. 278. 57 Cf. pp. 315-6. 58 P. 278.</page><page sequence="17">[17] FORMSTECHER'S HISTORY OF JUDAISM 17 its usefulness in supplying a response to deeply felt emotional needs. But he did not dismiss it as an aberration, and his explanation explanation of the Cabala as a fusion of pagan and Jewish elements is fundamentally correct. He also saw clearly that certain elements in the Apocrypha, the Alexandrine Jewish mysteries, and the esoteric fragments in the Talmud are organically related to the later Cabala — a subject which has since been much illuminated by the publication of the Enoch Books and other pseudepigrapha. The facts adduced by P. are contained after a fashion in P. Beer's account of the Cabala,59 which P. utilized; and Beer in turn drew on earlier writers for his materials. But P. excelled his predecessors in grasping the Cabala as an organic whole, and in his ability to see its merits. In earlier chapters, he had already given many instances of this syncretism — cosmogonie speculations, angelology, visions of the heavenly assize, the doctrines of the pre-existence of the soul, resurrection, heaven and hell — found in apocalyptic and Rabbinic literature. These subjects now receive a more properly historical presentation. The Cabalistic trend is first suggested in some of the graphic visions of Ezekiel60 and appears more fully in Daniel, which P. seems to accept as an exilic writing. Here we find a developed angelology, a heavenly Messiah, and the belief in resurrection —- the latter doctrine being taken up by the author of II Maccabees and by the Rabbis. The Wisdom of Solomon reflects the Gnostic tendency against which Ben Sira had warned, ascribing creative power to the Divine Wisdom, and adopting the doctrine of original sin. 61 9ס Peter Beer, Geschichte, Lehren und Meinungen aller bestandenen unci unci noch bestehende SeTcten der Juden und der GeheimleTire oder Kdb balah,balah, 2 v., Briinn, 1822-3.

BAMBERGER [18] In Palestine and Babylonia, pagan borrowings were kept subordinate to Jewish values; in Alexandria, the pagan element was more powerful. Philo, though not the founder of Cabala, may be regarded as its first representative, since he offered a systematic presentation of pagan ideas in Jewish dress.82 The chief Jewish element in Philo is his attachment to the Bible, which he interpreted by a very free Midrashic method. The substance of his message is essentially pagan — the doctrine of the Logos, the view that matter is impure, the belief that the soul can rise to a contemplation of the divine mysteries. The Philonic Logos (called sometimes δεύτερος θεός), the Targumic Memra, the Gnostic Elxai, the Buach HakodeshHakodesh of the Rabbis, the Cabalistic Shekinah and Adam KadmonKadmon are all the same entity under different names — an emanation of the Deus absconddtus, the source of the visible world and the agency through which the soul may return to its source and penetrate the inner mysteries of divinity.63 F. contrasts Philo unfavorably with Josephus, despite Philo's personal nobility and Josephus' shady career. In this F. is true to his announced purpose, to deal with ideas, not with biographical details. For Josephus, a Palestinian, presented Judaism as the antithesis to paganism, and made no attempt to fuse them. He was indeed affected by the prevailing atmosphere; not only did he follow the Greek literary fashion by putting rhetorical speeches into the mouths of Biblical characters, but he adopted the pagan belief that matter is impure and that the body is the prison of the soul. For this reason he praised the asceticism of the Hindus. But these are only minor deviations from the essentially Jewish viewpoint of Josephus.64 62 p. 280.

F. cites a number of parallels between Josephus and the Rabbinic aggadah.</page><page sequence="19">[19] FORMSTECHER'S HISTORY OF JUDAISM 19 The future hope in this period is conditioned by the conflicts between objective and subjective tendencies, and between pagan and Jewish values. The first conflict is reflected in the oscillation between a nationalistic and a more transcendent view of the future — the tendency being to rely less on political or military triumph and more on direct miraculous divine intervention. Pagan influence is seen in the concept of the Messiah as a heavenly being, who is « like to a son of man, » but is actually more than human, and in many of the details of the future redemption.65 F. interestingly declares the Sybilline fragments to be free of pagan elements, even though they are ascribed to a heathen prophetess : the apparently mythological elements in these writings are derived Midrashically from the Hebrew Scriptures.60 The different viewpoints we have described are embodied in the sects of this period. The Pharisees represent the modern subjective movement; the Sadducees cling rigidly to the ancient objective position; the Essenes reflect the pagan Jewish syncretism. Their doctrines as reported by Josephus suggest Pythagorean influence; as adherents of the Alexandrian theosophy (which they brought to Palestine) they were highly regarded by Philo.67 In the process of spiritual development Sadducaism declined ;68 the Essenes were partly incorporated into the new Christian cult, partly reabsorbed by Pharisaism. F. properly remarks that the entire nation was not divided into these three sects, the membership of which may have been comparatively limited; but the Pharisees acquired the dominât ing influence in Jewish life.69 65 Pp. 288 ff. 66 P. 290. 67 Pp. 293-5. 68 On p. 295 bot. the decline of Sadducaism is ascribed to the victory of (subjective) Midrash over (objective) prophecy; p. 315 states that Sadducaism disappeared with the fall of the Temple. 69 p. 295.</page><page sequence="20">20 BERNARD J. BAMBERGER [20] The Samaritans remained outside the main body of Jewry because they never lost their originally pagan character, despite their adoption of many Jewish beliefs and practices, even those of later generations.70 In explaining the rejection of the Samaritans contemporary scholarship would look rather for social and ethnic than for ideological factors. Even less satisfactory is P.'s treatment of universalisai during the period of the Second Commonwealth It is at this time, he says, that Israel entered on the fulfillment of its mission. Yet he minimizes the importance of active missionary work by Jews, disregards the vigorous and success ful propaganda efforts of the first pre-Christian century, and declares erroneously that the conversion of the rulers of Adiabene was kept secret and had no public effect.71 THE TALMUDIC PERIOD With the destruction of the Second Temple, Judaism lost its visible center. The leaders therefore re-grouped the people around an invisible center — the Torah. In place of the effort at national separatism appeared a stress 011 religious separatism. Scattered more widely than ever in the pagan world, the Jews resisted the disintegrating effects of their environment by the wall of ritual and ceremony. Interestingly, F. does not use the word Torah, but the German term Gesetz, which has acquired a good many Pauline overtones. The feeling that the national catastrophe was a punishment for past sins led to extreme punctiliousness in study and observance of the law. But F. fully recognizes the positive values of so-called Gesetzliclikeit. From his preoccupation with the Torah, the Jew drew a continuing sense of God's reality 70 Pp. 297 ff. 71 P. 299.

Moreover, the emphasis on study provided steady exercise for the free intelligence.72 The objective emphasis was still dominant. That is why the literary monuments of this period are not the ordered works works of individual authors, but unsystematic conglomerates of received materials. Though note was taken of individual dissenting opinions, the dissenters refrained from acting on their own conviction. It was generally admitted that the former generations were wiser and better than their successors. Many customs which had no raison d'etre after the fall of the Temple were kept alive in some fashion out of blind devotion to the past.73 But subjective tendencies were plainly at work. The Rabbis established their right to issue Takkanot, validate customs, erect « fences » about the law, even to modify or abolish Biblical commandments. They enumerated seven laws which have no Scriptural foundation, yet are considered binding.74 They suggested that sacrifice was intended only as a temporary institution, which may be adequately replaced by studying about it, or better by practicing mercy. Hillel in effect abolished a Biblical law by instituting the Prosbol; Rabban Gamaliel modified the divorce code. By means of legal fictions, certain burdensome laws were made less burdensome. The Pharisaic-Rabbinic method was the only one by which the law could retain stability while acquiring a needed flexibility.75 In dealing with paganism, the Jewish leaders engaged both in conflict and compromise. We note the opposition to the study of « Greek wisdom » and to superstitious customs regarded as heathenish (darke HaEmori). There were numerous rules limiting contact with Gentiles, for ethical reasons and to 7272 p. 306. 73 Pp. 307-8, 311-2. 7474 p. 313. p. refers to studies 111 this field by Creizenaeh. 75 Pp. 314-5.</page><page sequence="22">22 BERNARD J. BAMBERGER [22] discourage intermarriage.76 But the culturally advanced pagan ism inevitably percolated into Jewish life; it was assimilated in the manner already described above. P. properly warns us against assuming that every item in the Aggadic literature that seems mythological must be of pagan origin. We must acquire an insight into the peculiarities of the Aggadic style. Even in the Biblical writings, we are often puzzled as to whether a passage is to be taken literally or regarded as a poetic metaphor. The Aggadah presents even greater difficulties, since it was the way of the preachers to interpret literally the poetic figures of Scripture, while assigning symbolic and allegorical meanings to Bible verses that were meant literally. Another common device was to use human figures to describe divine matters -— for example, the heavenly realm was pictured as a Talmudic academy. Hence originally pagan and Jewish elements in Babbinic literature are to be distinquished, not by their formal garb, but by their essential content.77 The chief borrowing from paganism was the belief that the human soul is competent to attain supernaturel Gnosis. The Rabbis admitted this alien mysticism hesitantly and with many restrictions. Speculations about the heavenly throne-chariot, cosmogony, angels, the pre-existence of the soul, anamnesis, predestination, and the like are of pagan derivation. The native Jewish elements are practical, ethical, and religious rather than speculative and metaphysical. F. has assembled references to much of this early Cabala, with occasional parallels from Greek and Latin literature.78 He points out also that many pagan beliefs influenced practical conduct, as in superstitious practices for controlling the weather, seeing and defeating 76 p 317. 77 Pp. 318-21. 78 See esp. pp. 321 ff.

The future hope expressed in Rabbinic literature is composed of contradictory elements. R. Hillel denies that there will be a Messiah; Samuel expects the Messianic age to be no more than a time of national independence. Elsewhere we meet pagan views — the concept of a predetermined and computable date for the deliverance, of a pre-existent Messiah, and of the physical regeneration of the earth and of mankind. One finds also expressions of narrow nationalism, a normal reaction to the hatred and oppression experienced by the Jewish people. Yet the universal prophetic outlook is still maintained in the hope for the moral and spiritual regeneration of mankind, the ultimate extinction of the evil impulse, and the conversion of the nations. Another outstanding instance is the affirmation that the pious Gentiles have a share in the bliss to come.80 THE MIDDLE AGES The period from the close of the Talmud to the appearance of Moses Mendelssohn is denominated the period of « objective subjectivity » —• and we shall note shortly the evidence of growing individualism and intellectual independence. The history of Judaism in this period is a continuation of the conflicts and developments encountered in the two previous periods; but the progress of the Jewish spirit was largely conditioned by the political status of the Jews in the various lands of the dispersion. Political independence was long since gone : the Chazar kingdom could only be an anomaly, without significance for the life of a Jewry whose « kingdom is not of this world. מ But where the Jews enjoyed freedom, as in 9ד Pp. 323-4. 80 Pp. 325-8,</page><page sequence="24">2424 BERNARD J. BAMBERGER [ 24] Spain during the Golden Age, they produced a more varied and enlightened literature than in Germany, where oppression drove them back to the four ells of the law.81 The completion of the Talmud released subjective tenden cies. The Saboraim and Geonim, no longer feeling that they were bearers of a revealed tradition, began to offer their own individual interpretations and responsa. Theological speculation became more rational and systematic. The pagan-Jewish syncretism was now confined to a separate area, bearing the specific name of Cabala,82 which for a long time was acceptable only because it was presented as the alleged doctrine of Biblical or Talmudie heroes. Cabala retained the objective outlook; Talmudic studies became more and more subjective.83 Rabbinic literature indeed acquired an increasing degree of system. Halakah and Aggadah, jumbled together in the older sources, were sharply separated by Alfasi. Maimuni undertook a complete re-arrangement of the legal material in his great code (a subjective procedure naturally attacked by the ancient minded R. Abraham b. David, who received revelations from Elijah). The standard codes, Turim and Shulhan Aruk, omitted obsolete sections of the law, and Isserles supplemented the legal material by the enumeration of popular customs. 111 the responsa literature, subjective forces are also at work, though often unconsciously. The authors of these legal opinions thought of themselves as the interpreters of an old tradition; in fact they were often expressing their own original ideas.84 A remarkable evidence of the growing subjectivity was the 81 Pp. 332-5. 82 Pp. 336-7.

But like Sadduceeism, it could provide only balance, not driving power; it was uncreative, and its literature is chiefly polemical.86 The ancient element is seen also in the ritual stringency of the medieval Jews, who nevertheless adopted the speech, dress, and customs of their environment, wrote on theology and science in Arabic, and utilized Arabic models for their Hebrew poems.87 Particularly instructive are the new meanings attached to Sabbath and festival observance. The positive spiritual note was more clearly struck. Sabbath was characterized not merely as a day for abstaining from labor, but as time for self consecration and study. Sukkot lost its local-national character and received new symbolic interpretations. And P. gives other instances. 88 Rationalism reached its clearest expression in the Aristo telian philosophy of Maimonides (the metaphysical aspect of which is pagan) 89 and the critical researches of Ibn Ezra. Despite the protest of conservatives like Solomon ben Adret, the rational outlook was dominant until mass persecution drove Jewry back to Talmudic legalism. The Geist was not yet ready for full freedom : it had still to pass through the preparatory stages of logical dialectic and psychological criticism. In the non-Jewish world these phrases are represented by scholasticism and critical philosophy respectively; their Jewish equivalents are pilpul and Biblical linguistics.90 s5 P. 339.

BAMBERGER [26] 111 the struggle with paganism, we note again both isolation ist and assimilatory tendencies. The conscious opposition to non-Jewish ideas and practices was stimulated by persecutions — so that later Rabbis extended the segregatory provisions of the Talmud. A sharp polemic literature also was produced in this period. 91 The assimilation of pagan elements likewise continued, but in in two forms now — the rational Aristotelian, and the mystical neo-Platonic. The Spanish rationalists contented themselves with reconciling Judaism and philosophy, ignoring the essentially pagan character of all speculation about ultimate realities. Their attempted synthesis was altogether theoretical, and their ideas had little effect on Jewish practice.92 The Cabalists influenced more deeply the Jewish way of life, not only by introducing magical and theurgic procedures, but by re interpreting and modifying many points of halakali. P. cites material from a wide range of Cabalistic sources both on these questions of practice, and on the theosophic doctrines of the Cabala. The topics here illustrated from medieval literature have already been enumerated in previous sections. F. displays a remarkable breadth of learning, and many of his observations are instructive to the present-day student. We may note, as examples of his method, the opinion that the myth of Azza and Azzael and that of Samael are of old Oriental origin, while the story of the imprisonment of the giants and the view that each man has his own guardian angel are derived from Greece. In this latter period the Cabala adopted the pagan doctrine of metempsychosis; and descriptions of heaven and hell were elaborated in fullest detail.93 Both philosophy and Cabala had their opponents. Ultimately the adherents of Cabala were driven out of the main body of Jewry. They survive today only as the schismatic sects known »1 P. 343. »2 p. 344. 93 Pp. 344-'</page><page sequence="27">[27J FORMSTECHER'S HISTORY OP JUDAISM 27 as Chasideans or Beshtiaus, and Sabbatians or Zoharites. The unfavorable judgment on the Chasidim, and their classification ־with the unsavory followers of Sabbatai are drawn from P. Beer's book on the sects. Beer based his account of Chasidism on material supplied by Joseph Perl, the arch-enemy of the mystics, author of the satirical Megalleh Temir in.94 Yet F. did not accept Beer's harsh judgments on the Cabala as a whole. I think he adopted this view of the Chasidim because, according according to F.'s own scheme, the fusion of pagan and Jewish elements — necessary in its time — is now a thing of the past. The age of subjectivity is at hand; Chasidism, rooted in Cabalistic objectivity, is therefore ex liypothesi obsolete. The future hope of medieval Jewry was affected by three factors. One was negative : the need to combat Christian claims. The positive factors were the influence of rationalism and of Cabala. Both philosophers and mystics held views on this topic that belong to the objective age : The philosophers conceived the messianic era in terms of national political rebirth, and explained all the glowing visions of the future as poetic meta phors. The Cabalists stressed the supernatural character of the Messiah — whom they endowed with metaphysical attibutes — asserted that he will come when the process of transmigration of souls is completed, and greatly expanded the graphic pictures of the glorious age that lies ahead. Yet the universal ethical vision of the prophets was never entirely obscured, and F. cites evidence for this contention both from rationalistic and mystical writers.95 We have come now to the dawn of the modern day, the period of subjectivity, ushered in both by political upheaval and by advance in the sciences. Judaism soon felt the new influences; at first the modern life within Judaism pulsated 94 P. 347. Beer acknowledged his indebtedness to Perl in the work cited above n. 59, v. 2, p. 205.

Mendelssohn and his associates made the first attempt to breach this obsolete exterior : their mild efforts had only limited results. The final end of the Middle Ages is marked by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars (the whole process is subsumed by F. under the phrase « « der letzte europdische Krieg»). Persecution is drawing to an end. The Jew can now enter the world as a self-respecting moral personality, and no longer needs a protecting but isolating wall of ceremonialism about him. But except in these general terms, F. does not set forth a program of Reform. 96. CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM F. recognizes but two basic religions — paganism and Judaism. Judaism is destined to win all mankind for the fulfillment of the ideal of individual life, and to arrive ultimately at a reconciliation with paganism by subjecting nature to the control of spirit. But the Jews are to be mis sionaries only by setting a noble example, in word and action, of fidelity to their ideal. The actual conversion of the pagan world is reserved for the two missionary agencies of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. There must be two such « Missionen » to meet the respective needs of the northern and southern worlds. The northern area has a great devotion to freedom, which reaches its culmination in free inquiry and scientific thought. The languid languid southern climate stimulates fantasy and poetry, but not liberty : it is the zone of despotism.07 To win the north, therefore, Judaism enters far into paganism. Classical Christianity is an amalgam of Judaism and paganism, with the pagan element predominant. Hence it appealed to the northern peoples. But since the northern spirit is free, it gradually works its way back from paganism 9« Pp. 351-3. 9ז Pp. 365-8.</page><page sequence="29">[29] FORMSTECHER'S HISTORY OF JUDAISM 29 to Judaism, steadily reducing the pagan proportion in the mix ture. (Is it pure fancy on my part to see in this notion a curious resemblance to the Sabbatian theory that the Messiah must enter the world of impurity to draw out the sparks of holiness dispersed among the evil forces?) F. presents the history of Christianity in much the same way (though more summarily) that he has set forth the history of Judaism — as the evolution of ideas. He makes no serious effort to recover the facts about the life and teaching of Jesus. 98 Now the content of Judaism can be considered apart from the question of the historicity of Abraham or Moses; but since the content of Christianity is so largely concerned with the personality of Jesus, F.'s method is less satisfactory when applied to Christianity. Satisfactory or not, the approach is as follows : Christianity combines pagan metaphysics with Jewish ethics. Its essence is to be found in such doctrines as the incarnation, trinity, and original sin. In the formative years of the church, it was indispensable that the pagan emphasis should be stronger, in order that the heathen world should be won. Hence sects like the Ebionites, Arians, and Pelagians, because of their spiritual kinship to Judaism, had (by a dialectical necessity) to give way before the Gentile Christians, Athanasians and Augus tinians.99 Popular Christian practice retained all sorts of heathen customs, which were given a slight Christian coloring. And the Church itself stressed such pagan survivals as veneration of relics, image worship, and monasticism.100 Gradually the pagan' world was converted; the Church acquired political power and finally attained sway over cultural, intellectual, and spiritual life. The movement back to pure 98 On p. 371 lie makes the interesting suggestion that Jesus actually sought the political deliverance of Israel; but he expresses no definite opinion on the point. 9999 Pp. 385-7. 100 Pp. 388-90.</page><page sequence="30">30 BERNARD •T. BAMBERGER [30] Judaism could begin. The chief step in this direction was the Reformation, which challenged the power of the hierarchy, and eliminated many pagan elements both in dogma and ritual. But Protestantism retains a considerable, though reduced, amount of pagan thought and practice.101 Not only in its cruder fundamentalist versions is this true, but also in advanced theological and philosophic systems, like those of Hegel and Schleiermacher.102 The process by which the pagan north is to be won for true Judaism is far from culmination. Mohammedanism, on the other hand, was designed for people content to dream out their lives under despotic rule. It was imposed by force, and demanded complete submission (Islam) : hence the admixture of pagan elements could be comparatively small — just enough to make the Jewish doc trine bearable. Pagan elements in Islam are its determinism, the materialistic conception of the future life, the incompletely humanized ethics, and the numerous superstitious beliefs and customs.103 But the absolutist spirit of the Koran, which prohibits even interpretation, closed the way to progress. Islam from the start contained much less of paganism than did Christianity, yet it lacks the freedom and the dynamic to reduce that element. Even the great age of Arabic culture was one of progress in secular things, which had little effect on religion; and after that cultural efflorescence had passed, the Moslem world declined into a state of torpor and intolerance. Only where they are in direct contact with Christian influences are the Mohammedans stimulated to liberty of thought. It seems that Christianity must exercise a catalytic effect before the Moslem world can purge itself of pagan survivals and attain to the pure and universal monotheism we call Judaism.104 For all his nineteenth century optimism, F. has no illusion 101 Pp. 381, 387, 392. 102 Pp. 358-9. 103 Pp. 404-5. 104 pp. 406-11.</page><page sequence="31">[31][31] FORMSTECHER'S HISTORY OF JUDAISM 3! that the Messianic denouement is near. 111 lands still pagan, and in Moslem areas (save for the marginal territories where Christian influences are strong) Judaism has no choice hut to continue its stubborn resistance, maintaining the ritual barriers that are both protective and isolating. Within Christendom, however, this ritualistic armor may be discarded to the extent that Jews are accorded equal rights and human decency, and that Christians progress concurrently from antique paganism to the subjective, rational, ethical, universal faith.105 The Jewish advance must be led by German •Jewry, both because as a group they are enlightened, and because they live in an environment which has reduced the emphasis on the pagan aspects of Christianity. P.'s utterances of patriotic faith in the fatherland are here accompanied by some extremely shrewd comments on the weaknesses of German character and the foibles of German society.106 F. is unable to prove that all mankind will be able to reach the full realization of the spiritual ideal. But he chooses to hope for this consummation ; and he adds that, even if it should prove impossible in practice, the validity of the ideal would be in no way impaired.107 The book closes on the note of exalted faith in universal brotherhood and peace. CRITIQUE This essay is intended chiefly to give the reader a summary of F.'s historical presentation; but we should add some estimate of the merits of his performance.

BAMBERGER [32־] begin to appear till 1857; nor was Krochmal's essay on the philosophy of Jewish history (with its curions resemblances and its more striking differences from F.'s approach) available in print till ten years after our volume had been published. F. had before him only Peter Beer's two volumes 011 the Jewish sects, in which limited scholarly resources are combined with superficial rationalism. Of the great monuments of jiidische WissenschaftWissenschaft he had only Zunz's first masterpiece, Die Gottes dienstlichendienstlichen Vortrage der Juden, and the earlier essays of Geiger. In his treatment of law and custom, he drew on the researches of M. Briiek (another neglected figure) and Creize nach. He quotes also a number of Christian authors, among whom Nitzsch seems to have influenced him somewhat — as was was also the case with Samuel Hirsch.108 One must therefore applaud the young theologian who, with such meager resources, produced for the first time a well articulated and inclusive sketch of the development of Judaism from its beginnings to his own time. This was perhaps possible only because he constructed so extensive and rigid an ideological framework on which to arrange his historical material. This framework is derived from a philosophy now antiquated; and we have seen instances where it led to a distortion of the facts. But despite his philosophic preconceptions, F. was able to recognize certain social and political factors that influenced the development of Jewish thought. He makes many pénétrât ing and instructive observations, especially on Talmudic and medieval Jewish literature, which are still worth pondering by the student, but which limitations of space have not permitted us to include in full. The year after F.'s book was published, young Samuel Hirsch published his bulkier Religionsphilosophie der Juden,109 the fame of which has perhaps eclipsed that of the Religion 108 P. 108 and cf. S. Hirsch, Religionsphilosophie der Juden (Leip zig 1842), Einleitung p. XXX. 109 See previous n.</page><page sequence="33">[33] FOBMSTECHER'S HISTORY OF JUDAISM 33 des des Geistes. Hirseh is 110 doubt a profounder and more original philosopher; his work is also more capricious, more diffuse, and less balanced in organization. Moreover, F. had already reached a state of intellectual equilibrium, while Hirsch's mind was still in ferment. In his book he defended Scripture against the Biblical critics, and argued for the possibility of miracles; a few years later he had abandoned orthodoxy for a Reform position much more radical than that of F. (It is all the more remarkable that while still maintaining his orthodoxy, Hirseh should have glorified Jesus as the perfect embodiment of the Jewish religious ideal.) 110 The two books have a certain family resemblance, due both to their relation to the Idealistic philosophy and to their common social background. Both make much of the contrast betAveen nature and spirit, regarding freedom as the essential quality of spiritual life. Both regard paganism as subordination to nature;* but whereas F. considers it a necessary stage in the development of the spirit, Hirseh holds that submission to nature is the very essence of sin. Both agree that Judaism is not to proselytize actively :111 F. holds that Christianity and Islam are the Missionen of Judaism; Hirseh that Judaism is intensive, Christianity extensive religiosity. (But he makes no mention of Islam.) The attitude of both,writers toward proselyting is essentially in contradiction with their belief that Judaism is the absolute religion. It must be explained in the light of the conditions of their time. On the one hand, the Jews, just emerging from the Ghetto and moving tOAvard emancipation, could not yet conceive of antagonizing the Gentile world by missionary effort; on the other, the extensive baptism of Jews for unworthy motives, so common in this period, must have disgusted them with the whole idea of formal conversions. Our age has seen a revival of interest in mysticism, and especially in Chasidim. To our Avay of thinking, F. does not 110 110 10ז E.g., op. cit., p. 653. m Cf. above nn. 48, 71, 96 and Hirsch, op. cit., pp. 530, 832 ff.</page><page sequence="34">34 BERNARD J. BAMBERGER [34] give -sufficient weight to the continuing importance of the emotional element in religion. In this respect he holds to the rationalistic outlook of the Enlightenment rather than to the romantic tendency of the school to which his master Schelling belonged. In view of the medievalism and chauvinism generated by German Romanticism, this fact is by no means to F.'s discredit. It should be added that when the book was written, Chasidism was still an obscurantist and reactionary force in east European Jewry; and that F.'s estimate of the Cabala is far more sympathetic than that of most of his contemporaries. Contemporary readers may be disturbed by the dogmatic and oft repeated rejection of all nationalistic elements as the outworn relics of a past that will never return, the almost gleeful insistence that the Jews are not to have a land of their own, and the overly cheerful acceptance of the suffering and misunderstanding which Israel must endure in its pilgrimage. But it must be borne in mind that this doctrine does not grow out of an unworthy and self-abasing assimilationism. Jewish nationalism is discarded in order that the Jews may fulfill a spiritual destiny, not in order to qualify them for political emancipation. Far from being timid or apologetic, F. proclaims with proud daring that the Jews are the custodians of the religion of the spirit. Surely it was not in the effort to improve « public relations » that he declared Christianity to be but a temporary manifestation, an instrument through which the world is to be won for the truth of Judaism ! Halevi and Maimonides had said the same thing long before, but in a different kind of world; F. wrote it down in the language of the majority, and in the hope that Christians as well as Jews would read it. An adequate history of Judaism is yet to be written. The rich accomplishments of Jewish scholarship in the last century have revealed the complexity of the task, and have indicated how much more study of detail is necessary before a broad synthesis can be attempted with assurance. Yet the pioneer</page><page sequence="35">[35] FORMSTECHER'S HISTORY OF JUDAISM 35 effort of Formstecher is of more than antiquarian interest. It may serve as a reminder to future scholars that they cannot improve on his essay by learning alone. They must share his sense of the magnificence and glory of Judaism.</page></plain_text>
