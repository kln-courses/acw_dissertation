<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DAILY LIFE OF AMUEBA PROTEUS By DAVID GIBBS, PH. D., in collaboration with Dr. O. P. Dellinger From the Biological Laboratory of Clark University The purpose of the investigation described in this paper was to determine the events in the daily life of Amarba proteus- its periods of rest and activity, its reactions to foods and other natural stimuli in its surroundings, how it lives and what it does. The investigation was made by watching continuously for six days and five nights several amcebas and keeping careful records of their activities. One amoeba was followed with special care, while several others under various conditions as to food were also observed continuously during this period, and daily for several weeks following. The amoebas were kept under as nearly natural conditions as possible, and there was every indication that their lives under the microscope were normal. The investigation was made in the Biological Labora- tory of Clark University during the winter of 1905-6, under the direction of Professor Hodge. The continuous observations were maintained in relays by Drs. Hodge, Dellinger and the writer. -Mu FIG I. The amcebas were kept in a special slide, consisting of a long cover-glass resting on two glass strips cut from an ordinary slide. A drop of water containing the amoeba, when inserted between the slide and the cover-glass, clung to both by capillary attraction and made a perfect cell, open to the air, admitting freely of the insertion of pipette, needle, or additional water or food. The cells, when not under observation, were placed in a covered glass jar to prevent evaporation. The amoebas in one cell in this way were kept under daily observation during a period of eight weeks. The question of the behavior of amoeba is not a new one.

College courses in biology, zoSlogy, and some important branches of these sciences find it conven- ient to start with the amoeba. The amoeba is basal in biologi- cal and physiological theory as a key to the functions and general activities of protoplasm. "Amoebic" and "amoeboid" are common terms in scientific literature. The amoeba fig- ures in discussions of immortality, heredity, and death. Further, because of the amoebe's apparently simple structure, attempts to produce life artificially have been largely in imita- tion of the amoeba, and it has been connected with "primordial slime" as probably the first animal to be developed. All these indicate how important, even fundamental, is the life history of this animal for the sciences concerned with the theory and de- velopment of life. Throughout the animal series in general the activities of search for food and the rhythm of work and rest are basal. Success in search determines the life of the individual and of the species to a very large extent. Search is illustrated in all degrees in the life series from the gradual explorations of the root tips of plants to the complex activities of man. The rhythm of work and rest is a necessity imposed by the nature of protoplasm. It is illustrated in all degrees of rest from mere cessation of activity to profound slumber and hibernation. This rhythm is closely connected with effort in search and the attainment of food. For the higher animals this rhythm is necessary for life, but it has been doubted whether it is neces- sary or is exhibited in the life of the protozoa. The answer to this question is very important in its physiological bearings. The investigation here briefly summarized showed very defi- nitely that amwba proteus does have periods of activity and of rest as reactions connected with search for, and attainment of food. These periods apparently have nothing to do with light or darkness, day or night. The amoeba moves actively feed- ing until well filled with food when it remains quiescent for a time. These general facts are shown by the curve opposite, which represents the measured activity of an amoeba during four days and nights, up to division, and the activity of the parts for two days and nights thereafter. The curve shows the amount of movement. During the ob- servations the movements of the amoeba were measured by the micrometer gauge. At the same time careful notes were taken of the activities of the amoeba. Quotations from these notes are placed below the curve and serve largely to explain it. Together they show fairly clearly that a period of activity and feeding was followed by a period of cessation of general move-</page><page sequence="5">234 GIBBS ment, and often of apparently complete rest, that the greatest activity was immediately following a period of rest, that the degree and length of rest were in proportion to the degree and length of activity, that the rhythm of activity and rest was most pronounced during the twenty-four hours before division, that during the twelve hours before division the amoeba was less active, and divided when at rest, that the parts immedi- ately after division were very active and maintained a high level of activity during the two days in which they were observed. The greater activity of the parts after division is also defi- nitely shown in the following cuts which represent the actual paths travelled by, first, the amoeba before division, and, second, by the parts after division.

The amount of activity is also related to the amount and the kind of food. The amoeba observed above was feeding mainly on unicellular algae and was disturbed only occasionally by cili- ates. When feeding on algae scattered in the field, the amceba was more active than when feeding in a field of abundant sup- ply. In either case it was necessary, however, for the amoeba to move about to get its food. On the other hand, amoebas, which were feeding on ciliates, when these were numerous, moved comparatively little and at long intervals of time, but when the ciliates were less numerous the amoebas were again more active. The following curves (Fig. 5) show the activities of two amcebas feeding on ciliates. They were observed continuously for sixty-six hours. In the first place it will be observed that the activity was greatest during the first part of this period and became less and less. This was apparently the result of an in- crease in the number of ciliates in the cells. The necessity for action became less and less. A comparison of this curve with the curve of activity above (Fig. 2), which is on the same scale, shows strikingly this relation of movement to the food. The same fact is also even more strongly illustrated by a compari- son of the paths of the amoebas in the two cases.</page><page sequence="7">236 GIBBS - I 1! 1 IO 1 On- govng l J 1.

It seems, however, that the rhythm is here well developed in this lowest form of animal life, Activity, feeding, rest; activity, feeding, rest, is the story of the above curve. Activity, or the performing of work, requires energy which the protoplasm must supply. The period of rest appears to be simply the re- sult of organic satisfaction, or a period of recuperation. It suggests the lowest form of sleep; for this tendency to rest, to sleep, as a food reaction is illustrated by the higher animals. In this respect this lowest form of life does not differ essentially from the higher forms. The reactions of the amoeba to, and its search for, food also brought out many important facts in its life history. In the absence of food the amoeba often moved by "lopes", that is, by lengthening and shortening its body as a whole with- out extra pseudopods, and moving rapidly forward. Amcebas feeding habitually on algae assumed a palmate form, moving forward with many pseudopods, similar to the form pictured in Plate I. An amoeba feeding on ciliates responds to a touch by a ciliate by sending out pseudopods at the point touched and following up the ciliate. The pseudopods are sent out on both sides of the ciliate until the latter is nearly enclosed and then rapidly connected, forming a chamber, in which the ciliate may finally be engulfed. The ciliate may, however, escape, leaving the chamber open. Some observers, seeing the "pursuit" at this stage, have concluded that the amceba formed the chamber be- fore the partial enclosure of the ciliate. In the presence of a large number of ciliates the amceba moves about but little. It sends out many pseudopods forming pockets, apparently in readiness for them, and often succeeds in catching them with remarkable rapidity. Our observations seem to indicate that this reaction is characteristic only of amoebas that have for several days been feeding on ciliates. The adjacent photograph (Plate II) shows an amceba catch- ing protozoa. The following series of camera lucida drawings of an amoeba moving into a field containing ciliates shows the forms characteristic in a number of captures and also the peculiar pocketed outline and hooked pseudopods which seemed to be characteristic of forms feeding habitually on ciliates. See Fig. 6. The amoeba often follows a paramcecium or a ciliate until it is caught or lost. This "pursuit" may continue for twenty minutes or more as is indicated by the drawings of an actual instance, Fig. 7. The drawings show the touch by the paramcecium, the "pursuit," the partial capture and formation</page><page sequence="10">? 6:13 5:55 __ ,K: ['!D- -t'_-....? tut v , tlafl_, TT N,.- .$2,-5312.;.?

When in "pursuit" in this way the amoeba does not gener- ally respond to other stimuli, especially if close upon its prey.</page><page sequence="12">240 GIBBS It seems able to detect a parapmecium at some distance, and will continue the "pursuit" some time after the paramcecium has gone from the field. The intensely interesting sight of an amoeba after numerous trials gradually sliding its pseudopods around a feeding paramcecium, throwing a cover over it, clos- ing the pseudopods, and gradually squeezing the struggling victim down to a rounded mass can hardly be described with- out using anthropomorphic terms. It requires a number of adaptations and considerable skill, which our observations seem to indicate are acquired by the "method of trial and error." The capture is seen to be difficult when we compare the reac- tion times of the two animals. That of the paramcecium is too short to be measured without special chronometric apparatus, while that of the amceba is about one and one-fourth seconds. The stages and adaptations of "pursuit" are well shown in the photographs by Dr. Dellinger, Plate III. They show the first stage of "pursuit," the gradual enclosure, the formation of the chamber, the tension or squeezing effect, the enclosure, and finally an amoeba containing a recently captured paramoecium and the partially digested remains of four or five others. This slow reaction time of the amoeba must be considered when describing its choice of food. It may be seen partially to enclose dead cells or ciliates and then withdraw, for the reaction-choice apparently cannot take place until some time after contact. The amoeba shows distinct food preferences: with diatoms and unicellular algae, it takes algae, but when feeding on algae it will leave them to "pursue" ciliates. In the presence of large paramoecia, some amoebas leave algae and ciliates to catch these larger forms. Amoeba eats nothing dead. This was observed in the case of dead diatoms and algae cells, of para- mcecia dead from natural causes, and of paramcecia which had been artificially killed. Amoebas apparently do not eat their own species, but were seen to eat amoebas of other species. When the food is changed as a whole, some observations seem to indicate that many amoebas required several days to make the adjustment, especially if this adjustment means new adaptations and movements, as in passing from feeding on algae to feeding on paramoecia. But all are not alike; some amoebas seemed able easily to adapt themselves, while others were un- successful. The advance in complexity of the one stage over the other is very great. An amoeba suddenly placed in the midst of a large number of paramoecia, which bump it and knock it about, usually makes no response to the separate stimuli, but seems "con- fused." Later, some amoebas in these circumstances, put out pseudopods and may "pursue" a single paramoecium without</page><page sequence="13">rC~4n u C "`, 'I .

A number of minor observations should be noted. The ac- tion of the contractile vacuole was carefully observed. It was found that the rate of its pulsation varies greatly, but was slowest in nearly rounded and sluggish forms, and more rapid in actively moving forms, that it empties through the ectosarc with a distinct mouth, that some fluid is discharged, that the vacuole usually, if not always, reappears at the same spot. The evacuation of particles was also frequently seen taking place from a food vacuole, the particles being expelled by contraction of the vacuole. Although amoeba were often found in contact, no trace of conjugation was observed. On the other hand, they were fre- quently observed to avoid each other. From the facts observed it would seem that I. The amwba proteus in common with higher animals has distinct periods of work and rest, depending for degree and duration upon the nature and abundance of food upon which the animal is habitually feeding. 2. That the amwba proteus has food preferences and in gen- eral the power of adapting itself to changes in food conditions. This power of adaptation and of choice is perhaps the result of a learning process based upon the "method of trial and error." 3. That the amafba proteus is capable of a sort of "pursuit" with the various adaptations which this involves. The study seems to show that amoeba can no longer be con- sidered as a bit of but slightly differentiated protoplasm, but must take its place in the true animal series with the rudiments at least of true animal behavior.
