It would be difficult to assign a more demanding task than the one which Michael Novak, the editor of Ameri can Philosophy and The Future, and his contributors have set for them selves. They aim at nothing less than suggesting the future course of Ameri can thought. Of course, the future is indefinable; that is its meaning. But improbable as it may seem, something comparable to such an achievement has been accomplished. The device enabling the contributors to provide a sense of direction for American phi losophy is relatively simple: they focus on the concerns of contemporary youth. And in responding to the ques tions of today, they direct attention to the themes of tomorrow. Issuing a respectful but firm chal lenge to the school of linguistic anal ysis, these essays emphasize the classical age of American philosophy and its great representatives—Peirce, James, Dewey, Mead, Royce, and Whitehead. The recurrence to the past is not, how ever, a nostalgic retreat but a quest for NOTES AND REVIEWS new resources with which to face the future. In sum the contributors urge a return to the American philosopher's stone: Experience. Almost without ex ception, the rewards of the expedition compel attention. Obviously, a thorough examination of all the contributions is not feasible, but a brief survey indicates the rich ness of the volume. There is an im pressive stress on the thought of Wil liam James. Paul Van Buren offers the concept of risk in James' metaphysics as a possible ground for the reconcilia tion of Anglo-American and Conti nental philosophy. Continuing this motif, James Edie discusses the phe nomenological significance of The Varieties. These studies and the con sistent recourse to Jamesian theses in other essays strengthen the case that a renascence is underway. The Philosophy of Religion is ex amined from a number of perspectives. Daniel Callahan in questioning Bright man's Personalist Theism discloses the ineluctable anthropomorphism of any attempt to think about God. An en couraging response is offered by James McClendon Jr. in his "How Is Re ligious Talk Justifiable?"
