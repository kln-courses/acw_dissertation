<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABORIGINAL CHIBCHA SETTLEMENT IN COLOMBIA' ROBERT C. EIDT Los Angeles State College THE student who desires an understanding of the character of most Latin American countries must know something of their pre- Columbian culture. He has little recourse in studying regions that have become entirely mestizo but to learn the languages in which early reports about the aboriginals were made, acquaint himself intimately with the place where the Indians lived, and finally piece together the conscious and unconscious com- binations worked out between these people and the land. The author has chosen to do this in a sample study of the little-known Chibcha Indians of central Colombia, with the hope of gaining further insight into one of the important mestizo areas of South America. Unfortunately, information about the Chib- chas is exiguous. This is the result of paucity of available records and lack of sufficient research. The Chibchas, like the Incas farther south, did not write down their accomplish- ments. Moreover, possessing much less level land than the Incas, they had no familiar isolated place into which they could retreat and save themselves as did the Indians of Peru during the Conquest. As a result, Chib- cha population and language were both lost. Furthermore, there are only three primary Spanish sources that deal with the Chibchas- one from the Jimenez de Quesada expedition included in a work by G. F. de Oviedo y Valdez, another by the soldier-priest J. de Castellanos, and a linguistic study by B. Lugo.2 Little attention has been paid to the Chib- chas in voluminous Indian studies made by 1 This paper grew out of several periods of field investigation in Colombia, one of which was made in 1953 with financial assistance from a grant under the Buenos Aires Convention. Part of the manuscript appeared in an earlier version in a chapter of my doc- toral dissertation, "Land Utilization in the Highland Basins of the Cordillera Oriental, Colombia," Univer- sity of California, Los Angeles, 1954. I am indebted to Henry J. Bruman for reading the present article and for making valuable suggestions. 2The three sources are, respectively, G. F. de Oviedo y Valdez, Historia general y natural de las American scholars. In anthropology, A. L. Kroeber's work in the Handbook of South American Indians (1944) is the only extensive one in English dealing solely with the Chib- chas. In a brief communication, E. W. Haury uses the lack of Colombian archeological rub- bish to suggest that population estimates made by Kroeber and others are too high. Some Spanish-language investigations made since 1944 present new information about the Chib- chas, but have not been widely publicized. To date American geographers have not consid- ered these interesting aborigines and the rela- tionships they established with the land. It may prove useful, therefore, to examine the Chibchas by scrutinizing present physiograph- ical conditions, which have been unchanged since the Indians ruled supreme, as well as the old and new literature dealing with the topic. Investigation of written sources, both Span- ish and English, and extensive field work in the area reveal in detail the extraordinarily close relationship between Chibcha tribes and highland basins in Colombia. The author has studied seventeen of these basins, and presents what he believes to be the first map showing their location. Evidence which appears to have been neglected heretofore makes possible a new estimate of the Chibeha population in and around their basins. In land use it is shown that a much more productive system was worked out by these Indians than by any others in northern South America. The Chib- chas lived in well-organized states, each with distinctive political leaders supported by the people. Indeed, they built a highland basin civilization in some respects equivalent to that of the Incas, and in what appears to have been much less time.

THE ALTIPLANOS The highland basins referred to by South Americans as "altiplanos" are characteristic in the Andes. They appear most often in places where the mountains divide into sub-parallel ranges which tend to converge at both ends. In ancient times these constrictions were easily blocked by orogenic movements or by land- slides, so that large lakes developed in some of the enclosed valleys. Wherever this happened, topsoils washed down from the surrounding mountains and slowly filled in the lakes. Simul- taneously the overflow tended to erode the lip of the basins, thereby lowering the water level. Eventually the lakes dried up and their ancient and often fertile sediments became the nearly level basin floors. The Andes offered the Chibchas seventeen closely-spaced altiplanos between latitudes 41/2 and 61/20N. The basins were located in the Cordillera Oriental-the only range in what is now Colombia which contained a series of these relief features. Although much smaller than their counterparts in Peru, the northern altiplanos were favored in their own way. Because of the more moderate elevation, Colombian basins had a cool, healthy climate which was less rigorous than that in the south. In addition, due to a peculiar local situation, they enjoyed four "seasons" a year in spite of equatorial latitudes. The basins were near the crest of a range that received moist winds from the Pacific Ocean area from March through May, and from the Amazon Basin during September through November. The occurrence of two wet seasons separated by two dry periods made it necessary for the inhabitants to work out a well-planned agri- cultural program. Furthermore, the highland basins were centrally located in Colombia, an important crossroads area; they were treeless and free from dense grass cover; they had relatively fertile soils and possessed important minerals, such as salt, clay, and sandstone- factors which played an increasingly vital role in the lives of the Chibchas after they arrived on the altiplanos. CHIBCHA OCCUPATION OF THE ALTIPLANOS Settlement3 Although there is sufficient evidence that both brachycephalic and dolichocephalic Indi- ans resided in the highlands of Colombia, the routes these people followed into the alti- planos are as yet unknown. The paragraphs which follow are presented mainly as sugges- tions of plausible Indian travel to and from the highland basin region as inferred from the available sources. Further information is required before drawing conclusions as to the actual direction and extent of population movements. At present there are no data which would indicate migrations of Indians between the 3The first Colombian to make a detailed study of the settlement question for the highland basins was E. Uricoechea, Memorias sobre las antigiiedades neo- granadinas (Berlin, 1854). He reiterated a theory expressed by M. de Paravey, in Memoire sur l'origine japonais, arabe et basque de la civilisation des peuples du plateau de Bogota d'apres les travaux recent de M. Al. Humboldt et Siebold (Paris, 1835), which held that the earliest inhabitants of the Cordillera Oriental were related linguistically and physically to the Japa- nese. (Most of the ethnological section of Uricoechea's work stems from J. Acosta's Compendio hist6rico del descubrimiento y colonizacio'n de la Nueva Granada en el siglo decimo sexto [Paris, 1848].) A few years later L. Zerda made similar analogies in his El dorado (Bogota, 1947), but mentioned studies of cranium sizes which revealed both dolichocephalic and brachy- cephalic Indians in the area. This caused some early speculation about the meeting of northern and south- ern types in the Colombian Andes. Near the turn of the nineteenth century V. Restrepo published Los chib- chas antes de la conquista espaiiola (Bogota, 1895), voicing the opinion that the highland basin Indians came from certain tribes in Mexico and had entered Colombia via the north coast. In 1912, however, the pendulum swung the other way and the Chibchas were linked with a Tiahuanacu origin in A. Posnan- sky's Guia general ilustrada para la investigacio'n de las islas del sol y la luna con breves apuntes sobre los chullpas (La Paz, 1912). C. Cuervo Marquez in his Prehistoria y viajes: estudios arqueologicos y etnograf- icos (Bogota, 1920) also claimed that the Tiahuanacu culture extended north to Colombia, using as a basis for his argument the cephalic indices of early skull types found in highland graves and common cultural traits between the Chibchas and the Indians far to the south. More recently (1922) M. Triana, La civi- lizacio'n chibcha (Bogota', 1951), claimed that the rarified atmosphere of the highland basins created a modified human type out of Asians who had found the altiplanos via the Orinoco River. The modified type later mixed with Indians from the north, which supposedly accounts for the confusing evidence pre- sented by altiplano skull measurements.</page><page sequence="3">376 ROBERT C.

South of the main Chibcha area there is rugged terrain similar to that in the west, and although there are several small, high basins in the extreme south of Colombia, there is no evidence that they were ever set- tled by the northern Chibcha groups.4 In the north, the broadest part of the Magdalena River valley and most of its large eastern trib- utaries lead directly to the highland basin region. Simon, in fact, recorded that the Chibchas claimed their ancestors came from Andean valleys north of the altiplanos where they had fought with other groups.5 If cre- dence is given to this report it may be postu- lated that at least some Indians were pushed southward until they found the numerous highland basins. Recently important items have been dis- covered in burial caves of the Mesa de Los Santos in Santander which demonstrate that Chibchas maintained close contacts with Indi- ans north of the altiplano realm, according to Schottelius.6 The Mesa is one of a group of altiplano-like relief features formed at eleva- tions between 1,500 and 1,700 meters. It is located at the confluence of the Sua'rez River (flowing from the altiplano of Ubate) and the Chicamocha River (flowing from the altiplano of Sogamoso) at the north end of the highland basin region (Fig. 1). This outlier of Chibcha territory, sometimes referred to as the Mesa de Jeridas, was inhabited by people who raised irrigated cotton. From it they manu- factured large shawls, or mantas, upon which were sometimes placed designs very similar to card-like patterns used north of the main Chibcha center. Bodies laid in an extended position for burial also represent a cultural current found in the north. Many collars made 4Chibcha contacts with the south appear to be late in date. From one report that a Chibcha usaque, or chieftain, sent runners to Atahualpa for help about at the time of Pizarro's conquest, it may be inferred that the Chibchas had heard of the Incas. Such a fact, if true, might be explained by the aggressiveness of the Incas prior to their defeat by the Spaniards. The Chibchas may well have underestimated the great distance an Inca army would have had to travel to give aid. 5 P. Simon, Noticias historiales de las conquistas de tierra firme en las indias occidentales (Bogota, 1882), p. 307. 6 J. W. Schottelius, "Estado actual de la arqueologia colombiana," Boletin de arqueologia, Vol. 2, No. 3 (1946), pp. 201-212. of sea shells demonstrate a close relationship with north coastal areas. Further examination may establish the extent of movement between the highland basins and places to the north. The fact that relatively little archeological evidence has been found in the altiplanos where a sizable group of aborigines dwelt, suggests that the Chibchas were recent immi- grants. If this is the case, one might expect to find linguistic affiliations with the areas where they originated. The languages most closely related to the Chibcha tongue are found in Central America. In fact, at least two authori- ties place the Central American Rama with Chibcha Proper. Detailed linguistic analysis may some day shed light on whether or not one of these is the source from which Chibcha Proper evolved. Similar problems arise in regard to Chibcha relationships with the region east of the high- land basins. Land in the east is flat, and thousands of kilometers of upriver travel through Orinoquia and Amazonia lead to Chibcha territory. The chroniclers reported the use of a "language" in the eastern part of the altiplano realm which was very different from Chibcha Proper. The presence in the region of small numbers of funeral urns with cremated remains would tend to establish relationships with lowland Indians from the east, where use of this culture trait is much in evidence. Once again, the question of the extent of movement cannot be solved at pres- ent because of insufficient data. Population Distribution The area occupied by the Chibcha Indians at the time of the Spanish arrival coincides almost exactly with the distribution of high- land basins in the wide part of the Cordillera Oriental. Chibcha dominion was exercised mostly on the altiplanos themselves at eleva- tions above 2,000 meters, although large set- tlements were found below this level around highland basins and in areas linking them, and in the small group of altiplano-like formations in the north. Political boundaries marked by early his- torians of the Chibcha civilization were not always in agreement. Although most selected a frontier which was near Fusagasuga at the southern limit of the altiplanos, few concurred on the northern extent. Simon placed the bor- der south of Velez.

The greatest probable area embraced by the Chibcha Indians was approximately 26.000 square kilometers. Of these. about 3.000 square kilometers. or only 12 percent of the total amount of land. pertains to the level- surfaced altiplanos. Yet. as is brought out below, nearly half of the Chibchas may have inhabited the small amount of land in these fertile basins. Poptulation Densitty Chibcha population estimates cannot be made on the basis of archeological evidence. Even large deposits of wastes which ordinarily are associated with sizable native groups have 7.Acot44. Op. Cit.. p. 127: Simon. op. cit.. p. 115: Re!trepo. Op. cit. not been located. It would appear. however. that the lack of refuse is closely associated wvith the probability that the Chibehas had not been in the altiplanos long enough to accumiu- late the expected amount of debris for a group of their size. Lack of evidence may also be associated awith the paucity of scientific investigations in the area. A puzzling item regarding the Chibeha people is that even the number of graves encountered in the altiplano region has never been great by comparison Wvith those still being found in parts of the larger area of Antioquia. for example. where original population density estimates are much lo~wer. One reason for the apparent discrep- ancv is that in Antioquia the graves have almost all been uncovered at levels belomv 2.400 meters.

EIDT December A more general treatment is given other highland basins in the eastern cordillera, and specific figures are rare. Simon tells us that in Guane territory the Indians were so thick that the hills and valleys looked alive with swarm- ing humans. He adds that when the Spaniards first entered the province of Guane there were more than 100,000 Indians in that province. Castellanos asserts that the area occupied by the Guane had 30,000 peopled houses, and that the province was literally a "well" of natives.11 On the basis of the above figures, which are taken from the most dependable of the early chronicles, some attempts can be made to esti- mate the total population of the Chibchas at the time of the Conquest. Perhaps the most important general number to work with is that given by Castellanos regarding the 30,000 "peopled" houses in Guane country. Our prob- lem is to calculate the total population for the 6,000 square kilometer region (Fig. 1). In theory, four people per family, i.e., two par- ents and two children, are required to main- tain a population. In practice, where survival conditions are far from ideal, five people per family (three children) would seem to be a more reasonable figure. If we assume that each Guane house had five persons living in it, a population of 150,000 results. Simon's esti- mate of "more than 100,000" offers a check against this number. It is somewhat more difficult to make a computation for the altiplano region south of the Guane area. It is fairly certain that the population density in the south was higher, especially on the large altiplanos themselves. A military figure, quoted both by Castellanos and Herrera, is the 50,000 or 60,000 warriors led by the Zipa in battle against the Zaque. Using the smaller number, and estimating that these men represented the usual American Indian army of all arms-bearing males between 15 and 50, the population can be calculated. If we assume, as others have done in Middle American calculations, that the proportion of arms-bearing males was approximately the same in 1500 as it is now in this part of Colom- bia, i.e., about 23 percent of the total, the 10,000 square kilometers controlled by the 11 Simon, op. cit., pp. 348, 363; Castellanos, op. cit., p. 317. Zipa must have supported about 217,000 people. The 40,000 warriors mentioned for the 6,000 square kilometers in Zaque territory give a total population of some 174,000 in that sector. Using the Castellanos estimate of 12,000 soldiers in the Sogamoso region (1,500 square kilometers), an over-all population of 52,000 results. The surprising thing about the military and other estimates made in the chronicles is that they cover the areas ruled by four of the five Chibcha usaques. Only one area, that ruled by the Tundama, was left without any esti- mates. Since the Tundama ruled over approxi- mately 2,000 square kilometers of land in every respect similar to the rest of the alti- plano countryside, a simple extrapolation of population densities will provide us with a fair estimate. The other altiplano regions yield an over-all arithmetic density of 25 persons per square kilometer. Thus, the Tundama probably ruled over some 50,000 inhabitants. If the areas and populations of the separate Chibcha regions are totaled, the following estimate is obtained: Area Popula- sq. km. tion Zipa -10,000 217,000 Zaque -6,000 174,000 Guane -6,000 150,000 Sogamoso - 1,500 52,000 Tundama -2,000 50,000 Total- 25,500 643,000 An inspection of modem crop yields in the Chibcha homeland shows that sufficient food staple (potatoes) could have been produced to support an estimated population of about 600,000. At the present time, annual potato yields in the departments of Cundinamarca and Boyaca average approximately five metric tons per hectare (i.e., 56 bushels per acre). Even if we assume that yields of this major crop are twice what they were 400 years ago when farming methods were substantially the same, but fertilizers and insect controls were unknown, one percent of the total Chibcha area would have had to be farmed to yield approximately three bushels per year for every single inhabitant. This would be ample when supplemented by other types of food, such as corn and meat, to supply the population with a generous amount of nourishment. That food was plentiful we have little doubt.

The next question that arises is whether or not the 25.500 hectares of land needed for this kind of potato production could have been farmed by a population of 600.000. If wse assume that one adult can farm only one third of a hectare of heavy altiplano soil. then 76.500 farmers would be required. Since this involves less than 1:3 percent of the total population. and only 8.:) percent of the level altiplano ter- ritorv. it is evident that more land was actually available for cultivation than wvas needed. This Would explain the early reports of abundance mentioned by the chroniclers and helps us to understand v-hv the Chibchas were able to develop such a thriving commerce. Thus it would appear that the pre-Conquest Chibcha population estimate of 600.000 as obtained from the chronicles is a reasonable number. It lies well below Kroeber's purely arbitrary figure of over one million (40 per- sons per square kilometer ) but it is above the very small and presumably arbitrary number of :300.000 quoted by Steward.'l 12 J.

If the latter 500 or more houses represent 2.500 people. the density of these 25 square kilometers of land is at least 100 per square kilometer. If this is the density on the rest of the altiplano lands and their immediate vicinities in the flanking mountains. then it is conceivable that nearly half of the Chihcha population lived in this favored level portion of the Cordillera Oriental.

A fews stone pillars in the western part of the Leiva altiplano and along the east border of the Laguna de Fuiquene have been discovered. but never explained. Apparently the (late) Chibcha civilization had either not quite achieved full-scale construction of stone buildings or had rejected them because of earthquakes. and utilized the less durable. but easily replaced huts mentioned above. From the chronicles we have little idea as to the actual description and function of Chibcha \illages and tokvns. Judging from the nature of the Chiblha's interest in trade exchange. it is possible that many of the agglomerated set- tlements formed the core areas for large mar- kets. Others may have been towens (called pueblos and ciudades by the chroniclers) which were centers of industrv for the salt- brick. pottery. and textile manufacturing car- ried out in the highland basins. Some centers were located where state authorities lived and performed their official duties. Regarding the latter function Oxiedo reported: "There are chieftains with 10.000 servants. . . 20.000 and others with :30.000: and each has his settle- ments spread throughout the valleys and lands. of 10. 20. :30. 100 ... more or less houses in each settlement. according to the character and fertility of the land.'"

EIDT December months, whereas corn requires twice as long. Using the early-maturing potato, or the criolla, even today several potato harvests can be obtained to one of corn. Valuable as the potato was, the Chibchas were never able to develop that famous Inca hardtack, called chunio, which made extended military operations so successful. The Chibchas could not have frozen the potatoes easily for chunio prepara- tion because the Colombianf altiplanos are not high enough to experience reliable night freezes. Corn was raised and at least six varieties were cultivated: maiz de arroz, blanco, colo- rado, rojo blando, amarillo, and negro. Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) is found in the alti- planos and may have been used as a supple- mentary grain. Cubio (Tropaeolum tuber- osum) was another native crop which the Indians had in great quantities, according to Herrera. Several tubers which seem to have been of less importance were: ibia (Oxalis tuberosa), chugua (Ullucus tuberosus), from tierra fria, and yuca (Manihot utilissima, var. dulce), arracacha (Arracacia xanthorrhiza), and batata (Ipomoea batatas) from tierra tem- plada and tierra caliente. Meat was obtained from the deer and from fricos (guinea pigs), both of which are rarely seen now, turtle doves, ducks, partridges, and fish, all of which were seasoned with salt from the mines on the Sabana of Bogota. The items mentioned above were prepared for consumption in various ways, and several of the native dishes are still prepared on the altiplanos. Corn is a useful grain from which corn soup or sugua was made; ground corn wrapped in leaves (from Guzmania sp.) and cooked in water or baked like bread is still common. Fermented corn served to make dapqua or chicha, which is still an important alcoholic drink, although its use has declined since 1949 when declared illegal by the gov- ernment. Another item on today's diet is changua, apparently a Chibcha word for one of the varieties of soup. The word changua is in current usage, although the soup is now prepared differently; milk has been added since the introduction of cattle to the alti- planos by the Spaniards. Coriander, i.e., cilantro or culantro (Coriandrum sativum), is an important ingredient. Coca leaves were chewed with lime ground by pestles in miniature mortars that have been unearthed in great numbers in the altiplanos. Coca is not used today in the region, although up until about 1945 it was purchasable in the large markets of Bogota. The employment of coca was probably never a vice to the Chib- chas, who are reported to have used it mainly as a purgative. The drug was not needed to alleviate hunger pangs and the discomfort of freezing temperatures, both of which are more frequent on the higher altiplanos of Peru and Bolivia where coca is still habitually used. Trade and Transportation The surplus products from various special- ized Chibcha industries, such as agricultural goods, cotton mantas, salt bricks, ceramic wares, emeralds, and hand-worked gold ob- jects, were carried to centrally located alti- plano areas which served as markets. Principal among them were Sorocota, Tunja, and Tur- meque in the north, and Zipaquira, Bocata' (Bogota), and Pasca in the south. The first and last towns served as places of exchange with Indians from the lower and upper Mag- dalena, respectively, whereas the others were for trade among the Chibchas themselves. In regard to the latter, for example, the Indians of Tunja lacked salt and traded constantly for this item with the Bogotaes. Unfortunately, not too much is known about the markets or the methods employed. Res- trepo records that markets were held every four days. Freile states for the latter part of the seventeenth century that in the market at Bogota' "three to four thousand Indians came, and over the cargos of coca, cotton, and mantas, put some 100 pesos of gold in tejuelos (small coin-like forms varying in diameter), others 50 pesos more or less, as they wanted to buy or contract.... Finally, there was no Indian so poor who did not carry in a sack hung on his neck, six, eight, or ten pesos...." These coin-like forms were not embossed, and their use may be likened to that of the cacao bean in Central America and Mexico before the Conquest. The incessant trading carried on by the Chibchas established a great need for effec- tive distribution of trade items. Favored by the absence of trees and tall grasses the Chib- chas could move their produce freely over the 17 Freile, op. cit., pp. 260-261.</page><page sequence="12">1959 ABORIGINAL CHIBCHA SETTLEMENTS IN COLOMBIA 385 altiplanos but depended upon trails between highland basins. Unfortunately this particular altiplano region was devoid of the only Ameri- can animal which the Chibchas could have utilized for carrying trade goods. Llamas, so effectively employed by the Incas, were miss- ing in Colombia's main group of high basins.'8 The result was that the Chibchas had to carry goods on their backs. Some of the cargos must have been difficult to manage. Salt cakes from Zipaquira weighing fifty to seventy-five pounds each were found in warehouses far from the Sabana of Bogota by Jimenez de Quesada and his men. Land Tenure It cannot be stated positively that the Chib- chas had private ownership of land, but a case can be made for it by piecing together scat- tered comments from the more reliable early historians, such as Castellanos and Simon. The former, for example, reports that the husband of any woman who died at childbirth had to give one-half the family "farm" to the wife's closest relatives. Simon recorded of the Chib- chas that "their children and women, if they leave them, only inherited the land [bienes raices], because the furniture and treasure were buried with them in the graves." He further states that the children of the chiefs did not inherit their fathers' political realms, but only "the farms left on death, which were divided among them and the women they left, because the state [itself] was inherited by the son of the chief's sister." Simon also wrote that after the Indians built their houses, fiestas were given for neighbors, "but each [person] with expenses according to his possibilities." Zerda observed in a later study that the Chibcha farms were individually delimited by poles laid along the ground and that a special god called Chaquen protected these bound- aries. Finally, Simon stated that the Chibchas "had their adorations in lagoons, hills, etc., 18 According to R. M. Gilmore, "Fauna and Ethno- zoology of South America," Handbook of South Amer- ican Indians, ed. J. H. Steward (Washington, D.C., 1950), Vol. 6, p. 434, the area occupied by the llama extended into southern Colombia during the fifteenth century. This is further evidence of Chibcha associa- tion with the. north rather than with the area south of the altiplanos, since if contact with the Incas had been maintained, use of the animal might have been pre- served. There are pet llamas on hacienda land in the Colombian altiplano region today. and each person had a private spot in them for such adoration."19 Communal ownership of the land would probably have been indicated by general com- munity labor among the Chibchas. Yet only once is community work mentioned in early writings, and that refers only to specially des- ignated land reserved to the priestly caste: "After celebrating the fiestas they went into a house which they did not leave other than to make offerings, because their planting and work was done for them by the community ... so that they could be less occupied and dis- turbed and give more of themselves to the services of the gods."20 Not even in the case of the Zipa or the Zaque was anything similar recorded. These rulers had tax collectors who exacted tribute from all the people irrespective of their occupation. In case of default, the agent of the ruler tied a mountain lion or bear especially raised for this purpose to a post in front of the subject's hut. The victim even had to feed the beast until the debt was paid. A society with communal land ownership and labor customs might have demanded that individuals be permanently attached to the land. However, this was not the case among the Chibchas. Castellanos reported that gold- smiths from Guatavita who did roving work in the Zipa's territory paid no taxes, and as a consequence the Guatavita chief was obliged to support two of the Zipa's subjects for each goldsmith hired out. This went on until the Zipa had sent "more than 2,000 loafers" to the chief.2' The concept of private property would seem, therefore, to be in keeping with Chibcha land tenure, since there was a distinctly private nature to the inheritance, religious, and labor practices mentioned above. The conclusion that can best be drawn from these data points toward a sense of private ownership of the land, in which certain responsibilities were accepted along with the rights involved. Land Use The population density calculations made earlier indicate that half the Chibcha Indians lived in the altiplanos and their immediate neighborhood. The basis for maintaining such 9 Simon, op. cit., p. 293. 20 Ibid., p. 291. 21 Ibid., p. 309.</page><page sequence="13">ROBERT C. EIDT December ft = al -VI -. Fic. 7.

Physiographically. the altiplanos were especially favored. By virtue of their marginal location in cool lands at the upper limit of tropical forests. they presented excel- lent conditions for the development of a stable agricultural society. The highland basins Deere once filled fvith crater. and w.hen the lakes in them emptied they left rivers and lagoons which supported edible fish and wrater fowl. The altiplanos had fertile soils. and the Chib- cha Indians made the most of planting crops in them. In fact. it became necessary to develop newr methods of farming in order to adapt to altiplano conditions. Alternating seasons in the cool highlands posed special problems. particularly in the south. In the matter of planting. the Indians learned that digging sticks wsere not good enough to break the hard clayev earth during dry seasons. Consequently the Chibchas Waited until the newt rains had thoroughly softened the soil before preparing it-a prac- tice which is still adhered to in places but which is no longer adequate because harvests are not sufficiently reliable. Then. contiguous mounds of earth some :30 centimeters high and atbouit a meter across weere constructed to act as planting beds above the saturated soil. Apparently these mounds wvere reworked fre- qtuentlv just as they are today. Although their concern for drainage led to specialized land preparation. the Chibchas evidentlv wsere not worried about erosion. This again suggests that there wvas still plenty of farm land available at the time of the Con- quest. On hillsides the Indians laid out rows of mounds at right angles to the contours. just as modern farmers do.-2 In Guane territory, where the dry seasons were more pronounced. irrigation ditches wvere led from rivers to the fields. It is possible that irrigation wvas used in other Chibcha areas \vhere the climate is similar to that of the Guane region. but verv little was written about this phase of land use during the early colonial There mere fe-w terraces on the lows bordering mountains whose slopes were not alwav.. steep and on which rather deep soils formed above the easily decomposed sedimentary rocks.

After the harvest the Chibehas had to pay tribute in the form of gifts" to the rusaqucs. ewho in turn rendered to the Zipa and Zaque. although exact procedure again is not mentioned. Besides production for home use and tribute, there was ample surplus for trade. In this manner altiplano diet was supplemented by fruits and vege- tables from warmer regions. Some time after the Chibchas had begun to rely more on altiplano agriculture. they learned the advantage of growsing surplus food for the dwindling supply of red deer in their realm. Once Indian leaders began to protect the animals for state purposes. the herds must have increased. From reports of the early chroniclers it is known that no Chibeha com- moner could kill a deer unless given permis- sion by the chief. even if crops Dvere damaged. The assistance thus given toward maintenance of state herds so increased the number of deer that when the Spaniards arrived they were surprised by the "infinite number [of deer] like the livestock [ganados] in Castile.7 Simon in fact. reported that 'live and dead deer" were brought to the first Spaniards \who visited the altiplanos. Zamora's observations as to the real lack of adequate hunting equipment amona the Chibchas. and the care wvith which they later wvatched their European cattle. Would seem to strengthen the view that many deer wsere tamed by these Indians. Guinea pigs and Muscovv ducks were also used to supplement the agricultural diet. as we have noted. There must have been a bountiful food supply on all the altiplanos. Castellanos recorded that the lands of the Sabana of Bogoti wsere -fertile. healthy. and abundant with things necessary to life.- and Oviedo reminds us that the food supplies on the Tunja Sogamoso) plain were even greater. As progress was made in subsistence agri- culture. the Chibchas began to set aside cer- tain areas for commercial crops to be used '- Herrera. op. cit.. p. ;310.</page><page sequence="15">:388 ROBEJRT C.

As the demand for warm clothes increased with population growth. specialized industries grewt up. such as the manufacture of cotton shawvls at Tunja. The yarn was made with spinning whorls which may still be seen on the altiplanos. although the material nowv used is wool. Women probably often spent the time traveling on country routes by spin- ning while they walked along, as they do today. The yarn they made was woven on vertical looms attended by specialized wveav- ers. Intricate geometric designs were woven. stamped vwith bone rollers ). or painted on the cloth. As the Chibehas familiarized themselves w-ith the high plains they discovered that varicus useful rarv materials vvere available locally. One of these wvas salt. which could be obtained at Zipaquird. Nemoc6n. and Tausa on the altiplano of Bogota. The Chibchas learned to make salt cakes by boiling down brine in clay vases called gachals. each of ,-hich wvas broken off from around the finished salt cake. From this industry tvo important groups of specialists arose: ( 1) those wvho prepared the salt cakes. and e2) those wcho began to manufacture the gachaws. For the lat- ter purpose several altiplano regions were favored by the presence of large quantities of good clays. Thus. specialized ceramic indus- tries arose at Soacha (near Bogota ). Tunja. and RBquira (Leiva altiplano). In fact. the word Raquira means city (quira ) of Vases Ra ) in the Chibeha language. In the latter city the vases wvere especially wuell made. smooth and anthropomorphic in form. and sometimes painted wmith twvo or three colors.

The precious stones became part of the barter for necessary trade goods among both the Chibchas and with neighboring tribes. The Chibchas, who prized gold, began to acquire considerable quantities of the metal by trading with other Indians. Chibchas spe- cialized in melting gold either in the pure form or alloyed with copper and silver. Some metals for the alloy were imported from deposits north of the Leiva altiplano. Clay and stone molds have been found near Guatavita (alti- plano of Bogota') where the industry thrived. Characteristic of Chibcha cire-perdue is hand- some filigree-like work; hammered chest plates, pins, and many other items were also manufactured. Today's altiplano descendants tell that their ancestors knew a closely-guarded secret for molding gold in their very hands. Such fables testify to the quality of the art, and it may be that the Indians who knew the specialty had learned to use coal for the melting process. Although the use of coal by the Chibehas does not seem to have been general, there is evi- dence that suggests its restricted employment by special groups. Coal is abundant and easily picked out of exposed veins in several places on the altiplanos. At Guatavita itself there are coal mines in production now. Significant, for example, are the findings at a Chibcha burial site reported by E. Silva Celis in which he writes: "At levels of 60, 75, 80, and 90 centi- meters we found a good deal of coal in various sizes, of which some showed clear signs of cal- cination. The said coal we identified plainly with that which is abundantly exploited by country folk in Ombachita, not more than one kilometer from the site of our investigations."25 The investigations took place in Sogamoso, the chief religious center of the Chibcha civiliza- tion. Other pieces of coal were found in the same area mixed with charcoal, human bones, ashes, and pots. Conscious use of the coal has not been determined by these findings, although they indicate that the aborigines liv- ing in the chief religious area possibly associ- ated coal and charcoal with similar uses. I have been informed that charcoal has also 25 E. Silva Celis, "Investigaciones arqueologicas en Sogamoso," Boletin de arqueologia, Vol. 1, No. 1 (1945), p. 40. been found in a grave near Saucio in the Choconta' altiplano. Political Divisions One of the main achievements of altiplano Indians was their subdivision of the highland area into separate political units. These were administered by the Zipa, Zaque, Sogamoso,26 Tundama, and Guane -rulers. The largest state was that of the Zipa which included the largest altiplano, i.e., the Sabana of Bogota', about half of the altiplano of Ubate, and the smaller highland basin of Choconta' (Fig. 1). The Zipa realm was subdivided into six parts, all of which were so oriented as to focus on the level-surfaced altiplanos so that rapid communications could be maintained from the extremities to the Zipa's headquarters at Bocata. The Zaque ruled over seven separate alti- planos and parts of two others, including the second largest, Sogamoso. The whole area extended from the northern half of Ubate to Sogamoso (Fig. 1). The headquarters were located at Tunja, a town flanking the west end of the Sogamoso basin, and clearly at the approximate geographical center of the sur- rounding altiplanos. The rulers of the Sogamoso and Tundama territories were at the extreme north end of the altiplanos and, as is to be expected, their realms were considerably smaller and less important than the first two. Finally, the region of the Guane extended even farther north to include the altiplano-like mesas of Los Santos, Barichara, and Curiti. The Guane area is contiguous with that of the altiplanos, but the Guane lived at a slightly lower eleva- tion, and were sometimes classified as sep- arate from the Chibchas by early reporters. Perhaps this is because the Chibchas them- selves understood that the Guane were beyond the real altiplano region of the Cordillera Ori- ental-or beyond altiplano administrative con- trol-and gave this impression to the first Spaniards in the area. It is to be noted that the boundary lines separating these five regions were later closely approximated in the Spanish political division of the land (Fig. 1). This is true both for departmental (state) and for municipal bound- 26 The term "Sugamuxi" is sometime used for Soga- moso but appears to have been introduced in later writings and may therefore be in error.</page><page sequence="17">:390 ROBERT C.

The Chibcha talent for regional organization wvas outstand- ing and the Spanish soon recognized its worth. StUMMARY A-ND CONC-USION The altiplanos of the Cordillera Oriental formed the basis for an important phase of the evolution of Chibcha culture. It is clear that the early inhabitants wsere provided wvith a healthful. level area w.-here food could be grown in great enough quantities to meet the demands of an increasing population. Drought in certain parts of the plains wvas sufficiently pronounced so that the Chibehas developed ways of irrigation, and when drainage wvas a problem. they constnrcted mounds of earth for planting. Native wild life \was recognized as an important source of food. and guinea pigs. Nluscovv ducks. and deer wvere fed with agricultural surpluses.

At the time of the Conquest the two most powt erful Chibcha rulers. the Zipa and the Zaque. resided on the largest altiplano. and on the second largest. respectively. The Zipa. who lived on the Sabana of Bogota. had his headquarters and recreation areas in the vicin- itv of modern Bogota. The Zaque presided Where the city of Tunja has been built (capital of Bovaca . Communications were maintained easily between and among the altiplanos. The level- ness of the highland basins and their proximity to one another made it simple to exchange ideas as well as items of commerce. The trad- ing sites. the larger religious shrines. the man- ufacturing communities, and the Zipa's and other leaders headquarters. recreation grounds. and garrisons, all made up "urban" centers of Chibcha societv. The chroniclers not only used the word Stowln in describing some of these. but occasionally even referred to them as cities.</page><page sequence="18">1959 ABORIGINAL CHIBCHA SETTLEMENTS IN COLOMBIA 391 The fact that coincidentally many Chibcha culture traits had counterparts in the invading European culture was a significant element in the absorption of this society by the Span- iards. The conquerors not only found the Indians good farmers and attractive people, but kept many of the native settlements with their original names, and even organized their own states partly along Chibcha-determined boundaries. The Spanish, who never found much gold in the Chibcha realm, quickly set- tled down to the more practical task of getting along the only way the altiplanos could sup- port them-that of living with the Chibehas and learning their methods of agriculture. Jimenez de Quesada, who founded a new civilization at the official center of the most powerful altiplano ruler, was able to control all the Colombian basins, and all the Chib- chas, for there were no vast altiplano areas into which the Indians could retreat as did the Incas in Peru and Bolivia. It is not surprising, therefore, that Colombia has a uniform mes- tizo population today, whereas Peru and Bolivia, which had much larger altiplanos with enormous mineral wealth nearby, still have two separate populations with important physical and cultural differences.
