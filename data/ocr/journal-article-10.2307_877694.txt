<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAYNIE ANDERSON The 'Casa Longobarda' in Asolo: A sixteenth-century Architect's House* FRANCESCO GRAZIOLI's house in Via S. Caterina, Asolo (Figs.I,2) owes its popular but misleading name 'Casa Longobarda' to the inscription which the architect placed on the facade: MAGISTER FRANCISCUS GRAZIOLUS NATIONE LONGOBARDUS ET BARTOLOMEUS EIUS FILIUS ARTE SCULPTORES PROFESSORES EXTRUXERUNT.1 Whereas the popular name suggests Grazioli was a Longobard, the inscription clearly states that he and his son were of the Lombard nation.2 We have no further evidence as to what part of Lombardy he came from before he took up residence in Asolo as architect to Caterina Cornaro. Possibly the only visual reference to his Lombardic cultural heritage is the archaisizing medieval style of the balcony reliefs, notably the scenes from Genesis and the signs of the zodiac. These reliefs may be the only documentation that we have for an interest in medieval Lombardic sculpture in the early sixteenth century.3 The remarkable feature of the facade is that it is decorated in a Tusco-Roman style of rustication, quite in keeping with the primitive roughness of the Lombard reliefs. Such a precocious style of rustication must have been inspired by the auctoritas of Sebastiano Serlio and of Giulio Romano who was working on the Palazzo del Te in Mantua in the years in which Grazioli was decorating his house. This strangely decorated house is worthy of our attention not only for its primitive reliefs and precocious style of rustication but also because it is one of the earliest surviving architects' houses of the Renaissance. The Casa Longobarda must have been built before Francesco Grazioli's death on 26th March, I536.4 None of the other buildings in Asolo attributed to Grazioli such as Caterina Cornaro's villa, I1 Barco, of which only the barchessa survives, the church of Santa Caterina and the monastery of San Gerolamo5 bear any relation to the extraordinary style of the architect's own house. At first sight the date of Grazioli's house may appear very early for such a developed style of rustication, but if we presume that the Casa Longobarda was built shortly before his death in I536, with some knowledge of the text and drawings for Serlio's architectural treatise prior to its publication, the date seems possible but precocious. Serlio only began to publish the first part of his treatise, beginning with book 4, Regole generali di architettura, in Venice in 1537, but his theories and designs were known and used by contemporary architects before they appeared in print.6 Furthermore we know that the major part of Serlio's material was gathered when he was in Rome between 1514 and 1527, working with Baldassare Peruzzi and that he brought it with him to Venice in 1528; even though he spent nine years in Venice there are very few Venetian additions to his material.7 Serlio was acquainted with Venetian architects but he himself received only two commissions whilst he was in Venice, one for the design of the ceiling of St Mark's Library and another for a theatre in the courtyard of the Palazzo Colleoni-Porto in Vicenza, neither of which survives.8 It is very probable that Francesco Grazioli met Serlio when he was in Venice perhaps through Caterina Cornaro's cousin, Alvise Cornaro, whom Serlio certainly knew. And in this connection it is perhaps significant that the frieze of triglyphs alternating with rosettes, heads of Jupiter and other motifs on the Casa Longobarda is reminiscent of a similar one designed by Falconetto for Alvise Cornaro's house in Padua.9 The facade of the Casa Longobarda shows a general application of Serlio's ideas about rustication, notably in the combination of the lower Doric order (Fig.3) and the upper Ionic order with rusticated bands of roughly hewn sandstone cutting across the shafts of the columns. The great variety of decorative carving on the facade, the prominent caryatids, *I am grateful to Charles Mitchell, Howard Burns and John North for their advice and help in the preparation of this article. 1 In recent literature the house has been briefly referred to by COUNT PIETRO TRIESTE DE'PELLEGRINI: Saggio di Memorie degli uomini illustri di Asolo, Venice [1730], p.88, L. PUPPI: 'I1 "Barco" di Caterina Cornaro ad Altivole,' Prospettive, v. 25, pp.52-64, w.

COMACCHIO; Splendore di Asolo ad tempi della Regina Cornaro, Castelfranco [1969], pp.136-39. Comacchio has reported the inscription on the facade incorrectly, repeating the initial mistakes of the author of the article on Grazioli in THIEME BECKER; Allgemeines Lexikon der Bildenden Kunstler, v. 14, P-555. 2 Despite the popular name of the house, 'Casa Longobarda', the inscription states that Grazioli's nationality is 'longobardus' (lombard) not 'langobardus' (longboard), see FORCELLINI: Lexicon Totius Latinitas, Padua, v.8 [1922], p.26. Furthermore it is most improbable that Grazioli would have wished to identify himself with the Longobards, the despised barbarians who had destroyed the culture of classical antiquity. It was quite a different matter to come from the Lombard plane, from whence generations of Lombard stonemasons and architects, such as Mauro Coducci and the Lombardi family had originated before coming to make their name in the Veneto. 3 The source of the balcony reliefs poses a problem which I have not been able to resolve conclusively. The most likely hypothesis is that Grazioli was imitating a known medieval relief, perhaps from his own birthplace, which is unknown to us today. The closest stylistic parallel to Grazioli's reliefs are the Genesis scenes on the Cathedral at Modena, by the twelfth-century sculptor, Wiligelmo who is thought to have come from Lombardy. Grazioli's interest in Lombard sculp- ture is difficult to explain. The only other Renaissance antiquarian known to have been interested in medieval art was Niccolo Niccoli, whom Poggio praised for his collection of medieval paintings, R. KRAUTJTHEIMER: Lorenzo Ghiberti, Princeton [1956], p.301. 4 The date of Grazioli's death is known from his tombstone in the cloister of the monastery of San Gerolamo, Asolo. 5 See D. M. FEDERICH: Memorie Trevigiane sulle opere di disegno, Venice, v.2 [1803], pp.29-30 for an account of Grazioli's works. 6 R. WITTKOWER noticed the relation between Giangiorgio Trissino's Villa Cricoli, built between 1530 and 1538 and Serlio's illustration of a variation of Raphael's loggia of the Villa Madama in II Terzo Libro de Seb Serlio Bolognese, nel quale sifiguarano e descrivano le Antichita di Roma e le altre cose che sono in Italia, published in 1540, after the Villa Cricoli was finished. He suggested that Tris- sino had access to Serlio's material before it was published (Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism, London [1962], p.61). Similarly A. BLUNT has shown that French architects used Serlio's designs before they were printed, Philibert de l'Orme, London [1958], passim. For an account of the composition of Serlio's treatise see w.

More particularly there is one motif on the ground floor of a male and female term dressed in interlaced bands of rushes, encircled byfasciae, which was inspired by one of Serlio's designs for a rustic door, number XX in the Extra- ordinario Libro di Architettura, published in Lyon in I55Io0 (Figs.3, 4). The most likely explanation is that Grazioli saw a drawing that Serlio had in Venice of a rusticated door, which was later to be used in the Extraordinary Book. As compared with the engraving, the male and female terms on the Casa Longobarda are reversed as would be correct if Grazioli had worked from a drawing. Grazioli made Serlio's terms much squatter and shorter, omitting their feet and two of the basketwork bands. He also substituted a cushion for the hard rock squares above their heads. Serlio's rustic doors were easily adaptable as the central motifs of palace facades and he himself transposed the thirtieth rustic portal to the facade of a governor's palace (Bk 6, XX). Grazioli disre- garded the general composition of the door because he was interested only in the sculptural motif and its architectural significance. The terms are symbolic of the stories which Vitruvius recounted about the anthropomorphic origin of the archi- tectural orders, stories which Serlio and other architects commented upon.xx Vitruvius advised architects that they ought to know tales of this kind because the ornaments described greatly enriched the diversity of their works.'2 One Vitruvian anecdote about the discovery of the shape of the Corinthian capital by the chance placing of a funeral basket above an acanthus plant, which later grew up through the basket to form a volute, was the inspiration for the basket interlacing on Serlio's terms.x3 The male term being bearded and longhaired was characterized as a barbarian, in accor- dance with another passage in Vitruvius where caryatids are described holding up a roof in the effigies of prisoners arrayed in barbarian costume.'14 In the fifteenth century Filarete had suggested that as an additional form of servitude the columns should be made in the form of a man and woman, that is a husband and wife.15 It was highly appro- priate for an architect's house to be decorated with these terms since they referred to the origin of the architectural orders with which every architect should be familiar. Unlike other early artists' houses such as Mantegna's in Mantua the Casa Longobarda remains substantially as it was in the sixteenth century. The only known restoration took place in 1941. An Alinari photograph (Fig.6) taken before the resoration shows that on the upper floor one piece of stone, to the right of the siren caryatid, on the third balcony was missing. The restorer who made the new block invented subjects like the personification of Liberality, which he thought appropliate but which as we shall see do not fit the original programme. New balustrades were also made for the two outer balconies. On the lower floor much of the decoration had been covered with cement and stone, which was removed during the restoration to reveal the damaged female term and the remaining part of the frieze. A classical head, which can be just seen emerging from the stone on the right-hand side of the lower floor has disappeared entirely.16 The programme for the imagery of the upper part of the facade was also an imaginative interpretation of Serlian ideas, in this case his suggestions about what is appropriate satyric subject-matter for a rusticated style of architecture. In Book 2 in his section on theatres Serlio explained, commenting upon a passage in Vitruvius, what characteris- tics he thought suitable for the tragic, the comic and the satyric scene. Leaving aside the tragic and comic scene which does not concern us, let us see how Serlio characterized the satyric scene.'7 Serlio wrote that the satyric scene is for the representation of satires, in which those who live licentiously are reproved (La Scena Satirica e per rappresentar Satire nelle quali si reprendono anzi si mordono tutti coloro che licentiosamente vivono, &amp; senza rispetto). However, he continued, one can understand that such licentiousness is a part of the nature of personages, whom we call rustic (Pera tal licentia si puO comprendere che fosse concessa a personaggi che senza rispetto parlassero, come saria a dire gente rustica).8 By these he meant satyrs, nymphs, sirens and other strange creatures of dual nature, part-beast and part-human, who inhabit the rural landscape. The upper part of the facade of the Casa Longo- barda is dominated by one of these creatures, an impressive siren caryatid, a vigorously rustic water deity, half fish and half woman. She stands balanced on two plaited fish tails with suckers in a pose that can only be Grazioli's own invention. Her broken arms suggest that the architect was trying to simulate a fragment of ancient sculpture, perhaps a representation of the most celebrated siren of antiquity, Eurynome, daughter of Oceanos and Mother of the Graces.'9 Grazioli's siren, being half deity and half animal, represents like Pan the generative forces of nature and amore lascivio. The theatrical satyric theme is enforced by the appearance of antique theatrical masks between the balustrades of the second and third balconies. The condition of the balustrades before i94i suggests that there may have been originally more masks on the other balconies which no longer survive. The physiognomy of at least two of the masks, the middle one on the second balcony and the demonically leering mask on the third balcony is characterized as semi-human or divine and semi-beast. On the second balcony the young man is broad-lipped, flat-nosed, with a thick crown of hair and the young girl has her rich curls bound with a fillet. Accord- ding to the classical authority on theatrical masks, Julius 10 For the date of the composition of the Extraordinary Book see DINSMORE, op. cit, p.75. 11 Serlio referred to the passage twice, both in the preface and Cap.

KRAUTHEIMER: 'Tragic and Comic Scene of the Renaissance,' Gazette des Beaux Arts, XXXIII [1948]. 18 Della Scena Satirica, from s. SERLIO: 11 Secondo libro di perspettiv;, Venice [ 1560]. In his dedication of the Extraordinary Book Serlio wrote that he was inspired to design a series of rustic doors when he was in the solitude of Fontainelbeau, 'Where for the present I am to be seen rather in the company of wild beasts than of men,' whereby he explicitly pointed to the parallelism between rustication, a licentious, rule-breaking architectural style and satyric subject- matter. 19 See the description of her statue at Phigalea, Arcadia, Pausanius, VIII, 41. 299</page><page sequence="5">THE cCASA LONGOBARDA' IN ASOLO FIRST BALCONY AQUARIUS DIDO LUCREZIA ANCER F J A U I S T T H I 0 HERCULES, NESSUS ARIES &amp; DEIAIIARA VIRGO SECOND BALCONY GEMINI CHRIST &amp;THE PISCES I IWOMAN OF SAMIARIN I 0 H H A 0 R R I MASKS E T Yr LEO ADArI &amp; CABEL TAURUS7 EVE &amp; ABEL TUU A.

Pollux, whose Omnasticon was published and read in early sixteenth-century Venice, these two masks are comic and worn by a rustic young man of sensual nature and a courte- san.20 Above the three masks of the second balcony there are other three smaller masks, again changelings of mixed nature which resemble the gothic gargoyles of medieval lom- bardesque cathedrals. The four balconies are decorated with reliefs representing the virtues, the signs of the zodiac, the seasons and Biblical and profane stories (Figs.5, 7-9, A-B). Though the siren and the personages who wear the masks are conceded to have a licentious nature those represented in the stories are not. The subjects have been chosen as pagan and Christian exempla of Luxuria and Castita. With only one exception, the Virgin and Unicorn relief, they represent stories of licen- tious people, who in love or in life have disregarded the accepted rules of society. Within the programme parallels are made by the juxtaposition of related themes. On the upper reliefs of the first balcony Dido and Lucrezia are represented as exempla of women who chose to die because they were dishonoured. Dido, deserted by her husband Aeneas committed suicide over a pyre on which she burnt Aeneas's weapons, here represented by a helmet.21 Lucrezia, having been raped by her kinsman Tarquinius is seen in the act of taking her own life, having enjoined her husband and father to avenge her dishonour.22 It is difficult to be absolutely certain about the subject of the scene below because the sandstone is very worn but the most likely possibility is that 20 The OMNASTICON, written by Julius Pollux in the second century was recom- mended by Erasmus in De ratione studii as essential reading for young boys. It was first published by the Aldine press in Venice in 1502, with later editions by Junta, Florence, 1520 and Grynaeus, Basle, 1536. In the fourth book Pollus described various kinds of classical theatrical masks in a section on stage antiqui- ties. These descriptions are still used by classical archaeologists today to classify Greek and Roman masks, see T. B. L.

These two subjects were frequently represented together in the later Middle Ages because both women were adulteresses.24 They are contrasted with the Genesis scenes below, the Fall and Cain murdering Abel. The third balcony has a triad ofjudgement scenes. Below Christ and the Adulteress, Grazioli has represented the Judgement of Solomon in which two harlots dispute the ownership of a child and Susanna and the Elders in which the evil consequences of lust are thwarted by a just judgement. The emblems on the upper relief of the fourth balcony, the Virgin and the Unicorn and the Elephant and the Mandrake Tree are familiar because of their frequent representation in the bestiaries and emblem books. In the Middle Ages it was commonly believed that the unicorn could only be caught by laying its head in the virgin's lap, a legend which was interpreted by Christian writers as an allegory of feminine chastity and the Incarnation. Similarly the elephant was considered a chaste beast because of a supposed reluctance to breed, a legend perhaps occasioned by their long two-year gestation period.25 The story is also told in the bestiary that when the elephant wished to beget children, he went to the East to paradise accompanied by his female, who there ate the fruit of a mandrake tree which she then gave to her husband and as a consequence conceived. The allegory is interpreted in the bestiary as representing the Fall, the mandrake tree being likened to the tree of knowledge.26 The last relief shows Thisbe killing herself over the dead body of her lover, Pyramus, in the presence of the lion who caused the tragedy, again illustrating the theme of death as a result of carnal lust.27 The reliefs of the zodiac in the corners of the balconies are unexpectedly arranged according to Ptolemy's doctrine of the trigones.28 If we inscribe the signs of the zodiac on a circle and draw four equilateral triangles between them the zodiac can be conveniently divided into triplicities. In the lower left-hand corner reliefs of the balconies we find the first triangle represented, Aries, Leo and Sagittarius (restored), in the lower right-hand corners the second triangle of Virgo, Taurus and Capricorn, in the upper left-hand corners the third triangle Aquarius, Gemini and Libra (restored) and in the upper right-hand corners the fourth triangle, Cancer, Pisces and Scorpio. Grazioli's seemingly unconventional way of representing the zodiac was probably inspired by Vitruvius's discussion of the trigona as a model for the ground plan of a theatre.29 In the corners of the fourth balcony the seasons are represented by the following scenes, autumn showing a man harvesting grapes accompanied by his dog (September), winter, a woman seated on a stool warming her hands by a fire (January), spring, a monk potting flowers (April), and summer, a man cutting grain with a sickle (July). Between the signs of the zodiac and the seasons the virtues are represented. From left to right we find Faith, Justice, Charity, Hope, Liberality (restored), Fortitude, Prudence and Fame. In the original programme it seems more likely that Grazioli represented Temperance instead of Liberality, since the four cardinal virtues would otherwise not be complete and similarly that the signs of Sagittarius and Libra were on the same block rather than the decorative flowers which the restorer has carved. If we compare Grazioli's imagery on the facade of the Casa Longobarda with Perugino's painting the Battle between Chastity and Love commissioned for Isabella d'Este's studiolo in Mantua, we find that the theme is a similar one, except that Grazioli's intention, unlike Perugino's was a moralizing didactic one. We have documentary evidence that Isabella d'Este's programme-maker Paride da Ceresara instructed Perugino to make the outcome of the battle between chastity, represented by Pallas and Diana and lust represented by Venus and Amor appear doubtful.30 By contrast, Grazioli as a good satirist should, drew a Christian moral from the stories that he chose to represent. The stories selected from Roman history and Ovid all show death as a result of carnal lust whereas the Christian stories show for- giveness and the possibility of redemption through the Incarnation. The antique theatrical masks, the siren carya- tid, the signs of the zodiac arranged according to Vitruvius's ground plan for a Roman theatre and the rustic terms explaining the architectural origin of the orders are all conceived as a stage setting for a satire, a theme which is appropriate for satyric rusticated architecture. Significantly, Grazioli varied his sculptural style according to what he was representing, choosing a crude archaizing medieval style for the reliefs and an antique style for the masks and caryatid. His intention may have been to give his sculpture the appearance of spoglie such as decorated the house of the antiquarian Lorenzo de'Manili built in the Rione di S. Angelo, Rome (1467)31 and other artists' houses such as Squarcione's in Padua or Dieric Bouts in Haarlem which are known to have had antique reliefs and busts on the exterior.32 There is very little information about artists' houses in the Renaissance, though occasionally there are literary descrip- tions of the facades and their sites can be identified. In architectural treatises such as those written by Francesco di Giorgio and Serlio there are plans described for case d'artisti, which are little more than workshops with a few rooms for the artist's family.33 From what we can deduce from the ground plan of the Casa Longobarda (Figs.C-E) there may have been a similar arrangement here with the ground floor used as the architect's workshop or alternatively Grazioli may 23 Ovid, Metamorphoses, IX, Io0I. 24 Reallexikon zur Deutschen Kunstgeschichte, Stuttgart IV, [ 1958], p.8o i. 25 G.

His plan was to build a small palace containing living quarters, a studio and a rotunda to display his renowned collection of antiqui- ties. The house which was opposite San Sebastiano in Mantua was never completed, and at the end of his life he was forced to sell it to the Gonzaga because of his financial difficulties and it has since been substantially altered.35 D. Ground plan of Casa Longobarda - ground floor. Scale I : 50 In the early sixteenth century the rise in the social standing of the artist and his consequent increase in income made it possible for some artists like Raphael and Giulio Romano to have palatial homes, which were equivalent to those owned by noblemen.36 Giulio Romano, whose annual income Vasari tells us was more than Iooo ducats, bought in I536 a site of land where he built a magnificent residence with una facciata fantastica, tutta lavorata di stucchi coloriti which he finished in 1544 opposite San Barnaba in Mantua.37 The Casa Longobarda was much smaller than the two artists' houses in Mantua just described, but in comparison with other houses in Asolo of the same period it resembled the house of a gentleman rather than an artisan. The imagery on the facade was disconcertingly unusual in contrast to any other building or house in Asolo of the period. It did not have a large garden but it did have the aspect of a rural villa situated on the edge of the town with a view over the surrounding countryside. Grazioli's income can scarcely have been comparable to either Giulio Romano's or Man- tegna's and for the sculpture on the facade he was forced to use a poor quality local sandstone which perishes easily. Nonetheless the Casa Longobarda is a remarkable achieve- ment for its time and place and is a fitting monument to the architect of Caterina Cornaro's Barco.38 34 It should be recalled that Andrea del Sarto and Federico Zuccaro had both built studios apart from their houses. 35 For a recent reconstruction of Mantegna's house see E.

Among the acts of the notary Nadalino Toscani he is mentioned several times, first on 29th December 1507, 'Testibus rogatis: Magister Leonardus pictor q.

In the tax estimates for Asolo for 1530 Leonardo di Verona is again mentioned as resident at the Barco. Since we know of no other painter at Caterina's villa, he may have been the painter responsible for decorating the interior of the villa with frescoes of which only a few fragments remain in the barchessa. 302</page><page sequence="8">7.
