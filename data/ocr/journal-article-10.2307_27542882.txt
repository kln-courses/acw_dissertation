<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WARY FUGITIVE JOHN CROWE RANSOM LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. IT might well be contended that the future Fugitives and Agrarians of Nashville, Tennessee, were members of by far the best-educated generation of young southerners in more than a century. In the 1910s and 1920s the grinding poverty that had all but crushed higher education in the southern states in the decades after the war was ending. The curriculum of a university such as Vanderbilt?like that of schools such as the University of North Carolina and the Uni versity of Virginia?could now be compared favorably with that of the better northern and midwestern universities. The cultural shock of the war and the Reconstruction was fast re ceding. The young southerners going off to college in the early twentieth century no longer operated under such in tellectual constraints as had bound their immediate fore bears. Like the Virginians of Jefferson's and Madison's day, they could now confront the leading trends and influences of their time with receptive minds and eager interest. What they would eventually decide about some of them is another mat ter. If we look at the early career of John Crowe Ransom, we can see how this situation is almost perfectly exemplified. His father, Dr. John James Ransom, was a Methodist minister, as had been his father before him. The young Ransom en rolled at Vanderbilt at the age of fifteen in 1903. After a two year interruption during which he taught school in Missis sippi, he was graduated in 1909. A year later he received one of the first Rhodes scholarships, and went to England to study at Christ Church College, Oxford.</page><page sequence="2">584 THE WARY FUGITIVE Ransom spent three years in Oxford, during which time he found his interests moving steadily from philosophy and the classics to English literature. If Ransom had at this time made any conscious break with his Methodist upbringing, there is no sign of it. Though he profited considerably from his Oxford experience and in particular from his friendship with another young American writer, Christopher Morley, he seems never to have been fully at ease in the English educa tional environment. In later years he wrote a poem, "Philo mela," in which he expressed his feeling of a sense of un reality about the literary and intellectual concerns of Oxford. Addressing himself to the literary nightingale, he notes her appearance in Rome, Germany, France, England; "never was she baptized," however. "Not to these shores she came!" he continues: How could her delicate dirge run democratic, Delivered in a cloudless boundless public place To a hypermuscular race? He "pernoctated with the Oxford students once," he declares, and, "sick of my dissonance," climbed the hill of Bagley Wood to listen to the nightingale: Her classics registered a little flat! I rose, and venomously spat. We Americans are "a bantering breed sophistical and earthy," he laments ironically; "unto more beautiful, persistently more young / Thy fabulous provinces belong." Whatever his re spect for the cultural tradition of England and the continent, he will not, that is to say, settle for an art or a philosophy that is too abstracted from the actualities of his everyday experi ence.</page><page sequence="3">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 585 Ransom returned to the United States in 1913, and for a year taught Latin at the Hotchkiss School, in Litchfield, Con necticut. He wrote to his father that he thought that as a writer he would be happiest in a metropolitan center like New York, and when the senior Ransom wrote back to urge the dramatic possibilities of rural life, his son replied that "country conditions operate to produce in country people the qualities of stability, conformity, mental and spiritual inertia, callousness, monotony." The country community is "very well fortified against the intrusion of ideas from without." He felt that morality and art were adversely affected by an isolated rural environment. In coupling the two, he said, "I am not guilty of a mental lapse because I think the two fields are closely related." Instead of staying in the Northeast, however, in 1914 he came back to Vanderbilt to teach English. Among his under graduate students was a young man, only five years his junior, named Donald Davidson. They soon became friends, and one day in the fall of 1916 Ransom announced to David son that he had written a poem?his first. It was entitled "Sunset" and was in free verse. He read it to Davidson, who was most impressed. Ransom promptly wrote three more and sent them to the Independent where they were accepted and published. In effect the Fugitive poetry movement was un der way. In 1917 John Ransom again showed Davidson some new poems when both were in the army. The new poems were part of a collection which before Ransom left for France he sent to his friend Christopher Morley. Morley gave them to Robert Frost, and Frost recommended them to Henry Holt and Company. Poems About God, by John Crowe Ransom, first lieutenant, Field Artillery, A.E.F., appeared in April 1919.</page><page sequence="4">586 THE WARY FUGITIVE The book was aptly titled. In his preface Ransom an nounced that, having noticed that his first several poems all made considerable use of the term God, he decided that the word was "the most poetic of all terms possible," and had therefore set out "to treat rather systematically a number of the occasions on which the term was in use with common American men." In later life Ransom did not choose to re print any of the Poems About God. They are, indeed, ap prentice work, and exhibit little of the characteristic manner of Ransom's mature poetry. There is seldom visible in them that continuing contrast of a formal stylized literary language with the pungency of colloquial speech that marks his best work, nor do they draw importantly upon the mordant wit and ironic undercutting of the later poetry. But they do ex hibit the fascination with domestic imagery and often the un dercurrent of violence. They are written very much in revolt against poetic diction, and they aim at a simplicity of lan guage and reference that sometimes verges upon triteness. One is not surprised that Robert Frost admired them, for there is more than a little of Frost's manner in evidence, as in the almost proselike conversational tone nonetheless kept in tensified by the rhythm and rhyme. What is most impressive about the poems, however, when viewed in the light of Ransom's origins and his later develop ment, is their God-searching. They indicate how unwilling Ransom was, despite his philosophical bent and his voyaging far from the orthodox Protestantism of his Methodist back ground, to give up the traditional small-town religious atti tude. The poems are almost all explorations of the human condition in a world that has moved away from theological certainty. And that world is generally found to be unavoid able but unsatisfactory. The early poems do indeed constitute, as the preface sug</page><page sequence="5">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 587 gests, an exploration of the kinds of occasions in which the presence of God is supposed to be observable, but the in vestigation is an ironic one, for what usually emerges from the poems is the poet's inability to square that presence with his own realistic and logical diagnosis of the situation. Some times the point is made good-humoredly, even a trifle fatu ously, as in "Noonday Grace," in which father, mother and son sit down to table, and father offers the blessing praying that God "turn not away from us thy face / Till we come to our final resting place." Son thinks I love my father's piety, I know he's grateful as can be, A man that's nearly seventy And past his taste for cookery. But he is not past his taste; he himself prays with total fer vency for the food: Thank you, good Lord, for dinner-time! Gladly I come from the sweat and grime To play in your Christian pantomime. He proceeds to give separate and distinct thanks for napkin, platter, centerpiece, milk, yams, country ham, vegetables, corn on the cob, tomatoes, potatoes, beans, cucumbers, corn bread, and so on. The demonstration is meant whimsically, of course; what Ransom is gently undercutting is the con venience of God as the orthodox conceive of Him?as if it were His particular business to keep the Ransom family well fed. In another "Grace" poem the problem is presented with considerably less lightheartedness. The speaker is concerned with the ugliness and pain of death:</page><page sequence="6">588 THE WARY FUGITIVE Who is it beams the merriest At killing a man, the laughing one? You are the one I nominate, God of the rivers of Babylon. He describes how the hired man and he would work together in the fields, singing hymns, and how on one hot day the hired man, who was pious and believed in salvation, sud denly fell from his horse into the furrow: ... it was a foolish kind of sprawl, And I found a hulk of heaving meat That wouldn't answer me at all. He drags the man over into the shade, angry over the thought "of the prayers the fool had prayed / To his God." Then the dying man vomits: And God, who had just received full thanks For all his kindly daily bread, Now called it back again?perhaps To see that his birds of the air were fed. He has seen God provide merciful deaths, he says, but the hired man "in his vomit laid him down, / Denied the decency of blood." The spectacle makes the speaker himself sick, and he too vomits. Again he views the beautiful Sunday scene about them. The young corn smelled its sweetest too, And made him goodly frankincense, The thrushes offered music up, Choired in the wood beyond the fence. And while his praises filled the earth A solitary crow sailed by, And while the whole creation sang He cawed?not knowing how to sigh.</page><page sequence="7">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 589 Whatever the death may mean, it is horrible and physical, and not to be enclosed within the bounds of a theology that sees God's intervening and benevolent hand in every action. Over the whole performance, however, one has a sense of not merely regret but resentment. That is, the poet explores the disappearance of the Methodist God. But even as he takes aim at the orthodoxy, he seems to be most irked, not at those who insist upon holding to it, but at the orthodoxy itself for being logically absurd. He doesn't want it to be unten able; and when he depicts its untenableness he is not very happy about it, or about the necessity, as he sees it, of having to do so. What is obvious is that for this particular young Tennessee poet, the liberation from the intellectual boundaries of the old southern community past, with its theological orthodoxy, while necessary, is begrudging. He will be a modern because he must be, not because he delights in it. He is very much in the position of the young Ralph Waldo Emerson who, ac cepting the logic of the Unitarianism of Boston, nonetheless remembers how attractive the old Calvinism was in its emo tional fervor and its ordering of the heart and the affections, and wishes he hadn't had to give it up. What would be de sirable is some way of recovering that old Calvinistic attitude and psychology, without at the same time having to defend the strict logic of the theology. Poems About God is a hungry book. What the poet has found thus far, in place of the orthodox Methodist past, is pretty bland and unappetizing. He consumes it, but with a wry face. He is on the lookout for something better, more pleasing to the palate. It ought to exist somewhere. II In the days before the war, Ransom and Davidson had been part of an informal but dedicated group of young men who 4</page><page sequence="8">590 THE WARY FUGITIVE gathered twice a month to discuss ideas, literature, and other things. The group included Sidney Mttron Hirsch, sometime playwright and poet and fulltime mystic; William Yandell Elliott, the future political scientist; Walter Clyde Curry, English scholar and occasional poet; Stanley Johnson, who would soon write fiction; and James M. Frank, a businessman who was Hirsch's brother-in-law. When the young Tennesseans reassembled in Nashville after the war, the twice-monthly discussions resumed. Hirsch had moved in with his sister and brother-in-law. William Frierson, a Vanderbilt senior, became part of the group. By now the talk was centered on poetry and literature rather than philosophy. Ransom and Curry were trading sonnets, and Davidson was writing poetry in earnest. Then in Novem ber of 1921 Davidson did something that was to be of in calculable importance to the group's makeup. He invited a brilliant young Vanderbilt student, John Orley Allen T?te, to visit the next meeting. What Allen T?te brought to the group was an uncompro mising respect for intellectuality, together with an open re ceptivity to modernism in language and attitude. He had al ready read widely in the French poets and in modern verse forms, and during the Fugitive years he was the one who kept the group thoroughly in touch with what was most challenging and vigorous in the literary developments of the early 1920s. Not for him Ransom's skeptical attitude toward what Eliot, Pound, and the expatriate school represented; there is not in his work?whether of the early Fugitive days or the later, more mature poetry he wrote in the late 1920s and 1930s?the evidence that one encounters in Ransom's verse of a divided allegiance, with the rigor of the new tech niques warring with a traditional sensibility. He was not nearly so deeply and instinctively drawn toward the older</page><page sequence="9">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 591 southern community attitudes; his background was both more cosmopolitan and less committed. In Ransom's writings there is always discernible a certain unease amid the heady currents of thought and attitude of the modern world, and a sense of his use of modernism as being a kind of strategy for coping with what he cannot avoid. From the outset T?te is thoroughly at ease in modernism, however much he deplores its values; and as his attitudes begin to coalesce, he is able to work from within it toward a much more radical reformation of those attributes and values that he wishes to change. When one looks at the lyrics of Ransom's Poems About God, he finds that despite the excellence of some of them there is an awkwardness, a hesitant groping quality that comes not merely because Ransom himself is still groping toward a style, but also because he seems to believe that as poet it is his duty to keep from showing any signs of an ex cessive commitment to a position. His rigorous logic and his willingness to search out the implications of an idea or a situ ation and report them fully were not best employed in de picting the laborious process of exploration, but in elaborat ing, with great finesse and subtlety, the outcome. To examine a problem, to investigate its implications with keenness of intellect and fine precision of discrimination, and afterward to set forth his findings were what he had to offer. His gift for extravagance of language and imagery, his ability to dramatize the ultimate implications of a situation, his gleeful, even savage relish for noting and dwelling upon the incon gruities and traps of human contradiction and logical dead end, were being held back by too much linguistic caution and a too-inhibiting poetic self-consciousness. What Ransom needed as a poet was the courage of his convictions, and in the example of one of his students, the young Allen T?te, who did not hesitate to deploy everything at his command and to</page><page sequence="10">592 THE WARY FUGITIVE launch himself fully into the attack, he would appear to have found the encouragement he needed. This, I think, was Allen Tate's principal contribution to the Fugitives. We can see something of the result by comparing the poem that Ransom wrote for the first issue of the Fugitive, "Ego," with a poem written only a few months later but couched in his mature style, "Philomela." "Ego" is about the poet's decision to cast his lot with the muse and to follow the lead of his fellow Fugitives. He notes the criticism that has been made of himself by others (presumably for the Poems About God) to the effect that "a little learning addleth this man's wit" so that 'lie crieth on our dogmas Counterfeit" and does not respect "duly our tall steeple" but prefers his books. He would prefer, he says, to have been "born dull, born blind," if thereby he "might not estrange my gentle kind, / Nor brag, nor run a solitary race," but being neither dull nor blind he cannot avoid the estrangement. He is made the way he is, and cannot help it; there is "my Demon, al ways clamoring Up, Begone, / Pursue your gods faster than most of creatures," and he must heed it. So instead of Comporting downwards to the general breed; I have run further, matching your heat and speed, And tracked the Wary Fugitive with you. Having thus made his commitment, acted to alienate himself from his people, he is satisfied with the look of the balance sheet: And if an alien, miserably at feud With those my generation, I have reason To think to salve the fester of my treason: A seven of friends exceeds much multitude. The difficulty, however, is that the poem has not made its</page><page sequence="11">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 593 commitment fully. Instead of the poem's being constructed from the start with the emphatic and defiant attitude ex pressed in the next-to-last stanza and in the last line, with the claims of the friends and family that would have him desist treated with the irony that such conviction and such defiance would dictate, the attitude wavers throughout, so that at times the speaker seems quite satisfied with his choice, while at other times he feels extremely guilty over having made it. The tone is reflected in the images, which are sometimes very gentle and at other times extremely harsh. This is a very different matter from a poem that might have been written about such an ambivalence and fluctuation of attitudes; in Ransom's poem the ambivalence and the fluctuation are in the stance of the poem, even though the poem is, in intent at least, "about" the poet's entire satisfaction with the choice he has made. If we compare "Ego" with the first published version of "Philomela," which appeared in the Fugitive only one year later, we witness an extraordinary change. This poem, de scribing his search for a viable poetic stance in the literature of English poetry, and his realization that something less precious and pure will have to serve his own American muse, also portrays a movement toward a literary commitment. But this time there is no real ambivalence on the part of the poet. Though he pretends ironically to a regret and remorse over having failed to appreciate the nightingale's voice?"I have despaired if we may make us worthy"?there is no question at any point in the poem what he thinks of the matter. Though the nightingale has spoken to Ovid and the Teutons, and been "gallieized," he is sure that "never was she baptized." The very idea of the nightingale being thus "proc essed" for admission to the Protestant heaven is so absurd that we cannot take the nightingale very seriously. "How</page><page sequence="12">594 THE WARY FUGITIVE could her delicate dirge run democratic?" he asks; clearly she is all too precious and bloodless for his taste. From the start it is quite obvious that he finds "the classic numbers of the nightingale" too removed from the real, too divorced from life, to mean very much for him; and equally that when he refers to himself and his fellow Americans as "a hyper muscular race," dissonant, come from a "barbarous" province and a "bantering breed sophistical and earthy" who cannot make themselves worthy, he is being quite ironically self deprecatory?for he doesn't really believe a word of it. The statement that the "fabulous provinces" of the nightingale belong to "more beautiful, persistently more young" nations is another way of saying that as far as the poet is concerned, the English poets are lacking in vitality and given to childish attitudinizing about nightingales and Beauty. The difference between "Ego"and "Philomela" is that what in the earlier work is a platform for the poet's arguing out the pros and cons of his decision to commit himself to his art has in the later poem become an instrument for the poet's strategy, whereby he carefully shapes the language, the argument, and the development of his poem to achieve the purpose he wishes. Unlike "Ego" "Philomela" does indeed have the courage of its commitment and because it has, it need not insist upon its own earnestness, but can grandly appear to make concessions in order to come down all the more effectively on the chosen side of the argument. Here after Ransom as poet was the crafty strategist, not the Hamlet-like soul searcher, and he proceeded to produce, all during the 1920s, one poem after another that exhibited his wit and his savage sense of irony. Ill It was John Ransom's next book, Chills and Fever, published in 1924, that established him as an important American poet.</page><page sequence="13">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 595 Many of the poems in the book appeared first in the Fugitive, and were revised for the book. Two of his most anthologized pieces, "Captain Carpenter" and "Bells for John Whiteside's Daughter," are contained in it. In 1927 appeared Two Gentlemen in Bonds, with such poems as "Janet Waking" and "The Equilibrists." For all intents and purposes the major part of Ransom's work as poet was now done; only five poems were added to later collections. It has often been pointed out how very domestic is Ran som's muse. So many of the situations in his poems are drawn from everyday, middle-class life, and the same is true of many of the most effective images. He concludes "Winter Remembered," a love poem, for example, with: Dear love, these fingers that had known your touch And tied our separate forces first together, Were ten poor idiot fingers not worth much, Ten frozen parsnips hanging in the weather. The use of the parsnips is typical; and so is the command of colloquial idiom when needed: "not worth much, . . . / hang ing in the weather." It has been remarked that what Ransom could do to perfection was to set off intensified literary lan guage and the colloquial idiom against each other. Thus in "Captain Carpenter" the much-mauled captain calls out an ironic challenge: "To any adversary it is fame If he risk to be wounded by my tongue ill?? Or burnt in two beneath my red heart s flame Such are the perils he is cast among. "But if he can he has a pretty choice From an anatomy with little to lose Whether he cut my tongue and take my voice Or whether it be my round red heart he choose."</page><page sequence="14">596 THE WARY FUGITIVE It is the matter-of-factness of the second line of the second stanza that makes the speech work; slipped in among a vo cabulary and syntax deliberately and flagrantly archaic, it mocks the ancient ballad diction and keeps the poem where it must remain in the realm of sinister playfulness. The same is true of the description of the pet chicken in "Janet Wak ing," done to death by "a transmogrifying bee": It scarcely bled But how exceedingly And purply did the knot Swell with the venom and communicate Its rigor! Now the poor comb stood up straight But Chucky did not. Mixed in with the playfulness and the domestic imagery, masked by the wit and the extravagance of language, how ever, is a considerable ration of violence. Like the young woman of "Vaunting Oak" who had been "instructed of much mortality," Ransom often chose for his subject matter the ter rible swiftness and finality of death, and liked to dwell upon the difficulty of the acceptance of its inevitability by humans. Thus in "Miriam Tazewell" an old maid goes forth in her garden after a storm "to see in the strong sun her lawn de flowered / Her tulip, iris, peony strung and pelted, / Pots of geranium spilled and the stalks naked." The young woman of "Vaunting Oak" would choose the great oak tree as "our love's symbol" because of its sturdiness and its "long winter ings": "Established, you see him there! forever." But her lover knocks on the trunk and shows her the hollow sound of its inner rottenness. The oak, he warns, "before our joy shall have lapsed, even, will be gone." The poem ends with "the tears of a girl remembering her dread." In "Blue Girls" the young ladies of the college are told to</page><page sequence="15">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 597 Tie the white fillets then about your hair And think no more of what will come to pass Than bluebirds that go walking on the grass And chattering on the air. They are instructed to practice their beauty "before it fail." For the speaker knows "a lady with a terrible tongue, / Blear eyes fallen from blue, / All her perfections tarnished" who not long since "was lovelier than any of you." One of the most savage of the poems is a sonnet, "Piazza Piece." The first stanza is spoken by "a gentleman in a dustcoat" who ad dresses a young girl. He warns her to make note of "the roses on your trellis dying / And hear the spectral singing of the moon"?contemplate, that is, the inevitability of age and death. "I must have my lovely lady soon," he tells her. The "lady young in beauty" would prefer not to: she awaits her true love. But what grey man among the vines is this Whose words are dry and faint as in a dream? Back from my trellis, Sir, before I scream! Not only is the spectacle of death and the maiden sinister, but Ransom has infused the transaction with a great deal of suppressed sexual tension: time, one might almost say, as the grim raper. In other poems the violence is more direct. "Necrological," the first of Ransom's poems to be composed in the mature style of the early 1920s, presents a friar who journeys forth from his monastery to the scene of a battle and contemplates the bare bodies of the slain: "Not all were white; some gory and fabulous / Whom the sword had pierced and then the grey wolf eaten." A dead warrior's mistress lies at his feet clutching his knees. A horse which "had spilled there his</page><page sequence="16">598 THE WARY FUGITIVE little brain" is noted, along with its rider: "the little groin of the knight was spilled by a stone." And so on. Often in Ransom's poetry, however, the violence and terror are not stated as baldly, but are ironically gentled by the em ployment of metaphor and diction that are peculiarly blood less and archaic, so that the effect is made more sinister in its very covertness. In "Captain Carpenter" the various sallies of the good captain in pursuit of fame, honor, and duty are each rewarded with physical maiming. The violence is al ways counterpointed by the diction and rhythm of the me dieval ballad. A "pretty lady" takes a sword "with all her main / And twined him of his nose for evermore." A strange rogue uses a club to crack "his two legs at the shinny part / And let him roll and stick like any tub." The wife of Satan, the she-wolf who should have fled "like a hind," is likewise unfriendly: "the bitch bit off his arms at the elbows." The captain "parted with his ears / To a black devil," and another "plucked out his sweet blue eyes." Finally "the neatest knave that ever was seen" performs one of the least violently-described murders in all of literature: "With gentle apology and touch refined / He pierced him and produced the Captain's heart." When I read "Captain Carpenter" I think of the depiction of the Battle of Hastings in the Bayeux Tapestry: the death wounds, the outpouring of blood, the lethal striking home of the Norman arrows are illustrated in the woven medium with such singular absence of realism that they seem peculiarly bloodless, and yet the actual deeds portrayed are terrible. The effect, inherent in the textile, is one of horror made the more sinister by its ambivalence. In the same way, in Ransom's poems the language and the tech nique work both to deny and to reveal the violence, so that one is never quite sure how to take it. John Crowe Ransom's poetry and the philosophy that</page><page sequence="17">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 599 underlies it are built upon a dualism. The poetry illustrates and embodies the conflicting claims of the ideal and the real, the spirit and the flesh. The poems are based on divisions, usually that of heart versus head. What worried Ransom was the intellectual effort to falsify the perilous balance that he considered Ufe to involve, by a too-strenuous assertion of the ideal, in the form of one variety or another of Platonic ab straction. In Poems About God the target is often the old traditional Protestantism of his upbringing, with what he considered its too-easy anthropomorphism and assurance of fulfillment the other side of the grave. In the years of the Fugitive, however, this particular form of idealistic evasion seemed no longer so worrisome to Ransom. His poems of the middle 1920s focus upon the social domestic scene, and what he insists upon is the compromised human situation, of life caught and defined between the polarities of body and soul, manners and human solitude. Perhaps the finest statement of the paradox comes in "The Equilibrists," which was first entitled "History of Two Simple Lovers." The man is tempted by the physical beauty of his beloved: "Full of her long white arms and milky skin / He had a thousand times remembered sin," the poem begins; but the affair cannot be consummated, for what she says is that to give in to their lust is wrong, and though he knows that if he disregards her plea, she will readily respond to his advances, he cannot bring himself to tempt her: "O such a little word is Honor, they feel! / But the grey word is between them cold as steel." What ensues is a "torture of equilibrium": They burned with fierce love always to come near, But Honor beat them back and kept them clear. The poet, dismayed, inquires what it is that is desired.</page><page sequence="18">600 THE WARY FUGITIVE "Would you ascend to Heaven and bodiless dwell? / Or take your bodies honorless to Hell?" He points out the ultimate contradiction lying in their predicament. To yield to the ideal, to obey the tenets of morality, is to deny the passion of life itself: In Heaven you have heard no marriage is, No white flesh tinder to your lecheries, Your male and female tissue sweetly shaped Sublimed away, and furious blood escaped. On the other hand, to give in to human desire, to heed only the requirements of passion, is to abandon oneself to a carnal appetite that can never be assuaged or mastered: Great lovers lie in Hell, the stubborn ones Infatuate of the flesh upon the bones; Stuprate, they rend each other when they kiss, The pieces kiss again, no end to this. This is the human predicament, the dualistic universe of flesh and spirit, feeling and thought, whereby neither the mind nor the body may be entirely conciliated, and which finds its conclusion only with death. Thus the "Epitaph" with which the poem concludes: the lovers lie "perilous and beautiful"? and apart in death as in life. Here lies the root of Ransom's fascination with death: the close, the conclusion, the only known answer to mortality. In poem after poem Ransom confronted this final realization, whether in pathos or wry humor. As he remarked of the dead matron in "Here Lies a Lady," But was she not lucky? In flowers and lace and mourning, In love and great honor we bade God rest her soul After six little spaces of chill, and six of burning.</page><page sequence="19">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 601 But though this perilous reconciliation-in-irreconciliation would remain at the center of Ransom's poetry throughout his career, in the poems of the late 1920s and the several written later there is a new emphasis that comes to the fore. We can see it emerging as early as "Armageddon" in 1923. This poem depicts the meeting of Christ and Satan at the battle that is to signify the end of the world. The two adver saries, together with their hosts, appear on the plain, ready for combat. Instead of commencing the fight, however, they take to fraternizing, and in one way or another most of the modern modifications and sweetenings of the old traditional gospel are reenacted by Christ during their newfound har mony. It is only after an old patriarch, A godly liege of old malignant brood, Who could not fathom the new brotherhood Between the children of the light and dark, makes known his dislike of the proceedings, that Christ is recalled to his mission. Whereupon he "shed unmannerly his devil's pelf, / Took ashes from the hearth and smeared him self," and roused his followers, who "with scourge . . . mortify their carnal selves," and "whet the ax-heads on the helves / And seek the Prince Beelzebub and minions." As the battle is readied, Christ and his followers sing "of death and glory and no complaisance," while the Antichrist and his armies make "songs of innocence and no bloodshed." As the battle grows imminent, The immortal Adversary shook his head: If now they fought too long, then he would famish; And if much blood was shed, why, he was squeamish: "These Armageddons weary me much," he said. It is a poem about religious orthodoxy, but now, instead of</page><page sequence="20">602 THE WARY FUGITIVE occupying himself with the logical inadequacy of the old Methodist theology that he had rejected, what Ransom was satirizing was the modern-day Social Gospel and the forces of rationalism and urbanity in the church, suggesting that what has resulted is a watering down of religious belief so that good and evil can no longer be distinguished. What we have, in short, is an extremely sophisticated, witty, ur bane poem written in advocacy of a return to That Old Time Religion, which, the poet suggests, in terms of its moral ordering at any rate, would be good enough for him. In another poem, "Antique Harvesters," first published in 1925, we see another and different manifestation of the same kind of impatience with modernity. Now it is the South that is involved. The locale is specifically identified: "Of the Missis sippi the bank sinister, and of the Ohio the bank sinister." It is harvest time in the South, and the prospects are not bounte ous; rather, the scene is one of decline, and those who as semble are old: "dry, grey, spare, / And mild as yellow air." Someone hears the creak of a "raven's funeral wing"; the thought is of death. This is hardly pleasing to the young men, who "would be joying in the song / Of passionate birds." But the old are not to be despised: Trust not but the old endure, and shall be older Than the scornful beholder. The harvesters begin the harvest: One spot has special yield? "On this spot stood Heroes and drenched it with their only blood." The talk is of the past, of tradition and causes cherished and lost, as is proper for old men. Then they pause, for a hunting party comes along. It is a very southern hunt portrayal; the</page><page sequence="21">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 603 hunters are of the rural South, and they straddle their bony horses, not chivalry itself but rustic archetypes of chivalry Confederate cavalrymen, perhaps, fallen on threadbare days but pursuing their ritual as of old. The rite is a communal ob servance that designs through repetition to commemorate and reaffirm. So is the harvesting ritual: "Resume, harvest ers," the speaker declares. What they harvest is a treasure of "full bronze / Which you will garner for the Lady." Time and mortality will soon take over: "Pluck fast, dreamers; prove as you amble slowly / Not less than men, not wholly." Thus the harvest takes on a religious significance, and the ritual is tribute to the Lady. Now the young men are to be instructed: "Bare the arm, dainty youths, bend the knees / Under bronze burdens," for it is only through all the seasons and stages of life that "you will have known / Your famous Lady's image." The young men must, that is, live and die in Dixie. There follows a pre cautionary admonition. If persons come and suggest that they will fare better in other areas, they must not give ear: "Angry as wasp-music be your cry then," and they are told what to retort: "Forsake the Proud Lady, of the heart of fire, The look of snow, to the praise of a dwindled choir, Song of degenerate specters that were men? The sons or the fathers shall keep her, worthy of What these have done in love." The young must continue to honor the tradition, for the South they serve is still very much alive, and has in no way ceased to be worthy of their fealty. It is true that the old men who have toiled for so long in her service have declined; but the speaker says, "Take no thought of her servitors that have drooped, / For we are nothing." If the South is thought to</page><page sequence="22">604 THE WARY FUGITIVE be diminished or other than it once was, if change and mor tality are what are to be considered, then this is no more and no less than the common lot everywhere: Why, the ribs of the earth subsist frail as a breath If but God wearieth. There is a crucial fusion of imagery in "Antique Harvest ers." The South is seen in terms of the land, and the tilling of the land is made into the garnering of treasure for our Lady? in other words, into a religious act. Identification with the South therefore constitutes identification with the religious attitude; the harvesting becomes a way of serving both the South and the Lord. It is as if the modern poet has dis covered a method whereby it becomes possible to recapture the fervor and faith and moral ordering of the old-time re ligious outlook, through a renewed concern with the South and its tradition. And the transaction is depicted as a ritual, complete with myth. For Ransom this is highly significant, for where ritual and myth are present, he wrote elsewhere, then art is possible. What we have here, it seems to me, set forth explicitly in "Antique Harvesters," is a strategy whereby through fealty to the southern land the old, forsaken communal ordering of religion is to be made possible, and this in turn will provide the ceremony of poetry. Just as the young Ralph Waldo Emerson had discovered in transcendentalism a way to re gain the emotional fervor and moral ordering of the old Cal vinism which was so wanting in the bland Boston Unitarian ism of his day, so now Ransom was discovering a path back to his own religious and social heritage. In the poem "An tique Harvesters" we have the prescription for III Take My Stand, in which a group of southern men of letters an nounced that the South, which had gone whoring after the</page><page sequence="23">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 605 strange gods of industrialism and modernism, must return to its old community heritage, forsake the modern urban doc trine of progress, and loyally defend a traditional rural way of life, in order to make possible the harmonious mannered society in which the fine arts and the arts of living alike flourish. He had come a long way from the young man who had once informed his father that rural fife stultifies moral ity and is baneful for art and religion. He had come back to his origins. IV It is John Ransom's poems that chiefly distinguish the quality of verse in the Fugitive. He was in his early thirties when the decision was made to publish a magazine, he was pre pared to come into his mature style, and the larger part of his most distinguished verse was first published in its pages. There is no doubt that it was Ransom whose personality and commitment provided the strongest and most pervasive influence in the Fugitive meetings. His influence on the younger Fugitives was decisive. Genial, good-humored, he was also a rigorous logician, and he thrived on debate. It was in such discussion and argumentation that he refined and honed the ideas that eventually became his critical essays. This habit was ingrained early in his life; when he and his father would discuss ideas at the dinner table, as apparently they often did, the dialogue often grew so emphatic that Ran som's mother would warn them to lower their voices lest the neighbors receive the false impression that they were quar reling. Ransom never lost his small-town, middle-class attitudes and interests. This is apparent not only in his poetry, which as we have seen centered usually on domestic situations, but in his life. He was an enthusiastic athlete and card player; 5</page><page sequence="24">606 THE WARY FUGITIVE he loved to play tennis and golf, and was a passionate sports fan. Ransom thrived on good company and good talle, and did not seek the company of scholars and writers in prefer ence to that of other kinds of citizens. For all his gregariousness and heartiness, however, there was a private quality to him, which one notices almost from the beginning, a recess of personality that never came out, and yet was very much a part of him. He liked to win, whether in discussion or in sports or in his career. He was extremely ambitious, though he kept it well under control and usually out of sight. None of the other Fugitives, no matter how friendly they were with Ransom, could ever dis cuss personal matters and motives frankly with him; there was always a kind of reserve about him which made him hold back his private thoughts. Along with this went a quality of mind that was a continu ing source of some puzzlement to even those who knew him best. He seemed to formulate his opinions and his ideas as the result of a rigorous reasoning process, and to use such a process to discipline and subjugate his emotions, so that he held not merely views but systematized intellectual positions, from which he could move by logic to cover his entire ex perience, and could order that experience with a consistency that was very important to him. We can see this trait at work early in his career, in the letters he wrote to his father about his decision to stay in the Northeast. Declaring that he be lieved rural life unproductive of moral development for its inhabitants, he proceeded to set forth formally in some de tail his definition of morality in order that he would not be misunderstood. We notice it again in the preface he wrote to Poems About God, in which he explains his decision to com pose the poems included in that book. Having written several poems in which the term God was used, he came to the con</page><page sequence="25">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 607 elusion that "this was the most poetic of all terms possible," and then "simply likened myself to a diligent apprentice and went to work to treat rather systematically a number of the occasions on which this term was in use with common Ameri can men." One doubts that the poems got themselves written in quite that way, though this is not to say that it was not entirely possible that Ransom thought that was what he was doing. In any event, whatever the process, it seems undeniable that Ransom's philosophical stance was no merely catch-as-catch can affair, but a highly sophisticated and logically developed position which, depending upon the form it took, might be extended into poetry, politics, society, philosophy, theology, or whatever and still reflect a consistent attitude. The dual istic base upon which Ransom erected his hypotheses and out of which he created his poetry is predicated upon the rival claims of the intellect and the feelings, the reason and the emotions, the idea and the fact. His definition of poetry is of a logical structure and a seeming textural "irrelevance" of language, which work against and upon each other to pro duce the unique artifact which is tibe poem, and which thereby, in the transaction between the idea and the image, produce a kind of suspended "miraculous" knowledge of the nature of reality, which is there not for use but for con templation. Discussing "The Future of Poetry" in the Fugitive for February 1924, he declared that "no art and no religion is possible until we make allowances, until we manage to keep quiet the enfant terrible of logic that plays havoc with the other faculties." This approach involves a kind of Arma geddon of its own: the contending forces of structure and texture, head and heart, meet and grapple with each other, and out of the combat comes a report from the battlefield, which is the poem, and which constitutes the peace settle</page><page sequence="26">608 THE WARY FUGITIVE ment. It was usually Ransom's habit to portray the forces of the head, which he was apt to term Platonizing, scientific, structural, abstract, predatory, as the aggressor in such a bat tle. In his brilliant essay of the 1930s "Poetry: A Note in Ontology" he presented the matter this way: "The aesthetic moment appears as a curious moment of suspension; between the Platonism in us, which is militant, always sciencing and devouring, and a starved inhibited aspiration towards inno cence which, if it could only be free, would like to respect and know the object as it might of its own accord reveal it self." Without attempting any kind of psychological inquiry, one is nonetheless impelled to point out that the author of that brilliant definition was a reasoner of the first magnitude, a rigorous conceptual thinker who moved toward his conclu sions with relentless logic. With Ransom it was never the flash of intuition, the sudden deduction that produces results, but the patient dialectical development. Louise Cowan's descrip tion of his strategy is apt: "What must be seen as underly ing all Ransom's critical thought is the formation, by abstrac tion, of some general notion of how things ought to be and then, later, the discovery, in an encounter with the actual world, that things are not after all quite so simple." All of which might seem a long way removed from the Methodist theology of his origins. But was it? In his later years he made an interesting observation. Discussing Cleanth Brooks's critical method of pouncing upon a paradox or an irony in a poem and of then proceeding "to wrestle as much of the poem as possible under it as the 'dominating' figure," he remarked that Brooks's dominating figure is likely to have philosophical or religious implications, and pronounced the method to be "homiletic." He went on to say that both he</page><page sequence="27">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 609 and Brooks, as the children of Methodist ministers, "equally had theology in our blood," and were accustomed to hearing sermons "where the preacher unpacked the whole burden of his theology from a single figurative phrase of Scripture taken out of context." The dialectic method Ransom used was not open-ended in its possibilities; he started out from strongly held moral, social, and ethical premises, and what he always moved toward, with masterful skill and subtlety of discrimi nation, was the restatement and reaffirmation of those prem ises in terms of the chosen context of the argument. Much of Ransom's philosophy and his aesthetics, as Thomas Daniel Young's recent essay "A Slow Fire" (Sewanee Review, au tumn 1973) reveals, was present, though in rudimentary form, from the beginning of his career. We find him, for ex ample, writing to his family from Oxford that he intended to "write an attempt at the analysis of morality and later a higher affair on the restatement and the relative importance, under the theory, of the conventional virtues." The conclu sion, be it noted, has already been reached; the writer's task is to work on the analysis that will produce it. Ransom once declared that he had never departed from the religion learned from his father at the turn of the century. Ransom's poetics aims to recapture the claim to knowledge of the world from the scientists and the abstract philosophers by claiming for poetry a more complete, more comprehensive reality, based not merely upon its logical structure but upon the recalcitrant and unique particularities of its texture. The poem, through the imaginative and creative clash of these opposing tendencies, provides the world's body?the "body and solid substance of the world" in which we live, the "ful ness of poetry, which is counterpart to the world's fulness." It is no accident that the product of this process is "miracu lous"?an entity that cannot be apprehended through its idea</page><page sequence="28">610 THE WARY FUGITIVE structure or its physical imagic texture alone. "Specifically, the miraculism arises," he declared, "when the poet discovers by analogy an identity between objects which is partial, though it should be considerable, and proceeds to an identifi cation which is complete." Then, significantly, he went on to assert that From the strict point of view of literary criticism it must be insisted that the miraculism which produces the hum blest conceit is the same miraculism which supplies to religions their substantive content. (This is said to assert the dignity not of the conceits but of the religions. ) It is the poet and nobody else who gives to the God a na ture, a form, faculties, and a history; to the God, most comprehensive of all terms, which, if there were no poetic impulse to actualize or "find" Him, would remain the driest and deadest among Platonic ideas, with all in tension sacrificed to infinite extension. The myths are conceits, born of metaphors. Religions are periodically produced by poets and destroyed by naturalists. Writing to his father from Connecticut to justify his wish to remain in the Northeast and live in a city rather than re turn to rural Tennessee, Ransom had put his case on moral grounds, declaring that rural life was unproductive of moral ity. He apologized then for seeming to be using the words artist and moralist interchangeably, and said that he was "not guilty of a mental lapse because I think the two fields are closely related." Throughout his career the identification of the artist and the moralist, of poetry and religion, was never dropped. It should be no surprise, therefore, to find him proclaiming in the uniqueness of the poem the affirmation of the world's body, the miraculism that actualizes the knowledge of God, and the creation of poetry as a religious act. What he has</page><page sequence="29">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 611 done, within the much broader and more sophisticated con text of his literary and philosophical studies, is to reaffirm the Tightness of the religious faith in which he was reared. He has, in effect, reasoned his reliance upon religious belief through poetic theory, in order to "quiet the enfant terrible" of a destructive logic. Not being a young man of the orthodox Methodism of the late nineteenth-century South, but a twentieth-century southerner educated at Vanderbilt and Oxford and unable to accept the kind of literal revealed Protestant theology he chides in his Poems About God, he has had to employ the logic of ontology and aesthetics to arrive at a justification for the religious impulse through poetry. V It is precisely this logical process which constitutes the book that Ransom published in 1930, God Without Thunder, subtitled "an unorthodox defense of orthodoxy," and dedi cated to his father. God Without Thunder is a complex, relentlessly reasoned book, which is principally concerned to demonstrate the in adequacy of scientific knowledge as an explanation of reality, the unconscious or hidden dependence of science upon extra scientific assumptions, the necessity of such assumptions? whether called myths or "universals" or "ghosts" or gods?for a true knowledge of nature and reality, and the error of Occi dental Christianity in its worship of Christ as Logos?the Law, the Word, the Idea?rather than its old belief in the supremacy of the Old Testament God of mystery and awe. He criticizes modern theology as so intimidated by the claims of science and rationality that it sanctifies these as God and removes from religion the sense of man's limitation and de</page><page sequence="30">612 THE WARY FUGITIVE pendence upon God, so that man becomes a god to himself. Only through the myth become Myth, the belief in a reality that is larger and greater than the demonstrable reality of science and of human reason, can men regain the condition of wonder and dependence, the belief in a supernatural God they can fear and love, and whose commandments will repre sent for them the deepest wisdom. Ransom's prescription, therefore, is a concerted and conscious return to orthodoxy: "With whatever religious institution a modern man may be connected, let him try to turn it back towards orthodoxy" he declared in conclusion, italicizing his words for emphasis: Let him insist on a virile and concrete God, and ac cept no Principle as a substitute. Let him restore to God the thunder. Let him resist the usurpation of the Godhead by the soft modern version of the Christ, and try to keep the Christ for what he professed to be: the Demigod who came to do honor to the God. Thus God Without Thunder, as it evolved in Ransom's mind, ultimately developed into a vigorous attack on the assumptions of science and a reaffirmation of the need for a supernaturalism. He had also become convinced that much of the discontent of modern society was the result of its apo theosis of science in its applied form, industrialism. Indus trialism was ruthless and brutal, degrading the dignity and enjoyment of labor, predatory in its nature, geared entirely toward producing more and more material goods as im personally and as rapidly as possible, for which new markets must be endlessly created. Under such conditions neither genuine religious faith nor aesthetic enjoyment is possible, for these are dependent upon a view of reality as ultimately mysterious, suprarational, a view that is not scientific and predatory but ritualistic and contemplative.</page><page sequence="31">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 613 If the city was the science-deified society personified, and if its industrialism was antireligious and antiaesthetic, then where was the community to be found which did not worship science? Where was the place where the religious and aes thetic sensibility might properly find its home? The answer, for Ransom, was apparent, and it became increasingly obvi ous during the late 1920s: the community of his origins, the South. But the region was changing; it was coming, par ticularly in cities like Nashville, to look and behave more and more like the urban Northeast. The task, therefore, was to recall the region to its senses and to imbue its lagging citizenry with a determination to resist such self-betrayal. The result was VU Take My Stand. It is this process, which we find more or less adumbrated in God Without Thunder, that the historian Frank Owsley doubtless had in mind when he suggested that Ransom had reasoned rather than felt himself into Agrarianism. This is quite true, provided we understand what is meant. It is not that Ransom's decision to defend the South was merely the result of a dialectical process whereby his search for a de fense of poetry led him toward the defense of the religious attitude. This in turn necessitated the dethronement of sci ence and therefore the urban community that applied science had created?all of which caused him to look with renewed fervor upon the South. That is undoubtedly the way he rea soned the thing out; but what we must not forget is that as we have seen, Ransom started out from some deeply ingrained premises. He intended, when young, to write a philosophical book defending the conventional virtues?i.e., those of the community in which he had grown up. The attachment to the South, which Ransom clearly associated with the kind of agricultural Protestant community in which his Methodist father had lived and worked, was always there.</page><page sequence="32">614 THE WARY FUGITIVE His poems of the Fugitive years are filled with the south ern domestic imagery that is his metier, and that imagery is drawn, like the subject matter of the early poetry, from the life around him. Clearly it is in particularities of southern ex perience that he found the stuff of his poems, and, as impor tantly, their meaning. One of his most significant poems is "Conrad in Twilight." An elderly man is seated in his garden in the autumn of the year. Someone?his wife, perhaps?urges him to come into the house, and he is reminded of his neu ralgia and other ills that will not be gentled by such exposure to the elements. "Conrad! you've forgotten asthma," she adds. Inside the house it will be comfortable and he will be safe from the elements, but he stays on in the mouldy garden nonetheless: Autumn days in our section Are the most used-up thing on earth (Or in the waters under the earth) Having no more color nor predilection Than cornstalks too wet for the fire, A ribbon rotting on the byre, A man's face as weathered as straw By the summer's flare and winter's flaw. He will not go into the house because he is aging, like the season, and because the garden is where he belongs for awhile, for he too is "used-up," and he can see in the declin ing garden a kind of reality, and the significance of his place in it, that the house with its thick red walls and blazing fire place contrives to hide from him. He is, insofar as he is a physical man, much like the abandoned cornstalks, the rib bon left from some outdoor occasion during the good weather; that at least is one aspect of the meaning of his life, which may not be left out of reckoning. He will go back into</page><page sequence="33">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 615 the house after a while; he is not merely a thing of nature, and he knows it very well; but for now he wishes to sit out side in the dying garden and think about the end of season, and in his own way symbolically take part in mortality. What is important is that in this poem, written in 1922, Ransom has chosen the southern rural scene as the imagery for what he wanted to say about life, time, and mortality. He found in the imagery the emblems that pronounce the mean ing, and he used the colloquial idiom of the region to express it: "the most used-up thing on earth"?"as weathered as straw." The idea, therefore, that Ransom's discovery of the virtues of the agrarian South was the outcome of a lengthy and open-ended logical process is misleading. The evidence of a poem such as "Conrad in Twilight" shows that what he thought and felt about religion, man in nature, abstraction, science, and aesthetics was already implicit in the way he looked at the southern scene, well before he completed the rational dialectical exploration that resulted in God Without Thunder and Agrarianism. To use a later term that Ransom adapted from Hegel, the concrete universal, the concrete im age was already there, and what he was engaged in doing in his dialectic was adducing the universality. He is not considered an "autobiographical" poet, and his poetics would appear to leave little room for first-person lyric self-justification. All the same it might be noted how often his poetry describes just such a cycle of early identification, then alienation, then ultimate reaffirmation as we have recog nized in his career. Very much to the point is a delightful poem, "Amphibious Crocodile," published in the last issue of the Fugitive in 1925, which Ransom perversely declined to include among his Selected Poems until he revised it for the third edition of 1969 and reprinted it under the title</page><page sequence="34">616 THE WARY FUGITIVE "Crocodile." It is pure vintage Ransom. The basic action de scribed resembles that of "Philomela," but has considerably more comedy. Robert Crocodile of the state of Florida arises from the water, cleanses his toes, acquires clothes, raincoat, overshoes, umbrella, becomes the social dandy. At length in grey spats he must cross the ocean. So this is Paris? Lafayette, we are here. Bring us sweet wines but none of your French beer. And ne weeps on Notre Dame with proper emotion. He visits the scene of the late war to observe the trenches, "all green slime and water." It is all Robert can do to keep from plunging in, such is his nostalgia. But he recovers his presence, journeys to England, and is presented to King George: Who is the gentleman whose teeth are so large? That is Mr. Crocodile the renowned aesthete. Once in Britain he tries English country sports, but does not ride well. When he rises to speak at the union ( as Ransom once did), he feels awkward and unlovely: "I wonder, says he, if I am the sort of creature / To live by projects, travel, affaires de coeur?" He meditates marriage, but decides against it. He considers high church, "sips of the Eucharist," then turns to Freud, and sets up as a psychoanalyst. He be comes the philosopher. The intellectual effort is difficult, however, and Robert Crocodile soon wearies of the necessity To whittle the tree of being to a point While the deep-sea urge cries Largo, and every joint Tingles with gross desire of lying at length. . . .</page><page sequence="35">LOUIS D. RUBIN, JR. 617 And such is his basic love and need for his primal element that one fine day the news appears in the fashionable literary reviews that the renowned Robert Crocodile has departed. He has disappeared; his friends cannot find him, his lady love writes in vain, he has gone home: Crocodile hangs his pretty clothes on a limb And lies with his fathers, and with his mothers too, And his brothers and sisters as it seems right to do; The family religion is good enough for him. We view him finally, at peace with the elements and with himself: Full length he lies and goes as water goes, He weeps for joy and welters in the flood, Floating he lies extended many a rood. And quite invisible but for the end of his nose. The poem has been proclaimed a satire on the American tourist, and perhaps it is; but I daresay that the tourist is satirizing the intellectual and social life of the 1920s. Ransom was not only on Robert Crocodile's side; he was, playfully, Robert Crocodile, and after a lengthy journey among the ad vanced literati and philosophers he has determined that "the family religion is good enough for him," at home in unmetro politan places with his kinfolk. "Amphibious Crocodile" is good fun, but the intellectual journey therein chronicled is one that Ransom himself made, and in the year 1925 he had pretty much come back home. Let him not deceive us, however; behind the playfulness and whimsy there was passion and steel. It was no sporting junket that he made, but one in which he was grappling with the most profound problems of life, career, and belief. He had a compulsion to make logical sense of himself and his</page><page sequence="36">618 THE WARY FUGITIVE experience. He was powerfully drawn toward logic and rea son, and he was also mightily attached to everyday middle class society and the old religious community. Unless we understand that Ransom's penchant for logical argumentation, his relentless dialectic, was in part at least a way of organizing and systematizing an intense emotional life, a method of discipline for his strenuous imagination, we will miss an essential truth about this very passionate man and poet. For Ransom, as those of his fellow Fugitives who have written about him all attest, was by no means the friendly avuncular man of reason that his genial manner and his courtly demeanor seemed to indicate; far from it. He did indeed have a formidable analytical mind; he took ideas very seriously, and his thinking was methodical and rigorous. He was, as Thomas Daniel Young writes, always willing to de bate almost any issue at any time; it was his way of thinking. But there was more to the man than the thought; the same mind that worked out the poetics and the theory wrote the poems. He insisted on poetry as a way of knowing the world, superior in its fulness of apprehension to the partial truths of science and philosophy; and there can be no doubt that he believed that because he perceived it thus for himself. Out of this amiable and unpretentious but ultimately very private and strong-willed man came some of the best poetry of the twentieth century, and also some provocative and creative thinking about poetry and society; and these were the prod uct of passion disciplined by logic and made formally felic itous by strategy. Ransom was no sweet reasoner; that was only his tactical method. He held strong convictions, felt emotions powerfully, and when he took his stand, he meant it.</page></plain_text>
