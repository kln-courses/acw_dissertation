<plain_text><page sequence="1">Personal Aspects of the Roman Theater. By CHARLES GARTON. Toronto: Hakkert, 1972. Pp. xv + 338 + 4 pls. $10.00. Long ago someone (T. B. L. Webster?) assigned Garton a useful task: to make a prosopography of Republican actors. G. set to work and in 1966 published an early collection (= SPh, LXIII [1966], 473-98). The most interesting Republican actor naturally was Q. Roscius Gallus, and G. gathered every crumb. From the crumbs he wished to make the cake, and what he ought to have done was a novel in the style of Beckers' Gallus entitled Roscius: Actor and Gentleman of Ancient Rome. Except for an unfortunate introductory chapter written to provide unity for what follows, and an anomalous Autour de Seneque (pp. 189-202), all have a latent concern with Roscius. Luscius is also from Lanuvium (p. 97). Sulla made Roscius a knight, then comes Roscius' Ballio, and the Rosciads. G. the Prosopograph was then told he must become G. the Literary Critic. We know from Hous- man how rarely they and Halley's Comet appear. G. obediently removed references (we now need Lodge to track down verses of Plautus), sprinkled in citations from other literatures to show he had read widely, added a dash of donnish whimsy (e.g., Plautinisches im Sulla, p. 158), and turned dusty articles into elegant essays. The result is that any scholar will read Von der Miuhll on Roscius in RE, while Mary Renault readers will still read Mary Renault. Is there anyone, ignorant of Greek and Latin, who cares about Luscius Lanuvinus' lost re- working of Menander's lost Phasma? On the other hand a scholar finds (p. 159): "he [Sulla] devised for himself the name Ep- aphroditos, and amid all that historians have written on this, I do not know that it has ever been asked what his actress friends from the demi-monde thought about it." Un- fortunately Roscius was cross-eyed; but still he was pretty, argues G., and triumphantly cites Catcher in the Rye: "His eyes . .. were slightly crossed . .. His face . .. of real beauty" (pp. 160-61). Why then against popular taste did Roscius reinstitute the use of masks (Cic. De or. 3. 221)? As to Roscius' being interested in you-know-what: "Now Catulus in all likelihood did not feel like this except for literary purposes" (p. 160). Another general criticism. To reprint the Kleine Schriften of a great scholar-Hermann, Welcker, Wilamowitz-is a noble and wel- come service. G. might be justified in reprinting an earlier article translated from Georgian or rescued from a Bulgarian Festschrift or even one on a vital subject of general interest. I see no reason to publish twice within months (pp. 73-92 = AJP, XCII [1971], 17-37) a recondite, wordy reconstruction of a lost Republican comedy available in English in almost the current issue of one of the most widely circulated American journals. It is unfair to contributors and editors with backlogs, and annoying to purchasers of the book and subscribers. A ho-hum article on Seneca I read first at PCA, LIV (1957), 22, then in an expanded form at CP, LIV (1959),1-9, is now reprinted (1972) on pages 189-202 of the book. There is no attempt to update the piece. The latest scholarship cited is still 1953. There is a general nod in the preface, but unlike honest editors of Kleine Schriften, G. never supplies pages and dates for his earlier publica- tion. Reading G. is like reading Nonius Mar- cellus. He has that impish delight in forgotten words: ruckles (p. 192), ruck (p. 219), calvity (p. 180), inspissate (p. 186; cf. inspissation, p. 43), pretermit (p. 11),</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 147 exodiary (p. 27), synagonist = colleague (p. 27), objurgated (p. 221), incumbition (p. 57), juniority = youth (p. 94). When G. uses a xerox machine, he "chafes the epithelium of his fingers" (p. 203). A whorehouse (p. 161) is "the demotic bower of venery." A grotesque page (p. 161) argues the obscene (see TLL III, 1571. 12 ff.) thesis that "the best symbol for the Sulla-Roscius friendship would be the leather bottlebag, . . . the culleus." At Plautus Pseud. 214, in a scene that Cicero says Roscius played, culleus occurs. And during the Sullan siege of Athens, surmises G., Athenians were "gnawing strips of bottlebag." At pages 73-92, G., opting for a Me- nandrean source, seeks to reconstruct Luscius' Thensaurus. More surely could be got from the one fragment (Ribbeck, p. 84, lines 1-2) that refers to hostilities between Athens and Rhodes and, if "quid tu scias" (Donatus ad Ter. Eun. 10, p. 115. 7 Karsten) is sound, within the lifetime of a character. One expects the war of 357-354 B.C. (RE, Suppl. V [1931], 775. 19 ff.) and a dramatic date of ca. 330 B.C. This fits Diphilos' Thesauros (for whom the war was a Begriff) more easily than his younger contemporary. The treat- ment of Phasma (pp. 93-129) yields little more than E. G. Turner at GRBS, X (1969), 307-24, although there is a rewriting of Donatus' prose summary in senarii at page 124 in the manner of Nauck. There are occasional good remarks in the Sulla chapter (pp. 141-67), reprinted from the obscure journal Phoenix (XVIII [1964], 137-56), e.g., Pompey's Theater as Sullan (p. 149), and the conscious preference of mime over tragedy by Sulla and Caesar for political reasons (pp. 145 and 303, n. 16). How Roscius acted Ballio (pp. 169-88) may be G. at his best. From Cicero's Pro Roscio we know that Roscius used to play (consuevit) Ballio in the Pseudolus. The Plautine script survives, and testimonia for Roscius' life, collected by Von der Miuhll, as well as ancient representations of pimps. From these G. creates, quite in the manner of Becker's Gallus or Charicles, a Roscian production, a Professorenroman. He is right on Ballio = Phallio, but might cite B. Snell, Scenes from Greek Drama (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1964), page 104, note 9 (= Szenen, p. 109, n. 10). What "the phallic moment in drama" (p. 173) is, I know not. At page 182 we play etymologies with prostitutes' names, e.g., Hedytium is "Sweetie- pie," Xystilis "Mlle Sweeptrain," and Phoe- nicium has a "name suggesting something like Scarlet." Surely a bordello customer reserving Phoenicium would think on lines of bOLVWKLIELV (Lucian Pseud. 28) or OLVMKILOV (Diog. Laert. 7. 3), a la mode Gartonne, "Miss Suckly" or "Mlle Blomee." But compare G.'s frightened treatment (pp. 106-107) of a "woeful vulgarism," viz. "to [have a sh-]." At page 147 we have the useful suggestion that Sorix "got his name from being beaky or shrewlike." G.'s use of archaeological evidence is naive and erratic, as when he cites "a mosaic mask from Delos which seems to bring us closest to the performance we are thinking of" (p. 179), or conjectures "It may even be that in a statuette from Myrina. . . we have the actual procurer of the lost Greek original of the Pseudolus" (p. 181). Cras credam. At pages 182-83 (cf. p. 161), we learn that because Cicero (Fam. 9. 22. 4) writes colei Lanuvii, "Lanuvine Roscius" especially en- joyed delivering Plautus Pseud. 214 (culleo). "Roscius had an opportunity to mention something probably familiar to him from his home town." Similarly Sarah Bernhardt, an Iowan, enjoyed delivering verses on corn. Further, G.'s translation ("I'll ... have you bundled over to the stew") misses the joke. At Pseud. 212 culleis are sacks for comes- tibles; at 214 culleo is the sack into which parricides were placed, and means a brutal punishment (see RE, IV [1901], 1747. 11 ff.). At Pseud. 292, print "Pietatem ergo istam am- plexator noctu pro Phoenicio," the deified anthropomorphic abstract. G.'s lower case, after Nixon's Loeb, wrecks the joke. Hirquina barba (Pseud. 967) elicits, besides a snapshot of a goat (PI. 3a), at page 187: "We have been waiting a long time for a goat-image to complement Ballio's phallicity of name... in this allusion to a hircus Plautus supplies</page><page sequence="3">148 BOOK REVIEWS the want." A patter of knowledgeable ap- plause ran through the audience. I found little in the Seneca chapter (pp. 189-202). A historical and analytical study of changes in critical approaches to dramatic characterization would be valuable indeed. The best way to see what a scholar is doing is to isolate his preconceptions. There is a long road between The Girlhood of Shake- speare's Heroines and Waldock's docu- mentary fallacy. On the other hand Aristophanes' critique of Euripidean women shows that L. Hermann's yardstick of vraisemblable (Aristotle's to eikos) is not anachronistic, while G.'s view that comedy and "loss of faith in the Olympian religion" were factors of importance to Seneca (p. 197) misses the mark. His contentions that "verbal philosophizing in Seneca. ... does not go much deeper than a thought colouring" and that "Seneca never allows philosophy to be discussed overtly" (p. 197) are simply untrue. His latest reference is twenty years old and he has no idea of drama in a totalitarian society. Agamemnon is "hankering for a love-scene with Cassandra" (p. 198). Has G. ever opened Seidensticker (1969)? Euripides' Medea appealed to Seneca "more than any other Greek play" (p. 200). Why more than Aeschylus' Agamemnon or Sophocles' Thyes- tes.? Rather Ovid's Medea, detectable for us through Heroides 12, captivated Seneca. There is the expected on rhetoric and rant ("Greek tragic characters seldom rant") and the bland conclusion (p. 202), "Seneca lacked the realizing vision of the individual." There was little reason thrice to have pub- lished these sentiments. In his last chapter (pp. 203-29), "The Rosciad Idea," G., translator of Latin school oratory of the Renaissance, joins with G. der Roscius-Verehrer to give us a rapid survey of a minor English genre (1750-1812), the critical piece-usually verse -on contemporary actors. The treatment is largely derivative from work listed at page 312, note 1. I suppose there is value in making one set of specialists known to another set; but I doubt that many readers of CP will find much of professional interest here. That actors' biographies had not been invented by the time of Roscius (p. 211) is not quite true. Surely a vita Aeschyli was available; and Aeschylus, like Shakespeare, considered himself as much an actor as a playwright. There is uncritical nalvete in the treatment of Roscius' life (sources regularly omitted). It is "doubtless true" (p. 211; cf. p. 164) that a snake crawled into the infant's cradle "for warmth." Pasiteles' representation (Cic. Div. 1. 79, with Winckel- mann's correction of Praxiteles), whether a silver statuette or relief is unsure (see Lippold, RE, XVIII [1949], 2087), provides no evidence for the historicity of the tale. More important is the presence of a nutrix during the emergency. Not only was Roscius the anomaly among actors in not being a slave, but his father, although probably a freedman (a status suggested by the cognomen Gallus), was considered to have been of sufficient wealth to own domestic slaves as well as field hands. I think the whole tale derives from Archias' encomium (see Pease ad loc. for the topos), and the poetic passage was illustrated by Pasiteles. The book ends quietly (p. 229) with Garton in Lanuvio asking a shopgirl if Roscius is a Begriff. He is not. Appendixes 1 and 2 are the registers of Republican and Augustan actors. Much information is collected and they will often be consulted. Garton ignores the incompe- tence of Mario Bonaria's notices in RE ("un travail d'une negligence presque incroyable," according to L. and J. Robert, Bull. epigr. [1969], p. 442, No. 142), an especially insidious practice because G. leans heavily on Bonaria's RE articles and three studies, and regularly dispenses with citation of ancient sources by referring to Bonaria. There are obvious errata at pages 43, 53, 195. WILLIAM M. CALDER III Columbia University</page></plain_text>
