<plain_text><page sequence="1">[ 79 ] SEPHER HAYIRAH. (Book of Religious Fear.) By Rabbi Jonah Gterundi. Translated into English with a commentary from a ms. in Trinity College Library, Dublin, Translator's Preface. Born in Gerona, Catalonia, c. 1200, Rabbi Jonah ben Abraham the Pious died in Toledo, November, 1263. He belonged to the best Jewish families in Gerona, for we know that he was a cousin of Nachmanides, one of the greatest Rabbis of the thirteenth century. R. Jonah occupies a niche in Jewish history on account of his participation in a famous controversy. He was one of the most prominent pupils of R. Solomon of Montpellier, the leader of the opponents of Maimonides' philosophical works, and was one of the signers of the ban (at the beginning of 1232) against all those who read Maimonides' philosophical compositions and occupied themselves with any studies except those of the Bible and the Talmud. The publication of a letter by the physician Hillel of Verona, who for three years attended the lectures of R. Jonah at Barcelona, throws some interesting light on the controversy. Hillel informs us that this man was the instigator of the public burning of Maimonides' writings by order of the authorities at Paris in 1233, but that he publicly repented of his opposition to Maimonides, and vowed a pilgrimage to Palestine to the grave of the offended scholar. He delayed the performance of his vow; but having eventually set out, he was detained on his passage through Toledo by the wish of some scholars</page><page sequence="2">80 SEP HER HAY 1U AH. who asked him to deliver his lectures. There he died; but the piety of Hillel towards so venerable and learned a man forbids him to describe the nature of the cause of his death. Its suddenness was attributed to his sin, for others who kept their vow were spared.1 R. Jonah was just as famous for his scholarship as for his saintliness and piety. He composed Novellae on most of the tractates of the Talmud, of which only a few have been preserved. Amongst his other works are Novellae to Alfasi's commentary on the Talmud (only those on Berachoth preserved) and commentaries on the Ethics of the Fathers and Proverbs. His fame, however, chieily rests on his moral and ascetic works, of which the Sepher Hayirah is one of the most popular. The manuscript (MS. B. 5. 27) in the T.C.D. Library is the basis of our English translation. It was presented to the Library by Bishop Robert Huntingdon (Provost of Trinity College, 1683-1692), who was appointed chaplain to the English " Turkey Merchants" at Aleppo, where he resided for over five years. During that time he collected a large number of Hebrew and Oriental MSS., the greater part of which were purchased by the Bodleian Library, Oxford. The manuscript is undated, but the scribe's name is given as Moses Mizrachi, who was a member of the Constantinople branch of the family, the other branch living in Jerusalem. He was probably a son of the Turkish Rabbi and mathematician, Elijah ben Abraham Mizrachi, who died in Constantinople, c. 1526. Further evidence that the MS. was written towards the latter half of the sixteenth century is the fact that appended to it is a poem by a contemporary of the scribe, Samuel Shullam, 1 Copy of this letter is found in an edition of previously unedited mss. entitled Taarn ZeTcenim by Eliezer Ashkenazi.

A work entitled Tratado del Timor Divino, by R. David Cohen de Lara, was believed by the early Hebrew biblio graphers to be a Spanish translation of the Sepher Hayirah. This view was held as late as 1781 by Rodrigues de Castro in his Biblioteca Espanola. It has, however, been conclusively shown that the work is a translation of a treatise "On the fear of God" contained in the work Reshith Chochma, by R. Elijah de Vidas. Selections from Sepher Hayirah. ... If guests come to his house he should ask them in with a friendly countenance.2 As soon as they enter he should set some food before them, for it often happens 2Cf. I. Abraham's Jewish Life in the Middle Ages, p. 158. "In the Middle Ages the treatment of poor Jewish travellers was considerate beyond description. Nothing might be done to put the poor guest to shame. In the Jewish Grace after Meals occurs the Psalmist's optimistic saying: 'I have been young and now am old; yet I have HltRMATHENAâ€”VOL. XXVII. G</page><page sequence="4">82 SEPHER HAYIRAH. that a poor man comes in (and goes away) without eating since he is too shy to ask. One should give them of his bread and water, all with a cheerful countenance3; nay, even if he is sad and low-spirited at heart, he should drive away his worries in their presence, comfort them with his conversation4 and be unto them like one who restores life. Moreover, even if he has a hundred men-servants and maid-servants, he, alone, should make the preparations5 and attend to them; for who is greater for us than the patriarch Abraham who waited upon the angels although he had many servants, and, notwithstanding all this, he attended to them, although he thought they were Arabs.6 according to our Sages of blessed memory. not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread' (PS. xxxvii. 25). This was said in a soft undertone, lest the poor guest seated at the table might be put to the blush." Indeed, the duties of hospitality occupy a very prominent position among the ethical teachings of the Rabbis. Some regard hospitality more highly than the reception given to the Divine Presence; others make it superior to visiting the house of study (Sabbath, 127 a). 3 It is the duty of the host to be cheerful during meals, and thus make his guests feel at home and comfortable at the table. Cf. Moral Poem of Hai Gaon (d. 1038), 11. 315-318. "Know that the little given cheerfully to the poor is better than that given with a scowl, bringing humiliation. In truth, the little which thou givest in a proper manner out of thy scanty means is better than that, given from a man's wealth.'' 4 Cf. Baba Bathra, 9 b. R. Isaac said: '' He who 'gives a farthing to a poor man is rewarded with six blessings; he, however, who encourages him is rewarded with eleven." 5 It is commendable that the host himself make the necessary preparations for the meal, thereby emulating the noble example of Abraham "who ran to the herd and fetched a calf" (Gen. xviii. 7). But when it is said that "he ran to the herd and fetched a calf," we must not understand him as descending to an office either menial or unbecoming his rank, since we are informed that the greatest prince of those countries is not ashamed to fetch a lamb from his herd and kill it, whilst the princess is impatient till she hath prepared her fire and kettle to dress it. See Shaw's Travels, p. 301. Cf. also Light's Travels in Egypt, p. 83, and Buckingham's Travels among the Arab Tribes, p. 15. 8 This incident is referred to in Baba Metsiah, 86 b: " Let a little</page><page sequence="5">SEP HER HAY I RAH. 83 And whatever he did by himself7 the Holy One, blessed be He, repaid to His descendants with His glory and by His own agency. One should not say to them, "Such and such befell me," nor should he tell them of his troubles because these stories break their spirits; it seems to them that what he is saying is meant for them, and thus the deed is robbed of all virtue. One should honour them as lords, and thus we find Abraham calling (his guests) "lords." Since their entertaining is greater than receiving the countenance of the " Shechinah" 8 during the meal he should appear worried that he cannot honour them and give them more, and thus it is said, "And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry" (Is. lviii. 10); say to him, " My soul goes out to you because I have nothing to give you." . . . Honour him as you would Rabban Gamliel,0 but still regard him as a robber. Next morning escort him water be taken and wash ye your feet" (Gen. xviii. 4). Said E. Janai ben Ishmael: '' The angels said to Abraham: ' Do you suspect us to be Arabs who bow themselves to the dust of their feet? Thou hast a son, Ishmael, who is doing so.' " 1 Abraham accompanied the ministering angels on their way (Gen. xviii. 16), so the All-present accompanied his descendants in the wilderness for forty years. With our father Abraham it is said, "I will fetch a morsel of bread*' (ib., 5), so the Holy One, blessed be He, caused manna to descend for forty years. With Abraham it is said, "Let a little water be fetched" (ib., 4), and the Holy One, blessed be He, caused a well to ascend for his offspring in the wilderness (Num. xxi. 17 f.), etc. (Mechilta, ad loo., 25 a; also Baba Bathra, 86 b). 8 This expression is used to avoid the anthropomorphism of '' seeing God.'' Of, Sabbath, 127 a. E. Judah said in the name of Eav: "Hospitality is even a greater merit than receiving the countenance of the 'Sheehinah,' as it is written, 'And he said, My lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away' " (Gen. xviii. 3) (showing that Abraham let the Lord wait while he went to receive his guests). See Heb. xiii. 2, where hospitality is placed on its proper level, and where allusion is made to the same Scripture text. 9 In treating of hospitality the Eabbis display the utmost tenderness and delicacy mixed with a delightful amount of shrewd knowledge of the world and quaint humour. Although it is prescribed that he is to G 2</page><page sequence="6">84 SEP HER HAY I RAH. after having given him a good meal, and consider that the wheel (of fortune) turns about in the worldâ€”to-day rich, to-morrow poverty-stricken and humiliated. " Even over a piece of bread a man can transgress" (Prov. xxviii. 21), for Jonathan, by not giving David a piece of bread on his departure, was indirectly the cause of the massacre of the priests of Nob. Finally, send him away with provisions in accordance with thy charitable hand. . . . Keep far away from oaths and from the sin of vows10 . . . Keep far away from laughter and from wrath, for he who breaks forth into anger11 disturbs his look pleased when, entertaining his guests, to wait upon them himself, to promise little and to give much, etc., at the same time it was caustically added: Consider all men as if they were robbers, but honour them as you would Rabban Gamliel. The source of this statement is in Derech Erets Rabbah, ch. v, where the following incident is narrated : R. Joshua once received a visitor. Having given him to eat and to drink, and provided him with a bed on the loft, he removed the ladder after his guest had mounted it and had gone to bed. In the night, the guest collected all the articles he could find, put them into his garment, and attempting to descend, fell down and broke his leg. "Raca," cried R. Joshua in the morning, "is that the way people !ike thee act? But we were on our guard." Hence R. Joshua ben Levi gave vent to the above saying. 10 To impose vows upon oneself was discouraged by the sages of the Mishnah and the Talmud. '' Do not form a habit of making vows,'' says an old "baraita" (Nedarim 20a). Samuel said: "He who makes a vow, even though he fulfil it, commits a sin (ibid., 22 a). The making of vows was tolerated only when it was done in order to rid oneself of bad habits, or in order to encourage oneself to do good; but even in such cases one should strive for the desired end without the aid of vows (Yore De'ah, 203, 207). In the Sepher Charedim, a devotional treatise by R. Eliezer Askari (16th cent.), our author is cited with reference to this maxim. 11 Wrong-doing can only result from the loss of self-control. Hence it was taught: "A man does not commit a transgression unless a spirit Of madness has entered into him" (Sotah, 3 a). Whatever therefore leads to a weakening of the control must be shunned. Two of the causes are indicated in the advice which Elijah was alleged to have given to a Rabbi: "Be not wrathful and thou wilt not sin; be not intoxicated and thou wilt not sin" (Berachoth, 29 b).</page><page sequence="7">SEPHER HAYIRAH. 85 mind and spirit and has not a clear mind for the love of the Creator. And thus our Sages of blessed memory said : " Be not wrathful and thou wilt not sin." "A hot tempered man achieves nothing but (the injurious effect) of his excitement." . . . One should not bring terror into his house12; it is a meritorious act to simulate anger whilst all the time his mind and spirit are composed within hmself. One should neither break vessels in anger nor destroy any thing,13 but one should conquer his inclination from all desires, even from indulging in idle chatter, for what advantage is there in unnecessary words except that they increase transgression ? . . . Do not cause a man's anger to linger in thee14; and do not retire to rest at night if thou hast had a dispute with a man, but rather go and seek his pardon until he is reconciled; and even if he did thee harm, do 11 This is one of Ben Sira's proverbs preserved in the Talmud. See Sir. iv. 32. 13 In Sabbath (105 b) there is a discussion amoflg the Rabbis as to whether the breaking of vessels is permitted when one is in a rage. Our author accepts the view of Rav Avin, who says: "Whoever tears his garments, breaks his vessels, or scatters his money in anger ought to be considered as an idolater. For that is the way of the evil imagination; to-day it tells him: Do this; to-morrow, Do that. At last it tells him to worship the stars and he does so." Rav Avin gave as Scripture authority the text (Ps. lxxxi. 9): " There shall no strange god be in thee-, neither shalt thou worship any strange god." What strange god is i/n the body of man? Assuredly, the evil imagination. Against this we have the opinion that the breaking of vessels is permitted when one wishes to appear as if enraged in order to command obedience (from his family). 14 One of the especial virtues practised by the Chasidim (Essenes) was to restrain anger and to show a mild temper. (See Josephus, B.J. ii. 8, Â§ 6; Philo, On the Virtuous Being Free, xii.) Especially significant is Eph. iv. 26: "Be ye angry and sin not; let not the sun go down on your wrath"â€”a teaching shown by Reseh (Agrapha, pp. 110, 210) to be taken from some Scripture based upon Ps. iv. 4. (Cf. Berachoth, 19 a.) Lud. Cappellus (jun.) in his Spicilegium post messem (Amst., 1657), cites our author on Eph. iv. 26, and Matt. v. 23, 24.</page><page sequence="8">86 SEPHER HAYIRAH. not say, "Lo, So-and-so did me harm, it is his duty to come and seek my pardon," 15 for in this (attitude) there is haughtiness of heart, as it is written, "Everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord" (Prov. xvi. 5). . . . Accustom thyself (to give) charity according to thy means16; at least pledge thyself to pay as an indem nification of thy life a fixed amount every week, a peruta (small coin) or a half peruta, for even the beggar who makes a livelihood from charity is in duty bound to practise charity. Clench not thy hand from lending to the poor man in time of need, for he who lends is greater than he who gives alms. ... Expose not thy fellow-man to shame in public; whoso puts his fellow-man to shame in public is considered as if he shed blood, seeing that the red colour (of the face) disappears and the white takes its place, and thereby the former has no portion in the world to come. It were better for a man to cast himself into the midst of a fiery furnace rather than cause the face of his fellow-man to 15 Difficulties occurring. between individuals are inevitable in any community. To ensure that such quarrels are quickly ended so that harmony should reign in the community, the Eabbis recommended that the party who is in the wrong should be eager to admit his fault and beg the pardon of the person whom he has offended. Cf. Practical Philosophy of the Muhammedan People, being a translation of the Ahhlak-i-Jalaly (15th cent.), Sect, viii, p. 1'95 (Thompson). 16 Conspicuous among the features which distinguish the moral life is the eager desire to be as helpful as possible to those in need. Jews at all times and in all climes have been renowned for their charitable deeds. The following passage is one of the many tributes paid to Jews in this respect. The Christian divine, Basnage, writes: "This nation's charity is very remarkable, since Julian the Apostate proposed them as well as the Christians, as an example to the idolaters, to oblige them to suffer no beggar amongst them. There are in considerable cities many fraternities, one of which is charged with, the collection of alms for the shame-faced poor; another collects for the redemption of captives; a third provides a portion for poor maids." Histovre des Juifs, Bk. v, Ch. xvi, Â§ 7 (Taylor). See also I. Abrahams, Jewish Life in the Middle Ages, pp. 324 ff., for the organisation of charitable institutions in Jewish communities during the thirteenth century.</page><page sequence="9">SEP HER HAY IB AH. S7 blanch in public17; but if thou didst admonish a man in secret several times and he hearkened not, it is permitted to put him to shame, to hate him and to annoy him until he receives correction. He who has the opportunity to admonish and does not do so,18 sinneth; but if he did admonish, then he hath delivered his own soul (cf. Ezek. xxxiii. 9). Be careful in the honour due to thy wife in accordance with the words of our Sages of blessed memory, " He should love his wife even as he loves himself and accord her honourable treatment to an even greater degree than he would expect for himself19; for it is enough for thee that she rears thy children and preserves thee from sin." One should be careful not to wound his wife's feelings, for her tears come easily and the gates through which her tears pass are never shut!20 Engage not in much gossip with her.21 This applies 11 Cf. Berachoth, 43 b: "Whence is this derived? From Tamar; as it is said, When, she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying: 'By the man, whose these are, am I with child'; and she said, 'Discern, X pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff' " (Gen. xxxviii. 25). I.e., at the risk of being burned alive she would not name her seducer, but merely hinted at the party, so that, if he felt inclined to do so, he could confess and save her. 18 Cf. Berachoth, 31a: " And Eli said to her: ' How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee' (1 Sam. i. 14)â€”R. Eleazar said: Hence if one sees in his neighbour anything unseemly, he must rebuke him." 19 See Chullin, 84 b; Yebamoth, 62 b; Sanhedrin, 76 b. Lud. Cappellus on Eph. v. 28 quotes this passage of our author. In the ethical will of Eleazar, the Levite, died Mayence 1357, occurs the following: "My daughters must respect their husbands exceedingly and they must be amiable to them.; husbands must honour their wives more than themselves" (Jewish Quarterly Review, iii, p. 462). 20 Cf. Baba Metsiah, 5&amp; a: R. Eleazar said : " Since the destruction of the Temple the 'gates of prayer are closed, as it is written, 'Also when I cry aloud and make entreaty, he shutteth out my prayer' (Lam. iii. 8). However, the gates of tears are never closed, as it is written, 'Be not silent at my tears' " (Ps. xxxix. 13). 21 As a safeguard to morality man was strictly enjoined to avoid anything which might excite his passion.</page><page sequence="10">88 SEP HER HAY I RAH. even to one's own wife; how much more then to the wife of one's neighbour? What is much gossip? For instance, once (R. Jose the Galilean) asked Beruriah (wife of R. Meir) : On which road shall we walk to Lydda? Foolish Galilean! said she, thou shouldest have said: Whereon to Lydda? ... A religious act which has no devotees, devote thyself to it22; let it not be light in thine eyes to fulfil a slight religious act or to transgress a minor transgression, for "Her ways are unstable (and) thou canst not know them" (Prov. v. 6). Leave not off from doing a religious act either through fear of pecuniary loss or bodily punish ment, for the fulfilment of a religious act is competent to preserve thee from any harm, and if (God forfend!) any harm did befall thee, thy employer (God) is to be relied upon to make good the loss which thou didst incur through the fulfilment thereof. . . . Guard thyself against inflicting pain on animate creatures, even an animal, beast or bird23; all the more (is it forbidden) to inflict pain on a human being who is 22 Sohechter in The Rabbinical Conception of Holiness, J.Q.R., x. p. 8, writes: The characteristic of the Chasid is that he does not wait for a distinct commandment. He endeavours to be pleasant to his Maker, and like a good son studies his father's will, inferring from the explicit wishes of the father the direction in which he is likely to give him joy. Hence the tendency of the Chasid to devote himself with more zeal and self-sacrifice to one law and group of laws than to others, just according to the particular bend of his mind, and his individual conception of the will of his father. Thus R. Judah perceives the things of Chasiduth 'in paying particular attention to the tractates "Nezikin," (Damages, including the laws regarding the returning of lost 'goods, prohibition of usury, etc.), and in avoiding anything which might result in doing injury to a fellow-man.' " The Bible contains no comprehensive principle regarding the rights of animals. Still in the legislative portions of the Bible there are many laws concerning the rights of dumb creatures; so many, in fact, as to justify the assumption of the Rabbis that cruelty to animals is a Biblical interdiction (see Baba Metsiah, 32 b). Moreover, the Jewish law not only forbids cruelty but also enjoins kindness to animals (see Dr. A. Cohen, Everyman's Talmud, J viii, p. 249).</page><page sequence="11">SEPHER HAYIRAH. 89 formed in the divine semblance. If thou desirest to hire labourers and hast found poor men, let them be members of thy household, only do not insult them but give them their instructions in a respectful manner; pay them their full wages and do not put them off by telling them to come again, for there are many negative commands in the matter, and unto Him doth he (the labourer) lift up his soul.24 ... If thou wast appointed president of the con gregation, do not lord it over them25; do not intimidate them when it is not for a worthy motive; bear their troubles, for great is the reward of the leaders of the generation. If thou art hired to teach " Torah," be careful not to do any other work during the lesson, for in an instant thy companions can make a mistake which thou wilt not hear, and is not thy labour a divine labour, as it is written : " Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully"? (Jer. xlviii. 10). (It is forbidden) even to answer or converse with any man, but rather take a lesson from Abba Chilkiah26; of blessed memory. 24 To delay the payment of wages after the allotted time is unanimously condemned by the Rabbis. In Sifre, 123 b, and Baba Metsiah, 123 b, the Rabbis speak to the employers of workmen as follows: '' This poor man ascends the highest scaffoldings, climbs the highest trees. For what purpose does he expose himself to such dangers, if not for the purpose of earning his living? Be careful not to oppress him in his wages for it means his very life.'' 25Cf. Yoma, 22b: "We should appoint chief of a congregation only one behind whom hangs a mass of reptiles (i.e., to whose ancestry some blemish is attached), so that, when he becomes overbearing, we can say to him: look behind thee.'' See also Cha'gigah, 5 b, and Pesachim, 113 b. 2' The following incident is related in Taanith (23 a, b): Once, at a time of drought, the Rabbis sent to Abba Chilkiah, the grandson of Onias the Circle-drawer, a deputation of two scholars with the request that he should pray for rain. They went to his house but did not find him there. They proceeded to the field and found him ploughing the ground. They greeted him but he took no notice of them. On his return home they asked him why he had ignored their salutation. He replied: "I hired myself out for the day, so I was of the opinion that</page><page sequence="12">90 SEPHEB HAYIRAH. . . . Call no man by a nickname,27 i.e., by a substitute of his name, even in his absence or even to make known to another the person (of whom they are speaking), but rather be vague by saying, A. the son of B. or from the city C. until he is recognised. Call no Israelite by any contemptuous name; (it is forbidden) even to call a minor "despicable" by way of a joke, for all are pure and holy. Extol no Gentile for his beauty, grace or deeds, and when thou seest a Gentile doing good deeds or practising charity (to Jews), be mindful of the fact that "the kindness of the nations is harmful to Israel" (cf. Prov. xiv. 34).28 I had no right to interrupt my work." On Abba Chilkiah see also J.Q.R., iii. p. 571. 21 Of. Taanith, 20 b; Megillah, 28 a; Baba Metsiah, 58 b. R. Jochanan ben Zakkai was asked by his disciples by what means he had secured length of days (he was a disciple of Hillel and survived the destruction of Jerusalem). He replied: "I have never called any man by a nick name. '' 25 The views of the Rabbis concerning Gentiles were influenced largely by their own personal temper and the conditions of their age. Bitter experience sometimes found expression in a harsh utterance. Our author's reference to Gentiles is probably directed against the ruling powers in Spain and throws some light on the status of the Jews in the thirteenth century. The protection which emperor and empire were supposed to guarantee to the bond-servants of the Treasury was often illusory, even when privileges were granted to them; they remained substantially without rights. The government in reality only interfered when self-interest demanded that men who were so useful and profitable in many ways, should not be permitted to be entirely ruined. In other respects every man's hand from the King downward through all classes even to the common people was against them. Our author might also be referring to the fact that James T of Aragon treated the Jews kindly although he persecuted the Albigense3. The tender treatment of the Jews by the King was due to the advice of his confessor, Ramon de Penafort, who recommended mild measures as the most effectual means of converting them. See Summae, lib. i, "de Judaeis et Sarracenis," Â§ 2. "debent autem .... tam Judaei quam Sarraceni auctoritatibus rationibus et blandimentis potius quam asperitatibus, ad fidem Christianam de novo suscipiendam provocari; non autem compelli quia coacta servitia non placent Deo."
