<plain_text><page sequence="1">On Teaching The Abandoned Baobab: A Senegalese Woman's Autobiography Marilyn Slutzky Zucker Preface: My Paper's Pedagogical Prehistory While preparing this paper, I had a conversation that would resonate with issues integral to my discussion of teaching Ken Bugul's The Abandoned Baobab. I telephoned a friend, an expert in African litera- ture, for some conversation and perhaps guidance as I began my pre- liminary layout of the paper's terrain. I mentioned to her that I was working on a piece about a Senegalese woman's autobiography and that my approach would be pedagogical rather than the more usual theoretical perspective of literary papers; thus, our talk turned to teaching African literature. She asked how I might approach Ken Bugul's story in the classroom and I answered, "much as I approach other texts. I usually offer some contextualizing information - a bit of the life of the author, conditions of the writing of the book (if known), and something of the world that gave rise to the text and that the text expresses. Then, I would jump right in and ask students to read, respond to, and question The Abandoned Baobab and, from the discus- sion generated in class, develop a matrix of understanding about the text and the worldview it both reflects and creates." "Well and good," my colleague said. "However, African texts require tremendous con- textual grounding and students are put off by doing additional read- ing and research." "What does this mean in terms of your own classroom situation," I asked. She answered that it meant "much frus- tration, for although students don't like to be bogged down with his- torical detail even before beginning reading, we cannot divorce the text from its political context and thus are obliged to supply historical information. How will you handle that if you just start reading?" I could hear beginning in our conversation echoes of the current debate between postmodern critics, who, in focusing on the intrinsic work- ings of texts, seem to divorce the texts from their embedding contexts, and voices that will play no part, be no accomplice in suppressing/eras- ing the specific parameters of identity and culture from their discourses. 121</page><page sequence="2">122 Women 's Studies Quarterly 1 997: 3 &amp;f 4 We were on the verge of tossing rhetoric at one another, about to become, as Barbara Christian notes, "fixed in essence" as we were refuting essence (50). "We're getting caught," I said, "both of us" and went on to suggest that we find a way to talk to each other about this, to renegotiate these seemingly exclusionary constructs, which were making it difficult for us to hear one another on this subject, "^es," she said. "I hear that too" and affirmed a desire to demonstrate in both our critical approaches to texts and in the model of community enacted in our classrooms the very possibilities of reconstructing culture to support the multiple manifestations of human beingness. "So how," she wondered, "do you approach texts that you know little about to start with, yet remain con- nected to cultural context?" I said that I felt that the goal of my teaching was to better prepare students to read, decipher, and negotiate for themselves their place in the world, a goal that transcended the particularities of any single text but that was knowable only through the particularities of any single text. Yes, I admitted, I "did" close textual analysis but agreed with Roland Barthes that such an approach generated from an impulse to "stimulate social criticism." I thought we should be teaching the decon- struction of stereotypes, in Barthes's sense of the word, "triumphs of artifice which it [society] then consumes as innate meanings, i.e. tri- umphs of nature"(ll), whether they are the more readily recognizable stereotypes such as those surrounding discussions of race and class, ethnicity and gender, to name a few, or the more subtle stereotypes of received culture, such as habits of thinking or of making narrative, con- ventions of reading, assumptions of metaphor, notions of causality. Here, I waxed, was the great power of the study of literary texts to inspire stu- dents to understand and perhaps mitigate the cultural constructs that enable or imperil their well-being and the well-being of their com- munities. "You are certainly getting excited about this," my friend said . . . and through her, I heard my own tone and wondered where my ardor was coming from. I suddenly understood that I had been feel- ing like my students might feel - not quite up to the task of making public, written conclusions in a field of study in which I was not expert, intimidated away from my own resources by some undefined author- ity. My ardor was the energy of my own presence in the dialogue, hav- ing navigated with my colleague not the waters of African literature, which I had thought was the subject of conversation, but my own loca- tion in relation to the field. We recognized that we had accomplished something; we'd managed to dismantle in the local instance of our phone exchange the kind of</page><page sequence="3">Women 's Studies Quarterly 1 997: 3 &amp; 4 123 rhetorical posturing that threatens our students with the inability to hear one another, to communicate beyond the borders of their already well-shaped conceptual frameworks. I knew then that I could write this paper only as myself - a good "reader of signs" with some experience teaching and writing on African texts though not what my colleagues would call an "authority" in the content area. My authority in writing this piece would come from finding and using my own voice in rela- tion to the text, just as I guide my students to do. The paper, then, has four parts: first, the prehistory given above; sec- ond, a brief layout of the field of autobiography to prepare a context in which we may begin reading The Abandoned Baobab; third, a close reading of the book's first section, analyzing some stylistic features that carry Bugul's worldview through the actual workings of the text; and finally, a short section on a student autobiography project and a read- ing list of African women's life-story writings that offer a rich course of study. A Brief Layout of the Field of Autobiography A complex genre from the theoretical point of view, autobiography is a natural genre to approach in the classroom. The very issues at the heart of autobiography's narrative complexity, which project the onto- logical complexity of self-(re)presentation, might sound obscure to students if approached conceptually and in the kind of language dis- played in this very sentence. Yet our students already know a great deal about autobiography. They are themselves involved in and generally aware of a process of self-discovery and self-definition. They have some consciousness of the way family dynamics, economic conditions, social expectations, race, gender, and inborn characteristics and talents insin- uate themselves into their assessments of and attitudes about their developing selves-in-the-world. Students' awareness of an ongoing and changing interrelationship between the individual and the commu- nal, the personal and the public in their own lives gives them easy access to Ken Bugul's search for a nourishing sense of identity in a landscape of instability, alienation, and loss. They will find etched into the pages of her book an extraordinary yet ordinary story as Bugul redeems from anonymity and silence the suffering of her lived life, cre- ating herself as speaking/autobiographic subject in and by the very act of writing. Until recently, an autobiography such as Bugul's would likely not have been written or, if written, likely not published or, if published, likely not read/studied. The genre had confined itself, indeed was</page><page sequence="4">124 Women 's Studies Quarterly 1997: 3 &amp; 4 defined "traditionally" - that is, by mainstream Western literary con- ventions - to include primarily the self-representations of lives thought worthy of putting into print. These were lives invested with cultural val- idation, recognition, and reward, projecting the unique, autonomous identity that had been posited as the model of selfhood.1 College read- ing lists reflected that definition, offering for study autobiographies of St. Augustine, Rousseau, Benjamin Franklin, Walt Whitman, and Henry Adams, whose life story as "a representative of his time, a mir- ror of his era" would come to describe the scope of the genre. These autobiographical writings were by men who saw themselves at the cen- ter of historical and cultural forces, as elect exemplars of "the right life" with an inherent entitlement to speak and the expectation that others would certainly want to listen. However, the highly individualistic notion of self that characterized the field of autobiography excludes those for whom self, self-creation, and self-consciousness emerge differently - among them, many non- Western people, people of color and varying ethnicities, and women (Friedman 34) . Rather than developing the "authorized" construct of singular identity, the self presented in many women's life stories, for example, shares the spotlight with an "other," as Mary Mason notes - be it person, place, community, idea, ideal, or language itself - in rela- tion with whom or which the sense of selfhood evolves. Whether the form of these life stories appears as interactive writings (letters, con- versations, public testimonials) or solitary musings (journals, diaries, private reflections) , as bodies of poetry or fictionalized life-narratives, the "grounding of identity through relation with a chosen other, seems ... to enable women to write openly about themselves" (Mason 22). For many black women, the "chosen other" is the community - its locale, values, people, institutions, language. One has only to read Passbook Number F.47 927, Muthoni Likimani's life story, in relation to the history of the Mau Mau resistance to colonial tyranny in Kenya; or read Call Me Woman, Ellen Kuzwayo's life story, which is interwoven with what Bessie Head has called "the true history of the land" of South Africa (Kuzwayo xiii); or read A Small Place, Jamaica Kincaid's geo-auto- biography of self-and-Antigua, to understand Bernice Johnson Reagon's comment on the relation of women to national identity: "In most societies, it is from women that you get the most consistent con- cept of nationhood of any people." Reagon continues and speaks specifically about what she sees as a major constituent of black women's identity formation: "We are, at the base of our identities, nationalists" (81). Yet Carol Boyce Davies asks, "as a number of feminist scholars are</page><page sequence="5">Women 's Studies Quarterly 1 997: 3 &amp;4 125 beginning to do, if the concept of 'nation' has not been a male for- mulation" (12). Like the model of individual identity we have theo- rized as male, nationalism, a collective identity connected to place, also "favors singleness - one identity, one growth pattern, one birth and blood for all" (Boehmer 7). This totalizing vision of nation itself raises questions for those whose selves are constructed in oppositional, mar- ginalized, or unharmonious relations to its patriarchal/patriotic struc- tures and authorities - to what I call its "cultural patrix." In the extreme expressions of nationalism - war arid colonization - the prevailing power generates rules, codes, and values for itself and for the defined 'other,' setting all terms of behavior and self-identification. For the col- onized, "in other words, [for] every people in whose soul an inferior- ity complex has been created by the death and burial of its local cultural originality" (Fanon 18), the site of cultural usurpation is native turf, turning "home" into a locus of alienation and displacement. In Bugul's story, the narratives of nation and of personal identity are interwoven as Reagon suggests but also completely at odds. Multiply dislocated from any sense of comforting identification, Bugul puts into high relief the illusion of "safety based on the exclusion of specific histories of repression and resistance," and negotiates what Biddy Martin and Chandra Mohan ty call the "problematics of home" (196) . Bugul was not at home at home, for home was not, and is not, at home with itself. Alienated from even the "home" of her own lan- guage, her sense of the familiar shattered with the sound of the first French letter the teacher pro- nounced and wrote on the blackboard: i. That brief and also very abrupt sound cracked my cheeks when I pronounced it, almost screaming. . . . The sound of the i scared the birds who used to sing all day long among the leaves. The termites chose to build their hills elsewhere. (98) 2 The friendly voices of her African landscape flee, leaving the oppres- sor's language in her own mouth. That language carries one vision of culture and of nation, which provides no nourishing framework for Bugul's developing sense of self.3 Women's relation to "nation" and its possibility as uncontested cul- tural homeland may be sorely called into question by colonizing ide- ologies and languages, such as those that brought French power to Bugul's Senegal and European power to all corners of the world.4 These ideologies often relied on metaphorizing the colonized nation as "female," as Susheila Nasta notes, "requiring 'paternal governance'</page><page sequence="6">1 26 Women 's Studies Quarterly 1997: 3 &amp; 4 by the dominant power" (xiii) . But some of the "resistant" frameworks that evolved in opposition to colonial governance also used the lan- guage of symbolic female idealization/dependency, challenging women's abilities to take their active and vocal places in developing nationalist movements. While offering a unifying counter-identity to the devalued "other" of colonized nations, many male political lead- ers and writers of these emerging nationalisms revisioned the female- suppressing aspects of the colonizers' master narrative of radical "othering." Leopold Sedar Senghor, the first president of Senegal and the founder of the Negritude movement, himself played a central role in what Florence Stratton calls "the feminization of Africa" and "pre- pared the way for post-independence male governance" (51) as the neocolonial "other" emerged as feminine.5 Davies comments on the disjuncture between the cultural imaging of women and the actual condition of women's lives: "The feminine was deployed at the sym- bolic level, as in 'Mother Africa' or 'Mother India' and women func- tioned as primary workers for a number of nationalist struggles but ended up not being empowered political figures or equal partners" (12). The "Mother Africa" trope specifically, Stratton notes, "masks the subordination of woman" (55) . As more tersely put by Elleke Boehmer, "Mother Africa may have been declared free but the mothers of Africa remained manifestly oppressed" (7) . Ken Bugul would wrestle with this paradox, fleeing both "Mother Africa" and her African mother - "I rejected the mother by my Western references" (124) - leaving herself bereft of all attachment.6 The difficult relation of women to the concept "nation" was noted early by Virginia Woolf in her pacifist novel-essay Three Guineas, which locates women outside of any nationalist/patriotic efforts: "As a woman I have no country. As a woman I want no country" (125) . But Woolf 's relation to her own country was less complicated than Ken Bugul's, whose self was multiply marginalized, "othered" in many and complex ways - as an African living in her "colonized" homeland; as an African living in Europe; as a black woman in white Belgian culture; as a child speaking an indigenous language becoming a French-speaking ado- lescent in a traditional African village; as a woman in the male-driven world of art and politics; as a woman writer in a male-dominated lit- erary tradition. Impelled to seek her own fulfilling sense of identity, Bugul embarks on the journey of what Carol Boyce Davies calls the "migrating subjectivity" of black women - a moving through and across the discrete borders of prevailing cultural models of selfhood "to con- struct new worlds born of resistance" (102). The migration relates, of course, to geography, which Davies notes is "linked deliberately to cul-</page><page sequence="7">Women s Studies Quarterly 1 997: 3&amp;4 127 ture, language, the ability to hear and a variety of modes of articula- tion" (20). But, she continues, this migration is "not solely a question of physical geography but of location or subject position in their wider senses in terms of race, class, gender, sexuality, access, education, and so on"; it is the "where one speaks from and who is able to understand . . . that gives actuality to one's expressions" (20) . I believe Davies's con- cept is extremely useful in providing a way to break the death grip of dualistic thinking, which, even when empowering "the other" in dis- courses of identity politics, still fosters exclusionary imaginings: who is "in" and who is "out." The idea of "migrating subjectivity" helps us to understand and, if we are able and dare, to construct selfhoods rooted in the specifics of our historical, geographic, psychological real- ities but with the promise of not being constrained or defined entirely by any of them. Bugul migrates to the no-woman's land of Europe, where all culturally generated markers of self-value conspire, whatever the polarities, to afflict her sense of self with idealized or disparaged conclusions. She returns finally to Senegal to acknowledge the loss that has shaped her anguished life, to mourn that loss, and to begin recon- structing Africa as liberating concept and nourishing reality. A Close Reading: The Abandoned Baobab My discussion turns now to the text itself. I apply some basic questions as I was taught to do by Sallie Sears, great literary mind, inspiring teacher, and fearless challenger of cultural convention. Moving in a linear fashion through the pages of the book's first chapter with ref- erences to latter portions of the text, the interrogation focuses on the style, language, and techniques of the storytelling through which the text's worldview speaks itself. I've highlighted as headings questions that can frame classroom discussions and homework assignments, and I've put into bold type those literary features or topics that suggest fur- ther analysis and exploration, depending upon the particular exper- tise of the teacher and the interests of the students. My notations may function as hypertextual associations, radiating interest lines from the text outward to related subjects and contexts. Does the book cover tell us anything of the story? Since the presentation of identity seems central to autobiography, what do we make of the book's "identity": its jacket with photo, title, author name, and explanatory blurb. The English title translates the original French title, Le Baobab fou, as The Abandoned Baobab, replacing the more</page><page sequence="8">128 Women 5 Studies Quarterly 1 997: 3 &amp; 4 accurate translation of the French word/ow, crazy or mad, with "aban- doned" - a passive post-Freudian adjective replaces an active one. The turn of one word deprives the title's subject - baobab - of the vital, deranged agency expressed by the original title. "Ken Bugul," the book jacket says "is a pseudonym," literally, a false name. The name, mean- ing "the person no one wants" in Wolof, we are told, was adopted by Marietou M'Baye for the French language release of her book on the "advice of her publisher . . . who feared scandal in Senegal because of the book's sexual disclosures." (One wonders if the choice of name itself was hers or one made on the "advice of her publishers.") The cover, then, displays several of the book's central issues: language, gen- der, sexuality, and identity - all subsumed by the larger issue of colo- nialism. That the entire project of renaming the author was urged by the publisher indicates a (neocolonial?) appropriation of the writer's much sought-after sense of positive identity, which constitutes the very subject of her difficult story. That Marietou M'Baye has a French- inflected name to start with and not a Wolof name displays Senegal's colonial history.7 That the Wolof name becomes the "false name" calls into question the notion of authentic or original identity: Who is the author "really," and is this question an answerable one? That the Wolof name "speaks the story" of this particular text (of the writer "wanted" by neither French nor African culture) may "misname" the author for her subsequent writings, should they tell stories of greater confidence and self-assurance.8 And finally, that the name change protects the author from sexual scandal points to the intense monitoring of female sexuality in Senegal and some involvement in that monitoring by Nouvelles Editions Africaines. One wonders if a male author telling a similar story of bodily and spiritual dislocation would have needed to change his name. Thus we read on the cover of this book the very con- temporary politics of publishing, which include the specific risks Ken Bugul takes to write her story, the difficulty in bringing to public view her work and the work of other African women writers and the ongo- ing struggle for African women's writing to receive appropriate criti- cal attention.9 We can tell something of this book by its cover. The book opens with a chapter entitled "Ken's Prehistory," which provides an historic/familial genealogy and background to Ken's emer- gence into the world.10 What is the effect of beginning the story of one's life with a prehistory &lt;? 'The chapter deserves close reading for it sets out important images, symbols, and narrative patterns that weave through the entire book. In so doing, the text's past insinuates itself into the story, much as Bugul's life is informed by cataclysmic events of the past that retain destabilizing power throughout the course of her life.</page><page sequence="9">Women 's Studies Quarterly 1 997: 3 &amp;4 129 What is the nature of this narration? How is the teller telling the story? What textual presences do we notice that display the writer's perspective? The book's first chapter presents itself as a fiction narrated in the third person, unlike the rest of the book, which is written from the per- spective of the conventional "I" of autobiographic writing. This is the "I" we ordinarily expect in writing/speaking about oneself, the "I" that assumes identity of writer and subject.11 But the story that Bugul has directly experienced and remembers, which she tells in the later chap- ters using the expected "I," is embedded in the indirectly known story of family and community origins. These are her "handed down" sto- ries, just as each of our "prehistories," if we know them, have been told first by other people. Bugul presents the experience of the distant past before she was born in the voice of a third-person, mediating narrator who tells of the boy Fode, the girl Codou, and their mother. The story of village life - mother kneading millet, daughter and son teasing one another, the son's making ndiambdne (a drink made from the baobab fruit, sugar, and water) soon takes on larger resonances as Bugul trans- forms a scene of the everyday into a netherworldly space, a poetic space of mythic origins and of cultural cosmogony. She creates in her pre- history one of those stories of origins and beginnings present in every culture, one that provides a narrative matrix in which the current, time/space intersection occurs and that projects, in general terms, the values of the culture. The origin of her people's past emerges close to the sacred "time of the gods." How does the writing/story evoke mythologic resonances? What is the effect of this section on the balance of the book? As Fode and Codou grow into adulthood, the village itself begins changing into a place apart from the ordinary: "The entire village had taken on that form of existence in which beauty is intermingled with the everyday and the dream" (10-11). A new family - a man, his wife, and three children - soon comes to the place in search of a homeland and finds an "unreal landscape . . . there was nothing but sun. . . . Here humans did not speak. Only the sun spoke. This place was not the place of everyday" (12). The family believes that the place holds redemptive promise: "Here we'll all be reborn" (13). The family's youngest child, clinging to his mother for comfort and reassurance, sets loose an amber bead which becomes a migrating symbol through- out the book: "While trying to put one arm around the mother's neck he had broken the amber necklace she had worn for the trip. The beads scattered like the heat that embalmed the fantastic universe that</page><page sequence="10">130 Women s Studies Quarterly 1 997: 3&amp;4 was the savanna, the land of the sun and of light" (12). Itself the sub- stance of a prehuman era, the amber bead will carry the image of Bugul's mythic prebeginnings and those of her land and culture across the landscape of her life writing. In the village lives a mythologic "old man," a nameless, "ageless crea- ture" who has "discovered the plant that ensure [s] immortality" (13). The man speaks in an incantory, rhythmic style that brings to mind the oral tales of early cultures: "Greetings, my people," he sa[ys], "I had already dreamed that you would come and settle here. I am the oldest, the wisest of all. I know everything. I possess all the secrets of this village. I had a family here more than five centuries ago. ... I have always been alive, and, believe me ... I am immortal. In another thousand years, I'll still be here. ... I hope the sun will warm you for a long time to come. If you are looking for immortality, I am always under the trees should you want to find me." (13-14) 12 The man understands the relation of past to future that will be revealed as an organizing principle of Bugul's life story as told in this particular text. He understands, for example, that the young baobab that stands tree before him and the family seems to be planted by other than human hands, for "one morning [it] came out of the soil as if it were planted by gods of another world" (14). Spit onto the ground by the boy Fode "when he [goes] to answer the mother's call on the morning of the first day the gods conceived a new generation that was to convulse the times" (10), a baobab seed undergoes a tra- ditionally sacred germination by water (at the end of a paragraph per- colating with watery terms: rainy season, downpour, soaked, bubbling water, puddles, waterholes) ,13 The new baobab keeps growing in the face of personal, community, and earthly catastrophe to become an ongoing symbol of life's persistent force. It is this baobab that finally withers and dies from Ken's attempt to move away from her own his- tory, the baobab she eulogizes as she returns to Senegal to restore some wholeness to her "pulverized, dispersed conscience" (150). What do we make of the animate/inanimate metaphors? The baobab, in the first section of the book, seems to be sentient: "And, what, also, was the baobab thinking about? For sometimes it would begin to laugh, sometimes to weep, and it would happen as well that it would fall asleep so that it could dream" (17) . Here the prehis-</page><page sequence="11">Women 's Studies Quarterly 1 997: 3&amp;4 131 tory bespeaks a worldview that permeates the entire text. Throughout the prehistory inanimate objects display actions we conventionally asso- ciate with animate creatures or, more precisely, with human beings: "the night caressed their bodies" (13); "the wind surprised the flame" (11); "the tracks found me here" (16); and further into the text, "the square was there waiting for me" (34) ; "all the seductive store windows were egging me on" (36); "I collapsed in a seat which caught me just in time" (24). One might be inclined to read these expressions metaphorically, as figures of speech according to Western modes of literary interpretation. Surely, many believe, they cannot be read lit- erally, for the real world does not work like this: Trees, for example, do not think or laugh. Literary terminology even has words to describe the phenomenon of attributing human characteristics to inanimate objects: anthropomorphism, as any high school student knows, or the less benign animism, a Western interpretation of an unfamiliar way of per- ceiving the visible world. However as John Mbiti explains, the view manifest in many African religions and cultures is that nature in the broadest sense of the word is not an empty or imper- sonal object or phenomenon; it is filled with religious significance. . . . Man gives life even where objects and phenomena have no biologi- cal life. God is seen in and behind these objects and phenomena. . . . The invisible world is symbolized and manifested by these visible and concrete phenomena and objects of nature. The invisible world presses hard upon the visible: one speaks of the other. (56-57) Mbiti goes on to say that "it is unfortunate that foreign writers, through great ignorance, have failed to understand this deep religious insight of our peoples; and have often either ridiculed it, or naively presented it as 'nature worship' or 'animism'" (57). Bugul herself comments on the discrepancy between her own per- spective and that of the Europeans in her circle: "They didn't know that we don't have the same vision of things. The West secularizes everything" (62). Although the animate/inanimate images recall mem- ories of the sacred quality of Bugul 's early childhood during her stay in the West, Bugul's separation from her community's historic/poetic origins afflicts her every effort at self-knowledge: "We went looking for ourselves but we knew the sacred had been abandoned" (130). She directly attributes to colonialism her (and her compatriots') severance from the body of her motherland: "The arrival of the whites had undermined sacred foundations, had dismembered them, in order to turn the colonized into an anguished people forever more" (85). Her</page><page sequence="12">132 Women 's Studies Quarterly 1 997: 3 &amp; 4 sense of alienation from "that which matters" is complete, as she con- siders what it means to be "a woman, a rigid woman, to be a child with- out any notion of parents, to be Black and to be colonized" (93). As this complex network of alienations, retrievals, and reconstructions weave the beginnings of a matrix of self-recognition and acceptance, Bugul comforts herself in Europe with images from "home." She speaks, for example, of the pleasure of a warm house in a cold climate feeling like "the grandmother's lap where, when you were being chased, you could run to and hide in" (42-43); of feeling a nervous beat "like the rumbling of approaching thunder in the evening of heavy rain during the wet season" (37); of the sky in Brussels appear- ing "like an overturned calabash" (45), what Chikwenye Ogunyemi calls "the sacred container" (27). At certain moments in the prehistory the narrator makes comments and poses questions that are removed from the surface flow of the devel- oping story. The "narrator's cosmic questions" (NCQ, in the margins of my book) invite the reader to step back from the story, to ask about the meaning of the events and activities of which we have been reading: Sometimes we have to ask how the world went on without grasping any answer; inescapably, every day of one's life, events follow one another. . . . Formulas collide. Lost human beings roam around inside thoughts, meditations. Notions introduce themselves, ideas are born, plans grow profuse, comparisons compare. Each one tries a new path in emptiness, but flight inspires creation and to create is to fill the void, humankind's only true enemy. (14-15) Such comments turn up across the entire text providing a meditative counter-rhythm to the flow of story of daily life in Brussels and remem- bered events of childhood in Senegal. They stand as narrative inser- tions of Bugul's current state of mind while writing of past events; they accomplish something Virginia Woolf believed was an important chal- lenge for the autobiographer, who "must devise some means by which the two levels of existence can be recorded - the rapid passage of events and actions; the slow opening up of single and solemn moments of concentrated emotion ("DeQuincey's Autobiography," 6). These reflections show the generative nature of memory, as seemingly "dead" events of the past combine with the current moment of writing to yield thought that opens to the future of as yet unlived, unspoken possibility. This narrative strategy primes the reader for Bugul's perspective on a variety of topics central to her project of coming to self-acceptance. These topics include knowing one's own emotions: "There are seas of</page><page sequence="13">Women 's Studies Quarterly 1 997: 3 &amp;f 4 133 emotions, multiple feelings and resentments that no one can express, much less describe. I believe that nothing of what goes on inside of us is ever entirely expressed. For it is beyond us" (38) ; the importance of communication no matter what language anyone speaks: "The only language all human beings understand is the language of humanity" (70) ; issues surrounding self-knowledge: "What does asserting oneself mean when the person has not accepted herself and has not been revealed to herself (71) ; and the continuous reformation of identity: "The T, barely conscious of itself, assigns itself its role only to die tomorrow" (15). Bugul comments also on a range of more specifically located sub- jects related to gender and race. On women's friendships: Women hate each other, are jealous of each other, envious, flee from each other. They do not know that there aren't any "women," there is only woman. They ought to find each other again, get to know each other, soak each other up. (84) On the struggles of postcolonial Africans: The invaders had separated us, had set us against each other, and we hadn't managed to escape from that. And how can we speak of Black struggle, Black power, Black culture, African unity, if we haven't yet resolved this problem. (91) On the World Festival of Negro Arts: What still remained of the Black people was displayed in a show of entertainment between the conquered and the conquerors, in their participation in the process of humanity's march of history. What Black people had endured couldn't be replenished by such a display. Black people needed to exorcise themselves, not to be enchanted. The wreckage that the colonizer had made of the Black man by rip- ping him away from his dreams was sanctioned in this worldwide spectacle. (130) Each of these topics - emotions, language/communication, women's friendships, neo/postcolonialism, black identity - serve as subjects for deeper research and study; any of them would make excellent topics for papers or for group work and class presentations.14 As mentioned previously, an amber bead - an "amber bead in the ear" - moves across the chapter boundaries of The Abandoned Baobab, providing a transition from Ken's prehistory to the story her actual life.</page><page sequence="14">134 Women 's Studies Quarterly 1 997: 3 &amp; 4 In the prehistory the young wife and her small child are outdoors under the giant baobab: "Suddenly a scream! A piercing scream. A cry from underneath the denuded baobab tree came to shatter the har- mony of the deserted village. The child was pushing an amber bead into its ear, deeper and deeper" (17). "Ken's History" tells of the same events but this time, in the first person, as her own story: At two years old ... I was playing in the sand, underneath an immense baobab tree across from the family house. I found an amber bead. ... I pushed the bead into my ear. . . . How I wanted to tell the mother that she shouldn't leave me alone at age two under the baobab tree! . . . The piercing scream under the denuded baobab in the village ... I was pushing the amber bead into my ear, deeper and deeper. (21-22) These sentences connect Ken's own life story with the ancient stor- ies of her culture. Symbol of that culture's origins, the bead brings a dual image of childhood joy and severed harmony again and again into her present life-as-written. But Bugul reveals a key source of her lifelong dis/ease in the passage's moment of self-reflection: "How I wanted to tell the mother that she shouldn't leave me alone at age two under the baobab tree!" The loss of her mother's care echoes in the last pages of the book as Bugul, in a frenzy of self-loathing, struggles to either end her suffering by suicide or restore to herself a long-lost feeling of wholeness: "Where had the mother gone? Why was I left all alone under the baobab tree. ... A child should never be left alone under the baobab tree. The mother was never supposed to leave. Why had she gone" (152-153)? She understands that she has been looking for safety, comfort, and a sense of well-being in the wrong place: "I had nothing and was looking for my entire childhood in every situation in a country that had replaced my own, where I gave myself wholeheart- edly to tragedy ever since the mother's departure" (154-1 55). Bugul's flight from her African soil/soul conflates with the loss of her mother to provide the book's central figure of self-alienation: "I was desper- ately searching for 'the bond' across disasters of alienation for twenty years while the distant mother was calling her child" (150). Distant Africa, distant mother, distant connection to sacred origins sound across the "void that bloated" her (57) as Bugul buys a plane ticket and, "full of rage and despair" (158), returns to Senegal. The Abandoned Baobab traces the story of Ken Bugul's journey to a nurtur- ing sense of African identity and speaks this new vision of "home" for herself, her countrywomen, and her countrymen.</page><page sequence="15">Women s Studies Quarterly 1 997: 3 &amp;4 135 The Autobiography Project Over the course of a semester study of autobiographical works, stu- dents may generate their own autobiographical stories through a series of connected writings. Each week, in addition to responses to assigned readings, students produce several pages of written excursion, focus- ing on their own experiences of the assigned subject. By the semester's end, students will have an array of pieces that together comprise their own life-story writings, which may be supplemented by photographs, recipes, and other related materials. Should a student feel excluded from writing about a particular subject - mother, for example, because she or he doesn't know her, or "family rituals" because there weren't any - the student may be encouraged to write about what not having or not knowing those aspects of personal history means to her or him. In this way, the student can participate in the redemptive process of narrative, as she or he begins revisioning the presences and absences of their own lives. What follows is a list of possible topics for the auto- biography project. Of course, we may add freely to this list. ancestors and "prehistory" mother, father siblings home: room, apartment, house neighborhood schools/education family/ personal rituals and sacred objects family/personal myths and stories meals, food holidays/festivals who they think I am who I am and will become Suggested Reading List for Course in African Women 's Life-Story Writing Aidoo, Ama Ata.

"Every colonized people . . . finds itself face to face with the language of the civilizing nation, with the culture of the mother country. . . . He becomes whiter as he renounces his blackness" (Fanon 18). Also, "To speak a language is to take on a world, a culture" (38). Fanon notes the special effectiveness of the Senegalese regiments of the French army in conveying and interpreting French culture (19). See also Ngugi wa Thiong'o on his choosing to leave the language of the colonizers to write in Gikuyu. 4. See Rowbotham s Nationalist Movements and Women s Place in her Women in Movement ( 1 03-1 13). 5. Senghor's idealization of African women and their eroticized identifica- tion with "Africa" is prefigured by Charles Baudelaire's "La Chevalure," first published in 1857 in LesFleurs du mat (The Flowers of Evil). Rather than originating the primary figure of mid-twentieth-century "Negritude," Senghor may have given new energy to a figure well entrenched in mid- nineteenth-century French mainstream thinking, a culture already intrigued by hundreds of years of involvement in African culture. Thus Senghor's idealization of African women may be an extension of a well- accepted and "classic" French vision. 6. Bugul's story of psychological and cultural alienation resonates with Karen Smyley- Wallace's discussion of fictive stories of "new and problematic female characters" in francophone African literature: "Forced to struggle with social, political, philosophical or sentimental problems, the Black female character often found herself cut off from her past, and trapped within the confines of a system of alienation . . . the embodiment of 'things French' and 'things Black'" (65). 7. Here I may be sticking my neck out and getting into critical trouble. Sitting with a Wolof dictionary and an accompanying book of grammar, I recognize that the author's actual name, Marietou M'Baye, is not a name of this language. However, the long colonial history of Senegal and the influence of French upon the other languages in the region, Wolof among them, may have produced names that are indeed of Wolof culture and not actually French. I continue to research the origin of contempo- rary Senegalese names. It is not impossible that there's a lot I don't know</page><page sequence="17">Women 's Studies Quarterly 1 997: 3 &amp;4 137 about the publishers and their relation to the author that may make my interpretations in this section seem wrongheaded. Nevertheless, my ques- tions seem valid, even though the answers or explanations may be differ- ent or more complex than I've indicated. 8. However, the title of Bugul's new book Cendres et braises (Cinders and Ashes) projects a feeling of sadness similar to that in The Abandoned Baobab. 9. See Adeola James s interview with Ama Ata Aidoo (8-27) . 10. Jane Wilkinson asks Tsitsi Dangarembga about the relation of her own life to that of her main character Tambudzai and asks about her "prehistory" (190). 1 1 . The identity of the writer and the subject of the writing is what Philippe Lejeune has called "the autobiographic pact" (72-73). Although the ques- tion of narrative voice raises itself with any autobiographical text, I will assume the identity of Bugul with the narrating "I" for the purposes of this discussion. 12. The storytelling old man functions here as a griot, using "simplicity of plot and the orality of sentences" (Ogunyemi 132) to convey the community's values in story. 13. "The lesson of the word": I ask students to either circle in the book itself or note on a card words they react to, even for an instant. Often such words as a group reveal patterns of significance that may otherwise go by undetected. 14. "The lesson of the note card": I ask students to begin filling in note cards with quotes that interest them from the text (complete with page num- bers) , to put quotes with similar topics on a single card, and to mark each card with a topic name, such as those mentioned above, so they can wit- ness the accrual of meaning and can see precisely where their conclusions come from and how to support them with textual evidence.
