<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cranach as Cartographer The Rediscovered Map of the Holy Land Armin Kunz The earliest existing works by Lucas Cranach the Elder date from the artist's stay in Vienna around 1502-3. If one accepts the traditional assumption that he was born in 1472, he would have already been 30 years old by then. An account written by his cousin Matthias Gunderam in 1556 shows that Cranach was apprenticed to his father, who instructed him in 'artem graphicam'.1 In the light of routine workshop practice in late Gothic Germany, it therefore can be assumed that by the time he arrived in Vienna Cranach might have already been working as a painter for at least ten years.2 This remains true even if his birthdate is set some years later, as recent re-evaluation of the docu- ments suggests.3 While not a single work from the time before Cranach's Viennese sojourn has so far been con- vincingly connected with him, it is not surprising that even today every possible clue that promises to shed some light into the darkness of the first two and a half to three decades of Cranach's life is eagerly pursued. One such clue is the report of Cranach's alleged journey into the Holy Land. He is supposed to have joined the Saxon Elector Frederic III, called 'the Wise' (1463-1525), on his pilgrimage in 1493. The report of Cranach's participation can be traced back to the beginning of the eighteenth century, and although his presence on the pilgrimage has frequently been ques- tioned, references to it reappear even in recent schol- arly works. The issue took on special relevance when in 1 92 1 Heinrich Röttinger published two parts of a multi-block map of Palestine that he convincingly attributed to Cranach.4 In the last decade the remain- ing four parts of the map have been discovered, and were published consecutively in 1986.5 I have been able to trace the fragment published by Röttinger, the whereabouts of which was unknown after 1945.6 Finally, even its lower margin (from which a c. 80 mm Arthur Dürst, whose efforts led to the discovery of the complete map, provided me with the most recent cartographic literature on Cranach's map. Without his support this article could not have been written. The text owes its present form to the tireless editing of Catherine Bindman, whose help I deeply appreciate. i. Gunderam 's Latin text was edited by J. Heller, Lucas Cranach's Leben und Werke , 2nd edn, Bamberg 1844: 'Natus est antem anno Christi 1472 in oppido Francio Cranach in diocesi Bambergensi et a patre artem graphicam dediciť (p. 280).

Despite this somewhat schematic calculation, certain features can be seen in Cranach's artistic output in Vienna that distinc- tively characterize it as a more or less typical Frühwerk. This phase of Cranach's career remains obscure, despite the exten- sive literature published on the artist. 3. See E. Schepers, 'Die Maler von Kronach', and R.

While Schepers is convinced that Cranach was born later, she does not propose a tentative date for his birth (p. 48). Hambrecht shows that the 'Lucas Maler' claiming money for a painting in Coburg in 1501 cannot be Cranach. For the docu- ment relating to the latter incident see W.

The two fragments, printed on one sheet, formerly belonged to the princes of Liechtenstein, and were kept in Vienna until 1945. This collection was sold after the war via England and Switzerland. A first clue that led to the rediscovery of the sheet was given in catalogue 56, 1951, of the New York dealer H.P. Kraus: 'Choice Manuscripts, Books, Maps, and Globes', which offered among other items 'Remarkable Maps from the Prince Liechtenstein Collection'. Although the Cranach map was not included, further inquiries showed that an additional lot of maps with the same provenance was sold hors catalogue to Stephen W. Phillips (Salem, ma) and Curt H. Reisinger (New York). They presented it in 1951 to Harvard University, where the maps are today kept in the Houghton Library. The reading room there has an inventory of this lot, consisting of eighteen typescript pages, dated April 1952 (RR 468.3.7.F). The last item on the last page reads 'case IV * 51-2597 "Unidentified. Das Gros Meer. Woodcut'", which turns out to be the sheet with the two fragments from Cranach's map (I would like to thank N. G. Stogdon and Ms Kit Currie at H.P. Kraus, who gave the cru- cial hints). On the rediscovery of the Liechtenstein sheet see A.

The Map of The Holy Land forms an important addi- tion to the graphic œuvre of Lucas Cranach the Elder. Although it was published in cartographic as well as art-historical literature,8 most of the questions linked with the map still remain unanswered. Arthur Dürst gives a detailed account of the map's odyssey and the circumstances that led to its discovery. While he is mainly concerned with the group of copies after the woodcut, he does not investigate Cranach's own posi- tion in the cartographic history of his time. Michael Liebmann intentionally leaves this area aside to focus on the map as a work of art.9 His article undoubtedly gives him 'pride of place' for the publication of the map in the art-historical field. None the less, it remains somewhat hastily compiled and restricted in its scope. Arguing only on stylistic grounds, Liebmann ignores the possibilities provided by the very existence of the rediscovered objects: what is actually depicted and what kind of material evidence can we gather from the sheets themselves? More recently, Peter Meurer tried to identify the geographer Barthel Stein (1476/77-1521/22) as Cranach's adviser on the design of the map. While he describes the contents of the map in detail, his whole argument rests on the assumption that the map was executed as early as c. 1510, to which date it has been traditionally ascribed on rather weak foundations, as we will see.10 There is some justification, then, in tackling the subject of the map again. First, I intend to summarize the documentary evidence relating to the question of Cranach's Palestine trip before examining the map itself. An iconographie analysis will be followed by consideration of stylistic issues, limited though they are in the case of a geographical chart, together with an examination of the paper and watermarks of the sheets. Finally, I shall attempt to reconstruct the date of the map and aspects of the historical circumstances that led to its production. Cranach's participation in Frederic the Wise's pil- grimage is first mentioned in Johann Sebastian Müller's Annales. 1 1 From there the story found its way into the historical literature on Saxonia. Müller's notice, written nearly 200 years after the event, is con- tradicted by the Vita that was compiled by Georg Spalatin immediately after the Elector's death in 1525, and reworked several times between then and 1540. It includes an excursus on the journey together with a list of the pilgrims, in which Cranach is not mentioned - although Spalatin knew the Saxon court artist well - and explicitly writes about the difficulties of his own research due to the fact that in 1539 'kaumet drei oder vier' of the participants were still alive.12 If Cranach was a member of Frederic's party, one might have expected that he would have been a welcome eye- witness for the Wittenberg chronicler. Christian Schuchardt was the first to draw attention to a docu- ment that was compiled by one of Frederic's fellow pilgrims, the Saxon bailiff Hans Hundt. His account book gives a detailed record of all the expenses 7. L.

Although Meurer, unlike Liebmann, sees the connection with the maps that derive from Ptolemy and Sañudo and also describes the dependence of Cranach's map on the biblical text, he nevertheless assumes additional empirical information ('primäre Informationen', p. 169) to complement these sources. He allows Cranach merely the artistic contribution ('der rein künstlerisch-handwerkliche Anteil', p. 171) to the execution of the map and insists that a trained geographer was its scholarly cartographic author. He tentatively identifies the latter with Barthel Stein, who held what can be considered to have been the first German chair in geography at Wittenberg University between 1508 and c. 1510/12. Ii. J.

The names in both versions are identical.</page><page sequence="4">126 CRANACH AS CARTOGRAPHER incurred by the whole party.13 Among the many names mentioned on the list appear those of two painters, 'Cuntz Moler' and 'Johannes Moler', although neither of them can be easily linked with Cranach. It is not necessary to discuss again the question of Cranach's name: even if his family was called 'Maler', 'Moler', 'Müller', or rather 'Sunder', it would still be difficult to equate 'Lucas' with 'Johannes'!14 The evidence for a trip to Palestine undertaken by Cranach is, however, reinforced by a letter written by a certain Andreas Sluder in 1493 to his friend, the Viennese merchant Hans Weimann. Again it includes an extensive list of the participating pilgrims, but this time it explicitly mentions the artist: . . . wie das vnser beeder ehrnhoch vnd kunstreich Lucas kranach mitziehet auf der fürsten geheiß, daß er jeglichen heiligen ort nach notturft und wähl der herrn aufs genauist und best aufriß vnd Ver- zeichnung mache. The letter was published in 1853 in a historical novel by the Bavarian archivist, historian and writer Franz Trautmann, based on the life of Christoph of Bavaria (1449-93), the brother of the reigning Duke Albrecht IV (1447-1508). 15 Christoph joined Frederic the Wise and his pilgrims in Venice and died on the way back on the island of Rhodes. It is difficult to assess the authenticity of the documents cited in this book. Trautmann was undoubtedly equipped with a good overview of the documentary evidence provided by the historical literature as it then stood. The 'his- torical notes', with which he amended later editions of his book, mention single documents - he even supplies their depositories. It is, therefore, most tempting to assume the authenticity of those parts of the text where this kind of proof is lacking.16 Such proof does not in fact exist in the case of Sluder's letter. This has to be emphasized because Reinhold Röhricht, whose Deutsche Pilgerfahrten still remains the standard refer- ence work in the field, cites the letter as an authentic document.17 A careful examination of all the available sources, however, suggests that Trautmann's Ein Brief von München nach Wien is actually a fake. All the infor- mation, including the pilgrim list, could have been extracted from other material that was available to Trautmann in published form. Particularly dubious are those instances where he uses details from older historical surveys that have subsequently been discred- ited.18 Without this letter, and bearing in mind the fact that the painters mentioned in Hans Hundt's account book cannot be identified with Cranach, there is not much left to support the theory of Cranach's pilgrim- age. Müller, in 1700, was probably unaware that Cranach did not arrive in Wittenberg and become court artist until 1505. Whatever was the evidence he may have found of a painter in Frederic the Wise's party, it is not surprising that he assumed him to be Cranach, who was undoubtedly still a well-known Saxon artist in Müller's time. The absence of Cranach's name in Spalatin's list remains the most important evidence against this artist's pilgrimage. All further arguments against the idea had already been established in Schuchardt's monograph by 1851 - in particular the fact that Cranach's name does not appear in any surviving account at the Saxon court prior to 1504. The other reason is Frederic's trip to the Netherlands in 1494: the documents referring to Frederic's six-month journey to the Netherlands in 1494 mention only a 'Meister Johann der Maler'. Schuchardt observes correctly that one might also 13. Schuchardt, op. cit., 1, p. 4of. The document was edited by R. Röhricht and H. Meisner, 'Hans Hundts Rechnungsbuch (I493- 1494)'?

Koepplin, 'Lucas Cranachs Heirat und das Geburtsjahr des Sohnes Hans', Zeitschrift des deutschen Vereins Jur Kunstwissenschaft, XX, 1966, pp. 79-84; the question of Cranach's family name is discussed in detail (p. 8of. and nn. 19 and 20). The assumption that the name was 'Sunder' is based on an entry in the register of the Wittenberg University, dated 5 October 151 7, which men- tions a 'Johannes Sonder de Wittenbergk' who is identified by some scholars with Cranach's son Hans (the entry in Heller, op. cit., p. i n. **). The proposition is put forward by Schade, op. cit., p. 12, and T. L. Girshausen, 'Cranach, Malerfamilie', Neue Deutsche Biographie, ih, 1957, pp. 394-99, here p. 395.

Since the documentary evidence seems to mitigate against the possibility that the artist participated in Frederic's pilgrimage, it is necessary to establish not only the iconography and date of the map but also the sources that formed the basis for Cranach's design. Before addressing these different but closely inter- twined issues, I would like to describe the map and characterize the way it functions on its most readily apprehended level - as a chart of the Holy Land. It is made up of six different woodcuts, each measuring 197/198 by 301/302 mm. They are arranged in three rows of two cuts each. The composite sheet then forms an exact square of 600 by 600 mm (reconstructed here in fig. 81). We are shown the whole of modern Israel with a section of the Mediterranean Sea. The coast- line runs from the centre at left to the right part of the upper edge. The map is not precisely orientated to the north but rather to north-northwest. The Nile delta is at far left. At the bottom the Sinai peninsula divides the Red Sea into the Gulfs of Suez and Aqaba. To the right we see most of modern Jordan as well as parts of the Lebanon and Syria at the top, with Damascus in the upper-right corner. As was common in early maps, the semiotic system employed here forms a mixture of orthogonal projec- tion and bird's-eye views of accentuated details, such as the rock formations of the mountain ridges of Sinai, Carmel and Hermon, Mounts Tabor and Gilead. The cities are shown as minute fictitious townscapes, and in the Dead Sea one can make out the destruction of Sodom. The sea in the upper left is enlivened by three ships and a rowing-boat, while another ship and row- ing-boat appear in the Red Sea at the bottom. The history of biblical mapmaking is about as old as mapmaking itself, going back well into the classical period and even beyond.20 After the advent of printing in the fifteenth century 'no other part of the world was so extensively covered on the earliest printed maps',21 and the first two maps ever printed were a world map and a map of the Holy Land. There are two principal cartographic traditions that dominate this history: one religious, and the other going back to the legacy of Greek and Roman scientists and historians. Christian mapmaking was more or less exclusively based on the interpretation of the Bible and on the writings of the Early Fathers. In the absence of any real scientific method, these biblical charts used neither an astro- nomical system nor any other means to establish fixed locations. The only definite places were Jerusalem in the centre and Paradise in the far east. While this is true for world maps, however, regional maps of Palestine were generally less influenced by scholastic dogmatism, and it is here that one can perceive some attempt at accuracy. Yet, this too was hindered by lack of cartographic methodology, and the limited ap- pearance of topographic information in the known pilgrims' reports.22 It was therefore, the classical tradition that provided the framework for modern cartography. Its central fig- ure is the Alexandrian astronomer, mathematician and geographer Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy). His manual on mapmaking (YECöypa(plKf| D(|)r|Yr|aiç), compiled around 150-60 ad and normally referred to by its Latin title Geographia , was first translated from Greek into Latin by Jacopo di Angelo da Scarperia in 1409-10. From then on it exerted an enormous influ- ence in the field, providing the basis for almost all later mapmaking for over a century. The editio prìnceps of the text, still without accompanying maps, was published in Vicenza in 1475. The Geographia mainly consists of lists of latitudes and longitudes for some 8,000 differ- ent places, such as towns, rivers and mountain ranges, together with detailed instructions on how to produce a two-dimensional projection of the earth's spheric surface. Maps were subsequently supplied with a formalized grid of longitude and latitude, into which the listed places could then be inserted according to their coordinates. Nevertheless, one should be aware of the fact that none of Ptolemy's actual maps survived from classical times. It is therefore not always easy to assess in every detail how far the late medieval and Renaissance maps referred to as 'Ptolemaic' are influenced by the classical tradition, or to what extent they represent modern interpretations of this tradition. Although earlier compilations exist, the most important ones were produced in manuscript form 19. Schuchardt, op. cit., 1, pp. 4if. and 46. 20. Still useful, though not complete and having few illustrations, are the surveys from ancient Assyria up to the 1930s provided in H.

Traditionally, 27 maps are associated with the Geographia , organized in three groups: Europe (10 maps), Asia (12) and Africa (4), together with a world map.26 The fourth map devoted to the Asian continent, Quarta Asiae Tabula (fig. 82), gives a section of the Near East that provides us with 23 On Donnus Nicolaus see J.

The 'B series' comprises a world map and 64 detailed sheets (see Campbell, op. cit., p. i22f.).</page><page sequence="7">CRANACH AS CARTOGRAPHER 129 83.

Both are orientated more or less to the north. They show the characteristic coasdine of the Mediterranean running from the lower left to the upper right. In both, the feature furthest to the west is the River Nile, form- ing the left-hand margin of the map, while the south- ernmost part shows Sinai and the Red Sea. The key difference, of course, is the larger scale of Ptolemy's Asia map, which also includes Mesopotamia up to the Persian Gulf in the east.27 This classic Ptolemaic canon was extended by addi- tional maps, a result of the expanding geographical knowledge of the period. One of these is of special importance in this context: Palestina Moderna et Terra Saneta . Rather than showing most of the Near Eastern region, it focusses only on the Holy Land and its sur- rounding areas. In contrast to the Ptolemaic (and Cranach's) map, it is orientated to the east (see fig. 83). The coastline therefore runs parallel to the lower edge. The close-up naturally results in an increase of detailed information. The map first appears in the Uber secretorum fidelium crucis by Marino Sañudo (c. 1260-1343), a kind of propaganda pamphlet which, unsuccessfully, promoted the idea of a further crusade. Many of the elements that appear here originate in the long tradition of scholastic geography, most notably Burchard of Mt Sion's Descriptio Terrae Sanetae of 1283. Burchard was a thirteenth-century pilgrim from the central German town of Magdeburg, whose Descriptio was widely known and used as a kind of 'official pil- 27. Geographical accuracy need not be discussed in this context. For this see, e.g., Fischer, op. a/., pp. 176-78.

His contribution provided 'a firm scientific basis for what is otherwise a derivative map of the biblical school'.29 It was the connection with the classical canon that enabled this 'hybrid' to become definitive. At this point we come back to Donnus Nicolaus. In the last of his three different recensions of Ptolemaic maps, dating from around 1468, he also included a map of Palestine among the five contemporary ones that exceed the canonical set. It was no longer impor- tant that the map was originally composed by Sañudo and Vesconte: 'association with the atlases of Ptolemy assured its authority'.30 This last recension survives in three different manuscripts. The one kept in the princely Waldburg- Wolfegg'sche Library since at least 1672, formed the prototype for the first printed edition of Ptolemy north of the Alps, published at Ulm in 1482 by Lienhart Holl. Here the maps were executed for the first time in woodcut, while those of their Italian precursors had been made as engravings.31 This new method was to become the most advanced technique for the production of maps, and remained so until the middle of the sixteenth century. The chronological index in Eran Laor's cartobib- liography of the Holy Land reveals nineteen entries between 1475 and 1525. The first is the view of Pales- tine that appeared in Lucas Brandis's Rudimentorum novitiorum published in Lübeck in 147532 - one of the two earliest printed maps mentioned above. In i486 the account of Canon Bernhard von Breydenbach's pilgrimage to the Holy Land, his Peregrinationes in Terram Sanctam , was published in Mainz with seventeen woodcut illustrations. Most importantly, it contained seven city views, some of them printed from up to four different blocks forming folding plates. All cuts were executed by Erhard Reuwich, who accompanied Breydenbach on his journey. The largest, measuring 280 X 1,320 mm, is a panorama of Palestine as if seen from the sea and spreading from Damascus to Alexandria, with Jerusalem filling at least half of the whole picture in the centre.33 Liebmann suggests that Cranach might have copied on his map two of the sail- ing vessels that appear as decorative details in Breydenbach's views of Rhodes and Methóni (the galley seen in profile to the left, and the cog seen from behind).34 The influence of these illustrations was considerable: they were copied in Hartman Schedel's Liber chronicarum (Nuremberg 1493); the ships appear again in a 1502 edition of Vergil, and in the so-called 'Letter of Columbus', printed in 1494 in Basle.35 But although Cranach 's adaptations are close, they are not identical, and a copy of Breydenbach need not necessarily have been his only source. Liebmann's comparisons with Brandis and Breydenbach as the early standards of geographical (and art-historical) literature on Palestine are not therefore sufficient to link the map firmly to a 'German cartographic tradi- 28.

To stress further 'a certain resemblance' between these two views and Cranach's woodcut is simply inac- curate!36 If these more pictorial views are excluded, what remains, according to Laor's cartobibliography, are the Ptolemy editions published before 1522. Most of them contain the Palestina Moderna et Terra Sancta map in addition to the canonical Quarta Asiae Tabula. With these two standard types the basic framework of Cranach's chart can actually be defined. It combines the overall oudine of the Asia map and brings it into a close-up, focussing mainly on the Holy Land. Further information might then have been filled in from the more detailed Palestina Moderna chart. After the reissue of Holl's Ptolemy , printed by Johannes Reger in Ulm in i486, the next really new edition of the Geographia was the Strasbourg edition by Martin Waldseemüller, printed by Johann Schott in 151 3. 37 This edition should be mentioned here because it was the first to contain no less than 20 'modern' maps, this time not interpo- lated among the canonical ones, but rather added as Supplementum modernior following the traditional plate section. The two maps relevant to our argument, Quarta Asiae Tabula and Palestina Moderna are newly drawn, and the shadings of the various mountain ranges make Waldseemüller's maps clearer and more easy to survey. His versions are therefore illustrated here (figs. 82 and 83) to give an idea of the tradition that was probably Cranach's most important point of reference. Comparison with the Ulm Ptolemy never- theless shows that Waldseemüller, whose atlas was pioneering in many other respects, added nothing sub- stantially new to either of these two maps, and virtu- ally every feature can already be found in Holl's 1482 Ptolemy recension - apart perhaps from the decorative ship at the bottom of the Palestine map, which might have served as another possible model for one of Cranach's.38 I shall explore at least two possible sources for Cranach's design. One is the information we have about the books acquired by Elector Frederic for his library. Among them we find - bought between July 1512 and Easter 1513 - an Itinerarium Terrae Sanctae. Even more interesting is a letter, unfortunately un- dated, by the former rector of Wittenberg University, Martin Polichius von Melierstadt, to Georg Spalatin, who played an important rôle in the formation of the electoral, and later, the University Library. In this let- ter Meilerstadt pointed out that he knew of an oppor- tunity to acquire a choice copy of Ptolemy.™ After the closure of the University in 1547, most of its library was brought to Jena, where today it forms part of the library of the Friedrich Schiller University. It is espe- cially helpful that even the old library catalogues, compiled between 1536 and 1544, have survived. Research in Jena has shown that Wittenberg University owned at least one edition of Ptolemy's Geographia; the Alphabetische Katalog der Kurßrstlichen Bibliothek zu Wittenberg von 1536 (AK I)40 lists the books under various sections by author: in the section 'Mathematici, Cosmographi, Geographi Latini' we find on fol. 66r as the first entry for Ptolemy a 'Cosmographia'. The book still exists, the original fif- teenth-century binding bearing a vellum title label 36. Liebmann, op. cit., p. 198: 'Eine gewisse Ähnlichkeit dieser frühen Karten mit der Cranachschen läßt sich nicht verleugnen: Sie alle haben den mehr oder weniger panorama- tischen Charakter gemein. [. . .] Somit ist letztere in der deutschen kartographischen Tradition verankert'. The same reservations apply for Meurer, op. cit., p. 165, who lists both, Brandis and Breydenbach, on an equal level with the Quarta Asiae Tabula and the Palestina Moderna maps as the first four steps in the development of printed maps of Palestine. The subject of fifteenth-century pictorial views of Jerusalem has recendy been treated by R. Haussherr, 'Spätgotische Ansichten der Stadt Jerusalem (oder: War der Hausbuchmeister in Jerusalem?)', Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen , xxix/xxx, 1987/88, pp. 47-70; Haussherr finds convincing the arguments that the illustrator of Breydenbach 's Peregrinationes , Erhard Reuwich, cannot be identi- cal with the Master of the Housebook. 37. Facsimile edition Amsterdam 1966 ( Theatrum Orbis Terrarum , 2nd series, vol. rv). 38. With regard to the succession of Cranach's map I would like to draw attention to a fact that seems not to have been previously noted by cartographical historians: while even in Wald- seemüller's edition the Palestina Moderna map is still orientated to the east following the original source by Sañudo and Vesconte, the first recension of Ptolemy that provides a section similar to the one on Cranach's map (in reverse!) is Sebastian Münster 's Basle edition of 1540 (facsimile edition Amsterdam 1966: Theatrum Orbis Terrarum , 3rd series, volume v). The model for his XVI. Nova Tab.: Terra Sancta has always been considered to have been the Quinta Tabvla Vniversalis Palaestina in Jacob Ziegler's Quae intus continentur , published by Peter Schoeffer (Petrus Opilius) at Strasbourg in 1532 (J. Muller, Bibliographie Strasbourgeoise , 11, Baden-Baden 1985, p. 332, no. 14). Ziegler's book can be called the first 'adas' of Palestine in a modern sense, containing three detailed maps of different regions, and the mentioned Quinta Tabvla showing all of Palestine (Nebenzahl, op. cit., p. 7of. with pl. 23; Laor, op. cit., p. 117, no. 869). With the discovery of Cranach's map, however, it can be asked if it was his chart or its copy in Froschauer's Zurich Bible of 1525 (see below) that might have stimulated Ziegler's design. 39. W.

It is, however, an edi- tion of the Geographic printed by Petrus de Turre at Rome in 1490. While it contains an engraved set of the 27 canonical maps, none of the 'modern' maps is included in this edition.41 The volume is still in a very good condition, and the main initials of the text have been illuminated. It is therefore not completely unlikely that this could be the edition recommended by Mellerstadt.42 Although at least one Geographia edition can be proved to have been in Wittenberg during Cranach's lifetime, there is still no direct evidence for his actual source. Comparisons with the 'modern' cartographi- cal, i.e. Ptolemaic, context of his time show that Cranach's map was unique among its predecessors in many respects. To define this difference more pre- cisely, it is necessary to consider several details that have not yet been mentioned. A canonical component of early Palestine maps is the depiction of the regions inhabited by the Twelve Tribes of Israel; this is part of a long tradition dating back to the early Middle Ages. Curiously enough, it has always played an important part in Christian topography, while Jewish scholars do not seem to have been much interested in this ques- tion.43 In Cranach's map they are indicated by dotted lines and the names of all tribes are given in xylo- graphie Roman-type letters.44 By far the most telling feature of the map is the path the Israelites took on their flight from Egypt. Starting in the lower-left cor- ner with the crossing of the Red Sea and the depiction of Pharaoh's downfall, this route can be traced zigzag- ging through the Sinai mountains, where it is accentu- ated with tiny little scenes. Becoming progressively narrower it finally leads in a long curve to the banks of the River Jordan. Unlike the regions of the Twelve Tribes, this route does not appear on any of the Ptolemaic charts, not even in later, post- 1500 editions. Pictorial cycles of the course travelled during Israel's exodus date back as early as the murals in the Dura Europos synagogue, and appear frequently in manu- script illumination of the Middle Ages, as well as in wall paintings or stained-glass windows.45 Single scenes from the Flight are also depicted in Lucas Brandis 's view of Palestine, most notably Moses's reception of the Ten Commandments or the drowning of Pharaoh's army. But the accompanying scenes from the New Testament, such as the Baptism of Christ or the Calvary, suggest that they are all intended to serve primarily decorative functions, and are not linked to a strictly applied thematic concept. The combination of an abstract rather than panoramic printed map of the Holy Land with a detailed depiction of the route of Israel's exodus from Egypt and the wanderings through the wilderness seems to be solely Cranach's invention.46 Even more surprising is how closely Cranach fol- lows the biblical text. This factor is of special signi- ficance in questions concerning the intention, destination and function of the map. In the following paragraphs, therefore, all the indicated place-names and scenic details shown on the map will be examined in relation to the corresponding Mosaic books of Exodus and Numbers (see fig. 84). 47 The first name is Succoth (= Sochoi ) still on the Egyptian side of the Red Sea (Exod. 12:37). While Etham is described in Exod. 13:20 as a place of rest 'on the edge of wilderness' after Succoth has been left, Cranach gives the name on the further shore ( =ETHAN ).48 The first scenic depiction shows the Israelites led by Moses across the Red Sea on dry ground, while the water behind them rises to drown the Egyptian army at Pi-hahiroth (: ~Phiarot , Exod. 14:9). After the crossing, Moses leads the people 41. 2 Phil. V, 35 Inc. This edition is a reissue of the first Rome edi- tion of 1478. 42. On fol. gy of the same library catalogue there is a section enti- tled 'Mappae'. The first of the handful of entries listed there reads 'Terra Sancta', but unfortunately no trace of such a map can be found today. 43. A.

Bekemeier, Jüdisches Museum (dept. of the Berlin Museum), Berlin 1993, pp. 11-23, here p. 17. 44. With regard to this letter type (and certain stylistic features) Liebmann draws attention to Jacopo de' Barbari 's large wood- cut map of Venice dating from 1500. Barbari was Cranach's predecessor as Saxon court artist in 1503-05, and it is therefore quite likely that Cranach knew, and was in some respects stim- ulated by, his woodcut. 'Cranach scheint diese Schrift als erster Kartenreißer im Norden übernommen zu haben. Jedenfalls sind alle transalpinen Vorgänger der Palästina-Karte in Fraktur beschriftet gewesen' (Liebmann, op. cit., p. 199). 45. See, for example, H. Schlosser, 'Moses', Lexikon der Christlichen Ikonographie , in, Rome /Freiburg/ Basle /Vienna 1971, cols. 282-97, esp. section 11.B.2: 'Moses-Zyklen', cols. 289-93. 46. This view is confirmed by Meurer, op. cit., p. 169. 47. The italicized names follow the spellings as given on Cranach's map. The biblical quotations are taken from The Jerusalem Bible , London 1966. 48. This can be explained if one looks into Num. 33, where all the rests taken during the wandering through the desert are listed. Here we read that the Israelites came to Etham from Succoth (33;6)&gt; but also that after the crossing of the Red Sea they marched 'for three days in the desert of Etham' before they encamped at Marah (33:8).</page><page sequence="11">CRANACH AS CARTOGRAPHER 133 84. Detail from fig. 81. into ťthe wilderness of Shur' (: =SVR , Exod. 15:22). The first two places indicated there on the map are Elim and Marah (=ELIM and MARATH, Exod. 15:23 and 27). Next they came to 'the wilderness of Sin' (=SIN), said to lie 'between Elim and Sinai' (Exod. 16:1). Here the bread of God fell from Heaven, indicated on the map by minute figures collecting the manna in front of a tent. The miracle of the water springing from the rock took place in Rephidim (Exod. 17:1), and this again appears as a little scene {-RAPHIDIM). Naturally Cranach has illustrated the most important episode of the wandering through the desert large enough to be clearly identifiable. Accentuated by the somewhat larger letters 5ZA64/, we see God delivering the Ten Commandments to Moses. Below this the camp of the Israelites is depicted with many figures surrounding the high column with the Golden Calf (see Exod. igff. and 32). In the first month of the sec- ond year after the exodus from Egypt, the Israelites left their camp at the foot of Mount Sinai and resumed their journey to reach 'the wilderness of Paran' {-PHARAN^ Num. 10:12). From here they 'went up to reconnoitre the land, from the wilderness of Zin [. . .] as far as Hebron' (Num. 13:21-22). While Zin is indi- cated right below the depicted camp (=£ZA/), the city of Hebron is one of the small city vignettes nearby. Kadesh (= CADES) is the place in the wilderness of Paran where the Israelites waited for their messengers to return, and where they heard of the land that 'does indeed flow with milk and honey' (Num. 13:26^). The BARJŒA that is indicated direcdy behind CADES on the map is first mentioned in Num. 32:8. Moses him- self refers to the former episode, saying that he sent his scouts 'from Kadesh-barnea to inspect the land'. At</page><page sequence="12">134 CRANACH AS CARTOGRAPHER this point of the route there appears another little scene. Several details serve to indicate a high level of theological insight in the choice of these minute but thoughtfully distributed scenes. For the messengers not only brought news of the fertility of the Promised Land; some of them disparaged it as 'a country that devours its inhabitants' (Num. 13:32), which led the community to criticize Moses and Aaron and to rail against their God. Of all the messengers, only Joshua and Caleb remained loyal to God and were then the only ones to be saved when He enacted His revenge (Num. 14:38). In the tiny depiction of the scene, one can observe two figures standing apart to the left, while the rest of the community, including Moses, are in front of the tents to the right of the corpses. Yet the bodies are clearly shown as lying in a pit. This seems to be a reference to chapter 16 of Numbers, describing the rebellion of Korah against Moses and God's pun- ishment: 'The ground split open under their feet, the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them' (Num. i6:3if.). Whichever one of these events is depicted,49 central to the argument here is the choice of Kadesh- barnea as a location worthy of emphasis, in spite of the fact that there is no elaborate iconographical tradition belonging to it. While some theologians even go so far as to see Kadesh - and not the Sinai - as the true place of the foundation of the covenant with God, what remains is its significance as one of the most important sites of the theophany.50 The next stop on the journey was Mount Hor (= HOR , Num. 20:22). Cranach even illustrates - according to the Scripture (Num. 21:4 and 14:25) - the return to the Sea of Suph. The next episode appear- ing in a miniature scene is that of the Brazen Serpent (Num. 21:6-9). Later, the Israelites camped in Oboth (= OBOTH , Num. 21:10). Here the Sinai mountain range is seen on the left and the path leads straight up to the north, with another rest 'at lye-abarim, in the wilderness that borders Moab, towards the sunrise [i.e. east]' (=ABARIM and MOABITAE , Num. 21:11). 'They set out from there and camped in the wadi Zereď ( -SARED , Num. 21:12). The following halt is described as 'beyond the Arnon. This wadi in the desert begins in the land of the Amorites' (Num. 21:13). Both ARNON and AMMONITAE are indicated on the map. Between the two little rivers we see a bat- tle scene, obviously referring to the battle between the Israelites and Sihon, the king of the Amorites. After his defeat, Israel took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok ( -IABOC ), which is shown a bit further to the north (Num. 21:23-24). Mount Pisgah {-PASGA)^ north of the battle scene, as well as the city 'Ar of Moab' {-AR) to the east, are also mentioned in the same chapter (Num. 21:20 and 28). The name BLACHFELD , which is situated on the map at the very end of the dotted line of the road through the wilderness between Mount Pisgah and the Jordan, is perhaps the most useful of all details in an attempt to date the map. It is the translation of the Latin 'planitiem' (Deut. 4:49) or 'in campestribus' (Deut. 11:30), meaning 'plain', and used to signify geo- graphically the rift- valley of the river Jordan, also known as the 'Araba'. Of importance in this context is the fact that the very word 'Blachfeld' (a version of 'Flachfeld', i.e. 'flat field') was not introduced into lit- erary German until Luther's translation of the Bible.51 Even though earlier German Bibles exist, the Wittenberg reformer was the very first to use this particular word in his German version of the Old Testament in 1522!52 Finally, we must consider another element that, equally, cannot be explained simply from within the 49. The scene does not show, however, the death of Miriam (Num. 20:1), as suggested by Meurer, op. cit., p. 170. 50. This fact is further underlined in Deut. 1:19-46. See also North, op. cit., p.36. It is interesting to note that in the Palestina Moderna map of Holl's Ptolemy edition we can already find a long inscription above the mare martuum sive sodomorum referring to the desertů Cades. It is explained as the place from where the mes- sengers were sent out to reconnoitre the Promised Land. The text also refers to the 38 years it took the Israelites from there before they reached the banks of the Jordan after they had grumbled against God (Deut. 2:14). The passage is nearly iden- tically repeated on the Palestine map in the Geographia edited by Waldseemüller, illustrated here as fig. 83. 51. Trübners Deutsches Wörterbuch , ed. A.

Of the eighteen pre-Lutheran German Bible translations I was able to check eleven in the Herzog August Bibliothek in Wolfenbüttel (a list of these editions can be found in W. Eichenberger and H. Wendland, Deutsche Bibeln vor Luther: Die Buchkunst der achtzehn deutschen Bibeln zwischen 1466 und 1522, Hamburg 1977, p. 156).

What is in no sense comprehensible from a geographical angle is elucidated by the biblical text, a fact first pointed out by Catherine Delano-Smith: the two cities linked by the line function in no less than eight places as partes pro toto , i.e. as a metaphor for all Israelite land in the sense of 'the whole of Israel from Dan to Beersheba'.53 A peculiarity that provides an incontestable link to Cranach's employer, the Saxon Court, are the vessels depicted on the open sea in the upper-left corner. The uppermost ship, shown from the front, has a large electoral coat of arms set on its sail. On the ship seen in profile to the left, this device reappears in a much smaller version on the outside of the rear cabin. There is no doubt that the pilgrimage of Elector Frederic to the Holy Land was well known and admired in his Saxon realm years after the event. But if this map was mainly drawn and published as a tribute to his endeavours on the journey, and therefore as a 'hidden portrait' of the Elector himself,54 one may wonder why it illustrates nearly exclusively chapters from the Old Testament in great detail, and does not provide any explicit link with this particular historical event. As we have seen, the designs for the ships could have been taken from a whole range of possible sources. It is unlikely therefore that these ships were anything more than decorative devices, used as places to put the coats of arms. This assumption is reinforced by Cranach's use of the Saxon emblems in other woodcuts. It is par- ticularly common for him to depict them (or his own emblem - a winged dragon) not merely as abstract signs but as material objects: shields hanging from trees or stone tablets inscribed with his signature. This latter, more decorative, aspect has to be con- sidered in the light of the explicit theological informa- tion that we have just examined in some detail. The theological narrative surely indicates that Cranach's main concern could hardly have been a memorial to Frederic's pilgrimage. Most of the details on the map, and especially all the scenic depictions (except for the destruction of Sodom), are connected solely with the biblical text of the wanderings of the Israelites through the wilderness. What Cranach produced, in fact, was an illustration of a central passage of the Mosaic books in the unusual form of a large map. It no longer seems necessary, therefore, to search for some geographer who would then serve as the main source for Cranach's work.55 Instead, it might be more helpful to consider the artist's close relationship to Martin Luther. For it is the latter's translation of the Bible on which Cranach's surprisingly detailed map closely depends - apart from the classical tradition provided by the Ptolemaic maps, which, as we have seen, were already available in various printed editions. We must now explore the map's date of execution in order to establish its origins and intended function. In his publication of two fragments of the map, Röttinger made nearly all the conclusions possible at this point. Referring to the later state of the coat of arms, he gave 1508 as a terminus post quern.56 After con- sidering the watermark - a Bull's Head (see fig. 94), which he compared with Briquet 15,123 (c. 1506) and 15,124 (c. 1524-26)57 - he suggested a possible date between 1508 and 1526 for the execution of the map. Although Röttinger did not give any further reasons, his attribution to Cranach has never been ques- tioned.58 Indeed, the quality of the more 'picturesque' parts of the composition, such as the ships and the vividly drawn waves, and the high level of craftsman- ship seen in the cutting, in addition to the Saxon 53.

The other passages are: Judg. 20:1; 1 Sam. 3:20; 2 Sam. 3:10, 17:11, 24:15; i Kgs. 5:5; 1 Chr. 21:2. Although Meurer, op. cit., p. 171, refers to this phrase, he nevertheless makes the unlikely suggestion that the line is meant as a unit of measurement: 'eine Angabe der Größeneinheit [. . .], auf die mangels konkreten Maßstabs alle Entfernungen zu beziehen sind'. 54.

He proposed '3515 (?)*, unfortu- nately providing no explicit reasons for his view.62 Eran Laor, who was the first to publish the (nearly) complete map now kept in Jerusalem, considered both dates possible.63 Most recently, Liebmann argued for an exe- cution date of 1508-09, solely on stylistic grounds.64 The most stimulating observations were made by Catherine Delano-Smith, who set the map in the con- text of maps of the Holy Land used in sixteenth- century Bibles. Focussing on the problem from this perspective, she suggested a date as late as 1522-25, 65 but withdrew her view in later publications, probably under the impact of the art-historical Cranach litera- ture.66 She clearly did not consider the rather weak foundations of these scholarly arguments. Liebmann's article is the first to discuss the question of the date of Cranach's map at some length. He com- pares certain features of the map with other woodcuts by Cranach. In particular he sees a close relationship with the woodcuts of 1509, such as the Passion series (Hollstein 21, 10-23; illustrated is Hollstein 21, 10; here fig. 85) or Venus and Cupid (Hollstein 81, 105), noting the comparable parallel shading, design of the rocks, or similarities between the waves in the map (fig. 86) and the clouds in the Passion scenes. It is known that Cranach employed the Strasbourg Formschndder Symphorian Reinhart for the woodcuts in his Heiltumbuch (Hollstein 74, 96), which also appeared in 1509. Liebmann not only attributes the design of the map to Cranach but also suggests Reinhart as the Formschndder. He finally dates it, with reference to these comparisons, '1508-1509'. A response to Lieb- mann's argument is possible on two different levels: one stylistic, the other 'materialistic' and historical. First, it is necessary to consider not only the state of the coat of arms, but also its specific form. The coats of arms in Cranach's woodcuts usually have a simple outline, and only some show a second curve on one side.67 Nevertheless there is one woodcut that depicts shields with the same outline as those on the map: The Rest on the Flight into Egypt with Dancing Angels (fig. 87; Hollstein 18, 8). Although not dated, this is generally held to have been executed around 15 15 - in any case later than the prints of 1509. 68 1 do not think, however, that the comparisons suggested by Liebmann are wrong. The problem is that it is equally possible to find other - and mainly later - examples of this kind. See, for instance, the cloud structures in the woodcuts of St Barbara (fig. 88; Hollstein 68, 92) and St Catherine (Hollstein 69, 93), both executed in 1519. Among the Apocalypse illustrations for Luther's translation of the New Testament executed by various woodcutters, the best ones also show similarities: St John Swallowing The Book (fig. 89; Hollstein 29, 3od) has. regular shading and anthropomorphic clouds similar to the waves in the map. The same can be said of the body of the dragon in The Two Witnesses and the Beast (fig. 90; Hollstein 29, 30e). The main problem with all these comparisons, is that one has to take into account that cartographical works are in many respects separate from the rest of the œuvre of anyone who is primarily an 59. Liebmann, op. cit., p. 197, comes to the same result, using catch- words such as 'qualitätsvolles Werk', 'sichere Strichführung', 'schön und mit viel Phantasie gezeichnet', and 'von einem großen Künstler und nicht von einem Reißer von Karten'. 60.

The impression of the map in Jerusalem has two identical watermarks. They show the letters 'C' and T' intertwined by a quadripartite leaf (fig. 91).70 Unfortunately no reference to this mark has been found either in the current watermark literature or in the Piccard archive in Stuttgart. The watermark on the Amsterdam fragment shows a Bull's Head sur- mounted by a trifoliate leaf (fig. 92): this resembles the type nos. 537-38 in section xn of Piccard's three vol- umes on Ochsenkopf- Wasserzeichen. Among the prov- enances mentioned, one is Wittenberg; the dates at which the mark occurs range between 1523 and I526.71 This watermark can also be found in two of Cranach's later woodcuts. In the Metropolitan Museum's im- pression of St John Preaching, , dated 1516 (Hollstein 62, 85), the watermark is identical (fig. 93).72 The con- dition of the block indicates that this sheet belongs to the group of earliest impressions known of this woodcut. It is especially interesting that a very similar watermark can be found on an early impression of The Rest on the Flight into Egypt with Danäng Angels in Weimar; while not identical, it still belongs to the same Piccard type.73 As has been said, this is the only woodcut by Cranach that shows the coats of arms in an identical shape to those on the map. The Bull's Head water- mark on the sheet in Cambridge (fig. 94) is nearly identical with Piccard section xni, no. 408, which again has as provenance and date 'Wittenberg 1523'.74 88.

A rubbing of the watermark (actual size) in Das Allte Testament deutsch , Melchior Lotther the Younger, Wittenberg, September 1523 (Jena, Friedrich Schiller University Library). With all identifiable watermarks dating from the 1520S, another source gains importance, one which was first linked with Cranach's map by Delano-Smith and which formed the basis for her proposed dating of the map to around 1522-25. It is a letter by Philip Melanchthon, addressed to Caspar Crucinger in Leipzig, and written around 6 March 1522: Dearest brother, After your departure we received from our Elias [i.e. Luther] the whole New Testament translated into the vernacular, an outstanding work, better than many commentaries. He has decided to prefix to it a topography, as they call it, of the Holy Land, to make this reading easier. You know how much profit such a survey brings. And [. . .] as I hear that Reinecke the Antiquarian has a certain Roman rep- resentation of Judea, excellent and improved, I request you in Christ, if possible, that you beseech him through the agency of our Caspar [Boner], or other friends, that they send it for our use, either on loan, or purchase. And if the work seems worth- while, I will try to extort the money from our university's senate to buy it.75 Delano-Smith concludes that 'evidently nothing satis- factory was found and no map appeared'.76 While it is true that so far no map has been found included in the Lutheran Bibles printed in Wittenberg from 1522 onwards, this need not necessarily mean that Melanchthon's request was not fulfilled. It is notable that he writes in his letter 'aut precario utendum mit- tant aut vendant'. Clearly, Melanchthon's priority was to have an example in any case, 'bought or lent'. Thus the commentary to the standard edition of Luther's writings suggests that the map should in fact serve Luther and his assistants as visual aid during their work on the translation.77 One may ask here if the map could not have been used in the same way by a designer and woodcutter in Wittenberg to produce a chart of their own? As for the proceedings mentioned in the letter, there is indeed nothing that can be said for certain unless further documentary evidence is discovered. Nevertheless, the iconographie analysis of Cranach's map has shown that its main feature is the route of the Israelites to the Promised Land. It is therefore clearly not linked with the New Testament but rather with the five books of Moses. Luther immediately started work on their translation after the so-called September Testament was published in 1522. So Melanchthon's let- ter is of use in this context as a proof ex negativo : had such a monumental and detailed map as the one by Cranach already existed in Wittenberg, there would have been no reason to search for another one, es- pecially since Cranach's map, in spite of its special subject-matter, shows the whole of Palestine! So Melanchthon's letter, very likely written in March 1522, gives us another terminus post quern for its design. As has been said before, when discussing the use of the word 'Blachfeld', the first part of Luther's Old Testament translation, including the five books of Moses, was published in 1523.78 The analysis of the 75.

But only in some quires of the Old Testament was a Bull's Head found that is absolutely identical to the one seen in the map frag- ment in Cambridge (fig. 95)! 79 This even more precise dating of the watermark is not completely unexpected, yet the manifestation of such an immediate link with the actual printing process of Luther's Old Testament translation is still surprising.80 The question of a certain connection between this map and the biblical text was already raised in the Hollstein volume on Cranach in 1961. Long before the complete map was discovered, the editors, Karel Boon and Robert Scheller, had realized that it was copied for Das Alt Testament diitsch , published by the Zurich printer Christoph Froschauer in 1525.81 The copy is smaller, but still measures 275 x 400 mm, i.e. double folio size, printed from a single block (fig. 96): the sheet was vertically folded in the centre and bound in.82 The Zurich map repeats Cranach's design in reverse, following all the main features of the original very closely: the Exodus route with all its illustrations, the names of the Twelve Tribes, as well as the special feature of the straight line running from Dan to Beersheba. Further, there appear the same ships, those in the Mediterranean now bearing the coats of arms of the town of Zurich. The Zurich cartographical his- torian Arthur Dürst has further elaborated on the dependence of this map on Cranach's woodcut; this was finally confirmed after the complete sheet appeared in Jerusalem.83 Froschauer's first two parts of the Old Testament thus provide us with a decisive ter- minus ante quern for Cranach's map. The latter must have been designed between 1522 and 1525, and very probably printed in 1523. The Zurich map had its own progeny. Perhaps only two, but definitely within three, years it was copied again as a supplement in the Bibles of the Antwerp publishers Jacob van Liesvelt and Willem Vor ster man. 84 In the following decades three nearly identical copies were used in Antwerp Bibles by Vorsterman, Jacob and Hansken van Liesvelt, and Henrick Peetersen van Middelburch up to 1560. 85 Details like the Zurich coats of arms as well as the pro- portion of the whole map and the ratio of height to width make it clear that it was the Swiss version of the map and not Cranach's original that provided the model for these publishers. 79. This check was performed using the copies at the library of the Friedrich-Schiller-Universität in Jena and the Herzog August Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel; September- and December Testaments : 2 Th.xin, 5 and 6 (Jena) and Bibel-S. 4°258 and 259 (Wolfenbüttel); Das Allte Testament deutsch : 2 Th.xin, 4a (Jena) and Bibel-S. 4° 195 (Wolfenbüttel). In the Jena copy an identical Bull's Head watermark can be found in quires C and H, and in Wolfenbüttel in quires A, C, D, E and O. 80. It is, of course, clear that watermarks cannot generally provide the basis for a date as precise as even the month in which the paper was used. Paper could have been stored and gradually used over a long period of time. Yet in this case the demand for massive quantities of paper during the printing of no less than three editions of folio Bibles in only one year speaks indeed against any long-term storage, and suggests that whatever paper was available was immediately used up. 81.

Leemann-van Eick, Der Buchschmuck der ^urcher-Bibeln bis 1800 , Bern 1938, p. 22f., who was the first to give a comprehensive description of the Zurich map, was not aware of its dependence on Cranach. Considering the north orientation he nevertheless noted the reversed east-west direction. This led him to assume that the map must be a copy, the model for which he assumed to have been an upper Rhenish source. 82. In the Zurich copy (Zentralbibliothek: Zw 309) the map was inserted between the first and second parts of the Old Testament. It is now kept separately at 3 Nv 02. Another com- plete Bible with the map is in Cambridge (Trinity College: A. 10. 18). The two incomplete copies in Basle (University Library: F.G.V.22 No.i fol. and 52 No. 1 fol) do not include the map. 83. A.

The Zurich map is mentioned, but not catalogued, in Laor, op. cit., because it is lacking from the Jerusalem collection. Those responsible for the cartographic literature obviously missed the reference given by Boon and Scheller in Hollstein, vi. 84. Although Liesveldt's Bijbel: Oud en Meuw Testament of 1526 con- tains in the first part a note at the end of Exodus referring to a bound-in map ('Hier na volcht die Charte'), no copy containing the map has so far been located (W. NijhofT and M. E. Kronenberg, Nederlandsche Bibliographie van 1500 tot 1540 , 's- Gravenhage 1923, p. 135 no. 386). The earliest known is Willem Vorsterman's Oud en Meuw Testament , also printed in Antwerp in 1528 (Nijhoff and Kronenberg, op. cit., p. 139 no. 392). See Delano-Smith and Ingram, op. cit., pp. 26 and 137. 85. This, again, was first noted by Boon and Scheller in Hollstein, op. cit., p. 100, although they did not differentiate between three variants among the Antwerp copies. A detailed account of all three variants, together with a list of the Bible editions in which they were used, is given by Delano-Smith and Ingram, op. cit., p. 26, and pp. 137-39 f°r the Bible editions.</page><page sequence="21">CRANACH AS CARTOGRAPHER 143 96. Copy in reverse after Lucas Cranach the Elder, Map of the Holy Land , woodcut, 275 x 400 mm, from Dos AU Testament diitsch , Zurich 1525 (Zurich, Zentralbibliothek). At this point, we can neither prove nor rule out the possibility that Cranach's map was ever inserted into one of the Wittenberg editions of the Old Testament. It has nevertheless been possible to reconstruct the his- toric circumstances in which it was designed and printed (at least three times). The close examination of the map itself has shown that it is above all a biblical map, depicting in great detail the wanderings of the Children of Israel through the wilderness. Further, Melanchthon's letter makes it likely that the project was undertaken by Cranach around 1522, during Luther's work on the translation of the Old Testament, a conclusion that is reinforced by the material evidence gathered from the watermark on the paper. While Froschauer's copy fitted into his small folio Bibles in spite of its folio size, repeated folding would have been necessary to squeeze in Cranach's multi- sheet woodcut, which measures some 600 x 600 mm. If we therefore assume that it was not issued with a Bible, what other function might such a monumental woodcut chart have had? The traditional explanation of the map as a visual aid for the continuing work on the Bible translation is not really convincing. The iconographical analysis has instead shown that Cranach's design is to a large extent dependent on this translation. Furthermore, would the use as illustrative aid have been sufficient reason for the effort involved not only in the design but also in commissioning no less than six different woodblocks? The whole enter- prise only made sense if the publisher could count on a certain demand for his product. Unfortunately, there is no direct evidence to prove the existence of such a demand. It is possible, however, to suggest some func- tion that would be served by a map of this kind, and here Luther's assistant Melanchthon again proves to be a fruitful resource. He had a special interest in geography himself, and played an important part in</page><page sequence="22">144 CRANACH AS CARTOGRAPHER the selection of lecturers on this subject at Wittenberg University. His own views are characterized by a belief in a close connection between cosmography and geo- graphy, expressed for example in his De astronomia et geographia of c. 1536.86 Mixing cosmological as well as astrological ideas, these works illustrate the important influence Neoplatonic and Christian concepts had at the beginning of modern geography. Melanchthon's interest in its purely rational side was not however obstructed by these more spiritual ideas. He was very well aware of the crucial use that could be made of geography for historic as well as religious studies: what would we know about the contents of the Scriptures or the propagation of the Church, he asks, if we lacked an artful (visual) description of these regions? While we focus on these places in our daily prayer, would it not be a sign of mental indolence not to recognize where they are located physically?87 The importance Melanchthon ascribed to geographical charts was derived from these sorts of considerations. This repre- sented a completely new rôle for maps in the field of religious studies. Melanchthon described the study of maps as indispensable if the believer wants to know where the hand of God has ruled.88 For this reason he also compiled an Explicatio locorum Palaestinae, which is in large part based on the information he gathered from the study of the Bible.89 It is therefore not unlikely that Cranach 's map of the Holy Land might have been used in lectures on geography. We do know that such lectures certainly formed a component of the historically based Bible studies that were propagated by the reformers at Wittenberg University and elsewhere.90 The fact that only one complete example survives does not rule out such a possibility. Because of their size, maps have always been at risk from destruction. In addition, the probable use as study material suggests a further threat to the survival of these works. Woodcuts of coats of arms provide a telling demonstration of this point: originally the most frequently used genre of prints, they are among the greatest rarities to be found in print rooms today. With his map, Cranach stands at the beginning of a remarkable tradition of large-size Palestine maps depicting the Exodus. Notable within this group is the primům opus of the famous mapmaker Gerardus Mercator (1512-94), Amplissima Terrae Sanctae, executed in 1537 at Louvain as an engraving on copper, and measuring 430 x 980 mm; the unique surviving impression is preserved in the public library at Perugia.91 One year later, Wolfgang Wissenburg (1496-1575) published his Descriptio Palestinae Nova in Basle, this time a composite woodcut measuring 745 x 1,050 mm; here, too, only one impression is known, that in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris.92 Tilleman Stella (1525-89) is the first to refer explicitly to the depicted Exodus route, in the tide of his map Itinera Israelitorum ex Aegypto. This engraving, taken from nine copper plates, measures 675 x 750 mm, and was first printed in 1557 at Wittenberg, where Stella had entered the University in 1542. Two years later it was reissued in Antwerp.93 And while Jacob Ziegler's Palestine maps of 1532 are commonly seen as the start- ing point for all these 'modern' maps of Palestine,94 it must again be stressed that Cranach pre-dates Ziegler by a whole decade.95 86.
