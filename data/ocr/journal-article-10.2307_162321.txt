It is only when one turns to chapters 9-I that one can find any real attempt to study the impact of American military personnel on the Moroccans. Yet even here the evidence is disappointing, for it is generally limited to some public relations efforts at Kenitra. Except for one incon- clusive Red Cross (not Red Crescent) survey in Kenitra, no sophisticated questionnaires or interviewing techniques were utilized to reach the sweeping conclusion that a majority of Moroccans hold an idealistic image of the United States. The title Western Window in the Arab World is certainly misleading and the book scarcely lives up to the description on the jacket. LELAND BOWIE Temple University ALEXANDER ALTMAN, Studies in Religious Philosophy and Mysticism (Cornell University Press, Ithaca, N.Y., I969). Pp. 308. Since philosophy may alight anywhere, one age iL differentiated from another philo- sophically less by the substantive beliefs of the thinkers who set its intellectual tone than by their perceptions and blindspots as to what issues are problematic and what premises are to be taken for granted. The period of the 'great tradition' from Plato to Spinoza is thus divorced from our own in that while its intellectual leaders were in radical and often irreconcilable disagreement as to means, they were in substantial and often pro- found agreement as to ends. We, on the other hand, although until recently we could agree as to the method and means most likely to promote any chosen intellectual or practical aim, have been in deep and often unvoiced or unsensed conflict as to ends. To us in particular, there, it never ceases to come as a shock that in an age when matters which we would deem of formal interest at best could form the apologetic of wars of centuries, any schoolboy in the monotheist tradition, whether Muslim, Christian, or Jewish, or even a pagan whom the slippery arithmetic of Platonic ontology allowed to hold himself if he wished a monotheist, was able to state clearly, briefly, and without hesitation the purpose and meaning of life - in confident expectation that no educated man would differ with him. It was the common goal of medieval thinkings which allowed the remarkable cultural interpenetration and cross-pollination which make medieval thought so rich a field for the student of cross-cultural philosophy, the philo- sophical experimenter and the seeker of philosophical alternatives and controls. The purpose of life, of course, was in the consummation of human existence at the point of confrontation with or absorption in the Godhead. The mixing of ontological with epistemological categories in this vision was essential. For confrontation to be authentic it must be with an authentic existent; for absorption to be real it must involve a subjective transferrence which could only be predicated of consciousness. Indeed, for absorption to be complete it must be with the authentic existent, and for cognitive confrontation to be perfect it must be with the one Real. The Arabic usage of identifying Allah as al-Haqq, meaning at once the Truth and the one Real, is revealing in this regard. For, as Aristotle made crystal clear, a by no means trivial consequence of the correspondence theory of truth is that that which is most real should be most mani- fest; that which is most manifest, most real (cf. Metaphysics a 993 a). Yet the confinement of meaning within the mystic moment was not essential. To make the moment of fulfillment the be-all and end-all of existence would have been to accord it the rank reserved for God, and at once, paradoxically, to vitiate its thrust by diluting its appeal to that of just another strident monism. Rather it was necessary, if philo-</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 497 sophical mysticism was to have its effect, for the notion to be' ethicized', for the experi- ence to be allowed to overflow the confines of its moment, perfusion the rest of life. As in the thought of Aristotle, the point of culmination, because it was the purpose, gained priority of all that had preceded it: The end became the beginning. Only so was the meaning of living not lost with the discovery of the meaning of life. That embar- rassing span between a birth that was more truly a death and a death that was more truly a birth became a gradual, sometimes painful progress of purification, a slow sur- facing from the depths, the halting but never hesitant ascent of a summit whose elusive peak was never to be allowed to escape from view. The vision promised from that peak was of an inward, not an outward vista. For the soul would see no more, when it had completed the ascent, than had been manifest and present to it at the outset. It would gaze into the (now unsullied) mirror of the self and there perceive the mirror of its Maker. Gazing to the point where vision brings blindness and blindness sight, it would confuse self with God and God with self again, subject with Object and object with Subject - as must occur when mirrors face one another. It would understand, if capable of understanding, that it was for this moment of realization - one might have said of truth - that being had been allowed to spiral free of oneness at all, that in this moment was meaning enough to explain, value enough to justify all that had gone before. The triptych of mimesis (passive and active), ascent (mystical and dialectical), awakening (onto-epistemological and beatific) is no less hauntingly recurrent in the philosophical 'iconography' of the great tradition than is its visual counterpart in the art of the same period. And to the cross-cultural investigator its study is no less reward- ing; for the same images and symbols, arguments and ideas, clothed in alien garb and masked with foreign features will be represented from Andalusia to India and the Central Asian Steppes. Given the ' gift of tongues', the capacity to recognize analogies and determine differences while traversing the cultural barriers of idiom and manner which earlier thinkers, in the urgency of their quest, crossed with ease, our scholars would be granted understanding if not enlightenment, sympathy if not cross-cultural catholicity.' I Mimesis, from its very roots in biological mimicry is a sort of lie, a useful lie, but a lie nonetheless. The succulent Viceroy (Limenitis archippus) represents itself as a bitter Monarch (Danaus plexippus); metaphor masquerades as truth. For want of parity of terms, the argument from analogy must fail. And yet, in relationships of two terms, correspondences may succeed as well as fail or there would be neither truth nor like- ness. Only approaches, probabilities, family resemblances, perhaps, are possible, but without the possibility of things' being more like than unlike, more so than otherwise, reality itself would be submerged in Parmenidean identity and the very meaning of denying similarities would be lost. I Alexander Altmann's essays on 'The Delphic Maxim in Medieval Islam and Juda- ism', 'The Ladder of Ascension', and 'Ibn Bajjah on Man's Ultimate Felicity', along with much else in his recently published collection Studies in Religious Philosophy and Mysticism will provide welcome provender in the undertaking of such an attempt. Altmann is analytical, critical without being fussy, yet keenly sensitive to philosophical homologies. He skillfully disentangles the skeins of complex and consanguineous intel- lectual relationships, slighting neither kinship nor difference. These are the skills required of any who would learn the arts of translation and transformation required of those desirous to pass (without the superficialities of mere culture-hunger or culture-shock) beyond the confines of the womb of parochialism.</page><page sequence="3">498 Reviews The tradition does not claim that man and God are of the same kind and eschews Hume's Cleanthes' nebulous and rather blasphemous sounding slogan 'the liker the better' in favor of transcendence. Indeed it might be thought that here the infant notion of family resemblances first tested its philosophical bite: for the claim was that God was member of no species and no genus and at the same time that man was like Him. The claim defended as a matter of truth (and verifiable withal) by pagan Platonist, Jew, Christian, and Muslim alike - and not totally denuded of its meaning to this day - was that the one natural cureature who could not definitely be grouped with any other was to be grouped with a still more problematic being, a being problematic in existence as well as essence, whom it was all but a category error to describe at all - that man somehow, was divine.I The claim often made in jocularity that God created man in His own image and man returned the compliment preserves much of the ambiguity with which assertions of man's likeness to God are fraught. The irony of the common catchphrase, however, tends to obscure the fact that the work of godsmiths (who are always one another's harshest critics) is neither all that cynical nor all that crude. In both the Greek and the Semitic traditions the initial likening of man to the divine, on which so much is made to depend, comes from the mouth (and I use the term as advisedly as possible) of the god himself. And even before the two traditions come together in that confluence to which I refer as the great tradition2 (which only the renaissance, backed up by the ' enlightenment', was able to dam up) the efforts of the philosophical synthesizers and integrators were bent on transmuting that likening from a positive to a normative principle, not only in ethics but in theology itself. Thus the Delphic maxim, 'gnothi s'auton', we learn, was earliest interpreted in pious apprehension of any likening of man to god: 'know yourself': i.e. that you are human, not divine. The musings of Xenophanes on the racial characteristics of foreign gods are no Promethian 'anticipations' of Browning's Calliban, but expressions of the same pious transcendalism. By the time Plato had turned the Delphic maxim on its head, Xenophanes' bourgeois rejection of the morals of the divinities of Homer and Hesiod had been developed into a full scale theological critique. Only so could man's divinity be made an ethical notion, as expressed in Plato's interpretation of the task of the philosopher: to become as like God as humanly possible. And only out of such an 'ethicized' conception in turn could Plato's totally transcendent divinity, a Good beyond all representation, be born in the mind of man. For Jews, Christians, and Muslims the likeness of man to God was of course based on man's creation in the divine 'image' (a notion interpolated into Islam though that most protean medium, the hadith. Initially then, as in the Greek tradition, the resemblance was passive. Already in Old Testament times, however, the iconoclasm of Israel and the extreme hesitation and periphrasis used in talk of the divine attributes (except in language given a certain life of its own by idiom or song) indicate a sensitivity to the problem of anthropomorphism. By the time the two traditions, Greek and monotheist have merged - or rather by the time the 'wealth of the Egyptians', as Philo and follow- ' It must have required enormous reserves of intellectual self-discipline in the pagan Platonists to affirm this while denying the Christian corollary, that God, somehow, was human. For the taxonomy of man and God, cf. my forthcoming translation of Ibn Tufayl's .Hayy Ibn Yaq.zan. 2 The final map of the that philosophical region fortunately has not yet been drawn. But the life's work of Harry Austryn Wolfson is the chart of many of its principal land- marks: Philo, the Church Fathers and Origen, Augustine, the mutakallimun, Avicenna, Ghazall, Crescas and Maimonides, Aquinas, and Spinoza.</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 499 ing him Eusebius, chose to see it, had been appropriated and more or less organically incorporated, the relation of likeness had metamorphosed into what was to be by far the most effective of all regulative ideas: that man should strive for likeness to God, that in such striving were to be found those attributes of man which pointed most accurately to God: 'He who knows himself, knows his Lord', as Muhammad is supposed to have said - a double-edged notion since it might be used not only to perfect one's moral sensibilities and aspirations, but also to educate one's tastes in that most difficult of all judgmental areas: the choice of Gods. Thus as the analogy fails between man and God - as fail it must, ultimately - its plane is shifted to the normative, allowing mimesis to maintain, for both thought and action, and teleological import of its biological beginnings. II That the image of spiritual ascent should be widespread calls for no great archetypal or diffusionist explanatory apparatus. It is to be expected that those who seek might find - or at least presume themselves to have done - and having found, that they should point, if unable to lead, in the direction which they have followed. It is natural too that mimesis alone should appear in the end unsatisfying. But experiments in mimicry are not always dropped by the wayside when genuine evolutionary steps are to be taken. Often they are preserved vestigially as outward marks of the direction intended - not becoming a Monarch per se, but self-perfection. So too when the soul sets its sights on perfection, mimesis is not abandoned, but rather becomes a symbol and as such, in a way, an aid to the ascent. The earliest Greek myths and mysteries involve that most tempting of all human eroticisms, the broaching of divine precincts by man. To climb the slopes of Olympus, penetrate to the depths of Tartarus, share the food, the drink, the beds, even the sleep of the gods has been the human wish at least as long as it has been the human dream. Of the heroes whose names survive in legend it is those who had commerce with the gods who are first remembered, last forgotten. Surely it was because the poets knew this that these rather than some other songs were sung. Of the doings of the gods it is those which influence the lives of men that interest us. The postulation of gods who have no con- cern for the affairs of men is, as Epicurus realized, the surest death to theology, deadlier than any seemingly more potent concoction of gnosticism and agnosticism. For men will not long retain an interest in gods who have no interest in them - unless, of course, there is the prospect that such interest somehow, by offerings or prayers, by good works or ill (for the romantic like a rebellious child seeks to awaken God by acts of 'Titanic' rebellion, even if anger will be the only manifestation of divine concern), by spiritual or 'physical' ascent. This ascent itself, of course, and the prospect of divine response it brings rekindles the interest of the seeker, may even perfect him, and by so doing in a way may give him the object of his quest. Nor can it be claimed that this is ' merely' the re-echoing of his lonely cries to God, for this indeed may be one way in which God comes to men. Here again, then, we have a kind of 'sublimation' of the religious energies. The climb towards God reaches a certain point and then changes, not in its direction (for this is always toward the pole) but in its dimension. It would be crude to say the symbol has replaced its object, for this would be to deny the very efficacy of the symbol itself. Rather, the symbol has become its own translation. The Jacob's ladder of Bethel, the nocturnal ride of Muhammad, and Plato's ladder of love in the Symposium merge in the minds of the medieval thinkers whose role no longer is to climb with the angel-prophet-philosopher to the highest heaven, nor even to witness this vision alone and for themselves, but rather to look over another's shoulder,</page><page sequence="5">500 Reviews to see through the pages of books, to watch the seer watching, stunned by the beauty o his vision and to contemplate, in the quiet of some library or study, the single object which lay (as lay they knew it must) behind the symbols of the poets, prophets, and philosophical makers of myths. What all the symbols and symbolic language point to is the state of ecstasy, the exit of the soul from itself, from the bounds which had confined it, to a truer identity - whether achieved by long ascesis and sudden, sparking' awakening, or by dialectic and years of study in preparation for the final integration. The end in either case was the same. But the angles of Jacob's ladder were going down as well as up. Muhammad went to Jerusalem as well as Heaven; and he came back; and 'A'isha, his young favorite, swore that at no time that night was he absent from his marriage bed. For the progress was spiritual, not physical, and it had an earthward as well as heavenbound direction. In metaphysics, as in physics, ascent without descent is impossible. It was this inter- pretation which neo-Platonism put upon Heraclitus' commonplace observation of the identity of the upward and downward ways. And it was this which Plato meant in talking of the return to the cave (the return of Boddhi-satvas). Ascent would not be complete without return. Return would not be possible without vision. III Nothing can make clearer the role of philosophy in the 'great tradition' than Maimonides constant identification of the subject matter of physics (natural science) with the Act of Creation (Ma'ase B'reshit) and that of metaphysics (divine science) with the Act of Epiphany (Ma'ase Markabah). In terms of the neo-Platonic ontology these indeed would be the same subject, and the same result again can be (and was) derived from the Aristotelian epistemology through the tri-unity of knowledge, knower and known, a facet of Platonism which to Aristotle had seemed phenomenologically sound and therefore epistemologically indubitable. The outcome implied, of course, was a knowing which went beyond all knowing. The summit of ascent was the perfection of mimesis - man would be like God in having God and God alone as object of his con- sciousness. Indeed (as the tri-unity made crystal clear) man would be God - or, if piety preferred, at least it could not be denied that here knowing passed into act, the limitations of material subjecthood were left behind, and man would be in God - lose himself, die to himself, then die to his dying and so find eternal life. That it would be in such a way that the ancient promises would be fulfilled had been prefigured in the pagan mystery cults, and this the medieval monotheists well knew. Mysticism ('ilm al-mukdshafdt) was still to them a matter of revelation, of epiphany - a revelation to man of his potential (or actual, or peripheral) godhood. Thus it was a revelation to man of his potential (or actual, or peripheral) godhood. Thus it was a revelation of God to himself and the fulfillment of the most ancient of unfulfilled pro- mises, the fulfillment by revelation of the unfulfilled promise of creation: Here was the return which balanced and justified the great outflow of being to becoming - balanced the books of theodicy as it were, and by so doing justified all (and only) that which was capable of justification. Outflow and return, creation and revelation, balanced moments of the same great process, once, or perhaps forever in dynamic equilibrium. What then was the role of philosophy with respect to this? Surely not to bring it all about - that would have reeked of the rankest thaumaturgy and worse, against which the I The imagery of electricity runs with a current of its own through medieval talk of mystic awakening - cf. Ibn Sina, Ibn Tufayl, Maimonides, et al.</page><page sequence="6">Reviews 501 Platonic interpretation of creation-emanation had reacted. Gods were not waiting in the wings like some great Deus ex machina to be rung in on cue. So to conceive was the worst of bad faith, the least of little faith. Revelation like creation was a free act of divine grace - not grace on the archaic kingly model, but grace in the sense that all of nature and all cognizant beings shared in the divine grace of natural and moral law. The divine was present always, everywhere - it was for that very reason that no process could make it 'materialize'. (It was here perhaps more than anywhere else that Platon- ism lost its hold on the philophical mind - for the Platonists insisted longest, and in the end with a desperate dogmatism born of polemic, on the efficacy of such mechanical coercing of the divine.) Rather, like creation, the process was a natural, not a super- natural one, the perfecting (as Aristotle had long since recognized) of God-given potentials - or if it could be called super-natural, then all of nature was supernatural as well. Philosophy (and this Aristotle perhaps had not seen quite clearly enough) might aid in reaching the point where such a perfection might be attained, it might aid in the comprehension of what had or had not been achieved with the culmination of such an ascent, but never could philosophy be identified with that fruition, never could philo- sophy become the sufficient condition of such a culmination. The reason is plain: philosophy was a science, a study, an investigation, a direction perhaps, a hunger certainly - how then could it be at once the science and the subject- matter, the direction and the goal, the hunger and the satiety? All this Plato had shown to be impossible in the Symposium: That which wants cannot (logically cannot) have. Philosophy might contemplate transcendent experience, or it might indeed be that way of knowing which leads beyond knowing. But if so, it leads beyond itself, gazes or directs the gaze where it can no longer go - although it might be the necessary condition (or for some a neccessary condition) of such 'going'. No philosophical methodology can be interpreted except in terms of the alternatives whose rejection is implied in its adoption. Thus logical empiricism becomes incompre- hensible unless viewed against the background of the absolute idealism against which it reacted; while against that background, its rationalism (the coherence notion of truth, operationalism, deductivism, the search for certainty, etc.) is all but invisible. Again Aristotle's' realism' is comprehensible only in terms of his relation to Plato, but fromthis perspective his ethical, epistemological, even theological Platonism is often in danger of passing unnoticed. Even Aristotle's empiricism, viewed through the dusty atmosphere of centuries of scholasticism and the filters of Baconesque polemic may become invisible. For the medieval thinkers and writers of the great tradition mysticism was an ocean (this imagery is used by Ghazall, Ibn Tufayl, et al.), sparkling, dangerous, limitless. Philosophy was not, could not be identical with this ocean (the ocean of divine unity, as it was called). It was a means of surveying it, preparing for it, crossing it perhaps, perhaps surviving in it or even losing oneself in it. Medieval rationalism, in other words, was the narrow path along the sea - kept narrow and kept straight by the felt necessity of clinging as close as possible to the ocean and the felt impossibility of merging with it while remaining philosophical. Consummation was not search, and search was not consummation. We err if we judge the thinkers of the great tradition as some sort of small minded logical schemers, building ladders to God out of the thin air of a priori imagination (wish fulfillment) in the still more rarefied atmosphere of the mos geometricus. Reason for the medieval was not confined to the role of logical switch box for the relations of ideas. Its contents were not mere tautologies, for the bare bones of logic were fleshed out by the facts of experience, and empiricism had not yet brought to maturation that epistemological death wish which resulted in post-Cartesian metaphysics. Thus</page><page sequence="7">502 Reviews mysticism too, the unbridgeable ocean, was among the facts which reason was obliged to confront. The role of reason, always conceived of in terms of its opposite, unreason, the irrational, was in this regard, either to provide an alternative, a rational way to the goal which mysticism seemed so enticingly to offer, or to prepare the path, train the soul for embarking upon that ocean, the very existence of which was an invitation to passage. That is the role of reason was to bring man to a point beyond which reason itself might not pass. Reason when it considered these subjects (as consider them it must) was always in the service of mysticism: As in the famous dictum of Akiba that every letter of the Torah has a meaning. For here the rationalist's faith in the reasonableness of the cosmos (a fortiori of the divine word) is put in service of the unquestionable datum. Reason is set to wrestle with Paradox in full knowledge that paradox must win: Who so understands the 'dimensionality of the divine "body" has won the world to come'. Indeed! As if that were a truth susceptible of understanding, and as if 'the world to come' were another! Medieval thinkers were too honest to confine themselves to treating religious language as symbolic of a truth known best to philosophy (i.e. known best to themselves).' Such symbols were not mere allegories of the truths of reason but guides to something more, something real and therefore dangerous perhaps, to understand which would be to pass beyond understanding. LENN EVAN GOODMAN University of Hawaii INGE DEUTSCHKRON, Bonn and Jerusalem- the Strange Coalition (Chilton Book Company, Philadelphia, New York, London, 1970). Pp. x+357. Relations between Germans and Jews in the twenty-year span from the fall of the Third Reich to the establishment of full diplomatic relations between West Germany and Israel in I965 is the difficult and emotion-laden subject of this book. Inge Deutschkron, whose father was Jewish, grew up and lived in Germany through the difficult war years and most of the period described in her book. In I958 she became the resident correspondent in Germany for the popular Israeli daily Maariv, and her regular dispatches since then have added professional competence to her personal acquaintance with the subject. In her book Miss Deutschkron combines the fruits of research based on contemporary press and periodicals, numerous studies and memoirs, interviews with central figures in addition to her own personal experiences. The author traces the emergence of a new ' anti-semitism without Jews' in post-war Germany and analyzes its underlying causes. The German public first became conscious of a ' special obligation to the Jews' only in 949 after the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany. In fact, Miss Deutschkron maintains that West Germany's public conscience was awakened by the practical needs of the new German state to take its place in the family of nations. No one put it better than Adenauer himself when he said in I966: 'I tried to achieve reconcilation with the Jews because of the injustice that has been done to them and because of the fact that world Jewry is a power' (p. 27). The emergence of Israel made it possible for German-Jewish ' reconcilation' to be conducted on the plane of West-German relations with the Jewish state which, in fact, is the central subject of this book. The author leads us through the major issues of these complex relations: the problem of restitution; the Eichmann trial; the case of German scientists in the employ of Nasser; the question of the statute of limitations on I For even when they were mystics the best of them were never mystagogues.</page></plain_text>
