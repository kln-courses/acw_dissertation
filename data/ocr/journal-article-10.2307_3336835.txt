<plain_text><page sequence="1">FIRED BRILLIANCE Ceramic Vessels from Zaire University of Missouri-Kansas City Gallery of Art Kansas City, Missouri February 11-March 15,1990 Reviewed by Robert T. Soppelsa This exhibit included 54 ceramic sculptures from Zaire, most of which were taken out of Africa early in this century and now belong to a private Belgian collection. Pieces were shown from the four major regions of pottery production in Zaire: Lower Zaire, Western Kasai, Shaba, and Northeastern Zaire. Though jars, bottles, bowls, lidded bowls, and anthropomorphic vessels were all repre- sented, large water and storage jars were not. The pots were generally small, the largest being a Chokwe jar 37.5 centimeters tall. There was an ample range of forms, incised and raised surface decorations, sculptural decorative motifs, and surface types. Pots from the four regions were intermin- gled in the galleries, making it difficult for novices to identify the provenance of a given pot without reading the gallery labels. Luckily, these were well written and easy to find. Each piece was also well lit and given plenty of room. However, the arrangement was neither typologically nor regionally con- sistent: aesthetics apparently won out over didactics in the design of the show. Visitors were assisted by a map indicating the regions and groups represented in the show, gallery cards discussing the processes and types of pottery making in Zaire, descrip- tive labels for all the objects, and a few spec- tacular field photographs of pottery making and firing. To allow for close scrutiny, pots were displayed in small cases or on pedestals, PAIR OF ANTHROPOMORPHIC VESSELS. MANGBETU, ZAIRE. CERAMIC; LEFT 24.8cm, RIGHT 27.9cm.

Some pieces seemed perilously approachable, particularly consid- ering their age and fragility, but the small size of the gallery and good security apparently allowed the intimate presentation. Assembled early in this century, the collec- tion features uniformly fine examples. Potters in particular would appreciate this exhibit because of the high level of craftsmanship apparent in the pots. Some objects were par- ticularly well-made, including several pitch- ers from the Lunda decorated with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms, a large Chokwe jar, a Tio bottle of reddish color, a Sundi bowl with a marbled surface, and an anthropomorphic vessel by Chief Voania of the Woyo village of Muba. According to the gallery notes and catalogue essays, these pieces were for either ceremonial or domestic use. However, an examination of them led to the conclusion that few, if any, were ever used in Africa by Africans. Their surfaces were, by and large, new-looking and unpatinated, indi- cating that they had never served any domes- tic or ceremonial function. Although they represented types that had possessed some function in traditional cultures, few of these particular pots were ever used. "Fired Brilliance" was not grand in either size or scope. Nor did it pretend to offer a complete survey of Zairian pottery tradi- tions. However, it was one of the few exhibits ever dedicated to African ceramics; "The Potter's Art in Africa," a much larger show at the British Museum curated by Fagg and Picton in 1978, is the only other recent one that comes to mind. The UMKC gallery brought together a large number of terracot- ta objects, all from the same region of Africa, all quite fine, and all with some age pedi- gree, and presented them to the public sensi- bly and with respect. For this, it is to be applauded. The show was expertly and beautifully designed by Craig Subler, director of the gallery. As part of the exhibition program, Carol Spindel, a potter and author from Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, gave a lecture on February 22. It was entitled "Our Mothers Had More Courage: Senufo Women Potters." O Written by Patricia Darish of the gallery's staff, the exhibition catalogue includes a complete gallery list, essays on form, tradition, and tech- nique in Zairian pottery, a map, field photographs, and catalogue essays, along with full-page half- tone photographs of 21 objects exhibited. It is available from the UMKC Gallery of Art, 5100 Rockhill Road, Kansas City, MO 64110 for $15.00 plus $2.50 postage &amp; handling. 82</page></plain_text>
