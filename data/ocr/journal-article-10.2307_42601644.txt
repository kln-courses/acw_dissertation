<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Redwoods. By Richard St. Barbe Baker. No. 1 of The Famous Trees Library. Pp. 160, including 48 plates. George Ronald, London. Price 21/-. This is a beautiful book, very well printed and illustrated. It has an introduction by the Earl of 3* !Â°L</page><page sequence="2">102 THE EMPIRE FORESTRY REVIEW Bessborough, President of the Men of the Trees, and a typical preface from the Founder. Sixteen of the plates are not the author's photographs; it is rather difficult to find out which photographs - thirteen in all - are the work of the Moulin, Studios ("Gabriel Moulin of San Francisco greatest photographer of the Redwoods and his son") since the page numbers in the List of Illustrations do not always correspond exactly with the position of the plates in the text. The author explains that many of his best redwood studies were lost through enemy action in the London Blitz. Three of the plates were obtained from the National Parks Service. The author has a fascinating story to tell and he tells it with his usual dramatic flair. His own phographs are, as always, outstandingly good ; the need for two of them in a book on the redwoods may be questioned. His chapter headings are apt and chosen from authorities ranging from the Bible to Blake, Emerson and Ruskin. The first chapter puts the redwoods in historical perspective, in the Lytton Strachey manner, but using a much wider canvas. Next there is an account of the discovery of the Giant Trees first by General John Bidwell in 1841. It was in 1853 that news of the Redwoods reached London and the discovery was a "Ten days' wonder". There followed the Washington- Wellington controversy about the name, happily solved by the adoption of the neutral indigenous name of Sequoia, though it is news to your reviewer that this Indian chief had German blood in him. The chapter on the balance of nature reads like the scenario of a traditional Western or still more like, perhaps, a Disney pastoral symphony. It has all the ingredients, a log cabin with friendly chipmunk, a faithful mare, hero lost in woods, "asking the Trees", the storm, fire following the storm, fatigue (mainly to the mare) after a long day in the open air, happy ending when the fire is suppressed, then a wonderful dream of prehistory in the groves (but that is in another chapter - for another film?). The history of the preservation of the Coastal Redwoods is very well told and the illustrations show just how well worth saving they were. If the climatic conclusions are not always according to Kittredge that is to be expected, and perhaps even condoned, in a book of this kind. The Save the Redwoods campaign is to be com- mended by all foresters and its success is an encouragement to a much wider segment of public opinion throughout the world. It has saved a wonderful region for posterity. The chapter on Lesser Tree Brethren continues the anthropomorphic trend of the book. They of course, include the Monterey pine ( Pinus radiata ), a better traveller than the redwoods, if less glamorous, as well as many other well- known species from the Pacific States and British Columbia. St. Barbe Baker is to be congratulated on assembling such a feast, particularly for the eye, within the compass of 160 pages. Further numbers of the Famous Trees Library will be awaited with interest. W. MacF. Robertson.</page></plain_text>
