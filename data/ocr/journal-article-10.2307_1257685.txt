<plain_text><page sequence="1">SYNCRETISM IN A SYMBOL Presidential Address, i6th February, 1938 SOME of us may remember the pleasant game of picture bricks with which we were allowed to entertain ourselves in childhood on Sunday afternoons. The two scenes most popular were Moses in the ark of bulrushes and Daniel in the Lions' Den. We delighted in piecing together the cradle among the flags and the Egyptian princess, and also, not Daniel so much, as the sturdy lions, eyes glaring and jaws agape, which did not dare to approach the prophet. These were noble beasts of a different order from the highly stylised creatures which represent them in the symbol chosen as our theme to-night. This introduction starting from a children's nursery offers little hope of the oracular utterance which previous honourable presidents have stated as expected from this yearly address, and I confess that I have set out to walk lightly by the winding path of a symbol rather than to climb the stair leading to a dogmatic pulpit. On our way we are guided by the findings of archaeologists and they are the last people to venture on oracle or dogma, since they know that the latest mound excavated or frag- ment of sculpture recovered from a ruin may give evidence destructive of long-cherished theories. I hope that the path we follow with them will not be judged remote from the interests of folklorists. On our own path also we have the same experience of beliefs suddenly overthrown by the discoveries of research, for while Daniel was under review as the carrier of a special symbol the ground opened to fresh revelations under our II</page><page sequence="2">12 Presidential Address feet. We are told by scholars competent to interpret texts recently discovered at Ras Shamra that at the writing of the book bearing his name Daniel was merely a symbolical hero. The wisdom always reverentially associated with his name was rightly attached, but the Daniel who had earned this repute was a more ancient king, noted for wisdom in the earlier age of Ezekiel. In the light of this discovery the adventures of the prophetic book may have been only in- stances of courage and successful resistance of persecution cited to dispel fears and discouragement during a rigorous suppression of Jewish ideals. The historical figure however is retained in this study as source of the emblem, for it had lived a long life as real man in the beliefs of Western com- munities, with a persistent fame for success in resisting tyranny and for wisdom in judgment. The allusions to Daniel which follow, therefore, are made, I think justifiably, in keeping with the traditional belief of the late pre- Christian and early Christian eras. This society claims that the term folklore comprises beliefs about charms, amulets, and everything which expresses the psychology of the folk, we may therefore be allowed to follow an emblem of trust in a power to overcome harmful things in its travels over the world in metal, stone, ivory or textiles. Here even the form has a meaning, and as it develops in symbolism it gives the excitement of a chase till, as a charm, it is stylised almost beyond recognition. The pattern was widely known and was convenient for decoration, that of a figure erect with arms outstretched or lifted up in the oriental attitude of prayer, called an orans. We study it here as it stands between two beasts, lions, griffins or other monsters, confronting, sometimes with heads turned aside, or back to back. This motif of two animals in symmetry, alone, beside a deity, royal person, sacred tree or a vase has a long history. It was in use wherever artists carved, in Chaldea, Mesopotamia, Persia,</page><page sequence="3">Presidential Address 13 Assyria, India and Egypt. When it appears in Europe it is generally recognised as a mark of eastern influence. A distinguished French archaeologist writes: " We have a strange impression, almost a shudder (effroi is his word), when we find this Eastern figure, thousands of years old, in our romanesque churches. We pass through a rustic village, enter the little village church, and the first thing we see is the tree guarded by lions, which stood, four thousand years ago, before a Chaldean temple. We are transported to the cradle of the world." This symmetry was the expression of a mysterious harmony. The trees, one of life, the other of truth, stood at the entrance to the dwelling of the gods, each with its guardian beast to ward off evil spirits. The design was taken over by Islam and its introduction to Europe was probably by means of the textiles brought from the east. A notable example of it is on the Syrian material worshipped at Chartres as the tunic of the Virgin. In these rich materials birds and griffins often displace the lions; these too were copied in Europe, where they in their turn are occasionally displaced by the favourite gazelle. The design was, as we all know, a familiar one on seals. On a lentoid gem, from Kydonia in Crete, the design is almost identical with some representations of the Daniel design. On this a human figure stands upright with arms outstretched, under them are the two lions, sitting erect, one under each arm, symmetrically placed, all four legs turned to the central divinity as he is taken to be. They are posed almost as worshippers. Sir Arthur Evans, studying the gem in its historical setting, explains the figure as an anthropomorphic development of the central tree with its branches. It is remarkable that it should resemble so closely the design with Daniel the central figure in the orans attitude. Although in Egypt, according to Sir Flinders Petrie, a</page><page sequence="4">I4 Presidential Address conqueror is not represented as trampling on beasts emblematic of his foes till after the Semitic conquests, he has his lions by him at an earlier date; they stood one on each side of him as he set out to war, guardians in the symmetrical pattern, and we recognize the same motif in the uplifted heads of the uraei or serpents on each side of a royal cartouche. Soon after this we find the central figure as conqueror with subjugated beasts on either side. The design was there, pleasing to the eye and useful in compo- sition, ready for the artist to use in any sense desired as it passed from country to country expressing a concept com- mon to many different cults. It established itself as an emblem of conquest, and with this symbolic value also it comes from the East. I hope that we shall not be accused of dallying with the " sentimental obscurities " which recent critics decry in British exponents of Indian art when reference is made to Indian drawings. They seem apposite here, so we must have the courage to introduce them. They are from draw- ings found in caves among the Mahadeo hills in central India. These drawings have continued in a series coming down, as it is believed, to the thirteenth century, derived from older models. One is a representation of a man stand- ing between two struggling beasts above a group of domestic animals, taken to be Gilgamesh as Protector of Herds. In the same series is another figure of a man or a demon stand- ing between two tigers bound to him but trying to get free. It is a mere sketch but gives an impressive picture of power over resisting beings. Both these drawings of primitive art are planned in symmetrical form, and we need not fear the charge of obscurity for this was a chosen means of repre- senting Gilgamesh in many more imposing monuments. It is quoted from the cave drawings here as showing that it was known to and the common property of designers in all spheres of life.</page><page sequence="5">Presidential Address 15 As emblematic of power we see it in the graceful design of a goddess, probably Ishtar, taming birds. In Egypt in a similar design the introduction of a mother type as an earth goddess has been detected. But in this region the figure of Horus Triumphant standing on two crocodiles brings us nearer to the symbol we are studying to-night. We have established the great age of the design and the concept it now expresses may claim a past equally venerable. The belief in a power to overcome the vexatious, puzzling, never-ceasing troubles which beset human life reveals itself in the earliest records. In this society where distinguished presidents have led us questing over vast areas of research on the subject we are acquainted with the earliest heroes of conquest over titanic monsters. The tale of victory has been told in ritual and myth, sacred history and popular drama, and we follow the same lines when, with archaeolo- gists, we are able to discover the theme in metal and stone. It is to Daniel as inheritor of this r81e that we are approach- ing, and he seems to have entered upon his inheritance early in his history. For many reasons his story was a favourite, it was one of the first told on the walls of the catacombs, and by the second half of the first century it has begun its career established in the form of the prophet at prayer between two lions, victorious by spiritual power from heaven, em- bodying conquest of brute force. When it appears as a charm it has passed by Alexandria and picked up the threads of a pattern developed in the cult of another saint, not in stone, but in the fragile substance of terra cotta. In Alexandria any connection was possible. This famous city, as we all know, was one of the most eminent homes of syncretism. Arrived here we are among faiths of the most conflicting kind, where Gnostics tried to discover and make known a central unity. Egyptian deities were transformed under the Greek teaching intro- duced by Alexander the Great, and the Roman world, later,</page><page sequence="6">16 Presidential Address found itself face to face with Islam. The Jewish quarter also brought its powerful influence to bear, it was renowned for its magnificent synagogue and its wealth. When Christian doctrine followed it found itself confronted with problems as difficult as any it had previously known; Gnostics were hardly successful in the attempt to make its authority clear, and Alexandria was the centre of constant discussions and refashioning of creeds. It was a suitable birthplace for the new meaning with which the ancient design emerges. The story of Daniel had special developments in the Rabbinical apocrypha, which gives the story of the second test among lions and of the judgment of Susannah. In the account given in Bel and the Dragon,- Daniel is set among seven lions when he is condemned for the second time to be thrown into the den. During this second trial he is sustained by the prophet Habakkuk led by an angel to bring him bread. Habakkuk is portrayed beside Daniel for several centuries and the loaves passed through a special symbolism in Christian art. The number of the lions is worth noting, for this number, seven, was of significance in Jewish tra- dition. Both good and evil spirits are referred to as seven in number; far back, in the time of the Chaldeans, the evil beings who fight the god Sin are in a company of seven. In mediaeval times, above all other numbers seven had a mysterious meaning, combining three, the figure of the soul, with four, that of the body. Seven planets controlled the seven ages of man and among other groups we may remem- ber the Seven Sleepers, the Seven Sages of Rome and the Seven dormant birds of winter. Seven was a suitable num- ber for Daniel's lions. In a Byzantine guide to painters compiled from instructions given by one Ponsellinus, known as the Giotto of the Byzantine school, it is laid down as a canon that Daniel should be represented with seven lions, Habakkuk with the loaves, and the angel. A beautiful</page><page sequence="7">Presidential Address 17 miniature in a copy of the Mirror of Human Salvation, dated 1350, is reproduced by Didron from the library of Lord Coleridge; here the artist follows the Byzantine rules, with seven peaceful lions under a tree. The number two pre- vailed, however; this was the symmetrical pair of the hero motif, and a group of seven would have been unmanageable in the charm. Habakkuk continued for a time even with the two lions. The tale of Susannah was not forgotten, it was read as a lesson during September in the churches till after the time of Elizabeth and the story of Daniel's defence of Susannah may have strengthened the reputation for wisdom, taken over, it seems, from a royal prototype. Was this in Shakes- peare's mind when he makes Shylock exclaim after Portia's summing up of the famous case, "A Daniel has come to judgment " ? For Portia like Daniel was a youthful judge and Shakespeare's mastery in handling legend to give the right colour to a theme needs no comment in this society. Readers of the fournal will remember the references it gives to his insight into popular legend and its set- ting. But we must halt to follow the history of the symbol and return to that maze of legend which was Alexandria. Here among the Copts we find Daniel playing a part in the life of Alexander which connects him especially with the city. The Coptic account of Alexander's interview with learned rabbis differs from that of the mediaeval " History ". It describes his amazement on learning that his career had been foretold in a vision of the prophet, and portrays him as so overwhelmed by this proof of Daniel's prophetic power that he instantly proclaimed himself a convert to the wor- ship of the Hebrews' God. This conversion does not arise from the interview with the rabbis in other versions of it. The story gave rise to or perhaps explained various tra- ditions of Daniel in the Christian Church. In a note to the B</page><page sequence="8">I8 Presidential Address Roman Martyrology' Baronius refers to the belief that Daniel's relics had been translated from Babylon to Alexandria and, with those of the three Hebrew youths saved from the fiery furnace, placed in the church dedicated to the saints Cyril and John; from the same source came the story of a later translation of the relics to Venice. Of the three youths the Copts had a different story, interesting enough to be retold here.2 According to this, the patriarch Theophilus had built a basilica in their honour and desired that their relics should be brought to be enshrined there. A Coptic monk was deputed to go to Babylon in search of them; he set off riding on a cloud, after the fashion of an Egyptian deity, and was conveyed directly to the proper burial place. On delivering his message he was assured that the youths could not leave their tombs and there were no means of removing their bones to Alexandria. As they were unable to fall in with the wishes of Theophilus they declared, however, that they would honour the basilica in another way on the day of its dedication. That evening every lamp in the building was prepared with oil and a wick, these left unlit according to instructions given to the messenger monk, and when the moment of dedication arrived all the lamps were lighted simultaneously by miraculous power. This legend, as most of us will recog- nize, has its special justification in the connection between the flames subdued in the furnace by the faith of the youths and the lights which came from heaven in their honour. Whether the relics were brought to Alexandria or not, a church was built in Daniel's name beside the tomb of Alexander, which deflected to itself the worship attending the emperor's monument. Many miracles were reported and the prophet inherited the saintship pertaining to his 1 This reference kindly given from St. Augustine's Abbey, Ramsgate. 2P. Saintyves, Les Saints Successeurs des Dieux (1907) , p. 31 f.</page><page sequence="9">Presidential Address 19 record in the Hebrew scriptures. Alexandria had earlier claimed an apostle, St. Mark, as the founder of its Christian church, and now claimed benefits also from a prophet. When ecclesiastical Councils met, such claims conferred honour and the right standing. It is however by way of a Coptic saint that he seems to have acquired the peculiar design of his charm, the Egyptian St. M'nas, who suffered martyrdom about the year 295 under Diocletian. While making ready for his slaying he in- structed his followers to lay his body after death on the back of a camel, which would bear it away and stop at a spot ordained for its burial. This story connects him with one camel, but he is usually represented with two, one on each side in symmetry, their long necks bent awkwardly as they lay their heads at St. M6nas' feet. Though overcome by martyrdom he adopts the symbol of the conqueror and was one of the most notable causes of its use in Europe. His shrine near Alexandria was visited by pilgrims from every part of the Christian world and he became the special patron of travellers in the desert. The emperor Arcadius built a basilica in his honour not far from Alexandria; during excavations here in 1905 thousands of flasks or ampullae in terra cotta adorned with his device were found under the ruins of the deserted building. These were pre- pared for pilgrims to carry away, filled with oil from sacred lamps or with water from a neighbouring well; they have been found in the remotest corners of Europe and are treasured in many museums. The circular shape of the flask compelled the long-necked camels to be represented as bending their heads, as has been said. The camel was an emblem of submission, but on the flasks crocodiles are also found, erect. These suggest a connection with Osiris and the crocodile who bore his mummy on its back, as has been pointed out by a French authority. Syncretism is evident here, for the camel as well as the crocodile has a typhonic</page><page sequence="10">20 Presidential Address reputation. Coptic art, in full bloom in the third century, combined features from various models, Asiatic and African. Nothing seemed incongruous where cults from different ages and places stood together on the same plane, where we find Anubis at the entrance to an inner grave in the dress of a Roman legionary. Camels and crocodiles dis- cover a kinship which enables them to change places agree- ably in a design, which in its conventionalised form was known in every art workshop in Europe. And Alexander himself steps into the symmetrical pattern, but not in the character of a conqueror. Suitably, with a moral teaching, he has been represented in this pattern in the cathedral of St. Mark's at Venice ; he is found again on the pavement of the great church at Orvieto, and carved in stone on the facade of Borgo San Donnino. These had their origin in the remarkable legend told in the French gestes, known to the many pilgrims who visited Italy. According to these Alexander became possessed of a desire to penetrate to the secrets of the highest heavens. He took two griffins captive and imprisoned them three days without food. On the third day he visited them with a yoke to which he had them bound. He seated himself on a seat fastened to the centre of the yoke, holding aloft in each hand a lance, at the point of which an animal's liver was impaled. The famished griffins spread their wings and rose from the ground in the attempt to seize the livers. For seven days they carried Alexander to the skies until they were met by a celestial being who ordered them back to earth and rebuked Alex- ander for his pride. The scene was adopted from oriental art and thence found its way into the Gestes. The griffins and the lances with the livers are designed symmetrically, with Alexander as the central figure. In this the idea is the futility of human pride when unaided by Divine power. We have traced the scene of Daniel in the catacombs and will follow it in its later association with burial places and</page><page sequence="11">Presidential Address 21 sarcophagi. One of its most interesting appearances is on an engraved cup of glass discovered some years ago in an ancient tomb at Podgoritza in Montenegro, where it is one item in a series of saving miracles-with Jonah saved from the whale, the three Hebrew youths from the Furnace and Susannah from the Elders. Each scene has its legend which makes identification certain (Revue Archdologique, xxxviii, 1879, E. Le Blant). These four instances were favourites in this connection, and of the four, three are from the story of Daniel; we find them again on sarcophagi. On the tombs the artist reproduced in carving some of the figures invoked in funeral liturgies, adding also at times the formulae used. These ran : Deliver the soul of Thy servant as Thou also deliveredst Enoch and Ely from common death Noah from the flood Abraham from Ur of the Chaldees Job from his passions Jonah from the whale Isaac from the knife of his father Abraham Moses from the hand of Pharaoh Daniel from the lions' den The three youths from the flames Susannah from false accusers and so on to Christian times, proceeding with cumulative force to give evidence of a long history of triumph over evil in many forms. These liturgical invocations were early in use; inherited from Jewish formulae by the Christian church, they are recorded in several MSS. Pronounced by the grave, they admitted the dead to the tabernacles of the just and the banquet with saints, this also sometimes re- presented by the sculptor. This banquet scene where the dead sit eating food in communion with the saints brought the assurance that he now was of a nature purified as their own.</page><page sequence="12">22 Presidential Address M6nas, one who had fallen a victim, could not be cited among those miraculously saved from persecution and had no place among conquerors, but his cult was popular in the south of France; he had an oratory at Arles, where noted sarco- phagi are known with scenes of Daniel and of Susannah. Not every instance called to mind in the liturgies was suitable for sculpture, but especially two of the four above mentioned were eminently so, and of these Daniel and the lions was the chosen scene, pleasing to the artist in stone and easily intelligible. The widespread circulation of the pilgrims' flasks and lamps, with the device of the Egyptian saint between the fawning camels, their heads laid on the ground, made him a familiar figure in the orans attitude already associated with Daniel. Since the prophet's shrine in Alexandria was visited by pilgrims, he also may have been depicted on ampullae. Langland, in his Vision of Piers Plowman has a pilgrim carrying many pilgrims' signs, who said he had been In Armonye and Alisaundre, In manye othere places. So pilgrims set out to Alexandria from Britain. But it is on buckles we find the pattern we are studying and the buckle does not derive from Egypt. On the buckle the motif becomes a charm. Its power was not only that of the ancient hero, it now brought the assurance given by the mention of Daniel in the liturgies and his prominent place on sarco- phagi, and in the charm the lions lick his feet. This deriva- tion of the popularity of the emblem as known on the M6nas flasks was made by Sir Martin, later Lord, Conway, it has been accepted by the Danish archaeologist, Brondsted, and by some archaeologists in this country. There may have been other channels, but the influence of the countless pilgrims' flasks on popular feeling must have helped an adoption of the motif by the buckle whether they were the main cause or not. These buckles have been found in many</page><page sequence="13">Presidential Address 23 parts of what was once Burgundy, chiefly in Savoy and in Switzerland; it is believed they were worn by soldiers going to war. The buckle is said to be of Germanic origin, it has not been found in Gaul. The motif distinguishing it became a common one in Germanic metal work. Some- times the origin has been forgotten and not only lions but dragons and other monsters cringe before Daniel or lick his feet. The dragon is not so irrelevant as it may seem. Lions were almost as strange to Europeans as dragons or even hypocamps. The lion had become a legendary beast and in legend the dragon was almost his equal. Many districts had a legendary dragon which impersonated mis- chief and depredation. The protruding, licking tongue of lion, griffin, dragon or other monster is seen as a constant feature. It had two favourable characteristics which recom- mended it to the decorative artist and craftsman, a graceful curve and a pliability which enabled it to fill a space. It is interesting to trace the ingenuity of the artist in handling this no longer unruly member with its reference to sub- jugation. I am not guilty of suggesting that every lolling tongue of a beast represented in mediaeval metal work or stone is introduced with a symbolic meaning, but when it occurs on each side of a head on a stone capital or on a plaque it may be studied in connection with the old pattern. The beasts may stand upright, but the tongues, projected towards a central figure or only a head, may bear the original meaning. After hunting far over the hills we should now be able to turn home and speak of this emblematic Daniel in Great Britain, but we do not find it often here. Possibly St. George with his dragon usurped its place. In Scotland there are stones with a man, perhaps Daniel, and lions. In a study presented to the International Congress of European Ethnology and Folklore at Edinburgh, in 1937, by Miss Mary Boyle, the lecturer proposed to treat these carvings as of</page><page sequence="14">24 Presidential Address local significance, the lions being the Scottish states. From any point of view they are remarkable. On three stones there are four lions grouped round the central figure, two above the outstretched arms, and these project the tongue as if to lick the man's face. When, as in Iona, the lions stand upright, the tongues still project; it is evident that they have moved up from the feet. Once, at Meigle in Perth- shire, they and the man are carved under a hunting scene. 0 0044000000000000000000 Dooc~ c c ~P~o 00 AtIt 4P P00 1 o: ,O 000 00o 60 O 0 0 A 00 :~:o Oooo 0 %qQ! .? .

With the kind permission of the Trustees of the British Museum. There are stones carved with this scene in Ireland which have both seven and two lions or monsters; Mademoiselle F. Henry explains them as an emblem of the crucifixion, but this intorpretation is hardly in keeping with the history of the design. It is found on a Manx cross in a form so stylised as to be almost unrecognisable to any but very practised eyes. On a Norman sculpture on the west front of Lincoln cathedral Daniel is seated, draped and holding a book, with five lions grouped about him. In the parish church of Sea- ford in Sussex is a carved stone capital of the thirteenth</page><page sequence="15">Presidential Address 25 century which has Daniel in a more conventional pattern, with the two lions ; the prophet hangs head downwards and the beasts discreetly turn away their heads as if afraid of yielding to the temptation of attacking a man in so helpless a position. Although the design is strictly symmetrical it shows no recollection of the orans figure, and seems to be in a different line of descent. It is late and may owe its origin to the independent invention of an English artist. The lion represents evil also when it is depicted struggling with Samson who tears its jaws apart. The Daniel design as a charm is to be seen as part of a chatelaine in the British Museum; it is of Frankish work but was not found in England; it comes from Amiens and was found there. There is an attachment with Daniel as a motif in the Ash- molean Museum; it too comes from near Amiens. Without his lions, also, Daniel was believed to bring pros- perity. At Susa so strong was this belief that his body was taken each year to a different side of the river to confer its benefits on each in turn. The struggles to possess it grew so fierce that king Sangar ordered it to be suspended in a glass case on a bridge exactly above the middle of the river. A legend says that gold fish were always found in the water beneath it, and any godless person attempting to pass it by instantly fell dead. The charm in metal stands at some distance from the aristocratic presentation of Daniel and his lions in mosaic, on the ivory of a pyx, in textiles or enamel. The buckle with Daniel as its figure is found in many museums and seems to have come into being in response to a popular demand. In spite of the glory and splendour of a long history behind it, it took its popular pattern as a humble mascot, maintaining an ancient form as it moved with changed reference from place to place. Like a folk tale, to those who understand the reference, it tells the story of the varying conditions through which it passes. It seems a simple thing hanging on</page><page sequence="16">26 Presidential Address a lady's chatelaine or attached to some part of a soldier's dress, but we have traced the complexity of its record and are compelled to recognize it as a signal instance of the syncretism revealed also in rites and customs which we observe in life's round today. The conquest theme is recognized, again modest of form, in the Mumming Plays, devoid of any pretence of decoration or magnificence. A hidden treasure of country folk, they emerged at Christmas with humorous by-play and comic interludes and their true character was hardly suspected by the company which looked at them patronizingly from windows or doorways of comfortable country houses. But many years have gone by since Sir Walter Scott observed these figures and added to his description of maskers the lines : Who lists may in their mumming see Traces of ancient mystery and recent studies fully worked out in Folk-Lore leave them clearly revealed as of, the same parentage as Daniel in his r6le of conqueror. Each year they came out with their old-time burden of life renewed after the struggle with darkness in the shadows of the underworld and the death of summer's beauty in seasonal recurrence of storm and chill. The great lord of earthly conquests however was not dead; expelled from the cults of the city he founded and his place there taken by a prophet and Christian saints, his career is not ended. We find him risen again from his ashes in romance and surviving through many centuries as a prominent figure of legend. He attached to himself count- less wonders of chivalry as he moved with ladies and knights, went hunting with Aristotle, imprisoned Gog and Magog, undertook high ethical argument with Brahmin philoso- phers, or penetrated to the mysterious home of souls</page><page sequence="17">Presidential Address 27 awaiting Paradise. In Scotland, where kings proudly adopted his name, he was perhaps better known than in England. His conquests were said to have ended there, according to the old rhyme: ...... Alexander, king of Macedon Who conquered all the world but Scotland alone. When he came to Scotland his courage grew cold, To see a little nation courageous and bold. It was a fashion of mediaeval times for parents to name their sons after heroes of well-known tales. A famous printer of Nuremberg during the days of Erasmus named his three sons Caspar, Melchior and Balthasar, after the oriental kings. The famous narrative of an Alexandrian Greek of the second century was the original source through Latin trans- lations of this legendary activity.in Europe, but the peoples had now developed their mediaeval love of marvels and Eastern tales, and romancers were unhindered by any scruples from treating Alexander as a convenient peg on which to hang their fancies and excursions in rhyme. A selection of folklore from this collection would carry us far beyond the limits of our subject which left Alexander with his two griffins in the symmetry of our pattern. Design had its way also with him, for in literature he ascended to the high heavens with four griffins or even seven, not two. A strange transformation now takes place. Daniel in his humble symbol represented victory, but Alexander in this new romantic life of his takes his place in pageant, tapestry and verse as one of those Nine Nobles or Worthies who fell by the misfavour of Dame Fortune before their time or by the power of enemies. Fortune with the remorseless wheel had captured the imagination of poets, misfortune marked a man for its own not through any fault of his but by an</page><page sequence="18">28 Presidential Address unreasoning caprice. A recent study of the subject coming from an American author traces this theme from classical times till, as he seems to prove, man once more is discovered master of his fate in the plays of Shakespeare where his destiny is determined by his character and not by the stars. Every poet or dramatist of repute linked his characters to the wheel turned by blind fortune. Gower commented, he has many similar reflections: For every worldes thing is vein, And evere goth the whiel aboute And evere stant a man in doute. Fortune stant no while stille, Now hier now ther, now to now fro, Now up now down, this world goth so, And evere hath don and evere schal. And round go the Nine Worthies, rising and falling again, as the goddess turns the wheel. They seem to have found their way here in a poem, The Vows of the Peacock (Les Vceux du Paon), which was part of the Alexander cycle; and it was at the last in this round of heroes that Alexander the Conqueror found a place and kept his fame. In this, as said above, we have a curious reversal of r6les ; the nine victims of unreasoning chance are clothed in imposing and courtly dress, while the figures embodying the ancient and recurring triumph wore homespun or were turned out of the workshop, when they were not forgotten, in the baser metals. The Alexander legends are mentioned in this study as a contrast and as an illustration of the changing ideals of the Middle Ages. These, too, the ancient faith in victory has survived as we note it in the plays which, while they make no mention of Daniel, stand closely related to him in descent. Both have relations with the combat and conquest in sacred ritual; after the manner of folklore, however, they</page><page sequence="19">Presidential Address 29 continued an observance of the theme in their own peculiar way, more prized, perhaps, because, carried out to the high- ways, it was seen to shine even there with a gleam of its old pride. M. M. BANKS. Note.-The keeper of the Ashmolean Museum has kindly explained that many of these Daniel designs in metal have been found in women's graves; they may have been worn in Burgundy but we do not know that they were fashioned there. The piece in the museum at one time labelled Bur- gundian was found near Amiens.
