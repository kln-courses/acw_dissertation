<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY CAPTIVE COLONIES OF TAMIAS STRIATUS This paper records observations froin June 1955 to June 1957, on groups of Tamias striatus in an outdoor cage in St. Louis, Missouri. Daily notes were taken and each June the burrow systems were carefully excavated for study. The authors previously investigated natural burrow systems in Wisconsin (Jour. Mamm., 37: 23-31, 1956) and summarized other field observations on this chipmunk (Ibid., 38: 192-196, 1957). The only previous investi- gation in an outdoor cage of the type used here was that of Engels (Ecology, 32: 549-555, 1951), but he did not describe the nature of the burrows. Methods.-The wire-mesh cage (Plate I, above), 91/2 X 51/2 X 3 feet above ground, extended 3 feet below the surface where it terminated in cinders. There were no escapes. To locate points within the cage the area was designated by the numbers 1-19 along the sides and the letters A-K along the ends. A box with ten compartments with wire-mesh rear walls and 2 X 2 inch openings to the cage was fastened to the south wall. For 1956-1957, an artificial burrow was prepared with a 2-inch pipe as its entrance leading to a wire- masonite cage 12 X 12 X 8 inches, 24 inches below ground. The chamber was located at J-2, the surface entrance at F-1. Purina laboratory chow, in a wire feeder, and water were available at all times, even during freezing weather when fresh water was added daily. Loose chow and fresh foods as well as abundant nesting material were frequently made available. At the beginning of each experiment, on 16 June 1955 and on 25 September 1956, eight Wisconsin animals in their second year of captivity were marked and released into the cage. On 1 June 1956, and on 7 June 1957, the survivors were captured and their burrow systems studied in the manner described by us previously. Observations.-The captive animals never became tame, and although several took food from the hand, they could never be touched or handled. Most retreated to their burrows when approached. There was no serious fighting among the animals. The suspended com- partments were used promptly by most. Food was taken to these sections before the burrows were established and at intervals thereafter. The artificial burrow was also promptly used, once by six animals. In 1955-1956, there were erratic attempts at burrowing within a few minutes after release. Moderate burrowing began at the end of the first week and continued until the end of October. Burrow openings were mostly around the edge of the cage at A-1 to 10, J-1 to 10, and F-16. There were few signs of activity in the central areas. Later evidence indicated that much more soil was removed during this period than was apparent above ground, but it was not noticed because of the careful manner in which the chipmunk spreads the excavated soil. Cold weather in early November occasioned more vigorous activity, especially at B-2 and K-2. In late November the principal entrances were opened and closed in an irregular pattern. Food and many leaves were taken below ground, and some food was taken to the compartments. No animals were seen above ground from 18 December until 2 May. All entrances were closed during this period of inactivity. On 2 May entrances at J-16 and J-2 were opened and food was taken below for the first time in nearly five months. During the rest of May, evidence of activity was seen almost daily. On 27 May a healthy male and female were trapped, the remaining six animals having died during the winter. The burrow system then excavated is shown in Plate I, below. The model shows that considerable portions of the tunnels were plugged. The two surviving animals were utilizing only a small portion of the underground network at the time of capture; several inches of soil blocked the passageway to other tunnels and chambers. The greatest depth of the systems was 3 feet; the large chambers, however, were only 2 feet below the surface. The entrance to one system, located in the foreground of Plate I, below, was apparently shut off by a chipmunk from the surface. It had only one occupant, a dead chipmunk packed in the soil of a side pocket. Considering the nature of this side 122 Vol. 41, No. 1</page><page sequence="2">GENERAL NOTES i" ..... ".... ...

Feb., 1960 123</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY pocket and the neighboring parts of the system, it seems likely that another animal disposed of the carcass in this manner, first packing the body in a side chamber and then sealing off the entire system from the surface. No other animals were found entombed in this manner, although dead animals were occasionally found on the surface. The systems contained three large nests. Purina chow was stored in small amounts, but did not preserve well. Some nuts were stored, even in areas of the systems which were sealed off. In 1956-1957, there was little burrowing activity until 25 November. From then until the end of December there was extensive digging and food storing. January 15 marked the last activity at the entrance of the artificial burrow. There was moderate burrowing activity throughout the winter with the exception of 23 January to 5 February. Entrances were frequently, apparently irregularly, opened and closed. They were closed both from above and below the surface; sometimes they were opened or closed for only a few hours' duration. Detailed records of these soil movements present a baffling display of activity, and it is difficult to convey by generalizations an adequate understanding of -these strange patterns. On 3 June, two survivors of the experiment, one male and one female, were trapped and the burrow systems were excavated. Because of the collapse of certain sections from heavy rains, it was not possible to map these systems completely. In general, they were similar to the complex network of 1955-1956. It appeared that at one time the entire network had been connected. The amount of storage was greater than in the first year. Seeds and corn were stored far in excess of possible use during the winter. Sections of tunnels and chambers were literally stuffed with food so that passageways were tightly blocked. The artificial burrow had been filled almost to its roof with leaves and food; the entrance was solidly plugged with soil, and a dead chipmunk was inside. Discussion.-Most of the data obtained from the study of natural burrows were con- firmed in this cage experiment. The erratic opening and closing of entrances was observed by us for the first time. Plugged work-holes, described in the earlier paper, may serve a function that is easily understood, namely, as an aid in concealing entrances to a system. The opening and closing of entrances observed in the cage offer a more mysterious problem. The extensive refilling of tunnels was also surprising. Some activity of this nature had been observed in the Wisconsin wilds, but never to this extent. Perhaps it was just missed during the field work or perhaps the restricted area of the cage exaggerated the activity. It could also be a segregation mechanism to isolate certain portions of a system if, for some reason, animals wished to live separately. Such a situation would arise much less frequently in nature. Of course, like so many natural history phenomena, the activity could be a behavior pattern which is inexplicable in terms of our anthropomorphic reasoning, and thus demands a special study. Burrowing throughout the winter during 1956-57 was unexpected. Since each animal had been in captivity for at least a year prior to its use in the cage experiment, any "internal cycle" relating to burrowing habits may have been disrupted. Yet it seems significant that cold weather provoked more serious activity. Also of interest is the fact that the air temperatures during October, November and December of 1956 averaged 5.0?F. higher than the year preceding. The inactivity from 18 December 1955 to 2 May 1956 is perhaps related to hibernation; laboratory experience, however, indicated that great caution must be employed in interpreting hibernation behavior in Tamias (Panuska, Jour. Mamm., 40: 554-566, 1959). The activity of the 1956-1957 winter will suffice to show the varied pattern of winter behavior that apparently is characteristic of this species.-JosEPH A.
