<plain_text><page sequence="1">A TELOS APPROACH TO LEIBNIZ JAMES COLLINS JLn choosing the topic of "Teleology Revisited" for his 1977 John Dewey Lectures, Ernest Nagel has responded to a definite situation in the logic of biology. Many investigators find it helpful to make ex plicit and prominent use of such concepts as function and goal directed behavior. Statements embodying these concepts can be construed in some teleological sense, thus requiring philosophers of the life sciences to analyze rather than dismiss statements made in the teleological mode. Independent inquiries into this aspect of tele ology are being undertaken by Wright, Woodfield, and now Nagel.1 Further portions of the teleological question are being reviewed in connection with other philosophical issues. One major impetus comes from the theory of action. In examining the distinctive role of the human agent, the realm of practical reason, and the language ap propriate for that role and realm, philosophers cannot avoid the theme of purpose. Sometimes it is involved in the problem of how basic actions are constituted and how they become related to, and pervasive of, the daily activities of an individual or social group. Under the form of practical intentionality, this side of teleology pre sents itself for a new clarification. I suggest that history of philosophy can also benefit from a re newal of interest in teleology. There is need for a more sustained study of how the historical sources treat of teleological issues, without presuming that we have reached a definitive understanding of those treatments. The great philosophers are ripe for revisiting on this score, and they invite us, as it were, to adapt the resources being generated by current teleological studies. The latter cannot 1 L.

Leibniz affords an instance where something is known about a way of telological thinking, and yet where much more still remains to be grasped. I will be concerned here primarily with an approach or line of questioning which may aid the further exploration of his intri cate thought on the matter. Thus the emphasis throughout is meth odological, in respect both to an interpreter's perspective and to Leibniz's own procedures on teleology. Without being in any way exhaustive, the following four considerations are intended to show that Leibniz more than repays any visit made to him with teleological questions in mind. 1. From Teleology to Telos. Leibniz differed radically from Spinoza and Bayle on many issues in metaphysics and epistemo logy. But he was able to argue with them closely only because of some commonly held terrain. One area of shared footing was their acquaintance with the teleological tradition, as summarized and sche matized in the seventeenth-century philosophy textbooks. What made Spinoza's criticism of finality pertinent was its informed exami nation of the presuppositions, divisions, and arguments usually em ployed to support finalistic positions. And from article to elusive ar ticle in Bayle's Dictionary, these same distinctions and proofs were minutely dissected. Indeed, Leibniz genuinely admired his oppo nent's learning in this field, even when he had to counter Bayle's in ferences at almost every point.2 But apart from particular disagreements, Leibniz drew a general conclusion from his encounters with Spinoza, Bayle, and likewise Hobbes. It was that learned acquaintance with, and academic trans mission of, teleological doctrine is insufficient to gain philosophical as sent to it. Assent cannot be elicited by changing the terminology, rearranging the divisions, or merely reformulating the same argu ments. Even after such alterations are made, Spinoza can still elimi nate final cause from his metaphysics; Hobbes can still make the me chanical motion of bodies his decisive model; and Bayle can still suspend philosophical judgment and appeal to faith alone for cer tainty. All these ultimate positions proved to be compatible with ac ademic knowledge of the school treatises on teleology. 2 This is the tenor of the Preface of Leibniz's Essais de th?odic?e, ed. J. Jalabert (Paris: Aubier, 1962), pp. 39-48; Leibniz, Theodicy, trans. E. M. Huggard (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1951), pp. 62-71.</page><page sequence="3">A TELOS APPROACH TO LEIBNIZ 349 For Leibniz, the real deficiency does not lie in telic thinking itself but in the customary attitude toward teleology. The latter is re garded as a codified set of maxims and principles which has already been forged out by past philosophers, and which now needs only to be presented as an achieved doctrine. One may have to adapt it to new situations, but it is a sound and accepted foundation upon which to build. Thus regarded, teleology is like a thing that is already there in basic structure, requiring only to be taught and applied to difficulties. I will designate this view as teleology (1 ). Leibniz finds it want ing, since it does not square with the philosophical experience of his own century. The minds with whom he is most constantly engaged in discussion offer reasons for not conceding that there is an estab lished true body of teleological thought, to which their reason must conform. Leibniz agrees in not granting any unexamined truth-claim for teleology, no matter how renowned its sources or how elaborate its presentation may be. He himself does not indulge in the activity of just transmitting a given mass of statements on this disputed topic. Yet his approach to the question of ends and purposes is not one of rejection, reduction, or bracketing. Rather, he treats the question precisely as what it is: a query that has to be raised and tested by whatever experiences and general concepts are shown to have a bear ing. The reflections of past philosophers of all schools have to be rethought and sifted from one's own perspective. Moreover, they have to be reconsidered in their distinctive individual forms, before any consilience can be affirmed. Leibniz traces out each single thread of argument to discover whether it has evidential backing that warrants its inclusion in his philosophy. The Leibnizian strategy is to make passage from teleology (1) to telos. I use the latter term at first as a sortal one. It groups to gether Leibniz's many analyses of ends and final causes, functional goals and intended purposes. What holds them together is a way of consideration, characterized by three marks. First, there is no attempt to impose a telic monism but, instead, many kinds o? telos are recognized.3 Each type is inspected for its own sake, with arguments proper to its domain. This approach is fa cilitated by Leibniz's preference usually for brief articles and essays, which make no pretence at covering every sort of telos. Secondly, a 3 See the automatized lexicography in "Monade 7U" G. W. Leibniz, Discours de m?taphysique et Monadologie, ed. A. Robinet (Paris: Vrin, 1974), p. 77, occurrences of fin, finales, and fins.</page><page sequence="4">350 JAMES COLLINS search is made to pierce through a given traditional rubric in order to enliven the sustaining evidence or else to show that this instance has no intelligible basis. Leibniz is not uncomfortable about employing an older terminology, but he does not let the usage dispense with an independent reopening of the specific point. To indicate his philo sophical initiative, he often joins the usage with a distinctive meaning of his own concerning the telos in question. And thirdly, the plural tele that do survive inspection are then reconsidered from the stand point of mutual relationships. Leibniz seeks a relatedness that uni fies them without collapsing their structures into but a single telic re ality. Pluralism of the tele accompanies pluralism of substantial agents: synthesis rather than abrogation of discernible differences is the rule in the Leibnizian study of telos as well as of substance. This last characteristic enables us to complete the charting of Leibniz's general strategy. He moves from teleology (1) to telos and tele, and thence toward teleology (2). This latter signifies his effort at systematic unification of the tele and their relationships that do survive the testing process. Teleology (2) is transcritical. It ex presses the synthesizing effort to interrelate this telos and that telos, rather than to regard them as discrete bits that bring the inquiry to a halt. Not the prior restraint of a philosophical tradition or a peda gogical memory pattern, but the implication of his theory of the corn possible actual universe, prompts Leibniz to develop a new system of teleological understanding. It is an effective ideal toward which his telic investigations are ordered, but which cannot be fully actualized any more than the use of sufficient reason can ever be fully converted by us into identity propositions. What does get achieved in teleology (2), however, is the tested and chastened foundation for a general theory of telos. 2. Mechanical causes and final causes. Perhaps the most strik ing general way in which Leibniz treats telos is through the topic of mechanical and final causes. It is present in his best known opuscula and correspondence series.4 Its very recurrence is part of the philo 4 Leibniz, Discours de m?taphysique, et Correspondance avec Ar nauld, ?d. G.

Loemker, pp. 636-37, 651-52.</page><page sequence="5">A TELOS APPROACH TO LEIBNIZ 351 sophical argument for telos. By performatory act, Leibniz is sug gesting that this distinction is not arbitrarily drawn but is a useful ingredient in any causal inquiry carried on in his age. The alignment of discussion of final causes with mechanical ones does not arise from any abandonment of the fourfold Aristotelian divi sion into material and formal, efficient and final causes. But it does represent Leibniz's historical judgment that confusion rather than clarification had resulted from directly translating the current scien tific conception of causality into the Aristotelian schema, especially as the latter was expounded in school manuals. It is for the all-around benefit of causal distinctions that a treatment of mechanical and final causes is undertaken. By following this route, reasons can be found for deamalgamating material, formal, and efficient causes themselves from indiscriminate inclusion within mechanical causality. The extraordinary feature of the mechanical causes/final causes doublet is that it signifies a distinction rather than an exclusionary contradiction. For Leibniz, the members are coupled rather than sundered and set at loggerheads with each other. Although the pair ing does not imply fundamental equality in reality and explanatory function, it does mean that the components belong in the same com plex universe of being and discourse open to philosophy. Leibniz's accomplishment here is to set a procedural disposition toward ways of considering mechanical and final causes together. Mechanism and teleology continue to be jointly visited and revisited by Kant and Hegel, Dewey and Nagel, even though they remain critical of Leib niz's own grounds of reconciliation. For his part, Leibniz offers a two-phase argument. The first stage has the broader appeal, since it can be accepted by people who remain unconvinced by the specifically Leibnizian account of the uni verse. What binds mechanical and final causes together is the con ception of them as kinds of reasons. Usually, the inquiry moves at once to distinguish causal from other types of reasons, and then dis tinguishes among the kinds of causal reasons. But Leibniz delays this tendency long enough to consider a consequence of coupling the two causal claimants within the general conception of reasons or grounds. To regard mechanical and final causes in this way is to restore them to their operative context of human methods and theorizing. The characteristic Leibnizian way of achieving this restoration is to interpret the principle that nothing is without a reason as meaning</page><page sequence="6">352 JAMES COLLINS that a reason can be furnished for everything that exists.5 The act of seeking to furnish a reason involves not just bare entities but minded entities, developing their concepts and procedures in the effort to ex plain existents and propositions about our experienced universe and its relationships. These concepts and procedures, along with their limitations, are incorporated into the furnished reasons and hence into causal reasons. Mechanical causes and final causes need not always designate separate worlds. They stand for distinct methods of analyzing and interpreting the same reality of our world. Each mode of question ing and understanding maintains its own integrity, without requiring any claim that its causal account is the sole one and excludes any other interpreting method. But although the aims of mechanical and finalistic thinking remain distinct and are not mutually extirpative, they do call for some philosophical reflection that compares and relates them to the common human effort at furnishing reasons or grounds for understanding what we experience. At this point, the second stage of Leibniz's approach comes into play. His philosophy of science is both an analytic way of understanding the new mathematical physics and a reflection upon the continuing need for the metaphysics of final causality. Unlike Spinoza, he finds no antagonism between the mathematical way of thinking and finalistic philosophy. Mathematics is not only a compo nent in the mechanistic view of nature but also a broader educator of the human mind. It directs us toward an ideal of economy and com prehensiveness, simple principles and complex consequences, which gets exemplified but in no way exhausted by the system of mechanical causes. Minds are drawn toward this ideal as toward a general con ception of finality expressed as order and harmony. In this respect, Spinoza's own cultivation of the geometrical way is itself a powerful impetus toward a finalistic metaphysics, especially when that way is combined with Leibniz's work on radiating points, progressive series, and asymptotes. Leibniz is careful not to establish an inverse ratio between me chanical and final causes. This relation would mean that every ad vance in mechanistic explanation entails a corresponding shrinkage in 5 Leibniz, Elementa Verae Pietatis, in Leibniz, Textes in?dits, ed. G. Gr?a, 2 vols. (Paris: Presses Universitaires, 1948), 1:13. Although not om niscient, finite minds develop methods to improve their grasp of the reasons of being and acting.</page><page sequence="7">A TELOS APPROACH TO LEIBNIZ 353 the reality and scope of final causes. Rather, it is legitimate to continue indefinitely with a study of things according to the model of natural machines and those devised by human art. Leibniz asks only that further philosophical reflection be devoted to machine-model thinking and its objects. Every advance in the procedure and the re ferents occurs within the context of life, mind, and purpose. A pur posive metaphysics confirms itself through direct reflection upon the whole mechanistic process, thus leading Leibniz to maintain the cou plet treatment of mechanical and final causes. His contextualizing of mechanical causes receives support from several convergent lines of investigation. One such aid comes from his critique of Cartesian physics and his contribution to dynamics. He could not refrain from concluding his technical paper on the com pounding of motions, the 1692 Essay on Dynamics, with these philo sophical remarks: Now that the true notion of force is established, and that the source of error as well as of truth is revealed, we shall be more disposed to disil lusion ourselves. That is all the more reasonable seeing that motion is a transient thing which never exists strictly speaking, seeing that its parts are never all together. But it is force (which is the cause of mo tion) that truly exists; so, in addition, apart from mass, shape, and change (which is motion), there is something else in corporeal nature: namely, force. Consequently, we must not be suprised if nature (that is to say, the sovereign wisdom) established its laws on that which is most real.6 From his mathematical and physical research, Leibniz seeks not only to make developments within these fields but also to point toward philosophical truths that remove illusions or abuses of one's intelligence. In the present instance, the equations expressing mass, shape, and motional change do not support any conclusion that me chanical causes are sufficient accounts of nature. Philosophical in quiry must also be made into force as the "something else," as "that which is most real" in nature. And such a line of inquiry leads even tually to the recognition of final causes, functional and purposive. The analysis of mechanical-dynamical causality dovetails with 6 Leibniz, Essay on Dynamics, in P. Costabel, Leibniz and Dynamics (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1973), p. 131. Here and elsewhere, the translations are slightly modified. The mechanical-and-teleological signifi cance of the concepts of the most determined action, continuity, equation between full cause and entire effect, and conservation of force, is shown by R. McRae, Leibniz: Perception, Apperception, and Thought (Toronto: Uni versity of Toronto Press, 1976), pp. 112-17, 131-45.</page><page sequence="8">354 JAMES COLLINS the Leibnizian theory of finite substances and phenomena. The sub stances in our universe are individual centers of agency or force, expressed in various degrees of perception and in a constant move to ward improved perception and ordered activity. As perceptual agents having this ceaseless drive, minded individual substances fol low the laws of final causes. Leibniz interprets physical phenomena as perceptions not fully clarified, the stable patterns correlating which are the laws of corporeal nature. Similarly, he regards physi cal particles as analogous expressions of the metaphysical atoms, the simple living substances or purposive center-points of force. Our universe provokes us to elaborate theories of both mechanical and final causes as complementary reasons furnished to account for a very complex reality. 3. Reformist philosophy: a cognitive telos. Leibniz speaks con sistently of "final causes" and "ends" in the plural. One reason for this usage is his resolve not to narrow down the problem of telos too rapidly and exclusively to God as ultimate end and to our understanding of the divine providential plan for things. Hence con siderable attention is paid to finalities within the universe, especially to those in human life. The latter need not arouse the apprehension of reducing all finalistic models to an exercise in anthropomorphic projection. Finalistic traits characterize human actions but they do so by modalizing a general relationship to ends which also marks other actions and relations in the universe. The several modes of telos are integrative and mutually confirmatory rather than projective from a single real base in man. Hence Leibniz feels free to broaden, not restrict, the study of kinds of telos in human life. He does so without either fearing to strengthen an anthropomorphic position or always trying nervously to draw out implications in favor of divine purposiveness. These are distractions which cannot be allowed to hinder a thorough inquiry into the kinds of human purposing and adapting, intrinsically consid ered. It is helpful to recognize that Leibniz proceeds here in double fashion: by engaging in telic activities and by reflectively theorizing about them. A good instance where these approaches work inten sively together is his view of philosophy itself. By modifying its meaning and aim, he affects the intent and character of the act of phi losophizing, thus engaging in a teleological modification of his work and furnishing material for the study of the teleological theory of mental activity.</page><page sequence="9">A TELOS APPROACH TO LEIBNIZ 355 Spinoza's cue word emendatio appears in the very title of Leib niz's short paper On the Emendation of First Philosophy and on the Notion of Substance (1694). Any emendation or correction of first philosophy is bound to affect the other philosophical disciplines de pendent for principles and direction upon it, and thus also eventually to modify human actions insofar as they respond to philosophical in terpretation of our nature and goals. Metaphysical reform requires a method of continuity (similar to the calculus), which will prevent the Cartesian leap of identifying the essence of matter with extension and thus of allowing only a mechanical explanation of corporeal sub stances. It will also prevent the prior stipulation by Spinoza that there is only one substance and that all affirmations of finality repre sent only our ignorance of the causes at work in a purely modal uni verse. Correction of these views opens the way toward a telic account of the actions of substances, both corporeal and spiritual. Thus Leibniz correlates method, substance, and teleology in the emendation of metaphysics. He draws upon his own scientific work as a guide toward the theory of substance that permits final causes to operate throughout the universe. The notion of forces or power [virium sen virtutis] (which the Ger mans call Kraft, and the French la force), to which I have devoted the special science of Dynamics, sheds much light on the understanding of the true notion of substance. . . . And I affirm that this force of act ing is inherent in all substance, and that some action always arises from it; so that corporeal substance itself (no less than spiritual sub stance) never ceases from acting.7 The activity has some functional and organic aspect, at least in the degree that substantial agencies are interrelated and aid each other's operations. In the case of spiritual substances or minds, moreover, this cooperation can be reflectively governed by purposive principles and intended goals. We can now step back a bit to observe how Leibniz communi cates his reforming ideas. His own practice constitutes a distinctive and intricate telos, whose analogous presence in the labor of other minds can also be discerned. I will single out the linguistic, the per 7 Leibniz, De Primae Philosophiae Emendatione, et de Notione Sub stantiae, collated text in Leibniz, Opuscula Ph?osophica Selecta, ed. P. Schrecker (Paris: Vrin, 1966), pp. 83-84; Leibniz, The Correction of Meta physics and the Concept of Substance, trans. Loemker, p. 433. A full-scale commentary is furnished by W. Janke, Leibniz: Die Emendation der Meta physik (Frankfurt: Klostermann, 1963).</page><page sequence="10">356 JAMES COLLINS spectives-generating, and the communitarian marks of this reformist way of philosophizing. (a) A linguistic telos is detectable in the text quoted above. Leibniz was multilingual, not just as an educational result but as a deliberately and pervasively cultivated part of his methodology. He was a master of Latin and French, German and formal (mathematical and logical) notation, and took a lively interest in other languages. His mathematical papers usually combined a formal system with a material language. In writings prepared for publication or for corre spondence, he often took the trouble to specify the precise rendition of key terms (such as "force") in the main languages. And his private working manuscripts were a living tapestry, with even the individual sentences being woven out of two or more language hoards. Such practices reflect, not a polyglot's revels, but a philosopher's need on two main counts. First, there is a tension between the translatability and the distinctness of languages used by philoso phers. The former trait means that a philosopher's thoughts are not imprisoned in their original tongue. Translation renders them ac cessible for comparison, criticism, and the enrichment of some other language sphere. But Leibniz is equally convinced of the irreducible distinction among material languages and their peculiar values for philosophical reflection and improvement. Apart from their widespread (but not completely worldwide) use as tools of communication, Latin and French offer special values to a philosopher. He is challenged by the incomparable concision of Latin, which gives linguistic actuation to the harmonic ideal of "much conveyed by a few means." One finds in French a supple, nuanced atmosphere that provides an opportunity for reaching clarity as well as a forum for cool discussion. As for German, Leibniz leaves no doubt about its capacity to make careful distinctions and keep specu lative endeavors close to our concrete experience, imagery, and talk.8 Leibniz's German papers and his constant interjection of Ger man phrases in the texts published by Grua give at least a foretaste of the philosophical uses of his native tongue. Its public development 8 See the chapter on "Leibniz et la langue allemande," in Y. Beia val, ?tudes leibniziennes (Paris: Gallimard, 1976), pp. 25-36, which counter balances Leibniz's search for a universal formal language as portrayed by R. Fraser, The Language of Adam (New York: Columbia University Press, 1977), and by H. Ishiguro, Leibniz's Philosophy of Logic and Language (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1972).</page><page sequence="11">A TELOS APPROACH TO LEIBNIZ 357 as a philosophical instrument was left, however, to Wolff and his aca demic successors. Leibniz's familiarity with, and philosophical use of, logical and mathematical notation serves as a counterpoint to the material languages, both in formulating principles and in drawing out their consequences in systematic fashion. The second philosophical need satisfied by the use of several lan guages is to encourage the search after the peaceable kingdom of minds. The interplay of languages is like the interplay of minds: both are characterized by irreducibility, mutual accessibility, and the op portunity for understanding and cooperation. Thus the linguistic telos furnishes a living image of that communication among sub stances, especially minds, which Leibniz regards as a general aim of his reformist philosophy. This telos remains strong, even when his ideal of a universal characteristic gets frustrated and fades. (b) A perspectives-generating telos is another trait of Leibniz's emendation of first philosophy.9 The premise here is that varying ways of treating substance and other metaphysical principles will produce variations throughout the entire system of philosophy. In this light, Leibniz's authorial practice is not merely a literary matter but a component in his telic strategy itself. Why does he write, for instance, so many short articles for jour nals and so many series of letters with a variety of correspondents? The papers and letters are an adaptive response to the accelerated tempo of intellectual developments in the later seventeenth century. Each item offers a one-view expression of Leibniz's present thinking, a public scrutiny of his reflections and criticisms while he is still privately searching for improved concepts and modes of expression. If one mind or one reading public cannot be reached by some particu lar approach, then another must be tried as an opportunity both to rectify his own concepts and to find a route more intelligible and con vincing to other people. In terms of the distinction between telos-in use and theory-of-teZos, Leibniz addresses himself to many sorts of intelligent readers, not solely to philosophers. He is also responsive 9 Leibniz conveys this perspectives-generating telos in his carefully chosen metaphorical references to a simple substance as "a perpetual living mirror of the universe," to each part of matter "as a garden full of plants or as a pond full of fish," and to individual substances as constituting a multi perspectival city, "the perspectives of a single universe according to the dif ferent points of view of each monad." Monadologie, ed. Robinet, pp. 105, 111; Monadology, trans. Loemker, pp. 648, 650.</page><page sequence="12">358 JAMES COLLINS to a mathematico-esthetic criterion of joining concision and precision, economy and functional elegance of thought and expression. This as pect of his reformist ideal is elusive and never fully satisfied in any one try. Underlying these considerations is Leibniz's conviction that we are always en route toward teleology (2). No finite mind's conception of telos is definitive to the point of being all-comprehensive and unre visable. It is proposed in as general form as possible. But it must be formulated and developed variously to do justice to the complexity of our universe, the diversity of our minds, and the contention among human philosophies and institutions. It is in response to this situa tion that Leibniz constantly returns to the workshop and restates his philosophy in new ways. As readers of Leibniz, we have to recognize the inner working of this perspectives-generating telos in his writings. A visible expression of its operation is found in the different order of topics in his three most frequently studied short treatises. The Discourse on Metaphysics (1686) plunges immediately into seven propositions about God's perfection and goodness, justice and universal laws. Only thereafter does Leibniz present his theory of individual sub stances, along with their activities and interrelations. The order of inference is reversed in The Principles of Nature and of Grace (1714), which begins with substances, the plenum of nature, and the degrees among living substances and their activities. Using the principle of sufficient reason, Leibniz culminates in his doctrine on God's wisdom, our love for him, and the community of all minded substances in the city of God. Finally, the Monadology (also 1714) reformulates all these positions in monadological terms, goes into greater detail on the operational differences among substances, relates the kinds of truths to the kinds of basic principles, and approaches God as the native re gion of truths and ends. Despite the vividness and scope of the mo nadological presentation, however, it should not be treated as the pri mary mold into which all other reasoning is to be fitted. Not merely its late date of composition but the entire weight of Leibniz's plural perspectives tells against such a reduction.. (c) A community telos synthesizes the linguistic and perspec tives-generating tele of Leibniz's reformist conception of philosophy. He does not stress the irreducibility of languages just for the sake of their multiplicity. Instead, languages are open to mutual interpreta tion and incorporation of new facets of truth. The overriding ideal is</page><page sequence="13">A TELOS APPROACH TO LEIBNIZ 359 that of a unified human family of languages and cultures, bound to gether in a republic of justice and of letters. This ideal spurs us to ward gradual realization of our common human tongue, whatever the breakdowns caused by misunderstandings and wars. In the telos of a world community of languages and moral ideals, Leibniz finds an ana logue of the city of God among men.10 Similarly, the perspectival urge does not churn away without controls. At least Leibniz's own perspectives are reflectively disci plined by some unifying considerations. Human minds and their philosophical systems are expressive of our actual universe as their common referent. Explorations of possible universes also have a common logic of sufficient reason, compossibility, and other principles that keep them within hailing distance. And the grounding of di verse perspectival expressions in the finitude of human minds sup plies a common root both for the need of expressive plurality and the aim of reaching a common understanding. Two points?a literary and an epistemological one?support Leibniz's hope for the practicability of a community telos among phi losophers. The literary act is that Leibniz placed many of his trea tises in an epistolary setting. After writing the "Discourse on Meta physics" (the title is not his), he sent its thesis headings to Antoine Arnauld as the first step in a massive correspondence on his system. It must be remembered also that the Principles of Nature and of Grace was written for Prince Eugene of Savoy, and that the "Mona dology" (again not titled by Leibniz) was written for Nicolas de R?mond and his group. In these cases and elsewhere, Leibniz em bedded his perspectival systems in the open matrix of letters. What ever headway he made with his many correspondents constituted a contribution to the communitarian telos. 10 The Political Writings of Leibniz, ed. P. Riley (New York: Cam bridge University Press, 1972), shows his persistent and very concrete at tempts to achieve an order of international justice, based on an understanding of differences and an effort of love to reconcile them. Leib niz's practical activities are buoyed by his view that all men are members of the city of God, the moral kingdom of grace which works (in social union with God) toward harmony within the company of minds as well as between this realm and the realm of nature.

Philosophical analysis concerns this reality, not the iso lated Cartesian ego or the Baconian sense experience or the Spinozan unique substance. The Leibnizian self jointly experiences its per sonal selfhood and the real universe, just as the Leibnizian complete substance has relations ultimately embracing the entire universe from a particular viewpoint.11 There is a basis in the logic and meta physics of substances, actions, and relations for the project of report ing to, and inciting criticism from, other active centers of mind and experience. Through reflective persons and their disciplined discus sions, a community telos can develop the theme of "we humans and our apprehension of ourselves and the universe." 4. The harmony telos. Up to this point, I have referred to each of Leibniz's tele quite restrictedly as "a" telos. Without pretending to exhaust his reflections on this and that telos, I must now consider their tendency of convergence, of working in concert toward teleol ogy (2). The telos implicit in all the others and pointing in the direction of their synthesis is the harmony telos. It strives after a maximum of variety amid unity, as well as unity amid variety, in re spect to: mechanical and final causes, linguistic modes and other per spectives, and communities of thought and action. On this last score, the harmony theme renders explicit Leibniz's intent to establish both a speculative and a practical significance for every sort of telos. His broader systematic expositions never fail to include the moral and po litical, esthetic and religious, bearings of his telic considerations. Harmony is a bridging ideal for man the thinker and man the agent, and hence it serves as the surmodel for Leibniz's entire doctrine on telos. I will concentrate here upon the role of harmony in two of Leib niz's works, one written when he was twenty-seven and the other composed during his last year of life. These writings (only now being well edited and analyzed) exhibit the lifelong persistence of the har mony motif in Leibniz's reflections on telos. (a) Telos and theodicy. The young Leibniz conceived a plan of developing his philosophy in a trilogy of related confessiones: The Confession of Nature, The Philosopher's Confession, and (probably) 11 Discours de m?taphysique, ed. Le Roy, pp. 64-66; Discourse on Metaphysics, trans. Loemker, pp. 320-21.</page><page sequence="15">A TELOS APPROACH TO LEIBNIZ 361 The Theologian's Confession. By a "confession" he meant an orderly presentation of some general positions, along with their requisite def initions, principles, and arguments. He did compose a short paper entitled The Confession of Nature against Atheists (1668), advancing arguments for God as the incorporeal mind required as the ultimate source of bodily phenomena, as well as a sorites for the immortality of the human mind. As for the confession on theological issues, its functions were distributed among several discussions intended for Leibniz's proposed "Catholic Demonstrations" (of which the later Discourse on Metaphysics may have been meant to supply the pref ace). But our attention will focus on the centerpiece of this triptych: The Confession of the Philosopher (1673, 1678). This is an evident iary profession of rational faith concerning God's justice, human free dom, and predestination. It is rightly called Leibniz's first theodicy, since it presents the basic concepts and reasonings which were subse quently elaborated and incorporated into the Essays of Theodicy (1710). My analysis will concentrate on some passages in The Con fession of the Philosopher which bear directly upon the harmony telos. Text (1): Harmony is "likeness in variety, or diversity compen sated by identity. ... If there is a ratio or proportionality, there fore there is both harmony and discordance. For they consist in the ratio of identity to diversity. Thus harmony is unity in the many, and the greatest harmony [is unity] in the most" diverse elements.12 Leibniz defines harmony in this proportional way, because such inter mingling of diverse factors characterizes every type of perception and action. Hence whether one's particular telos is a mathematical sys tem, a work of art, or a political order, it consists in some sort of relation between diversity and unity. Man aims, not at a point-instant, but at bringing discordant aspects of his experience into a clarifying har mony. Text (2): "The first and unique efficient cause of things is mind; the cause of mind as acting, or the end of things, is harmony, [and the 12 Leibniz, Confessio Philosophi: La Profession de foi du philosophe, ed.

For every ratio, proportion, analogy, proportionality, arises not from the will but from the nature of God or, what is the same, from the idea of things."13 Here, Leibniz moves from physical laws or mechanical causes to mind as the efficient cause of the action of bodies. Then he considers a telos or end to be that harmony toward which a mind di rects its action. When minds are distinguished as finite and infinite, the latter has its telos in the contemplation and communication of the most harmonious whole. This is the basis of the Leibnizian principle of the best, which concerns a multiplex totality rather than an isolated entity. When ever a man invokes this principle, he is hewing to the purposive norm of understanding and helping to realize the maximal harmony of in terrelationships in the universe. Against Cartesian voluntarism, Leibniz always grounds the prime harmonic telos upon God's understanding and existing nature, rather than upon the divine will. God wills the actual universe, but he does so because he sees it to be the best, or the most harmonious actuation of compossibles in its final yield. This association between harmony and the principle of the best shows the existential nature of Leibniz's theory o? telos and har mony. He distinguishes three kinds of harmony: abstract, purely ideal, and actual.14 Abstract harmony is a unity among mathematical equa tions, figures, or calculi. It may be applied usefully to the world but, considered in itself, this sort of system prescinds from existential 13 Confessio, pp. 40, 102. See L. E. Loemker, Struggle for Synthesis: The Seventeenth Century Background of Leibniz's Synthesis of Order and Freedom (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1972), pp. 177-202, on the modes of harmony. 14 Confessio, marginal responses on pp. 42-43, n.3; and p. 102, n.6. The Confessio presents a double-dialogue situation. The main text is itself a literary dialogue between the catechizing theologian (later called simply "the theologian," and then "Theophilus") and the catechumen philosopher (later called simply "the philosopher," and then "Epistemon"). The former guides the questioning, summarizes conclusions, and suggests new objec tions; the latter does the constructive philosophizing. "The philosopher" is certainly spokesman for Leibniz, but this does not exclude "the theologian" from representing the questioning and self-critical aspect of Leibniz. The marginal notes of the 1678 manuscript consist of an actual interchange between Nicholas Steno (to whom Leibniz had submitted the 1673 manu script for comments) and Leibniz himself, responding somewhat testily to Steno's objections. All my direct quotations and expositions are drawn from "the philosopher" and from Leibniz's marginal responses.</page><page sequence="17">A TELOS APPROACH TO LEIBNIZ 363 claims. A purely ideal harmony consists of elements that are inter nally compatible with each other and constitute a frictionless set of interactions. But this intrinsic compatibility does not meet the fur ther requirement of incorporating the supreme values of divine jus tice and human freedom. Hence it falls short of being the best, or the maximum harmonious order which the divine understanding knows and the divine will brings into existence. The actual or real harmony characterizing the existing world does embody these supreme values and their consequences. Its components are not only compossible with each other but also generative of the maximum justice in a world containing free agents. Yet this best order involves existential struggles for its actualization?a process that might falter were it not always incited by its telos of realizing the most concord. This telos includes an ideal aspect of incitement, but it is not purely ideal since its aim is to make the principle of the best operate in the actual world of contingency, perception, and action. Our unifying human telos responds to the conditions of intention ally aiming at actual harmony. The remaining three texts specify Leibniz's account respectively of the artistic, affective, and moral striving aspects of our harmony telos. Text (3): "Although the integral harmony is pleasing, yet the dis sonances themselves are not pleasing, even though they are inter mixed according to the rules of art. But the disagreeableness which is in them is abolished in the whole through the excess, or rather the progress and hence increase, of the agreeableness. Therefore in this mixture the dissonance comes to be, through compensation, something indifferent drawn out of being unpleasing, something permitted drawn out of being rejected. Only the whole is pleasing, only the whole is harmonic, only the configuration as it were of the whole is harmony."15 Leibniz has appealed to the painter's use of shadow and 15 Confessio, p. 62; cf. p. 52 for the analogies in painting and music? analogies which continue to crop up in Leibniz's subsequent writings, (a) The primary analogate is the wonderful artistry of God, who is the infinitely wise and powerful artist (Th?odic?e, ed. Jalabert, pp. 207-209; Theodicy, trans. Huggard, pp. 215-17). (b) The artistic process is a compensatio, and the very meaning of harmony is a compensata -relationship between diver sity and identity (Confessio, pp. 30, 62). This compensating process in re gard to the whole universe is a strenuous work of divine wisdom at the ser vice of a choice of the best or actual universe, the actual harmony as distinct from abstract and purely ideal systems of compossible harmonies. (Th?odic?e, p. 264; Theodicy, pp. 267-68.) And (c) universal harmony is therefore that sort of beauty which actualizes the greatest compossible goodness and justice (see Text [4] below).</page><page sequence="18">364 JAMES COLLINS light, as well as the musical composer's use of dissonance and conso nance. Rembrandt's Flight into Egypt and Telemann's Don Quixote Suite would be respective examples of this artistic practice. But Leibniz does not permit the analogy to gloss over the bite of pain and the counterproductive effect of moral evil. Hence he appeals here to a steady overcoming (a process of compensatio) of the preponderance of every sort of evil in order to reach an integral harmony. The har mony telos engages us in a continual effort to render pain relatively indifferent, and moral evil just permitted (neither willed nor not willed but known and subordinated by God), within the universe as a whole. Our telic activity orders itself toward the totius velut config uratio, the configuration as it were of the whole harmony (the moral equivalent of Spinoza's fades totius universi). Text (4): To take delight is "to perceive harmony. . . . Every felicity is harmonic or beautiful. . . . Therefore felicity will consist in a state of mind the most harmonious possible. The nature of mind is to think; therefore the mind's harmony will consist in thinking har mony; and the greatest harmony of the mind, or felicity, will consist in the concentration of the universal harmony, that is of God, in the mind."16 Leibniz customarily uses the verbs "to perceive" and "to take delight" (sentir? and delectari) as the best way to express our mind's grasp of harmony. The latter act engages our cognitive and appetitive powers directly and fulfillingly: harmony is that which best satisfies the active tendencies of the mind towards its most complete and satisfying telos. There is an affective and esthetic trait which compels Leibniz to call harmony beautiful and to locate our happiness in its possession. His readings in the German mystical tradition prompt him also to speak of our relationship to universal harmony as a concentration, or intensely unitive presence, of God in our goal seeking mind. As the ultimate sufficient ground of the existing uni verse, God is the comprehensive harmony we seek. Text (5): "It is not our task to prescribe times for God, and only those who persevere will be crowned. Hence it belongs to the lover of 16 Confessio, pp. 28, 30. God is the universal harmony, in the sense that "God is the ultimate reason of things," the ultimate sufficient reason of existing for everything (Confessio, p. 34). Because Steno does not keep in mind these basic points, he fails to grasp the consequential reasoning in what Leibniz twice calls his own "system" (Confessio, marginal responses on p. 74, n.2, and p. 90, n.l).</page><page sequence="19">A TELOS APPROACH TO LEIBNIZ 365 God to consider the past as good, and to try to make the future the best. . . . [When] the blessed, through an increase continued into all the infinite, are once admitted to God, that is to the universal har mony and supreme ground, and have gathered it together as though concentrated in a single stroke of vision, they have an unfailing reason, however, for infinitely multiplying their delectation by a more distinct reflection on the parts of their joy. For there is no thinking, and hence pleasure, without perpetual newness and progress."17 With unusual passion, Leibniz removes the misunder standing that to perceive and love the ultimate telos is to bring an end to all striving, a finish to every effort at betterment. Our mind is so related to the harmony telos in its universal sense that we can and must always continue to make progress. Whether in this life or in the beatific vision, there is no room for static gaze and quietism on the part of one who loves God. Leibniz's notion of forever increasing our apprehension and actualization of universal harmony is a striking an ticipation of Kant's view of human immortality. (b) Telos and Chinese thought. Today, we do not turn to Leib niz as an accurate authority on Chinese philosophy. But he read the best translations and reports, corresponded with missionaries, and edited a China Newsletter. In 1716, Leibniz composed for the pre viously mentioned Nicolas de R?mond a long letter, never completed, but which constitutes a Discourse on the Natural Theology of the Chinese. It was the historical and intercultural aspect of the har mony telos that led Leibniz to make this comparative study. His in terpretation was overweighed on the side of finding points of agree ment. But it did testify to his conviction that thinkers in every age and language develop analogous concepts capable of being interre lated and harmonized. This teleological notion of a perennial philoso phy guided his reading of the Chinese sources. I will single out only one feature of Leibniz's interpretation. He fixes upon the concept of Li (principle, pattern, order), as originally signifying the primary spiritual ground that produces all things through its purposive, providential activity. Leibniz maintains that it corresponds to his notion of divinity and hence that he can use it to 17 Confessio, pp. 84, 92. Leibniz continues to reaffirm these positions in the conclusion to both the Principes de la nature et de la gr?ce and the Monadologie, ed. Robinet, pp. 61-65, 127 (Principles of Nature and of Grace and Monadology, trans. Loemker, pp. 641, 652).</page><page sequence="20">366 JAMES COLLINS convince the Neoconfucians "that God is an Intelligentia supramun dana, and is superior to matter."18 The term "supramundane intelligence" is a signature-word for God, especially as treated by Leibniz during his later years. It helps him to meet certain difficulties in the theory of the harmony telos. To call God the universal harmony of things may suggest that he is sim ply the internal order of the universe. The same implication can be drawn from regarding him as the primary monad, the basic individual substance. But without diluting God's immanent ordering presence, "supramundane" specifies that he is the active source of the world, yet not identical with it. Both a purely ideal harmony and the actual harmony are founded upon ideas present in the divine understanding or the region of eternal truths. But only the actual harmony is con sidered under the principle of the best and hence is produced as the existing world, distinct from God and telically ordained toward him. The term "intelligence" does not have a purely speculative signi fication: it does not stand for a nonmoral natural attribute but con veys a practical moral meaning as well. It is another name for the divine wisdom, which assures that the will of God is good, loving, and just in producing the world.19 At its very source, the harmony of the actual world is a constant striving to realize justice in its widest parti cipation. Thus the harmony telos is practical and moral to the core, without ceasing to have theoretical and esthetic interest. 5. Conclusion. Leibniz is worth revisiting from the teleological standpoint. His position contains, to use his own language, fold within fold of telic meanings that call for rediscovery. For instance, his theory of the union of soul and body concerns not only the pre-es tablishing of their harmony by God but also the telic interrelations 18 Leibniz, Discourse on the Natural Theology of the Chinese, trans. H. Rosemont and D. J. Cook (Honolulu: University Press of Hawaii, 1977), p. 57. A critical analysis of Leibniz's views on Chinese thought is made by D. E. Mungello, Leibniz and Confucianism: The Search for Accord (Hono lulu: University Press of Hawaii, 1977). In defending himself against the Newtonians, Leibniz remarks: "I don't think I can be rightly blamed, for saying that God is intelligentia supramundana. Will they say, that he is intelligentia mundana; that is, the soul of the world? I hope not." The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, ed. H. G. Alexander (New York: Philo sophical Library, 1956), p. 19. 19 The originality of this linkage between wisdom-love-justice is no ticed by J. Hostler, Leibniz's Moral Philosophy (New York: Barnes and Noble, 1975), pp. 47-54; and by D. J. Den Uyl, "Science and Justice in Leib niz's Political Thought," New Scholasticism 52 (1978):317-42.</page><page sequence="21">A TELOS APPROACH TO LEIBNIZ 367 among the many individual substances functioning as body or view point for the perceiver and striver after harmony. This intrinsic functional telos remains distinct from the framework of other soul body theories in his century. Leibniz's approach also offers some procedural guidance for our own discussions of teleology. (1) Not much clarification can be expected from a total acceptance or rejection of teleology. This en bloc procedure should be replaced by that of distinguishing carefully between several meanings o? telos. Nagel and the others mentioned at the outset have begun this process, but models o? telos drawn from areas other than biology are worth examining. (2) Leibniz helps in the search for other telic models by treating final causes as kinds of reasons, not restricted to the physical and bio logical meanings of causality. Today, this move can be interpreted as a study of the distinction between physico-biological sorts of causal explanation and historical understanding through action theories.20 The latter theories involve an intentional sort of telos. Even though no Humean science of human nature is available, an historical understanding and explanation can still be sought by means of inten tional tele of human behavior stated and verified through practical in ferences. (3) There is a broad field for rendering effective the reforming spirit of teleology. It can be brought to bear upon both the general principles and some particular theses of erotetic logic. In its present stage of development, the logic of questions and answers takes too univocal and restrictive a view of what will count as an answer and what will serve as a pattern for the course of questioning.21 Differ ent sorts of nontelic and telic inquiries set the conditions for deter mining several kinds of requirements of answers and the connected ness among them. Why-and-wherefore questions are not subordinate offshoots from elementary types of questioning but enjoy their own primordial structure and thrust. The sequencing of ques tions and answers in Leibniz's many dialogues is governed by his own conceptions o? telos. 20 R. Martin, Historical Explanation (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1977). 21 N. D. Belnap and T. B. Steel, The Logic of Questions and Answers (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976), sets formal conditions for what counts as an answer, and treats why-questions apart from elementary ques tions (pp. 84-87).</page><page sequence="22">368 JAMES COLLINS Teleology also affects the logic of possible worlds.22 The mean ings of "possible" and "compossible" do not remain unchanged when they refer to the three kinds of harmonic universes: abstract, purely ideal, and actual. Because of this threefold difference, it becomes more complicated to conceive of possible worlds and of the cross worlds identity of an individual. It even becomes necessary to in spect the making of plural actual worlds or perspectives on the part of members of the universe of actual harmony. The formalization of propositions capable of taking account of this wider telic situation is still underway. (4) Finally, in the moral and historical order the ideal of the har mony telos remains strong.23 It makes a resurgence in the face of the suffering and evil, the oppressions and wars, that continue to tear the human fabric. These scars of our existence do not slip from sight or get a cosmetic disguise, when the harmony telos is sought. For al though the latter provides a basis for personal and social hope, it does not do so by pretending that the evils can be ignored or be annihilated in our world of human freedom. Leibniz himself did not underestimate the essential limits in the human effort to grapple with this predicament. When asked to fur nish direct insight into the pattern of supreme harmony in the divine mind, and thus to give purely a priori proof that the conditions pre vailing in our world are the proper consequences of this harmony, he replied sharply: You pose great demands, friend, and ones concerning which philoso phy doubts whether it suffices. . . . But if, not content with that [ef fect-to-cause, a posteriori] reasoning, you want that very harmony which causes so many wonderful things to be laid open to you, and that it be demonstrated a priori that it belonged to reason to actualize [the harmony] in this way in the world, you demand a thing impossible for a man not yet admitted to the secrets of the vision of God.24 22 See B. Mates, "Leibniz on Possible Worlds," in Leibniz: A Collec tion of Critical Essays, ed. H. G. Frankfurt (New York: Doubleday Anchor Books, 1972), pp. 335-64; and N. Goodman, Ways ofWorldmaking (Indian apolis: Hackett, 1978). Goodman's plural actual worlds are akin to Leibniz's plural perspectives established by existent, perceiving, individual sub stances, especially minds. 23 P. Geach, Providence and Evil (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1977), pp. 71-77, relates teleology and post-Darwinian evolutionary mechanisms. 24 Confessio, pp. 88, 102.

The principle of the best and the truths of fact would be otiose, were we able in this life to gain an intuitive total knowledge of the actual reason pattern ing our existing world.</page></plain_text>
