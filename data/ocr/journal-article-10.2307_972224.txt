<plain_text><page sequence="1">Throughout Maya history the left and right sides of the human body, left/right spatial orientation, and handedness have had important cultural and symbolic meanings. This essay examines left/right symbolism in relation to the body, which is generally overlooked in studies of archaeological societies and material culture, and discusses how it relates to ancient Maya ideology and behavior. New information from Classic Maya iconography, plus corroborative information from Maya ethnography and cross-cultural investigations, support the proposition that left/right symbolic differences and hierarchies were present in ancient Maya society. For the Classic Maya, as with contemporary Maya peoples, the right hand or side of the body often signified "pure, powerful, or superordinate," and the left frequently symbolized "weaker, lame, or subordinate" in particular cultural contexts. Hence, in Classic Maya imagery, kings face to their right and use their right hands, while subordinates are oriented to their left and frequently use their left hands. Following comparative anthropological analyses, consideration of handedness and human body symmetry help explain the left/right dichotomy and the apparent primacy of the right in Classic Maya spatial reference, social order, and worldview. Thefindings of this study have important implications for the examination of left/right symbolism in material culture, images of the body, and ideology in other societies. En este ensayo se propone que la division sime'trica de izquierda y derecha del cuerpo humano, el diferente uso de cada mano, y los sentidos direccionales de izquierda y derecha tienen significados importantes en la larga historia de la sociedad maya. Aquf se analiza el simbolismo de izquierda y derecha, que es generalmente pasado por alto en estudios de las culturas pasadas y sus culturas materiales, y se discute como se relacionaba a la ideologfa maya. El argumento esta' basado en nuevos datos e inter- pretaciones de la iconograffa maya clasica junto con informacion etnografica maya y de estudios de otras sociedades. En la cul- tura maya antigua se encuentran diferencias simbolicas y jerarquicas de izquierda y derecha: la mano y el lado derecho del cuerpo significan "poderoso, puro y superior" mientras que la mano y el lado izquierdo simbolizan "debil, impuro y inferior" en ciertos contextos culturales. Por ejemplo, en muchas ima'genes del periodo maya clasico, los gobernantes y protagonistas de las cere- monias son mostrados mirando a su lado derecho en donde se encuentran los subordinados, quienes estan orientados haefa su lado izquierdo. Estas ima'genes tambie'n muestran a los gobernantes usando sus manos derechas y a los subordinados frequente- mente usando sus manos izquierdas. Por ejemplo, en los murales mayas de Bonampak, Me'xico, los guerreros locales esta'n mostra- dos usando sus manos derechas mientras que sus enemigos son surdos. De acuerdo al estudio antropologico comparativo, la diferencia entre las dos manos y la simetrfa del cuerpo humano ayudan a explicar el simbolismo de izquierda y derecha y la pre- ferencia por el lado derecho en la jerarqufa social, la referencia espacial, y la cosmologfa de los mayas. Este simbolismo de izquierda y derecha junto con la importancia de la derecha han sido importante en la organizacion y estructuracion de la icono- graffa, la arquitectura, y el orden social de los mayas, al igual que en otras culturas y merecen mas atencion.

Palka In a comprehensive study of ancient Maya sculp- ture from Mexico and Central America, Prosk- ouriakoff (1950:4) proclaimed that the human figure was the central motif in Maya iconography. Indeed, the entire body was consistently represented on ancient Maya ceramics, codices, murals, stone reliefs, and portable objects, and the artists gave par- ticular attention to dress, faces, hands, and gestures (see Ancona-Ha et al. 2000; Miller 1999; Schele and Miller 1986). The present study stems from further</page><page sequence="2">420 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 4, 2002 struct features of ancient Maya beliefs and artistic canons from representations of the human body and hand use in iconography. Through its physical rep- resentation in art, the human body is joined with the social milieu to make visible some intriguing aspects of Classic Maya ideology, behavior, identity, and world order. I propose that Classic Maya art and cul- ture exhibited left/right symbolism and associated values and spatial organization that were ultimately derived from handedness and left/right symmetry of the human body. In the following discussion, studies of left/right symbolism are summarized and comparisons with contemporary Maya cultures and other societies are made. Moreover, an in-depth analysis in addition to statistical comparisons of Classic Maya representa- tions of people, hand use, body positioning, and left/right orientations from the iconographic corpus are presented. Specific observations and interpretations of Maya art regarding handedness, left/right figure place- ment, reversed orientations, and the associated cultural semantics for the ancient Maya are also provided. The analysis of the images on stone monuments and dec- orated ceramics in this study demonstrates that dis- tinct patterns and meaning encoded in iconography allude to an ancient Maya left/right dichotomy and pri- macy of the right. Hieroglyphic and linguistic infor- mation also lend support to this study of human body symbolism for the ancient Maya. Previous scholars have pointed out the comple- mentary dyads of left and right and how they shape behavior, cosmology, and symbolism in human soci- eties (see Boas 1955; Levi-Strauss 1963:245-268; Maybury-Lewis andAlmagor 1989; Needham 1973; Thuren 1988; Van Zantwijk et al. 1990). As these authors also show, left/right symbolism from the human body is one important means (together with backlfront, up/down, etc.) to order and express social structure, spatial organization, and ideology (see also Classen 1993; Gossen 1979; Hanks 1990; LaFlesche 1916;LopezAustin 1988:163-165,1996:109-131). Additionally, the work of other researchers demon- strates that the body is a key symbol and a transmit- ter of social information through its artistic depiction, spatial positioning, and metaphorical reference (Barkan 1975; Bourdieu 1977; Campbell 1974; Classen 1993; Douglas 1982; Hamilakis et al.2002; Hertz 1973; Houston and Cummins 1998; Joyce 1998, 2000; Laqueur 1990; Lopez Austin 1988; Monaghan 1994). Distinctions between the left and right in spatial orientation and the body are commonplace in con- temporary Maya cultures (see Earle 1986:163; Gossen 1974; Hunt 1977:95-115; Palka 2000). There is frequently a hierarchy (or ranked comple- mentarity) in these paired distinctions with a pre- eminence of the right for the Maya, which now can be linked to the distant past. In modern and colonial Mayan language dictionaries, for instance, the word for "right" signifies right hand, great, large, princi- pal and true, while "left" means lame, subordinate, left-handed, and untrue. There may have been sim- ilar meanings of left and right and the body in the Classic period and long before Colonial influences. Importantly, few studies have intensively ana- lyzed left and right symbolism, body orientation, and associated meaning in archaeological societies and how these are manifested in material culture- particularly in ancient art and architecture. Also, ethnographic data, iconographic analysis, and social theories of left/right symbolic classifications have not been generally brought together by Mesoamerican researchers. Previous work with myriad cultures, however, has demonstrated that specific left/right distinctions are present in iconography and that they relate to specific cultural practices, ideology, and worldview (seeAdorno 1982,2000:80-119; Classen 1993; Joyce 2000:74-75; Lopez-Baralt 1979; Palka 1999; Robins 1994; Tate 1999; Uhrbrock 1973; Uspensky 1975). The findings of these studies shed light on the ancient Maya case and can assist with the analysis of related body symbolism, ideology, and iconography in other cultures. The recurring symbolism and ideological princi- ples of left/right with regard to the body in Maya cul- ture may have a long and unbroken history from at least the Classic period (ca. A.D.400-900) to the pre- sent. As discussed below, the Maya primacy of the right side of the body, the right hand, and orientation to the right also may have ancient roots. But what are the origins and underlying meanings of Maya concepts of left and right, why do they permeate iconography, and how can the prime importance of this symbolism be explained anthropologically? This essay is not intended to be a structural-psychologi- cal analysis but a more relativist examination that relates comparable human behaviors to meanings and values of left/right body symbolism. Thus, the following section on relevant anthropological works specifically informs the Maya cultural complex and</page><page sequence="3">Joel W. Palka] LEFT/RIGHT SYMBOLISM IN ANCIENT MAYA ICONOGRAPHY 421 does not champion a collective subconscious or uni- versal view of left/right ideology and its material manifestations. Theoretical and Comparative Perspectives on Left/Right Symbolism and the Body A comparative background study of left/right sym- bolism, the corresponding cultural semantics, and their relation to the human body is necessary before we examine Classic Maya art and culture. What is interesting to note, and of special significance here, is that peoples across the globe classify, order, or con- ceptualize their world by referring to the left and right sides of the human body and their associated sym- bols and values (see Barsley 1966; Bliss and Morella 1980; Fritsch 1968; Needham 1973). In fact, a left/right symbolic dichotomy appears to be nearly universal cross-culturally, but the meanings, values, and semiotics of left and right are culture specific. In many societies, but not all (as in China; see Granet 1973), people perceive the right hand or "to the right" to be affiliated with masculinity, power, superordi- nates, and the sacred, whereas the "left" consistently represents either femininity, subordination, feeble- ness, or the profane, depending on the particular social and ceremonial circumstances. For example, in West- ern societies people shake with the right or "proper" hand, writing is from left to right, tools are largely designed for right-handers, and there are terms such as "leftists" and "sinistrals" (left-handers). Even in European art and particularly religious iconography, left and right distinctions in the treatment of bodies, handedness, and figure positioning are present. Explicit cultural and ideological meanings are also conveyed and there often is a preference for the right and right hand (see Uhrbrock 1973; Uspensky 1975). In other cultures, the left is the principal position and the viewing of images or reading order is from right to left (Corballis and Beale 1976:106-107; Granet 1973). The central point, however, is that there is a dichotomy, usually a hierarchical one, between left and right that can be manifested in behavior, spatial positioning, and material culture in many societies. In an insightful cross-cultural analysis, the father of left/right studies, Robert Hertz ( 1973), recognized that humans construct symbolic classifications regarding their bodies, society, and the cosmos based upon the use of their right and left hands. He estab- lished that people tend to look more positively on the right than the left, and associate the preferred right hand and direction with power, maleness, correct- ness, elites, etc. For Hertz, religious polarity, natural opposites, and divisions in human societies can be conceptualized in organic asymmetry of the left vs. the right side of the human body and the predomi- nance of the right hand (Hertz 1973:3-11). In many societies, terms for "right" often denote strength, dexterity, intelligence, good judgment, moral integrity, sacred power, legitimacy, aristocracy, and beauty. On the other hand (not only figuratively!), terms for "left" are directly contrastive, being asso- ciated with weak, profane, impure, malevolent, ple- beian, and dreaded qualities (Hertz 1973:11-12). Hertz argued that the prominence of the right, religious polarity, and dual symbolic classifications stem from body symmetry and right-handedness and that these had various biological, psychological, and, ultimately, social origins. He illustrated several examples of left/right symbolism and semantics that are useful here for a parallel perspective on ancient Maya culture and ideology: Among the Maori the right is the sacred side, the seat of good and creative powers; the left is the profane side, possessing no virtue other than certain disturbing and suspect powers . . . the right is the side of the gods; the left side is ded- icated to demons. Even today, the right hand is still called good and beautiful, and the left bad and ugly ... [Hertz 1973:12].... The gods are on our right, so we turn towards the right to pray. Sacred offerings are presented to the gods with the right hand. To bring about good effects in a ceremony, to bless or to consecrate, the Hindus and the Celts go three times round a person or an object, from left to right, like the sun, with the right side inwards. The contrary movement and attitude, in similar circum- stances, would be sacrilegious and unlucky [Hertz 1973:15]. Needham (1973), following Hertz, states that the pre-eminence of the right hand and the lesser impor- tance of the left hand, plus the natural body symmetry in humans, have important implications for the study of left vs. right symbolic and classificatory schemes. Needham writes: The issue can be studied in such varied fields as the Homeric poems, alchemy, and thirteenth- century French religious art, in Hindu iconogra- phy, classical Chinese state ceremonies, emblem books and bestiaries, as well as Maori ritual, Bornean divination, and the myths of the most disparate cultures.... The kiragu, insignia of power, are held in his left hand, and for this</page><page sequence="4">422 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 4, 2002 reason the Mugwe keeps his left hand always under cover of his mantle; a very special power in connection with his blessings is popularly attributed to his left hand; it is a source of great awe; respect and fear are felt for this hand, and no one may look on it without dying [Needham 1973:1 10]. Needham takes the analysis of right and left further by arguing that the symbolic opposition but balanced complementarities of the two hands and sides of the body is so common that it is intrinsic to the human mind, behavior, existence, and worldview. However, Needham did not elaborate on his comments regard- ing left/right symbolism in iconography, and while scholars may not agree with his theories, Needham's recognition of left/right organization in material cul- ture needs to be brought into the debate. Studies of Lefi/Right Symbolism and the Body in Iconography Concise examples of left/right organization in art, depictions of the body, and their cultural meanings provide additional comparative analogies for the ancient Maya. For instance, a left/right dichotomy and spatial order can be seen in handedness, figure positioning, and symbolism in ancient Egyptian stone carvings and murals. In this case, multiple human figures are spatially separated to the left or right of the image center and single portraits often look to their right (see Robins 1994). Egyptian men frequently sit or stand to the right of women, or they are placed in front of them, which is seen as equiv- alent to the right side the more important and pres- tigious position (Robins 1994:19). Additionally, the orientation and order of ancient Egyptian art and writing was left to right or right to left (Robins 1994:21). Moreover, right and left hands were fre- quently reversed on the arms of human figures. This was not due to the oversight of Egyptian artists but to the fact that certain objects had to be carried in the proper hands. For instance, hand reversal in Egypt- ian art was an important device to show that figures used only their left hands to carry certain staffs and their right hands to hold specific scepters. In addi- tion, human figures sometimes look contorted with reversed limbs or objects drawn behind and to the right of their bodies to indicate that they are in the right hand (Robins 1994: 1 S2 1 ) . In another case, Andean artists depicted men or male symbols on the pictorial right (on the right from the image's perspective, or the viewer's left) and women or female symbols on the pictorial left (viewer's right). Several studies indicate that from Precolumbian to post-Colonial times, the left con- noted "female, low, bad, and moon" whereas the right designated "male, high, good, and sun" in the Andes (see Adorno 1982, 2000:91-99; Classen 1993:12-25; Isbell 1976; Roe 1982:198-199). For example, a wall design purportedly from the Inka Temple of the Sun in Cuzco, Peru, contained a cos- mological scheme of a masculine/feminine duality mediated by a center with the male elements (man, sun, etc.) on the pictorial right and female elements (woman, moon, etc.) on the pictorial left (seeAdorno 2000:91; Classen 1993:20; Isbell 1976; Lopez-Bar- alt 1979). The Spanish reportedly destroyed an Inka idol representing a man facing the east (spatial or con- ceptual right) and a woman oriented to the west (con- ceptual left) (Classen 1993:22, endnote 42). Moreover, there appear to have been left/right divi- sions and symbolism in the settlement of Cuzco and corresponding Inka sociopolitical organization (see Lopez-Baralt 1979; Ziudema 1964). The illustra- tions by Andean artists, particularly those of Gua- man Poma, depict high-status indigenous nobles on the pictorial right with Spaniards and subordinates on the pictorial left (Adorno 1982). Also in these drawings the Inka creator deity holds the sun in his right hand and the moon in his left (see Classen 1993:19-25, 33-35), and people frequently face to their right while manipulating objects in their right hands or gesture to their right (see Adorno 2000:89-114; Classen 1993: 20-21, 119, 121, 123, 126; Lopez-Baralt 1979). In Hindu art, figures touch each other with their right hands, powerful supernaturals are shown to the viewer's right (vs. pictorial right), and deities manip- ulate certain objects and weapons in their right hands (Geschwind 1984:38-39; Zimmer 1946). These images probably signify the long history of a preem- inence of the right in South Asian societies. The pri- macy for the right in Hindu art may follow the ideology of the pure, correct, and strong right hand used for eat- ing, and the impure, incorrect, and weaker left hand traditionally used for cleaning one's body in South Asian cultures (Emeneau 1987). Here the right side of the body and right hand are also associated with maleness and strength (Beck 1973). With reference to gender ideology and left/right divisions in the art of South Asia, iconographic representations of the anthropomorphic half-woman Siva (Siva Ardanari)</page><page sequence="5">Joel W. Palka] LEFT/RIGHT SYMBOLISM IN ANCIENT MAYA ICONOGRAPHY 423 display the right side as a man and the left half as a woman (Beck 1973:396; Zimmer 1946:Figure 70). The relationship between left and right and gender is perhaps related to the preferred position of men to the right of women which facilitated the use of a man's pure right hand (Paul Hockings, personal communi- cation 2000; see Zimmer 1946:Figures 34 and 67). The SouthAsian iconography then reflects proper human behavior and provides a model for the order of the physical, social, and supernatural worlds as in the Egyptian and Andean cases. The importance of this comparative discussion is that it succinctly illus- trates that left/right corporeal symbolism is present and found in material culture in many societies. How- ever, interpretive research on human handedness, body symmetry, and left/right symbolism in art and architecture is needed to understand the origins, social semantics, and cross-cultural occurrence of left/right dichotomy. The rich data on the Maya and their art and ideology provide a prime opportunity for such a study. Left/Right Patterning and the Human Figure in Ancient Maya Iconography Investigators have long descnbed and interpreted Maya iconography, but they do not usually consider the overall structuring principles and the cultural templates behind the organization and creation of Maya images and hieroglyphic texts. Numerous scholars have casually mentioned, but not adequately explained, the patterned handedness and left and right placement of individuals in ancient Maya art and, by extension, in ritual and social life. For exam- ple, it has been generally noticed that the viewer of Maya art scans the scenes from left to right like a "supplicant would approach a high ranking individ- ual" (Houston 1998:341). Additionally, when view- ing many facades and murals in Classic Maya architecture, it is generally known that the movement is typically from the viewer's left to right. Conse- quently, we need to ask why the viewer is guided to the right in Maya art and why specific individuals face to their right and use their hands in specific ways. In examining these questions we explore new avenues in the study of ancient Maya beliefs, social order, and worldview. Figure Orientation and Social Status in Maya Art The pattern of left to right appears to be one of the fundamental organizing principles for structure and meaning in ancient Maya art and spatial reference. Generally, the human body is depicted in frontal or profile view, but heads are almost always shown in profile facing to the right or left. Body-length figure portraits that face to their right (the pictorial per- spective right or the viewer's left) and hold objects in their right hands are commonplace in Maya sculp- ture, murals, codices, and portable objects (Figure 1) as a perusal of Maya art books will demonstrate. When multiple individuals are shown, people of sub- ordinate status approach a superordinate noble from left to right and move toward the right side of the superordinate (Figure 2). Additionally, Maya hiero- glyphs are read from left to right and they facilitate the left to right viewing of the images. Furthermore, drawings of hands and arm gestures often indicate the direction of action. For example, the direction of movement of Venus is symbolized in a Maya-influ- enced mural at Cacaxtla, Mexico, where footprints on a band of Venus signs lead clockwise from a right hand to a left hand (Figure 3). In this case the right hand appears on the east; in the Maya paintings of Rio Azul Tomb 12, the viewer's right is similarly associated with the hieroglyph for east (Milbrath 1999:72-73). Movements to the right or left, or in a clockwise or counterclockwise manner, are common in Mesoamerican iconography and they are related to the perceived structure of the sky, the cardinal points, the journey of the sun, and the body (Gossen 1979; Hall 1997: 133-137; Milbrath 1999: 17-23, 7s74; Robin 2000:213-216). The overall left/right structure with human fig- ures in Classic Maya iconography can be understood by considering handedness, social rank, and sym- bolic action in ancient Maya culture (Palka 1999, 2000). When multiple human figures are shown on Maya monuments and ceramics, they face each other across a zone of contact with the peak figure (a super- ordinate, a leader in ritual, and most socially impor- tant person in the image) looking and gesturing to his or her right (following Houston 1998:341-344). Hence, the peak figure is typically to the right and the subordinate to the left in Maya images accord- ing to the perspective of the viewer (see Figure 2). In a common Maya scene, a kneeling or submissive subordinate approaches the zone of contact toward the right hand and right half of the body of the peak figure. The peak figure in Maya art can usually be iden-</page><page sequence="6">424 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 4, 2002 Figure 1.

See Coe (1999:115). tified as a noble man or woman who is seated on a throne, leads the ritual or action, or is shown stand- ing in a commanding frontal pose. The peak figure is often the individual of highest status in the scene who i.s identified by glyphic titles, more elaborate dress, and accompanying attendants. Subordinates, or nonpeak figures, are usually attendants, lesser nobles, warriors, and captives who are identified by their dress, appearance, and hieroglyphic titles. These subordinates, who wear less-ornate clothing, kneel</page><page sequence="7">Joel W. Palka] LEFT/RIGHT SYMBOLISM IN ANCIENT MAYA ICONOGRAPHY 425 A l 2 : 2 -4 8 A B Figure 2. Maya ruler Bird Jaguar and subordinate lord at the zone of contact. The ruler (b) leads with the right side of his body and right hand, while the subordinate (a) leads with his left hand (Lintel 9, Yaxchilan, Mexico; Graham 1977:29; cour- tesy of Ian Graham). or stand in profile view to the side of the peak fig- ure and gesture in submission with their hands held down or on their shoulders (see Ancona-Ha et al. 2000 and Schele and Miller 1986 for examples). In addition, men are frequently placed to the viewer's right (and facing their own right) as peak figures, and noble women to the viewer's left (and facing their own left) as subordinates in relation to the zone of contact (Palka 1999, 2000; Schele and Miller 1986:275). Joyce (1996, 2000:75) also observes that many stone monuments depicting elite women are placed to the left of monuments por- traying noble males. Generally, then, movement to the right and associations with the right side of the body are often preferred for high-status individuals, peak figures, and men in ancient Maya art. Quantifying and Understanding Classic Maya Figure Placement In support of the observations discussed above, a quantitative comparison of left/right figure orienta- tion in a large sample of ceramics1 (n = 448) and stone monuments2 (n = 349), two of the most common forms of Classic Period Maya art, was undertaken. These objects date from approximately A.D. 400-900 and are from southern lowland Maya sites</page><page sequence="8">426 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 4, 2002 Figure 3.

Illustrations from the available sources were examined for left/right figure orientation: quan- tities and percentages of left vs. right placement and hand use, and indeterminate cases were recorded (Figures 4, 5, and 6). The results indicate that nearly 90 percent of individual portraits and people facing one direction in a procession, ritual, or dance look to their right (see Figure 1) and hold objects or ges- ture with their right hands. Additionally, when peo- ple interact in the zone of contact (see Figure 2) and a superordinate figure can be clearly identified, the superordinate faces his/her right while favoring the right hand about 80 percent of the time; conversely, subordinates are oriented toward their left. Samples of Maya art in this study (see Tables 1 and 2 for exam- ples) were independently checked by two colleagues who confirmed the same identification of figure placement, superordinate vs. subordinate individu- als, and a basic left/right orientation.3 The findings indicate a strong tendency for right orientation and right-hand use for higher ranking and socially important individuals in Maya art. Do the images reflect the usual number of noble right- handers that were born (about 90 percent in human populations)? It is also possible that right-handed scribes created scenes of right-oriented figures because their visual perception and direction of draw- ing/carving favors the right (see Coe and Kerr 1998:147; Corballis and Beale 1976:106-108). However, like some Maya stone stelae at Tikal (see Jones and Satterthwaite 1982), images showing indi- vidual portraits facing to their left, instead of the right, date to the earlier part of the Classic period (Early to Middle Classic period, or A.D. 400-600). They may have been paired with right-oriented ste- lae or maybe commissioned before the left/right organization and iconographic standards were firinly established in Late Classic Maya art, but this remains to be clarified in future studies. Also, some figures facing their left were possibly made by artists to illustrate ritual reversals and contrary movement toward the left to emphasize the sacred nature of the ceremony (see below). The figures oriented to their left or using their left hands are often deities, deity impersonators, or individuals depicted in the Other- world (see Coe and Kerr 1998:104, 106; Kerr 1989:65, File no. 1183, andp. 67, File no. 1196; Schele and Miller 1986:214, Figure V.5a), thus a contrary presentation or reversed action and hand- edness known for the supernatural realm may be indicated. Furthermore, some painted ceramics showing contrary left-oriented figures appear to be fakes and others may have been made by nonelite artisans who were less skilled and less versed in the artistic canons of Classic period art. In these cases, the false hiero- glyphic texts are not readable, human and deity fig- ures are poorly executed, and the creators did not follow Maya leftlright conventions with hand use and figure orientation typically seen in elite Maya art. The sculpture at the site of Yaxchilan, Mexico, has a dis- proportionate number of superordinate figures ori- ented to their left, which is possibly due to the large quantity of right-oriented images of noble women and subordinates leading rituals under the aegis of</page><page sequence="9">Face Right Face Left Indeterminate Totals Portraits n=173 (88%) n=23 (12%) n=0 (0%) n=196 (100%) Peak Figures n=196 (77%) n=l9 (8%) n-37 (15%) n=252 (100%) Combined n-369 (82.5%) n=42 (9.5%) n=37 (8%) n=448 (100%) Portraits: Anthropomoxphic figures facing one direction (single individuals, processions, etc.) Peak Figure: Superordinate orientation at zone of contact (two figures interacting) Indeterminate: Orientation of figures is unclear or peak figure could not be identified Figure 4.

LefURight Figure Orientation: Maya Ceramics and Monuments Combined. their king (see Robin 2000). These monuments were commemorated for the subordinates, who were act- ing as peak figures, and thus illustrate them correctly oriented to their right and being right-handed. Addi- tionallyS there are many pairings of monuments fac- ing each other at Yaxchilan-one to the left and the other to the right of a central image or stairway affecting figure placement. If examples from the early part ofthe Classic period (before A.D. 600) and all the Yaxchilan monuments are removed from the sample, the percentage of right-oriented high-status figures approaches 95 percent. Preliminary obser- vations on Maya carved shell, bone, jade, painted murals, and especially the codices, also indicate a similar high percentage of the right-oriented indi- viduals and peak figures. But why are superiors, leaders of ritual, peak fig- ures, and men depicted more often facing to their right and having the right sides of their bodies toward the zone of contact? Why aren't portraits and cen- tral figures placed at least 50 percent of the time fac- ing left? First, in Maya iconography it was critical that supreme elites, rulers, and important persons be illustrated with the body in frontal view while fac- ing to their right or the proper direction. This type of presentation effectively portrayed them in their regal splendor and situated them to their right or true, powerful, and dexterous side. Second, the desired structure in Maya art was to first and foremost show the superordinates and peak figures gesturing or manipulating objects only with their right hands and using their correct, strong, and principle limb to their right at the zone of contact. The subordinates or non- peak figures seen in the normal frontal view are forced to use their left or weaker, secondary hands toward the peak figure at the zone of contact (see Fig- ure 2). However, the subordinates can be depicted right-handed toward the zone of contact if they are shown in the less-important profile view, where the front of the body is not seen (but see Kerr 1989:39, File no. 717, for a right-handed and a left-handed scribe in profile). Interestingly, some figures on the left of the zone of contact from the viewer's per- spective even have right hands placed on their left arms to compensate for right-handedness (Figure 7; see also Ancona-Ha et al. 2000).</page><page sequence="11">Table 1.

Palka] LEFT/RIGHT SYMBOLISM IN ANCIENT MAYA ICONOGRAPHY 429 In Maya iconography superordinate figures had to appear on the viewer's right in order to be shown using their right or "proper" hands at the zone of con- tact while in the standard frontal view. Thus, accord- ing to Maya artistic conventions, kings and important personages should not be typically placed to the viewer's left and using their left or incorrect and sec- ondary hands. With this corporeality, Maya ruling elites set themselves apart socially, physically, and ritually from others (Houston and Cummins 1998). These depictions of handedness and figure orienta- tion also show that Maya iconography directly rep- resented the person or was connected to the self (Houston and Stuart 1998) and may indicate actual spatial positioning and hierarchy in ritual. Moreover, the structure and layout of Maya art confirms that viewers are integral actors in the scene and witnesses to the events immortalized in the images. The super- ordinate was placed on the viewer's right and the viewer moves from left to right, which is the proper and respectful direction, while reliving the events and approaching the image of the superordinate figure. Maya images then were structured from both an internal pictorial perspective and external viewer's point of view with regard to left and right to preserve the events and positions of the participants and wit- nesses as they actually happened. Left/Right Symbolism and Meaning in Classic Maya Art and Society The primacy of the right and the use of the right hand by superordinate persons and central figures in the images appear to be of critical importance in Clas- sic Maya iconography. Moreover, the heightened significance of the right side of the body and right- handedness apparently reflects cultural meanings, symbolism, and values in ancient Maya society or at least in elite culture. In fact, the percentage of right- oriented figures in ancient Maya art is so high that forgeries (especially left-handed figures in contem- porary tourist art), accidentally reversed images in publications (see Kerr 2000:957, File no. K6294, for reversed figures and text; Miller 1999: 165, No.143, for incorrect left-handed scribe), pieces from partic- ular artists or workshops (see Reents-Budet 1994:29&gt;309 for distinctive left-oriented Holmul</page><page sequence="12">430 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 4, 2002 Figure 7.

KS 103), can be easily spotted since the standards of Maya right orientation, hand use, and preemi- nence of the right are violated. In the predictable leftlright structure in the Classic period images, the Maya elite presented the expected order of their world and proper patterns of human behavior. Mirror Imaging and Maya Ritual Reversals It is crucial to note that some scenes and texts on high- quality ancient Maya carved stone monuments and painted pottery purposely indicate a contrary view- ing order from right to left instead of the normal left to right direction. For example, a Maya sculpture shows a reversed text and the Yaxchilan king Bird Jaguar (Yaxun Balam) holding a spear unconven- tionally in his left hand while facing uncharacteris- tically to his left toward a kneeling subordinate lord (Figure 8). When this monument is mirrored, the text and images are corrected: the ruler Bird Jaguar is now on the right of the zone of contact, his sub- ordinate is on his right, and the king now brandishes his spear properly in his right hand and a shield in his left. The subordinate noble now becomes a left- handed spear user and positioned correctly to the viewer's left of the zone of contact. This monument, which was commissioned by or for the subordinate noble, glorifies the taking of war captives by both nobles and possibly depicts a reversal of Maya sta- tuses and roles. What is intriguing is that either fig- ure can be shown as being right-oriented and right-handed in the original or in the mirrored ver- sion, a situation that would cleverly honor both nobles. This may be a common convention in Maya art, especially in the Yaxchilan area, since there are several examples showing interacting nobles that are reversed. In another case, the text on Lintel 25 from Yax- chilan, which depicts the ceremonial conjuring by a royal woman of a serpent deity oftheYaxchilan king Shield Jaguar (Itzamna Balam), is written backwards from right to left (see Schele and Miller 1986:187). The mirror image of Lintel 25 presents a correct, readable inscription down to the fine details within the hieroglyphs, and the serpent deity with the emerg- ing high-status male noble is now correctly on the viewer's right and the woman on the left. Once again, either the royal woman or the noble is in the preferred position on the viewer's right and right-oriented. Finally, images of Maya nobles on the Structure 11 bench at Copan, Honduras (see Schele and Freidel 1990:326-327) are not left-handed people as they are shown. These bench figures, which are nobles or quite possibly elite ancestors, are found to the viewer's left of a central text describing the acces- sion of a Copan king (Schele and Miller 1986: 124-126,130). This bench is simply another exam- ple of mirrored iconography as attested by the reversed reading order of the hieroglyphs upon which the figures sit; they become right-handed and the hieroglyphs legible when the image is flipped. Intriguingly, similar to Maya reversed art, the text and image on the left half of the La Mojarra Stela (see Sharer 1994:87, Figure 3.6; Winfield 1988) from</page><page sequence="13">Joel W.

(Right) Mirrored image with readable glyphic text and right-hand use by Bird Jaguar (drawn by author from Mayer 1995: Plate 258). Veracruz is also mirrored, and the human figure even has a right hand (holding a mirror?) attached to his left arm. I suggest that some reversed images in Maya and Mesoamerican art may represent either ritual rever- sals, events associated with the supernatural and the Otherworld, or scenes reflected in ceremonial mir- rors. Direction of movement, behaviors and actions, symbolism, and hand use are often reversed during sacred rituals and for invoking the supernatural, ancestors, and death in many cultures, including those of indigenous North America (see Hall 1997:132-139) and, specifically, of Mesoamerica (see Myerhoff 1974:147-150, 170, 185-188, 255-258; John Monaghan, personal communication 2001). Also, mirrors and the reversed images seen in them were of prime importance in Mesoamerican ritual (see Taube 1992); they were central for con- tact with the spirit world and necessary for showing the reversed supernatural realm and the contradic- tions of the Otherworld. Ritual reversals and mirrored images make the ceremonial act more profound and they remind the participants of proper human behav- ior, life in the sacred realm, the contrary world of the deities and ancestors, and the structure of the cos- mos. People observing ritual reversals also channel sacred power, they are in direct contact with the supernatural, and they have high social rank and greater religious knowledge. As pointed out below, the contemporary Tzotzil Maya of Chiapas also observe similar ritual reversals and switched hand- edness that probably originated in ancient times. It is conceivable that reversed images are tangi- ble examples of mirror writing (following Corballis and Beale 1976: 178-183) in ancient Maya art. Mir- ror images and left/right reversals may have reflected the special, sacred abilities of the scribes and artists. These mirrored images are typically interpreted by scholars as monuments designed to be seen by Maya deities and ancestors (Schele and Freidel 1990:327) or used to switch the normal viewing order to indi- cate rituals taking place inside a structure (see Schele and Miller 1986:187). Alternatively, some of these reversed sculptures are seen as representing female agency and speech vs. the regular male-oriented images (see McAnany and Plank 2001:116-118). Also, if paint was applied to reversed sculpture as with a modern ink stamp, visually correct images could be produced on cloth or paper. Lastly, it is pos- sible that reversed images and texts in these archi- tectural sculptures were created to facilitate their viewing at various angles by people entering or using</page><page sequence="14">432 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 4, 2002 B A Figure 9.

I believe that the mirrored or reversed designs were intended by the artists to make the sculptures, their creators, and the people depicted more unique, powerful, and in closer contact with deities, ances- tors, and sacred realms. The capability of mirror writing is often a unique talent of left-handed and ambidextrous people, such as Leonardo da Vinci, or persons who have suffered damage to their right cerebral hemisphere (Corballis and Beale 1976: 178-183), but it would be diff1cult to identify such Maya artists. The ingenious creators of these unique Maya monuments with their flipped designs likely were even more revered by their patrons and peers, who may have regarded the gifted artists as being imbued with supernatural powers and special abil- ities. The presentation of a mirrored text and image, which would be immediately recognized by the viewer as being reversed and more sacred, would have been held in exceptional awe and reverence by all much like the way Leonardo's famous reversed right to left texts and pictures are viewed today. The unique powers and abilities of noble Maya scribes may partially explain why their names and titles are incised or painted on many of their works; they were sufficiently important to sign their special creations. Dexterous Maya Nobles and Left-Handed Enemies Other intriguing effects and reversed placement of figures occur in Maya imagery when people are shown wielding spears and shields while in the stan- dard frontal position. Since warriors and "normal, superior, and good" humans use their right hands to brandish a spear and their left hands to hold shields, some adjustments had to be made with regards to the left/right structure, placement of individuals, and hand use. Hence, warriors are frequently shown unconventionally on the viewer's left with the left sides of their bodies entering the zone of contact so that their shields do not block their frontally viewed bodies. In this manner they can accurately be shown as right-handed spear users and properly grabbing shields or captives with their left hands while in unobstructed frontal view. Warriors properly using a spear in the right hand and a shield in the left while in frontal view can actually be shown oriented to their right and entering the zone of contact with the right sides of their bodies, but their posture and handed- ness become confused (Figure 9). The body is often shown in a contorted manner but the use of the spear in the right hand is clear: the artist placed the spear passing behind and to the right of the head and a right hand is shown grasping the spear (see similar tech- niques in the central Mexican manuscript El Lienzo</page><page sequence="15">Joel W. Palka] LEFT/RIGHT SYMBOLISM IN ANCIENT MAYA ICONOGRAPHY 433 Figure 1(). Maya battle scene with victorious right-handed warriors to viewer's left and defeated left-handed enemies to viewer's right (Room 2 of Bonampak murals, Chiapas, Mexico; after Miller 1986, Plate 2). de Tlclxccllcl [Chavero 1979] and in the Cacaxtla murals [Baird 1989; McVicker 1985]). Ostensibly, it was more important to depict ancient Maya elites, combatants? and peak figures holding objects in their right hands than to have the left sides of their bodies entering the zone of con- tact. A faiscinating illustration of Maya handedness, figure placement, and left/right symbolism can be found in the battle scene on the Classic period painted murals at Bonampak, Mexico (see Figure 10). The victorious Bonampak king and army are shown on the viewer's left so that they may wield their spears in their right hands and be unobstructed by the shields in their left hands. They clash with enemy soldiers on the viewer's right. What is particularly interest- ing is that the defeated enemies are all left-handed ! It is doubtful that this army of southpaws was like the feared 400 left-handed biblical soldiers under Benjamin ("son of the right hand") or high-status Aztec fighters mimicking their patron deity Huitzilopochtli ("Hummingbird of the left"). More- over, Miller ( 1986: 1 10) observes that for some per- plexing reason a few conquered enemy warriors in the Bonampak murals have two left hands and some victors have two right hands. It seem.s likely that this particular doubling of right or left hands wa.s inten- tional. I suggest that the creators of the murals emphasized that the enemy soldiers were left-handed combatants who were inferior, lame, weak, impure, and perhaps more feminine, and were destined to be beaten in battle. The double right-handed victors, however, were depicted as superior, powerful, pure, and righteous. Defeated left-handed warriors (shields in their right hands and spears in their left hands) are also seen in the Maya-influenced murals of Cacaxtla, Mexico (see Baird 1989; McVicker 1985) and on decorated Maya ceramics (see Kerr 1989: 14, File no. 503). In the Codex Nuttall (Miller 1975, see codex pages 70 and 75), a Mixtec manuscript from Oax- aca, Mexico, right hands are frequently drawn on left arms of spear-wielding nobles to indicate the pref- erence for right-handed warriors. Some important deity figures in the art of ancient central Mexico are also sometimes shown with two right hand.s or two left hands as in the Mexican Codex Borgia (see Diaz</page><page sequence="16">434 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 4, 2002 1 2 3 4 A 7 X 3 S B ;,,,, g g C W &gt;) Figure 11.

"right hand sun-eyed one?" and Rodgers 1993:22, Plate 56), possibly to signal their varying roles, statuses, and behaviors. Hand- edness, figure orientation, and left/right structured meaning can also be seen in Precolumbian Olmec, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, and Aztec art in Mexico (see images in Berdan and Anawalt 1997; Berlo 1992; Marcus 1992; Tate 1999). Hands in Maya Hieroglyphs and Art In Classic Maya hieroglyphs, and as exemplified in other ancient scripts such as Zapotec (Marcus 1992:97,244,326,398,401) andEgyptian (McDer- mott 2001: 19, 21-24), the human body and its con- stituent parts, including heads, eyes, feet, and hands, have specific phonetic and semantic values. Along with heads, disembodied hands are the most com- mon body images in Maya writing and the left and right hands convey specific meanings (see Coe and Van Stone 2001; Harris and Stearns 1997; and Thompson 1962 for catalogs of Maya glyphs). Since fingernails, structure of the digits, and palm lines are almost always shown correctly, there is rarely con- fusion with the identification of a left vs. a right hand, except for when the digits are overlapping or if fin- gernails appearjuxtaposed with palms. Moreover, the hands are the most frequently repeated individual signs in the Maya syllabary (Coe and Van Stone 2001: 157-160) and the phonetic values shift depend- ing on whether a left or right hand is depicted (Fig- ure 1 1). Some of these hand glyphs may graphically represent words, concepts, and/or syllables from hand signals much like "two [too] or v [vee]" (g) and "in [in] or d [dee]" () in American Sign Language icons. In Maya logographic writing, hand imagery is essential since many signs represent the actions of holding, scattering, touching, and possessing with the hands (see also Tornkins 1969). Surprisingly, in Maya verb logographs the right hand is commonplace but it does notpredominate; sin- gle left hands also had considerable importance in Maya writing (see Figure 11). Whereas most glyphs are oriented to or face the viewer's left, hand glyphs point to the viewer's left or right and up or down depending on the particular sign. For example, the glyph for "conjure/bring forth" (the logograph TSAK) usually consists of a left hand grasping a fish and the ideographic sign for "grasp, hold, or take possession" (CH'AM) always incorporates a left hand that points to the viewer's left. However, hieroglyphs for "bind- ing/wraping a monument" (K'AL) and the "flat hand verb" contain only right hands usually facing the viewer's right. Hieroglyphs or ideographs for "to write" or "writing/painting" (TZ'IB) invariably depict right hands facing left while holding scribal imple- ments (see Figure 12). Interestingly, hieroglyphs for "completion" (TSUTS) show a right hand pointing to the viewer's right, but some early versions of this sign have a left hand pointing to the viewer's right.</page><page sequence="17">Joel W. Palka] LEFT/RIGHT SYMBOLISM IN ANCIENT MAYA ICONOGRAPHY 435 p,% r J A B c E D Figure 12. Disembodied hands in Maya iconography: (a) Hand prints for eyes and mouth on "face shield" (ceramic plate 3642 from http://famsi.saiph.com/dataSpark/maya); (b) Death God of Zero with right hand on mouth (drawn from Schele and Miller 1986:54, Figure 45); (c) Right hand with brush within serpent mouth (redrawn from Coe 1999:124, Figure 68); (d) Right hand print with "eye" or palm lines (drawn from Miller 1986:Plate 62); (e) "Right hand staff" from the Dresden Codex (drawn from Coe 1999:211, Figure 143). Artistic requirements or constraints do not appear to explain the set patterns of the various Maya hand hieroglyphs; right or left hands and different direc- tions of orientation technically could have technically been used equally and interchangeably in Maya writ- ing, but they were not. Perhaps particular hands and hand use were important to specific ceremonies or these signs may have been visual clues to the direc- tion that the viewer approached or witnessed the cer- emonies (Stephen Houston, personal communication 2002). It is quite possible that left and right hands in Maya verb hieroglyphs have additional linguistic, iconographic, or semantic aspects that have eluded identification since we currently lack the cultural information to understand this "sign language." In a recent study, Stuart (2002) may have identi- fied the Maya hieroglyphs for "left and/or left hand" and "right and/or right hand." The preliminary deci- pherment of left and right glyphs followed his exam- ination of Maya terms for the cardinal directions, movement of the sun, and body orientation with the sun's path. The probable hieroglyph for right or right hand consists of the superfix glossed as Mayan NOH, or "large, great, and right," over a hand (appears to be a right hand) sign K'AB' (see Figure 11). The hieroglyph for left or left hand is a sign possibly meaning TZ'EJ, which in some Mayan languages means "sideways and left," over a hand glyph (Stu- art 2002:2). In one case the glyphs forright/righthand (noh k'ab') and left/left hand (tz'ej k'ab') appear between the names of two individuals and may sig- nify that they are crucial parts of a social or politi- cal body, "a left-hand and a right-hand man," or that one is right-handed and the other left-handed. Indeed, Stuart (2002:3-4) suggests that other related hand signs glossed as "the left/right hand of the sun" may describe left/right qualities and bodily features of the sun god or state the directions to the left or right of the sun. By building on his interpretations, these glyphs could actually indicate a title approximated as "left or right-handed sun-faced one." Also, a hiero- glyph illustrated by Stuart (2002:4, Figure 7c) may possibly be read as "left-handed AJAW (noble)" (see Figure 11). Individual left- or right-hand signs and hand prints are also common in Maya iconography (see Figure 12; also Coe 1999:127, Figure 70 [for left hand in headdress], Coe 1999: 179, Figure 121; Coe and Kerr 1998:213, Plate 113; Reents-Budet 1994:43, Figure 2.9). These symbols may carry specific linguistic features or ideological meanings of leftlright and human handedness. Grasping hands, tactile sensa- tion, and handedness are central components of human physiology, and people communicate and largely experience the world through their hands. Hands are crucial for daily tasks and rituals and their #:t</page><page sequence="18">436 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 4, 2002 features often have supernatural connotations or are used to tell much about the person (Reid 1999). Thus, it is no wonder that the hand, usually the right hand, is a powerful and meaningful symbol in Maya iconography and in other artistic traditions. In Maya depictions of people, accurately ren- dered hands hold objects, gesture, touch, and relay information to the viewer. Disembodied hands and hand prints express cultural meanings that are not well-understood. Hand imagery may be related to the all encompassing power and control of elites and elite bodies or it may represent the importance of hands in certain rituals and everyday life. Disembodied hands can be linked to the whole body and essence of the person to whom they are associated (follow- ing Ellen 1977:346-357). The sense of touch may also be conveyed by hand symbols (Houston and Taube 2000:26&gt;265). Furthermore, hands and hand prints may have been important fertility symbols, warrior markings, and supernatural portals in Mesoamerica and throughout indigenous North America (Hall 1997: 126-127). Forexample, Xquik, a supernatural being and the mother of the Hero Twins of the K'iche' (Quiche) Maya Popol Vuh, was impregnated when a skull hanging in a tree spit into her right hand (Tedlock 1985: 114,274). In addition, hand imagery is often combined with mouths and eyes (Figure 12; see Coe 1999:222, Figure 150; Miller 1986, Plate 62), which are symbolic openings to the supernatural. The understanding of Maya hand iconography and hieroglyphs is an important step for the comprehension of ancient Maya concepts of the body, ideology, and left/right symbolism. The Significance of the Body in Maya Left/Right Symbolism The preference for the right and the right hand in Maya art and society can be approached anthropo- logically through ethnographic analogy and com- parative analysis. Although studies of left and right symbolism have mostly ignored evidence from mate- rial culture, the findings here indicate that the semi- otics of left and right actually influenced the creation of iconography and architecture for the ancient Maya and other societies. Researchers generally stress the balanced complementary nature of left/right dichotomies and meanings in various cultures. How- ever, the right appears to be more frequently associ- ated with higher rank, social standing, and political power than the left in Maya culture and other soci- eties. Thus, there is a hierarchical value system that structures, separates, and ranks the complementary pairings of left and right and their associated social semantics (see also Adorno 1982; Dumont 1982; Turner 1984). Contemporary Maya Left/Right Body Symbolism and Meaning A discussion of left and right symbolism and corre- sponding cultural connotations and values from diverse Maya ethnographic sources provide analogs for the reconstruction and understanding of ancient Maya ideology. There are disjunctions in time and culture (ancient elites vs. contemporary Maya), but we cannot ignore modern Maya left/right body sym- bolism in the reconstruction of Classic Maya elite beliefs. Ethnographies of various Maya groups demonstrate that the left and right hands and sides of the human body are symbolically significant and help structure their world (see Tedlock 1992:133-138, 176-178). For the modern Maya there are specific meanings and values associated with the left and right halves of the body, which are manifested in ritual, material culture, language, and in the social realm. Moreover, there is often a preeminence of the right side of the body and the right hand in this symbol- ism. The Maya huipil, or woman's blouse, for instance, is described as an outline or "map" of the human body (Hendrickson 1995:156-158). The left/right asymmetry in colors and designs often vis- ible in Maya dress may physically differentiate between the unequal left and right sides of the body and their corresponding cultural meanings (see also Morris 1987: 105-110). Based on the wide distribu- tion of the corroborating evidence at hand, I suggest that contemporary Maya left/right symbolism and meaning are largely indigenous manifestations and not the result of postconquest influences. According to Earle (1986: 163), for the K'iche' (Quiche) Maya of highland Guatemala the "first and most reduced spatial domain is the human body . . . the body is used as a spatial referent with regard to fixed things." He further states that the K'iche' acknowledge the symmetries, inequalities, and dif- ferences in the body's left and right halves (Earle 1986: 164; also Tedlock 1992: 133-146). Both the left side and hand (u mox) are viewed as being "crazy, stupid," and the right (u wiquik'ab) is the "main or chief hand." When K'iche' shamans perform div- ination, pulses located in the body are critical to the</page><page sequence="19">Joel W. Palka] LEFT/RIGHT SYMBOLISM IN ANCIENT MAYA ICONOGRAPHY 437 rite; negative prognostications are associated with feelings in the left side and positive ones in the right. Upon entering a K'iche' house, the kitchen and women's domestic space is found to the person's left side, and the altar room and location where men receive guests is found to the right. Interestingly, possible artifactual evidence of analogous left/right spatial divisions has been found by Inomata (1995:816) on well-preserved house floor assem- blages at the Classic Maya site of Aguateca, Guatemala. Here domestic artifacts and female fig- urines were to the left of the building entrances, and drinking vessels, stone tools, and ritual items of a pos- sible male domain were to the right. Similar symbolic meanings and spatial orienta- tions associated with left and right are found in Tzotzil Maya culture in highland Chiapas, Mexico (see Vogt 1992). In modern Tzotzil, batz'i means "right" and also "actual, true, and the most repre- sentative" as in batz 'i k'ob, or "right hand, real hand, and true hand" (Gossen 1979:119). The left side of the body is also considered to be the feminine half of humans (Gossen 1974:41). During rituals the Tzotzil move to the right and often in a counter- clockwise circular path that mimics the movement of the sun because "Our Father's heart [of the sun] prefers the right hand way" (Gossen 1979: 119). At gatherings senior males stand or sit on the right while junior males and subordinates are placed to the left (Gossen 1979: 127). To emphasize the primacy ofthe right, important Tzotzil Maya officials touch the sacred household altars only with the back of their right hands during prayer and ritual (Rosaldo 1968:527). In joking relations and in reversals, Tzotzil men manipulate objects with their left hands instead of their right to physically point out the oppo- sitions and things that divide human relations (Ros- aldo 1968:534). Wisdom (1940:337, 428) states that the Ch'orti' (Chortl) Maya of eastern Guatemala believe that a sinister sorcerer will cross his left leg over his right knee and rub his left calf wherein resides the malev- olent patron spirit. Curers and diviners are charac- terized as good and beneficial people who have their companion spirits in their right or "good" leg. When an evil sorcerer maltreats an object, long spines are run through it with the left hand to cause more dam- age (Wisdom 1940:338, 428). For the Ch'orti', the Devil makes himself known to people by presenting his horrible left hand (Wisdom 1940:428). The Ch'orti' linguistic term for "left," tz'ej, is also glossed as "left handed, not equal, or sad" (Perez Martinez et al. 1996:229). The Yukatek (Yucatec) Maya feel that the left hand is essentially the angry or sinister hand. In the Yukatekan languages, the root for "left," ts'ik, liter- ally means "angry and vicious" (like belligerent wasps), and it signifies "lame, stupid, and disgraced one" (see Barrera Vasquez 1991:883-884; Bruce 1979:234; Hanks 1990:91; Ukich and Ukich 1976). The Yukatek word for "right/right hand," noh, sig- nifies "great, principle, large, true, and just" (Bar- rera Vasquez 1991:572-573; Ulrich and Ulrich 1976). Hanks (1990:90) discusses how left andright are also important in body orientation and spatial ref- erence inYukatek Maya society. Movement from or toward the right of a person is morally positive and superior, but movement and orientation to the left is morally negative orbad (Hanks 1990:9s94; see also Redfield 1964:132). Yukatek shamans move to the left to bind or wrap an altar and to the right to unbind an altar during ritual (Hanks 1990:387-389). To summarize, in ritual and everyday life for con- temporary highland and lowland Maya societies there are left/right symbolisms and meanings related to the human body that may govern where people stand, move during ceremonies, and determine which hands are used for manipulating certain objects. In all cases there is a general preeminence of the right hand, side of the body, and direction of movement, and a subordination of the left. The right in general is also associated with benevolent and high-status people, which may parallel the ancient Maya situa- tion. Similar beliefs and practices relevant to hand use and body orientation appear to have been observed with the Classic Maya and were encoded in their iconography. Conclusions: Interpreting Ancient Maya Left/Right Symbolism and Ideology Following the ethnographic studies, cross-cultural information, social theory, and observations of Clas- sic Maya iconography presented above, a general interpretation of ancient Maya left/right symbolism in depictions of the human body can be offered. The direction of left to right in ritual and viewing of iconography and writing was the desired and expected movement another direction of move- ment, especially toward the left, would be sacrile- gious, improper, or a ritual reversal. As is the case</page><page sequence="20">438 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 4, 2002 universally, the majority of the Classic Maya were also born right-handed and this hand was probably preferred for writing, manipulating objects, fight- ing, and eating. Thus the right hand and side of the body made up the strong, dexterous, and "pure" half of a normal human being, and, therefore, Classic Maya rulers, superordinates, and leaders of ritual and action utilized their right and strong, proper, powerful, and skillful hands. They did this while they faced to their right and kept the right sides of their bodies toward others and the action taking place. The ancient Maya may even have been reared and socialized to be right-handed, a proposition that should be explored further through iconographic and osteological analysis. The use of the left hand and the presentation of the left side of the body are found with subordinates and people of lesser relative social significance than the peak figure or protagonist. These people were usually of secondary political and ritual importance, and thus they were left-oriented and socially domi- nated. Subordinates and nonruling elites were nec- essary to ritual life and the social order, but they were depicted as different and not of equal status to the peak figures. The use of the left hand may have occurred in ritual reversals where people's actions and movements were switched. In the supernatural world, which mirrors the social realm, hand use and body orientation have opposite meanings that actu- ally point out the correct behaviors in human ritual and everyday life. Defeated enemies were depicted as being left-handed because they were believed to be weak, lame, impure, and not as strong and true as the right-handed victors. Undoubtedly, left-handed nobles did exist in ancient Maya society. They may even have been depicted facing to their left, holding objects in their left hands, or associated with the left in the inscriptions. They may also have been seen as unique individuals with direct connections to the reversed supernatural realm. The right side of the body and the right hand com- plemented the left in Classic Maya society, but the right was clearly more important, prestigious, and powerful than the left. The left side of the body and the left hand did not always carry negative connota- tions in comparison to the right, but the left was viewed as being different, often subordinate, yet nec- essary in life and society. The right side can only be defined by the existence of the left, but obvious dis- tinctions are apparent between them. Rank, status, and social differentiation in Maya society had to be mediated and clarified and not simply balanced in harmonious complementary sets. Hierarchical com- plementary, and not just equal polar oppositions, are necessary for making up the totality of social struc- ture and human existence, of which the leftlright division and primacy of the right are prime exam- ples (Turner 1984). As in modern Maya culture, there are possible dualistic symbolic classifications in ancient Maya thought and culture, such as leftlright, female/male, subordinate/superordinate, westleast, impure/pure, etc., but dualisms, dual-organizations, and binary structures cannot be reconstructed at this time (see also Moore 1995). The ancient Maya leftlright principle along with other cultural templates may have guided building construction and site planning (see Ashmore 1989; Schele and Freidel 1990: 10&gt;105). Maya structures and their facades have left/right symmetry (see Schele and Freidel 1990:105-114; 235-241) that was often viewed from left to right (Baudez 2000:139). Also, edifices are placed to the left and right of each other according to the cardinal points, which can be conceived as leftlright orientations of the sun's path (Gossen 1979; Tedlock 1992: 176-178). To speculate further, some important Maya buildings may have been perceived as being to the right or to the left of other edifices depending on their social importance. Leftlright directionality in Maya ritual circuits (see Schele and Freidel 1990:11s111) and enigmatic ritual deposits con- taining predominantly left or right limbs of animals at ancient Maya sites (see Pohl 1985:142) can now be examined in new light. There is additional significance beyond the com- plementary nature, hierarchical opposition, and clas- sification of symbols and behaviors associated with the creation of left and right symbolism. Natural oppositions universal in the world and dualisms cre- ated by humans such as strong/weak, good/bad (see Levi-Strauss 1963; Maybury-Lewis and Almagor 1989; Vogt 1992) come to mind, but these perhaps are of tangential significance when looking at ancient Maya iconography and the body. The main issue is why leftlright distinctions and the preference for the right are of prime importance to the Maya and other peoples. It is argued here that the human body itself with its seemingly symmetrical, yet very different,</page><page sequence="21">Joel W.

People recognize the structure and differences in their own bodies, particularly with handedness and the mirrored left and right halves (see Turner 1984:368). As succinctly summarized by Hunt (1977:95-115), Maya and Mesoamerican social and ritual lives are often symbolized and materialized by metaphors and representations of the human body with its constituent parts and functions. Since humans classify and organize the world they live in, the form and functions of the human body become central models for ritual undertakings, social identity and status, folk classifications, and the organization of the cosmos (see Bourdeau 1977; Classen 1993; Dou- glas 1982; Gillespie 1991; Joyce 2000; LopezAustin 1988). This makes the body, handedness, and left/right differences key and pervasive symbols in social life, ideology, and art in societies across time and space (see also Boas 1955:32, 349-350). The Mural of Hands at Teotihuacan, Mississippian hand- eye motifs, Spanishfiga and milagro hands, Chinese portraits, west African wood figures, and Roman burial stelae, for instance, are likely candidates for . . comparatlve analysls. Accordingly, the human form and physiology pro- vide models for social interaction, status and roles, and for ordering the physical world. People are aware of the complexities and social differentiations in soci- ety, thus left/right symbolism and spatial order help reduce ambiguity, construct meaning, and give struc- ture for social interaction and rituals. It is especially important that the symbolism and beliefs associated with left and right are often transposed onto material culture particularly with iconography involving the body. Careful portrayal of hand use, bodies, and fig- ure orientation are common in art across cultures and their meanings are understood by both the creators and intended viewers. Left/right organization and hierarchy also gives the artist a template for ordering people of varying status and for depicting them in two- dimensional space. Left/right symbolism and asso- ciated iconography is culturally structured, cross-culturally variable, and not a universal product ofthe human mind (see Levi-Strauss 1963:245-266). Left/right semiotics are not merely "good to think" as some structural-dualistic or classificatory studies of human psychology and behavior imply, but are also important for people to experience, see, and record in the material realm as well.</page><page sequence="22">440 Monograph 45, University Museum, University of Penn- sylvania, Philadelphia.

Images on Maya carved and painted ceramics for this study are found in Justin Kerr's internet site http://kawil.saiph.com:9500/dataSpark/maya (also accessed on the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies website www.famsi.org), which contains hundreds of rollout photos (under the heading "ruler, governor, potentate") and The Maya Scribe and His World (Coe 1973). The Maya ceramics can also be viewed in the following publications: Classic Maya Pottery at Dumbarton Oaks (Coe 1975), Lords of the Underworld: Masterpieces of Classic Maya Ceramics (Coe 1978), The Maya Vase Book: Volumes 14 (Kerr 1989-2000), and Painting the Maya Universe: Royal Ceramics of the Classic Period (Reents-Budet 1994). 2. Maya stelae, panels, and lintels used in this study are from Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions: Vols. 14 (Graham, ed. 1975-2000), The Monuments and Inscriptions of Tikal (Jones and Satterthwaite 1982), The Monuments and Inscriptions of Caracol, Belize (Beetz and Satterthwaite 1981), Maya Sculpture of Copan: the Iconography (Baudez 1994), Montgomery's website drawings http://kawil.saiph.com:7100/ dataSpark/montgomery (also at the Foundation for the</page><page sequence="25">Chicago Maya Society) in The Vase Book: Volume 1 (Kerr 1989) (n = 90) and Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions: Vol. 3, Part 2, Yaxchilan (Graham 1979) (n = 19). We agreed on the left/right orientation of the figures and identification of the superordinates and subordinates in every case but one pottery vessel: Kerr File No. 764 (Kerr 1989:45). This vase contains an unusual scene where a male lord gestures to a visiting noble woman to his right and looks to his left at his personal attendant.
