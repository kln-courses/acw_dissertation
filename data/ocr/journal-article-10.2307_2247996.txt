<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-NEW BOOKS. Talks to Teachers on Psychology: and to Students on somne of Life's Ideals. By WILLIAM JAMES. New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1899. IN these talks Mr. Jamnes has deliberately set himself to eliminate so far as possible the formal side of psychology. He is careful to guard his readers from expecting too much froim his science. He does not go the length of saying that the teacher is of necessity an empiric, but he makes it very clear that the whole value of psychological knowledge to the teacher lies in the power of applying general principles to this or that child at a given moment. To be a good teacher is to be a good practical psychologist: but the converse does lnot hold. Under these circum- stances we are not surprised to find nothing new in the psychology of the volume. Those familiar with Mr. James's writings know exactly what to expect, so far as the psychological ground-work is concerned. What gives the volume its value-in addition to the brilliant style in which the author cannot help expressing himself-is the insight it gives into the principles of applying psychology to life in general, and to teaching in particular. It is greatly to his credit that our author makes such restricted use of what he modestly calls the Lange-James theory of the relation between emotion and expression. Readers of his Prin- ciples cannot fail to be struck by the difference of his treatment of this subject in comparison with all the other subjects he handles. Else- where he is the outside critic-sympathetic and interested no doubt, but still outside-here he becomes, for the time being, a pleader. This being so, we cannot too much praise his self-restraint in limiting his use of this theory to a single chapter in a book in which it might have legitimately bulked very largely; for few theories in psychology have anything like the importance that this theory may fairly claim in education. The theory itself has been already examined in these pages, and, while we cannot accept it, we are convinced that there is no intelligent teacher who does not wish he could. Further, while in the ultimate resort the theory must be held to be false, it is supported by so many arguments that as a practical hypothesis it is not without its value in guiding teachers. Fewv, we think, will be found to dispute the practical con- clusions arrived at in the chapter on " The Gospel of Relaxation ". The book is probably hardly dull enough to satisfy teachers on this side of the Atlantic, but they may rest assured that it is accurate so far as it goes, and that it goes a great deal farther than many much duller books. Psychology in the Schoolroom. By T. F. G. DEXTER and A. H. GARLICK. London, New York anid Bombay: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1898. Pp. viii., 413. There is in this book a good deal too imuch of the schoolroom-especi- ally of the schoolroom during examination-and a good deal too little</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 545 psychology. As educators, the authors have something to say; as psychologists, they have simply furnished a compilation of the opinions of Bain, Spencer, Sully, etc., without regard to system or even to uni- formity of terminology. One must not demand everything of a text-book; but one may demand knowledge of the great current issues, and Messrs. Dexter and Garlick appear to be wholly unfamiliar with the work of James, Stumpf and Wundt. The chapters are entitled: Physiology and Psychology; the Three Phases of Mind; Attention; Sensation (organic senses, taste, smell); Perception (senses of sight, touch, hearing); Observation; Development and Training of the Senses; Memory; Imagination ; Conception; Judgment; Reasoning; Apperception; Psychological Basis of the Kindergarten System; Feelings (egoistic, social) and Sentiments (in- tellectual, oesthetic,moral); Will; Habit; Character; Discipline. There are sixty-four figures in the text, most of them well-selected and useful. Every chapter ends with a summary and a list of questions, and an appendix contains specimen examination papers. Indeed, what one may call the mechanical side of the making of the book is excellent. But neither will it help the reader to become a psychologist nor does it furnish the outline of a modern system of psychology. General Physiology: an Outline of the Science of Life. By MAX VER- WORN, a. o. Professor of Physiolooy in the University of Jena. Trans- lated by F. S. LEE, Adjunct Professor of Physiology in Columbia University. With 285 illustrations. London and New York: Mac- millan &amp; Co., 1899. Pp. xvi., 615. Price 16s.; $4. Prof. Verworn's Allgemeine Physiologie (1894, second edition, 1897) is an excellent book in the German, and no less excellent is Prof. Lee's trans- lation. We are glad to call the attention of psychologists to it, and heartily subscribe to the words of the translator's preface: " The work has been welcomed by European and American biologists, who have felt the need of a review and summary of the rapidly accumulating details of -cell-physiology, and its ability and suggestiveness have been widely recognised. Many of the special views of the author have encountered opposition-a fact that, perhaps, is indicative of their value-yet, how- ever much we may agree or disagree with him upon special points, we must all acknowledge his breadth, and be grateful to him for present- ing such a wealth of facts, and for pointing out so clearly the possibilities of research." Prof. Verworn's well-known Psychophysiologische Protis- tenstudien (1889) is a guarantee of his interest in, and familiarity with, fundamental psychophysical problems. The present volume contains a bibliography and a good index. The Principles of Biology. By HERBERT SPENCER. Vol. i., revised and enlarged. London: Williams &amp; Norgate; New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1898. Pp. xii., 706. Price 18s. We are glad to add our voice to the general chorus of congratulation which has greeted the veteran author of the Synthetic Philosophy on the appearance of this second edition of vol. i. of his Principles of Biology. Additions of prime importance have been made to the text of 1864. We find new chapters on Metabolism, on Structure, on the Dynamic Element in Life, on Cell-life and Cell-multiplication, on Genesis, Heredity and Variation, and on Recent Criticisms and Hypotheses. The chapter on the Arguments from Embryology has been for the most part rewritten. 35</page><page sequence="3">546 NEW BOOKS. Two new Appendices contain a summary of the evidence for the In- heritance of Functionally Wrought Modifications, and an essay upon Spontaneous Generation and the Hypothesis of Physiological Units. The most interesting of these additions, to the philosophical reader, will probably be the arguments alleged in favour of 'direct equilibration' and the discussion of the nature of life. Fuller notice is reserved until the publication of the second volume. The Dawn of Reason: Mental Traits in the Lower Animals. By J. WEIR. New York: The Macmillain Co., 1899. Pp. xiii., 234. Price $1.25. Comparative psychologists fall into two classes: the credulous and the sceptical. Dr. Weir, who belongs to the former category, and holds that " intelligent ratiocination performs an important r4le in the drama " of animal life, has brought together in this little volume a mass of data, gained at first and second hand, which had for the most part already seen the light in the form of magazine articles. This fact may account for the unnecessary repetitions of anecdote that disfigure his pages. He believes in the development of mind from reflex action, and in the exist- *ence of an unconscious as well as a conscious mind. The book before us is principally concerned with the conscious mind of insects. Dr. Weir is a good observer, but a poor interpreter. Our old friend, the aesthetic spider, revives under his hands. Adaptation of colour to environment (' tinctumutation') and the homing instinct are referred to 'auxiliary senses'. It is well that, as the Preface states, the author "does not claim infallibility ": for psychos is not the Greek for mind. Defective Eyesight: the Principles of its Relief by Glasses. By D. B. ST. J. ROOSA. London and New York: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1899. Pp. 193. Price 4s. 6d.; $1. This little book is a recasting of the author's The Determination of the Necessity for Wearing Glasses, published in 1888. It is a useful and interesting essay, written by a competent man. The volume shows some signs of hasty preparation, both in arrangement and topography: the dioptric system is presupposed until page 172, there are minor repeti- tions in the early chapters, Salvinus Armatus figures also as Salvino degli Armati, etc.; but these and similar slips can easily be corrected in a second edition. The work deals with the measurement of visual acuity (test types are given in an appendix); defects of accommodation (presbyopia); errors of refraction (myopia, hypermetropia, regular corneal astigmatism); general asthenopia; and the use of spectacles and eye-glasses. A History of Physics in its Elementary Branches: including the Evolution of Physical Laboratories. By F. CAJORI. London and New York: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1899. Pp. viii., 322. Price 6s. 6d.; $1.60. This is a simply writtenf and selective history of physical science, " in- tended mainly for the use of students and teachers of physics," by the author of the Elementary History of M]athematics, which we noticed some time since. While it will doubtless serve the purpose towards which it is primarily directed, it may also be cordially recommended to the general reader, including the student of philosophy and psychology. The treatment is by periods: the Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Europe during</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 547 the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, are taken up in turn. The chief topics discussed are mechanics, electricity and magnetism, heat, sound and light. Magnus and Lord Kelvin seem to be rival claimants for the honour of having established the first physical laboratory. L'Instabilite' Mentale. Essai sur les donnees de la Psycho-Pathologie. Par G. L. DUPRAT, Professeur de Philosophie, Docteur es lettres. Paris: F6lix Alcan, 1899. The aim of this book is to place the main results of recent psycho- pathology in their proper philosophical setting. The book is largely a "criticigm of categories "; but it is, at every page, informed of the con- crete material. It is well-arranged, lucid, and reasoned. The author, starting from the most abstract considerations of space and time and of the ultimate relations of neurosis to biosis, arrives at the inexpugnable unity of consciousness (or rather personality) as the fundamental fact. In passing (c. i., p. 15), he reminds the physiologist that his " plastides " are incapable of self-existence. So are the groups of them that form nerve, muscle, organ, and organism. "Mais n'est-il pas plus aise de comprendre ce systeme quand on se dit que chaque element est un conscience representative d'autrui?" The solidarity of the " plastides " is the harmony of elementary consciousness. A "hierarchy of nerve ,centres " is " dans une theorie purement physiologique radicalement in- comprehensible " (p. 16). Which is to say that we are concerned with a psycho-physical organisation, and perhaps it is well, as here, to drive this home for the edification of the abstract biologist. But the impression one gets from this chapter is that the " unity'" has swallowed up the " di- versity" without the " labour of the notion ". But M. Duprat rapidly passes to more concrete matters. A centre-nervous or mental-is a synthesis of relations. Time-relations are " constitutive du tout sujet," and, therefore, since this implies distinction, opposition, there is, at the basis of the psychical life "une discontinuite fonciere, une instabilite radicale ". But, for apperception of perceptions, duration is necessary. The discontinuity is overcome by the concept of " devenir " (becoming, transition, process, growth, activity, evolution: the term is so common through the book that I offer various renderings). With these first principles, M. Duprat finds the normal to lie-not in the average, or general, but-in the ideal, which is system, or systematisation. The morbid is, by contrast, the asystematic, or rather that which does no- wise achieve system. " The evolution of a mind presents a progress or a regression, and in this progress or regression a rhythm." This evolu- tion is " the gradual passage by suitable increments (intermediaires con- venables) from one state to another more conmplex or less complex ". Psychical states are systematised by the tendency towards an end, a determinate personality, permanent amid changing environment (p. 58). From this standpoint, chap. iii. endeavours to define a psycho-patho- logical fact. The chapter is good and faces fairly the difficulty of marking off diseased activity from normal function. But the net re- sult is not peculiarly convincing. A morbid mental phenomenon would be: "a conscious moment or a series of conscious moments that by the discontinuity of psychical evolution manifests the law of mental instability to the detriment of the systematic growth of a personality" (du devenir systematique d'une personalite) (p. 77). In part ii., M. Duprat introduces us to "les faits psycho-pathologiques." Mental disease due to the destruction of " a group of inferior elements ' (p. 80)</page><page sequence="5">548 NEW BOOKS. is for the biologist and psychologist; but when "la conscience supe- rieure perd d'abord son devenir normal," so 'causing trophic and other troubles, it belongs to the psychologist alone to study "la cause premiere des psychopathies reelles" (p. 81). This distinction, which is frequently referred to, seems to me illegitimate, unless the author means that, hitherto, the only physiological method subtle enough to match the subtlety of the psychical concurrences is, if I may say so, psychological. Taken literally, M. Duprat's distinction would contradict the fundamental assumption of the psycho-physical organism. In this part, there is some valuable discussion on effort (p. 86), character and personality (p. 92). "En realite il n'y a que des maladies de la personnalitd." From this we proceed to the pathology of the mental functions-(a) intellectual instability, including distraction, delirium. dreams, hallucinations, illusions, anatsthesia, amnesia, troubles of judg- mnent and reasoning; (b) instability in tendencies, including certain manias, impulsion, repulsion; (c) emotional instability; (d) instability in actions. M. Duprat combats the necessity for any hypothesis of " double personality". But his positions on this matter, though verbally in strong antagonism to the contentions of the "mental disaggregationists " or " dissociationists," are not, it seems to me, much different in substance. For example, his rejection of mental "'vivisection " (as in suppression of states by hypnotic suggestion) gives the case away when it is admitted (p. 259) that, in certain psycho-pathic conditions, we do discover the " effets. particuliers de l'imagination, des instincts, des diverses tendances, des habitudes, quand rien ne les refrene plus," that is when the (indispensable to the normal state) superior centre is, so to speak, out of office. Many such points arise for argument; but space forbids. The last part-part iii. -focusses results for the ends of education. These chapters contain many useful practical principles. The fundamental distinction that, it seems to me, is not made in the book is the distinction between "unity of consciousness " as an epistemological assumpt and " union of conscious- nesses" as, to borrow from physics, the moving point in psychological kinematics. This brief note does nothing like justice to the amount of careful scholarship that the book contains. W. LESLIE MACKENZIE. Lettres In6dites de John Stuart Mill a' Auguste Comte. Publi6es avec les Re6ponses de Comte et une Introduction. Par L. LigvY-BRUHL, Maitre de Conferences de philosophie h la Faculte des lettres de l'Universite de Paris, Professeur A l'fcole libre des sciences politiques. Paris: Felix Alcan, 1899. Pp. xxxviii., 560. With the full. approval of the representatives of both Comte and Mill, the whole correspondence between' the two philosophers is now published. Comte's letters appeared separately in 1877. They are now reprinted from the original manuscripts. Mill's letters are printed from a copy, of which, however, there is no doubt about the accuracy. All the letters now appear in chronological order. The dates are from 8th November, 1841, to 17th May, 1847. -A useful index of names and subjects is added. M. Ldvy-Bruhl has prefixed to the correspondence an excellent and judicial summary. Mill, he points out, at first gave Comte the impres- sion that he was a disciple. Comte had besides been impressed by the fact that his work had drawn more attention in England than in France. From this he derived the mistaken idea that there was already a defin- itely " positivist " group in England. The correspondence as it proceeded destroyed both these illusions; hisclosing irreconcilable divergences</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS. 549 between Mill and Comte, though Mill was then nearer discipleship than any other Englishman. The " influence " exercised, as M. Levy-Bruhl makes clear, was entirely that of Comte on Mill. Mill was essentially "receptive," and thought that he and Comte might, by discussion, modify each other's " opinions ". Comte had not " opinions," but doctrines that were portions of a system. The question was whether any particular doctrine was logically connected with the rest. This he was prepared to consider, but anything that modified the system as a whole was not a point to be discussed. For him the "positive philosophy" has the character of positive science, and admits of no essential modifications. The divergences that came out most clearly related to the position of psychology in the system of the sciences and to the question about the inequality of the sexes. These, as M. Levy-Bruhl shows, were not unconnected. Comte entirely repudiated the " eighteenth century psy- chology," or, as he called it, " metaphysics ". Mill's adherence to it in principle was decisively shown by his inclination to regard human beings as approximately equal apart from differences of education. Ad- mitting that the position of Helvetius is exaggerated, he yet thinks there is a portion of truth in it which is neglected in Comte's view-derived from Gall-that there are ineradicable differences of faculty determined by the character of the organism. From this divergence the views of the two thinkers about the natural equality or inequality of the sexes are corollaries. In concluding, M. Ldvy-Bruhl draws attention to what is an even niore important theoretical difference, though it was less con- nected with personal sentiment, and hardly comes into full view in the correspondence. Comte's notion that psychology should be treated as a branch of biology is of course not original. His real originality in rela- tion to psychology finds expression in the formula which M. Levy-Bruhl cites, that humanity must not be explained by the individual man, but man by humanity. Thus there can be no science of character, such as Mill's 'ethology,' prior to the study of the historical evolution of human- ity. M. Levy-Bruhl adds that Mill's throwing himself into a work on political economy must have put an end to all hope of agreement. This, however, had not yet presented itself as an irreconcilable difference. Comte, as may be seen in the letters, allowed to political economy a provisional value, and all along remained interested in Mill's treatment of it. As to its necessary subordination to the general science of society, both were at one. The actual agreement, of course, did not extend much beyond this most general position; as no doubt would have become plain if the correspondence had continued till the Political Economy was published. T. WHITTAKER. L'iqnorance et L'Irefiexion. Essai de Psychologie objective. Par L. G13RARD-VARET, Agrege de Philosophie, Docteur es Lettres. Paris: Felix Alcan, 1898. Pp. 296. Under its apparently vague title this is an original and interesting psycho- logical essay. What M. G6rard-Varet means by " ignorance " is the state of mind of the primitive man, who has "1 intelligence," but not the "reflective" consciousness characteristic of high civilisation. The author's method is to work backwards from the idealism which he finds to be implied in modern philosophy, and, having at length reached the twilight of the first human thinking, to return thence to the reflective stage. His first generalisation is that the farther back we go, the more of its own states does the mind attribute to something external. For miodern philosophy all consciousness-however it may afterwards be interpreted-is primarily the product of the subject, or else constitutes</page><page sequence="7">550 NEW BOOKS. it. Go back first to Descartes. For Descartes the idea of the infinite- but that alone--is inexplicable from the subject's own activity or as one of its constituents. Now compare Descartes with Aristotle. Although in detail Aristotle may seem to ascribe more to mental activity than Descartes, yet, according to his general doctrine, reason as a whole, and not simply one of its ideas, comes into man from without. After these preliminaries, M. Gerard-Varet has a study of the doctrine of Plato, especially as regards error. The difficulties with which Plato grapples in the Thextetus are found to be due to his trying to define ' error' as something given, not as a product of the mind itself. The solution, in the Sophist, is that there is a real 'not-being' in things, and that this can be presented to the mind as an object. Going back now to Homer (in the Iliad, as most primitive) we find that the emotions and mental con- ceptions of men and even of gods are almost invariably said to be suggested by some other person, human or divine, or by powers external to the soul. Only in two cases does the poet recognise in the subject the cause of its ideas, viz., in poetic metaphor, where he is conscious of his own creative activity, and in works of imitative art like the shield of Achilles, where the mind of the artificer is conceived as the cause of the production. Can we not find a still more primitive stage, where the products of these activities too are thought to be something objectively given and not made ? Such a stage the auithor thinks can be retraced in the records of more archaic civilisations interpreted according to the modes of thought of modern savages. Myth, before it passes into con- scious poetic art, is simply an imaginative filling-in of the data of sense, and for its niakers has the same value as the representative elements in perception. The forms of imitative art are endowed with a life of their own-statues of gods become actual guardians of a territory-and so are thought of as evoked rather than created by the artist. Reconstructing the modes of conception thus analysed, we find that primitive " ignor- ance " conceives of every representation as objectively given, and at the same 'time as animated and existing for itself. For each thing every imaginable transformation, and every relation with all other things, is possible. There are no suLch conceptions as those of impossibility on the one hand or necessity on the other. In modern metaphysical phrase, every single representation is at once substance, cause and absolute. Experience and reflexion by degrees impose limits on this primitive tendency of mind, and shape out the conceptions of relativity, impos- sibility and necessity. This last conception, by which modern science is characterised, has its origin in mathematics and nowhere else. It is from mathematics, in the deductive form, that the conception of undeviating necessity has extended itself to natural causation. The initiation of mathematical science, in this sense, was the work of the Pythagoreans, entangled though they too were in the illusions of primitive realism. T. WHITTAKER. L'Avenir de la Philosophie. Esquisse d'une Synthese des Connaissances fondee sur l'Histoire. Par HENRI BERR, Ancien eleve de l'Ecole Normale superieure, Professeur de Rhetorique au Lycee Henri IV., Docteur es Lettres. Paris: Hachette, 1899. Pp. x., 511. A fairly correct general description of M. Berr's philosophy would be " positivism plus psychology "; to which it ought perhaps to be added that while the name of metaphysics is suppressed, the thing is retained. The latter part of the description, however, is too little distinctive. It might be applied to so m-uch contemporary thought. The affinity with</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 551 positivism comes out clearly in the briefest statement of general ideas. Positivism itself the author declares to be untenable for want of psycho- logy and criticism of knowledge (p. 231). He adopts, nevertheless, the historical study of thought as the method of attaining truth. The aspira- tion of the thinker must be, not to have the right to say " That is my thought," but " That is what my time has thought in me ". One principle affirmed is the " superposition of kingdoms "-inorganic, organic and "thinking ". The philosophic synthesis must unify the sciences. The practical end also is unity. For the attainment of this unity the State is to suppress itself, making of society a Church. Or rather, as the author proceeds, to avoid old historiccal associations, let us substitute for the name of Church that of " Synthesis ". He can criticise the existing social order keenly, and can express himself pointedly, as in the inci- dental remark: "La vie actuelle est faite de pieces qui ne s'ajustent pas" (p. 19, note). His attitude towards the future he defines as "expectant dogmatism ". The historical synthesis is not yet created, but will be. The guarantee of this is the progressiveness of thought. Materialism and idealism are equally false. The most general position to be laid down is monism, but as a hypothesis. If we say that thought and extension are both phenomlenal, and that there is a reality, knowable in the subject, which constitutes equally the subject and the object, our position has nothing absurd, though it is not yet proved. In this " ex- tension of the being of the ego to the whole," anthropomorphism is legitimate on condition of being purified. " What psychology is to the conception of science, History is to the direction of the Synthesis: and, like anthropomorphism, anthropocentrism is legitimate, on condition of being well understood." The author is faithful to his historical idea in giving, between his outline of the method of seeking truth and his de- tailed exposition of the method of establishing it, an extended review of the evolution of European philosophy in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (pp. 50-291). The conclusion (pp. 449-511) applies tlle result to ethics, and is entitled " The Destination of Man ". Le Role sociale de la Fermnme. Par Madame ANNA LAMPE1RIERE. Paris: Felix Alcan, 1898. Pp. 174. Madame Lamperiere's book is not an elaborate study of the social duty of woman. It is rather in the nature of a criticism of the "feminist" movement in France. According to Madame Lamperiere the " feminist " movement is the result of a false interpretation of the facts of life. The principal characteristic of the woman's movement is its tendency to regard the conditions of life of both sexes as the same. As men and women are both human beings the " feminists " say that they ought in consequence to have the same rights, the same duties, the same liberties, and that they ought to stand on a footing of absolute equality. Madame Lamperiere considers that these ideas are retrograde: she considers that they are condemned by biological and sociological laws: they are the outcome of a superficial liberalism attempting to apply the principles of 1 789 in a blind and unthinking manner. It is true that women should have the same rights as men. These rights may be summed up in the right of woman to secure the full development of all her faculties. A careful examination shows that a woman's faculties are different from a man's. They are equal in importance, superior in some respects, quite as necessary for the harmonious organisation of individual and social life. Nevertheless they are different. A woman's movement which is to be really fruitful should take this fundamental fact into account. It should not waste its</page><page sequence="9">552 NEW BOOKS. energies in attempting to assimilate a woman's life with a man's. This is to attempt the impossible. It should concentrate itself upon the true sphere of feminine activity, it should show what the parental and social duties of women really are. It is by differentiation of duties and not by identity of duties that social progress is effected. Whether we agree with Madame Lamp6riere or not it must be admitted that she has made out a case which deserves consideration. Ueber die Grundvoraussetzungen und Consequenzen der individual- istischen Weltanschauung. Von WINCENTY LUTOSLAWSKI. Helsing- fors, 1898. Pp. 88. Seelenmacht: Abriss einer Zeitgemdssen Weltanschauung. Von WIN- CENTY LUTOSLAWSKi. Leipzig: Engelmann, 1899. Pp. xvi., 301. In these writings the versatile and accomplished author of the Origin and Growth of Plato's Logic sketches the outlines and develops some of the practical consequences of his philosophic Weltanschauung in so lucid and vigorous a manner and in such excellent German that he cannot fail to interest every reader who can get over the shock of sur- prise at finding the inventor of stylometry-a science (or pseudo-science) which is assuredly destined to provide German professors with congenial employment for some centuries to come-capable of such flights of the im- agination. M. Lutoslawski is avowedly an individualist, and as individual- ism happens just now to be unfashionable, it is not very probable that he will get many to agree with him; and indeed some of his conclusions are hardly such that others can be expected to share them, e.g., none but a patriotic Pole could possibly adopt M. Lutoslawski's faith as to the spiritual mission of the Polish people. Nor, to do him justice, does he appear to be much concerned to convince his opponents. He is more concerned to state his own convictions for the benefit of congenial spirits than formally and fully to refute 'universalism'. Nevertheless, he sees and expresses clearly many of the chief difficulties which beset the attempts to construct a monistic philosophy. We may note especially his account of the futility of Lotze's " M " (Grundvoraussetzungen, p. 11-13), of the inconclusiveness of the argument from the commensur- ability of things (loc. cit., p. 23), of the nullity of the conception of infinite power (Seelenmacht, p. 120), and of the impossibility of recon- ciling the existence of evil and freedom with the assumption of a single all-embracing substance, and that of personality with that of infinity (loc. cit., p. 137). In all this he is of course traversing ground which is familiar to all who have ever felt the force of the arguments for pluralism. But such objections to the traditional monism will bear repeating so long as it persists in its-dogmatic somnolence. When it comes to drawing con- clusions from his principles M. Lutoslawski appears more original. For originality in philosophy is largely a matter of courage in working out to their ultimate logical consequences the conclusions implied in a limited number of alternatives, and M. Lutoslawski is certainly abundantly equipped in this respect. Accordingly he ventures to maintain that in the universe of interacting monads (souls) which constitute our world God (or the complex of higher souls) is neither omnipotent, nor omni- scient nor infallible, that all souls are uncreated and immortal, and that, their telepathic interaction is a simple and demonstrable fact, that the totality of existence is capable of augmentation but not of diminution (Grundvoraus., p. 24), that anthropomorphism is inevitable, and that the</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS. 553 true ethical ideal is to be found in the Liberum Veto of the defunct Polish Republic (loc. cit., p. 47). It is obvious that some of these deductions are more original than prudent, while the proof of others hardly seems sufficient. Thus the argument (loc. cit., p. 48) that there must be a God, because there must be some highest being in the universe, hardly seems sound, and indeed no deity of any sort would seem to be really needed in a schenme which doubts the supreme wisdom of Providence. Again, the postulate of unanimity, irrefragable though it be metaphysically, and safe though it nay conceivably be to whisper it in the sanctuaries of the seventh heaven, is hardly one to be rashly applied to the practical exigencies of our terrestrial universe. The practical corollaries which M. Lutoslawski draws from his doctrines may be passed over lightly. They are greatly affected by his personal equation, very visionary and extravagant, and evidently inspired by the political paradoxes of Plato's R?epublie. One is a little surprised to find that a subject of the Tsar should have been permitted to utter them with impunity, but there is not perhaps any great danger of their havin, anv practical effect on any existing society. Still their greater prominence in Seelenmacht, together with the greater length of this work, renders the Grundvoraussetzungen decidedly preferable reading for the student of M. Lutoslawski's philosophy. F. C. S. SCHILLER. Geschichte der neueren Deutschen Philosophie seit Hegil. Eirm, -Hand- buch zur Einfiihrung in das philosophische Studium der neuesten Zeit. Von Dr. Phil. OTTO SIEBERT. G6ttingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht; London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1898. Pp. 496. The description of this work given on the title-page is somewhat mis- leading. Whatever nmay be the value of the work as a book of reference, it is hardly fitted to serve as an introduction to the study of the period with which it deals. In the Preface the author seems to give two rather different explanations of the aim and scope of the work. After speaking of the importance of a study of the past achiev-ements of philosophy, he goes on to say, " Die Geschichte der Pnilosophie will dazu behilflich sein, sie sorgt, dass die Miihe und Arbeit friiherer Geschlechter den lebenden nicht verloren geht, sie will die Meister vor Augen fuihren, damit die Jiinger selbststandig weiterarbeiten". But a little farther on he ex- plains his work as being " eine Bearbeitung der Geschichte der neueren Philosophie seit Hegel, welche moglichst alle irgendwie erwahnenswerten philosophischen Erscheinungen berticksichtigt ". Now these two ac- counts do not seem to agree very well. The " Meister " of the first can hardly be identified with the " irgendwie erwiahnenswerten Erschein- ungen " of the second. And in any case the scope assigned to the work in the second account seems quite inconsistent with the purpose of the work as set forth on the title-page. Certainly it is in the spirit of the second account that the work itself is written. It deals with a very large number of philosophers of all grades of importance (the index of mere names runs to six pages), and to any one philosopher the author devotes as a rule (there are comparatively few ex- ceptions) not more than three pages, very often a page or less. Within this compass he gives an abstract, apparently as nearly as possible in the phraseology of the philosopher himself, of the latter's more important doctrines or works. In many cases it is not easy to see what useful -purpose is served by such a method. Thus in the case of several of the</page><page sequence="11">554 NEW BOOKS. Hegelians, e.g., G. Biedermann, J. E. Erdmann, Michelet, and Rosen- kranz, the abstract becomes a mere string of categories, divisions, and subdivisions, the enumeration of which is as useless as it is tedious. That a more useful method could have been adopted is occasionally evidenced by the author himself. His statement of the points of dif- ference between Schopenhauer and Frauenstadt gives just what is of service. The work is divided into three main sections. An introduction, too brief and conventional to be of much use, and a concluding survey, which is little more than a reiteration of names, may be disregarded. The first main section, extending to rather more than half the book, deals. chiefly with the schools or followers of the masters of the previous period, though it also has chapters dealing with Schopenhauer and Trendelen- burg. Within each school or lesser group the namles follow each other, as a 'rule, in alphabetical order. The arrangement of the second and third main sections is more open to question. The second, entitled "Reaktionserscheinungen," contains chapters dealing with Materialism, Positivism, and " Der Aufschwung der Naturwissenschaften "; the third, entitled " Neue Versuche, " chapters dealing with " Der Neukantianismus " and " Versuche zu neuer Systembildung ". The question of classification is naturally difficult- and disputable, but certain of the author's decisions seem rather arbitrary. The chapter on " Versuche zu neuer System- bildung " is by no means exclusive, since twenty-seven such constructions. are enumerated and summarised. Yet Wundt and Avenarius appear only as " Reaktionserscheinungen," the fQrmer being (very inadequately) dealt with in the chapter on " Der Aufschwung der Naturwissenschaften," the latter in that on Positivism. Paulsen appears somewhat questionably as a Neo-Kantian. Among the new constructions, the philosophies of Lotze and Eucken receive most attention. The account of Eucken, " Der bedeutendste systematische Philosoph der Gegenwart," extends to 15 pages, that of Lotze, covering 12 pages, is taken almost exclusively ,from the "Microcosmus," the early books of which are analysed at length, while the last is dismissed in a paragraph. H. BARKER. La Psicologia Conternporanea. By GUIDO VILLA. Torino: Fratelli Bocca, 1899. Pp. 660. "The time is rapidly approaching "- Dr. Stout's prefatory words to the Analytic Psychology will be remembered-" when no one will think of writing a book on psychology in general, any more than of writing a, book on mathematics in general." If this be so, if the youngest of the independent sciences, still struggling with a leading string or two, be in this respect nearly abreast with the oldest of the sciences, the time is. specially appropriate for the appearance of Prof. Villa's review of what has been written on the more comprehensive lines. Political Economies. "in general" are probably at the same stage. Research is leaving the apprehension of synthetic unity for awhile to grapple with the manifold piecemeal in monograph and Beitraege. And the present author's effort. to give us " a historico-critical introduction to contemporary psychology "' has in that other field the illustrious precedent of the Guida by his. fellow-countryman, Dr. Cossa, now well-known in this country. Prof. Villa, one of Italy's youngest thinkers, advanced in views and withal simpatico, was called last autumn, on the completion of the present work, from the post of teacher of psychology at the Lyceum of Lugano to the corresponding chair at the Lyceum of Leghorn. The</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 556 book is his first work of importance. In it his ostensible purpose is to set out, not so much a complete exposition of the methods and results of contemporary psychology as a statement of "the general principles on which it is based, as well as the ways by which these have evolved from philosophic doctrines and antecedent psychology ". And he confines_ himself, of course, to work done in Germany, England, America and France, trusting, as to his own land, that he may help to stimulate the as yet very tender growth in her of psychological research. The com- pilation has occupied some years of labour, and has taken the following- shape: A brief introduction on the present position of psychology. Seven very lengthy chapters on (i.) the historical development of psychology, (ii.) definition and scope of it, (iii.) body and mind, (iv.) the metbods of psych-ology, (a) in research, (b) in exposition, (v.) psychical functions, (vi.) consciousness, (vii.) the laws of psychology; conclusion, including brief discussionas on theories of " social and historical conscious-- ness " and of the immortality of consciousness, and a general summary. There was much to say; much also is here said. The diction is generally lucid and straightforward, nevertheless the author seems to prefer to more concise methods the rhetorical device of impressing by repetition. To take only one instance, there is scarcely a chapter in which the " intellectualistic " character of English psychology is not set- forth and. discussed. This plan of "rubbing it in" is not without its advantagfles where, as in this case-and in, alas! how many other cases of this class of research-the book is launched on the world without either index or page reference to the details of its contents. One cannot open the book at hazard or study any one chapter without practically sampling what the writer has to say. On the other hand a good deal of needless diffuseness and repetition might have been avoided to good purpose. And 660 pages is a deal to read. The more need then for more subdivision than is afforded by a few chapters of vast length, and for all the machinery possible by which an author may take his reader by the hand and aid him in the gentle art of selection. Even for the Italian reader, unless he be a scholar of leisure (is there now anywhere such a species ?), the digestion of the work is not made as easy as it might have been. Both the investigator and the learner have their special reasons for requiring many sign-posts and mile-stones. How much more orphaned must the foreign student feel, who, with possibly only a smattering of Italian, has gladly hailed the appearance of Prof. Villa's book as supplying a great want unmet as yet, either wholly or in. part, by the psychological literature of his own country ? The work will,, in course of time, if that want continues unsatisfied, find its way into translations, and richly deserves such a fate. Meanwhile, many a reader will have to wait whose acquaintance with Italian might, with the aids I have indicated, have proved adequate to his understanding the contents. That the extent of the book's usefulness should be thus handicapped is, the more to be regretted when the special benefit is considered which accrues to the English and the German student through a "historico- critical " comparison of the two chief traditions of constructive psycho- logy as made by one whose country and language are as yet undominated by any such psychological tradition of its own. They learn to know their own tradition from fhe outside, and to estimate where it is strong- or weak in its standpoint and evolution by holding up to it the lines. worked out in other schools. And the criterion of efficiency in the compilation of such a comparative study must of course lie in the power shown by the compiler to lay hold of the vertebral features of each school of doctrine and trace their development up to the present day- with justice and with sympathy.</page><page sequence="13">.556 NEW BOOKS. On the whole the author has succeeded. The tone is one of apprecia- tion and disinterestedness. Nor is this marred by his preponderant admiration for the great work of Wundt as mnarking the furthest advance in the psychology of to-day. His materials are rich and comprehensive and no branch of modern research is omitted. Nevertheless for all the trees one can see the wood. The specific character of German psychology stamped upon it by the tendencies of German philosophy is indicated in broad lines; the conditions and growth of the psycho-physical movement broadening into a thorough-going experimilental development and the quest of the individual as a psycho-physical unity is fully gone into. The " intellectualism ' shared by both German and English psychology -i.e., psychologising by way of Vorstellungen with a corresponding re- lative neglect of the more intimately subjective activities,-but working in England by associationism, in German by the concept of syntheses, is shown as having been upset in Germany by the influence of Schopen- hauerism, the " volontaristic " tendency paving the way to a truer con- ception of the essential unity of the psychical continuum. In England we are found to be still holding by our intellectualistic psychology, although the great analysis by Dr. Bain of emotion and will is duly appreciated. Full justice however is done to the great work accomplished by English psychologists of extricatina their subject-matter from philo- sophy and of raising it by their experiential methods to the threshold of a science almong the sciences. In our anxiety, however, to set out an analysis of mental phenomena as we find them, the author holds us too descriptive merely, too little explanatory. Is it perhaps the fact that he has not succeeded in obtaining a clear grasp of the real explanatory work done by English " intellectualism " ? Berkeley stripped our philosophy of the independent reality of the external world as knowable. Hume stripped our philosophy of a subject entity as inferable. They left us instead a world of sensations and ideas to analyse and to classify, and the construction therefrom of an intelliglible theory of how we come to ilnterpret them as external world. It is this attempt, continuously handed on, to explain the external world as known-a task to which the doctrine of association is only ancillary-which is the chief output hitherto of British psychology in a progressive line of development from Hobbes, Locke and Berkeley, down to Bain, Sully and Groom Robertson. -And herein may be found wealth enough, not only of descriptive analysis but of explanation as well. Prof. Villa doubtless knows all this tar better than his present critic, but I do not find it clearly set out, nor justice done to the realisation of the importance of explanation as end in British psychology. Yet Berkeley's theory of vision and Brown's theory of muscular sense, as wrought up by English nineteenth century psychology into its theory of external perception, are alone sufficient to vindicate that. school on a charge of mere descriptive analysing. But its modern representatives-do not seek only to explain the externality of the not- self. They are turning from what Berkeley left us to the subjective world without subject left us by Hume. In the works of Drs. Ward and Sully we have the beginnings of an explanation in terms of psychic pro- cess of the growth of the concept of the self. Prof. Villa has gone at some length into the metaphysical hypotheses involved in the essential concepts of psychology, and has given interesting aperpus into such modern speculative developments as neo-materialism, neo-Thomism, neo- vitalism and the like. But what we chiefly seek, in a conspectus of contemporary psychology is a succinct account of how far the latter ha;s gone in explaining, in terms of mental procedure genfetically treated, " the crowd of facts concerning our m-ental life revealed by analysis of ordinary ~experience ".</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS. 557 Of the methods and the gradual stages by which psychological research is making way towards explanatory doctrine the reader will find a com- prehensive account and a quantity of useful bibliography. (A curious omission, by the way, in the historical chapter, is that of Spinoza's analysis of the emotions.) Full justice to the work cannot be done in this brief space. Btut it will prove itself a valuable aid to the student and scarcely less to the historians of psychology. C. A. F. RHYS DAVIDS. RECEIVED also: G. T.
