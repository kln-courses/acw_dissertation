Each country, each school of thinkers, marks it with its own particular stamp. Therefore, while Benedetto Croce in Italy and the earlier German aestheticians turn to its metaphysical side, while in Great Britain, we find with Rus kin mainly ethical cares, in France there is a tendency to emphasize the psychological factors in aesthetics. We are chiefly concerned with the representation of the universe as seen through our own individual minds ; the latter being, when all is said and done, the only representation which we can be quite sure of, after all. Among French philosophers we can only trace M. Jules de Gaultier who condescended to clothe aesthetics in the dignified garb of metaphysics.1 Unlike, however, Benedetto Croce, who assigns to the aesthetic activity the first momentum historically in human unnatural to find it 1 Jules de Gaultier : La sensibilit? m?taphysique. Editions du Si?cle, Paris, 1925.</page><page sequence="2">4 6 THE MONIST thinking and the lowest among disinterested activities in the scale of metaphysical values, Jules de Gaultier con siders that the aesthetic activity is, on the contrary, the most developed in the evolution of the mind which ascends from the primitive Messianic point of view to the spectacu lar point of view. The "sensibilit? messianique" is the one which contemplates the universe with the aim of changing it. All tendency to progress whether it be religious or moral perfection or be it the Bergsonian ((?lan vital" all search for an external or future end belong to the hope of a Messiah. The "sensibilit? spectaculaire" contemplates the universe for the sole pleasure of contemplating it. This theory which was first obscurely expressed in a dif ferent way by Nietzsche was not followed out to its con clusion by the German philosopher. Nietzsche forgets the as representation in his enthusiasm for the world as action, and he falls back into the "Messianic fallacy" by expecting (in precisely the same way as do the moral think ers whom he criticizes) some immoral Messiah who will perfect the world in beauty. M. Jules de Gaultier, who is more Nietzschean than Nietzsche (I mean the earlier Nietzsche of the "Origins of Greek Tragedy") and who is logical, works out his thesis in the following manner : The first symptoms of a "sensi bilit? spectaculaire" manifest themselves in biology with the change of sensation into perception. This "sensibilit? spectaculaire" plays an important, though often uncon scious part in human life in the form of curiosity, and at tains its perfection in aesthetic activity. Science is far from being disinterested. Quoting Hobbes': "Knowledge is power" and Comte's: "Every science aims at foresight," Jules de Gaultier concludes that the desire to know is a form of the will to power. Science belongs therefore, at first, to the "sensibilit? messianique " searching, as it does, the final end outside itself; i. e., an end where, owing to</page><page sequence="3">AESTHETICS 407 some universal convergence, all phenomena would merge into an identity, whether this identity be the Eleatic One, the Platonic a a , or the Hegelian Absolute. Science has failed in this enterprise, because of the resistance of the Real. It appears, then, that modifying its primitive conception of identity, according to which science consid ered itself as a means of reducing the diverse to unity, it has later used this conception as a means of uniting be tween themselves the different forms of diversity and of creating out of these forms perceptible objects. After an infinite development, these objects have become no longer degrees towards the attainment of an end, i. e., Bradleyan degrees o? reality, but objects the contemplation of which constitutes an end in itself. Existence, according to M. de Gaultier, is conditioned by knowledge, but knowledge itself is conditioned by rela tion. Relation must needs exclude all finalism, in which it would be abolished. This argument brings Jules de Gaultier to the position, somewhat paradoxical at first sight, that in the sphere of relation, which is also that of the whole of reality, there is no place for truth. For nothing is true, except when considered from an objective and sole end. Truth presupposes Messianism and belongs to the sphere of philosophical folklore. It must therefore in the sphere of relation give its place to Beauty. Knowledge which is the condition of existence is also its sole justifica tion. It appears, finally, that in the evolution of the dif ferent forms of the "sensibilit? messianique" towards the forms of the "sensibilit? spectaculaire" existence frees it self from dependence upon truth and becomes subservient to the hegemony of the beautiful, which alone mirrors the real. M. Jules de Gaultier is the first philosopher since Kant and after Croce to give to aesthetics its metaphysical im port, but unlike the two former thinkers, he allots to this</page><page sequence="4">4 8 THE MONIST science the chief place, and his conclusion reduces practi cally the whole of the theory of knowledge to an aesthetic activity. Among those?and they are very few in France?who have approached aesthetics from a moral point of view, we must mention M. Lalo.2 After a very exhaustive and criti cal survey of the different solutions of the problem, and an impartial statement of its historical side, M. Lalo points out the impossibility of adopting an absolute scale of val ues. He admits, however, a differentiation between the "normal value" (i. e., the moral principles of the man-in the-street) and the "ideal value" or the morality which it is not always desirable to realize. In all questions of value, it is the "normal value" which remains fundamental and is the only one capable of being objectified. The ideal value is its hypothetical transposition and can be more or less verified by time, space and humanity. M. Lalo argues further that that which is morally bad in itself may be mor ally good on the whole, and he enforces his attitude by Aristotle's cathartic theory of art. An immoral work of art may be finally moral by the very fact of its immorality, i. e., of the purgation of undesirable passions; which, of course, ?ands the whole problem in a kind of universal relativism. It is difficult, says M. Lalo, to conciliate the beautiful and the good in one indivisible unity; this would be too sim ple and too abstract for life. It is also difficult to maintain them in a badly regulated duality, which is anarchical. Their harmony must be solidarity and organization. He therefore seeks the answer to the problem in the double notion of synthesis and relativity. Wherever there is syn thesis, the whole acquires a value which its elements do not possess. If the whole reacts on its parts or vice versa ?as would a cell in an organism?these two values clash, 2 Lalo : L'art et la morale, Alean, Paris, 1922.</page><page sequence="5">AESTHETICS 409 though the one cannot exist without the other, and though they form a whole. The only sin in spirit, in M. Lalo's eyes, is that of being incomplete. Though M. Lalo insists, so it seems to us, too much on the social side of art,3 he remains well in the vein of French thought. Even in l'Art et la Morale, and especially more so in his other works on aesthetics,4 he approaches aesthetic questions chiefly from a psychologist's point of view. He discerns five main classes among the functions of art in life : Firstly, an escape from practical reality (Type Flau bert). Secondly, a cathartic activity of immunization?by lib eration?against the tension of external and tyrannical aspiration (Type Goethe). Thirdly, a purely technical activity whch leads to the theory of "art for art's sake" (Type Goncourt, Th?ophile Gautier, Oscar Wilde). Fourthly, an activity of embellishment of a vulgar real ity and of the author's own vulgarity (Type Jean-Jacques Rousseau). Fifthly, a more humble activity of reinforcement of sim ple reality (Type Stendhal, Van Dyck, Mozart). This classification, though very ingenious, appears to us, nevertheless, somewhat arbitrary and often overlapping. For instance, there is much more in Oscar Wilde than a purely technical activity, and Van Dyck seems to have been far more refined in his art than in his private mode of living. M. Lalo's two treatises on aesthetics, already men tioned, contain an exhaustive and impartial survey of the different problems for a beginner. Of the same type but of a more ambitious character is the treatise by M. Alain.5 3 Lalo : L'art et la vie sociale. * Notions d'esth?tique, Alean, Paris, 1925 ; Esth?tique, Vuibert, Paris, 1925. 5 Syst?me des eaux-Art s, Nouvelle Revue Fran?aise, 1920.</page><page sequence="6">THE MONIST Though it imparts nothing entirely new, we find therein a systematized review of technical theories of art. The history of French aesthetics has been set forth in a satis factory way by M. Mustoxidi.6 The psychological field is far from being exhausted Among the most interesting publications is, no doubt, the chapter by M. H. Delacroix on Le Sentiment Esth?tique.1 He examines the doctrine that play is the origin of all art. Though he does not deny the analogy between these two ac tivities, he argues that the new factor which the aesthetic activity adds to the faculty of play, it might as well add to a more serious faculty. He defines the work of art as a pro found psychological moment in life. At the beginning of every aesthetic sentiment there is a sensorial element, but the task ol intellectualizing the imagination and the dream is none the less important. Not unlike the former thinkers whose theories we have stated, M. Delacroix holds that the aesthetic activity is that faculty which discovers new relations between us and the sensations and among the dif ferent sensations, as independent of the particular quality of the sensations themselves. There is therefore at the basis of all the arts an intellectual activity which is the same as that which leads to the constitution of language. The aesthetic sentiments, though individual, bear, ac cording to M. Delacroix, a character of universality. In the pure emotions the artist detects the structure and the plan of evolution. These sentiments are the most delicate and the most profound reaction of the soul towards the universe. He claims, therefore, that all human interests are represented in art. But he thinks that the same aim is achieved by the contemplation of nature as by a work of art. Such is also the opinion of M. A. Dauzat.8 After hav ?

Alean, Paris, 1914.</page><page sequence="7">AESTHETICS 4II ing analyzed the impressions which the contemplation of nature produces in certain individuals, he proceeds to ex amine the influence of surroundings on works of art. He concludes, however, with M. Paulhan,9 that it is mostly when love of nature has been denied its free outlet, that it reveals itself, as it is always a repressed tendency which creates the artistic attitude. This brings us to a very modern part of the literature on the subject. It is not surprising to find that the Freudian doctrine has influenced in many ways contemporary aes thetic theories in France as much as?or perhaps a little less than?in other countries. Even M. Lalo seems to tend in this direction in his more recent books. We have not found, however, in this Freudian aspect of the aesthetic activity anything new which was not already stated in the old Aristotelian theory of the purgation of passions. Doctor Hesnard10 argues that a work arises in the mind of the artist through an unconscious process which can be compared with that of the dream. The artist puts in his work many tendencies of which he finds an ideal realization or liberation. He searches for the sublime means of ex pressing all his aspirations. Psychoanalysis will discover in his work all the intimate sentiments of the author with the whole of his affective history and the whole of his per sonal life, including his reminiscences of childhood and youth. Charles Baudouin11 gives us many examples to illustrate the Freudian doctrine of art. Every state which engrosses the mind tends in one way or another to secure external expression, for it is a concentrated energy which wishes to diffuse itself. He goes on, showing how, for Victor Hugo, for instance, hallucination by compromise, which in his case is the source of symbolical poetry, is the normal 9 L'Esth?tique du paysage, 1912. 10 L'Inconscient. 11 Suggestion et Auto-Suggestion.</page><page sequence="8">412 THE MONIST method of discharge ; and how Goethe by writing Werther freed himself from a suicidal impulse. On the pathological side of the subject we must mention Doctor Vinchon's L'art et la folie (Stock, Par?s, 1924), and an earlier book by Marcel R?ja, L'art chez les fous (Mercure de France, 1914). Though the examples they give of art (literature, painting, music) as created by in mates of an asylum are interesting in themselves, they throw but little light on the main problems. Marcel R?ja, basing himself on the examples in his book, concludes that art seems to be the manifestation of the obscure conscious ness of the individual. It expresses, with the satisfaction which every activity finds in its own expression, the actual state of mental acquisition. The work of art is a kind of concrete scheme in which the individual takes pleasure in synthesizing acquired notions without having recourse to the logical and rational process of abstraction. If anything, the poems and pictures created by lunatics and systematically collected by Marcel R?ja would go to prove the theory of the French aestheticians, as against Benedetto Croce, that a real work of art is constituted of intellectual elements as well as sensual. Our review would be incomplete if we did not say a few words of the artists who have written about their own activities Their theories may not be philosophical, but as a confession they throw some light on the subject. They are important in a country like France, where new liter ary schools are created every year, new manifestos writ ten, new poetical programmes proclaimed, and where artis tic life is bubbling over with new fashions. Among the earlier writers, a curious theory of "euryth mie harmonization" of the individual with conflicting causes, has been put forward by R?my de Gourmont.12 Though it remains in the tradition of the Aristotelian 12 Le probl?me du style, Mercure de France ; Esth?tique de la langue fran ?aise, Mercure de France.</page><page sequence="9">AESTHETICS a a and the Freudian "libido," R?my de Gourmont's theory is more subtle, as it is based on a hedonic search for "attunement" with the surroundings and the universe and the desire for immortality, which is reminiscent of the Pla tonic doctrine in the Banquet. This theory has been fol lowed to its logical conclusion by the author's brother, Jean de Gourmont, who tells us a very illuminating anec dote on the subject: "I once suggested to R?my," he writes, "the possibility of a fire in his library. He answered that he would rather die than see his notes and manuscripts disappear. Transposition of the instinct of generation, per haps. But in this there is especially the human conception of the idea of eternity. This realization of oneself in a work of art which will last longer than one's life, is, in fact, the negation of religious faith and its transposition into an in dividual eternity."13 The desire for immortality as a factor in creative work is also emphasized in M. Paul Val?ry 's Eupalinos, an imita tion of a Platonic dialogue, which takes place in the under world between the ghost of Socrates and that of Phaedrus.14 "Nothing beautiful," says M. Paul Val?ry through Socra tes' mouth, "can be separate from life, and life is that which dies." It is most ironical and somewhat pathetic to hear two immaterial ghosts discussing the necessity for mate rial bodies and forms as these alone can radiate and per ceive beauty. For there exist no details in the execution of a work. The reality of a discourse, according to Paul Val?ry, lies more in that which appears accidental to the profane, i. e., in the coloring and in the tone of a voice, in the way things are expressed rather than in the things expressed. Here again we see that the sphere of relations is of paramount importance for aesthetic perceptions. The crux, however, of M. Val?ry's theory is in its aesthe 13 Jean de Gourmont : Souvenirs sur R?my, Champion, Paris, 1924. 14 Paul Val?ry : Eupaiinos ou VArchitecte, Nouvelle Revue Fran?aise, Paris, 1923.</page><page sequence="10">414 THE MONIST tic formulation, too often overlooked by those who ap proach the question as metaphysicians and psychologists. Paul Val?ry insists that art is mainly choice?a fact often forgotten?and that as such it is tyrannical. Real beauty, he says, is as rare as is, among men, the man capable of making an effort against himself, i. e., to chose a defi nite self and to impose it upon all his other selves. It is urgent that that which shall be should satisfy, with all the force of its novelty, the reasonable requirements of that zvhich was. After a somewhat arbitrary distinction between natural and artificial objects?arbitrary, because M. Val?ry, bas ing it as he does on two different kinds of order, forgets that order is altogether an anthropomorphic conception? Paul Valery's theory of choice (among the infinite subject matters for aesthetic creation) culminates in the following argument : If the universe is the effect of an act, and the act itself the effect of a Being and of a need, of a thought, of a sci ence and of a power of that Being, it is by an act alone that one can join again the great aim and propose to one self the imitation of him who has made all things. This is the most natural way of putting oneself in the very place of God. And out of all acts the most complete is that of constructing. A work demands love, meditation, obedi ence to one's most beautiful thought, invention of laws by one's soul. It arises from the most intimate part of one's life, and yet it is not identical with oneself. One would be to that work?if it could but think?a God. Just as God created out of chaos, the artist creates out of the chaotic elements which surround him, and he starts where God has stopped. Thus, by putting aesthetics at the highest summit of spiritual evolution, Paul Val?ry comes, though by differ ent means, in a totally different manner, and on an alto</page><page sequence="11">AESTHETICS 4*5 gether different plan, to a conclusion which has several points of analogy with that of Jules de Gaultier. Among the ultra-modern manifestos on art, we must quote Marinetti's cry of battle: "An automobile in full speed is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace or the Venus de Milo." Exaggerated as it may seem, it never theless marks a new aesthetic interest. Until now, all civili zations have centered around two main ideas : the infinite, in the East, based perhaps on the contemplation of the desert, which brought forth mystical ecstasy, monotheistic religions, pantheistic thinking and a general disorder in creative work, where, as can be seen in Hindu temples, the mass, reminiscent of infinity, is overadorned and over dressed with rich details ; the finite, in the West, based on the contemplation of trees which suggest individuality, human gods and beautiful forms. But whether oriental or occidental, the aesthetic ideal has always been an ideal of repose, of immobility. "Est-elle en marbre ou non, la V?nus de Milo? Je hais le mouvement qui d?place les lignes." Such was the credo of beauty of a former French poet. Now the futurists have introduced for the first time the idea of movement as a subject-matter for aesthetic contem plation, and this opens up new vistas of possibilities. Following closely in the steps of the futurists are the sur realists, chiefly represented by Philippe Soupault, Joseph Delteil and Robert Desnos. Their ideals also are speed and shortness, with special stress laid upon impulsive ex pression. No masterpiece, nothing of great artistic value has so far been created in any of these modern schools.15 This, of course, is not a fair criticism, for (as is witnessed in the 15 We must except M. Marinctti's works. However, his better writings like Le Roi Bombance, Poup?es ?lectriques, etc., have not been written accord ing to futurist canons.</page><page sequence="12">4i6 the monist history of art) hardly any masterpiece has ever been achieved by the same minds who have invented a new aes thetic language. The sonata form was known a century before Beethoven and Mozart brought this musical lan guage to perfection. It seems as if the whole creative power is exhausted by the invention. However, for better or for worse, the futurists and the surrealists are children of that century of speed where conditions of life leave little time for contemplation. The value of their aesthetic ideal can be determined alone by time. Maryse Choisy.</page></plain_text>
