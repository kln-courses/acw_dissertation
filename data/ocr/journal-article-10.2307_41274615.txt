In this article, the results of two survey studies are presented1. More than 42% of the Polish population feels that it has been wronged by the past. The analysis showed that three models of feeling wronged occur, differing in terms of what is perceived to be the cause: (1) the old, communist social order, (2) the new social order and (3) everything, whatever one can think of. The feeling of being wronged is above all determined by subjective feelings of luck in material terms, of education and of age. The consequences of feeling wronged include: a weakened atmosphere, a negative image of the social world, and the tendency to think of this world in moral categories. Introduction In research conducted in 1992 on a representative sample of the adult popula- tion in Poland, J. Czapinski (1993) claimed that only 23% of the respondents agree with the statement that "in Poland it is fitting to speak openly of one's happiness," whereas 51% agree with the statement that, "Poles like to com- plain for no reason." Common observation also suggests an unusually intense feeling of being wronged among Poles today. This is certainly a result of both historical tradition ("Poland, the Christ of nations"), and the difficulties in adapting to systemic changes which a significant part of the Polish population is experiencing, blaming external factors for their misfortune in accord with the defensive model of attribution (Nisbett and Ross 1980). Common obser- vation also suggests that many day-to-day conversations in Poland are based on vying for the gravity and painfulness of the wrongdoings incurred, as if they were the greatest source of pride. In many countries this would be considered proof of insanity. The average Briton (who tend to hide their emotions), or American (who are obliged to be enthusiastic on all occasions) 1 The research for sample 1 was carried out by CBOS (Social Opinion Research Center) funded by KBN (State Committee for Scientific Research) project no. 098/P1/92/03 directed by J.

Wojciszke.</page><page sequence="2">176 TREND REPORT would listen to this with disbelief. Of course, if he or she were able to under- stand what we were talking about, given that in English there is simply no word for what we call "krzywda" (here referred to as wronged or having been wronged) in Polish. In Polish language the expression used is: "ktos mi wyrz^dzil krzywd?", which means, someone did something bad to me, even though I didn't deserve it. And in this sense, an injustice has occurred. There- fore, the feeling of "krzywda" is a negative emotion, combined with the conviction that the norms of justice and honesty have been violated. To express this feeling, throughout the remainder of this paper we will variably be using one of the following terms: being wronged, having been wrongly done by, the feeling of having been wronged, etc. The problem here, however, is whether this is all true, if we really consider ourselves to be victims of one or another wrongdoing, or is it simply a false auto-stereotype of a Pole? In the aim of exploring this problem, in two studies conducted on repre- sentative samples of the Polish adult population we asked a breadth of ques- tions concerning feelings of being wronged. One of the aims of this research was to estimate the intensity of the feeling of being wronged among Poles, to analyze its distribution in the Polish social structure and to explore the models of how it is experienced. Furthermore, we were also interested in the problem of the determinants and the consequences of feelings of being wronged. In reference to the causes of feelings of being wronged, we predicted that the perception of one self as a person who has been wronged could be favored primarily by a degree of frustration of needs, measured in our research by total earnings and the degree of subjective satisfaction with them. We left the issue of whether the stronger determinant of feelings of being wronged are real earnings, or subjective satisfaction with them, to be solved empirically. The other anticipated determinant of feelings of being wronged was relative depri- vation, that is, the conviction that one's own material situation is worse than that of others. Finally, because the feeling of being wronged could be con- sidered an indication of the search externally for those who are to blame for one's own dissatisfying situation, and in connection with this, denying respon- sibility for one's fate, we predicted that the feeling of being wronged would be favored by a low level of education, both one's own and one's parents. Accordingly, a higher level of education should favor the perception of per- sonal responsibility for personal fate, and in a similar manner it could also be influenced by family upbringing, in which the head of the household is char- acterized by a relatively higher education. In reference to the consequences of feelings of being wronged, we antici- pated that this feeling would be conducive to decreasing satisfaction with life and depression, as well as the phenomenon of "lost paradise" (the conviction that one's life was better in the past than the present), and pessimism (the conviction that one's future life will be worse than the present). A further, obvious consequence of feelings of being wronged is a negative image of the social world, above all, of other people. People who have been wrongly done by - searching for those guilty for their having been wronged - should be characterized by more negative convictions about other people than people who have not be wronged. Thus, in perceiving the world as more full of wrongdoings, they should also to a lesser extent identify with their fatherland as a place which they consider to be "really their own" country.</page><page sequence="3">TREND REPORT 177 A further and somewhat less obvious consequence of the feeling of being wronged should be a greater tendency among the "wronged" to (over)use moral categories to understand the social world. For the concept of "wrong- doing" clearly contains a moral implication. A wrongly done by person is someone who not only has bad experiences, but the bad is unjust and immoral (it is not only physical harm, as in the common English under- standing of the term "harm"). Because the wrongdoer is external, this implies his or her immorality, and in order to identify them, it is necessary that the wronged person be especially sensitive to the morality of others, and tend to consider the moral dimension to be particularly important in under- standing the social world. The final consequence of feelings of being wronged anticipated by us is the denial of influence, and consequently responsibility, on what is going on in the life of a wronged person, as well as the fate of his or her close (for ex., the town in which they live) and distant (one's country) surroundings. We believe that a person with a feeling of having been wronged feels as if his or her input into how the world turns, and even in his or her own family, has been completed: in the form of suffering. A wrongly done by person appears, therefore, to believe that: "given I've already contributed so much, meaning I have suffered, I am free of controlling that which happens next - now it's someone else's turn." We anticipate, therefore, that wrongly done by people will attribute themselves with less influence on the fate of the family, town and country than people who have not been wrongly done by. The inspiration for the first of the studies conducted was, partially, the hypothesis that the poor psychological condition of Poles, dissatisfaction with life and depression, apa- thy in private and public life, is derived from helplessness and a lack of a feeling of control over personal fate and public affairs (Grzelak, 1993). This is also why the questionnaire used in sample 1 contained many questions concerning control, attitudes and various forms of activeness in life, attitudes toward public goods, and availing oneself of them. The Research Sample and Indicators of Feelings of Being Wronged The results presented are derived from research on two representative samples of the Polish adult population. The first of them consisted of 1,655 persons between the ages of 16 and 70 and was conducted by CBOS (Social Opinion Research Center) in February of 1994. This was a random sample based on household addresses. The second sample consisted of 1,050 persons and was conducted by the Sopot Pracownia Badan Spolecznych (Sopot Social Research Center) in November of 1994. Sample 2 was a random-quota sample and its selection made according to the results of a two-phase selection of the Polish population: the first stratum resulted from dividing Poland into nine relatively homogenous micro-regions in terms of economic geogra- phy parameters; the second stratum resulted from the degree of urbanization: from villages to cities of more than 200,000 residents. From each of the thus divided second stratum and proportional to their size, a number of administrative units (cities or counties) was randomly selected. In each unit, cluster sampling was applied, the results from which the interviewers</page><page sequence="4">178 TREND REPORT received a list of addresses (street and village) where they were to survey the established number of persons of the indicated sex, age and level of education. In sample 1, the nominal (categorical) measurement of feeling of being wronged was the response to the question: Did you ever have the feeling , while living in Poland , that you were personally wronged? (response options: yes or no). The people who responded positively were given an additional open question: Because of whom ? The responses to the questions were coded into 52 categories of answers. In sample 2, the measurement of feelings of having been wronged was quotient in character: it was a number of answers to questions about 15 con- crete "wrongdoers" (listed in table 1). The question was: Do you feel per- sonally wronged by ,... (here appeared a list of 15 potential "wrongdoers," beginning with supervisors at work, and ending with the new socio-political order in Poland after 1989 ; there were two possible answers in each case: yes or no). The potential scope of this indicator, therefore, was from 0 to 15. In both samples, a substantial number of additional variables was meas- ured. In order to avoid burdening this text with a large number of technical details, we will mention the indicators of these variables during the presenta- tion of the results. For they are often well known indices and are often used in studies such as the BDI depression scale or the Cantrila 11 -grade ladder of happiness (1965) measuring general satisfaction with life, where the respon- dent locates their present life between 10 - indicating the best life imaginable, and 0 - indicating "the worst life." In sample 2, the respondents were also asked about their opinion more than 5 years ago and to evaluate the life expected in 5 years, and the life of the average Pole. The difference between past and present life was the "lost paradise" indicator, the difference between future and present life - the optimism indicator, and the difference between the life of the average Pole and one's own - the relative deprivation indicator. Hence, all of these indicators could vacillate between -10 and 10. In this sample we measured both the feeling of the influence of the respondents on how well off their family was, on how it is in their place of residence and on how it is in Poland as a whole. In each of the three questions the respon- dents were asked to distribute 100% of the influence between five difference sources, including the president, the Polish government, and "myself' (or, "the average person, like myself" in the case of place of residence or all of Poland). In the following text we will analyze the distribution of the "percen- tages of influence" ascribed to these three sources. The Intensity of Feelings of Being Wronged and Models of Experience In sample 1, in response to the question about feelings of being wronged, 42% of the respondents answered positively, and 58% negatively. Given that the responses to the question of who was the wrongdoer were distributed across 52 detailed categories, we grouped these into 5 categories for the sake of analysis: central authorities (government, president, ministers, parliament, etc.), local administration (city/county administrators, housing administra- tion), employers (including supervisors), abstract factors (fate, the system, systemic change) and other. Of the five categories, the central authorities were</page><page sequence="5">TREND REPORT 179 mentioned most often (15% of the entire sample). The remaining four groups received 7% each of the researched sample. In sample 1 as well, a condensed, seven-question version of the Marlowe- -Crowne Social Approval Scale was used, which indicated the absence of differences between those persons who were wronged, and those who were not. This is important to note because one of the interpretive hypotheses put forth is that acknowledgment of a feeling of being wronged is a sign of conformism (adapting to the presently dominant norm of complaining in Poland). The lack of difference in the intensity of the need for social approval weakened the probability of such an interpretation of differences between wronged people and those not wronged.

The Cramer V coefficient was calculated for all of the groups. The differences between the groups for the total number of wrongdoings was significant, though not large. F (6.1012) = 4.50. p&lt; 0.001. eta = 0.16. In sample 2, 0 (16% of the respondents) to 13 (0.2% of the respondents) "wrongdoers" were indicated and the distribution of the number of indicated wrongdoers was close to the normal with an average of 3.53, with a standard deviation of 2.65. As table 1 illustrates, in this sample as well, "central" wrongdoers (government, president) dominated rather than "local ones," known to the respondents through direct contact (husband/wife, parents), which were generally least frequently indicated as the source of a feelings of being wronged.</page><page sequence="6">180 TREND REPORT A factor significantly differentiating the frequency of experiencing a feeling of being wronged appeared to be occupational status. In sample 1 we found that a significantly larger number of unemployed persons acknowledged a feeling of being wronged (50.6%), than the remaining people from the sample (39.0%), G(2(l) = 7.58, p&lt;0.01. On the one hand, the claim could be made that unemployed persons are in a particularly unfavorable life situation and the external attribution of misfortunes (subjectively felt as being wronged) is in their case especially well founded. On the other hand, one could also think that persons who are wronged are people who, generally more than others, are inclined toward external attribution, carrying subjectively less re- sponsibility for their fate and attempting to influence it to a lesser extent. This line of interpretation is in accord with the results presented subsequently concerning feelings of control. In sample 2 occupational status differentiated the frequency of the indica- tion of some sources of feelings of being wronged, as illustrated in table 1. Those, for example, who are getting wealthy now generally occupy a very high, second position on the list of "wrongdoers," although they occupy the first position among farmers who, a considerable majority of, feel wronged by them (whereas private enterprise employees feel less wronged than others by the nouveau riche). Similarly - though on an incomparably lower absolute level - is the model of experiencing a feeling of being wronged in relation to "Solidarity," although next to farmers, the unemployed also often feel wronged by it. It is important to note that 10.5% more respondents feel wronged by the new socio-political order than by the old (pre and post- 1989). This is one more indication of the "lost paradise" phenomenon (Czapinski, 1992), the difference in intensity of which is illustrated in table 2. The former socio- -political order is fairly uniformly idealized in comparison with the present order, and in none of the socio-occupational groups is it indicated by the majority as a source of being wronged. The case is different concerning the new, present order - certain groups significantly differ in the frequency with which they consider it to be the source of being wronged and farmers and the unemployed feel this way in the majority. Independent of the occupational divisions, sample 2 appeared to be more strongly differentiated in terms of the model, or the profile of experiencing being wronged, which we explored with the aid of the quick cluster technique. The most interesting appeared to be the four-cluster solution, the results of which are presented in figure 1. The first and most numerous respondent group (38% of the sample) are those who are not wronged, who basically do not feel they have been wronged by anyone (the average number of sources of wrongdoing is only 1.01 - see table 2), with the small exception of "those who are getting wealthy now." This group is the youngest of those distinguished, well educated, with average earnings and relatively the least dissatisfied with their incomes, which is also expressed through relatively modest financial aspirations (see table 2). In this group the majority on non-workers respondents are located (53%) and relatively a lot of people employed in private enterprises (42%), whereas not many unemployed (29%). This group is the most satisfied with their present life and the most optimistic (the strongest belief that their life in five years will</page><page sequence="7">TREND REPORT 181 1 "■ M ^ ^ ^ ^ - - - - Group 1 - 38% ? 0.8- ^ A Group 2 -18% ^ "/ ' '/ ' a Group 3 -33% £ '• '' A ' /' a Group4-ll% ° °-6-" ' % 0 I / ' ' (O % 0 I ' ' » (O § ' / ' ' » v 1 0.4 -- '■ •• /'■ ' ,A ' 3 ' v ' " X a ' / "--V ^ 3 °'2" '_.y o - i - - i - i ~~r*'i - i - i - i - -r- &gt;■«*? - » S 2e$ CTioo®&lt;fli2 ^ W (O W -4 ^ 2e$ CTioo®&lt;fli2 W (O W u -4 ^ bO &gt;-» +j H W cd M 0' 0 H O x3 3 03 •I bO i &gt;-» +j s g H s W I cd M - 0' s | 0 | H § -g O | x3 8.1 3 i 03 S 5 O 2 3 g S o» m £ V 2 o m 3 o o 5 u £ i? kI £ Fig. 1.

Age and education were measured in years, whereas earnings and desired earning increase were measured in millions of zotys, satisfaction with earnings - on a scale of 1 (very unsatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied: 3 was the neutral category, "neither satisfied nor dissatisfied").</page><page sequence="8">182 TREND REPORT (a negative indication of relative deprivation). They believe in their own ca- pacity to influence what is going on in their family life, their place of residence and their country, more so than other groups, but less influence - than in other groups - is attributed to the president here. This produces the strongest identification of this group with the present Poland (the conviction that "the present Poland is now really my own country"). Finally, this group is charac- terized by the lowest tendency to moralize social conflicts, that is, the absence of the conviction that in conflictive issues such as abortion, decommunisation or privatization, one of the sides of the conflict is represented by people morally better than the other side. The following groups feel uniformly modestly wronged (4.21 and 4.45 sources of being wronged), although for entirely different reasons. One of these groups (18% of the sample) are those wronged, by the past. Almost all feel they were wronged by the old order, and the majority - by Russians, a large part also by Germans, the present government, administra- tion/administrators and the nouveau riche. Only a small part of this group feels it has been wronged by the new order, although almost no one by either "Solidarity" or president Walfsa. This group is the best educated, has the highest income, is of a fairly advanced age - a relatively large number of retirees are in this group (22%), and very few farmers (9%). Hence, within this group are people who could be described as "disappointed wartime Polish patriot fighters" (partially in the generation sense, partially in the sense of mentality), who prefer the new order to the old, although the former has clearly not fulfilled their hopes. As the data from table 2 indicates, this group is characterized by an almost equally high optimism and identification with the country, and an equally low relative deprivation as the first group, although the indicator of "lost paradise" is almost zero. This is the group which, in comparison with others, perceives its own influence on what is going on as the strongest, and the influence of the president as the weakest. This is also the group which indicates the strongest tendency to moralize social conflicts. The third group (33% of the sample), are people wronged by the present, and therefore significantly more often by the new than the old socio-political order, the majority of whom feel wronged by the dominant elements of the present system: government, president and nouveau riche. Their modest feel- ing of being wronged is located "here and now," and is not, therefore, directed at either the past or other nations. In terms of age, education, earnings and financial aspirations, this group is situated between the remaining groups. A significant part of the farmers and unemployed are classified in this group (42% each), though not many non-workers (23%). This group is somewhat less satisfied with its life than the former group, however, it illustrates a significantly stronger effect of "lost paradise" and any kind of optimism is absent: It perceives its present life as not very satisfying, worse than in the past, and does not expect that life will be any better in five years. In comparison with the former groups, this one perceives its influence as clearly weaker, and the influence of the president as stronger. It also clearly has a weaker identification with present Poland and it demonstrates a relatively weak tendency to moralize socio- -political conflicts.</page><page sequence="9">TREND REPORT 183 The least numerous (1 1 % of the respondents) was the fourth and last group, which feels wronged by a very large number of wrongdoers (average of 8.3). It could be described as simply those who feel wronged by everything : the govern- ment, president, "Solidarity," the new order, and - somewhat less frequently - by the old order, Russians, Germans and even Jews, the Catholic Church and the police. The last three of the listed sources of feeling wronged were indicated very rarely and, in practical terms, only by people from this very group. This group is the oldest, least educated and poorest, and also mentions the largest sum of money which they lack for a satisfactory life (see table 2). Classified in this group are a relatively large number of budget sphere employees (17%), farmers (15%), and not many employed in private enterprises (4%). Despite what one would believe, in this group retired persons are not over- -represented (only 8% of the retired people are in this group), whereas men are over-represented in this group as they constitute 58% of this group. They are, hence, the bread-winners of the family, who were caught in a situation in which they had problems adjusting to the socio-economic changes, for they were already over forty and poorly educated (both of these factors strongly determine the adaptive capacities to systemic changes in our country - see Czapinski 1995). Although people in this group feel somewhat wronged by everything, significantly more of them feel wronged by the new socio-economic order than by the old. Naturally, people from this group are characterized by the least satisfaction with their life, indicating the strongest "lost paradise" effect, only a trace of optimism, and in general they do not consider their lives to be better than that of the average Pole. They most weakly identify with their own country and perceive their influence on issues as the weakest, and the president's as the strongest (in comparison with other groups). In this group a strong tendency also appears to moralize socio-political conflicts. Determinants of Feeling Wronged Table 3 illustrates the influence of 9 potential factors on the strength of the feeling of being wronged, as measured by the number of indicated wrongdoers. Among the socio-demographic variables, age and size of place of residence proved to be significant. Older people, and those living in larger places (particularly large cities) appeared to be more wronged. The factor limiting the feeling of being wronged proved to be education, including one's own education and (and independent of this) the father's education. The strongest predictor of feeling wronged, however, proved to be a subjective factor in the form of degree of satisfaction with one's family income - although the size of this income was not declared. We obtained identical results in the analysis of data from sample 1 - here again the wronged were distinguished from those not wronged by the degree of satisfaction with income, although not income alone. Of course, declared incomes among the respondents could diverge con- siderably from actual incomes. Additional data from sample 1, however, sug- gests that wronged people differ from those who have not been wronged more in the degree of dissatisfaction with one's material situation, than in the objective indices. In this sample we placed a fairly developed battery of ques- tions about goods and household appliances possessed (car, color television,</page><page sequence="10">184 TREND REPORT Table 3 Predictors of feelings of being wronged (number of indicated wrongdoers) established by multiple regression (the stepwise method) (sample 2) stepwise/ variable R2 Beta In F (for analysis) satisfaction with earnings 0.060 -0.25 62.51 age 0.074 0.12 39.09 evaluation of others' standard of living 0.085 -0.10 30.10 necessary sum to live satisfactorily 0.091 0.08 24.27 one's own education 0.097 -0.09 21.00 size of place of residence 0.105 0.09 18.93 father's education 0.109 -0.08 16.98 All F tests significant at p&lt; 0.001; declared earnings and size of town in which respondent was raised were not included by regression analysis. video, washing machine, telephone, cottage, etc.) and we found that the wronged were not worse off than the not-wronged in terms of the possession of any of these goods. This suggests that the wronged are characterized simply by higher material aspirations, which is confirmed by the data in table 3, where the sum mentioned as essential in order to live satisfactorily appeared to be an important predictor of feelings of being wronged. Interestingly, a negative predictor of feelings of being wronged appeared to be the evaluation of others' lives - the lower the respondents evaluated the living standard of others, the more often they felt wronged. This suggests that the respondents not only did not indicate a tendency to a lesser feeling of being wronged, when they considered others' lives as bad (or worse than their own), but the reverse: the worse they see the life of others, the more they feel wronged. The conviction that others don't have it easy, does not hinder one's own feeling of being wronged, but in fact strengthens it. In general, the feeling of being wronged proved to be not very predictable in our research - all seven of the important predictors from table 3 predicted only 11% of the variants of feeling wronged. Consequences of Feeling Wronged Although this research obtained relatively weak data on predictors of feelings of being wronged, a large number of results do indicate a ifar reaching, and very broad, though rather shallow "overflow" of consequences of feelings of being wronged. The consequences, or correlations, are very numerous, although their relationship with feelings of being wronged are usually somewhat weak. Dissatisfaction with Life The first and obvious consequence of feeling wronged is a lowered satisfaction with life, a strengthened effect of "lost paradise," that is the conviction that one's life is presently worse than five years previously, a slight decrease of optimism, that is the conviction that life in five years will be better than it is presently, and a slight strengthening of relative deprivation, that is the convic-</page><page sequence="11">TREND REPORT 185 tion that one's life is worse than the life of the average Pole. Table 4 illustrates all of this, showing also that the number of "wrongs" is somewhat more strongly correlated with other variables than the evaluation of satisfaction with one's own life. Very similar results were obtained from the analysis of sample 1, where the wronged were lower than the not wronged in terms of all (usually categorical) of the indices of satisfaction with life, including indices about the present feelings. For example, in response to the question What do you think , will things be better in a year or two , the same , or worse than now , as much as 33% of the wronged, and only 19% of the not wronged claimed that it would be worse, *2(3) = 42.51, p&lt;0.01, V = 0.16 . In sample 1, a condensed version of the Beck depression scale (BDI - Beck et. al. 1961) was used (reduced to 13 positions). Wronged people obtained significantly higher results on this (22.45) than the not wronged (20.15) and the effect of a feeling of being wronged was significant, even the influence of the respondent's age was controlled for with the aid of covariance analysis, F(1.1638) = 36.49, p&lt; 0.001. The influence of the feeling of being wronged itself, however, was significantly weaker than the influence of age (the partial eta coefficients were 0.35 for age and 0.15 for feeling wronged). Table 4 Feelings of being wronged and indices of total satisfaction with life (Pearson's r correlation; sample 2) number satisfaction of wrongs with life total satisfaction with life -0.24** - lost paradise 0.18** - optimism -0.11** -0.05 relative deprivation 0.15** - identification with country -0.27** -0.24** own influence (%) -0.16** 0.15** influence of president (%) 0.18** -0.16** *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01 Note: the correlations of satisfaction with life with that of "lost paradise" and "relative deprivation" was omitted in the table because the evalu- ations of satisfaction with the present life were used in the construction of these two indices (see Method). Table 4 also illustrates that the feeling of being wronged clearly weakens identification with the country, that is the conviction that "presently, Poland is really my country," weakens the feeling of the influence on what is happen- ing in one's own family, place of residence and country as a whole, and strengthens the conviction that the president has an influence on these issues. Similar results were also obtained from the analysis of sample 1 - for example, as much as 53% of the wronged, and only 40% of the not wronged, consider- ed that there had already been times in their life when they decided about their own fate to a greater degree than presently, x2(2) = 27.09, p&lt; 0.001, V = 0.13. Furthermore, as much as 46% of the wronged, and only 28% of the not wronged claimed that often, or very often, problems had arisen in the past year which they were unable to deal with, x2(2) = 59.19, p&lt;0.001, V = 0.19.</page><page sequence="12">186 TREND REPORT Negative Vision of the Social World The second clear correlation with feelings of being wronged is a negative vision of the social world. In sample 1, we asked our respondents, In your opinion, are the people you meet on a daily basis more... [ characteristic ], less... [characteristic]... or unchanged in this regard 1. This question was asked in reference to six positive characteristics and six negative characteristics listed in table 5. In reference to the positive characteristics (except for being energetic) the view dominates among Poles that the people they meet on a regular basis have increasingly less of these characteristics, whereas in reference to negative characteristics (except for laziness) the view is that they have increasingly more of these characteristics. Poles, therefore, have a clearly negative opinion about changes which the people they meet on a daily basis are undergoing, and this negativism, in the case of almost every characteristic, is significantly stronger among people who feel wronged, as table S illustrates. Table 5 Percentage of wronged and not wronged people giving select responses to die question In your opinion, are the people you meet on a daily basis more... {characteristic], less...

Negativism concerns not only opinions about changes, but also the diag- nosis of the present state of people met on a regular basis. For example, most of the respondents from sample 1 believe that, "generally people in Poland," don't respect the law, do not honestly pay taxes, do not work hard, don't respect public property and don't treat others with respect, and each of these convictions is significantly more intense among the wronged than it is among the not wronged. The former significantly more often are of the opinion that Poles even raise their children poorly (!). Similar results were obtained in sample 2, where we asked the respondents how much they believe that Lech Walfsa has IS different positive characteris- tics. Ascribing every single one of these characteristics was significantly hin- dered by the extent of feeling wronged among the respondents, although this</page><page sequence="13">TREND REPORT 187 tendency was clearly stronger in ascribing moral characteristics, such as hon- esty , or unselfishness than with characteristics connected with efficacy, that is those like intelligence or efficiency (in general, the correlation coefficients between feelings of being wronged and attributing Walesa with moral and efficacy characteristics were respectively - 0.22 and 0.1 1). This last result most convincingly shows that the function of a negative worldview among wronged people is the search (moral) for people to blame, other than themselves, and coming up with scapegoats. A negative social vision of the world among wronged people is also accompanied by greater sensitivity to the transgression of norms by others. We assumed that, important from the perspective of feeling wronged, is the differentiation of the transgression of social norms according to whether it is based on the exploitation of others and/or the evasion of participation in the creation of social goods, or if the transgression of norms is not a form of "free-riding." We anticipated that wronged people will, more so than not wronged people, be sensitive to an exploitive form of transgressing social norms, although these differences would not exist in a non-exploitive breaking of norms. One of the questions from sample 1 enumerated seven cases of exploitive transgressing of social norms (lowering one's taxes, evading electricity pay- ments, evading building fees, evading duty fees, illegally collecting unemploy- ment insurance and workers winning a raise from a state enterprise with a deficit, arranging private business during work hours), and seven cases of non-exploitive norm transgression (using environmentally harmful products, evading military service, noisy behavior by youth, littering, speeding, spread- ing illness, a councilor not meeting office hours). We asked the respondents how much it does/or doesn't bother them that someone breaks social norms by their actions (there were four possible responses, from "it doesn't bother me at all" to "it really bothers me"). Calculation of the chi square statistic in a 2 (wronged - not-wronged) x 4 (degree of sensitivity to transgression of norms) proves that wronged people react significantly stronger (p&lt;0.01, the Cramer V indicator was usually at a level of approx. 0.01) to 6 of the 7 de- scribed cases of exploitive transgression of social norms (with the exception of arranging private business during work hours), although for non-exploitive transgression of norm we noted this differences in only one case (littering). It should be noted that the intensity of negativism among wronged people concerns the perception only of others, but not of oneself. This is illustrated well by one of the results obtained in research sample 1 when the respondents were asked to imagine that a water pipe burst in their neighborhood, and how much water from the water supply truck they, and their neighbors, would take. As figure 2 illustrates, most of the respondents anticipated that they would take "a little less than they needed themselves so that there would be enough for everyone," and almost every fifth person claimed that they would take "enough water to have enough reserves for the next few hours." In this case, the wronged do not differ from the not-wronged, x2&lt;l. The difference only appeared in the anticipation of others' actions. Not only did our respon- dents suspect others of egoism more often than of altruism, but this suspicion was more frequent among the wronged than the not wronged, x2(3) = 16.3, pcO.OOl, V = 0.10.</page><page sequence="14">188 TREND REPORT Fig. 2. The percentage of people wronged and not wronged who suspect different behavior of themselves and others in situation of water pipe breakage (sample 1). The claim could be made that blaming others is a typical reaction to feeling wronged, having considered how intense and almost without exception is the human tendency to maintain belief in the high value of one's own person (see Greenwald, 1980). This is probably not, however, the only cause of a negative vision of the social world among people who feel wronged. The results presented below indicate that they have an even greater tendency to see the social world in moral categories, which could be conducive to a negative perception of the world. Moralization of the View of the World of Social Relations Numerous studies, both Polish (Brycz and Wojciszke 1982; Kubicka-Daab, 1989; Wojciszke, Brycz and Borkenau 1993; Wojciszke, Pienkowski, Maro- szek, Brycz and Ratajczak 1993), and American (Coovert and Reeder 1990; Skowronski and Carlston 1987; Reeder and Coovert 1986; Reeder and Spores 1983) claim that in the field of morality, the negative weighs more than the positive. A person who steals one thousand zlotys and offers one thousand zlotys to charity is not considered neutral, but as negative. Brycz and Woj- ciszke claimed that to overcome the negative implication of one immoral act, ten moral acts need be committed (although one intelligent act is enough to overcome one stupid act). Having considered that the behavior of others and of different social world objects usually contain both positive and negative aspects, the tendency contended at the outset, that wronged people prefer What others would do What I would do 60 T « I51 | I ill .......

In sample 2 we asked three batteries of questions measuring the different aspects of the tendency to prefer moral categories in the perception of the social world. The first battery concerned the manner of perceiving four social conflicts: abortion, de-communization, privatization and the rise in pensions and annuities (at the costs of increasing fees carried by the employed). One of the questions about each of these conflicts was: Do you think that one side is better than the other in this conflict, that, for example, people are more decent and moral on one side than on the other ? The total responses {no = 1 , hard to say = 2, yes = 3) for all four issues constituted the index of the moralization of social conflicts. It positively correlated with the intensity of feelings of being wronged (although not with the general satisfaction with life), as illustrated in table 6. The respondents were also asked to attribute "100% right" between advocates of the three possible stances in each issue (for ex., "absolute prohib- ition of abortion," "some middle solution," "give everyone a choice." In accord with what should have been expected of people with a tendency to moralize conflicts, they demonstrated a tendency to consider their own stance to be more correct and this last tendency was also correlated with feelings of being wronged. Finally, the stronger their feeling of being wronged, the greater the tendency to over-evaluate the universality of their own opinion, as well as to penalize advocates of opposing views (we included three degrees of penalty in the survey: "forbid them to fill state functions," "forbid them to do or say what they want to" and "prosecute them"). It appears, therefore, that the wronged have a greater tendency to wrong others if the others do not agree with them in conflictive social issues. The second battery of questions connected with the use of moral categories concerned explaining macro-social events: negative (the alcohol affair, the Art-B affair) and positive (stopping hyperinflation and reducing Poland's foreign debt by half). The respondents were given three types of explanations for each of the events: one in terms of moral characteristics of actors on the public scene (for ex., "politicians and bureaucrats were dishonest and intro- duced unclear legislation in order to exploit it"), one in terms of efficacy characteristics of those actors (for ex., "politicians and bureaucrats who intro- duced these legislation were unprofessional") and one in abstract terms, non- -anthropomorphic (for ex., "after the fall of socialism, the old law began to change to the new, therefore, gaps and confusion arose"). In the case of negative events, the feeling of being wronged was correlated - as illustrated in table 6 - with explanations of them in terms of both immoral and inefficient actors of the public scene. In the positive events, however, the feeling of being wronged correlated with denying the actors both morality and efficacy. In both cases, the explanation in terms of moral characteristics more strongly correlated with feelings of being wronged than the explanation in terms of efficacy (although this difference was not declared when "feelings of being wronged," was replaced by "general satisfaction with life"). Finally, the last battery of questions testing the tendency of the "wronged" to give greater weight to moral categories concerned the perception of President L. Walesa and indicators of acceptance of his presidency. The respondents were</page><page sequence="16">190 TREND REPORT asked to indicate how much they do or do not believe that President L. Walesa has 15 characteristics, among which were moral characteristics (like honesty or justice), efficacy characteristics (like effectiveness or intelligence) and characteristics concerning how sympathetic he is (like "handsome" or "nice"). In accord with the predictions, the detailed presentation of which we will omit at this point, the analysis of the principle components demonstrated that judgments of these 15 characteristics can be reduced to three components: efficacy, morality and sympathy. After calculating the factor scores for each respondent in terms of each of the three factors, we performed logistic regression analysis (stepwise method) wherein acceptance of Walesa's presidency was treated as the predicted binary event, and the factor scores - as three predictors of this event. Regression analysis was performed separately for wronged (groups 2, 3 and 4 from fig. 1) and not wronged persons (group 1).

This is confirmed by the relatively greater role of moral categories among wronged people, and the value of this confirmation is that this fact was established in a purely analyti- cal manner, without conscious control by the respondents (who do not control consciously multiple correlations of their own judgments). Helplessness and Lack of Control The already mentioned consequence of feeling wronged was the feeling of influence on how well off the respondent's family is, on what is happening in the place of residence and in all of Poland. For each of these three questions, the respondents (sample 2) were asked to distribute 100% influence among five different sources including the president, the Polish government and "myself' (or "common people like me" in the case of place of residence and all of Poland). The distribution "of percentages of influence" ascribed to these three sources by people classified to four groups differing in terms of the scheme of wrongs experiences (from fig. 1) proved to be very sys- tematic, as presented in table 8. Table 8 Differentiation of people who don't feel wronged (group 1), who feel wronged by the past (group 2), by the present (group 3) and by everything (group 4) according to perceived influence, like that on the wealth of their family, their place of residence and the country as a whole which they exert themselves, or which the president exerts (sample 2) Group 1 Group 2 Group 3 Group 4 F eta Influence on the well-being on one's own family president 10.7 10.3 16.9 19.2 12.72** 0.20 government 42.0 43.9 43.6 41.0 &lt;1 0.04 oneself 25.1 26.8 18.6 18.4 5.91** 0.13 Influence on the well-being of one's place of residence president 9.0 8.6 13.0 12.2 6.34** 0.13 government 27.2 31.7 29.8 26.4 2.81 0.09 oneself 13.0 11.0 9.3 5.0 9.58** 0.16 Influence on the well-being of all of Poland president 23.6 21.2 29.2 32.1 12.74** 0.19 government 47.0 46.7 46.9 45.9 &lt;1 0.03 oneself 6.8 8.8 5.3 2.8 8.62** 0.16 *p&lt;0.01; **p&lt;0.001 The greater the feeling of being wronged, the lower the percent of one's own influence and the greater the percent of the President's influence. Even in the case of influence on the well-being of one's own family. For example, the</page><page sequence="18">192 TREND REPORT group wronged by everyone attributes the president with an average of 19% of the influence on the well-being of one's own family, and so just as much as to oneself (18%). The situation looks very similar among those wronged by the present, which, we remind the reader, every third Poles belongs to: 17% for the president, 19% for oneself. Not wronged people see the issue complete- ly differently: 1 1 % of the influence for the president, 25% for oneself. The feeling of being wronged, therefore, concurs with the conviction that one has no influence on how well-off one's own family is. Nor do they want any, because influence also means responsibility for what is happening. And if it's going badly (in the respondent's opinion), it's better not to take responsi- bility for it and consider that the well-being of one's own family is dependent in 80% of the cases on someone/thing other than myself. The person living with a feeling of being wronged feels as if his or her input into world events, even in his or her own family, has already been given in the form of suffering. The understanding is that, given that I have born so much already, that is, that I have suffered, I am freed from influence on that which happens further. Now it's someone else's turn: the president (17-19%), the management of my work place (14-16%), and above all, the government, which is attributed with the most influence (41-44%). Such is the understanding of those who have been wronged. But even the not wronged attribute the government with 42% of the influence on the well-being of their own family, and therefore much more than themselves (25%). This is how, therefore, in the opinion of the majority of Poles, issues rest in the hands of the government (regardless of feelings of being wronged) and the president (more so the greater the feeling of being wronged). In the opinion of our respondents, "they have" a total of 56% of the influence on the well-being of the family of the average Pole, 39% of the influence on what is going on in one's place of residence and 73% on what is going on in Poland as a whole. The relatively low percentage in the case of one's place of residence does not mean a lot of influence is attributed to oneself - in this case, among the possible responses we placed, "city/county administrators," which were evaluated as responsible for an average of 46% of the influence on city/county issues. The results of the research on sample 1 were very similar, where we asked the question about feelings of behavioral control exercised over one's own fate (Do you have the feeling that you decide about your own fate ?) and two questions about the feeling of control, cognitively understood as conviction about the capacity to predict the direction of one's own life (i Can you predict what you will be doing in the coming few years!) and prediction about events in the country ( Can you predict what will happen in Poland in the coming few years ?). As the data in table 9 indicate, the feeling of being wronged signifi- cantly differentiated responses to all three questions. It is no surprise that the wronged less frequently claim that they control their own fate. Were they in control, they would not feel wronged. Concurrent with this result is that among the wronged there is more often the feeling that they are unable to predict what will happen in the future of their own lives. They could, however, be wronged again unexpectedly. Superficially, therefore, it is surprising that the relationship between conviction about the predictabil- ity of the future, and the feeling of having been wronged is reversed, when it does not concern personal events, but Poland. In this last case the wronged</page><page sequence="19">TREND REPORT 193 Table 9 Feelings of being wronged and feelings of behavioral and cognitive control: the percentage of wronged and not wronged people convinced of being in control of their own fate and of the capacity to predict what would happen in their own life and in the country (sample 1) wronged not wronged x2 V control over one's own fate 12.7** 0.08 no 53.0 47.0 yes 39.1 60.9 predicting - one's own life 5.23* 0.07 no 48.3 51.7 yes 40.1 59.9 predicting - the country 19.30- 0.11 no 44.7 55.3 yes 60.2 39.8 *p&lt;0.01; **p&lt;0.001 have the feeling of more predicable potential. This result, however, is not so surprising having considered that the formerly mentioned data indicates a very profound pessimism among the wronged. Poland's future is easy for these people to predict in the following sense: it is bad, it will be worse. The supposition could be thence made that for those people who tend to think in categories of external attribution, the prediction of external circumstances influencing their lives is important, but this in no way need mean that this life is easy to predict because no one ever knows when or where the next wrong will be inflicted by these circumstances. The wronged people, therefore, are not at all necessarily cognitively confounded people. On the contrary, these are rather people with a clear, though perhaps simplified, view of the social reality which surrounds them. Summary In general, the results obtained appear to leave no doubt that the feeling of having been wronged is quite common among contemporary Poles, particularly the elderly, those with less education and lower incomes. The perceptions of the wrongdoers are either distant (government, president), abstract, or non-person (the new post- 89 order; the old order; those who are getting wealthy), not the close and the familiar (husband/wife; parents). Despite the very common feeling of being wronged, it is not experienced by all Poles according to the same model, on the contrary - our analysis suggests that at least three such models could be indicated: a feeling of being wronged by the old socio-political order, a feeling of being wronged by the new socio-political order, and a feeling of being wronged by everything and everyone (except by one's immediate family). People with the characteristics of these three models of experiencing feelings of being wronged also display different socio-demographic characteristics. The feeling of being wronged appears to be determined primarily by the degree of dissatisfaction with one's income (although not its objective level), advanced age and a low level of education. In terms of consequences of feeling</page><page sequence="20">194 TREND REPORT wronged, one could indicate a lower satisfaction with life and an increase in depression, an intensified "lost paradise" phenomenon, and a weakening of optimism, a negative image of the social world and, in connection with this, an intensified tendency to (over)use moral categories in the perception of the social world as well as a tendency to perceive one's influence as small, both on close (such as one's family's well-being), or distant issues (such as the state of the country as a whole). In sum, the feeling of being wronged among Poles is not only our auto- -stereotype. It is a social fact: the feeling of being wronged is wide spread through society and has fairly extensive (though weak rather than strong) consequences on one's perception of the social world and of one's life.
