<plain_text><page sequence="1">ISSUES IN THE STUDY OF SOUTHEASTERN PREHISTORIC CAVE ART Jan F. Simek and Alan Cressler ABSTRACT Research on dark zone cave art in the Southeast has confronted archaeologists with a variety of technical and interpretive problems unique to the cave environment and to the subject matter encountered in the art itself. Six areas of concern treat solutions to challenges raised by cave dark zones as contexts for research as well as issues in the study of southeastern cave art in its cultural context. Logistics, documentation, variability in the art work, its chronology, its interpretation, and conservation are each considered in turn. A rich and varied expressive tradition, one beginning in the Archaic and continuing into the Mississippian, is now evident in the region. Introduction For nearly 130 years, European archaeologists have confronted the problems posed by prehistoric dark zone cave art1?ancient art that was produced deep inside natural subterranean passageways well beyond the reach of external light (Piette 1894; Sautuola 1880). In North America, aboriginal art in similar deep cave situations was rarely encountered until 1979 (but see Barr 1961; Ellis and Hammack 1968), when complex images incised into wet clay were discovered in Mud Glyph Cave in East Tennessee (Faulkner 1986; Faulkner et al. 1984). The discovery of Mud Glyph Cave began a long-standing commitment on the part of University of Tennessee archaeologists to the study of southeastern caves. Since the discovery of Mud Glyph Cave, more than 30 other art caves have been found in the Southeast, including examples in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia. Most of these lie along the Cumberland Plateau escarpment of the Appalachian Plateau in Tennessee, but others are in the karsts of the eastern Ridge and Valley Province (Simek et al. 2001). The context of dark zone cave archaeology, especially that dealing with art, presents a variety of challenges for archaeologists (e.g., Watson 1969, 1974), from technical and logistical difficulties in the field to interpretation of the imagery itself. In this article, we will describe some of our approaches to these issues. We stress from the outset that these techniques and approaches are neither especially novel nor necessarily the best solutions to the problems we have encountered in Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 26, No. 2 ? 2001 by The University of Iowa</page><page sequence="2">234 Jan F Simek and Alan Cressler our work; they are simply our current solutions, and we offer them for the consideration of others working with dark zone cave art. Six problem areas will be discussed: logistics, documentation, variability in the imagery, its chronology, its interpretation, and conservation. Logistical Problems Logistical challenges in studying cave art in the Southeast begin with access to the sites, which, it seems, is never easy. Landowner permission is the first issue, and it must be obtained in every case. We have not met many owners who refuse our request to work on their property; in fact, most owners we encounter are fascinated by, and quite committed to protecting, the prehistoric resources on their lands. Some owners, including the Tennessee Valley Authority and certain private proprietors, have contributed material and financial support to our efforts. In all cases landowners have asked that we keep secret the names and locations of their sites in exchange for permission to work on their property. Thus, we refer to caves using pseudonyms rather than local or registry names. Physically reaching the sites and the decorations within the caves has proved difficult, at times even dangerous. In some cases, this is due to modern landscapes that are different than those present prehistorically. For example, 1st Unnamed Cave in Tennessee (Faulkner and Simek 1996a; Simek et al. 1997) today must be approached by boat, because river impoundment has brought lake water into the cave mouth. That was not the case in prehistory, when the river was 100 m away and 10 m below the cave. With a vestibule that floods with rising lake levels, and additional ponding produced by beaver habitation inside the cave, conditions do not reflect the ancient situation. Other caves are simply inconvenient for archaeology. 3rd Unnamed Cave (Franklin 2001; Simek et al. 1998) lies at the bottom of a 450-m-deep gorge with no passable roads to the cave mouth. Moreover, the prehistoric pictures in 3rd Unnamed Cave are located in a remote, abandoned conduit 3 km from the present entrance. Reaching that chamber requires researchers to pass over a 20-m-deep chasm by wedging into a crack and moving laterally for 15 m. Recreational cavers, who explore virtually any cave or pit that can be navigated by the human body, face far more difficult passages in their subterranean voyages, but when archaeologists carry in excavation equipment and carry out hundreds of kilograms of artifacts and sediment (as was done in 3rd Unnamed Cave; Franklin 2001), the logistical solutions are less than obvious. As no vehicles can approach this cave mouth, all equipment and artifact collections must be carried into and out of the gorge in backpacks. Unfortunately, archaeologists are rarely trained as muleskinners, even in Tennessee. Inside the caves, the most serious logistical problem is light in sufficient quantities to allow detailed observation and recording of the graphic images. Exploration of caves and locating art on the walls can usually be accomplished with lightweight, helmet-mounted caving lamps and small portable flashlights. It is our experience that florescent lights directed at an angle to the cave walls</page><page sequence="3">Issues in the Study of Southeastern Prehistoric Cave Art 235 provides the best means for illuminating prehistoric images, even fine and faint engravings, because the light from florescent sources is even, soft, and diffuse. But lighting requirements for recording and documentation, including mapping, are more problematic. Close to the cave mouth, portable generators can be used to power electric lights. Rarely, however, are prehistoric graphics close to the cave mouth, and generators cannot be operated inside caves without exposing archaeologists and every other living thing in the cavity to unacceptable levels of toxic carbon monoxide-enriched exhaust. Where access is not too long and difficult, battery packs like those used for video lights can provide excellent illumination. However, battery packs are heavy and provide power for only a limited time. When working deep underground for long periods, battery-powered lamps are not a satisfactory solution. In the most difficult situations, where art is far from the cave mouth and access to it is hard, we employ small, gas-powered (propane or butane) camping lamps. These lamps?some as small as 15 cm long packed in a plastic carrying case? weigh around 300 g, are available with a frosted globe producing soft, diffuse light, and can generate 100 watts of illumination for six hours on a single 350 g canister of fuel. We are quite satisfied with these lamps as lightweight, portable, and intense light sources for documentation, and we also use them to light excavation projects in deep cave contexts. Rather heavier and less reliable than the camping lamps but with brighter illumination are various battery-powered, high-intensity spotlights sold in marine and automobile parts stores. These hand-held spotlights are quite useful in exploring caves, where portability and intensity are important assets, but they are less useful when examining details of cave walls or floor deposits. The best ones have rechargeable battery packs that each provide up to four hours of light; the most intense can generate up to 1,500,000 candle power in a single, focused beam. Relatively low-cost and lightweight alternatives to video camera lights, we have found these hand-held beams essential in documenting phenomena like mineral and clay mining in several deep Tennessee caves. A final set of logistical problems stems from the extremely fragile nature of cave environments themselves. All research materials must be environmentally safe. Lamps must burn cleanly. Gas canisters must be resealed and removed. Batteries must be sealed and leak-proof. Most importantly, archaeologists must remove all products of their activities from the cave when they depart. This includes trash, exhausted batteries, paper, flagging tape, pins, human waste, etc. Such requirements are necessitated by the distinctive and endangered character of cave fauna and flora. Wood rats (Neotoma floridana), cave crickets, and numerous rare fish, amphibian, crustacean, and insect species inhabit caves, and many will consume or line their nests with virtually any material left for them to find. To ensure the survival of these creatures, archaeologists must be certain to pack out everything they bring or generate in the cave, and this can sometimes require packing special bags, containers, etc., in addition to equipment, artifacts, and samples.</page><page sequence="4">236 Jan F Simek and Alan Cressler Documentation of Images Recording and illustrating prehistoric cave art in Tennessee has been a difficult task, complicated by access and the often-ephemeral nature of the works themselves. Because of the relative ease in transporting equipment and the accuracy of the resulting documents, photography has been our basic method of data acquisition. Yet even photography in the dark zone of caves is not an obvious proposition, especially for generating primary data on cave graphics. Light is again the major problem, one that cannot be solved simply with a camera-mounted flash. Many images are lightly engraved into the mud or rock of cave walls and can be seen only when light rakes across them from the side, highlighting their minimal relief. This means that incidental or ambient light must be used, often employing secondary or "slave" flash systems, rendering the more common exposure settings, with sensitivity oriented to outdoor photography, incapable of recording the detailed images needed for analysis. We will simply note here that we have obtained useful photographs with tripod-mounted cameras using only raking flashes and/or florescent flashlight beams for a light source. Southeastern prehistoric cave art can be quite enigmatic in theme and complicated in execution, often comprising layered images and multiple-line elements. In order to perceive the individual images in detail, it is often desirable to reduce the photographic record to simple line drawings. To do this with as little loss in information as possible, we have developed a method to make line drawings from photographs using digital images and readily available software. First, a photograph, whether print or slide, is scanned into a digital image file. That file is opened in Adobe Photoshop, a current, standard commercial photograph manipulation program. The image is converted to black and white, sharpened if necessary, and extreme areas of brightness and darkness are ameliorated. The image is then inverted to a negative, which usually darkens and enhances engraved lines on cave walls. If needed, the image is digitally retouched to amplify contrast between the art work and its photographic matrix. Then, those areas of the image that are not part of the prehistoric icon (like open cave wall areas) are "erased" by blocking them and replacing them with a white background. Care is taken to distinguish between natural wall features like cracks and products of human action. The result is then converted to a bitmap image, which approximates a black and white line drawing. This drawing is taken into the cave for comparison with the actual images. We have found remarkable concordance in all measurable characteristics between the original and the digital versions (Figure 1). The method is fast and efficient and requires little or no interpretation (or real talent) on the part of the recorder. Variability Until recently, the literature on southeastern cave art has left the impression in some circles that mud glyphs are the dominant form in the region (e.g., Bahn</page><page sequence="5">Issues in the Study of Southeastern Prehistoric Cave Art 237 Figure 1. (a) Prehistoric circle pictograph in clay from 1st Unnamed Cave, Tennes see, (b) Line drawing of the glyph produced by using photo-enhancement and image processing.</page><page sequence="6">238 Jan F Simek ano Alan Cressler 1998). The unique nature of mud wall carvings and the opportunistic way that they might have been produced by some ancient cave visitors, did not, at first, warrant the definition of a true artistic tradition in the southeastern U.S. However, now that a number of other sites have been found, we can begin to outline ancient methods of decorating caves. At least three forms of renderings are known: pictographs, petroglyphs, and mud glyphs. Pictographs are images produced by adding pigments or coloring to the cave wall. They are the rarest form of cave art in the Southeast, although they are the most common in Missouri caves (Diaz-Granados and Duncan 2000). Materials we have seen include fine clay, ochre, and, especially, charcoal. A clay pictograph was found in 1st Unnamed Cave (Figure la), and several charcoal images are known from other sites, including 11th Unnamed Cave, where they are associated with both mud glyphs and petroglyphs. Pictographs tend to be simple in execution, although their simplicity of line can belie significant artistic sophistication. Because they represent mineral pigments applied to rock surfaces, pictographs are as fragile as mud glyphs, if not more so, in situations where cave walls are unstable. Petroglyphs are engravings carved or pecked directly into the stone of the cave walls and ceiling (Figure 2). With nearly two-thirds of the known sites containing petroglyphs, this is the most common form of cave art. A cave may contain a few or many engraved images, and the individual images can be quite elaborate and beautiful. Because petroglyphs were engraved directly into rock exposures, they are rather less fragile than mud glyphs. Mud glyphs, like those found at Mud Glyph Cave, were traced into wet clay on cave ceilings, walls, or floors using fingers or sharp tools (Figure 3). Nine mud glyph sites are known (Faulkner and Simek 1996b, 2001). At some mud glyph sites, such as 1st Unnamed and Mud Glyph Caves in East Tennessee, 19th Unnamed Cave in Alabama, Crumps Cave in Kentucky, and Little Mountain Cave in Virginia, hundreds of diverse images were traced into the damp mud of the cave interiors. In those sites, both abstract and representational forms can be seen. In other caves, like 7th and 11th Unnamed Caves in Tennessee, only a few mud glyph images were produced, comprising only abstract, meandering lines. Partly due to the fragile nature of these works, the conditions of their production and preservation are important issues for further research. There were at least three production techniques for mud glyphs (Faulkner and Simek 2001). In some caves, mud glyphs were incised into a thin veneer of clay coating the cave walls and ceiling. Sometimes, a sharp tool such as a chert flake was used, while other times blunt instruments such as torch canes or the artist's fingers were employed (Faulkner and Simek 2001). When a sharp tool was used, glyphs are made with a single line defining the form (Cressler et al. 1999). When a blunt instrument was used, multiple lines often form the image outline (e.g., Simek et al. 1997). In some caves, glyphs were cut into deep clay banks along the cave walls; in those cases, incision with a sharp tool is the rule, and images are formed by single traces (Faulkner 1986). At Adair Cave in Kentucky, glyphs were incised with a sharp tool into mud coating the cave floor (DiBlasi 1996). Variation in production</page><page sequence="7">Issues in the Study of Southeastern Prehistoric Cave Art 239 Figure 2. Prehistoric anthropomorph petroglyph from 12th Unnamed Cave, Tennessee. of mud glyphs relates at least in part to the surfaces available for decoration: clay banks are present in some caves, wall and ceiling veneer in others. But not all caves having clay banks or veneers?even those with evidence for prehistoric Native American visitation?have mud glyphs in them. The preservation of mud glyphs, and how variation in preservation environments might affect our perception of distribution and composition, are important subjects for future research. Clearly, southeastern prehistoric cave art is quite variable, encompassing many of the general variations in technique known from cave art complexes elsewhere in the world. Prehistoric artisans may have used different techniques in different settings, depending on their purpose for making a particular set of images. Images include both abstract figures or groups of lines and elaborate representations of animals, humans, and symbols. In addition, images were combined into panels,</page><page sequence="8">240 Jan F. Simek and Alan Cressler Figure 3. Prehistoric mud glyph from Mud Glyph Cave, Tennessee. This image of an anthropomorphic face was engraved into a fluvial mud deposit using a sharp tool. Note the "forked eye" and the clay intentionally removed from the image after production. and panels were differentially distributed through cave passageways. Thus, elements of composition were expressed at a variety of spatial scales. Our future research will entail detailed analysis of the precise contexts, distribution, and content of the different forms in order to see if regularities or patterning can be discovered that might shed light on the intent of the ancient artists. Because of the media employed, this ancient art work is very fragile. Mud glyphs, in particular, remain for us to view today because of a kind of geological serendipity. Mud is deposited and eroded from many cave walls as a complex result of bedrock characteristics and groundwater availability, but only in rare instances does a mud deposit remain preserved and unchanged in a cave for hundreds or thousands of years (Cressler et al. 1999; Faulkner and Simek 2001; Simek et al. 1997). Pictographs also are fragile, since prehistoric artisans do not appear to have used any fixative, such as animal fat, in their pigments. Even petroglyphs are delicate, often composed of light scratches into a cave wall. We do not know if the distribution of art we now see reflects prehistoric distributions, preservation contexts, or both. Thus, differential preservation, i.e., variation in site formation processes, must be comprehended before variability in southeastern cave art can be understood (Faulkner and Simek 2001).</page><page sequence="9">Issues In the Study of Southeastern Prehistoric Cave Art 241 Chronology When they were first discovered, the glyphs in Mud Glyph Cave clearly re sembled Southern Cult icons seen in the work of Mississippian peoples in the Southeast (Faulkner et al. 1984; Muller 1986). Based on this stylistic similarity, the age of the images could be estimated at between A.D. 1000 and 1600, an estimation later borne out by radiocarbon age determinations on cane torch frag ments (Faulkner 1986). Stylistic dating has long been a primary way archaeolo gists estimate age for parietal or wall art that "floats" above archaeological sedi ments (e.g., Leroi-Gourhan 1971). But stylistic dates are not very satisfactory because they assume that we already know what the art from all time periods should look like in all places. Happily, there are other ways to make age esti mates for prehistoric images. Scattered over the floor of Mud Glyph Cave and many other cave art sites are fragments of burned river canes used as torches by prehistoric cave explorers, and these fragments can be dated by radiocarbon as say. Table 1 lists 45 14C age determinations for cave art sites in the Southeast. Dates for Mammoth and Salts Caves in Kentucky are not included, even though there may be pictographs in both caves, because the dates have been recently reviewed elsewhere (Kennedy 1996) and none are directly associated with picture panels. Table 1 shows that cave art in the Southeast has significant time depth and comprises a great deal of ecological and cultural variability. Moreover, when production methods and iconographie subject matter are examined over time, possible patterning of content and technical emphasis is evident. It is also clear, however, that this is not a unitary or monolithic phenomenon. Terminal Archaic dates appear to be associated with some dark zone art work. DiBlasi (1996) describes mud glyphs from Adair Cave, including wavy lines ("meanders") and chevron forms, associated with a I4C determination of 3560?100 bp. In 3rd Unnamed Cave, less than 100 km from Adair, a series of dates on charcoal fragments recovered from hearths more than 1,000 m underground also indicates a Terminal Archaic occupation; these fireplaces were made to illuminate flint-knapping activities exploiting a chert deposit (Franklin 2001). On the ceiling above the knapping areas, a number of petroglyphs were incised, including a rayed oval, a chevron, and other symbols (Simek et al. 1998). It seems likely, therefore, that Archaic hunter-gatherers were the first to produce parietal art in southeastern caves and that its production may have related to economic activities like mining. Work by Watson and others shows that Woodland peoples used southeastern caves extensively (e.g., Crothers et al. n.d.; Watson 1969, 1974). Yet relatively few 14C dates indicate Woodland period cave art. Crumps Cave in Kentucky (Davis and Haskins 1993) has mud glyphs cut into deep clay banks more than 1 km below the cave mouth. A piece of charcoal found within an incised line had an age determination of 1980?60 BP, and a sample from a torch stoke mark near a glyph yielded an age of 1840180 BP. Woodland period dates also come from 5th, 6th, and 7th Unnamed and Mud Glyph Caves in Tennessee and 19th Unnamed</page><page sequence="10">242 Jan F Simek and Alan Cressler Table 1.

Thus, cave art produced in the Woodland period may have partly had a funerary context. By far, the most frequent Chronometrie age determinations link southeastern cave art with the Mississippian period. A cluster of calibrated 14C determinations</page><page sequence="11">Issues in the Study of Southeastern Prehistoric Cave Art 243 occurs between A.D. 1200 and A.D. 1350. Most mud glyph caves date to this period ( 1st Unnamed, 2nd Unnamed, and Mud Glyph Caves in Tennessee, Williams and Little Mountain Caves in Virginia). Mississippian period cave art is rarely associated with mining or burial, although clay mining and more enigmatic clay removal seem to have been practiced in several Mississippian cave art sites (Faulkner and Simek 2001). The subject matter is often similar to Southeastern Ceremonial Complex iconography, with some variations as discussed below. Radiocarbon dating helps to determine the temporal parameters of prehistoric southeastern cave art but does not pinpoint the age of the work itself. Some of the cane charcoal on cave floors beneath the images may have been dropped by the artists, but charcoal might have been left by visitors long before or long after the art work was produced. As already noted, this problem affects all studies of parietal art because the pictures "hang" above the datable material (except in rare cases where pictograph pigments can be directly dated via AMS). Therefore, a combination of stylistic and radiometrie techniques provides the best way to estimate the ages of prehistoric cave art. Even when both are applied, we cannot be absolutely certain that we know the ages of the images. Given the amount of cane charcoal usually scattered through cave passages, it should be possible to obtain even hundreds of dates for many caves. Thus, we can estimate a statistical probability for the time of production based on frequency of cave visitation over time. This approach will be very expensive and may require a dedicated dating facility in order to generate the large number of necessary determinations; nevertheless, it is the most robust technique for estimating the probable age of parietal art. The Problem of Meaning The most difficult aspect of studying southeastern cave art is trying to understand what the images mean and why prehistoric artists produced them. The aesthetic and enigmatic qualities of southeastern iconography were first recognized by William Henry Holmes in his 1883 work, Art in Shell of the Ancient Americans. Since Holmes's time, many archaeologists have attempted to document and interpret the complex nature of southeastern art. Analysis typically has emphasized decorated artifacts?ceramics, shell, and bone, usually from the late prehistoric Mississippian period. Very often, those artifacts came from contexts that obviously reflected high social status or ceremonial behavior, like burials or mound-top structures. This emphasis led to interpretations of southeastern imagery as iconographie, steeped in social order, religion, and cosmology. Waring and Holder (1945) defined the "Southern Cult" or "Southeastern Ceremonial Complex" as a set of shared icons linked to religious beliefs and ceremonies of Mississippian culture and to aspects of their complex social structure. Given similarities in subject matter between Mississippian religious icons and some cave images (Diaz-Granados and Duncan 2000; Faulkner and Simek 1996a, 1996b; Muller 1986; Simek, et al. 1997), it is simple and obvious to suggest that cave art was essentially religious, and this is almost certainly partly true, at least</page><page sequence="12">244 Jan F. Simek ano Alan Cressier for the Mississippian periods. We have already seen how the glyphs from Mud Glyph Cave resemble Southeastern Ceremonial Complex icons found in Mississippian sites: animal images, serpents, and warrior figures occur in both contexts. Other southeastern cave sites also have Mississippian icons: winged warriors, horned snakes, stylized birds, maces, and arrows. These Southeastern Ceremonial Complex images probably reflect aspects of Mississippian myth and cosmology and were used in religious contexts by priests. It is not surprising, therefore, that they also occur in the immensely private (perhaps sacred) precincts beneath the earth. In older sites, Mississippian-style icons of course are absent. Strange, abstract human and animal forms appear in Crumps Cave (KY) and 5th Unnamed Cave (TN), and chevrons, rayed ovals, and meandering lines occur there and in other caves. In the Archaic and Woodland periods, cave decoration is less clearly linked stylistically to artifacts found outside caves, and the meanings of the images are difficult to infer without such clear stylistic associations. Moreover, the contextual associations of the art are quite variable and often enigmatic. As already noted, petroglyphs in 3rd Unnamed Cave were engraved into the ceiling of a chert mining chamber located over 1 km from the cave's mouth, but this is not the only unusual context for southeastern cave art. In 5th Unnamed Cave in the plateau region of Middle Tennessee, petroglyphs are associated with cave burials and a Woodland 14C determination. Burials were scattered in a manner suggesting deposition through a pit entrance above the main chamber. In the same chamber, just above the human remains, a box-like figure with arms and legs and an oval with parallel transverse fill lines (we call it a "toothy mouth"; an example is illustrated in Figure 4) were engraved into the cave wall. In another nearby pit, 6th Unnamed Cave, human remains are associated with both Woodland and Mississippian age determinations; there, a series of four human heads were engraved onto the burial chamber wall. Two of the faces have "weeping eyes," and all four may represent severed heads; these traits are characteristic of Mississippian iconography. But the "toothy mouth" observed in 5th Unnamed Cave is also present. Given their context, the symbolic content of these face effigies may differ from icons found in other, nonmortuary situations, and there may be some time depth to this specialized iconography. At 11th Unnamed Cave, Mississippian dates are associated with pictographs, mud glyphs, and complex panels of petroglyphs; in fact, this is the only site where all three media are present. The level of prehistoric activity in the cave was high, as impressive quantities of torch stoke marks and cane charcoal blanket the cave floor and walls. The charcoal layer is very thin, however, lying directly on sterile clay. The clay is homogeneous and fine grained, and it was mined wherever large chunks could be removed using hands and digging sticks. It was apparently transported out of the cave for use in ceramic production or other less obvious activities. Here we have Mississippian cave art in a mining context. The toothy mouth is present here, in both a petroglyph (Figure 4) and a pictograph. Clearly, this image must have had various references, since it appears in two very distinct contexts and with very different associations. Still another aspect of</page><page sequence="13">Issues in the Study of Southeastern Prehistoric Cave Art 245 11th Unnamed Cave's image assemblage suggests caution in iconographie interpretation. Woodpeckers are an important element in Mississippian iconography. With only a few exceptions, however, woodpeckers on portable ritual items are shown by just their heads or are perched at rest (see examples in Brain and Phillips 1996). In 11th Unnamed Cave, a pictograph and petroglyphs show woodpeckers in flight (Figure 5). Flying bird images also have been observed in 7th and 12th Unnamed Caves in Tennessee. When similar subject matter was depicted distinctively differently outside vs. inside caves, can the same interpretation be warranted? Right now, we are limited in how much we can know about the meanings of the earliest cave art. In the Mississippian period, the cultural context is better known for iconography in general, but as just noted, specific images found in</page><page sequence="14">246 Jan F. Simek and Alan Cressler Figure 5. Prehistoric petroglyph from 11th Unnamed Cave, Tennessee, showing two woodpeckers in flight. caves diverge from icons on portable media and the material contexts can be quite distinctive. It is risky at best, and potentially misleading, to suggest ernie meanings even for Mississippian cave decorations. Nevertheless, it can be observed that cave art in the Southeast is quite ancient, functioned in complex ways within the lives of its makers, and may have varied over time in its role within prehistoric societies. Conservation Threats to southeastern prehistoric cave art posed by modern people are perhaps our most serious concern at present. The need to protect these historical resources for the future is urgent. Almost every site we have visited recently contains modern graffiti, including engravings and paintings on cave walls. In some cases, these modern inscriptions overlie and destroy prehistoric images. While we hope this is inadvertent destruction, done by persons who are unaware of the ancient work they deface, innocence cannot always be assumed. Almost as soon as a new site is discovered, it becomes the object of curiosity and, sometimes, resentment by those who (rightly or wrongly) think caves might be closed to their use if the cave art requires protection.

Unless we can preserve these sites from vandalism, the Southeast's prehistoric cave art tradition, so long unknown to the scientific world, will disappear from view as completely as though it had never been discovered. As noted earlier, we no longer use common cave names for the sites, substituting numbers (1st Unnamed, 2nd Unnamed, etc.) for traditional appellations. We also try to arrange gating for the most endangered sites, but this requires owner commitment and funding. The Tennessee Valley Authority, Tennessee Division of Archaeology, Nature Conservancy, Archaeological Conservancy, Southeast Cave Conservancy, and a few enlightened site owners hold preservation and protection as high priorities. Resources for ensuring protection, especially on private lands, and cooperation from the cave-using public remain problematic in many specific cases. Conclusions Studies of southeastern prehistoric cave art are in their infancy. More sites are discovered every year, and each new discovery leads to new syntheses and inter pretations. We know that cave decoration in the Southeast is ancient and that there is a long tradition of continuity in execution and imagery. We are also beginning to discern changes over time that might reflect the evolution of artistic tradition from its origins among Archaic hunter-gatherers to its use within a com plex religious system shared by Mississippian peoples over a large part of the Southeast. As was noted earlier, however, it seems highly unlikely that this cor pus represents a unitary phenomenon, given the chronological, technological, and contextual variation that it entails. There is no warrant for uncritical ethno graphic interpretation of even Mississippian cave imagery, for there is much variability in context that must be considered. In this article, we have tried to outline some of the problems and issues we confront in our studies of cave art in the Appalachian karst region. These range from rather simple logistical challenges to far more difficult interpretive compli cations. Our work is new and expanding at a rapid rate, so our solutions are surely immediate and probably temporary. We hope that this work will stimulate other archaeologists to initiate intensive work on this important, emerging body of prehistoric cultural data in the Southeast. Through wider participation, meth ods and techniques of study and integration will certainly evolve along with our understanding of the role in southeastern prehistory played by caves and the images produced inside them.

We use the term "art" here in a general sense of visual imagery with symbolic meaning. We are well aware that Paleolithic peoples and/or Native Americans may have had no, or very different, definitions than we do today of what constitues "art," how meaning is attributed to images, and the relation of visual expression to concepts like "creativity." Still, the word is embedded in our literature and can, we believe, serve as a useful if generic term. References Bahn, P. G. 1998 Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art.
