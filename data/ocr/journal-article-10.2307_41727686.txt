It situates al-Ràzïs methodology with respect to the Mutazila and falsafa , two trends that greatly influenced al-Râzï. It proposes that al-Ràzï, who is generally consi- dered the leading Sunn! theologian and exegete after the death of al-Gazàlï, adopted methods and ideas from the Mutazila and that he effectively synthesized these with Avicennian philoso- phy to forge an orginal methodology.

Cette approche permet de situer la démarche d'al-Râzï au regard des Mutazilites et de la falsafa , deux courants qui ont grandement influencé al-Ràzï. Nous proposons la thèse selon laquelle al-Ràzï - qui est généralement considéré comme le théologien et exégète sunnite majeur après la mort d'al-Gazâlï - adopta des méthodes et des idées propres aux Mutazilites et qu'il les synthétisa dans les faits avec la philosophie avicennienne afin de forger une procédure originale. Mots clés tafiir, ta wily as arite, mu tazilite, mutasâbih Introduction This chapter challenges a widely shared assumption about al-Rãzí (606/1210), the leading theologian and exegete in the post-classical period of Islam (ca. 1 100-1900). The vast majority of secondary literature on al-Riz! in Euro- pean languages classifies al-Râzî as an As arite. This is understandable, given that al-Râzî falls within the genealogical tradition of Asarism, and the 1 I am thankful to Professors Nicholas Heer and Suleiman Mourad for our conversations about the Mutazila, and to two anonymous friends for their comments on earlier drafts of this paper. © Koninklijkc Brill NV, Leiden, 2012 DOI: 10.1 163/157005812X618943</page><page sequence="2">T. Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 5 1 1 bio-bibliographers of medieval Islam trace al-Râzîs intellectual pedigree to al-As ari (324/935) himself. To say that al-Rází is an As arite, however, over- looks the extent to which he was influenced by the highly unorthodox views of the Mu'tazila, who after being branded as heretics in Baghdad, migrated east and settled in Central Asia. Al-Râzïs considerable debt to the Mu' tazila, and the extent to which he incorporated crucial Mu tazilite methods into his theology, goes almost completely unacknowledged in most of the Western literature on Islamic religious thought. Only Goldziher (1912) seems to have noted al-Râzï s debt to the Mu'tazila.2 The absence of scholarly investigations into Mu'tazilite influence on al-RãzI is all the more surprising given that Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1327) - the great polemicist and perspicacious reader of Islamic theology - recognized this influence and marked it as pivotal in the history of Islamic thought.3 This article proposes that the basic outlook of al-Râzïs methodology is strongly Mutazilite. To illustrate this I examine one fundamental aspect of al-Râzï s thought that points to his adoption of Mu tazilite methodology and his rejection of classical As arite thought, namely the authoritative role he assigns to reason as a source of religious knowledge. While the Mu'tazila argued for the free and unrestricted use of human reasoning and considered it the primary source of religious knowledge, many As arite theologians from al-As ari through al-Gazâlï (d. 505/1 111) insisted on the limited function of reason as a source of religious knowledge. Indeed in the view of classical As arism, the Qur an and Sunna constituted sources of religious knowledge that were authoritative and functioned as the ultimate arbiters of theological questions. 2 None of the following works addresses the Mu' tazilite influence on al-RãzIs methodology, and none argues that the fundamental outlook of al-Râzï s methodology is strongly Mu' tazilite: G.C.

Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 In this article, I argue that al-Râzï assigns an authoritative role to human reasoning as a source of religious knowledge. By doing so, he rejects the idea that the Qur ân and Sunna constitute sources of religious knowledge that must be uncritically followed and strictly adhered to - a salient feature of clas- sical As arism. Indeed what al-Râzï did was to rearrange the sources of reli- gious knowledge along Mu' tazilite lines with human reasoning as its leading source and to limit the weight of the Qur an and Sunna as source of religious knowledge and arbiters of theological questions. By ranking these sources along Mu tazilite lines, al-Râzï developed As arism into a trend that continued to view and use the Qur an and Sunna as sources of knowledge but rejected the idea that they were the ultimate arbiters of theological issues. This metho- dology - the priority of reason - became a fundamental methodological cha- racteristic of Islamic theological orthodoxy that flourished in post-classical Islam.4 Al-Râzï's Engagement with the Mu'tazila Al-Râzï initially encountered the Mu'tazila as a young man, and he remained preoccupied with them until his death. The bio-bibliographical sources, which provide some crucial details about al-Ràzïs life and the patronage that he received, indicate that al-Râzï initially encountered the Mu'tazila in Khwa- razm before he traveled to Transoxiana, and that his debates with the Mu'tazila led to his exile from the region.5 Khwarazm had recently witnessed a revival of Mu'tazilite theology, and the prominence of Mu' tazilite material in al-Ràzïs work is partially due to his setting in life and his oral debates with the Mu'tazila.6 4 That the priority of reason was a fundamental characteristic of al-Ràzïs methodology is pointed out by Ibn Taymiyya, al-Râzï s greatest opponent. See Ibn Taymiyya, Dar tdârud al-aql wa-l-naqU ed. M.R. Salim, Riyadh, Gàmiat al-imäm Muhammad b.

Jaffer I Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 5 1 3 Hiere is plenty of evidence that the Mu* tazila should be counted among al-Râzï s chief opponents, and I do not wish to bring this into question. Here are just a few examples that illustrate this. The Mutazila feature as al-Râzïs opponents in the Muhassal , in which al-Râzï opposed the Mu tazila on the following theological topics:7 the nature of God s Attributes8; vision of God in the next world;9 the return of the non-existent;10 spontaneous generation;11 prophetic immunity from error and sin;12 the promise and the threat.13 The Mu' tazila also feature as al-Râzïs opponents in his Mafãtih al-gayb ("the Keys to the Unseen"). Al-Râzïs debates with the Mu'tazila are woven into the fabric of his commentary, and in many of these al-Râzï argues against the Mutazila.14 On the question whether Gods word is created or uncreated, for example, al-Râzï opposes the Mutazilite doctrine that Gods word is not Gods direct speech but "created speech" that consists of "arranged letters and sounds." He took the more orthodox position that God s word is an eternal attribute sub- sisting in Gods essence.15 In his autobiographical account of his debates in Transoxiana, al-Râzï rejects the Mutazilite position that God could not be seen in the next world, adopting the As'arite position on the authority of scripture that God will be seen in the next world.16 What I do wish to bring into question is al-Râzï s debt to Mutazilite metho- dology. To illustrate this I examine al-Râzï s adoption of Mutazilite theologi- cal assumptions and interpretive methods. I focus on al-Râzïs adoption of Mu'tazilite tawil - the figurative interpretation to Qur anic verses and pro- phetic reports. Given that this issue (which I call the ta'wil-issue) developed out of theological reflection about Gods nature, some remarks about how the controversy concerning scriptural interpretation is tied to theological reflec- tion will be appropriate. 7 The full title of the work is Muhassal Afkàr al-mutaqaddimìn wa-l-muta ahhirïn min al- ulama wa-l-mutakallimïn.

Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 Muslim theologians of all stripes shared the assumption that God is unlike His creation and that the attributes of created being cannot be ascribed to God, since to do so would render Him contingent. The problem they faced, however, was that the canonical sources - the Qur an and Sunna - are stron- gly anthropomorphic and seem to indicate that God resembles His contingent creation.17 The Quran and Sunna speak of Gods "hand" or "hands," Gods "descent," God s "being above," His "coming" and "going," and His sitting on the Throne. These descriptions were considered "problematic," since they see- med to indicate that God is in a direction or location and that God resembles a manlike corporeal entity. The principle of likening God to His contingent creation was called tašbih. Falling into tašbih was considered a theological error, and in some controversies the principle was considered a litmus test for heresy.18 The problem they faced can be formulated in the frame of a question: How can one maintain the reality of the anthropomorphic descriptions of God without falling into tašbih and thereby compromising the core theologi- cal principle that God is unlike His contingent creation? The scriptural controversy concerning tawil developed out of this theologi- cal reflection about tasbih- problem. The root of the controversy concerned the weighting of the sources of religious knowledge. Traditionalists, who recogni- zed only the Qur an and Sunna as canonical and authoritative sources, argued that one is obliged to adhere strictly to the apparent sense of the Qur an and Sunna on the grounds that God has revealed Himself using these names and attributes. According to this doctrine, one is obliged to accept such attributes "as they really are" by leaving them in their apparent sense. The Mutazila, who claimed to use only human reasoning as the source of religious knowledge, argued that such verses and reports (when taken in their apparent sense) do not befit God, and that accordingly, one must apply tawil - that is, interpret the phrases figuratively. The Opponents of Mu tazilite Tawil Al-Râzïs debt to Mutazilite methodology is especially conspicuous in Àsãs al-taqdis ,19 This work is devoted entirely to the tawil-issue - the question 17 Van Ess, "Tashbïh wa-tanzlh," EI2. 18 See for example Ibn Qudäma (d. 620/1223), Censure of Speculative Theology , ed. and trans.

Al-Râzï dedicated this work to the brother of Saladin, al-Mãlik al-'Àdil Sayf ai-Din Abù Bakr b. Ayyùb (596/1 199-615/1218). He composed this work in the new period of</page><page sequence="6">T. Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 5 1 5 whether it is permissible to interpret the Qur ãn and prophetic reports figura- tively by diverting their apparent sense to the nonapparent or figurative sense. What al-Râzï does in this treatise is to adopt the Mutazilite conception of tawïl (and its underlying theological assumptions) to counter his Traditiona- list Hanbalite opponents who opposed the use of tawïl. Because al-RãzIs adoption of Mu'tazilite tawïl is a response to Islamic traditionalism, and to what he considered its flawed methodology, it will be appropriate to say some- thing about this methodology. Traditionalist methodology approached the tasbïh- problem with two assumptions. The first is that God revealed Himself to mankind using the names and attributes expressed in the Quran and Sunna; the second is that only the Qurãn and Sunna (and not human reasoning) constitute sources of religious knowledge, and that only these sources provide knowledge of Gods being and attributes. Accordingly, one is obliged to affirm the names and attri- butes of God and to leave them "as they are" by not diverting them from their apparent sense to a figurative sense through the application of ta'wïl. Like other theologians, however, Traditionalists were committed to avoi- ding tasbïh - likening God to His creation. They approached this issue by postulating that although the anthropomorphic descriptions of God are real, they are beyond the ken of the imagination and intellect. They thus bear no likeness to created attributes. For example, the Hanbalites affirm a face and hand of God "in a different sense to that which it is established of creation." Addressing the Hanbalite approach to the problematic verses, al-Rãzí states: The mainstay of the Hanbalites way is that whenever they hold fast to a Quranic verse or prophetic report, the apparent sense which suggests something of organs and limbs [of some kind], they explicitly declare that "we affirm this meaning of God the exalted in a different sense to that which it is established for creation." Thus, they affirm of God the exalted a Face different from the faces of creatures, and a Hand different from the hands of creatures. Yet, it is known that the Hand and the Face, with the meanings they have mentioned, are such as the imagina- tion and conjecture cannot accept. So, if it is reasonable to affirm that, [in a manner] different from conjecture and imagination, then what farfetchedness is there in the statement that God the exalted exists, and is neither in the world nor outside the world, even though conjecture and imagination fall short of fatho- ming this existence.20 his career between 1 199 and 1210 while he was in Ghazna (ca. 602/1205), or possibly in Herat, a few years before he died and called it "a brilliant gem and a pleasing gift." According to HãggI Hallfas Kašf al- zunün, the correct title of the work is Ta sis al-taqdis. Al-Rãzí, too, refers to the work as Ta sis al-taqdis in his own works; al-Râzï, Mafätih al-gayby XXI, p. 7. 20 Al-Rãzí, Ta' sis al-taqdis , p. 9-10; I am grateful to my colleague S. Laher for bringing this passage to my attention and for our conversations about al-Rãzí and Ibn Taymiyya.</page><page sequence="7">516 T. Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 The Hanbalite position posits that the anthropomorphic verses and reports are indeed real. It is thus true to say that God has a Hand and Face, just as it is true that He is "above" and the He is "sitting on the Throne." But since, in their view, Gods essence differs from the essences of sensory things, when one affirms these descriptions of God one is not affirming an attribute of created entities to God and one is not falling into tašbih. Consequently, according to this group, it is not necessary to apply tawil to the anthropomorphic descrip- tions of God since when one affirms such verses or reports of God one is not, according to this view, affirming a created attribute of God. To counter his opponents' view on tawil al-Râzï adopts a strategy that aims to establish the necessity of tawil. This strategy is reflected in these sections of the text: (1) The Evidences that God Transcendent is above corporeality and spatial location; (2) On the [Metaphorical] Interpretation of the "ambiguous" (mutašábihát) Qur anic verses and prophetic reports (Prologue and 32 sec- tions); (3) An Account of the way of the Pious Ancestors; (4) Remaining Issues. The Mu' tazilite imprint on al-Râzï s methodology is clear from the contents of the work. Section (1) argues for the Mu tazilite position that God is "above corporeality and spatial location" - that God is not in a direction or a space- occupying entity.21 Here al-Râzï advances "proofs" based on textual evidence and rational evidence that God cannot be pointed to the senses, since He is neither "here" nor "there" and thus not in a direction or location. Section (2) is also strongly Mu tazilite. It argues that the apparent sense of the anthropo- morphic verses and reports does not befit God, and that as a result, the appa- rent sense cannot be the intended meaning of scripture and that it must be interpreted figuratively through the application of tawil.11 Al-Räzi's Critique of Classical As arism Al-Râzï s borrowing of Mu'tazilite assumptions and interpretive methods also set him at odds with classical As'arism. The major trend among al-Ràzïs pre- decessors and colleagues within As arism viewed the Qur an and Sunna as the leading, most important authoritative sources of religious knowledge on the tawil-issucj disallowing the use of human reasoning when it came to interpre- ting the anthropomorphic attributes. Al-Râzï flatly rejected this idea. He rear- ranged the authority of these sources by assigning more weight to human reasoning and by positioning human reasoning as the arbiter of the tawil-issue. 21 Al-Râzï, Ta' s ïs al-taqdïs, p. 16-45. 22 Ibid., p. 79-173.</page><page sequence="8">T. Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 5 1 7 By doing so, he rejected a salient feature of As arism - the idea that one is obliged to follow scriptural authority - the Qurãn and Sunna - and not use human reasoning to interpret the anthropomorphic descriptions expressed in the canonical sources. He replaced this with the free and unrestricted use of human reasoning, a salient characteristic of Mutazilism.23 Before turning to al-Ràzï s borrowing of Mu'tazilite assumptions and inter- pretive methods it will be appropriate to describe the As'arite methodology that al-Ràzï critiques. Like Traditionalists and the Mutazila, the As ari tes faced the problem of tasbih, and their interpretive method developed out of this problem: How can one maintain the reality of Gods names and attributes such as "being above" and "He ascended the Throne" without falling into tasbih - that is, without ascribing the attributes of created being (contiguity, movement, direction, etc.) to Him? The major trend within As arism approached the tasbih- problem on the basis of several assumptions. The most important of these concerns the autho- rity they invested in the Qur an and Sunna as divinely revealed sources. Accor- ding to this view, God has described Himself in the Qur an and Sunna using names and attributes, including "Hand" (or "Hands"), for example. Because these names and attributes are divinely revealed, only these sources, namely the Qurãn and Sunna, can sanction their interpretation. What this meant, in effect, is that it is obligatory to accept the way that God described Himself by ascribing these selfsame names and attributes to Him and not applying tawil , which is an interpretive method based on human reasoning. This view is expressed by al-Qušayrl (d. 465/1072), who represents a major trend in As arism: We do not call God (He is Mighty and Glorious) by any name by which He has not called Himself. We believe in all the adjectives and nouns that are mentioned in describing Him. In this we follow the divine guidance found in the Scripture, the sunna, and the consensus of the community. We do not, in any case of naming [Him], follow what is appropriate for Him [simply] on the basis of inferential reasoning or from the standpoint of lexicography and grammar.24 In the above al-Qušayri addresses the four sources of religious knowledge in As'arism: the Qurãn, the Sunna, the consensus of the scholarly community, 23 That the rejection of the uncritical acceptance of authority became a salient feature of late Islamic theology is pointed out by Sabra in "Science and Philosophy in Medieval Islamic Theo- logy: The Evidence of the Fourteenth Century," Zeitschrift fiir Geschichte der Arabisch-Islamischen Wissenschaften , 9 (1994), p. 1-42. 24 R.M. Frank, "Two Short Dogmatic Works of Abu 1-Qãsim al-Qushayri," MIDEO, 15 (1982), p. 68 (pt. 1).</page><page sequence="9">518 T. Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 and human reasoning. He also defines the salient characteristic of the As arite position. The Qur an and Sunna are the authoritative sources of guidance on the ta wïl-issuey and given that God has described Himself using names and attributes, one is obliged to accept the reality of these attributes. This entails, for example, affirming "ascension" and "movement" and "hand" (or "hands") of Him and not substituting in figurative meanings, say by pointing to other instances in scripture or in the Arabic language more generally where these expressions are used figuratively. Classical As'arites thus posited that the anthropomorphic names and attri- butes are real rather than figurative. By this, they meant that expressions such as "being above" and "He ascended the Throne" are true descriptions of God that name Him and tell us what He is really like. Such attributes are, more- over, distinct - they are not reducible to any of the other attributes, say "living" or "knowing," that are established through human reasoning. The reality of the names and attributes became a theological postulate in classical As arism. Classical As'arites resolved the problem of tasbih ("likening God to His creation") by positing that God had a singular nature. According to this theory, Gods essence differs from that of sensory beings. Thus while it is true to say that God does have a body, they claim, His body is unlike bodies that can be perceived by the five senses. This idea was linked to the scriptural verse, "There is nothing Like Him [God]," (Kor 42, 11) and it was expressed theologically in the formula that God cannot be captured by the imagination or intellect.25 In classical As'arism the interpretive method flowed from this theological postulate. The As arites argued that because God s essence is different from the essence of sensory beings the apparent sense of scripture cannot be scriptures intended meaning. That is, while certain verses and reports may seem to indi- cate direction or location on God s part, this is not the intended meaning and such descriptions are not to be read literally. Accordingly, when one ascribes "ascent" to God in the expression, "And He [God] ascended the Throne" or "And the Merciful ascended the Throne" one is not affirming spatial motion of God. Similarly, when one ascribes "ascension" to God in the expression, "And He ascended the Throne," one is not affirming "ascension" of God in the same way that one would affirm "ascension" of created entities. That al-As ari himself insisted that spatial motion is not the intended meaning of verses and reports is expressed in the following: 25 Al-Qusayri, Risàia , trans. A.D. Knysh, UK, Garnet Publishing, 2007, p. 6-7.</page><page sequence="10">T. Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 5 1 9 [Hie Muslims] are agreed that God will come on the day of resurrection ... as He has said. It is not, however, a going or a movement or a leaving. A going is a movement and a leaving only when that which goes is a body or atom and since it is certain that He (the Mighty, the Glorious) is neither a body nor an atom, His going must not be a local transference or a movement. Note that when they say, "the fever came to Zayd," they do not mean that it was transferred to him or that it has moved from a place in which it had been, since it is neither a body or an atom; its coming to him is simply its existence in him. Nor is God s "descending" a transference, since He is neither a body nor an atom.26 The above passage expresses some of the theological assumptions and aspects of the interpretive method that became characteristic of classical As arism. It assumes that the Qur ãn and Sunna are the leading authoritative sources of religious knowledge and that these sources govern the interpretation of the anthropomorphic descriptions of God. Following the lead of these sources meant, in effect, adhering to the apparent sense of such descriptions. Al-Asan also expresses the idea that nothing characteristic of created beings is the intended meaning of the problematic descriptions. For example, the intended meaning of the description, "going," is not a spatial movement. Similarly, the intended meaning of the description, "descending," is not a spatial movement. In the above passage, it is also significant that according to classical As arite doctrine, human beings cannot attain precise knowledge of the names and attributes. That is, although the canonical sources - the Qur an and Sunna - indicate that the attributes are real (and not figurative) expressions, and that they must be taken in their apparent sense, their precise meaning is known only to God, and accordingly, it must be "entrusted to God," to use al-Qusayrï s expression.27 The attributes were thus often said to be real bï-lâ kayfa - "without knowing how." This epistemic stance is rejected by al-Ràzï in his turn towards Mu'tazilite theology. Let me now address the conception of tdwil that al-Ràzï introduces into (what I call) the "New As arism" or "Neo-As arism" and which became characteristic of Islamic theological orthodoxy.28 Al-Râzï s conception of tawïl betrays char- acteristics that are strongly Mutazilite. This is evinced in the epistemic 26 R.M. Franck, "Elements in the Development of the Teaching of al-Ash ari," Le muséon , 98 (1985), p. 160; al-Ašari, al-Tagr , ed.

Jaffer I Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 framework of al-Râzïs tawïl, the theological assumptions of this framework and its interpretive method. These aspects, taken as a whole, indicate that al-Râzï formally repudiated a salient characteristic of classical As arism, namely that the Qurãn and Sunna - the canonical textual sources - constituted the leading and authoritative sources of religious knowledge. The epistemic framework of al-Râzï s conception of tawïl considers human reasoning an autonomous source of religious knowledge. That is, human reasoning does not need the guidance of the Qurãn and Sunna to attain reli- gious knowledge but is fully capable of attaining such knowledge indepen- dently of them. This framework is borne out by al-Râzïs approach to the tašbih- problem in part one of Ta sis al-taqdis, which deals with "the evidences that God is above corporeality and spatial location." Here al-Râzï flatly rejects the classical As arite epistemic framework that grounds knowledge of God in strict adherence to the Qur an and Sunna and accordingly insists on the accep- tance of the reality, i.e. apparent sense, of the attributes. In opposition to this stance al-Râzï uses human reasoning to demonstrate that God is not in a direc- tion or location. Many of the proofs he advances follow a line of reasoning that is characteristic of the Mutazila: Affirming the apparent sense of [God s] "being above," [Gods] "ascending the Throne," etc. implies the affirmation of direction or location of God and compromise God s unity by likening Him to His contingent creation. The theological assumptions and interpretive method of al-Ràzïs concep- tion of tawïl are also strongly Mutazilite. These are evinced in part two of Ta sis al-taqdis , which deals with the "metaphorical interpretation of the ambi- guous ( mutalãbihãt ) expressions of the Prophetic Reports and Quranic verses."29 Here al-Râzï adopts an assumption characteristic of Mu'tazilism, namely that there can be no conflict between what human reasoning imparts about God, on one hand, and what scripture - the Qur an and Sunna - impart about God on the other. By doing so, he continued the Mu tazilite trend that aimed to harmonize reason and divine revelation. According to this postulate, God is knowable through human reasoning. Gods being and attributes are discoverable through human reasoning, and what is expressed in scripture - including the anthropomorphic descriptions such as Gods "being above," "hand" or "hands," and His "ascending the Throne" - conform to the human conception of reasoning. They must simply be "demythologized" through the proper use of reason, and tawïl is one the functions of reason. In al-Râzïs thought, the application of tawïl follows as a corollary of this theological assumption. The gist of his reasoning concerning tawïl runs as follows: (a) If the apparent sense of scripture is incongruous with the theolo- 29 Al-Rãzí, Ta* sis al-taqdis y p. 79-173.</page><page sequence="12">T. Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 52 1 gical precepts that human reasoning establishes through rational evidence (for example, that God is not in a direction or location), the apparent sense of scripture is categorized as an impossibility; (b) Because scripture must conform to what human reasoning establishes, the intended sense of scripture cannot be a rational impossibility, and the intended sense of such descriptions must be their nonapparent sense; (c) Therefore it is incumbent on the exegete to divert the apparent sense of the anthropomorphic descriptions to a nonapparent - figurative or allegorical - sense; otherwise there would be a direct conflict between what reason establishes and what scripture imparts.30 I call attention to two examples that illustrate al-RâzI s conception of ta wil. The first comes from al-Râzï s discussion of the Qur anic expression, "And He [God] ascended the Throne" and [God s] "being above," an expression referred to in Hadit literature.31 Al-Râzï states: The tenth argument is that decisive rational evidence that we mentioned above shows the falsity of God s being specified by any one of the directions. Once this is established, it is obvious that what is meant by "He ascended the Throne" is not "being established [sc. sitting in the manner of movement on Gods part]," so it follows necessarily that the verse means "to become master of" or "to take posses- sion of."32 The second issue that they mentioned is that it is necessary to adhere to the Quranic verses that mention [God s] "being above." [Our] response to this is that the expression "being above" means [Gods] high rank and power. The intended meaning of "being above" in these verses is [God s] dominance and power. If the term "above" carries the meaning of above in direction and above in rank, then why do you take it to mean above in direction? We have already made clear that what is meant by the ascension is "to become master of" or "to take possession of" or "to have power over," and we have made clear that the evidence of that is in language and poetry, and we have made clear that the doctrine (qawl)&gt; if this is equivocal, and al-istiwa is that which is with the meaning of al-intisãb , it is necessary to take this meaning, because reason has judged it, insofar as it provides evidence that God is eternal. Were he a body, it would be possible for him to be in a location, then he would be temporally originated.33 30 The principle is noted by al-Râzïs greatest opponent - Ibn Taymiyya, who uses places it prominently in his extremely lengthy refutation of al-Râzïs methodology. See Ibn Taymiyya, Dar' ta ârud al- aql wa-l-naqU passim. On this subject, see N. Heer, "The Priority of Reason in the Interpretation of Scripture: Ibn Taymiyah and the Mutakallimun," in Literary Heritage of Classical Islam. Arabic and Islamic Studies in Honor of James A.

Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 In the above al-Râzï establishes his interpretation of the anthropomorphic descriptions ( mutcããbihãt ) on the foundation of Mutazilite theological pre- cepts. These precepts are that God is "not specified by any one of the direc- tions." By this, al-Râzï means that God cannot be pointed to by the senses, since He is neither "here" nor "there."34 Once these precepts have been esta- blished on the basis of human reasoning, the problematic descriptions that seem to indicate that God is in a direction or location are categorized by al-Râzï as impossibilities. These precepts, having been established by "decisive rational evidence," supply the foundation for al-Râzïs interpretive method. Al-Rãzí thus inter- prets the Qur anic expression, "And He ascended the Throne," along Mu'tazilite lines. For example, the apparent sense of the Qur anic expression, "And He ascended the Throne," is "sitting." For al-Râzï, this is an impossibility esta- blished through "decisive rational evidence": If God were sitting on the Throne, then one part of God would occupy the right side of the Throne and another the left side of the Throne. But if so, God would be composite, and this is impossible. Consequently the intended meaning of "And He ascended the Throne" is not the apparent sense but the figurative sense - "to become master of or "to take possession of." The same goes for the expression, "being above." The intended meaning of this expression is not that God is in one of the six directions, namely "above," since such an interpretation would conflict with what has been established through rational evidence, namely that God is not in a direction or location. Accordingly, al-Râzï interprets this expression figuratively along Mu'tazilite lines to mean "dominance" and "power." I call attention to a second example that illustrates al-Râzïs conception of ta uni. Al-Râzï s exegesis of the Quränic expression, "My two hands" (Kor 38, 75), exemplifies al-Râzïs strongly Mu tazilite assumptions and methods. The Qur'ânic verse in which this expression occurs refers to Adams preeminence over other human beings - only Adam is created with God s two hands. The passage, like the passage above, assumes that human reasoning is the suitable source to attain religious knowledge about God and the arbiter of the meaning of the problematic descriptions. In the following al-Râzï applies ta'wil - figurative interpretation - to the Qur anic expression, "My two hands": we have made clear that [Adams] being created with [Gods] two hands is an expression for a special mode of creation with a superabundance of esteem (al-karamãt) and honor (, al-tasrif ), and that God used these modes exclusively in Adams creation.35 34 Al-Râzï, Ta' s ïs al-taqdïs, p. 45ff. 35 Ibid., p. 129.</page><page sequence="14">T. Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 523 In the above al-Râzï rejects the idea that the Qur anic expression, "My two hands," names a real attribute, i.e. that scripture must be taken at its apparent sense. Most classical As ari tes took the idea of Adam s preeminence as evidence that "hand" or "hands" names two attributes that subsist in Gods essence. They argued that Adam is created through a special mode or act in which God bestows honor on Adam (&lt; al-takrim ) and singles him out by specially selecting him C al-istifa ).36 Others take it to refer to power (qudra) as a real attribute. In the above al-Râzï rejects this stance, interpreting the verse figuratively along Mu'tazilite lines to refer to "a superabundance of esteem and honor." Upgrading the Mu tazilite Interpretive Method Al-Rãzls turn towards Mu'tazilite lines of thinking and his rejection of classi- cal As arite methodology is complex and multifaceted, and the above discus- sion illustrates only one aspect of this complex turn. The following section focuses on an alternative aspect of this turn, namely the philosophical elements that al-Râzï introduces into Mu'tazilite tawil. In what is to follow I propose that although al-Râzï upgraded and modernized Mu tazilite tawil by groun- ding it in Avicennian philosophical resources - resources that formed part of the Greek philosophical heritage and were later developed and refined by phi- losophical minds in medieval Islam. The new conception of tawil that al-Râzï developed, and which became a salient characteristic of (what I call) the "New As arism" or "Neo-Asarism," was a product of al-Râzï s project that aimed to transfer philosophical concepts and methods across disciplinary boundaries (I call this his transfer of methods project , although al-Râzï himself does not describe his theological agenda using these terms.) This project, which al-Râzï founded and engineered, succeeded in importing philosophical concepts and methods into Quranic exegesis ( tafiir ), sometimes directly and at other times through the intermediary of Islamic theology ( kalãm ). As I shall illustrate, it was through this transfer of methods project that al-Râzï raised As'arism to higher philosophical standards. Moreover, it was through this project that al-Râzï introduced, for the first time in the history of tafiir , formal and systematic rules that grounded the interpre- tation of the Qur an and Sunna in philosophical concepts and principles. This project was the first substantial attempt by a Muslim intellectual to reconfigure tafiir by making effective use of Aristotelian-Avicennian philoso- phy. It made a major contribution to the grand project through which Muslim 36 Al-Râzï, Ta' sis al-taqdïs, p. 127.</page><page sequence="15">524 T. Jaffer / Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 intellectuals, educated in religious learning, consolidated religious bodies of knowledge with philosophical and scientific learning. Although there were many religious thinkers working within the division of falsafa into kalãm and who reconfigured Islamic theology along philosophical lines - al-Âmidï (d. 631/1233), al-Baydâwï (d. 685/1286), al-Igï (d. 756/1355), al-Taftazànï (d. 792/1390), al-čurgání (d. 816/1413) and al-SanüsI (d. 892/1487) to name a few - it was al-Râzï who (within a single but voluminous Qur an com- mentary) reconfigured tafiir along philosophical lines. And while the project in kalãm began as early as al-čuwaynl (d. 478/ 1085), 37 tafiir was a latecomer to this process. It was not until the twelfth century that philosophical resour- ces were naturalized into Quranic exegesis, and it is al-Râzï who should be credited for founding and engineering this project. Al-Rãzfs effective use of philosophical resources in the Islamic tradition was almost entirely new. Al-Zamahšari (d. 538/1 1 44), al-Râzï s immediate Central Asian predecessor in the tafiir tradition, made no attempt to appropriate Avi- cennian philosophy and to naturalize it into tafiir - his contributions lie in the realm of philology, and philology was the main resource he used to exegete the Qur an.38 Al-Cazâlï, al-Rãzí s immediate predecessor within the theologi- cal tradition, contributed to the appropriation and naturalization process in theology and law. But he did not undertake such a project in tafiir. It was by picking up al-(Sazâlïs thread that al-Râzï started his project to transfer philo- sophical concepts and methods into tafiir. To upgrade and modernize Mutazilite tawil al-Râzï developed a new body of knowledge that he calls the science of interpretation (c ilm al-tawilãt ). This body of knowledge comprises formal and systematic rules that govern the interpretation of the canonical sources - the Qur an and Sunna. These rules are specifically designed to resolve the tawilAssue. They do so by supplying a criterion that sanctions the application of ta wily i.e. the operation of deviating the apparent to the nonapparent sense. 37 I have adopted the terms "appropriation" and "naturalization" from Sabras article, "The Appropriation and Subsequent Naturalization of Greek Science in Medieval Islam: A Prelimi- nary Statement," History of Science, 25 (1987), p. 223-43.

Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 525 The rules of al-Râzï s science of interpretation are predicated upon a classi- fication of verbal expressions.39 Al-Râzï introduces this classification in the context of discussions about ta ivi I in Mafãtih al-gayb and Ta sis al-taqdis .40 These discussions are thus crucial to al-Râzï s overall methodology, and it will be appropriate to begin with a translation of the key elements of his discus- sions. Al-RãzI states: Thus the result of this classification is that we hold that a verbal expression is either certain {nass), apparent ( zãhir ), nonapparent ( muawwal ), or muštarak (or mugmal). As for the certain and the apparent, the preponderance of the verbal expression is realized in both, except that the certain verbal expression preponde- rates preventing [the possibility of] other [meanings], while the apparent prepon- derates without preventing [the possibility of] other [meanings]. To the extent that they share this degree they are called clear ( muhkam ). As for general ( mugmal ) and nonapparent ( muawwal ), the [indication of the] verbal expressions evidence does not preponderate in these cases, but even though it does not preponderate in favor of it [the nonapparent] is not nonpreponderant ( marguh ). Now, the nonapparent in spite of not being preponderant, is less pre- ponderant not in accordance with a single evidence. To the extent that the share this degree they are called ambiguous ( mutasãbih)&gt; because the absence of unders- tanding arises in both divisions together.41 The classification system that al-RãzI devises in the above can be more easily grasped through the following. A verbal expression: 39 The starting points for al-Râzïs "science of interpretation" are Gazàlïan. On al-Gazàlïs science of interpretation, see I. Bello, The Medieval Islamic Controversy Between Philosophy and Orthodoxy , Leiden, E.J. Brill, 1989, p. 52-82. 40 Al-Ràzï, Mafitih al-gayb , VII, p. 180. See also the parallel passage in Ta sis al-taqdis , p. 179-80. 41 Al-Râzï, Mafitih al-gayb , VII, p. 180. See the parallel passage: "Thus the result of this clas- sification is that a verbal expression may be either certain {nass), apparent {zãhir), general {mugmal) y or nonapparent {muawwal). As for the certain and apparent, they both share in the realization of preponderation. Nonetheless the certain [verbal expression] preponderates by pre- venting conflict [with other meanings], while the apparent [verbal expression] preponderates without preventing conflict [with other meanings]. Thus the certain and apparent verbal expres- sions share in the occurrence of preponderances, and this rank is called clear {muhkam). As for the general {mugmal) and the nonapparent ( muawwal ), they share in common that [their] verbal indicant does not preponderate. Nonetheless the generals verbal expressions evidence does not preponderate. But while the general does not preponderate towards any of the two aspects, the nonapparent {muawwal) preponderates towards an aspect that is shared, and this is an absence of preponderance in relation to it, and this is called ambiguous {mutasãbih). Now, know that the verbal expression, if it [preponderates] equally in favor of two meanings, then here the mind hesitates, for example as in [. . .] Indeed the difficulty is that the expression preponde- rates with respect to one of the two concepts and is outweighed in the other, here the preponde- rant is false, and the less preponderant {marguh) is correct."

A. either has only one meaning, in which case it is certain ( nass ), and here there is no conflict since it is not susceptible to another meaning. This is an expression whose literal meaning is known with absolute certainty to be the intended meaning. Because there is no possibility that some other meaning is intended, there is no rule of preponderance in this case. Or B. it is suscep- tible to more than one meaning. If B. then, either II. A. its susceptibility to one of the two is greater, i.e. one [intended] meaning has preponderance over the another. If A. then that expression is called appa- rent ( zähir ) with respect to the preponderant meaning and nonapparent ( muawwal ) with respect to the nonpreponderant. So, in this case the appa- rent is preponderant and the nonapparent is preponderated. If B. then III. It is equally susceptible to both, and these meanings having equal preponde- rance. In this case the verbal expression with respect to them both is common {mustarak) and with respect to each specification is inclusive of more than one meaning ( mugmal ) intended by the speaker. The preponderant can be false and the nonpreponderant correct. In the above classification, verbal expressions signify meanings that they have been assigned primordially with the invention of language or that they have acquired by convention. These verbal expressions fall into one of four catego- ries: certain (nass), apparent (zähir) , nonapparent (muawwal), and general (mugmal). Such expressions are subject to susceptibility - they can signify one meaning or more in some cases and therefore give rise to multiple possibilities of interpretation. They are also subject to preponderance - they can, in the case of those that signify multiple meanings, be subject to rules of interpretation governed by various kinds of evidence. The practice of following the rules of preponderance enables one to properly interpret the canonical sources.42 A certain (nass) verbal expression has one meaning only, and it prepondera- tes towards its intended meaning. Such an expression is thus classified as "clear" ( muhkam ). In this case the rule of preponderance acts as a guide for the exegete, and one follows this rule when interpreting such expressions in the Qur an and Sunna. Because the rule of preponderance is available as a guide in this instance, the question of tawïl - whether one can divert the apparent to the nonapparent - does not arise. An apparent verbal expression (zähir) is susceptible to more than one mea- ning, but it preponderates towards one intended meaning. This intended mea- ning is the apparent or literal one that was assigned to it primordially with the invention of language or that it has acquired by convention.43 Here again in 42 The classification of verbal expressions and the science of preponderance is also utilized by Àmidi (d. 631/1233). See B. Weiss, The Search for Gods Law: Islamic Jurisprudence in the Writings ofSayfal-Din al-Amidi, Salt Lake City, University of Utah Press, 1992, p. 1 17-50. 43 Weiss, The Search for Gods Law , p. 472.</page><page sequence="18">T. Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 527 interpreting the verbal expression in the Qur an or Sunna one is guided by the rule of preponderance, and interpreting the expression in accordance with the preponderant meaning demands that the expression be classified as "clear" {muhkam) .44 In this case, there is no evidence that would require diverting the apparent to the nonapparent, so the question of tdwil - whether one should divert the apparent to the nonapparent-does not arise. A nonapparent (or figurative) verbal expression ( muawwal ) is susceptible to more than one meaning and gives rise to multiple possibilities of interpre- tation. In this case, in contrast to the apparent verbal expression C zãhir ), the verbal expression preponderates towards more than one meaning, not towards a single meaning.45 Here, however, because the verbal expression does not pre- ponderate towards the intended meaning, the mind is incapable of grasping the distinction between these possibilities of interpretation. Such an expres- sion is accordingly classified as "ambiguous" ( mutasãbih ), and it is here that the question of tdwil arises.46 A general ( mugmal ) is susceptible to two meanings and preponderates towards them both equally. Here the verbal expression is common ( mustarak ) to both. An example of this is the homonym. Hie Epistemologica! Criterion for Tdwil It is within the above template and its rules that al-Ràzï introduces philosophi- cal concepts to resolve the tdwïl-issue. These concepts and principles are imports that al-Rãzí transfers across disciplinary boundaries, i.e. from philoso- phy into the religious sciences. By using philosophical resources to resolve the tdwil-issue al-Rãzí continued a trend that earlier theologians, notably al-čuwayní and al-ûazâlï, had already started. These two figures, among others, appropriated epistemological concepts from the Aristotelian-Avicen- nian philosophical tradition and naturalized them into the religious sciences.47 But al-Rãzí went way beyond the contributions of earlier figures. He integra- ted philosophical concepts and principles into the religious sciences by making them cornerstones of his methodology, and he applied them systematically to the Qur an as he commented on it verse-by-verse, line-by-line, and word-by- word in his voluminous and magisterial Qur an commentary. 44 Al-Rãzí, Mafâtïh al-gayb, VII, p. 181; Ta sis al-taqdïs, p. 181. 45 Literally, "towards an aspect of what is common"; cf. al-Ràzï, Ta sis al-taqdïs, p. 1 80. 46 Al-Râzï, Mafâtïh al-iïayb, VII, p. 181; Ta sis al-taqdïs, p. 181. 47 See Sabra, "The Appropriation and Subsequent Naturalization of Greek Science in Medie- val Islam," p. 223-43; Wisnovsky, "The nature and scope of Arabic philosophical commentary in post-classical (ca. 1 100-1900 AD) Islamic intellectual history," p. 149-91.</page><page sequence="19">528 T. Jaffer / Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 In his attempt to resolve the tawïl-ïssue by using philosophical resources al-Râzï takes his starting point from his predecessors al-čuwayní and al-čazall. In drawing on philosophical resources both al-čuwayní and al-Cazâlï aimed to find a criterion for tawïl - evidence that would be strong enough to show the impossibility of the apparent sense of anthropomorphic scriptural verses and reports. For both figures, it is burhãn ("apodictic demonstration") that serves this function. Had these theologians been familiar with this concept and had they known of its use, they argued, they would have applied tawïl to the anthropomorphic verses and reports rather than adhering to their appa- rent sense and making real attributes out of them. Using this resource from Aristotelian-Avicennian philosophy, both al-čuwayní and al-čazáll argued that the scriptural references that seem to indicate that God is in a direction or location are rational impossibilities. For example, the Qur anic expressions, Gods "being above," and "He ascended the Throne," are rational impossibili- ties because burhãn points to the impossibility of their apparent senses. With this philosophical device, they argued, one had sufficiently strong evidence to apply tawïl - to divert the apparent sense of scripture to the nonapparent. This critique is conspicuous in al-Gazâlïs Qänün al-tawïl ("Principles of Exegesis").48 In this work al-Cazâlï lays out the methodology of five Muslim groups and characterizes each with respect to the weight they grant to reason or intellect Çaql) on one hand and the Qur an and Sunna ( naql ) on the other. Of these five, the most successful is able to unify reasoning and the religious textual tradition by discerning that there is no conflict between the two. Only this group is properly philosophically equipped to apply ta uñí. While group five goes unnamed and presumably refers to the Neo-As arites who are familiar with philosophical methods and concepts, al-čazáll s criticism of group four, I propose, is a critique of the classical As arite theologians. It denounces those who made real attributes out of "being above," "He ascended the Throne," and so forth by due to their failure to realize the rational impossibility of their apparent sense. Al-Cazâlï states: The fourth group made scripture [the Qur an and Sunna] fundamental and dealt with it at length. They were familiar with a great number of scriptural passages, but they avoided human reasoning and did not plunge into it. The conflict between reasoning and scriptural passages was apparent to them only in some fringe areas of the rational sciences. However, because their involvement with reasoning was not extensive nor did they plunge into it, rational impossibilities were not obvious to them, for some impossibilities are perceived only after careful and extended investigation built on many successive premises. 48 See N. Heer, "The Canons ofTa'wïl", in Windows on the House of Islam: Muslim Sources on Spirituality and Religious Ufi , ed. J. Renard, Berkeley-Los Angeles, University of California Press, 1998; Griffel, Al-Ghazâlïs Philosophical Theology , p. 1 1 1-22.</page><page sequence="20">T. Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 529 One must add another point, and that is that they believed that they could consider anything to be possible as long as it was not known to be impossible. They did not realize that there are three categories [to be taken into account]: (1) a category whose impossibility is known by a proof, (2) a category whose possibility is known by proof, and (3) a category neither the possibility nor impos- sibility of which is known. It was their custom to judge this third category to be possible, since its impossibility was not apparent to them.49 Al-Gazàlï critiques the methodology of his As ari te predecessors and colleagues who assigned too much weight to the Qur ãn and Sunna and not enough weight to reason. He argues that, because these theologians were "short of [intellectual] insight," they were unable to unify reason with scripture. They consequently failed to realize that there is no conflict between scripture and what reason establishes through rational evidence. In short, they thought that the conflict between these sources was real, because they failed to discern the rational impossibility of the apparent sense of certain Qur ãnic expressions and Prophetic Reports. Later in this treatise al-Gazâlï mentions expressions such as God s "being above" and "He ascended the Throne," and it is likely that he has these anthropomorphic descriptions in mind. By incorrectly thinking that their impossibility could not be demonstrated, this group mistakenly placed these descriptions in the category of possibility. Had this group been familiar with the philosophical concept of burhãn ("philosophical demonstration"), al-Gazãll would argue, they would have realized that the impossibility of such descriptions can be demonstrated through human reasoning, using "an extended investigation built on successive premises." As a result of this methodological error, this group did not apply tawïl and neglected the anthropomorphic descriptions to figurative meanings. Al-čazall writes: Since [this fourth group] did not plunge deeply into the rational sciences, they did not encounter many of these impossibilities. They were therefore spared the great effort of making most interpretations, for they were not aware of any need for interpretation. They resemble someone who does not know that God s being in a direction is impossible and who can therefore dispense with the interpreta- tion of "being above" and "[Gods] ascending [the Throne]" and all such words that indicate God s being in a direction.50 For both al-čuwaynl and al-Gazãll, the controversy concerning how Qur 'ãnic verses and prophetic reports should be interpreted turns on the epistemologi- 49 Al-Gazâlï, Qänün al-tawìU ed.

Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 cal question of what counts as certain knowledge.51 Philosophical demonstra- tion (i burhãn ), they both argued, conveys strong enough evidence to serve as a criterion for tawil, The failure to apply ta uñí to the anthropomorphic des- criptions is due to a certain intellectual incompetence, namely an incapacity to produce a philosophical demonstration that precludes the apparent sense as a plausible interpretation. The turn towards Mutazilite tawil in As arism thus started before al-RãzI. Upon producing apodictic demonstrations that indicate the falsity of the apparent sense of scripture, al-čuwayní and al-Cazàlï apply tawil to the anthropomorphic Qur anic verses and prophetic reports. Both critique their As arite colleagues for adhering to the apparent sense of anthropomorphic attributes, and for making real attributes out of "ascending the Throne," "coming," "descending," and "having a side."52 Al-čuwayní applies tawil by construing "hands" as "power," [Gods] "eyes" as "vision," and [Gods] "face" as "existence" on the basis of "rational proof."53 Al-Cazãlí postulates that philo- sophical demonstration shows the impossibility of Gods "being above" (in a spatial sense); he applies tawil to this expression by interpreting it figuratively along Mutazilite lines to mean "superior in rank."54 Al-Râzï develops the methodology of tawil by building on the above contri- butions. He too implements apodictic demonstration as a philosophical crite- rion for tawil. But he also introduces a new epistemic framework to resolve the tawil-issue. This alternative epistemic framework, which comprises two methods of proof - rational and textual - is a salient feature of al-Râzîs methodology. Al-Râzï assumes these proofs in his works of theology, and he uses them both extensively in his Quran commentary. In what follows I illus- trate that al-Rází s epistemic framework and its rules regarding tawil strongly resemble radical Mu'tazilite ideas that were articulated earlier in the tradition and which were branded as heretical in most intellectual circles. Al-Râzï s dis- tinctive conception of tawiU I shall argue, assigns the canonical sources - the Qur an and Sunna - an exceptionally low epistemic value. Let me begin with some remarks about al-Râzïs epistemic system, inclu- ding its technical terminology and concepts, since it is within this system that 51 The point is made most recently by Griffel (2009), who cites several references to M.E. Marmuras insights into this; Griffel, Al-Ghazalis Philosophical Theology, p. 112. 52 Al-Guwaynï, Kitâb al-Iriâd, ed. M.Y. Musa and A A. 'Abd al-Hamïd, Cairo, 1950, p. 68. 53 See al-Guwaynï, Iriàd , p. 68: "Some of our masters maintained that the two hands, the two eyes and the face are proper Attributes of the Lord God and that this is proven by tradition rather than rational proof. But the correa view, in our opinion, is that the hands should be construed as power, the eyes as vision and the face as existence." 54 Griffel, Al-Ghazâlî's Philosophical Theobgy, p. 112-3.</page><page sequence="22">T.

These are essentially two sources of guidance that may be used in theological proofs, and each argues from a diffe- rent kind of evidence.55 A verbal proof uses statements from the Qur an and Sunna as evidence. All such evidence, which has been expressed by the Prophet, is embodied in the religious textual tradition.56 A rational proof (datil ' aqti ) is based on premises known intuitively or necessarily to be true through reason or sense perception.57 Most rationalist thinkers considered such premises to have high epistemic value; accordingly, they deemed them suitable for use as premises in a philosophical demonstration.58 Because these premises were considered the building blocks for philosophical arguments, many theological and philo- sophical works provide lists of them. The following list appears in Avicennas IsãrãP. (1) Primary propositions (al-awwaliyyãi)' the statement that the whole is greater than any of its parts; (2) Propositions containing their own syllogisms (qadãya qiyãsãtuhã ma aha), such as the statement that four is an even num- ber; (3) Sensibly-perceived propositions (al-mah$ü$äi)' the statement that this fire is hot; (4) Empirical propositions (al-mugarrabãi) or facts known through experimentation, such as the statement that scammony is a laxative; (5) Intui- tive propositions (al-hadsiyyãí) or acute guesses, as for example, the statement that the light of the moon is derived from that of the sun; (6) Propositions based on unanimous reports or traditions (al-tawãturiyyãi)' this included his- torical or geographical facts reported by a sufficient number of witnesses such that it would be impossible to suppose that they were all lying.59 Like his predecessors al-čuwayní and al-Gazãll, al-RãzI sees the exegetical problem of ta uñí through the lens of epistemology. And like his predecessors, he proposes that the criterion for tawil must rank as strong evidence - it must be strong enough to show the impossibility of the apparent sense. Only with such evidence in hand, al-RãzI proposes, is it permissible to divert a Qur anic 55 Al-RãzI, Muhassaly p. 66-7. 56 For a discussion of verbal evidence, see Van Ess, Die Erkenntnislehre, p. 406-7. The two (Qur ãn and Prophetic Reports) are grouped together on the grounds that both are expressed by the Prophet. 57 N.

Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 verse (or prophetic report) from its preponderant sense to a nonpreponderant sense. In al-Râzïs system, the only two candidates that can fulfill this function are rational {dalli ' aqlì ) and verbal evidence {dalïl lajzï ). Al-Rãzí states: It is necessary to establish a rule that governs this issue: We hold that a verbal expression, if it is susceptible to two meanings, and it preponderates more towards one than another - if one interprets it in accordance with the preponderant [meaning] - then that [verbal expression is classified as] clear ( muhkam ). Now, if one interprets it in accordance with the nonpreponderant [meaning] , then that is ambiguous ( mutcããbih ). We claim that diverting the verbal expression from the preponderant [meaning] to the nonpreponderant [meaning] may take place only through decisive evidence. That decisive evidence may be either verbal or rational.60 He supplies the same rule in his Ta sis al-taqdis : It is necessary to [advance] a general rule that governs this issue. We hold that if the verbal expression of a verse or report is apparent ( zähir ) [in its meaning], in our opinion it is only permissible to depart from that apparent [meaning] with decisive evidence, otherwise [Gods] speech would cease to convey meaning and the Qur an would no longer be a proof. That decisive evidence may be either verbal or rational.61 In the above al- Rãzí supplies a general rule that governs the application of tawil. He proposes that one may apply tawil and "depart from the apparent meaning" if one produces sufficiently strong evidence that would show the falsity of the preponderant meaning. In the scheme that he proposes, decisive evidence fulfills this role. Such evidence may be rational evidence or verbal evidence, and these function as deciding factors in the case of diversion. The "general rule" that governs the interpretation of the Qur an and Sunna is thus grounded in the issue of what counts as strong evidence. While the above epistemic framework represents a new approach to resolving the tawil-issue , there are more departures from classical As arism in al-Râzïs thought. And there are several innovative elements that are distinctively al-RãzIan and that point to an influence of radical Mu'tazilism on al-Râzïs thought. Chief among these is the idea that the Qur an and Sunna have an exceptionally low epistemic value. Indeed a close examination of al-Râzïs explanations of verbal evidence indicate that al-Ràzï, like the Mu'tazila gene- 60 Al-Râzï, Mafitïh al-gayby VII, p. 181. 61 Al-Râzï, Ta sis al-taqdïs, p. 181.</page><page sequence="24">T. Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 533 rally, devalued the religious textual tradition, that is, the transmitted knowledge that was embodied in the Qur an and Sunna. Al-Rãzls devaluation of the epistemic value of the Qur an and Sunna is evinced in his critique of tawãtur ("recurrent") prophetic reports. Such reports are considered the mainstay of "verbal evidence." Tawãtur or recurrent reports are those that have been transmitted through multiple chains of transmission that are textually identical. These chains of transmission were considered suffi- ciently numerous to preclude any possibility or collaboration or a forgery.62 The tawãtur transmitters, most theologians argued, cannot all have a single reason to lie, and it is inconceivable that they should conspire to tell the same lie.63 The impossibility of a forgery functioned as a criterion for the reliability of such reports for al-Cazãll and others. Moreover, its content was guaranteed by this criterion. Such reports, theologians held, allowed us to obtain knowledge of past events.64 So, knowledge that Mecca exists and knowledge that Muhammad is a prophet, for example, all fall under this category accor- ding to Muslim theologians. The Islamic intellectual tradition recurrent reports a high epistemic value. Theologians, philosophers and jurists generally counted them among premises that produced necessary or certain knowledge.65 They held that such reports could be used as the bases for demonstrative arguments, which proceeded from premises that were necessarily true and did not admit of doubt.66 Al-Gazàll, for example, argued that what is transmitted through tawãtur yiel- ded premises that could be used in demonstrative proofs. For him, as well as for many others, it was the reliability of the transmissions of such reports that warranted their inclusion in demonstrative proofs. In short, their content was guaranteed by transmission. The Mu'tazila opposed this view, and al-RãzIs critique of the epistemic value of the religious textual tradition bears the imprint of Mu tazilite specu- lation. Al-Ràzïs critique subjects recurrent prophetic reports to a stringent 62 Wael B.

Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 measure of doubt.67 Like Mutazilite critiques that were articulated earlier, al-Râzï s critique focuses on transmission.68 He judges the value of such reports with a yardstick that measures the reliability of the transmission process of such reports. He argues that because the transmission process contains so many contingencies, the statements that are transmitted through such a pro- cess reach only the degree of probability, not certainty. Al-Rãzl states: (a) Verbal evidence is contingent upon the transmission of words, the transmis- sion of aspects of grammar and inflection, the absence of equivocation, the absence of metaphor, the absence of specification, the absence of ellipses, and the absence of the textual and rationalist objection. And all of these things are contingent, so it is established that no form of verbal evidence is decisive.69 (b) As for the first [verbal evidence], this is false, because verbal evidences do not convey certain [knowledge], because they are contingent upon the transmis- sion of words, the transmission of aspects of grammar and inflection, the absence of equivocation and metaphor, and specification, and the absence of ellipses, and the absence of the textual and rationalist objection. All of these are probable premises, and what is contingent upon hypothetical is more wor- thy of being probable. Thus it is established that no form of verbal evidences can possibly convey certainty.70 In the above al-RãzI lists a number of conditions that must be fulfilled if a verbal report is to convey certain knowledge. In the course of doing so, how- ever, he implies that the transmissions of such reports or statements rely on conditions that are contingent and could not possibly function a medium for certain knowledge. For example, meanings change through disputes about inflection; in the case of a metaphor, the intended meaning could be other than what we know or conceive. Moreover, in the case of a metaphorical meaning, no one is better than the others. Finally, the transmitters themselves made many errors in the process of transmission - the human element made the process wholly contingent. Now, because components of the transmission process are unreliable, the content of what is transmitted by them can only reach probable knowledge, not certain knowledge. But because these are all contingencies and rely on an unreliable process subject to human error, the content of what is transmitted by them can only reach the level of probable 67 The only thinker who expresses such a degree of doubt about prophetic reports is the Mu'tazilite Abü Ishãq al-Nazzãm, whose views were considered radical even by Mutazilite standards. 68 On the attitude of the Mutazila towards Hadit , see Van Ess, "L'autorité de la tradition prophétique dans la théologie mu'tazilite," in La notion d'autorité au Moyen Age.

Jaffer /Arabica 59 (2012) 510-535 535 knowledge. Al-Râzï thus sets the bar of certain knowledge so high that recur- rent reports, which are the strongest kind of hadiths attributable to the Prophet, do not makes its cut. The doubts al-Râzï raised about the value of Hadït literature influenced his methodology in tafiïr. Because he assigns even the strongest of hadith reports a low epistemic value, al-Râzï openly dismisses canonical prophetic reports that had long been recognized as authoritative within the Islamic tradition as mythical. Al-Râzïs commentary on Kor 27, 84, a verse which alludes to an apocalyptic beast, provides a good example of this.71 The Quranic verse reads as follows: "When the Word falls on them, We shall bring forth for them out of the earth a beast that shall speak unto them: 'Mankind had no faith in Our signs.' "72 During al-Ràzïs time a wealth of prophetic reports had been tied to this verse. These reports concerned the creation of this beast, its physical char- acteristics, the language it spoke, where it would arise, etc. Moreover, all of this material had been attributed to the Prophet and long been recognized as authoritative. Al-Rãzí openly rejects this mass of material on the grounds that its trans- mission is doubtful. If one could actually establish that such material actually stemmed from the Prophet, he argues that then it could be accepted. But it cannot. There are just too many conditions, including the catalogue I describe above, that would have to be fulfilled in order for the content to be reliable. Let me conclude: My above analysis indicates that al-RâzIs methodology evinces two major Mutazilite characteristics. The method of tawïl adopted by al-Râzï suggests that he advocated the preeminence of reason as a source of knowledge. By rearranging the status of sources of knowledge he departed from his genealogical tradition of As arism and adopted basic assumptions and methods of the Mutazila. Al-Râzïs yardstick that measures the reliability of prophetic reports suggests that al-Râzï took an especially skeptical stance toward the value of Hadït literature. Only a thinker favorably disposed to the most radical of Mutazilite ideas could have cast doubt on reports that the tradition categorized as worthy of yielding certain knowledge.73 71 Al-Rãzí, Mafâtih al-êayb , XXIV, p. 217-8; Goldziher, "Aus der Theologie," p. 237. 72 Trans. A.J. Arberry, The Koran Interpreted. 73 On the radical nature of al-Râzï s epistemic framework, see Van Ess, Die Erkenntnislehre , p. 309 and 412. Indeed before al-Râzï, the only thinker to have formulated such radical views on hadith reports was Abù Ishãq al-Nazzäm, the maverick Mu'tazilite. See al-Bagdâdï, Kitãb al-Farq bayna l-firaq , p. 143; here it is attributed to Nazzäm that recurrent reports might be false.
