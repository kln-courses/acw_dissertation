<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETER I. BOGUCKI THE MNIKOW BONE ARTIFACTS: A NINETEENTH-CENTURY ARCHAEOLOGICAL FORGERY Almost 100 years ago, a controversy flared which embroiled a large number of practitioners of the relatively young field of prehistoric archae ology. This was the matter of the authenticity of a large number of bone artifacts excavated in several caves in the Krakow area by one of the leading Polish prehistorians of the nineteenth century, Gottfryd Ossowski. The dispute, although centered on Krakow, involved archaeologists in most of the centers of learning in Europe and forms a little-known chapter in the early history of archaeological research. Krakow in the last quarter of the nineteenth century had become the hub of prehistoric research in Poland (and, it might be added, remains a major center to this day). This was due to a variety of reasons. First, the relatively benign (in contrast to the other parts of Poland) Austrian occupation per mitted a great degree of intellectual activity on the part of the Poles living in this area, and this, coupled with the tradition of scholarship in Krakow, provided a congenial climate for scientific research. Secondly, Krakow lies in a very rich region archaeologically. Numerous sites of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers can be found in the limestone caves around the city and in the Tatra Mountains to the south. In later prehistory, the fertile loess soils of the Krakow area were very attractive to agriculturalists from Neolithic times onward. Therefore, it is not surprising that when the Academy of Science was founded in Krakow in 1873 prehistoric archaeology was a prime concern of its Anthropological Commission. A major topic of interest to early archaeologists was the fact that human remains and/ or traces of human activity were beginning to appear which were associated with extinct fauna, notably cave bear, wooly rhinoceros, and mammoth. It was becoming quite evident that man was considerably older than the date of 4004 B.C. which Archbishop Ussher in the seven teenth century had decided marked the Creation.1 The caves in the Krakow-Wielun Jura, a region of limestone formations dissected by stream valleys north of Krakow, were found to be especially rich in such deposits, particularly those in the area between Krakow and Ojcow. The first exca vations in this region were begun in 1871 by Count Jan Zawisza, the owner 'Colin Renfrew, Before Civilization, Knopf, 1973, p. 21. 92</page><page sequence="2">The Mnikow Bone Artifacts_93 of much of the Ojcow area, who became one of the most active interna tional representatives of Polish archaeology, giving papers on his findings at congresses in Bologna, Brussels, and Budapest.2 Additional excavations in Ojcow caves were conducted by the German geologist Ferdinand Romer from Wroclaw, who concentrated his research on Nietoperzowa Cave in Jerzmanowice in 1878-79.3 However, the richness and the number of the caverns in the Krakow-Ojcow area was so great that the Krakow Academy of Science, at the instigation of its president, Dr. Jozef Majer, initiated a major research project of inventorying, mapping, and excavating these caves and rock-shelters. The man they chose to lead this project was Gott fryd Ossowski, a recent arrival to the Krakow archaeological community. Ossowski was born on 20 November 1835 of relatively poor parents in Kazarynowce near Kiev, finished secondary school in 2ytomierz, served in the Russian army and rose to the rank of lieutenant.4 Afterwards, he worked in the local court in 2ytomierz and was a clerk of the local statisti cal committee. In the course of this work, he revealed a certain tendency towards becoming a collector of geological and archaeological materials. Although Ossowski was essentially self-taught,5 the committee delegated him to investigate the geological formations of Wolynia, which he spent the next ten years doing (1860-70). During these geological investigations, he became more and more interested in archaeology, and by the early 1870s, he was giving papers on the archaeology of Wolynia before meetings of archaeologists in Kiev.6 In 1874, Ossowski moved his activities to Torun, where he worked under the auspices of the Scientific Society of that city. By this time, he was con centrating on archaeological research and excavated a wide range of sites, mostly prehistoric graves and cemeteries.7 He also organized the archaeo logical wing of the Torun Museum. While in Torun, Ossowski began maintaining contacts with the Acad emy of Science in Krakow, and in 1878 he moved there.

After spending 1879 locating, recording, and mapping caves, Ossowski began excavating cave deposits in 1880. During his first three years of exca vation (1880,1881,1882) he concentrated his investigations on the Mnikow ravine.8 It was located to the northwest of the city of Krakow, running for four kilometers with its high limestone banks perforated by numerous caves with names like "Pod Kochank^," "Na Mitaszowce," "Na Lopian kach," "Na Gaiku," and "Grota Dra Majera." In keeping with the accepted excavation methodology of his day, Ossow ski did not find it necessary to be at the location of the excavations during the entire workday. Instead he appeared at the site once a day to note the progress of the work, look over the excavated materials, and make recom mendations for the next day's operations. Archaeology during the late nineteenth century was more interested in the excavated materials them selves than in the contexts where these materials were found. Ossowski found it sufficient to note that three distinct strata generally occurred in these caves.9 The first was black humus with an admixture of clay, ranging from 15 to 40 cm. in depth, in which were found potsherds from various periods of later prehistory and from historic periods along with bronze and iron artifacts. The second layer was clayey soil with small pebbles, ranging from one to two meters in depth. In this layer were numerous flint tools and waste flakes along with the bones of many different animals, including those of small rodents who lived in the caves, kitchen refuse from the pre historic human inhabitants, and artifacts of worked bone. These artifacts were mostly in the form of awls and needles made from the sharpened ends of long bones, but some took unusual shapes, primarily of anthropomor phic and zoomorphic figures. The third layer was clay with a greater ad mixture of stones than the second, with many limestone fragments which had fallen from the walls and roof of the cave. This layer did not contain any artifacts, although there were numerous animal bones, including those of extinct species like mammoth and wooly rhinoceros. 8 Ossowski published a series of annual reports in the journal of the Anthropological Com mission Zbior Wiadomosci do Antropologii Krajowej from 1880 to 1884 about his excava tions in the Mnikow caves. The ravine took its name from the fact that it belonged to the Camendolite monastery at Bielany. 9 In addition to the annual reports, the Mnikow stratigraphy is summarized in Gottfryd Ossowski, "Etat des recherches dans les cavernes en Pologne," Materiaux pour I'Histoire Primitive et Naturelle de VHomme, second series, vol. 13 (1882), p. 10.</page><page sequence="4">The Mnikow Bone Artifacts_95 As the work proceeded, Ossowski became particularly interested in the worked bone from the second level. The figures of carved bone were elab orate representations of birds and animals, along with human forms, some times in profile, sometimes full-face. Other carved bones took geometric forms, such as pyramids, and some were reminiscent of coats-of-arms.10 Here was something which had never been seen anywhere else in Europe. Was it strictly a local phenomenon from some as-yet-undetermined period in the prehistory of the Krakow area, or was Ossowski digging into deposits of an antiquity which no one had previously reached? Four years of exca vations in the caves at the Mnikow ravine resulted in over 8000 bone arti facts from eleven caves and rock-shelters. Ossowski was well aware of the original nature of his finds and took care to see that they were well known internationally. He first gave a paper in May of 1882 to a meeting of Czech doctors and naturalists in Prague, showing them materials from the "Na Milaszowce" cave as well as many photographs.11 Due to a lack of time, no discussion ensued, but great interest was apparently aroused. In the fall of 1882, he sent Professor Woldfich of Prague a selection of the Mnikow artifacts to present at the meeting of the Vienna Anthropological Society, which published one of the more influential anthropological journals in Europe at the time.12 At the same time, Ossowski brought a selection of the Mnikow materials to the meeting of Russian archaeologists in Odessa. The reaction of the anthropological community was not long in coming. Among the first critics were members of the Krakow anthropological circle, notably Jozef Lepkowski, who is reported to have exclaimed "The Mnikow boys made these! "13 Teodor Ziemi^cki, another member of the Anthropological Commission, also expressed doubts.14 The artifacts which Ossowski sent with Woldfich to Vienna did not meet with an en thusiastic reception. Woldfich wrote to Ossowski: When I put the artifacts before the Anthropological Society... Professor Szom bathy said to me "These are simply fakes,"and Dr. Much and others likewise shook their heads. I objected. It lasted 16 minutes and no one retreated from his position... ,0Nosek, op. cit., p. 47. nKonrad Majewski, review of Sprawa wykopalisk mnikowskich in Mittheilungen der Anthropologischen Gesellschaft in Wien, vol. 15 (1885), p. 87. ,2Ossowski's testimony before the inquiry into the authenticity of the Mnikow artifacts (see text below), reported in the proceedings of the inquiry published as Sprawa wykopalisk mnikowskich, a supplement to volume 9 of Zbior Wiadomosci do Antropologii Krajowej, 1885; hereafter cited as Sprawa . . . 13 Sprawa . . . , op. cit., p. 2. 14 Ibid.</page><page sequence="5">96 The Polish Review The next day, I examined the artifacts closely myself. I found that they were not fakes and could not be so to anyone ... I told Professor Szombathy my opinion, that they are real artifacts only saying that they are a bit younger than you maintain. To that Szombathy replied that it depends on your point of view, (and) for him they are counterfeit.15 The consensus of the Viennese anthropologists was contained in an article entitled "Falschungen aus Mnikow" which appeared in the journal edited by Professor Szombathy.16 Ossowski was able to publish a rebuttal in the same volume. To Ossowski's aid came Otto Tischler of Konigsberg in East Prussia. Tischler was an active excavator of later prehistoric (Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age) materials and had noticed the similarity between the Mnikow bone figures and the amber figurines which he had been finding in East Prussia. Making a great leap-of-faith, he declared the Mnikow arti facts to be authentic Neolithic materials based on this similarity.17 (Like Woldfich, Tischler believed that the artifacts were from a later date than the great antiquity which Ossowski claimed for them.) Tischler also de fended Ossowski's competency as an archaeologist, since the two had both been working at the same time in East Prussia. His recommendation was that a "knowledgeable excursion" be made from the next meeting of the German Anthropological Society in Wroclaw to Krakow to examine the Mnikow artifacts at first hand and decide on their authenticity. The support from an authority such as Tischler seemed to quiet the accu sations among the German-speaking anthropological community that the Mnikow artifacts were false. But new outcries were heard from a number of French anthropologists. Ossowski had published a summary of his first two excavation seasons in January 1882 in a French anthropological jour nal edited by Emile Cartailhac where he published lithographs of 50 of the Mnikow bone artifacts.18 The specimens pictured in this article are not the usual representations of humans or animals which aroused the controversy among the German archaeologists, since these were only discovered during the 1882 and 1883 field seasons. The artifacts pictured are simply a number of bone needles and awls, along with a fork-and-spoon set. The French had long been excavating cave sites in south-central France and bone tools were nothing unusual to them. They found the fork-and-spoon set to be quite curious as well as Ossowski's claims that the heads of some of the awls ]5Ibid. 16Mittheilungen der Anthropologischen Gesellschaft in Wien, vol. 14 (1884), p. 65. 17Otto Tischler, Correspondenz-Blatt der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Anthropologie, Ethnologie, und Urgeschichte, vol. 14, no. 10 (October 1883), p. 151. 18Ossowski (1882), op. cit.</page><page sequence="6">The Mnikow Bone Artifacts_97 could be interpreted as representations of animals, and Cartailhac ex-, pressed his scepticism in a series of footnotes accompanying Ossowski's article. In December of 1883, the French archaeologists Emile Chantre and Adrien de Mortillet passed through Krakow on their way to Russia and visiting the archaeological museum of the Academy of Science, examined the Mnikow artifacts first-hand.19 By this time, the really imaginative human and animal forms of the 1882 and 1883 seasons had been excavated and housed in the museum (the same materials which had caused the accu sations of falsification from the Germans.) Ossowski was not present at the time of their visit, and they were shown the artifacts by Izydor Kopernicki, docent of anthropology at the Jagiellonian University.20 Chantre and de Mortillet declared the artifacts false on the spot. De Mortillet said that the bones had been "cut and perforated with a penknife."21 (Ossowski claimed that Chantre and de Mortillet only looked at the artifacts through the glass of a closed display case before declaring them false, although he admitted that they did not change their opinion when given several to examine closer afterwards.22) Upon their return to France, Chantre and de Mortillet reported their observations to Cartailhac, who apparently was quite predisposed to believe that the materials were fake. In the same journal in which Ossowski had published his report on the first two seasons, Cartailhac maintained that Ossowski was the victim of a forgery and that the Academy of Science would be well-advised to dissociate itself from the Mnikow artifacts to spare archaeology of ridicule.23 At the same time, Adrian de Mortillet published an article entitled "Faux des cavernes de Pologne" which summed up his impressions of the Mnikow artifacts.24 He noted the differences in coloration between surfaces of the artifacts which had been worked and those which were not, concluding that the primary raw material may have been quite old and have come from the caves, but that the modification of it was quite recent. He also maintained that the motifs of ornamentation on the bone artifacts were quite common in Polish folk art and that the utensils (like the fork-and-spoon set) were imitations of those then currently in use in Poland.

The defenders of the authenticity of the Mnikow artifacts reacted strongly to the French attack. Ossowski wrote a trenchant letter to Cartail hac, rebutting his accusations of forgery.25 Zygmunt Zaborowski, a Polish emigre anthropologist living in Paris, disputed the opinions of Cartailhac, Chantre, and de Mortillet in a paper delivered to a meeting of French anthropologists at Blois.26 Tischler made a special trip to Krakow to examine the Mnikow artifacts and pronounced them authentic.27 But the international suspicion of the Mnikow material was becoming uncom fortable not only for Ossowski, but for the Krakow Academy of Science as well, since it was the sponsor of the excavations. The warnings of the French prehistorians that the Mnikow artifacts were a discredit to the whole field of archaeology and anthropology apparently did not fall on deaf ears. At the meeting of the Anthropological Commission on 29 November 1884, Ossowski requested that the Academy of Science convene a special committee to investigate the matter of the Mnikow bones and to judge their authenticity. The Academy was all too happy to agree, and selected a com mittee consisting of Jozef Lepkowski, professor of archaeology and an early doubter of the Mnikow artifacts; Alojzy Alth, professor of geology who had conducted excavations in the Dragon Cave at the base of Wawel Hill; Izydor Kopernicki; Jan Nepomucen Sadowski, an archaeologist who did not conduct fieldwork but who dealt theoretically with trade relations between the Greek and Roman world and the Baltic; and Ossowski himself. The committee met for the first time on 6 December 1884 and elected Alth as its president and Kopernicki as secretary.28 The first meetings, which took place weekly, were concerned with the nature of bone and the methods of working it. Kopernicki reported at length on his research aimed at answering the two questions of (a) whether the Mnikow artifacts could be duplicated by using just stone tools and (b) whether or not there were distinct traces on the bone as the result of using stone tools and whether these traces could be distinguished from those left by iron and steel tools. This is one of the earliest reported replicative experi ments in archaeology and remarkable for the specific set of questions 25 Published as appendix to Sprawa . . . , op. cit., pp. 167-170. 26 Bulletins de la Societe d'Anthropologie de Paris, vol. 7 (1884), pp. 473-479. 21 Sprawa . . . , op. cit., p. 5. 2*Ibid., preface.</page><page sequence="8">The Mnikow Bone Artifacts 99 posed. Using horse ulnae, Kopernicki compared the ease of making a bone awl first using a flint blade and then using a steel knife. He then sawed and drilled pieces of bone with flint tools and steel knives. Kopernicki con cluded that one could saw through a piece of bone just as well with a flint blade as with a steel one, although the stone tool required a greater input of time and labor and left a more irregular cut. He was also able to produce cylindrical holes in bone with a flint tool, which he took to contradict the notion that the holes made by a flint tool would be wider at one end than at the other. Scraping the bone with the flint tool produced a wavy surface with many parallel grooves (probably due to irregularities in the working edge of the flint), whereas the use of a steel blade resulted in a smooth sur face. Kopernicki then compared the artifacts which he had made, with both flint and steel blades, with the Mnikow material. He concluded that the awls and needles which he had examined were bona-fide prehistoric arti facts made with flint tools and then polished against softer, coarser-grained stones.29 The figurines presented a greater problem, and Kopernicki equivocated with regard to them, saying that they could just as easily have been made with a flint blade as with a steel one but that nothing definite could be said. At its fifteenth meeting, on 26 March 1885, the committee delivered its decision on the authenticity of the Mnikow artifacts, stating categorically that there was no trace of their having been forged in modern times and that all of the objects were undoubtedly excavated from the cave deposits in the same state as they currently appeared. They based these conclusions on the facts that there were traces of soil from the caves on all the worked surfaces and in crevices in the bones; that the majority of the awls and needles were highly polished, suggesting long periods of use; that all of the artifacts, according to Ossowski, came from undisturbed layers excavated under his supervision. This last line of evidence appears to have been simply based on the word of Ossowski.30 In answer to the specific charge of de Mortillet that the artifacts had been recently manufactured from old bones, the committee explained that the differences in coloration between the worked and unworked surfaces were due to the use of already-old bones when the artifacts were manufactured in antiquity. The committee also denied the motifs on the bones were simi lar to modern Polish folk motifs, and pointed out that although some of the tools (like the fork-and-spoon set) were similar to those currently in use in Poland, the forms were so generalized that such a similarity was no indica 29 Ibid., p. 27. Ibid., pp. 84-89.</page><page sequence="9">100 The Polish Review tion of falsification. In reply to Cartailhac's statement that the bones could have been a deliberate attempt to compromise prehistoric archaeology as a discipline, the committee asserted that the sciences coexisted peacefully in Poland, each one conscious of the others' rights to pursue investigations in that field and with no competition among them. Moreover, a non-scientist could not have perpetrated a hoax since the lives of the common people were too taken up with seeing to their personal needs and maintenance to expend the time and energy on the manufacture of such artifacts. A small dispute arose on the answer to an observation made by Much that the facets on the awls were evidence of the use of a steel knife blade. Ossowski, Alth, and Kopernicki maintained that such facets could also be produced with flint tools, whereas Sadowski and Lepkowski believed that the awls were made with an iron knife, but not in modern times. Although the committee had decided unanimously that the Mnikow artifacts were authentic and not modern forgeries, it was sharply divided over the question of exactly how old the artifacts actually were. Therefore, the committee continued to meet and debate this problem. Lepkowski was of the opinion that the artifacts were not very old at all and were of late medieval or even Renaissance date. Sadowski also spoke for a late date for the materials which took anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms, saying that they had ethnological value only. He was, however, willing to admit that the awls were ancient. Kopernicki, on the other hand, was able to state unequivocally that all the bone artifacts from Mnikow were undoubtedly very old, saying that they came from a hitherto-unknown "Bone Age," during which flint tools had not yet been abandoned but were beginning to be replaced with iron implements. Alth concurred with Kopernicki. The twentieth and last meeting of the committee was held on 27 April 1885. It had managed to be in full agreement that the Mnikow bone arti facts were not modern forgeries, but the main question, that of the actual age of the materials, had been evaded. Unable to move any further on this matter, Alth declared the matter closed. Ossowski continued to excavate cave sites north of Krakow for several more years, although he never managed to find artifacts like those which he had excavated at Mnikow. In addition, he conducted archaeological surveys and excavations in Podolia and Ukraine. 1891 saw Ossowski assuming the directorship of the Archaeological Museum in Krakow, which had become a separate branch of the Academy of Science.31 How ever, he suddenly left Krakow at the beginning of 1893 for Tomsk in Siberia, where he conducted geological and archaeological research for five 3,Nosek, op. cit., pp. 49-50.</page><page sequence="10">The Mnikow Bone Artifacts_101 years. This work was cut short by his death from pneumonia in Tomsk on 28 April 1897, thus ending one of the most productive archaeological careers in nineteenth-century Europe. The matter of the Mnikow artifacts was not fully resolved until close to fifty years later, and then only accidentally. In May, 1929, three Krakow archaeologists were passing through the Mnikow ravine on a Saturday afternoon excursion.32 While showing them the entrance to one of the caves, a local resident remembered that a "man from Krakow" had con ducted excavations there long before. This guide said that he had been a boy during Ossowski's excavations in the Mnikow ravine, and although he had been too young to take part in the excavations himself, he had often looked in on them. Many artifacts were excavated from the cave deposits, but none were made from bone. The bone artifacts had been manufactured by the workmen themselves, who had taken unworked bone excavated in the caves, carved it, smeared it with cave earth, and presented it to Ossow ski in the form of freshly-excavated bone artifacts (or alternatively, buried it deeper in the cave deposit and allowed Ossowski to see it being excavated during one of his visits to the site). The guide gave the archaeologists the names of three surviving workmen of Ossowski, who were called before a committee of the Academy of Science at the Archaeological Museum in Krakow on 26 November 1929 consisting of Professor Wlodzimierz Demetrykiewicz, Dr. Tadeusz Reyman, and Dr. Gabriel Lehczyk.33 The committee was told that with the exception of some of the awls and needles, all of the bone artifacts from the Mnikow caves had been faked. The motive? Money, cigarettes, and vodka. Ossowski was in the habit of paying awards for particularly fine specimens and if he was particularly impressed upon arriving at the site at 10 a.m. as was his habit, he would send out for cigarettes and vodka for the workmen. The bone from the cave deposits was soft when freshly excavated and easy to work, and the forging began only a few days after the opening of excavations in the first cave in 1880. The most active forger was the son of a carpenter, since he had the most skill and the best tools. Some of the workmen were able to command large sums of money as a result of their after-hours work, since Ossowski paid from three to five cents for each nice specimen. Thus the matter of the Mnikow excavations was closed. In hindsight, it is all too easy to condemn Ossowski for not maintaining constant control 32 Stefan Nosek, "Sprawa wykopalisk mnikowskich," Liber Iosepho Kostrzewski (Kos trzewski festschrift), Konrad Jazdzewski, ed.), Wroclaw-Warsaw-Cracow, 1968, pp. 602 14. The three archaeologists were Tadeusz Reyman, Gabriel Lehczyk, and Jan Fitzke. 33 The workmen were identified as Lukasz Maciusik, age 80; his brother Jan, age 66; and Jan Kacik, age 68.</page><page sequence="11">102 The Polish Review over his excavations. But it should be remembered that archaeology in the late nineteenth century did not really care about the location of the object in the ground as much as archaeologists are concerned with it today. Most archaeologists did precisely as Ossowski did, appearing on the site briefly each day and inspecting the work. His lack of stratigraphic control (he was only able to sort out the three most obvious levels) was no worse than many other archaeologists of his time.34 Ossowski was simply a victim of the deception practiced by his workmen and his own over-credulity. 34 Modern techniques of precise excavation did not become common until the 1930s and even later.
