<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 742 Journal of the American Oriental Society 134.4 (2014) a set of formulaic-looking uses in Vedic prose, as Oertel discussed, e.g., tasmai pitṝnt sasṛjānāya divā  abhavat “for this (Prajāpati) when he had created the Fathers, there was day” (MS 4.2.1). But this  construction is rare indeed, and seems too slender a peg on which to hang a theory. As Ruppel herself  puts it in her summary (p. 142), “the main weakness of the view proposed here—that the Sanskrit GA  is a reflex of an original adverbial dative usage which, after syncretizing with the genitive, and pos- sibly under the influence of the already existing LA [locative absolute, JSL], lost some of its original  semantics in the process—is the rarity of that original dative usage.” Yoshida boldly steps into the fray of an ongoing dispute in PIE linguistics with his “The Loss  of Intervocalic Laryngeals in Sanskrit and Its Historical Implications.” His historical implications  refer to how we reconstruct final vowels and sequences of laryngeal loss in Baltic and Germanic,  taking issue with an earlier account by Jay Jasanoff. Perhaps farthest from the concerns of “Indic”  sensu stricto, his is an interesting account of a difficult problem, beginning from traces of intervo- calic laryngeals in Vedic. Interested readers may be referred now to recent work in this domain (see  Dieter Gunkel’s 2010 Studies in Greek and Vedic Prosody, Morphology and Meter, Ph.D. Diss.  UCLA). In essence Yoshida argues that the loss of laryngeals in Indo-Iranian, reflected in the RV  by occasional disyllabic scansions of the gen.pl. (-ānām as -āna’am) and the abl.sg. of thematic  stems (-ād as –a’ad), to which could be added the more systematic preservations in Avestan, should  serve as the model for laryngeal loss in Germanic and Baltic. For Yoshida’s account the loss in the  sequence *-VHVC did not lead to compensatory lengthening and trimoric vowels, since this sequence  would have syllabified *-V.HV(C), and syllabic onsets do not contribute moraic weight, hence no  compensatory lengthening takes place. How Yoshida obtains the Baltic and Germanic facts, I leave  interested readers to discover (pp. 242–44), since it exceeds the likely readership of this review. I  doubt that Yoshida has said the last word on this contested topic, but his argument deserves to factor  into the ongoing debate. This volume brings together many high quality papers, offering a number of significant contribu- tions to our understanding of Vedic linguistics (on which we have focused here), and beyond. I recom- mend the volume to anyone interested in the rich attestation of “Indic across the Millennia.” Jesse Lundquist University of California, Los Angeles The Traditional Kerala Manor: Architecture of a South Indian Catuḥśāla House. By Henri Schildt.  Institut français de Pondichéry / École française d’Extrême-Orient, Collection Indologie, no. 117.

The “four-house” (Skt. catuḥśāla; Mal. nālukeṭṭu) manors of Kerala were, for centuries, the iconic  abodes of the region’s ruling classes. Catuḥśālas are well known to greater South Asian architec- ture, deriving their name and basic architectural character from the placement of four halls (Skt. śālā  ‘house’) around a quadrangular courtyard (in distinction to “one-,” “two-,” and “three-house” types).  In Kerala, catuḥśāla manors served historically as the residences of important Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya,  and Nāyar families. Closely tied to the cultural and economic lives of the families that inhabited them, these palatial  houses have become increasingly obsolete in the face of dramatic social change in Kerala over the past  century and more. schildt (p. vi) reports that Kerala’s catuḥśāla manors are being demolished or con- verted to other uses at an alarming rate. The primary goal of The Traditional Kerala Manor is, there- fore, “to describe a certain palatial house type favoured by the Kerala ruling-class Hindus” (p. 1) before  its “virtual disappearance” (p. vi). The author succeeds admirably in this task, and the painstakingly  detailed documentation of the manors that are the heart of the text represent an academic achievement  of tremendous worth to the scholarly community. As the first general study of its kind, The Traditional  </page> <page sequence="2"> Reviews of Books 743 Kerala Manor is destined to become the primary reference for future studies on the architecture and  ritual use of these important buildings. For this study the author chose thirty-one houses from across Kerala still on their original sites  (and many still inhabited by their original families). They vary by the class of the families that built  them (Nampūtiri, Rājan/Tampurān, Nāyar, and Ampalavāsi) and their region (North Malabar, South  Malabar, Cochin, and former Travancore) and range in age from perhaps as much as 500 to 150 years  old. Between 1997 and 2002 the author and his assistants measured and photographed these houses  and interviewed informants. The results of this undertaking are presented directly in 436 plates and  collated in a number of tables (in appendix 3, mislabeled “Appendix 2”). The plates present annotated  multi-story floor plans of the catuḥśālas and their compounds, ritual diagrams related to the floor  plans, detailed elevations, cross-sections, and other drawings of the various structures, and numerous  photographs of the manors, compounds, outbuildings, and their architectural details. This material, syn- thesized and presented in narrative form in chapter 4, provides a fascinating encounter with the Kerala  catuḥśāla that anyone interested in the houses is certain to find profitable. The emphasis of the monograph is on architecture and ritual, focusing “on the plan” of the manor  itself as well as its ritual production and delineation of ritualized spaces (p. 1). Within his general  documentary aim, the author articulates several subsidiary goals. First, he wishes “to give an outline  or preliminary survey of a virtually unstudied subject: the local and caste-related house types and their  distinctive characteristics,” for which “a descriptive approach is required to systematically clarify the  characteristics of different house types and present them in well-illustrated tables, drawings, and pho- tographs” (p. 6). Second, he wants to know the extent to which “the rules described in [the Sanskrit  architectural] manuals are realized in traditional houses, and to what extent do they reflect localities  and status groups” (p. 6). Finally, the author refers to a number of issues relating to the ritual uses of  the house and the importance of ritual diagrams to the house and its occupants (p. 6). The work proceeds in six chapters. The first (“Introduction”) outlines the methods, sources, and  goals of the work as well as its relation to previous scholarship. The second (“The Concept of the  Kerala House”) provides necessary background on Kerala culture as it relates to the houses studied.  This is mostly a summary from other scholarly sources. The third (“Śāstric Principles and the Kerala  Four-House Mansion”) is a highly technical and useful discussion of the Sanskrit architectural tradi- tion that pays particular attention to two architectural texts from Kerala, the Vāstuvidyā (VV) and  Manuṣyālayacandrikā (MC). (Excerpts of both and passages on architecture from a few other Sanskrit  sources are given without translation as Appendices 1a and 1b, respectively.) The non-specialist is apt  to find parts of this chapter obscure, as the author seems to assume familiarity with some relatively  esoteric concepts. A generous glossary of architectural terms (Appendix 2c) ameliorates this difficulty  somewhat, but not entirely. The fourth chapter (“Architecture of the Actual Kerala Houses”) is the high- light of the book. Here the author presents the data from his field research. He describes the houses in  detail with helpful reference to the many plates and tables at the end of the book, discussing regional  variations and noting points of contact between the houses and the plans described in the VV and MC.  This chapter is also highly technical, and the reader will be rewarded for having paid careful attention  to earlier chapters. The fifth (“Social and Ritual Aspects of the Kerala High-Caste House”) outlines  rules governing access to the catuḥśālas and data on the performance of daily, calendrical, and life  rituals in the houses. Here Schildt has taken data from his informants and applied it to anthropological  studies, primarily iyer’s (1909–12) The Tribes and Castes of Cochin I–III. The final chapter (“Conclu- sion”) presents the general results of the study, which are discussed next. In the course of the work Schildt admirably achieves his primary goal: the description of the  catuḥśāla in both architectural and ritual terms. His careful selection and meticulous study of the  manors indeed allows for an intimate and archetypal encounter with the houses. The student of South  Asian architectural history will find a trove of fine-grained, technical observations about the tradition  with reference to texts, built structures, and ritual practice. Schildt also succeeds, even if only with  “preliminary” results, in sketching out “Pan-Kerala” (p. 157–60), regional (pp. 81–87), and caste-based  (pp. 160–63) characteristics among the houses. And from this comparative study, further conclusions  emerge: the “directional reference line [of the houses] could be [the] south-west, north-east diagonal  </page> <page sequence="3"> 744 Journal of the American Oriental Society 134.4 (2014) instead” of the more typical “west-east axis . . . of the Vedic agnicayana sacrificial area, or even from  an ordinary temple compound” (p. 158); variations observed in house plans might be based on the  option to place the underlying anthropomorphic ritual diagram (vāstupuruṣamaṇḍala) either “on his  back” or “face down” (pp. 169); the eastern orientation of the catuḥśāla refers not to the location of the  main entrance but to a numerical value assigned to the eastern direction that is encoded in the plan of  the house (p. 164); “the vāstu [‘site’] is the representation of . . . the institution of householdership and  membership of the household . . . understood as a representation of the human body—or a microcosm  in human form” (p. 170). Schildt also succeeds at illustrating in detail the various ways in which the houses appear to agree  with the instructions of the Sanskrit manuals (pp. 89–92, 163–65) and the dimensions of traditional  South Asian geomancy (pp. 165–73). He stops short, however, of exploring the significance of these  agreements, either by contextualizing them against areas of disagreement or by examining what they  might say, for example, about the relationship between śāstra (technical manuals) and practice in the  history of Kerala architecture more generally. In general, the text would have benefited from the more explicit articulation of a unifying problem- atic. Chapters and sections frequently begin with no introduction and end with no conclusion. In these  cases the reader is not told how the author sees the various parts of the text relating to the whole, to the  detriment of the study generally. Schildt, moreover, identifies many agreements between field data from  the houses and various, heterogeneous textual sources (e.g., the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, the Gṛhyasūtras,  medieval architecture texts, early-twentieth-century gazetteers, and contemporary anthropology), but  there is little in the way of critical engagement with the sources that might help draw out the rela- tive significance of the agreements or disagreements documented by the author. As such, documented  points of contact remain ambiguous with regard to the historical relationship between textual sources  and practice. Following the text itself are three appendices. The first gives excerpts from Sanskrit architectural  texts without translation, mainly the VV and MC. The second appendix has three glossaries: of names,  of ritual terms, and of architectural terms. All of these include both Sanskrit and Māḷayalam vocabu- lary, and the last is of particular value, making reference to the VV and MC as well as the figures,  tables, and plates of the text. The third appendix is a series of tables, the first five of which collate infor- mation on ritual diagrams from the Sanskrit texts and the remaining thirty of which collate data on the  catuḥśālas themselves. Greater editorial care would have helped the book, as errors are not infrequent  and the writing is sometimes obscure, particularly as the content becomes more abstract and complex. In all, Schildt’s work is a scholarly achievement that will exert great influence for a long time to  come. The text fruitfully analyzes much of the primary and secondary textual material bearing on  our understanding of the catuḥśāla and presents invaluable data from the author’s fieldwork. It is  highly recommended to all who have an interest in traditional South Asian architecture, geomancy, and  domestic ritual and provides much useful data to those interested in the relationship between śāstra  and practice.
