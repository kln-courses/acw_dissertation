<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art Forgery: Some Scientific Defenses STUART FLEMING* University Museum, University of Pennsylvania T o a large extent, forgers make a success of their chosen profession through sheer nerve rather than any out- standing artistic or technical talents. Tacti- cally planned, high pressure salesmanship in the art market is used to camouflage a lack of skill, and can indeed turn a sow's ear into a silk purse. Looking back through history, it is true that there are notable exceptions to these cynical generalizations. The Vermeer forger, Han van Meegeren, would probably be accounted most proficient at his trade (see fig. 1), though I have always felt that the mid-nineteenth-century sculptor, Giovanni Bastianini, and the early nineteenth-century coin counterfeiter, Carl Wilhelm Becker, were his technical equals. And I share a con- sensus view that the sculptor, Alceo Dossena, would have escaped detection altogether if only he had persevered with his forte-Ma- donna figures in the style of the fourteenth century Tuscan school-instead of trying to mimic the enigmatic smiles of Etruscan fig- urative statuary.' The nineteenth-century tale of the decep- tion of Alberto de la Marmora is, however, more typical of the incidents that make up the general history of forgery. When, after several years of amateur exploration of Sar- dinia, this Italian general had amassed a huge collection of grotesque (and totally spurious) stick-like bronze figurines, his suppliers went * Scientific Director, Museum Applied Science Center for Archaeology, The University Museum, 33rd and Spruce Streets, Philadelphia, Pa. 19104. so far as to fabricate a fifteenth-century sketchbook by a certain Michele Gili (notary of the southern Sardinian port of Cagliari) to substantiate their provenance. Worse was to follow though, because this extra docu- mentary evidence was enough to draw sev- eral of la Marmora's friends into a search for parallels to the bronzes amid the mythology of some truly obscure cultures. Intriguing links were soon established with idols from an ancient Slavonic tribe known as the Obo- trites; intriguing, in that those idols were also ingenious forgeries produced only a century 2 or so earlier. How is it then that scarcely a month passes without a new scandal in the headlines: con- troversy over Hitler's diaries, Constable's paintings, and Michelangelo's sketches? Is the art world really so gullible? I think not. Two effects, it seems, have either together or independently led to gross errors in visual appraisal of some of the more notorious fakes. The first I term "contemporary blind- ness," a fault that can be readily illustrated by study of such works as Icilio Joni's Mon- tefeltro Family (fig. 2). This was late fifteenth- century Florentine in conception, but con- tained one glaringly anachronistic element of high Parisian fashion ca. 1920 that raised no eyebrows until at least a decade after the work appeared on the market. In similar vein, the nineteenth century Viennese gold- smith, Weininger, was audaciously success- ful when he copied a pair of elaborate os- tensories during their restoration on behalf of the Austrian Imperial Treasury and re- turned his own versions to his employers: PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, VOL. 130, NO. 2, 1986 175</page><page sequence="2">176 STUART FLEMING this despite the fact that he modernized sev- eral of the original architectural features and could not resist the addition of long strands of neo-Gothic foliage.3 The other effect could be called one of "pressurized judgment," and can be typified by the situation in 1965, when a number of leading museums each purchased a double- headed anthropomorphic vase with inlaid obsidian eyes, accepting the alleged prove- nance of an obscure cemetery close to the official excavations at the Turkish site of Ha- cilar. Almost all were fake, a fact that became only too obvious when the data bank for comparative material-the site's formal publication-was made available some five years later.4 It is these effects, along with the interest of certain auction houses who want to hold down insurance premiums on the promise to refund monies gained by erroneous attri- bution, that have been the stimulus for a current growth in science's involvement in art analysis. That involvement is not always particularly deep: perhaps just the identifi- cation of a machine-made element in the paper of an early manuscript, or of a resin vehicle in the false patination of a bronze. Other times, however, a more sophisticated approach is necessary; the tapping of re- sources in modern technology that, in many instances, are scarcely a decade old.5 How best can I illustrate the extent to which scientific methods are used in this way today? There are so many different artistic media that coverage of even a few of them would be a daunting task. Instead I have in- cluded here a brief photographic "rogue's gallery" which draws examples from ceram- ics, coins, and metal statuary, the story be- hind each artifact being covered in an ex- tended caption (figs. 3-5). For the remainder of this paper, I focus on the authenticity of paintings; in fact, on just two technical ap- proaches to the problems of their analysis- X-radiography and individual pigment anal- ysis-since they are the most commonly used approaches in the museum world.6 BEYOND THE EYE The kind of information to be gleaned from X-radiography can be illustrated by a recent study of Titian's Venus with a Mirror, now in the National Gallery of Art, Wash- ington, D.C. (fig. 6). The visible painting comprises a voluptuous, near-naked Venus contemplating her beauty in a mirror which is held by a chubby, naked cupid. Radio- graphs were produced by fixing a photo- graphic film in contact with the surface and exposing it to X-rays directed onto the rear of the canvas support. With startling clarity, an underlying painting of a portrait group that runs across the canvas's breadth emerges, the armored shoulders of the man to the right allowing immediate identification of its subject-Allegory, another version of which now hangs in the Louvre.7 The reason why all this detail can be seen is because the X-rays are absorbed by the heavier elements in the pigments used in both the surface and the underlying painting, particularly by the lead in the lead white used in the flesh tones. For a standard X-ray wavelength of 0.71 Angstrom (where 1 Angstrom = 1lo- cm), an effective mass ab- sorption coefficient (,u/p) can be calculated for a lead white paint film as: (P)e 1 + A {Qp)p + pAQ} where the suffices, p and o, refer to the pig- ment and oil vehicle respectively, and A is the ratio (by weight) of the vehicle to pig- ment. The effective density of the paint film can also be estimated, via the equation: Pe = (1 + A) -POPP po + App so that the degree of attenuation of the X-ray beam's intensity which occurs across</page><page sequence="3">ART FORGERY 177 a paint layer of thickness, z, can be estimated from the exponential function: exp{-( P) ex} In a region where the lead white layer is around 100 microns thick, with A = 0.2, less than 7 percent of the initial X-ray intensity will reach the film detector.8 Relative to lead white most of the other pigments in the traditional palette are trans- parent to X-rays (fig. 7). For example, the ubiquitous iron oxide pigments which we call ochers, for a similar A-value and applied layer thickness, will suppress the X-ray beam intensity by less than half. Also, neither the two grounds usually used to prime the sur- face of the canvas-chalk (CaCO3) and gyp- sum (CaSO4 * 2H20)-nor possible organic glazes, such as madder (colored by alizarin, C14H804), can cause any significant back- ground to blur the X-ray image. Only other lead-bearing pigments such as the lead an- timonate, known as Naples yellow, and the mercury sulfide, known as vermilion (or cin- nabar red), have an X-ray absorption capac- ity which is comparable to that of lead white, and they were usually used relatively spar- ingly in European paintings. The only prac- tical limitation to a crisp resolution of an un- derpainting is the superposition of two lead white layers.9 There is now an extensive literature on studies similar to this Titian example, since good canvases and oak panel supports have always been an expensive item in an artist's budget. Under Un Homme poussant un Canon, by Thomas Couture (1815-1879), lies a con- trasting profile of a nude man; under Fran- cesco Goya's portrait of the army officer, Al- berto Foraster, lies a portrait of Manuel Goday (secretary of state to Carlos IV of Spain in 1793) by the relatively minor artist, Jose Castano de Pinho.10 Forgers, too, could not afford waste and often sought out old canvases and panels of roughly the correct period to enhance the apparent antiquity of their products. But some anachronisms still crept in, such as the reuse of a nondescript abstract work, datable to about 1915, beneath an attempt to imitate Picasso's Absinthe Drinker in the modern master's "blue period" style of about 1903. And the State Gallery in Stuttgart now have in store a Holy Antony Eremita that was once attributed to Bernard Strigel, but was actually produced almost two centuries after the master's death. Its underpainting is datable to 1713.11 An X-ray detail from a Madonna and Child by Robert Campin (active 1406-1444), in the National Gallery in London, illustrates an- other investigative power of X-radiography. The right-hand portion of the panel mount- ing is clearly a replacement section of inferior quality wood. It is riddled with wormholes that now stand out because they became filled with lead white paint that was used to prime the addition's surface (fig. 8). A similar study at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London unmasked a Triptych in the style of the fifteenth-century Sienese school as a fake, not only because the panel was damaged with worm holes, but also because long ma- chine-made nails had been used to pin the frame to the central board."2 Could a forger protect himself against de- tection by X-radiography? Much would de- pend upon the level of his patience. Han van Meegeren showed the way, by stripping away the remnants of paint on dilapidated works that were contemporaneous with Vermeer's artistic growth phase in the 1650s, thereby removing potential evidence of an- achronisms in the underpainting. The very fact that this deception is practically possible immediately requires that we find other de- fenses against the forger, and experience has shown that few are more effective than the direct analysis of the pigments used in the visible painting.</page><page sequence="4">178 STUART FLEMING PALETTE ERRORS The starting point for the study of pigment layers is the taking of a group of scalpel-thin sections at various strategic points across the surface of the painting. Each section, once mounted in a resin and surface polished, provides a stratigraphy of color. Each layer comprises clusters of pigment grains of varying size, all embedded in a now age- hardened matrix of the original vehicle for the paint's application (e.g., linseed or walnut oil). At microscopic magnifications of about lOOX, the pigment grains exhibit such char- acteristic optical properties that pigment identification is rapid and rarely ambiguous. For example, among the traditional blue pig- ments, the splintered-glass edges of smalt sharply contrast with the cleanly fractured edges of natural ultramarine crystals, while the latter's lack of optical birefringence sets it apart from azurite. Additionally, pigments produced in relatively modern times by the controlled chemistry of precipitation stand out by virtue of their roundness and unifor- mity of particle size.13 Failing confident identification at this stage, individual particles of pigment can be separated out for microchemical analysis. Each pigment has a characteristic reaction to certain sequences of chemistry. For example, the mercury in vermilion (HgS) forms mer- cury chloride needles when a droplet of the nitric acid/hydrochloric acid mixture, aqua regia, is applied. These needles convert to deep blue prisms of cobalt mercuric thiocy- anate when a droplet from a solution of co- balt acetate and potassium thiocyanate is added. Vermilion cannot therefore be con- fused with its modern substitute, cadmium red (CdS:Se), which responds quite differ- ently to these chemical treatments. The identification of its cadmium content calls for observation of a complex reaction involving p-nitrophenylcarbazide as the activating re- agent. 14 Once the pigment is identified, we have to look at its position in the history of pig- ments. When and where was it first avail- able? At this point, we can fall back on what is now a highly developed data bank of knowledge about the chronology of past pigment usage. Most of this comes from purely documentary sources, but some is from direct microchemical analysis of pal- ettes portrayed in studio studies, such as Francis Hayman's Self Portrait (ca. 1742), Francesco Goya's Marchioness of Villafranca (ca. 1820) and Vincente Lopez y Potana's Portrait of Goya (1827), among many others. Even a few artist's palettes have survived, with the pigments laid out on them exactly as they would have been used (see, e.g., fig. 9). They include Camille Pissarro's Pastoral Scene (ca. 1878) painted directly onto the palette itself, and those of the Fauvists, Andre Derain (1880-1954) and Henri Ma- tisse (1869-1954).15 As for the documentary sources, if we consider blue pigments at this stage, we know that prior to the mid-fifteenth century the choices available to European artists were limited to the following: a, azurite, a copper carbonate mineral imported from Hungarian sources, b, ultramarine blue, prepared from lapis lazuli, a precious mineral then available only at mines at the head of the Oxus river in Afghanistan, and c, the dyestuff, indigo, prepared by vat-steeping the leaves of In- digofera plants, and imported from India and/or the French West Indies, according to the prevailing political climate (fig. 10). As far as the color merchants of the principal art centers of Italy, The Netherlands, France, and England were concerned, the long dis- tances each of these pigments had to travel made them problematic in terms of cost and certainty of availability. They were eager, as were their artist clients, to find man-made pigments that could serve as substitutes in the traditional palette.16 Such a palette change did occur when the</page><page sequence="5">ART FORGERY 179 exploitation of Saxony's cobalt deposits led to the growth of a blue glass industry which, in turn, provided the pigment, smalt, as one of its byproducts. (The earliest known use of smalt in a European easel painting is cur- rently credited to Michael Pacher in The Early Father's Altar, created ca. 1483, and now in the Bavarian State Museum in Munich.) Then, in about 1705-the event is not pre- cisely chronicled-a German chemist, Franz Diesbach, carried out an experiment which, by pure chance, was to change the course of pigment history. One evening he was busy concocting a Florentine lake, when he real- ized that he had run short of one of its in- gredients, potash. Rather than wait until the morning to obtain a fresh batch, he went to a colleague, Johann Dippel, whom he knew required that ingredient for his research on the production of animal oils for medical purposes. He was able to borrow sufficient waste potash to complete pigment produc- tion: or so he thought, because the pigment that emerged was blue, not red. In fact, Diesbach had produced for the first time what became known as Prussian blue, a po- tassium ferric ferrocyanide which resulted from an interaction between Dippel's nitro- gen-rich animal waste and his own other in- gredient, iron vitriol.'7 The impact of this pigment's arrival was almost immediate (though English painters responded to it rather more coolly than their European counterparts), and its availability and its low cost soon assured its spot in the palette to the detriment of its rivals. Azurite and smalt (which was coming under in- creased criticism because of an occasional tendency to discolor after application) were used but rarely by the mid-eighteenth cen- tury, and even natural ultramarine, despite a legendary reputation, lost some of its tra- ditional dominance.18 Thereafter, as the chemical revolution of the eighteenth century gained momentum, the course of pigment history was far less haphazard. Brandt isolated the elemental cobalt in 1735, thereafter stimulating two German chemists, Gahn and Wenzel, each to produce cobalt blue (CoO * A1203) in 1777. (This pigment's earliest known use is in 1789, in Johann Edlinger's Portrait of a Lady, which is now in the Bavarian State Museum in Mu- nich.) Then, in 1828, Guimet perfected an artificial form of ultramarine that cost only a fraction of the imported lapis lazuli form. This gave man-made pigments almost com- plete supremacy in the blue section of the palette throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century.19 It is within the framework of this pigment documentation that several fake paintings have lost illustrious pedigrees. For example, an Icescape attributed to the Dutch Lowlands master, Albert Cuyp (1620-1691), and once on display at the Bavarian State Museum in Munich (fig. 11), has had to be reassigned because of the Prussian blue used in the sky, as has a Saint Sebastian attributed to Perugino (1446-1553) and held by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, because of the cobalt blue used in its execution. Similarly, we must fault a Portrait of a Man that was recently studied at the Doerner Institute in Munich, because the presence of artificial ultramarine is totally inconsistent with its original attri- bution to Barthel Bruyn (1493-1553).2o The story of the evolution of the yellow section of the palette over the past few cen- turies is somewhat similar to that of the blue one. Prior to the seventeenth century, choice was limited to: a, massicot (otherwise known as lead-tin-yellow, Pb2SnO4), the origins of which are uncertain, and b, ochers of various hues, prepared from naturally occurring iron oxide ores. (Orpiment-the sulfide of ar- senic, As2S3-was an alternative to these, but an unpopular one since its arsenic content made it poisonous and offensive smelling.) Then another glass colorant, the lead anti- monate known as Naples yellow, was intro- duced as an alternative to yellow ocher. Ar-</page><page sequence="6">180 STUART FLEMING tists were using this pigment at least 140 years before de Bondaroy's formal synthesis of its composition, as Pb3(SbO4)2, in 1776. Vacquelin's isolation of elemental chromium, in 1798, led to the development and usage of the pigment chromium yellow (PbCrO4) just over a decade later; and Stromeyer's iso- lation of elemental cadmium, in 1817, in- spired the production of the pigment cad- mium yellow (CdS) early in the 1830s. By this time, massicot seems to have been totally eclipsed.21 Among fakes that have been detected by their anachronistic use of these artificial yel- lows, a Still Life purchased by the St. Louis Art Museum in 1942 deserves special men- tion (fig. 12). It was initially attributed to the Spanish master, Francisco de Zurburan (1598-1664), but came under suspicion when it was learned that there was an almost identical version of it in the Norton Simon Foundation's collection in Pasadena. Once the paintings were placed side-by-side, a group of experts visually adjudged the St. Louis work to be somewhat inferior and downgraded its attribution to Zurburan's son, Juan. Even that late seventeenth-century dating could not be sustained, however, once cadmium yellow had been detected in the lemons clustered on the platter at the left side of the painting.22 Other colors provide similar results in au- thenticity analysis. For example, the pigment, zinc white (ZnO), only became available af- ter Henckel's isolation of elemental zinc in 1721, and a report on its potential as a pig- ment was written by Guyton de Morveau in 1782. It therefore had no place on a Portrait of an Old Woman which, while briefly at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, was attrib- uted to the sixteenth-century Master of Bruges; or on a Merry Cavalier that was at- tributed to Frans Hals (1580-1666), the whole question of its authenticity culminat- ing in a much reported court action in 1925, known as "Muller and Co. v. de Haas."23 SUBTLE DEFENSES What if we were to assume that the forger knew all about the pigment chronology out- lined above? There is no reason why he (or she) should fall into the trap of palette an- achronism. Azurite and lead-tin-yellow, separately and mixed to form a green would fill three spots in the traditional palette. Add vermilion, bone black and lead white, and the palette array would be faultless. Not quite, it seems. The possible flaw here is, surprisingly enough, in the choice of lead white. It is true that it is the most ubiquitous pigment in Western oil painting-its popu- larity stems from its homogeneity and den- sity of coverage. It is also true that it is the most fully documented, in technological terms .24 The earliest accurate recipes for the making of lead white appear in Roman times, most notably in the writings of Pliny. The lead sul- fide ore, galena, was roasted and smelted to produce raw lead metal. This in turn was bent into a set of buckles (each looking rather like a pretzel) that could be stacked amid fer- menting grape skins or dung. Fermentation produced acetic vapors and carbon dioxide that chemically attacked the surfaces of the buckles to yield a coating of lead white pig- ment. This was then scraped away, ground, and stored for the artist's usage. This method of production remained essentially the same until the eighteenth century, at which time Dutch manufacturers modified it by replacing dung with waste tanner's bark to increase the heat of fermentation. In the 1790s, however, a certain degree of mechanization was introduced into the manufacturing process, the buckles being squeezed through brass rollers so that the pigment flaked away into a water bath be- low. In this way the initial handling of the pigment was minimized and the risk of the lead poisoning of employees was much re- duced. The pigment itself was slightly altered</page><page sequence="7">ART FORGERY 181 by this treatment, not in its bulk composition but in its trace impurity content. To be spe- cific, whereas a zinc impurity level of more than two parts per million (ppm) in an Old Master would be exceptional, the abrasion of the brass rollers now introduced zinc contamination levels in the range of 15 to 70 ppm.25 Improved safety conditions soon encour- aged the pigment companies to mechanize lead white production even further. Hand- grinding gave way to the use of milling ma- chines that were linked to extractor fans so that the air of the workshops was kept rel- atively free of residual pigment dust. At the same time, zinc white was gaining popularity as a water color, so it was often passed through the milling units just ahead of the lead white. As a consequence the level of zinc contamination was increased again. A 200 ppm level became common among lead whites produced over the period 1810-1850. More changes came in the 1840s, as a lengthy period of research on ways to make zinc oxide compatible with an oil vehicle be- gan to bear fruit (see fig. 13). Zinc white was able to rival lead white on the basis of cost but lacked the latter's hiding power, so it became common for the lead white, as sold, to be adulterated by the cheaper pigment. From about 1870 onward, therefore, the zinc contamination level often exceeds 1 percent. Similar levels are also common today be- cause one of the modern purification meth- ods for lead is an extraction procedure in- volving molten zinc. The detection of zinc has greatly increased in sensitivity in recent years, making the dis- tinction between a modern fake and an Old Master a relatively simple matter in this nu- clear age. Most nuclear reactor facilities pro- vide a convenient source of thermal neutrons (of energy ranging 0 to 1 electron volt) that can be used for activation analysis of ele- ments in a lead white sample a mere 0.1 mg in weight. When an element's atomic nucleus ab- sorbs a neutron the resulting compound nu- cleus is unstable and breaks down by radio- active decay. This decay involves emission of gamma-rays which have energies and de- cay half-lives that are characteristic of the element from which they originate. The in- tensity of the emission is proportional to the concentration of the element present in the sample irradiated. For example, the activa- tion data for zinc can be summarized as: 64Zn (n, y)65Zn El: 2.01 X 105 and 11.40 X 105 electron volts t1/2 = 250 days. Not every collision between a neutron and an atomic nucleus results in a capture reac- tion. Instead, the process is controlled by what is termed a "capture cross-section," o: the larger the cross-section, the more likely the neutron capture. For zinc, a = 0.5 X 10-24 cm2, which is quite small compared with that, say, either of copper ( = 3.9 X 10-24 cm2) or of antimony ( = 30 X 10-24 cm2). Consequently the minimum level of zinc that can be detected in this way is close to 1 ppm. As, however, the outline of lead white's his- tory indicates, this is quite adequate for the solution of the bulk of authenticity problems we expect to meet. Zinc is not the only element that can pro- vide authenticity information of this kind. During the two decades around 1850 there was a marked change in lead white's silver impurity, from a steady level of close to 22 ppm in earlier works to close to 4 ppm among later nineteenth-century paintings. (This is thought to link to the replacement of the conventional cupellation method of silver extraction from galena ores by the more ef- ficient Pattinson and Parkes processes.) At much the same time, the pigment's copper impurity dipped significantly, from about 200 ppm prior to 1860 to 60 ppm or less after that date. Failing all this elemental analysis, the would-be twentieth-century forger might</page><page sequence="8">182 STUART FLEMING still be ensnared by one other little known, yet quite radical, change in lead white tech- nology that was implemented by one of the main pigment manufacturers in the United States, the National Lead Company. For some years they have been marketing a "pearlescent white" which is still a lead car- bonate-chemically it is 4PbCO3. 2Pb- (OH)2 * PbO-but with a crystalline structure which is quite distinct from that of the tra- ditional lead white type. This shows up most clearly in their respective X-ray diffraction patterns (fig. 14).26 CONCLUDING COMMENTS I could describe several more scientific techniques that aid in the judgment of au- thenticity of paintings: techniques which, if added to the essential initial studies of X-radiography and pigment analysis, would give full credit to my belief that it is impos- sible for a forger to avoid every trap that science could set for him. That is not to say, however, that I expect the prevalence of for- geries to drop significantly over the coming years. The structure of the art market, with its emphasis on the development of a per- sonal rapport between dealer and client and its sometimes unfortunate stress on confi- dentiality, insures that there is ample op- portunity for the authentic and the forged to be commingled. And if a specific test acts as a deterrent for forgery in one artistic me- dium (as thermoluminescence analysis has done, to some extent, in the ceramics mar- ket), there are so many other media that can be exploited with near immunity. Where, for example, is the scientific means of authen- ticating Classical gold jewelry or Indian Buddhist stone sculpture, Cycladic marble figurines, or Expressionist paintings?27 Perhaps the impetus to fake art is an in- trinsic part of the human psyche, and to stultify the forger's impulse may, in the long term, rob art scholarship of something vital to its methods of critical appraisal: a bench- mark against which more original skills can be measured.

This sketch of Han van Meegeren catches him in a pensive mood during his trial in 1945. He stood accused of being a Nazi collaborator, involved in the sale of a Vermeer work, called The Woman taken in Adultery, to Hermann Goering some three years earlier. Since the crime carried the death penalty, van Meegeren's defense-that he had painted this and several other recently heralded Vermeer works himself-was initially treated skeptically. After, however, he produced another Verneer-style painting, Jesus amongst the Doctors, under police provision, and described how he had given the other works an antique texture (using an artificial formaldehyde resin instead of an oil medium), it was only a few months before the charges were reduced to just an accusation of forging artists' signatures. The court's sentence of one year's imprisonment was never carried out. Van Meegeren suffered a heart attack, was admitted to hospital and died soon after.

The Montefeltro Family, once attributed to the late fifteenth-century artist, Melozzo da Forli, is now recognized as the work of Icilio Joni who, in The Affairs of a Painter (1936), documented all the techniques he had developed to age his fake paintings artificially. His most serious mistake was to give the man a cap with a checkered border band that was unknown in the fashion circles of Renaissance Florence, but very much in vogue in Paris in 1923, when the designer Bakst was at the height of his career.

The problem of forgery among Etruscan art reared its head in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, when excavation in the region of Cerveteri (about 30 km northwest of Rome) first drew attention to that mystical and somber Italian civilization. Jewelry was the initial focus of attention, after Fortunato Cas- tellani revived the ancient technique of granulated dec- oration in gold, but interest soon turned to terracotta after the Campana wall paintings were put on exhibition at the Louvre. Early plunderers stripped the Etruscan necropoli long before archaeologists learned of their whereabouts, and forgers were quick to mix their prod- ucts into the stock of genuine pieces circulating the market. The terracotta plaque illustrated here, Arkesilas at the Silphium Store, is one of a group of such artifacts that appeared in Munich sometime after 1963. In 1971, it was established as a fake, using the thermoluminescence dating method (see note 6), and identified as a pastiche of a scene from a famous Laconian kylix depicting the Cyrenean king that is now in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, and a scene sculptured on a metope panel from the sanctuary of Hera that was found at the mouth of the river Sele. Some features of this group of fake wall paintings suggest that they were transferred by some mechanical means from photographs in leading art books. (Courtesy of Hans Jucker, Basel.) K N: yi: FIG. 4. When the American China Trader, Rapid, sank off the coast of western Australia in 181 1, its cargo became a 'time capsule" of prevalent trading practices. The ship was raised five years ago, and the artifacts from it have become the subject of an intense technical study. Among the artifacts recovered was what appeared to be a Spanish silver dollar (8 real) that dated 1796 and bore the mint mark of Mexico and the assayer's initials, FM. (The illustration here shows both its obverse and its reverse.) But it had an odd laminated structure, and this stimulated an investigation of its structure using corrosion potential polarography. When a metal is exposed over a long period to an aerated electrolyte such as sea water, an electrical potential develops within the metallic structure as a combined result of localized oxygen reduction and the metal's gradual oxidation. For silver the oxidation reaction leads to the formation of a thin film of silver chloride. The presence of a metal less noble than silver will result in a depression of the corrosion potential. In the case of the 1796 dollar this depression was observed because the core of the coin was a copper alloy. The coin appears to have been fabricated by attaching a 0.25 mm thick silver-rich sheet to the core, using a silver solder (approximately 72% Ag, 28% Cu) prior to rolling and stamping. The reason for this debasement, if not straightforward counterfeiting, is obscure, but the silver coating of bronze coins was one of the most common forgeries in antiquity. It has been documented in Romano-Britain and the Gallic Rhineland in the mid-third century AD (just before the official mints of Rome did it, in about AD 260), and it has been identified in a fragmented 1620 Rijksdaalder recovered from the wreck of the Dutch East Indiaman, Batavia, that went down off the coast of western Australia in 1629.

Thailand has become one of the main centers of art forgery today, and the city of Bangkok its entrep6t to Western markets. The forgeries are mingled with the numerous genuine artifacts that have been systemati- cally plundered from the ancient temple complexes which lie hidden in the tangled undergrowth of the eastern forests. The Standing Figure illustrated here was said to have been part of a cache of bronze statuary found, by chance, in the ruins of an eighth-century tem- ple situated near Pra Kon Chai, on the Thai/Cambodian border. It stands about 30 cm high, and the form oc- curred several times in the cache in a large variation of sizes. Three of these pieces reached the London art market, and were rumored to have been valued at more than $0.3 million. All were shown to be fakes, their metal being brass-a copper/zinc alloy, with a zinc content of more than 30%-not bronze. (The technology of brass manufacture was unknown in the Thai pen- insula until sometime in the seventeenth century.) Ad- ditionally, metallographic study indicated that an attempt had been made to create an artificial green pa- tination on the surface, by pickling the piece in some- thing like sulfuric acid. It has been said that the model for the facial features of this group of figurines was the salesman who handled their movement through Bang- kok.
