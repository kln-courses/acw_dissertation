<plain_text><page sequence="1">PATRICK D. MURPHY U niversity of California, Davis Reclaiming the Power: Robinson Jeffers's Verse Novels Robinson Jeff ers developed in the early 1920's the accentual prosody and narrative structure of his long poems in direct response to the primacy of the novel and as a self-consciously crafted alternative to modernist poetry. As William Everson notes, "Jeffers emerged at the height of the Modernist triumph, but of its aesthetic tenets he utilized only one. . . . the Modernists insisted that poetry must assimilate the techniques developed in the refinement of contemporary prose style. It was the chief break with the past that brought poetry up to date. Jeffers followed suit" (ix-x). As he notes in the foreword to his Selected Poetry , Jeffers shares with Ezra Pound the desire to wrestle the reading public free of the enthrallment of prose fiction : It became evident to me that poetry - if it was to survive at all - must reclaim some of the power and reality that it was so hastily surrendering to prose. The modern French poetry of that time, and the most "modern" of the English poetry, seemed to me thoroughly defeatist, as if poetry were in terror of prose, and desperately trying to save its soul from the victor by giving up its body, (xiv) Radcliffe Squires argues that "Jeffers' choice of form, then, was in part determined by a decision to risk meeting prose on its own ground" ( 145 ) -1 And throughout much of his life Jeffers envisioned his long poems in rela- tion to the popularity of the novel and the effect its rise had on dramatic and narrative verse ( Jeffers, Roan ix, Powell 206, Bennett 79 and 203) . With this self-awareness on Jeffers's part of creating a verse alternative to the modern novel in mind, one recognizes the insufficiency of criticism that tends to define his long poems as simply traditional narratives or classi- cal tragedies. In fact, generically defining his long poems has proven a sore point of Jeffers criticism. Many critics, hostile and sympathetic, analyze these poems against the requirements of classical tragedy or traditional</page><page sequence="2">126 Western American Literature narrative and find them wanting. Frederic Carpenter simply notes: "Cer- tainly his poems do not fit into any of the usual categories of literary criti- cism. His long poems are sometimes narrative, sometimes dramatic, some- times philosophic; they are usually a mixture of all three" (55). 2 Robert Brophy defines them as "ritual-tragedy," which he considers a genre paral- lel to the "medieval mystery play" (286). Unfortunately, this can encour- age an allegorical and symbol-hunting reading of Jeffers's long poems.3 A more helpful recognition is Robert DeMotťs view that Jeffers "chose the narrative technique and dramatic development employed in fiction and drama. The narrative structure provided Jeffers a means of preventing the lapsing intensity and abatement of lyricism which often besets the long poem" (411). I believe it is more fruitful to consider Jeffers's long poems examples of a developing genre, the modern verse novel, with the word "novel" used in Mikhail Bakhtin's dialogic sense of the term.4 As Michel Aucouturier puts it, "for Bakhtin the constitutive 'mode' of the novel is not epic narra- tion but dialogue; that is, the relation that is established . . . among several autonomous discourses in respect to which the author himself takes the position of an interlocutor and not of a sovereign master" (238). Jeffers's long poems from "Tamar" through "Hungerfield,"5 with the exception of the written-to-be staged dramas, reflect the novelization of verse in their author's aesthetic conception and in the prosodie realization of that con- ception.6 Jeffers designed verse novels to compete with prose novels for the attention of the reading public and to counteract the abandonment by modernist poets of previously held fictional terrain. In approaching Jeffers, one would expect to find the clearcut domina- tion of the monologic and homophonic, the unmistakable and single-toned authoritative voice of the prophet of doom and preacher of Inhumanism in accordance with the reputation delegated him by the New Criticism. While the narrative voice of several poems does display homophony, the main characters are clearly discernible as individual voices. Through these voices the dialogic appears as a representation of Jeffers's willingness to express openly the continuing philosophical debate unresolved within the text, that interaction of "autonomous discourses" : "Thus, a study of the patterns of ideas in the poems, rather than the quality of the poems, shows ideas emerging as speculative propositions" (Coffin 4). The dialogic also appears as a representation of Jeffers's belief that "tension" and "strain" dominate the movement of energy throughout the universe, with humanity merely a manifestation of such energy (see Nolte 24; Zaller 91-92). This</page><page sequence="3">Patrick D . Murphy 127 presence of unresolved debate and tension distinguishes Jeffers's verse novels from the epic genre, classical tragedy, and traditional romance. It also distinguishes his work from the bulk of English-language narrative poems written in the previous century. "Tamar" appeared initially in 1924, but attracted little notice. When reissued the next year as part of Roan Stallion , Tamar, and Other Poems , it received widespread attention because of its innovative prosody, its frank narration of taboo subjects, and its polemical challenge to popular ideol- ogy.7 "Tamar" relates the story of a heroine who attempts to gain freedom and power through incest, but who fails in that attempt because she is trapped by history and because she chooses a path that can lead only to disaster. She challenges her fate and in so doing reveals her heroic qualities, but she also seals her doom by not breaking out of the circle of humanity that empowers that fate to govern individual lives. The poem has a uniform prosody of accentual unrhymed verse that integrates the narrator's slightly elevated diction with the idiomatic dialogue of the characters. Diction and rhythm combine to produce a grave, formal tone appropriate to tragedy that demarcates Jeffers's narration from the dialects of his characters and from the idiom of contemporary prose narration. "Tamar" achieves a catharsis through pity and terror designed to shock readers into a new awareness that renders them open to the embryonic philosophy that appears in this the first of his inhumanist long poems. The narration is broken by occasional narrative commentary, asides in which the narrator speaks directly to the reader in some cases and to the characters in others. These interruptions clearly reflect their origin in the nineteenth-century novels Jeffers so fondly read aloud to his sons, but unlike the interjections in those novels Jeffers shifts back and forth from the reader as audience to the character as audience. As part of his adapta- tion of these elements to the verse novel, Jeffers uses them to dialogize the narrator's role, situating his voice between reader and character in dialogue with both. At times he situates this voice closer to the characters, in part by having both narrator and characters use the same phrases. At other times, he situates the voice closer to the reader by having the interjections function as a question to the reader or as a reply to an anticipated question from an imagined reader. The first interjection occurs fourteen lines into the poem: "The night you know accepted with no show of emotion the little accident" (3) .8 The narrative voice addresses the reader directly in order to comment philo- sophically on the event just narrated, as if, like Marlow's voice, it is respond-</page><page sequence="4">128 Western American Literature ing to a remark from a direct audience; but, unlike Conrad, Jeffers creates no internal audience for the story. This interjection establishes an analytical contrast between the emotion-driven human being just described and nature, which he futilely challenges. Some ten lines later, the narrator addresses the character: "You shipwrecked horseman / So many and still so many and now for you the last" (4) . The young man's drunken act of attempting to defy gravity is made small by the context of the long repeti- tive history of similar events. The defiance is only an act of conformity to the habitual behavior of humanity and foreshadows the repetitive nature of Tamar's own defiance. One interjection emphasizes the story as story to make a point, while the other emphasizes the independent validity of the character, not only as if "Tamar" were a true story but also as if the char- acters could respond to the narrator if they heard him speaking. Within the first thirty lines JefFers has placed his faceless narrator in dialogue with both reader and character.9 Soon the narrator intrudes again, speaking to the reader: "Youth is a troublesome but a magical thing, / There is little more to say for it when you've said / Young bones knit easily; he that fell in December / Walked in the February fields" (5). This interjection sets up contradictions that will become foci of later struggle. One, youth is both "troublesome" and "magical"; but, which side of this dialectic deserves and receives primary emphasis in a given life? The troublesome will lead to tragedy, the magical to comedy. In miniature, Jeffcrs has established the focus on conflict that will dominate virtually all of his long poems : centering the intelligence on self and on humanity proves "troublesome"; centering the intelligence on nature and the inhuman proves "magical." Philosophically, the statement reflects a monological, authoritatve position, but Jeffers does not present it as such; instead, he presents the issue of centering as a conflict-in-process, an open-ended struggle of opposites within each individual. And he pre- sents this utterance as a reply to an anticipated question from the reader: how could Lee be walking so soon? The other contradiction is implied by the phrase, "Young bcnes knit easily." The physical, the primitive, the instinctual, heal quickly; in contrast, the intellectual, the sophisticated, the rational, heal much more slowly, if at all. Although only implied at this point, Tamar's brother's own character development reflects this contra- diction. His initial burst of "magical" focusing on the inhuman is not sus- tained but is undone by his sister's seduction and the romantic appeal of war.</page><page sequence="5">Patrick D . Murphy 1 29 A key narrative interjection occurs in part III, just before Tamar's seduction of Lee. The seduction is prefaced by Tamar's expression of belief that having Lee will give her access to the patriarchal phallic power that has dominated her life. The narrator addresses the reader: Was it the wild rock coast Of her breeding, and the reckless wind In the beaten trees and the gaunt booming crashes Of breakers under the rocks, or rather the amplitude And wing-subduing immense earth-ending water That moves all the west that taught her this freedom? Ah Tamar, It was not good, not wise, not safe, not provident, Not even, for custom creates nature, natural, Though all other license were ; and surely her face Grew lean and whitened like a mask the lips Thinned their rose to a split thread, the little breasts Erected sharp bright buds but the white belly Shuddered, sucked in. . . . (9) Bill Hotchkiss considers the first half to represent a narrative voice that "expresses what closely approximates Tamar's own inner turmoil and is not Jeffers speaking in his own person"; but the second half causes him trouble because he sees the line "Not even, for custom creates nature, natural" as being in contradiction to Jeffers's overall viewpoint ( Sivaistic 169). He resolves this seeming contradiction by claiming : The sentiments expressed here are not to be taken as Jeffers "lectur- ing" his heroine, but rather as an example of narrative voice of a highly circumscribed nature, a narrative voice which assumes the limitations of a particular character's intellect and emotions, to the end of describing the inner turmoil being experienced by that char- acter but in words which are not at that moment available to the character in question. ( Sivaistic 169) I find this hardly convincing. Tamar has not yet coupled with her brother, and so has not taken on the knowledge of experience, nor has she up to this point evidenced any concern for the implications of environment on her own development. And I see no basis for claiming either that the narrator's words indicate or do not indicate Jeffers's beliefs. They are undoubtedly double-voiced, but at this point the reader cannot determine the direction of that double-voicing.10 Neither half of the interjection can be attributed to Tamar's own inner turmoil prior to her initiation into knowledge and "sin." The first poses a question for the reader, more strongly introducing the natural environment</page><page sequence="6">1 30 Western American Literature as a "character" in the story than have previous passages (See Squires 7; Nolte 4) . The second half responds to that initial question. The utterance is not directed toward Tamar, but is directed toward the reader. Prior to this interjection, the narrator had also used "Ah Tamar" in the course of a third-person description. Directly negating Hotchkiss's claim that "her desire for sexual knowledge of her brother may be seen as 'natural' " ( 149 ) is the narrator's explicit statement that it is "not even . . . natural" - not because Tamar seeks sexual knowledge - such seeking is heroic and part of "all other license" - but because she turns incestuously inward toward her- self and her family. This interjection introduces nature as an inhuman character participating in the action as a potential influence on the human characters and as an alternative source of knowledge and values, just as Tamar's father, David, is a source of knowledge and values. That is to say, nature represents one side of a philosophical debate within the poem, and the family patriarch another. And while nature has influenced Lee by turn- ing him outward from himself, Tamar does not accept it as an alternative to patriarchy. Instead, she seeks to take knowledge from inward sources - family, sibling, self. The second function establishes the tension between nature and humanity as two sources of knowledge, and between the inward and outward turnings for knowledge. Jeffers presents this tension as dia- logical by leaving the resolution open-ended, particularly given that Tamar has not yet acted. By presenting these functions through a question-and- answer narrative repartee, Jeffers dialogizes the utterance, thereby reducing its authoritative force. Part V begins with another interjection, this one an invocation of the Muse. The narrator asks for inspiration to guide the outcome of the poem and reiterates indirectly to the reader that the story exists to educate, the characters being merely "idols" for "God" "To enter and possess" (15) ; at the same time he implies that the resolution lies not with his authority but with the will of "God." The poem, however, does evidence a rising authoritative voice from this point on as Fate overpowers Freedom. Tamar rapidly narrows her freedom as she becomes increasingly committed to a single course of self-destructive action. Her efforts to rise beyond "good and evil" as a "will to power" give fate a greater grip on her destiny. As the resolution becomes more fated, the interjections become more authoritative as in the lines: God who makes beauty Disdains no creature, nor despised that wounded Tired and betrayed body. She in the starlight</page><page sequence="7">Patrick D . Murphy 131 And little noises of the rising tide Naked and not ashamed bore a third part With the ocean and keen stars in the consistence And dignity of the world. ... (29) The narrator, not Tamar, knows whether or not "God . . . / Disdains no creature." But again, this authoritative utterance is presented as a reply to an anticipated objection or question by the reader. And the interjections diminish until they utterly disappear from the latter part of the poem. At the end, it is not the narrator, nor Tamar, who has the final authoritative word, but the voiceless character too little learned from, nature : "all about there / The old trees, some of them scarred with fire, endure the sea wind" (64). The continuous narrative of "Tamar" is shot through with significant interjections introducing commentary and questioning that serve to empha- size the tensions in progress within the poem. Rather than being flaws of inconsistent narration, they function as another voice speaking, not as relativized as another character, but also not as authoritative as the direct voice of the poet, as some critics have inaccurately labelled it. Jeffers uses primarily a third-person omniscient narrator to present the story of Tamar, but he compromises that omniscience to reduce its authoritative force. He does this mainly through the interjections that render the narrator a respondent to both reader and characters. He also does this through having the narrator pull back occasionally from the realm of total knowledge to that of speculation. This reduction of authority is furthered by the invocation of the Muse, but is complicated by the invocation also serving to inform the reader that "Tamar" is a fiction : 0 beauty of the fountains of the sun 1 pray you enter a little chamber, I have given you bodies, I have made you puppets, I have made idols for God to enter And tiny cells to hold your honey. I have given you a dotard and an idiot, An old woman puffed with vanity, youth but botched with incest, O blower of music through the crooked bugles, You that make signs of sins and choose the lame for angels, Enter and possess. Being light you have chosen the dark lamps, A hawk the sluggish bodies : therefore God you chose Me! and therefore I have made you idols like these idols T o enter and possess. (15)</page><page sequence="8">132 Western American Literature The narrator, a fictional persona himself, admits to the reader his char- acters are fictional "puppets." The authority of the omniscient narrator is undercut by this admission of fictionality as well as the invoking of a higher authority, but the emphasis on that authority is lessened by the narrator's repeating "I" six times. Instead of serving to establish the narrator as mouthpiece for the channeling of divine truth, this interjection serves to bare a literary device, the epic invocation. By presenting the device and at the same time undercutting its historical function, this passage emphasizes the story as an individual author's fiction. Jeffers undercuts authoritative omniscience by admitting its illusory nature. Such reductions of authority serve to empower the reader as participant in the construction of the mean- ing of the text. Although the dialogue creates clearly distinguishable characters, they speak the same social dialect with little evidence of generational distinc- tions. This contributes, I believe, to the frequent claims that Jeffers does not create characters but merely vehicles for his philosophy (cf. Brophy 288; Squires 154) . In contrast, DeMott argues that Jeffers "portrayed the direct involvement of the speaking voice, and he was particularly concerned with the heightened quality of speech by characters in tension" (410). It is precisely this "heightened quality" that contributes to the homophonic resonance running through "Tamar," although the voices of the narrator and Tamar remain distinct through their differing tones. The homophony in "Tamar" arises not from a single authoritative voice, but from being permeated by a uniform rhythm and diction. As Aucouturier has said regarding Bakhtin's conception of "the con- stitutive 'mode' of the novel," "the author himself takes the position of an interlocutor and not a sovereign master" ( 238 ) . Jeffers sets up his narrator as just such an "interlocutor." He further relinquishes sovereignty by giving the last word to one of the characters, in this case nature. And, more than any specific detail or technical device, Jeffers renders "Tamar" dialogical by letting Tamar speak for herself and carry her misguided theory for gaining knowledge and power to its self-destructive end. Unlike tragedy or epic in which the outcome is foretold from the beginning, Jeffers presents a tragic story that need not end as such. It is not the act of incest but the course of inward-turning that dooms Tamar, and such a course can be turned from or transcended throughout the plot.11 "Tamar" is thus primarily dialogical rather than monological in terms of both the open-ended character of its plot and the double-voiced discourse of Tamar's speech. Aside from the narrator's criticism of Tamar's initial act</page><page sequence="9">Patrick D. Murphy 1 33 of incest, nowhere within the text does Jeffers reveal whether he agrees or disagrees with Tamar's statements. Jeffers allowsTamar to become a speak- ing subject rather than an object of authorial description, and Bakhtin's remark about Dostoevsky's treatment of character could be equally applied to Jeffers's treatment of Tamar: "The character is treated as ideologically authoritative and independent; [s]he is perceived as the author of a fully weighted ideological conception of h[er] own, and not as the object of [Jeffers's] finalizing artistic vision" ( Dostoevsky 5 ) . Jeffers not only has his narrators enter into dialogue with his char- acters and readers, but also has his long poems enter into thematic dialogue with one another. "Roan Stallion" and The Women at Point Sur were written soon after, and "Roan Stallion" presents a simpler and much briefer story than "Tamar."12 Squires argues that "taken together, Tamar and Roan Stallion reveal the double potential in Jeffers, the saga formula and the classical, the diffuse and the unified" (30) . Squires sees the "classi- cal" and the "unified" as characterizing a higher form of poetry because they demonstrate authorial control of material, whereas the "saga" demon- strates Jeffers's "undisciplined side." Such a distinction matters little if one understands both poems to be versions of the verse novel. But Squires makes an important distinction. "Tamar" requires more episodes and more "diffuse" events because Tamar needs opportunities to gain knowledge and to express her use of that knowledge. In "Roan Stallion," on the other hand, California remains inarticulate. Because the plot relies on actions without dialogue to impart the character's transformation, it remains relatively simple. "Roan Stallion" functions as a reply to "Tamar" in plot motivation, in the nature of its conclusion, and in the kind of protagonist Jeffers por- trays. The poem breaks into two contrasting halves, the first verging on Christian allegory and the second seemingly pagan in its pantheistic horse- god worship (see Alexander 91 ), so that the contradiction between Chris- tianity and Inhumanism is made more strongly than in "Tamar." The conclusion of "Roan Stallion" has produced even sharper critical disagree- ment, suggesting that the readers are required here, even more fully than in "Tamar," to work out the implications of the conclusion for themselves. "Roan Stallion" enters into dialogue with "Tamar" and "The Tower Beyond Tragedy" in its opening description of the female protagonist. Jeffers's describing her as "erect and strong as a new tower" immediately places her in comparison with Orestes and suggests that she, like him, may have the potential to transcend humanity.13 This comparison implicitly sug-</page><page sequence="10">134 Western American Literature gests a contrast with Tamar. But like Tamar - who shares with Electra the willingness to commit incest - California is a female protagonist, but a woman, not a girl. And rather than being contextually framed by a Biblical allusion, California is contextually framed by the natural allusion in her name to the land, an allusion reinforced by "a Scottish sailor had planted her in young native earth" (141).14 California is associated with nature and given an internal power, whereas Tamar is associated with the house and the powerlessness of a pubescent youth. Further, California is the mother of Christine, which links her to the New Testament with an emphasis on the maternal, while Tamar is linked with the Old Testament and the patriarchal. The story of California is broken mid-way by an interjection fre- quently considered Jeffers's first clear statement of Inhumanist doctrine : Humanity is the start of the race ; I say Humanity is the mould to break away from, the crust to break through, the coal to break into fire, The atom to be split. Tragedy that breaks man's face and a white fire flies out of it; vision that fools him Out of his limits, desire that fools him out of his limits, unnatural crime, inhuman science, Slit eyes in the mask ; wild loves that leap over the walls of nature, the wild fence-vaulter science, Useless intelligence of far stars, dim knowledge of the spinning demons that make an atom, These break, these pierce, these deify, praising their God shrilly with fierce voices : not in a man's shape He approves the praise, he that walks lightning-naked on the Pacific, that laces the suns with planets, The heart of the atom with electrons: what is humanity in this cosmos? For him, the last Least taint of a trace in the dregs of the solution ; for itself, the mould to break away from, the coal To break into fire, the atom to be split. ( 149-50) Critics almost invariably consider this statement monologically. Yet it con- tains its own internal tension, reflecting the strain between the effort to break free of the bounds of self-centered humanism and the persistent tendency to anthropomorphize and human-center the God-world in which humanity participates. "Their," "he," and "walks" reinstate the anthro- pomorphism and anthropocentrism that spontaneously surface in human</page><page sequence="11">Patrick D . Murphy 135 efforts to envision God. Each of the actions recommended to break out the white fire only partially succeeds. No single action, no matter how violent, fence-vaulting, or unnatural will accomplish this because the whole race must break free for individuals, even those who slit the mask, to break free. And this limitation also applies to the narrator of the poem, who is, like California, simply another individual. In part, this interjection comments back upon Tamar's inevitable failure. It also comments on California's successful effort to break free of the oppressive forces of humanity repre- sented by her sexually brutal husband while at the same time falling prey to anthropocentric tendencies. But because California remains inarticulate and the narrative voice is seen as a monological authority, some critics miss this tension within her consciousness and within the narrative commentary ( cf. Squires 1 65-66 ) . California initially resists this internal conflict. During her crisis in the early part of the story when she must ride bareback across a flooding stream, she has a Christian religious vision. In relating the story to her daughter, she emphasizes the miraculous Christian elements, denying the role of nature in the form of the horse. But as she tells Christine, she begins to confuse monotheism and pantheism, mixing religious and sexual desire: "God was his father : she was the stallion's wife - what did I say - God's wife" (148). California makes a greater break in the human mask than Tamar because she directs her struggle outward rather than inward. She cannot love her husband, so she loves the stallion. As William Nolte argues, "California attempts to love outward rather than inward, to do physically what Jeffers proclaims figuratively. Tamar instead attempts to become god, and so becomes the archetypal romantic, the totally self-centered, and so she is both self-destructive and destructive" (102-3). Critics have attempted to shield Jeffers from the charge that California consummates her love. Brophy argues that "nowhere is bestiality indicated; nowhere is it implied that California, as human , is attracted sexually to the roan as animar (106). Rather, California as animal is sexually aroused by the stallion as animal, just as her husband is sexually aroused by watching the stallion perform. She does not attempt to consummate the relationship because she dejectedly recognizes the physical impossibility: "Oh, if I could bear you !" ( 151 ) . But the sexual arousal itself positively emphasizes the natural relationship between humans and other animals. It is true that she yearns for release from her predicament through another miracle, and in this yearning confuses the stallion as animal with her image of the stallion as a god. In this imaging, she succumbs to anthropomorphizing both God</page><page sequence="12">1 36 Western American Literature and nature (see Nolte 109-10) . And Jeffers makes this self-creation of God explicit through his second narrative interjection. But, unlike Tamar, Cali- fornia realizes her error, ending her delusion through the action of taking the stallion up on the mountain. The second interjection requires some detailed attention. I quote it in full : The atom-bounds breaking, Nucleus to sun, electrons to planets, with recognition Not praying, self-equaling, the whole to the whole, the microcosm Not entering nor accepting entrance, more equally, more utterly, more incredibly conjugate With the other extreme and greatness ; passionately perceptive of identity. . . . The fire threw up figures And symbols meanwhile, racial myths formed and dissolved in it, the phantom rulers of humanity That without being are yet more real than what they are born of, and without shape, shape that which makes them : The nerves and the flesh go by shadowlike, the limbs and the lives shadowlike, these shadows remain, these shadows To whom temples, to whom churches, to whom labors and wars, visions and dreams are dedicate : Out of the fire in the small round stone that black moss covered, a crucified man writhed up in anguish; A woman covered by a huge beast in whose mane the stars were netted, sun and moon were his eyeballs, Smiled under the unendurable violation, her throat swollen with the storm and blood-flecks gleaming On the stretched lips ; a woman - no, a dark water, split by jets of lightning, and after a season What floated up out of the furrowed waler, a boat, a fish, a fireglobe? It had wings, the creature, And flew against the fountain of lightning, fell burnt out of the cloud back to the bottomless water . . . Figures and symbols, castlings of the fire, played in her brain; but the white fire was the essence, The burning in the small round shell of bone that black hair covered, that lay by the hooves on the hilltop. ( 153-54; ellipses in original) The first part up to Jeffers's ellipsis attempts to portray the ideal joining of the human back to nature, but it lasts only a moment as the cultural values of the race, which render each individual part of historical humanity,</page><page sequence="13">Patrick D. Murphy 137 reassert themselves within California's mind. Because California appropri- ately remains inarticulate, the narrator must describe this conflict between the epiphany of inhumanity - her "conjugate" identity with nature - and the inertia of religious values. For California, the dominant image that rises up is Christ crucified, and her mind oscillates between identity with the genuine natural epiphany and an imagined religious one. The third part suggests that "the white fire" overcomes the "Figures and symbols, castlings of fire." In this overcoming, California will free herself not only from the hold of Christianity but also from the anthropomorphism that caused her to turn the stallion into an icon. But at the same time that Jeffers is presenting the internal dialogue of California's mind, he also reduces the dialogic relationship between the narrator and the characters. The two interjections of "Roan Stallion" are far more authoritative and monological than the majority of interjections in "Tamar." They are more hierarchically distanced as utterances from the rest of the poem, and it is clear that the actions of California, unlike those of Tamar, basically align themselves with the ideological position of the narrator. Despite this presence of an authoritative voice, California still func- tions as a "speaking subject," who must rely on actions to replace words. At the end, she flees from her drunken husband and leads him to the stal- lion's corral. When the dog challenges the horse, California's husband comes in after her but is knocked down by the stallion and California screams. Christine, frightened at being left alone and hearing the scream, carries the father's rifle to her mother at the corral. California uses it not to save her husband but to kill the dog whose harrying of the stallion is making possible her husband's escape. Yet after the stallion has killed him, she acts unexpectedly : then California moved by some obscure human fidelity Lifted the rifle. Each separate nerve-cell of her brain flaming the stars fell from their places Crying in her mind : she fired three times before the haunches crumpled sidewise, the forelegs stiffening, And the beautiful strength settled to earth: she turned then on her little daughter the mask of a woman Who has killed God. The night-wind veering, the smell of the spilt wine drifted down hill from the house. (157) Having gained freedom from her husband, California kills the stallion. Carpenter explains the ending in this way: "Unlike Tamar, who follows</page><page sequence="14">138 Western American Literature her lawless nature to a wild end, California accepts the limits of the human condition. And the poem rejects the romantically possible ending in which the wild heroine and her stallion might have escaped from human society to run wild in a wild West" (67 ; see also DeMott 424) . John Alexander, in essentially recognizing this as an open-ended, dialogical conclusion, rejects simple allegorical interpretations : Had the poet's main purpose been to show the triumph of Inhu- manist over Christian love, he would have provided a smooth doc- trinaire resolution of the conflict at the end of the poem. Instead, it culminates in an ambiguous final scene. . . . Whatever her final allegiance, California demonstrates that human fidelity, however obscure, can still motivate human acts in Jeffers's scheme. (91-92) California gains freedom from two oppressive sources of the as yet unbroken coal of humanity. She frees herself from the oppression of her husband and the anthropomorphism of religious belief. To gain the first freedom she can allow nature to act, but to gain the second she must act and kill the god she has created. But the gaining of this second freedom does not render her a character realizing Jeffers's idealization of inhumanist doctrine. She kills the horse out of a still-conflicting consciousness. At the end she also wears a "mask," one strongly slit with an inhumanist epiphany, but one that still marks her as a member of humanity, and necessarily so. As the first interjection indicates, it is not simply the individual who must break into fire - an erroneous belief practiced by Tamar - but the entire race. Her fidelity to humanity, then, is finally positive rather than negative because she uses it to save not only herself but also her daughter. Jeffers developed California as a character who through her very inarticulateness resolves conflicts through action directed outward rather than inward, and so is more capable of breaking free of human oppression without self-destruction than Tamar. But at the same time, he created a character less capable of functioning as a "speaking subject," rendering a dialogical structuring of "Roan Stallion" more problematical. Even so, Jeffers creates, as in "Tamar," a character that does not entirely embody his own philosophy but one that explores her own road toward inhumanist freedom. Even with the increased monologism of "Roan Stallion," Jeffers creates a work true to his belief that the writer's responsibility is "not to form a way of thought but perhaps to activate thoughts" (Ridgeway 209 ) . In The Women at Point Sur , Jeff ers returns to a character more like Tamar than like California. The Reverend Barclay is Jeffers's most violent,</page><page sequence="15">Patrick D. Murphy 139 destructive, and vicious representative of one of the "blind alleys" in the search for the inhumanist path. Yet many critics find it impossible to deter- mine whether or not Barclay speaks for his creator as representative of a successful or failed search because Barclay speaks for himself, with only his actions demonstrating the unnatural perversion of his quest. He becomes a "speaking subject" dominating the second half of the poem, and has the final word when he declares, "I am inexhaustible" (175). Jeffers provides a unique "Prelude" for The Women at Point Sur . He begins it speaking in the first person, directly to the reader as author of the poem the reader has in hand. He asks: "But why should I make fables again?" and answers by quoting the lines about humanity being the start of the race in "Roan Stallion." Then he states: Well, now it is done, the mask slit, the rag burnt, the starting-post left behind : but not in a fable. Culture's outlived, art's root-cut, discovery's The way to walk in. Only remains to invent the language to tell it. Match-ends of burnt experience Human enough to be understood, Scraps and metaphors will serve. The wine was a little too strong for the new wine-skins . . . (9-10) Jeffers indicates here that "Roan Stallion" set the stage for individuals to try to break out of humanity and some have made the attempt. But such experience does not form the stuff of fables, so the poet must seek a new way to reveal the story of human experience. The Women presents the story of a particular attempt at slitting the mask. The final lines suggest the disjointed nature of the presentation to follow, emphasized by his trailing- off ellipsis, as well as indicating that the story will not tell of success. Much lies behind this opening section of "Prelude," including a strong awareness on Jeffers's part of the immediate audience for his poetry. This awareness presented here and in his letters belies critical claims that "Jeffers accepts and embraces an isolation which permits him to disregard his social environment in general and his audience in particular" (Squires 138), and indicates a clear cognizance of his society and his audience. While entering The Women into dialogue with "Roan Stallion," he enters as author into dialogue with his audience, indicating to them that this poem will reply to some of their readings of "Roan Stallion." It also enters into dialogue with readings of "Tamar" (Ridgeway 116). Jeffers is not abandoning his posi- tion that humanity is the mould to break out of ; rather, he is expressing an awareness of the facility with which human beings can botch the attempt.</page><page sequence="16">140 Western American Literature In so doing in the "Prelude," he emphasizes that The Women , like his other verse novels, is exploring "the way to walk in" to the road of Inhumanism. And this recognition of their exploratory nature dialogizes them by denying that any single poem can present a "solution" to the problem of humanity's introversion (see Nolte 171). Another aspect of the "Prelude" deserves mention. In addition to the direct authorial address and the dialogical relationship with previous verse novels, Jeffers also tells two stories. One, about the visionary Onorio Vasquez, serves as a gloss on the poem proper and suggests that the age of saviors has passed : today's visionary "never sees anything to the point" (15). The other tells of Myrtle Cartwrighťs natural passion for Rod Stewart, one to which she succumbs and one that is also outward directed in contradistinction to the inward-turning, self-destroying desire of Vas- quez. But although outward directed, the passion remains on a lower level because it lacks love. The "Prelude," then, sets two stories in debate with one another, which sets up a dialogue of values as a guide to the reader for critiquing the role of the Reverend Barclay in the poem proper. Barclay's story is presented in the third person, with the narrator omnisciently entering Barclay's mind and presenting ideas at times from his viewpoint, such as Barclay's idealist illusion that he wills the world into being (27). 15 The narrator refrains from the kind of interjections found in "Tamar," making use instead of a mid-poem interjection similar to the one in "Roan Stallion." But prior to this interjection, he enables the char- acter to enter into dialogue with an opposing viewpoint, not the narrator's but another side of Barclay's own mind. Jeffers interrupts this exchange by alternating between simultaneous events happening with other characters and the Barclay-döppelganger dialogue. Upon first meeting him, Barclay's döppelganger informs Barclay that he has gotten "outside humanity," but warns him not to continue his preaching because it should only come from love not from a desire for disciples. The exchange goes unresolved with Barclay having the last word. The döppelganger accuses Barclay of the sin of pride, but Barclay retorts with a remark that echoes the late interjection of "Tamar": "God who makes beauty / Disdains no creature, nor despised that wounded / Tired and betrayed body" (29). The first part of this "dialogue with self," as Nolte describes it (167), provides both a revelation about Barclay's self- serving drive to become a new savior and an intertextual dialogue connect- ing The Women with "Tamar." Barclay misuses the statement about God to justify his narcissistic actions. The first phase of the dialogue breaks off</page><page sequence="17">Patrick D. Murphy 141 and the narrative briefly relates Maruca's succumbing to a vaquero's seduc- tion, an act of loveless passion. In the second phase, the döppelganger has the last word. Barclay asks, "What is it that I dare not think off?" And "the image answered, / 'Of your own mind hypnotized by the accidents of birth and begetting. Because you have coupled and are budded / Of couplers : humanity the only pillar on every horizon?' " (68). The sexual activities that Barclay thought would give him power when he paid for sexual favors from Maruca, and thinks will strengthen him when he rapes his daughter, are deemed "accidents" of nature, and shown by the interjected vignette to be part of an instinctive compulsion. The question challenges Barclay's self-serving quest from an inhumanist perspective. But before Barclay answers, the dialogue is again broken by a vignette of lesbian love. Here there is the love missing from the Maruca-vaquero coupling, but this love is unfortunately sterile and futile. In each of the vignettes one of the elements of wholeness is lacking. In the third phase, the döppelganger speaks more inhumanistically against Barclay's position, but Barclay has the last word and denies the truth. The döppelganger denies that Barclay can feel love because Barclay's actions are destructive of his followers. But as the image fades in the fog, Barclay speaks again: "'Love requires martyrs: seal it with martyrdom:' he remembered / That both his father and his son were dead. 'Love of humanity : the enormous picture of familiar passions. / I have conquered the tempter: who came in the image of the most hated: I am conquering the loved'" (70). Barclay makes a supreme act of egotism by comparing himself to Christ and renounces the most rejuvenative power of human consciousness: love. Although the döppelganger poses the questions that represent authorial philosophy, Jeffers gives Barclay the last word in the debate, allowing him, and any readers who wish to agree with him, the feeling of having triumphed. After Barclay has "triumphed" over the temptation of reason, Jeffers inserts his mid-poem interjection, which returns to the first-person form of the "Prelude." He claims to have fashioned "new idols to praise him" but failed to make them strong enough. As in "Tamar," the voice informs the reader that the text is a fiction and effaces the poet's role. But within this effacement, there appears an authoritative statement of distancing from the actions and beliefs of the characters (see Squires 158). Admitting that his characters "fell down," the "I" insists: "I have seen and not fallen, I am stronger than the idols, / But my tongue is stone how could I speak him?" (72). Within the pride of vision, there is also a recognition that the</page><page sequence="18">142 Western American Literature "I" cannot approach God. Unlike Barclay who has the Nietzschean hubris to believe he can go beyond "good and evil" ( 64 ) , the pride of the narrator resides in his limited human accomplishments, and primarily in his strength to resist temptation (see Squires 5, Zaller 130). Jeffers attempts here to cope with the knotty problem of speaking authoritatively against people who claim to be authorities. In one sense, then, this interjection serves to remind the reader that the text is a humanly constructed fiction with a moral and a theme, and to remind the reader that the author is not one of the characters and does not share their delusions. But it also reveals the author's own limitations, both through his admission of inability to "speak him" and in his admission of pride and susceptibility to temptation. Ironically, it is Barclay who continues to claim power even as he dies precisely because only an egotistical, self-centered human could believe that he is on a level to face God. The author can make the prideful claim that he will create such vessels because they exist only in a fiction. Barclay's doom lies in his inability to see that his own vision is similarly a fiction. So, even as Jeffers's first-person narrator makes the authoritative claim of creative power, he uses it to enter into dialogue with the beliefs and state- ments of the main character. These first-person remarks, then, are double- voiced in that they ironically comment on the text itself, enter into dialogue with the protagonist of the fiction, and challenge the readers to reject their literal surface meaning as containing the temptation of pride that spurs Barclay's own downfall. From the near mid-point of the poem ( Chapters XI and XII ) , Barclay moves inexorably toward self-destruction. Nolte claims: "In the last half of the narrative, we are less concerned with the flesh-and-blood Barclay than we are with the uses Robinson Jeffers makes of him. He becomes a vehicle for the ideas of his creator" (168). He becomes a vehicle only insofar as he represents one of the paths Carpenter has called a "blind alley." Yet no loss of detail renders Barclay less palpable and he serves as a fully-rounded vehicle both through the double-voicing of his dialogue, authoritatively announcing to his followers ideas that are diametrically opposed to Jeffers's own beliefs, and through his actions, particularly the rape of his daughter. This act of incest reverses Tamar's unconsummated seduction of her father, but both represent the same destroying and self- destructive action of inward turning. But Jeffers, perhaps mistrusting the maturity and insight of his readers, again inserts a first-person interjection in Chapter XVII. This one states explicitly: "I say that if the mind centers on humanity / And is not dulled, but remains powerful enough to feel its</page><page sequence="19">Patrick D . Murphy 143 own and the others, the mind will go mad" (97 ) . Barclay, says Jeffers, has such a mind and does go mad. The interjection is directed at the readers to assist them monologically in understanding the role Barclay is meant to play, but it is the last act of authoritative assistance. From this interjection on, Barclay speaks uncontested. In the end, he leaves all of his followers behind in a landscape of fire and ashes : He came to the road and followed it, the waste vitality Would not be spent. When the sun stood westward he turned Away from the light and entered Mal Paso Canyon. At the head of the steep cleft the men had mined coal Half a century before ; acres of dry thistles Covered the place where men had labored, and Barclay Lay down in the mouth of the black pit. After three days, Having not tasted water, he was dying and he said : "I want creation. The wind over the desert Has turned and I will build again all that's gone down. I am inexhaustible." ( 1 75 ) The comparison with Christ is inescapable and Barclay clearly makes it. But will he rise again, or is this his final delusion? Jeffers does not say. There is no authoritative narrative comment, only the comparison between what Barclay claims and what nature has done. But the final words of Barclay are loaded with significant double-voicing. There is the irony of Barclay's egotistical confusion of himself with God. There is the truth of the statement that Barclay, not as individual but as historical type, is "inexhaustible" (see Scott, "From Berkeley" 57). And there is the open- endedness of the description, "he was dying." Barclay has not yet died and it is up to the reader to kill or resurrect him; Jeffers refuses to undertake that task.16 The long poems of Robinson Jeffers fly in the face of much that has been said about the desires of modern poets to write "sequences," or "per- sonal epics," or to settle for less unified works than those of their predeces- sors, particularly because Jeffers refuses to follow the trend toward positing the individual consciousness as the center for a chaotic universe. Through- out Jeffers's poetry the referent of nature remains stable, while humanity, as long as it attempts to center on itself, remains unstable. Jeffers did not gain this stable referent, however, by trying to write contemporary poetry with a classical sensibility or by trying to imitate classical works. While he rejected the direction of the modernist movement, he adopted the practice of finding means to take poetry and "make it new." And part of this process involved recognizing the influence and characteristics of the "novel," in</page><page sequence="20">144 Western American Literature Bakhtin's sense of the term, and adapting those aspects appropriate for the production of long, continuous narratives in verse. By the time he wrote "Tamar" Jeffers had abandoned traditional poetic prosody and language in order to produce a new voice for his narra- tives, one regulated by accentual emphasis. The everyday language of the world, fully integrated into literature by the novel, became the language of Jeffers's poems. Jeffers never availed himself of fragmentation or the sequential forms becoming popular around him; he chose, instead, to write continuous narratives with tragic, cathartic closures. Within this structure, he managed to dialogize much of the narrative and develop characters capable of becoming "speaking subjects" rather than simple vehicles for his own philosophy. In fact, Jeffers proved so successful at letting his char- acters "speak for themselves" that critics frequently confuse their beliefs with Jeffers's own. Jeffers's work, rather than presenting the monological, self-contained voice of the epic poet or the religious prophet, demonstrates repeatedly the self-consciousness of the modern author capable of utilizing the qualities of novelization that will dialogize poetry and open it up to direct confrontation with the open-ended present. 1. Karl Keller argues this same point, but from the perspective of a prosodie rather than philosophical analysis, as Squires does : "Remember that it was not until Jeffers came to the writing of narrative verse that he moved fully from the syllabic to the accentual in his lines. He then found that as he sought to recover the syntax and diction of prose for use in verse ... he needed a quantitative meter as a pacer, that is, as something to slow the speed of prose considerably" (10). 2. It is also interesting to note that rather than trying to define Jeffers's long poems according to traditional genre criteria, except in the case of the more obvious dramas, such as "Medea" and "The Cretan Woman," Carpenter compares Jeffers's long poems with the work of Henry James: "Like James's ideal novels, Jeffers' poems are interesting because they give expression to a 'singular,' or particular,' mind. Whether this mind is noble, like that of Milton, or immoral, like that of the Marquis de Sade, is, for the moment, beside the question" (13). 3. Like Brophy, Robert Ian Scott considers Jeffers's long poems tragedies, in the classical Greek sense of the term, and thereby narrows the range of possible inter- pretations: "Tragedies re-enact such relationships: tragic heroes find themselves the victims of their actions because those actions have results they did not anticipate" ("Robinson" 149). Scott's statement ignores the source for those results in the classi- cal world : the hero's fate being determined by capricious and preordained decisions of the gods. But Jeffers, like Shakespeare in Othello , views fate as more the result of the capricious actions of human society and its members, including the erroneous actions of the hero, than as the result of supernaturally ordained destiny. The degree of freedom and responsibility afforded the heroes varies from one Jeffers's poem to the next. For a similar critique of Brophy's method, see Bill Hotchkiss, Sivaistic, 242nl.</page><page sequence="21">Patrick D. Murphy 145 4. By "verse novel," I mean a new long poem genre, one that rather than pri- marily utilizing the conventions of historical long poem genre categories, such as epic, romance, and allegory, utilizes the conventions of the modern novel, particularly the features described by Mikhail Bakhtin, such as polyphony, heteroglossia, double- voicing, and dialogical internal persuasion rather than monological authority. I ex- plore the concept of this new genre in detail in "The Verse Novel : Dialogic Studies of a Modern Poetic Genre," diss., U of California, Davis, 1986, and in a forthcoming essay, "The Verse Novel : A New Genre of American Poetry." Bakh tin's concepts and definitions are primarily developed in The Dialogic Imagination , in which he discusses Eugene One gin as a verse novel, The Formal Method in Literary Scholarship , Marxism and the Philosophy of Language (pub- lished as authored by V. N. Volosinov - Bakhtin's writing, or role in the writing, of this work is disputed), and Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics . Although Bakhtin's earliest works appeared in Russia in the late 1920s, they remained virtually unknown outside of Slavic studies until French structuralists began popularizing them as cri- tical counters to Formalism and Saussurean linguistics in the 1960s. English transla- tions of his works began appearing only in 1968. For biographical information, see Katerina Clark and Michael Holquist and Tzetvan Todorov. 5. For a discussion of "Hungerfield," Jeffers's last long poem, that parallels in many ways this study and demonstrates an intuitive grasp of dialogical voicing with- out any apparent familiarity with Bakhtin's critical method, see Tim Hunt, "Inter- active." 6. Bakhtin has this to say about the novelization of other genres : "They become more free and flexible, their language renews itself by incorporating extraliterary heteroglossia and the 'novelistic' layers of literary language, they become dialogized, permeated with laughter, irony, humor, elements of self-parody and finally - this is the most important thing - the novel inserts into these other genres an indeterminacy, a certain semantic openendedness, a living contact with unfinished, still-evolving con- temporary reality" ( Dialogic Imagination 6-7 ) . 7. "Jeffers' early narratives not only castigated the naively affluent society of the 1920's - they did so with calculated purpose. The prophetic denunciations were inspired by the bloated optimism of the period and were intended to purge it. The bitterness of his medicine only made it seem more palatable" (Carpenter 42) . 8. The text of "Tamar" used here is the one in The Selected Poetry of Robinson ]effers. All page numbers given in the text refer to this edition. 9. That this is a self-conscious narrative method rather than an "error" or a disregard for style and consistency is demonstrated by the fact that Jeffers repeatedly practices it from this his first major long poem to his last. As Hunt says of "Hunger- field," "the formal, meditative address of the elegiast to himself and his reader gives way to the grieved husband's direct address to his wife's memory or imaginary pres- ence" (12). 10. Andrew Mau the, on the other hand, argues that these lines indicate an environmental influence of Tamar's actions: "The wildness of Tamar, then, is the wildness of Point Lobos" (9). This view assumes that the narrator speaks monolog- ically for the author and denies the interrogative character of the utterance. It also breaks off at the end of the question, not considering the rest of the passage. 11. Arthur Coffin states: "In terms of what she tries to overcome, Tamar's actions become insignificant as she proceeds. She fails to comprehend all of the prob- lem at the outset, yet chooses drastic means to solve it, discovering later that both</page><page sequence="22">146 Western American Literature her understanding of the problem of life and her particular solution have already been acted out by the previous generation, which had also failed" (9) . A key moment for such a turning occurs when she discovers her incest is not a unique act. With such a realization, Tamar could have abandoned her replication and attempted to find another solution, one which did not involve familial introversion. But the egotism involved in her will to power causes her to react with anger and jealousy toward Helen, the individual, rather than with knowledge and insight toward incest, the erroneous action. 12. Another long poem deserving particular attention in terms of dialogics, "The Double Axe," was published some twenty years after the publication of The Women at Point Sur , and because it appears so much later in Jeffers's canon will not be included in this discussion. Unlike the three early poems which enter into dialogue with each other, "The Double Axe" engages in internal dialogue between its two halves at the same time that it presents Jeffers's most authoritative speaker and most clearcut expression of his philosophy of Inhumanism (see Murphy). As a result, it combines, successfully, both dialogical and monological voicing. Jeffers also enters his long poems into thematic dialogue through the continuity of the Point Sur "saga," having places and people reappear in several poems, as he does with Onorio Vasquez in The Women at Point Sur , "The Good Shepherdess," and "Give Your Heart to the Hawks." 13. "The Tower Beyond Tragedy" posits Orestes as a hero who transcends humanity and the wiil to power. Jeffers states at the close of the poem: "Orestes walked in the clear dawn; men say that a serpent / Killed him in high Arcadia. But young or old, few years or many, signified less than nothing / To him who had climbed the tower beyond time, consciously, and cast humanity, entered the earlier fountain" ( Selected Poetry 140). Interestingly enough, in Roan Stallion, Tamar, and Other Poems , Jeffers places "The Tower Beyond Tragedy" immediately after "Roan Stallion" - he habitually placed the title poem first in his collections - but in The Selected Poetry he places it just in front of "Roan Stallion," with the result that the line, "erect and strong as a new tower," describing Galifornia, resonates intensely with the lesson of Orestes. Jeffers states in his Foreword to The Selected Poetry that "the long poems are presented in the order of their writing" (xiii) and that when he con- ceived of the plot of "Roan Stallion" he "had just finished The Tower Beyond Trag- edy " (xvi). This ordering suggests that Jeffers had in mind the implications of the resonance between "Roan Stallion" and "The Tower Beyond Tragedy" when he used the word "tower" in describing California, and the chronological ordering of The Selected Poetry helps bring this into focus for the reader. 14. As with "Tamar" and "The Tower Beyond Tragedy," all page references for "Roan Stallion" cited in the text and notes refer to The Selected Poetry. 15. Scott notes: "In seeking a new religion to keep himself comfortably deluded, Barclay seems a parody of Bishop Berkeley, who claimed that the world existed only as God perceives it. Barclay thinks that he is God, and that the world exists or should exist only as he wants it to" ("From Berkeley" 57). While I do not doubt that Jeffers parodies Berkeley, and along with him, perhaps, academia, I be- lieve that he attacks in The Women subjective idealism and its solipsist conclusions in general. Scott also makes a useful comparison of Barclay's delusion and the lines that T. S. Eliot quotes from F. H. Bradley in the footnote to The Waste Land (58). 16. Not only negative critics have difficulty determining whether or not Barclay speaks for Jeffers's Inhumanist beliefs, but also sympathetic ones, such as Hotchkiss</page><page sequence="23">Patrick D . Murphy 147 who struggles to resurrect Barclay as a failed hero rather than a negative protagonist. In commenting on the final lines óf the poem, he says: "But in this final utterance, Barclay sounds like an Inhumanist - so that perhaps in the moment of his death he has achieved the perspective and the truth which he sought. ... To read the passage thus, however, is to hear not the voice of Barclay but the voice of the Creative Prin- ciple being uttered through the dying man's lips" (Critical Afterword 180-181). It seems to me that Hotchkiss is trying to have Jeffers rather than Barclay speak the closing words of the poem. But in doing so, he must deny that it is Barclay who expresses the ridiculous egocentric claim of being inexhaustible. The renewal of nature included in the close, similar to the closure of "Tamar" and the opening of "The Inhumanist," part two of "The Double Axe," suggests the source of inexhausti- bility and resurrection. And that source does not lie within man as individual con- sciousness, but within man as particle of nature, a relationship consistently denied by Barclay (See Hunt's afterword to the Liveright edition of The Women for a reading that diametrically opposes Hotchkiss's but still tries to give Jeffers the last word, 210-212).
