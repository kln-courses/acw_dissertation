<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity and Literature Vol 40, No. 2 (Winter 1991) Moral Transcendence in Iris Murdoch's Nuns and Soldiers : Apropos of Theocentric Ethics Gary S. Hauk "Your life doesn't belong to you," said Anne. "Who can tell where his life ends? Our being spreads out far beyond us and mingles with the being of others. We live in other people's thoughts, in their plans, in their dreams. This is as if there were God. We have an infinite responsibility." - Iris Murdoch, Nuns and Soldiers Like James Gustafson's first volume of Ethics from a Theocentric Perspective , Iris Murdoch's novel Nuns and Soldiers begins with what one might think of as "an interpretation of our circumstances" ( Ethics 1). Put concisely, our circumstances are finite and contingent. More specifically, our circumstances are those of Guy Openshaw. Well-bred, well-educated, and well-to-do, Openshaw has a warmth and magna- nimity of soul that make him one of Murdoch's most attractive charac- ters. His incisive intellect and substantial wealth have in some ways set him apart from his friends; the gracious humility that prompts him to put his gifts at his friends' disposal has set him above them. An aristocrat of the spirit as well as the bank account, he has the virtue and wisdom one might expect to find in a Platonic guardian. He also has terminal cancer. Thus he thrusts upon the reader at the very outset of the novel an image juxtaposing the best of human endeavor with the end of hu- man possibility, goodness in the midst of suffering, even goodness undone by death. And he raises the question that becomes the central theme of this novel: by what measure, finally, can love be judged wor- thy in a world where lover and beloved alike too soon become wind- swept dust? Or, to put the question in terms that might suit the theo- logical ethicist, how do piety and the morally strenuous life measure up against pain, defeat, and death? In this essay I want to respond to these questions by reading Nuns and Soldiers through the lens, as it were, of Gustafson's seminal work in theological ethics. I begin, therefore, by looking briefly at Murdoch's and Gustafson's understandings of the self in relation to society and 137</page><page sequence="2">138 Gary S. Hauk transcendence. I will then highlight important themes and characters in the novel and show how it probes the ethical structures of human existence. I On the face of it one might assume that Murdoch, the self-avowed atheist artist, and Gustafson, the "dean" of living American Christian ethicists, would differ greatly on the importance of anthropology in moral reflection. In the first chapter of Ethics from a Theocentric Per- spective Gustafson takes great pains to show the pervasive anthropocentrism of not just Christian theology and ethics but also, incidentally, the entire Western humanist tradition. The argument he sustains is that moral reflection, especially for the Christian theologian, must take as the measure of all things not the human being (and the human being's place in the cosmos) but God, God's actions in the world and God's relationship to all of creation. Murdoch, on the other hand, has sustained for over thirty years an argument that contempo- rary moral philosophy does not do a good enough job in taking the human being as the measure of things - or that the measure philosophy takes is an inaccurate one. Despite this difference in emphasis, Murdoch's and Gustafson's protests against the age arise out of a common impulse to correct prevailing assumptions about the nature of being human. What I find interesting in reading Murdoch's and Gustafson's work is the way they seek to enrich our understanding of the following issues: (1) the inner life of the moral agent, or what Murdoch has called "moral psychol- ogy"; (2) the connectedness of human beings to one another in in- tractably moral ways, or what I call "moral sociology"; and (3) the hu- man sense of larger realms of mystery in which the individual operates, or what I call the sense of "moral transcendence." Murdoch's career has been propelled by certain interests that have led her to advance a single argument against the thin conception of human personality advanced by classical liberalism and held by most modern philosophers. The classical liberal is a creature of habit who is nevertheless skeptical (Hume) and burdened by consciousness (Hegel and Sartre). Yet preeminently this individual is marked by reason as the naked child of the gods, who are now, fortunately, dead. As a rational creature the liberal is able to "stand back," as it were, from perceived sense data and "decide" what is right and "choose" to do it. Freedom, the highest good of this individual, consists in the fullest knowledge of experience, including the experience of the mind, which is transparent to linguistic analysis.1 Certain secondary goods follow</page><page sequence="3">Moral Transcendence in Nuns and Soldiers 139 from the primary good of freedom: the good of tolerance, which guar- antees to each individual the opportunity to exercise rational freedom; the good of science, which discovers techniques for opening greater space over which free consciousness can roam; and the good of hap- piness, which allows the quantifying mind to strive for a calculable common good.2 In one of her earliest published essays Murdoch pronounces an el- egant judgment on the intellectual and moral barrenness of our time, a barrenness mirrored in the stripped-bare nature of the person envi- sioned by modern philosophy and theology: We have suffered a general loss of concepts, the loss of a moral and political vocabulary. We no longer use a spread-out substantial picture of the manifold virtues of man and society. We no longer see man against a background of values, of realities, which transcend him. We picture man as a brave naked will surrounded by an easily compre- hended empirical world. ("Against" 18) The major impetus of her work is an attempt to limn an alternative to this liberal personality. Against the faded sketch of humanity operative in the twentieth century Murdoch has wanted to place a fuller portrait. And, thus, her moral thinking begins with a view of the human per- sonality. In proposing her own picture of the human personality in moral terms, Murdoch seeks to reduce the stress on will and to suggest both that the deeper compulsions and affectivities of the personality have a great deal to do with moral action and that moral discernment and action rely to a large extent on habits and predispositions. Making the moral life a matter of what one sees rather than what one chooses, Murdoch speaks of the energies of the spirit or of the psyche that deflect or distract vision. The pursuit of goodness becomes a training, not in the behaviorist sense of conditioning one's responses but in the religious sense of a kind of prayerful discipline. That Gustafson begins his phenomenological study of the self somewhat differently should not obscure the fact that he, like Murdoch, wants to evoke our understanding of "the manifold virtues" of human being against a background of transcendent reality. Like Murdoch, Gustafson adverts to "vision" as the basis for his initial interpretation of our circumstances. Thus, it is important to him that anthropocentric interpretations describe the world in terms of the differences between human beings and other animals, stressing among other things human rationality. Because they tend to define the human animal by its ra- tionality, its capacity for action, and its greater freedom compared to that of other animals, anthropocentric views of human being encourage</page><page sequence="4">140 Gary S. Hauk emphasis on the reason, autonomy, and will of the individual, much as that individual has been described in Murdoch's summary of the classic liberal individual. And, like Murdoch, Gustafson does not find that perspective convincing, largely because it does not adequately describe all of what it means to be a person in society. Two of Gustafson's basic convictions are that human experience is unified and that it is "deeply social" ( Ethics 120). Experience precedes reflection, but for various reasons the mind seeking understanding be- gins to divide unified experience and analyze it into discrete categories: aesthetic, moral, religious, cognitive, sensate, and so on. This tendency to analyze distinctions results, as well, in the traditional separation of human subjectivity into intellection, volition, and passion. Although Gustafson defends these distinctions as useful in elaborating moral theory, he is wary of relying on them without the most serious qualifi- cations. Knowing, willing, and desiring all have their place in descrip- tions of morality, but "if one begins with human experience, it seems . . . that in the rawest moments of moral concern these aspects of the self are commingled" ( Ethics 119). Thus Gustafson is led by his el- ementary convictions to a fundamental skepticism about the egocen- tric and individualistic ethics of Kant, on the one hand, and utilitarian hope for happiness, on the other. For both Murdoch and Gustafson, the self is a more complex and variegated being than is dreamed of in all contemporary philosophies. The true picture of the self lies in that more ancient self-portrait by St. Augustine, which suggested the intertwining of knowing, valuing, and willing. As Gustafson summarizes Augustine's insights, "You cannot love what you do not know" ( Ethics 120). As Murdoch would put it, you cannot know what you do not love.3 Both knowing and loving depend upon the selfs embeddedness within a social system, and to that so- ciology of the self I now want to turn. That human experience has its basis in the social context of the self is by now not much more than a truism. But the consequences of ignoring this truism lead, Murdoch has shown, to the solipsism of ex- istentialist thought as well as to the ego's impulse toward self-consoling fantasy. Nor is Gustafson at all ignorant of these consequences. He faults Paul Tillich, for instance, for making "the 'inner quality'" of persons' lives "of more concern than their actions" {Ethics 41). For him the Tillichian emphasis on human subjectivity undercuts the power of acknowledging that life is lived in community and therefore is conducted according to norms external to the individual. That is, the Tillichian (read, for Murdoch, "existentialist") understanding of the self leaves the moralist with little ground on which to establish a meaningful picture of the moral life, since the moral life depends upon shared meanings</page><page sequence="5">Moral Transcendence in Nuns and Soldiers 141 about what is "other than self' (Ethics 115). That experience is socially grounded is evidence of something ob- jective to both individuals and communities, to which moral agents respond. More than that, however, the social nature of the self points toward the social construction of knowing and valuing. It is important to note that in discussing human experience Gustafson makes a crucial turn from the social structure of the self toward the communal knowledge of reality. While Murdoch does not make exactly this turn, her thought too hinges on the belief that knowledge of reality lies in the ways of knowing made possible by the community that surrounds the self. Focusing on religious interpretations of experience, Gustafson points to the socially based epistemology by which one begins to name and define experience: "I am persuaded," he says, "that the primary moment in a religious view of the world ... is the affection of piety: a sense of dependence on, and respect and gratitude for, what is given" ( Ethics 61). The dimensions of affectivity that Gustafson goes on to develop - what he calls religious "senses" - have their source in the individual's primary relatedness to all things. Since it is inconceivable that a human infant could survive in utter isolation from birth, one can say with certainty that this primary relatedness and its concomitant religious senses necessarily arise from the social nature of the self. Gustafson describes these senses as (1) a sense of "radical depen- dence" ( Ethics 282), including a sense of radical interdependence that suggests we are actively and not just passively connected; (2) a sense of gratitude, which is also an awareness of the goodness and benefits of creation; (3) a sense of obligation, which points us in the direction of duties and responsibilities we bear toward those on whom we have depended; (4) a sense of remorse and repentance, which prompts us to acknowledge our failed obligations; and (5) a sense of possibility or open-endedness in life. Each of these senses both arises out of and reinforces social relations. From Gustafson's interpretation of the human being as a social being comes his sense of the fundamental moral question posed to the in- dividual by an other. "Religious affections and activity are generated in response to 'others' and, for the theistic religious consciousness, to an 'Other'" ( Ethics 129). Insofar as he has made clear the impossibility of being human without human relationships, one can doubt whether in his view human beings can ever avoid a relative measure of religious affections. The human being's intractably social existence makes in- evitable a response to the "other than self" ( Ethics 128). At this point Gustafson moves toward a more profound description of religious affectivity by using a term that I think aligns him very closely</page><page sequence="6">142 Gary S. Hauk with Murdoch and holds the key to his theocentric ethics. That term is "piety," which he characterizes as "a settled disposition, a persistent attitude toward the world and ultimately toward God," the "persisting characteristics" of which are "awe and respect" ( Ethics 201). 4 While Gustafson seeks to distinguish piety from faith for rhetorical reasons, it is clear that piety includes what is usually thought of as faith - trust or confidence as well as belief and fidelity. "Faithfulness, like measured trust, is part of the basic disposition toward the world and toward God that I call piety" ( Ethics 203). With this central term of piety firmly rooted, Gustafson is able to trace the many branches of the moral life. Those branches reach up- ward, as it were, toward transcendent God as well as outward toward society. The social self, whose complex interiority reflects its manifold relationships to the world, is also the self turned by those relationships toward powers perceived to be transcendent. Although Murdoch never explicates the "varieties of religious expe- rience" to the degree Gustafson does, she broaches the general topic in her essay "On 'God' and 'Good.'" There it is clear that she sees some- thing comparable to religious affections as the primary impulse toward action, especially moral action. More than that, she acknowledges the "devices" that religion provides for purification of these affections - prayer, sacraments, participation in an accepting community. The effect of these devices is to alter "quality of consciousness ... in the direction of unselfishness, objectivity, and realism" ( Sovereignty 84), and these devices she connects with virtue. Indeed, it is at this point that I see Murdoch and Gustafson essentially talking about the same springs for moral action: in her language it is "attention"; in his it is "piety." Both attention to the world's particulars and piety toward the world's manifold relatedness lead one to a sense of transcendent good and toward right action in response to the good, or God. The virtuous life in Murdoch's scheme of things hinges on the degree of attention of which the moral agent is capable. Love, the highest virtue, has its roots in the prior virtue of being attentive to the world. Thus, if attention is virtue, the vice which is its contrast would seem logically to be "inattention." In fact, however, Murdoch speaks more in terms of illusions and fantasy as the opposite of attention - what one might think of as attention to the wrong things, the "unreal." Fantasy in her usage connotes sloth and mental dullness. In theological terms one might think of Reinhold Niebuhr's "sensuality," a sinking into a life of ease which stands at the opposite pole from the other great sin - pride (see 1:228-40). Fantasy is Augustine's "concupiscence." In elaborating her concept of self-deception/fantasy/illusion, Murdoch bows to Freud, whom she credits with presenting "a realistic</page><page sequence="7">Moral Transcendence in Nuns and Soldiers 143 and detailed picture of the fallen man" (.Sovereignty 51). It has been said of Murdoch's moral psychology that it combines Platonic and Freudian concepts of eros (see Conradi 200). The mind stayed on the Good is pulled toward a healthy realism by that "transcendent magnetic centre" ( Sovereignty 75) but also falls prey to its own propensity for lower types of eroticism. For good or ill the mind, in Murdoch's view, is shaped by what it loves. For Gustafson too, as I have shown, "morality is a matter of 'affec- tions'" ( Ethics 171). Heavily indebted to Augustine, Jonathan Edwards, and Friedrich Schleiermacher for his moral and religious psychology, Gustafson discovers the springs of good and evil in a powerful blend of knowledge and desire, the products of which are good or evil depending upon their objects. Quoting Augustine's Enchiridion, Gustafson says: "Faith, working through love, attains purity of life which finally attains sight. It is purity of heart that enables persons to 'know that unspeakable beauty, the full vision of which is supreme happiness'" ( Ethics 170). Like Murdoch, Gustafson sees virtue as being turned toward the other, or more specifically toward the transcendent Other - that piety that is central to his moral theory. It is what might be called the "egress" of the self, outward and away. For both Gustafson and Murdoch, I think, the human infatuation with what is unreal, illusionary, and disordering of good relations is a natural part of the human make-up. And, therefore, the road we travel toward moral maturity is long and tortuous; it turns always backward, as it were, inward toward the self, and then out again to present a better perspective on reality or on the center of goodness and value. But the way is a difficult one in both Gustafson's and Murdoch's manner of speaking, Gustafson frequently invoking the muse of tragedy and Murdoch the specter of defeat. There is in both, I believe, a deep pessimism about the moral possibilities achievable by human beings, and this pessimism is consonant with the Christian doctrine of original sin.5 The correction lies, as Gustafson recalls Julian Hartt saying, in the reconstruing of context and of reality (see Ethics 308). To an extent which neither Gustafson nor Murdoch underestimates, that reconstrual must come to the individual as a gift, as "grace." For Murdoch it is possible to will the direction of attention toward the Good; just as of- ten, however, our attention is pulled toward the Good by the often inadvertent gracefulness of those around us. I believe Gustafson takes a similar view of the social workings of grace - grace that operates through, but not by means of, the social structures that the individual inhabits and is habituated to. Indeed, as I hope to show, the grace that comes to the individual through society frequently operates in spite of</page><page sequence="8">144 Gary S. Hauk the structures in which we "live, move, and have our being," to quote the Prayer Book. This redirection by grace, a notion consistent with Augustinián and Lutheran views of the will, is largely a function of the reworking of context upon the individual, and it has to do with a mys- tery to which Nuns and Soldiers points. II To a large extent Guy Openshaw serves as a strictly functional character in Nuns and Soldiers - as a vehicle for delivering Murdoch's central themes of contingency and love, death and goodness. Nuns and Soldiers is not about Guy Openshaw. Having raised the central themes, he recedes into the wings while the other, more important dramatis personae take the stage. As they do so, Guy's final conversations with his wife Gertrude, with his close friend "Count" Wojciech Szczepański, and with Gertrude's best friend Anne Cavidge introduce quickly certain subsidiary themes: questions of identity- formation and the self, of group "insiders" and "outsiders," of the survival of the individual amid cosmic hostility or a hostile cosmos, of the relative insignificance of philo- sophical and theological dogma in the face of mystery and death. Murdoch's introduction of these themes is wholly controlled and masterful, and she plays them in subtle, superb variations throughout the novel. Her use of the theme of the self can serve as an example, with its implications of social identity, cognition, affection, and the senses identified by Gustafson. Shortly after the Count's first conversation in the novel with Guy - a conversation that begins with Wittgenstein and touches on such "Viennese" questions as the "tribal identities" of Guy and the Count (Guy is Jewish, the Count is a Polish Gentile) - the narrator begins to relate the Count's background by saying, "The Count, it should be ex- plained, was not a real count" (6). Born in England just before the outbreak of World War II and educated in English schools, where he was given the nickname by which everyone still knows him, the Count is an alien in his home country, haunted by dreams about the Warsaw Rising, his sundered ancestral land, and his older brother's death in an air raid. For years he has deeply and secretly loved Gertrude Openshaw, although Gertrude and Guy and others of the Openshaws' extended family of friends have long guessed his chaste and honorable feelings. With Guy removed from the scene, the way is clear for the Count, following a proper period of grieving, to announce his love and attempt to win Gertrude's hand; and everyone, including Gertrude, expects that the Count will follow through on this opportunity. Guy himself, who spends his last weeks reading and rereading The Odyssey, with its brutal</page><page sequence="9">Moral Transcendence in Nuns and Soldiers 145 dispatching of the suitors of Penelope, encourages Gertrude to marry again, even mentioning to her the Count as a possible husband. But the Count is a torn and tortured man who sees in Guy's death the end of a secure, secret, but passive menage à trois now suddenly wrecked by accident and time. The Count had always known that he was not a gentleman volun- teer in the army of the moral law. If ever a soul was conscripted he was. He intensely feared disgrace, loss of honour, loss of integrity. He stood, in his mind, as still and as expressionless as the soldiers at the Unknown Warrior's grave in Warsaw. Indeed he could do nothing wrong, since the situation held him in a merciful steely grip. . . . But now his life was about to change utterly. He felt grief, terror, and a more awful hope. He tried to banish hope, to banish the desire which breeds the illusion which breeds the hope; as the long long nourished desire to free Warsaw had fed the illusory hopes of those who fought and died in the ruined city. He must not think of . . . anything which he might want to have ... as being in any sense ... a possibility. Rather he must think of it as remote, as receding, as lost He thought, my happiness was an oversight, a mistake made by fate, and is now over. Behind almost every misfortune there is a moral fault. I am like Poland, my history is and ought to be a disaster. (42) The Count moves and acts out of a profound understanding of himself as a divided - and therefore, to his mind, unlovably wounded - soul. "He was his own Poland" (13), says the narrator, and to under- stand the loss and despair behind that description one need only compare it to the Count's own reading of Polish history. His father's homeland has been, for most of its history, never an end in itself in the kingdom of ends. "The eternal 'Polish question' was never, it appeared, really about Poland at all, but about some use to which Poland could be put or some hindrance which Poland represented in the larger de- signs of others" (14). The same can be said of the Count himself. What one comes to feel as the burden of the Count's life is his utter separation from home, his deep feeling for the vulnerability of the frail human frame to madness, loneliness, bombs, and the beloved other's infatuation with someone else. He is the one upon whom the powers that brought him to being weigh like an oppressive, suffocating engine. His sleep is haunted by nightmares of the massacre of Poles by Germans or by Russians; his waking is haunted by the memory of having resisted his father's patriotism until he realized too late, following his father's death, that he had inherited that same "searing patriotism" (138). A Puritan with a heart made for moral struggle, he feels destined for "a heroic role in the world, though he knew that it was an impossible one which he would never find" (14). The Count senses within himself a</page><page sequence="10">146 Gary S. Hauk moral fault, and the reader concurs in this judgment; the attentiveness of this patient and watchful devotee is finally too narrow, and its nar- rowness deflects his vision from the larger reality, which includes the reality that others love him deeply and both enable and require from him a different response to life than he seems capable of offering. While the Count becomes the principal sounding board for the theme of "moral fault," this theme echoes throughout the lives of Gertrude and others as well - most clearly in the lives of Tim Reede and his girlfriend Daisy Barrett. Lovers seemingly forever, Tim and Daisy met in the Slade School of Art, and both are painters, although Daisy has given up painting for novel-writing. Subsisting on National Assistance and Tim's meager earnings as a part-time art teacher, they have sunk more and more deeply through the fleeting years into a morass of what is now fashionably called "codependence." Finding that "cohabitation was becoming altogether too exhausting" (82) because of their endless quarrels, they live in separate apartments - he in a spare, clean, unheated studio over a garage, and she in a flat filled with empty wine bottles, strewn clothing, furniture with sticky rings on it, and dying or dead plants. The catastrophe in which Tim and Daisy dwell has its roots in a kind of moral lassitude, a metaphoric as well as actual sloth. And, tellingly, this moral inertia is linked to the failure of both as artists. Tim, for one, has a gift for imitating the masters but is content to be a mediocre painter; although one of his teachers has told him that his "destiny" is to become "a great faker," forgery "demands a patience . . . which Tim did not possess" (80). The hard work required to become a good artist is spoken of in moral terms, as is the settling for less than one's best. The narrator of Nuns and Soldiers says, Any artist who is not a beginner faces the problem of enlarging into a working space the line that runs between "just begun" and "too late." The hard work lies in the middle, when preliminaries are done, and the end is not yet enclosing the form. This is the space which belongs to collapse, which the artist's strength must faithfully keep open. Tim was vaguely aware of this, but he was idle and lacked confidence. He was almost but not quite aware that he chose daily to remain mediocre. (124) Habits of the studio and habits of the life outside the studio become one, and it is clear that whatever attitude of or disposition to carelessness has kept Tim from artistic fulfillment has also kept him at a level of moral mediocrity. Tim "gets by" with the expedient of simply letting things "go by." Projecting all power for changing his life onto some great indifferent Controller of Events, events that cannot be known in</page><page sequence="11">Moral Transcendence in Nuns and Soldiers 147 advance and that cannot be changed afterward, he has evaded respon- sibility for his and Daisy's life until years have gone past, and he settles into his mid-thirties as if into a comfortable bed of quicksand. That this is also what he desires may be suggested by the motto he has chosen for himself - the Greek verb lanthano, meaning "I escape no- tice" (83). One way to escape notice, of course, is never to say anything; and one way never to say anything is never to say anything true. Tim's art is good only so far as it mimics conventionally recognized goodness: the goodness of "pseudo-Klees, pseudo-Picassos, pseudo-Magrittes, pseudo-Soutines" (80). But in the process of painting copies in order to escape the possibility of calling attention to oneself by painting some- thing original, Tim habituates himself to life as the possibility for lying. So deeply ingrained in Tim is the practice of dissembled art - the commitment to canvas of what is only half-perceived because perceived at second hand - that Tim's life becomes the art of dissembling, and the lie becomes his mode of existence. In fact, most of the drama of the novel unfolds precisely because of Tim's inability either to see clearly what the truth is or to say it even as clearly as he can see it. But "vision" here means far more than the metaphor of seeing or discernment alone might imply. Vision is really ratiocination affected by feelings and distorted by a weak will. Soon after Guy's death Tim visits Gertrude in order to ask her for money. (Daisy has impressed on him, "If possible don't let her call it a loan - we probably won't repay it, we can't" [138].) Gertrude is unaware that Guy was formerly Tim's guardian and that, after Tim's coming of age, Guy would regularly and liberally lend Tim money. Now, naturally embarrassed about asking her for money for the first time, he is an- noyed and ashamed as she tries solicitously to find the reason for his straitened circumstances and the best way for her to assist him. Dur- ing the "interview" Tim emits a series of half-truths or outright lies in order to cut short what he perceives to be an awkward and embarrassing situation for them both. When Gertrude asks whether he can sell what he paints, Tim responds, "No, not much .... I mean, there's a time- lag, you see" (135). (How can he confess to wanting to live as a painter when his paintings are not much good and are hardly "marketable"?) When Gertrude asks what he's painting now, he wonders whether to "explain to Gertrude about the cats. He decided he could not. He said, trying to be at least partially truthful, 'I'm drawing at present - drawing people, people I see in - in parks and places - and animals and - and things'" (136). (How can he admit that most of his drawings are unfin- ished and that his principal work of late had been painting one portrait after another of the cat in his local pub for sale as kitsch?) When Gertrude asks whether the teaching job he expects to have in September</page><page sequence="12">148 Gary S. Hauk is a certainty, Tim hesitates: "He was really not sure. He had told Daisy that it was certain, to cheer them both up. But with things as they were nothing was certain" (137). Finally, when Gertrude proposes that she pay him to live at her house in Provence over the summer and take care of it in her absence, he leaps at the possibility. "By the way," she asks, "can you speak French?" Without a pause Tim replies, "Oh yes" (139) - but of course he can speak scarcely a word of it. Having established a relationship with Gertrude based on a thread of "innocuous" half-truths, Tim sets off for France to take possession of the house for the summer, to begin to paint, and to await Daisy, with whom he has agreed that she should join him in a few days. Of course he had not breathed a word about Daisy to Gertrude. Not that he imagined Gertrude would have minded, said "in that case, no" or anything. He was not quite sure why, but it was somehow clear that he could not ask Gertrude if he could take his girl friend along. It was an aesthetic matter really. (148; my emphasis) As so often happens in the midst of such deception, in life as in Murdoch's novels, an unexpected turn threatens to bring the whole charade to a crashing conclusion. Tim has been at the house for not more than three or four days, anticipating Daisy's arrival within the week, when Gertrude herself shows up. Tim writes to Daisy in a panic to warn her off, and in doing so he lies to her. Thus, with the ease of breathing, Tim has wrapped himself in layers of deception from which he will extricate himself only with a great deal of painful exertion, a large measure of luck, and the aid of friends of whose benevolence he remains forever unaware. When he and Gertrude fall irremediably in love, the novel becomes the story of their attempts to hack through to the truth of their relationship, as well as the story of its effects on their friends. While an unsavory habit of dissembling seems to drive Tim Reede through much of the first half of the novel, he like the Count is moved by a sense of not having a home in the universe and an identity behind his name. I have already touched on Tim's ability to copy the works of other artists, a talent that left him feeling as if he had "no identity, no 'personal style'" (80). Following Guy's death, before gathering courage to confront Gertrude about his need for money, Tim feels himself cut off from les tantes et les cousins, the "extended family" that Gertrude and Guy have gathered about them over the years. "It had all depended on Guy," Tim thinks; "he [Tim] was not real like they were" (123). Guy and Gertrude's flat on Ebury Street is for him "an abode of value" that shelters for him the only true feelings of self-identity he has. Cut off from that shelter by his own falseness, he becomes a rudderless boat</page><page sequence="13">Moral Transcendence in Nuns and Soldiers 149 unmoored. Elizabeth Dipple has pointed out that both Tim and the Count rep- resent the "soldiers" of the book's title. Tim is described at one point as "soldiering on" (84). Yet he never achieves the plane of higher pur- pose on which the Count operates, and he remains a footman to Goodness rather than a soldier in its defense. This dual representation of the soldiers in the title is paralleled by Gertrude and Anne. Gertrude is seen by various characters as a virgin priestess or nun, yet by the end of the novel she has become what Dipple calls "one of Murdoch's least attractive set characters - the emotionally voracious, middle-aged, middle- class woman" (333). The nun with the high calling is Anne, who was in fact a nun for a decade. Both the Count and Anne illustrate Gustafson's insight that "the possibilities of human action are severely limited by the kinds of persons we have become as a result of natural capacities and by the particular circumstances within which choices are made" ( Ethics 186). Anne's "natural capacities" are difficult to unbraid from her experience because her religious vocation seems to have arisen equally out of her brilliant career at university and her apparent reaction to her hedonistic life there, which paradoxically confirmed her sense of being "isolated, separated" (20). As Gertrude is being left without a husband when the novel opens, she is partly consoled by the appearance on her doorstep of her dearest and oldest friend, Anne, who has left a convent after ten years of cloistered life. It quickly becomes plain, however, that while Anne may have left the convent, she has done so to follow a far more rigorous religious calling in the world. In part her association with Gertrude and her circle of friends becomes for Anne a test of whether she will live out her own ascetic vocation; in part her circumstances and capacities dictate that she will do so. Anne's story, somewhat like the Count's, is the story of someone caught in "the dark night of the soul," with the difference being that Anne has learned "the metaphysics of waiting" (312). In an echo of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets, and in contrast to the Count's own attitude toward hope, she comes to believe that "the religious life involves the total idea of the transformation of hope" (303). In the "East Coker" section of Four Quartets Eliot writes: I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting. Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought: So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing. (123-28)</page><page sequence="14">150 Gary S. Hauk What is Anne to hope for, to desire? Again and again she suppresses her hope for domestic arrangements with the Count, sensing the false- ness of that vision. Murdoch has spoken of the contrast between the artist and the saint as a controlling metaphor in her earlier novels, and in this later novel the contrast is still at work between the characters of Tim and Anne. That Tim is not a very good artist heightens the contrast even more between his attempts to impose form on life, and control it, and Anne's humble watchfulness about life. Although Tim is said to have a gift for perceiving, it is Anne that we see to be highly intuitive in her relations, especially with Gertrude and the Count. Anne exhibits the Keatsian "Negative Capability" that is required of the true artist, while Tim pe- riodically reverts to drawing organic shapes and then literally drawing grids over them. "It's when things happen to me that I know what I evidently wanted" (360), says Tim, who passively allows his actions to well out of his life and then tries to interpret them, whereas Anne un- derstands the "infinite responsibility" (446) of the epigraph to this es- say. She seeks to know what she is being "enabled and required to do" with her life, to use Gustafson's language. In fact, early in the novel Anne asks the question of her own life that arises as well for Daisy, Tim, the Count, and Gertrude: "Can people change?" Anne does not seek change as a way toward happiness; ac- tually she denies the likelihood of "happiness" ever having any mean- ing for her (see 107). Rather, she is looting for a way to resume the self- transformation she had sought but failed to find in the religious order. Later in the novel, as Tim experiences his own dark night just before deciding to leave Daisy forever, he senses the emptiness he feels as "refined energy, pure activity, pure being ... a condition of pure free- dom" - but also madness. His "vision of death" results from his inability to "see how to return to ordinary life, and he knew the return would be agony" (386). Once change is set in motion for Tim (the passive voice, again, being the appropriate one), Daisy grasps the opportunity and refuses to allow him to weaken his resolve. Gertrude too exclaims in a moment of self-despair, "I can't exist as I am. I've got to change" (255), directly precipitating the actions that lead to her marriage to Tim and the moral roller-coaster of emotions that that union sets in motion. The interesting question to pose of this novel is whether any of the characters do indeed change, and my own sense is that they do not. The development of character here is rather a confirmation of character and appears in their facing the possibility of change and then resuming their customary modes of getting through the moral questions life poses. For Tim, Gertrude, and the Count, this "relapse" is perhaps a sign of ill health, certainly of lowered aspiration or expectation. For Anne, the</page><page sequence="15">Moral Transcendence in Nuns and Soldiers 151 rejection of the kind of change presented to her, change toward con- vention, marks her as one of the true saints in the Murdoch canon. In the way it introduces the themes of morality and religion, reality and love, Nuns and Soldiers resonates symphonically with the themes of Gustafson's Ethics from a Theocentric Perspective. Running through the center of the novel is the leitmotif of human striving for the Good, with its inevitable submersion and recapitulation; and rumbling under the whole, like a basso continuo, is the insistent note that says, as Gustafson has said, that "the human condition necessitates a deeper and more radical conversion" ("Response" 188) than is implied in most contemporary accounts of morality. In the end it is a somewhat pes- simistic but still hopeful message that sounds from Anne Cavidge's decision to follow her vocation, and this perhaps oxymoronic blend of pessimism and hope is, I believe, the hallmark of both Murdoch's and Gustafson's moral theories. The human fault is deep and terribly de- structive - of relationships, of the self, and of the Good; and yet the startling and startlingly good creation offers possibilities for renewal and larger vision that can correct and heal. Ill I want to close this reading of Nuns and Soldiers by drawing together a few of the novel's insights into the nature of being human. There is at work in the novel, first, a sociology of morality more complex than might be suggested by a simplistic reading of les tantes et les cousins as formative of so much of the characters' striving. To be sure, this ex- tended family of characters reflects Murdoch's profound appreciation for tradition. That the Openshaw family are Jews who "made it" in England through various degrees of rejection of their religious tradition is itself a tradition among them, a tradition that both casts them as sojourners in the midst of "Christian" England and forms in them a somewhat schizophrenic attitude toward outsiders. On the one hand, they look on Tim Reede with a high degree of skepticism about his ability to fit into marriage with Gertrude, one of "them"; on the other hand, as individuals they display a great readiness to adopt Tim, even to work as advocates on his behalf. The sociology of morality I have in mind, however, suggests, as do Murdoch and Gustafson in their respective essays, that the proper in- terpretation of human being requires an understanding of the perceiving self determined by both cognitive and affective perceptions of the thick atmosphere of life in which it moves. It is a self that, like Anne Cavidge, moves within a "cloud of witnesses" (Heb. 12:1) past and present, and that, like Tim Reede, moves among its relationships to the world as if</page><page sequence="16">152 Gary S. Hauk moving in a fun house of mirrors. For both, the perceived other reflects back the selfs desires and knowings and valuings and helps to direct them toward the best they can aspire to. Thus the novel reveals too the thick moral psychology that Murdoch calls for and that Gustafson analyzes in his discussion of the intertwining of cognition, affection, and volition. It is very much an "erotic" psy- chology: desire lies at the root of human motivation and bends action toward envisioned ends. Sometimes, as for Anne, the will is also a strong partner of desire and keeps the gaze fixed steadily on the Good rather than on the merely satisfying. Sometimes the strong affections and strong will work together, as in the Count, toward a distorted vision of duty attainable only, it would seem, by Puritans. Finally, the novel is about the sense of moral transcendence possible with pious attention to the other - or to "The Other" perceived through an other. Both the saint and the artist, Anne Cavidge and Tim Reede, come to a relative ability to "consent to being" (.Ethics 175), as Gustafson puts it following Edwards. This ability is latent in them from the be- ginning, but it is very powerfully evoked by their startled experience of something that pulls them out of themselves at important moments. In Tim's case it is his seeing a hidden pool of unusually clear water, above which rises a cliff face that can be described only with the Kantian word "sublime." For Tim the vision of this natural phenomenon has the effect of diminishing his significance in the universe, of moving the center of meaning away from him toward a dimly intuited source of meaning. Tim stood for a while gazing at the cliff and at the pool, and his heart was so filled with joy that at one moment he had to clutch at it with both hands. The great round white pitted rock now seemed to hang there like a vast heroic shield Now Tim unpacked his little stool, his sketch book, his pencils, his crayons, his paint box and brushes, his handy water-pot, filled at the kitchen tap. He had that pure clean blessed beginning- again feeling. He was full of grace. He sat down, completely happy, and began to draw. (154-55) In the light of Murdoch's blending of aesthetic and moral insight, Tim's beginning to draw here can be read as nothing less than his beginning to see and to love the world, in a way that will lead him finally to escape his engulfing relationship with Daisy. In fact, that escape represents its own response to transcendence, to Tim's sense of "being aimed at" - a sense evocative of Gustafson's "powers that bear down on and sustain us" ( Ethics 272). Escape be- comes possible because Tim's attitudes and dispositions have been thoroughly dismantled, as it were, by his relationship with Gertrude, a</page><page sequence="17">Moral Transcendence in Nuns and Soldiers 153 relationship that prompts a full self-evaluation not in terms of the self but in terms of another. As these attitudes and dispositions alter, Tim learns that, as Gustafson and Murdoch assert, the freedom of the au- tonomous individual is a mythical freedom more nearly resembling "the horror" of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. As Tim experiences the void wrought by his "conversion," his mind is a welter of emotion and thought, through which it is impossible for him to cut a direction or choose a course of action. At last, attending to the demise of his relationship with Daisy, which he perceives as a "vision of death" (386), he knows his will to be defeated. His slowly forming resolve comes to him as a decision already made, painful as it is. Still more interesting than Tim's slow maturing is Anne's struggle toward a resolution of her vocational question. More clearly than most of Murdoch's characters, even her few "good" characters, Anne repre- sents a fairly straightforward and unusually detailed characterization of Murdoch's view of the moral life pitched steeply. Having lost her belief in a personal God while in the convent, Anne has returned to the world still possessed by her religious life, developed over long years of habit. Echoing the God-bereft Lear, she wonders whether "she would be more like a spy, one of God's spies, the spy of a non-existent God." She has determined to "live secretly, as a secret anchoress," still at- tending the Mass, perhaps even continuing to receive the sacrament, and looking for a way to pray with honesty and meaning. But of one thing she is sure - that her moral task is henceforth to be shaped by her unshakable religious affections in conjunction, as Gustafson would have it, with her immersion in a tradition and her long-practiced piety.6 Can anyone who has once had it really give up the concept of God? The craving for God, once fully established, is perhaps incurable. She could not rid herself of the experience of God's love, and the sense that only through God could she reach the world. . . . She was soaked in Chris- tianity and in Christ, sunk, saturated, stained indelibly all through. The cross was round her neck like a fetter, like a noose. (62) Anne's Christ-haunted existence culminates in a vision of Christ in her kitchen that remains, to the end of the novel, a quite inexplicable mystery to both her and the reader. Is it a hallucination? A dream? A drug- or dementia- distorted interpretation of some more fleshly visitor who turned up in her apartment - a meter-reader, an electrician, the building superintendent? Unanswered as these questions are, Anne carries from the experience two very tangible reminders still with her months later as the novel closes: a "burn" on her hand, where she had touched her holy visitor, and a small smooth stone in which he had revealed to her the cosmos. As she comes to her decision to leave for</page><page sequence="18">154 Gary S. Hauk America and work for the Poor Clares in Chicago, these reminders of her experience serve as literal touchstones of the truth revealed to her by this Christ. The scar showed no sign of going septic, but it persisted. Anne felt it now against the hard cold surface of the stone: the stone in whose small compass her Visitor had made her to see the Universe, everything that is. And if it is so small, thought Anne, beginning thus a sentence which she was never able confidently to finish. There was not God, but Christ lived, at any rate her Christ lived, her nomadic cosmic Christ, uniquely hers, focused upon her alone by all the rays of being. He was defeated, she thought, the way to Jerusalem was not a triumphal progress. He was a failure, a pathetic deluded disappointed man who had come to an exceptionally sticky end. And yet: "Weep not for me but for yourself." Could she, knowing what she knew of him, of all his failure, all of it, tread that way after him? Could she relive his journey and his passion while knowing that he was after all not God? And she remembered the "wonderful answer" which had made her Visitor laugh and call her "witty," when she had said, "Love is my meaning." And she remembered too in an odd way something which the Count had said once about his own love and its object. "I did it all, I enacted both sides of the relation, and this could be done because she [Gertrude] was inaccessible." And Anne cried out in her heart to her living Christ, "Oh Sir, your yoke is heavy and your burden is intol- erable." And she was answered in his words, "The work is yours." (500) For all of her mystical attunement to the transcendent reality she per- ceives about her, Anne is thrust the more radically into the mundane as the realm of moral action. As Peter J. Conradi has summed up this typically Murdochan movement, "What awaits the moral pilgrim for Murdoch is not some attenuated elsewhere, but 'here' differently and freshly perceived" (86). In her commitment to the marching orders she reads out of her encounters with the world, Anne sounds much like Gustafson's paraphrase of Dietrich Bonhoeffer: "I never confront the reality of the world without confronting God, and I confront God through the reality of the world. . . . God present in the world" ( Ethics 199). Though impersonal, the deity prayerfully attended to by Anne is also a deity to whom she relates personally and deeply, without the necessity of anthropomorphism or images of God-as-agent. What Nuns and Soldiers finally teaches is that, while "the destiny of human life is not in human hands" {Ethics 21), we are inescapably part of a larger whole that ratifies our power for good even as it discloses our finitude and dependence. As Anne comes to learn, the sense of calling means being given opportunities and responsibilities to par- ticipate - the development of skills, dispositions, and virtues. Yet "be- ing" and "doing" are one, as Gustafson has suggested, and Anne's</page><page sequence="19">Moral Transcendence in Nuns and Soldiers 155 "showings" have convinced her that her consent to having been called into the world requires her consent to death as well - to doing goodness in the midst of death, goodness undone by death. Finally being human means either rejecting or consenting to whatever goodness can be found in the world. Emory University NOTES 1 See Murdoch's lucid discussion of analytic linguistic philosophy in The Sovereignty of Good (9-25). 2Jeremy Benthan and John Stuart Mill, of course, are the contributors here. 3Murdoch is fond of quoting Henry James's comment about Honoré Balzac that he "did not love his characters because he knew them, [but] he knew them because he loved them." 4 Although Gustafson does not allude to Kant here, I cannot help inferring from his description of "piety" echoes of Kant's emotions upon looking at the starry heavens. Murdoch discusses Kanťs emotions at length in relation to her own version of piety, which I shall consider in a moment. What I find fascinating is that Gustafson and Murdoch both emphasize these emotive responses as undergirding the moral life, and for very similar reasons. 5 Indeed, Murdoch suggests that moral philosophy should undertake a more serious réévaluation of original sin (see Sovereignty 50-51). 6See Gustafson's "A Response to Critics" (185-86) for the integral relation of "piety, tradition, how things really are, and ethics," and for the relationship of "our being and our doing in life."
