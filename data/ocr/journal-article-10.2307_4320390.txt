Part One distinguishes six sources of motivation: sense perceptions, pas- sions, imagination, and 'inner feelings' of love as-respect, as-goodwill and as- esteem. He examines how each is to be evaluated. This is interwoven with an Aris- totelian analysis of act and habit, and vol- untary vs. involuntary acts, and practical reasoning. This part concludes with two basic virtues - 'the strength of the mind' and 'the freedom of the mind'. Part Two explores our duties to ourselves, to others, to our sovereign, and to God. The transla- tor's introduction discusses the place of Malebranche's ethics within his larger system, his borrowings and innovations, and his impact on later philosophers.

Reading Lester Embree's Metaarchaeology provides the best possible introduction to the field, since in it several leading archaeologists show how accessible and interesting the current archaeological literature is, and currently active philosophers of archaeology reveal something of the current state of discussion on the sub- ject. Bibliographies have also been developed of the philosophy of archae- ology as well as of selected parts of the component that can be called metaarchaeology. Finally, an historical introduction has been included to show the variety of metascientific as well as orientational standpoints that KLUWER philosophers of archaeology have had ACADEMIC recourse to for over two decades, fol- PUBLISHERS lowed by speculation about the future LAd of the discipline within the philosophy ** of science. 1993, 342 pp. ISBN 0-7923-2023-9 Hardbound $119.00/Dfl.175.00/262.00 P0.
