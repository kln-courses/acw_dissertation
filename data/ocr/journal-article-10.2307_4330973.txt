HAGEN Committee on History and Philosophy of Science University of Maryland College Park, Maryland 20742 Biogeography has a long history. The distribution of plants and animals was a focus of pre-Darwinian natural history. Biogeog- raphy provided Darwin with crucial evidence for evolution, and it continues to play a role in evolutionary biology. Despite its importance, biogeography has not developed into an autonomous discipline. Early in the twentieth century, when several biological disciplines emerged, biogeography remained precariously perched between the remnants of natural history and the rapidly develop- ing discipline of ecology. Prior to about 1900 biogeography was primarily a descriptive activity closely related to taxonomy.' Traditionally, biogeogra- phers focused on describing the distributional patterns of species, genera, and higher taxa. Plant geographers also compiled floras, or lists of regional species. And they provided explanations for the distributional patterns, which after Darwin often meant providing historical analyses of the origin, dispersal, and extinction of species. The history of species was the central theme in Darwin's own biogeography. For Darwin distribution was explained primarily in terms of the origin of new species and their subsequent migration. He specifically stated that distribution could not be adequately explained in terms of present environmental conditions. Accord- ing to Darwin, "In considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of the globe, the first great fact which strikes us is, that neither the similarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions can be accounted for by their climatal and other physical conditions."2 Early plant ecologists disputed this 1.

Consciously turning froim taxonomic, historically oriented biogeography, they argued that the physical environment, particularly climate, held the key to understanding geographic distribution. This is not to suggest that ecologists were necessarily anti-Darwinian. However, their perspective on biogeography was significantly different from Darwin's. Ecologists frequently rejected historical explanation and stressed the causal influence of physical factors on vegetation.: Inspired by experimental physiology, these ecologists developed a plant geography that was both conceptually rich and method- ologically innovative. At first glance it would be tempting to conclude that this "ecological plant geography" totally dominated the study of plant distribution. Such was not the case: ecology never completely annexed plant geography. Taxonomists con- tinued to pursue historical studies, and during the second quarter of the twentieth century there was a renaissance of what might be referred to as "taxonomic plant geography." A rift developed, however, between ecological and taxonomic plant geographies - a rift that apparently persists today.4 The purposes of this article are to examine the impact of early plant ecology on geographic studies, and to analyze the emergence of two fairly distinct traditions in twentieth-century plant geography. THE ECOLOGICAL CRITIQUE OF NATURAL HISTORY While the term "ecology" was coined during the second half of the nineteenth century, the development of ecology as a recogniz- able discipline was primarily a twentieth-century phenomenon. During the period 1895 to 1905 a number of botanists argued 3. Given this environmentalist perspective, it is perhaps not surprising that several early ecologists, including Gaston Bonnier, Frederic Clements, and Eugenius Warming, accepted neo-Lamarckian theories of inheritance of acquired traits. 4. See Philip Stott, Historical Plant Geographv (London: George AHen &amp; Unwin, 1981), chap. 1. The rift between ecological and taxonomic traditions may also characterize modern zoogeography. For example, Philip J. Darlington, Jr., Zoogeography.: The Geographical Distribution of Animals (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1957), p. vii, stated: "This book is a geographical, not an ecological, zoogeography. This is not said apologetically. The ecological approach to animal and plant geography is fashionable now, but books written from that point of view. . . are ecologies at heart and hardly geographies at all." 198</page><page sequence="3">Ecologists and Taxonomists: Twentieth-Century Plant Geography that their ecological research was new and innovative. Typical of this group were Eugenius Warming (1841-1924) in Denmark, Andreas Schimper (1856-1901) in Germany, and Frederic Cle- ments (1874-1945) in the United States. These botanists pu- blished major works that shared several important characteristics.5 Most important, the authors defined a new area of botanical research and distinguished it from traditional natural history. Second, all three texts explicitly linked this new discipline of ecology with plant geography. Finally, these texts presented broad conceptual frameworks within which plant distribution could be interpreted.6 As I shall discuss, not only were these frameworks hostile to traditional plant geography, but no comparable theore- tical systems were proposed by taxonomists during the first two decades of the twentieth century.7 Garland Allen has argued that around 1900 many biologists turned from descriptive studies to experimental physiology. The extent and significance of the so-called revolt from morphology have been debated by historians.8 Nevertheless, the early ecolo- 5.

HAGEN gists clearly argued for such a revolution. From their perspective plant geography had been a mere cataloging of facts devoid of causal explanations. For example, Schimper accused traditional plant geographers of "dilettantism" and "anthropomorphic trifl- ing."9 Clements also referred to descriptive botanists as dilettantes and complained that natural history "lends itself with insidious ease to chance journeys or to vacation tnrps, the fruits of which are found in vague descriptive articles.""' For Clements the inherent weakness of this " vague descriptive" methodology was com- pounded by the taxonomists' "species problem." Clements often ridiculed descriptive taxonomists for creating subjective, artificial species. We shall see that many ecologists hoped to replace the seemingly ill-defined taxonomic units with more rigorously defined ecological units. The ecologists' strident criticisms probably reflected a need to legitimize their discipline. In its early years ecology was frequently viewed as a fad or an adjunct to amateur nature study. Clements' own teacher, the influential botanist Charles Bessey (1 845- 1915), was openly skeptical. Clements undoubtedly felt a par- ticular need to distance ecology from amateur botany and to place it on a credible scientific basis."' Yet the ecologists' critiques of natural history also reflected a genuine admiration for physiology - which, with its precise experimental methods, seemed to offer new tools unmatched by those of natural history. The early ecology texts were more than rhetorical critiques of natural history. Clements, Schimper, and Warming laid the foun- dation for a more detailed understanding of adaptation.

' All of the early books on plant ecology included chapters on adaptation to water, temperature, soil, and other environmental factors. The physiological orientation of the ecology texts also provided a compelling framework for explaining distribution. Speculative accounts of the origin and migration of species were to be replaced by rigorous experimental studies of adaptation. The answer to why one found a particular plant in a given region was to be provided not so much in terms the of history of the species but rather in terms of adaptation to the present physical en- vironment. Schimper, a committed Darwinian, rarely discussed patterns or mechanisms of speciation in his text, and these topics received only cursory mention in a brief chapter at the end of Warming's book.'3 While he acknowledged that distribution might be explained historically, Warming dealt almost exclusively with the relationship between plants and their immediate physical environments.'4 The ahistorical orientation of early ecology is further illustrated by the work of Clements, a scientist with an abiding interest in evolution. Despite his concern for speciation and phylogeny, Clements was wary of any nonexperimental methodology. In contrast to the precise experimental studies of adaptation, Clements concluded that "the origin of the plant forms known at present must forever lie without the domain of direct knowledge." ' 5 Finally, the early ecology texts championed experimentalism. For example, Schimper warned that "only if it remains in the 12.

In effect, ecology could become field phy- siology. LIFE FORMS AND COMMUNITIES Taxonomic plant geography was concerned fundamentally with species: how they originated, spread, and became grouped into floras. In contrast, ecological plant geography dealt primarily with vegetation, the structure of plants and plant communities.'7 Both individual plants and whole communities exhibited characteristic forms. At the level of the individual, structure was characterized by one of a number of life forms. Collectively these life forms imparted a characteristic structure or physiognomy to a plant community.'8 Implicit in early vegetational concepts was the central idea of adaptation. Form and function at both the in- dividual and the community levels were determined by the requirements of the physical environment. Ecologists stressed the distinction between traditional taxonom- ic units and the units of vegetation. Life forms transcended taxonomic categories. On the one hand, taxonomically unrelated species might share a common life form, while on the other hand, closely related species might exhibit completely different life forms. Furthermore, taxonomists and ecologists emphasized dif- ferent characteristics. Taxonomists diagnosed species primarily on the basis of floral anatomy. Floral parts tended to be relatively stable, indicating phylogenetic relationships, whereas vegetative structures were labile. Yet ecologists favored vegetative structures 16. Schimper, Pflanzengeographie, p. iv. 17. In contrast to the term "flora," the word "vegetation" has no taxonomic connotation. For example, distantly related species from three families (Cacta- ceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Asclepiadaceae) can be considered to share a common life form because they exhibit a cactuslike physiognomy. 18. The study of physiognomy as it relates both to individual plants and to communities dates back at least to the work of Alexander von Humbolt. For a discussion of this early work see Browne, Secular Ark, pp. 42-48. 202</page><page sequence="7">Ecologists and Taxonomists: Twentieth-Century Plant Geography for precisely this reason. Easily modified stems, leaves, and buds often reflected environmental influences. Some ecologists even believed that life forms could replace species as geographic units. For example, in 1908 the Danish botanist Christian Raunkiaer (1860-1938), a leader in the development of life-form concepts, wrote: "The units of floristic plant geography are the same as those of systematic botany, viz. species, genera, families &amp;c., but this is not so in biological plant geography. In considering the relation- ship to environment, or to climate, we do not ask to what genera [sic] or species a plant belongs, but we want to know its life- form."'9 Raunkiaer's system of life forms was the most successful of several proposed at the turn of the century. It is instructive not only because it has survived to the present, but also because it illustrates the weaknesses as well as the strengths of the life-form concept. As with other systems, Raunkiaer's categories could be divided and subdivided into an unwieldy hierarchy. But the strength of the system was that a few primary categories were distinguished on the basis of a single adaptive characteristic. Assuming that water was the principal limiting factor for plants, Raunkiaer based his life forms on a characteristic that allowed plants to survive unfavorably dry seasons. He divided terrestrial plants into four categories according to the position and structure of their buds (Fig. l). At the two extremes Phanerophytes had exposed, unprotected buds, while Cryptophytes had well-protected, underground buds. Between these extremes Chamaephytes and Hemicryptophytes had low, protected buds near the surface of the soil. Finally, Therophytes were annual plants that survived drought as seeds. The life-form concept was a useful tool for ecological plant geographers because geographic regions could be characterized by the type of plants that grew there. For example, in some tropical regions the vegetation was composed almost exclusively of Phan- 19.

Arctic regions, on the other hand, were nearly devoid of Phanerophytes but rich in Hemicryptophytes and Cryptophytes. Using life forms as "biological indicators" of climate, Raunkiaer and his followers made detailed statistical comparisons of the vegetation of various geographic regions. Although Raunkiaer's statistical approach to the study of life- forms was fruitful, a more widespread method involved the description and analysis of plant communities. Throughout the twentieth century the term "community" has been loosely applied to any spatially defined group of interacting species. Despite a plethora of frequently confusing terminology, early ecologists agreed on at least two fundamental characteristics of communities: each had a recognizable structure, and this structure was deter- mined primarily by the physical environment. Like an individual plant, a community exhibited a distinctive growth form or physiognomy. As Schimper quaintly pointed out, "If one looks down upon flat virgin country from a great height, for example from a mountain peak, or better still from a balloon, the character of its vegetation as a rule appears homogeneous, 204</page><page sequence="9">Ecologists and Taxonomists: Twentieth-Century Plant Geography either as woodland, grassland, or desert."20 These major vegeta- tional categories, or formations, could be analyzed further. For example, woodlands included both deciduous and evergreen forests, which could be further subdivided. While there was considerable disagreement over the exact definition of formation, there was broad consensus that formations rather than species were to be the primary focus of ecological plant geography.2' 1 Just as the life form of an individual plant was dictated by adaptation to the environment, so the physiognomy of a com- munity was assumed to have environmental causes. To some extent biological interactions such as competition, parasitism, and other forms of symbiosis determined the structure of the com- munity. Ultimately, however, moisture, temperature, soil, and other physical factors were the determinants. The pnrmacy of the physical environment as a causal agent is evident in Schimper's description of competition between communities. Schimper likened grassland and woodland communities to "equally powerful but hostile nations" constantly at war with one another.22 The outcome of this warfare did not depend on the floristic composition of the competing communities, but rather on the physical characteristics of the environment. Given an understanding of the environment, one could accurately predict the outcome. After contrasting the general physical requirements of trees and grasses, Schimper concluded, 'Victory in the struggle between woodland and grass- land belongs to the one of the two antagonists with which the given climatic conditions best correspond."23 The apparent tight causal connection between physical factors and vegetation provided the ecologist with an objective basis for defining communities. In contrast to the seemingly arbitrary species studied by floristic taxonomists, a community or formation could be rigorously defined in terms of the physical environment that caused it. While admitting that considerable disagreement existed among ecologists over the exact definition of vegetational units, Clements made the following comparison: 20.

Ibid., p. 178. 205</page><page sequence="10">JOEL B. HAGEN There have been as many different opinions in regard to the application of the term formation as there are concerning the group which is to be called a species. In taxonomy, however, the concept of the species is purely arbitrary, and agreement can not be hoped for. In vegetation, on the contrary, the connection between formation and habitat is so close that any application of the term to a division greater or smaller than the habitat is both illogical and unfortunate. As effect and cause, it is inevitable that the unit of the vegetative covering, the formation, should cor- respond to the unit of the earth's surface, the habitat. This places the formation upon a basis that can be accurately determined.24 Community ecology was hostile to taxonomic plant geography in several ways. First, vegetational units were presented as objective substitutes for traditional taxonomic species. Clements' criticisms of the species concept reflected the views of many ecologists. For example, H. C. Cowles (1869-1939) descfibed the destruction of artificial taxonomic species as one of the "noblest aims of ecol- ogy."25 In contrast to species, the ecologists' units appeared to be empirically verifiable. Therefore, ecological plant geography seemed to rest on a rigorous scientific foundation lacking in taxonomic plant geography. Ecologists categorized communities to form a system parallel to the traditional taxonomic system. The broad geographic formations, for instance, could be divided into more restricted associations; and associaitions could be further divided into local plant societies. Ecologists routinely referred to formations and associations as ecological genera and species. Clements even suggested that new herbaria could be organized on the ecological system rather than on the traditional taxonomic one.26 Finally, the significance of taxonomic species was diminished because they appeared to be interchangeable, or at least equivalent, within the structural framework of the community. For example, one could consider deciduous forests in North America and Europe to be the same type of community. even though few if any species were common to both. The role played by the dominant beech tree of European forests was duplicated by a different 24. Clements, Research Methods, p. 292. 25. H. C.

Thus while the floras of two geographic regions might be difficult to compare, the vegetation of the regions could be readily compared in eco- logical terms. THE DIVERGENCE OF TRADITIONS During the first two decades of the twentieth century plant geography was a major focus of ecological research, and this research had a significant impact on the development of profes- sional ecology. Stimulated by Warming's textbook, a group of ecologists organized the British Vegetation Committee to survey all plant communities in the British Isles. This research began in 1904 and continued until 1913, when the group reorganized as the British Ecological Society.27 Similar geographic research was conducted by ecologists in other countries, including the United States.28 Given the enthusiasm for this type of ecological research, why did ecology fail to replace taxonomic plant geography? In the first place, the belief that experimental physiology would become the foundation for plant geography was largely illusory. The physi- ological ideal did motivate early plant ecologists and did focus their attention on interactions between plants and environmental factors. In theory, the principles of distribution could be reduced to the causal influence of physical factors on biological form and function. In practice, this causality was troublesome to demon- strate. The difficulty is perhaps best illustrated by Andreas Schimper's Plant Geography upon a Physiological Basis. Schimper seemed well prepared to achieve the goal expressed in the title of his book: he had worked in the laboratories of the physiologist Julius Sachs (1832-1897) and the cytologist Eduard Strasburger (1844- 1912), and during extensive travels had studied a variety of plant communities.29 While Schimper's book discussed both physiology and plant geography, the latter was not convincingly based on the former. Schimper's plant geography was almost entirely a de- 27. Tansley, "History of Plant Ecology, pp. 135-136. 28.

Cittadino, "Plant Adaptation," chap. 4. 207</page><page sequence="12">JOEL B. HAGEN scnptive account of vegetation: he defined formations from a superficial survey of a few dominant species. In most cases the causal relationship between an environment and its particular formation was assumed rather than demonstrated by experimental evidence. Schimper himself was aware of this defect. In the preface to this book he admitted that with the current state of knowledge a satisfactory survey of ecological plant geography was impossible, and that his book aimed principally to stimulate further research by presenting a "precise formulation" of important questions.3" The subsequent physiological investigation of Schimper's ques- tions was far from straightforward. None of the early ecologists clearly specified how experimental physiology could be applied to the study of plant communities. In some of his writings Frederic Clements drew sharp parallels between the functions of individual plants and of whole communities. His concept of the community as a superorganism implied that the physiology of communities was analogous to that of individual plants. But Clements never elaborated this suggestive idea. The alternative reductionist posi- tion, that communities could be understood in terms of the physiology of their constituent plants, was not adequately de- veloped by ecologists either. One reason was that ecologists increasingly were criticized for oversimplifying the relationship between environment and organisms. The physiologist Charles Barnes (1858-1910), for example, found Clements' discussion of physiological causation "appalling" and suggested that much of Clements' explanation was "vague and inexact physiological cant."3' One biographer has argued that Clements' professional reputation was damaged by Barnes' scathing words.32 Not sur- prisingly, later ecologists tended to stress the complexity of environmental causation, and some ecologists questioned whether the study of communities required an explicit physiological foun- dation.33 Increasingly, plant ecologists drew a distinction between 30.

Furthermore, environmental 208</page><page sequence="13">Ecologists and Taxonomists: Twentieth-Century Plant Geography autecology, the largely physiological study of individual plants, and synecology, the study of communities.4 In retrospect, the most fruitful methods of synecology were neither physiological nor experimental. For example, the quadrat and transect methods pioneered by Clements were essentially descriptive. The species problem has been a thorny issue in modern biology. Many early ecologists hoped to replace notoriously ill- defined taxonomic species with rigorous ecological units. But the correlation between environment and plant community was com- plex and did not provide an unambiguous criterion. Furthermore, ecologists chose to employ terms ("association" and "formation") that had previously been used by floristic taxonomists. Eugenius Warming apparently recognized the inherent confusion of inject- ing floristic terms into an ecological context. In the early editions of his text Warming rejected the term "'formation" as vague, ambi- guous, and superfluous.35 Still, the formation, nebulous as it was, continued to be used by ecologists. Indeed, Warming later intro- duced his own idiosyncratic definition and used the term through- out the English edition of his textbook. The ambiguity surrounding ecological units was also reflected in numerous attempts to stan- dardize the definitions of "formation" and "association." At least two international congresses struggled with the problem, and a number of articles were written on this topic.36 Ecologists turned factors could rarely be studied in isolation. Therefore, they concluded, "in attempting to determine the relative importance of several climatic conditions as determinants of a given distributional phenomenon, it is seldom possible to do more than speak in general terms."

HAGEN out to be strikingly unsuccessful in standardizing their geographic units, another reason why ecology failed to replace taxonomic plant geography.37 One last point is that ecology failed to replace taxonomic plant geography because ecologists did not adequately address such traditional geographic problems as endemism, centers of origin, rates and patterns of speciation, and mechanisms of dispersal. These subjects were virtually ignored because they were relatively unimportant from a physiological perspective, and also because they were closely tied to the species concept. Many ecologists considered historical explanations to be inherently speculative and incapable of experimental verification. After about 1920, however, these problems once more became topical - partly as a result of the renewed interest in evolutionary processes that arose during the second quarter of the twentieth century. In addition, provoca- tive new geographic theories were advanced by plant taxonomists. Two examples will illustrate this revival in theoretical taxonomic plant geography. In 1915 Alfred Wegener (1880-1930l) elaborated a theory of continental drift in his book Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane.38 During the following decade Wegener's book was translated into several languages and stimulated considerable debate. Despite its controversial status, a number of plant geog- raphers found in continental drift an appealing explanation for certain puzzling distributional patterns. One young British geog- rapher, Ronald Good (1896-?) argued that continental drift provided the most logical explanation for the disjunct distribution of shrubby plants in the genus Coriaria.39 Species of Coriaria were found in restricted areas of Central and South America, northern Africa, southern Europe, and the Far East. According to Good, in order to explain this pattern one had to either accept continental 37. This problem apparently has never been fully resolved. In a chapter entitled "Association, Formation, Classification and Confusion" Shimwell, De- scription and Classification, p. 42, writes: "The classification of vegetation suffers greatly from overstatement, some ambiguity and, inevitably, misinterpretation.

Seventeen years later, when he published the most successful modern textbook of plant geography, Good included both the Coriaria example and a detailed theoretical discussion of continental drift.4') Continental drift remained a controversial theory among bio- geographers.4' Equally provocative were the ideas set forth by J. C. Willis (1868-1958), a prominent British evolutionary theorist and taxonomist whose Dictionary of the Flowering Plants and Ferns became a standard taxonomic reference book.42 Despite his reputation as a critic of natural selection, Willis was quite Darwinian in his explicit evolutionary approach to biogeography. Like Darwin (and unlike many ecologists), Willis was primarily interested in the origin and migration of species. In his 1922 book, Age and Area, Willis argued that the age of a species was directly correlated with its area of distribution.43 The oldest species in a genus would tend to be the most widely distributed. A corollary of this hypothesis was that endemic species were nearly always very young. These ideas were taken seriously by taxonomists, because Willis bolstered his claims with voluminous data from his Dic- tionary. Age and Area quickly became notorious and stimulated heated debate. In contrast to Wegener's theory of continental drift, Willis' age and area hypothesis never gained widespread ac- ceptance. Nonetheless, by stimulating renewed interest in plant distribution, Willis' ideas were at least as important as continental drift. Even his harshest critics admitted that Willis forced geog- raphers to reconsider endemism, dispersal, and patterns of 40.

Continental drift was not universally accepted by biogeographers when Good published his text. Well into the 1950s some were openly skeptical of the theory; see, for example, Darlington, Zoogeography, pp. 606-612. 41.

Accordingly, Willis is generally cited as a major contributor to the revival of taxonomic plant geography.44 Debates over the age and area hypothesis and continental drift were among the striking indications of a renewed interest in taxonomic plant geography. Another was the publication of authoritative texts during the period 1920 to 1950. In addition to Ronald Good and J. C. Willis, several other plant geographers wrote books that emphasized taxonomy and historical explana- tion.45 These authors did not necessarily reject ecology; but their texts redirected attention to traditional geographic questions. CONCLUSION The distinction between taxonomic plant geography and eco- logical plant geography was never absolute: it would be historically inaccurate to portray them as totally divergent. Taxonomists occasionally borrowed ecological concepts, and ecologists never completely repudiated taxonomy. Indeed, some botanists pursued the two types of geographic study. The American taxonomist Henry Allan Gleason (1882-1975), for one, made noteworthy contributions to both. Most of Gleason's research appeared in short articles, however. He never published a major synthetic work comparable in scope or influence to the ecological texts of Clements, Schimper, and Warming. Despite exceptions such as Gleason, most plant geographers throughout the twentieth century have emphasized the distinction between ecological and taxonomic plant geographies. Why have these distinct traditions developed? In his book Geographical Ecology, Robert MacArthur has suggested a psychological ex- planation for the dichotomy: "Unraveling the history of a phe- nomenon has always appealed to some people and describing the machinery of the phenomenon to others ...

At the turn of the century a group of botanists self-consciously defined a new area of botanical research. These ecologists defined their new discipline in oppo- sition to what they believed was a moribund, nineteenth-century, natural-history tradition. They turned from historically oriented, descriptive, taxonomic plant geography to experimental physio- logy. The new ecological plant geography was to focus on communities rather than on species, on proximate environmental causes rather than on historical explanations, and on physiological experiments rather than on morphological descriptions. As we look back, much of the "revolt from morphology" was rhetorical. Ecologists never completely replaced species as units of distribution, nor did they set geography on an explicitly phy- siological basis. Indeed, much of early ecological research was, quite simply, descriptive. Plant communities were defined in terms of dominant species, representative life forms, or general phy- siognomy. The underlying physiological basis for community characteristics was more often assumed than demonstrated by experiments. Despite the fact that ecological plant geography was not a truly physiological specialty, it was significantly different from more traditional taxonomic plant geography. First, ecologists were less explicitly evolutionary in their approach than were taxonomists. Following Darwin, most taxonomic plant geographers viewed distribution in historical terms. In contrast, early ecologists tended to ignore the traditional geographic problems. Most ecologists were skeptical of historical explanations, emphasizing instead the proximate, environmental causes of distribution. While some nineteenth-century biogeographers had studied the correlation between climate and vegetation, twentieth-century ecologists focused much more sharply on the interactions between plant and environment. Plant ecologists did not place biogeography on a physiological basis, but by emphasizing physiology they laid the foundation for a more detailed understanding of adaption. This 46. Robert H.

HAGEN emphasis on physiology and environmental causation was a second distinguishing characteristic of ecological plant geography. Finally, the idea of the plant community, articulated by Eugenius Warming in 1895, provided ecologists with a unique perspective on the distribution of plants. For early ecologists, the community was more than an assemblage of species; it was an integrated unit. The distribution of these units became the major focus of eco- logical plant geography. Communities never completely replaced species as geographic units, and the distinction between flora and vegetation was often blurred. Nonetheless, ecologists were inno- vative in studying the distribution of structurally and functionally integrated groups of plants. In the twentieth century plant geography has occupied an anomalous position in biology. It has not developed into an autonomous discipline, nor has it been incorporated into the developing discipline of ecology. Ecologists and taxonomists have pursued fairly distinct styles of geographic research, with the result that two relatively independent approaches to the study of plant distribution have persisted. 214</page></plain_text>
