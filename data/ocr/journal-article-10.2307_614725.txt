(Etudes sur le Judaisme Medieval, Tom. II.) xxx, 518 pp., 83 plates. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1973. Guilders 290. This monumental undertaking is the first part of an exercise in synthesis and methodo- logy (of which the second half is due, according to the publishers, to appear in 1977). In a lengthy introduction (pp. 1-30) the author justifies his selection of material (thirteenth- sixteenth centuries) and his more or less exclusively synchronic method (iconographic, seldom typological, never historical), intended to serve as prelude to the descriptive catalogue of illuminated haggadahs envisaged in part n. His principle of organization is set out on pp. 19-20, according to which the material may be divided into three categories: simple ornament (sic : purement dicoratif ), illustration of the Passover ritual, and Biblical illustration. Its application is realized in three chapters whose relative lengths are to some extent dictated by the material but also by the author's interests: iconography (pp. 33-333), ornament (d4cor; pp. 337-54), and composition (style; pp. 357-92). Illustration is provided by 481 figures distributed in 83 plates, with a descriptive list (pp. 406-42), and an extract</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 645 (pp. 443-60) of the comprehensive bibliography planned for part II. Dr. Metzger appears to be concerned to achieve two aims: assembly of as compre- hensive a collection of illustrated haggadahs as is humanly possible (some of the obstacles encountered are alluded to on pp. 18-19, p. 36, nn. 1-2, p. 56, n. 1); proof of an autonomous (and ancient) Jewish tradition of manuscript illumination. After nearly a century of scholarly activity in this field, a certain amount of polemic is hardly surprising: the author's arguments for the independence of a Jewish tradition (e.g. pp. 261, 332-3, 393-4) are basically (a) absence of anthropomorphic expressions of the deity, and (b) presence of Midrashic and Talmudic allusions known only to Jews. It may just here be worth recalling that all of the material examined belongs to the late Middle Ages, by which time the substance and methods of Jewish scriptural exegesis had penetrated the circles of Christian Biblical scholarship (cf. the studies of Smalley, Loewe, Rosenthal, and others). That does not of itself invalidate either of the author's pro- positions; the notion anyway of a self- contained cultural tradition is hardly tenable. The question of the antiquity of the tradition is, understandably, not pressed (reference to the findings at Dura, etc., pp. 10 ff.). The major part of the work is devoted to illustrations of the Passover ritual (pp. 33-232), for it is here, if anywhere, that the author could find evidence of an independent Jewish graphic tradition. Sequence of treatment follows the several components of the ritual, and within each section according to pro- venance of the material: Sephardic, Ash- kenazi, Italian-Greek. Classification is arrived at both through substantive (e.g. employment or not of a goose-feather in the search for leaven, p. 57) and formal principles (position of the illustration outside or within the text, p. 66). But much of the distinction between community traditions tended to blur and eventually to disappear, for well-known historical reasons, towards the end of the fifteenth century and later (p. 232). Because for this topic his method is selective rather than comprehensive, the author devotes only half as much space to Biblical illustration (pp. 233-333). A repertory of themes is set out on pp. 234-54, from which it emerges that 81 are patriarchal, 61 Mosaic, and 30 only from the historical and prophetical books (including 5 from the Psalter), the last- mentioned of particular interest for the development of messianic imagery (pp. 319-27 : shefokh). And Biblical illustration is anyway subordinate to the requirements of rite, hence of secondary importance for this study (e.g. absence of the Sinai events from all but one of the Sephardic haggadah8: pp. 301-10). On the other hand, it is precisely the Biblical themes which suggest (and indeed have generated many) a comparative study of material outside the Jewish tradition: e.g. the illustrated vernacular Bibles (Bibles morali8ses/ Historienbibeln), the Ashburnham Pentateuch, liturgical collections such as the Book of Hours and the Psalter of St. Louis, didactic works like the Speculum humanae salvationi8 (all mentioned by the author), as well as the Biblia pauperum and Glossa ordinaria. All this material, whether Jewish or Christian, is exegetical, and may be related to contemporary (and earlier) developments in Rabbinic and Patristic literature (of which easily accessible treatments are found in the Cambridge history of the Bible, Vols. I and n). The much shorter chapters on ornament (pp. 337-54) and composition (pp. 357-92) contain further argument for an independent Jewish tradition, not, however, without notice of external influences, e.g. Mozarabic (pp. 346, 350, 357-8). The extent to which ornament here (and elsewhere) can be considered 'purely decorative' is perhaps more of a problem than the author cares to acknowledge : some very pertinent observations on the symbolism of such apparently 'neutral' devices as floral and vegetal motifs have been made by scholars like Morton Smith (Bulletin John Rylands Library, XL, 2, 1958, 473-512) and Jacob Neusner (Early Rabbinic Judaism, Leiden, 1975, 139-215), following upon the quite extraordinary research of E. R. Good- enough. Like literary criticism, iconology is ultimately a comparative study and, in my opinion, best pursued in terms of archetypes with their cross-cultural modifications and adaptations. Two interesting, and for Metzger's work reasonably relevant, literary studies are those of S. Stein, 'The influence of symposia literature on the literary form of the Pesab haggadah' (JJS, vin, 1-2, 1957, 13-44) and H. A. Fischel, Rabbinic literature and Greco- Roman philosophy, Leiden, 1973, in both of which the Jewish re-creation of Hellenistic forms is abundantly illustrated (further examples are found in the work of D. Daube and J. Neusner). Now, the only sound basis for comparative study of Jewish with Christian (and Muslim !) graphic techniques must be the kind of compendium so carefully assembled by Metzger. This project, clearly the product of much industry and critical insight, deserves close attention. J. WANSBROUGH</page></plain_text>
