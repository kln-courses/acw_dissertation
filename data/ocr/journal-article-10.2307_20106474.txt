In the first section I present a view called 'Yoga Titanism,' which does emphasize personal isolation, and point out conceptual similarities with Western forms of Titanism. In the second section I contrast the passive and inert views of the material principle (primarily found in the West) with the dynamic and creative views of Hinduism, which might be one reason why Goddess worship survived in India but not in the West. The third section traces the philosophical origins of ??kta theology with a focus on some basic problems of S?mkhya's purusa-prakrti dualism. In the fourth section I demon strate that Pur?nic writers appropriated the S?rpkhya principle of prakrti and the Ved?ntist concept of m?y? to establish a powerful goddess ontology, one that overcomes the alienation from nature and other selves found in S?mkhya Yoga philosophy. Hindu Tantrics used the concept of ?akti to produce the same results. The fifth section offers counter evidence that shows some expressions of S?kta theology do not express a genuine female voice. If this is so, then this mitigates somewhat the thesis that S?kta theology is an answer to Titanism. Finally, I sketch briefly some encouraging manifestations of S?kta theology International Journal of Hindu Studies I, 2 (August 1997): 265-87 ? 1997 by the World Heritage Press Inc.</page><page sequence="2">266 / Nicholas F. Gier among contemporary Hindu women. YOGA TITANISM I will use the term yogi to refer to a follower of the original S?mkhya Yoga philosophy in which there is a strict dualism between the soul (purusa) and matter (prakrti). As opposed to the pantheism of Ved?nta in general, and the absolute monism of Advaita Ved?nta in particular, S?mkhya Yoga claims that individual souls are real, eternal substances, and that matter is equally real, even in its inactive and nondifferentiated state. Contrary to popular views, the yogi does not unite with any divine reality, not even the mah?yogin lavara the Lord. In so far as purusa souls are self-contained and self-sufficient substances, they are by nature similar to the autonomous selves of Western philosophy. In some respects the individualism and dualism of S?mkhya Yoga is even more extreme than Western views. Not only is the spiritual completely separate from the material, but also all mental operations are on the material side of the cosmic duality. As a result, purusas essentially have no qualities: all one can say about them is that they exist and they know their own nature. The texts also insist that they are not subjects of any action. In their liberated state purusas transcend everything worldly, including the ethical, the social, and the political. The yogi is literally beyond pleasure and pain, beyond good and evil, and even beyond the realm of the gods. Mircea Eliade gives us the reason for the gods' inferior position: It is only through experiences that one acquires freedom. Therefore, the gods (videha, 'disincarnate')?who have no experience because they have no bodies ?have a condition of existence inferior to the human condition, and as such they cannot attain to total deliverance (1975: 53-54). The gods are actually defined in a negative way: the disincarnate ones, those beings without bodies; but, ironically, the final goal of all purusas is a disem bodied state. The being that takes the place of God is the Lord ?svara, who is a projection of the perfect human?the yogi himself writ large on a cosmic scale? the one purusa who has escaped entrapment in nature. Eliade describes the yogVs conquest as 'cosmicization'?a process of 'recasting man in new, gigantic dimensions, of guaranteeing him macranthropic experiences' (1969:98). In his classical work Philosophies of India, Heinrich Zimmer (1956: 231-32) has called the preemption of divine prerogatives and mixing of human and</page><page sequence="3">The yog? and the Goddess I 267 divine attributes the 'heresy of Titanism,' and I claim that S?mkhya Yoga constitutes a principal form of this spiritual Titanism. Titanism is an extreme form of humanism that does not subscribe to consensus views concerning what humans can become and what they should do. Titanism is humanism gone berserk; it is anthropocentricism and anthropomorphism taken to their limits. The Titan insists, as S?mkhya Yoga implies, that human experience is the norm. Titans deliberately blur the line between humanity and divinity; they take over divine prerogatives; and as a result, they see themselves as surpassing the human condition as it is usually understood (for more on Titanism, see Gier 1995). Another classic in Hindu philosophy also lends support for my Titanism thesis. In his book Presuppositions of Indian philosophy, Karl Potter (1963: 153) claims that S?mkhya philosophy is 'excessively anthropomorphic,' and he also focuses on the hubris of the Hindu yogis. Agreeing with Zimmer that asceticism is 'an expression of an extreme will for power' (1956: 400fh), Potter states: Indian philosophy does in fact elevate power, control or freedom to a super eminent position....[T]he ultimate value...is not morality but freedom... complete control over one's environment...even control of the physical sources of power in the universe (1963: 3; emphasis in original). Intensifying his provocative thesis, Potter even suggests that Western humans have better understood their limitations than their Hindu counterparts. The Western view of nature as 'impersonal neither in our control nor controlling us,' is alien to the Hindu mind, which has no doubt about 'the power of the yogi to control not only his body but [also] the bodies of others?indeed, the whole universe' (Potter 1963: 95). In his commentary on the Yoga S?tra, Rammurti Mishra claims that 'deep in the tiny atom of the psyche lies hidden a tremendous force which will lead the psyche to the point of omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence if this force is released properly, systematically, and chronologically' (1973: vi). Mishra has essentially confirmed my thesis about Yoga Titanism, but he does not realize that the attributes he ascribes to the yog? are actually not compatible with the purusa nature. If prakrti is the only source of power, as S?mkhya Yoga teaches, then the liberated yog? is completely impotent not omnipotent. Furthermore, the purusa is not omniscient as the Christian God is?knowing everything past, present, and future?but more like Aristotle's God, a being knowing only its own nature. Finally, the yog? cannot properly claim omnipresence, because he must contend with the infinite number of individual spirits who have a claim on</page><page sequence="4">268 / Nicholas F. Gier the same spiritual 'space.' The purusas are totally isolated and inactive, com pletely cut off from everything else, including the Lord ?svara, who inspired the purusas to become like him in the first place. The lives of the Titans East and West are exceedingly solitary experiences. THE MATERIAL PRINCIPLE: EAST AND WEST Let me rephrase Mishra's incredible claim about the yogTs nature in terms of nuclear physics, ? la Edward Teller: 'Deep inside the hydrogen atom lies hidden a tremendous force which will lead humans to omnipotence and omniscience.' This is not totally fair?physical and spiritual power are being conflated?but the principal point is the conceptual convergence of Eastern and Western forms of Titanism. Even though Yoga Titanism is a benign form of extreme human ism, it nevertheless uses the same language of hubris, power, and conquest as Western Titanism. Let us dwell for a moment on Teller, the Titanism of Cold War militarism, and the co-option of female creative power. The first atomic weapon was called 'Oppenheimer's baby,' and the hydrogen bomb was known as 'Teller's baby.' There was some dispute over whether Teller was mother or father, because some argued that it was Stanislaw Ulam who really came up with the original idea. On this account, Father Ulam inseminated Teller with the idea, and Mother Teller carried the fetus to term. Carol Cohn, who provides a fascinating analysis of this phenomenon of male creation, also finds it significant that all the bombs have male names. Therefore, nuclear scientists, in Cohn's words, have given birth to male progeny with the ultimate power of violent domination over female Nature. The defense intellectuals' project is the creation of abstract formulations to control the forces the scientists created, and to participate thereby in their world-creating/destroying power (1989: 49). The desire to become father of oneself is one of the general features of the psychology of Titanism. By claiming the power of self-creation, the Hindu Titan is able to eliminate the female role and manipulate ordinary reproduction to his own advantage. For example, the Vedic father recreates himself in the mother's womb or a womb substitute. Wendy Dortiger explains: 'In the Indian view the son is made out of the father's self, or actually is that self, and is there fore essentially indistinguishable from him' (1985: 75), For example, in the K?rma Pur?na (1.17.25-27), Visnu directly enters the Aditi's womb and then</page><page sequence="5">The yogi, and the Goddess I 269 is born as V?mana, the dwarf incarnation. Stories of the Buddha's conception (for example, the Mah?vastu 2) clearly indicate that the heavenly Bodhisattva is essentially placing a human version of himself in M?y?'s womb. Womb substi tutes appear in many stories where the Titan gives issue from his mind, his arm, or his thigh. In Hindu mythology the various Manus are Brahma's mind-born sons, and the hero Pjthu is born (more precisely 'churned') from his father's right arm. We also have the incredible example of Brahma giving 'birth' to thousands of sages from semen prematurely ejaculated at the sight of P?rvat? as bride. In Greek mythology we of course have the thigh-born Zeus giving issue to Athena from his mind. The co-option and exploitation of the creative energies of the female have a long history in the West. Hesiod's Theogony still preserved the idea of primor dial chaos and Gaia the earth goddess as the source of all things, but the power of the Greek goddess was gradually co-opted, starting with Zeus and his self created daughter, by male deities, priests, and philosophers. We now know that many ancient Hebrews worshipped goddesses along with Yahweh, but this prac tice was of course never condoned by the priests or prophets. The last trace of the feminine in Hebrew scripture, a figure called Sophia (Yahweh's helpmate in Proverb 8:30), was replaced, except for the Gnostic sects, by the masculine Logos by Philo of Alexandria. For Philo the cosmos becomes the mind-born creation of God, whose Logos makes the world out of absolute nothing, not the feminine chaos implied in Genesis 1:1. The final banishment of the goddess of watery chaos is implied in the declaration in Revelation that in the 'new heaven and new earth...the sea [is] no more' (21:1). In the new creation, the writer is telling us, the irrational goddesses will not bother us anymore. In Greek philosophy the idea of phusis (Latin natura), although not identified as female, was in early times a creative and dynamic material principle. This idea was replaced by inert atoms or by Aristotle's hul?, both passive and inac tive material principles. Aristotle's idea that the female womb was simply a receptacle for self-contained male seed joined similar views of human reproduc tion in the ancient world. The father essentially recreates himself in the womb of the passive mother. One exception to Aristotle's theory of conception is this marvelous passage, cited in David Feldman (1968: 132-33), from the Talmud (Niddah 31a): There are three partners in man.. ~[H]is father supplies the semen of the white substance out of which are formed the child's bones, sinews, nails, and the white of his eyes. His mother supplies the semen of the red substance out of which is formed his skin, flesh, hair and black of his eye. God gives him the soul and breath, beauty of features, eyesight, hearing, speech, understanding,</page><page sequence="6">270 / Nicholas F. Gier and discernment. Although sexist and theocentric, this Jewish view does give an active role to the female in the formation of the fetus. The esoteric tradition preserved the coequal partnership of male and female principles until, as Carolyn Merchant (1980) has shown, witchhunts and mechanistic science virtually eliminated the idea of dynamic nature in the West and the feminine symbolism attached to it. THE GODDESS IN HINDU PHILOSOPHY While the patriarchs in India established a society that devalued women and severely restricted their autonomy, they consistently and openly acknowledged the feminine as the source of cosmic matter and energy. Although the Hindu Goddess tradition may go back as far as the Harrapan civilization, Tracy Pintch man's recent work has demonstrated that the Vedic tradition may have been a greater source than has previously been thought. Pintchman (1994: 19-59) shows that ap ('the waters'), Prthivl/Bh?mi (the earth goddess), Aditi (mother of the gods), Vir?j (coequal with Purusa), V?c (the voice of the mantra and essential breath ?tman), and Sac?/Indr?n? (Indra's consort) all echo in later portrayals of the Goddess. We have seen that the S?mkhya dualism of purusa and prakrti constituted the metaphysical basis for yogic retreat and isolation, but some Pur?nic writers transformed prakrti into a feminine power that sacral izes the body, the passions, nature, and human relations. The Goddess as prakrti was alternatively or simultaneously identified with the creative m?y? of the Ved?ntist tradition and the powerful ?akti of the Tantric schools. J. Tiwari states that the philosophical basis of the Great Goddess should be traced to a theistic adapta tion of Upanisadic Ved?ntism mixed with the S?mkhya conception of Prakrti. As it is, the Goddess is imagined as the Supreme Principle in her own right, as eternally existing, as Supreme Knowledge, as the cause of the bondage and the final liberation of beings, etc. (1985: 65). In the Brahmavaivarta Pur?na (1.28.34-36), R?dh? as prakrti is identified with the energy of brahman itself; she is the true form of brahman or sometimes superior to it (Brown 1974: 126, 134). While early S?mkhya does not identify prakrti as feminine, the later S?mkhya K?rik? contains a vivid metaphor of prakrti as a seductive dancer who entices</page><page sequence="7">The yog? and the Goddess / 271 all the inactive purusas (save one Isvara, who remains free and detached) to join in her creation of the world. The fall into the created world can be reversed only by breaking away from prakrti using the spiritual discipline of lavara?the mah?yogin?as a model for liberation. Successful yogic liberation would leave prakrti without any dance partners, and she then returns to an undifferentiated mass. The S?mkhya K?rik? states: ' "She has been seen by me," thinks the one [purusa] and, hence, loses all interest; "I have been seen," thinks the other [prakrti] and ceases to act' (65). (As we shall see, the bashful prakrti, whose action reflects the ideal Hindu wife, is dramatically transformed in the later S?kta tradition.) Purusas not only attain complete separation from nature but also from lavara. There is no union with ultimate reality as in Upanisadic monism. As the S?mkhya K?rik? states: 'Nature ceases to act, then he [purusa] attains eternal and absolute isolation' (68). Kathleen Erndl acknowledges the influence of both S?mkhya and Ved?nta on &amp;?kta theology, but argues that the latter 'differs from them in its relentless exal tation of the material world. It is more thoroughly "world-affirming" than either of them' (1993: 31). We have seen that S?ipkhya's prakrti is more dynamic and creative than Western ideas of matter, but Erndl notes that S?mkhya ultimately joins the Greek and Christian project of devaluing matter and in turn devaluing the female. (Even though prakrti is the active power, the figurative language of the S?mkhya K?rik? always subordinates it to purusa, usually as a servant/wife to master/husband.) As we have seen, prakrti will, according to the original view, return to an inactive, undifferentiated mass, and the purusas will be free of its interference and distractions. In contrast to the near universal myth of the clash of sky father gods with earth or water goddesses, S?mkhya dualism con tains little conflict or tension. Indeed, enlightened souls discover that nature's intellectual and spiritual qualities (sattva guna) are their ultimate means of escape from her. As the S?mkhya K?rik? states: 'As the insentient milk flows out for the growth of the calf, so does Nature act towards the emancipation of the spirit' (57). The S?mkhya K?rik? (27) contains an argument for the existence of purusa that is valid but, to many readers, not sound. Here it is, in my formulation: (i) all composite objects are for another's use; (ii) all of nature is composite (that is, made of gimas); (Hi) if the user in number [/] is composite, there would be an infinite regress of composite users; therefore, (iv) a simple (noncomposite) thing must exist apart from Nature. To the Western mind the first premise appears to be false, and some of us might be amazed that lavara Krsna has somehow overlooked the obvious distinction between natural things and things of use. As it turns out, however, S?mkhya philosophy is even more anthro pocentric than Western thought. lavara Krsna believes that the first premise is</page><page sequence="8">272 / Nicholas F. Gier true because for him all of nature is merely a means to liberation of human spirits. The fourteenth-century S?mkhya Pravacana S?tra makes this point very clear: 'From Brahma down to a stock, the creation is for the sake of Purusa, till there be discrimination [that is, s?mkhya]1 (3.47). This total devaluation of nature is a feature of both spiritual and technological Titanism, and it is a defi ciency that S?kta theology definitely overcomes. With regard to Ved?ntist influence on the S?kta movement, both Erndl and Brown recognize that Goddess philosophy generally avoids the strict nondualism of the Advaitins. In their enthusiasm for the goddess to preempt all previous ontological states, the S?kta writers sometimes call Devi nirguna brahman (transcending all qualities) as well as saguna brahman (containing all qualities). Making the Goddess free of qualities does not mean that phenomenal world then becomes an illusion, as it does in Advaita Ved?nta. (As an example, only one major commentary on the Devi M?h?tmya, the one by N?goji Bhatta, describes the Goddess as static nirguna brahman. Another commentary by Advaitin Bh?skara emphasizes that the Goddess as nirguna brahman is dynamic in nature and that the world she produces is real [see Coburn 1991: 134, 145]). In general S?kta theology is a thoroughgoing panentheism in which the Goddess is a divine matrix for all things (hence, not being any one thing in particular) rather than an abstract unity transcending all qualities. (I use the term 'panentheism' rather than 'pantheism' because Coburn [1984: 304] has rightly concluded that the Goddess is both transcendent and immanent.) Brown points out that 'abso lute identity would preclude any real relationship' (1974: 128) and relations with people and nature are the real genius of the Goddess religion East and West. S?mkhya's commitment to the plurality of souls serves as an important counter to the monistic impersonalism of Advaita Ved?nta. If selves are actually unreal, then it is difficult to understand how there could be any intelligible basis for personal and social relations. In Aldous Huxley's After many a summer dies the swan, the protagonist says: 'The more power we have, the more intensely do we feel our solitude. I have enjoyed much power in my life' (1939: 175). In terms of the S?kta theol ogy we have just discussed, this Western view of power, the power of the Titan, is an illusion. This view of power is not exclusive to the West, for Hindu yogis have claimed that they have surpassed 'the gods in the realm of divinity' (Maitri Upanisad 4.4). This claim is open to P?rvatf s rebuke (see epigraph) that no one escapes nature and the limitations of its cosmic web of relations, and even the S?mkhya philosophers held that prakrti is the source of all power. Therefore, the completely autonomous soul, according to S?kta theology, is impotent and passive, unmasking the claim of yogic 'atomic' power by Mishra as a vain and empty boast. The yog? is a paper tiger and a false Titan: he claims powers and</page><page sequence="9">The yogi and the Goddess / 273 attributes that his own philosophy denies him. Even if this S?mkhya-S?kta theory is wrong, most of us would agree that the power of Huxley's protagonist is ultimately destructive. As we shall see, Devi's sakti, as opposed to the gods' tejas, is power that she shares with everything in the universe. In the West the concept of shared power is expressed most clearly in feminist and process philosophies, which stand in opposition to the orthodox Christian view of divine omnicausality and God's total monopoly of power (see Gier 1991). The power of the Titan is based on possession, competition, and fear, whereas a view of shared power requires openness and trust on the part of the participants. One could easily argue that isolation and possession actually diminish any constructive use of personal power. John Cobb and David Griffin, two process philosophers, state that the persuasive power 'to open the future and give freedom is a greater power than the supposed power of absolute control' (1976: 119). PUR?NIC EXPRESSIONS OF THE GODDESS In the Pur?nas the creative powers of prakrti are generally identified with each of the Hindu gods: rajas for Brahma the creator, sattva for Visnu the preserver, and tamos for ?iva the destroyer. (The more sectarian texts sometimes combine all the gunas in either Siva or Visnu.) The Pur?nas that favor Devi, however, make it clear that these powers are essentially feminine in nature. Notice the explicit use of S?mkhya terminology in these hymns to Dev? from the Dev? M?h?tmya: You are the primordial material (prakrti) of everything, manifesting the triad of constituent strands [of gunas] (1.59). [You are] the cause of all the worlds...the supreme, original, untransformed Prakrti (4.6). O you, the eternal, who become the power of creation, sustenance, and destruction, abiding in the qualities (gunas) of primordial matter (prakrti), actually consisting of those qualities, O N?r?yan?, praise be to you! (11.10). The Great Goddess, here associated with Visnu's (that is, N?r?yana's) ?akti, has taken over all the powers traditionally associated with the male trinity. As we shall see, S?kta theology teaches that the gods, following the implications of</page><page sequence="10">274 / Nicholas F. Gier purusa-prakrti dynamic, are essentially impotent without their iaktis. In his insightful article 'Consort of none, iakti of all,' Thomas Coburn (1982) makes two significant observations. First, the Dev? of the Dev? M?h?tmya is not specifically paired with either Siva or Visnu, making this one of the first truly S?kta Pur?nas; and second, many of the ?akti names are original with this text. The authors) obviously know that traditionally Indra* s consort is Sac?, Visnu's wife is Laksm?, and Siva's mate is Sat?, Um?, or P?rvat?; but they deliberately coin feminized versions of the male names?Indr?nl for Indra, VaisnavT for Visnu, and MaheSvan for Siva?so as to dissociate these feminine divinities from any previous mythological connections. The authors) very much wish to stress that these are not just wives of male deities; rather, they are very much their own power or, more precisely, Devfs iakti. One critical moment in the narrative of the Dev? M?h?tmya might call for some qualification to the current thesis. Knowing that Mahis?sura cannot be defeated by either man or beast, all the male gods combine their own energy (tejas) to create the Goddess. The passage (Dev?M?h?tmya 2.9-12), in Coburn's translation (1991: 40), is as follows: Then from Visnu's face, which was filled with rage, Came forth a great fiery splendor (tejas), (and also from the faces) of Brahma and Siva. Also from the bodies of the other gods, Indra, and the others, Came forth a great fiery splendor, and it became unified in one place. An exceedingly fiery mass like a flaming mountain Did the gods see there, filling the firmament with flames. That peerless splendor, born from the bodies of all the gods, Unified and pervading the triple world with its lustre, became a woman. The fact that Dev? is produced from the gods' tejas appears to mitigate the thesis that Dev? is a cosmic power truly her own. Coburn has captured the meaning of tejas nicely by combining the ideas of brilliance and luminosity. Other meanings are 'splendor,' 'glory,* or 'energy.' Tejas can also mean virile semen, which relates it to another word for male power?v?rya, meaning 'manliness, heroism; male seed.' (As Brian Smith [1994: 102-4] has shown, vtrya and ojos [might, force, power] are usually associated with Indra and the Ksatriyas, while tejas is connected to Agni as the god of the priests.) For example, Agni's 'fiery seed' (tejas), which later becomes Siva's, the incredibly hot semen that cannot be contained by anything except the goddess Ganga (as P?rvatFs substitute womb), gives rise to the war-god Skanda.</page><page sequence="11">The yog? and the Goddess I 275 Interestingly enough, especially for those used to Western ideas of divinity, tejas is not a necessary attribute; that is, it is not inherent in the nature of the gods themselves. This explains why the devas and the asuras both need soma or amrta to keep themselves 'energized,* and that is the reason the Manusmrti (4.186, 11.122, 11.247) frequently refers to tejas's origin in the Vedas and the rituals they contain. Tejas is not only an attribute of the gods and antigods, but it is also found in the Manus, sages, priests, kings, and ordinary men. (Curi ously, it is by ojas, not tejas, that the first Manu creates the universe [Manu smrti 1.4, 1.6].) The priest 'takes on a physical form of brilliant energy (tejas) and attains the supreme condition'; and the king is 'made from particles of these lords and gods, therefore he surpasses all living beings in brilliant energy (tejas)' (Manusmrti 3.93, 7.5). Tejas ebbs and flows, as can be seen in the man who breaks a vow of chastity, sheds his semen, and loses his tejas back to the gods (Manusmrti 11.122). The verbal root ?ak gives rise to at least three words in the Vedas: Sakra ('powerful one'), a name for Indra; ?ac? (personalized as Indra's consort Sac?); and ?akti. The latter two words are used infrequently and have the general mean ing of 'ability, power, capacity'; but they are not yet related to any notion of cosmic power as feminine. In the Manusmrti (4.41, 4.44) it is significant to note that a man loses his tejas by having sex with a menstruating woman and that a priest loses his vitality by looking at a woman 'putting on her eye make up, rubbing oil on herself, undressed, or giving birth.' Even in their misogyny the authors) of the Manusmrti give a back-handed compliment to the power of woman. Returning to the Dev? M?h?tyma, let us look at a crucial passage: 'Whatever and wherever anything exists.. .0 you who have everything as your very soul, of all that, you are the power (?akt?y (1.63). We can see that the first S?kta theolo gians have drawn on the Vedic ?akti to make a full-blown deity, separate from, and now fundamental to, the existence of all gods and goddesses. As Coburn phrases it: rather than being 'quasi-independent of its possessor' (the Vedic view), Sakti now 'is not something that a deity has, but something that the Goddess is* (1984: 147; emphasis in original). ?akti is something Dev? has as a necessary attribute and, panentheistically, something that everything else in the universe has by virtue of Devi's omnipresence. Phrased metaphysically, ?akti is always a substance not an attribute, while the reverse is true of tejas, where even in Hindu physics fire (tejas) is just one of the attributes, along with air and water, of a basic substance (bh?fa). S?kta theology appears to have broken the vicious cycle of the Vedic maxim, explained superbly by Smith (1990), that one gains power only at another's expense. The Vedic power game, as with most patriarchal concepts of power, is</page><page sequence="12">276 / Nicholas F. Gier a zero-sum game. Those who control the sacrifice, either by hook or crook (with the gods dominating in the 'crook' department), control tejas. So the result is constant battles between gods and antigods, gods and ascetics, and priests and kings. The S?kta view is different: even though Mahisa loses his tejas?Dev? teases him to show his 'womanish' nature (Skanda Pur?na 1.3.1.10)?he still presumably has his own sakti, for this is a power that all beings have by virtue of their very existence. If Dev? has her own ontological status as supreme prakrti and iakti, then we are compelled to read her 'creation' out of the gods' tejas much differently than one might initially. In the context of S?kta ontology, it must mean that the gods were simply able to make her appear or, as we shall see, to add attributes to a preexisting primordial power. It might also mean that the gods are now assigning, as a sign of deference (they give her all their weapons), their 'bril liance' to Dev? and become 'dim' in the same way that Siva becomes inert when K?l? dances upon him. Significant also is the fact that Dev? calls on a god's sakti, not his tejas, to join in her fight against Mahisa. Equally significant is the fact that when Mahisa complains about being 'ganged up on' by so many goddesses, Dev? draws all the saktis into herself and finishes the battle alone. Finally, even though the text refers back to the creation out of the gods' tejas? 'born from the bodies of the gods' (Skanda Pur?na 4.34)?the very next verse states that the Goddess was 'born (from) the body of Gaur? (=P?rvat?),' which essentially means that she is born out of herself, because, as Coburn (1984: 154) sees it, Gaur? is a 'supreme form of the Goddess.' Or to see the question even more fundamentally the author(s) clarify Devfs 'birth': 'Then, even though she is called "eternal," she is said to be "born in the world" ' (Skanda Pur?na 1.48). My interpretation is confirmed by looking at the same event as portrayed in the Dev? Bh?gavata Pur?na. Just as in the Dev? M?h?tyma, the Goddess, here called Mahalaksm?, appears out of the gods' tejas\ but in the detailed descrip tion that follows, it is clear that the gods are simply adding attributes to, or enhancing preexisting attributes of, a primordial deity. If Dev? is nothing but the sum total of the gods' fiery energy, then the following statement makes no sense: 'Even Brahma, Visnu, Mahesa, and Indra are never competent enough to describe her form properly' (Dev? Bh?gavata Pur?na 5.8.55). The Goddess is 'constant, she is always existent;...She assumes different forms for the fulfill ment of the deva's ends' (5.8.57). Several passages identifies Dev? as having her own tejas (5.9.53); and because she infuses tejas in the foam that kills Vrtra, she is credited with this victory, displacing the earlier attribution to Indra. Now in Dev?'s possession tejas, as Brown (1990: 214, 286n67) has shown, is not only expressed in her anger, but also, significantly, as a loving and protective light, the latter seen when she uses tejas as a protective shield for the gods</page><page sequence="13">The yog? and the Goddess I 277 against the asuras (7.28.51-52). In a clear allusion to S?rrikhya, the author(s) describe Dev? as the actor and the gods as mere spectators. The Dev? 'comes out of that mass of celestial light' (5.8.61), which suggests that she comes out on her own stage with the gods' tejas as its brilliant lighting. Finally, as the 'mother of the gods' (5.10.2), it is Dev? who produces the devas not the other way around. The Dev? Bh?gavata Pur?na combines Ved?nta, S?mkhya, and Tantra in a marvelous synthesis. Dev? is first and foremost nirguna ?akti or mah?m?y?. In her saguna form the Goddess is the divine creatrix, and a combination of sattvic ?akti, rajasic ?akti, and tamasic fakti brings the world into existence. For this purpose she manifests herself as Mah?lak?m? (sativa guna) making all intellec tual and spiritual activity possible; as Mah?sarasvat? (rajas guna) empowering all human and animal activity; and as Mah?k?li (tamas guna) giving us all things inert and death itself. (In other texts, such as Var?ha Pur?na 90.29-33, Mah?laksm? and Mah?sarasvat? switch gunas.) After creation Mah?dev? reveals herself as the terrible K?l? and her consort Siva; as Laksm?, goddess of wealth and wife of Visnu; and finally, as Sarasvat?, Brahma's wife and the goddess of knowledge and wisdom. It might appear that K?l?, the blood-thirsty goddess of death and destruction, presents a very negative image of women. Lina Gupta, however, has demon strated the truth of the time-honored dictum that first impressions can be deceiv ing. For Gupta K?l? represents a revolt against patriarchy's rules about the proper dress and behavior of women. Instead of wearing a beautiful sari, K?l? is essentially nude; and rather than being adorned with jewels, she wears skulls, severed heads, and arms. In contrast to P?rvat?, K?l? is an independent 'spouse' to Siva; she does not perform any wifely duties, she has no children, and Siva is constantly attempting to counter her unconventional activities. Violating Manu*s laws, K?lfs 'femininity belongs to her and not to her husband' (Gupta 1991: 36). Even more significant is Gupta's observation that Kali's wrath may well be the expression of the anger of all India's oppressed women. As Gupta states: The dark goddess is perpetually present in the inner and outer struggles faced by women at all times. Her darkness represents those rejected and suppressed parts of female creativity, energy, and power that have not been given a chance to be actualized (1991: 37). The Dev? Bh?gavata Pur?na (3.2-7) presents an interesting feminist twist to the story of Brahma's mind-born sons, who turn out to be sterile. Brahma complains that they are more interested in meditating and performing austerities rather than in creating worlds. In earlier accounts Brahma succeeds in producing</page><page sequence="14">278 / Nicholas F. Gier a female partner with whom he can copulate and produce other creatures; but the Dev? Bh?gavata portrays Brahma as incapable of making himself a consort, and the gods are at a loss about how to create anything at all. The Goddess kidnaps them in her chariot, takes them to her 'Jewel Island,' whereupon she turns them into females so that they now know the secrets of procreation. Brown (1990: 138-39, 206-12) shows how this account of the Dev?'s Jeweled Island popu lated with female deities is a direct counter to the Mah?bh?rata's account of N?rada's journey to the White Island, where the exclusively male residents are awaiting final union with the Lord. These stories clearly display the tension between the world-denying asceticism of the yoga ideal and the world-affirming themes of S?kta theology that are at the focus of this essay. One of the most dramatic demonstrations of the Goddess as a necessary mate rial cause is found in the Ked?ra Khanda of the Skanda Pur?na. Although not considered a S?kta Pur?na, it has been described by Doniger as containing a 'primitive' and 'cynical' feminism because of its portrayal of strong, subversive women, which results in a 'satire on Hindu misogyny' (1993: 61, 73). One of the main myths of this work is the story of the birth Siva's son Skanda (=Kum?ra=K?rttikeya), who is destined to kill the asura T?raka. In order for this prophecy to be fulfilled, the gods have to bring Siva and P?rvat? together in sexual union. The gods persuade Himav?n, god of the Himalayan mountains, to offer his daughter in marriage. When the two succeed in obtaining an audience with Siva, the great god commands that P?rvat? be removed from his presence. Contrary to his wish, P?rvat? steps forward and engages him philosophically: 'Who are you? Who is the subtle prakrti, O holy Lord?' Expressing what can only be called a form of Yoga Titanism, Siva declares to P?rvat?: *I am destroy ing prakrti by means of the greatest penance itself. In fact, O lady of good eye brows, I will stay without prakrti.9 P?rvat?'s answer is swift and to the point: 'You should consider who you are, and who nature is....How could you tran scend nature? What you hear, what you eat, what you see?it's all Nature. How could you be beyond Nature? You are enveloped in Nature, even though you don't know it' (Skanda Pur?na 1.1.21.18-22; Doniger's translation [1993: 78]). P?rvat? has adopted basic S?mkhya philosophy, but with a significant twist: without nature all souls are inert and lifeless, and yogic isolation from the world is no longer seen as a spiritual ideal. P?rvat?'s rebuke also implies that for Hindu philosophy nature now has intrinsic value. Prakrti's dance is not tempo rary and is not just a means to an end: the liberation of purusas to their isolated lokas. Rather, Devi's dance?now performed by Siva, her principal ally?is eternal, and her message is clear: return to the earth, to the body, the passions, and to ordinary human relations. In contrast to the ascetic tradition, the Goddess supports all activities from worldly enjoyment (bhukti) to spiritual liberation</page><page sequence="15">The yog? and the Goddess I 279 (mukti). The latter thesis is particularly well-supported in our present text wherein P?rvat? essentially becomes the embodiment of Kama, even after Siva has burned him to ashes with his third eye. The gods fall into despair, and they beg Siva to resuscitate the god of desire. The gods warn that the world cannot live without love and that it will be ruined as a result of his rash act. Siva refuses to see the logic of this version of P?rvat?'s argument that isolated purusas are empty and impotent without the life-giving qualities of prakrti. Siva repeats his warning that kdma is the cause of the downfall of all beings, including the gods, who earlier, when they recruited Kama, admitted that they, too, were prey to lust As a rejoinder, the gods, never known for their philosophical acumen, present a very subtle and effective argument. They remind Siva that the universe was created by desire; 'indeed, the whole of it is in the form of k?ma. That k?ma is not killed' (Skanda Pur?na 1.1.21.91). The gods then lay the philosophical noose around the great god's neck: 'It is from k?ma that the fierce krodha (anger) takes origin. You yourself have been won over by krodha* (Skanda Pur?na 1.1.21.95). This response makes Siva even more angry, and he becomes 'desirous of burning (everything) with his third eye.' In her Asceticism and eroticism in the mythology of Siva, Doniger presents a brilliant and thorough analysis of the Siva-K?ma-P?rvat? relationship, and one of the most insightful references she (Doniger 1973: 150) found was to a Bud dhist poem, Vidy?kara's Subh?sitaratnakosa (4), which reveals succinctly the fundamental problem of Hindu asceticism: Love and anger both are states hostile to self-control What then did Siva hope to gain by slaying Love in anger? The anger of the gods and sages, and the alacrity by which they incinerate their opponents, represents a fatal flaw in their spiritual discipline. Rather than find a Golden Mean, like the Buddha or Aristotle recommend, the Hindus are notori ous for pursuing, as Doniger suggests (1973: 82), the Golden Extremes of excessive eroticism on the one hand and excessive asceticism on the other?both filled with the pride and hubris of a Titan. Although not considered a S?kta work, the Skanda Pur?na already presents P?rvat? (here called Girij?) as the 'mother of the universe*: it was she 'who created the three worlds, along with Brahma and others. Making use of the qualities of rajas, sattva, and tamas, she caused the origin, sustenance, and</page><page sequence="16">280 / Nicholas F. Gier annihilation (of the worlds)' (1.1.21.62, 66). P?rvat?'s plan for the seduction of Siva does not follow Buddhist lines; rather, it is eminently Hindu?thoroughly excessive and thoroughly dialectical. (Her tapas is so great that it dialectically coincides with the heat of her desire to become his mate.) P?rvat?'s penance produces a fire so great that it threatens the triple worlds. This leads to yet another embassy of the gods to Siva, in this case, led by Visnu. This time Siva relents, predicting that P?rvat? will bring Kama back to life. He still, however, warns about the dangers of desire, but at least now he concedes the winning point in the previous debate: 'It is from it (k?ma) that anger is produced' (Skanda Pur?na 1.1.22.26). Siva concedes much more in the scene in which the two lovers become engaged. While earlier praised as the 'father, mother, and lord' of all the worlds, Siva now proclaims P?rvat? to be the creatrix of the universe by means of her m?y? and her prakrti. The translator G. Tagore finds it odd that Siva launches into a detailed exposition of S?tnkhya cosmogony (with a bit of Ved?nta mixed in), but I find it both natural and particularly conducive to my thesis. Siva admits that P?rvat? as prakrti is 'capable of action continuously,' while he as the purusa is totally inactive. (This gives Siva the lame excuse that it must be P?rvat? who actually proposes marriage!) The crucial passage is the following: 'The being devoid of guna has become enveloped by gunas....The independent one has become dependent. O Goddess, a great thing has been achieved by you' (Skanda Pur?na 1.1.22.95-96). The Great Goddess has persuaded a great, but reluctant, yog? that he must merge with prakrti, which amounts to a total trans formation of the S?mkhya philosophy. The alleged independence of the isolated purusa has been replaced by an interdependent social self. Kama has indeed been reborn, namely, in the sakti of the androgyne that is Siva-P?rvat??the Ardha n?r?svara. By means of a grand coincidentia oppositorum they have both reached a double goal: the fire of yogic tapas and the fire of k?ma. In S?kta theology the possibility of both mukti and bhukti has been combined in one deity. DOES THE GODDESS SPEAK WITH A WOMAN'S VOICE? The defense now rests on my hypothesis that the belief in a dynamic and creative material principle explains the pervasive role the Goddess plays in Hindu religious life. It is now time to raise some objections. Sadly for the theoretician and philosopher, social realities do not always map nicely onto metaphysical theories. The marriage of Siva and P?rvat??of purusa and prakrti?did not end the strong ascetic tradition of yogic personal isolation and</page><page sequence="17">The yog? and the Goddess / 281 escape. Contrary to Stanley Kurtz's psychoanalytic theory, in which he substi tutes a Durg? complex for the Oedipus complex, large numbers of Hindu males have not experienced a 'successful developmental journey through the world of women' (1992: 174). Even within Hindu Goddess worship, male priests are still largely in control of the ritual and access to Mah?dev?. Why is that the god desses are still primarily portrayed (starting with comic books for the kids) as beautiful, submissive wives? Why are some males, even in the Indian context, still so confused and defensive about female power? In India and the West this male frustration has unfortunately turned into a widespread misogyny, whose tragic consequences are found everywhere, especially in the West, in the physical and sexual abuse of women. A 'folk' Pur?na in Kannada presents the goddess ?dieakti in a particularly negative way. ?disakti, true to the S?kta theology, is the creator of the triple world, and as she attains puberty she exclaims: 'Ahha, nothing in sight to satisfy my passion, to please my youth. I've to (be)get one myself (Rama nujan's translation [1993: 107]). She then creates Brahma, who proves to be a paragon of virtue and resists her advances. For his impudence he is burned to ashes. ?dieakti creates Visnu, who is also aghast at his mother's immorality, and he too is killed by the 'eye of fire' in her palm. Her third son Siva skillfully tricks his mother into giving him her ?akti power and then burns her to ashes. He resurrects his brothers and creates three gentle and obedient wives from the Goddess' ashes. Although there is clear recognition of the feminine origin of all cosmic power, this myth is obviously a patriarchal subversion of the positive aspects of S?kta theology. During the celebration of Dasain in Nepal the text of the Dev? M?h?tmya is read to men only and the ritual is performed only by initiated males. Anthro pologist Lynn Bennett has observed that while Nepali men are much more involved in Durg? worship, Nepali women are exclusively involved in the cult of P?rvat?. Her explanation is that 'Durg? reflects a predominantly male view, focused on the problematic woman, while P?rvat? presents Hindu women's own idealized perceptions of themselves and the problems they experience' (Bennett 1983: 278). It is interesting to note that Durg? worship in Nepal was imported, ironically, from south India rather than the north, where Durg?'s role as good daughter-wife is emphasized much more. In Calcutta, for example, the festival culminates in Durg? being welcomed into all homes as the returning daughter, far removed from in-laws where she was perceived as a threat. More specific and sexist is the north Indian rule that a husband must pay for fourteen recitations of the Dev? M?h?tmya in order to control an unruly wife, but he only has to pay for twelve recitations to defeat an enemy (see Coburn 1991: 222fn). A recitation of the Dev? M?h?tyma may protect a Hindu male's penis</page><page sequence="18">282 / Nicholas F. Gier and semen (his tejas) and help him get a good wife. Therefore, it looks as if actual Dev? worship contains much more sexism than my thesis should admit. Durg? is, after all, the king's goddess, and her cult is administered by him and his priests. In the not too distant past these same men went to war with her blessings, usually right after her annual celebration in the fall. (In many texts of the Mah?bh?rata there is an invocation to Durg? just before the beginning of the Bhagavad G?ta.) If Durg? is leader of armies, then she is not so different from Yahweh the Warrior, Lord of Hosts (armies). These observations raise problems for my thesis that S?kta theology serves as an antidote to Hindu Titanism. If Durg? is primarily a projection of male desires to control the world, and if Durg? is nothing but a female Titan, then my thesis is rejected, not supported. In this view the Goddess represents an uneasy fusion of the stereotypical compassionate mother and aggressive male-warrior. The maternal role is virtually absent in the Dev? M?h?tmya, and the words tejas and v?rya appear frequently in the sense of virile, heroic power (3.38; see also Skanda Pur?na 1.3.1.10.68). But even in the Dev? Bh?gavata Pur?na, where the maternal role is strong, anger, violence, and aggression is also present Here (Dev? Bh?gavata Pur?na 5.10.32-34) her battle with Mahisa is portrayed as a contest between a real man (the Goddess) and a eunuch demon who has, as Doniger (1980: 82) translates it, 'no balls.' The Dev? reminds the demons that she has 'manliness' (paurusa) as her 'inherent nature,' obviously referring to her purusa nature. Although the final goal of the authors) of the Dev? Bh?gavata is to present the Goddess as beyond gender, it is still significant to note that in her cosmic manifestation (visvar?pa) she appears in a male form complete with penis. Another objection could be raised to the thesis that a dynamic material prin ciple is a necessary condition for Goddess philosophy. It has been said that one of the major philosophical shifts in Tantric Buddhism is that the powers of the male and female agents are reversed: the male is now active and creative and the female inactive and passive. (Hindu Tantrism preserves the original concept of dynamic femininity.) This Buddhist reversal may already be evident in the pre Tantric stories of the Buddha's birth, where the Sanskrit word m?y? is used to name the Buddha's mother, but her role is completely passive in nature. This objection, however, is based on misinterpreting the Buddhist prajn? and up?ya as equivalents of the Hindu Siva and Sakti. Miranda Shaw's recent book on women and Tantric Buddhism also helps us clarify some basic issues. First, Shaw believes that the 'confluence of Buddhism and S?ktism is such that Tantric Buddhism could properly be called "S?kta Buddhism" ' (1994: 33). Second, her research has suggested that women were highly valued in both Hindu and Buddhist Tantric schools, so that this revalorization of women had</page><page sequence="19">The yog? and the Goddess I 283 more to do with the Tantric subversion of conventional gender roles than with any attention to the nature of the material principle. Feminists may be inclined to praise Tantric Buddhism for the fact that it, especially in its Tibetan schools, produced a very large number of women spiri tual masters. In the context of Yoga Titanism, however, one might question whether encouraging SDiritual asceticism in women locks them into traditional male roles. In a provocative observation about Buddhist discipline, Rita Gross states: 'Maybe they are simply the creations of patriarchs who use them to con trol life and distance themselves from others! Maybe that is why Buddhism sometimes seems to glorify aloneness and be deficient in its emphasis on rela tionship!' (1991: 83). A mitigating factor here is the fact that Tantric yog?s and yogin?s are much more world- and body-affirming than their non-Tantric coun terparts. This means that Yoga Titanism, as we have defined it, may not be as strong in Tantric philosophy and religion. This is especially true with regard to the concept of self in Tantric Buddhism. Shaw's rich description of this self contrasts significantly with the S?mkhya purusa or JainajTva: 'not a "soul" in a "body" but rather a multilayered mind-body continuum of corporeality, affectiv ity, cognitivity, and spirituality whose layers are subtly interwoven and mutu ally interactive' (1994: 11). As we have seen, the concept of an autonomous, nonmaterial self at odds with the body and nature is the distinctive feature of Titanism East and West. CONCLUSION Westerners in search of a Goddess in eclipse for nearly two thousand years have the principal advantage of starting fresh. Most Western women (and men, too) are in control of their own research and the reconstruction of the myths they wish to live by. They are free to draw inspiration from a vast crosscultural reservoir of spiritual resources. If they perceive that the ancient goddess worship has been compromised by too much male interference, then they can choose from myths selectively or create new ones of their own. Cynthia Humes' field research in Uttar Pradesh indicates that more Hindu women are now willing to reform their own tradition. Humes agrees that there is a fundamental residue of sexism and patriarchal subversion in traditional Dev? worship: '[I]ronically, men may more closely express divinity than females, even when the Divine is viewed ultimately as the Goddess, for men are not "permeated" with evils as women are' (1997: 52). Nevertheless, Humes has observed significant inno vations. At the Vindhy?cal temple near Mirzapur more women, having learned</page><page sequence="20">284 / Nicholas F. Gier Sanskrit in school, are now reciting the Dev? M?h?tmya by themselves. Other women sing praises to the Goddess in the vernacular, and one of the most famous singers is called guru by her own husband. Other women are 'chan neling' for the Goddess or, in a substantial break from tradition, are creating modern dances for h?r. In her book Staying alive, Vandana Shiva draws on the principles of Goddess philosophy and critiques the standard model of economic development in her own Indian subcontinent. She calls it 'maldevelopment' and claims that it is the product of a patriarchal view of the world. Shiva describes this philosophy as one that ruptures the cooperative unity of masculine and feminine, and places man, shorn of the feminine principle, above nature and women, and separated from both....Nature and women are turned into passive objects, to be used and exploited for the uncontrolled and uncontrollable desires of alienated man (1988: 6). Shiva's operative word for feminine power is prakrti, and she believes that India's women (and the men who work with them in ecologically sound occupa tions) are the current embodiment of Goddess' dynamic, healing power. She does not, however, realize that prakrtVs philosophical origins represent a dual ism and a view of nature that is just as objectionable as the one she finds in Western developmental models. Nevertheless, Shiva and the brave women she writes about are using S?kta theology to fight their battles over the forests, wate, and food of India. Finally, let me feature Mallika Sarabhai, Gujarati dancer and actress, most famous for her role as Draupad? in Peter Brook's Mah?bh?rata. In a recent interview in the Deccan herald, Sarabhai tells how she fought for a rewriting of DraupadTs character. As she explains: 'Despite researching the Mah?bh?rata for eleven years, they are white Anglo-Saxon men. To them, the whole concept of women as Shakti was unknown' (De 1995: 1). Since then she has gone on to choreograph and stage Sakti and Sita's daughters, both powerful expressions of S?kta philosophy. The first piece is in English, and when women's groups encouraged her to translate it and tour Indian villages, she realized that she had to produce something more appropriate for village women. The result was Sita's daughters, which incorporated stories of rape and female infanticide from village women themselves. The rural performances take three times as long as the city ones, because the village women insist on interrupting the show and telling their own stories. In this paper I have addressed several related questions. The first was a quest</page><page sequence="21">The yog? and the Goddess I 285 for the reason why Dev? worship thrives in India but died out in the West Even though social practices do not necessarily follow from belief in metaphysical categories, I have shown that the strength of S?kta theology in India has some thing to do with how Hindus have conceived of the material principle. The wor ship of the Goddess appears to require that we view matter, as did the ancients and Hindus today, as dynamic, organic, interrelated, and alive. Second, we found that since males have written the scripture and still control the ritual, the Hindu Goddess does not always speak with a true feminine voice. Finally, how ever, we have found hopeful signs of Hindu women reclaiming the S?kta tradi tion as a means for constructive personal and social action. These women will surely succeed in giving the Hindu Goddess a distinctively female voice, and they will form a vanguard against the various liabilities of Hindu Titanism. Notes 1.
