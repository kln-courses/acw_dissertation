<plain_text><page sequence="1">8o THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY TOWARD A LOGIC OF LIBERALISM T NHE dominant American political perspective is welfarism. The basic idea is simple: that social policy must be ar- ranged so as to promote the general welfare, and that the general welfare is a function of the welfare of the people involved. From being a guide to action, this has become a way of thought. For many philosophers, it exhausts the possibilities. They admit no al- ternatives to it. Every proposed position comes out a welfare doc- trine of some sort. Political theory is smoothed out in this manner, but is also impoverished. Or at least, this I shall argue. I A welfarist says that the good of the whole is a function of the good of its parts. The question is, what function? Suppose that what is good for each person appears in his utility assignments, that the utility a person assigns to a proposition measures how good its being true would be for him. Our question asks for what is called a social welfare function, a rule that, given all the utility assignments of each of the people involved, determines a single set of assignments for the group as a whole. Different political thinkers can be read as proposing different such rules. Thus John Stuart Mill is seen as a utility maximizer. Mill is read as saying that the proper welfare function is that which assigns to a situation the sum of the utilities assigned to it by all involved. He is said to hold that the general welfare is served where the situa- tion (or any of the several) with the greatest such sum is established. John Rawls's writings are also made to fit. Rawls emerges as a utility maximinner. Call that person worst-off in a situation who assigns it a utility lower than that assigned it by anyone else. (If there are several who assign a utility than which no one else's is lower, each of them is worst-off.) The maximin-utility rule is to assign utilities to social situations so as to reflect the relative posi- tions of the people who would be worst-off in them. That is, the rule is to assign to a situation a greater utility than to another if and only if the worst-off person in the first would be better off in that situation than the worst-off person in the second would be in that one. Rawls is said to hold that the general welfare is served where the situation (or any of the several situations) assigned the greatest utility in this manner is established. The welfarist adaptation of Mill is plausible. Mill himself often endorsed something like it. And often it is the only possible under- 0022-362X/80/7702/0080$01.90 1 1980 The Journal of Philosophy, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">TOWARD A LOGIC OF LIBERALISM 8I standing of him. But on this matter of how to read him, we can't take Mill at his word. His avowals of party loyalty are sometimes no more than pious gestures. They serve to discharge his obligations. His thinking is independent of them. Even in On Liberty Mill pays his respects "I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions"'-but this is here purely perfunctory. Mill's mind is on other things. What matters to him is the promotion of growth and vigor and imagination. All his discussions focus on that. There is no higher appeal.2 As for Rawlsian utility maximinning, Rawls is explicit in his re- jection of this. His book is ambiguous on the point, but his subse- quent papers are not. Rawls holds that people's values-their utili- ties and desires-have nothing to do with his project. "For the purposes of justice, the appropriate basis . . . is . . . not strength of feeling or intensity of desire . . . . Passionate convictions or zealous aspirations do not, as such, give anyone a claim upon social resources."3 People's values are not to be used in assessing their institutions. Rather, it goes the other way: their circumstances govern their values. For "people are able to control and to revise their wants and their desires in the light of circumstances . . . and have [the] responsibility for doing so, provided the principles of justice are fulfilled" (97). The argument againstour looking to values is that these themselves are derivative. They derive from the very institution we want to bring under scrutiny. "[T]he conceptions of the good that individuals form depend in part on their natural abili- ties and the way these are shaped and realized by social and other contingencies."4 People's values are nothing basic. They are acci- dents of place and time and of social reinforcement. The moral credit of a decent society can't be made to rest on criteria it itself sets up. Rawls's concern is not with utilities but with what he calls primary goods. Different people lay out different lives for themselves. Some people fulfill their life-plans; other people do not.

Not all people fare alike-there is no injustice in that. What is unjust is only some people's having a better chance than others, or a chance that is better than their contributions are likely to warrant. A just society sees to it that no one has an improper advantage. It arranges a fair distribution of the usual prerequisite assets, a fair distribution of "rights and liberties, opportunities and powers, income and wealth."5 These (plus a person's self-respect) are the basic primary goods. Mill's position was the same. Social justice has to do with pro- viding the means for everything else. Mill insisted on schooling for the young and on free access to information. lie stressed the right to encounter opinions conflicting with one's own, and also the right to develop unorthodox views and unpopular purposes. What con- cerned him most was autonomy-the terms he used were 'freedom', 'individuality', and 'character'. His position, like Rawls's, was that a good society encourages this. Promoting the general welfare need not be its overriding concern, but rather each person's being equipped to promote his own. This is the idea of liberalism, or at least the core of it. Both Mill and Rawls are liberals in this funda- mental sense. Mill, to be sure, often hedges on it. Where he speaks of practical matters, the claims of freedom come first. In other, more theoretical contexts, they play a more modest part. Here the defense of freedom is only a secondary rule, a reminder that time has shown that, by and large, freedom serves welfare. There are many such rules. In the press of life, we must usually keep to them. But where they are mute, or where they conflict, the rule of utility-maximizing asserts its underlying primacy. Which is the real Mill? Is freedom primary or secondary for him? There is no general answer to this. But note what he says in On Liberty about cases in which freedom diminishes welfare. Suppose that a person is acting somehow that will cause him harm but will not affect any others. We argue with him, yet he persists. Mill says we must let him sink, though (since no one will benefit) the total welfare will be brought down by it. Here freedom is clearly primary; the question of welfare is set aside.6 Even where others are likely to 6 A Theory of Justice (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard, 1971), p. 92. Henceforth, un- less otherwise noted, parenthetical page references to Rawls will be to this book. 6 "As soon as any part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, . . . the question whether the general welfare will or will not be pro- moted by interfering with it becomes open to discussion. But there is no room for entertaining any such question where a person's conduct affects the interests of no persons besides himself" (198).</page><page sequence="4">TOWARD A LOGIC OF LIBERALISM 83 suffer, Mill on occasion dismisses the fact. No matter if people dis- like your off-beat religious (or sexual) practices, if the report of your doings causes them pain. Freedom comes first in such cases too. The dip in the general welfare due to people's disliking your conduct does not count against it. There are indeed also opposite cases, where a prospect of harm to others voids the claims of freedom. But Mill is not always reconciled even to these. He sometimes prefers to think that here it is one person's freedom impinging on others'. Perhaps this puts too narrow a construction on the concept of welfare. Chapter 3 of On Liberty is titled "Of Individuality, as One of the Elements of Well-Being." Two pages into the chapter, the same appears as "one of the principal ingredients of human happiness" (250). Clearly, for Mill, there is more to welfare than the absence of pain and discomfort. Recall his insistence in Utilitarianism on the importance of qualitative differences. What he there says about pleasures-that not only are some more intense than others, and of longer duration, etc., but some are of higher quality-does not go over smoothly into the language of utilities. Still, a translation may be possible, and perhaps, whatever the utility an autonomous life is assigned, it is always one of those of some higher sort.7 If so, giving freedom priority does not depart from welfarism. It is, of course, not clear how qualities are to figure in the summing process. Should the general welfare be some quality-weighted sum of utilities? How then are the weights to be set? All we can say for certain is that Mill weights personal freedom heavily, much as Rawls assigns primary status to rights and liberties, opportunities, powers, and the like. What counts for a liberal is the resources people have, their prospects of leading independent lives. Their welfare comes into it only if welfare is read very broadly. A just society provides the roads and the transportation on them, and it assures that everyone has a road map and the appropriate rations. Each person can then be left to travel whichever way he wants. This philosophy has a varied history, and mostly a partisan one. Throughout the nineteenth century, and well into the twentieth, it was primarily the philosophy of business. The distribution of rations was thought to be fair enough as it was. The problem was to keep the roads clear. Liberal- ism was laissez faire. In the 1960s, the idea found more radical platforms. The philo- 7 I propose a distinction of utility functions in "Beyond Utilitarianism," this JOURNAL, LXVIII, 20 (Oct. 21, 1971): 657-666, and suggest that some functions are superior to others. But a person can have only one current function, so either all his utilities are of the higher sort or none of them are. (Autonomy need not be in the upper reaches of any function here.)</page><page sequence="5">84 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY sophy of freedom was adopted by various disfavored groups. These were not content with the current disposition of resources. They demanded not just to be left to go their own way, but a greater degree of control over what mattered to them. The banners raised were those of black power, of women's liberation, of equality for gays. The liberal ideal of autonomy comes out clearly in each. Not only the disfavored found a voice. Ralph Nader spoke for consumers in demanding that goods be made safer. Students struck for a say in their colleges, and even professors asserted themselves. Much of it came to nothing, but the motive ideas remain. That every grievance should be heard, that every person must have some input, that welfare clients, mental patients, prison inmates should all have power-this would have been ridiculed not long ago. Now it has a place on every reform agenda. Mill's and Rawls's writings are thus tracts for our times. But only if we read them right, without the distortion of welfarist glasses. On the view that I take here, Mill's is a policy of maximizing the sum of everyone's resources, ant then letting each person do as he wishes with what he has. Rawls's is a policy of maximinning resources, and then again letting each person go his own way. Both Mill and Rawls propose a policy for the distribution of resources, and press for free- dom within the context of the distribution proposed. The Millian and Rawlsian formulas alone do not take us far, for the concept of resources still is unclear. The difficult questions re- main. Are the resources that Mill and Rawls stress the only resources there are? Do people differ in what are resources for them-must what are resources for me be resources for you? Are some sorts of resources better worth having than others? If so, what about trade- offs? Can we ever describe two people as equally endowed with resources when they have unequal amounts of different sorts of them? Unless a liberal finds answers here, his policy on distributions can't come to much. Making something of liberalism calls for a theory of people's resources. We need a general index of the resources each person has, an index allowing resources to be interpersonally compared. A prom- ising candidate appears in a recent book by James Coleman. In his The Mathematics of Collective Action,8 Coleman develops a theory of exchange in which the concept of a person's resources plays a central role. This theory has its weaknesses. Still, in default of another, I will build on Coleman's analysis. 8 Chicago: Aldine, 1973.</page><page sequence="6">TOWARD A LOGIC OF LIBERALISM 85 II Coleman begins with the concepts of interest and of control. People have different interests in different issues. No one is equally involved in every issue he sees. and different people have different interests in the same issues. People also have different degrees of control or influence over issues. The more control a person has over the issues that matter to him, the better off he is. Rational people therefore try to trade. They offer to yield control over issues that matter little to them in exchange for control over those which matter more. First, about the concept of a person's interests. Coleman confines his discussion to two-outcome issues, to contingency-sets of the form: h will happen, h will not. Also, to sets of issues that are logically inde- pendent of one another-no outcome of one implying either outcome of any of the rest-and also collectively comprehensive in some appropriate way. The issues in any single such set will be called the issues seen (later also: those in the market). A person often values the outcomes of some such issue differently. Let us suppose he assigns different utilities to these outcomes. The absolute value of the difference between the utilities he assigns, divided by the sum of the corresponding absolute differences for all the issues seen, is this person's interest in the issue. His interest in the issue is how much hinges on it for him. It measures how heavily he is invested in the issue, that is, how heavily invested proportionally.9 Now for a person's control. Let me say that a proposition o reports a free option for a person where o says that this person is doing (or not doing) something or other and where that person thinks he could make o true if he tried and has in no way bound himself to leave the question of his trying to others. Let a be one of the out- comes (either one) of some issue. A person has k control over this issue where some propositions o and o' report free options for him, the absolute value of the difference between the conditional prob- abilities of a on o and on o' is k, and he has no other pair of free options such that the absolute difference between the corresponding conditional probabilities is greater than k. Putting it in more usual terms: the control a person has over an issue is the influence he thinks he has on how that issue comes out. Coleman keeps to cases in which the sum of everyone's control over an issue is 1. An example will help. Suppose an election is being held in some club. There are two candidates running, and so two possible out- 9 We are assuming that each person cares about how at least one issue comes out. Also, that each issue seen holds at least some interest for some person.</page><page sequence="7">86 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY comes. One candidate is almost certain to win-let a be the outcome in which he does. Nothing some particular member might do would bring the probability of a below .98. Also, nothing he might do would raise its probability above .99. The difference is .01, and this measures his control in the case. We are speaking of subjective probabilities, or personal measures of likelihood-under-the-circumstances, or of what would be likely if the circumstances were somehow changed (e.g., if the club member were to do this or that). A person's control over an issue is determined by his own subjectivities. Let us assume, however, that there is full publicity of information and total uniformity of probabilities-that all involved believe the same and have the same probability func- tion. So a person's control over an issue is also the influence the others take him to have on it. The general theory is that people always pursue their interests. There are no gifts or free lunches. There are only exchanges: people yield control over issues in which they are little interested in order to gain control over others in which their interest is greater. Putting it more loosely, they secure a higher probability of having the de- cisive say where it matters in exchange for lowering the probability of being decisive where it doesn't. One important question is, who winds up with what? The analogy of the market is promising. Coleman suggests that alongside the market for goods there is a market for control over issues and that the thinking that applies in one area applies in the other too. As on the standard economic analysis, the distributioin of people's interests and of the resources they have establishes what degree of control each person gets over which issues. This brings us to the concept of a person's resources. We might consider defining this as the sum of his control over the issues seen. But we would then be ignoring the fact that not all control is worth the same. Coleman takes a person's resources to be the weighted sum of his control over these issues, the weights being the market values of having full control over them. Let cij be person j's control over issue i, and vi the market value of having full control over i. Then j's total resources rj are (1) rj= EiViCij The i-summation is over all the issues seen. We must still work out the concept of market value this uses. Coleman holds that people allocate their resources to getting (or keeping) control over issues in proportion to their weighted interest in them, the weights here being the reciprocals of the market values</page><page sequence="8">TOWARD A LOGIC OF LIBERALISM 87 of controlling these issues. Let xij be j's interest in issue i. The con- trol over i that j bids for, or his projected control c*ij over i, is (2) c i' = r 3 = x"j E;v,cXj vi V The usual market concepts now suggest themselves. The supply Si of control over i is indexed by the total value of the control over i-by the value-weighted sum of the control over it. Thus we have (3) Si = Fjvicij where the j-summation is over all the people involved. Since E jcij = 1, it follows that (4) Si = Vi The demand Di for control over i is indexed by the total value of the projected control over i. Thus, from (2), (5) Di = E vic*ij = F3jxij Eivicj The market value vi of control over i is defined on the supposition that the demand for control over i equals the supply of that control. Where Di = Si, (4) and (5) get us (6); and where De = Si,, Di,, = Sit,, etc., we have (7), (8), etc. (6) vi = E3jx,j rivic (7) vi, = i,... (8) vi,, = i ... Let Eivi = 1. Then given everyone's interests and his control over each issue, these last equations (6 et seq.) can be solved for unique market values. Let "initial" and "final" distinguish the situations before and after exchange, and suppose that each person knows the interests of all the people involved and their initial control over issues-or simply, that each of them knows the market value of each issue. The market values flesh out (2) for every i and j. This now tells us what each person j is bidding for. Since demand equals supply, all these bids will be picked up, so we also have the final distribution of control over each issue i. The control over issues that a person would bid for in full knowledge of the market situation is his final control over these issues. In a context of full knowledge, c*ij identifies j's final as well as his projected control over i. From (2) and the fact that Yixij = 1, we get (9) Eivic*ij = rj mixij = r</page><page sequence="9">88 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Notice now that c,j in (1) must refer to j's initial control, for (1) defines the resources with which a person enters exchange. Setting (9) next to (1), we can see that it makes no difference whether a person's resources are measured relative to his initial or his final control. The market redistribution leaves a person's resources what they were. There are, of course, gains from trade; otherwise why bother? A person is better off after a market exchange of control than before, for he is then better situated with regard to the issues that matter to him. He is more pleased with the control he has than he was with the control he had earlier. But he isn't any better endowed with resources than before. Let me briefly note a problem with the behavioral assumption made in equation 2. Why should we accept this? Why should we suppose that a person bids for control in proportion to his weighted interests-in proportion to the ratios of his interests in issues to their market values? Coleman himself is uneasy about it. Counter to what his theory requires, his intuitions are that, if a person is rational, he will try to gain as much control as he can over the issue in which his weighted interest is the greatest. This is not right either, as Coleman comes to note too. Often a person with partial control sees that what he has is sufficient to get him what he wants. Sometimes indeed he has no control, and still expects the outcome he favors, counting on others to bring it about. Rational people do not bid for more control here. Still the point remains: they don't always bid on the pattern of (2). How serious a problem is this? That depends on whether we think of people as always acting rationally, or as coming close, or as coming close most of the time. If we think people are rational, we can't be happy with Coleman's model. If we don't think so, the question then is whether people depart from rationality in the way that (2) says. Or whether (2) is at least a common approximation. Let us shelve our doubts and suppose that (2) fits well enough.'0 III There are several points at which Coleman's theory might be pressed further. We shall advance it two steps only. Look again at the concept of resources defined in equation 1. This does not connect with the views of the resource-maximizers or maximinners. Maxi- mizing resources is rendered vacuous. Given that, for every i, 10 I discuss some other problems in my "Some Notes on Exchange and Control," forthcoming in Erkenninis.</page><page sequence="10">TOWARD A LOGIC OF LIBERALISM 89 ,jc,j = 1, it follows from (1) that (10) jrj = Fj Fivicij = Fivi The sum of everyone's resources is the sum of all the values of issues, and this is set at 1, and so is constant. Whatever people's interests and whatever the distribution of control, the sum of every- one's resources is the same. So it does not matter who has what. A resource maximinner has more to say, but nothing interesting. Since the sum of resources is constant, the person with the least has the most he might have where all have the same. This does not provide for the fact that some inequalities are benign, that there are in- equalities that work to the advantage of the poorest. We can mend matters by refining some of our concepts. Let me say that j's market control over i is the proportion of everyone's (actual) control over i which is his. That is, the market control C7,j of j over i is ( cij cli =- ji Now we shall say that j's market resources are the weighted sum of his market control over the issues seen, the weights being the market values of having full market control over them. That is, j's market resources 7j are (12) = j = 7it j where Di is the market value of having full market control over i. If, throughout the above, we substitute Cij for cij, fj for r, and Di for vi, the theory we have is no longer what it was. It now says that what is bid for and what is supplied is always market control. The formalism remains the same, for we replace Coleman's assumption that, for every i, =jcij 1 with the logical truth that, for every i, Ejcij= 1; and we also set 3ij = 1 in place of Eivi = 1. This means that now Ei ?j is constant, not necessarily Ejrj. It may still be that, for some i, E jcij = 1. In all such cases, there is no difference between C?ij and cij. Where this holds for every i and we retain Eivi = 1, ii and r3 are also the same. This is the only kind of situa- tion that Coleman considers, so his analysis above is a special case of what we have here. Our new concepts now suggest a second departure. Where the sum of every person's control over an issue is less than 1, we ought often to look afield. Very few people have any control over the rate of inflation. Very few have any control over the crime rate, or over the unemployment rate or the balance of payments. But we know</page><page sequence="11">90 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY there is a large number of institutions and groups involved. There are businesses, banks, unions, political parties, and governments on the scene, and these have substantial control over such issues. We here apply our concept of control more widely than we did. But the control of a group can be read the same way as the control of people, in terms of the free options the group has. Groups also have interests in issues. These can be seen as set by the group's constitution or charter, or they can be taken as some function of the interests of its members, or of some subset of them. We see that groups relate to issues much as individual people do. On the analysis thus far, however, they don't affect market values. This makes little sense. The proper adjustment is simple: groups must be seen as functioning inside the market, as making their own control bids there. Let the variable j above range over all the agents involved, not only all the people but also all the groups. The formal- ism is unaffected, for none of the equations are changed. This is personification, or group anthropomorphism. I am sup- posing that groups act collectively, that they collectively think this or that, have subjective probabilities, and sometimes make com- mitments. I see no problem here. Economists speak of households as agents, as having interests and buying goods. Lawyers recognize corporate commitments and corporate responsibility for corporate action. It doesn't extend us much further to add that a company thinks it could raise its prices, and that, in its eyes, this would probably increase its profits. One final detail. We have both people and groups in the picture. We must now think of nature as a residual factor. Nature is outside the market. It has no interests whatever. The reason we must speak of it is that it does have control. Nature's control is that which is out of the reach of mankind as a whole-beyond the reach of any possible union of all agents. Imagine all agents grouped together for the purpose of controlling some issue, and organized as efficiently as is possible relative to this goal. (Imagine, for instance, a crash program to find a cure for cancer.) The control that mankind has over this issue is the control this organized group would have. The control that nature has over it is 1 minus the control of mankind. IV We can now get back to Mill's and Rawls's positions. Since the sum of all (actual) resources need no longer be constant, our initial ob- jections of triviality fall away. Once again, Mill holds that we must maximize the sum of all (actual) human resources. Rawls argues for maximizing the (actual) resources of the person (or people) with</page><page sequence="12">TOWARD A LOGIC OF LIBERALISM 9I the least of them.'1 They differ on the distribution of resources that they favor. They agree that, after a proper distribution, people should be allowed (by and large) to trade on the market as they please. These ideas can be extended. The leximin elaboration of Rawls is familiar. On this line, the first priority is to maximize the resources of the person worst-off (in resources). Suppose that, under the circumstances, we can't do any more for this person without making someone else poorer still. We must then proceed to augment the resources of the next worst-off-taking care not to force the worst-off down again. Where we can't do any more here, we move on to the third worst-off, etc. This is a policy of the furthest leveling of (actual) resources compatible with the maximization of those of the person with the least of them. (Several people might have equally little, so some touching up is called for.) We might consider the corresponding leximax elaboration of Mill. Notice that Mill sometimes puts his distribution policy negatively. In his essay, Nature, he sees the spontaneous course of things as mankind's principal adversary. The natural order must be con- tested: "the duty of man is to [be]... perpetually striving to amend the course of nature" (488). Mill's maximizing policy is equivalent to a policy of minimizing the sum of all resources not in human hands. Or rather, this is the first step to be taken. Where, under the circumstances, we can't go further in this direction, we must go on to diminish the resources of the person (or people) who is (or are) best-off-though not to a point at which the nonhuman sector picks up again. Where we have to stop with that, we move on to the next best-off, etc. The leximax policy makes for the furthest leveling of resources compatible with the minimization of those outside human hands. Mill would have rejected it. He was no egalitarian. The social leveling of his own time he viewed with much uneasiness, for he saw it as strengthening public opinion and so as enforcing convention. The example of Mill himself suggests that his basic policy might be drawn out differently. The leximax idea invites attention only because it starts out the very converse of the leximin.'2 These two policies remain open-ended. The leximax theorist must 11 Strictly, Rawls speaks not of the resources of individual people, but of those of representative members of certain social classes. This is a complication we can ignore. 12 Not by definition, but in fact; for the resources outside human hands in fact exceed those anyone has.</page><page sequence="13">92 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY consider how to distribute the resources taken from nature and from the people best-off. The leximin theorist must consider where he is to get the resources he wants to give to those at the bottom. The leximaxer might conclude that the available resources must, to begin with, be given to the worst-off, though only insofar as the sum of all human resources is kept at the maximum. The leximinner might hold that the resources he distributes must, be begin with, come from the top, though not if this leads to there being less to dis- tribute. So extended, leximax and leximin could well wind up much the same. The policies might also be set out more generally, in terms of agents rather than people. Or (more likely) they might be restated somehow that distinguished between people-agents and group- agents. We might want to insist that people take priority over groups, that the resources of groups or institutions, or of certain sorts of them, should be kept to the lowest minimum compatible with the maximization of the resources of all people. Mill himself held such a view concerning the institutions of government. He thought these should be kept as weak as our ability to act for our- selves allowed. We might also distinguish different kinds of issues. This would provide for more policies still."3 There are also ideological variants. Leximinners trade off equality against the maximization of the resources of the poorest. Leximaxers trade it off against the maximization of the sum of human resources. Other liberals take equality straight. The basic statement is R. H. Tawney's: "it is the mark of a civilized society to aim at eliminating such inequalities as have their source, not in individual differences, but in its own organization."14 T'hus also Ronald Dworkin: "re- sources and opportunities should be distributed, so far as possible, equally, so that roughly the same share of whatever is available is devoted to satisfying the ambitions of each."" Whatever his distribution policy, a liberal will try to keep the balance he worked out from being upset. One way is to require that, after the initial allocation is made, all transfers must go through 13 See, e.g., Hal R.

This distinction might also serve to extend Patrick Suppes' analysis in "Some Formal Models of Grading Principles," Synthese, XVI, 3/4 (December 1966): 284-306, which moves in a direction similar to Varian's. 14 Equality (London: Penguin, 1964), p. 57. 15 "Liberalism," in S.

This would rule out the inheritance of someone else's resources. On a person's death, all his resources that don't die with him would be redistributed. Indeed it rules out all private generosity. Or a liberal might wink at some circumvention of the market and expect to have things set right again in periodic redistributions. These would be unavoidable anyway. A person can't lose resources in a fair exchange. Whatever the transfer arrangements, however, resources rarely stay constant for long. Suppose I sell you my car. You give me some money for it-a kind of all-purpose token of control. I use the money to take a vacation. Next month, you still have the car; all I have is a suntan. Your resources are unchanged, but mine are less than they were. Suppose the distribution of re- sources was proper at the time of the sale. The new imbalance does not warrant a redistribution of them now. Compare this case with that in which a bolt of lightning destroys my car. There are all sorts of problems here. Against what sorts of losses should I be insured by society? And how long should society ignore the plight my pro- fligacy puts me in? How long should I be left to suffer for having squandered my resources? Also, not all interactions are transfer interactions. People know that it pays to work directly on the interests of others. A person with little resources can augment them by getting those with more to increase their interest in the issues he controls. Tom Sawyer was wise to this. He got his friends to feel that the fence he was obliged to paint was a very desirable painting-object. In the end, they were offering him all they could find in their pockets in order to get his permission to do the job for him. More often, it goes the opposite way: those with substantial resources augment them still further by increasing the interest of others with less in issues that they (the well-off) control. (Think here of advertising.) Suppose that the initial distribution was proper. How promptly should such im- balancings be redressed? Should any distinction be made between interest revisions prompted by those who stand to benefit and neutrally induced or self-induced (and possibly even altruistic) changes of interest?'- There are plenty of loose ends. A distribution policy alone can't handle all problems of justice. Or better, there is more to a theory of justice than a policy for arranging initial allocations. Mill's and 16 The questions here and in the preceding paragraph bear on a larger problem: when and where must distributive justice undo the effects of freedom? The un- avoidability of some undoing does not itself condemn liberalism; per contra, see Robert Nozick's discussion of his Wilt Chamberlain case in Anarchy, State, and Utopia (New York: Basic Books, 1974), pp. 160-164.</page><page sequence="15">94 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Rawls's full theories certainly go much further, both on the subject of distribution and on exchange. Mill holds that certain control trades must be prohibited. Certain agents are not responsible, and can't be permitted to trade for themselves. None of these people (children, the retarded, the insane) are market agents. Control over certain issues is not to be traded at all, or only under supervision- these, again, are off the market. No one may sell himself into slavery. Also, no one ever knows about an issue in the distant future what his interest in it will be when it finally comes. So there ought to be checks on the exchange of control over such issues now. Contracts in perpetuity (Mill sees marriage as a form of this) must be watched with particular care and must always be cancelable. In the market itself, Mill admits certain excise taxes (control-transfer taxes), and these diminish the freedom of exchange and so too affect who winds up with what. There is also the familiar "simple principle" of On Liberty: "that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or col- lectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection" (197).17 This can be read as imposing a constraint on initial distributions of resources and also on exchanges. No agent (individual or group) is to get control over any issue of what some other person is to do unless that person's exercise of his control over this issue is likely to harm someone else. This may conflict with resource maximization, so it does not fully square with what we ascribe to Mill above. Rawls's discussion likewise takes in more than we set out for him. There is his own "first principle": "each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others" (60). Note the adjective 'basic' here. Rawls dis- tinguishes basic liberties-the freedom of speech, the right to vote, liberty of conscience and the like-from the usual economic liberties. He has his first principle (concerning basics) take precedence over his second (the maximin rule). Losses of basic liberties can never be made up by nonbasic gains. We don't draw Rawls's distinction and so can't follow him here.'8 We view things more broadly than Rawls does throughout. A fundamental distinction for Rawls is that between social and natural primary goods-between rights and powers and liberties (both basic and economic) on the one hand, and health and talents, good looks 17 See also the first quoted sentence in fn 6 above. 18 The liberal position on rights is considered in my "Welfare, Rights and Fairness," in D. H. Mellor, ed., Science, Belief and Behaviour: Essays in Honour of R. B. Braithwaite (New York: Cambridge, 1980), pp. 203-217.</page><page sequence="16">TOWARD A LOGIC OF LIBERALISM 95 and the like on the other. Rawls's theory is worked out in terms of social goods only. The principles above take a higher ground; they speak of resources in general. They look to every sort of advantage and disadvantage, the natural kind as well as the social. (Handi- capped people get compensation, and possibly also the dull-witted and the homely.) A final point of difference. Our resources-based analysis violates Rawls's strictures against assessing situations in the light of people's utilities in them. Resources are defined above in terms of market values, market values in terms of interests, and interests in terms of utilities. I see no way of avoiding this dependence on things as they are. But no harm here: a liberal's concern with utilities does not make him a closet welfarist. The liberal rejects the welfarist's view that the general utility is all that matters. He insists on the primacy of autonomy, and this stand he takes is not belied by his noting people's utilities in working it out. v Enough about the theory. How will a liberal's actual programs differ from a welfarist's? How will a liberal and a welfarist differ in their politics ? A liberal looks to resources, and specifically to resource disparities. He inclines toward social programs that give the people now ill- endowed more control. So, for instance, Coleman in his Power and the Structure of Society."9 Here Coleman studies the disparities be- tween institutions and the people that deal with them, and goes on to discuss some means of rectifying the imbalances he sees. He speaks of consumers' agencies that would provide market informa- tion and so allow people to have more control over what they buy. He speaks of school funds in the form of vouchers channeled directly to parents, allowing parents to shop around for schools and so increasing their control over their children's education. He con- siders the possibility of a clearinghouse of data on universities that would let students select a university as carefully as universities now select students. In all these cases, the control that is gained by the people in- volved is lost by the groups that they deal with. Where consumers have more control over whether they buy what they want to buy, businesses have less control over whether they sell what they want to sell. Where parents gain control over their children's education, schools lose control over this. There are also redistributions that are less openly adversarial: a negative income tax, for instance. Also, 19 New York: Norton, 1974.</page><page sequence="17">96 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the provision of more services without charge, as in socialized medi- cine. (These last are also inter-individual redistributions.) Welfarists often press for programs like this too, so there is no difference here between liberals and welfarists. Welfarists put the case for their programs in very different terms. Or they simply assume that the more resources a person has, the better off he will be. In a sense, this always is true. But there is another sense in which it sometimes is false, and where it is, the two ways part. We spoke above about gains from trade. The more control a person has over the issues that matter to him, the better his position to affect their outcomes. The more resources he has, the greater will be his control over these issues after the trading is done. So, in this sense, the more resources the better. But what is the point of having control? People don't want just more of an impact. They also want prospects of doing well. The two don't always go together. A person's gains from trade may be hollow; the market shakedown may leave him on the losing side of every issue. How a person fares on an issue depends on what the others want and on how much control they have. (We noted this earlier in speaking of equation 2.) If other people who want what he wants have sufficient resources, he will make out well, however small his own. If his resources are large, but many others stand against him, he will make out badly. Here it is not always true that the better endowed a person is, the better off he will be. A person's prospects reflect the amount of the resources of the people on his side. T'hey are likewise better the greater the group resources behind him. In a group with any resources, those who belong to the majority expect to do better than those who don't. Even where there is unanimity, each person will make out better than if everyone acted on his own. It is this prospect of general benefit that leads to a joint-interest group's being formed. Here we come to a further point. People will often cut their resources to set up a group of this sort. They often see that though their own control over some issues is small, the same is true of others who favor the same outcomes of them. If they all joined together, each would give up his freedom of action and lose what control he had. But the control of the group as a whole might be large, and this could be used in the direction of the outcomes its members want. In joining, these people would give up resources, but each would wind up with better prospects. So, for instance, workers with little control over their wages and hours may form a union. Henceforth, they have no control, but the union does have control, and each worker expects to do better than when his resources were greater.</page><page sequence="18">TOWARD A LOGIC OF LIBERALISM 97 A union is a public good for all its members. Where such a good can't be provided unless many members pay for it, people are often willing to pay, provided that the others pay too. When the collection is made, each person's resources go down a bit, and the group's re- sources go up. Suppose that a proper distribution (on leximax or leximin or whatever criterion) already holds. The transfer of re- sources from the members to the group must now unsettle this. Suppose also there is no chance of the menmbers recouping their losses later and so improving their circumstances at that later time. (This rules out the unions case, but still covers many others; think of the funding of a sanitation department, or of air-pollution con- trol.) There is no liberal rationale for resource transfers here. The only case that can be made is welfarist: if an arrangement will benefit all, a move in its direction is right, whatever the effect on the resource distribution. By and large, people accept this. They are willing to live with taxes, with regulations and restraints, if these improve the conditions of living for everyone all around. Those who value communal assets may indeed shrug off the taxes. Critics of Rawls have argued that the primary goods he mentions are suited to certain life styles only, that it isn't true that people always prefer more to less of these goods-and this now whatever the others have and lhowever they stand on the issues.20 Tlle point applies to liberal- ism in general. A person's resources may be useless to him where the objectives he has are communal. More important, the private holding of certain resources may block the way to such objectives. Liberals stand for autonomy, and autonomy and community don't always mix. Here the political issue is joined. The moral perspectives differ. Welfarists and liberals see things from opposite sides. Welfarists think in terms of the amount of good that might be done. On their view, who does the good is irrelevant; where there is a general benefit, it doesn't matter whose efforts provide it. Liberals are not indifferent to welfare, but they insist that autonomy comes first, that each person must be encouraged to advance his own interests. Welfarists see liberals as divisive. Liberals think the welfarists' faith in other-directedness naive. Welfarists warn of the loss of public spirit. Liberals deny there is such a thing and complain of cant.2' 20 For instance, see Adina Schwartz, "Moral Neutrality and Primary Goods," Ethics, LXXXIII, 4 (July 1973): 294-307; and Michael Teitelman, "The Limits of Individualism," this JOURNAL, LXIX, 18 (Oct. 5, 1972): 545-556. 21 For a recent dialogue, see the essays in W. Gaylin et al., Doing Good: The Limits of Benevolence (New York: Pantheon, 1978), especialiy those of David Rothman and Ira Glasser.</page><page sequence="19">98 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY In one form or another, this confrontation has held for some time. Our fundamental political document comes directly out of it. The Founding Fathers were caught up in the problem: they wound up adding a liberal Bill of Rights to their welfarist Constitution. This was an act of statesmanship, a commitment to both sides at once. There is no way of harmonizing conflicting ideologies. But there are ways of living in tension between them.
