<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hypermedia, Eternal Life, and the Impermanence Agent Noah Wardrip-Fruin Abstract We look to media as memory, and a place to memorialize, when we have lost. Hypermedia pio- neers such as Ted Nelson and Vannevar Bush envisioned the ultimate media within the ultimate archive-with each element in continual flux, and with constant new addition. Dynamism without loss. Instead we have the Web, where "Not Found" is a daily message. Projects such as the Internet Archive and Afterlife dream of fixing this uncomfortable impermanence. Marketeers promise that agents (indentured information servants that may be the humans of About.com or the software of "Ask Jeeves") will make the Web comfortable through filtering-hiding the impermanence and overwhelming profluence that the Web's dynamism produces. The Impermanence Agent-a programmatic, esthetic, and critical project created by the author, Brion Moss, a.c. chapman, and Duane Whitehurst- operates differently. It begins as a storytelling agent, telling stories of impermanence, stories of preservation, memorial stories. It monitors each user's Web browsing, and starts customizing its storytelling by weaving in images and texts that the user has pulled from the Web. In time, the original stories are lost. New stories, collaboratively created, have taken their place. he story of hypermedia, in which the Web is a recent chapter, begins with a vision of transforming the brain's associative connec- tions into media-media that can be infinitely duplicated and easi- ly shared-creating pathways of thought in a form that will not fade with memory. In recent years, hypermedia has begun to per- meate our lives. But it is not as we dreamed: constantly growing, with nothing lost, only showing what we wish to see. Instead we find "Not Found" a nearly daily message. The story of software agents begins with the idea of a "soft robot" capable of carrying out tasks toward a goal, while request- ing and receiving advice in human terms. In recent years, a much narrower marketing fantasy of the agent has emerged-with a rela- tionship to actual agent technologies as tenuous as Robbie the Robot's relationship to factory robots-and it grows despite fail- ures such as Microsoft Bob. Now we often see agents as anthropo- morphized, self-customizing virtual servants designed for a single task: to be a pleasing interface to a world of information that does not please us. The Web disappoints us with its too-perfect reflection of our ambivalent relationships with impermanence and openness: dynamic and unstable, diverse and overwhelming.

The Impermanence Agent is a different response. The Impermanence Agent, developed over the last year, interacts with users as a Web browser window. The Agent is a sto- ryteller, telling a personal story, a story of impermanence. The Agent is meant to be experienced peripherally, over time-not "visited." It tracks the user's Web brows- ing, makes copies of the texts and images the user views, and then customizes its sto- ry by incorporating this material into it. The Agent customizes until none of its original story is left. A Box of Letters 1. Ikkyu, the Zen master, was very clever even as a boy. His teacher had a precious teacup, a rare antique. Ikkyu happened to break this cup and was very perplexed. Hearing the footsteps of his teacher, he held the pieces of the cup behind him. When the master appeared, Ikkyu asked, "Why do people have to die?" "This is natural," explained the older man. "Everything has to die and has just so long to live." Ikkyu, producing the shattered cup, added, "It was time for your cup to die" [1]. .. infinite reproducibility ... lossless archiving .... continual versioning Whatever we may say about digital cul- ture, it is always time for something to die. 2. When I was nine months old, still in a walker, on a day that I do not remember, my mother was sitting in our living room. From where she sat she could see down our hallway, past the front door, to the place where the hallway turned in the direction of my bedroom. From the bedroom came a crashing sound. But perhaps this was not so unusu- al, and it did not sound to her mother's ear as if I was hurt, so she waited. In time, I came clumsily down the hallway, drag- ging a small overnight suitcase. That hall- way I do remember, with white plaster walls and a brass chime that the doorbell made ring (and a closet with stairs beneath it that led to a basement that may only exist in my imagination). I made my way to the front door, put my small hand on the knob, turned to look at my mother and waved (I couldn't speak): Bye-bye. Bye-bye. My mother tells me that she cried. 3. There is a loss of memory. I was proba- bly trying to visit Nana, my mother's mother. By the time of my first self-aware, narrative memories, Nana was already los- ing many of hers. I have only hints of what she was like from my own experience, a sense of her difference, and memories of moments in the kitchen when she named my puppet monkey Minkey and made chocolate milkshakes. I remember going to visit her in the nursing home, where she was once she could no longer walk. On this visit she thought I was her son Wally, or so I imag- ine. She told me how she couldn't wait to get out of there and be back on her feet again. We took her to the house for Christmas. She looked at one of her great-grandsons, too young to be walk- ing, and said, "He's coming and I'm going. But I can't get a seat." That sum- mer she got a seat. 4. After she died we were left with a box of her letters. Not letters she had written, but letters that belonged to her. These seemed like poor materials for reconstitut- ing a woman-but they, the paper trail, seemed to be all that was left. At the same time, she seemed more alive after her death than in years. While she was alive, but after she was no longer herself, we had continued to leave her to carry the burden of being her. Once she was dead we took it upon ourselves. At the memorial service we treated each other with the care that she had given. The paper trail is no dodge for imper- manence. But here I sit, inscribing Nana's existence again, attempting another addi- tion to the collective box of letters. Eternal Life 5. Mark Bernstein wrote about Web shrines for HypertextNow, pointing to memorial inscriptions on the Web "by sons and daughters, by grieving parents, by aca- demic institutions, by an army medic who cannot forget the ravaged body of a child whose name she never learned" [2]. He suggests that those of us who think about media should approach Web shrines with profound humility-in recognition of suf- fering, and in recognition of the fact that none of us predicted, none of us directed, and none of us profited from this emer- gence in the docuverse. Now many links in Bernstein's article are broken. Yahoo! has sprouted the category Society_and_Cul- ture/Death/Obituaries/Memorials. Bernstein later added a link to an article from The New York Times on the Web, which tells the story of "a not-for-profit group named Afterlife, dedicated to pre- serving the Web sites of deceased surfers" [3]. Afterlife (www.afterlife.org) consists of "a few volunteers who have been slowly gathering information on the legal, finan- cial, and technical issues of maintaining thousands or maybe hundreds of thousands of Web sites for all 'eternity.'" At a site called "Dearly Departed" I find the simple sentence, "We miss you Gama" and decide to include it in my essay about Nana. 6. The Internet Archive Project (www.archive.org) is more famous than Afterlife, and has more hubris in its aims [4], but I believe its impetus is the same [5]. We find in the Internet that which expresses and creates, reflects and shapes, our complicated relationship with imper- manence. The paper trail is changing, we are changing it, and with it we are chang- ing our contact with immutability. There is a loss of memory, not only in broken links and missing sites and in that which becomes outdated-but also in that which is updated, and those threads of newsgroup and e-mail conversations with starting 354 Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Hypermedia, Eternal Life, and the Impermanence Agent</page><page sequence="3">Fig.1. The images and texts of The Impermanence Agent's story incorporate, and are eventually replaced by, materials from the user's Web browsing. points lost and with potentially infinite bifurcations. At the same time, a growing amount of our culture takes a form that allows identical, degradation-proof, multi- ply viewable copies. Consider the dream of hypermedia, put forth by Ted Nelson and others over the last three decades: In a not-so-distant future, we will read and write (view and draw, hear and compose) almost everything from and to a world-spanning computer network. Everyone will have the ability to produce his or her own documents and connect them with any other public docu- ments. The author may constantly create new versions of her or his own document, and individuals may create their own ver- sions of any public document; public con- nections made between one version of one document and another version of another will usually automatically place themselves in all the extant versions. Historical back- track and degradation-proof storage will allow us to visit any version, any moment in the network's history [6]. To have the ultimate archive, and yet have each element of this archive constantly in process. Dynamism without loss. Impermanence enfolded within permanence. Afterlife, the Internet Archive, and the dream of hypermedia aren't about embalm- ing; they're about eternal life. Remember the analogy between text and water. Water flows freely, ice does not. The free-flowing live documents on the network are subject to constant new use and linkage, and those new links continually become interactively available. Any detached copy someone keeps is frozen and dead, lacking access to the new linkage (and, if there were any substantial body of in- links at the time the copy was made, probably most of those as well). -Ted Nelson [7]. 7. Even the origins of hypermedia contain traces of the quest for eternal life. In 1945, Vannevar Bush published "As We May Think"-an article now widely considered the genesis of hypermedia [8]. In it Bush writes of the memex, a "future device for individual use ... a sort of mechanized pri- vate file and library" in the shape of a desk. The memex, as described, uses methods such as microfilm storage, dry photogra- phy, and analog computing to give postwar scholars access to a huge, indexed reposito- Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Hypermedia, Eternal Life, and the Impermanence Agent 355</page><page sequence="4">=-Ei Netscape: Impermanence rlypurrFMeuid rlds begun to permeate our lives.

The field of information retrieval has been inspired by Bush's vision of simple, elegant information access. Hypertext and hypermedia, however, have been inspired by Bush's description of the scholar creat- ing links and pathways through this infor- mation-associative connections that attempt to partially reflect the "intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain." The trails envisioned freely inter- connect all the contents of the memex, which include both public documents and personal notes, diagrams, and photographs. Bush describes a great thinker's disciples as inheriting not simply that person's "addi- tions to the world's record," but also the connections, the structure, the tools by which that work was created. In this vision, we are not only immor- talized by our additions to the paper trail (which are stored identically in innumer- able memexes), but can preserve and pass on our very pathways of thought. These pathways will not break or fade. Those who follow us can keep these connections in use, expanding and updating them, tending to our virtual immortality in both word and connection. The volunteers of Afterlife may be seen, perhaps, as the progeny of this vision, half a century later. The Internet and the Agent 8. Like grains of rice on a chessboard, Internet traffic doubles and redoubles with- in a single year [9], 404 Not Founds notwithstanding, 503 Forbiddens notwith- standing, broken images notwithstanding. It seems we can live without eternal life. Or can we? Byte writes, "HTML isn't dead, but it is suffering from its own suc- cess-and every time you get a '404 URL not found' error message, you're suffering, too" [10]. Did Byte write this to remind us, lest we forget suffering in our embrace of an impermanent Web? In this formulation, is it the loss that is our suffering-or the mes- sage, the reminder, the error? Is HTML, the stuff of our new paper trail, itself a life, suffering, perhaps to die-while we shovel rice in overtime, doubling an already-mas- 356 Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Hypermedia, Eternal Life, and the Impermanence Agent I I._.. 111B, .w1 1| -- -I-- - |1 -- | ----- s s w [ ^ Ls ffi ffi | .N E ; i .7ue;g _ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. s . ..- nn..- - 1- . . .. . .... .. .................... --- - - 1-""'"'" 1?11?... po -1- ?.? ..?I</page><page sequence="5">sive body every few months? What can we do, except get rid of the message, the offending 404? We can't stop back-end filtration-we can't stop imper- manence in the system [11]. Byte itself is now a thing of memory. We may write "Web Pages Must Live Forever" [12] but we must also know that they cannot. 9. The idea of an agent originated with John McCarthy in the mid-1950s, and the term was coined by Oliver G. Self- ridge a few years later, when they were both at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They had in view a system that, when given a goal, could carry out the details of the appropriate com- puter operations and could ask for and receive advice, offered in human terms, when it was stuck. An agent would be a "soft robot" living and doing its business within the comput- er's world. -Alan Kay [13] The concept of a soft robot, or agent, is very broad-as is the concept of a mechan- ical robot. But each, in contact with our pervasive fantasies of human servitude, has spawned very narrow, anthropomorphic visions in entertainment and marketing. From a muddling of these visions with ongoing agent research, the image has arisen of a perfect information servant-an agent with a singular task: to be a pleasing interface to a world of information that doesn't please us. Despite the disaster of Microsoft Bob [14], this image has contin- ued to gain momentum. Now the Web, in its too-perfect reflection of our ambivalent relationships with impermanence and openness, is found displeasing by many. It is wonderfully dynamic, but unstable. Its openness is exciting, but we complain of information overload and find ourselves embroiled in censorship battles. We suffer, apparently, with each 404. There is contin- ual talk of the Web being undigestible, uninteresting, uncomfortable, and difficult to understand. Yet we do not wish to aban- don it, for all our talk of its faults. Across the Web, many are attempting to sell fantasy images of an agent/servant as the key to mapping cyberspace into a com- fortable coherence. Sometimes a fantasy agent image is used to market a much less sophisticated agent. Sometimes the fantasy of the agent is used to market something that isn't an agent at all. Signs of these fan- tasies can be read in the language that About.com uses to sell the servitude of its human guides ("They do all the digging so you don't have to") [15], but it is in selling software, at sites such as "Ask Jeeves," that the phenomenon becomes most blatant: [Y]ou probably view the Internet as being somewhat shaggy, wild, even downright uncivilized. (Jeeves thinks it no mere coincidence that we call it the "Net," implying that we can get tangled up in this "Web" of informa- tion. Think about it.) Well Jeeves is here to tame the Net for you. He loathes disorder and lives to serve. He wishes only to make your expe- rience of the Net more civilized.... In short, Jeeves is delighted to be your personal guide through this expansive-sometimes too-expan- sive-resource. A butler for as far back as he cares to remember, Jeeves now lives to serve you and you alone. He's friendly, smart, periodically witty, and at your service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. He never requests time off for holidays, and has yet to call in sick. Type a question for Jeeves just the way you'd phrase it if you were asking a particularly knowledgeable friend. Dutiful butler that he is, Jeeves will immediately and intrepidly begin navi- gating through hundreds of millions of web sites to find just the answers you need, and deliver the results quickly and thoroughly to your screen. Jeeves does not accept gratuities [16]. 10. During the last year, I have been work- ing with a.c. chapman and Brion Moss to create The Impermanence Agent (Fig. 1; www.cat.nyu.edu/agent). Like the fantasy agents, which are expected to give advice rather than receive it, The Impermanence Agent tells stories before listening to them. The Impermanence Agent doesn't sepa- rate good information from bad, but com- bines family history with other fictions to tell stories of impermanence. They are Nana's stories, and mine, and each user's. They are the user's not simply as audi- ence, but also because The Impermanence Agent monitors each user's Web traffic and employs the information it gathers in its storytelling to that user (Fig. 2). It is a per- sonal agent, a customizing agent, an illu- sion of an agent. The Impermanence Agent itself appears as a Netscape window. It is a combina- tion of server and client-side applica- tions written in PERL and JavaScript, making liberal use of existing software such as WordNet (www.cogsci.prince- ton.edu/-wn/) and ImageMagick (www. wizards.dupont.com/cristy/), and bene- fiting much from the willingness of Duane Whitehurst to modify some exist- ing code and to create some new. The Impermanence Agent is our addition to the box of letters. We have created the stories with which it begins, stories like Nana's, stories like this one. We have creat- ed the means by which it selects texts and images from the user's browsing and com- bines them with its own, customizing the story. We have set in motion the imperma- nence in which these pieces drawn from the user's Web browsing eventually entirely replace the stories we have created. And, because we can't help ourselves, we have also preserved the original stories, to be told from the beginning to each new user. All of this will work until the next version of Netscape replaces the current one. Per- haps even longer. And it will last longer than it works, like the boxes of disks we each have, formatted for filesystems not read by any current operating system. Like the pictures of people four generations back that none of us ever met. The Impermanence Agent is art meant to be experienced peripherally, to be left open on the desktop for a week. In its stories, children are born, letters are burned, we are duplicated and saved and lost. The texts and images of our daily browsing are incor- porated into these stories, then wear them away, then become something new within the space that held them. Then the story has been told.

Bob, Microsoft's attempt at an agent-guided house-shaped "social interface," was a critical and commercial failure. Reviews indicate that users did not want to lose control of their work with the computer through the time consuming cartoon mediation of the dog, turtle, rat, elephant, or any of the other animal-shaped agents provided by Microsoft. They preferred even the rather clumsy GUI of Windows 3.1. Shortly after Bob's attempt to hide the information world of the computer behind an animated suburban facade was rejected, Microsoft experienced great success in selling the comparatively direct-manipulation-oriented (and MacOS derived) Windows95. 15.
