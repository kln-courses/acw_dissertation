<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EMBLEMATIC ASPECT OF VONDEL'S TRAGEDIES AS THE KEY TO THEIR INTERPRETATION Since Mario Praz wrote his interesting Studies in Seventeenth-Century Imagery we know how important emblems and emblem-books were in the period of the Renaissance. Dr Praz states: In need as he was of certainties of the senses, the seventeenth-century man did not stop at the purely fantastic cherishing of the image: he wanted to externalize it, to transpose it into a hieroglyph, an emblem. He took delight in driving home the word by the addition of a plastic representation (I, 12). However true this may be, the reverse is equally true. Dr Praz' 'seventeenth- century man' not only wanted to externalize a poetic or didactic image he had formed in his mind, but also was continually on the look-out for a hidden meaning in the mbst commonplace objects and events of everyday life. I am under the impression that this was especially the case in Holland. For it was in Holland- w here emblem-books have been most popular and most frequent-that the emblem (without losing all connexion with its original background of ancient mythology, hieroglyphs and devices) soon developed in a rather independent way. By borrow- ing its motifs from everyday life, it acquired a more realistic character. We see, for instance, a mouse in a trap. The trap is open, but the mouse does not dare to make use of its opportunity, for outside a cat is quietly waiting for just this to happen. The mouse symbolizes the young man who has lost his freedom by falling in love, but does not dare free himself from his bonds, because he knows that life without love would be a far greater evil than he is experiencing now.l Or we see a weather- cock on a church-steeple: a symbol of the lover who has to take his cue from the whims of his beloved; but a symbol also of the sensible man who resigns himself to circumstances without trying to oppose the blows of fate; and a symbol lastly of the Christian who cannot be at rest before his will points in the same direction as the will of God.2 Of course there is an element of playful conceit in all this, but the deeper foundation is one of earnestness. To the emblematist all things and all situations are potential bearers of a useful meaning. I think we even may go a step further and say that to him they are bearers of a hidden meaning, put in them by God, available to everyone, but noticed only by those who are willing to see and to learn. There would be much to say about the background of this conception. A Dutch scholar, Mr Zijderveld, rightly suggested that neo-platonic influences are to be presumed, strengthened by the allegorical tradition of the Middle Ages.3 But it would take us too far to deal with this problem now. Suffice it to say that in the seventeenth century, and perhaps especially in the Netherlands, there was a general tendency to think in emblems and to interpret everyday life in an emblematic way. Vondel participated in this trend. In his youth he wrote the poems for two emblem- books, and in his later work he still showed a predilection for symbolical interpreta- tion and for allegorical images. 1 Emblem by Daniel Heinsius (1580-1655). 2 Emblem by Jacob Cats (1577-1660). 3 Keur tit het werk van Dr A. Zijderveld (1953), p. 122.</page><page sequence="2">W. A. P. SMIT 555 There is a second and not less important fact. In the ninth chapter of his Poetics Aristotle points out the characteristic difference between history and poetry. The historian, he states, restricts himself to studying particular facts and incidental events, but the poet aims at grasping the universal and eternal aspect of things. The Renaissance eagerly worked out the implications of this view. The incidental case, derived from history by a poet to be used as subject-matter for an epic or a tragedy, had to be transformed by him into the illustration of a universal truth, even at the cost of historical--i.e. merely incidental-truth. What really mattered was the idea! Jean Chapelain, one of the founders of French classicism, makes clear what is meant, when he writes: 'Solis les accidents d'Ulysse et de Polypheme, je vois ce qui est raisonnable qu'il arrive en general h tous ceux qui feront les memes actions.... Je ne considere pas plus Enee pieux et Achille en colere... que la piete avec sa suite et la colere avec ses effets pour m'en faire pleinement connaitre la nature. 1 Vondel, friend and disciple as he was of Grotius and Vossius, on the whole was of the same opinion; in all his tragedies it is always the universal aspect of the story he tries to grasp and to make clear to his audience. It is easy to see that, interpreted in this way, the Aristotelian rule must increase his tendency to what we have already called thinking in emblems. For there is no essential dif- ference. From the point of view of Chapelain history and myth become a huge emblem-book, each particular event or story being (as Mario Praz would say) a 'mute emblem' waiting for the poet who will put into words its hidden universal meaning. We merely have to leave out the actual picture to see the similitude. And in the case of a tragedy even this is not necessary. For on the stage the emblem becomes a picture indeed, a living one, moving and talking, thus combining in the most happy way the two complementary parts of the actual emblem, image and word. Considering it from this angle, we may even say that a play on the stage is the most ideal emblem imaginable. And so it is not surprising that Vondel, starting from the famous sentence of Simonides, 'ut pictura poesis', sees his plays as talking pictures, in which the situation, visible on the stage, is explained and interpreted by the various monologues and dialogues and by the reflexions of the chorus. It is obvious that in such a play there is no place for dynamic action or for detailed psychology. Too much action would make impossible the ample discussions and disputes necessary to make clear the various attitudes towards the central problem, to point out their general aspects and to judge them according to the universal law of God. Too much psychology would divert attention from the story as a whole to focus it on the individual characters, which in Vondel's opinion is justifiable only when and as far as such a close-up contributes to a better understanding of the main idea. There is a third and last circumstance predisposing Vondel to become an emble- matic tragedian. Though later he joined the Roman Catholic Church, originally he was a Mennonite, and the Mennonite way of thinking had a great influence on the moulding of his personality. Even in his Roman Catholic period much that remains from that past may be pointed out; for, as he states himself in one of his poems, 'a cask always retains the smell of its first fluid'.2 Now, it i' characteristic 1 Quoted by Ren6 Bray, Laformation de la doctrine classique en France (Paris, 1927 and 1951), p. 213. 2 "T vat hout nae 't eerste sap doch altijd zijnen reucke' (De Werken van Vondel (Amsterdam, 1927-37), I, 375).</page><page sequence="3">556 Emblematic Aspect of Vondel's Tragedies of the Mennonites that they attached great value to searching the Old Testament for parallels with the New and for prototypes of Christ. Though in itself such search- ing was anything but new, it resulted in the Mennonites becoming more versed in the recognizing and handling of Biblical parallels than any other Protestant com- munity in the Netherlands; and it is obvious that Vondel was influenced by it in his way of thinking. It is not by accident that the two plays he wrote in his youth both work out such a parallel. Het Pascha (The Passover) deals with the deliverance of the Israelites from Pharaoh by Moses. But as Moses is a prototype of Christ, the whole story of this deliverance has to be understood as a forecast of the Redemp- tion, Pharaoh being a symbol of Satan and the Israelites of the believers in Christ. Much in the same way in his Hierusalem Verwoest (The Destruction of Jerusalem) Vondel sees the ruin of city and temple as a symbol of the coming day of judgment, when God will destroy his enemies after having separated his sheep from the goats. As a Mennonite, Vondel was accustomed to read his Bible, and especially the Old Testament, as a kind of Holy Emblem-book. The fashion of emblems, the Aristotelian rule of universality, the Mennonite interest in prototypes and parallels, all three tended in the same direction. No wonder that the emblematic aspect became such an important factor in the tragedies of Vondel. Of course, it is not the only one, and in the process of Vondel's develop- ment as a dramatic author there are periods in which it is not even preponderant, though it is never completely absent and must therefore always be taken into account. In this paper, however, I will restrict myself to his most emblematic period, that between 1640 and 1660. Prepared by his frequent discussions on these matters with his friend Vossius, it was in Sophocles' Elektra that Vondel found the model for his emblematic tragedies. In 1639 he published a translation of this play, and it is very interesting to see how in his dedication (which is at the same time his foreword) he stresses an emblematic interpretation. In his opinion the basic idea is, and I quote his own words, 'that the postponed punishment of God at last righteously overtakes rogues and criminals; which truth must be considered to be the salt of, and a vital condition for, all religion'.l Therefore he reads the tragedy as an illustration, an emblem, of the truth mentioned. The characters of Elektra and of her sister Chrysothemis serve to demonstrate the various attitudes one can assume towards the divine law. Elektra, the central figure of the emblem, impersonates the right attitude; knowing herself to be in accord with the ordinances of the gods, she is inflexible and prepared to accept all the consequences of her conviction. Chrysothemis on the other hand personifies the temporizing and hence objectionable attitude; though not without sympathy with her sister, she disapproves of her stubbornness and tries to persuade her to resign herself to circumstances in order to avoid fatal issues. The Chorus like- wise insists upon moderation and caution. But Elektra does not yield to either of them; when she is led to believe that her brother Orestes, the longed-for avenger-to- be of her murdered father, perished in an accident, she is even willing to take over his task of inflicting the death-penalty on her mother who had killed her husband Agamemnon to be free to live with her lover. Interpreted in this way, Elektra 1 '...dat Gods uitgestelde straf endelijck schelmen en booswichten rechtvaerdighlijck achterhaelt; welck leerstuck het zout, en een van de zenuwen der godvruchtigheid streckt' (ibid. m, 642).</page><page sequence="4">W. A. P. SMIT 557 indeed can be considered as an emblem-tragedy, and it was as such that Vondel made it his model for the original plays he wrote immediately after his translation. Most convincing in this respect is his tragedy Gebroeders (The Brethren), pub- lished in 1640. It deals with the story of the seven sons and grandsons of Saul, who by order of God are handed over by King David to the Gibeonites, to whom Saul had done a great wrong. And the Gibeonites 'hanged them in the hill before the Lord: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest'. We find the story in chapter 21 of the Second Book of Samuel. In the foreword which Vondel wrote for his play, he made it clear that he saw in it an obvious parallel with what in his opinion was the basic motif of Elektra. Here, he said, is pointed out, 'how king Saul and his descendants... are punished according to the will of heaven, without their crime being extenuated or expunged by the expiration of time '.1 And it was apparently his aim to make his principal character, King David, a chris- tianized, or perhaps it is more correct here to say a Biblical, counterpart of Elektra, impersonating as effectively as she did the acceptance of the law of God. To achieve this, however, he had to add a very important detail to the actual Bible-story. In the Book of Samuel no hesitation on the part of David is mentioned; he obeys immediately and apparently without any qualms. But not so in the tragedy of Vondel. There David first has to fight out a very hard inward struggle. In his eyes the order of God is a grave injustice which he cannot bring himself to commit. For why should the sons, and even the grandsons, of Saul be held responsible for a crime they had not committed themselves; why should they bear the punishment of their long-deceased ancestor? Moreover he is deeply moved by the despair and the tears of the unlucky mothers beseeching him to save their sons. And lastly he thinks it bad policy to give his enemies an opportunity to accuse him of wiping out the last survivors of a rival dynasty. Vondel stresses these human feelings and considera- tions to the utmost, so that no shadow of doubt is left: from a human point of view the handing over of the seven princes to the Gibeonites, who will put them to death, is not only wrong, but even mean. No wonder that David delays the execution. Again and again he consults the high priest, who in the play is the mouthpiece of God. The high priest however has but one answer: it is the will of God, and God must be obeyed implicitly, even if we do not understand his designs. 'For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.' God cannot be wrong, and what he requires cannot be unjust. At last David resigns himself; reluctantly he hands over the Brethren to their executioners. The right attitude towards God has prevailed in him over the merely human; like Elektra he stands in the centre of the play as an example of inflexible loyalty to the divine law. But at the same time, as will have already been noticed, there is a difference between them, and even an essential one. Elektra does not know a moment of pity and rejoices in the ultimate punishment of the guilty, whereas David's acquiescence in the will of God is a surrender of all his own convic- tions and his own wishes. Moreover, in Elektra the real delinquents have to suffer for their sins, whereas in Gebroeders the penalty does not strike the sinner himself, but his descendants. As I understand it, these two points must be seen as inherent in Vondel's christianizing of the Elektra-motif. David is a prototype of Christ and as such has to embody the great principles of Christianity, notably charity; hence his 1 '... hoe Koning Saul en de zynen... van den hemel gestraft zijn, zonder dat het verloop der jaeren de misdaed verschoonde, of uitwischte' (Ibid. in, 799).</page><page sequence="5">Emblematic Aspect of Vondel's Tragedie.s hesitation and his pity. And the punishment of apparently innocent victims in the Bible-story affords Vondel the opportunity of stressing the main point in which Christianity differs from paganism: it requires a blind faith in God, an unshakable assuredness that his ways, however incomprehensible they may seen, always are the right ones. There have been many scholarly discussions about this tragedy by Vondel, and many conflicting interpretations have been suggested. I for one feel convilcedl that only by starting from the emblematic structure of Gebroeders, in the \wax I sketched, is it possible to get to the pith of Vondel's real meaning. But if w ( dto so, all details and all seemingly unnecessary expatiations find their logical explanation. Paying attention to the emblematic foundation of Vondel's tragedies leads us to another discovery. There appears to be a very distinct continuity in the basic problems of the successive plays, even to the extent that by confining ourselves to the study of one single tragedy, thus isolating it from its natural surroundings, we run a real risk of coming to partly erroneous conclusions. Let us once again take Gebroeders as an example. Though we did not in fact isolate it, but discussed it in close connexion with Sophocles' Elektra, we are not yet in a position to decide with any certainty which of the motifs we found must be considered the really funda- mental one. Have we to stress the similarity with Elektra? In that case the basic idea might be 'that the postponed punishment of God at last righteously overtakes rogues and criminals'. Or, on the contrary, have we to stress the differences between the two plays? Then the Christian elements mightt prove to be essential: the hesita- tion and the pity of David, the blind faith that God is always right. To force a decision on the evidence of this play and its Greek mlodel only would mean making a rather arbitrary choice between two possibilities. But if we take into account Vondel's previous plays and the problems with which they deal, no reason for uncertainty is left. It is obvious that what Vondel wanted to stress most was the necessity of a blind faith in the guidance of God. I will try to make this clear. While studying the works of the Roman and Greek classics, Vondel became acquainted w'ith their conception of Fate as a supreme and irresistible power, playing blindly and senselessly witli the life and lot of man, ruling even over the gods of Olympus. Of course such a conception is absolutely inconsistent w ith the Christian faith. And it is typical of Vondel as a Christian that he immediately tackled the problem and did not leave it until in his opinion he had definitely settled it. In play after play he indirectly denies the existence of Fate by emphasiz- ing that it is God, supreme Wisdom as well as supreme Love, who rules the world, and that therefore there must be sense in all that he ordains or allows to happen. However senseless and cruel may seem the slaying of the innocent children of Bethlehem by Herod,1 or the massacre of Ursula and her eleven thousand virgins by Attila near Cologne,2 against all appearances a Christian has to believe that from the point of view of God there was sense in it, because otherwise it would not have happened. It is obvious in Gebroeders how much David's obedience to God, notwithstanding his utter bewilderment, gains in importance against the back- ground of this most fundamental problem. The seeming senselessness of God's 1 One of the motifs in Vondel's tragedy Gysbreght van Aemstel (1637). 2 The oprincipal motif in Vondol's tragedy Maeghden (The Virgins), 1639. 558</page><page sequence="6">W. A. P. SMIT 559 requirement, far from being but an interesting accessory circumstance, proves to be the heart of the matter. Immediately after Gebroeders Vondel wrote his tragedy of Joseph in Dothan (1640), dealing with the story of Joseph being sold by his brothers to a caravan of Ishmaelite merchantmen. In view of his campaign against Fate that story must have been for him a veritable godsend-and I take the last word in its most literal sense ! For here God himself grants us, as it were, a glimpse behind the scenes of his providence. He allows us to understand why it was that Joseph had to suffer from his brothers and to be sold as a slave: namely to become viceroy of Egypt and as such to save the greater part of mankind from death by famine. What happens in the fields of Dothan is a tragedy-but only in the eyes of shortsighted men. In reality it is the justification of faith in the love and wisdom of God. And so Vondel surrounds the tragic earthly scenes of his play with the heavenly presence of a Chorus of Guardian-angels who never tire of pointing out jubilantly God's ultimate designs for Joseph. The quintessence of their songs is to be found in these lines: Yes, Father, show to mankind now How Thou makest use even of the wicked In behalf of the earthly race, When Thou gatherest violets from among thorns And by Thy wisdom bringest to power The chosen of Thy heart !1 And with that Vondel dismisses the problem of Fate once and for all. However often in his later tragedies the situation may give occasion to put it forward again, he never actually does so. For him, after the evidence of the guidance of God implied in the story of Joseph, the problem has ceased to exist. But another problem instantly presents itself. It arises out of the sequel to Joseph in Dothan: the tragedy of Joseph in Egypt (1640), dealing with the story of Joseph and the wife of his master Potiphar. It goes without saying that in the con- stancy of Joseph Vondel sees an emblem of chastity. But in developing this emblem, on the one hand he has to lay stress on the religious background of Joseph as the origin of his firmness, on the other on the pagan ideas of Potiphar's wife as the principal cause of her licentiousness. The result is an antithesis between true faith and paganism of so fundamental a character that it practically amounts to the dualism of Good and Evil. And Vondel is so deeply moved by this dualism, that for nearly twenty years it will remain the basic motif of all his tragedies. He deals with it, however, in a typically Vondelian way. Believing with all his heart in the supremacy of God over Satan and therefore in the ultimate victory of Good, he is not interested in the metaphysical aspects of the problem. What fascinates him is its practical consequence for man. God granted a free will to man, and that invests the latter with a tremendous responsibility. For it means that in the great struggle between Good and Evil nobody can escape the necessity of making a decisive choice. Whoever does not take sides with God or still hesitates to do so, sides already with Satan, for there is no intermediate way; tertium non datur! It is ~~~~1 ~Ja Vader, laet de menschen ruicken, Hoe ghy de quaden kunt gebruieken, Ten goede van hot aertsch geslacht; Als ghy violen onder doornen Gaet plucken, en uwe uitverkooren Door uw beleit zet in hun kracht. (De Werken van Vondel, Iv, 82.)</page><page sequence="7">560 Emblematic Aspect of Vondel's Tragedies this conviction which induces Vondel to stress in play after play the paramount importance of the choice to be made, and to emphasize the fundamental difference between the godly and the satanic way of life. Thus, in one of his tragedies' he opposes the apostles St Peter and St Paul to the emperor Nero, in another2 the Roman Catholic Mary Stuart to the heretical representatives of Queen Elizabeth in the castle of Fotheringhay. But neither his choice nor his interpretation of historical facts matters so much as does his intention to view them in the light of the idea of universal dualism, as emblems of a fundamental truth. It is against this background that we have to consider Vondel's most famous tragedy, the Lucifer of 1654. Lucifer has been pointed out as one of the possible sources of Milton's Paradise Lost. It is not my intention to deal with this problem here. Let me state merely that I am much less sure of the probability of Vondel's influence on Milton's epic than I was before I read Professor Watson Kirkconnell's book on the theme of Paradise Lost in world literature, published in 1952 under the title The Celestial Cycle. The themes of the Creation of the world, the War in heaven, the Temptation and Fall of Man, and finally the Redemption by the atoning sacrifice of Christ appear to have been so well known and so widely spread throughout Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that obviously Milton had no special need of Vondel's tragedy to gather the data for his epic. Moreover, I cannot find any convincing similarities in the details of the two poems, whereas the differences leap to the eye. Many more resemblances with Paradise Lost are to be found in another tragedy by Vondel: Adam in Ballingschap (Adam in Exile), of 1664. But this last play, even in its title, has been influenced by Grotius' Latin tragedy of Adamus Exul (1601), which means that the similarities between Vondel and Milton might be explained by Grotius being a common source. In several respects the interpretation of Lucifer involves complicated problems. Among the most difficult is the one concerning the real nature of the principal character, Lucifer himself. It seems obvious to expect that he should prove to be the archetype of the rebel, first author and principal instigator of the mutiny in heaven. But there are passages in the tragedy which explicitly seem to contradict such a conception. If Lucifer is an arch-rebel, why then should he be frightened when he discovers that already a third of the angels have taken his part and are expecting soon to be led by him against the army of God ? Why then should he be so utterly desperate in his long hesitation, when at the very last moment, just before the beginning of the battle, the archangel Raphael, in the name of God, offers him peace and pardon and beseeches him to renounce his wicked designs ? In view of this, we are inclined to wonder whether the Lucifer of Vondel, far from being an inflexible and proud representative of Evil such as Milton evokes in his epic, may have been merely the unlucky victim of circumstances and...of himself. That, however, immediately confronts us with another question. Is it possible that this really should have been Vondel's intention? Is it conceivable that the hesitations of Lucifer should be part of the poet's conception of the arch-enemy of God? And if so, why? In order to find an answer to these questions, we have to start by going back to the play Vondel wrote immediately before Lucifer, namely the tragedy of Salomon (1648), dealing with a story recorded in the eleventh chapter of the First Book of Kings. In his old age, we are told, Solomon had his heart turned away by his many 1 Peter en Pauwels (1641). 2 Maria Stuart (1646).</page><page sequence="8">W. A. P. SMIT 561 heathen wives after other gods, and even built them a temple 'in the mount that is before Jerusalem'. God punished him for his infidelity by announcing that after his death the greater part of his kingdom would be rent from his son and given to a servant. Thus the First Book of Kings. But just as in the case of Gebroeders, Vondel added much to these Biblical facts, in order to stress the emblematic value of the story. We here find again the dualism of Good and Evil which we have already discussed, for it is against this universal background that he wants us to see and to understand the moral downfall of Solomon. So, in the Jerusalem which he puts before our eyes on the stage, there are two parties: on the one hand the party of God, of the high priest and the doctors, on the other hand the party of Satan, of the heathen princesses and the opportunist courtiers. And in the spiritual struggle between these two powers the soul of Solomon is at stake. Whereas his young and beautiful favourite wife Princess Sidonia, instigated by a heathen priest, does her utmost to persuade him to join her in an offering of incense to Astarte, the goddess of voluptuousness, the party of true faith beseeches him to remain true to God and to abstain from a sin which might call down the divine vengeance upon him and upon his people. In the course of the play we see Solomon being tossed to and fro between his fear of God and his love of Sidonia, hesitating, incapable of coming to a final decision. But there is more to it than that. Of course, fundamentally Solomon is already standing on the wrong side. By yielding to his wives in the building of a pagan temple, he has already gravely sinned against God. Therefore it is easily understood that in the Bible no gradation of sin is mentioned and Solomon is punished at once for his unfaithfulness in its entirety. But not so with Vondel. His tragedy required a distinctive culminating point on which the inward struggle of the king could be concentrated. That is why in the play God grants a certain margin to Solomon. Though by building an altar to idols the latter has already committed a sin, God is willing to overlook it, provided the king does not go any farther on his way of disloyalty. As yet nothing irremediable has occurred; if Solomon repents and reforms, all will be forgiven and forgotten. However, every margin has its limits; and in this case the limit consists in the offering to Astarte. There lies the decisive test; if Solomon manages to resist the pleadings of Sidonia, all will be well; if not, all will be lost. In this way Vondel's tragedy indeed becomes an emblematic illustration of the universal truth, that in the struggle between Good and Evil the soul of man is at stake, but that God grants him a margin and the freedom of decisive choice. In the case of Solomon his sensual love of Sidonia finally proves to be stronger than his spiritual love-and even than his fear-of God. Which again implies an emblematic lesson: take example by him and beware of voluptuousness which might draw you away from God as it did him. Taking into account the continuity in the basic ideas of Vondel's plays, I believe that in Lucifer the situation has to be interpreted in much the same way as in Salomon. In the very first verses of his masterpiece Vondel points to the existence of jealousy and discontent among the angels. Lucifer belongs to the malcontents, but without yet being their leader. So in heaven we recognize the same two parties we already know from Solomon's Jerusalem: the party of Good, this time consisting of the faithful angels, led by Michael and Gabriel, and the party of Evil, originally led by Belzebub and his satellites. But Belzebub realizes that his party is in need of a much more brilliant chief to gain adherents and to secure a chance of withstand- ing the power of God; therefore he incessantly tries to win over Lucifer, who as 36 M.L.R. LII</page><page sequence="9">562 Emblematic Aspect of Vondel's Tragedies lieutenant of God is the greatest prince in heaven. Thus, in this first stage of the great struggle between Good and Evil, it is Lucifer himself who is at stake. Like Solomon in the former play, he too has already sinned against God; he has indulged in feelings of jealousy; in his indignation he has insulted God and even given instruc- tion to incite the angels to sedition. But he too is granted a margin. As yet nothing done by him is deemed irremediable by his divine Sovereign; if he repents and reforms, all will be forgiven. The faithful angels never cease to point this out to him. On their part the rebels try to force his hand by appealing to his pride, by compro- mising him, by placing him in a situation which he cannot back out of without losing face. And Lucifer, owing to his pride and to his jealousy, is too weak to oppose them; step by step he lets himself be carried away. At a certain moment he even acquiesces, though reluctantly, in being consecrated by the rebelling angels as their god. It seems to overstep all limits and he himself does not doubt that this is the case; after the consecration his only thought is to gather his army as quickly as possible. Still, he is mistaken; the mercy and the patience of God are far greater than he is able to grasp. Not the consecration, but the beginning of the actual battle is the point where God has drawn the line. This makes it possible that even at the very last moment, when both armies are standing facing each other ready for battle, Lucifer gets yet another chance of reconciling himself with God: Raphael offers him an olive-branch, symbol of peace. It is almost accepted-almost Lucifer submits- but after a terrible inward struggle it is yet his pride which finally wins. He cannot find it in his heart to plead guilty, to humiliate himself before God, to lose face in front of the rebelling angels who are relying on him. As in the former tragedy Solo- mon's sensual love of Sidonia proved to be stronger than his fear of God, so now Lucifer's pride is stronger. Refusing the olive-branch Raphael is offering him, he chooses battle. But he does so with despair in his heart, fully realizing his ultimate defeat and his inevitable doom. So our first impression after all appears to have been right. Whereas the Satan of Milton is a gigantic Titan, a god-a god of Evil it is true, but nevertheless a god- the Lucifer of Vondel is neither gigantic nor god-like. We may even call him a weakling, carried away as he is by circumstances, doing what he never meant to do, ruled by his pride against his own better judgment. Instead of being a god of Evil, he is merely a victim of Evil, like Solomon. The heavenly lieutenant does not differ fundamentally from the earthly king. This implies that he is much more anthropomorphic, much more human, than the Satan of Milton. And it is obvious that in a play by Vondel he could hardly be otherwise. For only by being very much akin to man could Lucifer be an emblematic figure, and the tragedy of his fall have an emblematic value for man. As it is, the lesson is evident: take example by Lucifer and beware of pride which might draw you away from God as it did him. I have already suggested that this interpretation is not the orthodox one. In a text-book of Dutch literature it will be looked for in vain. But I feel convinced that only by taking into account the emblematic aspect, and by making full use of the striking parallelism between the tragedies of Lucifer and of Solomon, may we hope to attain to an interpretation of Vondel's masterpiece which is in accordance with the data of the play as well as with the poet's general way of thinking. That is why I am bold enough, for the time being, to remain unorthodox with regard to Lucifer. UTRECHT W. A. P. SMIT</page></plain_text>
