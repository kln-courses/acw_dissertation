<plain_text><page sequence="1">ART OF NOISE: Beckett's Language in a Culture of Information Laura Salisbury Using Beckett's notes on Maxwell's Demon from the "Whoroscope" Note book alongside his psychology notes on the relationship between 'figure' and 'ground' in the perception of meaning, this article suggests that in the 1930s and 40s Beckett began to use language in a way that troubles the distinction between what can technically be described as signal and noise, intended and unintended information. It argues that Beckett's desire to hear and feel the noise of language is not part of an evocation of entropic decline towards heat death, but forms part of an understanding of the literary text as bearing signs of life. But what was this pursuit of meaning, in this indifference to meaning? And to what did it tend? Beckett, Watt. In 1851 and with beautiful bad temper, Arthur Schopenhauer wrote a philosophical plea for the quiet life. "Noise is a torture to intellectual people" (90), he declaimed; its interruption "paralyzes the brain, rends the thread of reflection, and murders thought" (92). A murderer of intellection and assassin of art, for Schopenhauer the thrumming vitality of the world necessarily existed in an embattled relationship with the very possibility of idea, thought, and order. Schopenhauer's influence is, of course, strongly to be felt in the work of Samuel Beckett's early and mid-period; however, it is clear that Beckett's sense of the relationship between noise, intellection and art becomes far less binary, less clearly combative, than the philosopher poet's. For where Schopenhauer sought a retreat into that silence of thought from which new ideas might be born, it seems that Beckett's texts remain explicitly and diversely concerned with hearing and feeling the noise, so to speak. The strangely artificial sound effect of the sea in Embers (written 1957), the incessant shuffling and scraping of bodies on the dusty plain</page><page sequence="2">356 Laura Salisbury of Quad (1981), or the hissing static of those various forms of analogue recording technology with which Beckett remained keen to experiment are obvious examples. But even Beckett's novels, most commonly intoned in the quiet of a whispered interior voice, evoke an interference that disarticulates the idea of language as a clear reflection of a pristine world of ideas where meaning noiselessly resides. Watt (completed in 1948) is indeed explicitly fascinated with the static of language, with including and incorporating the multiplicity of sliding signifiers that would usually be excluded from speech and writing to allow a more or less stable meaning to sifted from the ground of other linguistic possibilities or sonic vibrations. In Watt, the medium begins to interfere with the message, as message is usually conceived, although, as we shall see, the resistant materiality of the medium becomes part of the message at another level. For Beckett, there remains a compulsive desire to "hear the feet" of his media, to allow noisy interference to find a place in the texts that is more than peripheral - more than that which should be winnowed out as waste. And this article suggests that Beckett's persistent attention to noise as an anxiously creative condition of thought, language and the production of order, rather than its obverse, points towards a historically specific reconfiguration of the understanding of how meaning might emerge, not as a transcendence of noise, but within and alongside it. In 1934-35 Samuel Beckett was busily sorting information. As a young artist struggling with limited success to form his experience into significant work, Beckett took a vivid interest in the psychology and physiology of how meaning might emerge from a potentially assaulting spray of phenomena and impressions. Beckett's summaries of sections of R. S. Woodworth's Contemporary Schools of Psychology alight precisely and insistently on the Gestalt School of psychology of Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang Kohler, and their theorisations of the relationship between meaningful 'figures' and the 'ground' from which discernible and differentiated sights, sounds, sensations and experiences emerge. Gestalt psychology, which was much in vogue in the early to mid 1930s, offered a materialist account of the functioning of both brain and mind, but it pitted itself against the idea of a purely mechanized brain function found in associationist psychologies and neurology. For Gestalt psychology argued that both brain and mind worked as wholes, orientated towards the perception of meaningful order, or organized Gestalts, in the world and within human experience. The mind was neither built from separate units of sensation or</page><page sequence="3">Art of Noise 357 stimulation, nor from the firing of particular punctate areas of the cortex subsequently translated into mental activity; rather, the human being was latently orientated towards the perception of pattern and order. As Beckett records from Woodworth, because the organism acts as a whole "we do not have to learn to see a compact blotch as a unit, because the primary brain response to the area of homogeneous stimulation is a dynamic system and not an aggregation of separately active points" (1934-5, 12; qtd. in Feldman, 313). Beckett indeed notes that Gestalt psychology had demonstrated empirically that "Nature runs to organized wholes. The solar system is a physical Gestalt - indivisible. So is a wheel or a soap bubble. So is the animal or human organism - not a mere sum of organs, its behaviour that of total activity - not a mere sum of reflexes" (1934-5,11; qtd. in Feldman, 312). Woodworth explains that "a pattern of dots has a shape or design which is not to be found in the dots"; and Beckett alights on the fact that "In musical language, you can transpose a tune from one key to another, so changing all the notes or 'elements,' but not changing the tune" (Woodworth, 102). In such a process, then, it is the pattern or relationship between elements rather than the elements themselves that signifies. Accordingly, Beckett notes: The figure stands out naturally from the ground in virtue of the fundamental distinction between them. A baby does not see [William] James's "big blooming buzzing confusion," but singles out a face or other compact visual unity, cp. noise figure against noise background, movement on skin against general mass of cutaneous sensation. (1934-5, 12; qtd. in Feldman, 312) If one accepts Woodworth's assertion that the tendency for a meaningful figure to emerge organically from ground or background noise is not peculiar to the sense of sight (115), it is possible to draw the implication that patterns of language, like melodies or arrangements of shapes, might also become 'meaningful' according to the ways in which a closed figure of linguistic sense "stands out [...] against the background of less distinct noises" (115). Beckett indeed notes that the "natural tendency of brain dynamics is to close up gaps": "The seeing of figures is inherent in perceptive activity [...] The organic unity of optical sensorium and motor sensorium" (1934-5, 12; qtd. in Feldman,</page><page sequence="4">358 Laura Salisbury 313). In such a schema, then, both figure and ground signify in ways that allow the emergence of something that is essentially meaningful. Of course, to note something down is not necessarily to believe it, and as a number of critics have indicated, when the Woodworth notes explicitly migrate into Murphy, they are subject to parody as figure and ground persistently fail to emerge "naturally" from one another.1 In Watt's observation of the painting in Erskine's room, the relationship between the broken circle and the dot equally does not appear as one of clearly perceptible figures; rather, figure and ground shade into one another: "Watt wondered how long it would be before the point and circle entered together upon the same plane. Or had they not done so already, or almost? And was it not rather the circle that was in the background, and the point that was in the foreground?" (Beckett 1976, 127). Clearly, no immanent Gestaltist pattern yields itself up as meaningful here. In Molloy (1947), Moran also speaks of the disorganisation of experience from perceptible Gestalts into noise: "The blood drains from my head, the noise of things bursting, merging, avoiding one another, assails me on all sides, my eyes search in vain for two things alike, each pinpoint of the skin screams a different message, I drown in the spray of phenomena" (111). In Malone Dies (1947-48), too, figure does not automatically stand out against background noise; instead, Malone admits that for a long time now I have been hearing things confusedly [...] the noises of the world, so various in themselves and which I used to be so clever at distinguishing from one another, had been dinning at me for so long, always the same old noises, as gradually to have merged into a single noise, so that all I heard was one vast continuous buzzing. The volume of sound perceived remained no doubt the same, I had simply lost the faculty of decomposing it. The noises of nature, of mankind and even my own, were all jumbled together in one and the same unbridled gibberish. Enough. I would willingly attribute part of my shall I say my misfortunes to this disordered sense were I not unfortunately rather inclined to look upon it as a blessing. Misfortunes, blessings, I have no time to pick my words, I am in a hurry to be done. And yet no, I am in no hurry. (207)</page><page sequence="5">Art of Noise 359 What is internal, what is external, what noise is human, and what is inhuman - all is "jumbled together", "merged into a single noise" that cannot be decomposed into what might technically be referred to, using the language of information theory, as 'signal' (intended information) and 'noise' (interference or unintended information). Significantly, though, this disorganisation of perception is explicitly translated into a disturbance of the figure/ground function within language. Malone has "no time to pick [his] words" [ital. mine], to sift and sort them into signal and noise, because all is disintegrating into "one vast continuous buzzing." In the Addenda to Watt, a footnote similarly suggests that words have resisted being sorted into clearly meaningful configurations; but here the difficulty in sorting figure from ground is represented, like Malone's careless "hurry," as due to a lack of work on the part of the narrator: "The following precious and illuminating material should be carefully studied. Only fatigue and disgust prevented its incorporation" (1976, 247). Presented as abjected, expelled material whose importance to the 'main' text is paradoxically both affirmed and refused by its marked peripheral status, the Addenda seems to ruin the defined contours of the novel that it supplements. The Addenda does not fall "naturally" into the background, for the narrator determines that it "should" be studied and thus reincorporated, at least in a reader's mind; but nor does it easily achieve the status of a closed figure - it is not simply part of the novel form. Of course, it could have been incorporated by the narrator, and may yet be incorporated in various ways by the critical activity of the reader (as a supplement, for example) (see Caselli, 89-92); but the creation of an ordered whole out of Watt requires an input of work that is ironically spat out as excessive by the narrator, and perhaps also experienced as such by the reader. In the face of the Gestaltist belief that the perception of wholes is linked to an immanent ordering of the human organism and the phenomenal world, Beckett renders visible the work required for meaningful orders to be forged. By drawing attention to the sheer fatiguing work involved in sifting figure from ground, Beckett might be seen, albeit obliquely, to be placing his writing within the climate of nineteenth-century physics. In 1847 Hermann von Helmholtz articulated the first law of thermodynamics which determined that "the quantity of force which can be brought into action in the whole of Nature is unchangeable, and can be neither increased nor diminished" (98). At almost the same</page><page sequence="6">360 Laura Salisbury moment, however, Rudolf Clausius identified the second law: the irreversible decline of available energy within a closed system because of the action of entropy. As Anson Rabinbach explains, this law asserts that "in any isolated system the transfer of energy from a warmer to a colder body is accompanied by the decrease in total available energy" (3), implying that all systems tend naturally to move towards a disordered state and that force within a closed system inevitably dissipates. As James Clerk Maxwell's famous passage in the 1872 Theory of Heat determines: One of the best established facts in thermodynamics is that it is impossible in a system enclosed in an envelope which permits neither change of volume nor passage of heat, and in which both the temperature and the pressure are everywhere the same, to produce any inequality of temperature or pressure without the expenditure of work. (308) In other words, in a closed system entropy increases to the maximum, as fast, hot molecules, and cold, slow ones, gradually settle into a homogeneous mixture denuded of local concentrations of order. The inevitability of this process and its irreversibility (unless work is put into the system, which would mean that it is no longer closed) is often described as marking the arrow or direction of time. As Malone intuits, then, the disordered state of "one vast continuous buzzing" may be closer to the end of things than to the beginning and so have its "blessings." Maxwell, however, went on to postulate a famous thought experiment that offered an evasion of the second law of thermodynamics, and which precisely concerns the ways in which order might appear without an input of work: "But if we conceive a being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in course, such a being, whose attributes are still as essentially finite as our own, would be able to do what is at present impossible to us" (308). Maxwell's demon could divide the fast moving molecules of air from the slow ones, thus allowing order to increase in the system. This demon, who holds out the hope of order and reversing the arrow of time marked by entropic decline, seems to have fascinated Beckett. In 1936, Beckett took notes from Poincare's 1902 La Valeur de la science, transcribing a section from chapter 8, "The Present Crisis in Physics." There, Poincare offers an account of the second law of</page><page sequence="7">Art of Noise 361 thermodynamics and the irreversible action of entropy, but he also describes "Le demon imaginaire de Maxwell, qui peut trier les molecules une a une, saurait bien contraindre le monde a revenir en arriere" (Beckett 1936, 42; qtd. in Jones, 125).2 As we have seen in the fiction, though, Beckett seems more in tune with the second law of thermodynamics than with the "imaginary" demon who could reverse time by instituting an effortless order. He also carefully notes down from Poincare that in the natural world, "une goutte de vin tombe dans une verre d'eau etc... on aura beau agiter le vase, le vin et Peau paraitront plus pouvoir se separer. Un grain d'orge dans le tas de ble ... type du phenomene physique irreversible. (C.f. Gibbs: Principles of Statistical Mechanics)" (Beckett 1936, 42; qtd. in Jones, 125).3 Wine cannot be miraculously separated out from water like figure from ground: if it is to happen, or indeed to be perceived, work is needed. When "le demon de Maxwell" (Beckett 1984, 56) migrates from "Whoroscope" notebook into the dense and cryptic essay "Les deux besoins" (1938) as a being who might theoretically resolve the tension between the seeming subjectivity of the artist's need to need and the exteriority and putative objective existence of a need that is needed ("Besoin d'avoir besoin et besoin dont on a besoin" (Beckett 1984, 56)), it indeed becomes clear that simply seeing one need as primary and one as secondary - one as figure, one as ground - is something that distorts the dilemma ("on se garde bien d'y voir un primaire et un secondaire" (Beckett 1984, 55)). Of course, by the 1930s science had also suggested that the conditions required for Maxwell's demon to effect its workless work were only achievable in theoretical terms. In 1929 Leo Szilard demonstrated that a material demon would need some means of measuring speed, and the act of acquiring that information would require the expenditure of energy, constituting an input of work into the system. Leon Brillouin also determined that in a truly closed system the demon would be unable to see. By introducing a light source, the demon would be able to separate the molecules and decrease entropy in the system, but the light source "pours negative entropy into the system" (Brillouin, 164); in other words, as William Paulson puts it, entropy "may diminish locally, but the addition of a nonequilibrium source of radiation to the system implies that outside the vessel, entropy is increasing" (42). The vessel becomes an open sub-system of a larger closed system in which entropy is increasing.</page><page sequence="8">362 Laura Salisbury In the 1920s, cosmology determined a new configuration for this larger closed system. It discovered that the universe was in motion - that it was expanding and that the furthest objects observable were a fortiori the oldest. By imagining that the universe had once existed as a point of unimaginable density, cosmology saw all spatial and temporal existence as the legacy of a primary yet ongoing explosion and a movement towards heat death. Many different scientists thus found themselves asking, alongside the Gestaltists, why does figure emerge from ground, order from disorder (even if only intermittently), if the arrow of time, marked by entropic disorganisation, cannot be reversed; why, in Beckett's language, is there not simply "one vast continuous buzzing"? Why are there not just "blizzards" (139) or "cyclones" (113) of electrons, as Beckett put it in Dream of Fair to Middling Women? Why is there not simply a "continuity bitched to hell" (Beckett 1996, 139) but complex sets of interactions by which order and the possibility of meaning emerge, not from nothing, but alongside and from out of 'noise'? The question of how meaningful signals can be transmitted within a universe defined by increasing entropy was explicitly posed by the mathematical theory of information that emerged decisively in the 1940s with Claude Shannon's work at Bell Laboratories. Shannon's theory of information uses mathematics developed within the field of thermodynamics and probability to describe the relationship between intended information and noise in the channels of communication between a sender and receiver. Its goal is to discover how communication messages can be converted into electric signals most efficiently and how those signals can then be transmitted and received with minimum error. Whatever enters a message (signal) in transmission, altering it so that it does not arrive as sent, can be spoken of as noise in the channel. This noise is indeed randomly distributed, having no immanent relationship to the message it muddles. Shannon asserted that there would always be loss in the transmission of a message because of the action of entropy; consequently, the purpose of information theory was to analyse and reproduce the conditions under which such interference might be minimized. But what is clear in Shannon's understanding of the transmission of information is that for any energy to be transferred, a degree of temperature is required. At absolute zero molecular action does not cease, but there is insufficient energy to enable transference to other systems; at absolute zero, then, both the production or emergence of order and the degeneration into</page><page sequence="9">Art of Noise 363 disorder ceases. But absolute zero cannot be reached by either natural or artificial means precisely because it is impossible to decouple any system fully from the rest of the universe. As soon as there is heat, energy can be transferred between bodies; but once there is molecular action and energy transference occurs, the laws of thermodynamics demand that entropy will increase and noise will be produced. So as soon as there is sufficient heat for any signal to be transmitted at all, there is also noise that threatens its transmission. As Michel Serres has it, noise is not simply the interference which prohibits the transmission of any message; noise also signals the emergence of the conditions through which any islands of order or negentropy (message, signal, or even the order of living things) can appear within a system: "Background noise is the ground of our perception, absolutely uninterrupted, it is our perennial sustenance [...] No life without heat, no matter, neither; no warmth without air, no logos without noise, either [...] Noise is the background of information, the material of that form" (1995, 7). No life without noise, then, and no noise without life. To turn to information theory here is in no way to claim any direct influence of such work on Beckett (or Beckett's on it), although the concern with how meaning and ordered systems emerge against the inevitability of entropic disorganisation saturates the intellectual cultural discourse of the period in which Beckett thoroughly participates. But there is a way in which Beckett's persistent examination of the relationship between artwork and the production and transmission of meaning that compels and disturbs the artist can be seen to interact with the legacy of thermodynamics in information theory that offers some insights for how literary texts and those who read them might perceive of themselves as becoming, at least contingently and temporarily, meaningful. In 1988 William Paulson made a strong theoretical attempt to show how the language of literature might be read precisely in terms of its particular relationship to the complexity of noise. He suggests that literary language is, by its nature, extremely noisy (in a technical sense): it contains high degrees of ambiguity (hesitations, deviations, multiple significations) that abuse the notion that such language is simply a vehicle for transmitting a world of ideas that somehow preexists it. So where Shannon, for example, emphasises the importance of repetition or the production of spaces of 'redundancy' in a message in order to offset interference, in Beckett's language, restatement seems to add to the text in a way that produces and introduces opacity rather than clarifying the signal that it repeats.</page><page sequence="10">364 Laura Salisbury When, in Watt, Arsene speaks of normal eating habits - which are to be contrasted with the maid Mary's -, that which is seemingly ordinary and transparent is suddenly rendered ironically and noisily opaque: The ordinary person eats a meal, then rests from eating for a space, then eats again, then rests again, then eats again, then rests again, then eats again, then rests again, then eats again, then rests again, then eats again, then rests again, then eats again, then rests again, and, in this way, now eating, and now resting from eating, he deals with the difficult problem of hunger. (Beckett 1976,51) As a generation of poststructuralist critics have shown, Beckett's repetitions do not, in fact, clarify a message by repeating it exactly; instead, they are infested with minimal differences that work to displace and defer what might be thought of as any singular meaning (see Connor). In the language of information theory, repetition of the same adds redundancy to the message that helps to combat noise; but repetition with difference decreases the amount of uncertainty removed by the message, therefore diminishing the amount of technical information passed. The ambiguity and repetition with difference in which Beckett's modernism delights, then, increase the noise in the channel of transmission, working to roughen up the conditions of the message and decreasing the likelihood that it will be received in precisely the form in which it was sent. As information theory itself has begun to see, however, the entropic disorganisation of a message in one system can also open up meaning in another; repetition with difference which produces noise can indeed offer up other kinds of eddies of order, organisation and signification, adding new and unpredictable signal to a message and thus increasing the amount of information transmitted. As noise and signal always emerge coterminously - noise being defined in relation to the signal with which it interferes -, noise is only random and chaotic in relation to one particular message that it muddles. Paulson argues that the problem an information theory of noise raises for communication in language, and that literary texts render particularly explicit, is that "we have no sure way of distinguishing between message and noise, since the notion of noise contained in the text requires the postulation of a message existing prior to its being conveyed in language, and it is impossible in general to guarantee the</page><page sequence="11">Art of Noise 365 existence of such as a message" (88). Paulson insists, however, that if we allow further complexity into the system it becomes clear that the idea that one could decide within linguistic communication what is signal and what is noise (perhaps through some interpretative "metachannel" (89) free from noise) ignores the fact that neither literary texts nor readers function as closed systems. They are not nineteenth-century machines that are always and everywhere running down, filled with less and less pockets of order; instead, both readers and texts should more properly to be thought of as organisms. To say that they are organisms engaged in a process of autopoiesis - self creation or self-sustaining activity - is to suggest that they are open systems capable of maintaining their own self-organisation in the face of the perturbing forces of the environment. They take the world into themselves, reworking it in terms that nourish their own immanent organisational systems.5 For a reader who is an open system encountering a similarly open literary text, then, the 'noisy' elements of excessive redundancy, overabundant repetition, and the seemingly aleatory become meaningful because s/he is able to "consider the elements hitherto unencountered as part of a new level of signifying structure" (Paulson, 89). As systems that are more like organisms than machines, both literary texts and the readers who encounter them are capable of maintaining their self-organisation and increasing their complexity through their connections with other systems and their work. So where noise is the undertaker of invention for the nineteenth-century Schopenhauer, for twentieth-century systems theorists like Gregory Bateson and Niklas Luhmann, noise can become productive. As Bateson puts it in the final sentence of his seminal "Cybernetic Explanation" (1967): "All that is not information, not redundancy, not form and not restraints - is noise," and noise is "the only possible source of new patterns" (410). Noise interferes with signal; but for an organism capable of self-organisation, it becomes the ground from which nourishment can be gleaned to produce new and complex structures of order, new levels of organisation. As Serres too implies: What is work? Undoubtedly, it is the struggle against noise [...] To work is to sort. [...] [L]ife itself works - that it is life through its struggle against the tendency to death, through sorting, through the activity of Maxwell's Demon. The organism gets order and</page><page sequence="12">366 Laura Salisbury energy, chews them up, sorts them, classifies them, and reforms its own order and its own energy, eliminating the waste-products. (2007, 86) Paulson suggests, then, that to hear the 'noise of culture' is to understand that literary language "can become information for us, can bring us more subtle forms of understanding, because it is the unexpected, the radically different to which we can respond only because we are already complex beings capable of yet more complexity" (99). It is, of course, hard work to read the description of Mr Knott, in which noisy restatement begins to occlude mimesis: one day Mr Knott would be tall, fat, pale and dark, and the next thin, small, flushed and fair, and the next sturdy, middle-sized, yellow and ginger, and the next small, fat, pale and fair, and the next middle-sized, flushed, thin and ginger, and the next tall, yellow, dark and sturdy (Beckett 1976, 209) And so on, towards what the reader fears might be infinitum. But unlike Watt's experience of Mr Knott's voice, from which "nothing was to be learnt" because of its use of "all male registers" (1976, 208), for the reader there is something to be learnt, or at least there is the potentiality of it. Things veer towards but do not quite descend into the "wild, dim chatter, meaningless to Watt's ailing ears" (1976, 208) because of the interpretative work the reader lays over the text. The noise of Watt does begin to mean for a reader capable of ordering what seems like disorganisation into complexity - into something that speaks of language's capacity to signify in multiple ways and is seeking to hear the existence of configurations of disorder and uncertainty. By beginning to pay attention to the language of systems, information and noise that echoes across Beckett's work, there might then be the possibility of bringing more clearly into focus the force of the need or the "obligation to express" (Beckett 1984, 139) (literally to press out), with which Beckett remains famously concerned. For it is clear that Beckett's obsession with opening the windows of what might otherwise be textual monads occurs at various levels within his texts. As David Houston Jones has argued in relation to The Lost Ones (1965) and Long Observation of the Ray (1975-76), Beckett's compelling use</page><page sequence="13">Art of Noise 367 of the vocabulary and discursive environment of thermodynamics appears in his obsession with the alleged impermeability of systems in his 'cylinder pieces.' Houston Jones suggests that the narrator's viewpoint in The Lost Ones is "inconsistently aligned both with that of the searchers [inside the closed system] and with that of an outside observer" (122). A way out of the cylinder is similarly posited in the text but never found, interfering with the integrity of the closed system in precisely the way that Maxwell's Demon ruins its own imagined conditions by allowing light and work to leak in. Jones also notes that "Like Maxwell's demon, Long Observation of the Ray depicts a closed chamber containing a shutter through which movement is possible" (123), suggesting a system with inputs and outputs. More fundamentally, however, across the cylinder pieces it is the narrator's reportage of the conditions inside that percolates through thresholds that might otherwise be imagined as impermeable. In All Strange Away (1964), the narrator explicitly intones that the imagined place has "no way in, none out"; but "imagination" and narration soon begin to suggest holes in the environment which leak negentropy into the system: "Imagine light. No visible source, glare at full" (Beckett 1995, 169). This putative impermeability is indeed then rendered drastically contingent: "no way in imagined yet, none out" (1995, 173; ital. mine). In the rotunda of Imagination Dead Imagine (early 1960s), in which there is similarly "No way in" to the cylinder, there is nevertheless the now articulated compulsion to "go in, measure" (1995, 182). And in Lessness (1969), the walls have fallen: "Ruins true refuge [...] All sides endlessness" (1995, 197). All the cylinders in Beckett's work are, in fact, open, as a narrator communicates their interior to an imagined other through a medium capable of penetrating those textual walls it nonetheless evokes. Perhaps this penetration of the cylinders' walls simply renders explicit and translates into the concerns of thermodynamics and information theory something that has always been known about language and literary text: texts and words, as carriers of information, create links, however complex and uncertain they may be, between systems. Texts mark a passage, a channel of communication, between creatures and creator, and between author and readers. But if this is so, it becomes revealing that even as far back as the 1930s, Beckett's work was obsessed with the figure of "dehiscence" - the opening of the walls of a seed-pod at maturity. Beckett copied this word into his Dream Notebook from Pierre Gamier's Onanisme seul et a deux (1894), but it</page><page sequence="14">368 Laura Salisbury also appears in Dream in suggestive proximity to images drawn from physics, as the imagined and longed-for art, shot through with gaps and holes and characterized by a "punctuation of dehiscence," is shaped as "a blizzard of electrons" pouring out from "the ultimately unprevisible atom come asunder" (Beckett 1996, 139). Of course, this figure of dehiscence finds its rhetorical apotheosis in the famous image from Beckett's German letter of 1937 of an artwork and specifically a language denuded of any puritan purity, or status as a pristine monad. Beckett writes: "To bore one hole after another in [language], until what lurks behind - be it something or nothing - begins to seep through; I cannot imagine a higher goal for a writer today" (1984, 172). But what information theory tells us is that to bore a hole is to open a system, both to noisy interference and to a noise that might be converted into new configurations of information or order. And if "dehiscence" is part of a metaphorical insistence which demands that text, and even word surface, be figured as gashed and gapped - penetrated and perforated by ways in and out through which something else begins to signify - it is also something which speaks of the potential for life, for reproduction, for a literal dissemination. Even in a world where all is moving towards heat-death, the dehiscence that may look just like an explosion of entropy and disorganisation is in fact in the service of life - it is spreading seeds to enable the production of new organisms, new configurations of meaning. Beckett's work indeed materializes a demand to read and experience texts as sites of contact and communication between living systems that compulsively yet creatively feed their processes of autopoiesis on noise, forcing contingent orders from a universe nonetheless understood as pulled towards muddy, entropic, disorganisation. Beckett's "obligation to express" might then be read according to the necessity to squeeze or press out something that seems like noise in one system, but that punches through the walls of a windowless, closed, environment to force new levels of organisation in another. By returning words to their commerce with what is usually represented as their outside, to their noisy capacity to produce sets of teeming and fertile links that penetrate through the walls of closed systems, Beckett's work begins to undo the sense that meaning only emerges from closing one's ears to noise, or that it appears in definitively sorting something from nothing (a procedure insistently refused in the German letter). Instead, language that begins to signify in multiple ways, creating new connections and patterns of order in other systems,</page><page sequence="15">Art of Noise 369 emerges from the productive groundswell of dehiscence. And this is perhaps one reason why an author so famed his attachment to diminution - "lessness" - and who spoke so fervently against interpretation, has left a legacy of work that is so hyperactively productive for literary criticism. For the noise the texts produce, while signalling entropic decline and the drift towards the death of all things, can also be used by readers who understand themselves to be, at least temporarily, alive and capable of producing further complexity from the careful configurations of noise that are being let in and out of these Beckettian systems. As the Unnamable avers, "Noises travel, traverse walls" (1994, 364), and for Beckett, perforating the walls of an airless pregiven system allows tiny breaths of oxygen to seep in and for something new to emerge from the nothing new. The noise in Beckett's texts that appears in one sense to be a death rattle might thus be thought of and experienced otherwise. Noise is not a symptom of something terminal; rather, in the Unnamable's lexicon, "this noise, it's life trying to get in, no, trying to get him out" (1994, 367). One of the legacies Beckett's work offers up, then, is that noise, for better and sometimes for worse, should be understood as a life sign. Notes 1. See Ackerley, Rabate, Salisbury. 2. George Bruce Halstead's translation of Poincare reads: "The imaginary demon of Maxwell, who is able to sort the molecules one by one, could well constrain the world to return backward" (qtd. in Jones, 132). 3. "A drop of wine falls into a glass of water, etc... One may shake it afterwards, the wine and the water do not seem capable of again separating. A grain of barley in a heap of wheat... the type of the irreversible physical phenomenon" (qtd. in Jones, 132). 4. Technically, absolute zero is marked by zero entropy configuration. 5. Paulson uses the 1972 work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, itself indebted to information theory, on autopoiesis as a way of exploring how systems might maintain their own organisation (121-30).</page><page sequence="16">370 Laura Salisbury Works Cited Ackerley, C.
