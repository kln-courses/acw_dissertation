Experimental Epistemology and the Perception of Causality Professor Albert Michotte, or, more formally, Baron Albert Edouard Michotte van den Berck, a member of a distinguished, well-to-do, noble Catholic Belgian family, had an illustrious and long career as student, faculty member, and head of the Psychology Institute at the University of Louvain. He was associated with that university (which was founded more than 500 years ago) from 1897, when he enrolled as a student at the age of 16, until his retirement in 1952; he continued to be active in his laboratory there for another decade, until shortly before his death in 1965. Although he had already established his reputation as a creative and productive experimental psychologist early in his career (he became a full professor in 1912, at 31 years of age), the work for which he became most famous was published primarily during the last two decades of his long life. His 1945 book La perception de la causalite [The Perception of Causality] reported an extensive ingenious series of phenomenological experiments-mostly carried out un- der exceedingly trying circumstances, including the bombing of Louvain during the Second World War. These experiments concerned the complex stimulus variables that compel such perceptions as that one moving object causes the motion of a second object with which the first collides. This work received extensive international acclaim almost immediately, even though the book, initially published in French, did not become available in English translation until 1963. It was the pioneer work in what later became the broader field of event perception, an area in the general domain of per- ception that is as far removed from the physiology of sensation and from classical psychophysics as one can be in that domain, and as close to cognition, thought, and epistemology as possible while still working on laboratory experiments in perception. Most of Michotte's publications were in French, although a few were in English, Dutch, Flemish, and Spanish. He was also fluent in German and Italian; indeed he received invitations to teach in Holland, England, Ger- many, France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, and the United States (the summer AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Summer 1994, Vol. 107, No. 2, pp. 275-326</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS Albert Michotte at the Psychological Laboratory, Louvain, 1939, from Michotte's Experimental Phenomenology of Perception. of 1929, incidentally, was spent as a visiting professor at Stanford University). Although a reading knowledge of French and German used to be taken for granted for most PhDs in psychology in the United States a half century or so ago, such skills have declined substantially during the last few decades, so Michotte's work has become progressively less accessible to American psychologists. True, an English abstract of the early versions of his later causality research was prepared for the 1929 International Congress of Psychology at Yale University (indeed, he attended every International Con- gress from 1905 until the 1950s), and he published an article in English in 1950 in Reymert's Mooseheart Symposium on feelings and emotions. Never- theless, except for a few of his articles (and his book) that were translated into English, his work remained either inaccessible to psychologists in the United States or so hard to obtain (or read, once obtained, for those whose 276</page><page sequence="3">French proficiency was shaky) that it has not received the wide attention in America that it deserves. Michotte did not study the perception of causality as an isolated problem, or as an experimental tour de force (which it actually was), but as one aspect of the broad and fundamental problem of the theory of knowledge, or epistemology, itself. He points out in his autobiography (in this volume, p. 46) that he believed that he had a special knack for experimental research, and he remained an experimenter throughout his career. However, he did not consider this work as merely a "hunt for facts" or simply collecting observations. His experiments were always "dominated by the concern to contribute to the study of one or another of the large questions," and (in 1954) he commented that his "work of the last 10 years on phenomenology represents the outcome of an entire life of research and reflection." It is the expansion and elaboration of his experimental phenomenology of per- ception, his experimental epistemology, which was initially focused on the perception of causality, that constitutes the main content of the present volume. Most of the book consists of translations of Michotte's late articles into English, most of which originally were published in French and some of which appeared in outlets that generally are not easily accessible to Amer- ican psychologists. So it makes available in English for the first time the work that Michotte himself considered the culmination of his long-and others would add, his highly productive-career. The three editors, as indicated in the Preface to the book (p. x), all have a long-standing interest in Michotte and his work. Georges Thines, who like Michotte was a student and then a professor at the University of Louvain, was Michotte's last assistant at Louvain. Coincidentally, the International Authors and Writers Who's Who lists Thines's address as on the Avenue Car- dinal Mercier-and Michotte considered the man who later became Cardinal Mercier, and who was a professor at the University of Louvain while Michotte studied there, one of his own two greatest teachers. Alan Costall, on the faculty of the University of Southampton, England, was introduced while he was an undergraduate to Michotte's work by Tim Miles, who with Elaine Miles translated Michotte's book on the perception of causality into English. George Butterworth, who spent some time at the University of Southampton but whose institutional affiliation is listed on the title page as Stirling Uni- versity in Scotland, became acquainted with Michotte's works on perception and cognition, and on phenomenal permanence, while engaged in his doc- toral research on the development of the concept of object permanence. Costall appears to have done the lion's share of the work required to prepare the manuscript for the book. He did, or was involved in, almost all of the translations from the French, and he prepared more new material (the Preface, general introductory material, and introductions to the major subsections of the volume) than either of the other editors. His justification for the volume begins the Preface as follows: Toward the end of a long and productive career, the Belgian psychologist, Albert 277 BOOK REVIEWS</page><page sequence="4">Michotte, embarked upon a fresh phase of research, his experimental phenom- enology of perception. Only a small portion of this important research has been published in English translation; therefore, the purpose of our book is to present a selection of the most significant and representative papers.... We have ... provided introductions to the various themes and more general accounts of his career and work in order to provide historical context and some indication of links with current research. (p. ix) There are indeed (a few) indications of how Michotte's work of three or four decades ago is directly related to current research; what may be even more striking is how Michotte's strategy can be seen as a complement, a counterbalance, even a necessary antidote, to much of the current hyper- analytic, microquantitative, reductionistic work in cognition that relies so heavily on the computer not only as a control, stimulus, recording, and data- analytic device, but also as the sole model for mind. Michotte deals with the larger questions; he tries to understand nothing less than how the mind really works, how humans manage to obtain information about their envi- ronment that is useful to them and that permits them to function effectively within the environment. That is why it makes sense for this book to be part of a series on ecological psychology-an inclusion that at first might strike the reader as odd. The series, Resources for Ecological Psychology, is dedicated to James J. Gibson, whose 1979 book, The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception, as a systematic sequel to his influential 1950 volume, The Perception of the Visual World, is widely recognized as establishing a new focus on the interaction between organism and environment. Gibson "used the term ecological psychology to emphasize [the] animal-environment mutuality for the study of problems of perception" (p. vii). Ecological psychology, in this sense, concerns the "in- formation transactions between living systems and their environments, es- pecially as they pertain to perceiving situations of significance to planning and execution of purposes activated in an environment" (p. vii). As for the relation between Gibson's and Michotte's perspectives, Costall goes so far as to assert that "Gibson was astounded by the close similarity between Michotte's later work and his own" (p. ix). Costall quotes a passage from Gibson's 1967 autobiography that, in Gibson's typically whimsical, pithy, and no-nonsense style, makes the point unmistakably: There are other psychologists who have thought about perception almost as I do, but not quite. The one with whom in recent years I have been in strikingly near agreement is Albert Michotte, of Louvain.... It is a notable lesson in the convergence of experimental science that such a man as he and such a one as I, from totally different backgrounds, should have found ourselves agreeing so thoroughly and so delightedly-he, a student of Cardinal Mercier and I of the materialist Holt; he, a believer and phenomenologist and I a skeptic and behav- iorist; he, a member of the conservative Belgian nobility, a prince of the Catholic Church, and I a Midwestern Sunday-school radical with an underlying suspicion of popery. We got the same results. This is what counts. It makes one believe in the possibility of getting at the truth. (pp. ix-x) Both Gibson and Michotte, each in his own somewhat different way, "chal- 278 BOOK REVIEWS</page><page sequence="5">lenged the view, prevalent in the theory of vision since Medieval times, that perception is ultimately dependent upon the intervention of intellect" (p. x). What both of them argued was that the environment provides far more information, and that the human perceptual apparatus is far more capable of directly sensing this information, than prevailing theories of perception have recognized for centuries. Meaning, value, and other complex aspects of the environment of which we are aware are not the product of simple sensory processes worked on by laborious inference from past experience, but are directly accessible because of the combined characteristics of the environment itself and of the perceptual mechanisms built into the human being. This view challenges not only venerable doctrines, such as those of the empiricist philosophers George Berkeley and David Hume or of the physicist- physiologist-psychologist Hermann von Helmholtz, but also recent theorists ranging from the transactionalist Adelbert Ames to the majority of today's computer-obsessed cognitive scientists who bother to write or think about classic questions of epistemology in general or of perception in particular. As Costall puts it in a brief "General Introduction": Michotte's work is directly relevant to current debates and developments in psychology. Many of the assumptions challenged by Michotte .. .have regained a dominant hold on psychological theory. These include the "intellectualist" interpretation of perception (e.g., the treatment of perception as a process of logical inference or hypothesis-making); the commitment to a view of the indi- vidual as a mere spectator, and the consequent neglect of human activity and artifacts; and the assumption that meaning is purely "subjective" and derivative- a mental projection upon a neutral and colorless world. (p. 2) Michotte (and Gibson) is a necessary gadfly, to prod modern cognitive psy- chologists to recognize that their drab world is their own artificial construc- tion, and that the real world which human beings perceive, and within which they live and act, is far richer, more colorful, and more meaningful than they have made it out to be. Michotte's experimental phenomenology dem- onstrates conclusively that we are directly aware of complex, rich, subtle interactive phenomena in our physical (and social) environment that have been inappropriately ignored in most contemporary work in cognition in general and in perception in particular. The book is divided into five sections, each with an introduction; it ends with a bibliography of Michotte's works and (very brief and somewhat in- complete and even occasionally inaccurate) author and subject indexes. Five photographs fill pages 26 and 27; dating from 1928 to 1957, they show Michotte at a meeting of Gestalt psychologists, in his laboratory, visiting the Cambridge psychology laboratory, at a Louvain symposium with Jean Piaget and a few other people, and presenting the Presidential Address at the 15th International Congress of Psychology in Brussels. The main corpus of the volume consists of articles by Michotte himself, most of them translated for this book from the French. How were these articles selected? To repeat, Costall claimed that the 279 BOOK REVIEWS</page><page sequence="6">editors' purpose was "to present a selection of the most significant and representative papers" that Michotte had written on "his experimental phe- nomenology of perception" (p. ix). Elsewhere (pp. 1-2), Costall writes that the book "provides translations of almost all of Michotte's papers published after 1946." But a comparison of the contents with the bibliography of Michotte's works at the end of the book shows that several of Michotte's post-1946 publications did not become part of the volume. Some of those that were not included consist of summaries of other work, but a number of them reported work on such topics as circular perceptual structures, the role of language in perceptual organization, and the visual perception of circular movements-work not summarized in other articles included in the book. A bit more internal sleuthing in the information available in several different places in the book yields the impression that most of the content is, in effect, an English version of most of the content of a 1962 French jubilee book, Causalite, permanence, et realite phenomenales [Phenomenal Caus- ality, Permanence, and Reality], cited in the bibliography on page 249 only as authored by "A. Michotte et collaborateurs" and published in the series Studia Psychologica at Louvain by Publications Universitaires; that volume was a collection of the later articles by Michotte and his students and col- leagues. Only a handful of the articles in that volume do not appear in the present one, and only a scant handful of those in the present volume (outside of the introduction) did not appear in the earlier French one. Thus, the present volume is an English translation of (most of) the earlier French one, with the addition of introductory material, a (one-page) abstract of Michotte's presentation to the 1929 International Congress, and translations of two French articles published after the French collection appeared, both of them coauthored by Thines. Whatever the rationale or basis for inclusion or exclusion of particular articles, Costall's observation is apt: "This book... complements The Per- ception of Causality (Michotte, 1963) to make available in translation the full scope of Michotte's experimental phenomenology of perception" (p. 2). Although not as carefully structured as Michotte's 1945 (English trans., 1963) book on the perception of causality, it contains a useful baker's dozen of Michotte's writings, mostly later ones: the abstract of his 1929 International Congress presentation, two articles from 1948, three from 1950, one each from 1951, 1953, 1955, 1960, 1963, and 1964, and his autobiography of 1954, as well as useful introductory and supplementary material. The collection of Michotte's articles is preceded by a note on the Resources for Ecological Psychology series, a brief preface, and 50 pages of "General Introduction." The introduction begins with a brief general note by Costall, followed by a thoughtful historical-analytical essay by Costall on "The Back- ground to Michotte's Experimental Phenomenology" and a brief descriptive and analytical essay entitled "The Experimental Phenomenology of Albert Michotte" by Thines. It also provides a three-page chronological summary of Michotte's life, and a fairly lengthy autobiography. The autobiography is a translation by Costall of a 1954 French publication in Psychologica Belgica; 280 BOOK REVIEWS</page><page sequence="7">it is curious that Costall had to translate that autobiography anew, because J. G. Beebe-Center of Harvard University had already provided a fine English translation of the same autobiography, which Michotte had submitted, in French, on invitation for the 1952 edition of A History of Psychology in Au- tobiography. Overall, this introductory material provides a useful background for the four remaining parts that make up the bulk of the volume. Each of these sections consists of several articles by Michotte, preceded by introductory comments. They are devoted, respectively, to phenomenal causality, phe- nomenal permanence, phenomenal reality, and perception and cognition. Part 2, the longest section in the book (65 pages), devoted to "Phenomenal Causality," begins with a thorough 10-page introduction by Costall, followed by four items. Michotte's one-page 1929 abstract for the Ninth International Congress of Psychology at Yale University (translated from French by Costall) makes clear that Michotte was already thinking much earlier along the lines of experimental phenomenological research that were to culminate more than a decade and a half later in his famous book on the perception of causality. A late summary article (1963) on perceived causality, some 20 pages long, comes next. By Michotte and Thines, it was translated into English by Thines, Costall, and Butterworth (and also was published in a German translation in 1966 in Wolfgang Metzger's enormous handbook of psychology, for which it was presumably written). The third item, by Michotte alone, about 15 pages long, is a translation by Costall of "The Perception of the 'Tool Effect'" from 1951; it concerns the perception of causality when one moving object in effect "uses" a second passive one to (apparently) generate motion in a third. Last in the section is Michotte's 13-page con- tribution to the 1950 Reymert book, Feelings and Emotions: The Mooseheart Symposium, "The Emotions Regarded as Functional Connections," which extends the perception of causality to perceptions of feelings and emotions in (apparently) animate moving objects. It is somewhat surprising that there is no mention in Michotte's article of the classic 1944 work by Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel, "An Ex- perimental Study of Apparent Behavior," published in the American Journal of Psychology (Vol. 57, pp. 243-259), because that article studied the same anthropomorphic tendency to see complex intentions, feelings, and emotions in moving geometric forms to which Michotte's contribution to the Moose- heart Symposium is largely devoted. Costall, though, dutifully if briefly does allude to the Heider and Simmel work in his introductory remarks for Part 2. Part 3, 50 pages long, on "Phenomenal Permanence," is introduced by a 5-page commentary by Butterworth, and contains only two articles. As But- terworth points out, Michotte's significant claim is that, as with his writings on causality, "the configurational quality of the stimulus is what determines the experience of [object] permanence. Thus, when one object is occluded by another, we do not [typically] perceive it as having been annihilated but as continuing to exist, although hidden" (p. 117). Further, "complete shapes BOOK REVIEWS 281</page><page sequence="8">are perceived even though the contours may be only partially specified" (p. 118). He observes that "[t]hese phenomena are obviously related to Ge- stalt demonstrations" (p. 118) and, furthermore, "these structures are in- herent within experience and do not depend on learning" (p. 119). Indeed, the affinity to the work of the Gestalt psychologists on perception crops up repeatedly throughout the whole book. The first article in this section, translated by Butterworth and Costall, is 18 pages long; entitled "On Phe- nomenal Permanence: Facts and Theories," its French original had been published in 1950. The discussion in this paper summarizes experimental work primarily from the preceding decade, but also includes such everyday examples as putting a hand in one's pocket (p. 128); obviously the hand is only hidden or screened, not severed. The typical phenomenal object "is not a sum of properties ... but a total structure, a Gestalt" (p. 126). Impres- sions of changes in an object are "characterized by the identity of the object, despite the apparent change in some of its properties" (p. 137). This overall somewhat abstract article ends with the assertion that "the permanence of objects is not only an original phenomenal datum ... but is also easily under- stood to stem from the principles that govern the structural organization of perception" (p. 139). The second article, 27 pages long, by Michotte, Thines, and Genevieve Crabbe, translated by T. R. and E. Miles and first published in 1964, concerns the completion of perceptual structures, static as well as dynamic ones. It, too, has strong similarities to Gestalt work, on such phenomena as closure and gap-filling, work that is acknowledged in the article; it refers to work done in Michotte's laboratory primarily during the two preceding decades. The conclusion once again is that completion phenomena do not appear in any capricious or arbitrary manner. [Rather, their occurrence in] the great majority of cases ... in perceptual structures is directly determined by the action of the stimulus system upon the subject just as is the case with the nonhidden parts of these structures. In other words, their presence is governed by the laws of organization of the perceptual field, for example those that de- termine whether a [common contour] belongs to one or the other of two adjacent surfaces, that is, the laws that control integration and segregation, namely sim- ilarity, proximity, good continuation, closure, etc. (p. 164) Part 4, on "Phenomenal Reality," 50 pages long, is introduced by Costall and contains four substantial papers by Michotte, all of them translated by Costall alone. Much of this section concerns "picture perception research," work that "is hardly known among English speaking psychologists" (p. 169). A major focus is "the apparent reality of perceptual data" (p. 170), even when the observer knows that this reality is illusory. The first paper, 13 pages long, originally published in 1948, reports experimental work on our ability to see volume in pictures with perspective, even though we can also see that the image of those pictures is indeed flat. The paper makes extensive reference to the Gestalt literature, and to the Gestalt "law of Pragnanz." Michotte concludes that "three-dimensionality and reality are different prop- erties of our perceptions and must be considered as independent dimensions 282 BOOK REVIEWS</page><page sequence="9">of our visual experience." Reality refers to "the potential for being manip- ulated," whereas three-dimensionality concerns "the capacity for being matched to the volume of a substantial object" (p. 181). A 10-page second article, from 1960, concerns the real and the unreal in the perceptual image. Among other points, it reiterates, on the basis of substantial experimental findings, that "we see volume and space in all perspective draw- ings.... [W]hat is involved here is not a process of inference or interpre- tation, nor, as is naively claimed, the expansion somehow of a flat sensory image into depth by the imagination. We are concerned here with the immediate perception of volume and depth" (p. 192). The third paper, 12 pages long, originally published in 1948 in an international film journal, is devoted to the strange "reality" of events depicted in the cinema (or on the stage); we obviously do not "react in the same way to the events in the cinema as we would to their counterparts in everyday life" (p. 197). Further, although the "characters act here and now," it is clear "that our contact with them lacks the immediacy of real life" (p. 208). The article is a so- phisticated and subtle phenomenological analysis of the complex percep- tual-and epistemological-phenomena of watching make-believe events. The last article in Part 4, also translated from the same film journal but first published in 1953, concerns classic problems of empathy and begins a fascinating analysis of the phenomenal nature of the self or "me." Although parts of this article may appear somewhat obscure to an experimental psy- chologist, it doubtless provided some particularly difficult challenges to the translator. Once again, an effort is made to extend the classic laws of per- ceptual organization-this time, to issues of empathy and to the description of the phenomenal self. Part 5, 25 pages long, on perception and cognition, consists of a brief introduction by Costall and Butterworth, a translation by Costall of a 2-page abstract of a paper Michotte gave at the 1948 International Congress of Psychology, and an 18-page translation by Costall, Butterworth, and Thines of Michotte's address on perception and cognition at the 1954 International Congress. The substance of the section concerns several themes, such as "how seeing causality . . differs from believing or inferring its existence" (p. 220), "that meanings can indeed be perceived, and in a way largely au- tonomous of intellectual intervention,... that perception is... a distinct mode of knowing, capable, in itself, of supporting an adaptive relation between the organism and its environment" (p. 221), and that "[p]erception itself provides a limitless and continuous flow of information about our surround- ings, whereas cognition allows us to go beyond this information, to integrate, categorize and explain it" (p. 222). We obtain information about the world (pp. 227-228) in three ways: through perception, through our cognitive attempts to make sense of impressions we get from perception, and-because we are inherently social beings-through our verbal communications with our fellow humans. Thus the book ends, appropriately enough, with Mi- chotte's attempt to come squarely to grips with the classic and enduring problem of epistemology. After this fairly lengthy-though still cursory-summary of the contents 283 BOOK REVIEWS</page><page sequence="10">of this rich book, it is tempting to go back over the details mentioned in Michotte's autobiography and in the chronology of his life, and to speculate about the origins of Michotte's creative and productive contributions. He began in natural science, was thoroughly steeped in rigorous experimental methodology, worked for some time as a young investigator with Wilhelm Wundt, became dissatisfied with Wundt's teachings when he encountered the work of Oswald Kiilpe and especially, later on, the work of the Gestalt psychologists. Though influenced by all of these major figures in the early twentieth-century history of psychology, Michotte managed to develop his own unique blend of precise experimentation and sophisticated, sensitive phenomenology. He broke his own research career down into three phases: systematic introspection (1905-1920), reaction to behaviorism (1920-1939), and experimental phenomenology (from 1939 on). He characterized his own mature psychology as "dynamic and, at once, both functionalist and struc- turalist" (p. 46). Further details can be gleaned from his modest yet in- formative autobiography, and from the insightful introductory commentary by Costall and his coeditors. Although Michotte's work was in an important sense clearly independent, there was a close parallel between his methodology and conclusions with the methodology and conclusions of the Gestalt psychologists Max Wert- heimer, Wolfgang Kohler, Kurt Koffka, and their followers. The nature of that parallel is indicated in part by the fact that shortly after Michotte's book on the perception of causality was published in French, Kohler rec- ommended it strongly to one of his students at Swarthmore College who was majoring in French at the time. That student, a son of Max Wertheimer (myself, your reviewer), was totally fascinated by the book and by the book's author, and explored with Kohler the possibility of spending a postbacca- laureate year or two, starting in 1947, studying with Michotte at the Uni- versity of Louvain. Kohler initiated preliminary correspondence about the matter with Michotte, application materials for support from the Belgian- American Education Foundation were obtained, but for various reasons this opportunity was not fully pursued. I cannot help wondering, having just retired from a long and satisfying academic career in psychology, how that career might have been different if those preliminary explorations had come to fruition. Be that as it may, it is encouraging that the later work of the distinguished experimental phenomenologist and epistemologist Albert Michotte is finally, with this volume, made available in English. Unfortunately, the book suffers from a hasty job of copyediting (e.g., it is surprisingly riddled with typo- graphical errors in the French references). These are only minor irritations, however. The substance of the book reaffirms the tremendously rich and awesomely sophisticated achievements of human perception and cognition, and probes these achievements with precise and convincing experimental methods. Although these methods and the questions they are used to in- vestigate may in some ways appear foreign to the typical mainstream cog- nitive psychologist of the mid-1990s, that makes this book all the more 284 BOOK REVIEWS</page><page sequence="11">instructive and indispensable. Modern computer-based cognitive science has made impressive strides, but in an artificially constricted domain, with at- tention only to excessively narrowly formulated problems. Michotte provides a much broader perspective, places the cognitive issues squarely back into the framework of the classic epistemological and philosophical questions from which they arose and to which they belong, and does so with a fetching combination of humility, phenomenological acumen, and methodological precision. Every modern cognitive psychologist should be exhorted to read this book, and to read it carefully-not only for sheer enjoyment, but also to learn some important lessons concerning the limitations of the current cognitive paradigms, and to explore how it might be possible to regain an overview of what cognitive psychology, after all, is really about. Albert Michotte was remarkably wise, and the editors of this book are to be con- gratulated for making his wisdom accessible to the English-speaking world.

Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, 1990. 285 pp. Cloth, $29.95. Structure Building: The Search for a Unified Theory of Language Comprehension If I had to choose one monograph that exemplifies the state of psychology of language today in its quest for a unified theory, I would have to seriously consider Morton Gernsbacher's Language Comprehension as Structure Building. A model of how monographs should be written, the book summarizes the author's research of the past decade in a clear, gender-fair, and jargon-free manner. It generously provides examples of experimental stimuli, and the results are presented in graphs that make the conclusions obvious. A sum- mary is also provided at the end of each major section, which both aids hurried readers and facilitates reading the book in its entirety. With a fast- paced, friendly style and the use of the structure-building analogy referred to in the title, Gernsbacher's text proves that experimental psychology need not be boring to be informative. Gernsbacher's monograph also exemplifies one of the major quandaries of contemporary psychology of language: Methodological clarity can conceal conceptual problems (Wittgenstein, 1958). Her methodological strengths hide important difficulties within the conceptual framework of the structure- building analogy. First, some of the processes described in Language Com- prehension as Structure Building are treated as similar, when they may be quite different. Second, the inconsistent use of the structure-building analogy gives it more explanatory power than it should have. Gernsbacher argues that 285 BOOK REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
