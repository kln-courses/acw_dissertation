<plain_text><page sequence="1">Protonorms On the Biological Roots of Social Norms BY STANISLAW EHRLICH, WARSAW Introductory remarks — choice ofthe topic The présent study attempts to give an account of the emergence of the first, most primitive social norms, norms which do not yet form a cohesive normative System as they regúlate only limited areas of behaviour within a group of the most highly developed apes — the chimpanzees. This attempt, hardly an independent one — indeed, derivative would be a more appropriate word to describe it—can be regarded as a reinterpretation and élaboration — in terms of normative phenomena — of the now famous field research on chimpan zees by the biologist and ethologist, Jane van Lawick-Goodall, as presented in her book entitled "In the Shadow of Man" (1971), and also in some later contributions. This is how she justified the choice of her subject of research: "The amazing success of man as a species ... is the resuit of the evolutionary development of his brain which has led, among other things, to tool-using and tool making, the ability to solve problems by logical reasoning, thoughtful coopération, and language. One of the most striking ways in which the chimpanzee biologically resembles man lies in the structure of his brain. The chimpanzee with its marked capacity for primitive reasoning, exhibits a type of intelligence which is closer to that of man than is the case with any other mammal living today." (p. 233) Six years later E. Leakey and R. Lewin pointed to another affinity between man and chimpanzee: the protein analysis, which sets man and chimpanzee even fùrther apart from other great apes. (1977, ch. 3) Another aspect of this affinity has to do with the fact that the two species have not only common genetic roots but have had a common eradle: according to the hypothesis most widely accepted by modem science (especially paleanthropology, ethology and molecular biology) man' s origins are to be found in the vicinity of the great lakes of Central Africa, i.e. an area still inhabited by chimpanzees today (there are none outside Africa). Thus, as chimpanzees and hominids, along with baboons, constituted elements of neighbouring habitats, they must have been in contact and interacted with each other. It is not my aim to establish how and when the paths of the hominid and the chimpanzee world bifurcated: there is an ample and readily available body of literature on the subject, which would make such a rétrospective superfluous. It would also disrapt the course of interprétation undertaken in the présent work. Before I proceed to the substance of the argument I must address myself to two important questions — what is there to justify my unusual décision to base the analysis of protonorms on a single book? and, secondly, what is it that I understand a protonorm to be? To answer the first of the two questions I will recall the words of L. S. B. Leakey, the man who was Jane van Lawick-Goodall's teacher and who inspired her research: before</page><page sequence="2">84 Stanislaw Ehrlich her there had only been one man who had endeavoured to study chimpanzee behaviour in the wild. That man was Dr. H. Nissen, whose pioneering work lasted a mere two and a half months (p. 20). Lawick-Goodall, on the other hand, whose initial success during a two-year stint of fieldwork later earned her a doctoral degree at Cambridge University, was able to organize and conduct research for a total of 20 years. And through this whole period her research was devoted exclusively to one stabilized group of chimpanzees numbering several dozen. That allowed her to identify almost all the members of the group and to investígate individual behaviour within three générations of apes. The vast research material thus collected enabled her to make a number of significantdiscoveries. Other relevant studies, carried out in the isolation of laboratories and zoological gardens, are therefore of negligible importance for the task I have undertaken. The same is true of the other rather few field studies. Their fragmentary nature could in no way invalidate the wealth of material gathered by Jane van Lawick-Goodall, and they only Supplement it with détails, which, in view of my basic assumptions, add nothing fundamentally new to her analysis. The other reason behind by décision stems firom the fact that, because of her biological-ethnological background, Jane van Lawick-Goodall was prevented from disceming the various features of normative processes in the studied group of chimpanzees — to do so would have required a solid basis in social sciences, although I have to admit she made serious efforts in this direction (1983, pp. 129—141). To conclude these introductory remarks, I would like to define a norm, which I understand in an interdisciplinary way, as a décision determining récurrent pattems of behaviour within a group and/or with regard to members of other groups. Such décisions are reinforced by rewards and sanctions (punishments). This means that I consider a norm as a binding pattem of behaviour which occurs with varying intensity and in various interrelations. (This subject is developed in my book The Dynamics ofNorms (Polish), Warsaw, 1988.) 1. Rudiments of family norms The sexual promiscuity of chimpanzees means that fatherhood is unknown in their communities and consequently all family life centres round the mother. "The exclusion of the male from familial responsibilities is — writes Lawick-Goodall — one of the major différences between human and chimpanzee societies." (p. 184) A few matriar chichal families within a Community of several dozen chimpanzees is enough to make it cohesive. Male rivalry for dominance in the group (which will be discussed below) is of secondary importance, as the dominant position gained by a male is a precarious one and a male's supremacy never lasts longer than a couple of years. — The finest males climb to the top of the "social ladder" only to be removed from there, some time later, by a younger rival, whereas the high rank enjoyed by a mother and her disciplining role within the family and, through it, within the group, is an enduring factor. "One of the most stabilizing factors for the adolescent male may well be his relationship with his mother", writes Jane van Lawick-Goodall. "Old Ho, affectionate and tolerant with all her off spring, was frequentlyaccompaniedbyFaben and Figan during their adolescence... For the most part, these adolescent males, even when they were ten or eleven years old, continued to show respect for their mothers. If we offered a banana the son usually stood back and waited for his mother to take the fruit... On many occasions a mother will hurry to try to help her adolescent son... As the</page><page sequence="3">Protonorms — On the Biological Roots of Social Norms 85 adolescent male gets older he becomes increasingly likely to hurry to his mother's aid when she is threatened or attacked." (pp. 171—173) It is within the family circle that the most fundamental social bonds emerge; they are emotional in nature but that does not overshadow their consolidating normative features, relating to the binding and enforceable patterns of behaviour. even those family protonorms are quite diverse: they operate vertically — between the mother and her offspring, and horizontally — between siblings, who show solidarity in giving support to one another in all conflicts. The bonds linking siblings, inculcated in them while they play, under the watchful eye of the mother, with an infant chimp, acquire a special intensity if the young chimpanzees are orphaned. The siblings become more protective and develop a stronger sense of "duty". This is how Jane van Lawick-Goodall describes the relationships within the mother sibling triangle: "... Fifi's fascination for her small brother became almost an obsession. She spent nearly all her day playing with him, grooming him as he slept, or carrying him about with her. Flo, it seemed, was often far from displeased to shed, from time to time, part of her load of maternal responsibility. Provided that Fifi did not carry Flint out of sight, and provided there were no potentially aggressive males nearby, she no longer objected when Fifi 'kidnapped' Fling. Nor did Flo seem to mind if other youngsters approached Flint to play gently with him. But Fifi did! If she suddenly noticed Gilka, or another of her erstwhile playmates, close to Flint, Fifi instantly abandoned whatever she was doing, rushed over and chased the youngster away, her hair bristling, her arms flailing, her feet stamping the ground. Even chimps much older than herseif, provided they were subordínate to Flo, were threatened or even attacked by aggressive Fifi." (P- 113) Socialization within the "matriarchal" family of chimpanzees is aimed at a better adjustment of the offspring to living in a group and to safe behaviour in a natural habitat. This is facilitated by family protonorms, which allow for an extended educational process. It seems reasonable to extrapólate, from the behaviour pattems of chimpanzees, similar behaviour patterns among the hominids with whom the chimpanzees coexisted. Just as in chimpanzee communities, the foundation of their more intricate social structure must have been anything eise but the expressive bonds between a mother and her offspring. Family protonorms show great durability; bonds developed on an emotional and spontaneous and emotional basis functíon thanks to positive and negative reinforcement (or "reinforcers"), i.e. rewards and punishments. What is striking about the proportion of those two kinds of reinforcement is the wide use of rewards in the educational process, which, incidentally, as she herseif admits, influenced Jane van Lawick-Goodall's own attitudes as a mother. On the other hand, the impact of punishments, even if they do grow violent due to emotion, is immediately softened by solacing and forgiving gestures and patting, as soon as the punished individual accepts his or her punishment. Such normative behaviour, developed thanks to family des, is characteristic of a wide variety of protonorms functioning in the whole of the chimpanzee Community, and it leads to the strengthening of "prosocial" attitudes. While the sexual promiscuity of chimpanzees has been mentioned above, it must be noted that this promiscuity is far from being absolute. Jane van Lawick-Goodall cites sporadic cases of prolonged courtship—which points to a decisively selective treatment of the female—with some of the more enamoured couples disappearing in the forest for long periods of isolation from the group. (p. 189,191 ) From these observations she does</page><page sequence="4">86 Stanislaw Ehrlich not, however, advance the hypothesis that these sporadic instances of anomalous sexual behaviour might foreshadow the Coming of monogamy. There is also no eviOdence that monogamy began to crystallize in the "ape-men", the hominid "missing link" of évolution. It should be underscored however that not one author stresses the point that among other apes monogamy is to be found too, as a prévalent form or concurring with polygamy, e.g. among mantle-baboons and Sumatra gibbons. (M. Gruter 1979, Kap. IV; H. Kummer 1971) A parallel to be easily observed in human societies, with the réservation made by I. De Vore (1965) that this practice is conditioned among the apes by the natural environment and in the case of human societies by culture. 2. Other protonorms: protonorms within the group 2.1. Patterns of communication and socialization Group protonorms regúlate various areas of chimpanzee behavoiur. These include behaviour within the sub-groups of adult and adolescent maies, mothers, adolescent females, and, finally, youngsters. Significantly, the chimpanzees exhibit ahigh degree of identification with these sub-groups, as well as a sense of their own identity, which leads to fréquent social contacts. The greeting ceremony (even after a very short period of séparation) covers a whole range of friendly démonstrations. "When two chimpanzees greet each other after a séparation their behaviour often looks amazingly like that shown by two humans in the same context. Chimpanzees may bow or crouch to the ground, hold hands, kiss, embrace, touch or pat each other on almost any part of the body, particularly the head and face and genitals. A maie may chuck a female or an infant under the chin. Humans in many cultures show one or more of these gestures." On those occasions chimpanzees reveal différences in their respective social positions, (p. 239 ff.) When coming to a new, alien territory, other groups of chimpanzees announce their arrivai beforehand by loud pant-hooting—they do so in order to ensure a friendly or at least a neutral réception. A chimpanzee infant is, in a sense, treated as a newcomer, and it always arouses general curiosity. Presenting it to the other members of the group, the mother in a way introduces it into the Community. But she does that very carefully and very peremptorily. The siblings of course have priority of contact with the infant; they are followed by other mothers and their offspring, and only then by adult maies. Should the behaviour of the onlookers be improper, the mother will not allow contact with the infant, and her prohibiting attitude is accepted by everyone. The games played by juveniles are of an exclusive, age-related character, and are governed by separate rules. By far the most widespread form of socialization, which serves a number of différ ent purposes, is reciprocal grooming. Grooming sessions take place while the maies are resting together, and as such they are — to use an anthropomorphic analogy — the équivalent of an all-male club meeting; grooming may also manifest the friendly feel ings of two individuáis of the same or opposing sexes, and at times it may turn into play ful tickling. Grooming is also a way of smoothing over a recent conflict, a means of relieving tension or ending hostile confrontation. Age, however, is an impenetrable barrier for attempts to engage in this intimacy: a youngster will not be permitted to groom.</page><page sequence="5">Protonorms — On the Biological Roots of Social Norms 87 A palpable mixture of chimpanzee "savoir-vivre", grooming contributes to the formation of sub-groups within the whole constituted by a given chimpanzee Commu nity, a Community which never merges with others and which always retains its distinctiveness — despite the fréquent contacts by one or several individuáis with other groups of chimpanzees. It also leads to permanent des of friendship between two or more individuáis—such as the long-standing and close friendship between the dominant maie Goliath and Greybeard. In this context it is worthwhile to mention that there are sociobiogists and ethnolo gists who share the view that there exist roots of biological moráis which shed some light on the altruistic behaviour of primates. S. S. Stent (ed., 1979) and J. R. Ardrey give the classic example of the "sentinel" which is sacrificing its life for the sake of the herd (and of its biological competitors) although there would be a chance to save itself. One is tempted to say: an incipient feeling of reciprocity. Chr. Boehm puis forward the hypothesis of protonorms of morality as having its roots in genetics (1983). This pattern of behaviour coloured with emotion is not unsimilar to the ethical of human beings. However, there are researchers who challenge the scientific value of this kind of analogies (H. Kummer 1981,31 ff.). The concept of an emerging sense of mutual gains could be another approach to these problems (R. Trivers, 1981), like the fundamen tal norm of reciprocity, which is well known in anthropology and sociology. (St. Ehrlich 1988) Tangible rules can also be seen to govern the fréquent displays, which, among other things, serve a special group-related aim of selecting not so much a leader as a dominant maie, and of instituting changes in the social hierarchy. The question of displays, however, goes beyond the scope of establishing norms for social contacts, and as such it will be discussed in another section (section 4). It must be remembered that intergroup mobility in chimpanzee communities is also contributed to by factors of biological development: maturation and ageing. An indivi dual may also be isolated ffom a group because of disease. When a polio épidémie paralyzed a number of individuáis, the sudden, incomprehensible change in their behaviour caused healthy members of the group to withdraw from contacts with the Sick. Because of their physiology chimpanzees have been unable to develop language, yet they have attained a level of development allowing a complex and effective System of communication. The system is made up of a whole array of calis that convey, in the briefest form, all the major kinds of information relating to the State of the surroundings and the emotional State of the sender of the message. This set of calis is supplemented by non-auditory means of communication such as gestures and an unusually rieh répertoire of facial features. This whole "communicative repertory", pedantically catalogued by Jane van Lawick-Goodall, is subject to stable rules of use and therefore constitutes a valuable system of information-conveying means, being absolutely unam biguous, which practically precludes any instances of communicative failure. This makes one reflect on human language, which, with all the richness of its resources, and the human facility in creating symbols, is beset by ambiguity, which acts very much like mechanical disturbances and consequently hampers communications between the Sen ders and récipients of information. Various protonorms, which have developed in the course of group interaction among chimpanzees, are strengthened by a system of rewards and punishments. Juveniles are shown much indulgence by adult chimpanzees, but they also seem to have, in their</page><page sequence="6">88 Stanislaw Ehrlich attitudes and behaviour a kind of in-built habit of observing the behaviour of eiders and learning from them. Rewards usually are granted to submissive individuáis who recognize the established social hierarchy; punishments, on the other hand, mostly consisting in physical maltreatment (always kept within some limits and thus never meant to do injury to health), are inflicted on those who have shown disrespect for the social position of a superior individual, or simply those, who have had the misfortune of coming into the way of an angry or otherwise emotionally excited chimpanzee. The chimpanzee that executes the punishment will usually cool down after a while and will give solace to the punished individual. Such are in practice the prototypes of rewards and punishments. 2.2. Protonorms of possession Jane van Lawick-Goodall as well as some other fxeld researchers observed among some individuáis of the higher apes an incipient feeling of possession. The chimpanzees manifested this feeling in respect to some objects considered by them as tools, as toys, as a resuit of successful hunting (meat), and to some found objects, to their own self-built nests (although built only for one night). These were phenomena of routine. It happened even that an object appreciated as a useless one was returned. In one instance a female chimpanzee returned an egg to the generous "white ape" and in another a mountain gorilla got rid of unwanted paper and pencil in the same gentle way. ( J. van Lawick Goodall 1983,136 ff.; M. Gruter 1983,236 ff.) In the investigated chimpanzee group a tangible sense of possessing a common territory could be observed. The boundaries of their valley were almost systematically patrolled and "visitors" (chimpanzees from other groups) selectively admitted. Mothers treat children (until 8) as their property, deciding who is allowed to have contact with them. Apes living in monogamy treat females as their property, too (J. van Lawick-Goodall, supra). Llewllyn puts forward a more generalized hypothesis that property emerged as a resuit of the domination of the stronger over the weaker (1977). 2.3. Protonorms of penal reprisais This kind of reprisais is directly executed by the interested or challenged themselves. Encroachment on the established hierarchy is punished immediately by the individual whose position was infringed. Encroachment on any kind of possesion triggers the same effect. But there are also other kinds of reprisais conditioned by "family" or friendship ties. Penal reprisais (sanctions) were observed in cases of trespassing on the group territory. When van Lawick-Goodall at the very beginning of her field studies tried to approach the chimpanzees, they fîrst vanished silently, then signaled their dislike for any contact with the "white ape"—by hostile sounds. Finally annoyed by her insistence they surrounded her and she was painfully beaten up. But not hurt, because she humbly accepted the punishment — like any female or low-grade adult chimpanzee. Thus she signaled that she knew and accepted (a chimpanzee sociologist would say: internalized) their patterns of behaviour. And so began a process of gaining the confidence of the chimpanzee group in the Gombe Valley. Enlightening was also the observation of rare cases of cannibalism among the chimpanzees. It happened that uninterested adult maies alarmed by an endangered</page><page sequence="7">Protonorms - On the Biological Roots of Social Norms 89 mother to whom they had no des whatsoever (they simply roamed nearby) threatened a team of two recidivists (mother and daughter) eannibals and chased them away. (J. van Lawick-Goodall 1983,139 ff.; comp, too J. Itani 1983,143—157) 3. Technical protonorms The use of a stone or a stick as a tool for defence, and, less ffequently, for hunting, is very common among chimpanzees. However, it is not the instinctive use of such tools that our discussion is going to focus upon: the really significant thing is that chimpanzees deliberately adapt such primitive tools. Both the adaptation and use of those tools require much dexterity, which the young chimpanzees acquire through observation and lear ning. It takes them a long time to learn how to make a twig nest in a tree, or how to gather and prepare enough grass stems or sticks to sit over a termite mound "fishing" for the insects. In those activities, adults are accompanied by youngsters who watch and learn the ways of their eiders — and they also learn patience. The ability to learn and assimilate the experience of others goes a long way to explain the flexibility of primate behaviour. A field-researcher has observed how a successful hunt for a gazelle launched by a single baboon led to the whole troop of baboons adopting hunting and prédation as part of their way of living. Having found eggs in the researchers ' camp, the chimpanzees went on to make a gastronomie innovation and ate the eggs with a "salad" of specially prepared leaves. Van Lawick-Goodall made the discovery that flesh-eating is not a sporadic pheno menon with the chimpanzees, but that like man they are Carnivorous and they hunt regularly; it also turned out that they consume their prey in various ways. In order to get to the brain of a young baboon he has caught, a chimpanzee might use a small stone to crush the baboon's skull. He would use a slighüy bigger stone to break open a palm nut kernel. A stick of requisite length allows chimpanzees to pilfer honeycombs in such a way so as not be stung by wild bees. Sticks of various sizes were used by the chimpanzees, after the necessary trials and adaptations, as crow-bars and levers, which were especially helpful when the object was to pry open the boxes in which the "white apes" had so inefficiently tried to hide from them their favourite treat — bananas. All these and other similar technical activities observed were always purposeful in nature and always executed in a similar manner; their répétition was due to some rule of conduct which the chimpanzees had internalized and were then able to transmit to younger, inexperienced individuáis. These technical protonorms led to the emergence of a stable store of technical knowledge handed down to the offspring. The chimps' primitive tools stand in close technical relation to those developed by stone age man. However, man has been able to cross the threshold that still remains unattainable for chimpanzees: he has not only made tools, but also has used them to make new ones. The first tool produced with the help of another, more primitive one, widened man's horizons to include more far-reaching aims. It was the beginning of the process of freeing himself of the biological bonds, the first step of Homo sapiens on the path towards subjecting nature to himself. It had to be accompanied by regulators, the ever more diversifying technical norms aimed at the safety and efficiency of action.</page><page sequence="8">90 Stanislaw Ehrlich 4. Protonorms ofhierarchy Van Lawick-Goodall's observations have confirmed the existence of a strict hierarchy within chimpanzee communities. This hierarchy is topped by a dominant male, to whom all other individuáis have been subordinated, in various circumstances, by showing "respect" and readiness to submit. They give way, for instance, when a dominant male rushes for the fruit trees, they step aside when they meet him on a narrow path. Lower ranking individuáis respond with submission to aggressive behaviour on the part of individuáis higher up the social scale — this is especially true of females. This established hierarchy forebodes the relation of dominance which sometimes entails meddling into quarreis of one of lower ranking. (M. Gruter, 1983, II, 2) "In his dealings with the higher-ranking males, the adolescent must be cautious for now, more than when he was a mere juvenile, the act of insubordination is likely to bring severe rétribution." (pp. 174 and 117—119) "William ... was one of the more subordinate males in his relationships with the other chimpanzees. If another adult male showed signs of aggression towards him, William was quick to approach with gestures of appeasement and submission . . ." (pp. 77) The function of the dominant male is of an "honorary" nature, which means that he does not have a monopoly on initiative conceming the group's movements, nor does he have privileged access to the most attractive females; he does enjoy, however, priority of access to "consumer goods". But even in this domain exceptions have been noted — they will be discussed further on. The hierarchy within the chimpanzee Community is established through displays of skill ("charging displays"), which erupt spontaneously on various occasions, for instance when the gruop expresses its joy at arriving in a place abounding with fruit, or otherwise they are initiated by an individual in the right mood for them, with other chimpanzees following his example. Displays can also be sparked off by a rainstorm (the display is a "rain dance" then). Those impetuous collective displays are performed in a kind of ffenzied trance, as if in amok. A displaying individual may even hurt and drag along with him an infant or a nursing mother. Thus when a display begins, all weaker individuáis get out of the way of the displaying males. In principie, however, the chimpanzees taking part in a display keep within fixed bounds of behaviour, which makes the displays acquire a seemingly ritual character. A display may also be meant as a delibérate challenge thrown down by one of the adolescent males with a view to changing the established hierarchy in his favour. In these exclusively male contests of prowess and dexterity what matters is to "show off'. Females never take part in the displays. Hierarchy among females is determined on grounds of age and maternity, supported by the solidarity of blood ties, and, in the case of conflict, also by strength and agility. The subordination of females to males does not apply to all ranks, it is moderated by two factors: the inferior position of the male in the social hierarchy, and kinship, with the special role of the mother. But even that is no protection against the wilfulness of the dominant male, who can even drive a mother from her carefully prepared nest. This is something no lower-ranking male would dare to emulate. The hierarchical structure of the chimpanzee group is not rigid, there are exceptions to it and it undergoes periodic adjustments. Exceptions in the dominance system are due to ties of friendship based on the "reciprocity norm". When, for instance, Greybeard ventured to make contact with humans, from which he began to profit by receiving regular portions of bananas, this was noticed by Goliath (the dominant male). He could</page><page sequence="9">Protonorms - On the Biological Roots of Social Norms 91 not, however, muster enough courage to make his own contact with the "white ape", so he "begged" Greybeard for the bananas, though he could easily have taken them away from him. The ties of a longstanding fiiendship restrained his urge to use force, and for this he received a reward. Another exception from the hierarchy is the rule, frequently noted by Jane van Lawick-Goodall, according to which the prey is at the exclusive disposai of the individual that has caught it (irrespective of whether it is a small baboon or another monkey, a bushpig or a bushbuck). Even the dominant male will not attempt to take the prey away by force, but instead he will beg for a share with a lower-ranking male. Such "prestige" concessions are of incident nature and do not lead to undermining the established hierarchy. With regard to such inconsistent behaviour van Lawick-Goodall makes the follo wing hypothesis: "Meat is a much-liked, much-prized food item. An adult male in possession of such a prize may become more Willing to fight for it and, therefore, less nervous of his superiors, than if he has a pile of everyday fruits like bananas. Indeed in support of this theory, I should emphasize that in the early day s of feeding, when bananas themselves were something of a novelty, the chimps very seldom did fight over the fruits. And what of the lack of aggression in the more dominant maies? Possibly, when they fail to detect those signais of appréhension which normally characterize their interac tions with subordinates and, instead, meet very definite aggressive signais, they may feel hésitant in asserting their normal prérogatives. This may be true of sexual behaviour too—it may be the reason why adult maies do not normally fight for the privilège of mating with an attractive female but, instead, await their tum. Perhaps the maie about to mount may, likewise, be prepared to defend his sexual rights to the act of reproduction." (p. 199) The established hierarchy, however, may be upset by an intelligent and daring "usurper", even one with a very low social rank at the time of his "coup". Such a remarkable incident was registered on film and well documented by Jane van Lawick Goodall. It must be explained at this point that the male displays always included wild charges during which a chimpanzee would run blindly dragging a tree branch or rolling a huge stone in front of him, ail this accompanied by loud hoot-panting. When the chimpanzees got used to the presence of the human camp they began to make use, in those charging displays, of empty paraffin cans they found in the camp. One day Goliath, the dominant maie, and two of his friends started grooming each other during the siesta. About thirty métrés away, observing the group and manipulating some cans, was Mike, a chimpanzee whose rank Jane von Lawick-Goodall had assessed as middling. Suddenly Mike started working himself into a trance and he charged at the resting group. Holding the paraffin cans in his hands and beating them together to make an impressive noise, he ran straight towards the relaxing three maies. Surprised by his charge, the chimpanzees fled away in panic, but soon calmly retumed to their siesta. Meanwhile Mike, who stopped at a distance, charged again and once more the three maies, including the dominant Goliath, lost their nerve and rushed out of way. Mike sealed his victory by chasing the three amid noisy pant-hoots. Mike's dominant role was later Consolidated and attempts made by Goliath to regain his top-ranking position ended in failure. It was only after a long time that Mike's supremacy was challenged by younger maies who had achieved füll maturity. The really amazing fact about the struggle for dominance is that it involves no direct use of force, as may be the case on other occasions such as punishing a lower-ranking individual, especially a youngster or a female.</page><page sequence="10">92 Stanislaw Ehrlich 5. Relations with aliens and the identity ofthe chipmanzee group (Boundary protonorms) Many years of observations by Jane van Lawick-Goodall and her research station have shown the group of chimpanzees under investigation to vary in their behaviour towards the three neighboring populations: other groups of chimpanzees, baboons and humans. Mutual visits by individuáis, or small groups of chimpanzees to neighbouring chimpan zee communities are quite fréquent and, apart from sporadic fighting between jealous females in heat, usually friendly in nature. In some cases, however, the chimpanzees remained aloof and apprehensive, and with pant-hoots announcing the arrivai of visitors some of the hosts would discreetly withdraw. (P. H. Klopfer, 1969) The relationships between a group of chimpanzees and a troop of baboons (a terminological distinction consistently used by van Lawick-Goodall to signal the différence in their respective levels of development) are more complex and oscillate between playing together and aggression. Juvenile baboons and chimps play together in perfect harmony as a matter of course. The relationships between adult chimpanzees and baboons, however, look quite différent—they are characterized by what could be called alert neutrality. Clashes are avoided and this is helped by the incidence nature of meetings between members of the two species. However, when such meetings do occur, fights and squabbles often fiare up. Düring such events it is only the chimpanzees that literally "take up arms": they often throw stones, but no case of serious injury was ever noted. The confict usually boiled down to threat and bluff (p. 206). Such a character of conflicts is in no way contradicted by the fréquent hunts for younger individuáis of the other species — this is explained by the need to satisfy their hunger for protein, as both species are partly carnivorous. This last fact, incidentally, first reported by van Lawick Goodall, was at the time received as a startling biological discovery, for it undermined the view held by K. Lorenz and others that the aggressiveness of hominids was due to their turning carnivorous, which contrasted with the herbivorous eating habits of the apes, claimed to account for the lack of aggressiveness in the latter. The attitude of the studied group of chimpanzees towards people, whom they had first met in the tropical jungle and then in the camp, developed from aggressive hostility in the first encounters to distrust in the later ones. It was only after they had gained some experience of the humans, and especially after the humans received a kind of "recom mendation" from the old and well-liked male Greybeard, that the chimpanzees' attitude towards Jane van Lawick-Goodall and her co-workers at the research station grew more friendly. To conclude, we can describe the chimpanzee group as relatively open with tolerant protonorms enabling it to preserve group identity, which is also helped by the stability of group membership. Groups of chimpanzees do not intermix and any changes within them are brought about only by biological development. On the other hand, contacts outside the group allow the Community to expand its store of experience. Such contacts also stem from the chimpanzees' intrinsic curiosity. This feature is likely to be one they share with the "missing link" of anthropoid apes and then humans. Van Lawick-Goodall's research shows that contact with people led the stable chimpanzee Community to develop new rules of behaviour (protonorms). There also emerged new forms of interaction between the human newcomers and the chimpanzees. I think there is reasonable ground to generalize on these observations. Investigators of baboon behaviour have noticed that those baboon troops that left the forest for good and</page><page sequence="11">Protonorms ~ On the Biological Roots of Social Norms 93 roamed the open savanna had to change their loose social structure into a more rigid one because they were faced with a greater threat of predators in the new habitat. It was observed that while most of the troop would engage in gathering, every baboon in six stood on guard at appropriate intervais. (E. Leakey, R. Lewin 1977, ch. 4,8) Itcould thus be said that a tendency towards socialization (and consequently the establishment of stable pattems of behaviour) grows whenever this becomes an evolutionary asset, being conducive to the development of the species. At any rate it seems that that without the functioning of these boundary-patterns of behaviour it would be impossible either to preserve the group from outside or to maintain its inner order, and even its survival. 6. Recapitulation and conclusions Despite its fragmentary nature the analysis of protonorms that I have undertaken makes it possible to address a number of issues which have attracted much interdisciplinary interest over the last 15—20 years. Provided one accepts the concept of protonorms itself, it becomes evident that the evolutionary path leading from various forms of communal life among higher primates through those of différent hominids, and from there to the first human communities (i.e. communities of Homo sapiens), must have been a path of increasing scope and diversity of norm-governed behaviour, leading up to the development of a normative System. The complexity of that System reflects the complexity of the organizations within which this particular kind of communicative system operates. The formation of norm-complexes is likely to have begun as early as the paleolithic, and there is reliable evidence of such processes for cultures of early neolithic Settlements, (cf. D. Srejovic, 1972) It is highly probable that the proximity and interaction between higher primates (above all, chimpanzees and baboons), hominids and the first human communities was a factor in expanding the scope of normative régulation, which must have been accompanied by the gradual rooting of a primitive verbal means of communication and the gradual prevailing of language over non-verbal communication. This emphasis on the continuity of development in the area of norm establishment (from the protonorms of higher primates, hominids and first human communities) seems indispensable for a proper understanding of the complex of issues relating to the régulation of social behaviour through norms. There still remain, in this evolutionary process, a number of questions which have not yet been fully explained — they centre round the "missing link", which means that they are concerned with transformation taking place over the enormous time span of milions of years. However, thanks to the penetrating and ingenious research in biology, ethology, paleanthropology, paleoarcheology and bio chemistry we can roughly recréate the vast stages of transformations that led to the formation of first communities, and later— settled societies. According to current communis opinio doctorum of those sciences the eradle of hominids is to be found in the région of the great lakes of Central Africa, from where the various groups of hominids spread, through the Afro-Asian isthmus, to all parts of the globe. (Leakey, Lewin 1977, ch. 5) The groups of Homo erectus involved in this slow exodus numbered no more than several score bipedal individuáis. Homo erectus was quite well adapted to the first stages of conquering the earch. His hands, freed from the task of locomotion, enabled him to make fire; a bonfire in turn offered protection and facilitated socialization, just as the making of first tools out of stone, bone and wood favoured the process of imitating and learning, Consolidated and embodied in the first</page><page sequence="12">94 Stanislaw Ehrlich teçhnical norms. The first great division of labour into hunting and gathering was taking place, with men becoming hunters and women gatherers. This sex-based division of labour was a very rigorous one, although periodic exceptions were allowed. In order to be effective, the activities of hunters and gatherers had to be regulated by norms; the same applied to the division of the food procured. The group's progress was also governed by rules as it required Organization (with a leader and scouts) as well as the provision of the means of transport (sacks, baskets, etc.). This diversification of norms was accompanied by the advent of speech. This is how, eventually, the wall that separates man ffom anthropoid apes and the rest of the living world came into being. This was an age of great coopération, coopération that prevailed over conflict. Without it Homo sapiens would not have achieved the remarkable success of penetrating all the concerns of the earth. (Comp. L. S. B. Leakey, J. van Lawick-Goodall, V. Morris (1969); M. A. Edey (1972); A. Jolly (1972); Y. Bronowski (1974)). It was only permanent seulement, the invention of agriculture (some ten thousand years ago) and the conséquent need to defend one's territory that brought intergroup conflict into foreground. Settled life, the prominence given to agriculture and the ensuing decline in the economic value of hunting and gathering were reflected and strengthened by new complexes of norms of behaviour. This cannot but have destroyed the previous life style which had subsisted for the preceding three million years (Leakey, Lewin, 1977, ch. 6). These developments laid the foundations for the spread of trade and handicraft; cities could emerge — and this is already prehistory, marked by a diversity of normative Systems necessitated by the growing complexity of social structure, and the densening web of social networks. Soon, writing was to appear, and with it the first written normative acts — lasting documents of culture. The rough outline of man's évolution given above points clearly to the process of his going away ffom his biological origins. In this departure norms played a very significant role, as they "disciplined" man in his behaviour. Purposeful activity formed an ever greater part of his life, and to an ever greater degree such activity began to transform the natural environment, creating, for whatever the aim of the purposeful activity, a new, social environment — an artificial, man-made environment. Between the range of instinctive behaviour characterized by an automatic reaction to Stimuli (typical for some insect "societies" and vertebrates below primates) and the range of intended behaviour (which includes the création of protonorms) évolution erected a distinct threshold, (comp. B. J. Bonner (1980); D. R. Griffin (1981); M. Gruter (1983), beyond which emerged the "rule making man". (H. Markl (1983), 68) As centuries went by the two environments began to form a unity. All this was part of a process in which mankind liberated itself ffom the bondage of instinct and the dictâtes of biological laws, and a crucial role was played by the establishment of norms. Norms provided answers to three questions: 1. How to behave in a given group? 2. According to whose decisión?, and, 3. What is that decisión "reinforced" by?, i.e. what reward can be expected for complying with the norm and what punishment would follow for its violation. The establishment and opération of norms is indicative of the attainment of a stage of évolution characterized by a new form of socialization — namely, norm govemed socialization. The hypothesis of a norm-setting continuity approximately 50,000 years ago (W. Wickler, 1971) presented here does not entail taking a stand in the debate on biosociology in all its différent guises. To do so would go beyond the purpose of this analysis. I will therefore confine myself to a very brief présentation of just some of the</page><page sequence="13">Protonorms -- On the Biological Roots of Social Norms 95 points in the dispute, and will refer all those interested (and disappointed) to the relevant items of the bibliography. The greedy ambition of some sociobiologists to reduce the role of social sciences stands in contrast to an interdisciplinary research orientation. E. O. Wilson, in particular, taking as his starting point the fruitful interaction of biology and biochemistry proposes the blending of biology and social sciences. In one of his works Wilson regards social sciences and humanities as specialized branches of biology (1975, p. 547). Here a side-remark would be worthwhile to note: On the opposite pole to this Standpoint we have to register the anti-evolutionary and anti-historical bias in anthropo logy and sociology, especially the functionalism espoused by B. Malinowski, Radcliffe Brown and Talcott Parsons. This has been pointed out in A. E. Hoebel, 1983, p. 40 ff.; A. M. Karinskij, 1984, p. 11 ; and M. Veuille, 1986, p. 93. Wilson explains his Standpoint by postulating methodological reductionism, although with the qualification that this should not be "raw reductionism" (E. O. Wilson, 1978, pp. 10—13). Social biology in this sense would be tantamount to an "anti-science" of social sciences. It is for that reason that I consider it proper to ascribe the further course of cultural development (over a period of stretching from the Ice Age to the emergence of the first city-states of Sumer) to "cultural rather than genetic évolution". If we were to agree that the proportion of cultural to genetic factors in that évolution remains an open question, with the growing accélération of cultural évolution being established beyond any doubt, then it would be possible, within the above limits, to accept the findings of sociobiology (cf. A. Urbanek, 1984). But in fact that is only a starting point, one which gives rise to a line of thought—in my opinion—quite unjustified front a scientific point of view. I will stop to consider just one of sociobiology's propositions — the one presupposing man's innate aggressiveness. This proposition, propounded by many eminent sociobiologists, is nothing less but a return to biological determinism and its unwarranted grafting onto the social sciences. The alleged hereditary human prédispo sition to behave in an aggressive way, which is related to the calculable probability of its emergence in specified environmental conditions, is supposed to be corroborated by the exceptional nature of the peaceful behaviour found in small communities, which are a minority in the global scale. (E. O. Wilson, 1978) This view is also held by the ethologists N. Tinbergen and K. Lorenz, as well as some others (cf. A. Storr); it is shared too by some sociologists (L. Ellis, 1977) and philosophers (E. Fromm, 1975). Regarding aggressiveness as a constant of human behaviour they openly, and excessively, "biologize" the latter. None of the analogies of insect communities, the mating rituals of birds, the territorial instinct of various species, the struggle for sexual primacy in the herd, the elabórate ways of communicating used by hunting lions, wolves or dingoes, nor the analogies with chimpanzee protonorms (if my conception were to be accepted), can be of any direct utility for the analysis of behaviour in social groups and especially in microorganizations. Man — the maker of fire, the maker of tools by means of which he learnt to make new and better ones, the creator of speech and symbolic Systems—has created an impenetrable barrier, or a high threshold, between himself and the animal world. This is how A. Kloskowska has written about it: "We recognize the existence between man and animal not of an abyss, but some kind of threshold." (1984, p. 51) By moving away from it, at an accelerated pace, man has increased his adaptive capacity and weakened his links with the animal world. A. Rappoport has said that where cultural évolution is concerned the environmentally conditioned control mechanisms of biological processes cease to opérate. (1974, p. 76) For he understands cultural environment as a man-made environment.</page><page sequence="14">96 Stanislaw Ehrlich In a similar spirit H. Markl expresses his Standpoint: Nature seems to influence human behaviour rather by proposais of choice (Vorschläge) than by prescriptions. And he continues: Thus far we are lacking data to substantiate the biological détermination of norms. We always detect a distinct tendency in human beings to create norms, to expect and to implement them. And this entails freedom of choice within the limits of patterned behaviour. If one reflects on a "programmed" man (I. Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1976, 276 ff.) one has at any rate to take into considération that man as a social being is under the influence of a double evolutionary process: a biological one, which in the course of time is losing momentum and weakening, and a natural one. The input of the latter is immensely growing in intensity. Even disregarding the question of peaceful coopération among higher primates (and especially the ease with which they settle conflicts), one cannot overlook the importance of the fact that the background to intergroup and intersocietal aggressiveness is cultural and so is the background to the long periods of peaceful tolerance. The genocide of Latin American Indians occurred as a resuit of a historically testifiedregal order: bring as much gold as possible, and not because the conquistadora followed the dictate of their genes. The centuries-long religious tolerance in Poland (contrasting with the generally accepted religious-political practice in the rest of Europe), and the recent unprecedented process of universal disarmament, emerging as an effective check on mankind's urge to self destruction, and likely to lead to a fundamental transformation in the current internatio nal normative System. This would résolve the antinomy between the idea of peace and the "inate" human aggressiveness (cf. A. Mitscherlich, 1969), gives the lie to the "linear" concept of the innate agressiveness of man. Meanwhile, E. O. Wilson, in both of the works quoted, puts forward the principie of a "genetic leash", which is supposed to constrain man. This is a misunderetanding. A "genetic leash" is a constraint on the décisions of an individual when the individual takes them in that capacity; it may also affect, to some extent, décisions made within the nuclear family (thus its influence is temporarily restricted). The more complex the Organization (and the larger the collective cultural contribution to it) in which an individual plays a norm-regulated role, the smaller is the impact of the "genetic leash". The "leash" is extremely flexible and tensile: the longer the duration of mankind's cultural development and the faster the pace of transformations, the weaker the impact ofthis "leash" on decision-making. Where are we to look for this "leash": in the décisions of governments, or the investment décisions of corporate boards of directora, or the décisions of other complex organizations? This is how the programmatic ahistoricism of ethologists and sociobiologists takes its revenge. They gave their earnest attention to the history of animal species but they underestimated the importance of transformations within human communities. Theories in which the meaning of the genetic connection in the évolution of the ever more complex human societies is blown out of all proportion are difficult to prove and easy to refute. E. Leakey and R. Lewin have put forward a number of salient arguments against extending the biological analogies over to social processes — these can be summarized as follows: (i) No doctrine of man's innate nature can be proved, (ii) the theoiy of man's innate aggressiveness is not coiroborated by studies of human behaviour, (iii) research on Homo sapiens shows that this has been a créature more inclined towards coopération rather than aggression. They recapitúlate by saying that (iv) cultural conditioning is a force far more powerful than all biological tendencies dormant in our genes (1977, ch. 9). It seems that a more moderate stance, i.e. that sociobiology helps to underatand the</page><page sequence="15">Protonorms -- On the Biological Roots of Social Norms 97 différences between man and animal (R. D. Masters, 1983, 22) is more convincing. Among Polish writers on the subject, the "exaltation" of sociobiology has met with major criticism by J. H. Kunicki-Goldfinger (1984). (A more conciliatory stand on sociobio logy has been taken by A. Urbanek (1984, p. 155 ff.) but even he qualifies it by writing that "... the basic tenets of Darwinian theory presumably cannot have a füll application in the case of the social évolution of man." (p. 180, cf. also p. 183—187)) Here are some of the more pertinent fragments of his book: "Thanks to his brain, man has developed supra-genetic paths of variability and inheritance . . . The result of this supragenetic inheritance is culture. It evolves out of the cumulative learning how to transmit acquired culture traits from one génération to another, and the diffusion of those traits among the individuáis within a population and between human populations." Kunicki-Goldfinger stresses that the transmission of features by genetic Systems is slow, while the transmis sion of cultural features and their diffusion may be very fast indeed. He further writes: " A peculiar property of man as an animal is his fantastically well developed ability to use symbols, a capacity for symbolic thought, for modelling the perceived reality in symbolic structures ... Reducing social sciences to biology is even less realistic than reducing biology to chemistry and physics... Biology can probably help social sciences in determining the scope of genetically conditioned possibilities and studying the existing constraints" (pp. 224—228). This concurs with C. H. Waddington's (1971, 39—40) position. "Man has not escaped from the pressures of biological evolutionary processes dépendent on natural sélection of genes. But it has added to these a new dimension of évolution based on cultural transmission. This is incomparably more rapid in its opération, and dominâtes our whole area of his positive advances... (F. Jacob, 1982,43). The training of the new born human individual to realize that certain sounds and sights are symbols occurs in conjunction with another lesson he must learn at this time — namely to behave as a member of his social group. The newly born human baby must be an almost pure solipsist, scarcely able to distinguish seif from not-self, and with no awareness that there are other people to whose lives and wishes it must accomodate its own. Into this indiviualistic, solipsistic paradise there burst simultaneously socially acepted symbols (language) and socially accepted norms of behavior. Essentially the baby learns to become part of the socially transmitting Community by hearing its parents or others saying "No!"" This is very much in line with the well-known Standpoint taken by the co-founder of the general theory of Systems, L. v. Bertalanffy (cf. Bertalanffy 1984) who treats man as a creator of symbols, dominated by symbols. It seems that the excessive profusion of genetic determinism in some of sociobiolo gy's propositions would not be there had the founders of sociobiology extended their collaboration to include représentatives of the social sciences. They might then have not overlooked the necessity of either the need to analyze the conséquences of the accele rated cultural évolution of societies or the role within it of norms and normative Systems, transforming, when they are effective, the behaviour of man. For at the beginning of mankind was the word, but at the beginning of humanity was the norm. Author's Address: Prof. Dr. Stanislaw Ehrlich, Universytetu Warszawskiego, ul. J.
