<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORTS FOR 1966-67 ARCHAEOLOGY IN SOUTH ITALY AND SICILY, 1964-66 The past triennium has seen no diminution either in archaeological activities in South Italy and Sicily' or in the volume of material published. A useful and well-illustrated general survey of the main Greek sites in South Italy will be found in Alberto Fiori, Le cittd della Magna Graecia (Rome, 1965); it will be followed shortly by a volume on Sicily. Italiote pottery has received considerable attention, and several major works dealing with this field have appeared recently.2 The annual Congresses at Taranto devoted to the study of different aspects of Magna Graecia have continued to be held, with increasing success, and have resulted in a series of most valuable publications.3 The University of Naples has set up a Study Centre for Magna Graecia, and it has sponsored a series of monographs under the general title 'Monumenti antichi della Magna Grecia', the first of which, La pitturafuneraria apula, by Fernanda Tine Bertocchi appeared in 1964, followed a year later by Lidia Forti's La Ceramica di Gnathia. Four issues of a news bulletin, Magna Graecia, directed by Tanino de Santis, have so far been published, giving accounts of recent excavations and discoveries, especially in Calabria. New museums and antiquaria continue to spring up (e.g. Nocera, Avellino, Benevento, Metaponto, Locri, Agrigento); old ones have been enlarged or re- organised to improve the display of their collections, which have often been greatly increased as a result of new material from recent excavations (e.g. Taranto, Potenza, Matera, Foggia). Useful information about the latest archaeological discoveries and museum developments is given in the Notiziario, which has now become a regular feature of the Bollettino d'Arte (xlix, 1964, 360 ff.; 1, 1965, 105 ff.). SOUTH ITALY Campania.4 Thanks to recent discoveries in this province our concept of Villanovan civilisation has been extended a considerable distance south of Etruria.5 Excavations at a number of sites, e.g. Cales, Capua, Oliveto Citra and Pontecagnano,6 have produced a sequence of material, with a wide dis- tribution of affinities in Etruria, that continues without a break from the typical biconical ossuaries down to Orientalizing and the subsequent Etruscan period, i.e. from the ninth to the fifth centuries B.C. Though there are understandable influences from the indigenous 'Fossakultur', the similarities with Etruria suggest a degree of close and continuous contact that could well have been maintained by traffic up and down the Liri and Sacco valleys; early affinities with Latium and the Alban Hills have also been noted. Johannowski mentions the presence at Capua and Suessula of 'Cycladic cups' similar to those found in two prehellenic tombs at Cumae.7 The shape was imitated widely in Etruria, but hitherto it has not been possible to recognise more than a few actual imports there.8 Now, however, excavations carried out by the British School at Rome, in collaboration 1 For assistance in the preparation of this Report and for the supply of information and photographs I am deeply indebted to the following: Drs A.

For a summary of these two congresses see Klearchos xxiii-xxiv (1964) 96-105. The fifth Congress (1965) was devoted to 'Scuole e cultura'; the sixth (1966) to art and literature. It was accompanied by an ex- cellent display of photographs and original works of art illus- trating the Homeric legends, Greek drama, and phlyax plays, many of which are published in the exhibition catalogue, Letteratura e artefigurata nella Magna Grecia. A similar publication, prepared in 1965 for the 8th Italian Museum week, was devoted to ancient Egnazia and gives useful pictures of the site and of typical examples of Gnathian pottery. 4 For a general survey of this province, with some reference to the archaeological and historical background, see D.

I with the Institute of Etruscology of the University of Rome, in the 'Quattro Fontanili' cemetery at Veii, the most southerly of the great Villanovan centres of Etruria, have produced to date six such skyphoi9 (Fig. I), of which five are surely imported: they are precisely similar to those from Cumae both in shape and in the chevron decoration. An interim discussion of the Quattro Fontanili material,10 based on association tables of the grave- groups, shows a horizontal distribution, or growth of the cemetery outwards from the centre, with a chronological validity: the two principal divisions at Quattro Fontanili correspond to Pallottino's Facies I and II, with a further division of II into IIA and IIB. In IIA there is a sudden increase in the use of iron and of metal in general-in sharp contrast with I, where iron is rare and the use of bronze is much more utilitarian. The new metal objects of IIA are accompanied by various exotica, and by the imported 'Cycladic' chevron-skyphoi, the form of which is soon imitated in IIB. The associa- tion of these earliest Greek vases in the West with an increased awareness of metal must be connected with the foundation of Pithecusa and Cumae; the presence of iron foundries at Pithecusa has now been put beyond reasonable doubt by Dr G. Buchner's discovery" in the ancient rubbish dump on the acropolis of that site of a fair quantity of iron slag, two bottoms of pots which had served as crucibles, and several fragments of bellows-mouthpieces in terracotta. There is no source of iron nearer than Etruria and Elba, and the new evidence gives strong support to Dunbabin's theory12 that Cumae (in 1948 still the earliest known Greek colony in the west) owed its existence to interest in the metals of Etruria. Blakeway's concept of 'pre-colonial trade' is now replaced by a not dissimilar picture of Euboean or Euboeo-Cycladic trade with the West"3 that is 'para-colonial' in the sense that it is likely to have been the raison d'dtre of the two earliest foundations (both Euboean), sited as they are in the most northerly corner of Magna Graecia. Much other material of interest and importance has come to light as a result of the excavations at Pithecusa on the island of Ischia, sponsored since 1965 by the Pennsylvania University Museum in close collaboration with the Soprintendenza alle Antichith of Naples, and recently published by Buchner in Expedition (viii, 4, 1966). The campaigns of 1965-66 opened up a further 184 tombs in the necropolis, mostly of the eighth and seventh centuries B.C., bringing the total to date to 914. The finds from the new tombs complete and enlarge the material previously excavated on that site and include a further 25 seals of the Lyre-player Group,14 some of which show new varieties of decorative motifs. On the east slope of the acropolis (Monte di Vico) an ancient dump filling a drainage channel yielded an extraordinary quantity of unstratified material ranging in date from the Appennine bronze age of the fourteenth century B.C. to second-century black- glaze ware. The main bulk of the Greek pottery belonged to the eighth and seventh centuries and complements the finds from the graves: it included many fragments of large Geometric kraters and amphorae, some with representations of men, horses and birds (Fig. 2), which are absent from the graves, as well as imported Corinthian Geometric and early Protocorinthian. Four more fragments bearing graffiti were found, confirming that knowledge of writing was well established by the last quarter of the eighth century, and a remarkable Geometric seal-impression depicting Ajax carrying the body of Achilles,15 which is of interest for its connexion with the cyclic poems. There is also a very archaic antefix, decorated only with paint and without relief, certainly of the seventh century. 9 NSc 1963, 166, fig. 59a; 175, fig. 64; 271, fig. 132a-b (FF 16-17); 192, fig. 76 (GG 16-17) ;NSc 1965, 93, fig. 27 (EE 14-15) ; Io8, fig. 36 (FF 14-I5); 23I1, fig.

It appears to have been a votive deposit, a shallow pit filled with black earth, containing a great deal of material, all burnt, which included figurines of horses and mules, models of chariots (Fig. 3) and boats, fragments of a krater with plastic figures of mourning women on the rim, and pottery, partly local and partly Transitional and Early Corinthian, dated by Professor D. A. Amyx between 635 and 620. In the vicinity of the pit was found an archaic sima from a small shrine, with waterspouts in the shape of ram's heads, probably late seventh or early sixth century. lyres, another with a scroll, and Eros, (b) three draped youths, (2) a squat lekythos in the fine style showing Eros and women, and (3) a skyphos with Nike, a youth with a helmet, and a woman on each side; a panathenaic amphora by the Amykos Painter (LCS, p. 698, no. 219b); a skyphos of the Saint Valentin class, and a good deal of plain black ware. Tomb 64 from the later fourth century contained a Campanian oenochoe of the AV Group along with local and black wares; Tomb 19 a number of terra- cotta statuettes together with pottery decorated with triangular patterns in added red and pastel blue, not unlike some of the later vases from Lipari.16 Men- tion may perhaps here be made of the Museo dell'Agro Nocerino in the fourteenth-century convent of S. Antonio at Nocera Inferiore; it was opened in July 1965 and houses the Pisani collection, which is of con- siderable importance for the study of the prehistory of the Sarno valley, together with the material from the 1957 and subsequent excavations at Nocera Superiore. Another interest- ing museum recently (December 1966) opened in this area is the Museo Irpino at Avellino, which houses the Zigarelli collection of archaeological material from Irpinia, as well as a wide range of objects from neolithic to Roman times from excavations at La Starza, Madonna delle Grazie (Mirabella Eclano), Cairano, Calitri, etc., and from the sanctuary of Mephitis in the Valle d'Ansanto, among which some statues in wood (xoana) from the late sixth and early fifth centuries are of particular interest. At Montesarchio near Benevento ex- cavations are in progress in what promises to be a large necropolis 16 Cf. Meligunis-Lipdra ii, pls. 111.2 and 125.4- FIG. 2 The excavations at Pontecagnano, some 7 miles south of Salerno, have since 1962 brought to light over 900 tombs in a large necropolis which extends from the ninth to the fourth centuries B.c. In addition to the typical Villanovan pottery referred to above, there is a good deal of material from the Orientalizing period, especially Protocorinthian and Corinthian, and some imported Attic black-figure of the later sixth century; very little from the fifth century has yet been dis- covered, but in the fourth, Paestan pottery, mostly from the workshop of Asteas and Python, is well represented. At Nocera Superiore recent excavations have revealed a number of tombs ranging from the sixth to the fourth century B.c. The earlier burials are accom- panied by bucchero, b.f. lekythoi, and plain black ware; Tomb 21, which is a good example of a late fifth century grave and is of considerable chrono- logical interest, contained three Attic r.f. vases (I) a large bell-krater with (a) three women holding FIG. 3</page><page sequence="4">32 A. D. TRENDALL At Paestum the excavations of 1964 in the Contrada Linora brought to light a few Greek vases, of which the most interesting is a strainer decorated in b.f. with komasts similar in style to those on the b.f. vase in the Louvre (MNB 2042) attributed to Douris (ABV 400), and a number of typical minor Paestan vases from the workshop of Asteas and Python. A tomb in the Localita' Fonte, some nine miles to the north-east, the contents of which were unfortunately very badly damaged, yielded some thirty vases, mostly plain black ware but with some r.f., including a large volute- krater, perhaps by Asteas himself, re- presenting the Judgment of Paris, a popular subject at Paestum, where the r6le of Hera is often stressed. The vase stood upon a moulded base decorated with vine-leaves and is the only extant example of this particular shape from that period at Paestum. FIG. 4 of the highest importance. The tombs uncovered so far range from the seventh to the third centuries B.c. and are unusually rich in content. As yet, com- paratively few from the seventh century have been discovered, but there are a great many from the sixth, with bucchero and fibulae, some from the fifth, including several with Attic r.f. of the Polygnotan school (Fig. 4), and large numbers from the fourth century and later, containing both Attic and South Italian. Noteworthy is the appearance of two vases by the Chequer Painter (see LCS, 196-9), closely associated in style with the bell-krater from the Castelcapuano necropolis in Naples (LCS, 198, no. I I, pl. 79-3), which provide further evidence for his Campanian connexions. Most of the other r.f. is Campanian of the fabric of Cumae (LCS, 700)-it includes several of the typical late Cumaean vases decorated with female heads, some large vases by the Painter of New York GR 1ooo (e.g. from Tombs 155, I85a), some excellent examples of the Apulianiz- ing style (notably a bell-krater from T. 194 by the Ivy-Leaf Painter, which gives further support for his activity at Cumae, and one by the APZ Painter himself), and a large bell-krater (from T. 144) by the Painter of B.M. F 229, remarkable for its extensive use of added red and white. There is also a bell- krater (from T. 164) of the AV Group by the Man- chester Painter, as well as some Paestan bell-kraters from the Asteas-Python workshop, with the usual representation of Dionysos with a papposilen or a satyr, and two of somewhat later date. one (from T. 163) showing the transition from the style of Asteas to that of the Painter of Naples 2585, the other (from T. 94) by the latter artist. The material from the third century includes examples of Gnathian ware and some vases decorated in a polychrome style, similar to that of the vases from Nocera referred to above; amongst these a calyx-krater from T. Io6 will probably prove to be of special interest, when it has been cleaned. FIG. 5</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SOUTH ITALY AND SICILY 33 At the Foce del Sele the small square building in Zone A, excavated in 1958 by Dr Paola Zancani- Montuoro (AR 1961 41), has now been fully pub- lished," together with the extensive material found with it. Work is in progress on the site, with the particular aim of solving the topographical problems of the sanctuary as a whole. Further to the south at Velia Dr Mario Napoli has continued his campaign;18 the most exciting find has undoubtedly been the head of Parmenides (Fig. 5) which fits exactly on the the herm dis- covered in 1963, bearing the inscription HAPMENEIAEE HYPHTOLZI OYAIAAH2'9, and supplies us with the only known portrait of the founder of the Eleatic school of philosophy. Basilicata (Lucania).20 A new Superintendency of Antiquities covering the province of Lucania, which has now reverted to its older designation, the Basilicata, was created in July 1964 and placed in the energetic hands of Dr Dinu Adamesteanu. An immediate result has been the reorganisation of the archaeological museums of Potenza and Matera, making available a wealth of material that was previously inaccessible,21 and the expansion of the Antiquarium at Metaponto, where the finds from that area are now admirably displayed in close proximity to the Tavole Palatine. A new museum is in course of construction at Policoro (ancient Heraclea), which will house the extensive new finds from the excavations in progress there, as well as the remark- able group of r.f. vases referred to in my last survey (AR 1963-64 35-6) and now published in detail, with excellent illustrations, by Dr Nevio Degrassi.22 A series of excavation campaigns is also planned with the aim of investigating the five main access-routes to the province, namely the river-valleys of the Bradano, Basento, Covone, Agri and Sinni; they will be carried out with the collaboration of a number of foreign institutions, notably the University of Heidel- berg, the German Archaeological Institute in Rome, and Brown University (Providence, R.I.). It is also proposed to prepare a detailed survey of all the archaeological sites in Lucania. This will be sup- plemented by the appropriate photographic docu- mentation and should be of the greatest value to all workers in this field. During the work carried out in connexion with the restoration of the Roman theatre at Venosa, the first evidence came to light of the occupation of that site before the founding of the Roman colony in 291 B.C. A good deal of local pottery (Lucanian and Daunian) was discovered, together with frag- ments of Attic b.f. and r.f. The same phenomenon occurred also at Grumento where, in a similar context, local Lucanian ware was found, together with Attic b.f., confirming the existence of a settlement there not later than the middle of the sixth century B.C. The excavations at Policoro have shown that the city of Heraclea, founded in 433-2 B.c. by the Thurians and Tarentines, was at first confined to the top of the hill and that the inhabited area below is a later addition of the fourth century. Traces of an earlier settlement on the east slope of the hill, going back to the eighth century, have also been found; this was strengthened by an agger in the seventh century and probably served in the archaic period as a fortified outpost (&lt;ppopiptov) for Siris, since there are signs of a considerable expansion at the end of the sixth century, when the city fell into decline. Work is at present in progress at Metaponto to complete the excavation of the temple of Apollo Lykaios, begun last century by the Duc De Luynes and continued by Lacava and, more recently (1939), by Sestieri. Its dimensions have now been deter- mined as 53.2 X 20 m.; a number of fragments of sculptures in marble and limestone, probably from the pediments, have been discovered, and they appear to be the work of a local school c. 530-500 B.c., under strong Ionian influence. On one of the blocks of the architrave is part of a dedicatory inscription in the Achaean alphabet, reading in retrograde AYTOI KAI FENE[I]. To the north-west of the temple the further excavation of the votive deposit discovered by Sestieri23 has yielded some more statuettes of Daedalic type, dating to the early seventh century, as well as a good deal of locally- produced material going down to the end of the fourth century. A study of the position of the blocks of the architrave and pediments of the temple shows that it had begun to fall into decay by the last quarter of the fourth century B.c. Another votive deposit was located near the south-east corner of the temple, with material also ranging from the seventh-century to c. 320 B.c., including a bronze kriophoros of the late archaic period.24 In the vicinity of the temple traces of a potter's kiln and workshop have been discovered, with fragments of South Italian vases and some wasters. Its excavation, which is scheduled for the near future, should yield results of 17 P. Zancani-Montuoro, M. W. Stoop and H. Schliger, 'L'edificio quadrato', in Atti Soc.

TRENDALL great importance for the chronology of Early South Italian pottery as well as for the location of one of its places of manufacture. A study of the topography of Metapontum, assisted by an aerial survey,25 shows that the temple was outside the city until the fifth century, when it assumed the form already deter- mined by the work of Schmiedt and Chevallier;26 25NSc 1965 (Supplemento) 179-184. 26 Caulonia e Metaponto (1959) 23-58, especially 50 ff. the latest survey makes clear the area of the castrum built by Hannibal in 211 B.C. for the Herdonians. Only part of the Metapontine necropolis has yet been excavated; so far some 64 tombs from the end of the sixth to the beginning of the third century have been opened, but the section associated with the earliest period of the city has not yet been located. The tombs have yielded an interesting lead tablet bearing a Pythagorean inscription, and a number of vases, now in the Antiquarium, including several early Lucanian pieces from the workshops of the Amykos and the Creusa Painters (LCS, 697-8). A small landslide in the Via Di Giulio at Pisticci, in the vicinity of Santa Maria del Casale, brought to light three tombs from what may prove to be the necropolis of the ancient settlement there. Two, dating to the later fifth century, were a fossa, dug in the sandy soil, and furnished with walls of stone slabs and tile lids. They contained several plain black kylikes, two pelikai by the Pisticci Painter, which must be amongst his earliest works in South Italy, a slightly later bell-krater (Fig. 6) also by his hand, and a panathenaic amphora by the Amykos Painter. The third, which belonged to the later sixth century B.C., was equipped with b.f. vases and a spear-head. Another burial from about the same period contained 18 plain vases of local make and an Ionian cup. It is hoped to conduct further excavations in this area shortly. About five miles up the valley of the River Basento at S. Biagio della Venella a small sanctuary has been identified and partially excavated.27 It consists of a small structure (3.8 x 6.4 m.) built over three springs and divided into two clearly demarcated sections, that on the western side unpaved, the other in the form of a recipient for the water. The site has yielded many architectural fragments of great 27 BdA xlix (1964) 360-I; Atti del IVo Convegno Magna Grecia, 127 ff., pls. 3-6.

On the western boundary was found a stone with an inscription in archaic Achaean letters to Zeus Aglaios, to whom the sanctuary was probably dedicated. Two trial trenches, dug in collaboration with the German Archaeological Institute in Rome, on the north-west slope of the hill of Santa Maria d'Anglona near Matera (possibly the ancient Pandosia), estab- lished a succession of occupation from the Appennine phase until the fourteenth century A.D. Of the finds to date the most interesting is a votive deposit of terracotta statuettes (Fig. 8) of the fifth century B.C. FIG. 8 Finally, some reference must be made to the contents of a tomb in the Chiucchiari necropolis at Melfi, excavated in 1955-56, but only recently ac- cessible after the necessary cleaning and restoration.28 It contained fragments of a large bronze chariot, two bronze belts, a cauldron-support, two Attic b.f. cups, one decorated in the characteristic Little-master style, two Ionic cups of Type B in the classification of Vallet-Villard (M?lArch lxvii, 1955, 14-31), all of which may be dated c. 540-530 B.C., and a bronze patera with an anthropomorphic handle, probably slightly later in date. Most remarkable of all, however, was a large bronze candelabrum, 134 cm. high, in three sections, consisting of a base supported on three legs terminating in paws and surmounted by small felines, a tall octagonal column decorated with two sets of projecting lotus flowers, and an upper part with three discs surmounted by a stronger one to which were attached six candle-supports and a small male figure. The supports are serpent-headed with a lyre-like flower emerging from the mouth.

II Italian and Etruscan candelabra at present known,29 and Adamesteanu regards it as the product of a new school of bronze-workers, reflecting both Greek and Etrusco-Campanian influence. To this school he would also ascribe the decorated bronze belts from the same tomb and the many bronze helmets from the site, decorated typically with confronting boars incised on the cheek-pieces (Fig. io). Also noteworthy at Melfi is the existence of what seems to be a local fabric of late red-figure, dating to the latter part of the fourth century B.C., which has turned up in limited quantities in the Valleverde necropolis. The most common shapes are a lekanis, the bowl of which is supported on a cylindrical stem rising from a moulded base, and a round, lidded pyxis, with- out handles, the upper portion topped by a knob, the lower supported by a moulded base (Fig. I i). The decor- ation consists of seated women or youths, separated by large fan palm- ettes enclosed in a triangle. The lower portion of the pyxis is decorated only with such palmettes, with the fans pointing alternately up and down. Although in style these vases are obviously closely related to Apulian, they cannot at the moment be at- tributed to any known painter or workshop; the terracotta is somewhat different from that of standard Apulian, and they may well be of local manufacture. 29 Adamesteanu, op. cit. 204, note 18.

Dr Nevio Degrassi has now made a preliminary Apulia. Building operations in the suburbs of Taranto continue to bring to light a number of tombs containing interesting, if usually fragmentary, vases. Tomb 5 in the Contrada Solito, excavated in February 1965, contained an Apulian calyx-krater (123768) with the unusual subject of a young Pan, playing the flute and reclining on a panther-skin-covered couch, between a seated woman, holding a branch and a phiale, and a standing nude satyr with a palm-branch. With it were found two cups and a guttus in the Gnathian technique, a vase decorated with painted bands, and a loom weight. From Tomb 3 in the Viale Magna Grecia, discovered in October 1965, comes an Apulian pelike in the 'Ornate' style repre- senting a seated Poseidon with a frontal Amymone, who is crowned by Eros as she stands between a laver and a lion-head fountain from which water pours down into a hydria below. The drawing, especially of the drapery, is unusually fine. Also of interest are fragments from two large kraters of the early fourth century, one (Fig. i!) representing Perseus terrifying silens with the gorgoneion in the pre- sence of Athena, and the other a gigantomachy. Another tomb yielded a b.f. lekythos and nine b.f. kylikes, all with athletes in the tondo and komoi or satyrs and maenads outside. From the finds in the vicinity of the Ospedale Nuovo, which include many figurines and fragments of tiles, as well as the remains of a potter's kiln, it seems that the Tarentine Kerameikos was probably located in that area. Several of the more important vases from the former Arn6 collection at Manduria, which were sold at auction in Rome in May 1966, were acquired by the State and are destined for Taranto Museum. They include the early Lucanian bell-krater depicting a goddess on a ram (Sale Cat. no. 70; LCS 689, no. 297a), a skyphos of the Reggio Group (Sale Cat.</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SOUTH ITALY AND SICILY 37 (Fig. 13) by his kindness. A fuller study is promised in a forthcoming volume of the Bollettino d'Arte. At Canosa a number of tombs have been excavated, often very richly equipped with vases of various kinds. Fig. 14 shows the contents of a typical large tomb, containing a series of tall oinochoai, kantharoi and lekanides decorated with female heads, a fish-plate, a kernos, an askos, and other r.f. vases, some Gnathia ware, several squat lekythoi with net-work patterns, and a large quantity of local plain wares. The tomb also included some bronze armour and a red- figured patera (inv. 123646; Fig. 15) decorated around the inside with Odysseus slaying the suitors on his return home to Ithaca.31 The style is cruder than that of most contemporary Apulian and the vase may well be the product of a local workshop, to which should also be assigned two lekanides (123520 and 123533) from the same site, decorated with female heads like those on the handles of the patera, and a mug (123545); probably also the rhyton B.M.

In June 1966, in collaboration with the Soprin- tendenza and the Pennsylvania University Museum, the British School at Rome32 carried out a preliminary excavation at the hill site of Botromagno near Gravina, where there are abundant remains of a Peucetian settlement. Three separate areas were excavated. In the first, below the hill, remains of at least three buildings were uncovered, ranging from the late eighth to the fifth centuries and including a floor of large sherds, many of them decorated and datable to the middle of the seventh century. Several infant burials were connected with these structures, notably one with a Corinthian running-dog kotyle associated with native ware.

FIG. 16 The operations at Sybaris in conjuction with the Pennsylvania University Museum and the Lerici Foundation continue to yield results, and more of the Greek wall has been located. A new excavation at Torano Castello has brought to light a prehistoric necropolis of the eighth century B.C., with material similar to that found at Torre del Mordillo, including impasto pottery, and bronze fibulae and pendants. At Caulonia some Hellenistic houses have been found, one of them with a mosaic pavement representing a sea-monster, now in the Reggio Museum. At Locri in 1964 a further stretch of the wall on the west side of the ancient city was uncovered, together with the remains of a tower, and at Marasa a votive deposit was found containing numerous terracotta statuettes of a bearded Zeus, with one arm resting upon a column with an Ionic capital or holding a thunderbolt in his upraised hand.37 This discovery almost certainly identifies with Zeus the Ionic temple formerly associated with the Dioscuri.

W. Stoop, continue to yield excellent results, a preliminary publication of which has now appeared in Atti Soc. Magna Grecia vi-vii (1965-66) 3-17. The number of hydriai from the Acropolis has risen to over 3oo, and in 1966 a further thirty graves were excavated on the mound, raising the total to over a hundred. They proved to be very rich in Greek material of the seventh and the first half of the sixth centuries B.C., most of the tombs containing at least' fifty vases, mainly Ionian cups, Laconian and Middle Corinthian, unfortunately in a very frag- mentary state since they had been crushed by the stones on top. The identification of the site still remains an open question, and it is a pity that the most exciting dis- covery of the 1965 campaign on the Timpone della Motta, an inscribed bronze tablet dating to the middle of the sixth century B.c. and bearing a dedication by an Olympic victor, sheds no further light upon it, since it does not give the name of the town from which he came. The tablet itself (Fig. 17), which measures 12 X 24 cm., bears the likely to be a phratric designation, as commonly in inscriptions from Magna Graecia (cf. the Locri and Heraclea tablets), than the Homeric b6c. The object to which the tablet was attached therefore remains unidentified; it was obviously unnecessary to name it in the inscription. The dedication must originally have been made in a sanctuary to Athena; it does not, however, belong to the building in which the tablet was actually found, since this is of later construction.

During the past three years the activities of the Soprintendenza have been largely concerned with further exploration of non-Greek sites, especially those occupied by the Carthaginians in the extreme west of the island. The results of the Leeds-London expedition's work at Motya in 1961-63, under the direction of Dr B. S. J. Isserlin, to which reference was made in AR 1963-64 40-1, are now more fully available in a preliminary report published in the Annual of the Leeds University Oriental Society iv, 1962-63 (1964) 84-131. Subse- quent excavations have been carried out by the ,Institute of Near Eastern Studies in the University of Rome, in collaboration with the Soprintendenza, under the direction of Professor Tusa, and three volumes have so far been published (Mozia I-III, 1964, 1966, 1967), giving details of the campaigns in 1964-66. These concentrated upon the area in the locality known as Cappiddazzu, where Whitaker more than fifty years ago had brought to light the remains of sacred edifices; the enclosure wall of the temenos was defined, together with the succession of buildings within it, the earliest of which is now seen to go back to the sixth century B.C. The tophet yielded a number of stelai, some with human figures of a type rarely found at Carthage (Fig. I8), a group of terracotta masks, several female heads, one Greek, one Egypt- ianising wearing the klapht, and others in the typical Punic style, together with a good deal of Carthaginian pottery. At Selinunte the excavation of the vast necropolis of the ancient city continues to yield an increasing number of vases, especially Corinthian, both im- ported and locally imitated, and Attic black-figure, amongst which are numerous white-ground lekythoi, of which two (Fig. xg) are of special interest, one representing Herakles and the Stymphalian birds (Fig. xg a), the other a chorus of warriors on dolphins accompanied by a flute-player (Fig. ig b-d), as on the Boston skyphos.39 There are also a good many examples of Attic red-figure, especially from the Polygnotan circle, and a few pieces of South Italian, including a large dinos and a bell-krater decorated in a somewhat provincial style, recalling that of the vases of the Locri Group (LCS 74-76; especially nos. 376 and 379), and a calyx-krater showing Dionysos reclining on a couch with two maenads, a seated papposilen playing the flute, a dancing Pan enveloped in a mantle, and a small Eros (Fig. 20), which in style is close to 'Ornate' Apulian of the Iliupersis Group. In September 1965 in front of Temple O on the acropolis was discovered a sacred area of Cartha- ginian type which, on the evidence of the pottery fragments and coins found in it, must be dated to the period following the destruction of the city in 409 B.C.

Their contents included plain black Campanian wares, and some vases of Gnathian style, thus confirming the hellenised nature of the city in the period immediately following its foundation. Some remains of the for- tress walls which enabled the city to withstand the attacks of Pyrrhus have also been discovered. At Himera the Archaeo- logical Institute of Palermo University, under the direction of Prof. Achille Adriani, conducted a series of campaigns between 1963 and 1966, which have brought to light a sacred area with three temples (A, B and C), an altar, and traces of the precinct wall. Temple B (Fig. 2x) which measures 32.7 X 10. 6m. was constructed in the early sixth-century B.c. of lime- stone blocks and had no colonnade; it was divided into four sections and incorporated an earlier temple (A) of smaller FIG. 21 dimensions (15.75 X 6.04 m.) built of river pebbles in the last decades of the preceding century, to judge from the pottery and bronzes found in it. Temple C, aligned with this structure but located a little to the north, measures 14. 3 by 7. I5 m. and may also be dated to the beginning of the sixth century. The plan of the ancient city has not yet been fully worked out, but it clearly followed a rectangular system. The excavation of several residential blocks has yielded a large variety of pottery fragments, terra- cottas, lamps, moulds, coins etc., which show that this area developed between the middle of the fifth century and 409 B.c. The tombs so far found consist of large terracotta receptacles composed of flat slabs protected by a lid with overhanging edges; the con- tents are scanty and of poor quality, but confirm that the necropolis came into use about the middle of the fifth century. The archaeological museum of the Fondazione Ignazio Mormino in the Bank of Sicily at Palermo has been transferred to more extensive quarters; the Daedalic statuette in its collection referred to in AR 1963-64 33 has been published (in colour) by Professor Tusa in a booklet entitled Una statuetta di terracotta di tipo 'dedalico' (Palermo, 1964), together with some Corinthian aryballoi, a small askos of native origin, and a terracotta figurine representing a man on horseback, which reputedly came from the same source as the statuette.

TRENDALL archaeological material from the Museo Civico,41 and a special room has been built to house the remains of the sculptural decoration of the temple of Olympian Zeus, together with a model of the building as reconstructed. An Antiquarium has been opened on the site of Heraclea Minoa to house the material from the excavations at that site.42 Excavations at Sabucina43 continue under the direction of Dr Piero Orlandini, who recently left the museum at Gela to become Superintendent of Antiquities at Agrigento. A further section of the Greek wall has been cleared, revealing the remains of several square or semi-circular towers, and, in the residential area inside the wall, of some houses of rec- tangular plan with rooms disposed about a central courtyard. In the southern necropolis five chamber tombs have been excavated, two of which showed signs of having been re- used at a later date, since they contained, in addition to material from the seventh century, some pieces of Attic b.f. and r.f. and of Ionian wares. Of particular interest is a column- krater by the Harrow Painter showing Hephaestus at the forge in the company of silens (Arch. Class. xvii [1965] pl. 57, i). The western necropolis has to date produced 365 tombs, dating from the second half of the sixth century to the end of the fifth; of these 337 were for inhumation, 28 for cremation, 225 for adults and 140 for children. The contents included imported Attic vases together with locally made imitations. The successive stages in the history of the site (see AR 1963-64 45) have been confirmed; it was repopulated by Timoleon soon after 340 and finally destroyed in 31 I-10, probably by Agathocles. The sanctuary at Bitalemi,44 near the mouth of the FIG. 23 river Gela, may now be definitely identified as a Thesmophorion, the first of its kind to be found in Italy, thanks to the discovery in 1964 of a dedicatory graffito bearing the name of Demeter Thesmophoros. The site continues to yield quantities of pottery buried as votive offerings in heaps in the sand, as well as terracotta figurines of Demeter-Cybele with a lion and of mothers holding infants in their arms or on their shoulders (Fig. 22). The successive stages in the history of the sanctuary may be summed up as follows: (I) the cult began soon after the middle of the seventh century; there were no buildings at that period and votive offerings were buried in holes in the sandy soil; (2) in the second phase, which lasted from c. 540-460 B.C., the first shrines were constructed, and the most typical offerings were terracotta masks and figurines; (3) about the middle of the fifth century more permanent buildings were put up, which were destroyed by the Carthaginians in 405; (4) thereafter the sanctuary was virtually abandoned until Roman imperial times, when a large farm was built on the site, from which come the brick stamps inscribed CAL [visiana]. On the acropolis at Gela a further tract of the fortification wall45 has been cleared. It is I . 80 m. thick, composed of massive blocks of stone, and may be dated to the end of the sixth or beginning of the 41 11 Museo Civico di Agrigento (Palermo, 1964) by P. Griffo and G.

FIG. 24 Eastern and South-eastern Sicily. There has been no diminution of archaeological activity in the eastern sector of Sicily during the past three years, and much new and important material has come to light. Despite the establishment of several local museums and antiquaria to house antiquities as near as prac- ticable to the places where they were found, the Syracuse Museum finds itself greatly pressed for space, and it has been decided to construct a new building, to serve as an additional museum, in the Villa Lan- dolina, which is to be incorporated into the great archaeological zone that extends over the area of Achradina and Neapolis to the east of the Greek theatre.46 Among recent acquisitions by the Museum, a r.f. skyphoid pyxis, formerly in the La Rocca collection, is of special interest (Fig. 25). The lid is decorated with carefully drawn vine-leaves and bunches of grapes, the body with (a) a silen capering in front of a seated woman holding a tambourine, (b) Eros standing in front of a seated woman with a thyrsus. The style is closest to that of the Painter of Louvre K 236 (LCS, 216, nos. 88 and 89; cf. also 2I3, nos. 7-71 by the Prado Painter, and 215, no. 83 by the Fienga Painter) and the vase, which probably comes from the area of Ragusa, is of importance as providing further confirmation for the connexions between Sicilian and early Cam- panian and Paestan red-figure. In the neighbourhood of the Villa Maria at Syracuse part of a classical necropolis has been ex- cavated; in Hellenistic and early Roman times the area was used as a potters' quarter, and still later, in the fourth century A.D., it was occupied by a large hypogeum. Twenty-three tombs, mostly looted in antiquity, have been found; the scanty remaining contents include a few broken vases of the sixth century and a bronze dinos. From the late-Hellenis- tic-Roman period come remains of pits and kilns filled with contemporary refuse, showing that it may well have been the Syracusan Kerameikos (cf. NSc 1955, 277). At Ognina,47 a small island some Io km. south of Syracuse, traces of prehistoric settlements have recently been found going back to the neolithic period, as evidenced by fragments of pottery of the Stentinello type. The island was subsequently de- FIG. 25 serted for a long period, but re-occupied in the early Bronze Age, when traces of huts in the form of hearths and beaten earth floors appear, together with pottery, some of the common Casteluccio type but mostly of a different style in blackish impasto, decorated with incised triangles filled with dot-punctures, like that from the Tarxien necropolis in Malta. It looks, therefore, as if the island may have served at this 41 See Lazzarini, La Rosa and Cappellani, 'Dieci anni di esplorazioni archeologiche nel Siracusano', in Archivio Stor.

TRENDALL time as a Maltese trading-post on the Sicilian coast, and the discovery of fragments of Maltese pottery of the later style known as Borg-in-Nadur suggests that the settlement lasted at least throughout the fourteenth century B.c. At Camarina Dr Paola Pelagatti has continued the methodical exploration of the urban area, and the new excavations have revealed the existence of further streets parallel to those discovered in 1961-62, set at regular intervals 35 m. apart, with cardines 4 m. wide. About I km. from the centre of the city and very near to the sea-shore, a large kiln has been found, probably for the manufacture of tiles. The upper part has been completely destroyed, but the firebox is almost complete (AJA lxx, 1966, pl. 85, fig. 8): three brick arches support the floor, which is pierced by four series of vents. Some Io km. east of Camarina in the vicinity of Capo Scalambri, excavations have been carried out, again under the direction of Dr Paola Pelagatti, in a complex of dwellings, probably the harbour town, referred to by Procopius (xiv 4. 12) as Caucana,48 where the fleet of Belisarius put in on the way to Africa. The complex extends for several hundred metres down the coast and the buildings, most of which would appear to be private dwellings, are in a reasonably good state of preser- vation, since they were covered up by the sand. Excavations at Eloro49 (anc. Heloros) have been conducted by Dr Pelagatti, in conjunction with Drs Maria Teresa Curr6 and Giovanni Voza, in the Hellenistic sanctuary of Demeter and Kore some 50 m. outside the walls of the ancient city. They brought to light a building composed of several units, of which six have survived. Although of different sizes, each had a bench about 50 cm. high running along the internal walls, composed of small blocks of stone with a covering of stucco. Upon these benches were placed the votive statuettes which were recovered in large quantities, all representing the characteristic Timoleontic type of Demeter, with a torch and piglet; on the eastern side of what must have been the principal room were found still in position a number of statuettes which had been stuck to the exterior of the wall by a coat of stucco. In front of the building on the east some bothroi were opened up: they con- sisted of a trench dug in the sand and then lined with small stones, with an internal diameter ranging between 50 and 130 cm. The votive offerings were deposited within in a circular fashion so as to leave the central portion free for sacrificial purposes; traces of this survive in the form of ashes and small animal bones. Beneath the floor-level of the Hel- lenistic sanctuary remains of an archaic structure, consisting of a shrine with two rooms and a number of bothroi, were discovered, along with some archaic pottery and statuettes. After an intermission of two seasons the excavations at Morgantina were resumed in April 1966 with the object of carrying forward the work of consolidation and restoration of the theatre, and of conducting further exploration of the residential area which lies on the plateau west of the Agora (AJA 1967, 245-250). An excellent start was made with the work on the theatre by moving back into their proper places the seat blocks of the two cunei of the northern sector of the cavea and by filling out with rubble masonry many of the gaps and the two lower rows, which were FIG. 26 missing. Numismatic evidence from the fill on which the seats were placed showed that the seats, at least, cannot be dated before the middle of the third century B.c. If the analemmata themselves are earlier, as was indicated by the careful soundings made by Professor Holloway some years ago, it would seem that the audience must, at first, have sat on an earthen slope, supplemented perhaps by wooden benches. The work on the west residential plateau linked together three houses, which had been fully or partially excavated in the past, so as to make a unit, and established clearly the widths and intersections of three streets, added parts of four more houses, and a series of at least three small commercial establish- ments at the north-west corner of one block. One cannot be too sure of their nature, but almost cer- tainly, from the large amount of iron found in it, one belonged at some time to a smith, another most probably to a baker, while the third is uncertain, though it may have been a wine-shop. Of the houses explored three yielded material of some importance. The first of these, known as 48 AJA lxx (1966) 357, pls. 84, 9 and 85, 10-12. 49 For an account of the earlier excavations see MllonAnt xlvii (I965) 203-340.

In the third house, which had undergone a later reconstruction when one of its rooms was built out over the alley which originally bisected the block from north to south, was found a small terracotta jug containing 44 gold coins-five of Philip of Macedon, ten of Alexander, five of Agathocles, 21 of Hicetas and three of Pyrrhus of Epirus, thus ranging over a span of about 75 years. Since Pyrrhus left Sicily in 275 B.c. and did not issue any coinage there afterwards, the hoard may well have been concealed not much later; conditions in Sicily were highly critical at that time and there had been a confronta- tion, recorded by Polybius (i 8.3), between the Mamertines and the Syracusans at Mergane, which has sometimes been equated with Morgantina. Thus far the evidence for the area shows that prior to the fourth century there was an urban settlement on the west plateau, and to date nothing has been found to indicate that either the orientation of the buildings or the street plan was essentially different from those of the later times. A small amount of late fifth and early fourth century ware, including a few pieces of Attic r.f., have been recorded. The bulk of the material is fourth century, and the renewed plan must be assigned to the end of that century, with most of the construction beginning in the third, and coming to a climax with the establishment of wealthy houses c. 250 B.C. Further excavations have been conducted in the necropolis of Thapsos, largely explored by Orsi in 1894- Five new tombs were opened up, yielding numerous vases of the typical 'Thapsos' style, although of fourteenth-century Mycenaean, which Orsi had found in abundance, only a few fragments appeared. On a large farm at the mouth of the isthmus some impasto pottery and traces of walls were found, suggesting that the residential quarter might be located in this area. A trial dig brought to light two rooms of a large hut, quadrangular in form in contrast to the usual oval shape (as at Lipari, Panarea, Salina, Filicudi, etc.). In it were fragments of pottery of the typical 'Thapsos' style, together with a bronze bar with figures of a dog and a fox, unique in prehistoric Sicily and possibly of Aegean origin. The definitive publication of the excavations at Megara Hyblaea by Professors G. Vallet and F. Villard is now well under way. Volume II, devoted to the archaic pottery, appeared in 1964, followed in 1966 by volume IV on the fourth century temple. They continued in I964-65 the opening up of the area between the houses to the south east of the Agora and the gymnasium discovered in 1963; on either side of the somewhat irregular street which survived FIG. 27 as its principal axis were found small Hellenistic houses, beneath which often appear remains of archaic dwellings, mostly from the eighth and seventh centuries B.C., with thick house-floors of a characteristic yellow colour, due to the use of local sandstone debris. From the same period comes a series of archaic wells, in one of which was found a large krater of local make (Fig. 27) dating to c. 650, in the initial phase of the Megarian polychrome style,51 in which the figures are drawn in outline, only partly filled in with red and light-brown. The obverse shows two ToviLat Orli7pfj, wearing patterned drapery not unlike that worn on contemporary Daedalic statuettes, and flanking a conventional guilloche motif; on the other side (Fig. 27) are two prancing horses confronting, with a smaller horse to left and a hound to right. The decorative system is 50 Kyle Phillips, Art Bulletin xlii (1960) 243-262; Stillwell, AJA lxxi (1967) 247. 51 See Villard, 'La Ceramique polychrome de Megara Hyblaea', in Kokalos x-xi (1964-65) 603-8; AJA lxx (1966) 359, pl. 88, fig. 17.</page><page sequence="18">46 A. D. TRENDALL FIG. 28 typically Megarian, though it shows a strong Cycladic orientalizing influence. The street plan of the archaic city is now beginning to emerge more clearly, and it would seem that all the streets starting from the south edge of the Agora took an oblique direction towards the south east and are roughly parallel with one another, thus conforming to a general plan, if not strictly of the 'Hippodamian' type. Dr Paola Pelagatti has continued her excavation of Naxos, concentrating in 1965 on the northern sector, where she found some small quadrangular rooms belonging to a dwelling which originated in the seventh century, was reconstructed in the sixth, and finally destroyed at the end of the fifth. The discovery of a thick layer of crushed tiles on the pavement of the house indicated the collapse of the roof; amongst the tiles was found a silver obol of Rhegium of the late fifth century B.C., which suggests that the abandonment of the house coincided with the destruction of the city by Dionysius I in 403. A full account of the excavation and restoration of the Greek theatre at Tindari (AR 1960-61 51-2) has now been published by Bernab6 Brea in Riv. Ist. Arch. xiii-xiv (1964-65) 99-144. At Lipari further excavations have been carried out in the area of the Castle,52 largely concerned with the prehistoric settlement, in the course of which was discovered an impasto pot containing over two hundredweight of bronzes, including crude ingots, axes of various kinds, daggers, spear-heads, and many other sorts of tools and weapons. Not far from the remains of the large hut where this pot was found a huge bothros came to light, filled with fragments of pottery of the second half of the sixth and the first half of the fifth centuries B.C. Comparatively few of these are figured, but among them is the rim of a large b.f. dinos (Fig. 28) representing the labours of Heracles, with a series of six ships on the inside, very like those on the dinos in the Villa Giulia by Exekias (AB V p. 146, no. 20). On one of the plain fragments the letters AIO were incised, perhaps to indicate an offering to Aeolus, in whose sanctuary the pit may have been located. Another object of interest in it was a large stone lid 64 cm. in diameter, decorated with the figure of a seated lion, on either side of which was bored a large hole. It may be dated to the third quarter of the sixth century and might possibly have served as a cover for the bothros. At the end of 1966 excavation recommenced in the Contrada Diana necropolis; three more tombs came to light, containing five vases in the characteristic style of the Lipari Painter (LCS 653 ff.), a lekanis decorated with geometric designs, and a magnificent gold ring.
