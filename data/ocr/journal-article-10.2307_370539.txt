PARKS, Chairman, QUEENS COLLEGE, FLUSHING, NEW YORK Dr. George B. Strayer, director of organi- zation and administration, Teachers Col- lege, Columbia University, gives a forecast of the changes to come in the American edu- cational system in his article, "Postwar Education," which appeared in the first number of the new magazine, Predictions of Things To Come. The magazine, which con- sists exclusively of articles forecasting the future by eminent authorities likely to be right, went on sale in the United States and in Canada on October 2. It is published by the Parents' Institute, Inc., 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, New York City. The first number of The Explicator, a new magazine of interest to English teachers, appeared in October. Sold from Box 1247, College Station, Fredericksburg, Virginia, the magazine is edited by G. W. Arms, J. P. Kirby, L. G. Kocke, and J. E. Whitesell. It consists of a large sheet folded into eight pages, each of which may be cut and refold- ed to four by six inches for filing purposes. Each sheet contains one or more explica- tions of some reference or difficulty in the text of a poem. There are also questions on similar points of interpretation addressed to readers of the magazine. The subscription price is one dollar for eight monthly numbers from October to June. A pamphlet in two parts titled A Diagnos- tic Approach to the Reading Program has been 198</page><page sequence="2">NEWS AND NOTES 199 issued by the Division of Instructional Re- search of the Board of Education of the City of New York. The first part is concerned with the nature of the reading problem and the orientation of the teacher; the second part is mainly concerned with diagnostic methods in the classroom. The cost of each part is fifteen cents per copy. A pleasant twenty-four-page illustrated brochure issued by George Peabody Col- lege for Teachers, Nashville, Tennessee, tells How a Teachers College Professor Teaches English. The professor is C. S. Pendleton, and the occasion of the article in the Peabody Reflector, now reprinted as this booklet, is his completion of twenty years' service at Peabody. Fortunately, the tribute to Pen- dleton actually does tell how he teaches, so that it is helpful as well as pleasant reading. THE PERIODICALS The critical method of arriving at bio- graphical fact and understanding of an author's psychology through the author's literary images is evaluated by Lillian Her- lands Hornstein in the PMLA for Septem- ber. She draws her evidence mainly from Marion B. Smith's Marlowe's Imagery and the Marlowe Canon and Catherine Spur- geon's Shakespeare's Imagery. First, if the study of images is to function as a critical method, the critics must agree upon what an image is; but at present they are con- fused. Miss Spurgeon, for example, con- siders "dressed myself in such humility" as an image of movement, whereas Miss Smith classifies a similar passage as a clothing image. Second, the critics are inconsistent in weighting the images. Poets are thought to become "subjective" in their imagery, although they are "objective" in the crea- tion of characters and the ideas of imagi- nary characters. Lyrical poetry is assumed to contain relatively fewer unconscious images than dramatic poetry. The third difficulty in the critical method is the dilem- ma of the proper inference to be drawn from the image. We are told that Shakespeare blushed easily, because he says of Venus, But now her cheek was pale, and by and by It flash'd forth fire, as lightning from the sky. Spenser, however, makes similar references at least six times in The Faerie Queene. On reference to Elizabethan proverbs and other Elizabethan poetical common- places, many of Shakespeare's images prove to be of very questionable value as indexes to his own interests and activities. Imagery of garden sports, spring, flowers, and weath- er, which are said to be distinctive in Shake- speare's writing, are all common in the prov- erb lore. Speculation on imagery rests on a twofold assumption that the image is a true indication of interest and direct observation and that the absence of an image indicates lack of knowledge or interest. Unfortunate- ly for the theory, the evidence for the second assumption is as thin as the evidence for the first assumption. In Isaac Walton's Life of Donne there is not a single fishing image. A few months ago James Norman Hall found a full-page photograph in Life with a caption which read: "This quaint 1932 photograph shows A. Edward Newton, late great book collector (left), entertaining essayist Agnes Repplier in his library." Mr. Hall protests in the Yale Review for autumn. Why is the picture "quaint"? Perhaps be- cause the old collector and his distin- guished guest have interrupted their tea long enough to compromise, gently, with the photographer, who has persuaded Mr. Newton to hold one of Miss Repplier's books with the jacket visible. Despite all evidence to the contrary, it is reassuring to believe that by 1932 the "wave of the future" had not rejected all old-fashioned folk but that part of the impulse urging it in a truly for- ward direction came from the decent past. Essayists should have standing-room at least in the midst of any body politic that considers itself civilized. Destroy urbanity, and men find themselves glaring and snarl- ing at one another, eating the stale unleav- ened bread of mere economic existence. The article writers, so engrossed with to- day, often ignore our heritage as children of Time. And the essayist with his juster</page><page sequence="3">200 COLLEGE ENGLISH sense of the relative importance of the pres- ent moment is trampled under the feet of the capable but shouldering and lapel- seizing penmen. Unlike them, the essayist feels no messianic urge. He offers, some- times, salvation from boredom. His great- est service, shared with the poets, is to com- municate from his fallow mind and receptive spirit glimpses that make him "less forlorn." Probably most contemporary poets would agree with Paul Engle that the poet must accept the machine as part of his world, not worshiping it as god or devil and not damning it except when it is misused in the deadly instruments of war. From Whit- man's time they have increasingly given us pictures of locomotives and airplanes. But the trouble is, as Ernest Earnest points out in the Virginia Quarterly Review for autumn, they do not always know what they are talking about. Machine imagery often comes from books, not life, and from an attitude reminiscent of the red man's toward the flintlock musket. A locomotive is described as "the new birth of old Be- hemoth, late sprung from the source whence Grendel sprung." The frame of a skyscraper becomes ". . . . this iron harlot/With the sky between her breasts." Even Spender calls his "Express" a queen and confuses pistons with drivers. Spender, too, and MacNeice illustrate the common tendency to attribute evil emotions to machines. Spender's concrete pylons are "nude, giant girls" supporting high-tension wires "Like whips of anger." MacNeice's "chimneys row on row / Sneer in smoke, 'We told you so.' " In the folk ballads, on the other hand, the machine is addressed in familiar and affectionate tones, which express the atti- tude of the truck-driver or steam-shovel operator. Casey Jones is the master of his six-eight wheeler: Put in your water and shovel in your coal, Put your head out the window, watch them drivers roll. Of the poets, Emily Dickinson caught the homely, friendly quality which the ma- chine shares with all men's articles of daily use. And the verse of Carl Sandburg shows little of the anthropomorphic concept of the machine. Modern poets generally, however, are self-conscious about machine-age im- agery, especially the leftists who pride themselves on the use of scientific con- cepts. In spite of much writing about the machine age, the poet too often maintains a Miniver Cheevy attitude toward it. Auden fears the "Engine drivers with their oil-cans, factory girls in overalls." Eliot is dissatisfied with "The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring/Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring." Modern poets, not understanding machines, are afraid of them. They might ponder Lucinda Matlock's remark: Life is too strong for you- It takes life to love life. Puttenham illustrates the early Eliza- bethan conception of a line of poetry when he compares it to a day's journey in which the traveler rests twice, at noon and at night. He preferred end-stopped lines with rich, monosyllabic rhymes. John Donne, as Arnold Stein demonstrates in the September PMLA, cultivated an entirely different rhythmical effect by his use of many tech- nical innovations. He matched masculine and feminine rhymes, rhymed weak syl- lables, substituted assonance for rhyme, frequently shifted stress, particularly in the fifth foot, and cultivated run-over lines. His rhythmical effects are extraordinarily var- ied, from explosive rigor to the low-flying melody of everyday speech: Now thou hast lov'd me one whole day, Tomorrow when thou leav'st, what wilt thou say? The verse may take its tone from stately marching monosyllables: 0 more then Moone, Draw not up seas to drowne me in thy spheare Weap me not dead, in thine armes, but for- beare .... Or the rhythm may be so pliable as to border on looseness:</page><page sequence="4">NEWS AND NOTES 201 So it pleas'd my destine (Guilty of my sin of going,) to thinke me As prone to all ill ..... Donne expressed the traditional tendency of Elizabethan criticism to emphasize mat- ter rather than form. Like Bacon, he re- pudiated the Ciceronians, who searched "more after the choiceness of the phrase .... and the sweet falling of the clauses .... than after the weight of the matter." Anti-Ciceronian style, written in prose by Muretus, Lipsius, Montaigne, and Bacon, used either separately or in combina- tion a curt, compressed, pointed manner or a loose, intimate, pliable style meant to reveal the workings of the mind. Persius, following the anti-Ciceronian movement in prose of Latin literature in the first century, is a poet comparable to Donne, whose verse immediately followed a similar Renaissance movement in prose. By his loose rhythms, brusque transitions, and Senecan points and by his avoidance of epigrammatic paral- lelism in the couplet, Donne, like the writers of anti-Ciceronian prose, conveys the ener- getic, spontaneous flow of ideas in corre- sponding rhythms and music. In the Yale Review for autumn, C. A. Dykstra reviews the significant facts in the relationship of "Education and World Con- flict" and explains the implications which should guide our planning for post-war edu- cation. Never before has there been such widespread recognition of the fact that the nation looks to colleges and universities for the training of leaders. Eighty per cent of the men chosen for officers' training have come from the colleges. The system of na- tional scholarships now being discussed in the hope that we may draw a larger pro- portion of able high-school graduates into college may signify that at least we are taking seriously Jefferson's view of democ- racy's responsibility to give all who are capable of higher education the opportunity for it. If capacity to do the work becomes the basis for college entrance, in a generation of twenty years that would mean roughly ten million students. If history repeats itself, after the war we shall see a tremen- dous increase in college attendance, per- haps under the stimulus of federal subsidies. Education will be responsible for training people to rebuild a world which is socially disintegrated, mechanically unified. We agree that exploitation cannot be tolerated much longer and that our economy is be- coming a consumer's economy. We shall meet the change by education or by force. The problems of a maturing civilization must be solved by a people whose outlook is broad and not cramped by early and rigorous specialization. Their education de- mands comprehensive research above in- vestigation of the minute. It means non- departmentalism for the immature and less emphasis upon ad hoc training courses until we have taught individual responsibility and the place of the individual in the uni- verse. The great task of those who are re- sponsible for educational policy today is to develop an appreciation and understanding of world problems and challenges as uni- versally as possible. If we possess a demo- cratic faith, our educational philosophy must be built upon the democratic postu- late of man's educable nature, of liberty and co-operation as the basis of civilized life, and of the deep appeal of universal brotherhood. In the last phase of her work as a novelist, Virginia Woolf was increasingly the victim of her peculiar limitations. W. H. Mellers, in the Kenyon Review for autumn, supports this generalization by analyzing the later books, The Years, The Waves, and Between the Acts, in contrast to the earlier novel, To the Lighthouse. The Waves gives glimpses of weak characters who are oppressed by the mystery of life but who cannot put the mys- tery into words. In The Years, whereithe characters fail to become real even in frag- ments, and where the passage of time ap- pears not tragic but fatuous, a sense of pur- poselessness gives way to a sense of oppres- sive frustration. Easily the best part of the book, the section on the "Present Day" is comparable in quality to Kurt Weil's neu-</page><page sequence="5">202 COLLEGE ENGLISH rasthenic ballet The Seven Deadly Sins. Be- tween the Acts reinforces the suspicion that the vacuousness which in Mrs. Woolf's later work would seem to be life's final meaning is of Mrs. Woolf's and not of life's making. As a novelist, she may have been too con- cerned about life to be very adequately con- cerned about living. As a reviewer pointed out on the publica- tion of Mrs. Dalloway, Mrs. Woolf's intel- lectual capacity was oddly disproportionate to her sensitiveness. If she ventured out- side the range imposed on her by nervous sensation, she became a child. When she was concerned with personal reminiscence, she could use her impressions, in their vari- ously subtle interrelations, to form a whole; and perhaps what she did in To the Light- house could be one only once. As a sensuous artist, she saw perceptions of the senses as transitory and mutable, dominated by time, and in To the Lighthouse she found in the long-anticipated trip to the lighthouse a central symbol for her theme which is just and integral. In this book her conception of human relationships and moral values is delicate and sure, graded around the positive figure of Mrs. Ramsay. Mrs. Woolf did not use the novel qua novel but for a poetical end, and she achieved but one triumph. From 1902, the year of his death, until 1920 Samuel Butler steadily rose to fame. After 192o his influence at first declined, but in late years, as modern psychology has achieved remarkable results by using con- cepts similar to Butler's theory of "uncon- scious racial memory," his views are less discordant with prevailing scientific hy- potheses. In the September PMLA, Lee Elbert Holt traces Butler's rise to fame up to 1920. The obituaries, written before publication of *The Way of All Flesh, praised Butler as an honest satirist, original and daring but eccentric and disappointing in the whole of his work. After 1903, first Arnold Bennett then Clutton-Brock and others praised The Way of All Flesh, but it was not until much later that the novel was generally read. The London Times review appeared in 1919. In 1904 George Bernard Shaw publicized Butler's ideas on the sub- ject of evolution in Man and Superman, later stating his indebtedness clearly in the Preface to Major Barbara (1907). In 19o06 Marcus Hartog, the biologist, instituted the annual Erewhon dinners, which grew in attendance to a hundred and sixty promi- nent men in 1914. Before the war ended Butler was written about in France, Ger- many, and America from the points of view of philosophy, biology, and prose fiction. Upon the publication of his notebooks in I912, the International Journal of Ethics praised Butler's style, saying that "never since the eighteenth century was there such consummate ease and simplicity, such point, such nervous energy." By 1920 he had achieved a more extensive fame than any- one could have foreseen at the time of his death. Unlike university professors who would agree that no one person can teach an out- line course in humanities, Herbert Waldo Hines believes that the humanities course cannot be taught successfully unless it is the work of one instructor. He presents his case in the Junior College Journal for Sep- tember. It is poor psychology to expect that students will achieve mastery by advertis- ing that the material is too much for one instructor. The sense of continuity, of re- lationship among the parts of the course, furthermore, must be impaired if more than one instructor participates. From the humanities course the terminal students need to secure the general educa- tion which will prepare them for later casual reading. In the class are temperamentally studious people who will read penetratively, though they will never make a pretense at scholarship. There are also the students who will go on to professional schools and to lives of scholarship. For all these students, it is an advantage to enjoy the guidance of one instructor who comes to understand their specific needs. An outline course in the humanities, properly administered, not only can be im-</page><page sequence="6">NEWS AND NOTES 203 portant in the cultural development of the ordinary student but can also furnish the scaffolding of historical perspective needed for our post-war planning and can arm the prospective specialist against dogmatism. During the decade 1930-40 twenty-four universities conferred the Ed.D. degree on 804 persons now living. For the Ph.D. de- gree the corresponding figures are fifty-five graduate schools and 2,713 persons. In the Journal of Higher Education for May, Ernest V. Hollis compares the status of the two groups of Doctors. The accompanying table shows their relative success in finding posi- tions. Ed.D.'s Ph.D.'s (Per (Per Cent) Cent) Employed in all types of higher education. .................. 46 58 Graduate work ................1. 4 17 Colleges ...................... 27 37 Junior colleges ................ 5 4 Elementary and secondary schools 42 25* Research..................... 3 6 Administration ................ 40 31* Unsatisfactory employment ..... 6 7 Unemployed. ................. . 4 o.9 * In education. So far, there is little difference between the requirements for the Ed.D. and for the Ph.D. The progressive graduate school will be the one which makes a realistic differen- tiation in its doctoral program based on as- certained differences in job demands. At present, statistics show that universities ac- tually differ in the kinds of professional training which they have developed. One university, for example, places 69 per cent of its Ed.D. graduates in administrative po- sitions, whereas another places only 30 per cent in administration. To be of maximum benefit, the graduate schools must recognize and foster this division of labor, each one ad- vertising restricted offerings and making se- lective admissions. The period of quantity production for expanding needs seems to be drawing to a close. A statistical analysis of 93 letters of ap- plication written by students in education classes at the University of Wisconsin is published in the April Journal of Educational Research by Phil C. Lange. In general, the students included similar items in their let- ters, stressing ability to take charge of ex- tracurricular activities, but they differed widely in effectiveness of presentation. Only io of the 93 letters were ranked "worthy of careful consideration." The letters of the 20 language majors were lower in median rank than the others. Only 6 of the 93 letters were free from mechanical errors, of which the median number per letter was 14. Er- rors in diction, abbreviation, punctuation, spelling, and grammatical agreement were the most frequent. Finally, the students proved unable to evaluate their own letters, and they showed no skill in emphasizing those points which they considered most likely to gain an administrator's favor.
