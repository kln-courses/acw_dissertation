Gilbert Murray died in 1957 at the age of ninety-one, and there are people in Britain of no very great age who can recall hearing the regular broadcasts he made for the BBC on a variety of topics until almost his last year. In addition, Murray remained active until well into his eighties in a number of public causes, principally in the interest of international peace, collective security, the United Nations, and international coopera- tion among scholars. Murray is probably still best remembered for his translations of the plays of the classical Greek dramatists, which, while seldom performed today, in- troduced a generation of listeners and a mass audience to Aeschylus, Aristophanes, and Euripides in frequent broadcasts in the forties and fifties. In an earlier phase of his career, while professor of Greek at Glasgow and later at Oxford, Murray contributed to the emergence of contemporary classical scholarship through his critical editions of the plays of Euripides (1901, 1904, 1909), and in works such as The Rise of the Greek Epic (1907), Four Stages of Greek Religion (1912), and Euripides and his Age (1913). Although these latter clearly reflected, and helped to popularize, a more comparative and anthropological approach to Homeric literature, Greek religion, and Greek tragedy, the tendency of Murray's argument about the nature of Hellenism and its contribution to western culture was in clear contrast to the con- clusions of his friend and sometimes collaborator, Jane Ellen Harrison, the chief rep- resentative of the anthropological turn in classical studies at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century. Harrison, strongly influenced by the late nineteenth-century biblical critic William Robertson Smith, as well as by the founder of anthropology, James Frazer, emphasized the social role of religion, the sources of pre-Homeric Greek religion in primitive and irrational fear, and the chthonic character of ancient Greek ritual and worship. Far from deprecating the irrational and primitive character of Greek religion, Harrison saw it as a more authentic reflection of the hu- man spirit, and regretted the later domestication and rationalization of religious instinct in the anthropomorphic figures of the Olympic pantheon. For Murray, on the other hand, the development of Greek religion according to the needs of the emerging polis into the more serene and rational religion of the classical period, was "the victory of human intelligence, reason and gentleness against what seems at first the overwhelming power of Passion and unguided strength" (p. 159). Murray's adoption of the sociological perspective of the new classical scholarship at the same time that he substituted for its naturalistic conclusions about religion his own brand of Victorian progressivism can stand as a metaphor for what is most problematic in his life. As an extremely bright and precocious young man (he was elected professor of Greek at Glasgow at the age of twenty-three), Murray acquired in his first twenty years most of the convictions that stayed with him throughout the rest of his very long life. But even for the mid-1880s, these convictions were somewhat old-fashioned, con- sisting of commitment to Mill's philosophy, Comte's religion (in its critical if not in its positive phase), and Radical politics as exemplified by one of its last surviving repre- sentatives, John Morley. The encounter between these convictions and the new circum- stances of life in the first half of the twentieth century is the chief interest of Wilson's biography, although one must often read between the lines to grasp it. That encounter is</page><page sequence="2">162 Albion of interest not just for its significance in Murray's life, wherein the courage of convic- tion and selfless service of ideals alternate with blocked understanding and frustrated ability. The encounter is of greater interest because Murray represents, in his own per- son, the dialectic of change between the Victorian age and our own. In addition to what Frank Turner in his The Greek Heritage in Victorian Britain has called the ironic character of Murray's intellectual life, which combined conflicting enthusiasms for modernism and Hellenism, anthropology and moralism, this dialectic can also be seen at work in the evolution of the political agenda of an 1880s Victorian Radical under the pressure of events in the twentieth century. Murray's response to developments in international affairs from the Boer War to the Suez Crisis, in domestic policy from the Radical Budget of 1909 to the implementation of the welfare state, in imperial relations from the Home Rule Bill of 1886 to the liberation movements of the 1940s and 1950s is an answer to the question of how a typical Victorian would have reacted to us and our doings in the first half of this century. Wilson, a former British diplomat, is particularly helpful in illustrating the origins of Murray's support for the League of Nations, the United Nations, and collective security in convictions about foreign affairs that took their inspiration from William Ewart Gladstone.
