<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROCK PAINTINGS OF LAGA ODA (ETHIOPIA)* By PAVEL CERVICEK During an ethnological research expedition of the Frobenius Institute to Ethiopia taking place in 1950/1952, headed by Adolf E. Jensen, there was a possibility to visit the painted rock-shelter of Laga Oda, situated approximately 25 km S. W. of Dire Dawa and 10 km S. W. of Ullulu, and to document partly the rock-paintings it contains1. The Laga Oda rock-shelter was already known then; discovered in 1933 by Azais and Oncieu de Chappardon2, the rock paintings and stone industry it contains have been the subject of interest on the part of several specialists3 - yet they remained unpublished.4 The Laga Oda shelter, the distance of which from one of the Gunufata sources is about twenty minutes' walk, is situated in the side of a limestone hill and sub-divided into two "floors" (see PL 1. 1). Its size as well as the number of paintings in it and the subjects depicted seem to have been exaggerated by the former authors5; in fact, the upper ,,floor" probably does not surpass 60 m in length, 3 m in height and 4 m in depth, the lower one being substantially shorter and attaining only 2 m in height. The number of rock paintings in the shelter is about six hundred provided the numerous (250 to 350 specimens) oval representations are reckoned as one painting respectively. The rock-shelter contains, in addition, many undefinable colour traces which could not be examined closely in view of the short time disposable. The pictures concentrate in the middle of the upper "floor" ceiling. Here individual representations can attain the length of 1,60 m6. Generally, the size of the pictures, however, is up to 60 x 80 cms. The lower * The expedition at which the rock-paintings discussed below were documented could take place thanks to a financial help from the German Research Council (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) to whom the Frobenius Institute wishes to express its heartfelt thanks once again here. 1 Cf. Pauli: 1951/1952, 256. The rock-paintings were copied on the spot by Elisabeth Pauli who has also drawn (with Gisela Wittner of the Frobenius Institute) the illustrations to this article. The photographs are due to Eike Haberland, a member of the above-mentioned expedition, now the Head of the Frobenius Institute, whose valuable hints largely helped the author in preparing the material for publication as did the advice of Hildegard Klein, Gerhard Liesegang and Ulrich Braukamper of the mentioned Institute. 2 Breuil: 1934, 482-483. 3 The rock-paintings in the Laga Oda shelter were studied by Bernard Fagg in 1941, cf. Clark: 1954, 297- 298, Text-fig. 35/3,4 and PI. 29. See also Alimen: 1955, 443; Bailloud: 1959, 25; Cole: 1964, 242; Graziosi: 1964a, 91, sketch map on p. 92; Anfray: 1967, 24, PL VIII. In 1962 and 1963, the rock art in the Harar-Dire Dawa region was explored by an Ethiopian archaeological expedition headed by Gerard Bailloud - in a preli- minary note on its results, however, no explicit mention of the Laga Oda rock-shelter occurs though it is highly probable that it was studied, too, see Anonymus: 1963. 4 With the exceptions of Clark: 1954, Text-fig. 35/3,4 (after photographs by Fagg), Haberland: 1963a, PI. 28/1 and Anfray: op. cit., PL VIE. 5 Breuil: op. cit., 482 speaks of the rock-shelter as being about 100 metres long; Cole: op. cit., 1. c. reports "nearly a thousand figures" from the ceiling of the top "floor". In reality, neither "pastoral scenes, including the defense of the flock against wild beasts" (id. ibid., apparently after Breuil: op. cit., 483), nor "rhinos, ele- phants, buffaloes, lions, cheetahs and hyenas" (ibid.; Clark: op. cit., 297 knows about "one drawing what may be a human figure riding an animal which is probably an ox") could be traced by the Frobenius Expedition. 8 Cf. the large representation in English red on Fig. 48 (from Fig. 4 to Fig. 9).</page><page sequence="2">122 PAVEL CERVICEK "floor" of the shelter does not contain but "miniatures" ranging in size from the postage-stamp to 15 x 30 cms. There are also thematic differences between the two "floors". On the upper "floor", the cattle, goat, sheep and oval representations in red, white and black predominate, whereas on the lower "floor" practically all the H-shaped man representations7 and the sun-like symbols are concentrated, the oval forms seeming to be entirely absent. The whole shelter is partially blackened by smoke; it being still used as an occasional shelter by the local pastoralists and labourers, this fact could account for the seemingly inadequate description of its paintings handed down to us in the literature8 - it is pos- sible that many paintings had been made undiscernible by soot in the period between the visit of Azais and Fagg's exploration9 and the arrival of the Frobenius Expedition. Catalogue of the paintings Fig.l Eight various pictures of cattle, heavily weathered. The most of them can only be seen when moisted. Many traces of no more discernible paintings on the backgroud. The first picture left top is in a rosy colour which seems to be a combination of white and English red. The contour of the neck and the horns are painted black. The fore legs painted over the hind legs of the cattle picture to the right. The second picture from the left is painted in white, the contour, the inner pattern, horns and udder in black. The third picture from the left is painted in a dar- kened white, the details in black, its fore legs are overpainted by a white oval with black details. The first picture left bottom is in English red, the ovals before it in yellowish white. The cow picture to the right is in caput mortuum red, the picture of humped cattle beneath in yellowish white, the cattle painting to its right in black, the cattle picture extreme right in white with con- tours in English red. The ovals are painted in yellowish white, with black dots for a part; the strokes are in black. Upper "floor". Sizes : the second figure from the left in the upper row 36 cm long, the oval painted over the fore legs of the picture of cattle top right 12,8 cm high and 8,5 cm wide. Fig. 2 and photo PL IL4 A picture of a cow, its hind legs overpainted by a painting of a goat (?). Two fragments of animal representations beneath. The inner surface of the cow picture is painted in dotty weat- hered white; its contour, tail and horns in caput mortuum red; the dots and strokes on the inner surface, the udder and the formation on the neck as well as the two drop-like dots beside the horns in black10. The animal painted over the hind legs of the cow is in dirty white. The left fragment is painted in a heavily weathered white colour, the strokes on the neck and the horns in black. The right fragment is painted in a darkened white colour, the three strokes on its hind leg (?) are in black, the "saddle-cover" on its back in English red, containing three black strokes. The ovals on the top and right are painted in white. Upper "floor". Sizes: the cow 61 cm, the animal picture on the left 21,5 cm long. 7 The only exception as far as our material is concerned is the H-shaped man picture from the upper "floor" on Fig. 45. 8 Largely going back to Azais' letter to Breuil of 24 th April 1933 (Breuil: op. cit., 482). 9 See Note 3 above. 10 Published by Clark: op. cit., Text-fig. 35/3.</page><page sequence="3">ROCK PAINTINGS OF LAGA ODA (ETHIOPIA) 123 Fig. 3 Oval representations and strokes, curved lines, dots. The ovals are painted in a weathered white colour, the five biggest of them are outlined in black, some of them show one, two or four dots on their inner surface, painted in black as well. Upper "floor". Size: the biggest oval (the third from the left in the centre) 10,8 cm high, 5,4 cm wide. Fig. 4 Picture of a cow (left) and a goat (right).

The paintings are executed in black colour with the exception of the white strokes on the neck of the cow. Upper "floor". Sizes : the figure on the left 22,5 cm high, the cow picture 43 cm long. Fig. 7 Two paintings of cattle, one picture of an oval with a stroke. The left cattle picture entirely black with a weathered or scaled-off spot in its hind part. The right cattle picture white with black dots, its contour in the lower part of the neck, at the fore leg and the downwards directed horn as the other details are black. The oval is painted white with black dots, the dent in its upper part is not due to weathering. Upper "floor". Sizes : the left cattle picture 34 cm, the right one 37 cm long. Fig. 8 Picture of a man with an object in his left hand, six paintings of cattle. The anthropomorphic picture and the three animal pictures below are painted in bold English red in a rather primitive manner. There is another picture of humped cattle as that below, which has not been copied. The three pictures on the top are in white with black details, more exactly painted. The picture on left top is overlain by a picture in black (camel ?), the central picture, faded to a great extent, by the figures in red. Upper "floor". Sizes: the picture extreme left 26,5 cm long, the anthropomorphic figure 21,5 cm high. Fig. 9 and photo PL IL5 Two big paintings of cattle with a small one between them. Above the big cattle pictures and at several places overpainted by them is a large outstretched figure painted in English red which is continued to the left (see Fig. 48), totalling 1,60 m in length. The inner surfaces of the cattle pictures were probably originally white.</page><page sequence="4">124 PAVEL CERVICEK The horns, contour of the back, lines on the neck and the end of the tail of the cattle picture on the left are painted black and so are the dots and strokes on the inner surface of the big cattle picture on the right - its horns, udder and the contour of the abdomen and the neck are painted in black as well. The two circular markings (brands?) are red as is the contour of its legs in their lowest parts. The oval over this cattle picture is in white with a black contour and black dots. The small animal white; contour and details black. Upper "floor".

Fig. 10 and photo PL 1.3 Two paintings of cattle (centre) and two paintings of goats (above and on the left) with eleven oval and stroke representations below. All paintings are heavily weathered so that the original colour of their inner surfaces could not be found out with certainty but they seem to have been painted in white. The hind part of the goat picture on the right top is painted in white. The outlines of the cow pictures are in black as all the details pertaining to them are. The goat pictures are painted with a viscous paint in a thick layer as are the paintings on Figs 1 extreme left, 28 right, 36, 37. The oval forms are painted black and so are the strokes on their left sides. Nine ovals are white-dotted. Upper "floor". Sizes : the right cow picture 39 cm, the left one 33 cm, the left goat picture 31 cm, the right one 26 cm long, the ovals ca. 5-6 cm high. Fig. 11 Painting of a cow, in a colour varying from dark to light grey with light brownish stains which may be due to weathering. The line of the back, the horns and the tail are partly black. Painted on a scaled-ofF part of the rock, the natural colouring of which is much lighter than that of the neighbouring rock covered with a dark patina. Lower "floor". Size: 9,3 cm long.

Fig. 17 Picture of an animal with downwards directed horns. Painted on the inner surface in light to dark graphite colour, the contours in places, the horns and the tails entirely in deep black. The strokes on the head, at the neck, on the shoulders and above the back of the animal are paint- ed in dark caput mortuum red, only laboriously discernible on the dark rock background. Light-coloured traces on the inner surface and the tail, resembling mouldy stains, are apparently due to a chemical process like with Figs 19, 20 and 29. The original colour of these spots seems to have been black. Curiously only one ear appears to be depicted. Lower "floor". Size: 17 cm long. Fig. 18 Painting of a cow, in black colour. Lower "floor".

The oblong stain on the neck and shoul- der of the animal is lighter than the black-painted picture and presumably not belonging to it; between this stain and the upper end of the neck there are lighter places as well as along the forelegs - these are due to scaled-off rock. There are mould-like stains on the head and the neck as with Figs 17, 19 and 29. Conspicuous is the absence of one ear as e. g. on Fig. 17. Lower "floor". Size: 20,5 cm long.

The third thematic group, anthropomorphic representations, do not seem to have been painted for their own sake but in connection with the cattle and symbolic representations only. The only exception to this rule is Fig. 44. Another motif, the sheep, is rarely re- presented, as are dogs, camels and others. There are isolated representations of giraffe (Fig. 34), ibex (Fig. 8 extreme right) and orycteropus (Fig. 32). The majority of the cattle pictures show a distinctive style which is known in the Harar-Dire Dawa region from the rock-shelters of Genda Biftu (Surre)13, Errer Kimiet and Saka Sharifa14 as well as from unspecified localities15, in the Sidamo province from Chabbe near Dilla16, in Eritrea from Hishmele near Senafe17, Karora at the Sudan fron- tier18 and Adi Quanza near Mai Aini19. In the southern Hidjaz, there are rock engrav- ings in this "Ethiopian- Arabian" style near Ta'if and Al Hanakiya20. In Upper Egypt, cattle engravings stylized in this manner exist in the quarries of Gebel Silsila amongst the graffiti of the Roman Imperial Period21 and in Lower Nubia there are rock paintings in this style in a rock-shelter at Sayala22. The style is also found with rock paintings of cattle in Northern Darfur23 and sporadically among the rock engravings of the Libyan desert24. In this style, the body of the cattle is shown in profile and so are the legs; the fore-legs and hind-legs are pooled to one thick line respectively, the hoofs being some- times shown from the front, making a pincers-like impression, but more often the legs have rounded ends dismissing the hoofs entirely. The neck, head and the ears of the cattle are shown from above, the horns from the back (looking precisely as in the frontal view) as if the head of the animal were turned away with respect to the on-looker25. The first stage of development of the "Ethiopian- Arabian" style, the stage of Surre26, develops to more and more abstract forms : the body of the cattle becomes unnaturally long27, the 18 Breuil: op. cit., 477-482, Figs 7-11; Clark: op. cit., 296-297, Text-fig. 34 and 35/1-4; id: 1970, Fig. 67; Bailloud : op. cit., 25-27, Fig. on p. 26. 14 Rosen : 1949, Fig. on p. 211 left column, the third picture from the top, Fig. on p. 221 below; Clark : 1954, 298-301, Plates 50-52. 15 Last-Pankhurst: 1969, 4, Fig. 5.

Pictures of cattle with downwards directed horns also occur within this style30. Furthermore, there are instances of deformed horns depicted, a practice frequently echoed in the rock art of the East and Central Sahara31, also known in Ancient Egypt and among mo- dern cattle-breeding peoples of the Upper Nile, Southern Ethiopia and Angola32. Some cattle pictures executed in this style are headless (Figs 26, 33, 40, 42, 47), a phenomenon also documented at Saka Sharifa near Harar and in the Lower Nubian rock art33. On Fig. 26 in the centre, a headless cattle is painted over a painting of cattle with stump-like horns (the fourth developmental stage of the style). This would indicate a relatively recent date for the headless representations. The big cow on Fig. 45 (right centre) has one horn adorned with a kind of streamer as the cattle figures sculptured in the same style at Chabbfc; its neck ornament is difficult to interpret34. The majority of the cattle representations apparently belong to the long-horned domesticated race Bos taurus macrocerus Durst35 which frequently appears in the North African rock art - a few pictures show the humped cattle Bos indicus (Figs 1 below centre, 8 below, 21).36 Together with the representations of cattle, fat-tailed sheep painted in the same style 28 The third stage, see Figs 1 left top, superimposed on a cattle picture of the first stage, 7 left top, 11, 14, 18, 22, 23, 38, 47 left top. Cf. Clark : op. cit., Text-fig. 35/5, 6. The tips of the incurved horns may even touch the forehead as on the painting in the prospectus cited in Note 15 above. Cattle pictures engraved in this variant of the "Ethiopian- Arabian" style occur as far west as in the Algerian Sahara and the Southern Oran, fitted with saddle cloth as is presumably the cattle (?) on our Fig. 2 right below (Huard: 1962, Fig. 2/2, 4). 29 The fourth stage, see Figs 45 (the two black-painted pictures of cattle below), PI. 1. 2 (the picture on extreme right may originally have been a picture of sheep, over the horns of which an E-shaped sign was painted), 1 centre below, 28 (centre - superimposed on a cattle picture of the second stage), 24 (?), 26 (the black-painted cattle picture). Cf. Clark: op. cit., Text-fig. 35/7, 8 and Pis 27, 47/3 (rock engravings at Bur Dahir, Somalia); Rosen: op. cit., Fig. p. 211 left bottom, right top and p. 221 below; Graziosi: 1964a, PI. XVI. A very similar style is wide-spread in the African rock art; it occurs among the South African rock paintings in the Tsodillo Hills of Botswana and in the Matopo Hills (Cooke: 1969, photo opposite p. 39 above) as well as in the Nubian and Libyan deserts (Resch: 1967, PI. 21). 30 Figs 17, 20, 23. In Nubia, engravings of cattle with downwards directed horns are known from Onib in the Wadi Allaki (Parker-Burkitt : 1932, PI. L, Fig. 2 left). This natural phenomenon appearing with cattle on the transition stage towards a hornless race is either due to permanently movable horns or to horns which were movable in the youth of the animal and then grew fixed (Durst: 1926, 139). Cattle with horns shaped in this manner are favourite with the Borana, a Galla group in Southern Ethiopia, where they are called bagi, bdgole (Haberland: 1963a, 92-93). Bulls having forwards directed horns were bred by theGaramants accord- ing to Herodotus (Histories IV, 183). Nowadays they are common in Darfur (Arkell: 1937, PI. XVII b). 31 Figs 1 left below, 7 below, 13 right and 15. Cf.

At the present stage of our knowledge, any attempt to establish a chronology of the rock paintings of Laga Oda must remain tentative. Breuil dated the oldest (Surre) stage of the "Ethiopian- Arabian" style as approximately contemporaneous with the predynastic and protodynastic Egypt38 and Clark assigned to it an age going back to the beginning of the Christian era or shortly before39. Recently, Clark thinks of these paintings as connected with the Nubian C-Group40. In fact, there are some affinities of the Laga Oda rock art with the art mobilier of the C-Group culture : the scene of a smaller figure of cattle (calf?) beneath a bigger one (mostly a cow), represented in Surre41 and frequently in Laga Oda (Figs 12, 19, 23, 26, 40, 42, 46), is a motif recurring on the rough decorated ware of the C-Group42 and on the rock paintings of the Libyan desert43. Another motif from Laga Oda paralleled on the C-Group pottery44 and in the rock art of the Libyan desert45 are rows of strokes as on Fig. 1 below. The H-shaped man representations (headless man with raised hands as in a gesture of adoration) as on Figs 38, 40-47, which have been interpreted as analogous to represen- tations of killed and decapitated enemies among the head-hunting tribes of South- East Asia46, also seem to have a prototype on the C-Group pottery47. A similar man representation albeit with a head is found on prehistoric, heavily weathered funeral steles from Tiya-Soddu (Ethiopia, Northern Gurage)48. The absence of the head with the H-shaped man figures could be explained as a stylistic feature, common to both cattle and anthropomorphic representations49. The "Ethiopian- Arabian" style tends to increas- ed abstraction and suppression of details; thus it is possible that the horseshoe- like representations as on Fig. 35 show the most recent stage of development of cattle pictures within this style, omitting entirely the head, horns and the tail of the animals. Symbols like those on Fig. 29 left from Acchele Guzai (Sollum Ba'atti) south-east of Asmara have been explained by Graziosi as human schematizations and referred to as strikingly reminding of the human figures of the post-Palaeolithic prehistoric art in Europe (Spanish Art Group III)50. Another strongly stylized anthropomorphic repre- 37 Anati: 1968, 41, Fig. 23, suggests the second millennium B.

The circular (or oval) symbols, bisected by a central cross as on Figs 4, 36 and 37 have been recently reported to be still understood by the Tanzania Masai. According to a local elder, the circles represent cattle enclosures and are drawn by travellers pas- sing by to ask God's blessing52. The vegetable motives as on Fig. 29 occur among the rock paintings in Tanzania53. The meaning and age of the numerous oval representations (Figs 1-3, 7, 9, 10, 15, 48) with one to four dots inside or with a blank inner surface, accompanied as a rule by a stroke on their left side, are not clear. They resemble the paired "soles of feet" from the painted rock-shelter discovered by Rosen south of Bake Khallo and - to a certain extent - the sandal imprints known in great numbers from the Upper Egyptian and Lower Nubian rock art54. It is improbable that they should represent oval-shaped tomb- stones adorned with dot-and-line patterns, used nowadays by the Arussi in southern central Ethiopia55 for there seem to be otherwise no indications of the Laga Oda rock paintings bearing any relation to the cult of the dead. The possibility of the ovals repre- senting shields cannot be ruled out in view of the fact that some H-shaped men are holding in all probability shields in one raised hand56 and Alan Jacobs has observed the Masai nowadays still casually paint shield symbols on rock overhangs57. The sun-like symbols as on Figs 23, 29, 38, 41, 43, 47 are a wide-spread motif of the African rock art ranging from the Horn as far south as Rhodesia and as far west as the Fezzan58; their significance and exact age remain largely unknown. Similar symbols appear on the Christian Nubian pottery59 and as one type of the "characters" play a role in the Coptic magical texts60.

To sum up, the Laga Oda rock-paintings may be roughly estimated as ranging in date from the C-Group times (2200-1550 B.C.) when some of their leitmotives are antedated in the art mobilier of that culture at least thematically, down to the early Christian period from which some of the symbols they contain would originate. The "Ethiopian- Arabian" style probably developed during the last two millennia B. C. in Ethiopia and theHidjaz where most rock art specimens pertaining to it have been found up to now, including rock paintings, engravings and sculptures. Later on, it possibly spread westwards and southwards reaching the Nile valley at about the beginning of our era. In the southern Hidjaz, rock engravings belonging to the Surre stage of this style underlie Arabic inscriptions dating from the late 7th century A. D. ; the considerable contrast between the patina of inscriptions and that of figures suggests an appreciable time-span between the creation of the figures and the superimposition of the seventh- century inscriptions 6 x. 188 flakes, blades and other artifacts, some of them utilized, were found by Elisabeth Pauli on the lower "floor" of the rock-shelter. Unfortunately, those collected on the surface got mixed up with those coming from the two well distinguishable strata the filling of the "floor" consists of. Elisabeth Pauli could observe an upper stratum of blackish ashes, 8-12 cms thick, overlying a stratum of light grey to whitish ashes. Twenty-three relatively best worked or clearly utilized pieces are shown on Fig. 49. Nos 2, 14 and 16 are made of obsidian, the others of a flint-like material (chert?). Single end-scrapers on blades (Nos 1,2), a poor angle burin (?) (3), microliths with oblique retouch (4,5), an axial transverse burin (6), a drill (?) (7), a finely worked curved- backed microlith (8), a utilized triangular flake (9), scrapers on trihedral blades (10, 11), a double-ended scraper (12), a straight-backed point (13), utilized flakes (14,16), a flake with retouch on one edge (15), an asymmetric point (17), utilized blades (18, 19, 20), a scraper on a core (21), cores (22-23), one of them conical (22), are represented. The artifacts seem to belong to the Somaliland Wilton culture62, recently reported from Laga Oda63. They can be of a very recent date for this culture, having appeared in the Horn of Africa in the Second post-Pluvial Wet Phase, extended into the succeeding (actual) dry phase. It approximates closely to those Later Stone Age industries and Egypt and Lower Nubia were documented by the 8 th Frobenius Expedition in 1926, see PI. II.6 (a painted house near Assyut, Upper Egypt). - There is also a possibility of the "sun-like" symbols being stylized pictures of human (?) vulvae, a motif known from Egyptian and Nubian graffiti of the late Roman times, in the Dakhla oasis occurring in iuxtaposition with foot imprints and other engraved symbols characteristic of the beginning of our era (e. g. swastikas), see Winkler: op. cit., 8, 9, 13, 16, PI. IX/2,3 (erroneously classified as Dynastic); Kromer: 1967, 76, Fig. 16 (graffiti from Sayala, Lower Nubia, dating from the end of the 3rd century A.D., explained as connected with the cult of Venus). 61 Howe: op. cit., 11-12. According to the preliminary statement by the 1962-1963 Ethiopian expedition to the Harar province (cf. Note 3 above), the art of rock painting was practised during three millennia in the region, starting in the first half of the first millennium B.C. and lasting down to a very recent period. 62 Clark: 1954, 260-292. 63 Clark: op. cit., 297; Cole: op. cit., 1. c; Anonymus: op. cit., 1. c.

At the type site of the Somaliland Wilton, in a small rock-shelter, the Gumbur Todoballa, situated at Mandera, near the foot of the escarpment leading from Berbera to Hargeisa, some pieces of haematite, red ochre and one piece of white earth (calcrete?) were found66 - pig- ments corresponding to those utilized for painting the Laga Oda rock-shelter. 64 Clark: 1954, 260; Leakey: 1966, 227-228; Clark: 1969, 183.
