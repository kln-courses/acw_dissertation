<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> REVERSE ANTHROPOMORPHISM THE SEX-IMAGE AND ETHICS IN CONTEMPORARY ART Alan Singer THE MINDFUL BODY The aboutness that I want to grasp in these pages is elusive. I am inter- ested in contemporary artworks that seem to be about the sex act. This would certainly appear to involve a preoccupation with the body. But to attempt to represent the sex act is not exactly to devise an artifact that could be adequately described as about the body, as if one could so easily distinguish body from mind. Certainly in the act of sexual intercourse the body is the axis about which the mind moves in the efforts of desire. But in the act, we are quickly disabused of the notion that any causal principle governs. Neither can we assume that any- thing like a systematic relationality obtains between body and mind, as, for example, in the orbit of a moon around a planet, a common enough conceit for erotic love. Philosophers like Sartre have articu- lated the dilemma in terms of a simple paradox. I desire the sexual other as an individual, that is, a subject, but can possess him or her only as an object (Sartre, 98). The subject seems to court its own objec- tiWcation in the attempt to fulWll subjective desires. In this essay I want to consider the fact that a signiWcant number of contemporary visual artists engage the paradoxical seductions of subject–object relations inherent to the sex act in ways that I think elude simple paradox. In the course of these engagements they sup- plant the sometimes crippling subject–object, mind–body dualisms, which we have fetishized in our way of thinking about self and other, with a more limber notion of Wrst-person experience. For artists like Jennifer Saville, Eric Fischl, Lisa Yuskavage, Richard Phillips, Philip Pearlstein, John Currin, and others, painting sex has become a shared speculative enterprise: probing at the meaning of the human in its Cultural Critique 84—Spring 2013—Copyright 2013 Regents of the University of Minnesota </page> <page sequence="2"> REVERSE ANTHROPOMORPHISM 165 animal lair. Despite much laborious hand-wringing in the pages of art journals and in the popular press about the currency of pornographic images as source material for contemporary artists, this speculative enterprise is not unique to the present moment. It reaches far into antiq- uity, even beyond the well-known practices of Wrst-century Roman wall painters. It reappears conspicuously after the advent of photography in the works of painters like Courbet, Gauguin, and the Vienna seces- sionists. And yet I want to argue that it charges the present moment with expectations for discovering new métiers of self-explanation that may turn out to be critical to the persistence of our being as self- reXective agents. I will argue that images of sexual activity must now be engaged without the intellectual prophylaxis of moral themes or principles, if we are to understand them as a speculative threshold for grasping exigencies of human self-reXection. This presupposes that we have a stake in perceptual experience that does not succumb to conventional mind–body dualisms. It is currently argued by students of perception like Alva Noë (178) that our representations of the world are adequate to our experience of the world not because there is a determinative causal link between one and the other, but because the states of mind occasioned by the form of the world and the states of mind occasioned by our representational faculties are the same. Representing the sex act is, of course, epistemically a different prop - osition than engaging in the sex act. The philosophical dilemma of desiring another is, however, not entirely distinct from the image of de - sire that the kind of artist I wish to discuss here takes as a point of departure. Such an artist is deeply mindful of the way in which the body, as a locus of desire, is a goad to the mindedness with which physical being is encumbered and which, in the instance of physical desire, it seeks to displace. I want to suggest that the conceit of anthro - pomorphism is an epitome of the stakes of representing physical desire while arousing it, if we can speak of arousal without the conceptual baggage of representation. I think that the practice of anthropomor- phism suggests the impossibility of dropping the conceptual baggage. But we might examine this burdensome baggage more carefully. The anthropomorphic word or image demands a modiWcation of the object by a subject.1 Anthropomorphism is a bid for recognition after all. We want the world to look at us by looking like us. One seeks to make known in human terms what is not in conformity with the forms of </page> <page sequence="3"> 166 ALAN SINGER human experience. In this respect, anthropomorphism appears to be a one-way street. Having said this I now want to make the surprising proposal that Spinoza’s Ethics provides a strategic vantage point for taking anthro- pomorphism in a different direction. Spinoza’s famous account of human experience as conatus stipulates that “the order and connec- tion of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things, and vice versa [my emphasis], the order and connection of things is the same as the order and connection of ideas. Wherefore just as the order and connection of the modiWcations of ideas in the mind occurs according to the order and connection of the modiWcations of the body, so vice versa . . . the order and connection of the modiWcations of the body occurs according as thoughts and the ideas of things are arranged and connected in the mind” (Spinoza, 197). I should note that Spinoza’s conatus is virtually indistinguishable from desire. He tells us that the essence of one’s desire is always a determination by some given modiWcation of the self, or affectus (Spinoza, 125). On the basis of these attitudes we might surmise that anthropomorphism, which hinges on a furtive modiWcation of one’s self-conception in the anxious apprehension of species-otherness, is an inherently unstable proposition: it can be looked at in a way that is, contrary to appearances, not reducible to the defensive or aggres- sive projections of a subjective ego. I want to suggest that the so- called pornographic images of coitus composed in contemporary paintings reveal what is at stake in this possibility by evoking what I will call a reverse anthropomorphism.2 The bodies posed in the act of coupling, whatever the gender, incite a desire in the viewer to shed all mindedness in the interest of appearing to one’s self as excitable Xesh. This is a bid to participate in the act, not to understand it, where “understanding” entails a speculatively disembodied conceptualiza- tion. SufWce to say that in such cases participation would trump understanding. Clearly I am working here on the assumption that the scene of sexuality entails recognition of the urgency of perception more emphat- ically than almost any other representational topos. This is to say that I am not interested in the scene of sexuality as a genre, a composi- tional armature or a thematic register. I prefer to take the scene of sex- uality as an existential occasion. Its seems uncontroversial to assert </page> <page sequence="4"> REVERSE ANTHROPOMORPHISM 167 that the artwork is always occasional with respect to the perceptual conditions it orchestrates for its audience and according to which that audience is made to feel its own powers of apprehension. For this rea- son, as I have already anticipated, I will discount the importance of many noisy contemporary debates that I consider to be red herrings: such as the question of whether or not art and erotica are mutually exclusive propositions or compatible modes of representation. Nor will I rehearse the debates about what constitutes pornography vis-à-vis other forms of expression bearing on sexuality. The etymological links that marry the category of pornography (and its baggage of pseudo- moralizing) to the porne of antiquity, that is, the notion that what I am calling the sex-image merely solicits arousal, is less important to me than the question of who is aroused. Indeed, one of the commonplace criticisms of pornographic representation is that it depersonalizes the consumer, not to mention the solicitous porne (Levinson, 381–91). The question of who the depersonalized person is too often goes begging in this complaint. On the contrary, I am most interested in whom the subject of arousal might become vis-à-vis newfound expressive capac- ities. This entails understanding how one knows what capacities one possesses and how such knowledge enhances the prospect that the possessor of those capacities might be self-perpetuating in ways that enliven our ethical (ethos based) relations with one another. If I can satisfy these conditions of understanding, I will be in a position to allege the collaboration of aesthetic and ethical purposes as a signiWcant underpinning of the personhood that is augured in the sex image. All of this argumentation will be critical to reckoning with the already time-honored—but just as perennially misunderstood—proposition that the work of art matters to persons because personhood presup- poses something like the activity of the artist. THE SEX-IMAGE So what I am now calling the sex-image entices an identiWcation that precludes any identifying with, as is the case for standard anthropomor- phism. I would point out that an attempted identiWcation with ecstatic sexual partners presupposes a mindfulness of desire, not as a modiWca - tion of the subject, but as knowledge of a subject’s incommensurability </page> <page sequence="5"> 168 ALAN SINGER with its object. The attempted identiWcation spurs an unfulWllable im - pulse to abdicate mindful subjectivity. Therefore, if what is most tan- talizing about the sex-image is the sublation of subjectivity into bodily pleasure, we might crudely characterize reverse anthropomorphism as prompting a reversal of the trajectory of thought from mind to body. In effect, the sex-image is an incitement for sensation to displace conception. But it taunts conception in a conspicuously problematic manner. This is to say that because the sex-image eludes touch by a default of feeling, in effect it occasions a concerted thinking about touch. This is manifest as an increasingly elusive conceptualization of the object. Immanuel Kant’s speculation about what constitutes “spirit” (Geist) (181) in art, by which he seems to mean that which moves us as minds and bodies, bears mentioning here. Kant’s postulate of “aes- thetic attributes” (183), a central concern of his chapter on genius in the third critique, adduces a kindred phenomenon: “If forms do not constitute the exhibition of a given concept but are only supplemen- tary [Neben-] presentations . . . expressing the concept’s implications  . . . then they are called [aesthetic] attributes . . . and hence cannot be exhibited adequately” (183). Aesthetic attributes are thus exhibitions of sense that are continuous with the conceptualization they can never determine with Wnality. Accordingly, sensation paradoxically revital- izes the enterprise of mindedness itself. On these grounds I would claim that images of bodily excitement—the sex-image per se—give us a view of mindedness conducive to the speciWcally ethical modalities of human self-understanding that philosophers like Spinoza and, later, Hegel arduously struggled toward. The fact is that both Spinoza and Hegel begin with the proposition, shared today by many cognitive researchers and neuro-philosophers, that cognition is ineluctably embodied.3 To put it crudely, without such embodiment we lack a point of view to know ourselves conceptually. Which is to say that point of view, the possibility of reXection upon one’s being and one’s knowledge of what one is doing, presupposes our doing something. We are self-modifying creatures by dint of our very physical agency. The sex-image, which we might call an image- schema, after the cognitivist philosopher Mark Johnson, calls forth recognition of a dynamic sensorimotor pattern of experience that em - phatically denotes our organs qua organism (Johnson, 208). Precisely because our self-recognition is presupposed in any sensuous excitement </page> <page sequence="6"> REVERSE ANTHROPOMORPHISM 169 experienced as pattern, I want to propose that our bearing witness to the sex-image might occasion a reXective distance more than a mind- less instantiation of sensory intensity. Such intensities are too glibly the basis upon which critics of pornography and aestheticians wish to make what I believe is a dubious distinction between erotic art and pornography. I believe rather that the real power of the sex-image, as I will discuss it, is that it moots any distinction between erotic art and pornography and in that way gives us the prospect for an aesthetic (sense-grounded) ethics. FROM EROS TO ETHICS: WHAT JOHN CURRIN PROVOKES For reasons that will be obvious, I want to take the work of the Amer- ican painter John Currin as a speculative métier for thickening the account I have just sketched out. Currin’s notoriousness is of a piece with the notoriety given to him in a January 2008 issue of the New Yorker (Tompkins). His well-publicized use of photographic images harvested from Danish porn magazines of the ’70s as armatures for exhibiting Italian and Flemish High Renaissance and Mannerist glaz- ing, underpainting, and coloring techniques, permits a close inspection of the idea of reverse anthropomorphism as a prop for an aesthetic ethics. I will argue, however, that the epistemic nudity, so to speak, of the photographic image, is strictly preliminary to the effects that Cur- rin’s compositions achieve. The suite of so-called hard-core paintings that were featured at the Gagosian Gallery in 2006, and which have subsequently drawn the attention of critics concerned with both the marketability and the ethics of painting, are unsparing in their pre- sentation of human anatomical function. But their explicitness is not nakedly physical. Take, for example, two of the most sensational of Currin’s suite of porn canvases: The Danes (2006; Figure 1) and Rotterdam (2006; Figure 2). Most of the commentary on this work takes the sexual explicitness of the image as the self-evident issue and warrant for a viewer’s attention. I agree, but without indulging the melodrama of scandalous passion that merely displaces the provocative picture plane with self-serving attitudes of either moral self-righteousness or heroic broad-mindedness. The, so to speak, animal nudity of the act of coitus Wgured in The Danes </page> <page sequence="7"> 170 ALAN SINGER and Rotterdam is indeed quite like the photographic source of these paintings in its unambiguous ambition to court a viewer’s animal arousal. I should say that here I am using the word “animal” in the spirit of John McDowell’s (57) bid to construe our animal responsive- ness to the world (mediated by the senses) as potentially belonging to capacities for knowledge. It is worth noting how evocative of Spinoz- ian conatus such responsiveness is by its implicitly self-perpetuating trajectory of experience, the sine qua non of Spinoza’s reason (ratio) (Spinoza, 51). Even more to the point, McDowell urges our rehabil - itation of the ancient idea that humans are rational animals. As McDowell puts it in Perception as a Capacity for Knowledge, conceptual initiative in this regard is inextricable from perception: “Perception as an operation of rationality is our distinctive species of something that is generically animal” (57). The urgency of this point, however, will only be duly appreciable if we take a view of Currin’s work in some graphic detail. Figure 1. John Currin, The Danes, 2006. Copyright John Currin.

Photography by Robert McKeever. </page> <page sequence="8"> REVERSE ANTHROPOMORPHISM 171 The Danes depicts a threesome as a closed circuit of self-satiating bodily appetites. A single male penetrates one of two female partners. The central female Wgure uses her Wngers to give witness to her parted labia and simultaneously to enable the act of penetration. These details are roughly placed on an axis with her closed eyes. Her head and open mouth pair her, by sheer proximity, with an identical digital stimu- lation being performed by the second female Wgure. The second woman, whose mouth is passionately joined with the male’s, thereby conWg ures the apex of a triangle. We thus confront a troping of the female delta, which appears to be beyond any deliberation of the Wg - ures and, on that account, an implicit mockery of the deliberation of the painter/viewer. For all three Wgures have abdicated the viewer’s sense of sight. Furthermore, the rough impasto of the brush strokes that further animate the painting’s surface tease a tactility that, unlike the sense of touch made so conspicuous by the action of the female Wgures, re dounds to the viewer’s consciousness of thwarted physical stimulus. Figure 2. John Currin, Rotterdam, 2006. Copyright John Currin. Courtesy Gagosian Gallery.  Photography by Robert McKeever. </page> <page sequence="9"> 172 ALAN SINGER Though only two Wgures are depicted in Rotterdam, they are like- wise closed-eyed, obviating any dialogic prospect with the viewer’s gaze. The unmistakable rapport of the aroused bodies is all the more paralyzing a counter for the arrest of the viewer’s gaze before the pic- ture plane. Though seen from the front, the female’s legs spread and welcoming the male’s erect penis, the animus of the painting comes from behind, where the male Wgure is partially obscured by the female’s accommodatingly raised leg. This is another closed circuit of bodily appetites. The man’s grasp of his penis, the woman’s parting of her labia, the man’s hand reaching behind the woman to caress her breast, closes a compositional circle in a way that further shuts out a per- spectival line of sight that might render any conventional objectiWca- tion of the Wgures in the canvas a reward for attentive subjectivity. Indeed, the notion of composition itself gives way to the appearance of sheer accident, something akin to the spontaneity of the photogra- pher’s accidental tripping of the camera’s shutter. We cannot escape the worrisome thought that our act of witness is effectively accidental with respect to the action unfolding on the picture plane. Even more to the point, and complementary to the brush technique of The Danes, here the transparent glazed surface of the canvas seems to invite the viewer’s penetration of the picture plane. It does so in a manner that, almost comically, calls to mind the viewer’s head accidentally strik- ing an invisible pane of glass. The viewer is inveigled into a prospect for intimacy that is revealed to be ever more elusively peripheral. Such are the pains of voyeurism that Currin appears to parody here as the viewer’s helpless masochism. In approaching these paintings, I originally couched the issue  of viewership in terms of courtship because I wished to suggest that photography’s voyeuristic incitement of human desire, in the case of reputed pornography, devolves inescapably to a reverse anthropomor- phism.4 The pornographic photo occasions a courting of the viewer’s identiWcation with the animal without the self-dramatizing repertoire of human desires that typical anthropomorphic gestures are cloaked in. The paintings, as I have described them, are nothing less than a self-conscious recapitulation of this fact insofar as they both invite and preclude a viewer’s involvement in the action. Hence, in a seem- ingly counter-Spinozian, even Cartesian, way, the order and connec- tion of things—in this case, bodies experiencing a hermetically sealed </page> <page sequence="10"> REVERSE ANTHROPOMORPHISM 173 bodily pleasure—and the order and connection of ideas appear to have nothing to do with one another. So, in effect, Currin’s two “posings” after the camera image strik- ingly demystify the notion of the pose as an intentional fully minded act. The putative sitters exhibit such a vivacious absorption in the Xesh that the mindedness of the poser is made manifestly irrelevant to what appears as nothing but elusive sensation. It is, of course, important to observe that these paintings, regardless their provenance in porno- graphic photogravure, exist within the tradition of Wgure painting and what Harry Berger has called the “Wction” of the pose. Berger (91–95) posits a dramatic conXict between the posed Wgure and the poser, where the posing subject endeavors to make self-presentation a self-interpretation vis-à-vis the poser’s compositional intent.5 Berger’s exemplar is Rembrandt, whose portraits dramatize a “cognitive disso- nance between the awareness of the unperformed self-representations and truth to the norms governing the performances inscribed in . . . portraits” (227). But, as I have already intimated, in The Danes and Rotterdam we do not for a moment get caught up in the drama of the pose. We do not for a moment think of the painter’s imposing any such intentionality as the notion of the pose denotes. Nor do we enter- tain the dueling intent of the would-be “sitters” to challenge their poser’s compositional authority. Because the presence of the “sitters” in Currin’s work is so obtrusively a function of the Wgures’ perceptual activity, it is instead a taunt to the poser’s/viewer’s comparatively fee- ble powers of sensory perception. Moreover, because the poser/painter/viewer is effectively ren- dered accidental with respect to the aroused and so unbridled physi- cality of Currin’s Wgures, we might say that they are not posed in any way that is conventionally intelligible within the history of Wgure painting and its related genre of portraiture. Or, I should say, this is the case where the Wgure is meant to be read as a counter for some self-signifying mindedness that might Xatter the distanced vantage point of the viewer. Along with Berger I take this mindedness as the underpinning of Wgure painting broadly speaking. It is true that the more the technique of Wguration gained verisimilitude in the various technologies of visual representation, from the advent of Albertian per- spectivism, to the advent of the photograph, to the advent of cinema, and now digitization of the image, the more it tended toward the </page> <page sequence="11"> 174 ALAN SINGER pornographic. And it would be easy, at this juncture, to dismiss Cur- rin’s compositional resourcefulness as licentiously and reductively ironic: mere demonstrations of the uncomfortable proximity of high culture painterly technique to the precipice of physical debauchery. But it is important to realize that where arousal becomes an end in itself, our involvement with the image as something that stands in rela- tion to us as an occasion for mindfulness comes to an end. As Berger has explained, it is ironically the apparent impenetrability of the body Wgured or posed for the painter and the viewer that is at stake between the poser/viewer and the posed. The poser/viewer needs to penetrate the physiognomic mystery of the posed in order to reveal a concep- tually freighted insight into character. Aptly enough, the sex-image in Currin’s work is an epitome of penetration. But because it inveigles a somatic rather than a semiotic permeability, it proffers no revelation of the meaning that the superWcially worked facial physiognomy of the conventionally portraited Wgure invites us to pick out. And this might be the real potency of the sex-image that painters like Currin have discovered. It seems fair to speculate that Schiele, Klimt, Balthus, and Bacon, among others whose inXuences might be seen as coalesc- ing in the current vogue for painting the sex-image, share the insight. Because the sex-image seems to refuse our participation, which I would argue is a sine qua non of meaningfulness, it is correlatively a chal- lenge to the enterprise of self-explanation. In The Danes and Rotterdam, I would therefore argue that Currin occasions our witness to a radical absorption. Here I am of course glossing Michael Fried’s inXuential conceit for designating pictures in which the Wgures ignore the spectator. The Wgures in Currin’s can- vases nonetheless remind us emphatically that absorption is always self-absorption. It is hence a distinctly unintentional form of minded- ness that I warrant is common to the Wgure and the spectator. This is so even and especially if the spectator is reminded of his or her inabil- ity to Wnd a purchase for identiWcation. From my point of view, Currin seems more interested in the way that the spectator’s selfhood per- sists in reckoning with absorption’s resistance to the spectator’s desire for self-identiWcation than in any portent of the spectator’s alienation. Where Fried posits an antithesis of absorption and theatricality, the latter a predicate for viewer identiWcations, Currin intimates a con- tinuum. That is to say, the spectator is mindful of the need to account </page> <page sequence="12"> REVERSE ANTHROPOMORPHISM 175 for him- or herself as absorbed—made to vanish, so to speak—into the embodying space of the painting, where anatomical particularity holds sway. Anatomical particularity devolves to the viewer’s ultimate ex - clusion from the realm of visual lucidity. Precisely because one cannot avail oneself of any identiWcations with the painted Wgures—whose physicality obtrudes an alienating self-absorption as an obstacle to the viewer’s participation—the viewer’s frustration, in effect, Wgures a self- modifying distance. This brings us back to the Spinozian vantage point that appeared to be at risk earlier. After all, self-modifying distance is, for Spinoza, the crux of conative identity. Conative identity depends always on our attending to what is not already serving the needs of intelligibility. As Spinoza points out, there is no discomWting emotion (a plausible coun- terpart to self-absorbed embodiment) that does not, in its becoming known to us, instantiate a de facto modiWcation of our mind. By the same token, an embodied passion ceases to be a passion as soon as we form a clear and distinct idea of it (Spinoza, 197). And, according to Spinoza, “There is no modiWcation of the body that we cannot form a clear and distinct conception of” (198). In other words, mindedness is ineluctable in the pursuit of such mindlessness as the sex-image en - tices. For the call of any sensuous particularity entails the elaboration of the responsive intelligence, which knows itself all the more pur- posefully in that regard. I have already pointed out that while The Danes and Rotterdam might have been copied from the same page of pornographic pho- togravure, they exhibit distinctly “artful” (though equally impenetra- ble) surfaces that help us to Wnd rapport with this self-modifying ethos. It is worth noting that this links the pornographic content of the paint- ings to the art-historical forms and practices of high-culture painting, another of Currin’s self-reXexive jibes at simplistic mind/body distinc- tions. In The Danes the conspicuous underpainting and a building up of the surface of the canvas over what appears to be a black ground coheres with the explicit anatomical particularity of the action. The skin of the canvas coheres with the skin of the Wgures. That is, we can- not distinguish the canvas from the pigmented density built upon it. This has the effect of instantiating a curious coherence between the faces and the genitalia of the posers, as if the technical continuity could induce an anatomical continuity. Again, it closes us off from the action </page> <page sequence="13"> 176 ALAN SINGER as hermetically as does the circularity of the composition that I anat- omized earlier. I have already noted that in Rotterdam speciWcally, the mimicry of Dutch glazing invites us to see through, as if there were no medium, no mediation of the materiality of the Xesh, which is revealed in all the pores of its particularity. The challenge to the viewer’s atten- tion, desire notwithstanding, is corollary to the impossibility of iden- tifying with the physical pleasures of the Wgures precisely because they are so materially apparent. This effect is compounded by the Bronzino- like Wligree of the black lace glove (gaining purchase on the alabaster sheen of the penis) that is woven with just enough intricacy to “answer” the printed pattern of the bed sheets. The artist wittily teases a con - Xation of foreground and background precisely in the manner of Bronzino’s Eleonora of Toledo with Her Son Giovanni (1545),6 as if to obvi- ate the representational portent of the canvas altogether or to sexualize the inanimate background. These are equally perplexing prospects. So the art-historical density of the paintings’ ever more obtrusive tech- nical “Xair” compounds our phenomenological conundrum with re - spect to the lure of sensational experience. Where we do not know our footing, we do not stand still. We are on a de facto Spinozian specu- lative path of mindedness. In other words, in the case of both canvases we are made mind- ful of the sensuous immediacy as already mediated by our attention, albeit alienated but inexhaustible. The inexhaustibility of attention, after all, inheres in the virtually inWnite modiWcations to which attentiveness succumbs. Where identiWcations are thwarted by the self-absorption of the ever more meticulously manifest Wgures, the mind is drawn, almost by default, to contemplate with ever more effort the reasons it might give itself for such attentiveness. The surface of these paintings of the most animate surfaces of human physicality—penis and cli- toris—is so exposed to our view that we can neither participate in the action represented by following ever more attentively the ever more meticulously detailed sources of excitement, or generalize its meaning- fulness: which is to say we cannot take it all in. We confront something like a horizon of proliferating particulars. It limns physical arousal, thus inciting thought about the gap between sensation and conceptu- alization. Even more to the point, it makes consciousness of the incom- mensurability of sensation and conceptualization a self-perpetuating preoccupation with what cannot, after all, be self-possessed. Because </page> <page sequence="14"> REVERSE ANTHROPOMORPHISM 177 the seemingly inWnite and equally engrossing extensive particularities to which our attention is called are all the more inescapable for their lucidity, we might say that the extensive register of our viewing con- stitutes an imperative to attend all the more intensively. In other words, the particular and the general, or the sensational and the conceptual, are rendered curiously continuous in the awareness of ourselves as paying attention. We are compelled, by the elaborately worked sur- faces of the canvases, to take the “all” in without any possibility of grasping that all. This kind of attentiveness constitutes a mental, as opposed to a merely physical, activity that, as we know all too well and all too ironically, remains the ostensible subject matter of the paintings. Moreover, in Currin’s case, the physicality represented, because it excites such an irrepressible attentiveness, belies what might other- wise appear to be merely the ontological autonomy of embodiment. The physicality on display is never just a mental object for the viewer of Currin’s paintings, as it might be if we readily experienced or found pretext enough for identiWcation with what we were looking at. The graphic physicality is never just a mental object because mentality knows itself to be persisting by its very resistance to the impenetra- bility of the canvas, manifested in subject matter and technique (techne). In the end, attention trumps identiWcation in Currin’s rendition of the sex-image. As a result, the viewer’s mental attentiveness to what is, in effect, a horizon of proliferating particularity, is roughly correlative to the very physical activity from which the viewer has apparently been excluded. The reverse anthropomorphic impulse devolves to the self-modiWcations of the viewer in a way that mitigates any clear dis- tinction between the Wgured bodies and the contemplative mind of the viewer. Perhaps it also mitigates any clear distinction between the viewer’s own aroused embodiment and any conative cognizance of it. I am not speaking of voyeurism here but of what Spinoza might call the labor per se of self-explanation. We will recall that conatus for Spinoza is, in effect, the persistence of being. Conatus is coordinate with desire, as we have already understood it: “a determination by some given modiWcation of the self.” I am arguing, in a Spinozian spirit, that ethical traction in human thought derives from the kind of self- modiWcations that attentiveness to the bodies Wgured in the sex-image induces. I suppose I am suggesting that in Currin’s paintings, the mind is functionally a proxy for the absent/alienated body of the viewer. </page> <page sequence="15"> 178 ALAN SINGER Correlatively, the painted body on the canvas is a proxy for the mind, by thwarting the viewer’s identiWcation and by its consequent precip- itation of further self-modiWcations. In Ethics, Spinoza speaks of a “body capable of many things” as proof of a mind of “which the greatest part is eternal” (215). Not coin- cidentally, Spinoza’s God is deemed to be eternal not by his inWnity but “in so far as he can be explained . . . through the essence of human mind considered under a species of eternity” (213). Well, risking either heresy or absurdity as I know I am doing at this moment, I want to say that the viewer’s experience of the Currin canvases intimates something like self-consideration under a species of eternity. This is the case insofar as the persistence of attention compelled by the paint- ings is inescapably a recurrence of mind to the site of its bodily animus. Of course, the body is not causal or even ultimately rendered knowable in its functions according to Spinoza. But in Currin’s paintings, and in those of many contemporary artists for whom the sex-image is an armature, the body is a counter for knowing how to attend more pro- ductively to the mind that feels the excitement of its modiWcations. Given the reverse anthropomorphism of identiWcations, thwarted by the self-absorbed physicality of the sex-image, the viewer is altered: he or she is rendered the self-mediating persistence of his or her desire to Wgure the body in the exertions of a fallible mentality. Currin himself says of the sex-image paintings that he thought it would be interesting to make them explicit, to see if there was any mystery, any “space left after you [the viewer] completely drain[s] the potential. It’s like when you don’t show things, you build up a kind of voltage. So what happens if you totally open it up? Is the painting to have any kind of energy at all? In a way these are very unsexual paintings” (Usborne). I am therefore suggesting that the energy that animates these paintings is precisely not an index of what they show. Rather, it is an occasion for the mind to show itself through the self- modiWcations that the physical impenetrability of the painted Wgures Wgure in their turn. Such activity for Spinoza is of course always the true measure of the vitality of conatus, where I maintain that the “energy” of Currin’s paintings most fruitfully discharges itself. Alan Singer is the author of Wve books in the areas of critical theory and aesthetics, most recently The Self-Deceiving Muse: Notice and Knowledge </page> <page sequence="16"> REVERSE ANTHROPOMORPHISM 179 in the Work of Art (2011). He is the author of numerous articles on human agency and art practices. The present article is part of a work in progress tentatively titled “Posing Sex: A Perceptual Ethics.” He is professor of English at Temple University. Notes 1. Two enduring works on the allegorical underpinnings of anthropomor- phism offer a rich context for the remarks that follow: Angus Fletcher’s Allegory: Theory of a Symbolic Mode and Eric Auerbach’s essay “Figura,” originally published in Scenes from the Drama of European Literature. 2. Here I should make the point that my thinking follows Auerbach’s inti- mation that there is temporal continuity between allegory and Wgura. 3. Fauconnier and Turner, in their increasingly inXuential How We Think, estab- lish ground for my assertion that the sex-image is exemplary for inquiry into the fundamental stakes of personhood. They stipulate that sexuality is an “epitome of meaningful behavior” because it unites psychology, biology, and social life. 4. With this line of discussion I am drawing a contrast with a fairly wide- spread treatment of Currin’s sex-images as a variety of postmodern play with genre. This view indulges what is for me an overly simplistic irony with regard to the discrepancies between form and context. See, for example, Rosenblum. 5. Berger does not make a distinction between the Wgure and the face. They are bound in the very expressive gesture each presupposes with respect to the other. The face gives purpose to the body. The body is the medium of the inten- tionality inscribed in facial expression. 6. The conspicuous and frequently discussed effect of the portrait of Eleonora is the counterintuitive blending of foreground and background. Bronzino performs this blending in a manner that plays the minutely rendered detail of abstract design off against the warrant for expressiveness that is presupposed both in the genre of portraiture and in the competing detail of facial expression. Bronzino renders the painting a visual Weld that is at odds with the parameters of generic intelligibility. Works Cited Auerbach, Erich. 1973.
