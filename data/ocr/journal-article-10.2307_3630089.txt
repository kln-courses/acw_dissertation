ANTHROPOLOGY AND ARCHITECTURE are strange bedfellows; their relationship has never been made very clear. Yet culture and environment are interrelated, interwoven, and integrated; they invariably complement each other. It was in the first half of the nineteenth century, through the works of Gottfried Semper and Eugene Emmanuel Viollet-le-duc, both architects, that cultural and an- thropological aspects of architecture were brought to focus. Scholarship in architecture, which was then confined to monumentality and practically blind to anything outside of Greek, Egyptian, and European activity, was exposed to a much more diverse architectural world than previously considered. Ar- chitects and architectural historians became aware of culture, technology, and domestic architecture other than palaces, as well as the people who inhabited the buildings. Anthropologists who first looked carefully at the built environment were Lewis Henry Morgan and Victor Mindeleff, who included the built environ- ment in reconstructing the sociocultural reality of some groups of North Ameri- can Indians. The relationship between architecture and anthropology, how- ever, remains asymmetrical. For most students of architecture, rhetoric rules over substantial issues of culture, society, and technology. For most anthro- pologists, on the other hand, the built environment poses a problem of scale. Another source of difficulty lies in their lack of understanding of architectural form. Prussin is an architect and an architectural historian with long field experi- ence in Africa. The territory covered by her and by contributors such as Amina Adan, Peter A. Andrews, Arlene Fullerton, Anders Grum, and Uta Holter (Journal of Anthropological Research, vol. 52, 1996) 355</page><page sequence="2">356 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea and also includes the high- lands of Ethiopia and the Great Rift Valley. This nomadic milieu spreads over three biogeographical zones wherein landscapes vary from sparse vegetation to an almost lunar appearance on a topography changing from a rocky plateau to pebbly plain. Terrain is rugged, while distances between food and water sources, for both nomads and animals, are great. Fully aware of these fragile environmental conditions, the nomad must calculate every move with great precision so that existence and well-being are not endangered. Migratory pat- terns, settlement, and movement in rhythm with climatic and environmental changes are essential to sustaining ecological equilibrium. The nomadic lifestyle, which demands a constant perceptual rearticulation of little-differentiated environments, facilitates differentiated cognitive styles as well as "field-independence." For the African nomad, technology and art are inseparable and related to the Arabic word for creation (sun). Sina'ah, which means both technology and art, is used in a manner very similar to the original meaning of the Greek word techne. In addition to materials, tools, and skills, sina'ah, employed in architectural activity, includes ideologies of soci- ety, collective ritual, and symbolic meaning. Prussin weaves the material from different disciplines such as psychology, etymology, anthropology, ethnogra- phy, and history into a broad perspective, thereby producing a credible archi- tectural history of the African nomad. Her scholarship and analysis are com- mensurate with the resourcefulness and creativity of the nomadic women she is studying. Nomadic women's thorough understanding and tasteful handling of mate- rial are exhibited in constructing the armature of the tent, weaving the shukkaaba (mat for the tent roof) or the ugar-ti-haru (small sisal bag) or the milk container, or decorating the camel saddle. Their artful design skills are also displayed in embroidery motifs on the long tunics worn by men and old women. Prussin responds to the architecture she is investigating with sensi- tivity and care. She argues that ritual endows the built environment with mean- ing. Poetic and moral judgments are provided by the belief systems and cosmologies, which are "in turn expressed through, related to, the ensembles of artifacts and their structure in space, to orientation in space, and to the interface between tent and transport technologies" (p. 46). The building de- signer and the transportation engineer are one and the same, and it is the woman. The gender division of labor is clear in a nomadic society. A comprehensive architectural study should cover every aspect of the phe- nomena which contribute to the materialization of the final form. It would show how architecture, its components, and related artifacts work, how they function in the context of their environment and culture. When there is a change either in external form or inner nature, a major shift is occurring in society. The vernacular architecture of African nomadism consists of respon- sive, transformable, and mobile dwellings as a result of collective ritual wherein the arts merge with technology. This stands in contrast to individuality, monu- mentality, and permanence which characterize the architecture of many other</page><page sequence="3">ANTHROPOLOGY AND ARCHITECTURE 357 social conditions. In the case of the nomadic existence, sedentarization is the reason for spatial change, and with spatial change comes change in the divi- sion of labor. Slightly more elaboration on the relationship between social and spatial change would have been useful, but discussions presented in several chapters allow the reader to reflect on these issues. All the visual material has been carefully selected to be informative and to complement the text. The drawings deserve special praise. Coupled with the scholarly and penetrating text, they constitute a significant contribution to a field which is in need of guidance. This book-a visually pleasing, substan- tially effective, and scholarly structured form-is no less an achievement than nomadic architecture. African Nomadic Architecture will be with us a long time, both as a learning experience and as an inspiration. Nold Egenter is a Swiss architect, ethnologist, and architectural anthro- pologist who spent ten years in Japan exploring the temporary cultic struc- tures used during local festivals in the region of Omihachiman near Lake Biwa. His field investigation included the sculptural objects, all related to the cult system of the village deity, which were the center of attention of cultic festi- vals. Originally published in German, Egenter's important research on Japa- nese folk Shinto became available in English after a fourteen-year delay through the fine translation of Joyce Engel-Cowper. This is a special edition apart from the publisher's Research Series in Architectural Anthropology. The Research Series is very much associated with the book under consideration, however, for all eight volumes published thus far are the results of Egenter's research on "subhuman architecture," "domestic architecture," "cultural and architec- tural anthropology," and "semantic architecture." With the present volume and the others in the Research Series, Egenter formulates an architectural theory which is anthropologically founded and which he hopes will fill the missing link between architecture and anthropology. The subject matter of this survey is the folk beliefs associated with Japa- nese folk Shinto. The author contends that there is a stratum of animism (tree and stone worship) in this cult. Many local festivals involve the construction of temporary structures out of plant materials (grass, twigs, bamboo, reeds, and the like) assembled by tying and plaiting. These mostly temporary struc- tures are associated with the local shrine. The art of Shinto construction is primarily of a symbolic nature, produced for ritualistic (ideological) reasons. It is also hedonic because of the pleasure it conveys to the participants in the ritual. Both of these aspects are communal rather than individual. Social cus- toms dictate the physical expression given to the structures. Most of the cult monuments investigated are columnar structures with heights varying from half a meter to ten meters, though some are as tall as twenty meters. They are basically two-tiered: the lower half is structurally rigid, stiffened by bound bundles, and anchored to the ground, in some cases with very elaborate secondary structures. The upper half contrasts with the lower half: it is flexible, loose, and unbound, moving freely with the wind. For these structures to stand even temporarily, they must be constructed this</page><page sequence="4">358 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH way, especially in an earthquake region such as Japan. Given the environmen- tal and structural requirements cited, how and at what point do the structures secure symbolic power? Egenter argues that the "relative symbolism" in dif- ferent forms-anthropomorphic, biomorphic, technomorphic, mythical, cos- mic, sexual, etc.-follows the "tectonic primacy," rather than the other way around. Gottfried Semper's influence on Egenter is felt throughout the book, specifically on matters concerning tectonics and "primordial forms" in archi- tecture (e.g., Semper 1989). A major focus of the study is the tectonics of the folk Shinto structures and the symbolism of the monuments. There seems to be a large variety of forms, sometimes geometrical in character, reflecting different realms of life. For example, many reflect technomorphous (ships) or biomorphous (tree, bird, snake, human) shapes or assume mythical forms (dragon, giant). The struc- tures exhibit fine craftsmanship with respect for and understanding of the materials employed. Behind the richness and diversity of cultural and sym- bolic imagery are some general principles of communication. While language definitely is a major constituent of communication, the visual representation realized in three-dimensional sculptural objects such as these cult monuments is another important component. Egenter argues that the material tradition rather than the ideological tradi- tion better preserves the most ancient circumstances. To reconstruct the an- cient sociocultural reality, Egenter identifies the different layers of tectonic development. Forms and the tectonics of the cultic objects, which Egenter believes were originally part of a marking system, communicate about the society that produced them. The two-tiered monuments represent "the union of irreconcilable opposites in a single form" (p. 48, Fig. 43). Egenter reads this as the concept by which ancient man comprehended the world. This is an unusual book on at least two accounts. First, the cultic objects studied are, for the most part, not habitable and therefore not strictly speak- ing architectural. However, this should not disqualify these mainly symbolic structures from being investigated on tectonic terms. Building as sign and symbol is comprehensible from a conventional point of view. Recognition of aesthetic and tectonic value in the material products, regardless of their highly symbolic nature, and focus on tectonics, geometry, and meaning of the cultic structures, rather than on their essential power as objects, are all very appro- priate within an architectural discourse, as well as an anthropological one. Therefore, this study cannot be classified within the boundaries of conven- tional architectural or anthropological research. This is the second character- istic that places the book outside the mainstream of either discipline. Semantic and Symbolic Architecture is generously illustrated with drawings, photographs, diagrams, plans which supplement the field data, methodologi- cal discussions, and interpretations. The textual and visual material consti- tute a wealth of information, making the book an indispensable source. The lack of an index and an overwhelming abundance of information, which could have benefited from a different kind of organization, does not make for easy</page><page sequence="5">ANTHROPOLOGY AND ARCHITECTURE 359 reading. The author manages to get his message across, though not without raising more questions about methodology and separating the material tradi- tion from everything else in the society. An issue that needs to be discussed further is the relation between the symbolic and the tectonic, between the material and the spiritual. With all the questions his study raises, Egenter is pursuing a healthy debate in an area not very frequently visited by either architects or anthropologists. Like the Prussin volume, this is a welcome con- tribution in the reconstruction of sociocultural reality, including religion and social structure through the analysis of material structures.
