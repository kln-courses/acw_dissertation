<plain_text><page sequence="1">Golding's Englished Metamorphoses Raphael Lyne He begins by metamorphosing Ovid: by turning the sophisticated Roman into a ruddy country gentleman with tremendous gusto ... and a gift for energetic doggerel. If the Latin mentions Midas's 'tiara', Golding calls it a 'purple nightcap'. The exotic 'harpe' of Perseus, the curved blade so special it had a special name, becomes a good English 'wood-knife'.1 Golding's Ovid has regularly attracted slightly patronizing affection from twentieth-century critics and editors.2 Gordon Braden, in the best recent study, provides an account of the translation as an Elizabethan Ovid of a particular kind: the product of an intellectual mediocrity with a certain charm, which is characteristically Elizabethan without having much in common with Elizabethan genius.3 Anthony Brian Taylor has uncovered the extensive debts owed to Golding by Shakespeare and others, while being careful to avoid over-enthusiasm about the transla- tion's quality.4 For many modern readers this Metamorphoses (in the form of extracted passages) is raw material, a 'typical Elizabethan' base- camp from which Shakespeare starts his ascent of the creative heights. If Golding's is indeed a typical Elizabethan reading of Ovid, then this is a strange place to leave it. Such a conclusion might be expected to encourage more study of the details of his technique and interpretation. And Golding does indeed transpose the stories of the Metamorphoses into English culture in a way which provides insights into the relationship between the English Renaissance and Latin sources. He uses a language of heightened Englishness, and his versions of Ovidian myths are often filled with highly English scenery, characters, and ideas. Golding often replaces Latin realia - textual units with strong and specific cultural associations - with English equivalents, rather than attempting to cap- ture the original in paraphrase.5 At times it seems as if a characteristically Elizabethan wish to promote his national culture leads him, in effect, to reinvent Ovid as the author of very English stories. A term employed on the title pages of many English Renaissance rÂ»3</page><page sequence="2">184 Golding's Englished Metamorphoses translations is 'Englished'. This should perhaps alert us to the large-scale appropriation of the source that is envisaged.6 Florio's Montaigne is described as 'done into English', and Samuel Daniel's introductory poem in praise of this work evokes a particular version of the translation pro- cess in its deployment (or probably coinage) of the word 'transpassage': and glad I stand So neere to him whom I do so much love, T'applaude his happie setling in our land: And safe transpassage by his studious care Who both of him and us doth merit much, Having as sumptuously, as he is rare Plac'd him in the best lodging of our speech. And made him now as free, as if borne here, And as well ours as theirs. (45-53)7 The process involves, in effect, a reinvention (or rediscovery) of the source author as an English writer. Golding makes a similar statement in his Preface: And now I have him made so well acquainted with our toong As that he may in English verse as in his owne bee soong. (I77-8)8 Daniel describes a more complete transposition, as the writer and his work are seen 'setling' in England, although the word 'lodging' may carry a sense of impermanence. Golding's 'acquainted' is less hyperbolic but nevertheless also suggests that the text which emerges from the transla- tion process belongs to its new home, and has a degree of independence from its Latin source. Golding's is a faithful version of the Metamor- phoses, but it is one which seems paradoxically keen to show its English- ness. This English Renaissance imitator of the classics wishes to take advantage of the Latin text while establishing a certain independence of it. In the examples of Golding's Englishing of the Metamorphoses which follow, this dichotomy will be seen in action. 'Latin had of course no literary dialects', writes Robert Coleman in the introduction to his edition of Virgil's Eclogues: 'so in an effort to repro- duce something of the effect of Theocritus' Doric Virgil puts into the mouths of his herdsmen colloquial and archaic forms and idioms redolent of</page><page sequence="3">Raphael Lyne 185 rural dialects.' Coleman admits, though, that this attempt to ruralize language may be partly illusory: 'although such ['rural'] forms [as 'hedus' for 'haedus'] are often attested in our manuscripts, they may reflect late Latin pronunciation rather than the rusticity of the classical period'.9 At any rate, Latin literary language had a distinctive antipathy to dialects. The other Italic languages had long become obsolete, and regional pronunciation had no status in literature or rhetoric. Greek dialects (Doric in the tragic chorus, Ionic in historical prose, and so on), by contrast, had a literary identity.10 One consequence is that in fiction, characters such as shepherds or foreigners, whose language would really have been far removed from literary Latin or not Latin at all, neverthe- less speak the literary language acceptably. Ovid's Metamorphoses roam throughout the known world, without reflecting different dialects. When Arthur Golding came to translate the poem, however, he added linguis- tic variation at several points. When the Romans seek a solution to a plague in Greece, an Epidauran priest proclaims the arrival of the God in unusual accents: And with his presence he did shake The Altar, shryne, doores, marble floore, and roofe all layd with gold, And vauncing up his brest he stayd ryght stately to behold Amid the Church, and round about his fyrye eyes he rold. The sight did fray the people. But the wyvelesse preest (whoose heare Was trussed in a fayre whyght Call) did know the God was there. And sayd: Behold, tiz God, tiz God. (XV, 750-6) Adventuque suo signumque, arasque, foresque, Marmoreumque solum, fastigiaque aurea movit, Pectoribusque tenus media sublimis in aede Constitit, atque oculos circuntulit igne micantes. Territa turba pavet, cognovit numina castus Evinctus vitta crines albente sacerdos. En Deus est, Deus est. (XV, 671-7) (At his coming the statue, altars, doors, the marble pavement and gilded roof, all rocked. Then, raised breast-high in the temple's midst, he stood and gazed about with eyes flashing fire. The terri- fied multitude quaked with fear; but the chaste priest, with his hair bound with a white fillet, recognised the divinity and cried: 'The god! behold the god!')11</page><page sequence="4">1 86 Golding's Englished Metamorphoses It is only an exchange of V for V, but it makes this scene all the more marvellous and unfamiliar. It may not be a coincidence that the addition of an accent here accompanies a mythical event different from many in the Metamorphoses. It represents a meeting between a huge, frightening serpent-god and (importantly) historical human society - rather than an encounter in a wood between mythical individuals and anthropomorphic divinities. Golding finds an efficient way of registering the shock of the divine appearance. The prelude to another strange and violent event, in Book XI, again involves the introduction of a regional accent: As Caeyx of his brothers chaunce this wondrous story seth, Commes ronning thither all in haste and almost out of breth Anaetor the Phocayan who was Pelyes herdman. Hee Sayd: Pelye Pelye, I doe bring sad tydings unto thee. Declare it man (quoth Peleus) what ever that it bee. King Ceyx at his fearefull woordes did stande in dowtfull stowne. This noonetyde (quoth the herdman) Iche did drive your cattell downe To zea, and zum a them did zit uppon the yellow zand And looked on the large mayne poole of water neare at hand.

(XI, 404-18) Quae dum Lucifero genitus miracula narrat De consorte suo, cursu festinus anhelo Advolat armenti custos Phocaeus Anetor, Et Peleu, Peleu, magnae tibi nuntius adsum Cladis ait, quodcunque ferat, iubet edere Peleus.

Nereides, Nereusque tenent, hos navita ponti Edidit esse Deos, dum retia littore siccat. (XI, 346-62) (While the son of Lucifer was telling this marvellous story of his brother, Phocian Onetor, Peleus' herdsman, came running in with breathless haste, crying: 'Peleus, Peleus! I come to tell you dread- ful news.' Peleus bade him tell his news, while the Trachinian king himself waited in trembling anxiety. The herdsman went on: 'I had driven the weary herd down to the curving shore when the high sun was midway in his course, beholding as much behind him as still lay before. A part of the cattle had kneeled down upon the yellow sands, and lying there were looking out upon the broad, level sea; part was wandering slowly here and there, while others still swam out and stood neck-deep in water. A temple stood near the sea, not resplendent with marble and gold, but made of heavy timbers, and shaded by an ancient grove. The place was sacred to Nereus and the Nereids (these a sailor told me were the gods of that sea, as he dried his nets on the shore).9) In subsequent lines, when a fearsome wolf arrives, Golding uses even more arcane vocabulary than usual - 'orped', 'buskling', 'dabauken', 'glaster' - and emphasizes that the speaker here is both Phocian and a herdsman. The entry of a rustic voice into the court of King Peleus (or now 'Pelye') results in greater linguistic variety in English than in Latin. The fundamental change from V and 'f to 'z' and V is one of the basic features of the West Country accent that has become the stereotype of rustic simplicity. Peter Trudgill dates these shifts to a development in the Middle Ages which affects the whole of the south of England, and which persists longest in Somerset and Devon.12 The Oxford Companion to the English Language mentions the theatrical convention of 'Mummerset' in which the 'z' and V are central to a stage accent used to denote a kind of universal rusticity.13 (However, other aspects of this accent, such as lengthened vowels and mutations of the verb 'to be' such as 'bain't', are not found in Golding's Metamorphoses,) These are by no means the only such words in Golding's translation. The case of 'Iche', used instead of Golding's normal T, is more unusual. OED identifies it as an Anglo-Saxon form, used sometimes by Chaucer and Skelton, but during the Renaissance it was identified with West Country speech.14 The story of Battus tells of a rustic turned by Mercury</page><page sequence="6">1 88 Golding's Englished Metamorphoses into a stone for his deceit, and it too has an added accent in Golding's version. Mercury asks him to keep the secret of where he has hidden a herd of cattle, but returns in disguise to test him: So Mercurie did seeme to go his way. Annon he commes me backe againe, and altred both in speche And outward shape, saide: Countrieman Ich heartely bezeche, And if thou zawest any kie come royling through this grounde, Or driven away, tell what he was and where they may be vownde. And I chill gethee vor thy paine an Hecfar and hir match. The Carle perceyving double gaine, and greedy for to catch, Sayde: Under yon same hill they were, and under yon same hill Cham zure they are, and with his hand he pointed thereuntill. At that Mercurius laughing saide: False knave, and doste bewray Me to my selfe? doste thou bewray me to my selfe I say? (ii, 867-77) Simulat love natus abire. Mox redit, et versa pariter cum voce flgura, Rustice vidisti si quas hoc limite, dixit, Ire boves, fer opem, furtoque silentia deme. Iuncta suo pariter dabitur tibi foemina tauro. At senior postquam est merces geminata, sub illis Montibus inquit, erant, et erant sub montibus illis. Risit Atlantiades, et me mihi perfide prodis, Me mihi prodis, ait? (II, 697-704) (The son of Jove pretended to go away, but soon came back with changed voice and form, and said: 'My good fellow, if you have seen any cattle going along this way, help me out, and don't refuse to tell me about it, for they were stolen. I'll give you a cow and a bull into the bargain if you'll tell.' The old man, tempted by the double reward, said: 'You'll find them over there at the foot of that mountain.' And there, true enough, they were. Mercury laughed him to scorn and said: 'Would you betray me to myself, you rogue? me to my very face?') Again the West Country characteristics are evident. Here the use of 'Ich' is combined with verbs deriving from this form: 'I chill' for a contracted 'Ich will', and 'cham' for 'Ich am'. There is also a rustic contraction of 'give thee' to 'gethee' (872). By contrast, Ovid's Mercury-in-disguise</page><page sequence="7">Raphael Lyne 189 forms the equivalent line (701) into an elegant hexameter: 'iuncta suo pretium dabitur tibi femina tauro'. He places the verb in a central posi- tion, and separates words in agreement: 'femina' from 'iuncta', 'tauro' from 'suo'.15 It is also significant that Ovid does not bother to specify what kind of voice Mercury adopts: it is enough simply to say that the voice was different. Golding, on the other hand, decides that the most effective means for Mercury to gull Battus would be for him to assume some rustic tones, and changes the scene accordingly. The linguistic modes of Battus and the herdsman include aspects of a specific and recognizable English rural accent. But the obvious effect is more general - to convey differences between the ways different charac- ters speak. This is certainly the effect in the portrayal of the foreign priest, where there is no attempt to create a full foreign accent or another language altogether. It is fitting that Golding adapts Ovid in this way. One consequence of Latin tending not to register regional variations in pronunciation was that an even clearer case could be made for its superiority over Renaissance vernaculars. Allowing differently-Latined figures a separate mode of expression created a space for the English language to express itself. Golding's Metamorphoses employs a language which differs from Latin in its variety. He also seems to attempt a language which is height- ened specifically in its Englishness. The way he introduces the story of Arachne involves a distinct 'Englishing' of the passage: And therewithall she purposed to put the Lydian Maide Arachne to hir neckeverse who (as had to hir been saide) Presumed to prefer hir selfe before hir noble grace In making cloth. (VI, 7-10) Maeoniaeque animum fatis intendit Arachnes, Quam sibi lanificae non cedere laudibus artis Audierat. (VI, 5-7) (She turned her mind to the fate of Maeonian Arachne, who she had heard would not yield to her the palm in the art of spinning and weaving wool.) Golding immediately sets out the character of the contest that will follow: Minerva clearly intends to reassert her supremacy. The enjambement of the crucial words 'In making cloth' emphasizes the separation between</page><page sequence="8">1 90 Golding ys Englished Metamorphoses the foolish action and the high violence of divine retribution. Never- theless the seriousness of Arachne's arrogance is clear. Ovid typically restricts himself to a plainer narrative introduction. It is the addition of the word 'neckeverse' that makes most difference.16 At one level the analogy is spurious, a loosely conceived approximation of the original. However, Golding reworks the Ovidian situation vividly. Reference to 'neckeverse' taps into a contemporary range of ideas about fraudulent claims to high position (and about threats of execution) which add to this mythical interlude a more direct emotional frame of reference. It may well be entirely fair to say that this is not 'faithful' to the spirit of Ovid, but as 'Englishing' it adds considerable intensity to the episode.17 One of the most distinctive features of Golding's translation is this tendency to evoke not classical scenery, but rather realiay like 'neckeverse', from closer to home. For example, the world of Golding's Metamorphoses has a markedly Christian look. This ranges in scale from brief conspicuous phrases, as when Envy mumbles a 'Divels Paternoster' to herself,18 to Christianized characters and settings. At times Golding allows areas of contemporary controversy to surface. The stories are sited not in some generalized Christian world but rather in one where familiar objects and issues are prominent. This is seen in the description of Perseus' fight with Phineus and his men at Perseus' wedding. Golding's translation emphasizes the religious setting in various ways and Christianizes cer- tain aspects. In the first sequence of fighting, Ovid has the altar central in the action: Phineus hides behind it and evades Perseus' dart; Perseus picks up a smouldering brand from the altar and smashes it into the face of beautiful Athis; and Emathion dies horribly right on top of it: In the throng there was an auncient man and such A one as loved righteousnesse and greatly feared God: Emathion called was his name: whome sith his yeares forbad To put on armes, he feights with tongue, inveying earnestly Against that wicked war the which he banned bitterly. As on the Altar he himselfe with quivering handes did stay, One Cromis tipped off his head: his head cut off streight way Upon the Altar fell, and there his tongue not fully dead, Did bable still the banning wordes the which it erst had sed, And breathed forth his fainting ghost among the burning brandes. (V, 120-9) Fuit et grandaeuus in illis Emathion, aequi cultor, timidusque Deorum, Qui quoniam prohibent anni bellare, loquendo</page><page sequence="9">Raphael Lyne 191 Pugnat, et incessit scelerataque devovet arma. Huic Cromis amplexo tremulis altaria palmis Decutit ense caput, quod protinus incidit arae Atque ibi semianimis verba execrantia lingua Edidit, et medios animam expiravit in ignes. (V, 99-106) (Amid the throng was one old man, Emathion, who loved justice and revered the gods. He, since his years forbade warfare, fought with the tongue, and strode forward and cursed their impious arms. As he clung to the altar-horns with age-enfeebled hands Chromis struck off his head with his sword: the head fell straight on the altar, and there the still half-conscious tongue kept up its execrations and the life was breathed out in the midst of the altar-fires.) The picture of a man 'as loved righteousnesse and greatly feared God9 gives a Christian tone to the virtues of the Latin Emathion. Ovid finishes this episode with a nicely balanced tableau ('animam expiravit9 placed appropriately in 'medios ... ignes') relying mainly on the power of 'animam' to keep the rhetorical temperature high. Golding's 'fainting ghost' and alliterative 'burning brands' characteristically preserve a note of passion and indignation at this gruesome death. The altars in Ovid and Golding both provide an incongruous and unpleasant setting for battle. But however well the words 'altaria' and 'ara' are matched by 'altar' (as they are in all contemporary dictionaries), their associations for the two poets' audiences are different, and this makes the translation complex. Golding enjoyed the patronage of the Earl of Leicester, who has often been associated with 'puritan' attitudes.19 What may be meant by 'altar' in his translation relates to an important religious controversy in Elizabethan England. Extravagantly decorated altars were among the principal Catholic trappings attacked by those enforcing adherence to reformed values. Restrictions on them were even more stringent than in the time of Edward VI.20 Visitation Articles of the period tend to use the word 'altar' to denote Catholic excesses and 'table' for the plain and worthy replacements.21 Thus the idea of a Christian altar, and an idea of what Ovid may mean by an altar, co-operate as parts of the reader's response, Golding's term invoking a complex area of religious dispute. The word 'altar' was perhaps unavoidable for Golding here, but the wider context of this passage reinforces these points. The figure of Alphit the priest (his name now in de-Latinized form) is depicted wearing potentially significant clothing:</page><page sequence="10">192 Golding's Englished Metamorphoses And so was Alphit, Ceres Priest, that ware upon his crowne A stately Miter faire and white with Tables hanging downe. (V, 133-4) Cererisque Sacerdos Alphitus albenti velatus tempora vitta (V, 109-10) (Alphitus, Ceres' priest, his temples wreathed with white fillets.) Golding's 'Tables' (perhaps a misprint - his second edition has 'Labelles')22 recall the Ovidian 'vitta', but Golding adds the 'Miter' and in doing so partially re-creates Alphitus as a recognizable Christian bishop. That this is not simply an ungainly insertion of incongruous detail is suggested by the controversial aspects of such reference to priestly vest- ments. As Patrick Collinson has written: 'on few issues did lay prejudice find such forceful expression as in the rejection of the surplice and square cap'.23 Elizabethan policy trod a difficult path between the tradi- tion of Catholic adornment on one side, and extremists who opposed any form of religious embellishment, including clothing which differentiated clergy from their flocks.24 Hence a Royal Injunction of 1559 advocated the wearing of square caps by bishops 'not thereby meaning to attribute any holiness or special worthiness to the said garments, but, as St. Paul writeth, Omnia decenter et secundum ordinem fiant (1 Cor. xiv. cap.)'.25 Bearing in mind how the term 'miter' was used at the time to refer to exotic head-gear in general, it is possible to see in Golding's translation complementary processes of familiarization and defamiliarization. On the one hand this is clearly an exotic mythical scene and the word could refer to some outlandish vestment. On the other, this is a recognizable bishop- figure standing in front of an altar. These objects of Christian religion are defiled in this episode by a bloody battle and the culture clash accentuates the defilement. All this is effected by Golding's employment of words with powerful English associations. Golding's Christianization of scenery extends also to architecture, and classical temples are given a more English shape. The appearance of Elizabethan church buildings was strictly regulated by the Protestant authorities. It was decreed they should be modest, whitewashed, and with rushes or straw on the floor.26 The tale of Baucis and Philemon and the transformation of their humble house into a church shows the priori- ties of Ovid and his translator diverging visibly:</page><page sequence="11">Raphael Lyne 193 the old poore Cote so base Whereof they had beene owners erst, became a Church. The proppes Were turned into pillars huge. The straw uppon the toppes Was yellow, so that all the roof did seeme of burnisht gold: The floor e with Marble paved was. The doores on eyther fold Were graven. (VIII, 878-83) Ilia vetus dominis, et iam casa parva duobus, Vertitur in templum, furcas subiere columnae, Stramina flavescunt, aurataque tecta videntur, Caelataque fores, adopertaque marmore tellus. (VIII, 699-702) (That old house of theirs, which had been small even for its two occupants, was changed into a temple. Marble columns took the place of the forked wooden supports; the straw grew yellow and became a golden roof; there were gates richly carved, a marble pavement covered the ground.) Golding changes Ovid's temple into a church and modifies the trans- lation so that the description steers away from excesses.27 This tale has a highly celebratory conclusion in Ovid, whose readership would have seen the adornment of the temple as a much more fitting celebration of the couple's worth than sixteenth-century Protestants. For them the gold and decoration could dilute the positive moral of the story, which in its examination of the rewards of humility has a decidedly Protestant edge. Accordingly, while the translation is close, the details are crucially changed. Ovid allows the transformation of straw into gold to be ambi- guous: 'flavescunt' implies transformation, but 'videntur' allows for the possibility that this could be an apparent rather than actual metamorphosis. Golding's 'was yellow' and 'seeme' make it clearer that there is no real gold involved. Likewise the Latin 'caelatae' describes the engraved deco- ration with the added sense of adornment;28 the English 'graven' is less extravagant and suggests wood rather than rich metal.29 These are very minor changes, but in presenting a church which would reflect the taste of his readership, Golding's relocations clarify how the tale is to be read. The construction of new churches was not, in fact, a phenomenon familiar to Golding's readers. The first new church in England since the Reformation did not appear until 1578, and it was built (though never fully completed) at Denbigh in North Wales by the patron of Golding's Ovid, the Earl of Leicester. The dimensions of Leicester's church were</page><page sequence="12">194 Golding's Englished Metamorphoses huge - in the words of the most complete recent account, it was 'easily the largest church erected in Britain between the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the rebuilding of St PauPs Cathedral'.30 In this respect it was rather different from the country church of Baucis and Philemon, although the 'pillars huge' in Golding's description tend towards a larger scale. However, Leicester's image as an austere Protestant was evident in the church. As Butler says (p. 51), there was 'a complete absence of super- fluous decoration'. Derek Wilson (p. 172) says it was 'designed to reflect Protestant doctrines and to be the setting of a simpler, non-ritualistic liturgy'. It is no surprise that Leicester chooses a grand style even for his self-presentation as a model Protestant. It is also not surprising that Golding's church (prompted by Ovid) has a straw roof: a touch of simple austerity of which the Denbigh church falls short. These two churches relate only tenuously as facets of puritan self-presentation, but the existence of Leicester's edifice (and the non-existence of others) casts a tantalizing light upon Golding's depiction of the strange spectacle of a new-grown church. As well as altering ('Englishing') scenes of mainstream religion, Golding translates episodes of more subversive and unusual content (particularly Bacchic rituals and witchcraft) in such a way as to evoke contemporary life. The beginning of Book IV, introducing the story of Minyas' daugh- ters, shows how this can allow the translator to convey a moral opinion: Yet would not stout Alcithoe, Duke Mineus daughter, bow The Orgies of this newfound God in conscience to allow But still she stiffly doth denie that Bacchus is the sonne Of Jove: and in this heresie hir sisters with hir runne. The Priest had bidden holiday, and that as well the Maide As Mistresse (for the time aside all other businesse layde) In Buckskin cotes, with tresses loose, and garlondes on their heare, Should in their hands the leavie speare (surnamed Thyrsis) beare. (IV, 1-8) At non Alcithoe Mineias orgia censet Accipienda Dei, sed adhuc temeraria Bacchum Progeniem negat esse Iovis, sociasque sorores Impietatis habet. festum celebrare Sacerdos Immunes operum famulas, dominasque suorum Pectora pelle tegi, crinales solvere vittas, Serta comis, manibus frondentes sumere thyrsos Iusserat. (IV, 1-8)</page><page sequence="13">Raphael Lyne 195 (But not Minyas' daughter Alcithoe; she will not have the god's holy rites admitted; nay, so bold is she that she denies Bacchus to be Jove's son! And her sisters are with her in the impious deed. The priest had bidden the people to celebrate a Bacchic festival: all serving-women must be excused from toil; with their mistresses they must cover their breasts with the skins of beasts, they must loosen the ribands of their hair, and with garlands upon their heads they must hold in their hands the vine-wreathed thyrsus.) The potential for an English-seeming scene evident in words like 'Duke', 'Maide', 'Mistresse', and 'buckskin' is realized in the word which sum- marizes the Bacchic ritual, 'holiday'. This evokes more specific aspects of English culture, and again ones which were the subject of argument. Protestant reforms had eroded traditional forms of popular celebration, the Corpus Christi plays in particular.31 Archbishop Grindal's Register for the Diocese of York makes specific reference to the kind of 'holiday' activity perhaps evoked by the translation: Item that the Minister and Churchewardens shall not suffer anye lordes of misrule or sommer Lordes or Ladyes or anye disguised persons or others in Christmasse or at May gammes or anye min- strels morrie dauncers or other at Rysshebearings or at any other tymes to come unreverentlye into anye churche or chappell or churchyeard and there daunce or playe anye unseemlye partes with scoffes ieastes wanton gestures or rybaulde talke.32 The frivolity and release from the strictures of religion which Golding finds in this Bacchic ritual, then, were unpalatable in a conservative climate. In describing the revels he increases the sensory immediacy of the Ovidian picture by using such blunt and graphic phrases as 'gagling womens tatling tongues' (36) and 'sound of Timbrels, Tabors, Pipes, and Brazen pannes and pots' (37). The translation of 'orgia' as 'Orgies'(2) is an apparently simple etymological equivalence, but carries a note of disapproval not present in Ovid. In Latin this word is reasonably familiar and directly associated with Bacchus. In English it is a strange and exotic word; there are no references in OED before 1589, or 1576 for the form 'orgia' (the licentious meaning develops later). Golding is here using a word which emphasizes foreignness.33 Golding adopts various measures to deal with the phenomenon of Bacchus, the 'newfound' god (the word is added to the Ovid in the same line as 'Orgies') whom Ovid avoids analysing (the narrative voice never questions his divinity). Pentheus, rejecting him, is described as 'proud',</page><page sequence="14">196 Golding 's Englished Metamorphoses and Alcithoe's rejection is a 'heresie' - a strong translation of the Latin 'impietatis' because the transliteration * impiety' would lack the sense 'heresie' gives of offending established religion. On the other hand, Golding cannot simply condone the Bacchants: hence Alcithoe is 'stout' when she 'stiffly' denies the new God - words of ambiguous import. Golding transports Bacchic ritual into English culture and finds its status confusing: both orthodox and unorthodox, it prompts the translator to add notes of approval and disapproval of those who resist. One further account of a Bacchic frenzy (when the Bacchae are closing in on Pentheus) illustrates how the process of translation from culture to culture creates an interpretative rewriting: King Pentheys mother first of all hir foresaid sonne espies, And like a Bedlem first of all she doth upon him runne, And with hir Javeling furiously she first doth wound hir sonne. (in, 897-9) Prima videt, prima est insano concita cursu, Prima suum misso violavit Penthea Thyrso Mater. (III,7n-i3) (His mother was the first to see him, first to rush madly on him, first with hurled thyrsus to smite her son.) The use of 'Javeling' here for 'thyrsos' contrasts with the 'leavie speares' in IV, 8, above. There, Golding sees the context enabling a more favour- able translation of the Bacchic symbol; here, its role cannot be mitigated by a glossing translation. Ovid describes Agave's running as 'insano', a word which does not imply a strong value judgement since it can en- compass meanings like 'inspired' or 'disproportionate' as well as the conventional 'insane'.34 Golding's version 'like a Bedlem' heightens both the physical and moral immediacy of the scene. His Metamorphoses is written decades before the main period of Bedlam literature and before the Bethlem hospital became a major public attraction. Nevertheless it was beginning to develop a literary presence, partly through those who feigned insanity (Toms and Besses O'Bedlam) to evade the law, and partly through the fascination the public had for the squalid and bizarre lives of the inmates - or 'prisoners' as they were sometimes known.35 The Bacchic frenzy is described not in neutral terms but in such a way as to make clear its undesirability: while not necessarily evil, being a 'Bedlem' was not an enviable state.</page><page sequence="15">Raphael Lyne 197 Golding 'Englishes' Ovid in language and in setting and often does this in a drastic way. The relocation of mythical stories in the linguistic, cultural, and religious milieu of his readership enhances the immediacy of the interpretations he wishes to support. There seems to be a deliber- ate attempt to use vocabulary which results in a frisson of contemporary controversy. Critics who see his anglicizations as miscalculated fail to consider the possible positive effects of this kind of 'translation'. Golding is one of several translators who naturalize Ovidian tales - who 'English' Ovid in language and in cultural context. His dual attitude to the classics, which leads him to imitate but also to undertake a radical linguistic and atmospheric relocation - Daniel's 'transpassage' - displays how the English language could forge its literary identity, define its own canon, and assert its cultural independence, in the course of its translation of Latin texts.

Quotations from Ovid are taken from an edition with Regius and Micyllus commentaries, Metamorphoseos libri quindecim (Basel, 1 543). This edition has been established as the one used by Golding by M.

The English Dialect Dictionary, edited by Joseph Wright, 6 vols (London, 1898-1905), mentions the two-syllable 'iche' ('utchy') as particularly charac- teristic of Somerset and Dorset. The one-syllable 4ich' as used by Golding is identified with the South-West in general (I, 552, and III, 299). 15. On such word-patterning see L. P.

The use of anachronism to add vividness can be seen also at II, 902-5, where a simile equating Mercury's flight to that of a lead bullet from a sling is transformed: Jove's son was ravisht with the sight, and hanging in the ayre Began to swelt within himself, in case as when the poulder Hath driven the Pellet from the Gunne, the Pellet ginnes to smoulder: And in his flying waxe more hote. 18.

The word 'labelles' was used specifically as an equivalent for the 'infula' of a mitre (see OED, s.v. 'Label', sb.1). The entry for 'vitta' in Thomas Cooper's Thesaurus Linguae Romanae et Britannicae (1565) - 'A fillet or headbande: a ribband: a garlande' - offers little. However, the entry for 'mitra' sheds some light and may explain Golding's revision: 'A miter: also a tier of men and womens heades with labelles hangyng downe.' 23.

There are numerous other cases in which Golding rewrites a scene of Ovidian religion into a scene of quasi-Protestant worship. Deucalion and Pyrrha, at I, 438-47, show appropriate humility and reverence for Jupiter's wrath when they visit the deserted (and thus unadorned) 'Themis chappelP, in which 'the Altars stood / Without one sparke of holie fyre or any sticke of wood'. At XIV, 360-5, the statue of Picus kept by Canens in a 'ChauncelP is described as standing in 'holy Church'. 28. Thomas Cooper (n. 22) translates 'caelo' simply as 'to grave'; a more devel- oped view comes in Thomas Thomas's Dictionarium (1587), which gives 'to grave, carve, entaile, garnish'. 29. On the other hand, very importantly, the word 'graven has strong associa- tions with the biblical condemnation of 'graven images'. See Margaret Aston, England's Iconoclasts, Vol. I: Laws Against Images (Oxford, 1988), pp. 392-444. The doors which Golding says are 'graven' do not necessarily display 'images' and to some extent the contrast between 'graven' and 'caelatae' can be sustained. 30.

See York (Records of Early English Drama), edited by Alexandra F. Johnston and Margaret Rogerson (Toronto, 1979), p. 333 (from 1561 House Books f.i9v)* 'And for soo moche as the late fest of Corpus Christi is not nowe celebrat &amp; kept holy day as was accustomed / it is therfor aggreed that on Corpus even my lord mayour &amp; Aldermen shall in makyng the proclamacion accustomed go about in semely sad apparell &amp; not in skarlet.' 32. Johnston and Rogerson, p. 358. 33. Cooper's Thesaurus and Elyot's Bibliotheca Eliotae (second revision by Cooper, 1552) are keener to condemn the rites of Bacchus' followers than the followers themselves. For 'Bacchae' both say that they simply followed Bacchus; Elyot uses the word 'sacrificed'. For 'Bacchanalia', though, Cooper mentions 'riot and lecherie', while Elyot says more: 'feastes of the paynyms, whiche they dyd celebrate with all abhominacions of lechery'. For 'orgia' Cooper says little ('the ceremonies of Bacchus'), while again Elyot makes a significant further objection: 'ceremonies or songes perteyning to infernall goddes, or to Bacchus'. 34. Cooper's Thesaurus has as its entry for 'insanus': 'Madde: peevishe: dotyng: regardyng no counsayle: out of his witte: frowarde: untractable'; also 'exceedyng greate'; as a direct translation of the Ovidian phrase 'cursu insano concita' he gives 'Runnynge exceedynge swiftly and fiersly'. 35.

She makes the point that the first known reference to 'Bedlam' seems already to assume wide knowledge of what went on at the hospital.</page></plain_text>
