<plain_text><page sequence="1">On an Enigmatic Text by Pierre Bourdieu Jérôme David Abstract: A largely unknown commentary by Pierre Bourdieu on the poet Guillaume Apollinaire allows us to explore the non-theoretical, and even non-theorized, aspects of the relationship between the sociologist and literature. The present article begins by analysing Bourdieu's 1995 text as an example of close reading or explication de texte emerging, as it were, from a 'scholastic unconscious' dating from the 1950s. The article then proceeds to look at other ways in which Bourdieu has had recourse to literary references in his work (as a repertoire of techniques, as rhetorical elements for an argument from authority, as an equivalent or approach to sociological analysis, as ethical models or invocations). The article argues that, over and beyond his sociological objectification of literature, Bourdieu entertained a range of other relations to literature. These cannot be subsumed under a single theoretical system, but emerge at different times and with different, sometimes apparendy 'anachronistic', effects. Keywords: literature, sociology, Pierre Bourdieu, Apollinaire 'It goes without saying that we are right to expect - and that I expect - from literature much more than the revelation of the "real".' (Pierre Bourdieu)1 Among the innumerable texts that Pierre Bourdieu devoted to literature, a short four-page article, in my opinion, deserves particular attention. It is not a synthetic formulation of his sociology of fields, nor even an analysis that exemplifies his method. Published in 1995, the Jérôme David's article was published in French as 'Sur un texte énigmatique de Pierre Bourdieu', A Contrario 4:2 (2006), 71-84. It has been translated by John Speller, and is reproduced by kind permission of its author and original publisher.

From this point of view, 'Apollinaire, Automne malade' simply shares the fate of several other rarely cited texts.5 What makes these four pages so unique, and so disorienting for a reader familiar with the sociologist's work, is something else. One could speak of a shift in perspective from his usual analysis, or of a break in tone. But then one would forget that the article mobilizes notions developed elsewhere in his œuvre, and that it is therefore, on certain points, very much in conformity with what one might expect from a text signed by Bourdieu. What is it, then? That is what I will try to clarify here, beginning with the feeling of perplexity that struck me on the first reading, and because the effort to make sense of this initial surprise has led me to read Bourdieu differently from how I had read him before, and differently perhaps from how he himself wished to be read. In fact, these four pages invite a reflection on the range of different relations, scholarly or otherwise, which the author held with literature over the course of his career; and they call for a very particular interpretative effort, which consists in breaking with a strictly intellectual approach to his sociology. Logical Development and Affective Development Bourdieu's argument follows the linear progression of stanzas in the poem. A complete transcription of Apollinaire's text opens the analysis, after which the commentary merges with a gloss proceeding verse by verse, and divided into four main parts. The first part develops, to take up a term that is subsequendy deployed (133/331), the 'theme' of the first stanza: 'Autumn ill and adored' , autumn adored because of its illness, because of its mortality. Is not Apollinaire, the poet of the flux of time, of the death of love, also the poet of the love of death, of the love of the passing of time, of the love of love as the terrain par excellence of this frailty? (131-2/330)</page><page sequence="3">On an Enigmatic Text by Pierre Bourdieu 117 Two paragraphs follow which amplify this idea, by identifying the 'antitheses' set up by Apollinaire between the wind and roses, or the snow and orchard. The second part, entitled 'The exhortation to amor fati', paraphrases the three following verses of the poem, including some very general allusions to the historical context ('fin de siècle spirit', 'fin de siècle spleen'), and a reference to Pelléas et Mélisande by Debussy, whose name had already been evoked in the commentary on the first stanza. At this point, midway through the article, the reader cannot help but be surprised that Bourdieu does not change the register, but stays in the mode of literary close reading: The poet speaks of fatum, but also proffers an exhortation to amor fati. (...) He gives autumn a lesson in philosophy, which consists, simply, of drawing a lesson in philosophy that is already inscribed in autumn. Die. Accept your destiny, which is to die. Ama fatum. But to accept one's destiny is, for autumn, to die in beauty, which is to say 'to die in whiteness and richness', two words which, by their alliance, remind us of the preceding stanza, which is to say of the snow, a sumptuous shroud in the orchard, a menaced abundance. But the antithesis becomes a synthesis: the mortal snow and the richness of ripe fruits are reconciled in the fatal beauty of a luxurious decadence, so profoundly in harmony with the fin de siècle spirit. (132/331) 'The Fatal Instant', the third part of the analysis, enriches the reading of Apollinaire with a quotation from a poem by Verlaine put to music by Debussy, which, following the example of certain lines of 'Autumn 111', according to Bourdieu, consists of a 'song which announces death' (133/331). The final part, 'Resignation', is the longest. We find Debussy, for the melancholy of his Préludes and Mélodies, next to Turner and the 'Impressionist painters', summoned for their part because of their attention to the 'most fleeting details' (134/332). The paraphrase is also enriched by quotations drawn from other poems in Alcools ('Sur le pont Mirabeau' (The Mirabeau Bridge), 'L'adieu' (The Farewell), 'L'automne' (Autumn), 'Marie' and 'Cors de Chasse' (Hunting Horns)), as well as a reference to 'Les Djinns' by Hugo, and another to Schopenhauer. The focus remains on the variation of poetic themes: The poet declares himself: he speaks in the first person ('And how I love') and to declare his love to autumn (the culmination of the whole logical and affective movement of the poem). (...) 'Autumn ill and adored': the poet loves autumn</page><page sequence="4">118 Paragraph because of its illness. What he loves in autumn is the death of autumn, just as he loves in love the death of love; his love of love is a love of death. (133/332) Having reached the end of the article, however, we are left waiting for the sociologist to declare himself. For if a notion such as amor fati, for example, is often evoked by Bourdieu to explain the effect of self-evidence born of the conformity between a habitus and the social world of which it is the product,6 it is not discussed on the same level in this article: amor fati does not have here the status of an analytical category, but of a philosophical theme inherited from Schopenhauer and taken up by Apollinaire; it is a feature of the object for commentary, a facet of the 'lesson in philosophy' exemplified by the poem, and not a theoretical term injected by the commentator. The possible link that the reader might draw between this exegetical use of the notion and the descriptive use Bourdieu reserves for it in other texts, between the paraphrastic amplificatio of a stanza and the rigorous characterization of certain social facts, rests on an approximate synonymy, or better, on an operation that the 1995 article does not carry out but leaves its reader to perform. For amor fati, because it belongs to Bourdieu's standard lexicon - it is a frequent entry in the indexes to his works - induces a feeling of familiarity in the reader, an involuntary memory. But this spontaneous recognition, by overdetermining our understanding of what exactly the notion means in this commentary on Apollinaire, tends, in my view, to substitute a logical sense, extrapolated from Bourdieu's works in sociology or anthropology, for this other sense which interests me, but which proves very difficult to qualify - except by returning, provisionally, to the distinction advanced in the commentary between the logical movement and affective movement of a text. In a way, one must go against the theoretical systematicity of Bourdieu's œuvre, which is at once so self- evident and so repeatedly asserted, to be able to see that we might not be dealing here with theory, nor even, perhaps, with science, but with an affective attachment to certain literary works, and to a certain mode of reading them.7 Socio-historical contextualization requires analogous treatment. If one is familiar with the theory of fields, or with the lectures at the Collège de France devoted to Manet, one might be tempted to imagine what Bourdieu could have wished to imply by 'the literary circles of the time' (134/333), or by the references to Turner, the impressionists, or to Debussy (if one also supposes that the hypothesis of a homology between different artistic fields, which he seemed to</page><page sequence="5">On an Enigmatic Text by Pierre Bourdieu 119 elaborate more and more minutely, would have opened the way to a rigorous sociology of intermediality). In his analysis of the poem by Apollinaire, however, Bourdieu does not even begin to imply that he is doing sociology, or that he might go on to do sociology. What he gives us, in this 1995 article, is an explication de texte. No more, no less: this is not sociology of literature, in the sense that he gave this term in The Rules of Art,s for example, but nor is it an exegesis devoid of panache. This last statement renders even more complex the status of this text: the sociologist, scourge of literary reading,9 submits to the rigours of a scholastic exercise, in which he succeeds rather well, and whose pedagogical purpose is, in general, to familiarize students with the conditions of a canonical reading.10 In other words, this analysis would not stand up to the trivial test of logical coherence, if one subjected it to the test of its author's sociology, since the latter associates the very principle of literary commentary with a collective form of scholastic fallacy. Once again, then, our understanding of these pages clashes with the criteria of academic interpretation. For such interpretation hinders our reading of the article in itself: either because it encourages us to approach it as a repetition of what the sociologist has said elsewhere, in more rigorous fashion, or because it leads us to view it only as a contradiction of the presuppositions contained in his sociological thinking, which we can therefore justifiably either ignore or put down to extrinsic and contingent factors, such as the circumstances of its publication.11 There are, however, at least two ways out of this formidable aporia. The first requires us to characterize very precisely the type of scholastic exercise that Bourdieu is undertaking, so that we can date its presup- positions. It then appears, as I will argue in the conclusion, that a long- buried scholastic unconscious reveals itself in the article on Apollinaire, which the sociologist does not deem it necessary to restrain, insofar as, being the precursor of the la nouvelle critique (new criticism) which he made the initially tacit, then declared, rival of his sociology of literature, this approach to works does not appear suspect to him. Indeed, it appeared all the less suspect since, by 1995, la nouvelle critique no longer presented the united intellectual front, nor the conceptual coherence which had made it such a threat to a sociologist working on Flaubert, provoking a denunciation that extended, indirecdy, to any 'internal' reading of works. According to such a hypothesis, this exegesis of Apollinaire would not contradict the sociological reflections of Bourdieu, because it is partly separate from them.</page><page sequence="6">120 Paragraph The second escape route involves reading between the concepts, so to speak. Instead of looking for a way to link this almost incongruous text to one or another of the intellectual position-takings of its author, one might try to glimpse at work here a non-theoretical, and even un-theorized, relation to literature. We can then ask in what modes this literary imagination is deployed, and with what consequences for his sociology. And this question requires us to read Bourdieu less as a sociologist (¿/"literature, and more as a sociologist in literature. A Sociologist in Literature References to certain literary works seem to have stimulated Bourdieu's academic thought. We find them in most of his texts, in the form of analytical arguments, citations, epigraphs or allusions, even when the subject does not generally involve literature. In this sense, the sociologist most frequently uses literature not to put forward his sociology, but to prepare or support, or even fill in the gaps in its reasoning. It is therefore important to distinguish Bourdieu's sociological relation to literature, which does not really interest me here, and this other nexus of relations of collusion and alliance he maintained with literary writers. Without going into details that would take us well beyond the limits of a journal article, I would like to identify four modalities of this non-objectifying relation of Bourdieu to literature: (a) the recourse to literary works envisaged as a repertoire of techniques (enunciative, narrative or stylistic) which can be transferred to sociological writing; (b) the invocation of canonical authors in support of sociological arguments that might not otherwise be accepted by cultivated readers (an argument from authority); (c) the reference to a literary text presented as a more or less rigorous equivalent of sociological analysis; (d) the explication of the literary ethic of a writer as a detour to evoke the academic or personal ethic of the sociologist. In each case, Bourdieu mobilizes literature for its technical, rhetorical, analytical and ethical resources. The differentiation of these uses provides only a glimpse of the multiple possible levels of entanglement between literature and the social sciences, and should be accompanied by a consideration of how these relations to works mesh within sociological texts. I will restrict myself, however, to illustrating these four points with the help of some significant examples, which is to say without discussing or comparing all the occurrences of literature I have noted in Bourdieu's works.</page><page sequence="7">On an Enigmatic Text by Pierre Bourdieu 121 (a) It is no doubt in Invitation to a Reflexive Sociology that one finds the most explicit formulation of the technical reference to literature: The linear life-stories with which ethnographers and sociologists are content are artificial and (...) the apparendy exceedingly formal researches of Virginia Woolf, Faulkner, or Claude Simon (...) appear today to me to be more Realistic' (if the word has any meaning), anthropologically more truthful, closer to the truth of temporal experience, than the linear narratives to which traditional novels have accustomed us. Thus I was led to bring back to the fore of my thinking a whole set of questions that had been repressed concerning biography and, more generally, on the logic of the interview as a process, i.e., on the relations between the temporal structure of lived experience and the structure of discourse and, at the same time, to raise to the status of legitimate scientific discourse, worthy of scientific publication and debate, a whole range of so-called 'raw' documents that I tended to exclude, more unconsciously than consciously. In the same fashion, in my work on Flaubert, I stumbled upon many problems - and solutions - that he had himself encountered, such as that of the combined use of direct style, indirect style, and free indirect style which lies at the heart of the problem of transcription and publication of interviews. In short, I believe that literature, against which a good many sociologists have, from the origins to this day, thought necessary to define themselves in order to assert the scientificity of their discipline (...), is on many points more advanced than social science, and contains a whole trove of fundamental problems - those concerning the theory of narrative for instance - that sociologists should make their own and subject to critical examination instead of ostentatiously distancing themselves from forms of expression and thinking that they deem compromising.12 One might suppose that the genre of the interview, to which An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology belongs, would have incited the sociologist to divulge certain reflections on his work that these works themselves were not designed to explicate. But that would be to forget that the reflexivity claimed by Bourdieu has as its subject the epistemological operations of sociology and that it is characterized by their control in and by academic writing. We should not be surprised, then, to find in Homo Academicus an analogous passage: Thus it suffices to constitute as subject of a sentence the name of one of those collectivities fashionable in politics, to constitute the designated 'realities' as historical subjects able to posit and realize their own ends ('the People want. . . '). The objective teleology implied by this social anthropomorphism</page><page sequence="8">122 Paragraph coexists quite happily with a sort of spontaneous individualism, which is also inherent in the subject-oriented sentences of ordinary language, which, as in a fictional narrative, incline us to see the individual or collective history as a logical sequence of decisive actions. The sociologist thus finds himself faced with a writing problem very similar to that faced by novelists like Victor Hugo, especially in Seventeen Ninety-Three , and above all like Flaubert, when they wished to break with the privileged viewpoint of the 'hero* (...)• 13 For Bourdieu, then, these are 'writing problems' touching on narrative or enunciation, which writers had faced before sociologists had, and to which literary works could offer possible solutions. (b) The rhetoric of the argument from authority is obvious in Masculine Domination , where the author draws explicitly on the recognized legitimacy of Virginia Woolf in the eyes of the majority of feminist intellectuals: It took all the insight of Virginia Woolf and the infinite refinement of her writing to pursue the analysis into the best-concealed effects of a form of domination which is inscribed in the whole social order and operates in the obscurity of bodies, which are both the stakes and the principles of its efficacy. And perhaps it was also necessary to invoke the authority of the author of A Room of One's Own to lend some credibility to the recalling of the hidden constants of the relation of sexual domination - so strong are the factors which, beyond simple blindness, incline people to ignore those constants (such as the legitimate pride of a feminist movement that is led to stress the advances won by its struggles).14 This use of a writer chosen in part for her social recognition, problematized as such in this passage, also sheds new light in return on the status of innumerable formulas that Bourdieu puts into his texts. Quotations from Cervantes, Claudel, Gide, Proust, Rilke or Virginia Woolf embellish such different texts as Distinction , The Logic of Sense , Homo Academicus , or Pascalian Meditations. They are presented most frequently as felicitous formulations expressing what sociology seeks to explain: As Claudel put it, 'connaître, c'est naître avec', to know is to be born with, and the long dialectical process, often described as 'vocation', through which the various fields provide themselves with agents equipped with the habitus needed to make them work, is to the learning of a game very much as the acquisition of the mother tongue is to the learning of a foreign language.15</page><page sequence="9">Ort art Enigmatic Text by Pierre Bourdieu 123 Or, more surprisingly: What is acquired in daily contact with ancient objects, by regular visits to antique-dealers and galleries, or, more simply, by moving in a universe of familiar, intimate objects 'which are there', as Rilke says, 'guileless, good, simple, certain', is of course a certain 'taste', which is nothing other than a relation of immediate familiarity with the things of taste. But it is also the sense of belonging to a more polished, more polite, better policed world, a world which is justified in existing by its perfection, its harmony and beauty, a world which has produced Beethoven and Mozart and continues to produce people capable of playing and appreciating them. And finally it is an immediate adherence, at the deepest level of the habitus, to the tastes and distastes, sympathies and aversions, fantasies and phobias which, more than declared opinions, forge the unconscious unity of a class.16 These formulas function in the mode of the argument from authority on two levels: they draw on the cultural baggage of the reader, and on the 'seriousness' they accord to the works mentioned, so that the sociology that arrives at the same conclusions is surreptitiously validated; they signal to the reader that the sociology of taste is not the work of a sociologist without it, since he shares their literary knowledge. This is the reason, despite the fact that these formulas frequently involve more than this rhetorical use of literature, specifically in providing an intuitive grasp of the social world that Bourdieu sets himself the task of elaborating (this is the next point), that I have thought it necessary to deal with this point separately. (c) Literary works provide Bourdieu with a sort of bottomless collection of insights into the social world, whose variable degree of veracity sometimes attains the status of sociological truth. The recourse to literature produces in his view knowledge effects whose importance for academic reasoning depends on the degree of explication and coherence which writers have given to their intuitions of certain social phenomena. The descriptive or theoretical value of literary texts could thus be measured by their specific dosage of sociography and sociology, to use the distinction made by Jean-Claude Passeron,17 which is to say of literary or ordinary common sense and of reflexive consideration of the prejudices of their author and their readers. The knowledge imparted by literature therefore ranges, if one keeps to the terms used by Bourdieu, from the more or less successfiil 'evocation' of sociological 'principles' (Borges, Perec or Zola) to the 'model'</page><page sequence="10">124 Paragraph or 'exemplary image' ( The Trial by Kafka), a sort of polar case exemplifying the ideal-type of a social configuration, passing through the intermediary stages of 'incomparably lucid evocation' (Woolf) and of 'extreme lucidity' (La Rochefoucauld).18 Proust, a litde more than Kafka or Woolf,19 seems to be the writer Bourdieu appreciates the most for the keenness of his perception of the social world. In fact, in his case novelistic evocation not only corroborates the conclusions of sociological research, and goes further even than expressing them more adequately than academic writing: The statistics of the class distribution of newspaper reading would perhaps be interpreted less blindly if sociologists bore in mind Proust's analysis of 'that abominable, voluptuous act called "reading the paper", whereby all the misfortunes and cataclysms suffered by the universe in the last twenty-four hours - battles which have cost the lives of fifty thousand men, murders, strikes, bankruptcies, fires, poisonings, suicides, divorces, the cruel emotions of statesman and actor, transmuted into a morning feast for our personal entertainment, make an excellent and particularly bracing accompaniment to a few mouthfuls of café au lait'20 This description of the aesthete's variant invites an analysis of the class variations and the invariants of the mediated, relatively abstract experience of the social world supplied by newspaper reading, for example, as a function of variations in social and spatial distance (with, at one extreme, the local items in the regional dailies - marriages, deaths, accidents - and, at the other extreme, international news, or, on another scale, the royal engagements and weddings in the glossy magazines) or in political commitment (from the detachment depicted in Proust's text to the activist's outrage or enthusiasm).21 Literature goes so far, therefore, as to 'invite' the sociologist to specify his hypotheses, to refine the categories of his inquiry and to reinterpret the empirical data that has been collected, or the observations that have been made. It indicates what the sociologist should retain as pertinent phenomena. We are a long way from the subordination of literary works to the procedures of scientific objectification. And we must consider whether literature or, more precisely, the literary imagination of a sociologist might not develop, from being simply an invitation to research, to become an invitation to a social reverie - in other words, a formidable epistemologica I obstacle.22 (d) The ethical relation of Bourdieu to literature is perhaps the least obvious. It is nevertheless fully expressed in an article devoted to Ponge:</page><page sequence="11">On an Enigmatic Text by Pierre Bourdieu 125 If one looks closely, one can understand and express the necessity of even the most different, the most foreign man: indeed not only a foreign man (facilitated, in this case, by ethnology, because of the absence of antagonistic interests) but a competing, hostile man (for example, the university, intimate friends and enemies). Absorbing oneself in the object in order to absorb it; at the extreme, identifying oneself with what one hates: this comprehension does not imply empathy at all, but a sort of intellectual pleasure (amor intellectualis), which is very close to the aesthetic pleasure of conforming to the law of the work; it comes from a sharp sense of the necessity bringing a man, if not to exist, then at least to exist as he is. This generative formula can be individual (Flaubert, Ponge) or generic (an aristocrat, a petit-bourgeois, a baker). (...) This intimate knowledge, which goes from the exterior to the interior, from the construction of the poet to the construction of the poem, is an arm against the object (...) but also against the subject of knowledge. (...) Render the stranger necessary. One cannot be more of a humanist.23 Literature, because it is a form of knowledge, engages a diverse range of manners of knowing; and the critical commentary which renders them explicit opens the way to a reflection that Bourdieu himself qualifies as ethical : Therefore I think that there is indeed (...) an ethical usage of reflexive sociology. Its purpose is not to 'pick* on others, to reduce them, to accuse them, to castigate them for, say, being 'the son of a mere so-and-so'. Quite the contrary. Reflexive sociology allows us to understand, to account for the world, or, to use an expression of Francis Ponge that I like a lot, to necessitate the world (...). This does not mean it has to be loved or preserved as it is.24 The Heterogenous Temporalities of a Thought These different relations to literature, I have suggested, are not necessarily linked. And it happens that the discovery of a writer or the reading of a critic, or indeed the anniversary of the birth or death of a writer with its editorial effervescence, leads Bourdieu to adopt one or another of them.25 The logic of each of these registers rarely being made explicit, and their coordination even more rarely being a specific object for reflection, it is possible to conceive of the interrelations between literature and sociology in Bourdieu's work as a sort of mobile composite of elements largely independent from each other, and each subject to its own particular oscillations. Nothing guarantees that the</page><page sequence="12">126 Paragraph sociology of literature itself can regulate the general balance of these relations, nor that the arborescences I have indicated are insignificant in the movement as a whole. Such an image enables us to conceptualize, by analogy with the reflection of certain historians concerning historical time,26 a form of anachronism in Bourdieu's thought. This is not the chronological paralogism of a misfit between the epoch being studied and the categories of analysis, since this would suppose that Bourdieu's research was tied to a particular historical period, to which his sociological generalizations must be limited, which is not generally the case. Instead, it is the coexistence, over the course of a long period of individual research (a fortiori when it is punctuated by collective research), of heterogeneous temporalities that the present of an article or a book - which is to say the effort to apprehend in one piece, with a view to a single publication, all the pertinent aspects of a phenomenon - will never be able to absorb completely. In this respect, the date 1995, when the article on Apollinaire was published, cannot necessarily be integrated into the linear history that one normally applies to scholarly or literary works. Perhaps it is not an element in a series whose preceding moment, in Bourdieu's work, would be The Rules of Art (1992), since the close reading of 'Automne malade' does not correspond to the strict temporality of the theoretical reflections of its author. The 1995 article derives, in my view, from Bourdieu's ethical relation to literature, and this relation does not have the same tempo as that of his sociological theory. Moreover, the dominant ethic justifies the relative indifference of the sociologist towards his own epistemological principles. What is revealed in 'Apollinaire, Automne malade' is the scholastic unconscious of a largely dehistoricized relation to literature, indisso- ciable from notions such as 'theme' or 'thesis' (anti- or syn-), which la nouvelle critique did its best to denounce from the 1960s, on the grounds that they assimilated literariness to the expression of a subjective con- sciousness or a message. In 1995, then, Bourdieu adopted a mode of reading dating from the 1950s in his analysis of Apollinaire, a mode of reading anterior to the 'structuralist aggiornamento ' of explications de texte. And it may be argued that he felt able to write such a text for the very reason that he believed that he had delivered a fatal blow to la nouvelle critique in The Rules of Art, and that, having done his best to render theoretically null and void the dichotomy between 'internal' or formalist reading and 'external' or contextualized reading, he could</page><page sequence="13">On an Enigmatic Text by Pierre Bourdieu 127 not, almost on principle, be suspected of entertaining a 'naive' relation with texts. 'Each time unique' The points made so far are not enough to solve the enigma of this anachronistic text from 1995. They have, however, discreedy opened a space for an interpretation attentive not to its logical, but to its ajfedive movement. They have put us in a position to refuse the scholastic bias that only reads scholarly texts through the filter of the theory or social determinations behind them, so that we find ourselves now faced with a voice stripped to its bare argumentation. But what lesson can we draw from this frail vulnerability? A recent work by Jacques Derrida exemplifies, I think, the tone to adopt in conclusion. Chaque fois unique, la fin du monde ( The Work of Mourning) is a collection of texts written by the philosopher to pay homage to his deceased friends.27 I will only retain the following trait, which marks an ethical preoccupation: in each case, Derrida explores the way in which these figures envisaged death, and the discovery of how each of them confronted that eventuality seems to him to be the most appropriate way of keeping their singular voice alive. The dead bequeath us, as it were, the always timely legacy of their relation to death. And to pay them homage is to be able to hear what they have left for us to hear. Beneath its logical structure, the article devoted to Apollinaire perhaps bears witness, in its affective register, to the ethic that Bourdieu advocated when confronted with illness and death. The text begins with these words: ' "Autumn ill and adored", autumn adored because of its illness, because its mortality', and ends with these: 'Life is this continuous passage, right up to the ultimate discontinuity.' The ethical relation to literature makes possible, here, not the formulation of a researcher faced with objects he seeks to explain, as in the text on Ponge, but the expression of a personal relation to the 'flight of time', paradoxically muted by a mode of reading which signals that pathos here takes precedence over logos. The unusual tone of this article would then suggest that we, ourselves, should carry away the 'philosophical lesson (...) inscribed in autumn', that of a stoical amor fati. 'Amor amorisfaď, Bourdieu says: agree to love even that love of destiny against which you have so often rebelled. We might then see, in this detour</page><page sequence="14">128 Paragraph via Apollinaire, something like a surrender of the sociologist to nature, which his sociology would not have allowed him to pronounce.

(...) He feels at home in the world because the world is also in him, in the form of habitus, a virtue made of necessity which implies a form of love of necessity, amor fati! 7 These considerations only push to their ultimate consequences Bourdieu's radical critique of the scholastic fallacy : (a) the logic of practice is not to be confused with the logic of theory; (b) theorizing is to be viewed as a practice inscribed in social universes; (c) this stricdy social assignation of the diverse forms of theorizing is to be considered, in the last instance, as a specifically sociological form of epistocentrism. In other words, while the practical sense of the sociologist may have led him to theorize in a certain way, explaining this does not mean one must reproduce the same relation to theory: Bourdieu's own epistemology allows us to imagine that in his search for reflexively controlled logical coherence there were logics at work which could not be subsumed solely by the epistemology or sociology of scholarly activities.</page><page sequence="15">On an Enigmatic Text by Pierre Bourdieu 129 8 Pierre Bourdieu, The Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field , translated by Susan Emanuel (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1996). 9 See for example Pierre Bourdieu, 'Reading, readers, the literate, literature', in In Other Words, translated by Matthew Adamson (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990), 94-105, especially 95: 'One of the illusions of the lector is that which consists in forgetting one's own social conditions of production, and unconsciously universalizing the conditions of possibility of one's own reading. Inquiring into the conditions of this type of practice known as reading means inquiring into how lectores are produced, how they are selected, how they are educated, in what schools, etc. One would have to carry out a sociology of the success, in France, of structuralism, of semiology and of all the forms of reading, "symptomatic" or other. One would need to ask, for instance, whether semiology was not a way of producing an aggiornamento of the old tradition of "explication de textes" and of making it possible, at the same time, to redeploy a certain kind of literary capital.' 10 On the effects of canonization, which are regrettable according to Bourdieu, see the pages devoted to Baudelaire in Pascalian Meditations , 85-92. 11 I would like to take this opportunity to thank Anna Boschetti, Joseph Jurt and Henning Krauss, who have very kindly tried, unfortunately in vain, to help me to elucidate the circumstances under which the 1995 article was written and published. 12 Pierre Bourdieu, in Pierre Bourdieu and Loïc J. Wacquant, An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1992), 207-8. 13 Pierre Bourdieu, Homo Academicus , translated by Peter Collier (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1988), 149. 14 Pierre Bourdieu, Masculine Domination , translated by Richard Nice (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001), 81. 15 Pierre Bourdieu, The Logic of Practice , translated by Richard Nice (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990), 67. 16 Pierre Bourdieu, Distinction , translated by Richard Nice (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press), 77. 17 Jean-Claude Passeron, Le Raisonnement sociologique. Un espace non poppérien de V argumentation (Paris: Albin Michel, 2006), 329-58. 18 See Pierre Bourdieu, Distinction , 258 (for Borges), 585, note 32 (for Perec), and 596, note 13 (on The Trial , which 'offers an exemplary image of this desperate striving to regain a social identity that is by definition ungraspable, being the infinite limit of all categoremes, all imputations'); or Pascalian Meditations , 24 (for Zola, whose evocation remains 'still derealized by literary stylization'), 198 (for La Rouchefoucauld), and 229 (on The Trial as a 'model of a social universe dominated by (...) an absolute and unpredictable power, capable of inducing extreme anxiety, by condemning its victim to very strong investment combined with very great insecurity').</page><page sequence="16">130 Paragraph 19 And much more than Claudel or Gide, to whom Bourdieu regularly alludes, but as if in passing (see for example The Logic of Practice, 67; Distinction , 415; Pascalian Meditations , 69). 20 In a footnote of his own, Bourdieu writes: 'The text refers here to a Proustian text other than La Recherche : "Sentiments filiaux ďun parricide", in Marcel Proust, Pastiches et mélanges (Paris: Gallimard, 1970), 200.' 21 Pierre Bourdieu, Distinction, 21. 22 I develop this idea in my doctoral thesis, pointing out for example that the literary genesis of the petit-bourgeois has never been problematized as such by Marxist historians or sociologists, which suggests that its apparent obviousness may be a product of the 'invitations' of a still vigorous literary imagination as much as the rigorous demonstration of its empirical existence.

[Translator's note: the last sentence does not appear in this form in the English version of the book, and I have thus departed from the text for this.] 25 A passing reference to Cervantes in Pascalian Meditations ('letting time take its time', 228) may only have been meant, therefore, to save the phrase from its exclusive association with Mitterrandism, by attributing it to the altogether more famous and older author who coined it. And it seems that reading a work by E. L. Santner (My Own Private Germany Daniel Paul Schreibens Secret History of Modernity (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996)), in the interval between Distinction and Pascalian Meditations , made Bourdieu aware of new characteristics of The Trial by Kafka (see Pascalian Meditations , 72). 26 See for example Jacques Rancière, 'Le concept d'anachronisme et la vérité de l'historien', LTnactuel 6 (1996), 53-68, and Georges Didi-Huberman, Devant le temps.
