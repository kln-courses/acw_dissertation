<plain_text><page sequence="1">J. VAN BRAKEL CHEMISTRY AS THE SCIENCE OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCES 1. INTRODUCTION One area of research in the philosophy of chemistry is concerned with the nature of chemical substances (such as gold and vitamin C) and it investigates the status and relationship of concepts such as pure substance (also called chemical compound, chemical species, chemical kind), mole cule (often considered the microscopic essence of a pure substance), atom (building block of a molecule; also called chemical element), and of asso ciated concepts such as valence (a measure of affinity between constituents of a substance), structure (in the sense of spatial distribution of affinities between microconstituents) and phase (the state of aggregation of a sub stance such as solid, liquid, vapour).1 Although it is generally assumed that a pure substance is defined in terms of (atomic) composition and (mole cular) structure, strictly macroscopic definitions are also possible. For example: A pure substance is a substance of which the macroproperties (of one of its phases), such as temperature, density and electric conductivity, do not change during a phase conversion (as in boiling a liquid or melt ing a solid).2 Or alternatively: pure chemical substances are the relatively stable products of chemical analysis and synthesis: nodes in a network of chemical reactions. The first definition stresses physico-chemical, the second chemical features. But both are macroscopic, independent of one's beliefs in atoms, in an atomistic hidden variable interpretation of quantum mechanics, or in any other microphysical story. Chemistry is not primarily the science of molecules, but of substances. To conflate the concepts of substance and molecule is to create many confusions. What is, or is not, a pure substance is not definable in an essentialistic or reductionistic way. Although, there are good reasons for saying that water is a substance, no definition of the molecular structure of water can be given?it is not H2O (see below). Any proposed definition of substance may change under the influence of new observations (including observations using spectroscopic techniques and similar (sub)microscopic Synthese 111: 253-282, 1997. ? 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">254 J. VAN BRAKEL methods). But the final arbiter will, in the final analysis, be observations at the macroscopic level. This is not merely because reading the instruments provides macroscopic data. Poisonous water, for example, would be impure water (an impure substance), independent of whether a (microscopic) cause can be found. In chemical thermodynamics there's no room for molecules. The older definition "chemistry is the science of the transformation of materials" is therefore to be preferred over textbooks saying that chemistry is the science of transferring electrons between atoms and/or molecules.3 In the science of the transformation-of-materials-or-substances, talk of molecules, atoms, and electrons is not out of place; it is merely deriv ative relative to the main goal. As a consequence, thermodynamics and other parts of physical chemistry (such as interface chemistry) become a natural part of this notion of material science. Whether thermodynam ics or interface chemistry is part of physics or chemistry is neither here nor there. My focus is on the macroscopic science(s) of substances and their transformations; and the purpose of this paper is to provide some preliminaries for assessing whether such macroscopic notions as chemical substance, equilibrium, and temperature can be reduced to microphysics, here defined to include statistical physics, atomic physics, particle physics, and quantum mechanics.4 The importance of microphysics in furthering understanding and prediction is not denied; nor are the many important intertheoretic correlations between "macro" and "micro". The question is whether the existence of these relations justifies the use of slogans like "chemistry can be reduced to physics" ? understood in the in principle sense that all chemical concepts, laws, and explanations at the macrolevel are superfluous.5 At a number of places in this paper I'll refer to the historical development of various ideas. Current opinion, in particular that of a more general or philosophical nature, is clearly the product of the history of ideas, not determined by scientific observation. For example, views as to whether or not a clear distinction should be made between a chemical atom, molecule or substance on the one hand, and a physical atom, molecule or "bit of matter" on the other,6 do not solely depend on "timeless" data reported in a "timeless" descriptive ideal language. The arguments in this paper should not be associated with anti-scientific realism, such as van Fraassen's constructive empiricism. Van Fraassen (1980, 1989) goes against scientific realist arguments that draw ontologi cal conclusions from inferences to the best or only plausible explanation, and he stresses the underdetermination of any theory by the data it aims to explain. According to van Fraassen one should be agnostic about the existence of the referents of all theoretical terms in science. His argu</page><page sequence="3">CHEMISTRY OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCES 255 ments are based, in part, on taking the ontological status of macroscopic objects and properties as uncontentious. My paper is not about this general argument against scientific realism (which is applicable to all sciences, and in particular to microphysics and relativity theory). Indeed I believe van Fraassen's arguments can also be directed at macroscopic objects and properties (van Brakel 1996b). But the purpose of this paper is much more local: I argue against the reduction of chemistry and thermodynamics to microphysics, without claiming that these arguments would undermine the reality of whatever entities microphysics would be about. On a more philosophical (or metaphysical) level my aim is to show that the problems reductionistic programs face are part of the more general question of whether the scientific image can replace the manifest image. The manifest/scientific image terminology stems from Sellars (1963). The manifest image is the daily practice or common-sense-human-life-form concerned with things like water, purring cats, and being angry about an injustice; the scientific image is concerned about quarks, black holes, and firing neurons. In this paper however these issues remain in the background and arguments are restricted to the relation of chemistry and microphysics. 2. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND According to the received view Boyle and Dalton tailored atomism to the needs of chemistry. According to Dalton there exist "simple elemen tary particles" (atoms), which may combine into "compound particles" (molecules).7 Though Dalton can be taken as following the Democritean tradition, his atoms are of distinct types, whose instances differ in size, weight, and mutual attraction (affinity). Contrary to the received view, perhaps the notion of chemical compound (pure substance) should not be seen as part of a continuous line of development from antique atomism via Boyle, but as emerging from the practice of sixteenth and seventeenth century metallurgists and pharmacists.8 That the seventeenth century "cor puscular philosophy" was inconsistent with the development of the chem ical notions of element and compound was already emphasised by Kuhn (1952). It is therefore wrong to stress the connection between Boyle's chemistry and his corpuscular philosophy. Boyle's theory doesn't include the notion of chemical compound. It only covers compounds of corpuscles, without taking into account the relation of the notion of chemical com pound to chemical synthesis and analysis, the combination and separation of substances, and concepts like conservation, reversibility, and homo geneity (and the empirical laws concerning these features). A corpuscular theory only conserves the number of particles, whereas a chemical the</page><page sequence="4">256 J. VAN BRAKEL ory conserves, in some way, substance-specificity and the related notion of pure substance. There is therefore reason to distinguish physical and chemical atomism. Dalton can perhaps be seen as the modern originator of chemical atomism, not Boyle. Since Dalton, chemical elements, as ordered in the Periodic Table, are not considered simple. Rather, they have a complex internal structure and one element in the taxonomy covers a number of isotopes, each having different macroproperties (like density, boiling point, ... ). Furthermore, atoms can disintegrate and fuse. The idea of a chemical atom as an indivis ible unit of a type of substance had to be given up. In the course of the past century, there was also a shift from defining substances in terms only of composition (of chemical elements), to the situation where the structure of molecules was considered a more fundamental property. Both 'structure' and 'molecule' are ambiguous terms, as we will see in subsequent sections. The idea of structure as a static architectonics of atoms, and of bonds as the defining structure, was already undermined during the development of the theory of resonance structures between 1872 (Kekul?) and 1931 (Pauling). In a benzene molecule, for example, it is not possible to specify exactly where there are single and double bonds (Rocke 1981, Vermeeren 1986). The "real" microsituation is a kind of mixture of a number of (logi cally) possible fixed arrangements of nuclei (of atoms) and electrons. The subsequent development of quantum mechanical accounts of the organ isation of electrons in a molecule has pulled the chemical and physical description further apart. It is not too far-fetched to suggest that with the advance of quantum mechanics, atomism finally dug its own grave (Primas 1985a). Hence there is support from modern physics for the views of Mach and Ostwald who, at the beginning of the century, opposed the reality of atoms as material objects.9 With the disappearance of the German energeticists led by Ostwald and the discovery of radioactivity (and in particular the experiments of Rutherford), the atom changed hands from the (German) chemists to the (English) physicists. One of its main agents (in Latourean terms) was Maxwell. Typically, neither in his address on molecules to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1873, nor in the article on Atoms in the 9th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, was Dalton mentioned (Gavroglu and Simoes 1994). I can only conclude that the identification of chemical and physical atomism is based on the assumption that the final ontology of everything (including chemistry) is whatever physics says it is. As I shall show in Section 4, physically speaking there are no chemical atoms (or molecules). But it would be incorrect to conclude that therefore chemical talk of atoms and molecules is non-referential.10</page><page sequence="5">CHEMISTRY OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCES 257 3. ORDINARY AND SCIENTIFIC WATER In the present context the following questions concerning reduction need to be considered: the reduction of manifest substances to scientific sub stances, of physico-chemical thermodynamics to statistical physics, of molecular chemistry to quantum mechanics via quantum chemistry, and of macroscopic properties to microscopic essences. Of course the issues overlap; nonetheless I'll address them more or less separately in this and the following three sections. The problem of the relation between the manifest and the scientific is illustrated well by Hare's (1984) defence of ordinary, liquid water as not supervening on (scientific) H2O ? in solid, liquid, or vapour form. Hare says there is no such supervenience or dependence, first, because, 'water' and 'H2O' are words with different meanings (senses), as the Oxford English Dictionary will testify;11 and second, because the notion of natural kind or substance that underlies this sort of alleged supervenience is a recent invention/discovery, related to the socio-history of western science.12 Hence (Hare 1984, 13f): In the primitive sense, when we say that something is water, we do not imply that there is any (let alone any particular) chemical or physical structure such that stuff which has it is always water and that stuff has it. That is what we should be implying if it were a classic case of supervenience. Note that Hare's concern with the ordinary language use of the word "water" and its accompanying referential intentions, is very different from the concern of someone like Kim (1990, 14, emphasis added):13 chemical kinds ... and their microphysical compositions (at least, at one level of descrip tion) seem to strongly covary with each other, and yet it is true, presumably, that natural kinds are asymmetrically dependent on microphysical structures. Here our mereological intuition, that macrophysical properties are asymmetrically dependent on microphysical structures, seems to be the major influence on our thinking, cancelling out the fact that the converse strong covariance may also be present. Mainstream supervenience discussions, although claiming to be in the business of developing a form of non-reductive materialism, are wedded to the intuition of a microreductionistic image of the world: the asymmetry is taken for granted, with an appeal to a long standing atomistic intuition as part of the scientific image (van Brakel 1996a). For Hare, the natural image is the manifest image of ordinary language and common sense; for Kim the natural image is the scientific image and its microreductionistic motivations. Hare (1984,13) says in support of his view that (liquid) water and H2O (in liquid, vapour, or solid form) are two different things that "if [chemists</page><page sequence="6">258 J. VAN BRAKEL and ordinary men] were parched with thirst and begged for water and you directed a jet of steam at them they would not thank you". But presumably they would not thank you either if you directed a jet of ordinary liquid water at them with a temperature of 98 ?C. Dictionary definitions give descriptions of the "normal" case in "normal" circumstances. It is obvious that someone parched with thirst has as little interest in a jet of steam, as being thrown in "the liquid of which the sea is composed" (another OED description of what 'water' means). Hare and the Oxford English Dictionary however are wrong about their history. The common sense stereotype of water (in liquid, vapour, or solid form) and the notion of water as a more or less pure substance, have kept much the same sense in the western culture since Aristotle. Aristotle says, for example, that "the finest and sweetest water is every day carried up and is dissolved into vapour and rises to the upper region, where it is condensed again by the cold and so returns to the earth".14 Aristotle clearly assumes that water is not merely a transparent thirst-quenching liquid, but a substance which can appear in different phases. By the 18th century ideas about water as a substance had hardly changed. For example, the 1728 edition ofChamber's Dictionary states: Water, Aqua in Physicks, a simple, fluid and liquid Body; reputed the third of the four vulgar Elements ... Whether Water be originally Fluid? ... We sometimes find it appear in a fluid, and sometimes in a solid form ... that Water is ice_Water, if it could be had alone, and pure, Boerhaave argues, would have all the requisites of an element, and be as simple as Fire? Whether Water be convertible into Air? But such a Vapour-Air has not the Characters of true permanent Air, being easily reducible into water again... the Water may be rarefied into Vapours, yet it is not really changed into Air, but only divided by Heat, and diffused into very minute Parts; which meeting together, presently return to such Water as they constituted before. These quotations suffice to refute Hare's point. Irrespective of whether the theory of matter was atomistic or something else, from Aristotle to the present day there has been one sense of water in the western culture, which includes water as a pure liquid, as a liquid containing impurities,15 and as a substance in solid, liquid, or vapour form. Although it is correct that not all uses of 'water' imply that it is H2O, all uses of "water" do imply that it is a natural kind of the pure substance type. Water in all its modifications (liquid, solid, vapour) is the same substance. This supports the point that knowledge about "materials and their transformations" is more robust than the local microphysical picture of the moment. Hence, "when we say something is water", we do imply that there is a particular something "such that stuff which has it is always water and that stuff has it",16 though this essence doesn't have to be microscopic. Hare's conclusion that water and H2O are two different things is wrong, a mistake</page><page sequence="7">CHEMISTRY OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCES 259 following from the attempt to give precise definitions. Concepts change all the time; they are not written in the Book Of Nature's Joints, nor do words follow such putative joints. Realists in the philosophy of science often appeal to the principle of inference to the best or most plausible explanation to justify the existence of unobservables (like atoms). If this principle makes sense, it would be a miracle if it were to turn out that there is no water, or that there are no substances, in the sense of "there is no ... " in which it turned out that there is no phlogiston or caloric heat particles. If Aristotle says that water that evaporates may condense again, there can only be pedantic or silly reasons to raise the issue of incommensurability.17 I must conclude therefore that ordinary (somewhat vague, but no less objective) concepts like "water", and even "(pure) substance" are much better entrenched than "atoms" and "molecules". If the question of priority must be raised ? I don't say it should ? it is the manifest that is prior to the scientific and not the other way round (van Brakel 1996a). This does not deny developments in science directed at the structure of molecules and atoms can vastly increase the understanding of the properties and behaviour of water. The point is simply that these scientific explanations refer to water, where the latter term refers to manifest water (the same water Aristotle speculated about). The term does not refer to a definition in terms of the currently most popular micro- or quantum-physical theories. To claim otherwise is to appeal to a science that is in the business of discovering the essences of things. I'll come back to this last suggestion in Section 6. For now it may be enough to stress that 'essence' is not a theoretical term in chemistry, physics, or mathematics. 4. REDUCTION OF PHYSICO-CHEMICAL THERMODYNAMICS TO MICROPHYSICS? Few defenders of reductionist programmes or eliminativist commitments will be impressed by references to Aristotle or Hare. Let us therefore look at what it could mean to reduce chemistry (or material science) to microphysics. The broad question "Can chemistry be reduced to physics"? is more a slogan than a meaningful expression, because how one would delineate and separate chemistry and physics is not at all clear - what, for example, about chemical physics or mechanical and physical separa tion methods in chemistry and chemical engineering?18 If the question is raised in a broad sense, chemistry is squeezed in between micro- and macrophysics. However this may be, it does make sense to look at par ticular examples of proposed reductions. I'll first look at the reduction of</page><page sequence="8">260 J. VAN BRAKEL (macroscopic) thermodynamics to (microscopic) statistical mechanics and follow this (in Section 5) with the attempt at reducing molecular chemistry to quantum mechanics. Similar questions, not touched here, can be raised in connection with the reduction of macrophysics to microphysics and the relation of both to general relativity theory.19 Duhem conceived of generalised thermodynamics as the primary chem ical theory and was dismissive of atomic theories (Needham 1996b). But later writers, following Gibbs, assumed thermodynamics was a phenom enological theory neutral with respect to atomic theories.20 I'll start with a few comments about temperature, in particular because the example "tem perature is mean kinetic (molecular) energy" has been used in hundreds of publications as an example of a straightforward reduction. The macroscopic concept of temperature was developed primarily in the context of thermometry (from Galileo, circa 1600, onwards). Only in the past 100 years or so, were all kinds of theories added (and laws in which temperature occurs as a variable.) The interpretation of tempera ture as mean kinetic molecular energy is only one of the laws in which temperature enters. The macroscopic concept of temperature only makes sense for systems in equilibrium. Operationally equilibrium means: no noticeable changes in macroscopic features. This implies that microscop ically the status of the 0th law of thermodynamics is unclear. This law says that there is a parameter which determines whether, before two (or more) systems come into contact, they will be in equilibrium or whether there will be an energy flow from one to the other. This parameter is the temperature. Microscopically each of the systems themselves is never in equilibrium because of the second order variation in the statistical distri bution of the energy of the molecules. Microscopically there is no such thing as equilibrium. Hence temperature understood as defined by the 0th law of thermodynamics is not reducible (Primas 1985b). Even hard-liners like the eliminativist of sorts P. Churchland, have their doubts about the reduction of temperature. In an article published in January 1985 Churchland writes: "being warm is identical with hav ing a certain mean level of microscopically embodied energies" [53].21 Two months later this fact had been overtaken by eliminativism: "the common-sense notions of hot, warm, and cold are empirically incoherent ... [they] are not just different in extension from the thermodynamic terms that displace them ... nothing in nature answers to the collected laws of 'common-sense thermodynamics' " [283f]. Not only have folk ideas about heat been eliminated from the world during these two months, but "real" thermodynamics too has eroded away. In the first publication Churchland writes: "Material-mode statements of identity can occasionally be made,</page><page sequence="9">CHEMISTRY OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCES 261 of course. ... temperature = mean molecular kinetic energy" [49; cf. 31, 60], but in March he says: "The irony is that fhermodynamic temperature has turned out to enjoy no uniform essence in any case. ... A familiar property has fragmented again. ... Our taxonomies form, and dissolve, and reform, even as we watch" [285]. Temperature is, in general, not the same as average mean molecular kinetic energy. This seems to be so for gases that behave properly (i.e. "perfect" gases of idealised "billiard-ball" molecules in random motion), but not for solids, plasmas or a vacuum, Churchland reports. More worries could be added. For a dense gas at low temperature quantum mechanics implies that the kinetic energy depends not only on the temperature, but also on the density, and the temperature dependence is not a simple proportionality. Hence the connection between temperature and mean kinetic energy is non-linear and its value depends on other characteristics of the system apart from the kinetic energy. There has also been talk of "negative, infinite and hotter than infinite tempera tures" (Ehrlich 1982), although this could be interpreted as an extension of the "reduced" temperature concept at the microlevel, not as a problem for the reduction of macroscopic temperature to microscopic descriptions (Sklar 1993). Finally, even if temperature could be reduced, it doesn't yet follow that "boiling point" can be reduced (Hooker 1981, 497-500). For one thing, "boiling point" refers to a phase transition of liquid to vapour. No molecular definition of what a liquid is exists; nor is there a theory in molecular or microphysical terms which confirms how many aggregation phases there are. There are many other problems for those who advocate the reduction of thermodynamics, but all seem to be related to the macroscopic notion of equilibrium (which is the central notion of thermodynamics).22 According to Sklar (1993), who reviews the extensive literature, there is no satisfying explanation why systems strive to equilibrium towards the future, rather than in the direction of the past. He shows that various attempts to explain the time asymmetry fail: before the explanation starts, the asymmetry is already presupposed. That is to say: there is no analogon of the second law of thermodynamics in statistical mechanics; a hundred years of research has not succeeded in reducing entropy.23 When Perrin discovered Brownian motion this was generally seen as a victory for atomism. But why not conclude that descriptions are needed at both levels (thermodynamic and statistical mechanics)? It is not true that the "traditional" second law of thermodynamics was falsified by Brownian motion. It simply doesn't apply to molecules. Moreover, a statistical form of thermodynamics was later developed (Primas 1985b). Gibbs' paradox too, supports the primacy of the macroscopic picture. Gibbs' paradox says</page><page sequence="10">262 J. VAN BRAKEL that the entropy of mixing two substances (no matter how "similar" they are) is 2R In 2, but collapses to 0 when the substances are identical.24 This finds its base in the fact that mixtures can be separated, but pure substances cannot.25 Denbigh and Redhead (1989), dissolve Gibbs' paradox by taking as central that entropy is an observable (though dispositional). Textbooks often misrepresent the contribution of Boltzmann and Gibbs to the development of statistical mechanics. Gibbs did not merely improve upon Boltzmann's formulation of statistical mechanics. He replaced Boltz mann's reductionistic approach by taking the macroscopic laws and phe nomena as "basic" and proposed abstract theoretical laws that were con sistent with observations and empirically supported thermodynamic func tions. That is to say: he proposed theories/models/laws/hypotheses that could be tested empirically without assumptions about the microcon stituents or microstructure of the system. Similarly, Gibbs' phase rule is a law completely free from all hypothetical assumptions as to the mole cular condition of the substances involved.26 Up to this moment tensions between macro- and micro-descriptions cause problems for students tak ing courses in, say, interface chemistry, in which macroscopic parameters are used (to which Gibbs' theoretical considerations apply), but for which there is no plausible statistical mechanical interpretation available.27 As a last example consider surfaces. For surfaces the macroscopic, thermodynamic surfaces are much more real than surfaces at the sub macroscopic level. If we don't look at the molecular/atomic level, we can ascribe energy to a surface and have forces work along surfaces and explain all kind of things; for example, why drops from a tap have a certain size; why if you take a liquid in a container out of the field of gravity it won't have a flat surface; why it's possible to blow soap bubbles; why a drop of oil creeps through every corner of your watch; why water rises in a glass capillary (but mercury doesn't); and so on. On the other hand, at the molecular level it's not at all clear what the surface is. There is a constant movement of molecules to and from the surface. Consider too the experiment which was (allegedly) carried out by Franklin to estimate the size of molecules. On an absolutely wind-free day he went to a small lake and started to put drops of pure oil on the water surface. He added oil until the whole lake had a rainbow-coloured oily appearance. Assuming there was a monomolecular layer of oil on the water surface, he estimated the size of the oil molecules (which was correct as to the order of magnitude). In this situation the "head" of the oil molecule is "in" the water and its "tail" is "in" the air. Question: how many surfaces are there and where are they? Thermodynamically the answer is straightforward: there are three phases: a "bulk" liquid phase, a "bulk" gas</page><page sequence="11">CHEMISTRY OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCES 263 phase, and an "interface" or "surface" phase. Looking at the molecular level through eyes trained on macroscopic objects the answer would seem to be that there are two surfaces (one at both sides of the soap molecules), not three or one. A less biased view might be to say that at the level of molecular description there is no surface or interface (other than in a con ventional sense - the convention steered by considerations not part of the microtheory). After a book-length account of the relations between thermodynamics and statistical physics, Sklar (1993, 372-3) concludes: it is this already existing macroscopic account that is used in framing that deeper picture. ... Even when we already have the statistical-mechanical kinetic equations at our dis posal, we generally cannot hope to find the general solutions of it. Instead, the search for solutions is guided ... by the use of what we know, from the macroscopic thermodynamic hydrodynamic level, about the structure of the solution we are seeking... the very structure of the solution found is guided by our antecedent knowledge at the empirical macroscopic level of the kind of solution we must look for. The general point, that it is not clear how reduction can work without making assumptions appealing to macrophysical concepts (Primas 1985b), shows up in all proposals for reduction, whether it is colour (Saunders and van Brakel 1997), schizophrenia (van Brakel 1996a), temperature (see above) or molecular chemistry (to which I now turn). 5. REDUCTION OF CHEMISTRY TO PHYSICS VIA QUANTUM CHEMISTRY? As a preliminary I want to introduce two kinds of distinctions. Not making these distinctions has led, I believe, to a considerable number of confusions and misunderstandings in the discussion of the relation of quantum chem istry to chemistry on the one hand and quantum mechanics on the other. The first is that the notion of structure has different meanings at different levels of description. For example: structure given by the (macroscopic) network of relations between substances and the chemical reactions into which they enter; structure at the (micro)level of molecules: spatial arrangement of atoms; structure at the (micro)level of atoms: arrangement of electron config urations; mathematical structure of the quantum mechanical description for a particular system. It is trivial that at every level of description there is structure. A reduction istic view will take for granted that all the higher level structures will, if</page><page sequence="12">264 J. VAN BRAKEL they make sense, eventually be found back at the most fundamental level: all the higher level structures will be mirrored at the lower level. Defenders of this view often seem to presuppose that the undeniable fact that quan tum mechanical structures have been used to make excellent predictions of higher level properties, is sufficient to prove that complete reduction is possible in principle. A second ordering device, adapted from Primas (1985a), takes Einstein Podolsky?Rosen (EPR) correlations seriously (see table): EPR correlations Objects/molecules including all correlations no objects no correlations with environment formless molecules (gross atomic formulae) no correlations between nucleus and electrons molecules have spatial structure no correlations between electrons molecules with localised electron orbitals It is the Einstein?Podolsky?Rosen correlations predicted by quantum mechanics that exclude any classical concept of molecular structure. The general point against the reduction of the science of macroscopic sub stances and molecular chemistry to quantum mechanics is that the decision when and where to suppress the EPR-correlations is not something that can be derived from quantum mechanics. But it is these decisions that, as it were, abstract objects out of the quantum mechanical formalism. Quan tum mechanics describes the material world, in principle, as one whole. To separate out objects from this whole requires a justification which lies outside the principles of quantum mechanics. Only by forgetting about the EPR-correlations can one impose the concept of molecule on quantum mechanics (Primas 1985a). In terms of quantum mechanics an object can only be defined in terms of its relations to its environment (Amann 1990,1993; Primas 1985a, 1983, 295).28 Physical systems are automatically coupled to their environment and are never closed in a strict sense. Therefore, all classical observables of molecular systems seem to be inherited from the environment, in the sense in which a person's nationality is not intrinsic to the person, but inherited from the environment (Primas 1983,306). Even if it were to make sense to talk about a reduction for the ideal model of an isolated/insulated molecule, it is not trivial to extend this to the reduction of a substance, let alone to a network representing the chemical affinities between different substances. Causally relevant factors are not only to be found in the relational prop erties of molecules, atoms, and smaller particles, but also in gradients of concentration or other parameters. And the latter may well be (partially) dependent on properties of relatively big objects like membranes.29</page><page sequence="13">CHEMISTRY OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCES 265 Lacking support for the reductionist programme is built into quantum chemistry. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation (which assumes that in a molecule there are no interactions between electrons and nuclei), lying at the base of most important successes in quantum chemistry, is grounded in the classical chemical molecular paradigm (i.e. the picture of a semi rigid framework of atoms connected by bonds that rotate and translate in ordinary space as time elapses). If one drops the latter assumption, quantum mechanics and traditional chemistry are in flat contradiction. A good example is ammonia, a (macroscopic) gas with the chemical formula NH3. The simplest form of ammonia thus understood is, according to quantum mechanics, a superposition of two stationary states (the ground state and the first excited state). This only gives probability distributions for the position of the nitrogen and hydrogen atoms - a problem at the level of atoms similar to that of resonance structures at the level of chemical bonds mentioned earlier. More generally, subsystems (like an atom in a molecule) do not necessarily exist as individual entities according to the quantum mechanical description. This implies holistic correlations between subsystems.30 It is possible to bring such a system into a pure state, but then the state of the overall system changes; and this is only possible "momentarily", because the position of a "free" quantum "particle" is smeared out in the course of time. In so far as a solution of the Schr?dinger equation for stationary states is possible, the results cannot be understood in terms of the size and shape of an individual atom or molecule. For simple molecules, outstanding agreement between calculated and measured data has been obtained. Yet, nowhere can, say, the concept of a chemical bond be found in these calcu lations. One can calculate bonding energies without ever knowing what a bond is (Primas 1985a). The concept of electronic configurations cannot be derived from quantum mechanics; electron configurations are derived from spectral observations, not from quantum mechanics.31 The Schr?dinger equation can only be solved analytically for a two particle system. In the crudest approximative solutions for bigger systems, all interactions between electrons are neglected. Although methods like the Hartree-Fock method introduce refinement, its predictive accuracy - note that the method is checked against "classical" data - is of the order of 1% of the total atomic energy. This may seem a reasonable figure, but the absolute value of this 1% is of the same order of magnitude as the energy of a typical chemical bond (Scerri 1993). Most practicing scientists are not very concerned about this because they are used to comparing their models and approximations with already known experimental data. But from the fact that the experimental value can be increasingly better</page><page sequence="14">266 J. VAN BRAKEL approached, it doesn't follow that, theoretically speaking, the path followed will converge. As one might expect, things don't get better if one considers approximations of solutions of the time-dependent Schr?dinger equation. My concern is not that ab initio methods do not provide analytic solu tions. My concern is that numerical methods are governed by what exper imental data have to be predicted; or, if new predictions are made, the choice of parameters is governed by extrapolations made from calcula tions performed on other molecules or general experience derived from experimental work on chemical compounds and reaction mechanisms. If no lower and upper bounds or some other ab initio criterion for conver gence or truncation can be obtained independently of experimental data, then these methods are not truly ab initio (Scerri 1994). Woolley's paper 'Must a molecule have a shape?' (1978) has been referred to in many subsequent publications, but, perhaps due to its provoca tive title, it is not always understood correctly. The ambiguity is in the term 'molecule'. For example, although Bunge (1982) was sceptical about the reduction of chemistry to physics, nonetheless it is concluded in Garc?a Sucre and Bunge (1981) that "quantum chemistry makes room for a concept of molecular shape, recently criticised by Woolley". But Woolley did not deny that a quantum chemical system "will extend over the entire space and its shape will be a closed surface infinitely far removed from the origin of the reference frame"; and he would agree that it "lacks a definite size" (as Garc?a-Sucre and Bunge say). Woolley's point was that the classical concept of molecule cannot be derived "ab initio" from quantum mechan ics. The classical concept of molecule does not allow each molecule to "extend over the entire space".32 Another way to put the same point is: quantum chemistry regards the existence of molecules beyond any doubt and doesn't ask what quantum mechanics has to say about it (Primas 1983,292). Quantum chemistry borrows the notion of molecular structure from classical chemistry. Perhaps for experiments on single molecules, the chemical concept of molecular structure is not needed. After all, chemistry is the science of the transformation of materials, not of the properties of single molecules. This might be an example of where one shouldn't simply assume that in all experimental contexts chemistry and physics have the same interests. Of course quantum mechanics has structure, but Woolley (1986) is surely correct to say that: 'quantum structure' is not synonymous with the classical terms 'shape' and 'size' ... the van't Hoff notion of molecular structure is irreducible in classical chemistry - it is not derived from more primitive notions-we might expect a deductive account of the behaviour and properties of molecules according to quantum theory in which the same notion of</page><page sequence="15">CHEMISTRY OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCES 267 molecular structure is a derived concept. The 'problem' of molecular structure arises because quantum chemistry has not achieved this result. And also (Woolley 1991,26): According to classical chemistry, ... [CoHo] is associated with seven distinct substances distinguished from each other by different chemical and physical properties,... So, in some sense, these seven substances (and indeed any other closed system corresponding to the given number of electrons and nuclei) must share the same Hamiltonian, but the nature of this relationship has never been elucidated. The reason such considerations are easily dismissed as contentious is, I believe, due to the fact that microreductionism is presupposed as the goal of science and requires no further discussion. Even those who see problems for a smooth reduction of chemistry to quantum mechanics seem to adhere to this view. For example, Weininger (1984), who in a review on these issues gives a sympathetic hearing to views like those of Woolley (1978), says the difference between such views and of those, for example Bader (1990), who defend a reductionistic picture, is due to differing presuppositions. He doesn't however say what the differences are. Moreover Weininger says that Bader's approach "is firmly grounded in standard quantum mechanics" (Weininger 1984, 943). But Bader, for one, is very explicit about his presuppositions:33 A scientific discipline starts with the classification of observations. It becomes exact, in the sense that predictions become possible, as soon as the classification represents the physics that underlies an observation. From such a perspective the fact that ab initio methods are approximative and guided by observations will be no problem; it is all part of getting closer to the truth, the essence of which has been specified a priori. It is not some thing that needs empirical evidence (except for vague hand-waving towards the progress of physics). Moreover Bader accepts boundary conditions in his quantum mechanical definitions, the plausibility of which is justified with reference to "the incorporation of these chemical observations into the fabric of quantum mechanics" (1990,5), or general ontological premis es like "[a]toms are objects in real space" (1990, 3). Bader (1990, 249) admits that "the total electron density distribution in a molecule shows no indication of discrete bonding or non-bonding electron pairs". But this merely raises the question (Bader 1990,252): "Where then to look for the Lewis model, a model which in the light of its ubiquitous and constant use throughout chemistry must most certainly be rooted in the physics governing a molecular system". The answer is that (Bader 1990,248): "the Lewis model of the electron pair ... does find a more abstract but no less real physical expression in the topological properties of the Laplacian of</page><page sequence="16">268 J. VAN BRAKEL the charge density". Were Bader's proposals to be criticised, this would be an "in-house" technical discussion and would never undermine the reduc tionistic programme. The question to which the (fallible) answer is a reply, presupposes that reduction is a necessary characteristic of science. If Bader agreed with the criticism, this would only mean that some other quantum mechanical parameter would have to be found to do the job. 6. ESSENCES? In this section I'll address the question whether substances have essences, putting aside quantum mechanical considerations and worries about the distinction between physics and chemistry. It is common to combine or even identify reductionism and essentialism: "(the concept, the laws governing) water can be reduced to (the concept, the laws governing) H2O" becomes the same as "the essence of water is H2O".34 On such a microreductive picture, (chemical or physical) water really is H2O. H2O is the essence of the substance which, on the macrolevel, is called water. The essence of being H2O is invariant and determines (together with essences of other substances) the variation of manifest properties in different contexts. On this view the manifest properties are not epiphenomena; they are real, but supervene on the microproperties. Note first that there is no need to postulate microscopic essences to establish that what seems to be different is in fact the same substance. For example, one could say that liquid water and water vapour are the same substances because both are H2O. But one could also say that they are the same because if water is evaporated and then re-condenses, the "same" water comes back (cf. Section 3). Therefore, one can say that being ice, or being liquid water, or being water vapour supervenes on being the sub stance WATER, without being committed to any microreductive theory about water, let alone to any particular theory. Perhaps one needs some theoretical perspective to consider apparently different things as the same (Wiggins 1980), but it doesn't have to be an appeal to microproperties.35 There are good macroscopic reasons (in the manifest as well as the sci entific image) to consider water as a substance, independent of leanings towards microreduction.36 Similarly, one doesn't need to believe in DNA or something similar to conclude that certain butterflies and caterpillars are different forms of the same species.37 The response of the microreductionist will be to say that the microscopic theory explains that liquid-water and vapour-water are the same substance by pointing out that what remains the same are the molecules and what differs is their average speed. It might be suggested that all these variations</page><page sequence="17">CHEMISTRY OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCES 269 of macroscopic properties depend on (microreductive) essences, which are indiscernible for the same substance. The argument would presumably run as follows: (a) On the phenomenal level there are only appearances which arise out of complex interactions of real essences of substances. For example, although water is usually considered transparent, a thick layer of water may look blue. The visual appearance not only depends on the properties of what it is an appearance of (in this case water), but also on the unique context in which the water, its observer, and the background lighting are situated. Still, it would be "the same" water, because the underlying essence (being H2O) would remain the same; only the appearance is different in different contexts. (b) At the macroscopic physical level there are properties like solidity and boiling point. If they appear to vary with context this shows that they are merely contingent properties, nominal essences in Locke's sense. Variations with context of macroscopic physical parameters are due to differences in the way real essences interact. (c) What, in the end, there is, is to be found on the level of molecules (or whatever the "real" constituents of substances might turn out to be). At this level there are, for one substance, only identical entities. But if we look at some details, it is not clear what molecular essences being identical or invariant amounts to. Take the philosopher's favourite, "being identical molecule for molecule".38 It leaves unclear what exactly is assumed to be identical (and indiscernible). Does the identity include the velocities and relative positions of the molecules? If it does, then it undermines the idea of macroscopic objects being identical "molecule for molecule", because the velocities and relative positions of the mole cules are constantly changing. If it does not, then, say, temperature would be excluded as a relevant macroscopic parameter for two objects being (in)discernible. At the microscopic level everything is statistical and chang ing ? hence no two things are ever the same in the actual world. These variations are averaged out, at least by approximation, at the macrolevel, but that is not the level the microreductionist wants as a base. Secondly, philosophers tend to believe that water consists of H2O molecules, but this is incorrect. The underlying microscopic essences vary as much with context or circumstance as the nominal essences. For exam ple, in liquid water there are H3O+ and OH" ions, which are absent in the vapour form of water. On the other hand there are H^-molecules, as well as other t^O-polymers in water vapour.39 And how much there is of each "water-type" depends on the temperature and other contextual variables. The pragmatic answer that water is predominantly H2O is not</page><page sequence="18">270 J. VAN BRAKEL sufficient if we are looking for essences. A few dissolved Na+ and OH~ ions (a drop of sodium hydroxide) don't belong to water. Conversely the OH~ ions (of the electrolyte water), that were already there, do belong to "normal" liquid water. It is not that we are unsure which (distribution of types of) microstructure is the correct one. The point is that there is not one correct microstructure, because the microstructure also depends on the context. For more complex substances the idea of molecular essences becomes even less tractable. Strictly speaking, the concept "molecule" cannot be applied to metals, salts, electrolytes (including water) and dissociating liquids. Phenomena like acidity or electric conductivity cannot be under stood in terms of molecules. Is it self-evident that charcoal and diamond (or yellow and blue topaz) are the same substance? Enantiomers cannot, normally, be separated by physical means, though chemists consider them to be a mixture of two chemical substances.40 Large molecules (polymers, enzymes, viruses) are only approximately the same, even at the level of composition. The difficulty of finding the "true" essence of substances is one of a piece with the nature of chemical laws. According to Proust's law (1799), any pure chemical compound is made up of its constituent elements in definite and invariant proportions (by mass). The law seems to draw a sharp distinction between compounds and solutions, though there is no such sharp boundary. In particular the law only applies approximately to network solids (crystals and polymers).41 The same is the case for Dalton's law (1808), which says that if two "elementary particles" A and B unite to form more than one compound, then the invariant amounts of B which unite with the same mass of A in the various compounds are in the ratio of simple whole numbers. As Duhem said, the law is a truism because any ratio can be expressed as the ratio of whole numbers to within any desired precision.42 One might perhaps suggest that what all samples of water have in common is that, if pure, they only contain hydrogen and oxygen in a proportion two to one, and this is what H2O means. However, as stated, this is not a microscopic essence (no assumptions being made about atoms or molecules), and taken literally it doesn't distinguish between water and a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in a proportion of two to one. Therefore, one might wish to add that the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen interact in some way and that it is this interaction that constitutes the essence of water. However, in order to know what sort of interaction there will be and how this sort of interaction depends on the circumstances (such as the temperature), we have to know more about what hydrogen and oxygen</page><page sequence="19">CHEMISTRY OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCES 271 are. This leads us to the problem of isotopes.43 Heavy water may seem chemically the same as normal water (having only an extra neutron in the hydrogen nucleus), but it doesn't boil at 100 ?C and organisms die when forced to live on/in it.44 If the essence of molecules is to be defined in terms of constituting atoms, clearly this will only work if atoms have/are essences. One problem of defining the essence of an atom has already been hinted at: Isn't it part of the essence of a particular element that it forms certain chemical bonds with other elements (atoms, ions, radicals) with certain properties? But even if one considers an element severed from the rest of the world, it is not clear what its essence could be. The problem encountered with finding the essence of substances in terms of molecular structure repeats itself at a lower level. Consider as an example Krypton.45 The alleged essence of an element is its atomic number. Kripke (1980) made gold famous for having the atomic number 79. On such an essentialist reading: (1) Krypton is the chemical element with atomic number 36. If true, (1) is necessarily true. The expressions on both sides of the identity are rigid designators; both refer to the same entity in all possible worlds. This is the received Kripkean view. Now let's look somewhat further into the meaning of the right-hand side of (1). The meaning of (2) having atomic number 36 is, narrowly, that it refers to an atom with 36 protons in the nucleus and 36 electrons around it. The number of neutrons varies for different isotopes of the same chemical element. For example, the isotope Krypton-86 has 36 protons and 50 neutrons in its nucleus (as well as 36 electrons around it). Hence (2) is ambiguous because it rigidly designates a number of different isotopes. One of the many properties of Krypton-86 is: (3) Krypton-86 can be in the 2pl0 and 5d5 states. However Krypton is not the only element for which (3) is true. But what is unique for Krypton-86, among other things, is that it (4) has the property that radiation of a particular wavelength is emitted when there is a transition between the levels 2pl0 and 5d5 of the krypton-86 atom. which property is determined by the whole configuration of elementary particles which constitute a Krypton-86 isotope. In Kripke's terminology:</page><page sequence="20">272 J. VAN BRAKEL there are no possible worlds that contain Krypton-86 which do not have property (4). Hence not only (2), but also (4), rigidly designates the (same) substance Krypton-86.46 One might wish to argue that the only necessary essential, property of Krypton-86 is that it consists of 36 electrons, 36 protons, and 50 neu trons. But this will not do, because (say) one copper-65 isotope and seven hydrogen-3 isotopes together consist of the same numbers of elementary particles. What distinguishes Krypton from the weird mixture of copper plus hydrogen is that in Krypton the 36 electrons etc. are related to one another in a certain way. If (1) is necessary (if true), then most or all properties of the Krypton electron configuration etc. must be necessary properties (if they are true properties), including (4). This simply follows by fleshing out Kripke's crude examples with some scientific detail. From this example one can see that there isn't just one essential micro property, but a whole range of such "essential" properties. Moreover, these essential microproperties are not independent of context ?at best they are constant over a certain range of "ordinary" contexts. To paraphrase Good man: if there is an essence there are many, and if many none.47 Not only is there a proliferation of micro-essences on Kripke's account. If microscopic properties are necessary, then so are all macroscopic properties which can be used to fix the reference of a substance (van Brakel 1986). There are two major reasons for this. First, as already discussed, not only macroscopic but also microproperties are dependent on the context. Second, for Kripkean substances it is not possible to distinguish between what is a counterfactual situation (a different possible world) and what another context. This means that, for example, (5) the chemical element with atomic number 53 and (6) the pure substance that has a melting point of 113.5 ?C are both rigid designators. Both (5) and (6) apply to iodine, a posteriori and necessarily (in Kripke's sense). It is as much part of being a pure substance that it has a certain atomic structure (in this case that of iodine), representing the disposition to react in certain ways with other substances, as that it has a fixed melting point (in this case 113.5 ?C). If the scientific theory about a substance is true, then both types of properties are equally necessary. It may seem that "being H2O" is more essential than, say, "being a substance having minimum density in the liquid phase at 3.98 ?C", because the first has more explanatory power and tells us about the underlying structure.</page><page sequence="21">CHEMISTRY OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCES 273 However, such epistemological considerations do not bear on the modal status of these statements. The marking of boundaries at the microscopic or "real essence" level is just as natural or conventional as the marking of boundaries on the macroscopic or "phenomenal" level. Finally, coming back to the last part of the previous section, the interac tion between hydrogen and oxygen in H2O (or between composing quarks or whatever) is probably to be specified by a kind of superposition of quantum mechanical wave equations. Passing over the fact that it is not altogether clear what a superposition of wave equations means for a macro scopic system, the result will certainly look quite complicated. Why would we choose one set of equations as the essence of water and not another? Because they are the equations that depend on being water. We may as well contemplate the quantum mechanical equations for milk or for the Second World War. What criteria could we use to decide which of these equations represent the essences of substances and which heterogeneous mixtures? Precisely: the substances (like ordinary water) that have already been identified at the macroscopic level.48 7. CONCLUSION My conclusions are brief. Macroscopic considerations (knowledge, know how, intuitions, background assumptions) cannot be eliminated from the final grounding of knowledge claims about chemical substances. Reduc tion, either of chemistry to microphysics, or, more generally, of the manifest to the scientific doesn't work. Similarly, within chemistry (and physics) it is not the case that the microdescription will, in principle, always give a more complete description. If quantum mechanics turns out to be wrong, it would not affect all chemical knowledge. If molecular chemistry (chem ical atomism) were wrong, it wouldn't disqualify all knowledge about, say, water. What there is, are chemical and physical descriptions of macro scopic entities, whose identity conditions are grounded in the end, in the manifest image. The point is not a "purely instrumentalist" or "anti-realist" or "construc tive empiricist" one. I don't argue against the reality of atoms, or quarks, or the relevance of the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics to the reality of the physical world at some level of description.49 All this can claim reality (both the table and the elementary particles; both the quarks and the wave equations). Only if the issue of primacy is brought up, the answer is that the manifest image has priority relative to the scientific image, and not the other way round. In a way this is a rather trivial point. The manifest image is the highest meta-level where questions of justifica</page><page sequence="22">274 J. VAN BRAKEL tion stop and an appeal is made to certainties not grounded in the scientific image. Dirac (1929, 714, emphasis added) said: "The underlying laws neces sary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that exact applications of these laws lead to equations which are too complicated to be soluble". To emphasise the difficulty of solving equations misses the point that "quantum chemistry beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approxi mation cannot claim to have a well-defined set of equations that determine the quantum states of molecules in general ... the difficulty is not the complications of the equations; rather it is the lack of appropriate equa tions" (Woolley 1991, 42, 44). But even if Dirac were right or if he were right when he said: "that the whole history of the universe corresponds to properties of the whole sequence of natural numbers" (Dirac 1939), what sort of criteria would be used to judge which of Dirac's views, if any, are right? Presumably, they would be the sort of criteria that are used to judge whether one theory or explanation is better than another. But it is impos sible to give precise rules for making such decisions. Moreover, whatever these rules would be, they are not part of physical or mathematical theories (van Brakel 1996a).50 NOTES 1 Part of this sentence, the next, and a few sentences in Section 2 are taken from van Brakel (1991a). 2 Assuming the pressure is kept constant, etc. Universal statements about scientific "facts", governed by "laws" and "theories", are always ceteris paribus. Water boils at 100 ?C, but not if it is sea water, when it is boiled on top of the Mount Everest, or if its liquid-vapour interface is curved, and so on (van Brakel 1986). Although contentious, there are good arguments to support all phenomenological laws being ceteris paribus, whereas all theo retical laws apply to models, not to the world (Cartwright 1983). 3 The older definition is quoted from (Kekul? 1859, 3). Davy expressed similar views in 1802 (Siegfried and Dobbs 1968). Although Lavoisier (1789) supported an atomic view of matter, his chemical theory was about a macroscopic world, not a microscopic one. For recent support of this view see Bohr (1932), Primas (1975b; 1983, 327), Timmermans (1963), van Brakel (1986). 4 Issues arising in connection with quantum electrodynamics won't be addressed, but I believe that if they are brought in, they would strengthen my conclusions; cf. Cao and Schweber (1993), Maudlin (1996), Robinson (1995). 5 Following Oppenheim &amp; Putnam (1958) and Nagel (1961), there is an extensive literature distinguishing various kinds of reduction (e.g. Agazzi 1991; Batterman 1995; Brooks 1994; Hooker 1981; Sarkar 1992). But almost all these accounts deal only with physics and/or biology and/or psychology. In a rare case where the author is solely concerned with chem istry standard accounts of reduction are not considered applicable (Levy 1979). Attempts to</page><page sequence="23">CHEMISTRY OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCES 275 define reduction(s) more carefully would, in my opinion, not be of much help in addressing the issues raised in this paper. 6 A chemical molecule has identifiable atoms kept in place by rather fixed chemical bonds; physical molecules don't. A chemical electron has a fixed mass and an infinite lifetime; a physical electron has a variable mass and a finite lifetime. 7 Pre-Avogadro chemists used the terms 'atom' and 'molecule' interchangeable. 'Atomism' across centuries means (in this paper) that the atoms are either the four elements water, fire, earth, and water, or the three principles Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt, or..., or Lavoisier's 33 simple substances, or..., or atoms, or molecules, or..., or quarks, or..., or the referents of a hidden variable interpretation of quantum mechanics, or ? 8 The first occasion when the concept of chemical compound was presented to a scientific audience was in 1718 when E. F. Geoffroy presented his Table des diff?rent rapports to the Royal Academy of Science in Paris (Klein 1994). According to Geoffroy there is no difference between the synthesis of chemical artifacts based on chemical affinity and the resynthesis of natural bodies - a difference that had governed both theory and practice until then. The concepts Geoffroy was using and developing were no longer explained invoking a theory of natural philosophy, but emerged from the practice of chemical operations and experiments. Geoffroy 's table was the prototype for a whole range of tables of affinity that were developed on the model of Newton's gravitational theory. But the original table of Geoffroy was, according to Klein, not modelled on Newton's theory, but a syst?matisation of the practical knowledge of metallurgists and pharmacists. See also Siegfried and Dobbs (1968) on the influence of Swedish mineralogists on these developments. 9 Until the 1870s Kekul? rejected the idea that chemical formulae represent "real" mole cules (Brock 1992). Until 1886, the atomic theory was not taught in French secondary schools (because it was only a hypothesis). Boltzmann describes his molecular gas theory as nothing but a conventional analogy. Poincar? said "we" accept the atomic theory because "we" are familiar with the game of billiards. Ostwald converted to believing in atoms in 1906. 10 Few writers (including quantum chemists) would draw this conclusion, imposing the "old" notions onto the quantum mechanical formalism (see below). 11 "What has happened is that, when it was discovered that water was composed of H2O, a new use of the word came in alongside the old, as the OED correctly records. But the old has survived as an alternative" (Hare 1984, 13). LaPorte (1996) and others have made the similar but more general point (in connection with Putnam's Twin Earth and related exam ples) that how the use of ordinary language terms will develop in response to discoveries is open and is not bound to follow the dominant scientific discourse. 12 "It is commonly said that the property of being water supervenes on the chemical (or ultimately on the physical) property of being H2O.As it stands this view seems to me to be obviously false (which is why I have not been so bold as to ascribe it to anyone). It is false because the word 'water' came into use long before anybody had heard of chemical properties or natural kinds" (Hare 1984, 12). 12 Cf. Forbes (1985, 199): "We expect the superficial and easily detectable differences between pieces of stuff to reflect fundamental differences which explain the superficial ones, and it is the fundamental differences which have the final say in classification; so someone who refuses to classify samples in this way may fairly be said not to understand what a substance is". But what sort of criteria are to be used to assess whether Forbes understands what a substance is? 14 Metereologica, 354b27; cf. 340a24-b3, 341b7-ll, 383al-2, 383a7-8, 388bl0; and also Problemata, 932-937.</page><page sequence="24">276 J. VAN BRAKEL 15 Compare Croker's Dictionary (1766, emphasis added): "Water, in general implies a pellucid fluid, convertible into ice by cold; naturally pervading the strata of the earth, and flowing or stagnating on its surface ... the difference of common water, arising from the circumstances of stagnation of motion, or of its containing more or less of those stony particles, which it always contains in some degree, are not so essential, as to prevent the whole from being considered as of only one kind. Simple, or pure water, in a just sense of the word, is not met with any where". After it had been decided/discovered in 1727 that air was not an element, but a mixture and (in 1781) that water was not an element, but a compound consisting of "inflammable air" and "vital air", the description of the stereotype did not change significantly. See, for example, the 1797 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. 16 Quotations from Hare (1984). 17 However, if Aristotle's ideas about "substance" (or "movement", etc.) are at issue, or if it is said that he was or was not an atomist, it makes good sense to raise the issue of incom mensurability, in particular in the sense that this notion is used in the later publications of Kuhn, where it gains an explicitly positive reading. Or, in a slogan: incommensurability is the motor of rationality. See Kuhn (1989, 1991, 1993). 18 So called "unit operations" in chemical engineering traditionally fall apart in mechanical operations (like grinding coal), physical operations (like drying polymer granules), and chemical operations (involving chemical reactions). Moreover, in practice, any chemical reaction is dependent on physical transport phenomena (of mass, heat, and momentum). 19 The reduction of non-chemical, macroscopic (phenomenological) physics to quantum mechanics is little more than afata morgana. Physicists like Bohr and Heisenberg were well aware of the problem of the role of the ineliminability of classical physics in measurements that lend empirical support for quantum mechanics, and there has been no serious attempt to dissolve this problem. Further, notwithstanding the wish to find a Theory of Everything, current proposals for unification are little more than attempts to combine, without too many unrealistic assumptions, purely formal structures into one unified structure. Not only philosophers say this. See for example, quotes of Feynman and other physicists in Gleick (1992) and Maudlin (1996). Cf. also Heisenberg (1971, 129) and Bell (quoted in Bernstein 1991, 52). Cf. also Redhead (1991): "It is generally agreed that the present state of the universe is the outcome of a series of randomly occurring symmetry breakings, which means that the TOE [Theory Of Everything] cannot itself predict many of the universe's essential features as we currently observe it - a very important limitation on what TOEs can be expected to deliver, even in principle". 20 See Gibbs (1902, ch. XIV); cf. Bumstead (1928, xxiv-xxv): "nothing is assumed as to the mechanical nature of the systems considered, except that they are mechanical and obey Lagrange's or Hamilton's equations". For a recent expression of this view see Denbigh (1981,4). 21 All page references are to Churchland (1989), in which the quoted articles have been reprinted. 22 How one should deal with chemical reactions that do not develop towards thermodynamic equilibrium (like oscillating reactions) is even less clear and leads to the contentious views of Prigogine (Verstraeten 1991) and the dubious status of irreversible thermodynamics. For an example of the nonsense to which the apriorism of irreversible thermodynamics can lead, see van Brakel (1975, 2121). 23 In thermodynamics entropy is additive and non-decreasing; Boltzmann's entropy only displays the first; Gibbs's entropy only displays the second (Sklar 1993, 354-9). 24 R is the gas constant. 25 Aristotle (On Coming-to-be and Passing-away, I. 10) already noted that mixing was a</page><page sequence="25">CHEMISTRY OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCES 277 problem for any kind of atomism. In physical chemistry one talks about solutions, mixtures, suspensions, colloids, alloys, etc. which are all defined as something being distributed uni formly in a continuous medium, but at the atomic level this is a contradictio in terminis. Later Duhem used a similar argument when opposing atomistic interpretations of (chemi cal) substances. Cf. Needham (1996a). 26 According to Gibbs's phase rule a system of c components in p phases has c ? p + 2 degrees of freedom. 27 This is the case in particular for three-phase systems containing solid-liquid, liquid vapour, and solid-vapour interfaces. Conceptual confusions, together with the extreme difficulty of carrying out contaminant-free experiments in this area of physical chemistry have led to such embarrassments as the polywater episode (van Brakel 1993). 28 "The" environment, consisting of the rest of the universe, can never be given a precise description. It must therefore be replaced by a model environment which mimics certain aspects of the real situation (Amann 1990). 29 For an example, see Allchin (1996). The smallest functional unit for the so-called "ox phos" reactions was a small membranous vesicle, a kind of bag with enzymes. At first, chemists aimed at trying to eliminate the membrane to get at the "essential" enzymes, thereby destroying a fundamental feature of the very system they hoped to understand. For example, it was necessary to know the membrane's permeability to various ions, especially protons, in order to sort out the reaction mechanisms. 30 There are properties, like the charge of an elementary particle, that behave like classical properties, i.e. they have no holistic correlations with other particles. In a way, this makes quantum mechanics and classical physics even more difficult to reconcile. Amann (1993) has proposed that the notion of a Gestalt might be helpful to get a handle on the problem of a system having holistic correlations with its environment, which are, as it were, severed when observed - when the particular Gestalt emerges from the holistic relations. On this view classical molecular observables can be generated by coupling a single molecule to its environment. But this is an interpretation that is clearly supplementary to the statistical formalism of quantum mechanics. The quantum statistical description mixes all possible shapes etc. into one "statistical pulp". 31 See Scerri (1991, 1993) for a discussion of Bohr's appeal to a non-mechanical constraint (a Zwang) to save the quantum numbers. The view that each electron is in a stationary state is at the basis of the current approach to chemistry teaching, but only the atomic system as a whole possesses stationary states. 32 The quantum mechanical "molecule" is similar to the Stoic view according to which oxygen and hydrogen in water would occupy the same place (cf. Needham 1997). Dropping atoms and molecules as individual objects completely, as mere parochial anthropomorphic projections, would leave room for both quantum mechanics and thermodynamics (as well as the continuity hypothesis that is typical for the manifest image). 33 Bader, Popelier &amp; Keith (1994). The original reads: "Eine wissenschaftliche Disziplin beginnt mit der empirischen Klassifizierung von Beobachtungen. Sie wird exakt in dem Sinne, da? Vorhersagen m?glich sind, sobald die Klassifizierung die Physik widerspiegelt, die einer Beobachtung zugrundeliegt". 34 For example, in the sense of Kripke (1980) and Putnam (1975, 1990). For a critical discussion see van Brakel (1986). 35 See van Brakel (1991b) for illustrations of natural kinds that are not "grounded" in microreduction, for example the Cheyenne category vovetas which includes most vultures, the common nighthawk, swarms of green darners, swarms of red skimmers, and tornado's. 36 In discussions for and against folk-psychology, eliminativists often point out that science</page><page sequence="26">278 J. VAN BRAKEL has shown that phlogiston and witches don't exist. Hence they infer by analogy: future science will not only overthrow folk psychology, but everything. "The familiar multitude of putatively natural kinds embraced by common sense, and by the many derivative sciences, are at best merely practical kinds. Genuine natural kinds form a very small, aristocratic elite among kinds in general, being found only in the most basic laws of an all-embracing physics. And if there are no such laws, or if the human cognitive medium should turn out to be a representational cripple, then perhaps there are no natural kinds at all" (Churchland 1989, 295). But such a global analogy would only have force if there were any chance that a later physics would force us to give up the "folk" idea that water is a natural kind (cf. Section 3). 37 Dupr? (1991) gives many examples from folk and scientific biology that undermine attempts at reduction or essentialism in that domain. 38 Note that if we tie "exactly alike" to "having the same essence", supervenience might be invoked to support all properties of natural kinds being essential. Cf. Mellor (1977), van Brakel (1986). 39 Water molecules too, in the liquid phase do form larger structures under certain condi tions (van Brakel 1993). 40 It is possible to separate enantiomers by first carrying out a chemical reaction with another pure enantiomer. The resulting products can be separated by physical means and, by carrying out another chemical reaction, one can obtain separately the two enantiomers of the original mixture in pure form. Many enantiomers can be separated by crystallisation and subsequent manual separation of the crystals (which are each other's images) ? so one might suggest that physical separation of enantiomers is possible in principle. 41 According to Christie (1994) this shows that chemical laws are approximate in a sense different from the way Cartwright (1983) argues theoretical laws of physics are approxi mate (cf. Note 2). 42 Think of applying the law to hydrocarbons. Cf. Polanyi (1964, 40-43). 43 Following Paneth, the IUPAC defined a chemical element in 1923 as a substance of which all atoms have the same nuclear charge (see Scerri 1993 for historical details). Re structuring chemistry on the basis of isotopy would have led to the demise of the periodic system. Here chemistry did not follow the path to reduction because of developments in physics. The periodic system cannot be deduced from quantum mechanics, contrary to the impression Bohr may have given. Contrary to his own claims "Bohr populated the electron shells while trying to maintain agreement with the known experimental facts" (Scerri 1993). This interpretation is supported by many sources (see quotations from MacKinnon, Hund, Kragh, Heisenberg, and Pauli in Scerri 1993, 50-51). 44 At an even lower level of description there is the difference between ortho and para hydrogen (H2). They have the same chemical properties, but differ in the orientation of nuclear spin. Because of their difference in molecular energy levels, some physical proper ties, in particular the specific heat, are different. 45 An earlier version of the remainder of this section is in van Brakel (1990). 46 It follows that the definition of one metre based on the Krypton-86 transition level men tioned in [4] is a necessary statement (van Brakel 1990). 47 It is a paraphrase of "If there is one world, there are many, and if many none". Cf. Elgin and Goodman (1989, 49-53). 48 That the manifest image determines which microessences are to be selected is also pre supposed in sophisticated philosophical discussions. For example, Blackburn (1985, 62) says in his discussion of "being water supervening on being H2O": "if we had an argument that it [i.e. H2O] does not have to be water ... then we would just change the basis for the</page><page sequence="27">CHEMISTRY OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SUBSTANCES 279 supervenience. We would [argue] for a releasing property, R, and the true basis upon which being water supervenes would be ... (being H2O) and being ?". 49 That doesn't mean that I argue against or deny unifications. There are many other paths to unification apart from reduction (or supervenience or eliminativism). For example, physi cal chemistry (thermodynamics, colloid chemistry, interface chemistry, quantum chemistry) unifies, to a certain extent, physics and chemistry. 501 gratefully acknowledge detailed and critical comments on an earlier draft by two anony mous referees. I don't expect they will now agree with everything I say, but their comments gave me the opportunity to revise passages that could easily have been misinterpreted.
