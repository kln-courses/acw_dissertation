<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Cameroon to Paris: Mousgoum Architecture In and Out of Africa. By Steven Nelson. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2007. Pp. xiv, 247; 100 b+w illustrations, 9 color plates. $50. 00/Â£31. 50 cloth. From Cameroon to Paris focuses on Mousgoum architecture, particularly the earthen dome structure known as the teleuk (pl. teleukakay). The first chapter defines the typical homestead in its historical context and destabilizes assumed notions of the primacy of the domed form. While two non-domical forms of Mousgoum structures were historically used, they are not well defined. In effect, the text destabilizes the primacy of the teleuk only to refocus attention almost exclusively on it. Is this a troubling reflection of art history's fixation with the visually pleasing? Should the emphasis be justified by the contemporary use of the teleuk as a symbol of Mousgoum culture? Regardless, the definition of these non-domical forms requires greater clarification. Gender issues in terms of construction and symbolism, architectural anthropomorphism, and common aesthetics with dance are explored in detail. It is argued that Mousgoum archi-</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 369 tecture revolves around such concerns as the mastery of nature, nourishment, and procreation. The second chapter reviews the encounters of three travel writers, Heinrich Barth, Olive MacLeod, and Andre Gide, with Mousgoum architecture. The genre is characterized by the common tone of a scientifically significant exploration beset with death and the descent into a primordial past in which the author, paradoxically, is the main subject. Barriers between subject and object break down as the viewer identifies with the teleuk' s unusual domical form. The resulting anxiety is resolved by historicizing the architecture, disassociating its architects, feminizing and even sexualizing the domestic landscape. The third chapter delves into the use of a teleuk during the 1931 International Colonial Exposition in Paris. The architecture of the Exposition is presented as a reification of the French colonial policy of association, and a delicate balancing act between suggesting the benefits to both colonizer and colonized while maintaining their distance. As with travel writing, the teleuk served a pivotal role in the construction of an "Other" that was truly meant to reflect the viewer. The issue of feminizing the teleuk is notably absent in this chapter. The fourth chapter focuses on the recent rebuilding of teleukakay in Cameroon and introduction of mural painting by women. Nelson considers these actions in terms of processes of reinvention through which the Mousgoum engage both with their own past and with the rest of the world. This chapter emphasizes first the multivocal quality of these projects, and second the Mousgoum interest in these projects primarily for a sense of continuity rather than for preservation. Nelson's interpretation of the murals on the facade of the palace of the ruler of Pouss seems to have been shortchanged in the final chapter. Wild animals are vaguely equated with figures in unidentified myths and fables. Might not tourism or tropes of conquering the wilderness be more important concerns? The teapot on the facade is connected to ideas of goodwill and the home, when in my opinion it is more convincingly connected to the ever present water container for performing ritual ablutions; i.e., as an indicator of Islamic identity. Finally, the interpretation of the star and crescent as a turban, and thereby a general symbol of spirituality, depends on the work of Seyyed Hoseyn Nasr. I worry that the specific context has not been addressed. If indeed the star and crescent is to be interpreted as a turban, then one might discern a more specific meaning by drawing upon more relevant sources. ' While the book as a whole is well written and presents exciting material, the chapters on travel writing and the 1931 Exposition are the most developed and theoretically intriguing. Nelson's arguments in the first and fourth chapters are often limited by isolating the Mousgoum from surrounding cultures. For instance, he notes the use of a rectilinear house for a ruler, yet never mentions scholarly 1 Yoshihito Shimada, "Formation de la civilization 'complexe' Islam et vetements en Afrique sub-saharienne: Etude de cas de l'Adamawa," Senri Ethnological Studies 31 (1992), 373- 421.</page><page sequence="3">370 Book Reviews discussions concerning rectilinear structures and Islamic architecture (pp. 22-24). Arguments similar to Nelson's (p. 34) in relating Mousgoum concepts of gender with homestead arrangement, cardinal directions, and elevation have been made in connection to Doulo culture in the Extreme North of Cameroon.2 Despite my few criticisms, this book is a valuable contribution toward correcting the paucity of scholarly attention to such an extraordinary architectural tradition. It is noteworthy in its approach, recognizing the multiple meanings that can be ascribed to the same architectural creation depending on the viewer and context. Moreover, it is significant that Nelson presents the teleuk as one, albeit very important, element of a Mousgoum architectural culture that continues to engage with issues on local as well as more wide ranging stages.
