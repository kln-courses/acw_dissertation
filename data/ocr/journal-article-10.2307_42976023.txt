<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chapter Seven The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self In this chapter I will review the modern discourse on myth by Claude Lévi- Strauss, and its expansion by Roland Barthes on the codes contained in literature and ideology. Barthes' work on images and ideologies is extended by the French sociologist Jean Baudrillard, in his use of language/signifiers to supplant and override the use/exchange value inherited from Marxist political economy in a new society formed by the simulacra. These dis- courses on mythic images of self and how they function in this new postcapitalist system will be considered through a science-fiction film nar- rative, Solaris (1972), adapted and directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. The film is based upon a novel by Stanislaw Lem. After the analysis of this film, the implications of such life histories, using the new electronic media of film and television for adult education, is presented. Lévi-Strauss, Barthes, and Baudrillard on Cultural Symbolism In his introduction to Structural Anthropology (1963), Lévi-Strauss claims that the historian's goal differs from that of the anthropologist. The goal of the anthropologist "is to grasp, beyond the conscious and always shifting images which men hold, the complete range of unconscious possi- bilities" (23). He further states that the task of the social anthropologist is to dig beneath "representations and actions of men" in which political his-</page><page sequence="2">120 The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self tory "chronologically strings together dynasties and wars." Therefore he insists that although the historians' desire for a framework with which to interpret the past is commendable, their linear transitions from one histori- cal event to another require, to some degree, the aid of unconscious elaborations by the anthropologist who intuitively seconds the historian. Lévi-Strauss writes about the road toward an understanding of humankind: They [the historian and the anthropologist] have undertaken the same journey on the same road in the same direction; only their orientation is different. The an- thropologist goes forward, seeking to attain, through the conscious, of which he is always aware more and more of the unconscious; whereas the historian ad- vances, so to speak, backward, keeping his eyes fixed on concrete and specific activities from which he withdraws only to consider them from a more complete and richer perspective. A true two-faced Janus, it is the solidarity of the two disciplines that makes it possible to keep the whole road in sight. (1963:24) The influence of Marxist historical materialism on the thoughts of Lévi-Strauss helps one grasp the notion that "man" collectively does not consciously know how the mind organizes the social structures of society, or what laws affect such social organization. Thus, consciousness does not determine human existence but, on the contrary, it is social existence, as expressed through myths and rituals, that determines human conscious- ness. But Lévi-Strauss does not use this materialist law related to economic modes of production, nor the Freudian biological law of instinctual drives. Yet he seizes upon the Freudian sense of the unconscious when he stresses that language is a social phenomenon that obeys structural laws of logic at a linguistic level independent of the user (1963:57). Thus, the linguistic character of language shapes society and this in turn shapes the character of human beings. This structural law of language in itself becomes the most formative feature behind human beings and their social and cultural constructs. Lévi-Strauss is indebted to "semiology," the linguistic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure. Semiology is a science (logos) of signs (semeia). Saussure argued in his book, Course in General Linguistics (1916), that language should be analyzed in terms of its internal structure - as a formal system within itself - and not in terms of its content or what it refers to. His model identifies the formal laws that structure speech or spoken language. His method, now called structuralism, is comprised of binary pairs of op- posites that inform structural analysis - between langue and parole, signifier and signified, system and realization, paradigmatic and syntagmatic, synchrony and diachrony. The simplicity of this method was</page><page sequence="3">The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self 1 2 1 appropriated by other structuralist thinkers in different forms of discourse: first by Lévi-Strauss in the discourse on myth, then later by Roland Barthes on the semic codes in literature and ideology, and further by Jean Baudrillard in his use of signs/simulacra to override the use/exchange value inherited from the Marxian concept of historical materialism. Besides his elemental researches into the three principles of kinship corresponding to the three universal principles of the human mind, Lévi- Strauss concentrated on the varying systems of myth within a syntagmatic whole. He followed the notion of Saussure in that language is a system of signs made up of two components - a sound-image or signifier with a con- cept or signified. However, Saussure states that the bond between the two components making up a linguistic sign is arbitrary. He states that any ob- ject whatsoever can become a sign, naturally or artificially, provided it is employed to communicate a message. Further, Saussure understood lan- guage as a system of relationships between comparable elements. Most important is the place that the signifying unit occupies in the linguistic system that determines its value. He notes, "Language is a form - not a substance." Lévi-Strauss directly applied these three notions to his study of mythic systems and cultural symbolism. First, he understood these myths as shar- ing a mode of thinking - la pensée sauvage - (untamed thinking) common to all humans. Second, each symbol (signifier) in a myth was open to a great variety of different interpretations, rather than a given one. Third, he established a systematic relationship among symbols that yield value. Lévi- Strauss did not attempt to decipher the symbols or to describe the symbolic code. Instead, he is more interested in demonstrating how natural and so- cial phenomena bring about intellectual stimulation and elaboration, which elements stand out for attention, and which kind of mental associations can thus be established for the social group. Contrary to classical thinking, Lévi-Strauss recognized that signifiers lead to other signifiers where language becomes meaningful, depending upon the point of view of the observer and what is of interest at that mo- ment in time. "A spoken language is a code which determines what mes- sages are available for (among other possible uses) circulation in the social network(s) to which speakers belong" (Sperber, 1979:23). When we shift Lévi-Strauss' structural process to a work of art, we grant the premise that the artwork is a mythic form derived from uncon- scious mental processes common to all cultures. These unconscious forces impose compatible structures upon an entire range of social or cultural</page><page sequence="4">122 The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self symbols, since myths represent the collective thought of the culture and what the culture has constructed about itself and its ways of experiencing life. Though some features of the artwork remain invisible to untrained observers, the elements in the art form gain meaning in their systematic relationship to the structure of the myth. Within this structure, the artist visualizes forms within the symbolic system. For Lévi-Strauss, myths are crucial attempts by humankind to un- derstand the contradictions between life and death, self and other, culture and nature, time and eternity, and so forth. In his analysis of the Oedipal myth, he pursues the argument "that myths do have a logic based upon binary oppositions" (Lévi-Strauss, cited in Adams, 1965:808-822). Roland Barthes is best known for his contribution to literary criti- cism, applying "structuralist" principles to mass media advertising and popu- lar culture. Barthes clearly outlines his structuralist philosophy in the intro- duction to his book, Elements of Semiology (1964), as follows: In his Course on General Linguistics , first published in 1916, Saussure postu- lated the existence of a general science of signs, or Semiology, of which linguis- tics would form only one part. Semiology therefore aims to take in any system of signs, whatever their substance and limits; images, gesture, musical sounds, ob- jects, and the complex associations of all these, which form the content of ritual, convention or public entertainment: these constitute, not languages , but systems of signification. There is no doubt that the development of mass communications confers particular relevance today upon the vast field of signifying media, just when the success of disciplines such as linguistics, information theory, formal logic and structural anthropology provide semantic analysis with new instru- ments. (Barthes, 1964: vii) Barthes 's approach is focused upon the mythology of everyday life in the context of an analysis of signs in media. He found a plethora of images in mass advertisement and popular literature. Barthes took the op- portunity to use the structuralist model to analyze "signifying systems" from avant-garde novels to a contemporary narrative film where every sign, whether a word, image, or political slogan, operates within a symbolic cul- tural system. Barthes calls his method translinguistics, in which the mean- ing is derived from the interplay of signs within the cultural discourse. Further, these structural relationships are determined by the hidden codes of the language system, confirming Jakobson's maxim: "there are no things, only relations between things." What Barthes does, then, is skillfully re- place the interpretative model of humanist psychology with his rendition of a structuralist sociology. Here, the intentions of the author are irrelevant</page><page sequence="5">The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self 123 since it is again the myth that produces the system of social signification. Thus, Barthes succeeds in calling our attention to the unconscious codes that structure our modern culture. In applying a structuralist approach to everyday myths, Barthes at- tempts to demystify the norms associated with the dominant ideology of capitalism. Barthes writes: "Society is a spectacle he can help to explain, by revealing to us some of the mechanisms by which it obscures its artifi- ciality" (Sturrock, 1979:61). The important function of myth is the form it takes through the message as a sign. Also, the use of conventional forms within a particular historical period helps structure the social reality of the myth into a specific social purpose. "Barthes shared to the full Bertolt Brechťs belief in the contemporary need for a drama which explained so- ciety to people and did not merely represent it" (61). Thus, Barthes defines mythology within the confines of mass media and its manipulation of cer- tain kinds of ideological discourses that govern the consciousness of our late modern society. No signifier, natural or otherwise, remains innocent of a surround- ing ideological connotation that gives the myth a double meaning, first, as an existing sign and second, as carrying hidden and covert messages that exist in the culture. Myths, for Barthes, are able to become "hidden persuaders," by a dialectical interplay of messages and images. The con- stant saturation of images through television commercials, narrative films on video, and documentary TV news programs displays the growing influ- ence the new media have on the perceptions of ourselves within this soci- ety. Because television is backed by corporate economic and political power, radical changes in the ways information and knowledge are communicated to viewers produce paradoxes and contradictions. While enhancing the view- er's range of information and knowledge, the new information technolo- gies, especially television, reduce the ability of the viewers to distinguish between fact and fiction, illusion and reality. The culture of television assumes certain mythic structures through the immediacy of "personalities, images and institutions of capitalism . . . the core elements of the mythic structure are a dynamic interplay of hu- mankind's need for a cultural story (habitus) and a vision (change)" (Sullivan, 1987:58). Barthes (1973) contends that mythic structures change historical events into natural or essential happenings. Thus, capitalism , as an economic system, entertains the mythos of "free-enterprise" or "private enterprise" while taking on features to describe a whole soceity based upon a universal-essentialist cultural ethos.</page><page sequence="6">124 The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self Jean Baudrillard: The Age of Hyper-Reality and Simulacra It is upon this stage in the new information age of media saturation that Jean Baudrillard comes into the spotlight. Baudrillard takes us one step further into the poststructuralist arguments of Louis Althusser based upon his re-readings of Karl Marx and historical materialism. Neo-Marx- ists argue that Marxism displaced two key propositions of modern philoso- phy, de-centering the notion of individual agency and the essence of Being of modernist thought. Althusser argued that social and economic relations in the modes of production and the exploitation of labor power and the circuits of capital displaced the notion of "man" at the center of modern philosophy. This anti-humanist track has found an ally in Jean Baudrillard who called his book The Mirror of Production (1975), based upon the post- modern condition and the ecstasy of communication. It follows the surreal fantasies of Barthes, Bataille, and Buñuel in which they allude to the postmodern moment as the simulacrum that conceals the truth of the "real;" it is a site where images and signs fashioned by an advanced techno-cul- ture stand for objects in themselves. Thus the age of hyper-reality is cre- ated; a dream-like state where memories of the past paralyze future thought or action. The science-fiction film narrative, Solaris, brings us into contact with this hyper-real situation and the power of the simulacra upon the cen- tral character. In an age of mass media simulation, an epoch of pervasive hyper- reality, Jean Baudrillard (1988) suggests it is impossible to distinguish be- tween truth and untruth, science and ideology. This state of being repre- sents what psychologists would define as the schizoid temperament - a split personality. The method and way of life is introspection. For a human be- ing to understand himself or herself requires an analysis of all the contra- dictory elements that go into the formation of an individual's personality. The media or culture industry have created an excess of high-tech con- sumer machines that can visually reproduce electronically any documen- tary or filmed narrative that subjectifies our emotions and experiences. These video and film images interpenetrate our daily lives with their virtual reali- ties. In this manner these media machines inhabit our consciousness and colonize our imaginations and desires (McCaffery, 1991:5). An example of the cultural schizophrenia overwhelming many Ger- man survivors after the end of the war in 1945 is presented in the Wim Wenders' film, Kings of the Road (1976). The central character is the postmodern hero, an unadaptable man, a wanderer and dreamer trapped in</page><page sequence="7">The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self 125 an illusion of reality. The history of the past is created for him by American motion pictures. As he discovers this past "history" of Germany through cinematic representations, before and after the rise of Hitler, he comes to the realization that the "Yankees have colonized my subconscious." The amnesia that afflicts this man is visually depicted as a constant disruption between the social and political conditions in West Germany and the filmic representations of past lives. Here there is a denial of his identity, causing a restlessness in which the man is continually forced to live in a threatened state of anxiety. Jean Baudrillard (1983a) suggests that the Western world has al- ready reached the saturation point of information through media exploita- tion. He states that the "mirror of production" has replaced human interac- tion with "reality," diminishing our contact and understanding of the com- plexity of reality. In this present state of simulacrum, Baudrillard fears that the "map engenders the territory" and everything is a digitalized, generational copy of everything else. We find "a proliferation of myths of origin and signs of reality; of second-hand truth, objectivity, authenticity ... a panic-stricken production of the real and the referential, above and parallel to the panic of material production" (12-13). This is the space of the hyper-real. It breaks down the interconnectedness of human beings with their own perceptions of themselves, creating a "political unconscious" (Jameson, 1982) that raises the individual to the collective level where nar- rative discourses operate to repress "revolution." Knowledge and informa- tion now "function as a form of social control in diverse communication contexts" and images of identity conceal the discourses of a late capitalist, postmodern world of endless production and consumption. Critical Adult Education and Film Narratives What an adult viewer or spectator realizes about myth making is that it is an integral part of identity formation. Further, any liberation of human beings from this "historical" context requires a critical educational reflec- tion, helping the adult learner transfer and re-organize the past to allow the learner to re-function according to the needs and desires of his/her own existence. A contextualist film critique can situate such film narratives within an existing social-political conflict that is not just a model of the mono- lithic dominating ideology. A critical adult education or pedagogy poses questions as to the so-</page><page sequence="8">126 The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self cial and cultural benefits of images presented through the new electronic media. In wanting to be informed and educated by such media, adult edu- cators need to broaden their scope and critically appraise the widespread social-political narratives whose power structures determine the institu- tional design and shape of the messages before we lose the capacity to produce knowledge for ourselves in different communities of understand- ing. In a critical definition of adult education, Brookfield (1985) states that "through a spirit of critical reflection . . . adult participants are prompted to consider the ways of thinking and living alternative to those they already inhabit" (48). For this reason, a literary and cultural analysis of high-tech commu- nication through a multi-perspective theory of film narrative or storytelling can help address the problems created by a postmodern informational soci- ety. When considered by adult educators in classroom situations, the con- cept of narrative operates on two levels: as a communication phenomenon that culturally constructs human identities and role-playing and as a social phenomenon that reinforces or challenges the social order (Mumby, 1 993 :2). The reading of film narratives also requires an analysis of the issues of gender, race, and class that are ideologically formed through images, genre codes, and myths in popular culture. Simulacra in Tarkovsky's Solaris (1972) - Illusion/Reality The science-fiction genre consists of a range of film narratives where contemporary myths are created or "dreamed up" to provide us with imagi- nary representations of ourselves and our identity in a future world. "Real- ity" and "experience" undergo imagistic transformations in these film nar- ratives. As systems of discourse, these narratives reproduce and replicate us in the hidden social and political constructions of power, as technology and culture conflate into Utopian schemes. As hi-tech cultural myths, they become unseen hegemonic forces of late capitalism that control and privi- lege one set of vested interests against other competing forces. Some sci- ence-fiction film narratives attempt to challenge and contradict these exist- ing myths of cultural power. Other voices struggle for equal representation and distribution within the new cultural phenomenon. Thus, what has come to be called the postmodern condition becomes one in which an imaginary science-fiction scenario indicates an erosion of confidence in the Modern- ist dream of a coming utopia. The erosion of confidence in these scenarios</page><page sequence="9">The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self 127 are usually symptomatic of the malaise of the Modernist project. In Solaris, the opening sequences deal with problems confronting scientists on a space station where a scientific-dominated Communist soci- ety is characterized by two major features: "the transformation of reality into images" through a network of televised media images and the simulta- neous "fragmentation of time into a series of perpetual presents" (Jameson, quoted in Kaplan, 1988:28). Briefly, the film concerns a group of scientists aboard a Soviet space station orbiting the planet Solaris. After a number of strange encounters with an alien intelligence, namely, the Solaris Ocean, Kris Kelvin, a psy- chologist, is sent by the state to investigate the situation, possibly to halt the experiments. The opening scenes establish the basic antagonistic battle between the objective, scientific viewpoints of Kelvin and those of André Berton, a helicopter pilot who reported a surrealistic sighting, possibly an apparition, he witnessed on Solaris. Even though this is an opening stere- otypical for the science-fiction genre, Tarkovsky carefully minimizes the plot and maximizes the emotional forces at play within this narrative, al- lowing the external spectator to interact with these mysterious forces just as they are experienced by the three scientists living inside the space sta- tion. Tarkovsky uses a series of moving or floating camera shots through- out the film that track and pan in long takes, creating a surreal, dream-like cinematic experience. Tarkovsky's earlier epic film, Andrei Roublev (1967), is a story of an icon painter who believes that "all great art is at the service of some- thing beyond itself and does not assert itself, it serves another, higher and communal idea" (Tarkovsky, 1996:38). The emphasis is similar in Solaris where again three men, isolated in the small space station, are confronted with an enigma about making contact with an intelligent alien life form. When comparing Solaris with his other films, Tarkovsky's adaptation of Stanislaw Lem's novel clearly indicates that "he was attracted by the nov- el's moral implications and psychological insights rather than its fantastic events" (Johnson and Petrie, 1994: 100), since the central protagonist, Kris Kelvin, has the opportunity to relive a troubled past in order to start a new beginning. The contact with others in isolation is another feature of this science-fiction story that served Tarkovsky's spiritual aspirations within the genre. Yet the moral transformation of the hero, Kelvin, alters the meaning behind Lem's adoption of a Nietzschean philosophy toward encounters of this kind. While Lem's thoughts focus in the novel upon the limits of hu-</page><page sequence="10">128 The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self man knowledge, he is able to critique anthropomorphic thinking. The love story in the novel is desperate, but as it develops it helps explain what Kelvin faces when he attempts to "do all he can to stay human in an inhu- man situation. Noble it may be, but it isn't going to get you anywhere" (Lem, 1970:151). Lem simply strips Kelvin of belief in "final solutions." What Lem gives us in this parable is the difficult realization that, in the age of relativity and post-cybernetic sciences, there is no closed reference sys- tem to depend upon. By sending a psychologist into this new science-fic- tion space world, Lem can demonstrate that human sciences are polyva- lent, and their methodologies can lead us into vast unfathomed areas of new findings, techniques, and orientations - to a new cognition, which will give humankind new sets of contingencies to choose from. As Nietzsche understood at the beginning of the twentieth century, modern sciences are open ended and so is the possibility of witnessing other "cruel miracles" still to come. In contrast to the thematics of the novel, Tarkovsky's film version takes the science-fiction world and turns it into a vehicle to display a hu- manistic statement of values, focused through the power of love in an inhu- man environment. Working on the binary split between science and hu- manity, Tarkovsky emphasizes the family as the center of human endeavor. When we first meet Kelvin, we recognize his detached and isolated air. Even when he is being reproached by his father, after quickly dispatching the older Berton and his hallucinatory story about Solaris, we see his di- lemma in the film as one of separating his scientific and objective side in favor of a humanistic one within a set of moral consequences. Hari, his resurrected wife, becomes the symbol of sacrifice through love that per- vades most of Tarkovsky 's films. Lem's advanced thoughts on a postmodern world are truly irreconcilable with the film adaptation by Tarkovsky. In fact, the space library is dressed with art objects and paintings depicting the rhythms of nature and establishing a human presence in the midst of futuristic exploration and scientific experimentation. This setting visually dramatizes how far Tarkovsky moves away from the morally absurd situation found in the novel. The director clearly estab- lishes the central learning space as an attempt to continue a dialogue with the past and with the humanistic ideal that man needs man. The theatrical props Tarkovsky features are Cervantes' Don Quixote, Brueghel's painting Return of the Hunters, and the choral music of Bach's Fugue in F minor. The sense of naturalism presented by the cinematic images is not altered throughout the film but Tarkovsky tampers with the appearance of</page><page sequence="11">The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self 1 29 objects by changing camera movements to capture the dream-like quality of each image. All the characters in the film then become part of the dream as presented in the space sequences. Because the dream appears to be real, we appear to enter the space of hyper-reality, for the mystery of how it happens creates tension in our rational mind. The constant shifts from hyper- reality or dream state to reality are also achieved by altering the time- space continuum in which the characters function. In the opening sequences of the film, we experience a detailed visual presentation of a summer landscape featuring a lake, marsh, and home where the first action occurs. The continuous movement of the camera, in rhythm with the action of the characters in the frame, captures the sense of real time and space. Instead of using montage editing to focus the attention of the viewer, Tarkovsky emphasizes the temporal nature of reality, making the filmic image look real but at the same time giving this image the quali- ties of the poetic or imaginary. Tarkovsky has claimed that the notion of time is the most important function of cinema, since film can conserve time forever. Thus, by keep- ing the literal sense of time within the cinematic image, Tarkovsky can quietly evoke strong emotional responses as well as contemplation in the viewer. Viewers are encouraged to search for something more than the image as a representation of reality and to reflect upon what they perceive on the screen. The cinematic images created by Tarkovsky allow them to become involved in the meanings hidden beneath the narrative level. The realism of this kind of surreal cinema defies the orthodox con- cept of narrative cinema as a linear unfolding of representational events that reach a diegetic conclusion. On the contrary, Solaris begins with a sense of place and of the reality of our physical world but this is replaced by video images on a screen that present many features associated with the notion of the surreal. For Tarkovsky, the evocation of a surreal world in his film allows him to explore the true function of the mind or thought. Ac- cording to André Breton, founder and guru of the French Surrealists in the 1920s, surrealist images are released as dream images by the artist in the absence of all control exerted by reason or consciousness of moral preoc- cupations. These images are created by the irrational forces of fear and desire. It is certainly not a coincidence that Lem, the novelist, brings back the past through Andre Berton, a play on the name Breton. The video imagery displays a surrealistic sea that Berton describes as the Solaris Ocean. It is assumed to function as a gigantic brain capable of thought. It is used by Tarkovsky as an analog to parts of the human brain</page><page sequence="12">130 The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self where it functions intuitively and irrationally outside of logic and control. However, the radiation from the Solaris Ocean has adversely affected the men on the station and that is of great concern. We also learn that three men are left on the space station hovering over Solaris - the astrobiologist, Sartorius; the cyberneticist, Snouth (Snow), and the psychologist, Gibarían, who talked about making contact with the Ocean. As viewers, we are introduced to the Solaris at the opening scenes of the film. When Kelvin speaks to Berton after the video presentation, we learn that Kelvin is not impressed by Berton's report. Moreover, he is in- sensitive to Berton's argument that you don't destroy what you don't under- stand. Kelvin takes the scientific position that he cannot be swayed by emotions. Kelvin's father is enraged that his son has driven Berton off and protests that Kelvin has not understood the fragile nature of the situation. This argument allows the viewer to ponder what will happen to Kelvin when he arrives at the space station. It sets off the next dream sequence illustrated by the alternation of lights and darks when Berton's cab enters a tunnel in his ride back to the city. The cab ride, with its attendant flicker effect, is carried out in silence and repeated several times. We see Berton's son appear out of the darkness in the back seat as he places his head next to his father. The cab, like a space vehicle, plunges both the viewer and the cab's occupants into a dark, mysterious, unexplainable, and absurd universe. As a cinematic effect, Tarkovsky is able to create a virtual reality of traveling through space/time during this extended sequence. For the viewer, it is a prelude to the mystery of space travel and the displacement of human beings trying to make con- tact with an unknown intelligence in an alien environment. Evening in the city becomes a montage of lights moving along vari- ous highways. Then Tarkovsky brings us back to the house where the film began and the shift in tonality and color again places the cinematic images into a dream-like black and white environment. The symbolic image of death is presented by a horse that enters the space. A dark, star-filled sky brings us to the lift-off. The close-up of Kelvin's eyes as he goes into space is similar to the dream process of losing one's balance and falling into a trance. The unexpected changes from black and white imagery to color force us, as viewers, to continually make associative links between what we consider as illusion or simulacra and what we will contemplate as a true representation of the world. Tarkovsky continues this cinematic strategy of moving from dream to reality throughout the film, as if to emphasize the ambiguity between the</page><page sequence="13">The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self 131 spiritual and the material. Once Kelvin lands on Solaris, he continues this strategy when he locates Gibarian's cabin. Inside, he finds a note instruct- ing him to play back Gibarian's video tape of his last hours. Tarkovsky contrasts the colors in the room with the large black and white images on the screen. The sinister room is introduced by a child's drawing of a man with a rope around his neck and then a picture of a wild horse on the wall as the camera completes its pan of the wreckage. Gibarian's message is cryptic and he does not mention the presence of "guests." Yet he wants Kelvin to know right from the start that he is not insane. He warns Kelvin that if the same thing happens to him, Kelvin must realize instantly that these "guests" or phantoms are material and not hallucinations, and furthermore, that he has not gone mad. Then, to add more mystery to the situation, Tarkovsky allows the camera to follow Kelvin as he peers through the black porthole into the ominous, ill-boding, and mysterious Solarían Ocean beneath the space station. The radiant appearance of his dead wife, Hari, after he wakes up in his room, forces Kelvin to believe what Gibarían told him. Yet Kelvin quickly decides to destroy this guest, as he is gripped by fear, and he does so, sending her off in a rocket. But Snouth knows she will re-appear later on, and she does. Kelvin then realizes that his thoughts about Hari must have caused her materialization.The disturbing deaths and reappearances of Hari bring this film into tragic focus. Tarkovsky's spiritual quest for meaning in human affairs rests upon her sacrifice. By bringing into play the power of dreams, images, and the unconscious mind, Tarkovsky's con- ception of cinema manifests itself, one which can generate a sudden mo- ment of revelation for the viewer as well as for Kelvin, the central charac- ter. This intuitive grasp of the human condition, like an epiphany, occurs when we witness the closing of the film, where the filmmaker attempts to resolve the oppositions and ambiguities between dream states and realities created by images upon human perception. While Solaris outwardly appears to be a film narrative interested in the scientific investigation of strange events on a space station, Tarkovsky's film takes the viewer into this strange, alien environment as a means to expose the subjective feelings of his characters. This allegorical journey, then, is a psychic exploration of the subconscious desires and thoughts of a human being literally facing an "unknown sea" without the support of logic or reason. Tarkovsky demonstrates how the material world dissolves into the psychic world of dreams and memories. Once here, we come into con-</page><page sequence="14">132 The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self tact with the materialized projections of the human mind. They are called "phantoms" by Freud - the dark, mysterious intruders emanating from the unconscious dream world. When the three men and Hari convene in the library to celebrate Snouth's birthday, Snouth's late arrival turns into a drunken attack on the activities of scientists in the space station. Berating Sartorius, Snouth ar- gues that "we don't want to conquer space. We [humans] want to expand endlessly. We don't want other worlds, we want a mirror. We are in a posi- tion of a man striving for a goal he fears and doesn't even want. We are turning a science project into a bedroom farce." When Sartorius leaves after this verbal assault, the birthday party is all but over for the drunken Snouth. Yet, for the viewer, it takes a curious turn since the viewer knows that weightlessness will soon occur on the ship. At the moment of weightlessness, candles magically rise in the air and float next to the lovers (Kris and Hari) as Bach's choral fugue is heard, underscoring their re-union. The following montage becomes a series of disconnected dream images summarizing the associational ideas Tarkovsky has selected for his film. Like his hero, Kris Kelvin, Tarkovsky cannot disengage himself from his Russian Orthodox past. Like a nostalgic Don Quixote, he is a man chasing unreachable dreams though the winter land- scapes of Brueghel, the remembrance of the warmth of a fire in childhood and the embraces of father and mother at home. These visuals are con- trasted with the mysterious forces of nature and the Solarían Ocean as the origin of intelligence. Themes of flight and escape associated with dream imagery become a repetitive motif in all Tarkovsky's films. The religious dimensions in Solaris require further exploration as Tarkovsky seeks to understand the subliminal experience of the uncon- scious dream world. In each Tarkovsky film, the dream content mirrors the central character's confused state of mind, his desire to escape from some- thing oppressive into something that offers a "spiritual revelation" and free- dom. While this quest for some kind of revelation permeates the film, Lem's novel is philosophical enough to realize the weaknesses in any argument that assesses everything in terms of human values in an inhuman situation. This major theme ends the novel. Through the contact with the Solarían Ocean, Kelvin is given a chance to revisit his moral and personal traumas, including a troubled Oedipal ordeal with his wife, Hari, who is resurrected as a simulacrum or "double" (or "guest" in Lem's terms). Kelvin finally understands how the Ocean resurrected his past according to the desires</page><page sequence="15">The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self 133 and wishes he consciously or unconsciously encoded in the encephalo- graph. Thus, for the men on the Solaris station, the Ocean responded ac- cordingly to each one's own personality and perhaps sense of guilt. Gibrarian, Kris' mentor, commits suicide in order to avoid becoming in- sane. Sartorius maintains privacy at all costs, and Snouth attempts to find ways to restrain the "guests" in order to maintain his own sanity. In the novel, Kris Kelvin realizes that love and personal beliefs are necessary for a scientist to maintain his mental balance but he also learns, after the disappearance of Hari, something else, which he relates to Snouth in a confession: "I will not give myself completely to them, as I shall never again give myself completely to anything or anybody" (Lem, 1970:196). In realizing his dilemma, Kelvin's open-ended decision to pause from any final commitment brings forth his "shattering of eschatological illusions" that human beings in the past relied upon. For Lem, the existence of a universe unresponsive to human suffering signifies that human values and their moral underpinnings are just part of an imaginative construct of a humane universe. Whatever affirming life-force the Ocean on Solaris represents, Lem argues that it is not a god because it repeats itself. Kelvin now believes it is feasible to imagine believing it is an evolving god, an imperfect god, "a god whose passion is not redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no pur- pose - a god who simply is" (1970:199). On the other hand, Tarkovsky's film adaptation of Lem's novel imprints his quest to present the science/ humanist dichotomy. Solaris, as a science-fiction film, has been compared to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and this comparison is obvious when you talk about space technology and the race between the Soviets and the Americans during the Cold War. Yet Tarkovsky's themes are much broader in terms of the moral and metaphysical crises facing scientists and "modern man" at the dawning of the Space Age. Tarkovsky wants to re- establish the importance of life-affirming human values through the love story of Kris and Hari in a universe that is indifferent or hostile. Tarkovsky presents the scientific world as narrowly focused upon the pursuit of mate- rialistic goals. He also questions these scientific goals since they forget to observe the damage they have caused the modern world, especially when scientific objectivism and logic alienates human beings from any recogni- tion of the spiritual dimensions of the human condition.</page><page sequence="16">1 34 The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self Critical Reflection on Film Narratives as Life Histories Critical reflection upon life histories by adult learners have led edu- cators (such as Mezirow, 1991, Brookfield, et al., 1985) to advance the idea that such reflections can reveal subjective learning experiences that become a relevant context for research into adult education (Dominice, 1990: 194). As an educational biography, Solaris presents the viewer with a life history that functions on the reflections of the central protagonist. In viewing this film narrative, we witness the re-construction of the past as a scientist moves into the challenges of future space exploration. Kris Kelvin, as a psychologist, travels to the planet Solaris concerned with testing out a psychometric model related to the strange happenings that have been reported to Earth scientists. His mission is to evaluate the rel- evance of the "sightings" of Berton, and to report on other strange events. Once aboard the space station, his mission is interrupted by his own con- tact with a person from his past. This intervention by a "guest" allows Kel- vin to become an explorer of his own psychic experiences, which occurs as he reflects upon his past personal traumas with his wife who has reap- peared as a simulacrum." As a scientist he knows this is not possible, for Hari is dead. This new "Hari" is not Hari; she is a manifestation of a pro- jection from Kelvin's mind. The visual materialization of this woman brings about a reconsid- eration by Kelvin of the emotional/affective aspects from his personal past. The imagined resurrection of his wife at the space station is the trigger that allows Kelvin to reflect critically about the personal "meanings perspec- tives" he has constructed about himself and his own family over time. Tarkovsky's interpretation of Solaris can be analyzed as a psycho- logical probe into the ways reflective thinking in adult education reaches beyond the borders of empirico-analytical models. "Reflection-in-action" is the phrase developed by Donald Schon (1983) to study the methods adopted by professional practitioners when they come upon life situations that are unique, ambiguous, unstable, and far from certain. Solaris introduces the viewer to the way the director structures his film about a person facing such a life situation where previous knowledge and beliefs are challenged. "Scientific" or "technical" rationality appears to be non-operative for the central protagonist, Kris Kelvin. New intuitive approaches are thus employed reflectively to gain knowledge and compre- hension of the new situation that confronts him. By bringing into play rei-</page><page sequence="17">The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self 135 evant theories-of-action, he accidentally has the opportunity to examine his past self as object. While it is similar to other therapeutic approaches used by adult educators, the life history approach to adult education "helps adults become more aware of and more responsible for their own learning processes" (Schon, 1983:196). The theories-in-action provide the protago- nist with the interpretive tools to probe, metaphorically, the new situation in search of an explanation, based upon feedback from the persons he en- counters in reflective thought. Solaris is a simple experiment in narrative to demonstrate how sci- entists continue a scientific research program when their personal lives are being directly influenced by unknown forces at play. Kelvin focuses upon his own life history when the simulacrum of Hari, his dead wife, suddenly surfaces in his room at the station. She has no "history"; yet her mind is capable of reading Kelvin's thoughts, and by this process she begins to reconstruct her own identity as Kelvin's wife. The process of reconstruction of his past life is aided by photographs and a home movie (video) that introduces not only Hari as his wife, but also earlier episodes of Kelvin's life at home with his parents. As this past life is introduced to the viewer, we learn, with the new Hari, about the lifestyle, and the environment of home which became meaningful to Kel- vin. At first, Kelvin believes the reappearance of Hari is but a dream; she is just a hallucination. But his other colleagues at the station, Sartorius and Snouth, are also contending with their own "guests" at the same time. Kel- vin is given advice from his former mentor to remember that whatever is happening to him, he has not gone mad! The startling appearance of a life-sized replicant who looks to be more real than her former self allows Kelvin to frame his problem of guilt over the original death of Hari before his space mission. Now we can read- ily understand the whole narrative as a parable, allegorically structured to bring a man back to his former life when at the start he appears to be cold and lifeless, a person lost in his own traumatic existence. The film demon- strates the strategies he first employs to deal with this problem, the growth of his own intimacies with his "guest," and the regard for his own identity based upon the way he frames his role with the other scientists. Kelvin goes through different stages of awareness as the film progresses, but the plot is not as important as the qualities of humanity that begin to return to him. Tarkovsky uses the group meeting at the library to explore the process of critical self-reflection. The debate clarifies what each scientist understands about the world of Solaris they now inhabit, and ex-</page><page sequence="18">136 The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self plores the belief and value systems held by each person. Hari, as a "guest," states that "we emerge from your memory or your imagination - we are only an instrument to study your reactions" (Lem, 1970:51). When chal- lenged by Gibarían that she is just a replicant, a copy, a double, Hari re- sponds, saying, "I'm becoming human." The "real" experiences for Kelvin on Solaris climax with the sudden disappearance of the "guests" from the space station after a second electric encephalograph had been radiated into the Ocean. Like a dream suddenly broken, Kelvin re-appears in front of his house on Earth. He has returned home having experienced a view of himself that he could not have imag- ined. Or was the life history just a play of his imagination? The real world, and his reflection-in-action on his personal traumas, appear to leave Kelvin with a new attitude and perspective toward humankind, and especially to- ward the "cruel miracles" of life. This re-formed Kelvin is apparently chas- tened, for he falls to his knees in front of his father, a re-enactment of the prodigal son's return. As viewers, we can also reflect upon the outcome of this film narra- tive. Has Kelvin returned a more knowledgeable person who can now deal with life and death situations of loved ones? Does he now understand his own responsibility to his family and to his social identity as a scientist? Do we, as an audience, gain some understanding of ourselves and the chang- ing world we live in? Do we, as Lem suggests, enter a cybernetic world in order to realize there is no Utopia - no ideal closed reference system? In the context of adult learning, Kelvin appears to have resolved his own in- ner struggle for a more autonomous life, freeing himself from other peo- ple's expectations yet remaining culturally bound to the beliefs and values of his family. From his first arrival on Solaris, the scene of disarray and death that faced him challenged his own abilities and knowledge to deal with this critical life-threatening situation. Only when we see Kelvin's own values and beliefs surface do we understand that such validity testing helps assure us that he does realize his own identity. It is through the opportunity to re-examine his own attitudes, and the ability to locate his own space, that he recognizes the second chance he has been given. His reflection-in-action has not only challenged his val- ues but enriched what he already knew. We do not know the next chapter of his life, but, what we learn as viewers from this film narrative indicates the ways adult learners can find their own identities through the recognition of "otherness." Kelvin seems to have gained a new set of contingencies to choose</page><page sequence="19">The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self 137 from, as he has learned that science cannot dismiss the traditional life of his father or its cultural foundation. It is from this base that an adult learner or practitioner builds new life experiences within social expectations. The mysteries of life are still present, but the human capacity for love and mean- ingful life-affirming experiences appear ever present in our world. Critical reflection through life histories facilitates adult learning be- cause the adult learner becomes more conscious that all learning is neces- sarily dependent upon contact and exchange with others in the context of the human condition. Once aligned with this "reflection-in-action" the how, what, and why a person learns is given personal recognition. Tarkovsky's film recognizes the old adage that "the true responsibility of humankind is to be human." On those occasions, when we make contact with people who appear as "strangers" from ourselves, are the moments that we must recog- nize their differences and learn how to live with them. Implications for Adult Education Film narratives, in general, are social-political artifacts that incorpo- rate important social and political issues through the use of various dis- courses, rhetoric, and ideologies in different genres. A critical reflection on such film narratives, as part of an adult education, can provide an adult learner with the opportunity to discern the social-political positions adopted by an authorial voice. Further, an adult learner will be able to experience a life history and understand how the construction of the film's diegesis uses images to encode relations of power and domination. Because such narra- tives incorporate certain political intentions, it is important for adult learn- ers to analyze, interpret, and critically reflect upon their ideological mes- sages and effects, especially as they reach the viewer both emotionally and intellectually. A coherent reading of film narratives also requires an analy- sis of the issues of gender, race, and class that are rhetorically formed through images, genre codes, and myths in popular culture. Any serious merger of films and videos with traditional educational practices and techniques raises a number of pedagogical questions. How are critical skills developed by adult learners through the exposure to the cultural texts of film narratives? How can adult learners become critically aware of the ways film narratives mediate and transform "reality"? In what ways may instructors use film narratives to support or challenge the domi- nant ideology of the narrative? How do critical theory and critical analysis</page><page sequence="20">138 The Fantastic Discourse: Mythic Images of Self fit into the learning strategies for adults? Should film narratives encourage a subversive element in adult education? Would certain film narratives en- courage better learning skills in different adult vocational training programs? In my view, science-fiction myths such as Solaris contain powerful messages concerning the "construction of a social reality " in relationship to unknown scientific discoveries within a film narrative. They reflect is- sues on distinct social-political beliefs and values that interpret and organ- ize life experiences. In myriad ways they impose perspectives and identi- ties on a diverse group of people. Also, film narratives are now emerging as part of an overall information/entertainment system in postmodern life, and in some ways are surpassing other pedagogical practices. They are, in fact, displacing other learning processes by a dramatization of "lived expe- riences" using film images and sound to get their message across. In their re-interpretations of contemporary social and political issues, different "spins" or "perspectives" are used to persuade and indoctrinate the viewer. Again, film narratives can also activate a reflective thinking proc- ess, providing all adult learners the experience of remembering, re-posi- tioning, re-locating, re-exploring, re-examining, and re-constituting their own biases and value judgments from their own personal perspectives. Film experiences can also challenge or confirm a person's relationship with "oth- ers," through the evocation of memories and past histories. It is through the experience of the dramatic event, where emotion and argument are blended into a desire of the viewer to look into him/herself more clearly, that a person's thinking and imagining may undergo a transformation of the val- ues and beliefs we share (Brook, 1968:123).
