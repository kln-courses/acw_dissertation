<plain_text><page sequence="1">208 REVIEWS The The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background Background and the Ugaritic Texts. By Mark S. Smith. Pp. xviii + 325. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. isbn ο ig 513480 X. Hardback £46; paper £16.99. The title of this book (if read apart from the subtitle) is in some danger of promising more than it gives: it is not a chronological or reasoned account of how monotheism arose in ancient Israel. Perhaps this is because Professor Smith already provided such an account in a previous book, The Early History of God (1990: see especially ch. 6, 'The Origins and Development of Israelite Monotheism'). It is, in any case, a valuable book about two important and difficult subjects, namely the nature of Canaanite religion, or rather theology, and of Israelite theologies which either emerged from it or at least defined themselves, in their classical form, by their relationship to it. The substantial introduction alone is a notable achievement of reflection upon the questions of method which such a study raises. The first six main chapters are concerned with the deities of ancient Ugaritic mythology, which is seen with good reason as the best evidence we have for the religion of Canaan in the early Old Testament period. Smith also makes use of Phoenician evidence, but not as much as he could of archaeological evidence from Palestine itself. His concern here is not so much with the plots of the myths and what they may mean as with two topics that are less often treated, 'The Structures of Divinity' and 'Characteristics of Divinity'. On the former he first underlines the distinction between 'central' and 'peripheral' deities: on the one hand generally benevolent deities, who are the recipients of cultic worship and represented by images of domestic animals, and on the other monstrous divine powers (like Mot, the god of death), who threaten mankind from the outside and are represented as hostile creatures like snakes and dragons. Even the latter bear titles which indicate favour from El, the chief god of the pantheon, or subservience to him. Two chapters then consider what makes the central deities into more of a unity than at first appears to be the case and thus constitutes a step on the way to monotheism. Smith begins with the widely accepted notion of the divine council (it is based on specific Ugaritic terms), distinguishing four tiers or ranks in its hierarchy and also the existence of multiple such groupings in the myths. But (following J. D. Schloen's Harvard dissertation) he finds the idea of a 'divine 5 The Author 2008 Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The section on structures is rounded off by a consideration of various lesser groupings of deities, including an important section on the cult of dead ancestors of the royal family. The two chapters on 'characteristics' combine the general with the specific. The first is an overdue discussion (prompted, Smith says, by a question put to him by V. Hurowitz) of 'What is a god?' Smith examines four traits which are widespread but also problematic: strength and size, anthropomorphism, holiness, and immortality ('immorality' on pp. 83 and 243 is presumably a misprint for this!). This is followed by a detailed examination of the category of dying and rising gods, in relation to the main Near Eastern candidates for such a description, and especially Baal. Smith shares the doubts of others about the coherence of this category: in the case of Baal, as with some others, he finds an important link with politically motivated rituals for the royal dead. Throughout the first section of the book Smith appends useful comparisons with the Old Testament to his discussion of the Ugaritic evidence. His treatment of the four 'traits' of divinity also provides some good material for assessing the implications of the designation of Yahweh as a god (el or '6lohim),'6lohirn), which is arguably much more significant for Old Testament theology than is generally recognized. The four chapters on the Old Testament deal with the relation ship of Yahweh to El, the nature and context of monotheistic statements in Israel, the theologies of Genesis 1, Proverbs 8, and Daniel 7 (disappointingly briefly) and the 'monotheistic rhetoric' of Deutero-Isaiah. Here especially Smith's argument needs to be filled out from his earlier book: the absence of fuller discussion of the Psalms and the wisdom literature is also unfortunate. But what is there is worked out with Smith's characteristic combi nation of learning (the endnotes run to over a hundred pages), adventure, and caution. At two points some reconsideration may be needed. The chapter on Yahweh and El makes an impressive case for the identification of Yahweh with El in early (and even later: cf. the book of Job) Israel. But it is too readily assumed that the Hebrew word 'el is a proper name in biblical texts. Even outside the Bible it is often a common noun. The process by which 'el'el became a title for Yahweh ('God') may have been more complex than a simple equation with the Canaanite deity. This has a bearing on the interpretation of what at first sight seems strong evidence for Smith's view that 'early biblical tradition preserves an association of the Exodus primarily with El and not with</page><page sequence="3">210 REVIEWS Yahweh' (p. 147). The Balaam oracles in Numbers 23—4 do use 'el'el eight times, twice with reference to the Exodus (23:22; 24:8), and the divine name Yahweh only three times (23:8, 21; 24:6). But is 'el 'the name of ΕΓ here, as Smith holds? Even if it is, the name Yahweh closely precedes both references to the Exodus, so that the texts scarcely distinguish him from 'el in the way suggested. More account also needs to be taken of the fact that these oracles are placed in the mouth of a non-Israelite, Aramaean seer, and of the contrary evidence of the poems in Exodus 15, where the deliverance at the sea is uniformly attributed to Yahweh. Secondly, the use of the expression 'monotheistic rhetoric' in relation to Deutero-Isaiah is not entirely clear. Nobody would deny that the prophet employs a vivid rhetorical style throughout or that monotheistic passages like Isa. 45:20—1 were designed to help persuade his hearers that his message of coming deliverance was true. But Smith seems to go further than this when he says that 'monotheism is not a separate "stage" of religion in ancient Israel', but 'a kind of ancient rhetoric reinforcing Israel's exclusive relationship with its deity (p. 9; cf. pp. 154-5, !80-93)'. The issues are too complex to resolve in a review, but surely there is more to Deutero-Isaiah's thinking than this? As Smith recognizes elsewhere, it was vital in the situation of the Babylonian exile to engage explicitly with an issue that only gradually became pressing in the late pre-exilic period: were the deities whom the Assyrians and Babylonians regarded as the source of their power real deities or not? To this question Deutero-Isaiah delivered an unequivocal 'No': only Yahweh was a true god/God. Smith's formulation cited above seems not to do justice to that. doi:doi: 10.1093/jts/flml 74doi:10.1093/jts/flml74 Advance Access publication 13 February 2008 Graham Davies University University of Cambridge gid10@cus.cam.ac.uk</page></plain_text>
