<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE APPETITES OF GRAVITY CONTEMPORARY IRISH POETRY SEAMUS DEANE Reading these five books, I am reminded of what R. P. Blackmur wrote in 1948: "Almost the whole job of culture has been dumped on the artist's hands." In Ireland, where this is particularly true, most writers have become wearied by the attritional quality of their re lationship to their society and its history. Given the example of W. B. Yeats, the political and economic depression, the society's fixed loyal Seamus Heaney, Wintering Out. New York: Oxford University Press, 1973. 80 pages. $4; Seamus Heaney, North.

It was as though every poet was compeUed by circumstances to see himself as a major poet if he was to become a poet at aU. This stress on creativity had to be damaging. Much Irish poetry after Yeats would have been more memorable if it could have settled for being less ambitious. This, I think, is at least part of the truth about Denis Devlin, Brian Coffey, and Austin Clarke. Thomas KinseUa inherited the disappointments of that era and subsumed them in his early work into a long contemplative exercise on the problem of evil. The climax to this phase of his work came with the pubUcation in 1968 of Nightwalker and Other Poems. Since then, up to the pubUcation of the present volume and the more re cent One (Dublin, 1974), the mood of Mr. KinseUa's poetry has sharpened into a surgical exploration by the imagination of the re sources of the wiU?above aU, of the basic wiU to go on, to survive, to remain aware. Mr. KinseUa has consistently grown away from his early highly-cadenced verse toward a poetry which is at times rhyth micaUy cumbersome, lacking the finish and completeness which Clarke, for instance, managed so weU. Mr. KinseUa, it might be said, prefers to write poetry rather than to make poems. He seeks precision but not at the cost of becoming a miniaturist. So he has increasingly turned from the formaUties of lyric verse toward larger, more sculp tural effects. This does not exclude subtlety or deUcacy of feeling. The deUcacy, rather than having the appearance (as it did in his earUer work) of being elegantly attenuated, Uves in a more somber and more misceUaneous world, as a vein exists in a block of marble. The gravity of mood which characterized the earUer work has now itself become the object of the poet's scrutiny. We are faced with a genetic account of a consciousness coming to maturity, taking pos session of recalcitrant experiences, learning to resist the resistance of the outer world. The levels at which a KinseUa poem moves can switch and fracture dramatically. His continuous fascination with growth as a biological as weU as an emotional process can create unexpected friction in the language of his verse. We meet this quickly in the first section of Notes from the Land of the Dead in phrases like "Dark nutrient waves" or "red protein eyes" or in a description of a beetle "clasping with smaU tarsi/a baU of dung bigger than its body." "Nutrient," "protein," and "tarsi" are the crucial imports from the language of natural history into the otherwise conventional phrasings. "Dark waves" is harmless, but the intervening epithet lends to it a sharper, more diagnostic quaUty. We see through the surface of the thing to</page><page sequence="3">ARTS AND LETTERS 201 the biological process of its activity. Here, as elsewhere, the roof of appearance is lifted off to enable us to see the movement of vast, pur posive, and yet almost inchoate forces. The same exposure is prac ticed on human feeling and appearance. As a result we witness on going endless processes rather than specific events. The reader is al ways looking down into "the hells of circumstance" below the fact. The poetry brings him on a vertically downward journey from ap pearance to process, on a quest for the ever-elusive first principle from which everything else has drawn its life and force. The poems in this volume invoke a drear landscape?so drear and terminal in fact that the imagination seems homeless within it. The recurrence of certain words?shell, ash, torsion, echo?indicates the survival of certain thematic bonds?birth, death, heredity, love, sub jectivity quailing or refusing to quail at the prospect of its own ex tinction. The world of things is inert and given; but the world of feel ing is inherited and, though heredity is a mysterious process, can be understood. Out of that understanding the imagination can gain re newed access to the world of objects. The poet seems to envisage a human world in which community, or at least the sense of it, is en hanced by a contemplation of what binds humans to one another? love, birth, death, the inheritance of physiological as well as psycho logical features, the capacity to endure suffering and even to treat it as the way to understanding. As against that there is the discrete world of object and moiling process. Sometimes, caught in the light of a myth or of a memory, an illusion or an image, that world casts an anthropomorphic shadow. But more often it does not. The charities of the human community are foreign to the indifferent nature of the universe in general. Nevertheless the imagination has a role to play and Mr. Kinsella assigns it one by acknowledging that although we may not be able to discover the meaning things have in themselves, we nevertheless can and must see to it that they have a meaning. Consciousness, after all, governs the world since consciousness (in Merleau-Ponty's words) is that "through which from the outset a world forms itself round me, and begins to exist for me." Thomas Kinsella thus gets back to the primary data of existence its slime, eggs, dung, sweat, accident?and makes the apparent lack of kinship between these phenomena and the consciousness the neces sary precondition of a more profound communion. He accepts the possibility that the universe may be deaf to the cry of human long ing and that this can render the consciousness dumb. But it need not. For in asserting its role in the world the imagination creates art or poetry, and poetry becomes then the discovery of a loudly-struck har mony existing between the mind and the world. In the end there is</page><page sequence="4">202 ARTS AND LETTERS no difference between the wiU and the imagination. The wiU is the imagination in extremis. The determination to take responsibiUty de nouveau for the drear world in which it had seemed such a lost pil grim makes the imagination triumphant, a creative force feeding on the world's given data and then seeking to reproduce itself in a new form. The biological idiom remains saUent, as in the beautiful poem "Hen Woman": I feed upon it stiU, as you see; There is no end to that which, not understood, may yet be noted and hoarded in the imagination, in the yolk of one's own being, so to speak, there to undergo its (quite animal) growth, dividing blindly, twitching, packed with wiU, searching in its own tissue for the structure in which it may wake. Mr. Kinsella is fond of predatory animals in his poetry, but by far the most predatory is his own imagination and its favorite victim is him self: A dry teacup stained the oilcloth where I wrote, bent like a feeding thing over my own source. ("Minstrel" from One) The presence of this seU-fueled strength has become more apparent in each volume since 1968. Notes from the Land of the Dead restores to the imagination the strength to take on the weight of the "whole job of culture." Seamus Heaney comes from the north of Ireland, and his career has almost exactly coincided with the present span of the "troubles." A crisis like the present Irish one inevitably makes demands, sometimes very crudely, on a poet; and Heaney has recently begun to answer these more forthrightly. His first two books?Death of a Naturalist (1966) and Door into the Dark (1969)?charted the boundaries of a luxuriantly experienced private world. These two more recent books concede the presence of a large, violent, and public landscape which is inhabited sometimes by Norsemen, sometimes by policemen, as well as by Mr. Heaney himself?now ready, it seems, to enter into a subtly nuanced dialogue with them on the subjects of poUtics, culture, and</page><page sequence="5">ARTS AND LETTERS 203 poetry. The ancient past and the contemporary present, myth and politics, are in fact analogues for one another in these books. Mr. Heaney is very much in the Irish tradition in that he has learned, more successfully than most, to conceive of his personal experience in terms of his country's history. Even the names of the townlands of County Deny?Anahorish, Toome-lead him directly back to his child hood and into the depths of the area's past history. Accent, etymol ogies, old ritual murders and invasions, contemporary assassinations and security systems?these and other related elements swarm now more and more thickly, the lethal infusoria in this pellucid verse. Some of Mr. Heaney's poems are about words, some about bogs and their well-preserved victims, some about love and marriage, some about the social and political tensions of the Irish situation. But these categories, initially useful, finally give way under sustained rereading. The poems express no politics and indeed they flee conceptual formu lations with an almost indecent success. Instead they interrogate the quality of the relationship between the poet and his mixed political and literary traditions. The answer is always the same. Relationship is unavoidable, but commitment, relationship gone vulgar, is a limiting risk. Nevertheless commitment is demanded during a crisis, and in a poem like "Exposure," the final poem in North, Mr. Heaney faces the further, less welcoming possibility that poetry is itself a commitment and therefore a limitation too. It is what makes the poet miss the comet, "the once-in-a-lifetime portent." On the other hand the de mand to write has come from the public realm. He is called upon to assume responsibility. In doing so, he does not satisfy his critics, for whom his commitment is not of the sort they want; nor does he satisfy himself, for, in attempting to do "the whole job of culture," he may forget to live. When we look again at the faces rising out of the Norse past or the violent present, we see that they are the most vivid renderings in Mr. Heaney's poetry of a deep sense of estrangement. In Wintering Out he associates himself with outcasts or lost remnants of a tradi tion, with victims in fact. We can see this in smaller details too. How often people are poignantly remembered by the mark they leave behind?heelmarks, wound scars, the traces of rings embedded in the flesh or bone. The poet carries these "semaphores of hurt" himself. In "Stump" we read: "I'm cauterized, a black stump of bone." The estrangement of these figures is itself a medium or metaphor of the poet's estrangement. He wonders, again in "Stump": "What do I say if they wheel out their dead?" Later, in North, he has found a way to hear what they say. Remnants are the core of Heaney's treasure. What is scattered in the culture is collected in the poetry. His fondness for</page><page sequence="6">204 ARTS AND LETTERS the word hoard itself and for images or reUcs of the past bursting out of the skin of the aU-preserving peat-bogs would sufficiently indicate this. And what they teU him is clear enough too, as when the "long ship's swimming tongue" speaks in the title poem "North": It said, "Lie down in the word-hoard, burrow the coil and gleam of your furrowed brain. Compose in darkness. Expect aurora boreaUs in the long foray but no cascade of Ught. Keep your eye clear as the bleb of the icicle, trust the feel of what nubbed treasure your hands have known." This is almost a credo. Seamus Heaney could be claiming the right to keep to what he knows; but I think he also means that the reten tion of such intimacy leads to a more profound deepening of knowl edge, a deeper searching in the word-hoard. In the end his varied relationships with his culture are for him a means toward poetry. At the end of every rainbow of association Ues the word-hoard. So he assumes responsibility for language in language. It is a deU cate matter since language is bearing the freight of history and tra dition and Mr. Heaney is expert in the balancing of this cargo in the sensitive scales of his increasingly flexible verse forms and rhythms. Sometimes, in North and in poems Uke "Ocean's Love to Ireland" and "Act of Union," he starches his language into aUegory. Such poems reveal how strongly a plain poUtical or social direction would reduce the complexities of Mr. Heaney's best poems. For aU his local fideU ties and exactitude of physical detail in his world, he is not a local poet. He has subdued, in these two volumes, the longing of personal growth to the pace and patience of the deep culture which fuels it So he can say I grew out of aU this like a weeping willow inclined to the appetites of gravity. ("Kinship" IV)</page><page sequence="7">ARTS AND LETTERS 205 That growing out of and bending back toward, the sobriety of tone, and the lightly submerged wit are all characteristic features. The sense of estrangement is something to be grieved at; but the grief re awakens contacts which the estrangement had lost. In North par ticularly it is notable that many of the poems find voices in which the poet is addressed?for Mr. Heaney wants to hear the sand sift in the hourglass, time's whisper in his Ireland, coming to him in the articu late speech of a poetry implicit in the very artifacts of his world, violently different though it may be from others. In Wintering Oui the poem "The Wool Trade" makes the contrast between the speech of the continental culture associated with wool and that of Ireland where the poet finds: "And I must talk of tweed,/A stiff cloth with flecks like blood." Derek Mahon, also from the north, has so far published three books-Night-Crossing (1968), Lives (1972), and now The Snow Party. His imagination seems to be at once haunted and attracted by the thought of a total apocalyptic disaster which would wipe out the mess of the modern world and leave instead only the ticking of "a slow clock of condensation." Yet his other favorite scenario, "the ideal society which will replace our own," is as elusive and as ironically observed as the apocalypse. For between these two falls the shadow of Belfast, the dark industrial waste in which Mr. Mahon goes time and again to seek what he calls "the original poetry of our Uves." The violence of recent years and the weight of the north's urban and spir itual dreariness have increasingly left their imprint on Mahon s work. From one point of view which he assumes, Belfast is the wasteland, the terminal point, the very antithesis of what a culture might be. But it is also the poet's own territory, his community, lost, but still passionately wishing to be found again: In a tiny stone church On the desolate headland A lost tribe is singing abide with me. ("The Chair Squeaks") The struggle between community and wasteland which consumes so much of Mr. Mahon's writing is not resolved in favor of either. More subtle than a resolution, there is an interweave, so that often we find the longing for community, "the ideal society," spoken by those who are most utterly victimized by the wastage of modern existence. In fact, as in "After Nerval" and "The Apotheosis of Tins," it is the very wastage which speaks or is spoken for. The rubble contains within itself the heavenly city we failed to realize.</page><page sequence="8">206 ARTS AND LETTERS No modern Irish poet has taken the weight of responsibiUty with so much elegance and panache. The very nature of Mr. Mahon s lan guage, "An eddy of semantic scruple/In an unstructurable sea" ("Rage for Order" in Lives), works, in its eloquence against the bleak content. His style is at war with his meaning, for the tight lin guistic control and the dipped, educated vocabulary evoke a sense of rationaUty in contrast to the irrationaUty or apocalyptic nature of the experiences they render. One means by which Mr. Mahon sharpens this paradoxical effect is by the cancellation of time. His poems have a locale, but their voice is that of "The Last of the Fire Kings," the voice of one who is "through with history." It is remark able how often phrases such as this last occur, such denials of the here and now. We have, for instance, in "A Refusal to Mourn" and in "Thammuz" (itself a rewriting of "What WiU Remain" in Lives), in "Leaves" and above aU in "Matthew V. 29-30," a brilUantly exe cuted series of such reductions to nothingness, to "that silence with out bound." The T of these poems, a very Beckettian persona, looks to the lost and inanimate things of the world for speech and hope. History, especiaUy in its Irish form, but not only in that, is a kind of dream, a communal symbol of what we are, reduced by the author to an arid nonidentity in the actual world of the present. But we re main aware that Mr. Mahon remains haunted by the fragile possi bilities of what the dream might, in another world than this, have become. Two poems in particular in this volume retain that fragiUty?the title poem and the final one, "A Disused Shed in Co. Wexford." This latter is dedicated to the EngUsh novelist J. G. Farrell and owes some thing to his novel Troubles (1970). In a disused shed, locked in dark ness since the days of the (last?) Irish civil war, a forest of mush rooms has been growing, straining toward the minimal Ught of the keyhole. The "We" of the poem, inquisitive tourists with their flash cameras, open the door, and in a burst of Ught the weak lost souls of the past are exposed, pleading, to the vacuous present: Lost people of Treblinka and Pompeii! Save us, save us, they seem to say, Let the god not abandon us Who have come so far in darkness and in pain. Here again Mr. Mahon reaches out to rescue the lost history of the victimized, the lost possibiUties of the silent, of the inanimate, of the history in which a future other than the one which we now have once resided. In the other poem, "The Snow Party," we meet again with</page><page sequence="9">ARTS AND LETTERS 207 an image of stillness and pale fragility, a Japanese snow party, as fixed in its odd silence as a Japanese print, while beyond, in the con temporaneous European world, "they are burning/Witches and heretics/In the boiling square" One image is out of history. It is a dream of civility and perfection. The other is in history, savage and barbarous. They are interwoven with one another as the imagination, enduring, is interlocked with time. In this fashion Derek Mahon takes the burden of his culture. Along with the element of repudiation there lives the element of involvement. The striking of a balance between these things is a complex matter. Sometimes, as in "Afterlives," the repudiation is reconsidered. This can lead to feelings of guilt, for Mahon, who lives in London, is aware that he can retain a kind of closeness to home which would be different, if not indeed destroyed, were he to live, say, in Belfast. The question is an old one, especially in Ireland; the question of exile and distance, being free and being trapped, or of being trapped by the idea of freedom itself: Perhaps if I'd stayed behind And lived it bomb by bomb I might have grown up at last And learnt what is meant by home. Perhaps. But what we recognize finally is that the inflection of these poems is toward silence, a home "safe from the historical nightmare." In that respect Mr. Mahon s poetry often reads, with its bitter cour age, like the last will and testament of a dying culture. Richard Murphy is a different kind of exile. He has included in this new volume a selection of poems from Sailing to an Island (1963) and The Battle of Aughrim (1968) plus twenty-five new poems. Com menting on "The Battle of Aughrim" he once said: "I was trying to get clear a division in my mind between England and Ireland?be tween an almost entirely English education, an English mind and Irish feeling." The problem is indeed Anglo-Irish, but that only brings it more closely into accord with the mix of allegiances which we find in Derek Mahon and Seamus Heaney. Mr. Murphy seems to have a dual loyalty. One part of it is to the past of his colonial forbears in Ireland, in Ceylon, and in Rhodesia. Another part is to the past of the Irish people, of which the island he Uves on, off County Galway, with its holy well and Celtic cross, is a Uving emblem. Out of these loyalties he tries to fashion an attitude toward the present. The pres ent is a product of those two pasts and simultaneously, in its spirit, it is their denial. For Mr. Murphy's Ireland is a difficult place for 15</page><page sequence="10">208 ARTS AND LETTERS a poet who wishes to see it in terms foreign to its own, even though these may be anything but a foreigner's terms. In "The Philosopher and the Birds," a poem in memory of Ludwig Wittgenstein's stay at Rosroe in County Galway in 1948, the poet remembers the philoso pher's local reputation for taming wild birds. He associates this with Wittgenstein's breakthrough in linguistic philosophy: "He broke prisons, beginning with words/And at last tamed, by talking, wild birds." But that great creative achievement is savagely revoked in Ireland: His wisdom widens: he becomes worlds Where thoughts are wings. But at Rosroe hordes Of viUage cats have massacred his birds. Mr. Murphy dwells a good deal on sudden calamity, disaster, break down as if in such instances he can test where his ultimate loyalty Ues. The opening poem, "Sailing to an Island," is a sort of emble matic journey through near-disaster to the island where men are ac customed if not resigned to such things. Battles, boat disasters, drowns ings, colonial decline supply the occasions for many of these poems. Yet the tone of the poems is never melodramatic. In fact there are times when it becomes staid Civilization, imaged as an island surrounded by a discordant sea, is a frail thing. The island, of course, can be a colonial one, and the sea can be a horde of rebelUous natives. But Richard Murphy's loyalty is precisely to that kind of situation, one in which crisis is always a ripe possibiUty. Life in such a brooding environment produces sacred things in which a whole culture's values are invested! a Celtic cross, a holy well, an old woman's charity, a particular type of boat. These are the spoor of a tradition, and they are marks both of continuity and of extinction. It is in this world that Mr. Murphy's sensibflity comes most aUve. What he offers in the end are poems in which the culture survives crisis to emerge as something achieved, an artifact of the spirit amidst the debasement of souvenir shops and tourism. It would be impossible right now to say how weU or how badly the "whole job of culture" is being done by poets in Ireland or else where. This essay has no grounds for such a judgment because there are so many other poets involved, and because aU of them are stfll writing, stiU Ustening to "the dying of time in the white Ught of to morrow." But these four poets along with John Montague, Michael Longley, James Simmons, Paul Muldoon, Eavan Boland, and some others bring again to mind the Yeatsian possibiUty of an Ireland which could again become known as "a country of the imagination."</page></plain_text>
