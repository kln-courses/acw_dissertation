Pheidias was particularly famous for making temple statues and other statues of the gods. As a sculptor, Pheidias was a workman, says Aineias, whether or not he produced masterpieces. ôriiiioupyòç : However fine the artist, he remained a manual worker with low social status in the eyes of the aristocratic classes in the Archaic and early Classical periods. In literature, this view persists until considerably later, despite the fact that the status of sculptors at any rate seems to have improved during the 5th century BC, perhaps partly as a result of the growth of democracy in Athens. Artists regularly signed their works and some became fairly wealthy. Note, for instance, Plato's comment about the wealth of Pheidias in Meno , 9 Id. The fact that Polykleitos wrote an important treatise, the Kanon , explaining his system of proportions, may also have improved the image of sculptors, for he could now be counted amongst writers. to €v ' AKpoTTÓXei Kal ev 'OXu|ima . . . âya Xp.a : The second statue referred to here is Pheidias's most famous masterpiece, the Zeus at Olympia.1659 It is most probable that the other work Aineias is thinking of is the Athena Parthenos1660 on the Athenian Akropolis, which was also very famous and which was, like the Zeus, a chryselephantine work.

XXIV (179a26-bl 1). Aristotle is dealing with fallacious arguments, where the conclusion drawn from the premises is false because the attributes do not necessarily belong to the subject. Thus, if something is 'mine' and also 'a piece of work', it is not necessarily 'a piece of my work'. Alexander repeats quite faithfully what Aristotle wrote, but he adds the name Pheidias to make the meaning still plainer.

That they built the Propylaia and the Parthenon. About thirty years after the Persian Wars they began to build, and the buildings were made using tribute money, when Perikles in the archonship of Euthydemos made a decree to carry up to Athena in the Panathenaia the talents lying available in the state treasury, those five thousand talents collected from the cities, according to the assessment of Aristeides, and to carry up a further three thousand to the Akropolis thereafter when the works were taking shape.

These lines were at first thought to come from the epitome of a history of the Periklean age. It was later realized that each section relates to a passage in Demosthenes, C. Androt ., and consists of a paraphrased lemma followed by a comment. That Demosthenes is not quoted directly, but merely paraphrased has suggested to Merritt and Wade-Gery1667 that the author was making excerpts from a fuller commentary on Demosthenes. The papyrus fragment preserves parts of twenty-six lines, which belong to eight different sections, each of which is independent and which shows the author's interest in Athenian constitutional history. on : This word introduces a lemma paraphrasing part of Demosthenes, C. Androt ., 13, where Demosthenes refers to the building of the Propylaia and the Parthenon. It is followed by a brief note of explanation. Ei)0u8iļ|iou : Euthydemos was archon in 431/430 BC, but this name is probably a mistake for Euthynos, the archon of 450/449 BC. In his statement that the builders of the Parthenon and Propylaia were the victors of Salamis, Demosthenes creates the false impression that the buildings were constructed shortly after this battle. The commentator attempts to correct this impression by linking the building programme to a decree of Perikles, implied in Plutarch, Per. 12, to use the tribute reserve to pay for the rebuilding of the temples of Athens. The extant building accounts for the Parthenon begin in 447/446 BC.1668 Work must have started in that year or possibly slightly earlier. Thus the decree of Perikles probably dates from shortly before this time. As Meiggs1669 points out, the commentator's attempt to date the decree to the year of the archonship of Euthydemos cannot be relied upon too strongly, even if one accepts that Euthydemos is a mistake for Euthynos, since decrees did not normally include the archon 's name in the prescript until 421-420 BC. Nevertheless, the papyrus "is still important in adding substance to the building debate in Plutarch", according to Meiggs.1670 TÓXav[Ta . . .

Tà 6TTTQ 0e afierra : Of the seven works listed as world wonders here, only two are not generally found in what later became the canonical list. These are the Walls of Babylon and the Horned Altar of Apollo on Delos. The latter is mentioned only by Martial,1675 while the Walls of Babylon are mentioned by many authors,1676 notably, Antipater,1677 whose poem provides one of the earliest known lists of wonders, dating from the 2nd century BC. This author adds five more works which, he says, are sometimes included in wonder lists: 1. The Asklepios at Epidauros, the 4th century BC chryselephantine image made by Thrasymedes of Paros. This is listed also as the tenth item in the long list in the Codex Vaticanus, 989 , but apparently nowhere else. 2. The Altar of Apollo at Parion, otherwise not mentioned in wonder lists. 3. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, which did become part of the canonical list, and which are included in the lists compiled by Antipater, Philon, Strabo, Martial and Gregory Nazianzenos.1678 4. The standing Athena of Athens. It is tempting to see this as a reference to a work of Pheidias, who had created several standing Athenas of outstanding workmanship for Athens. It is most probably a reference to the Athena Parthenos, which was notable for its great size, for the fabulous amount of gold that covered it and for the detailed decorations adorning it.

In the course of controversy comes the summing up, when we simply set out the elements of the controversy. For instance, suppose Pheidias appropriated gold from the Olympian statue, that he was tortured and that he died. The summing up: "Therefore, I have demonstrated that Pheidias did not steal the gold (which is a conjecture); and that, even if he did steal it, he would be a thief, not a sacrilegious person (which is a definition); and that, even if he was a sacrilegious person, he should have been judged first, not tortured there and then; and that, if it was necessary to judge him, it should have been done by the Athenians (which is participation)." 1679 For instance, Hyginus, Cassiodorus, Gregory of Tours and the first list in Anonymus Taurinensis. 1680 gee Kallimachos, Iambi VI, and Strabo, Geogr. 8.3.30 and notes.</page><page sequence="16">GREEK SOURCES 667 Greek text : Hammer, C.

The anecdote about the heel is not recorded elsewhere. The idea that the Zeus was of hammered gold is found again in two late sources, a note on a poem by Gregorios Nazianzenos and the verses of Tzetzes, but it is doubtful.1682 The discovery of moulds for producing statuary drapery in the rubbish dump of the workshop at Olympia has suggested that a new technique was developed there for producing chryselephantine works.1683 Whether or not this technique was used for the statue of Zeus is not yet known.

Epigram 58 : Antipater's list of wonders is the first known list to include seven world wonders in almost exactly the form in which we know them today (the only difference being that Antipater includes the wall of Babylon rather than the Pharos of Alexandria). The idea of the Seven Wonders can, therefore, be traced back to at least the 2nd century BC. The list probably comes from an earlier source, perhaps from Kallimachos of Cyrene (305-240 BC), who wrote a work, now lost, entitled A collection of wonders in lands throughout the world. Certainly the inclusion of the Colossus of Rhodes, which dates from after 305 BC, and which collapsed in 226 BC in a terrible earthquake, suggests that the list has its origins in the 3rd century BC. The Pharos of Alexandria, which was built during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphos, 284-246 BC, was never included in ancient wonder lists until the 6th century AD, by Gregory of Tours. tòv éíť 'AXcļ)eiū) Zâva : The sanctuary of Olympia is situated in the valley of the river Alphaeus, where it meets the Kladeus. When the Alphaeus changed its course in the 6th century AD, it spelt the end of the sanctuary, which had already been falling into neglect for some time. Theodosius I had officially ordered the closure of all pagan temples and sanctuaries in AD 391/392. Even if his orders were not put into practice at once it is clear that the removal to Constantinople of Pheidias's statue some time before the devastating temple fire of AD 425 must have marked the end of the great days of this sanctuary. The evidence for the exact date of the abolition of the Olympic Games, traditionally held to be in AD 393, is now being called into question. See the scholion to Lucian, Rhet.

Date : Dindorf attributes this comment to the scholiast 'BD', while the next comment (in lines 17-21, Dindorf, III, 320.) he attributes to scholiast 'C'. The comments are very close, though 'C' is much less accurate. The older scholion is that written by 'BD' while the note of 'C' represents a more recent redaction. The best and purest version of the older scholia, including 'BD', is offered by a manuscript which dates from the 12th or very early 13th century AD. In the Byzantine period, and perhaps in late antiquity, the scholia on Aristides were gradually changed and supplemented. The fact that the statues of Athena are talked about in the past tense here suggests that the note was written after the statues were either moved or destroyed, that is after the 5th century AD.

The scholiast maintains that there were three statues of Athena on the Athenian Akropolis: the ancient xoanon, generally called the Athena Polias, the great bronze statue of Pheidias, generally known as the 'Promachos', and the chryselephantine Athena Parthenos. Compare this with the scholion for Aristides, Or. 3.336, ava0Tļ|iaTG)v.

In Or. 34.28, Aristides lists as examples of Pheidias's genius the Zeus at Olympia and three of his Athena statues: the 'ivory' statue, that is, the Athena Parthenos, the bronze statue, that is, the Athena 'Promachos', and the Athena Lemnia. The three Athenas were all on the Akropolis. Two scholia, commenting on Aristides, Or. 1.354, state that there were three statues of Athena on the Akropolis. The first note, attributed to scholiast 'BD', lists the Athena Polias plus two works by Pheidias, the great bronze Athena and the chryselephantine Athena. The more recent, and generally more confused, scholiast 'C' also counts three statues but only names two, the bronze by Pheidias and the chryselephantine statue which he attributes to Praxiteles. Similarly in the ancient scholion to Demosthenes, C. Androt. 13, the writer says there are three Athenas on the Akropolis and he lists the Athena Polias, the Athena 'Promachos' and the Athena Parthenos. It is most unusual to find</page><page sequence="28">GREEK SOURCES 679 that the statues are given names and, apart from in the case of the Parthenos, it is not quite clear which statues the scholiast has in mind. Judging from the other passages mentioned above, one would expect the scholiast to include the ancient xoanon of Athena and the Athena 'Promachos' amongst his three statues of Athena and it is just possible that tò Tfjs no'ioux°u is a distortion of the name of the Athena Polias, which was equated in later times with the ancient wooden xoanon housed in the Erechtheum, while tò 'ApioTetov (the 'monument of valour', the 'memorial') is a reference to the Athena 'Promachos', which was set up as a sort of war memorial after the Persian Wars.1700 f| riapGévoç : It is very rare to find Pheidias's chryselephantine image of Athena called the 'Parthenos' in the sources. It is not clear exactly when the name came into general usage and whether it was ever used as a proper title of the goddess or whether it was just an informal name used locally. The earliest known use of the name to designate the statue occurs in the 4th century BC from the time of Demosthenes.1701 ARISTIDES, Oratio 34.28.

This opinion is shared by Pausanias and Lucian, who both bestow upon it very high praise.1706 When he lists the three Athena statues, Aristides identifies two of them by their material - ivory and bronze - but the Lemnia he names. Perhaps Aristides gives the last statue a name so that he can distinguish this statue either from the other bronze or from the other chryselephantine work mentioned. The material of the Lemnia is generally believed to be bronze but none of the sources which name the statue specify this. 1707 Scholion ARISTIDES, Oratio 34.28, tt)v éXecJxavTÍvriv/ tï'v xaXKrjv/ tt|v Ar'[ivíav.

It seems to me that this is the one that has been set up in the Forum of Constantine, at the entrance of the Council house which they now call the Senate house. Right opposite the Athena, as you go in at the entrance, there is another dedication, Thetis, the mother of Achilles. Her head is crowned with crabs. Ill-informed people today call Athena 'Earth' and Thetis 'Sea', being utterly deceived by the creatures from the sea on Thetis 's head. Greek text : Jahn, O. (1848) Arch . Ztg., No. 15, 239. Date : AD 907. Ô0K61 [ioi ... : This note was written by Arethas, archbishop of Caesarea in AD 907. 1708 It is not clear which statue, mentioned by Aristides, Arethas is commenting upon: the Athena Parthenos, the Athena 'Promachos' or the Athena Lemnia. In the past it was assumed to be the Athena Parthenos.1709 This is now thought to be wrong, for several reasons. Apart from this source, there is no evidence to prove that the Athena Parthenos was ever transported to Constantinople. It is quite possible that the statue by Pheidias had already been destroyed by the time Arethas was writing. The Athena Parthenos was probably removed from the Parthenon in the late 5th century AD.1710 It may have been destroyed by fire.1711 Another argument against the suggestion that Arethas is referring to the Parthenos is the fact that he clearly states that the statue in question was situated in the Forum Constantini at the entrance to the Senate House, not in the Senate House. A statue as delicate as the Parthenos, made primarily of wood, and covered in precious materials, would not have survived very long if it had been left exposed to the elements. Other sources which have to be considered together with this source make it clear that the statue in question was made of bronze, so Arethas must have been referring, rightly or wrongly, to either the 'Promachos' or the Lemnia.1712 The statue which Arethas thought was by Pheidias was in Constantinople in the early 10th century AD, outside the Senate House in the Forum Constantini. It was a statue of Athena and its pendant was a sea-goddess, crowned with crabs, which Arethas calls Thetis. 1708 See Jahn (1848) 239. 1709 See Overbeck (1868) no. 690, 125, for instance, following Dindorf, who states that the words commented upon in the scholion are ' AGrļvdv rr'v eXecJjavTivriv. 1710 See Marinos, Vita Procli , XXX. 1711 Dinsmoor (1934) 93-106 and Stevens (1955) 276 and (1961) 7 suggest that the statue suffered fire damage and was rebuilt while it was still in use as a cult image. Other authors have highlighted a passage in the anonymous Acta Martyrům, Passio Philippi , 5, which may concern the final destruction of the Parthenos by fire. 1712 Konstantinos Rhodios, Ekphr. 1 53ff. ; Kedrenos, Comp. Hist. 1.565; Niketas Choniates, De Isaac., 738B; Zosimos, Hist. Nova,, V.24.7-8.</page><page sequence="31">682 WRITTEN SOURCES Kedrenos, in the late 11th century AD, also tells of the Athena statue outside the Senate House in the Forum Constantini, with the sea-goddess pendant. He says that the sea- goddess was Amphitrite. He does not say who made the statues. He adds several points which are not found in Arethas: that the Athena was on the west side, the sea-goddess on the east side; that both statues came from Lindos in Rhodes; that the Athena statue stood on ground level and that the Athena had a helmet, gorgoneion and snake necklaces wound about the throat. The language used by Kedrenos proves that he was dependent, directly or indirectly, on the words of another writer, a contemporary of Arethas: Konstantinos Rhodios. Konstantinos Rhodios, writing in the earlier 10th century AD, wrote a poem in which he described the wonders of Constantinople. Amongst these, he includes a short description of a statue of Athena in the Forum Constantini. He does not specify where in the Forum this statue was, but the description of the goddess wearing the helmet, gorgoneion and the snake necklaces about the throat is precisely the same as in Kedrenos, except in one particular: Konstantinos affirms that the figure was placed on top of a high column. He also includes two details which Kedrenos omits: the statue was made of bronze and it stood with one hand stretched out towards the sky. There is no mention of the sea-goddess pendant, nor of the possible authorship of the statue, but the provenance is given as in Kedrenos, namely Lindos. This is probably the same statue as Kedrenos was talking about, though either Kedrenos is wrong about the lack of a column or, in the passage of time - almost two centuries - the column went missing. The Lindian sanctuary of Athena, in Rhodes, furnished Constantine the Great with several works for his new palace in Constantinople. There was an idol of Athena in malachite, reputedly made by Dipoinos and Skyllis, which perished in the fire in the Lauseion in AD 462 1713; there was a statue of Athena placed in front of the Senate of the Augusteion as a pendant for the statue of Zeus of Dodona1714; and there was the sea- goddess pendant of the statue in question. Perhaps we should trust Konstantinos when he says the Athena he was describing came from Lindos. On the other hand, was he possibly confusing the provenance of this statue with that of the pendant sea-goddess, or indeed with that of the other Athena, the pendant of the Zeus from Dodona? This would be an easy mistake to make. Linking these sources with the description by Niketas Choniates, De Isaac. 738B, of the destruction of an Athena statue in the Forum of Constantine in the early 13th century AD, Linfert proposed that there was one Athena statue in the Forum of Constantine and it was the Lemnia by Pheidias, and that 'Lindia' was an 'acoustic misunderstanding' of 'Lemnia'.1715 He argues for the Lemnia on the grounds that the 'Promachos' would have been much too large to place on top of a column (if that is what Niketas means by aTTļXrļ). In addition, he argues that the odd beckoning gesture of the right hand and the peculiar arrangement of the hair of the statue described by Niketas would be explained if this statue 1713 See Kedrenos, Comp. Hist. 1.564 and 616 and Zonaras, Ep. Hist. 2. 1714 See Zosimos, Hist. Nov.V.24.1. 1715 Linfert (1982) 62.</page><page sequence="32">GREEK SOURCES 683 were the Lemnia, because the Lemnia was designed, he says, to be bare-headed and to hold the helmet in one hand; if, in later times, the helmet was put on the head, then the consequences would be to make the helmet-holding hand and the hair look rather odd. There is reason to doubt, however, that all the sources mentioned refer to one and the same statue.1716 The more traditional view is that the statue described by Niketas was truly colossal and that it might be correct, therefore, to identify it with the Athena ' Promachos ' of Pheidias.1717 The size and the iconography of the statue, as described by Niketas, accords quite well with this theory. Apart from Arethas, no source affirms that the statue he describes was by Pheidias and Arethas was certainly no expert in Classical Greek art.1718 Constantinople had earlier housed at least one work of Pheidias, namely the Zeus of Olympia, so it is possible that there were others in the city.

Many reasons are also given for the war; the first is the one relating to Perikles. For they say that when the Athenians were having the ivory Athena made and they had appointed Perikles as the overseer of the work and Pheidias as the craftsman, Pheidias was convicted of peculation. Perikles took precautions against being asked for accounts himself and, as he wanted to avoid trials, he orchestrated this war, writing the decree against the Megarians. The poet of old comedy also confirmed these events, writing as follows: Oh, you destitute farmers, listen to my words, if you want to hear how it was lost. For first Pheidias started the mischief, acting wrongly; then Perikles became scared he might share his fate (he was afraid of your nature and your headstrong manner), and before he himself suffered any evil, he set the city ablaze, throwing in the small spark of the Megarian decree, and he produced such a great war that all the Greeks were in tears on account of the smoke, those over there, as well as those over here.

In both cases there is no mention of the later fate of the artist, and Pheidias is brought into the account merely to show how Perikles came into difficulties and so provoked the war. Nevertheless, the differences that exist between the two passages indicate that Aristodemos was not drawing directly from Diodorus for his version of the story. Firstly, the account by Aristodemos is much less detailed than that of Diodorus. Secondly, there are small textual differences between the two accounts: Aristodemos calls the statue the 'ivory Athena', he describes Perikles's position as epyeiTi(jTdTT]ç, he says Perikles wrote the Megarian decree, ypái)jaç, and Aristophanes öiamaToOTai the story. In comparison with this, Diodorus refers to 'the statue of Athena'; he calls Perikles &lt;ETTi|ieXT1TT]ç; he talks in XII. 39.4 of the Megarian decree as already in existence, stating in XII. 39. 5 that what started the war was the Athenian refusal (at Perikles's instigation) to abrogate the decree; and in XII.40.6 he says Aristophanes 'ie' ivr|Tai these events. Diodorus states explicitly that he was drawing from Ephoros, and it seems more than likely that Aristodemos was doing the same. This is suggested by the nature of the quotations drawn from Aristophanes. Both authors quote Aristophanes, Pax , 603-11, and just as they both omit line 608 (Diodorus also omits line 607), they also write XiTTepvfjTeç in line 603 instead of aocķojTaToi, the word which appears in all the manuscripts of Aristophanes. Both authors also quote from Aristophanes, Acharnians : Aristodemos, lines 524-33, Diodorus, lines 530-31. em vo(j(ļ)i(j|icI) : Most of the sources relating to the trial of Pheidias seem to agree that he was charged for some sort of theft relating to the funds or materials destined for the Athena Parthenos, and that Perikles was implicated in this affair, either through negligence or dishonesty, in virtue of his position as one of the overseers of the project. In Diodorus 's account it is clear that the attack on Pheidias was politically motivated, and that it aimed indirectly at Perikles himself.1722 From Diodorus one can add that the accusation against Pheidias was made by his fellow workmen,1723 that the accusation was brought before the Ecclesia, who found it to be valid, that Pheidias was consequently arrested and that a charge was then made against Perikles. The exact nature of the charge against Pheidias is 1721 Diodorus Siculus, Bibl. Hist. XII.39.lff.; Plutarch, Per. 31 and 32; Aristophanes, Pax, 605ff. and scholia. 1722 Diodorus Siculus, Bibl. Hist.

The authors dependent on Ephoros do not discuss Pheidias' s end. For information on this one must turn to Plutarch, Per. 31.2ff.

Perikles, the Athenian general, took the money of the people for the construction of a statue made entirely of gold for Athena; he made it of ivory and appropriated much of the money in collaboration with the sculptor Pheidias. When he was condemned for squandering most of the money, he claimed he had spent it for needful purposes. From that there arose this saying. For if anyone had squandered something and was asked where it had been used up, he would say with magnanimity that he had spent it for needful purposes. Greek text : Holwerda, D.

For first Pheidias started the mischief, acting wrongly; then Perikles became scared he may share his fate (for he was afraid of your nature and your hard-biting temper), and before he himself suffered any evil, he set the city ablaze, throwing in the small spark of the Megarian decree, and he produced such a great war that all the Greeks were in tears on account of the smoke, those over there, as well as those over here.

Pax , 603-1 1 : The speaker is Hermes and he is explaining to the chorus of peasants the 'real causes' of the Peloponnesian War, how peace was lost. The play was first performed in the spring of 421 BC, that is ten years after the outbreak of the war. The poet suggests that the accusations made against Pheidias led to the implication of Perikles, and that the general decided to risk war in order to escape being brought to trial himself. Four years earlier, in the Acharnians, Aristophanes had also explained the war and the Megarian decree in terms of Perikles 's private affairs, but in that play Perikles 's motives are manifestly invented to raise a laugh in the audience: to avenge the abduction of one of their courtesans, the Megarians abduct two of Aspasia's prostitutes, much to Perikles's fury! In Pax , Perikles's motivation is not obviously funny and the similarities between the account in Aristophanes and those in the Ephoros-based sources suggest that the story adumbrated by Aristophanes does spring from real events.1735 Aristophanes does not go into much 1734 Concerning Perikles being brought to trial in connection with the charge brought against Pheidias, see Aristodemos, FGrH 104.16.1-6; Aristophanes, Pax , 605ff. and scholia; Plutarch, Per. 31-32; and Diodorus Siculus, Bibl.

The fame of Perikles and Pheidias was immense and the Pheidias affair must have been a cause célèbre, particularly if Perikles was implicated. As the earliest source on the subject of Pheidias's troubles, and a contemporary one, it is of importance in setting the date around the time of the Megarian decree. w XiTTepyfļTes yewpyoi : The word XiTT6pvfļTeg is restored from the manuscripts of Diodorus Siculus, Bibi Hist.

Aristodemos and Diodorus, in the passages just mentioned, talk of peculation and appropriation of sacred funds relating to the Athena Parthenos. The scholiasts writing about this passage, drawing from Philochoros, talk of theft of the expensive materials used in the production of the statue. One of them thinks it was the ivory, the other the gold snakes of the goddess. Plutarch, Per. 31.2, says Pheidias stole some of the gold too, but then he adds that the accusation could not be proved and so Pheidias was found guilty of another crime: that of depicting likenesses of himself and Perikles on the goddess's shield. eÍTa FLepiicXeris c()oßr|0eis M-fļ [leTaaxoi tx's tuxes' : A reference to Perikles's possible implication in the Pheidias affair, which probably did lead to a trial eventually.

The reason the date is sometimes doubted is because of the apparently conflicting evidence of the scholia on this passage, which claim to be quoting the 4th century BC historian, Philochoros. Errors in the text, however, as well as disagreements between the two versions of the story, make the scholia of doubtful value. 1736 Thucydides, 1.67.4, writes of the Megarian complaint to Sparta, in autumn, 432 BC, but when the Decree was first implemented is not known. Aristophanes, Ach. 535-37, leads one to believe that there was a certain time lapse between the two: evrevQev oí Me-yapflę, ore ôrfTTeivwv ßaör|v, AaKeôai^oviœv éôéovTO TÒ ijiTļcķiaļi' õttgjç |jL€Ta(jTpa&lt;l&gt;eÍT1 tò ôià tòç XaiKacrrpiaç.

He argues that the Megarians would have been in considerable discomfort after one year.

The gold weighed forty- four talents. Perikles was supervisor, Pheidias was the sculptor. - Pheidias, who made the statue, was tried for falsifying the accounts for the ivory used to make the scales. Fleeing to Elis, he is said to have contracted to make the statue of Zeus at Olympia and to have been put to death by the Eleians when he had completed it. In the archonship of Skythodoros, who came seven years later, talking about the Megarians he says, - and they complained about the Athenians to the Lakedaimonians, saying that they were unjustly excluded from the markets and harbours by the Athenians. For the Athenians voted in favour of this on Perikles' s advice, accusing them of working the sacred land of the Two Goddesses. Some people say that when Pheidias the sculptor was convicted of defrauding the city and was sent into exile, Perikles, in fright because he had been overseer of the construction of the statue and he had been a party to the theft, proposed the decree against the Megarians and brought on the war, so that he would not have to submit his accounts for examination</page><page sequence="43">694 WRITTEN SOURCES to the Athenians who would have no leisure in wartime. He accused the Megarians of working the holy meadow of the two goddesses. But the suspicion against Perikles seems absurd, since the events concerning Pheidias took place seven years before the start of the war. (Scholiast 2, 605) As Philochoros says, when Pythodoros was archon, after he had constructed the statue of Athena, Pheidias stole the gold from the serpents of the chryselephantine Athena - for which deed sentence was passed against him and he was punished by exile. When he was in Elis and he had undertaken to make the statue of Zeus at Olympia for the Eleians, he was condemned by them and put to death for embezzlement. (Scholiast 2, 606) So then Perikles became afraid: and so then Perikles feared that he might share his fate, that is, he took care that he too was not punished with exile - for it appeared that Perikles was a party to the theft, since he had been appointed as an overseer of the work by the Athenians - therefore, fearing that he would be convicted for the thefts, he set in motion the Peloponnesian War, hoping that confusion would break out and that with the war the Athenians would have no spare time and would not check the accounts.

He is known to have consulted Attic archives. His works survive only in fragments.1739 riu0o86)poi; . . . Eia&gt;0o86)pou : The names of the archons are confused. The first scholiast refers first to Pythodoros and then to Skythodoros, while the second scholiast only refers to Pythodoros.

In 438 BC, Olympiad 85.3, Theodoros was archon. It seems probable, 1737 R is the Codex Ravennas 429; V is the Codex Marcianus graecus 474, T is the Codex Laurentianus plut 31,15 and the Codex Vossianus graecus F. 52.

Hieronymus, quoting Eusebios, dates the inauguration of the statue to Olympiad 85.2, but the interval is negligible, especially since the Great Panathenaea were celebrated at the beginning of the Attic year.1741 Jacoby comments, "It is annoying that the names of the archons are corrupt in both excerpts, but no more than just annoying, as the interval between the two archons is preserved in the first excerpt; the alterations by Lepaulmier (nuöwöopou to Geoôwpou, and ZKuôoôwpou to nuGoôwpou) are slight but certain".1742 According to Lendle, the reference to two different archons by Philochoros suggests that Philochoros mentioned Pheidias twice in his work, once in connection with the completion of the Athena Parthenos in 438/37 BC, and a second time in connection with his accusation and trial in 432/31 BC.1743 The first scholiast begins by a reference to the setting up of the Athena Parthenos in her temple, which we know took place in 438/37 BC, before talking about the Megarian decree, while the second scholiast refers to Pythodoros and the troubles of Pheidias, but he does not specify when the Parthenos was completed. to áya'[ia tò xpuoow : 'The golden statue' is the Athena Parthenos, and the phrase reflects the terminology used in the inscriptions of the 5th and 4th centuries giving the accounts and inventory lists for the statue. Most of the first sentence, which can be verified from other sources, could plausibly be a faithful record of what Philochoros wrote. Xpuaiou CFTa0[iòv TaXdvTwv 1 18 ' : 44 talents, that is 1,144 kg or about 2508 lbs of gold.1744 The equivalent value today would amount to about £9 million. For the weight of the gold, which is recorded by several sources, see Plutarch and the relevant note.1745 riepiKXeouç eTucrTaTouvTos : This phrase provides the valuable information that Perikles's official role in the project was that of epistates. Compare the title epyemaTcxTTis in Aristodemos, FgrH 104.16.1, and eTri|ie'T]TT1ę in Diodorus Siculus, Bib. Hist. XII.39.1. In the building accounts for the statue, the secretary of the epistatai, who changed annually, is named in the prescript but the epistatai are not named, suggesting that they stayed in post until the work was completed. It was in his capacity as one of the overseers of the work that Perikles was in danger of being held to account. Oeiôíou 8è TToiīļaavTos : The artist's name was recorded on a stele, but not on the statue itself. See Plutarch, Per. 13. Iff. and Cicero, Tusc. 1.15.34.

Aer. 2.</page><page sequence="45">696 WRITTEN SOURCES Parthenos. Lendle argues convincingly that this sentence is an interpolation of very doubtful reliability.1746 It disagrees with the version in the second scholion concerning what was stolen. Furthermore, the use of the phrase Kal Oeiôiaç ó TToiiļaas, coming as it does just after Oeiôiou 8è TTonļaavTos, is otiose and, therefore, suspect. No other source mentions the theft of ivory whereas there are other references to the theft of gold (Plutarch, Per. 3 If.) or sacred money (Diodorus Siculus, XII.39.1). It is difficult to see how one could take this claim seriously.1747 eis 'HXiv ktX. : The first scholiast's reading of Philochoros is that Pheidias fled to Elis when he was accused by the Athenians of falsifying the accounts, that he then made the Zeus at Olympia, and, seven years after leaving Athens, was put to death by the Eleians. The fact that Pheidias was convicted is confirmed by Aristodemos, Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch, and these last two authors also tell us that he was sent to prison. It seems unlikely and rather puzzling, however, that he should have been put to death by the Eleians, especially as no reason is given here. The use of the word XeyeTai indicates that the sentence gives information which comes from tradition. It is therefore not supposed to be read as a statement with the authority of official documents behind it, as is the case for the first sentence. No other source, apart from the second scholiast, says that Pheidias was put to death by the Eleians. The idea seems to be completely fanciful and indeed the fictitious trial of Pheidias by the Eleians is sometimes found as a rhetorician's school exercise.1748 For these reasons, the value of the information in this sentence is questionable without external evidence. The sentence is perhaps a second interpolation. TTepi Meyapecov eiTTwv erri, Kal aÚTol ktX. : With the amendment of the archon's name, the scholiast quotes Philochoros as saying that the Megarian complaint to Sparta dated to the year when Pythodoros was archon, that is 432 BC, the date given by Thucydides, 1.67.4. He does not give a date for the Megarian decree itself, which must have been enforced a few months or perhaps a year earlier. TTļv yfjv avrovç aiTiciļievoi rr'v lepàv toiç Geotç aTTepya£e(j0ai : The excuse given for the Megarian decree was that the Megarians were working ground that was sacred to Demeter and Kore.1749 1746 Lendle (1955) 296ff. 1747 Donnay (1968a) 20 n. 4, interprets the word (ļ&gt;oXis in the technical sense, "plaque de revêtement", referring to the ivory used for the statue in general, rather than the particular ivory used for any serpent. Weber (1993) 114-15 insists that the word &lt;1&gt;oXíç cannot mean anything but the scale of a reptile and she suggests that Athena's aegis was probably covered in ivory scales. The material of the aegis is not known, but Pausanias, 1.24.7, states that the gorgoneion on the aegis was made of ivory. 1748 See Anonymus Seguerianus, Ars Rhetorica , 216, and Seneca Rhetor, Contr. VIII.2. 1749 Thucydides, 1.139.</page><page sequence="46">GREEK SOURCES 697 Xéyoixji ôè rives ... : For the idea that Perikles started the Peloponnesian War in order to deflect people's attention away from the accounts for the Athena Parthenos, for which he was partly responsible as one of the epistates, see Diodorus Siculus and Aristodemos, who are based on Ephoros, and also Aristophanes.1750 Perhaps these are some of the writers being alluded to in the loose word rives. An accusation of fraud against Pheidias would certainly threaten Perikles, for it would imply that, as one of the epistatai in charge of the accounts for the work, Perikles must either have been negligent in his duties or in connivance with Pheidias. One should not underestimate the threat that this affair may have represented for Perikles. As a commentary on Aristophanes, Pax 605 ff. and related sources, this part of the text is not attributable to Philochoros, according to Lendle.1751 aXoyog 8e cķaiveTai r| KaTÒ nepiKXeous ímóvoia ktX. : This phrase is a comment by the scholiast on the information gathered so far. It expresses the writer's surprise that people should suspect Perikles of fomenting war because he was afraid of the consequences for himself if Pheidias were found guilty. The scholiast is at a loss to understand this, given the seven year gap between Pheidias 's troubles and the Megarian crisis. This suggests that the scholiast accepted the phrase concerning the accusation made against Pheidias as part of Philochoros 's text for the events of the year 438 BC. As shown above, however, this part of the text, along with the next phrases concerning Pheidias 's flight to Elis and his death at the hands of the Eleians, is suspect and probably a later interpolation. All the other sources agree that Perikles was in danger of accusation since he was one of the epistatai in charge of supervising the construction of the Athena Parthenos. ¿S OiXóxopóç cļ)Tļaiv, 6TTL rii&gt;0o8o)poi&gt; apxovToç : Now comes the second scholiast's commentary on Pax 605-06. He too claims to be quoting Philochoros but all his material is supposed to come from the events of 432 BC. to ayaXfia rf's 'A0r|vâç KaTaaKeuáaaç : Unlike the first scholiast, who quotes Philochoros as saying that the Athena Parthenos was finished in 438 BC, the second scholiast omits this date and claims to report the events of 432 BC mentioned by Philochoros, well after the statue was completed. ucļ)€iXeTO to xP^críov ôpaKÓvTtov : The second scholiast reports that Pheidias stole gold from the serpents of the Athena Parthenos. Leipen suggests that he may be thinking of the snakes on the aegis of the goddess, which might well have been made of gold or gilded bronze, or the bracelets of the goddess.1752 And, as Leipen says, such snake bracelets were often referred to as ôpaKOVTeç, rather than as a i^eXXiov or xXlôojv. That Pheidias was accused of stealing gold agrees with Plutarch, Per. 31.3. And Diodorus Siculus, XII.40.3, writes of theft of lepa xpiíl¿aTa. This external evidence suggests that the 1750 Diodorus Siculus, Bibl. Hist. XII.39.lff.; Aristodemos, FGrH 104.16.1-2; Aristophanes, Pax , 605 ff. 1751 Lendle (1955) 289. 1752 Leipen (1971) 29.</page><page sequence="47">698 WRITTEN SOURCES second scholiast is more likely to be quoting Philochoros at this point than the first scholiast, who talks of theft of ivory. ecļ&gt;' w KarayvMoQeis : That Pheidias was found guilty and convicted agrees with several other sources: Aristophanes himself, Pax, 605ff., Diodorus Siculus, XII. 39. 1-5, Aristodemos, FgrH 104.16.1-2, and Plutarch, Per. 31-32. This phrase may, therefore, go back to Philochoros. eCTļ|iLCi)0Tļ (t&gt;uyfì : An embezzler would not have been punished by exile. The error suggests that these words and the following words, concerning Pheidias going to Elis and later being convicted by the Eleians, which are supported solely by the first scholiast, are part of another interpolation in the text of Philochoros.1753 As Lendle demonstrates, the passage from e£r]|JUto0Ti (ļ)iryr| to KotTayvwcrôeis im' aÚTÔv is suspicious not only because of its dubious content, but also because of the repetition of the word KaTayvcoaGeiç from line 20 and the repeated use of participles, in yevóiievoç, epyoXaßT1aas and KaTcryvû)(j0eLÇ which is not in keeping with Philochoros 's style.1754 KaTayvü)CF0eis im' aÚTwv (í)ç vocjcJh aá iievoç avi^peGrļ : There is no evidence to support the idea that Pheidias was found guilty of embezzlement in Olympia. Rhetoricians, like Seneca Rhetor and Cornutus, went in for imagining new trials for Phedias, so that their pupils could then compose speeches for and against him, but this can hardly be described as evidence in favour of a real second trial.1755 It seems more probable that this part of the second scholion is an attempt to find a justification for Pheidias's supposed punishment at the hands of the Eleians, a justification which is entirely missing in the parallel passage in the first scholion. That the Eleians were proud to have Pheidias as the sculptor of their cult image of Zeus is proved by the fact that Pausanias saw Pheidias's signature on the statue.1756 This would have been removed surely if Pheidias had been found guilty of a crime bad enough to deserve the death sentence. eÍTa riepiKXeris c|)oßr|0eis ktX. : In this part, the second scholiast comments on Pax 606, without apparently drawing on Philochoros. He repeats the same information as often found in the sources concerning Perikles's fear of being implicated in the charges brought against Pheidias and of starting a war in order to distract attention from the accounts of the Athena Parthenos. He adds nothing new, except the unfounded notion that Perikles was afraid that he too would be sent into exile. 1753 Lendle (1955) 290. 1754 Lendle (1955) 301. ' 7^ See Seneca Rhetor, Contr.

The result was that the old silver coinage could no longer be minted, so instead the Athenians produced gold coins by melting down offerings on the Akropolis. According to Hellanikos, the new gold coins were first issued in 407/406 BC. Philochoros apparently suggested that some of the gold came from the golden Nikai kept on the Akropolis. It was perhaps also at this date that some golden leaves and necklaces disappeared from the Athena Parthenos.

It cannot be ruled out, even though the statue was more usually referred to as r| 0eóç or tò (xpucroOv) ayaX|ia in the 5th and 4th centuries BC.

Pliny mentions a statue of a cliduchus by Pheidias.1761 Given the context, the statue was in bronze. It is possible that Pliny had in mind the statue we commonly refer to as the 'Promachos' though this is very uncertain. The title 'key-bearer' would not be inappropriate for an image of the goddess standing beyond the Propylaia, guardian of the city and of the sanctuaries on the Akropolis. 1760 Anderson (1995) 64. 1761 Pliny, NH 34.54.</page><page sequence="52">GREEK SOURCES 703 ARISTOTLE, Athenaion Politeia, 47.1.

These words are generally understood to mean 'stone carver' and 'statue maker' (usually bronze statues), and consequently the passage may be seen as confirmation of the view put forward by several late sources that Pheidias was famous as a sculptor in stone.1765 Very few marble works made by Pheidias are mentioned in the sources. Several of the sources name the Nemesis at Rhamnous and the Aphrodite in the Gardens at Athens, but these are suspected to be by pupils of Pheidias. Then there are the dubious cases of the Aphrodite Ourania in Athens,1766 a Venus taken to Rome,1767 and the Hermes Pronaos at Thebes.1768 These are attributed to Pheidias by one source only and virtually nothing is known about them. There is no description of the works, no details about when they were made. In the case of the last two statues the attribution itself is not made with certainty. To this list one 1764 Plato, Meno 9 1 d; Cicero, Or. 2.8; Lucian, De Salt. 35; Pro Imag. 14; Somn. 8 and 9. 1765 See, for instance, Lucian, Jup. Trag. 7.9ff.; Hesychios, Lex.

Both these statues are attributed to Pheidias by two separate sources.1769 Finally, there are the Parthenon sculptures. These are a special problem since they receive very little attention in the sources, probably as they are not free-standing sculptures. It is not clear what Plutarch means when he says that Pheidias was the emcjKOTTOs of the whole Parthenon project.1770 Perhaps Aristotle's words in this passage should be seen as evidence that Pheidias played an important part in the creation of these sculptures. In contrast to these uncertain references to Pheidias 's skill as a stone sculptor, the references to Pheidias as the greatest creator of chryselephantine works are very numerous and clear. A large number of the sources deal with Pheidias 's chryselephantine Zeus at Olympia or Athena Parthenos at Athens, and comment on the fame that these works gave him. If Aristotle were trying to find one word to characterize and distinguish between the two most famous sculptors of the Classical period, then he would surely have wanted to describe Polykleitos as the greatest bronze statuary and Pheidias as the most renowned maker of chryselephantine statues. In Physics 1.7. 190b, in a passage enumerating the different ways in which objects or beings come into existence, Aristotle says: yiyveTai 8è Tà yiyvó|ieva aTTXws Ta 'xév |ieTaaxTļ|iaTi(j€i, olov àvôpiáç, tò 8è TTpoaöeaei, olov Ta aú£avó|i€va, Ta 8' acķaipeaei, olov €k tov XiGoi; ó fEp|iiļs, Ta 8è awGeaei, olov oiKÍa, Ta 8' aXXoiwcrei, olov Ta TpeīTOļieva KaTà TT|v #Xt)v. (Ross, W. D. (1950) Aristotelis Physica. Oxford Clarendon Press © Oxford University Press). Things that come into existence do so simply, some by change of shape, for instance a bronze statue; others by addition, for instance things that grow; others by subtraction, as in the case of the Hermes made out of stone; others by synthesis, for instance a house; and others by alteration, for instance changes to the properties of the material. In this passage Aristotle distinguishes between two types of sculpture: one 'plastic', which involves the pouring of fluid matter, such as molten bronze, into a mould, the other 'glyptic', which involves the cutting of a hard substance, such as marble. Within these broad categories, the first technique could also include work in terracotta presumably, while the latter could include work in wood or even ivory. Dio Chrysostomos makes the same distinction, defining the art of stone carvers and wood workers thus "kot' óXíyov TTļ9 T€X^TļS acķaipoiiaTis tò TTepiTTÓv, 6 (os äv KaTaXiTTT)i auTÒ tò (1)aivó|ievov e! 80s." (the skill of removing, little by little, the excessive material, until the observable image itself is all that is left).1771 Plato points out the similarities between marble and ivory.1772 These materials were sometimes interchangeable, as can be inferred from the 1769 For the Athena Areia see Pausanias, IX.4.1, and Plutarch, Arist. 20; for the Mother of the gods see Pausanias, 1.3.5, and Arrian, Peripl. 9.1. 1770 Plutarch, Per. 13.6. 1771 Or.

Furthermore Pliny includes his description of the Athena Parthenos in Book 36 of his Naturalis Historia , the book about marble. For all these reasons, Donnay suggests that in this passage Aristotle was using the word Xi0oupyòç in the widest possible sense, describing the technique employed by each sculptor without specific reference to the material they employed.1773 This seems to be the interpretation of Dionysios of Halicarnassus too, who classes Polykleitos with the uXaorai , moulders, and Pheidias with the yXi&gt;(1&gt;eiç, carvers.1774 Such an interpretation perhaps makes this passage of Aristotle more intelligible. It also puts later sources in their proper perspective: they seem to be based on a misunderstanding of earlier sources, apparently reinforced by dubious Hellenistic attributions to Pheidias of famous Classical masterpieces in marble. One should, therefore, conclude that, when Aristotle describes Pheidias as a XiGoupyóç, he is not contradicting the idea that Pheidias was best known for his chryselephantine works. The word ávôpiavTOTToióç implies the making of statues of men. Perhaps this is also part of the distinction Aristotle is trying to draw between the two artists. For while Polykleitos primarily made images of men, athletes and so on, Pheidias was much more famous for his statues of gods. The word XiGoupyóç does not specify what Pheidias made, but perhaps Aristotle is trying to convey the idea that, unlike Pheidias, Polykleitos specialized in statues of men.

Preisshofen's analysis of this passage and the related sources shows that this story probably grew from a very small seed,1781 and the present passage contains an important development in the transmission of the story. For, until now, the shield portrait has always been mentioned as an example within a particular context. For example, Cicero and Valerius Maximus use it to show how an artist signed his work.1782 In this passage, however, it is introduced as a single phenomenon worthy of note. The effect is to isolate and highlight the 'wonder mechanism' of the shield, as Preisshofen calls it. Ampelius, writing about the same time or a bit later, does exactly the same, including the Athena Parthenos in his list of world wonders precisely because it supposedly had this wonderful mechanism.1783 CORPUS ARISTOTELICUM, De Mundo , 6 (Bekker page 399b). 601K6 8è ovtcoç, et Kai |iiKpÓT€pov TTapaßaXXeiv , tolç ó|i(|)aXoiç Xeyo|iévois tolç èv Tais ipaXíaiv [XíGoiç], oí fieaoi Keífievoi Kcrrà tt|v eis eKÓTepov jiépoç ëvôeaiv èv apļiovia TTļpoūai Kal èv Ta£ei tò lîâv ax^a Tfļs ^aXiôoç Kal cikívt]tov. cļ)aal 8è Kai tòv àyaX|iaTOTTOiòv Oeiôíav KaraoKeváCovra rr'v èv aKpOTTÓXei 'AGiļvāv èv |iéai] tt) tclvtt)s aaTTLÔi to ¿auToû TTpóacoTTov evTUTTwaaaGai, Kal auvSfļaai tw àyáX|iaTi ôiá tivoç acķavoūs ôr||iioi;pyíag, (3aT6 éÇ avayKTļg, el tiç ßouXoiTO ai)TÒ uepiaipeiv, tò ov[li'glv ayaX|ia Xveiv re Kai auyxeiv. toütov ovv ex^i tòv Xóyov ó 0eòç èv KÓ(j|i(p, awéxwv rf'v twv óXwv apļioviav re Kai awTTjpíay, tt't'v oÍTe [xéaoç ¿y, êv0a r| yrj re Kai ó GoXepòg tóttoç oútoç, àXX' avo) KaGapòs èv KaGapco x^P^ ßeßriKw?.

A secondary use of the word is the raised boss in the middle of a shield, and this meaning is used for the second comparison that is made. The two images are not kept entirely separate, however, for the shield device is reputed to have a structural importance that is similar to a keystone, controlling and maintaining the structure in which it exists. On the other hand, whereas the Pheidias portrait is thought to be at the centre of this structure, God is visualized as above it. (ļrnai 8è Kal ... : The same theme is repeated in a very similar manner in the later passage.1786 ev ļiearļ tt¡ àamôi : The idea that the shield of the Athena Parthenos bore a portrait of Pheidias on its outer surface is found in Valerius Maximus, writing in the 1st century AD.1787 It can further be traced back to the 1st century BC, when Cicero talks of a likeness of Pheidias on the shield.1788 In the present passage, for the first time, the portrait is said to be in the middle of the shield. This idea holds firm in later works, even though it is probably untrue.1789 Archaeological evidence shows that the central part of the shield was occupied by a gorgoneion. Preisshofen suggests that the idea springs from the present author's desire to use the shield of the Parthenos to illustrate God's position in the universe.1790 The central place of God in the universe, which is first likened to the key stone in an arch, is also compared to the portrait of Pheidias on the shield of the Parthenos. In the mind of the author the central importance of the portrait seems to gain it a central position on the shield. 1784 See Preisshofen (1974) 59. 1785 Reale (1974) 32. 1786 Corpus Aristotelicum, De Mir.

In the account of Valerius Maximus, the removal of the portrait of Pheidias meant the destruction of the shield only.1791 It now seems that the portrait holds the whole statue together in some amazing manner. This shift is clearly made in order to heighten the comparison with God's position in the universe. Later authors accept the present version without question.

The Pythian Apollo is the work of Theodoros and Telekles, and the Delian Apollo and Artemis are the artistic creations of Tektaios and Angelion.

The Aphrodite in Knidos is another work by Praxiteles while the Asklepios in Epidauros is by Pheidias. Greek text : Schoedel, W. R. (1972) Legatio pro Christo &amp; De Resurr ectione. Athenagoras , 36. Oxford Early Christian Texts. Oxford: Clarendon Press © Oxford University Press. Date : Probably written between AD 176 and 178. In this chapter he is making the point that Christians are not atheists simply because they do not worship images, however ancient and venerable these may be, for statues are man-made creations of perishable matter. Athenagoras is careful not to alienate his Imperial masters by railing against the pagan gods themselves, but limits his comments to their man-made images. His information concerning art is generally not very reliable. ó 8è riuGioç êpyov Oeoôciipou Kai Tt1X€kXéouç : The Archaic xoanon of Pythian Apollo was made by Theodoros and Telekles for the Samians. It is described by Diodorus Siculus (1.98.5-9) as a standing image. Theodoros of Samos flourished around 550 BC. Athenagoras mentions Theodoros and Telekles and several other Archaic artists to show that the creation of images of the gods goes right back to the beginning of figurative art. ó AiļXios Kai r) "ApTefiiç TeKTaiou Kai 'AyyeXiœvoç Te'vT' : Tektaios and Angelion were trained in the school of Dipoinos and Skyllis, and one of their pupils was Kallon of Aegina, according to Pausanias.1796 Dipoinos and Skyllis were probably active around the first quarter of the 6th century BC while Kallon of Aegina is known to have been active in the last quarter. Therefore, Tektaios and Angelion should probably be placed in the second and third quarters of the 6th century BC.1797 The Delian Apollo was famous as a colossal, golden image of the god. He was shown naked, apart from a belt at his waist. He stood with a bow in his left hand and a statuary representation of the Three Graces in his right. The figure was perhaps as much as 5m tall and it had enough gold on it to allow for some to be melted down in the 3rd century BC without ruining the sculpture, which continued to be an object of veneration for many years. An image of the statue was used to adorn the Athenian 1796 Pausanias, 11.32. 5. 1797 See Romano (1984) 174-75 and notes concerning the literary evidence for the dates of these artists.</page><page sequence="64">GREEK SOURCES 715 "New-Style" silver tetradrachms.1798 The Archaic Delian Artemis mentioned by Athenagoras is less well known, though it may have been a seated, wooden image of the goddess.1799 Tļ 8è €v Zdļiū) "Hpa Kal év "Apyei Z|ilXlôoç : The evidence for an Archaic sculptor named Smilis, or possibly Škelmis, is confused and weak.1800 The oldest cult image of Hera in Samos was probably a small wooden xoanon of anthropomorphic appearance which could be adorned with clothes and accessories.1801 The old Argive Hera was a xoanon of wild pearwood. It was a small, seated image and, when Pausanias saw it (II. 17.4), it was placed on top of a pillar or column in the temple of Hera, next to the chryselephantine image made by Polykleitos.

'ETĆpa, it seems, must apply to the word 'Aphrodite', but this could imply one of two things: that the author was thinking either of another Aphrodite by Praxiteles, or, as Corso1803 suggests, of an Aphrodite by Pheidias, whom he has just mentioned. According to Corso, this could be an allusion to the Aphrodite Ourania of Pheidias situated near the Stoa Poikile, which would have been very close to the place where the speech was being delivered, most likely the Athenian Agora.1804 ó e v 'Emôaúpq) 'AaKXrimòç ëpyov OeiÔiou : The attribution of the chryselephantine statue of Asklepios in Epidauros to Pheidias must be a mistake, since its artist is known to have been Thrasymedes of Paros. The error is found repeated in the later Codex Vaticanus Graecus 989, listing thirty wonders of the ancient world. The author of this list perhaps consulted Athenagoras and thus perpetuated the error. In the late 4th century AD, Libanios too speaks of an Asklepios by Pheidias, but this work was apparently a bronze in Beroia (in Macedón), according to the author.1805 Again, this would seem to be a mistake as no other sources mention such a statue. Perhaps the mistake springs from a misreading of Pausanias, 1798 Concerning the Delian Apollo, see Romano (1984) 162ff. 1799 See Romano (1984) 197ff. 1800 See Valmin (1955) 34f. and Romano (1984) 252-55. 1801 Romano (1984) 250-71. 1802 See Corso (1988) 62 n. 172. 1803 Corso (1990) 13. 1804 Pausanias, 1.14.7, mentions this statue. 1805 Libanios, Or. 30.22.</page><page sequence="65">7 1 6 WRITTEN SOURCES V.l 1.10, in which Pausanias is talking about the pools in front of the great chryselephantine statues of Pheidias which he believed were intended to maintain the correct level of moisture in the air to protect the ivory of the statues. Oil apparently filled the pool in front of the Zeus at Olympia, while water was in the pool set before the Athena Parthenos. Pausanias notes that in front of the Asklepios at Epidauros there was no pool at all, and comments that when he asked the sanctuary attendants why not, they replied - erroneously - that there was no need since the statue was set over a well. To an ill-informed reader, it may appear that Pausanias is talking about yet another work by Pheidias when he brings in the Asklepios at Epidauros, but the temple at Epidauros and its cult statue of the god were not constructed until around 380-370 BC.

For the inscription suggests that the statuette once carried upon the base was an ivory copy of an Eros at Athens made by Pheidias.1807 The 'Soranzo' Eros type, which goes back at least to the 440 's BC, is thought by some to reflect Pheidias's original statue.

We hear that when Pheidias was appointed to make the Zeus at Olympia, he created the likeness of the god according to the Homeric image of Zeus, not according to a human idea; and now the person who looks at the Zeus of Pheidias grasps in thought the god of Homer, nodding with his dark brows and shaking his locks this way and that.

In the 5th and 4th centuries, the image was referred to in the terms usually applied to cult statues, namely ayaXfia, éôoç, ßpeTas, or 0€Óç, like the Athena Parthenos. Nick suggests that, as in other Greek sanctuaries, the principal deity, in this case the state goddess Athena, was honoured with more than one cult image: the ancient wooden xoanon and Pheidias' s image, which replaced an earlier, lost statue of a warlike Athena.1817 Thus the name 'Polias' was originally applied more to the deity than to any individual image of the deity.

For, as far as he was concerned, it was not Zeus who was beautiful, but his lover. Praxiteles on the other hand, as Posidippos clearly shows in his book on Knidos, made the statue of the Knidian Aphrodite in the image of his lover Kratine, so that the wretched people had to worship Praxiteles' s lover. But when Phryne, the hetaira of Thespiai, was in the flower of her beauty, all the painters represented Aphrodite with the beauty of Phryne, just as the sculptors in Athens used to portray their Hermes in the likeness of Alkibiades.

The anecdote, which is all it is anyway, is most often applied to the Zeus at Olympia, and there is no reason to think that another statue would be more appropriate as its subject. 1824 Corso (1990) 30. 1825 por farther comments about Arethas see scholion to Clemens, Protrep.

(1972) Clemens Alexandrinus , Vol. I, 313. Protrepticus und Paidagogus. Berlin: Akademie © W. de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co. Date : This note was written by Arethas, around AD 914. It is one of four scholia on this work written by Arethas, which reveal his interest in artists and works of art of Classical Greece. It is apparent from his comments that Arethas had a knowledge of writers of late antiquity, such as Libanios and Gregorios Nazianzenos, and that he drew on them for information about subjects of which he could not have experience at first hand. The other scholia are on Protrep. IV. 53.4, again about Pheidias; Protrep. IV.51, about Apelles; Protrep. 1.2, about the bronze statue at Delphi of Eunomos. tt|v ripa^iTeXouç épü)|iévT1v : Arethas is here commenting on the passage in Clemens where he tells of the report by Posidippos of Knidos that Praxiteles had made the Aphrodite of Knidos to look like the hetaira, Kratine, whom he loved. eis tò Opwris Tfjs ¿Tai pag e'iôoç, €po)|ievTis ai&gt;T(o, tt|v ' AcķpoSiTTļv ôiay'iji|;ai : Seeking to give another similar example of an artist modelling a statue of Aphrodite on the artist's lover, Arethas says that Pheidias made his Aphrodite like his lover, the hetaira Phryne. There is clearly quite a web of confusion here, but some interesting points can be gleaned from the passage. Phryne was not Pheidias's lover, but another hetaira associated with Praxiteles. She was supposed to be the subject of his Aphrodite at Thespiai, as well as of his Knidian Aphrodite. Pheidias probably made at least two statues of Aphrodite: there was the chryselephantine Aphrodite Ourania at Elis and the Aphrodite Ourania of Parian marble at Athens.1828 Arethas had deduced, again wrongly, from a note in Libanios, the existence of an Aphrodite by Pheidias on which the artist had avowed his love for someone.1829 Perhaps this sparked the confusion, which was then compounded by other facts. Immediately after talking about Phryne, Clemens goes on to talk of Alkibiades, so perhaps Arethas thought that they were contemporaries and therefore contemporaries of Pheidias. Secondly, Pheidias and Praxiteles are often mentioned together in the ancient sources, as the best Classical sculptors, and in Byzantine times Pheidias tended to be 1828 Concerning these works, see Pausanias,VI.25.1 and 1.14.7. 1829 See scholion to Clemens, Protrep.

Eustathios had a wide Classical knowledge and was well travelled in many of the places mentioned in the list. The list points to a revival in interest in Classical art. After many centuries first of hatred for pagan religion and the works of art it inspired, and then lack of interest in all things ancient, the 10th century witnessed the beginning of a new appreciation for Greece and its ancient culture, an appreciation which grew over the following period. ó ev 'OXu[iTTÍa Zevs : The first statue mentioned in the list is, appropriately, the most famous statue by the ancient world's most famous artist.1833 Of the five statues mentioned in this first group, three are often found mentioned in the ancient sources as paradigms of beautiful statues: these are the Zeus by Pheidias, the Hera by Polykleitos and the Aphrodite of Knidos by Praxiteles.1834 Pheidias is often mentioned in the sources with either Polykleitos, his contemporary in the high Classical period, or Praxiteles, the great name of the late Classical period, or with both of them.

The Parthenon temple was on the Akropolis, housing the statue of the goddess Athena Parthenos which the sculptor Pheidias made out of gold and ivory. For there were three statues of Athena on the Akropolis, in different places: one, which existed from the beginning, was made of olive wood and called Athena Polias because the city belonged to her; the second was made entirely of bronze and they created it when they were victorious 1846 Pollitt (1974) 196-98.</page><page sequence="83">734 WRITTEN SOURCES at Marathon (it was called the Athena Promachos); the third they made of gold and ivory, for they became richer after the victory at Salamis, as the victory was greater.

Tpia yap ayaX|iaTa f|v Lv Trj aKpoTTÓXei Tfjç'A0T1vâç : Compare the scholia to Aristides, Or. 1.354, which both state that there were three statues of Athena on the Athenian Akroplis, even though one of the scholiasts goes on to specify only two statues. Compare also Aristides, Or. 34.28, where he lists the Parthenos, the bronze Athena and the Lemnia, as the three statues of Athena on the Akropolis by Pheidias. Athena Polias : The scholiast is here referring to the highly venerated and ancient wooden xoanon, which had been saved from the Persian sack of the Akropolis in the early 5th century BC, and which was at the centre of a number of important Athenian rituals. It probably originated in the early 8th century BC and in the Classical period it was generally known simply as eôoç, ßpeTas, 0eóç or ayaX|ia. The name 'Polias' does not seem to have been applied specifically to this image until later. Athena Promachos : This reference is the first known use of the name 'Promachos' for the great bronze statue by Pheidias. Pausanias in the 2nd century AD simply calls it the 'bronze' statue, as does Aristides.1847 Demosthenes, in the 4th century BC, who seems to be the earliest source for this work, also describes it as the 'great bronze Athena', rf'v Xa'Kfļv tt)v jieyaXrii/ AOrļvāv.1848 As in other references, it is distinguished as being the statue commissioned by the Athenians as a memorial of their victory over the Persians. The title 'Promachos' is applied to Athena in various writings; see for instance, Alkiphron and an inscription composed by Apronian.1849 Athena Parthenos : The Athena Parthenos is discussed in the notes to Pausanias, I.24.5ff. 1847 Pausanias, 1.28.2 (see this passage concerning the type) and IX.4.1; Aristides, Or. 34.28; see also the scholia to Aristides, Or. 1.354. 1848 Demosthenes, De Falsa Leg. 272. 1849 Alkiphron, Ep.

In the singular, aKpojTTļpiov generally refers to the topmost or prominent or projecting part of something and in the plural the word can mean the extremities of the body, the hands and fingers, the feet and toes. It is clear from the accounts of the Parthenon treasures that both the Nike and the Athena herself suffered losses from quite early on, not much more than a generation after the completion of the masterpiece. The Nike lost part of her golden crown around 400 BC.1850 There also seem to have been losses to the base of the statue, though these were probably valuable offerings placed on the base rather than parts of the base 1850 Donnay (1968b) 22-24.

In IG II2, 1388, lines 40-42, for example, the golden aTÉ(1&gt;avoç of the Nike is very carefully specified, along with a number of other crowns.1852 Furthermore, in line 23 of the same inscription another object listed is something called the aKptoTTļpiov xpwJiôv ottl(t0iov (a 'golden akroterion from the hind part'). This use of the word has suggested that the objects in question were the wings of the Nike and the interpretation is generally accepted.1853 But no other source mentions the theft of the wings of Nike, and it must be admitted that they seem an unlikely target for a thief considering their size, which was probably over a metre in length. Furthermore, they may have been made of gilded bronze rather than pure gold. It remains possible that a smaller and more valuable part of the statue, such as the fingers or even the toes, which would have been more accessible to a thief, are meant by Demosthenes. Although they do not describe her in any detail, Pausanias and Pliny both give the Nike a brief mention.1854 DEMOSTHENES, Contra Timocratem (24), 136.

It is said that the owl is dear also to Athena, the most beautiful and the wisest of the gods, and it was honoured in Athens by the art of Pheidias no less; he did not find the owl unworthy to share a dedication with the goddess, and the people were in agreement. But he represented Perikles and himself covertly, so they say, on the shield. Greek text : Russell, D. A. (1992) Dio Chrysostom. Orations VII , XII and XXXVI. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Date : AD 97. to õpveov : Since Dio is clearly talking about the shield of the Athena Parthenos in the second part of this passage, it has been thought possible that he is referring in the first part to an owl that was included in the original composition of the same statue. Several minor reflections of the Parthenos include an owl, and, as this bird is regularly associated with the goddess in Classical times, its presence somewhere in the composition of the Athena Parthenos would not be surprising. On a gold medallion from South Russia, now in the Hermitage Museum, (Fig. 6.1), and on a terracotta medallion in the Royal Ontario Museum 1862 See scholion Demosthenes, C. Androt. 13. For notes about this statue see Pausanias, 1.28.2, lines 1-9. 1863 por which see Pausanias, 1.24.5-7.</page><page sequence="90">GREEK SOURCES 741 (Acc. no. 962.263), the owl is shown perched on a cheek piece of the goddess's helmet. There is also a statuette of the Athena Parthenos which has the owl standing on the statue base.1864 From Dio's comment, one can infer no more than that the owl was placed somewhere on the Akropolis, and without stronger evidence it would be foolish to conclude that the owl he mentions was in the Parthenon and, more precisely still, a part of the Parthenos composition. No other author, including Pausanias, makes any mention of an owl in his description of the Parthenos. The only written sources other than Dio that mention an owl on the Akropolis are the very late writers Hesychios, Lex. y'av£, and Ausonius, Mos. 308-10. The link with Pheidias in Hesychios's text may not amount to more than a wishful emendation: Latte prefers the reading 'Phaidros' for the name of the dedicator. More interesting is the reference in Ausonius, just mentioned. He tells of an owl made by Iktinos, the architect of the Parthenon, which was covered in a special paint and which was used to attract all manner of birds and to kill them 'by its stare'. One may infer from Ausonius that the owl of which he speaks must have stood out of doors and served the purpose of keeping birds away from the holy monuments, so that they would not foul them. Indeed Athenian coins of the Roman period that depict the Akropolis show that this 'apotropaic' owl stood on the north-eastern or eastern part of the Akropolis, near the peripheral wall.1865 It is possible that Dio is not relating the owl he mentions to Pheidias 's Athena at all, but that he is referring to the 'apotropaic' owl of the Akropolis, which he claims is by Pheidias, though Ausonius attributes it to Pheidias's colleague, the architect, Iktinos.1866 riepiKXéa 8è Kal aírròv XaGùv eTToirļaev, ws cķaaiv, ém rf's cujttlôoç : For the widely repeated story that the outer surface of the shield of the Athena Parthenos, which was adorned with an Amazonomachy, included likenesses of Perikles and Pheidias, see Plutarch, Per. 3 1 and notes.

Three sources of man's understanding of the divine being have now been set out: the innate, that given by the poets, and that given by the law-givers. Let us call the fourth the one that comes from the plastic arts and the craftmanship of those who make statues and images of the gods, I mean painters and statuaries and stone-carvers and, in short, everyone who has deemed himself worthy to come forward as an imitator, through his art, of the divine nature: whether by shaded drawing, which is weak and visually deceptive, or by the mixing of colours and by line-drawing, which secures perhaps the most accurate results, or by stone-carving, or by wood-carving - the skill of removing, little by little, the excessive material, until the observable image itself is all that is left - or by the casting of bronze and other precious metals, which are heated in the fire and either beaten or poured into various moulds, or by the modelling of wax, a material which easily follows the artistic plan and allows the greatest room for a change of idea. Such artists were Pheidias and Alkamenes and Polykleitos, as well as Aglaophon and Polygnotos and Zeuxis and, before these, Daidalos. For it was not sufficient for these artists to demonstrate their cleverness and wisdom on other subjects, but by portraying all sorts of images and likenesses of gods, and taking cities as their patrons, both private individuals and states, they filled them with an idea concerning the divine nature that was ample and intricate.

He then lists six different techniques, of which the first two are graphic and the next four are sculptural.</page><page sequence="93">744 WRITTEN SOURCES Within each group he seems to progress from the least realistic to the most pliable art form. The techniques are as follows: 1 . Shaded drawing. 2. Outline drawing with colour. 3. Sculpture in stone. 4. Sculpture in wood. 5. Sculpture in metal. 6. Sculpture in wax. The arts of sculpture in stone and wood are seen to be related in that they are both essentially 'glyptic' in technique: a hard block of material has to be cut away in order to arrive at the desired shape. The last two categories, it would seem, both deal with sculpture in metal, the difference between the two being that, in the first case, Dio includes the techniques of beating metal into shape and casting solid metal objects in moulds, while in the second he is referring to hollow cast metal objects made from a modelled core (the wax was used to shape the outer surface of the object with great precision and detail). Casting differs from the glyptic sculpture described above in that its starting point is a 'plastic' material, such as clay or wax, which is modelled into the shape required. oloç f|v Oeiôiaç ktX. : After enumerating the various artistic techniques, Dio lists here some of the most prominent Greek sculptors and painters, as examples of artists who by their portrayal of the gods helped to shape men's acquired notions of the divine nature. Quintilian goes so far as to say that Pheidias even added a new dimension to traditional beliefs by his sculptural works.1871 Russell calls the list of names "a classicizing, if not archaizing, selection".1872 Alkamenes : For notes on this Athenian artist, a pupil of Pheidias, see Pausanias, V.10.8; and Pliny, NH 34.49 and 36.15-19.

Zeuxis : Painter of the late 5th-early 4th century BC. He came from Heraclea in Lucania. According to Pliny, his floruit was 397 BC, but Quintilian dates him earlier, in the Peloponnesian War period.

For if someone should first call Pheidias to account before the Greeks - that wise man and godlike artist of the majestic creation, which is beautiful in every aspect - and should appoint as judges those who are directing the contest in honour of the god or better still a common court of justice of all Peloponnesians, as well as Boeotians, Ionians, and other Hellenes from all over Europe and Asia, and suppose they should request an account not of the money or of the expenditure made on the statue, of how many talents were spent on gold and ivory as well as for the cypress and thyine wood, used for the interior structure, which are lasting and imperishable materials, or of the amount spent on the upkeep and wages of the considerable number of workmen involved over a fairly long period - both the main workforce, who were not insignificant craftsmen, and Pheidias, who was paid the greatest and fullest wage because of his artistic skill; and it was fitting that the Eleians, who spent their money ungrudgingly and magnificently, should have calculated these costs. We shall state, however, that Pheidias must submit to trial for something different. So if someone should say to him, Oh best and most excellent of artists, that you have created such a lovely and delightful sight, an irresistible pleasure for the eyes of all Greeks and foreigners who have come here, as they have come in great numbers and so many times, is a fact no one will deny.

These expenses would have dominated the accounts of both the Athena Parthenos and the Zeus at Olympia. tòv dochov toötov Kai 8ai|ióviov epydTT|y toö (renvoi) Kai TTayKaXoi; ÔT1|iLoupyT1^aToç : For the high opinion held by many ancient writers of Pheidias's skills, see for instance Cicero, Or. 2.8-9 and notes. Xpucròç . . . éXé(1&gt;aç . . . KuuctpiTTOs . . . 0i3ov : These are some of the costly materials used to construct the statue. Pausanias, V. 11.1-10, reports that Pheidias also used ebony, precious stones, and a variety of precious metals other than gold for certain parts of the decorations. The high quality woods were used for the internal framework and the fully shaped core of the statue which carried the plates of ivory that formed the flesh parts as well as the golden drapery of the figure. Concerning the inner structures of chryselephantine works, see Lucian's humorously disparaging remarks and Pausanias's description of the uncompleted Zeus of Megara.1875 Vast sums of money were needed to create such a work as the Zeus at Olympia, which was somewhat larger than the Athena Parthenos, but it is doubtful that the Olympian statue had as much gold on it as the comparable Athena Parthenos. The accounts of the Athena Parthenos have survived in fragments.1876 Several sources mention the amount of gold revetment on the statue and, although they do not agree exactly about the amount, they indicate that it was of the order of about forty-four talents.1877 This constituted part of the Athenian state gold reserve. Pausanias, V.10.2, records that the Zeus at Olympia was paid for by the Eleians alone, out of the spoils from the Eleian conquest of Pisa and neighbouring districts. If this is the case, then a somewhat cheaper alternative to the use of solid plates of gold might have had to be found in order to furnish the statue with its massive golden mantle.1878 Using the evidence 1873 For the fanciful idea that the Eleians brought Pheidias to trial over the accounts of the Zeus at Olympia, see the scholia to Aristophanes, Pax , 605-06. 1874 See Plutarch, Per. 31; Diodorus Siculus, Bib. Hist, XII.39.1-5; Aristodemos, FgrH , 104.16.1-2; and Aristophanes, Pax , 605-06. 1875 Lucian, Gall. 24 and Jup.

The project would have necessitated quite a considerable workforce and, as Dio hints, some of Pheidias's assistants were no mean artists in their own right. Pliny says that one of his assistants was the sculptor Kolotes, a specialist in chryselephantine statues and a pupil of Pheidias.1880 Pausanias says that Pheidias's relative Panainos, the famous painter, was also involved in the work.1881 He decorated with paintings the barriers near the throne of the Zeus as well as helping to colour the cloak of Zeus.

The speech is carefully constructed, and it can be summarized as follows: 1. The importance of the issue (§ 55). 2. Pheidias was not the first to represent Zeus anthropomorphically (§56-57). 3. The human form alone can represent intelligence to human beings (§58-59). 4. Contemplation of the heavens is not sufficient: we want to stretch our hands out to a Father (§ 60-61). 5. Homer himself used anthropomorphic images of the gods (§ 62-63). 6. As a poet, Homer had the advantage that he could employ literary techniques to create his picture (§ 64-69). 7. But Pheidias was limited by his materials and by the difficulty of remembering his model for so long (§ 70-72). 8. Homer's god is fickle while Pheidias's god is Father and Protector of all (§ 73-74). 9. Pheidias's god suits his traditional epithets (§ 75-77). 10. Pheidias could not have portrayed the god of storm and strife even if he had wanted to, not because of any fault relating to his materials, but because Zeus himself is the greatest craftsman of all (§ 80-83). Poetry is praised above sculpture and yet Homer's image of Zeus is found wanting, in comparison with that of Pheidias, in that it shows the god as changeable, vindictive, fickle - a much less worthy figure than the one Pheidias conjures up. oíjôè ayXwTTOu TTÓXewç : Pheidias, son of Charmides, came from Athens.1888 auvT10r|ç Kai eTaîpoç IlepiKXeouç : The artist's friendship with Perikles is mentioned by Plutarch.1889 DIO CHRYSOSTOMOS, Oratio XII.56-57.

But our god is peaceful and gentle in every way, such as could be guardian of a Hellas that is free from strife and that is of common accord. With my art and with the advice of the wise and good city of the Eleians, this is the god which I have set up - a mild and majestic figure in a pleasing form, the one who gives us life and sustenance and all good things, the common father and saviour and guardian of the human race - this I have done, in so far as it was possible for a mortal to imagine and imitate the divine and inexplicable nature. Now consider whether or not you find that the statue fits all the epithets of the god; for Zeus alone of the gods is called Father and King, as well as Guardian of the City, God of friendship, God of Fellowship, and in addition to these he has the titles Protector of Suppliants, God of Hospitality, Giver of Increase and countless others. . . In so far as it was possible to illustrate these qualities without recourse to words, is he not sufficiently represented according to the conventions of the art? For the power of the image and its magnificence are intended to illustrate his rule and kingship; its gentleness and loving nature, his role as father and protector; its dignity and austerity, his role as Protector of Cities and Defender of the Law; while the very similarity in the shape illustrates the family ties between men and gods; and the loving nature and gentleness and kindness make plain Zeus god of Friendship, Suppliants, Hospitality, Refugees, and, quite simply, all related roles. Then the simplicity and the nobility apparent in the figure represent the God of Wealth and the Giver of Fruit; for the god really does look like one who is giving and freely offering good things. These then are the qualities which I have rendered in so far as it was possible to do so without being able to name them. Greek text : Russell, D. A. (1992) Dio Chrysostom.

For he built some sort of lodge on the Capitoline, so that, as he put it, he might reside with Zeus. But he deemed it unworthy of himself to take second place in this sharing arrangement, and he blamed Zeus for occupying the Capitoline before him, so he quickly built a second temple on the Palatine, wanting to move the statue of Olympian Zeus to it, once it had been remodelled to look like him. He was, however, not able to carry out his intentions, for the ship which had been built to transport the statue was destroyed by thunderbolts, and, in addition, each time someone came forward as if to grasp the pedestal, great laughter could be heard in the distance. So, uttering threats against this statue, he set up another statue of himself. Greek text : Dindorf, L. (1865) Dionis Cassii Cocceiani. Historia Romana , Vol. V, 170. Leipzig: Teubner.

Dio and Suetonius provide the main evidence for the existence of an official cult of the Emperor in Rome. There is no epigraphic or numismatic evidence to support the idea.

Pheidias was working on the statue of Athena, and it was Perikles, son of Xanthippos, who had been chosen as overseer. Some of the men working with Pheidias quarrelled with him, pushed by the enemies of Perikles, and they went and sat on the Altar of the Gods; when they were summoned to court because of this unexpected behaviour, they said they could prove that Pheidias was withholding large amounts of sacred funds, and that the overseer, Perikles, knew about this and was collaborating with him. When the assembly met to discuss this matter, the enemies of Perikles persuaded the people to arrest Pheidias and to accuse Perikles himself of the theft of sacred property. In addition to this, they falsely accused Anaxagoras, the sophist, who was Perikles' s teacher, of impiety against the gods; and they involved Perikles in their charges and false accusations, being eager, in their jealousy, to slander both the supremacy and the reputation of the man. But Perikles knew that while people admire noble men in the affairs of war because of pressing necessity, in peace time they denounce those same men because they have the leisure to do so and because they are jealous, so he judged that it was in his interest to cast the city into a great war, so that it would have need of Perikles' s excellence and leadership and would not take heed of the attacks directed against him, nor would it have the leisure and the time to examine carefully the accounts of the funds spent. There was a decree voted by the Athenians that barred the Megarians from the Agora and the harbours, and the Megarians ran for help to the Lakedaimonians. The Lakedaimonians were persuaded by the Megarians to send envoys very openly, according to the resolution voted by their joint council, ordering the Athenians to revoke the decree against the Megarians, and, if they did not agree to do so, threatening to go to war with them, along with their allies. And so the assembly came together to discuss these matters, and Perikles, who far exceeded all the citizens in his ability to speak, persuaded the Athenians not to revoke the decree, saying that it was the beginning of slavery to obey the injunctions of the Lakedaimonians against their own interest. Therefore, he advised them to bring into the city the goods from the countryside and, since they ruled the sea, to go to war with the Lakedaimonians. Greek text : Casevitz, M.

Plutarch states that Pheidias also had a more extended responsibility for the entire Parthenon project, being the èmcjKOTTos, though it is not clear exactly what this meant in practice.1895 nepiKXfjs 8è ó 5av0LTTTTou KaGecjTaiiévoç r'v eTTi|ieXriTT1ç : Perikles was one of the driving forces behind the programme of construction on the Akropolis in the mid-fifth century BC. He was also an official émoTctTris, one of the inspectors of the works and therefore responsible for their satisfactory completion. Diodorus suggests that the enemies of Perikles orchestrated an attack on Pheidias, accusing him of dishonest appropriation of funds, in an attempt to attack Perikles himself, on the grounds that, as eTTiaTaTiļs, he either acted as an accomplice to the crimes of Pheidias, or he was negligent in his duties. Diodorus says that his source is the 4th-century BC historian Ephoros. The story is repeated in less detail and with minor alterations by Aristodemos.1896 Elements of the story are also to be found in Plutarch, Per. 31, though he adds further anecdotes that are not to be found in Diodorus and Aristodemos and probably do not come from Ephoros. A similar tale is outlined by Aristophanes, in Pax , 605 ff., and his words are commented upon by two scholiasts. To judge from the accounts of Diodorus and Aristodemos, it seems that Ephoros saw the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War as directly linked to Perikles and his personal problems. This agrees with Aristophanes, though Ephoros was probably not drawing on Aristophanes as his source. Aristophanes 's account in Pax is too sketchy to be of much use to any historian attempting to reconstruct the story, but Diodorus and Aristodemos both quote Pax , 605ff, as supplementary backing for their version of the story.

If the accused had escaped before his case was judged by the tribunal, then he was sentenced in absentia. After relating that the accusation of Pheidias was brought before the assembly and that Pheidias was arrested, Diodorus says nothing more about what happened to the artist but concentrates his attention on Perikles.

Pheidias is also put in first place because he is regarded as the greater of the two artists and because he was most famed for works in the richer materials. In the Augustan era there was renewed admiration for the works of the Classical period; the austere and unsentimental portrayal of the gods was in tune with religious feelings of the time, and Classical art gained popularity over works of the Hellenistic period.

They say that he (Stilpo) once used the following argument concerning the Athena of Pheidias, "Isn't Athena, the daughter of Zeus, a god?" When the man replied, "Yes" he said, "But this one at least is not of Zeus, but of Pheidias." When the man agreed, he said, "This then is not a god". For this he was called before the Areopagus. He did not deny the charge, alleging that he had argued correctly, for she was not a god, but a goddess; for gods are male. Nevertheless, the Areopagites ordered him to leave the city immediately.

The argument put forward here by Stilpo plays on a confusion between the image of the goddess Athena and the goddess herself. As Stewart remarks, it is noteworthy that Stilpo 's comments were, reportedly, interpreted as a criticism of the goddess and that they led to the expulsion of Stilpo from Athens.1917 It provides evidence that the image of the Athena Parthenos was held in great reverence in the 4th century BC. apa ye r| toO Aiòç 'A0r)vâ 0eóç éan; : From the High Classical period the term 0eóç was employed to refer to statues of gods, generally cult statues.1918 1916 For which see Pausanias, I.24.5ff. and Volume 1, chapter 6. 1917 Stewart (1998) 271-73. 1918 See Nick (2002) 16-18; 214, Test. 20.</page><page sequence="115">766 WRITTEN SOURCES DIONYSIOS of Halicarnassus, De Demos thenis Dictione, V.50.4, (Reiske, 1108). 0:828. oi) yàp ôf| TTXácFTai [lèv Kal £ü)ypác|)ü)v TTalôeç, ei ļirļ ttoXXt|v €|iTTeipíav Xaßoiev, Xpóvo) Tpi^avTes Taç ópáaeiç p.aKpw TTepl Tas tov àpxaíwv ÔTifiioupywv Téxvaç, ovk àv euTTeTÛç auTaç ôiayvoiev Kat oiik äv e'oiev eiTTetv ßeßaiwg ôti [ttí TTapaXaßovTeg] tovtì |iév écm IloXuKXeÍTOu tò è'pyov, toutl ôè Oeiôiou, toutí ôè 'AXKap.6youç* Kai twv ypacjxíiy lloXuyycoTou |ièv aÍTT], TifiávGouç ôè eKeívi], avrr' ôè nappaaíou.

He says that one must first learn to recognize its 'melody' (r| é|ip.éXeia), and this takes long practice. Polykleitos, Pheidias, Alkamenes : Three of the greatest sculptors of Classical Greece, whose works the Romans particularly appreciated in the period of Augustus and the so- called neo-Classical period.

Polygnotos, Timanthes, Parrhasios : Three great painters, to match the sculptors mentioned before. Polygnotos of Thasos flourished around 475-447 BC; Timanthes of Cynthos flourished in the late 5th century BC; Parrhasios, who also wrote on painting, lived in the early 4th century BC. 1919 Concerning the date of the work, see Aujac, Vol. I of the Budé edition (1978) 22-28.</page><page sequence="116">GREEK SOURCES 767 DIONYSIOS of Halicarnassus, De Dinarcho, XII.7.7.

This is true in any art, he thinks, whether it be oratory or sculpture or painting. Apelles : The 4th-century painter, whom Pliny dates around 332 BC. TrXdoTai Ta FIoXuKXeÍTou : Polykleitos is classed as a uXaoTi^ç, one who models or moulds, because he was most famous as a sculptor in bronze, a technique involving the modelling of an image first in clay and wax. yXu(ļ)6Ls Ta Oeiôiou : Dionysios distinguishes Pheidias from Polykleitos by classing him as a carver. This description would apply equally well to someone who worked primarily in stone or wood. The evidence for Pheidias as a marble worker, first and foremost, is not strong, so the term makes more sense as a reference to Pheidias as the greatest known producer of chryselephantine works.

The idea that Pheidias represents one of the most perfect artists, and that the qualities of elevation and grandeur that can be found in his works are most perfectly matched in the writings of rhetoricians beginning with Isokrates, represents a fusion of the 'phantasia' theory of art with rhetorical criticism. The 'phantasia' theory1920 seems to have developed in the late Hellenistic period and the basic idea is that art started simply as imitation of visible reality, but developed from that into intuitive apprehension of the nature of the gods, their grandeur, beauty, and other qualities, and the ability to express something of this nature to others through works of art. The theory finds expression chiefly in the writings of the rhetoricians.1921 This has led to the supposition that the idea of comparing orators and sculptors may have come from a particular work on oratorical styles.1922 For a discussion of the terms used to describe the art of Pheidias and Polykleitos, in the context of ancient art criticism, see Pollitt. 1923 Pheidias's most famous works were his representations of the gods, in particular his colossal chryselephantine works, the Athena Parthenos and the Zeus at Olympia.1924 Polykleitos, his contemporary, worked less on statues of the gods, though he was renowned for his chryselephantine Hera at Argos, which was very highly regarded by many.1925 Lysias . . .

Those who do not have the same skills as Apelles, Zeuxis, Protogenes, and the other reputed painters, have not been prevented from judging their talents, and the same goes for less skilful artists judging the sculptures of Pheidias, Polykleitos, and Myron. For I need not say that the layman is as good a judge of many works as the expert. Greek text : Aujac, G. (1991) Denys ďHalicarnasse. Opuscules rhétoriques. Vol. IV. CUF. Budé ed.

That the judgements of ordinary people might have mattered to some of the great artists is reflected in an apocryphal story which is told of Pheidias and, in a similar form, of Apelles. Lucian says that when the Zeus at Olympia was finished, Pheidias would hide near it so that he could listen to the comments of those who came to see the masterpiece and then, when the people had gone, he would alter those parts which had been criticized to suit the tastes of the majority.1927 Aujac observes that writers in the Augustan period were very fond of drawing comparisons between different art forms, especially literature and painting, sculpture, architecture or music, and she cites Strabo, 1.1.23 as a further example.1928 1926 Pausanias, IX. 16.1 and IX.22.1. 1927 Lucian, Pro Imag. 14.

For not only have they cared about the beauty and the comeliness of their statues, and how they might be magnificently and extraordinarily beautiful, but also they take precautions, insofar as they are able, for the immortality of their creations, to keep them safe and undamaged for ages long. So, for instance, Pheidias. For after he completed the Pisan image (which was made of ivory), he ordered that oil be poured out around the feet in front of the statue, to keep it immortal by its power. So, therefore, if makers of hand-produced works act thus, did not then God, the master-craftsman - who is able to make all things even out of nothing - did not he necessarily create the reasoning image of himself, that is, man, to be absolutely indestructible and immortal?

The oil may have been poured on to the wooden framework, to keep that in good condition. The resulting pool of oil in front of the statue may have had the secondary purpose of providing a reflective surface for the statue. This would have added to the artistic effect of the composition, without resorting to the use of water, which would have made a damp place even damper.1929 1929Pausanias, V. 1 1 . 1 0 and notes.</page><page sequence="120">GREEK SOURCES 771 EUNAPIOS, Vitae Sophistarum, XVII.497.

And so Libanios wrote an essay on cleverness, dealing completely with Akakios, in which it is clear that he blames his defeat by Akakios on the greatness of that man's natural abilities, though he also gives evidence in his own favour with regard to his attitude and precision concerning the use of learned words; as if he was unaware that neither Homer cared about every foot of his verses at the expense of a certain beauty of expression and melodiousness, nor Pheidias cared about displaying the finger and the boy to gain praise for his goddess, but that they exercised tyrannical power the one over our sense of hearing, the other over our sight, and that the cause of their supremacy is impossible to find or difficult to determine, just as in beautiful and beloved bodies not everyone admires the same features and the person who is captivated does not know what it was that captivated him. Greek text : Giangrande, G. (1956) Eunapii Vitae Sophistarum. Rome: Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato. Date : Written about AD 396. ļiTļT€ 'Oļirļpo) . . . [iTļT€ Oeiôiq : Pheidias is put on a par with Homer; each one is considered to be the finest in his own medium. The point Eunapios is making is that the outstanding beauty of their works cannot be defined solely in terms of the excellence of every individual detail of a given work, no matter how impressive these may be. One might compare this passage with Pliny, NH 36.18-19. Pliny tries to give his readers a taste of Pheidias 's genius and he does this not by attempting to describe the obvious magnificence of the colossal chryselephantine masterpieces, but by drawing attention to the smaller details of one of these works, the Athena Parthenos, and demonstrating that even in these details Pheidias aimed at perfection. tòv TTatôa : In the first important edition of this work dating from 1568, H. Junius conjectured that TTatôa should be corrected to TTÓÔa, as if Eunapios, following Libanios, was drawing attention to two small parts of a single important statue: the finger and the foot. But Forster (in his edition of Libanios) and Giangrande maintain the reading TTatôa and interpret this as a reference to Pantarkes, the Eleian youth who was supposed to have been Pheidias 's lover. If this is correct, then the reference to a goddess by Pheidias, her finger and 'a boy' would seem to suggest that the name of the boy appeared inscribed on a</page><page sequence="121">772 WRITTEN SOURCES finger of one of Pheidias's goddess statues. The more usual story, which is found in several late sources, is that the name of Pantarkes was inscribed on the finger of the Zeus at Olympia.1930 But, in his notes on Protrep. IV.53.4-6, by Clemens Alexandrinus, Arethas comments that the words 'Pantarkes is beautiful' appeared on Pheidias's Aphrodite, according to Libanios, and on his Athena Parthenos, according to Gregorios Nazianzenos. The passage by Gregorios to which Arethas is alluding is Carm. 742. The passage by Libanios does not survive, unless perhaps it is preserved, indirectly, in this piece by Eunapios.1931 If so, then Arethas is saying more than his source permits, for Eunapios does not specify which Pheidian goddess is meant. There is no other source to corroborate Arethas 's statement. TT1Ç Geâç : Pheidias's most famous rendering of a female deity was the Athena Parthenos and it is perhaps to this statue that 'the goddess' refers. From the fifth century the term was used to designate cult statues.

For Pheidon lived in the earlier 7th century or perhaps even in the late 8th century BC whereas Aiginetan coins date from some time later than this.1936 Herodotos, VI. 127, attributes to Pheidon the establishment of a system of weights and measures, not the invention of money.

So too Polykleitos was called a 'wise' statue-maker . . . Greek text : Heylbut, G. (1892) Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca. Vol. 20, Berlin: G. Reimer. Date : Around AD 1 100.

For when you have learnt something previously from the works of nature which you have seen, then also expect her art to be the same in all the rest. This at any rate is what we say about the works of art of men; we do not wait to see all the statues which Pheidias and Polykleitos made, but from those we have already seen we build up expectations about the others too. And so, whoever has knowledge of the works of nature, he could make an inference about the others from those he has already seen. Greek text : Kühn, D. (1821) Galeni Opera. Vol. II. Leipzig: C.

Galen tries to elucidate the creative power of Nature by comparing Nature's work with that of human artists.

For just as Pheidias possessed the powers of his craft even before he touched his material, and put these into action about his material - for every faculty lies dormant when it lacks its appropriate material - so also the semen possessed its faculties by its very nature, and while it did not take its activities from the material, it revealed them in connection with it... For this (the semen) is the craftsman analogous with Pheidias, while the blood resembles the wax. It is not up to the wax to find out for itself how much of it is required; this is up to Pheidias. So it is the craftsman who will draw to himself as much blood as he requires. Greek text : Helmreich, G. (1893) C. Galerii Opera Omnia , Vol. III. Leipzig: Teubner.

But not so the artist, who knows how to recognize the skill in the works; on the contrary, he praises Pheidias just the same, whether he sees cheap wood, or whichever sort of stone, or wax, or clay fashioned by him.

In the case of the Athena Parthenos, we know that the appearance matched the reality, for solid gold plates - weighing some forty-four talents - covered the draped parts of the goddess. In the case of the Zeus at Olympia, it is possible that a different technique was used, involving gold foil and glass, though this has yet to be proved.1944 to [léyeQoç : A term used in ancient art criticism to mean the grandeur of a work. The term is often used in relation to the statues of Pheidias, in particular his Athena Parthenos and Zeus at Olympia.

In the extract quoted he talks of Athena and Artemis. His disgust at this state of affairs is obvious in the derogatory language he uses. It seems quite possible that one particular monument to Athena he has in mind is the Athena Parthenos, which continued to stand in the Parthenon well into the next century and which received adoration particularly amongst the philosophers, sophists and rhetors of the city.1948 This very statue is mentioned in Vita Chrys. 83.

TTâç àvf|p ktX. : In answer to John Chrysostom's attack on the strong hold of paganism to be observed in Athens at the period of his visit in AD 367/368, Anthemios the sophist criticizes John for his ingratitude both towards his benefactors in the city - who have treated him so well - and towards Athena, the goddess through whom he received the wisdom he possesses. For John came to Athens in order to polish up his education. In his discussion of this passage, Trombley suggests that Anthemios' s speech also indicates his fear that if enough people in the city were to become Christians, then the temples would be bound to close for lack of local support.1949 At the time this debate is supposed to have taken place, Athens was unusual in continuing to have a fairly vigorous pagan life that seems to have been tolerated by the growing Christian community there and by the government at Constantinople. Christianity had become the official religion of the Empire in AD 325. After Julian's failed attempt to reinstate pagan cults in AD 361-363, the situation for pagans must have been delicate. This is certainly the impression one gets from the response of the archon Demosthenes to the speech made by Anthemios.1950 àîTiwv eiç to lepòv rf'ç [leyaXriç 0eâç 'AGīļvās Kal ttpocjttitttíov aÚTrj : This is a reference to the Parthenon and the statue of Athena Parthenos. It is valuable evidence to confirm that the temple was still open after AD 365 and that the image was still receiving homage. Zosimos, IV. 18.2-3, shows that the same was true in the following decade and Marinos, Vita Pr. X and XXX, makes it clear that the Parthenon and its image were probably not disturbed until some time after Proklos came to Athens (a little after AD 429), and perhaps not until almost the end of Proklos's life (AD 485). As Trombley says: "George of Alexandria nowhere mentions the closure of the Parthenon, as he might have been tempted to do, nor is there any anachronism in his treatment of the subject".1951 1949 Trombley (1993) 299-300. 1950 See Vita Chrys. 84. 1951 Trombley (1993) 336.</page><page sequence="136">GREEK SOURCES 787 GEORGE OF ALEXANDRIA, Vita S.

Our revered emperors are Christians and they have issued decrees forbidding the worship of any other god but Christ alone whom they worship and believe in. Knowing this, those who are devoted to Hellenic worship accomplish it in secret. Those who do this here, if they become known to the emperors, they are ruined by them and destroyed for scorning their holy and inexorable command. So, Anthemios, stop speaking at length on this matter, in case it should reach their esteemed ears. Not only would this confined and secret worship of the gods come out of our midst, but also we would be submitted to dangers and deadly punishments, because in all truth each person and every land that is under their authority, pays homage to Christ and they all worship him.

Civic rituals were tolerated by the Christian emperors, so public processions such as the Panathenaia continued to be celebrated in the 4th and the 5th centuries AD.1952 Sacrifice to pagan gods, however, was completely banned. It seems probable that public sacrifice disappeared quite rapidly, while private sacrifice continued for much longer. Imperial edicts repeating the prohibitions at various dates prove, not surprisingly, that it took time before Christianity was adopted throughout the Empire. In Athens, where the Athena Parthenos and the image of Asklepios still stood in their temples, and where they could still be visited, probably until well after the mid 5th century AD, pagans were probably particularly careful not to incur the risk of upsetting their Christian rulers and thus having their remaining temples closed. In this passage Demosthenes makes it clear that clandestine worship of the ancient gods was going on in his time. One might note in this respect the edict of AD 399 stating that idols might only be removed if there was proof that people were sacrificing before them.1953 € K ļiecrou yévTiTai auTTļ r) ļiiKpa Kai KpuTTTiļ twv Géûv XaTpeía : These words show that pagan worship was not widespread in Athens in the decade AD 360-370 and that it was a dangerous activity.

The walls of Babylon are found in several early lists of the seven wonders, but later they are dropped in favour of the Pharos of Alexandria, the latest wonder to be incorporated in the canonical list. The Zeus of Olympia is nearly always found in the wonder lists. See, for instance, Philon of Byzantium, De sept. Xpucroûç a&lt;ļ&gt;upri'aTos : The Zeus was covered in ivory and gold. The idea that the gold was hammered is found again in Anonymus Taurinensis, De Sept. Mir. Tom. 1.73.1 and Tzetzes, Chil. VIII. 324, but it is doubtful. Small terracotta moulds found in the rubbish dump of the workshop at Olympia were thought to have been used for moulding the gold pieces, but remains of clear, pale green glass in the moulds show that they were used for glasswork.1956 Schiering suggests that moulded glass backed with gold foil was used to produce the appearance of golden drapery in a new development of chryselephantine workmanship, which may have originated in Olympia.1957 It is not yet known whether these glass moulds can be connected with the statue of Zeus by Pheidias.

Ausonius 's owl must have stood outside in order to be effective. Dio 's owl is sometimes thought to have been part of the Athena Parthenos composition, though it is questionable to infer that his words imply so much. For further notes, see Dio Chrysostomos, loc. cit., and Volume 1, Athena Parthenos, section 1 . That there were owl statues on the Akropolis is clear from, for example, Athens, Akropolis Museum 1347, a piece almost one metre high and made of island marble.1960 HESYCHIOS, Lexicon , éKcrróvTrcôoç (Vol. II, 41, ed.

But whether the name originated with the building of this naos, or whether, as seems more likely, the length of the naos was inherited from an older 100ft temple or, as Preisshofen believes, from an older 100ft sacred area possibly on the same site, is not known for sure.1963 &lt;ttJ&gt; riap06 voj : Another example of the use of the name 'Parthenos' for the chryselephantine image of Athena in the Parthenon.

Daidalos : A semi-mythical figure, often regarded by the Greeks as the inventor of sculpture.1971 The name Daidalos means 'cunningly wrought' and Pausanias, who is very doubtful about the existence of such an individual, suggests that the name derives from 'daidala', the term given to old wooden images.1972 Daidalos may represent a personification of early monumental styles, or perhaps he really was the teacher of such sculptors as Dipoinos and Skyllis, among the first named artists to produce monumental works in Greece.1973 There was, at any rate, a 4th century BC Daidalos. Pheidias : According to some, Pheidias and his art represented the highest point in the development of Greek sculpture. This view is found expressed in the works of many rhetoricians, who were of the opinion that Pheidias had some sort of imaginative intuition which enabled him to visualize and to express something of the nature of the gods.

Since it is known from the sources that there were three statues of Athena by Pheidias on the Akropolis,1975 and it is also a fact that the Parthenos and the 'Promachos' were colossal works, it has been inferred by some that this 'little Parthenos' mentioned by Himerios is the Athena Lemnia.1976 If one could be sure that this passage of Himerios was a reference to the Lemnia, then it would provide confirmation that the Lemnia dates from around the mid century, since it is known that the Athena Parthenos dates from 447-438 BC. The assumed date of the Lemnia is based on the idea that it was made as a votive offering by Athenian cleruchs going to Lemnia around 451-447 BC.1977 Concerning the statue type, see Pausanias, 1.28.2, and Himerios, Or. 68.24, and Volume 1, chapter 5. Becatti, on the other hand, has argued that the statue Himerios mentions is yet another Athena statue by Pheidias on the Akropolis.1978 He identifies it with the Athena Medici type. Becatti was opposed to the view that the 'little Parthenos', here referred to by Himerios, was the Lemnia because, firstly, this passage seems to criticize the work, and the Lemnia was highly praised in general, and, secondly, Himerios comments that the 'little Parthenos' was made at Perikles's request. But neither of these arguments is very strong, given that Himerios was writing in the 4th century AD, when tastes would have been very different and when many of the historical details of the 5th century BC had become quite blurred.

And so it is perhaps best to capture his nature in a portrait, to imitate the example of Pheidias. Pheidias was not ignorant of how great Zeus was, nor of how great were those around him, for his soul was wiser than his hand was dextrous. And so, wanting to capture the nature of Zeus in a statue, he mixed ivory with gold, and in a single image he portrayed, as far as it was possible to do so, the one whom for the Eleians is the Olympian and for other men is Zeus. 1975 Pausanias, 1.24.5, for the Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon, and 1.28.2 for the 'Promachos' and the Lemnia. 1976 Frickenhaus (1913) 349; Klein (1915) 18. 1977 Pausanias, 1.28.2, 10-13. 1978 Becatti (1951) 181-83.</page><page sequence="150">GREEK SOURCES 801 Greek text : Colonna, A.

Naming Pheidias and Praxiteles together is a traditional motif, with many attested examples in Hellenistic and Imperial writings.1980 They were considered the great Athenian sculptors of the high and later Classical periods. Pheidias naturally takes precedence because he was earlier than Praxiteles and also more famous. Himerios is making a rhetorical point here, which shows the lack of knowledge in late antiquity of the details of the history of Classical art. The Zeus of Pheidias was made at Olympia in a specially designed workshop which was as large as the temple naos.1981 In Pausanias's day the workshop was a tourist attraction and a cult seat for all the gods.1982 The Athena Parthenos was made in Athens, also in a special workshop, constructed for the purpose of this specific project and later demolished.

What then is he describing as ļiiKpov? Corso suggests that perhaps Himerios means Pheidias's private workshop in Athens, which may have continued to be used until the mid 2nd century AD or even later.1984 Possible descendants of Pheidias include the Pheidias who at the end of the 4th century BC signed a statue at Oropos;1985 the Pheidias in the 3rd century BC who signed a gem now in the British Museum;1986 the Pheidias, son of Pheidias and brother of Ammonios who signed, with his brother, in AD 159 a statue found in Rome.1987 Like other skills, the technique of sculpture was handed down from one generation to the next within families and, considering Pheidias's reputation, it does not seem unlikely that his workshop would have continued to be in use for several generations and to be a place of interest for Athenians.

The discovery of new works, in a word, has confirmed both the nature of Pheidias and the skills of other craftsmen, whose hands are admired for their cleverness. Pheidias did not always fashion Zeus, nor did he always forge Athena with her weapons; he used his skill both to make other gods and to adorn the maiden goddess by infusing her cheeks with a blush, so that it would be under this instead of under her helmet that the beauty of the goddess would be hidden.

Apart from the ' Promachos ' and the Parthenos, there was also the Lemnia, the Athena Areia at Plataia, the Athena of Pellene in Achaia, and possibly another Athena mentioned by Pliny as having been taken to Rome.1988 These were not all of bronze, though the 'Promachos' and the statue of which Pliny writes were.

Himerios does not name the statue he is describing. Partly by a process of elimination, and partly because the statue is characterized as very beautiful, this passage has been interpreted by some as describing the Athena Lemnia, which was considered by many as Pheidias's most beautiful work.1990 Even if this interpretation is correct, the passage does little to help one discover the statue type amongst replicas of mid 5th century BC helmetless Athenas. It does not specify that the figure was standing, for instance, rather than seated, nor does it make clear whether or not the helmet, which was not on her head, was carried in her hand, as Furtwängler proposed.1991 For a discussion of the usual type associated with the Lemnia see notes to Pausanias, 1.28.2, lines 10-13.

The name of the thief is variously read as OiXoûpyoç or OiXopyóç. The Suda , 0. 3 10, quoting the 4th century AD writer Synesios, Calv. Ene. XIX.83A, also refers to someone called OiXeaç, who apparently stole a gorgoneion from the Athenian Akropolis. Is this a mistake or is this a reference to another crime? Apart from the problem of the thief s name, there is also uncertainty about what he actually stole. It was clearly a famous gorgoneion, but Isokrates gives no clue as to which it might be. It has been thought by some to be the shield gorgoneion from the Athena Parthenos. Dinsmoor made this suggestion, connecting the Isokrates passage with a reference made by Synesios to a passage from Andokides, which tells of the theft of a gorgoneion described as tt'ç 0eoí) tò Topyoveiov é£ àKpoTTÓXewç.1996 Dinsmoor suggested that this object should be equated with the one described as cxtto Tfļs àamôoç Tfļs qttò tô veci and mentioned several times in the Parthenon Treasures inventory lists.1997 There is no proof, however, to confirm that the gorgoneion in question had anything to do with the Parthenos. In fact, there is a certain amount of evidence to suggest that the gorgoneion was the one from the ancient and sacred xoanon, called the Athena Polias in later sources. Kleidemos says that the gorgoneion 'from the statue of the goddess at Athens' was stolen in 480 BC.1998 A passage in Eustathios associates the theft of a gorgoneion with the Athena Polias.1999 It is possible that all the sources in question are referring to this same theft.

The letter is addressed to the people of Antioch, whom Julian found most irreverent and frivolous when he stayed in Antioch during the winter of AD 361/362, on his way to Persia. (1)i'ó0€oi : Julian's description of the Athenians as devoted pagans in his day supports the view that, despite legislation by earlier emperors to put an end to paganism in the Empire, Athens remained strongly pagan until much later than many other places. After Julian's brief revival of paganism during his reign, it clearly became more difficult and more dangerous to continue with the old worship, as can be seen from the writings of George of Alexandria, but the fact that paganism was not completely crushed is indicated by the need for more prohibitions against sacrifices and further measures concerning temples under later emperors such as Arcadius, Honorius and Theodosius II.2005 JULIAN, Oratio II. 54 a-b. yeXotov yàp o'ip.ai Trpòç aè TTepl twv aûv epywv öiriyetaGar Kai Tairròv äv TTa0oi|ii &lt;1)aij'ü) Kai aKÓ|ii|jü) öeaTrj twv Oeiôíou 8r||juoi;pyTļ|ia™v TTpòs aiiTÒv Oeiôíav émxÉipoDvTi ôi€^i€vai TTepi rf's èv aKpoTTÓXei TTap0ćvou Kai rov TTapà tolç niaaioiç Aios.

Date : Earlier 3rd century BC. Iambus VI : In this poem, addressed to a friend about to set sail for Elis to see the statue of Zeus by Pheidias, Kallimachos described the statue in some detail. He gave the dimensions of the throne, the footstool, and the seated figure as well as the total cost of the work. Unfortunately most of the lines are fragmentary or lost, but a few important facts may still be gleaned from this poem. 'A]'€loç o Zę[i3ę, á Tex^a 8è Oeiôia : For notes on the statue of Zeus at Olympia see Pausanias, V.l 1.1-10, as well as the relevant chapter in Volume 1.

TT6VT6 ję[T]p[dKi]v [tto]0wv : The outside measurements of the statue base are known from the floor of the excavated temple to have been 6.54m in width and 9.82m in length.2007 Pfeiffer assumes that the foot Kallimachos uses equals 330mm, and, therefore, that the 'twenty feet' in question refers to the width of the base, for they would amount to 6.60m, which is very close to the recorded width of the base. An exact result is achieved if it is assumed that the foot in question measured 327,2mm, which would be the so-called Doric or Pheidonian foot of 326-28mm. TETpaöwpa . . . TraXacFTaí : Pfeiffer considers that this smaller measurement of two cubits could refer to the height of the base. This was the normal height for bases in the Classical period and was probably the same as that of the Athena Parthenos base. 2007 Mallwitz (1972) 229.</page><page sequence="163">814 WRITTEN SOURCES Lines 29-36 : Pfeiffer is of the opinion that in these lines the subject was the dimensions of the throne and possibly the footstool. Therefore he thinks that the throne was 30 feet in height. Auôiepyès : 'of Lydian workmanship'. Lapatin considers that this may indicate that the throne was decorated in Near Eastern fashion with ivories inlaid with coloured stones and glass.2008 This would accord with the description of the throne by Pausanias (V.11.2) as well as with the material finds made in the workshop of Pheidias. auTÒs 8' ó Saíjiwv īrevrķ] T[â]ç ec(&gt;e8p[í]8oç . . . TTaxéeaai ļiaaacov : Pfeiffer infers that the height of the image was 25 cubits: 30 feet, that is twenty cubits, plus a further five cubits. With the two cubits of the base, the whole composition would have been 27 cubits high. Using the 330mm foot, Pfeiffer thought the total height would have been 13.365m. Using the slightly smaller Doric-Pheidonian foot, the total comes out at 13.25m. Nim : From Pausanias, V.l 1.1, we know that the Nike, which was chryselephantine, stood on the god's right hand, an echo of the Parthenos composition. TTapGévoi yàp fQpai : Pausanias, V.l 1.1, reports that the other figures on the top of the throne were the Charités and these are the figures which were the same height as the Horai, namely one fathom, that is, 6 feet or 1.98m (assuming a foot of 330mm). On the throne of Zeus at Megara by Theokosmos, there were the Seasons and the Fates.2009 In the case both of the Zeus at Olympia and the Zeus at Megara Pausanias says that the figures protruded above the level of Zeus's head. Kallimachos says that the god was taller than the throne. But this may not disagree with Pausanias, if Kallimachos means that Zeus was taller than the back-rest of the throne rather than the figures which adorned the corners of the back- rest. Lines 47ff. : In these lines, Kallimachos gave information concerning the cost of the statue but, unfortunately, all this section is missing. Lines 59ff. : These lines perhaps refer to the inscription mentioned by Pausanias, V.l 0.2, which was at the foot of the statue, and which said that the maker of the statue was Pheidias the Athenian, son of Charmides. 2008 Lapatin (2001)81. 2°09 pausaniaSj 1.40.4.</page><page sequence="164">GREEK SOURCES 815 KALLISTHENES, Fragment F 52, scholion Lykophron, 520, TpiyévvT1Toç 0eà Tļ 'A0r|vd.

Quoting the historian Kallisthenes, he says that one explanation of TpiyévvTiTOç, literally 'thrice-born', is that Athena was born on the third day of the month. This agrees with Harpokration, as well as the Suda and Etym. Magn. 767.40ff.2010 It seems that on the third day of every month there was a public celebration in honour of Athena. Another tradition, however, found in Photios, the Suda , and the scholiast to Homer, II. VIII.38, says that Athena's birthday fell on the 28th, that is, the third day from the end rather than the beginning of the month.2011 This is unlikely for two reasons: firstly, there is no evidence that the Athenians had a monthly festival on this day in honour of Athena, and, secondly, the third is a much more likely date for Athena's birthday considering the fact that the birthdays of all the other major gods fell within the first decade of the month. Perhaps the confusion arose from the fact that the high point of one important festival in honour of Athena, the Panathenaia, fell on the 28th of Hekatombaion.2012 This was the day on which the procession to the Akropolis, the presentation of the peplos, and the main sacrifices took place. The whole festival was considerably longer, usually stretching from the 23rd to the 30th of Hekatombaion.2013 The evidence in support of the common assumption that the Panathenaic festival was held in honour of Athena's birthday 2010 For which see Mikalson (1975) 16. 201 1 For the references, see Mikalson (1975) 23. 2012 See Proklos, In Plat .

Kedrenos seems to be quoting Symeon Logothete, Chron. 87, writing in the early 11th century AD (after a work of the mid 10th century AD), who specifies that the statue had rays, presumably around the head, to symbolize the sun. Tzetzes, Chil. VIII.3 1 7ff. calls this statue the Anthelios Apollo. All three authors attribute the work to Pheidias, but this is probably a mistake. Another tradition maintains that the statue originated in Phrygia.2016 None of the authors claiming that the statue was by Pheidias is earlier than the 10th century AD, so their authority on this subject cannot be taken for granted. 2014 So Ridgway (1992) 127. 2015 Pausanias, IX.33.7. 2016 Chronicon Paschale (Dindorf, Vol. I, Bonn ed., (1832) 528); Malaias, Chron.

Note that in the district of Lausos there were various dwellings and some hostels, where the Philoxenos cistern provided water (which is where the name comes from). There also stood the statue of Lindian Athena, four cubits high and made of emerald stone, the work of the statue-makers Skyllis and Dipoinos, which Sesostris, the Pharaoh of Egypt, once sent as a gift to Kleoboulos, the tyrant of Lindos. There was also the Knidian Aphrodite of white marble, naked, which covered with one hand its private parts only, a work of Praxiteles the Knidian. There was the Samian Hera, a work of Lysippos and Boupalos of Chios. There was a winged Eros, holding a bow, which came from Myndos. There was also the ivory Zeus of Pheidias, which Perikles dedicated in the Olympian temple. And there was the statue imitating Time, a work by Lysippos, which was bald at the back and covered in hair at the front. There were also unicorns, tigers, vultures and giraffes, bull-elephants, Centaurs and Pans. Greek text : Bekker, I. (1838) Cedrenus. Vol. I. Bonn: Ed. Weber. Date : Late 1 1th and early 12th centuries AD. ev tols Aavoov : That is, in the vicinity of the Lauseion, the mansion of Lausos. Lausos was a eunuch and an imperial chamberlain, who is known to have been in office as praepositus sacri cubiculi in AD 420 (though he may have held this post more than once). The Lauseion is usually identified with a huge rotunda (22.30m in diameter), leading into a hall of similarly vast dimensions (52.50m long by 12.40m wide), with an apse at the far end, positioned to the north-west of the Hippodrome in Constantinople. For such a large work as the Olympian Zeus, which measured some 12.30m high, and which rested on a base that was 6.54m wide at the front and 9.82m deep, the great apsidal hall would have been a suitable home. Bardili, however, disputes this identification, stating that the Lauseion still awaits discovery, probably in an area closer to the Forum of Constantine.2017 2017 Bardili (1997) 67ff.</page><page sequence="167">818 WRITTEN SOURCES In the palace, Lausos housed a unique collection of sculpture. He was fortunate enough to have been in a position of influence at precisely the right moment to acquire valuable antiquities which had never been available to collectors before. It was a period in which pagan temples were going out of use. In AD 381 and 385 the offering of pagan sacrifices was severely punished and, during this period, many temples were destroyed in unauthorized attacks, which were carried out with impunity. In AD 382 the Emperor Theodosios I ordered that pagan temples be kept open if they contained valuable sculptures, but ten years later he decreed that all pagan temples be closed and he made pagan cults illegal. In AD 408 any statue still being worshipped in its temple was removed. It was at this time that many statues of recognized artistic value, including the Pheidian Zeus, became available to collectors and were transported to Constantinople. The Pheidian Zeus at any rate must have been moved between AD 393, when steps were taken to suppress the Olympian festival, and AD 425, when the temple of Zeus was damaged by fire. Unfortunately, its transfer to Constantinople did not protect the statue for very long, for by AD 475 fire had completely destroyed the palace that then housed it.2018 Along with the Olympian Zeus, Kedrenos here mentions the following works, also said to be housed in the Lauseion: a Lindian Athena in malachite, by Dipoinos and Skyllis, the Knidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles, the Samian Hera, an Eros with a bow, the 'Chronos' of Lysippos, and several statues of animals, both real and mythical. This passage needs to be read in conjunction with a related passage in 1.616. The second passage tells of the destruction of the collection by a fire that spread through the palace in AD 475 and it is repeated by Zonaras who adds that the source for the passage is Malchus.2019 Malchus lived in the later 5th century AD, and he wrote a History which is known to have included a detailed description of the fire of AD 475. 2020 The first passage is clearly related to the second, as one can see from the facts that the name Sesostris in the first passage is a mistake for Amasis, which is given in the second passage, and that the words e£ aX'rļs u'r|9 describing the Lindian Athena in the second passage only make sense when taken in connection with the description of the Lindian Athena made of malachite in the first passage. So where does the first passage come from? Mango suggests that it is drawn from Konstantinos Rhodios and his famous poem on the seven wonders of Constantinople (composed between AD 93 1-944). 2021 The Kedrenos passage under consideration is placed after the death of Theodosios I in AD 395, and it forms part of an insertion consisting of fifteen short entries all except the first of which deal with monuments of Constantinople. In order, the entries are: 1 . Explanation of the legend CONOB found on early Byzantine coins. 2. Column of Leo I at Pittakia. 3. Statues at Strategion. 2^18 Kedrenos, Comp.

It is probable that Kedrenos was using a version of the poem that is now lost, but which was fuller than the one which survives.2023 Konstantinos used Malchus as his source. Thus both the related passages in Kedrenos, 1.564 and 1.616, ultimately derive from the same source, though the first passage came to Kedrenos via Konstantinos. One can therefore be confident that, despite certain mistakes, Kedrenos here gives an accurate list of the statues in the palace of Lausos and probably names them in the order in which they stood. Vickers and Francis suggest a programmatic arrangement for the collection, based on strong Christian beliefs, such as would befit a man like Lausos: the Zeus, placed in the apse at the end of the long hall, would have been flanked on either side by a statue by Lysippos - Eros on the left and Kairos (called here Chronos) on the right - with Athena, Aphrodite and Hera (the three goddesses of the famous beauty contest) leading up to the Eros, and wild beasts and mythical creatures (some of them the products of chance couplings) leading 2022 These lines can be found in Kedrenos, Comp.

As Vickers and Francis put it, And it is surely as a guide to others that Lausus composed his ingenious Imago Mundi : as a model of Virtue, of Justice, of God indeed, infinitely greater than the puny products of Eros and Chance.2025 The iconography of Pheidias's Zeus was assimilated into Christian art by the 6th century AD, his image inspiring that of the Byzantine bearded Christ Pantocrator.2026 This happened as a result of the statue's presence in Constantinople for some fifty years up to AD 475. to aya'|ia rf's Aivôíaç 'AGrļvas T€TpaTTTļxu CK XíGou ajiapáyôou : Taking this passage with the later passage {Comp. Hist. 1.616), the Pharaoh must have sent two statues of Athena to Kleoboulos, one that was of malachite, and which was 6 feet high, and one 'in a different material'. Xenagoras reports that both the statues were recorded in the Hellenistic Lindian temple chronicle, which described them both as golden, and he adds that one was inscribed in Greek while the other bore an inscription in hieroglyphics.2027 Vickers and Francis assume that the 'green' goddess was the one inscribed with hieroglyphics and that it had lost its gold revetment by the 5th century AD.2028 Many pagan cult statues are known to have been stripped of their gold by Constantine in the earlier 4th century AD.2029 As stone statues dedicated to Athena by a Pharaoh, the Athena statues cannot have been the cult statue of Athena Lindia, tò ayaXfia ttíç Aivôíaç 'AGrļvas, as Kedrenos says.

Kedrenos is the only source which attributes the Samian Hera to Lysippos and Boupalos of Chios. Whether there is any truth in the claim is unverifiable.2032 "Epws tó£ov è'xwv, TTTepwTÓç : This work represented a winged Eros, holding a bow. Kedrenos asserts that the statue came from Myndos, in Karia. A drawing of the Lauseion, dating from the later 16th century, depicts an Eros of a type which is preserved in several ancient sculptures and which may correspond with the Eros of Myndos, thought by some to be by Lysippos.2033 Unlike the Eros of Thespiai, the body of this type is turned to its right, while the head is turned sharply to its left, the gaze directed horizontally. The composition focuses on the moment when the attention of Eros is suddenly distracted from the business of stringing his bow by something going on nearby. Perhaps he turned to look at his mother or the intended victim of his arrow. If the work is by Lysippos, it suggests that the artist followed Alexander the Great to Asia in 334 BC. Kai ó Oeiôiou eXec1&gt;ávTivoç Zevs : The Zeus is described as being made of ivory. This is probably because any gold had been removed by the time the statue came to Constantinople. This idea finds support in the description of the 'green' Athena Lindia, concerning which there is evidence that it too was once adorned with gold. The fact that the Zeus could still be considered a great work of art even when its gold revetment was missing, and that it continued to be a powerful source of inspiration until its destruction in AD 475 suggests that the wooden core of the statue was a fully finished wooden sculpture of Zeus, lacking only the final details and colour. IlepiKXíiç : This is clearly another mistake by the author. Perikles's association with Pheidias was connected with the making of the Athena Parthenos at Athens and he certainly did not dedicate the Olympian Zeus.

The strange haircut demonstrates his fleeting nature: those who meet him may seize him, but once he has gone by he may never be recaptured. The work has been recognized in a number of replicas.

And this is what happened: in the middle of the Forum of Constantine, a bronze statue that faced towards the east stood upon a remarkable porphyry column; it held a sceptre in the right hand and an orb made of bronze in the left hand. It was said that this statue was of Apollo, and the inhabitants of Constantinople called it "Anthelios" I think. The Emperor Constantine the Great, father and lord of the city, changed this title to his own name, calling the work a statue of the autocrat Constantine. But the original title for the statue dominated, and everyone called it either "Anelios" or "Anthelios". Suddenly, however, violent winds blowing from Libya threw this statue down to the ground, when the sun was in the sign of the Bull. This was interpreted by most people as an unfavourable omen, especially by those who were not well disposed towards the autocrator; for they whispered that this event presaged the death of the Basileus. But he said, "I know of one master of life and death, and I cannot believe that the falling of statues brings death. For whenever a Pheidias, for instance, or some other sculptor cuts a stone and fashions an image, will he also resurrect the dead and bring forth living beings? If this is the case, then what will be left to the Creator of all things? "I shall bring death and I shall give life", He says. This has nothing to do with the collapse or the raising up of this or that statue". For he attributed everything to the great Providence of God.</page><page sequence="176">GREEK SOURCES 827 Greek text : Leib, B. (1945) Alexiade : règne de l'empereur Alexis I Comnene: 1081-1118. Anne Comnène. Vol. III. Collection Byzantine. CUF. Budé ed. Paris: Les Belles Lettres. Date : The history of the reign of her father, Alexios I (1081-1 1 18), was written by Anna after 1 148, when she was in the Kecharitomene nunnery. In Book XII, Anna recounts the preparations made by Alexios for the second Norman invasion of Illyria by Bohemond, in AD 1105-1107. In the passage preceding the one quoted here (4.2), Alexios goes to Thessalonika to organize resistance in the west and a comet appears in the sky. This omen is interpreted as a presage of the movement of Celts, its disappearance from the sky being the sign that the Celts are about to depart again from the area. XaXKOûs Tiç àvôpiàç : In this passage Alexios is back in Constantinople once more (the year is AD 1106), and another extraordinary event takes place: this time the large bronze statue, which had stood on top of a porphyry column in the middle of the Forum of Constantine since it had been placed there by Constantine the Great himself in AD 328, was sent crashing to the ground by violent winds. According to Anna, the statue was said to be that of Apollo, holding a sceptre in the right hand and an orb in the left, and it was generally known as the 'Anthelios' Apollo.2040 From other descriptions of this statue we can add that the head was crowned with rays to resemble the sun.2041 Constantine used the statue to represent himself and he seems to have added an inscription to this effect. OTTīļviKa yàp Oeiôíaç tiç, cķepe eiTTeîv, rj tiç twv Xi0o£óü)v : The falling of the statue of Anthelios Apollo is referred to by many authors, but Anna Komnene is the only one who reports the reactions of Alexios to the event. People hostile to the Emperor interpreted this as a bad omen for him, suggesting that it presaged his own death, but the Emperor piously maintained that God alone gives life and death, and that it is equally ridiculous to believe that a falling statue can presage death as it is to think that a sculptor can impart life to his creations, however lifelike these may be. As an example of a brilliant sculptor, Anna names Pheidias. This in itself is not in any way remarkable, since many authors have recourse to this sculptor's name if they want to mention a first class artist.2042 Nevertheless, the reference is interesting for two reasons. In the first place, Anna groups Pheidias with stone carvers. The literary evidence for Pheidias as a stone carver is fairly slim, whereas there is every reason to believe that his greatest and most famous creations were in gold and ivory.2043 References to Pheidias as, first and foremost, a stone sculptor are found mainly 2040 For notes and further references to this statue, see Tzetzes, Chil. VIII.317ff. 2041 See Malaias, Chron. XIII. 2042 See, for instance, Libanios, Ep. 1342; Martial, Ep. 6.13.1-2; Themistios, Or. 21.24 to name three. 2043 See Pliny, Atf/36.15ff. and notes.</page><page sequence="177">828 WRITTEN SOURCES in later sources and it seems likely that these are based on a misunderstanding of a text by Aristotle.2044 Secondly, the mention of Pheidias in the context of the Anthelios Apollo is interesting because, according to three late authors, this statue was the work of Pheidias.2045 Anna herself makes no such attribution, though by mentioning Pheidias alongside this statue she seems to leave the question open. In fact, it seems certain that an older tradition, recorded at least as early as Malaias in the 6th century AD, correctly identifies the Apollo as an oriental work brought to Constantinople from Phrygia.

To prove his point about the fame bestowed on painters and sculptors, Konstantinos names four artists of the ancient Classical period who were still remembered in his day: Pheidias, Praxiteles, Lysippos and Parrhasios. There is a preponderance of sculptors here, probably because in Byzantine times ancient figurative art was better remembered in terms of sculpture than painting. Constantinople, of course, became home to many ancient sculptures including an impressive collection housed in the Lauseion.2046 Pheidias, Praxiteles, Lysippos, Parrhasios : The mention of Pheidias and Praxiteles together comes as no surprise, for it is a traditional association often repeated.2047 Lysippos was probably the next best known Classical sculptor in Constantinople. See, for instance, 2044 por jater sources referring to Pheidias as primarily a stone sculptor, see, for instance, Gregoras Nikephoros, Rhom. Hist . XV.2; Hesychios, Lex. OiÔíai; Theodoras Hyrtakenos, M. Palaeologos. For the passage in Aristotle which may have been wrongly interpreted see Eth. Nic. VI.7. 2045 Symeon Logothete, Chron. 87; Kedrenos, Comp.

Parrhasios is mentioned perhaps following the example of Photios, in Horn. X.ii.433. As in Photios and Gregorios of Nazianzos, De Theol. 25.17, for instance, the artists are named in the plural, as nomina excellentiae ; this is a motif one finds also in the much earlier writer, Philostratos, De Vita Ap. VI. 19. Corso points out how strange it is that Byzantine writers, using terms similar to those of the ancients themselves, spoke of Greek art as if it had never stopped being admired and appreciated, despite the long years of rejection, lack of interest, and adverse criticism to which it had in fact been subject in the course of the Byzantine period.2048 KONSTANTĪNOS RHODIOS, Ekphrasis , lines 153-62. iļ 8' au ye KaXXiTTapGevoç Koprļ T)Tiç uïrepGev klovoç p.aKpoö TreXei TTļv XÉÎp' €TT6KT6Lvouaa TTpòç Tov àépa, riaXXáôoç eiK áv eon Aivôlwv uXávris, f'S elxov oi TrpomcjTOV oiKoOvTes tteSov 'PóSou TaXaivTļs Suacjeßüs Te0pap.p.évor ôr|Xoi ôè Kpávoç Kal tò yópyeiov Tepaç, õ(|)eiç tè TTpòç TpaxTļXov €|iTTeTTXey|iévor oírnos yáp, outcjs ol TTaXai [i€|irivÓTeç tò FlaXXáôos eiôwXov eTTXaTToy ļiaTrļv. But indeed the beautiful bronze maiden, who is on top of a tall column, stretching out her hand towards the sky, is an image of Pallas, a misguided monument of Lindians, for first of all the inhabitants of miserable Rhodes possessed her, those people impiously brought up; clearly visible are the helmet, the monstrous gorgoneion and the snake chains wound near her throat. For it was thus, thus, that the mad people of ancient times fashioned in vain the image of Pallas. Greek text : Legrand, E. (1896) REG, 41.

The column of Arcadius. This is one of the oldest surviving descriptions of the monuments of Constantinople. The section of interest here relates to the Senate House, in connection with which Konstantinos concentrates on two ancient works that were to be found there: the bronze door from the temple of Artemis at Ephesos, which was adorned in relief with a Gigantomachy, and the bronze statue of Athena. Konstantinos does not specify which of the two Senate Houses built by Constantine he is talking about, but it is probably the Senate of the Forum Constantini.2049 His comments show his deep disapproval of pagan views. fH 8' ai ye xa^Kfj KaXXiTTápõevoç Koprļ : According to the author, the statue of Athena which he saw outside the Senate House of the Forum of Constantine came from Lindos in Rhodes.2050 It is possible that this is the same statue as the Lindian Athena which Zosimos says stood outside the Senate of the Augusteion until at least the early 6th century AD.2051 The statue Zosimos describes may well have been moved by the time of Konstantinos. Doubt has been cast, however, on the Lindian origins of the statue by several scholars because of a possible link with Pheidias. In his description of the statues outside the Senate of the Forum of Constantine, Arethas says there was an Athena probably by Pheidias and, as a pendant, a sea-goddess from Lindos.2052 Corso suggests that Konstantinos gave a Lindian provenance to the Athena as he was getting confused with the sea-goddess pendant to the Athena described by Arethas, which probably did come from Lindos.2053 Linfert suggests that there is a confusion in the sources between the names Lindia and Lemnia, which are quite similar, and that while Arethas was commenting on the Lemnia of Pheidias, later commentators mistakenly thought he meant a Lindian Athena.2054 Whether or not any link can be made with the colossal statue of Athena described by Niketas Choniates, which is sometimes thought to be the Athena Promachos of Pheidias, is very difficult to establish.2055 LATERCULI ALEXANDRINI VII. 3-9. dyaX|iaT0TT0i0Í * Oeiôiaç npa^iTe'rļs ZicÓTras* àvôpiavTOTTo[ioí] * Múpwv AúaiTnToç rioXÚKXeiToç Oupó^axoç. 2°49 por arguments jn favour of this view, see Legrand (1896) 87-88. 2050 Compare Kedrenos, Comp.

Nic. VI.7. It is sometimes assumed, therefore, that the former word specifies workers in other materials, notably marble. This meaning would be appropriate in the case of Praxiteles, of course, but much less so in the case of Pheidias, whose most famous works were either chryselephantine or bronze. Corso prefers a different interpretation, suggesting that the two words are used to distinguish artists by their subjects rather than by their materials.2056 The first three artists named were most famous in Hellenistic times for their statues of immortals (the Zeus of Pheidias, the Knidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles, the Maenad of Skopas), while the others were more famous for their statues of animals or humans: the Heifer and Diskobolos of Myron, the portraits of Alexander by Lysippos, the Doryphoros of Polykleitos, and, for Phyromachos, possibly the portrait of Antisthenes.2057 As Corso points out, the order in which the artists are named is important, for preference is given to those of the Classical era and of the Attic school, while those of later times and other schools are mentioned afterwards.

He is singing and in one hand he holds up his lyre. Anakreon is characterized as rather drunk and as having a lecherous look in his eyes. The sources refer to several statues of Anakreon in antiquity; there was one on Teos, for example, and another on the Athenian Akropolis.2058 It is possible that Pheidias executed a statue of Anakreon, but the type associated with this sculptor on stylistic grounds (Copenhagen, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, 491) is rather different from the statue described in this poem: Anakreon is represented in the prime of life, standing upright and wearing only a short cloak about his arms and shoulders.

Declamatio 1 : A model rhetorical exercise in the form of an Apologia Socratis. Theognis : The elegiac poet, from Megara in Greece, lived in the 6th century BC, probably from around 600-530 BC. The passage from Theognis which Libanios no doubt has in mind here is Elegies , 1.173-82, a very famous and often quoted piece.2059 In it, Theognis attacks poverty, saying that it enslaves a man and takes away his voice. Lampros, Pheidias : These two men of the 5th century BC are named as experts in their fields, who would easily defeat any adversary, however wealthy, in a speech on their subject. In the case of Pheidias the subject would, of course, be statues, while in the case of Lampros it would be music. Lampros was a very distinguished musician and, reputedly, the teacher of Sophocles. The use of Pheidias's name in such a context shows how great his reputation remained even many centuries after his death. That Pheidias was a poor man may be doubted. See Plato, Meno , 91 d and notes. Ischomachos, Hipponikos : Ischomachos was a notoriously rich Athenian. The name occurs several times in Greek literature, most famously perhaps in Xenophon's Oeconomicus .2060 Hipponikos came from one of the richest Athenian families. He was the father of Kallias, who was supposed to have negotiated the famous 'Peace of Kallias' in around 450 BC. A learned and cultured man, Libanios was steeped in Classical Greek literature and thought. Allusions such as those that appear in this passage are typical of his writing and they demonstrate his admiration for the culture of Classical Greece.

He was sent to Libanios from Ancyra by his uncles Strategios and Albanios. As Libanios says earlier in the same letter, he had held Eusebios in his arms as a baby. Libanios travelled to Ancyra in AD 350-351, during the period when he was teaching in Constantinople, and he was well known and respected there.2061 Pheidias : Eusebios left Ancyra to study with Libanios in Antioch, because Libanios had such a high reputation as a teacher of oratory. Nevertheless, says Libanios, the sophist did not flatter himself to be as great a craftsman in his field as the most famous of all Greek artists, namely Pheidias. LIBANIOS, Epistle 1342, section 3.

For example, there was a bronze statue, in the city of Beroia, of Asklepios in the form of the handsome son of Kleinias. Art imitated nature, and so great was its grace that people who could see it each day still wanted to look at it. No one was so wicked as to dare to say that sacrifices were offered to it. And yet this statue, my lord, accomplished with so much toil, no doubt, and brilliance, has been broken up and destroyed; the work of Pheidias has been torn apart by the hands of the masses. Greek text : Forster, R. (1906) Libanius. Opera. Vol. III. Leipzig: Teubner. Date : Between AD 381 and 386. In this speech Libanios demands toleration of pagans, and asks that pagan temples be protected from destruction. Beroia : A city in Syria. ' ActkXt1ttiòç év e'iôei rov KXeivíou Traiôòç toO KaXoí) : A statue of Asklepios, apparently modelled on Alkibiades. Oeiôíou : The attribution of such a statue to Pheidias, which is unsupported by any other evidence or source, is deeply suspect: when Pheidias left Athens in about 438/437 BC, Alkibiades was only 17 years old and, in any case, the worship of Asklepios did not become widespread until the last quarter of the 5th century BC, when Pheidias was almost certainly dead. It does, however, suggest, and this is no doubt Libanios's intention, that the statue in question was a masterpiece of antiquity. Libanios took the view that some pagan statues deserved to be treasured even by the Christians, not for any religious reason but for their unique artistic value. For the beautiful statue of Asklepios the tragedy was that it was destroyed even though it had ceased to be used as an object of worship.

What then of the art of Glaukos of Chios, was it there from the beginning? And the art of Zeuxis, was it not of later times? When did men start to fear that statues would use their feet to escape? This fear was the work of the hands of Daidalos. And Pheidias, who was born later, overshadowed him more than Daidalos overshadowed those who came before him. And indeed we hear that music up to the time of Archilochos and those days was simple and coarse, but that it progressed as time went on. Greek text : Förster, R. (1908) Libanius. Opera. Vol. IV.

This work was greatly admired by Herodotus, 1.25, as well as by Pausanias, X.16.1, although by his day only the stand remained. r| ZeúÇiôoç : Zeuxis was a painter of the late 5th-early 4th century BC.

Pheidias, the most renowned, made the Zeus at Olympia, the Athena Parthenos, and the Athena ' Promachos ' and perhaps some others too such as, for example, the Athena Areia at Plataia which, according to Pausanias, IX.4.1, was not much smaller than the 'Promachos'. Myron was famed for his Zeus, Athena and Herakles at the Samian Heraion.2065 Praxiteles is known to have produced some works which were over life-size, for instance the Artemis of Antikyra and perhaps the Hera Teleia of Plataia.2066 But it is not clear that he made colossal statues as Pheidias and Myron did. The Poseidon in question cannot be identified. The implication of the passage is that the statue was another chryselephantine work, like the Zeus at Olympia, but there is no evidence for such a work by Pheidias or Myron, nor any evidence that Praxiteles ever used the chryselephantine technique.2067 ó ļioiov övtci tols |ieyaXoiç ¿Keívoiç KoXoaaotç : A rare inside look at a chryselephantine statue.

They do say at any rate that a certain sculptor, I think it was Pheidias, saw only the claw of a lion but from it worked out how big the whole lion was, assuming that it was modelled on the same scale as the claw. . . . Seeing a lion's claw, would Pheidias ever have known that it came from a lion if he had never seen a whole lion? Or, seeing a man's hand, could you have said that it is a man's, if you had neither known nor seen a man before? Why do you say nothing? Do you want me to reply for you, giving the answer which has to be given, namely that you could not have done such a thing? It seems that Pheidias has retired without success, and has modelled his lion in vain; he is obviously saying something which has nothing to do with Dionysos! What comparison is there? For Pheidias and for you there was no other way of recognizing the parts except by your knowledge of the whole - I mean the whole man and lion; and in philosophy, for instance the Stoic, how could you, from one part, see the rest? How could you demonstrate that the rest was beautiful? For, you do not know the whole, from which those parts come. Greek text : Macleod, M. D. (1987) Luciani Opera.

An Amazon statue is also mentioned by Pliny, who records that the figure was made of bronze and that it was produced for a competition held at Ephesos.2070 Three main types of Amazon statues are known in numerous copies as well as in cast fragments found at Baiae, dating from about the 430s BC and coming from bronze originals. They are all close in size, dress and general style. At least two of them represent Amazons leaning on their spears. The main types of wounded Amazon statues are the Berlin/Lansdowne/Sciarra type, known in at least thirty Roman copies, the Mattei type, known in at least eleven Roman copies, and the Capitoline/Sosikles type, known in over forty Roman copies.2071 The problem of attributing a type to an artist has exercized many scholars. Both the Sosikles and the Mattei types lean on their spears, so Pheidias's work could be one of these two. But there is little agreement amongst scholars about which is the likelier candidate. The Sosikles type has the more unusual design of the two for the period, with the left forearm being brought across the front of the body in an almost Lysippan manner.

Twv Oeiôiou Kai 'AXKafievouç twv XiGivw : Several ancient writers specify that Pheidias worked in stone. See for example, Pausanias, 1.14.7, who says Pheidias made an Aphrodite Ourania in Athens in marble; Pausanias, IX. 10.2, who says Pheidias made a Hermes Pronaos in Thebes; Pliny, NH 36.15. Pliny merely says tradunt, as if he himself was not sure of this. He mentions one Aphrodite in marble, which he says was in Rome. Neither this work nor those mentioned by Pausanias are documented in any other source. It is often presumed that since Pheidias was, according to Plutarch, Per. 13, 'episkopos' for the building of the Parthenon, he must have been involved in the design and, perhaps, the execution of the Parthenon marbles. Arguments in favour of this view, based on considerations of the design of the compositions, with particular regard to figure poses, drapery and landscape elements, are considered in detail in Volume 1, The Parthenon. It remains probable, however, that Pheidias 's marble works were overshadowed by the fame of his chryselephantine works. There is no written evidence to prove Pheidias's involvement in the Parthenon project, but then the sources say very little about any sculpture that is not free standing. It is not clear what Plutarch means by 'episkopos', but it is certainly the case that in the period 447-438 BC, the metopes and frieze were being made by a team of sculptors, and Pheidias's main concern was the Athena Parthenos, while in the years immediately after this, when the pediments were in progress, Pheidias had left for Olympia.

This statue was unique in that it was not only a cult statue but also a show-case for part of the Athenian state treasury, accounting for 44 talents of gold (that is about 2508 lbs.).

For when he first unveiled and exhibited the work, he stood behind the doors and listened to the people who criticized or praised any part. One would criticize the nose as too thick, another the face as too long, another something else. Then, when the viewers had gone away, Pheidias would lock himself in again to put right and reshape the statue, in accordance with the judgement of the majority; for he did not think that the advice of so many people was unimportant, on the contrary he thought that many people always see better than one, even if that one is Pheidias.

In short, it must be our belief that the writer of history should be like Pheidias or Praxiteles or Alkamenes or another of these men. For they certainly did not fabricate their gold or silver or ivory or other material; on the contrary, the material was there ready, provided by Eleians or Athenians or Argives, and the sculptors only modelled the ivory and sawed it and polished it, glued it, arranged it, and adorned it with gold. This was then their skill: to arrange the material as necessary. Greek text : Macleod, M. D. (1980) Luciani Opera. Vol. Ill, no. 59, section 51, 7ff. SCBO.

It lasted until the time of Theodosios the Lesser, who was the son of Arkadios.

The traditional view is that the Olympic Games were abolished by the Emperor Theodosios I in AD 393, shortly after he had ordered the closure of all pagan sanctuaries. The evidence for this, however, is now being called into question. It is clear from such places as the Parthenon and the Asklepieion in Athens that imperial decrees aimed at suppressing paganism were not effective immediately or uniformly across the empire. The repetitiveness of imperial decrees proves the point. It is quite possible, therefore, that the Olympic Games did continue beyond the date normally given for their abolition. At any rate, the temple of Zeus suffered extensive damage from fire around AD 425. This provides a firm terminus ante quem for the removal to Constantinople of Pheidias's statue of Zeus, which was preserved in the Lauseion until this was burned down in a fire in AD 475. The Olympian sanctuary was later rocked by earthquakes and landslides, and it was finally buried under layers of mud in the 6th century AD when the River Alpheios changed its course.

We know also from Pausanias, V.l 1.3, that the statue had suffered some damage by the 2nd century AD, for Pausanias comments on the fact that the eighth figure on the bar between the front legs of Zeus 's throne was completely indistinct, though he says he does not know for what reason. The Athena Parthenos suffered losses quite soon after she was completed, but whether she was entirely stripped of her gold revetment by the beginning of the 3rd century BC, as has sometimes been said, is doubtful.2077 Ô€KaTTT|xw Kepawòv : From the description of Pausanias, V.l 1.1, as well as from the evidence of coins, it is evident that the Zeus held not a thunderbolt, as Lucian says here, but rather a Nike in his right hand and a sceptre with an eagle perched on top in his left. The mistake is odd, especially in one as observant as Lucian. Compare Seneca, Contr., X.34, fecit tarnen velut tonantem. 2076 See Stewart (1990) 69ff., and, for example, Xenophon, Oec.

How he became dear also to the philosopher goddess has been proved sufficiently by his choice of the life of a philosopher, of a quality such as the account so far has revealed. But the goddess herself clearly demonstrated this when her statue - the one set up in the Parthenon until that time - was being carried away to another place by people who move even what should not be moved. It seemed to the philosopher that a certain well-dressed woman came to him in a dream and announced that it was necessary for him very quickly to prepare a residence for her in advance.

There is evidence for this in Marinos, Vita Pr. chapters X-XI. Zosimos, Hist. Nov. IV. 18.2-3, indicates that the Athena Parthenos was still in cult use in the last quarter of the 4th century AD. In his list of popular cults still flourishing in Athens around AD 390-400, Asterios of Amasea does not mention Athena at all.2086 This is perhaps, as Trombley suggests, because by this time the cult of Athena had become "largely a civic function . . . except among the professors of philosophy" and too dangerous to be celebrated publicly.2087 Although the official religion was now Christianity and many edicts had been passed to ban public sacrifice, to proscribe pagan practices and to close down the temples, it is clear that acceptance of the new religion and enforcement of the imperial decrees against the old was patchy and that Athens was one place where paganism continued to be practised and where it was tolerated much later than in other places. Some temples in the city, such as the Parthenon and the Asklepieion, remained open well into the second half of the 5th century AD. Frantz puts the tenacity of the pagan tradition in Athens down to the influence of the Neo-Platonic Academy "which continued to be a dominant factor in Athenian life until its obligatory closure in AD 529" 2088 Trombley suggests that the fear of attracting imperial disapproval may have made people more discreet in their practices after the death of Julian, but that it certainly did not put them off these practices entirely.2089 iļviKd to ayaX|ia avrr's tò kv riapGevwvi Tewç í8pu|iévov . . . ļieTecķepeTo : This passage indicates that the Athena Parthenos was still standing in the Parthenon during the life-time of Proklos.

In an attempt to crush paganism at last and quell this rebellion, Zeno probably issued the two so called quasi-Justinianic laws found in the Codex Iustinianus (the first against the endowment of schools and temples; the second providing formulae for the Christianization of the Eastern Roman Empire). Trombley thinks it highly likely that Athenian support for Illus may have occasioned such strong imperial displeasure that it was punished by the final, and relatively late, suppression of paganism in the city: the removal of the Athena Parthenos, the deconsecration of the temple and the demolition of the Asklepieion. A different interpretation of the words of Marinos was suggested by Führer, who associated with the Athena Parthenos a passage in the anonymous Acta Martyrům, Passio Philippi , 5 which tells of the burning of a statue of an armed Minerva in Athens.2096 According to Führer, the words iļviKa . . . |ieT€&lt;ļ&gt;epeTo, with the verb in the imperfect, express no more than the intention to move the statue out of the Parthenon. Thus, it was while plans were being made to move the statue that Proklos saw in a dream a vision of a beautiful woman telling him to prepare a place for Athena in his home. Marinos says no more of the matter but Führer, thinking it likely that the Passio passage refers to the Parthenos, concluded that the intention to move the Parthenos during the life-time of Proklos was never carried out and instead the Christians set the statue ablaze, probably while it was still in the Parthenon. There has been much speculation about fire damage to the temple and the statue.2097 Traces of fire damage in the Parthenon are ample and there are clear signs of alterations 209 1 Marinos, Vita Pr. XXIX, records that Proklos was introduced to Plutarch, the head of the Academy, in late AD 430 or early 431, when he was 19 years old. For the death of Proklos, see Marinos, Vita Pr. III. 2092 See, for instance, Prag (1972) 103. 2093 Trombley (1993) 78-79. 2094 Xrombley (1993) 342. 2095 Trombley (1993) 82. 2096 Führer (1892) 158-65. 2097 See Dinsmoor (1934) 93-106; Stevens (1955) 270-76, and (1961) 1-7; Leipen (1971) 18-19.</page><page sequence="208">GREEK SOURCES 859 made to the statue base in antiquity. There is little agreement, however, about the possible date of a fire, or fires, and how extensively the Parthenos had to be restored. A note by Arethas on Aristides, Or. 34.28, has been used to support the view that the Parthenos was taken to Constantinople and set up outside the Senate of the Forum Constantini. This source is of highly dubious significance and should probably not be trusted. It must therefore be admitted that Marinos provides the latest certain evidence concerning the whereabouts of the statue. Whatever happened to it at the end of or shortly after the life-time of Proklos, it cannot have remained long unscathed in the Parthenon. By the mid 5th century AD, imperial concern for the enforcement of Christianity was growing. The first surviving Christian graffito in the Parthenon, CIG , IV, 9350, dates from AD 694 and this gives a terminus ante quern for the conversion of the temple into a church. But, as Frantz points out, the deconsecration of the temple and, therefore, the removal or destruction of the cult image, is likely to have taken place long before this, for " immediate rededication would have been distasteful to Christians and offensive to pagans".2098 The Christians already had many churches at their disposal. Furthermore, the evident corrosion of the floor of the Parthenon points to a period when the building was abandoned and allowed to fall into disrepair.2099 TÒ aKivTļTd KivowTtov : This proverbial phrase can be found again in a slightly different form in Herodotus, VI. 134, for instance, in his account of the attempt made by Miltiades to plunder the sanctuary of Demeter in Paros: Vite Kivr'oovrá ti twv aKivīļTOv".

Different races, he says, use different images to symbolize their gods: the Greeks make statues in human form, for instance, while the Persians worship fire and the Egyptians worship animals. As far as the Greeks are concerned, Maximus points to the work of Pheidias as particularly important in keeping alive in people's minds the reality of god. Pheidias was renowned for his statues of gods and, above all, for his statue of Zeus at Olympia which was thought by many to be the greatest representation of the god ever made.2101 Perhaps Maximus is thinking of this statue in particular here. Maximus names Pheidias seven times in his work; Pheidias is the artist Maximus mentions most often. Like most of his references to literature, the arts, history, famous people and so on, these hark back to a time long since gone when Greek culture was at its height.

He is probably referring to another work by Pheidias here and, of Pheidias's three famous Athenas on the Akropolis, the Parthenos, the Lemnia and the 'Promachos', he is most likely referring to the Athena Parthenos, the one most often mentioned in the sources and the only one of the three which was worshipped in a temple, like the Apollo Smintheus.

But in addition the more drunken members of the crowd smashed into many pieces the statue of Athena which stood on a pedestal in the Forum of Constantine ... It stood to a height of about thirty feet, and was dressed in a garment made of the same material as the whole statue, that is, bronze. The garment went down to the feet, and was gathered in folds in several places. A warrior's belt was round her waist, binding it tightly. Over her prominent breasts she had an elaborate outer garment that resembled an aegis; it hung from her shoulders and represented the head of the Gorgon. Her neck was one part that was undraped and very long; it was a sight which brought unrivalled pleasure. . . . Her veins stood out distinctly, her whole body was supple, and, where necessary, well-jointed. ... On her head was a horse-hair crest that nodded fearfully from above. Her hair was plaited and fastened behind, while all the hair that streamed from her forehead was food for the eyes: it was not completely contained by the helmet, but some of the hair could be seen. Her left hand held up the folds of her garment, while the other, outstretched towards the south, supported her head, which was slightly inclined in the same direction, as was her gaze.

There were several ancient statues in this forum. Arethas, in a comment on Aristides, Or. 34.28, and Kedrenos, Comp. Hist. 1.565, both say that there were two statues at the entrance to the Senate House. The statue described here is a monumental standing figure (thirty feet high, but with or without its pedestal is not made clear), wearing helmet,</page><page sequence="215">866 WRITTEN SOURCES aegis and belted, ankle-length robe. The goddess is represented as youthful and very beautiful, with her supple limbs and attractive tresses of hair, some neatly braided down her back and some escaping from beneath the helmet. Her left hand held the folds of her dress, while the right was outstretched and directed towards the south. According to Niketas, the rioters had the superstitious fear that the statue was looking south towards the enemy Franks, and beckoning to them to come and attack the city, and that is why they destroyed the figure. There is no indication about authorship, though the subject of the statue and its great size suggest that the work was by a Classical sculptor. The traditional view has always been that the statue in Constantinople was the colossal bronze Athena by Pheidias.2105 Supporting evidence is sometimes sought in Tzetzes, Chil. VIII.317ff., who talks of the 'bronze Athena' of Pheidias amidst a list of works of which at least some ended up in Constantinople. Niketas makes no mention of a shield or a lance in his description but, by his time, these attributes may have become separated from the statue or lost. The lowered left arm and the outstretched right arm of his description seem appropriate for the 'Promachos', as shown on certain Roman Imperial coins, even if the interpretation given to the arm positions may not be correct. Arethas, in his comments on Aristides, Or. 34.28, attributes to Pheidias one of the two statues standing outside the entrance to the Senate of the Forum Constantini. The position of the Athena accords exactly with that given by Kedrenos, Comp. Hist. 1.565, to a statue described in the same terms as those used by Konstantinos Rhodios, Ekphr. 153ff. The statue Kedrenos and Konstantinos describe sounds fairly similar to the statue about which Niketas writes, but Kedrenos and Konstantinos specify that their statue came from Lindos. Zosimos, Hist. Nov. V.24.7-8, in the 5th century AD, says the Athena from Lindos was outside the other Senate House of Constantinople, in the square of the Augusteion. It seems doubtful that any of these sources can be linked with the passage from Niketas under consideration, despite Linfert's attempt to reconcile all the sources by suggesting that the adjective 'Lindian' was in fact a mistake for 'Lemnian' and therefore inferring that it was the Athena Lemnia of Pheidias that ended its days in Constantinople.2106 The colossal size of the statue described by Niketas remains far more suitable for the great bronze Athena, the shadowy image of which is preserved on certain Roman coins depicting the Athenian Akropolis.2107 OLYMPIODOROS, In Platonis Alcibiadem Commentari i, 26.

Just as in the case of sculptors, there are some who have succeeded in making wonderful masterpieces, for instance Pheidias or Polykleitos, (or, in the case of painters, Zeuxis and Apelles) and there are others who produce sculptures of lesser quality than these and yet others who are inferior to these two - as in a word there is a great diversity in the production of statues and images, so, in the same way, there are some who have made statues of the supreme God so beautifully and with such perfect understanding that there is no comparison between the Zeus at Olympia made by Pheidias and man fashioned "according to the image of the God who created him" . . . One can, if one wishes, compare the altars I have described with those that Kelsos talks about, and the statues inside the soul of those who have pious respect for the God of the universe, with the statues of Pheidias and Polykleitos and the like. One will see clearly that the latter are inanimate and subject to decay, while the former reside in the immortal soul as long as the reasonable soul wishes them to remain there.

Man is made in the image of God by God himself, and no human sculpture can ever hope to rival this likeness, however perfect and beautiful it is. Pheidias, Polykleitos : Orígenes chooses these two sculptors from the high Classical period of Greek art as the most perfect makers of statues. Of the two, Pheidias was the more renowned, particularly for his statues of gods.2108 2108 seCj for instance, Quintilian, Inst. Or.

According to Pliny, his floruit was 397 BC, but Quintilian dates him earlier, in the Peloponnesian War period. Apelles was a 4th century BC painter, whose floruit Pliny gives as 332 BC. 'OXu|I7tloi; Àiòs : The Zeus at Olympia was regarded as so perfect by many that it was counted as one of the seven wonders of the world. Its effect on the viewer was reported to be prodigious.2109 It even added something to ancient religion says Quintilian, Inst. Or. XII. 10.9.

Mr|Tpòç 06(jjy iepó v : Pausanias is referring to the complex Hellenistic building which faced on to the Athenian Agora, to the south of the temple of Apollo Patroos. The statue (also attributed to Pheidias by Arrian, Peripl. 9) is thought by some to be the work of Pheidias's pupil, Agorakritos.2111 Pliny admits, in NH 36.17, that Pheidias allowed Agorakritos to attach his name to several of Pheidias's works. The statue is thought to have represented the goddess seated, probably with a single lion beneath her throne. She would have worn a chiton and himation and she probably held a cymbal in one hand.2112 The early 5th century temple, situated below the northernmost room of the Metroon, which was destroyed by the Persians in 480/479 BC, was never rebuilt and the cult was transferred to the Old Bouleuterion. When the New Bouleuterion was built at the end of the 5th century BC, the Old Bouleuterion was used to house state archives, but the whole building came to be known as the Metroon because of the cult to the Mother of the gods practised there. When the Hellenistic Metroon was built - in the second quarter of the 2nd century BC - the tradition persisted, and next to the chambers devoted to the state archives was one room used as a temple, in which the cult statue was again set up.21 13 PAUSANIAS, Graeciae Descriptio, 1.14.7.

At Athens Aigeus instituted her worship. He thought he was childless, for he had no children as yet, and that evil had come on his sisters from a curse of the Heavenly one.

The Eleian statue - reputedly by Pheidias - was chryselephantine and Aphrodite was represented with one foot on a tortoise.2115 The hermaic form of the statue at the ancient sanctuary in the Ilissos valley is attested in a herm found in the Agora, and it is possible that the herm comes from that sanctuary.2116 As to Pheidias's marble statue of Aphrodite mentioned here, little can be said about its appearance or setting. The Altar of Aphrodite Ourania was found in 1981 at the north-west corner of the Agora, just across the Panathenaic Way from the Stoa Basileia. It is of island marble enclosing a limestone core, and measures 5.1m by 2.4m. Probably it dates from around 500 BC, but there are signs that it was repaired in around 440^430 BC. If, as is likely, Pheidias's statue stood in a nearby temple, this would have been situated to the west of the altar in an area that remains unexcavated.2117 PAUSANIAS, Graeciae Descriptio, 1.17.2.

G. Saur, München, Leipzig. Date : Around AD 130-150. ypacfjal : The paintings which Pausanias describes were in the sanctuary of Theseus, where the bones of the hero were laid to rest in 475 BC, after Kimon recovered them from Skyros. Pausanias says that the sanctuary was beside the Gymnasium of Ptolemy, which was below the Akropolis, probably to the east of the Agora; the Gymnasium may have incorporated the sanctuary. Its exact location is not known. Pausanias records that one of the paintings of the Theseion was the Athenian Amazonomachy. The second painting was a Centauromachy, with Theseus fighting in it, while the third was the story of Theseus and King Minos 's signet ring. Pausanias identifies the Athenian painter Mikon as the author of this third picture. Elsewhere, at 1.15.2, Pausanias states that the Stoa Poikile in the north- east area of the Agora was also adorned with an Amazonomachy showing Athenians and Theseus fighting the Amazons. The scholiast to Aristophanes, Lys. 678f., names the artist as Mikon. The painting in the Stoa Poikile probably dated from around 460 BC. The Theseion may have housed a fourth painting, perhaps alluded to in the comments Pausanias makes about the death of Theseus in the next part of this same passage, showing the recognition of the divinity of Theseus.2118 TTļi ' AGrļvai ém Tfji àamôi : According to Pausanias, the Amazonomachy which figured on the outer surface of the shield of the Athena Parthenos was, like that of the Theseion and the Zeus at Olympia, the invasion of Attica. The Greeks on the shield, as recorded on various Graeco-Roman reliefs, do seem to be on the defensive, though the figure of Theseus is not obviously identifiable. The shield is mentioned by Pliny in the passage NH 36.15-19. The west metopes of the Parthenon also showed an Amazonomachy, but it was probably not the Attic battle. The metopes seem to have been much less innovative than the shield: the Amazons were dressed as orientals, as on earlier and contemporary vases, and the designs seem to have been taken from the standard Athenian repertoire. toö 'OXu|ittíou Aiòç êm twi ßaGpüi : According to Pausanias, V.11.8, the base of the Olympian Zeus was decorated not with an Amazonomachy, as he says here, but with golden figures of the gods watching Aphrodite rise out of the sea. The confusion probably springs from the fact that battles with Amazons formed the decoration of two other parts of the Zeus composition: three of the four bars that joined together the legs of the throne (V.11.4), as well as the footstool, or thranion , of Zeus (V.11.7). Pausanias is perhaps thinking of the latter. 2118 Barron (1972) 44.</page><page sequence="223">874 WRITTEN SOURCES PAUSANIAS, Graeciae Descriptio, 1.18.6.

Toy Te vaòv aveGiļKe Kal tò ayaXjia : Pausanias discusses the temple of Olympian Zeus at Athens and its chryselephantine cult statue, which were dedicated by the Emperor Hadrian. The temple platform had been in existence since about 520 BC, but work on the temple itself was not undertaken until 174-165 BC by order of Antiochos IV of Syria. After this period, the temple stood unfinished until Hadrian's first visit to Athens in AD 124/125, when work was recommenced. It was brought to completion in AD 131. This was one of the largest temples in the ancient world, measuring 41.110m by 107.89m. Pausanias does not describe the temple, but immediately turns his attention to the cult statue of Zeus which caught his attention particularly because of its great size. He says that the statue was made of gold and ivory. It appears from coin representations that its iconography followed in general lines that of the Zeus at Olympia by Pheidias.2119 Pausanias comments upon the technical skill displayed by the work rather than any beauty it possessed. It would have been no mean task to produce so large a work in the delicate chryselephantine technique.2120 Pausanias was in a position to compare this colossus with the masterpieces of Pheidias and to judge its artistic quality accordingly. f Poôioiç kol f Pa)|iaioiç eiaìv oí koXoctœoi : The Colossus of Rhodes, which had fallen to the ground long before Pausanias' s day, and a Roman colossus - perhaps the work which gave its name to the Flavian Amphitheatre in Rome - are the two statues said to surpass in height the Zeus of the Olympieion. It seems doubtful that no other ancient statues were larger than the Olympieion Zeus, as Pausanias says. See, for instance, Pliny's list of colossi in NH 34.40-47. 2119 Imhoof-Blumer and Gardner (1885-1887) 137ff., pl. BB IV. 2120 Arafat (1996) 173-74.

Going into the temple they call the Parthenon, everything in the so-called pediment has to do with the birth of Athena; the one at the back is about Poseidon's quarrel with Athena over the land. The statue itself is made of ivory and gold. The figure of a sphinx is set on the middle of the helmet (I shall relate what is said about the sphinx when I get to my description of Boeotia) and on either side of it are represented griffins in relief. In his poem, Aristeas of Prokonnesos says that these griffins fight for the gold with the Arimaspi, the people beyond the Issedonians; the gold which the griffins guard comes out of the earth; the Arimaspi are men who are all one-eyed from birth, while the griffins are beasts that look like lions, but they have the wings and beak of an eagle. I shall say no more about griffins. The statue of Athena stands upright and wears an ankle-length chiton. On its breast there is a head of Medusa in ivory, and while on one hand it has a Nike about four cubits tall, in the other hand it holds a spear. At its feet lies a shield and near the shaft of the spear there is a serpent. This serpent could be Erichthonios. On the statue base is the birth of Pandora, worked in relief. Both Hesiod and others write that Pandora was the first woman to exist. Greek text : Rocha-Pereira, M. H. (1989) Pausaniae Graeciae Descriptio. Vol. I. Leipzig: Teubner © K. G.

He starts with the pediment of the east front, which showed the birth of Athena, fully grown from the head of Zeus, in the presence of a number gods. According to Pausanias, the west pediment showed Poseidon and Athena fighting for the land of Attica. Following Simon, Palagia proposes the idea that the composition depicted the intervention of Zeus in the dispute, when he hurled down a thunderbolt in order to recall Poseidon to order.2124 For, according to legend, Poseidon rushed to the Akropolis and hit the rock with his trident to make a salt stream flow out, while Athena arrived second and planted an olive tree. Athena's act was witnessed by Kekrops, but no-one saw Poseidon hit the rock and, in the ensuing trial before the people of Athens, Athena was judged to be the winner of the contest. In his fury at losing the trial, Poseidon flooded the Thriasian plain. Many of the figures of the pediments, in particular those of the central part of the east pediment, have been lost entirely, or survive only in fragments. The east pediment first suffered extensive damage when an apse was built at the east end of the temple, during the conversion of the building into a Christian church in the 6th century AD. The greatest damage inflicted on this building occurred in the late 17th century, when a Turkish gun powder store that was being kept in the building was hit by a Venetian shell and exploded, completely shattering the central part of the building. In an attempt to save some of the remaining pedimental figures still on the temple, Morosini arranged to have them taken down, but in the course of this manoeuvre, the horses of the west pediment were smashed to pieces. Most of the surviving pedimental pieces were collected by Lord Elgin in 1802, and subsequently housed in the British Museum.2125 to ayaX|ia : The Athena Parthenos. The term used here is the oldest to designate a cult statue in Greek.2126 This passage is Pausanias's main description of the Parthenos, though he mentions the statue again several times.2127 The information given here is far from 2122 Lykourgos, Kata Keph. 2123 Preisshofen (1977) 74ff.; see also Nick (2002) 1 19ff. and 222, Test. 65. 2124 Simon (1980) 239-55; Palagia (1993) 40 and 43. 2125 Palagia (1993) 11-12. 2126 See Nick (2002) 12ff. 2127 Pausanias, 1.17.2, the Amazonomachy on the shield; 1.25.6, Lachares stripping the image of its removable ornaments; V. 11.10, water used to keep the ivory moist; X.34.8, the statue of Athena near Elataia having a shield with a replica of the shield-design of the Parthenos engraved upon it.</page><page sequence="226">GREEK SOURCES 877 detailed and it omits most of the relief decorations, including the sandal edges with the Centauromachy and the inner and outer sides of the shield.

'i€Gui [lèv ow eTTiKčiTaí oí Twi Kpáv€i Zcjnyyos eiKxov : Pausanias mentions only the sphinx on the top of the helmet and the griffins in relief on either side. From works based on the statue it is known that the sphinx was worked in the round and supported a plume, while winged griffins were engraved on the upturned cheek pieces of the helmet, which was of the Attic type. The helmet was decorated with other adornments which Pausanias failed to mention, perhaps because they were difficult to see from ground level. à ôè éç TT)v Z&lt;ļ)iyya XeyeTcu, ypái|jü) TrpoeXGóvToç es Ta Boiomá |ioi toö Xóyou : Pausanias retums to the subject of the sphinx in IX.26.2, when he is describing Boeotia and the place where the sphinx was supposed to have had her lair, according to tradition. In this section Pausanias relates various stories about the monster. According to one tradition, she was a pirate, who was eventually captured by Oedipus. According to another, she was the illegitimate daughter of Laios who told her the oracle given to Kadmos by Delphi. She used it to test whether or not claimants to the throne of Thebes were legitimate sons of Laios, condemning to death any who did not know the answer to her famous riddle. Oedipus finally solved the riddle, whereupon the sphinx committed suicide. 'ApiciTeas ó npoKovvTļaios : He lived in the later 7th century BC and spent seven years travelling in and around the area north of Scythia. He then wrote a long poem, of which some fragments remain, in which he recounted his journey. The intended destination of his journey was the land of the Hyperboreans, but this he never reached. He was a devotee of Apollo and he believed that he was possessed by Apollo when he went on his travels.2128 robs ypÛTTaç . . . |iáx€CJ0ai TTepl toü xpuooí) cķiļaiv ' ApiļiaaTTotg : It was from the Issedonians, the people living north of the Scythians, and the furthest race Aristeas reached on his travels, that Aristeas heard the story about the Arimaspi and the griffins. In a region beyond where the Issedonians lived the soil was rich in gold, and story had it that savage men with only one eye, the Arimaspi, were constantly trying to steal the gold from monstrous creatures who kept watch over it. The story probably came to Pausanias indirectly, via Herodotus.2129 A similar story, with different characters, existed amongst the Persians, who told of Indians raiding gold that was guarded by enormous ants in the Bactrian desert.2130 The similarity between the two stories suggests that the tale is a piece of folklore that emanated originally from a central point and gradually changed its details as it spread. According to our source, the Issedonians described the Arimaspi as one-eyed 2128 See Bolton (1962). 2129 Herodotus, III. 116; IV. 13-17 and 27. 2 Í30 Herodotus, III.102ff.</page><page sequence="227">878 WRITTEN SOURCES and the griffins as winged and beaked lions. It seems likely, however, that Aristeas brought the Greek notion and name of griffin into the story as the closest image he could form of the monsters he was hearing about. The idea of winged felines was current in Greece at this time, though it may well have originated outside the Mediterranean area. It is also interesting to learn that there is a Chinese story about winged tigers in the neighbourhood of the one-eyed Kuei. The connection between griffins and Scythia seems to have originated from Aristeas 's poem. The depiction of griffins and their rivalry with the Arimaspi is seen on works by Greek artists exported to Scythia and, later, on works by local Scythian artists.2131 In the context of the Athena Parthenos, which was made from over a ton of gold, it does not seem inappropriate to show the goddess in the company of creatures associated with guarding gold: the main characteristics of griffins were speed, vigilance and ferocity. Until the time of the Parthenos, however, griffins were never associated with the goddess Athena; they were the natural companions of Apollo. r| K€(|)aXf) Méôoúcjtiç éXe^avTÓç èoriv : Pausanias states that there was an ivory gorgoneion on the breast of the Parthenos. This must have been on the goddess's aegis, though Pausanias does not refer to the aegis specifically. But see Aristides, Or. 48.41, and Maximus of Tyre, Dial. 8.6, who both mention the aegis, and also the notes to scholia Aristophanes, Pax , 605-06, where a reference by the second scholiast to golden snakes has been interpreted by some scholars as a detail about the aegis.2132 See Volume 1, chapter 6, section 2 (B), for a discussion of the aegis. Nikt]v T6 ôaov Teaaapwy ttt1xûv : Information about the Nike in the ancient sources is scanty and there exist few detailed copies of the figure.2133 The work is discussed in Volume 1, chapter 6, section 5.

It is discussed fully in the chapter on the Athena Parthenos in Volume 1. tt't1cflov toi) ôópaTos ÔpaKwv èanv : When Pausanias saw the composition, the snake at Athena's feet, and near the shaft of the spear, was coiled in the concavity of the shield, the position it occupies in a number of works based on the Parthenos, for example the Lenormant, Varvakeion, Belgrade and Patras statuettes. In this position, the large serpent would have formed a useful support for the heavy shield of the goddess, which she merely touched with the fingertips of her left hand. It has been argued that the snake was originally 2131 Bolton (1962) 181. 2132 For example, Leipen (1971) 29. 2133 It is mentioned in Pliny, NH 36.18, Arrian, Diss. Epict. II.8.20, Demosthenes, C. Tim. 121, as well as in the Parthenon Treasures inventory lists. Works which reflect the Nike include catalogue nos (6) 6, 38, 57-60, 63, 66, 68-70, 76, 92-96, in Volume 1.</page><page sequence="228">GREEK SOURCES 879 set on the right side of the goddess. This view is discussed in Volume 1, chapter 6.2 (H). Pausanias's comment, eir] 8'âv'EpixOóvioç ovtos ó Spáiaov, is probably correct for this would make the snake an important compositional feature: Erichthonios was the son of Hephaistos and Earth and he was reared on the Akropolis by Athena. He acts as Athena's guardian.2134 He also shows her "closeness to the soil of Attica".2135 The serpent, like the aegis, may have been of gilded bronze rather than of gold.2136 Less plausibly, Donnay has suggested that the serpent might have been made of ivory.2137 See notes on Tas (1&gt;oXi8as in scholia Aristophanes Pax , 605-06. twl ßdGpwi toO aya''iOLTOs ETreipyaaiievTi Ílavôíopas yéveaiç : For information about the base one has to rely on this passage, as well as Pliny, NH 36.15-19.

This suggests that Pausanias saw the two works in the area of the Propylaia, as he was leaving the Akropolis. Stevens believed that the Perikles and the Lemnia were located near the north-east corner of the east front of the Propylaia.2139 Harrison suggests that the Lemnia stood in the east porch of the Propylaia, under cover.2140 Anakreon : The portrait statue of Anakreon is often thought to be preserved in the full- length Roman copy in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, (cat. no.

When Kassander was king - my story deals only with matters concerning the Athenians - he captured the fort of Panakton, in Attica, and Salamis. He made Demetrios, son of Phanostratos, dictator of Athens, a man who had a reputation for wisdom. But Demetrios son of Antigonos, a young man who was ambitious for power in Greece, put an end to his dictatorship. Kassander however, who bore the Athenians a terrible hatred, now gained the friendship of Lachares, the leader of the people, and persuaded this man to plan a dictatorship. Of all the tyrants we know, he was the most savage towards men, and the most neglectful towards the gods. Although Demetrios, son of Antigonos, was now at variance with the Athenian people, nevertheless he brought down Lachares's dictatorship. When the walls were captured, Lachares ran away to Boeotia. Since he had taken away some golden shields from the Akropolis and had stripped the statue of Athena itself of its removable ornaments, he was suspected of being extremely rich. For this reason the men of Koroneia murdered Lachares. Greek text : Rocha-Pereira, M. H. (1989) Pausaniae Graeciae Descriptio. Vol. I. Leipzig: Teubner © K. G. Saur, München, Leipzig.

He controlled Macedonia and most of Greece; he fought against Antigonos in his bid to reunite the Empire and become its supreme ruler. Demetrios son of Phanostratos : His father was a peripatetic philosopher. Demetrios governed Athens from 317-307 BC, until Demetrios son of Antigonos liberated Athens.

Pausanias's feeling of outrage at this impious action is clearly felt in his use of the word auTÒ in this phrase. The word TTepiaipeTÒv is precisely that used by Thucydides, 11.13. 5, to describe the gold on the statue, which constituted part of the Athenian state's gold reserve and which could be used as a source of revenue if a crisis made this necessary. According to Philochoros, in the scholia Aristophanes, Pax , 605-06, there were forty-four talents of gold on the statue. This would have been used primarily to create the small plates constituting the goddess's dress. The comic poet Demetrios, apud Athenaios, Deipn. 405F, says Lachares stripped the goddess naked and Plutarch, De Is. et Os. 71, says the goddess was 'undressed'. These sources suggest that Lachares literally stripped the goddess of her golden attire. But if this is the case, when was the gold replaced? There is no mention in the sources that this ever happened and yet Pausanias himself, in the mid 2nd century AD, records that the Athena statue he saw was made of ivory and gold (1.24.5-7). In another passage, L29.16, Pausanias also specifies that Lachares plundered everything made of gold or silver provided for the public treasury by Lykourgos, who had raised a treasure of a value of about 6,500 talents in total. One might question what Pausanias means by koctjiov in this passage. Perhaps it refers to some of the goddess's jewellery and other accessories, which may have been made of solid gold and worth a considerable fortune in themselves. On the other hand, it is possible that Pausanias is mistaken in his comment here and that, like other authors, he is taking too literally the remark of the comic poet Demetrios.

If this dating is to be trusted, then the shield designs must have been a later addition to the original composition. It is possible, however, that Pliny is mistaken in his chronology. Three statue bases signed by Euenor and dating from between 490-475 BC have been found on the Athenian Akropolis, and it is possible that this sculptor was the father of the artist mentioned here.2147 Compare scholion 'C', Aristides, Or. 1.354, agalmata, where the whole work is mistakenly attributed to Praxiteles. aTTÒ Eowíou TTpoaTTXÉouaiv : The statue was visible to sailors as they came in to port from the direction of Sounion.

There were many statues of Perikles, however, so the attribution of this work to Kresilas remains uncertain.

About sixty stades from Marathon is Rhamnous, for those travelling to Oropos by the sea road. The people's houses are by the sea, but a little way up from the sea is the sanctuary of Nemesis, the most implacable of the gods towards men of wanton violence. It seems that the anger of this goddess also fell upon the foreign people who landed at Marathon; for, thinking it was certain that they would take Athens, they brought a block of Parian marble with them to make a trophy when it was all over. Pheidias carved this stone into a statue of Nemesis, wearing on her head a crown which has deer and little statues of Nike on it. In one hand the goddess holds a branch from an apple tree, and in the other - the right hand - she holds a bowl. Ethiopians are engraved on the bowl. I did not have any ideas of my own to contribute concerning the Ethiopians nor was I content to accept the convictions of those 2149 Karouzou (1961) 91 ff. For the Hermes Ludovisi, see Volume 1, chapter 17.</page><page sequence="235">886 WRITTEN SOURCES who say that the Ethiopians are carved on the bowl because of the river Okeānos, Okeānos being the father of Nemesis and the river beside which the Ethiopians live. Neither this statue of Nemesis nor any other of the ancient statues of the goddess are made with wings... But now I am going to discuss everything carved on the base of the statue, pointing out beforehand, for the sake of clarity, that Nemesis was, so they say, the mother of Helen, though Leda suckled her and reared her. Similarly they and all the Greeks believe that her father was Zeus, not Tyndareos. Pheidias had heard this and he has carved Helen being brought to Nemesis by Leda. He has also carved Tyndareos, his sons, and a man called Hippeus, standing nearby with his horse. Agamemnon is there and Menelaos and Pyrrhos, son of Achilles, who first took Hermione, the daughter of Helen, to be his wife. Orestes was passed over because of the crime he committed against his mother, even though Hermione remained with him through everything and bore him a son. Next on the plinth is someone called Epochos and another youth. I have heard nothing about these people except that they were the brothers of Oinoe from whom the deme acquired its name.

The outbreak of the Peloponnesian War meant that the temple was left unfinished, the columns remaining unfluted. Xl0ov ndpiov : The statue was made of Parian marble, as extant fragments show. The story that the Persians brought the block with them in their arrogant belief that they would beat the Greeks sounds like an invention of later times, dreamed up because of the proximity of the battlefield at Marathon.

Neiiecrewę : A large part of the head, which was found on the site in 1812, is conserved in the British Museum.2154 From fragments of the body Despinis has identified as a copy of this statue the type known in Copenhagen, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek 304a 2155 The statue was probably about 3.5m high and the base another 0.90m high. The proportions of the head are heavy and while little waves of hair adorn the front of the head, heavy braids, similar to those of the Erechtheion Karyatids, fell down over the shoulders. The goddess was shown standing holding an apple branch in one hand and a phiale adorned with heads of Africans in the other. On her head she wore a crown decorated with deer and Nikai. The idea of having animals on the crown is reminiscent of the helmet of the Athena Parthenos by Pheidias. She was draped in a long, clinging chiton and a himation which went over her left shoulder. From the style of the drapery, which is close to that of the Parthenon pedimental sculpture, Despinis dates the Nemesis statue to around 430 BC. Tcoi ßaGpwi rov áyá'p.aToç : Pausanias describes the base of the Nemesis at Rhamnous at some length, noting that it was carved with a relief decoration that showed the story of Helen being brought by her mother Nemesis to be reared by Leda. As well as these three figures, Pausanias counts another nine figures: Tyndareos, his two sons, Castor and Pollux, and Hippeus, standing with his horse, Agamemnon, Menelaos and Pyrrhos, son of Achilles, and the two brothers of Oinoe, Epochos and veaviaç eTepoç. In fact, this is the name of the second brother, Neanias, a local hero of Rhamnous. Petrakos's study of the remains of the base has revealed that there were probably nearer fourteen or fifteen figures on the base, as well as two horses.2156 The base consisted of three elements: a lower part adorned with sculpted mouldings, supporting two blocks of Pentelic marble decorated with a figured frieze, carved in very high relief, on three sides (the fourth side being left undecorated and not fully polished), and a crowning moulding made of black Eleusinian marble. Petrakos states that the statue base measured 0.90m in height, the frieze itself measuring 0.50m in height. The length of the front was 2.38/2.41m while the sides measured 1.664m long. Despinis dates the frieze to about 423 BC, that is some time later than the date of the statue. According to Petrakos, there were three human figures on each short side plus one horse, certainly on the right side, and possibly also on the left side.2157 In addition, there was one more human figure on the corners between the sides and the front of the relief. If these figures are counted with the figures of the front, there were probably eight figures in all at 2152 Zenobios, Cent. V.82 and Photios in the Suda , P.33. 2153 See Pausanias, VI.26.3, and Pliny, NH 35.54. 2154 Smith (1892) 264-65, no. 460. 2155 Despinis (1971) favours the attribution to Agorakritos. 2156 Petrakos (1981) 227ff. 2157 Petrakos (1981) 251.</page><page sequence="237">888 WRITTEN SOURCES the front, according to Petrakos. Helen occupies the place of honour on the front of the base, to the left of the central axis and Nemesis stands next to her, on the right side for the spectator. On the left side is another female figure, but she is making a bridal gesture and her head is uncovered, which would not be appropriate for Leda. Next to Nemesis is another very fragmentary female. Of the four outer figures, three are clearly male and the fourth, on the right corner is too fragmentary to be sure. On the sides the indications are that most, if not all, the figures were male and, as mentioned above, there was probably a horse on each side too.2158 Palagia suggests that the occasion for the presentation of Helen to her true mother, Nemesis, was the marriage of Helen's daughter, Hermione, to Neoptolemos, which took place in Sparta after the fall of Troy (Homer, Od ., IV, 1-14). This would account for the bridal figure next to Helen, the presence of Tyndareos, Leda, Agamemnon, Castor and Pollux, and the absence of Orestes, which Pausanias found difficult to understand. Helen's true identity as an Athenian from Rhamnous is revealed through the presence of her mother, Nemesis, along with the local heroes of Rhamnous, Epochos and Neanias. As Palagia says, Helen is shown bringing Nemesis to the Spartans and this, she claims, could be read as part of a propaganda war waged against the Spartans at the time of the Peloponnesian War.2159 The base of the Nemesis had figures going round three out of the four sides, and the figures were carved out of the marble of the base rather than being attached separately. The basic compositional scheme, which consisted in numerous figures lined up, follows that of the bases of the Athena Parthenos and the Zeus at Olympia, and several aspects of the episode chosen for depiction confirm a close relationship between the works. The story actively involves the temple deity and, while in the cases of Athena and Zeus unusual birth scenes were shown, in the case of Nemesis the unusual birth (of Helen from an egg) has already taken place and the scene depicts a time later in her life when the miraculous offspring is being presented to her mother, Nemesis. In each case the central figure is a female, and someone who brings mixed blessings to humans.2160 PAUSANIAS, Graeciae Des criptio, 1.37.1. ļjieTa 8è toû Kí1(1)iaoôòjpoi; tò ļivfļļia t60cxtttqi [lèv 'HXióôwpoç "AXiç- toútou ypa(ļ)i)v iôeîv ëcrri Kai kv tûi vaak Tak iieydXwi Tfļs 'AGrļvag.

After this, when you have gone into the precinct of Zeus, which is called the Olympieion, there is a temple which is worth seeing. But the statue of Zeus was not completed, the work being interrupted by the war of the Peloponnesians against the Athenians. In the course of this war the Athenians, by causing damage to Megarian lands each year with both their fleet and army, ruined public assets as well as reducing private households to the most terrible sufferings. The face of the statue of Zeus is made of ivory and gold, but the rest of it is of clay and gypsum. Theokosmos, a native man, is said to have made the statue, with Pheidias working with him. Above the head of Zeus are the Seasons and the Fates, and it is clear to all that Fate obeys only this god and that this god apportions the Seasons as is due. Behind the temple lie pieces of wood which are half-worked; Theokosmos intended to adorn these with ivory and gold and so finish the statue of Zeus. 2161 Levi (1979) 103.</page><page sequence="239">890 WRITTEN SOURCES Greek text : Rocha-Pereira, M.

KaXoijfievov'OXuiimeiov : The Olympieion at Megara, not far from the Artemision. to ôè ayaXjia ouk éÇeipyáaGri tov Aióç : From Pausanias's description and Megarian coins of the Imperial Age, it is known that the unfinished statue of Zeus consisted of a figure seated upon a throne, with a himation draped around its legs, the left hand holding the sceptre, the right outstretched and bearing a Nike upon it.2162 Above the head of Zeus - perhaps on the back of the throne - were the Seasons and the Fates. It is probable that the statue was an acrolith, its iconography strongly influenced by the chryselephantine Zeus at Olympia. The work was interrupted by the Peloponnesian War. We know from Thucydides, II. 3 1.1, that the first incursion into Megarian territory by the Athenians occurred in the summer of 431 BC. By this stage, the head of the statue and parts of the throne adornments were completed, and the body was well under way. So work must have started some time before 43 1 BC. The Zeus at Olympia, on which Pheidias began work in about 437 BC, would have been well advanced by the time the Megarian Zeus was under way.2163 TTpóacoTTov é'6(1&gt;avToç Kal xpuooû, Ta ôè XoiTîà ttt|Xoí) ré écrn kcù yúijjoi; : The face was made of ivory and gold, records Pausanias, and the rest of plaster and terracotta. Pausanias also saw bits of wood lying behind the temple which were half-worked and which he thought must have been intended by the artist to be covered in ivory and gold. Lapatin points to these comments as rare and valuable insights into the chryselephantine technique used at Megara.2164 He suggests that clay was used over the inner wooden armature to model the detailed form of the intended figure. But, before the final revetment of gold and ivory was added, more durable plaster moulds were probably made of all parts of the figure, and it was perhaps to this cast plaster outer core that the revetment was finally attached. This theory would explain the presence of clay and terracotta on the unfinished Zeus at Megara. Pausanias rightly says that the face was made of ivory and gold; ivory would have covered the flesh parts, while gold would have been used for the hair and beard. He was also aware that this revetment was supported on wood. Lapatin thinks Pausanias is mistaken when he says that the half-worked pieces of wood he saw lying behind the naos were probably intended to carry more of the revetment. It would have been very difficult, he thinks, to attach such pieces to the armature when the work was already so far advanced and he suggests that they were used for some entirely different purpose. It is 2162 For which see Imhoof-Blumer and Gardner (1885-1887) pl. A III. 2163 See Lippold (1950) 203; Despinis (1975) 43; Donnay (1968a) 34-35. 2164 Lapatin (2001) 72-73.</page><page sequence="240">GREEK SOURCES 891 probable that similar, though not identical techniques were used for the production of the Athena Parthenos and the Zeus at Olympia. The Athena Parthenos may have had a more finished wooden core, judging from the great expense of this single item recorded in the building accounts, and the gold, though perhaps not the ivory, may have been affixed directly to the wood. At Olympia, it is possible that a further refinement of the technique was used, perhaps in order to dispense with the need for very expensive solid gold plates such as were employed at Athens. This may have involved moulded glass and gold foil, though exactly what was done is not known for certain.

Date : Pausanias visited Messene around AD 155-160. Damophon : Damophon was the most famous sculptor of the Peloponnese in his time. According to Themelis, Damophon was active in the last decades of the 3rd century BC and the first decades of the 2nd century BC.2165 His major works consisted mostly of heroic and divine images, some of them colossal. Pausanias is the only writer who mentions this artist from Messene, but he was clearly highly regarded and very well paid. More than twelve cult statues and sculpture groups are attributed to him. All his works were commissioned by city-states and there is no evidence that he ever made portraits. 2165 Themelis (1996) 167-72.</page><page sequence="241">892 WRITTEN SOURCES Working in a manner that was traditional in Greece, he employed the Classical style for his cult statues, though his familiarity with the more modern Hellenistic baroque style is evident in his works. ayaX|ia MrļTpog Gewv : Pausanias regarded this work as the most noteworthy of all those in the Agora at Messene.

If this is true, then Damophon must have worked in Olympia towards the end of his career, when he was very famous. In VIII. 37, Pausanias writes that Damophon made the statues for the temple of Despoina at Lykosoura in Arcadia. Sculptural remains have been found on the site along with local inscriptions naming Damophon's sons. The fact that they are written in a 2nd century BC script supports the suggested date of the repairs in Olympia.2167 Pausanias says that the ivory was in need of repair because it was coming apart. Presumably the very fine joins between the pieces of ivory veneer needed to be reglued. PAUSANIAS, Graeciae Descriptio, V.10.2.

The temple and the statue to Zeus were constructed from the spoils taken when the Eleians captured in war Pisa and the other neighbouring people who joined in revolt against them.

Pausanias's statement that the temple of Zeus and the cult image by Pheidias were both financed by the Eleian victory over Pisa remains controversial. The date of the temple of Zeus at Olympia seems securely fixed between around 470^56 BC. A terminus ante quern is provided by Pausanias, V.10.4, who states that the Spartans and their allies placed a golden shield below the central akroterion of one pediment to celebrate their victory at the battle of Tanagra in 457/456 BC. The shield bore an inscription recording the victory over the Argives, Athenians and Ionians.2168 The date of the Pheidian cult image is also fairly well established, belonging to the mid 430s BC. Patay-Horváth suggests that the twenty-year interval between the construction of the temple and the cult image makes it doubtful that both projects were paid for with money from the same source.2169 He also questions the date generally given for the destruction of Pisa, of around 471 BC,2170 and suggests that a more probable date is around one hundred years earlier, that is 572 BC.2171 After the great earthquake of 373 BC, in which the temple was badly damaged, we hear from Pausanias of two important events: in 364 BC (104th Olympiad), the Olympic Games were held by Pisa and Arkadia and not by Elis (Pausanias, VI.4.2), and in 363 BC Elis set up the largest bronze statue of Zeus in the sanctuary of Olympia to commemorate its recent victory over Arkadia (Pausanias, V.24.4). Patay-Horváth concludes that the Pisan booty referred to in Pausanias, V.10.2, probably came from the 4th century BC conflict and that it was used for the reconstruction of the temple rather than its original construction.2172 Oeiôiaç Xapplôou uiòç 'A0T1vaióç |i' eTToīrļae : According to Pausanias, the inscription bearing Pheidias's name was beneath the feet of the statue. It was perhaps on the footstool. Strabo, Geogr. 8.3.30, also says that Pheidias son of Charmides made the Zeus. PAUSANIAS, Graeciae Descriptio, V.10.8. O: 825.

H. (1990) Pausaniae Graeciae Descriptio. Vol. II. Leipzig: Teubner © K. G. Saur, München, Leipzig. Date : Pausanias visited Olympia in AD 174. T òt [lèv 8iļ EļiTTpoaGev &lt;év&gt; toîç àeTotç ... : Pausanias is here describing the pedimental sculptures of the temple of Zeus at Olympia, for which see Volume 1, 320-21. Paionios : This sculptor was active in the 420s BC, as is known from the fact that he made a marble Nike at Olympia for the Messenians and Naupaktians after they fought victoriously with the Athenians against the Spartans at Pylos in 425 BC.2173 The statue would have been made and dedicated after this date, perhaps shortly after 421 BC (the Peace of Nikias). It seems more than likely, therefore, that Pausanias is wrong to attribute one side of the Olympian pedimental sculptures to this artist. The reason for his mistake may well spring from the presence of the Nike just mentioned and a misreading of the inscription on the column beneath it. There it is written that Paionios made the Nike and that his victory was to win the commission for the temple akroteria. No mention is made of the pedimental sculptures, which would have been a far greater victory.2174 As Patay- Horváth has shown, the information Pausanias transmits concerning the temple pediments is not always reliable.2175 Alkamenes : An Athenian sculptor named here as the author of the west pediment of the temple of Zeus. This attribution seems even more improbable than that for the east pediment, for Alkamenes was still at work after 403 BC, when he made a marble relief of Athena and Hera, at Thebes, for Thrasyboulos and the others who put down the Thirty Tyrants of Athens.2176 Alkamenes is generally regarded as Pheidias's pupil and sometimes as his rival.2177 In an attempt to resolve this problem, at the same time as finding a master for several other unattributed works of the early Classical period, Barron posits an elder Alkamenes, "no doubt a kinsman of Pheidias's successful pupil, perhaps his grandfather" who would have sculpted not only the west pediment of the temple of Zeus at Olympia, but also Euthydikos's kore, Akropolis Museum, no. 609/686, a statue of Hera for a temple on the road to Phaleron, mentioned by Pausanias, 1.1.5, the Blond Boy, Akropolis Museum, no. 689, and the Hermes Propylaios, (see, for example, the copy in Istanbul, no. 527).2178 There is, however, no independent confirmation of such a sculptor. 2173 For the Nike, see Boardman (1985a) fig. 139; and Robertson (1975) 287f., 349f., pl. 94d. 2174 See Barron (1984) 200. 2175 Patay-Horváth (2004) 21-33. 2176 See Pausanias, IX.l 1.6; Robertson (1975) 285, 288f.; Richter (1970) 182. 2177 See Pliny NH 36. 16. 2178 Barron (1984) 199-211.</page><page sequence="244">GREEK SOURCES 895 PAUSANIAS, Graeciae Descriptio , V. 1 1 . 1-1 0.

The god is seated on a throne and he is made of gold and ivory; on his head lies a wreath made exactly like olive shoots. In his right hand he carries a Nike, who is also made of ivory and gold, and she has a fillet and a wreath on her head. In the god's left hand there is a sceptre inlaid with every sort of metal. The bird which perches on the sceptre is the eagle. The sandals as well as the cloak of the god are made of gold. On the cloak are fashioned both small animals and lily flowers. The throne is elaborately inlaid with gold and gems, ebony and ivory; there are figures painted on it as well as images wrought in sculpture. There are four dancing Nikai on each foot of the throne and another two at the bottom of each foot. On each of the front feet are Theban children being carried off by sphinxes, and beneath the sphinxes are Apollo and Artemis shooting down the children of Niobe. Between the feet of the throne are four bars, each one stretching from one foot to the next. On the bar straight in front of the entrance, seven figures are sculpted. It is not known how the eighth figure of this group has become completely indistinct. These could be representations of archaic contests, for contests for boys had not yet been established in Pheidias's time. They say that the boy tying a fillet round his head looks like Pantarkes, an Eleian youth whom Pheidias loved. Pantarkes won the boys' wrestling competition in the 86th. Olympiad. On the other bars are Herakles and</page><page sequence="246">GREEK SOURCES 897 his armed band fighting against the Amazons. The number of people, taking both bars together, is twenty-nine. Theseus is lined up among the allies of Herakles. It is not only the feet that support the throne; there are also pillars - the same number as the feet - standing between the feet. One cannot go under the throne, as of course we went inside the throne at Amyklai; in Olympia there are barriers like walls made to keep you out. The barrier which is right opposite the doors is painted in plain blue but the rest of them have paintings by Panainos. Amongst these there is Atlas, holding up the sky and the earth, and Herakles stands by his side, eager to receive the load; and there is also Theseus and Peirithous and Hellas, as well as Salamis holding in her hand the ornament made for the bows of a ship; then there is Herakles's fight against the Nemean lion; Ajax's crime against Kassandra; there is Hippodameia, the daughter of Oinomaos, with her mother, and Prometheus still held by his chains but with Herakles brought up to him. For it is also said of Herakles, that he killed the eagle which tortured Prometheus in the Caucasus and that he released Prometheus himself from his chains. Last in the picture are the expiring Penthesileia and Achilles who is supporting her; and two Hesperides are carrying the apples that were entrusted to them according to the legend. This man Panainos was a brother of Pheidias and the picture of the Battle of Marathon in the Stoa Poikile in Athens is also by him. On the very top of the throne, above the statue's head, Pheidias has represented on one side the Graces and on the other side the Seasons, each three in number. In epic poetry these are daughters of Zeus; Homer, in the Iliad, says that the Seasons are also entrusted with the sky, like guards of the royal hall. The stool on which the feet of Zeus rest - which is called 'thranion' in Attica - has golden lions worked on it and Theseus 's battle against the Amazons, the first act of bravery performed by the Athenians against people of a different race. On the base which supports both the throne and all the other decorations which surround Zeus, there are golden figures: Helios mounted on his chariot, Zeus, Hera, Hephaistos and, next to him, Charis; after her comes Hermes and then Hestia. After Hestia comes Eros who is receiving Aphrodite as she rises out of the sea. Peitho is crowning Aphrodite. Also represented in relief are Apollo with Artemis, Athena and Herakles, and, right at the end of the base, Amphitrite, Poseidon and Selene who I think is riding a horse. Some people say that the goddess is riding on a mule and not a horse, and they tell some foolish story about the mule. I am well aware that the measurements of the Olympian Zeus, in height and breadth, have been recorded, but I shall not praise those who took the measurements; for the measurements that they give fall far short of the impression the statue creates on its spectators; indeed they say that the god himself bore witness to Pheidias's skill. For when the statue was completed, Pheidias prayed to the god to make a sign if the work was pleasing to him, and immediately a lightning flash struck the ground, so they say, at the spot which even in my day was covered with a bronze hydria. The whole of the floor in front of the statue is covered not with white but with black marble. Placed all round the black marble is a raised edge of Parian marble which helps to contain the olive oil which is poured out. For olive oil is good for the statue at Olympia: it prevents any damage being done to the ivory due to the marshiness of the Altis. On the Akropolis at Athens it is not olive oil but water which benefits the ivory of the statue they call the Parthenos. For the Akropolis is very dry because of its great height and so the statue, which is made of ivory, longs for water and the moisture which comes from water.</page><page sequence="247">898 WRITTEN SOURCES In Epidauros when I asked the reason why neither water nor olive-oil are poured on for Asklepios, the sanctuary attendants explained to me that both the statue of the god and his throne are constructed over a well.

Made presumably of wood, the throne was inlaid with several precious materials, including gold, as well as ivory, ebony, and gems, and numerous artistic techniques were used to adorn it: some parts were sculpted, others were painted, inlaid or incised. There was also a great variety of subjects depicted and almost every part seems to have been adorned. See Volume 1, chapter 1 1 for a full discussion. eirļ 8' ãv àya)VKj|iaT(i)v ktX. : This statement would appear to be either corrupt or mistaken for, according to Pausanias himself (V.8.9), boys' contests were introduced at the 37th. Olympic festival, that is in 632 BC. Concerning the correctness of the absolute date of 776 BC for the foundation of the Olympic Games, which is questionable, see Morgan.2179 Pantarkes : A youth of Eleia, whom Pheidias loved. He won the boys' wrestling competition in 436 BC, (Ol. 86). This detail helps to confirm the date provided by the workshop débris for Pheidias's stay in Olympia, when he worked on the Zeus, namely the 430s BC, after the completion of the Athena Parthenos in Athens. Apart from Pantarkes's representation here on the front crossbar of the throne of Zeus, there was also at Olympia a free-standing statue of the boy. Pausanias mentions this work at VI. 10.6, but he does not say whether he was portrayed in the same pose, tying a fillet around his head, nor does he state who made the statue. The same pose was used for another statue at Olympia by Pheidias, but in this case Pausanias, VI.4.5, says that the identity of the victor is unknown to him. A later story regarding Pantarkes is that Pheidias wrote 'Pantarkes is beautiful' on one of the fingers of the Zeus at Olympia.2180 The technique used for the crossbars of the throne is not known for certain. The figures may have been rendered in relief. Evelyn- White preferred the idea that they were made in the round and attached to the top of the crossbars.2181 2179 Morgan (1990) 47-49. 2180 So Arnobius, Adv. Nat.

Mor. 742), and on the Aphrodite (at Elis?), according to the sophist Libanios. See also Photios in the Suda , P. 33, 'Pafivoucria Neceáis, who says that Pheidias wrote 'Autarkes' and that this youth was Argive. 2181 Evelyn- White (1908) 50.</page><page sequence="248">GREEK SOURCES 899 ó Xóxoç euTÌv ó aùv 'HpaKXeî |iaxó|ievoç TTpòç 'A|ia£óvas : The two crossbars on each side of the throne showed Herakles fighting the Amazons with Theseus as his ally. Herakles was the son of Zeus and, according to one version of the myth, founder of the Olympic Games. He was also honoured in the temple metopes and on some of the screen paintings by Panainos. The version of the Amazonomachy with Herakles and Theseus fighting together seems to occur for the first time in about the 490s BC. See, for instance, the metopes of the Athenian Treasury at Delphi. avexouai òè o¿x 0&lt;L TTÓôeç p-óvoi tòv Gpóvov, âXXà Kal Kioveç : Pausanias says that pillars as well as the throne legs helped to support the statue of Zeus, and he states that the pillars were placed between the throne legs. It is not known whether the four pillars were part of the original design or whether they were added later to give extra strength. Miniature reproductions on coins never show the pillars, but then they also omit many other important details of the composition, so the evidence is not compelling. If the pillars were there primarily to strengthen and support the image then perhaps Price is right to suggest that they were placed centrally, that is, directly underneath the seat of the throne.2182 UTTeXOetv 8è oi&gt;x olov ré eoriv imò tòv Gpóvov, wcnTep ye Kai éi/Ap.ÚKXaiç : For the throne at Amyklai, see Pausanias, III. 1 8.9ff. It was made by Bathykles of Magnesia, who was a mid 6th century BC master.2183 It seems to have been an enormous throne-shaped statue base covered in intricate carvings which showed many different Greek myths, most of them very unusual and many otherwise undocumented.

Eusebios, Praep. Evang. IV.2.8, and Hieronymus, Chron. 155.17, both say that lightning struck in 52 BC. It is possible that the temple was struck by lightning on several occasions during its long history and that this caused damage within the temple, but it seems most unlikely that the statue or anything else within the temple was struck directly by lightning.

Pausanias goes on to say that in Athens water was poured out for the Athena Parthenos. Excavations at Olympia have revealed that there was indeed a sunken course, 0.12m deep, in dark Eleusinian limestone, framed by white marble in front of the statue base of the Zeus at Olympia, just as Pausanias described, though it is thought that the marble is in fact Pentelic. Evidence for the Akropolis water basin from the pavement of the Parthenon has also been found by Stevens.2185 The Parthenon naos columns rested on a course which is 0.041m (2 dactyls) higher than the level of the naos pavement. Stevens observed that, stretching to this course, there exist cuttings 0.0025m deep in the pavement in three places: on either side of the east end of the statue pedestal, approximately at the level of the outer edge of the third column, and across much of the width of the nave, at the level of the middle of the seventh column.2186 Stevens interpreted these cuttings as the remains of the east and west edges of a pool such as Pausanias describes.2187 The rim of the pool would have been added above the cuttings, probably to a height of 0.041m high to match the other two sides of the pool, which would have been formed by the course holding the naos columns. Stevens specified that the bands of dressing on either side of the pedestal were cut after the bottom course of the pedestal was put in place. This means that the Parthenon water pool was not part of the original temple design but was added some time later. ëXaiov yap tw ayaX|iaTi ecftiv 6i/OXu|iTTia au|i&lt;1&gt;épov : Pausanias states that the oil in front of the statue of Zeus served the purpose of protecting the ivory of the statue from the excessive dampness of the Altis, while in Athens the water protected the ivory of the Athena Parthenos from the excessive dryness of the Akropolis. Pausanias 's description of the floor of the temple of Zeus at Olympia and the archaeological remains of both the temple of Zeus at Olympia and the Parthenon prove that the temples did have basins, and in each case the basins were added some time after the temple was constructed. In the case of the temple at Olympia it appears that the basin was contemporaneous with the Pheidian chryselephantine image, whereas in the case of the Parthenon, it appears to have been 2185 Stevens (1955) 267-70. 2186 Stevens (1955) 267ff. 2187 Stevens (1955) 508-09.</page><page sequence="250">GREEK SOURCES 901 added some years after the image was completed. What the basins contained and what their purpose was is not known for certain. The needs of the ivory and the wooden framework within the revetment make it likely that oil was used to protect both the statues. Olive-oil was probably rubbed on the ivory and it is possible that there was also a system of tubes inside the statue which fed its wooden framework, as Levi suggested.2188 A damp atmosphere was probably better for the statues also. Pausanias, VII.27.2, says that the damp air in the temple of Athena at Pellene was good for the ivory of Pheidias's chryselephantine work there. It is possible that the pool in the Parthenon was added not long after the inauguration of the statue, when problems with its ivory and woodwork started to appear. Although not dry in the winter, the Akropolis is extremely dry in the summer, and this great change in humidity levels may have prompted the idea of a shallow water basin. Why then was there oil in the pool in front of the Olympian Zeus, as Pausanias says? Boardman suggests that it was in fact a water pool that had become oily by Pausanias 's day and that the guides gave Pausanias a confused account of its use.2189 Levi suggested that the system of tubes within the statue eventually brought the oil out into the pool in front of the statue. The pool in front of the Olympian Zeus may have been inspired by the secondary use of the pool of water on the Akropolis, as a reflective surface for the great statue.2190 Kai to ayaXfia to€ Geoû Kai ó Gpóvoç em (ķpeaTi eīiļ TreTToiTļ|ieva : When Pausanias asked his guides why neither oil nor water were poured out for the chryselephantine Asklepios at Epidauros, they told him the statue was situated over a well. This last statement is untrue, for the foundations of the temple are preserved and there is no well in the vicinity. The excavations of a Classical Doric temple at Pellene, which is thought to have housed another chryselephantine statue possibly by Pheidias (see Pausanias, VII.27.2), have not revealed any signs of the underground structure that was said by the local guides to provide damp air for the ivory of that statue.

The very fact that Pheidias won the important commission for the Zeus at Olympia seems to provide sufficient evidence that Pheidias was highly welcome in this part of Greece.2191 From other evidence it seems that Pausanias' s text should be interpreted somewhat differently. The matter is discussed at some length by Donnay whose arguments we summarize.2192 Firstly, it is not clear that Pausanias 's spelling of the word (1)ai8pwTai is to be trusted. An inscription from Olympia {IvO 466) uses the word 4&gt;ai8wn1ç as the title for a descendant of Pheidias, and this word is found again in other inscriptions, mentioned below. So is the latter the correct spelling, and Pausanias's spelling a corruption under the influence of the word (1&gt;ai8pi3veiv? The first recorded &lt;1)ai8wTT1ç is someone called T. Flavius Heraclitus, of the time of Hadrian (. IvO 466), to whom the Eleians set up a statue 'for his piety towards the gods and his generosity towards themselves'. It is also in Hadrian's reign that the first (1)cu8wtt1ç of the Olympian Zeus at Athens appears as well as the cķaiSuvTTļs toi v 0e[oiv] of Eleusis.2193 These are the only attested phaidyntai, and it seems probable that they were all established by Hadrian, none of them going back any further than this. From other inscriptions it is clear that the phaidyntai of Athens and Olympia both had reserved seats at the Theatre of Dionysos at Athens.2194 Since there was just one seat for the Olympian phaidyntes, it suggests that the title was held by no more than one person at any time. The fact that the theatre seat was more central than that of his colleague from the Olympieion seems to indicate that the Olympian phaidyntes was considered as more important than the one from the Athenian Olympieion. Pausanias's comment that the Olympian phaidyntes sacrificed to Athena Ergane before setting to work further suggests that the role of the phaidyntes was more ritual than practical in nature. Were the phaidyntai really descendants of Pheidias, as it was claimed? The only known successor of T. Flavius Heraclitus is Ti. Claudius 2191 Note the scholia to Aristophanes, Pax , 605-06, and the very unlikely idea that the Eleians accused Pheidias of embezzlement and executed him. 2192 Donnay (1963) § 166. 2193 For the phaidyntai of Athens and Eleusis, see IG II2 4075, 4 and IG II2, 1078, 16 (dating to around AD 220). 2194 ig II2, 5064; 5072.</page><page sequence="252">GREEK SOURCES 903 Patroclus of Lamptrai, the eponymous archon of Athens between AD 203/204 and 211/212.2195 This man, at any rate, cannot possibly have been a direct descendant of T. Flavius Heraclitus. It therefore seems doubtful that a direct line could be traced back to Pheidias. Since the honorary title of phaidyntes appears to be a late creation, and one applied to people of Athenian origin, it seems unlikely that Pheidias 's family settled in Elis and gained citizenship there.

He was an Eleian youth whom Pheidias is said to have loved. See V.l 1.1-10 for notes. Yet in this passage Pausanias specifically says that he does not know who is represented in the statue. He mentions the statue purely because of its artistic importance. The Anadoumenos of Pheidias is not mentioned elsewhere in the sources. It was probably made of bronze, the usual material for athlete statues in the 5th century BC. A likely date for its creation is in the mid or late 430s BC, when Pheidias had left Athens and was living in Olympia, where he had been commissioned to make the chryselephantine Zeus.

At the beginning of Book VI (chapter 1 .2), Pausanias says that he does not intend to list all the athlete statues standing at Olympia, but only those of importance either because of the distinction of the victor portrayed or because of the quality of the sculpture itself. It seems likely, in view of his comment on the anonymous statue mentioned in VI.4.5, that if the statue in question had been the work of Pheidias, Pausanias would have said so.</page><page sequence="254">GREEK SOURCES 905 PAUSANIAS, Graeciae Descriptio, VI.25.1.

Her precinct is surrounded by a wall and inside the precinct a platform has been constructed on which there is a bronze statue of Aphrodite sitting on a bronze goat.

The much later writer Psellos, Pros Poth. 9, records that the eyes of the statue were inlaid with black stone. According to a scholiast's note, concerning Clemens Alexandrinus, Protrep. IV.53.4, Libanios had said that the famous graffitto by Pheidias about Pantarkes was on his statue of Aphrodite.2198 This may be another reference, however unhelpful, to Pheidias 's most famous Aphrodite statue, the chryselephantine Ourania. The latest known reference to an Aphrodite statue by Pheidias, which again is fairly unhelpful, occurs in a scholiast's note on a passage in Gregorios of Nazianzos.

Pliny adds that Panainos painted the inner surface of the goddess's shield. Pausanias 's turn of phrase sounds somewhat hesitant here, with the use of the word cķacrīv, and the attribution to Pheidias is not supported by any other source. It seems probable that Pliny's statement is correct for two reasons: firstly, Kolotes worked in the area of Elis and, secondly, Kolotes is known to have worked in the chryselephantine medium. Pliny, NH 34.87, says that Kolotes helped Pheidias with the Zeus at Olympia and Strabo, Geogr. 8.3.4, says he made a chryselephantine Asklepios for the little town of Kyllene, the harbour of Elis and 120 stades distant from Elis. tò äya'[ia . . . àXeKTpuwv ém twi Kpávei : The cock on Athena's helmet may well have reinforced the goddess's image as a fighter, as Pausanias seems to be suggesting. In connection with Athena, cocks are often seen perching on top of Doric columns on either side of the goddess on black-figure Panathenaic vases. See, for example, the vase by the Kleophrades painter.2200 In such cases the cocks are generally thought to represent the spirit of competition. But cocks may well have another significance, as Simon has suggested.2201 As a common love-gift of older men to boys, and in particular of Zeus to Ganymede, cocks on Panathenaic amphorae probably refer to Zeus, Athena's father, who 2199 See Delivorrias in LIMC II (1984) 100, nos. 975-76, and Papachatzi (1979) figs. 369-70. 2200 Boardman (1974) fig. 301.2. 2201 Simon (1978) 1415, 5. v.

Both Zeus and Athena were city divinities and while Athena was worshipped on the Akropolis of Athens as Athena Polias, Zeus was worshipped as Zeus Polieus. Simon suspects that the cock columns refer to the sanctuary of Athena on the Akropolis, the ultimate destination of the Panathenaic procession. As Athena Ergane, the goddess promoted arts and crafts, especially weaving and pottery. Pausanias, 1.24.3, states that the Athenians were the first to honour Athena with the title 'Ergane'. Ridgway suggests that the iconography of a spinning Athena, as seen, for instance, in the Scornavacche terracotta relief, would have been very appropriate for Athena Ergane.2202 The goddess is there represented seated. She wears an Attic helmet with raised cheek-pieces. In her raised left hand she holds a distaff. The cult of Athena Ergane is well attested in the 4th century BC and, on the basis of the Scornavacche relief, it has been thought not to predate Periklean times. Ridgway, however, disputes this view, pointing to the evidence of Archaic representations of a spinning Athena, which she also identifies as Athena Ergane.

It was probably good for the wooden framework of the statue too. Whether or not there really was an underground 'adyton' beneath the statue, as Pausanias's guides told him, is not certain. Pausanias himself did not see it, and the temple excavated at Pellene - which may or may not be the temple in question - has no such feature. In V. 11.10, Pausanias comments that when he asked the local guides why the Asklepios at Epidauros had no need for a water pool in front of it, they told him it stood above a well. This has proved to be untrue. In the same passage, Pausanias also writes of the humid conditions of the Altis at Olympia, with reference to Pheidias 's chryselephantine statue of Zeus at Olympia, and contrasts this to the dryness of the Akropolis, home to the Athena Parthenos. It is probable that there was a water basin in front of the Parthenos in order to maintain a high humidity level throughout the year. See Volume 1, Athena Parthenos, section 7, concerning the setting of this statue. In front of the Zeus at Olympia there was also a shallow pool, but it was filled with oil, according to Pausanias. The exact purpose of</page><page sequence="258">GREEK SOURCES 909 the oil is not known, but several reasons have been suggested. These are discussed in the notes to Pausanias, V.l 1.10.

The Plataians have a sanctuary of Athena of War. It was built from the spoils that were assigned to them by the Athenians from the battle of Marathon. The statue is made of gilded wood, but the face and the ends of the hands and feet are made of Pentelic marble. The size is not much less than that of the bronze on the Akropolis, which the Athenians</page><page sequence="259">910 WRITTEN SOURCES dedicated as their first offering for the contest at Marathon. It was Pheidias who made the statue of Athena for the Plataians as well as for the Athenians. There are also paintings in the temple: by Polygnotos there is Odysseus after he has killed the suitors, and by Onasias there is the earlier expedition against Thebes of Adrastos and the Argives. These paintings are on the walls of the pronaos, and at the feet of the statue is an image of Arimnestos; Arimnestos led the Plataians in the battle against Mardonios and previously at Marathon.

The honouring of Arimnestos, with a likeness set at the foot of the statue of the goddess, mentioned later on in this passage, suggests a connection between the sanctuary of Athena at Plataia and Marathon, as Pausanias says, for Arimnestos was the leader of the Plataians both in 479 BC, at the battle of Plataia, and in 490 BC, at Marathon. His role in 490 BC was exceptional, since no other Greeks besides the Plataians came to help the Athenians. Plutarch, Ar. 20, however, says that the sanctuary, the paintings which adorned it and the statue of Athena were paid for with the spoils from the battle of Plataia (479 BC), a sum of precisely 80 talents. The two statements may be complementary, for while the description of the statue and the wall paintings point to a date somewhere between 479-460 BC for their creation, it is not known whether the Plataian sanctuary was founded or just rebuilt after 479 BC. There may have been an earlier sanctuary on the same site, financed, at least in part, by the spoils from Marathon. to [lèv òri ayaXjia £óavóv éanv émxpucrov ktX. : Concerning the acrolithic image of Athena at Plataia, see Volume 1, chapter 4.

Plutarch makes no mention of the name of the sculptor. But such a commission would seem to tie in quite well with what is known of Pheidias 's other activities. Both Pausanias and Plutarch agree in implying that the temple building, the paintings and the statue of Athena were all created at about the same time. Pausanias goes on to attribute the temple paintings to two artists: Onasias, who is otherwise unknown, and Polygnotos, the most famous painter of the early Classical period. According to Meiggs, Polygnotos returned to his native Thasos in the 450s BC.2205 He undoubtedly had close 2204 Concerning this sanctuary, see de Ridder (1920) 160-69 and Lauffer (1989) 555. 2205 Meiggs (1972) 277, 573.</page><page sequence="260">GREEK SOURCES 911 links with Kimon, and he was at his most creative during the second quarter of the 5th century BC. Pheidias must have been well acquainted with the works of Polygnotos.2206 He too worked for Kimon, on the Marathon monument at Delphi. Since Pheidias was busy in Athens during the 450s BC, producing the great bronze Athena, he may have created the Plataian acrolith somewhat earlier.2207 PAUSANIAS, Graeciae Descriptio, IX. 10.2.

These heroes gave their names to the tribes of Athens, in accordance with an oracle from Delphi. There are also Kodros, son of Melanthos, Theseus and Philaios, who are not yet eponymous heroes.

The statue was positioned very near the entrance of the sanctuary of Delphi, and Pausanias includes it in his description after his mention of the Bronze Bull by Theopropos of Aigina, the Tegean dedications and the Lysander Monument. The bronze bull is the first sculpture mentioned by Pausanias. Its position on the right hand side at the sanctuary entrance is known for certain because Pausanias states that the Tegean Monument came next (ec^eÇfjs), and the Tegean Monument remains in situ. Opposite the Tegean Monument (airavTiKpij), and, therefore on the left side of the Sacred Way, was the impressive multi-figure monument set up by the Spartans after Aigospotamoi at the end of the 5th century BC. Then Pausanias mentions the Horse of Troy and, below it (íjttò tòv ittttov), the Miltiades monument. The Miltiades Monument must have stood, therefore, close to the sanctuary entrance when Pausanias saw it, on the left side of the Sacred Way, to the south-east of the Horse of Troy and to the south of the Lysander Monument. The position and the size of the Lysander Monument were such that the Spartan monument must have hidden the Athenian monument at least partially from the view of arriving visitors.2209 No traces of the base of the Miltiades Monument, which was probably long and narrow, can be found in the location given by Pausanias.

He states that the statues were dedicated from the spoils of Marathon, a point he later repeats. He also affirms that the original group of thirteen statues, not counting the Hellenistic additions, was made by Pheidias. This has led scholars to the view that the group was set up many years after the battle of Marathon, which happened in 490 BC, perhaps around 465 BC. At this time Pheidias, in about his mid twenties, would have been old enough to take on a major commission, and Kimon, the son of Miltiades, would have been at the height of his power. tqç e'iKÔvaç : According to Pausanias, the statue group comprised sixteen figures of which thirteen were by Pheidias. The last three figures, added to the group much later, represented the three eponymous kings of the tribes created in the Hellenistic period: Antigonos Monophthalmos, Demetrios Poliorketes and Ptolemaios III.

Pausanias provides the important information that this statue of Athena, who was depicted armed ready for battle, had a shield which copied that of the Athena Parthenos in Athens. As is clear from the Piraeus reliefs and several small versions of the whole shield, the Amazonomachy of the outer surface of the Parthenos shield was highly admired.

Epigram 81 : Mango draws attention to the similarities between this poem and a poem written by Nikephoros Kallistos, a Byzantine author writing in the 14th century AD.2216 Concerning the mosaic of Christ by the 12th century painter Eulalios, in the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, Nikephoros writes, 'Either Christ himself came down from heaven and showed the exact form of his features to him who had such expressive hands, or else the famous Eulalios ascended into the sky itself and with his skilled hand accurately delineated the appearance of Christ' (translation Mango). This piece of writing is a fascinating example of what Mango terms "the fossilization of artistic criticism" in the Byzantine period. Artistic excellence is equated with the ability to render in artistic form a perfectly lifelike appearance or, as in this case, an imagined appearance which exactly fits people's vision of an unseen being. This was precisely the standard used by the ancients when assessing their art, and it seems strange that the Byzantines should apply the same standard to an art which was far from naturalistic and clearly not in the same tradition as that of Pheidias and -the great artists of Classical Greece. It shows that the Byzantines had a very different view of their own art. See also Photios, Horn.

Kronos is the father of Zeus in heaven, but Pheidias is his father in Elis. For immortal nature created the former, while the hands of Pheidias which alone are able to produce gods created the latter. He is blessed who alone has seen the king of the universe and who has been able to reveal to others the lord of the thunderbolt. If Zeus is ashamed to be called 'of Pheidias', the mother of his image is art. It was for this reason that nature produced elephants, and that Libya is rich in herds of elephants, so that Pheidias could cut the tusks of the beasts and fashion the material for his creation. And so, whereas we only marvel at the rest of the seven wonders, this one we worship. As a work of art it is marvellous, as the image of Zeus it is also holy. Greek text : Hercher, R.

Generally, there is little agreement between ancient authors about what the seven wonders were, but the Zeus at Olympia features in many lists.2217 [laKapios ó Kai 0eaaá|i€vos ktX. : The idea of seeing Zeus and being able to reveal him to others is found elsewhere, but it is usually said of Homer.2218 Pheidias is more generally thought of as imagining Zeus and then revealing him through his art.2219 2217 See for example, Gregorios of Nazianzos, Anth. Pal. 8.177; Cassiodorus, Var. VII. 15; Hyginus, Fab. 223; Vibius Sequester, Septem Mira. For the Zeus at Olympia, see Pausanias V. 11.1-10 and Volume 1 , chapter 1 1 . 2218 For example, Strabo, Geogr. 8.3.30; Eustathios, Ad.

They say that the sculptor Pheidias made his statues using bronze, ivory and gold, and other diverse materials, and that in all of them he showed the signs of one and the same art, so that not only the connoisseurs but also the totally ignorant could recognize the craftsman by his works. For just as nature often stamps twins with the same imprint and fashions almost perfect similarities, in the same way too ideal art, being the imitation and copy of nature, takes different materials but models and imprints the same character on all, so that the products of this art, mostly for this reason, are relations, brothers, twins.

In gold and ivory, he made the Zeus at Olympia (Pausanias, V.l 1.1-10), the Athena Parthenos (Pausanias, 1.24.5 and Pliny, NH 36.18), the Aphrodite Ourania at Elis (Pausanias, VI.25.1) and the Athena of Pellene (Pausanias, VII.27.2).

Lucretius, De Rer. Nat. 6.749ff., says that the place avoided by birds was at the temple of Athena Tritonis. Philostratos seems to be suggesting that there was some sort of device, probably in front of, rather than in, the Parthenon temple, which destroyed birds that attempted to fly too close. Compare Ausonius, Mos. 309-310, who says that there was an owl, covered in magical paint. It is perhaps safe to infer that there was some sort of scarecrow on the Akropolis, in the form of an owl, presumably meant to keep birds away from the sacred monuments to stop the birds from fouling them. It was probably close to the Parthenon and it may have been set up at about the same time. PHILOSTRATOS, De Vita Apollonii Tyanei , IV.7.

He is telling the people of Smyrna to be more proud of themselves than of the beauty of their city, however great that may be, and he compares it to the statue which in antiquity was regarded as one of the most beautiful ever made: the Zeus at Olympia of Pheidias. For whereas buildings and cities can only be admired if people come to them, rather like statues, great men can be seen and heard wherever they travel. Men can bring great fame to their city by their words and deeds. toü 'OļiTļpeiou Aios : It is often repeated in the sources that Pheidias's Zeus was the perfect embodiment of Homer's picture of Zeus as described in II.

Apollonios, however, expresses the view that the art of the poet is far superior to that of the sculptor, which can create but one limited vision that leaves nothing to the imagination.

Thespesion (getting angry): And how do you say statues are made amongst your people? Apollonios: As beautifully and as devoutly as is necessary to make gods. Thespesion: You are referring, I suppose, to the Zeus at Olympia and the statue of Athena, and the Knidian and Argive goddesses, and whichever other ones are equally beautiful and graceful. Apollonios: Not only these, but I say once and for all that the sculptural art of other races grasps what is appropriate, but you mock the divine rather than believe in it. Thespesion: These Pheidiases and Praxiteleses, did they go up to heaven and copy the images of the gods before they made their likenesses? Or was there something else which guided them in their modelling? Apollonios: There was something else, something imbued with inspiration. Thespesion: What sort of thing was this, for you could not mean anything other than imitation, could you? Apollonios: With imagination the artist produced works that were more inspired than pure imitation. For imitation will produce what has been seen, whereas imagination will also produce what has not been seen, for it will presuppose its ideal with reference to the reality, and while terror often drives back imitation, nothing stops imagination; for it advances without fear to the goal it has itself laid down. When pondering on the idea of Zeus, it is necessary to picture him with heaven and seasons and stars, as Pheidias tried to do in his day, and if one intends to create a figure of Athena, then one must think of armies and cunning and crafts, and how she sprang up from Zeus himself.</page><page sequence="271">922 WRITTEN SOURCES Greek text : Kayser, C.

Thespesion and Apollonios : Thespesion is an Egyptian wise man and he is discussing with Apollonios the difference between the animal form of the Egyptian gods and the human form of the Greek gods, which Apollonios says are much more beautiful and dignified. tòv Aia TTOu Xéyeis, e'iTTe, tòv év Tfj'OXup.ma Kai tò TÍjç' A0T]vâç éôoç Kal tò tí1ç Kviôiaç T€ Kaì tò Tfjç' Apyeíag : Thespesion presumes that Apollonios is thinking of the following works as the greatest Greek statues of the gods: the Zeus at Olympia and the Athena Parthenos of Pheidias; the Knidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles; and the Hera at Argos of Polykleitos. Apart from the Aphrodite, which was in marble, the usual material of this artist, the rest were all chryselephantine statues. Of these works, those of Pheidias won the greatest renown and admiration amongst the ancients. The Zeus at Olympia, described by Pausanias, V. 11.1-10, was often listed as one of the seven wonders of the world. See, for instance, Philon of Byzantion. oí Oêiôiai 8e, eiTTe, Kai oí ripaÇiTÉXeiç : Pheidias and Praxiteles are often mentioned together, as the finest sculptors of the high and late Classical periods in Greek sculpture. See, for instance, Lucian, Gallus. 24. The artists are named in the plural presumably because the writer wants to convey the idea of Greek art in general, rather than discuss particular artists. The names are used as nomina excellentiae. This becomes a motif which is often repeated in Byzantine sources. It is as if the whole of ancient Greek art was seen by the Byzantines as a homogeneous unit, with the names of famous artists simply being put into the plural, in this manner, to illustrate its chief exponents.2221 |JL(I&gt;v dveXGóvTeç éç oúpavòv Kai áuo|ia£á|j,evoi Ta tûv 0ewv eiSrļ . . .ktX. : The following passage is a discussion about how these artists succeeded in creating such excellent images of the gods, and the idea that great art is not simply a question of |ií|iT1CFiç, imitation, but rather of (ķavraoia , imagination or intuitive insight. Short of going up to heaven and seeing the gods face to face, in order to then copy their image, as Thespesion suggests, these great artists must have had some spiritual insight into the divine nature they were seeking to portray, as well as the skill to transform this insight into a physical object which could be appreciated by others. For this theory of Greek art, which viewed Pheidias as the culminating point in its development, see Pollitt.2222 Pollitt calls this the 'phantasia' theory and he writes, "It was felt that Pheidias, above all other Greek artists, carried art beyond the simple representation of external nature, and used it, 2221 See, for instance, Photios, Horn. X.ii.433; Gregorios Naz., De Theol. 25.17; Konstantinos Manasses, Deser. Im. I.e. 75; and compare Christopher of Mytilene, XLII.59.33 (ed.

This evidence, however, does not fit with Pausanias's accounts elsewhere: in 1.24.5-7, Pausanias makes it clear that in his day the Athena Parthenos still had her gold ornament and in 1.29.16, he says that Lachares stole gold and silver treasure belonging to the Athenian public treasury. This treasure formed part of the 6,500 talents amassed by Lykourgos.

And so it is perhaps best to capture his nature in a portrait, to imitate the example of Pheidias. Pheidias was not ignorant of how great Zeus was, nor of how great were those around him, for his soul was wiser than his hands were dextrous. And so, wanting to capture the nature of Zeus in a statue, he mixed ivory with gold, and in a single image he portrayed, as far as it was possible to do so, the one who for the Eleians is the Olympian and for other men is Zeus.

Pheidias and Praxiteles are often named together in the ancient sources.2225 Photios, writing in the 9th century, talks as if the art of his generation were more highly developed than that of the Greeks but nevertheless continuing directly in the tradition of Pheidias and the other Classical Greek artists he mentions. In his day there was not a great deal of interest in ancient art and on the whole the comments one finds are not very favourable (as here or, for instance, Konstantinos Rhodios, Ekphr.).

Both these names were regularly used of the temple from at least the mid 4th century BC, though Plutarch alone uses them together. The Periklean Parthenon measured well over double one hundred feet in length and, although the term 'Hekatompedos' came to designate the whole building, it 2238 Farnell (1971) 674. 2239 Rouse (1902) 382.</page><page sequence="285">936 WRITTEN SOURCES was at first reserved for the great east chamber of the temple, which did measure approximately one hundred feet. A little earlier in this passage, Plutarch says that the Athenians were famous for temples costing a thousand talents, vaoi xi^lOT^avTOi' Stanier explains this expression as anti- Periklean propaganda, and states that not even the Parthenon could have cost that amount of money.2240 He regards Heliodoros's statement, quoted by Harpokration (FGrHist. 373 Fl), that the Propylaia alone cost 2012 talents, as completely unreliable. For comparison, he notes that the temple built at Delphi by the Alkmaionids in the 6th century BC cost 300 talents (Herodotus, 11.180). Bearing in mind that this temple was built much earlier than the Parthenon and made mostly of limestone, it was an expensive temple to build. But high costs would have been incurred both by the use of Parian marble for the façade and the great expense of getting the stone to the building site. Stanier' s own estimate for the cost of the Parthenon is around 500 talents, though he says that he would not be surprised if the Parthenon in fact cost "well over" that much.2241 The temple image is known to have cost between 700 and 1,000 talents. But the cost of other Periklean projects is very difficult to ascertain from existing evidence. Blamire suggests that Heliodoros may have been quoting from an official record and that the sum of around 2,000 talents which he mentions refers to the total sum spent on the Akropolis building project. This might tally with Thucydides, II. 13.3, who implies a total expenditure of around 3,700 talents for both the Periklean building programme and other projects, including expenses at Poteidaia. As Blamire points out, the sum of 3,000 talents is mentioned in the first Kallias decree, though this document remains very controversial.2242 PLUTARCH, De Gloria Atheniensium, 8 (Stephanus, 351a). . . . ôao) XPÓvo) T(* TTpoTTuXaia nepiKXÍ1ç aveaTTļcre Kai toùç eicaToiiTTeóouę. ... in as long a time as it took Perikles to build the Propylaia and the one hundred feet long temples.

Again, when there is agreement about what was done, but the reason why it was done and the intention are not clear, the writer who conjectures the meaner explanation is unkind and malicious - like the comic poets who represented the war as being set ablaze by Perikles because of Aspasia and Pheidias, rather than because he was ambitious and competitive and he wanted to crush Peloponnesian arrogance and not give in one inch to the Lakedaimonians.

In Ach. 515-529, Aristophanes says that trouble between the Megarians and the Athenians came to a head when the Megarians stole two women working as prostitutes for Aspasia. In Per. 32.1, Plutarch states that Aspasia's prosecutor was the comic poet Hermippos and in Per. 24 and 31-32 Plutarch does not refute the allegation that Perikles started the war in order to detract attention away from himself in the light of the charges being made against his friends. Here, however, he appears dismissive of these claims and suggests that the real cause of the war was Perikles 's ambitious and contentious desire not to give in to the Spartans. This reason for the war is also given in Per. 31.1.</page><page sequence="287">938 WRITTEN SOURCES PLUTARCH, De Iside et Osiride , 71 (Stephanus, 379c).

The Athenians showered honours on him and even allowed him to lodge within the Parthenon temple, an act which Philippides, apud Plutarch, Dem. 26, saw as gross irreverence. This episode is recounted also by Diodorus, Bibl. Hist. XX. 110. Demetrios Poliorketes apparently justified his action by claiming that he was the younger brother of Athena. He even had gold coins minted on which the head of Athena had his own portrait superimposed on the face. Plutarch says that the place Demetrios stayed in was the opisthodomos of the temple. It is probable that he is referring to the large west chamber of the temple, which measured some 250m2, but what exactly this chamber was called by the Greeks is not known for certain.

Pericles, 12 : Plutarch here lists all the materials and workers involved in Perikles's building programme in Athens, which started after the mid 5th century BC and was funded by surplus revenue from the Delian League. From an Athenian point of view, the justification for the building programme, as explained in this passage and in what follows, was that the wealth could thus be spread amongst all types of workers and not just amongst soldiers and sailors. In this way, all Athenians could earn their share of the wealth, while at the same time bringing immortal fame to Athens. From the point of view of the Delian League, the justification seems to have been that as long as Athens assured military safety, then she was free to spend the resources of the League at her own discretion. Around the mid century the alliance changed in character, since Athens now claimed to determine its action. Wade-Gery and Merritt commented: "This change was chiefly the work of Perikles, whose influence was strong through most of the third quarter of the century. He argued (it seems) that Athens's obligation was to assure the alliance's defense, and that this could not be done without a revenue from the allies: if the defense was assured, Athens could use the revenue (and its accumulations) as she judged fit."2246 XlGoç, xakKÒSi eXé(1)as, xpuaóç, eßevos, Kirrrdpiacjos : A list of the raw materials of the building project, of which the one used in greatest quantity was stone.

As the buildings went up, conspicuous for their size, and inimitable in their beauty and grace, and as the workmen vied to surpass their workmanship with their artistic skill, the most amazing aspect was the speed of execution. For they thought that, with many successions and ages of men, each one of the works would with difficulty reach completion, but they were all accomplished in the height of one man's administration. And yet they say that once when the painter Agatharchos was boasting about the speed and ease with which he created animals, Zeuxis heard him and said, "It takes me a long time." For, ease and speed in execution do not endow the work with lasting weight and exactness of beauty, but the time invested beforehand in effort put towards a production pays back as interest the force which preserves that which is produced. It is for this reason that the works 2249 Flacelière and Chambry (1964) 28 n. 1.</page><page sequence="293">944 WRITTEN SOURCES of Perikles are even more admired, being made in a short time to last long. For in its beauty each work was at once ancient, even at that time, and yet in its vigour even to this day the work looks freshly executed and new; so it blooms with a sort of newness always, which protects its appearance from the touch of time, as if these works had an ever-green spirit and an ageless soul mixed together. The man who directed all the work and who was Perikles' s overseer for everything was Pheidias, although the various projects were executed by great architects and artists. For Kallikrates and Iktinos built the Parthenon . . . But it was Pheidias who executed the golden image of the goddess and he has his name inscribed on the stele as the artist of this work. Everything was virtually under his charge and, as I said, he oversaw all the craftsmen, because of Perikles's friendship for him. And this is what led to jealousy against Pheidias, and slanderous stories about Perikles, to the effect that, for Perikles, Pheidias entertained free-born women who would come regularly to 'see the constructions'.

The chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos, which was probably started at about the same time as the Parthenon in 447/446 BC, was dedicated in 438 BC at the Great Panathenaea. udvTa 8è ôieiTTe Kai uávTwv ¿ttlokottoç iļv auTto Oeiôías : Plutarch states that, as well as creating the Athena Parthenos, Pheidias was also Perikles's chief supervisor for the building programme, directing all the work and overseeing the artists and workmen. He says that he was given this important position because of his friendship with Perikles, and it was partly as a result of this favoured treatment that people grew jealous of Pheidias. In chapter 31, Plutarch goes on to suggest that the motivation behind the trial of Pheidias was the people's jealousy. It is difficult to know how far one can trust Plutarch in all this. No other source confirms that Pheidias made anything other than the Athena Parthenos for Perikles's building programme. Plutarch's terms ôieÎTTe and emaKOTToę are not technical terms and they do not fit in with what is known of 5th century BC Athenian building 2250 Polliti (1974) 200. 2251 Stadter (1989) 163.</page><page sequence="294">GREEK SOURCES 945 procedures. Normally, a board of epistatai were responsible for the financial supervision of a project, while a master builder, the àpxiTeKTWv, was responsible for the technical side of the work. Himmelmann has argued that there could be no place for an official supervisor who was independent of the board.2252 Plutarch may be exaggerating to a certain degree, for even the Parthenon could not have been supervised by Pheidias alone: while the Parthenon pediments were being made, Pheidias was in Olympia working on the great statue of Zeus. So is Plutarch writing in this special role for Pheidias without any more evidence than Pheidias 's great fame and the stories about Perikles's involvement in Pheidias' s alleged crime? It is possible that Plutarch has enlarged Pheidias 's role following the contemporary model of the relation of Trajan and his architect Apollodorus.2253 Nevertheless, the way in which the Parthenos and her temple echo and complement one another in the narrative themes of their decoration strongly suggests that a single person, perhaps Pheidias, masterminded the planning and coordination of the overall design of the temple's sculptures. Since Pheidias was working on the Akropolis until at least 438 BC, when the Athena Parthenos was completed, he may also have supervised the creation of the Parthenon metopes and frieze. Pheidias had probably left Athens by the time the pediments were being made. Their design, however, may have been the work of Pheidias. One of the masters who worked on the pediments is thought to be Pheidias's pupil Agorakritos. His works were sometimes confused with those of Pheidias by later tradition, suggesting that Agorakritos had thoroughly absorbed the Pheidian style. The influence of Pheidias is perhaps rightly felt even in the execution of the pediments. Concerning Perikles's involvement in Pheidias's alleged misconduct, see notes to Per. §31. €kqtÓ[ítt6Ôov FlapGevtova : From at least the mid 4th century BC, both the name 'Hekatomedon' and 'Parthenon' were regularly used to denote the Periklean temple of Athena.2254 In earlier times these names had specified Akropolis treasuries, at least one of which, the Hekatompedon, was a part of the temple. Plutarch's conflation of the two names is unusual. KaXXiKp(ÍTT1ç eipyd£eTo Kal 'Iktìvos : Pausanias, VIII.41.9, and Strabo, Geogr. 9.1.12, both name Iktinos as the architect of the Parthenon. Vitruvius, l.praef. 12, says he wrote a book about it. None of these writers connect the temple with Kallikrates. According to Plutarch, Kallikrates not only worked on the Parthenon, but he also designed the middle Long Wall at Athens. Evidence that Kallikrates was an important architect in Periklean Athens and later is perhaps provided by the controversial Athenian inscripition, IG I3 35. It is there decreed that a temple of Athena Nike should be built, according to the design of the chosen architect, Kallikrates. This decree has been dated to about 449 BC by Meiggs and Lewis.2255 The existing temple of Athena Nike on the Akropolis, however, seems to date 2252 Himmelmann (1977) 67-90. 2253 Ameling (1985) 57. 2254 See Lykourgos, Kata Keph and Demosthenes, C Androt. 13 and 76. 2255 Meiggs and Lewis (1969) 107-1 1.</page><page sequence="295">946 WRITTEN SOURCES from the period around 427-423 BC. It is not known whether the inscription is wrongly dated,2256 whether for some reason there was a long delay between the issuing of the decree and the construction of the temple, or whether the decree was never implemented and the temple that was built had nothing to do with Kallikrates. The close similarities in style, design, proportion and details of refinements that existed between the temple of Athena Nike, the Erechtheion, the Ilissos temple and the temple of the Athenians on Delos have suggested that they were all designed by one man. If Kallikrates is accepted as the architect of the temple of Athena Nike, then he may have been responsible for the other temples mentioned. The proportions of the small temple on Delos betray its designer's familiarity with the Parthenon, for the diameter and spacing of its columns are exactly 3/7 those of the Parthenon. Tfļs 06oû to xP^croOv eôos : Note the use of the term êôoç to designate the Pheidian Athena. It indicates that the work was a cult statue.2257 è v Tf) &lt;JTTļXi] : According to Plutarch, Pheidias's name was engraved 'on the stele'. That his name did not figure on the statue itself is confirmed by Cicero, Tusc. 1.15.34. Perhaps the stele Plutarch refers to is the one which recorded the decree commissioning the work, instituting the board of epistatai and designating Pheidias as the artist. Such a decree would have a parallel in the inscription relating to the sanctuary of Athena Nike, IG I3 35, lOff.2258 Orlandos suggests that the stele in question might be the bronze stele bearing the inventory of the statue.2259 tú Ô€ ßXa(j&lt;1)Ti[iLav : The accusation that free-born women were entertained for Perikles's pleasure is made elsewhere against Aspasia.2260 Plutarch, Per. 32, says that Aspasia's prosecutor was Hermippos, the comic poet.

But the worst motive of all, which is confirmed by a great number of witnesses, is to the following effect. Pheidias the sculptor accepted the contract for the statue, as I said before. As he was a friend of Perikles and had considerable influence over him, he was envied by others and he acquired enemies. These enemies decided to test the people by bringing a charge against Pheidias in order to find out what sort of a judgement would be reserved for Perikles. And so they persuaded a certain man called Menon - one of Pheidias's assistants - to sit down as a suppliant in the Agora and to ask for immunity in return for information and an accusation against Pheidias. The people accepted the man and an inquiry was held in the Assembly, but the thefts were not proved. For, on Perikles 's advice, right from the start, Pheidias had worked the gold for the statue and fitted it in such a way that it was quite possible to remove it and verify its weight. And this is what Perikles then called upon the accusers to do. But it was the fame of his works that aroused jealousy against Pheidias and mostly because when he fashioned the battle of the Amazons on the shield, he engraved a figure of himself as a bald old man lifting up a stone with both his hands, and he included a</page><page sequence="297">948 WRITTEN SOURCES very fine portrait of Perikles fighting against an Amazon. But the position of Perikles's arm - holding up a spear in front of Perikles's face - is skilfully devised as if it were intended to hide the likeness, which is glimpsed on either side. So Pheidias was led off to prison where he died after falling ill, or as some say, after he was poisoned, the poison being prepared by the enemies of Perikles with the intention of discrediting him. To the informer, Menon, the people granted exemption from taxation (Glaukon proposed the motion) and they ordered the generals to take charge of the man's security. About the same time Aspasia was indicted for impiety; the accuser was the comic poet Hermippos who also accused her of receiving in her own house free-born women for Perikles. And Diopeithes proposed a decree that public accusations should be made against those who did not recognize the existence of heavenly beings or taught fables about things above, directing suspicion at Perikles by means of Anaxagoras. The people accepted and admitted the accusations. Thus, at length, a decree proposed by Drakontides was enacted, that the accounts of the funds be deposited with the Prytaneis by Perikles, and that the judges pass judgement on the Akropolis, taking their voting pebbles from the altar. But Hagnon removed this last part from the decree and moved that the case be judged by fifteen hundred jurors, whether one wanted to label it a prosecution for theft and bribery, or malversation. So Aspasia he begged off, shedding many tears for her at the trial, as Aeschines says, and imploring the jurors; but fearing a court-case for Anaxagoras, he hid him and sent him out of the city. As in Pheidias 's case he had stumbled against the people, he feared a court-case, so he set ablaze the war that was impending and smouldering, hoping to disperse the charges and allay jealousy, since in important affairs and dangers the city entrusted itself to him alone, because of his authority and power. So, these are said to be the reasons why Perikles did not allow the people to give in to the Lakedaimonians; the truth, however, is unclear. Greek text : Lindskog, C. &amp; Ziegler, K.

Date : Written in the period around AD 96-1 14. fH 06 x€LpiaTTl aiTia ttckjwv : Plutarch goes on to explain what he views as the worst motive of all attributed to Perikles for starting the Peloponnesian War, worst because it sees Perikles acting for selfish reasons rather than for the good of Athens. Politically- motivated attacks against Perikles's friends Pheidias, Aspasia, and Anaxagoras led Perikles to fear being taken to court himself and for this reason he risked war with Sparta. toö áyá'|iaToç : As in many sources, the statue of Athena Parthenos is simply referred to as aya''Ld, a term often applied to cult statues.2261 oí 8è toû ÔT1110U ttoloi3|I6voi TTetpav kv eKeívo) ttoIóç tiç eaoiTo llepiKXei KpiTTļs : There were two groups of enemies, according to Plutarch, some motivated by feelings of 2261 See Nick (2002) 12ff.

Together, these enemies persuaded Menon to accuse Pheidias. If Pheidias could be accused of embezzling gold intended for the statue of Athena, then Perikles would automatically come under attack as one of the epistatai in charge of the accounts for the work. The beginning of Plutarch's account is very close to that of Diodorus, XII.39.1-2, who also tries to convey the political motivations that lay behind Pheidias's trial. Mevtovd Tiva : Menon, one of Pheidias's colleagues, and not an Athenian citizen, as is implied by the benefits he gains from his denunciation of Pheidias, namely exemption from taxes, aTeXeia, and legal protection. The name Menon is unknown to Diodorus Siculus, XII.39, who writes of several denunciators. Bauman notes that Menon "was not the formal accuser. He merely reported to the Ecclesia."2262 LK6TT1V év àyopâ KaGiíowiv : Menon sits as a suppliant in the Athenian Agora at the Altar of the Twelve Gods. This was the altar built in the centre of the Agora by the younger Peisistratros. See Diodorus Siculus, XII.39, émOiaav em tòv tûv 0eo)v ßuiiov. For this altar as a place of asylum, see for instance Herodotus, VI. 108.4.

Such a prosecution was called an eiaayyeXia. Diodorus's account agrees with Plutarch in this matter. The accusation of stealing material that was intended for the Athena Parthenos, and which was therefore public property, was indeed a matter of great importance to the people. The danger to Perikles, as one of the epistatai, would have been considerable. Up to this point in the narrative, Plutarch and Diodorus have been in agreement. In most of what follows, however, the two authors diverge. Diodorus goes straight to the conclusion of the trial and Pheidias's arrest, while Plutarch, clearly drawing from sources other than Ephoros, brings in many new elements. As we know from Arist. 26.3, Plutarch had access to collections of legal cases. kXottqi [lèv ovK riXeyxovTO : According to Plutarch's version of the story, Pheidias was accused of stealing some of the gold intended for the statue of the Parthenos. But since the statue had been designed so that the gold could all be removed and weighed, this charge could not be upheld.2264 Pheidias was condemned anyway, partly because of the envy he had aroused and partly because he included his self-portrait and that of Perikles on the 2262 Bauman (1990) 181 n. 23. 2263 Travlos (1970) 458-61. 2264 Concerning the fact that the gold could be removed, see, for instance, Thucydides, II. 13.5; Plutarch, De Vit . Aer. 2; Diodorus Siculus, Bibi Hist. XII.40.3.</page><page sequence="299">950 WRITTEN SOURCES shield of the Parthenos. Plutarch seems to imply that there were several elements in the one trial, and what led to a condemnation was not the alleged theft, since this could not be proved, but the impiety of including portraits on a cult image. As Bauman shows, charges relating to impiety were used to attack not only Pheidias but also Aspasia, Anaxagoras and Perikles himself.2265 Other sources relating to the charges made against Pheidias agree that they were related to theft. One of the scholiasts to Aristophanes, Pax , 605, specifies the theft of ivory from the statue, the second gold. The Ephoros-based sources remain vague about exactly what Pheidias was said to have stolen: Diodorus, Bibl. Hist. XII.39, talks of the appropriation of large quantities of sacred funds, iepwv xpTlUctTtov, and says Perikles was accused of the theft of sacred property, íepocjuXía. Aristodemos, FGrH , 104 F 1.1 6.1, talks of embezzlement. év tt¡ àcjTTÍôi TToiwv aÚToí) Tiva |iopcļ)r|v eveTUTTaxre ktX. : Dio Chrysostomos, Or. XII.6, also mentions the likenesses of Pheidias and Perikles on the outer surface of the shield of the Athena Parthenos. Cicero, Tuse. Disp. 1.15.34, tells of a likeness (, sui similem speciem) of Pheidias alone. There are no references to the portraits in any early sources and the story may well be a Hellenistic invention. In several late authors the story becomes even more fantastic as Pheidias 's portrait is believed to be connected to a hidden device that would destroy the whole statue if the portrait was ever removed.2266 Even if likenesses did feature on the shield, and people's jealousy was aroused, it is difficult to see how a legal accusation against Pheidias could be fabricated on these grounds alone. iTpeaßiiToi; c()aXaKpoí), TTÉTpov ¿ttt] plévou ôi' aļicķoTepcav töv x^Lpûv : This figure can be seen on the Strangford Shield, BM no. 302, as well as on the Lenormant statuette, ANM 128. Fehr argues that the figure cannot be described as old, since he is hurling a large stone without much apparent effort.2267 His baldness, then, has to be interpreted in another manner. As Fehr remarks, baldness was often used to characterize craftsmen, as was the short tunic, which this figure is seen to be wearing on the Lenormant shield. The identity of the figure as a craftsman, however, is debatable, for the tunic shown on the Lenormant shield may be a copyist's addition rather than a feature of the original shield. dvaTeivoucrris 8ópu TTpò tt's ôiJjecjç to€ riepiKXÉouç : This figure is clearly recognizable on the Strangford Shield, BM no. 302.2268 ó [lèv ovv Oeiôíaç eis tò SecrļitoTTļpiov aTTaxOeiç eTeXeuTTicre voaīļcras, wç 8é (ļ)aaiy è'vioi, (1)ap|idKoiç : In agreement with Diodorus, Plutarch says that Pheidias was sent to prison.

The authentic ring it has, giving the name of the rogator, and then reproducing a formula that is known from other preserved texts, émjieXeîaGai 8è toùç aTpaTriyoúç Trjç àa^aXeiaç aírrou, suggests that either Plutarch had access to the decree itself or his source quoted it. Either way, it lends authority to Plutarch's account at this point, and allows one to deduce from the rewards given to Menon that the accusation brought against Pheidias by this man did lead to Pheidias's conviction. The scale of the rewards further suggests that Menon 's denunciation was regarded as an important service rendered to the Athenian people, for the rewards were analogous to those reserved for foreign benefactors of the city.2269 Menon must have been a foreigner, probably a metic.2270 The name Glaukon (the proposer of the decree) is emended from the unknown name 'Glukon' in the manuscripts.2271 This may be Glaukon, son of Leagros, whose daughter married Kallias, son of Hipponikos. He was stratēģos in 441/440 BC,2272 4 39/43 8 BC and in 433/432 BC.2273 Even in the board of generals Perikles had enemies. Later on, Plutarch gives parts of other decrees in this narrative. They may all have come from the same source, perhaps the collection of decrees made by Krāteros, as Donnay suggests.2274 'AaTTaaia ôlktiv efyevyev aaeßeiag : According to Plutarch, Aspasia's accuser was the comic poet, Hermippos, and the charge was impiety, as well as entertaining free-born women for Perikles. Aristophanes, Ach. 515ff., mentions Aspasia entertaining free-born women for Perikles and, in Per . §13, Plutarch says this same charge was made against Pheidias. In De Herod. Mai. 6, Plutarch is scathing about oí kü)[iikoI for the attacks on Aspasia and Pheidias. Comic poets did not hesitate to seize on the stories that were put about to add spice to their material. In §32.5, Plutarch refers to Aeschines, the Socratic philosopher, and his dialogue, Aspasia , in which Perikles's behaviour at the trial is described to show Aspasia's influence. As Städter says, "the argument would be without 2269 See, for instance, IG I3, 1 13, 12; 1 10, 16; 167, 11. 227 0 por metics working on the Erechtheion, for example, see IG I3, 475, 106; 152; 154; 244; 247. 2271 Pareti (1909) 274. 2272 Amotion, ap. sch.

Bauman notes that the charge of asebeia "was not well suited to the comic vein" and this, he feels, gives the story the benefit of the doubt.2276 Plutarch says very vaguely that Aspasia's trial took place at about the same time as the trial of Pheidias.2277 iļjTļ(ļ)i(jfia ÀioTTei0T|9 éypa^ev : The accusation against Anaxagoras is also reported by Diodorus Siculus, Bibl. Hist. XII. 39. 2, though Diodorus does not cite the decree of Diopeithes. The word eicrayyeXXeaOai seems to indicate that Plutarch is quoting at least part of the original decree here, as do the words Ta Gela, instead of the more usual toùç Geoúç and [ie Ta per iw v, rather than ļieTecjpuv. A further source for the trial of Anaxagoras is Diogenes Laertius, 11.12, who reports that two other authors mentioned the trial, each one naming a different man as accuser of Anaxagoras: Satyros named Thucydides as the accuser, while Sotion, probably correctly, named Cleon.2278 A reference to the trial of Anaxagoras is also made by Plato in Apologia , 26d. Diodorus, Bibl Hist. XII.39.2, puts Anaxagoras's trial after that of Pheidias, Plutarch after that of Pheidias and Aspasia which, he says, happened at about the same time. īļiTļcļ)L(jļjLa KupoÛTai ApaKovTiôoi; ypai|;avToç : According to Plutarch, Drakontides proposed that Perikles submit his accounts to the Prytany. The accounts of funds would normally have been examined not by the Prytaneis, but by the logistai.2279 So Drakontides was demanding a special accounting by Perikles. The gravity of the case is underlined by Drakontides' next demand, that an extraordinary procedure be followed of taking lots from the great altar of Athena (near the east front of the Erechtheion). This suggests that the funds in question were sacred funds and that the decree of Drakontides was concerned with Perikles's role as one of the epistatai of the Parthenos statue. Hagnon's amendment (for which see below) would appear to support this view. It is usually affirmed that Perikles was brought to trial once only by the Athenians. This was at the end of his life, in 430 BC, when the Athenians were demoralized by plague and the successes of their enemies. In their anger, they turned on Perikles, who had advised them to go to war, and they were not appeased until he was stripped of his title of stratēģos and heavily fined.2280 To judge from the speech put into Perikles's mouth by Thucydides, 11.49-64, Perikles stood accused of nothing other than bad military leadership. But, if this is the case, how can one associate with the trial of 430 BC the decree of Drakontides, which is about an accusation of theft of 2275 Städter (1989) 297. 2276 Bauman (199) 38. 2277 Concerning the trial see Ehlers (1966) 68-71; Frost (1964) 395-96; Klein (1979) 509-10; Mansfield (1980) 32-33; Schwarze (1971) 110-13. 2278 For a summary of the sources, see Städter (1989) 298-300.

Plato, Górgias , 515e-516a, provides evidence both that Perikles stood trial only once in his life, namely in 430 BC, and that the offence of which he stood accused was theft : âXXà rade oÚketi aKouw, àXX' oíôa aa^wç Kai eyù Kal au, 6ti tò [lèv TTpwTov TļuSoKiļiei nepiKXÍ1ç Kai oi)8e|iiav aiaxpàv 8íkt]v KaTe^rļcķiaavTO a¿TOÍ) 'A0r|vaīoi, īļviKa r|aav eTTeiôf) 8è KaXoi KayaOoi êyeyóveaav UTI-' aÚTOÔ, 6TTL TeXeUTÍj TOÖ ßlOU TOV riepiKXéoi;?, kX0TT11V aVTOV KaT6iļiTļ(ļ)iaavT0, óXíyou ôè Kai 0avaTOu eTipjļCFav. (Dodds, E. (1959) Plato. Górgias © Oxford University Press: Clarendon Press.) But this is not something I have just heard. Both you and I know it for a fact: at first Perikles was well thought of and the Athenians brought no shameful accusation against him as long as they remained wicked. But when they became good gentlemen, because of him, at the end of his life, they accused him of theft and very nearly condemned him to death. Plutarch mentions the decree of Drakontides and the amendment of Hagnon along with the decree of Diopeithes and the trials of Pheidias, Aspasia and Anaxagoras. But the trial of Perikles he deals with much later on in his narrative, in Per. 35.4. Bauman considers that this has led to a distorted view of the chronology of events.2281 Whereas the decree of Drakontides attempted to make the investigation into Perikles' s use of funds into a religious affair, with a much more serious and potentially dangerous outcome for Perikles, the amendment of Hagnon ensured that the audit took place in the usual secular manner. This change in attitude suggests to Bauman that whereas the decree of Drakontides probably dates from about the same time as the decree of Diopeithes and the trials of Perikles's friends, Hagnon's amendment must date from several years later at a time when Perikles again came under attack but when people were at least willing to treat the case in the normal way. This suggests that the decree of Drakontides was never implemented in its original form, at the time when Perikles was accused of iepoauXia in connection with the Pheidias affair (Diodorus Siculus, Bib. Hist. XII. 39. Iff.), but it was revived later by Perikles's enemies only to be successfully amended by Hagnon. As to the identity of Drakontides, he was probably one and the same man as the Drakontides who was epistates of the Boule in 446/445 BC, when a decree on Chalcis was passed, as well as one of the generals who went to relieve Kerkyra in 433/432 BC. "Ayvcov ôè toüto 'ièv àc|)€ÎXe tov i|iT1(()i(j[iaToç : Hagnon's amendment to the decree of Drakontides ensured that normal procedure was followed, rather than the exceptional procedure suggested by Drakontides: the matter was to be brought before a popular tribunal of 1,500 heliasts (in fact 1,501), the accusation being either complicity in the theft or negligence. In this way, the religious nature of the crime was played down and the risks to Perikles considerably lessened. The former accusation would have led to a fine equal to ten times the public loss, while the latter entailed a fine equal to the public loss.2282 It also offered Perikles a good chance of acquittal in front of such a number of jurors, since he still 2281 Bauman (1990) 42^5. 2282 Aristotle, Ath.

The mention of Pheidias alongside the mythical inventor of sculpture is a traditional theme, found in several ancient sources.2292 The idea that Pheidias sculpted tiny creatures is also found in other authors, though the truth of the assertion is doubtful.2293 SIMONIDES (?), Anthologia Palatina , Book 7, epigram 25, lines 1-2. oi)Tog ' AvdKpeíovTa, tòv acļ)0iTov eivem Mouaewv ujivottóXov, TTcrrpriç TU|ißos éôeKTo Tew . . .

To these he added translucent stones, and temples, colonnades, columns, and other features worthy to be seen, as well as works imitating nature in skill. Many cities courting favour with the Emperor sent them, after they changed their religious practice and pulled down their temples. The statues were pagan works, and Mango points out how paradoxical it was for Constantine to adorn his city with such statuary. He explains the phenomenon in terms of the "ambiguity of the religious policy pursued by Constantine' s government".2296 The number of statues involved is impressive. There were eighty statues in the Baths of Zeuxippos alone, and a large and valuable collection was housed in the Palace of Lausos.2297 Despite numerous fires and some wilful destruction, many statues survived throughout the Byzantine period, and several stories record the superstitious fears that people entertained about the statues. It was not until the city fell to the barbarians in the early 13th century that the last surviving ancient statues were destroyed. Niketas Choniates 2294 See Eusebios, De Vita Const.

That the Zeus at Olympia ended its days in Constantinople is well established.2299 The fate of other works by Pheidias is not recorded, though some suspect that the great bronze Athena is the work described by Niketas Choniates which was destroyed in the city by a mob of drunks in AD 1203. 2300 It would not be surprising to discover that other works by Pheidias had also been transported to Constantinople.

The greatest of these was the statue of Zeus in ivory which Pheidias, the Athenian, son of Charmides, made. The size of this statue is so enormous that, although the temple is very large, the artist seems to have failed to consider proportion, for he has represented the god seated yet almost touching the roof with the top of his head. He thus creates the impression that if the god were to get up and stand up straight he would unroof the temple. Some writers have recorded the measurements of the statue and Kallimachos has spoken about them in one of his iambic poems. Panainos the painter, who was Pheidias 's nephew and assistant, worked with Pheidias on many aspects of the decoration of the statue with colours, especially the drapery. Many remarkable paintings by the artist are on display around the temple. And they recount this anecdote about Pheidias: when Panainos asked him what model he intended to use to make the image of Zeus, he answered that it was the one illustrated by Homer in these words, Thus spoke the son of Kronos, and he nodded his dark brow and the ambrosial locks fell flowing down from the king's immortal head; and he made great Olympos tremble. For it seems to be very nobly put, as appears from the other details and from the detail of the brows, because the poet calls forth our imagination to picture a great figure and a mighty power worthy of Zeus, just as he does in the case of Hera, at the same time as respecting what is appropriate for each one. For he says, "She shook herself on the throne, and made lofty Olympos tremble." The effect that was produced in her case, when she moved her whole body, happened in the case of Zeus when he just nodded his brows, though his hair was somewhat affected too. It has been elegantly stated of the poet that he alone has seen or else he alone has displayed the images of the gods. Greek text : Baladié, R. (1978) Strabon. Géographie. CUF. Budé ed.

As a chryselephantine work, the Zeus was primarily made of wood, beneath all the decorations in gold and ivory. See Dio Chrysostomos, Or. XII.49-50.

The scale of the Zeus, however, would have been considerably greater for he was represented as a seated rather than as a standing figure. The term |i6ye0os, which is often used in connection with the Zeus, probably refers not simply to the size of the work but also to its grandeur. KaXXí |iaxoç : The 3rd century BC poet Kallimachos wrote a description in verse of the Zeus.2301 Little is left of the text, but taken in conjunction with the archaeological remains of the base, it provides some useful facts: the height of the throne was five cubits less than the height of the statue, which probably measured thirty 'feet'. Depending on exactly which foot is used, it seems probable that the statue measured some 12.2-1 2.4m in height. The naos was 14.33m high. Therefore, assuming a height of about lm for the pedestal (which was, according to Mallwitz,2302 6.54m wide by 9.82m long), there was a gap of about another metre between the top of the head and the roof.2303 návaivoç : Panainos the painter, and author of a fresco in the Stoa Poikile at Athens, of the battle of Marathon.2304 Pliny and Pausanias refer to Panainos as Pheidias's brother rather than his nephew.2305 This would seem to fit in better with, for instance, the date of Panainos's work for the Stoa Poikile, which is around 470 BC. Strabo says that many paintings by Panainos were displayed around the temple at Olympia. According to Pausanias, V.11.5, these paintings were on barriers which prevented access to the area beneath the throne. 2301 Fragment 196, ed.

Perikles may have held the office of epistates, but his name is not preserved in the extant accounts inscriptions. But he cannot have supervised the work alone, as one might mistakenly infer from Strabo's words. Strabo's phrase riepiKXéouç emaTaTowTos is exactly the same as that used by the 4th century BC historian Philochoros, quoted in the scholia to Aristophanes, Pax , 605-06, concerning Perikles 's supposed role with regard to the creation of the Athena Parthenos. From the Parthenos accounts, IG I3 453-460, in which the annual secretary to the board of epistatai and the treasurers are always named whereas the epistatai are never named, it seems probable that the epistatai - of whom there were definitely quite a number - remained in post for the entire building period. If Philochoros is correct, then Perikles was one of the epistatai in charge of supervising work on the statue. Compare also Plutarch, Per. 32.3, which seems to support this idea. It is possible, though there is no direct evidence to support Strabo, that Perikles took the role of epistates in the Parthenon project too. Plutarch, Per. 13, goes much further in magnifying both Perikles's role and that of Pheidias, when he claims that Pheidias masterminded and supervised the whole building programme for Perikles. No source confirms Plutarch's view. 231 * See also Schweitzer (1932) 34, who suggests maiestas as a translation of |ieye0oç for this passage.</page><page sequence="319">970 WRITTEN SOURCES STRABO, Geographica, 9.1.16 (Casaubon, 396).

(1931) Suidae Lexicon. Vol. I, part II, 214. Stuttgart: Teubner. Date: The first part of this note is probably attributable to Diogenianus, who lived in the age of Hadrian (emperor from AD 117-138). The second part is by Harpokration, who lived in the 1st or 2nd century AD. 'EKaTÓ[iTTe8oç vecos : The Hekatompedon, the east chamber of the Parthenon, measured approximately 100 feet: de Waele says it measured 29.786m in length internally and 30.939m, including the width of the wall behind the statue.2318 According to de Waele, the foot used for building the Parthenon was 0.307m long. This means that the chamber measured 97ft internally and 100.75ft including the back wall. It is possible that the name itself is much older than the east naos of the Parthenon and that it reflects the existence of an earlier one hundred foot temple or sacred area probably on the same site. By the 4th century BC, the terms 'Hekatompedos neos' or 'Hekatompedon' were being used to denote the whole of the Periklean temple. Needless to say, this temple measured considerably more than one hundred feet: de Waele says 69.50m on the north side, which he reckons as 226.75ft.2319 ' EkcítÓiittí Sov AuKoOpyos : See Lykourgos, Kata Kephisodotou.

He would have used clay to create the core of his bronze statues, and to make the fully detailed preliminary model, in reduced size, of his chryselephantine statues too. He may sometimes have used clay for working out the detailed surface of the wooden core of chryselephantine statues before the revetment was affixed. There may also have been plaster under the ivory of the Athena Parthenos, whereas the gold may have been affixed directly to the wood of the core. In the case of the Zeus at Olympia, there are some grounds for believing that Pheidias used a quite different technique, possibly involving moulded glass and gold foil.2322 This has yet to be proved.

Pliny, NH 36.18, takes the time to describe them to the extent of recording that they were adorned with a Centauromachy on the edges of the soles, because this detail had made such a deep impression on him. The monumental scale of such a masterpiece would have been the first quality to strike the viewer, but for Pliny it was the wealth of detail to be discovered beyond this obvious feature that made Pheidias 's work so perfect.

Corso counts no less than sixty-one sources for this sculpture, making it the most often mentioned work of ancient art after the Zeus at Olympia.

It was admired there by Prokopios.2329 It was then transferred to Constantinople, where it was written about from time to time until the later 12th century AD. After this date it is heard of no more. It perhaps perished in the sack of the city in AD 1204. THEODORETOS of CYRRHUS, Graecarum Affectionum Curatio , 111.71. 49.

For they are awesome compared with modern constructions . . . The river passes through the middle of the city, bridged with wider arches. By the builder of the vault of heaven, one would not say that these had been composed, but rather that they were a product of nature, and monolithic; if Pheidias, another stone-cutter, also saw them, he would marvel at their perfectly equal dimensions, according to the ruler, and the lack of any deviations.

Thucydides goes on to use the more usual term ayaX|ia.2333 In connection with the Athena Parthenos, the use of these terms is important as they confirm that the statue was worshipped as a cult statue on the Akropolis. Thucydides purports to record Perikles's statement before the Athenian assembly about the financial resources available to Athens just before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War. Amongst the assets, he lists the gold which covered the Athena Parthenos, though he warns that if this gold were used it should eventually be replaced. Detailed accounts were kept of the statue until almost the end of the 4th century BC. From time to time the state of the statue and the completeness of the gold revetment were carefully checked.2334 TeaaepaKovTa TaXavTa aTctGjiòv xpucríou aTTecķOou : For the weight of the gold, see Plutarch, De Vit.

Concerning statues of Athena in Constantinople, see Arethas, scholion Aristides, Or. 34.28; Kedrenos, 1.565; Konstantinos Rhodios, Ekphr. 153ff; Niketas Chômâtes, De Isaac. 738B and notes.

Niketas Choniates, Diegesis, 856, says it was taken away to be melted down in AD 1204, and it took four yoke of oxen to move the head alone to the Palace. No other source reports that Pheidias made a statue of Hera. tòv dv0TļXiov 'ATTÓXXwva : It is not clear what the title dv0TļXios indicates, though it could mean 'facing the sun' or iike the sun' or even shining 'instead of the sun'.2339 The Apollo was originally on a porphyry column in the Forum Constantine, where it was set up by Constantine in AD 328 as his own effigy. It was a bronze statue of Apollo-Helios, wearing a radiate crown and holding in the right hand a spear or sceptre (the former according to the Great Chronographer, 8, the latter according to Anna Komnene, Alex. XII.4.5) and in the left a globe. Malaias, Chron. XIII.320E, says there were seven rays on the head. Nikephoros Kallistos, Eccl. Hist. VII.49, says that a cross had been attached to the globe and it bore the inscription, Zoi, XpiOTÈ ó 0eòç, TTapaTÍ0T]|ju t t'v ttóXiv TotiJTTļv ('I commit this city to you, Christ our God'). In AD 1 106 the statue was brought down in a storm2340 and the head, which was the only part that could be saved, was then transferred to the palace for safe-keeping. According to Symeon Logothete and Kedrenos, it was a work by Pheidias brought from Athens.2341 It is probable, however, that these writers were misreading the statue inscription, which in fact said that the work came from Phrygia.2342 Such a provenance is supported by a number of sources.2343 Mango finds parallels for an oriental Apollo-Helios type bearing both spear and globe.2344 The statue is also mentioned by Ioannes Scylitzas Curopalatas in his Breviarius Historicus (Bonn, 1839, 742). 2339 According to Anna Komnene, Alex. XII.4.5, the statue stood facing the east. Symeon Logothete, Chron. 87, interprets it as 'facing the sun.' 2340 Anna Komnene, Alex. XII.4.5. 2341 Symeon Logothete, Chron. 87 and Kedrenos, Comp.

Alkamenes modelled beautiful statues without being skilled in optics and geometry. He frequented agorai and spent time in them, and he had worshippers and lovers and followers. Pheidias, on the other hand, was good at optics and geometry, he had a perfect understanding of sculpture, he shaped everything as was suitable for places, occasions, and people while thinking of the orderly arrangement of a piece above all else. According to Tzetzes, he hated agorai; art alone was his lover and worshipper. Once when the people of Athens needed someone to make two statues for Athena, the bases of which would be placed on high columns, both men set to work, at the people's bidding. Alkamenes at once produced a delicate and feminine statue in the figure of the goddess as a young girl. Pheidias, on the other hand, who was successful in optics and geometry and who knew that objects appear very small from a height, made the statue with its lips closed, its nostrils drawn back, and the rest in proportion with the height of the columns. Alkamenes' statue was thought better than the other. Pheidias was in danger of being stoned. But when the statues were lifted and set on the pillars, Pheidias 's statue displayed the nobility of its art, and the name Pheidias was in everyone's mouths after this. Alkamenes' statue, by contrast, was mocked and Alkamenes was a laughing-stock. Greek text : Leone, P. (1968) Joannis Tzetzae Historiae. Naples: Libreria scientifica ed. Date : Published in AD 1 143. ó ' AXKa|iévr|ç xaXKOupyòç r'v yevei vticjiwttiç : Alkamenes was probably from Athens; for notes on this pupil of Pheidias, see Pausanias, V.10.8; and Pliny, NH 34.49 and 36.15-19. There may be some confusion with Agorakritos, who came from Paros. 'O ôè Oeiôiaç Ótttikòç téXûv Kal y€ū)ļieTprļs : It comes as no surprise to find that, even centuries after his death, Pheidias was famous for his skill in optics and geometry, which helped him to compensate for the distortions to a statue which arose when it was seen from a particular height and angle. Since Pheidias was an expert in producing colossal works, such as the great bronze Athena and the Athena Parthenos, he must have been well used to making refinements which took into consideration the viewpoint of the spectator. Ôúo Tivà àyáX|iaTa Tfj 'A0r|yą TToifjaai : No other source mentions this story of statues of Athena, intended to be placed high up on columns, being commissioned by the Athenians from the artists Alkamenes and Pheidias.

Pheidias was famous for numerous statues of the goddess Athena, a subject he often treated, if the sources are to be trusted.</page><page sequence="342">GREEK SOURCES 993 TZETZES, Epistle 21. 0:839.

The sculptor Pheidias once did Agorakritos a favour, out of friendship for a man who was a draughtsman by training but who did not know how to draw gracefully. With great sculptural expertise, he carved the statue in Rhamnous of Zeus and Nemesis and he attributed it to this man, inscribing on the statue the words, "The work of Agorakritos of Paros". With this inscription he made up for Agorakritos' lack of skill. And so if, because of the ties of friendship, Pheidias did not shrink from showing favour, concerning the greatest things, towards a man who was incapable of helping himself in the matter of artistic skill, shall I, with regard to my brother, appear inferior to Pheidias? Would I not do for him the same as this man Pheidias, "a maker of ingenious songs" as Pindar puts it, completing the work, especially as I love him without reserve, as Pheidias loved Agorakritos? Therefore, by as much as brotherly kindness is more attractive than the charms of hospitality, so both I myself and that man Pheidias wrote those epigraphs, but never did Pheidias nor Tzetzes succumb to madness or forgetfulness, and become so frenzied as ever to forget our own name, as some people have suspected.

The Nemesis at Rhamnous: at Rhamnous stands a statue of Nemesis ten cubits high, made entirely of marble, the work of Pheidias; it holds an apple branch in one hand. According to Antigonos of Kary stos, a little tablet hangs from this branch bearing the inscription, "Agorakritos of Paros made me". But this is not to be wondered at, for many others have also inscribed another person's name on their own works. It is likely that Pheidias conceded to Agorakritos, for he was his lover and he was needlessly afraid about his darling. Greek text : Lyon, E. and Schneidewin, F. G.

When he communicated this dream to those in office, they thought he was talking nonsense such as a very old man would and they did not do anything he had said. After working out on his own what should be done, trained as he was in divine matters, he made an image of the hero in a miniature temple and placed it at the feet of the statue of Athena consecrated in the Parthenon; he carried out the traditional ceremonies for the goddess and at the same time he also fulfilled, in accordance with the rites, the obligations due to the hero. Greek text : Paschoud, F. (1979) Zosime. Histoire Nouvelle , Vol. II. CUF. Budé ed. Paris: Les Belles Lettres. Date : Probably early 6th century AD. Nestorios : Nestorios was hierophant of the sacred mysteries of Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis in AD 375, in the time of the co-emperors Valens (AD 364-378) and Valentian I (AD 364-375). He was one of the last of the Eumolpids. This was one of the two priestly families that presided at Eleusis; it died out towards the end of the 4th century AD. Nestorios may have been the priest who initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries the future emperor Julian as well as Eunapios, though Eunapios does not mention the priest by name.2347 tòv 'AxiXXéa tòv rjpwa ôr|1ioaiais Ti|iâa0ai Tip.atç : Nestorios was ordered in a dream to honour Achilles in a public manner in order to save Athens from disaster. According to this account, he was refused permission to do so by the archons but he proceeded to carry out the necessary rites in private. When the earthquake struck, in the year AD 375, the Peloponnese, central Greece and Crete were all badly affected, but most of Attica was spared. Some people piously viewed this miracle as a result of the appeal made by Nestorios to the pagan gods. It was perhaps because Nestorios would have been acting outside his official domain that the Athenian archons refused to let Nestorios perform rites to Achilles on the Athenian Akropolis. The archons may also have considered it dangerous to perform pagan rituals in so public a manner, even under the fairly tolerant co-emperors.2348 After the death of the emperor Julian, who had tried to reinstate pagan cults in AD 361-363, pagans had to be careful and discreet in their worship, but that they carried on with it at least in private is shown by the actions of Nestorios.

When Alaric approached the city with all his army, he saw Athena Promachos going around the wall, as one can see her in statues, armed and as if she was on the point of opposing her assailants. . . . Alaric could not bear this sight and, giving up all his plans against the city, he sent in an embassy. Greek text : Paschoud, F. (1986) Zosime. Histoire Nouvelle , Vol. III, 1 CUF. Budé ed. Paris: Les Belles Lettres. Date : Probably early 6th century AD. Alaric : The Visigothic leader who invaded Greece in AD 395, devastating much of it. According to Zosimos, Athens was miraculously saved from destruction by Athena Promachos and Achilles, the sight of whom terrified Alaric so much that he decided to leave Athens alone and withdraw entirely from Attica. This account contradicts the facts. There is evidence of Alaric's destruction at least in the lower city of Athens.2350 And in Ep. LX. 16, written in AD 396, Jerome says that Athens was under Alaric's domination. Trombley comments, "The notion that such an apparition would have daunted a Romanized Christian Visigoth is patently absurd."2351 tt'v TTpóp.axoy 'A0T1vw : The description Zosimos gives of the Athena seen by Alaric seems to be of a striding figure, armed and ready to attack. He says that she is just as one might see her in certain statues and he calls her Trpó|iaxog, that is, fighting or warlike. There is a well-known statue type of Athena which would fit this description, and this is the type exemplified by, for instance, Athens, NM 6447, a figure striding forward, with the right hand raised ready to hurl a spear and the left hand holding a shield in a defensive attitude. Such a type can be seen not only on Panathenaic prize amphorae but also in 2349 As evidence of the Parthenon's status as a temple and that of the Parthenos as a cult statue, this passage is discussed by Nick (2002) 118 and 230-31, Test. 98. 2350 Frantz (1979) 397-98. 2351 Trombley (1993) 306.</page><page sequence="348">GREEK SOURCES 999 numerous vase paintings showing cult scenes. Nick suggests that this type of Athena reflects an Archaic cult image of Athena which was worshipped alongside the Athena Polias on the Akropolis in the 6th and early 5th centuries BC and which was closely connected with the Panathenaic festival. According to Nick, this second cult statue was later replaced by the Pheidian chryselephantine Athena.2352 ZOSIMOS, Historia Nova , V.24.7-8. toOto Tfjs yepoimaç tò Tejievoç, oímep eveica TauTa ôie^ei^i, Aiòç Kai'A0T1vâç àyáXfiaTa upó twv Gupûv eíxev, ¿Tří tivíov ßaaewv XiOívwv ecrrwTa, Ka0' ö Kaí vvv 60TI avrà GeáaaaGai axfļļia- (ķaal ôè tò |ièv tov Aiòç eivai toü Atoôwvaíou, tò ôè tò Lv tÍ) Alvöü) TTaXai KaGiòpufiévov toi) TTupòç toívw 6TTiyep.rļ0evTos aTTav tò Te^evoç, Ó [lèv 6TTLK6L 116V0Ç TW T€y€l [loXlßÖOS €pp6L TlļKO^ieVOS KCLTŪ TWV ayaXļiaTCi)v, éc()ép0VT0 ôè Kal oí Tfjç oiKoôo^iíaç XíGoi KaTa toútwv, avTex^iv Trj tov TTupòç cķuaei 'ir' ôwT10évTeç. eis x^M-aT0S Sè oxfļM-a toi) TravTÒç kóXXouç [i€TaßXr10eyTO9, r' 'ièv koivt| ôó£a Kaí TaÜTa eTÓTTaíe kóviv [Kaí auTa] yevéaQai, KaGaipófievoç ôè ó tóttoç Kaí TTpòç àvavéoKJiv yevó|ievoç ei&gt;TpeTTT)s êôei£e Ta twv Geûv toútojv àyáX|iaTa |ióva KpeiTTova rf's TTavTeXoös 6K€Ívr|9 yeyovÓTa c|&gt;Gopds* ÔTTep oÍTTaai tolç xaPLecrrépoiç à|±eívouç em Trj TTÓXei ôéôwKev e'xeiv êXmôaç, wç ôf| tov Qewv toútov è'xecrôai rf's imep auTfjç del ßouXo|ievcov TTpovoíaç* àXXà TaÛTa |iév, otttí to 0eiw ôoKet, Taúrg TTpoíco. This precinct of the Senate House, about which I am giving these details, had statues of Zeus and Athena in front of its doors that stood on some stone bases, in the arrangement in which they can be seen even today; people say that the former is of the Zeus of Dodona and that the other is the one that was set up in ancient times in Lindos. Now when fire devoured the whole precinct, the lead lying on the roof melted and poured on to the statues, while the stones of the building also collapsed on them, unable to stand up to the natural effect of the fire. When all this beauty was transformed into the appearance of a heap of débris, general opinion assumed that these statues too had been reduced to dust, but when the site was cleared and was prepared for reconstruction, it revealed that the statues of these gods had alone been stronger than that general destruction; this gave to all the more cultivated people reason to have better hopes for the city, since these gods at any rate still wished to show their providence in her favour; but may events unfold as it seems right to the divine mind.

Hesychios Illoustrios, Patria Konst. 41, in the 6th century AD, talks of the Zeus of Dodona and two statues of Athena in the Senate of the Augusteion and says the statues were set up by Constantine the Great. Later authors, in the 10th and 1 1th centuries, write of an Athena Lindia outside the Senate of the Forum of Constantine.2353 It is not certain that they are all talking of the same statue and one must bear in mind that there is a great deal of confusion in the sources about which Senate House in Constantinople is being discussed. For Constantinople had two Senate houses, both originally built by Constantine the Great: the Senate of the Forum of Constantine, to the north of the Forum, which was burnt down in AD 462 but rebuilt later, and the Senate at the eastern extremity of the Augusteion square which burnt down in AD 404 and again in AD 532. The Athena Lindia of the Senate of the Augusteion was one of at least two Athenas from the same sanctuary in Constantinople, for until the fire which destroyed the Lauseion, probably in AD 475, there was also a malachite Athena Lindia, according to Kedrenos, Comp. Hist. 1.616, made by Dipoinos and Skyllis, and given as a present by an Egyptian pharaoh to Cleobulos. This text is important in connection with the discussion on the Athena of the Forum of Constantine, which some maintain was the great bronze Athena of Pheidias. aTTaai Totç xaPL6(7T^POLS à|ieivouç èm Tfj ttóXči ôéôwKev ex^iv êXuíôaç ktX. : The incredible survival of the two statues in the fire which destroyed the Senate of the Augusteion in AD 404 is seen by Zosimos as a pagan miracle bringing hope to 'the more cultivated' inhabitants of the city.

It is not certain that anything more than the size of the Zeus at Olympia was copied in the statue built for the temple at Daphne erected by Antiochus.

Athenis Minervae aedes : The Parthenon in Athens, containing the chryselephantine statue by Pheidias. Ampelius includes a mention of this work in his eighth chapter, entitled Miracula mundi. The Athena Parthenos was not usually included in the canonical list of seven world wonders, but it is occasionally found there.2354 It is included in the list of wonders compiled by Ampelius, which reaches a total of twenty-one works. As is clear from this entry, the Athena Parthenos is chosen not for its artistic quality but simply because the shield was believed to have been fitted with a curious mechanism that was capable of destroying the whole work if tampered with. The development of this story can be traced back through several sources.2355 It most probably has no foundation in fact. For a discussion of this and the related sources, see Preisshofen.2356 ad sinistram clipeo : On the goddess's left side stood the shield, which she touched lightly with the fingers of her left hand. Pausanias, 1.24.7, says that the spear was on the same side as the shield, along with the coiled snake which lay near the shaft of the spear.2357 quem digito tangit : If this is a description of the statue, then it disagrees with the archaeological evidence, which shows that the goddess rested four fingers, not just one, on 2354 See, for instance, Anonymus Taurinensis, De VII mir. 1.73.1; Anonymus Taurinensis, De VII mir. 1.73.2 and Anonymus Paradoxographus, De Incred. where the Parthenos is mentioned as a possible eighth. 2355 Ps.

As stated above, Ampelius is interested only in the mechanism of the shield and how it worked, so one should not expect a description of the statue in this passage. Preisshofen describes this detail as 'pseudo-information' given by the author to try to explain how the whole statue, not just the shield, could be destroyed once the shield portrait was removed.2358 in quo clipeo medio : The earliest source stating that the shield portrait which operated the destruction mechanism was in the middle of the shield is Ps- Aristotle, De Mundo , 6 (399B), dating from the earlier 2nd century AD. This information is undoubtedly incorrect, for archaeological evidence shows that in the middle of the Amazonomachy there was a large gorgoneion. See Volume 1, chapter 6.3C, 112ff. Several sources which mention shield portraits do not specify that they were centrally positioned.2359 Daedalus : For notes on the semi-mythical Greek artist and inventor Daidalos, see Himerios, Or. 24.14. The story about the cunning device on the shield which was supposed to hold the whole statue together is quite widespread, but in other versions it is not a likeness of Daidalos that was involved, but one of Pheidias himself. Preisshofen regards this change in the story as further pseudo-information by Ampelius, an embellishment of the story which makes sense if the author is trying to stress the importance of the wonder mechanism, since Daidalos was the greatest of Greek inventors.2360 Preisshofen dismisses out of hand the idea of a portrait of Daidalos on the shield. He is also highly sceptical of the idea that Pheidias was represented on the shield. Plutarch, Per. 31, states that the figure of Pheidias is to be identified as the bald old man hurling a stone, a figure that can be seen on the Lenormant shield and that appears unlike the rest of those in the Greek force.2361 gramine : Arnaud-Lindet suggests the emendation aeramine here, meaning made of bronze.2362 It is probable that the spear was made of metal, and gilded bronze seems most likely. Parallels for statues with cane spears have been found.2363 2358 Preisshofen (1974) 62-63. 2359 See Valerius Maximus, VIII. 14.6, and Plutarch, Per. 31. 2360 Preisshofen (1974) 62. 2361 Fig. 6.32.

Latin text : Assmann, E (1946) Ampelii Liber Memorialis. Leipzig: Teubner © K. G. Saur, München, Leipzig. Date : 2nd-3rd century AD. Chapter Eight of the Liber Memorialis deals with wonders of the world in two different groups: sections 1-17 list wonders of different natures classed geographically, while sections 18-23 list the more traditional seven wonders of the ancient world as found in Hyginus and Vibius Sequester. This suggests that all three authors were deriving their information from a common but now lost source, possibly Varro. The seven wonders included in the list are: 1 . The Artemision at Ephesos. 2. The tomb of Icarus (possibly a mistake for Mausolos). 3. The Colossus of Rhodes. 4. The Zeus at Olympia. 5. The Palace of Cyrus. 6. The Walls of Babylon. 7. The Pyramids of Egypt. Assmann thought that marginal notes made on the manuscript had been interpolated into the original text, and he therefore divided the text into two columns. Arnaud-Lindet disagrees with this idea and gives the text as follows: Signum louis Olympii eburneum, fades ex auro , quod fecit Phidias, &lt;altum&gt; cubitis centum quinquaginta et latum cubitis sexaginta. (Arnaud-Lindet, M.-P. (1993) Ampelius, Liber Memorialis. Collection des universités de France. Budé edition. Paris: Les Belles Lettres.) No ancient manuscript of Ampelius survives. In 1638, Claude de Saumaise published his edited text of Florus, along with the text of Ampelius which he had copied from a friend's manuscript some twenty years earlier and which he described as very corrupt and full of errors.2364 His friend was perhaps F. Juret; the manuscript Saumaise copied later 2364 Saumaise, L. Annaeus Florus. CI. Salmasius add. L. Ampelium e cod. MS. nunquam antehac editum, Ludg. Bat. (1638) 301.</page><page sequence="354">LATIN SOURCES 1005 disappeared. Arnaud-Lindet thinks it likely that Juret's manuscript came from Saint- Benigne of Dijon and that it dated from the beginning of the 9th century AD. The sole manuscript now available (the Monacensis latinus 1038a ) is a copy with writing in three different hands. The main text is written in one hand, perhaps that of a secretary who wrote down the text deciphered by Saumaise from Juret's manuscript; the text was then corrected by Saumaise probably, for his editio princeps of 1638 (for the corrections made all agree with that edition); a later hand then added a few further, and mostly very arbitrary, corrections. Cypro : The manuscript reads Cip- with the correction Cyp- (probably by Saumaise). It has therefore been thought possible that Ampelius is here referring to a copy in Cyprus of the Zeus at Olympia, made following the enormous success of this work. Several copies of the Zeus seem to have been made in ancient times: for example, the chryselephantine one in Berytos.2365 If one follows Assmann's text, it would seem that the copy in Cyprus was made of bronze with a face of gold. Arnaud-Lindet, however, disagrees with this reading of the text and is of the opinion that Ampelius was not talking about a copy of the Zeus at Olympia, but about the statue itself, which was made of ivory and gold. Hence her emendations: aereum is corrected to eburneum and Cypro is moved to the previous section, 19, in which Ampelius describes the colossus of Rhodes. signum Iovis Olympii aereum : The statue of Zeus at Olympia, for which see Pausanias, V.l 1.1-10, was made of gold and ivory, not bronze, though parts of it may well have been of gilded bronze. The bodily parts would have been made of ivory, while the drapery would have been of gold. Exactly what technique was employed to make the statue remains under discussion, because of the discovery in Pheidias's workshop at Olympia of moulds for producing glass drapery.2366 Whether the moulds are connected with the Zeus statue is not yet known. altum cubitis centum quinqua ginta etc. : The Roman cubit measured 0.444m.2367 If Ampelius was using this measurement, then his dimensions - 66.6m high and 26.64m broad - are excessive, about five times the recorded size of the statue.2368 The measurements Ampelius gives for the statue are in fact almost those of the temple itself, which measured 64.12m long and 27.68m wide. It seems probable, therefore, that Ampelius has simply misunderstood or misquoted his source here.2369 2365 Codex Vat. Graec. 989 , Xen., ult. fol. 110.

This passage occurs in the story of the life of St. Philip, Bishop of Heraclea in Thrace. He was martyred around AD 304 in the Diocletian persecution. hie excussit eum etc. : Various pagan monuments destroyed by fire (ignis ille divinus) are mentioned here. The monuments in question are a statue of an Ephesian deity; the Capitol and a temple in Rome; "Eliagabalus"; the Serapeion in Alexandria; the temple of Dionysos Eleuthereus in Athens; a statue of Minerva also in Athens; and the temple of Apollo in Delphi. This passage is very similar to one written by Clemens of Alexandria at the beginning of the 3rd century AD (AD 200-203): Protrep. IV.53.2-3.

This fire consumed the temple at Argos along with the priestess, Chryse.

At Athens it destroyed the temple of Dionysos</page><page sequence="356">LATIN SOURCES 1007 Eleuthereus and at Delphi the temple of Apollo was first devastated by a hurricane and then wiped out by this wise fire. (Mondésert, C. &amp; Plassart, A. (1949) Le Protreptique. Clément d'Alexandrie. Sources chrétiennes, no. 2. Paris: Ed. du Cerf.) The passage from the Passio Philippi differs from that of Clemens in several particulars: it omits any mention of Argos; it does not mention the temple at Ephesos but only a god (eum quem Ephesini Deum habere se credunt)' and it adds two new monuments not listed by Clemens, the statue of Minerva in Athens and the temple of Elagabalus in Rome (if this is the correct interpretation of et Templům; hic Eliagabalum pari cremavit incendio). The mention of Elagabalus suggests that the Passio passage must date from after the time of Clemens, and that it was written using Clemens as a source. For Elagabalus was Roman Emperor from AD 218 to 222. Eliagabalum : Presumably a misspelling of Elagabalus, the Roman Emperor who was the hereditary priest of the sun-god of Emesa in Syria (called Elah-Gabal). He came to Rome in AD 219 and tried to establish his religion there, making the chief god deus invictus Sol Elagabalus and having two great temples built in his honour. The Praetorians murdered the Emperor and his mother in AD 222. arsit et armata Minerva : The word et suggests that the Minerva is another monument from Athens, for in the previous sentence our author was talking about the burning of the temple of Dionysus Eleuthereus in Athens. The information that can be gleaned about this statue is that it represented the armed goddess Minerva, with the gorgoneum on her breast and beautifully adorned weapons. Führer and Prag have both connected this reference with the Athena Parthenos of Pheidias.2370 Certainly the description given of the statue in the Passio does not conflict with what is known of the Parthenos. Marinos, Vita Pr. XXX, confirms that the Parthenos was still standing in the Parthenon during the period when Proklos lived in Athens (around AD 429-485). Therefore, if this passage from the Passio is a reference to the Parthenos and its final destruction, it must date from some time in the 5th century AD at the earliest. The traditional interpretation of the relevant words in Marinos is that the statue was removed from the Parthenon during the period Proklos spent in Athens, probably around AD 435 when the Emperor Theodosius II ordered the destruction of the temples. What happened to the statue subsequently is not known though it has been suspected, for no very good reason, that it was removed to Constantinople, like the Zeus at Olympia.2371 In the light of the Passio passage, Führer put forward the suggestion that Marinos is talking only of an intention to move the Parthenos in the time of Proklos and that in fact this intention was never carried out. He supposed that the statue was destroyed by fire, probably while it remained standing in its temple and could still be regarded as a cult image. There is no evidence to prove that the Parthenos is indeed the Minerva mentioned in the Passio. There is also no proof that the edict of AD 435 had any effect upon the Parthenos. Certain temples remained open and in use well after that date. The Athenian Asklepieion, for instance, is known to have been in use as late as the 460s 2370 Führer (1892) 158-65, and Prag (1972) 102-03. 2371 See notes to Aristides, Or. 34.28, scholion by Arethas.</page><page sequence="357">1008 WRITTEN SOURCES and 470s. In addition, Marcian's edict of AD 451 indicates that, despite the publication of the Theodosian code in AD 438, certain cult effigies did still stand in some temples. And yet the great silence about what became of the statue after this time, as well as the abundant evidence of fire damage in the Parthenon mean that Führer' s suggestion cannot be ruled out. As far as the date of the removal or destruction of the Parthenos is concerned, Trombley is of the opinion that the Parthenos was left undisturbed until the very end of the life of Proklos, around AD 484.2372 Another possibility which must be considered is that the Parthenos was substantially replaced after being damaged by fire while still in use as a cult statue. The reference in the Passio might then be interpreted as talking not about the ultimate fate of the statue but about an event that took place earlier in the statue's history. Dinsmoor, Picard and Stevens all put forward evidence for such a fire: Dinsmoor suggested that it occurred as early as the the 2nd century BC, while Stevens preferred the 2nd century AD or later.2373 Koch and Goethert argued strongly against Dinsmoor' s view that the Parthenos was destroyed in Hellenistic times and they showed that the evidence for a fire in the Parthenon and the well-known repairs to the statue pedestal could equally well point to a date in late Roman or even Byzantine times.2374 Leipen does not agree with Dinsmoor either, stating that many of the Roman copies of the Parthenos are so pedantic and painstaking in their attempt to transmit certain details of the statue that they must reflect more than a Hellenistic replica of the original, especially since the surviving pre-Hellenistic copies of the work are mostly either too small or too sketchy to have provided sufficient information for the creation of an accurate replica of the original.2375 Nevertheless, in agreement with Stevens, Leipen does think it possible that the statue was destroyed by fire in the later 2nd or 3rd century AD and then reconstructed. Prag, on the other hand, suggests that all the fire damage and the changes made to the pedestal belong to the period at the end of the existence of the Parthenos, at the point when the statue was destroyed and the temple was converted into a Christian church.2376 ANONYMUS, Expositio Totius Mundi et Gentium , LII.

If this analysis is correct and it is true that a reference is made here to the Akropolis as one of the most noteworthy features of Athens in the mid 4th century AD, then it suggests that the Athenian Akropolis was still largely unscathed at the time. This impression is not contradicted by other sources.2378 ANONYMUS, Mirabilia Urbis Romae , 14. quare factus est caballus marmoreus. caballi marmorei ad quod facti fuerunt nudi et quid nuncient . . . temporibus Tiberii imperatoris venerunt Romam duo adulescentuli iuvenes Praxitelus et Fidia .

The mechanism is referred to both in the Corpus Aristotelicum passage just mentioned and in Valerius Maximus, Fact.

Amongst sculptors, the first to be mentioned is Pheidias: when he had produced, with immense effort, the image of Jupiter, he inscribed on the finger of the god, "Pantarces is beautiful" (for that was the name of a boy whom he loved and whom he desired with an obscene passion) and he was not troubled by any fear or by religious scruple to call the god by the name of a prostitute, and even to curse the divine power of Jupiter and his image with a corrupted person.

Phidias : Pausanias, V.10.2, preserves the information that Pheidias was an Athenian, and in Book 1 of his Description of Greece , he mentions a number of Pheidias's works which were to be found in the city. His most famous commission in Athens was the Athena Parthenos. It is probable that Pheidias was also the artist in charge of the sculptures of the Parthenon, as Plutarch, Per. 13, says. This matter is discussed in Volume 1, The Parthenon. Other famous works by the master that were produced in Athens included the great bronze Athena and the Athena Lemnia, for which see Pausanias, 1.28.2; perhaps the Aphrodite Ourania, mentioned in Pausanias, 1.14.7, perhaps the Mother of the Gods in the Metroon, Pausanias, 1.3.5, and Arrian, Peripl. 9.1, and the Apollo Parnopios, Pausanias, 1.24.8, though there are doubts about the validity of Pausanias's attribution in these cases.

In other words, it was a temple and it contained a cult image, facts which have sometimes been doubted.2393 The Parthenon was also a repository of the goddess's treasure, but its role as a treasury was secondary.

Not only were very gifted men not deterred from the highest studies, but even craftsmen did not stop practising their crafts because they were unable to imitate the beauty of the Ialysus, which we saw at Rhodes, or the beauty of the Coan Venus; nor were other, less expert sculptors deterred by the image of Olympian Jupiter or by the bronze statue of the Doryphoros from finding out what they could achieve or what progress they could make. There were so many of them, and so great was the merit of each, within his own class, that although we admire the best, nonetheless we approve the less excellent. Latin text : Wilkins, A. S.

O: 717. sed ego sic statuo, nihil esse in ullo genere tam pulchrum, quo non pulchrius id sit unde illud ut ex ore aliquo quasi imago exprimatur; quod neque oculis ñeque auribus neque ullo sensu percipi potest , cogitatione tantum et mente complectimur. itaque et Phidiae simulacris, quibus nihil in ilio genere perfectius videmus, et eis picturis quas nominavi cogitare tarnen possumus pulchriora ; nec vero ille artifex cum faceret Iovis formam aut Minervae, contemplabatur aliquem e quo similitudinem ducerei, sed ipsius in mente insidebat species pulchritudinis eximia quaedam, quam intuens in eaque defixus ad illius similitudinem artem et manum dirigebat. But my opinion is this: there is nothing of any kind so beautiful that there is not something more beautiful from which that thing is copied, as a mask is a copy of a face. This perfect original cannot be perceived by the eyes or ears or any other sense; we can, however, grasp it with our imagination and the mind. So, even with the statues of Phidias - and of their type we see nothing more perfect than these - and the paintings I have mentioned, we are nevertheless able to imagine something still more beautiful. Surely when that great sculptor was making the image of Jupiter or Minerva, he was not looking at some person from whom he was drawing a likeness; rather, in his own mind, there dwelt some outstanding vision of beauty. Gazing at this and concentrating on it, he directed his art and his hand to create the image of the god. Latin text : Wilkins, A. S. (1935) Ciceronis Orationes. Vol. II.

XII. 10, this passage, along with Brutus, 70, constitutes one of the earliest extant expositions of the theory of Greek art according to which spiritual intuition and imagination superseded simple imitation of nature, as art developed, until the culminating point was reached in the 5th century BC with the sculptures of Pheidias and, in the 4th century BC, with the paintings of Protogenes and Apelles, whom Cicero mentions in Or. 2.5. Cicero here bestows high praise on Pheidias 's works, especially the Zeus at Olympia and the Athena Parthenos, which he calls the most perfect creations in their genre.2395 He claims that in the production of these masterpieces, Pheidias was not drawing from the physical world around him, but rather he had in his mind a spiritual vision of the beauty of the gods and it was this that he was able to transmit in his works and make visible for other men. Polliti calls this the 'phantasia' theory of art.2396 He points out that this view of art is radically different from that found in the 'Xenokratic' tradition. Xenokrates, a Hellenistic sculptor who wrote a treatise on toreutice and who is quoted by Pliny as one of his sources, saw Lysippos in the early 4th century BC as the high point of Greek sculpture, with all that came before as part of the development towards perfection.2397 Pollitt also demonstrates the close connection between the 'phantasia' theory and rhetoric: it is in the writings of rhetoricians, such as Cicero, Quintilian, Seneca, Philostratos, Dio Chrysostomos, Demetrios, Dionysios of Halicarnassus, that the theory predominantly finds expression. Pollitt suggests that this perhaps springs from the original use of the theme of the development of Greek sculpture as an analogy for the development of rhetorical criticism by some influential rhetorician. As a source, he suggests Posidonius of Apamea (around 135-50 BC). He wrote a treatise on style, llepi Xe^ewç.2398 He was also a teacher of Cicero.2399 The theory clearly has roots within the philosophical traditions of Plato and Aristotle, with its contrast between imagination and imitation. Good [iÍ|it1(jiç, for Plato, meant imitation of ideal forms, of which nature is but a copy, rather than direct imitation of the world around us. Aristotle, De An. 428Aff., viewed (ķavraoia as derived from sense perception but remaining independent from it, as a faculty of the soul. In this passage the word species , for instance, is used in a philosophical sense, to mean more than just 'appearance'; it denotes 'idea' or 'conception' in the Platonic sense. And pulchritudo is understood as an abstract quality, perceived by the mind. This is why even the most beautiful statues in the world cannot wholly express such beauty, according to Cicero. Nevertheless, Pheidias's great achievement remains: the ability to make visible to others, in a manner never equalled by other sculptors, some of his own insight into the nature of the gods. 2395 Pausanias, V.l 1.1-10 and I.24.5ff., respectively. 2396 Pollitt (1974) 52ff. 2397 For Xenokrates, see Schweitzer (1932). 2398 See Diogenes Laertius, VII.60. 2399 Cicero, Nat.

But if loose styles please someone more, let him of course use them, but in the same way as one who would take apart the shield of Phidias - destroying the beauty of the composition but not the charm of the individual pieces. Latin text : Wilkins, A. S. (1935) Ciceronis Orationes. Vol. II. Oxford: Clarendon Press © Oxford University Press. Date : 46 BC. soluta . . . Phidiae clipeum : Cicero is discussing loose styles of oratory, of which the best sort he characterizes as being made up of individually beautiful parts though lacking a tight overall structure. To illustrate his meaning, he takes a very well-known work of art - the shield of the Athena Parthenos by Pheidias - and says that if someone were to take this apart the relation of the figures would be destroyed, but the figures themselves would remain as beautiful as before. Concerning the shield, see Volume 1, chapter 6.3. A very different interpretation of Cicero's words was made, it seems, by later ancient writers, who took the passage literally and understood it to mean that if the shield were taken apart, in particular if the likeness of Pheidias, which Cicero mentions in Tusc. 1.15.34, were removed, then the whole shield would collapse and be destroyed. Some even said there was a secret device attaching Pheidias 's image to the shield and that this kept the whole shield, or even the whole statue, together.2400 The tale seems fanciful, and the sources relating it are all late, so their reliability must be questioned. Ampelius, Lib. Mem. 8.10, even changes the facts to the extent of saying that the iinch-pin' image was that of Daedalus, not Pheidias, and he says it was placed in the centre of the shield, where there was certainly a gorgoneion.2401 CICERO, Paradoxa Stoicorum, Praefatio 5. hoc tamen opus in acceptum ut referas nihil postulo; non enim est tale, ut in arce poni possit quasi Minerva Phidiae, sed tamen ut ex eadem officina exisse appareat. 2400 See Corpus Aristotelicum, De Mundo , 6 (399B) and De Mir.

Date : Published at the beginning of 46 BC. in arce . . . quasi Minerva Phidiae : There were several Athena statues by Pheidias on the Athenian Akropolis in antiquity: the chryselephantine Athena Parthenos; the Athena Lemnia; and the great bronze Athena.2402 Cicero says that the Paradoxa is not the best work he has ever written. He claims that it is just a minor piece, though recognizably by him. Like a minor work by Pheidias, it is clearly in the same style as the great masterpieces but not such as one would deem good enough to display on the Akropolis. CICERO, Tusculanae Disputationes, 1.15.34. O: 674. opifices post mortem nobilitari volunt. quid enim Phidias sui similem speciem inclusit clupeo Minerv ae, cum inscribere &lt;nomen&gt; non liceret? Artists want to be renowned after they die. Why else did Pheidias include a representation of himself on the shield of Minerva, when he was not allowed to inscribe his name? Latin text : Pohlenz, M. (1918) Cicero, Tusculanae Disputationes . Leipzig: Teubner. Date : 45 BC. In this section of the treatise, Cicero is expounding the view that the wise man does not fear death. Artists, of course, live on through their works of art. This is an idea often expressed, especially by the poets.2403 opifices : A general word meaning all who work with their hands, from the greatest sculptor to the most lowly mechanic. Ancient writers often express contempt for artisans and craftsmen in general. See Lucian, Somn. 9 and notes. quid enim Phidias sui similem speciem inclusit clipeo Minervae : On the outer surface of the shield of the Athena Parthenos was the depiction of an Amazonomachy.2404 Cicero here affirms that in this composition Pheidias included a likeness of himself. He does not 2402 For these works see Volume 1, chapters 6, 5, and 8, and Pausanias, 1.24.5-7 and 1.28.2. 2403 See for instance, Horace, Odes III.30 and IV.8 and 9. 2404 Pliny, NH 36.18.</page><page sequence="373">1024 WRITTEN SOURCES call it a portrait, and he does not connect the likeness with any amazing device to keep the work together, as some later writers do.2405 But it is possible that Cicero knew a version of the story that was familiar to Dio Chrysostomos, Or. XII. 6, and Plutarch, Per . 31, according to which Pheidias had discreetly included portraits of both himself and Perikles on the outside of the shield. According to Preisshofen, the story of the shield portrait, or portraits, cannot be earlier than about the 3rd century BC.2406 inscribere &lt;nomen&gt; non liceret : Cicero thought that Pheidias's reason for including a likeness of himself on the shield was no doubt to replace his signature for, he says, Pheidias was not allowed to sign the work. If it is true that Pheidias was not allowed to sign this work, it is not clear why this should have been so. Artists of the period generally did sign their works and the sources confirm that at least two of Pheidias's works - the Zeus at Olympia and the Athena Lemnia - did bear his name.2407 The Zeus of Olympia, like the Parthenos, was a cult statue. See also Plutarch, Per. 13, who says that Pheidias's name, as the artist of the Parthenos, was engraved on a stele.

There is no information about these supposedly Pheidian pieces, but it is at least possible that the reference is to sculptures. The reliability of the attribution of the works to Pheidias is questionable. COLUMELLA, De Re Rustica It Praefat ., 31 (Bipont, 21).

Already, through so many ages, we see that not even artists of lesser fame have abandoned their work because of their admiration for Protogenes, Apelles and Parrhasios. Nor did the fact that they were bowled over by the beauty of Pheidias 's Olympian Jupiter and his Minerva make artists of the next generation - Bryaxis, Lysippus, Praxiteles, Polyclitus - feel loath to find out what they could achieve or what progress they could make. But in every branch of science there come admiration and veneration for the most excellent and well deserved praise for the less outstanding. Latin text : Ash, H. B. (1960) Res Rustica , Vol. I, 24. Loeb Classical Library. London: W. Heinemann and Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. Date : This work was probably published in AD 65. Protogenes , Apelles, Parrhasios : Famous artists of the 5th and 4th centuries BC.2408 In Book 35.79, Pliny dates Apelles in the 112th Olympiad (332-329 BC) and in Book 36.81-83, 88, and 101 he makes clear that Protogenes and Apelles were contemporaries. In Book 35.60, Pliny gives the 90th Olympiad, 420-417 BC as the floruit of Euenor, the father of Parrhasios and, in 35.65, he names Zeuxis as his contemporary and rival. Pliny dates Zeuxis to the 95th Olympiad (400-397 BC) in Book 35.61. It seems probable that Euenor and Parrhasios lived earlier than Pliny thought. Pausanias (1.28.2) records that Parrhasios designed the engravings for the shield of the great bronze Athena of Pheidias, and there is evidence of a sculptor named Euenor working on the Athenian Akropolis in the early years of the 5th century BC.

Columella probably places him with the younger generation of artists because he is following the same sources as Pliny, NH 34.49, who dates his aKļiTļ in 420-417 BC while he puts that of Pheidias in 448-445 BC.

Venerable bronze statues of several other temples, of which our ancestors in their illusion proudly boasted for many years, were subjected to the eyes of all throughout the fora of the city named after the Emperor. So that they would be completely exposed to the mockery and insult of viewers, the Pythian Apollo was put on display in one place, the Sminthian in another, and the Delphic tripods in the Circus itself indeed; the Muses of Helicon, however, were exhibited in the Palace. In the end that city named after the Emperor was completely filled with bronze statues, which had been made with elegant workmanship, and once dedicated in every province. Latin text : Migne, J. P.

After Constantine 's day the Zeus of Olympia certainly spent some time in Constantinople, before perishing in a fire that destroyed the palace in which it had been housed.2412 EXCERPTA BARBARI , ap.

LXXXV Olymp. /Persarum XXVI : The date given is the second year of Olympiad 85, that is 439 BC and the event noted is the making of the ivory Minerva of Pheidias, that is, the chryselephantine Athena Parthenos. Presumably Hieronymus is referring to the completion of the statue, which was many years in the making. This reference constitutes important evidence for the dating of the Athena Parthenos. It accords well with the date given by Philochoros, as quoted in the scholia to Aristophanes, Pax, 605-06, for the inauguration of the statue in 438 BC. The likely occasion for the inauguration would have been the Great Panathenaia which were celebrated at the beginning of the Attic year. So it is probable that the statue was finished shortly before this event. HIERONYMUS, Chronicorum Canonum Liber, 155.17-18 (ed. Helm). simulacrum Olympiad Iouis tactum fulmine.

Eusebios refers to this event in Praep. Evang. IV. 2. 8. Pausanias, V.11.9, says that lightning struck a spot near the statue in the time of Pheidias, shortly after he had completed the statue. The lightning was interpreted by some as a sign of approval sent by Zeus in answer to Pheidias 's prayer.

The measurements of this author are not to be believed. It is known from other sources, including Kallimachos, Iambi VI, fragm. 196, that the Jupiter measured around 12.3m in height and since the Roman foot equalled 296mm, Hyginus's 60 feet would make the Jupiter an incredible 17.78m high. As Jeppesen says, if the Zeus had been 60ft high this would have made the statue just under double the height of the pteron columns, which were about 32ft high, clearly an impossible situation.2416 In addition, several other dimensions given by Hyginus are known to be wrong, and it is suspicious that he gives 60ft as the height not only of the Zeus at Olympia, but also of the pyramids of Egypt and the walls of Babylon.

Argenti genus omne comparasti : Martial is writing about the fabulous silver collection of a man called Charinus, who boasted ownership of pieces by some of the greatest artists of the Greek Classical period. Myron; Praxiteles ; Scopas; Phidias; Mentor : The artists are mentioned in order of increasing importance in the field of silverwork, Mentor being the greatest name in this domain, and the others being more famous for other types of work: Myron for his bronze sculpture; Praxiteles and Scopas for their marble sculpture; and Pheidias for his chryselephantine statues. According to some sources, Pheidias was supposed to have produced miniatures in precious metals.2422 Whether or not this is true, he certainly had a reputation for intricate and detailed decoration of even the most restricted areas of his colossal chryselephantine works, some of which would undoubtedly have been engraved or 2422 So Julian, Ep. 8, and Gregoras, Hist.

It is often used to distinguish Pheidias's art from that of bronze or marble sculptors and probably refers to his fine engraving work on precious materials, in particular on ivory and gold in his most famous works, the monumental chryselephantine statues.

To say that Pheidias, the most famous of chryselephantine artists, would have been proud to create this work is to bestow the highest possible praise upon it. Polykleitos was more famous as a bronze worker, and as a creator of statues of humans. See, for instance, Quintilian, Inst. Or. XII. 10.8 and notes. Pomponius MELA, De Chorographica , II. 3.42.

Pisa : In VI.22.2 Pausanias indicates where Pisa once stood, a little to the east of Olympia, but Strabo, 8.3.31, casts doubt on whether a city by such a name ever existed. Pisa is often confused with Olympia and Elis in the ancient sources. The people of Pisa were independent of the Eleians in early times, and there was always great rivalry between them. Pisa held the presidency of the Olympic Games from 668 BC till around 580 BC. But probably in around 570 BC Pisa was destroyed by its enemies the Eleians, who subsequently took control of the Games.2424 In 364 BC, the 104th Olympiad, the Arkadians helped the Pisaians to hold the Games. But the Eleians quickly regained the upper hand for, in 363 BC, to celebrate their victory over the Arkadians, they dedicated what Pausanias described as the largest statue of Zeus in the sanctuary of Olympia (Pausanias, V.24.4). They also declared the Games of the previous year invalid (Pausanias, VI.4.2). Elis, which long administered the sanctuary, is situated north of Olympia. Strabo, 8.3.30, states that the temple of Zeus was less than 300 stades from Elis. Oenomaus : O'ivoļiaos, king of Elis, father of Hippodamia. Pomponius MELA, De Chorographica , II. 3. 46. O: 842.

This mistake is copied later by Soliņus, Col. VII.26. Phidiaca Nemesis : The statue of Nemesis was probably not by Phidias, but by his pupil Agorakritos of Paros.

A household slave dear to Pericles, the leader of the Athenians, when he was building the temple on the citadel, he crawled over the top of the gable end of the roof and from there he fell; he was said to have been made well again by this plant, shown to Pericles in a dream by Minerva, for which reason it started to be called "parthenium" and was consecrated to the goddess. Latin text : Mayhoff, C. (1892) Plinius. Naturalis Historia. Vol. III. Leipzig: Teubner. Date : Mid 1st century AD (the work was dedicated to Titus in AD 77). in arce templům : The temple that was built on the Akropolis in the time of Perikles was the Parthenon. According to this story, the goddess Athena appeared to Perikles in a dream and indicated to him a plant which would cure his slave after the terrible accident. The story provides an etymological explanation for the name of the plant, parthenium , or parthenion , from the goddess's epithet Parthenos. In fact Pliny uses the same name to</page><page sequence="392">LATIN SOURCES 1043 designate several different plants. See, for instance, NH 21.176. A different version of the same story is found in Plutarch, Per. 13.13. According to Plutarch, the slave fell off the Propylaia and in thanks to Athena for her saving help, Perikles set up a statue of Athena Hygieia near the Propylaia. Plutarch does not tell us the name of the plant which cured the fallen man. Pausanias, 1.23.4, saw a statue of Athena Hygieia near the Propylaia when he visited the Akropolis in the 2nd century AD, and indeed the statue base of a bronze statue dedicated to Athena Hygieia in the 5th century BC has been discovered close to the Propylaia. But the statue in question was dedicated by the Athenian people not by Perikles and, judging from the letter forms of the inscription, it was probably not set up before the 420s BC. It seems probable from this information that Plutarch's story was a fanciful explanation of the fact that there was a statue of Athena Hygieia on the Akropolis, and Pliny's account is no more than a variation of this story. From the point of view of the Athena Parthenos it is interesting to note that Pliny's story only makes sense if the epithet Parthenos was commonly applied to the goddess Athena on the Athenian Akropolis. Although it is not known when this name came to be given to Pheidias's image, it is clear that this happened from fairly early on. It goes back at least as far as the late 4th century BC, to judge from some fragments of Philippides, apud Plutarch, Dem. 26.2425 PLINY, Naturalis Historia , Book 34, section 49. O: 620. minoribus simulacris signisque innumera prope artificum multitudo nobilitata est, ante omnes tarnen Phidias Atheniensis love Olympio facto ex ebore quidem et auro , sed et ex aere signa fecit, floruit autem olympiade LXXXIII, circiter CCC urbis nostrae annum, quo eodem tempore aemuli eius fuere Alcamenes, Critias, Nesiotes, Hegias, et deinde olympiade LXXXVII Hageladas, Callón, Górgias Lacón. A countless number of artists has been made famous by smaller images and statues. Before them all, however, stands Phidias of Athens, who made the Jupiter at Olympia out of ivory and gold, though he also made statues of bronze. He flourished in the 83rd. Olympiad, about three hundred years after the foundation of Rome. His rivals, of the same period, were Alcamenes, Critias, Nesiotes, Hegias and then, in the 87th Olympiad, Hageladas, Callón, Górgias Lacón. Latin text : Mayhoff, C. (1897) Plinius. Naturalis Historia. Vol. V. Leipzig: Teubner. Date : Mid 1st century AD (the work was dedicated to Titus in AD 77). Book 34 deals with bronze and bronze art. 2425 Concerning Pliny, NH 22.44, see Nick (2002) 117, 120f., 142, 166, 225, Test. 76. Nick points to Pliny's use of the word templům in this passage to refer to the Parthenon as evidence of its status as more than just a treasury.</page><page sequence="393">1044 WRITTEN SOURCES Phidias Atheniensis loue Olympio etc . : It is natural that Pliny should identify Pheidias by his most renowned work, the Zeus at Olympia, but Pliny does not discuss the work at all in what follows as the statue was made of gold and ivory and therefore it is not relevant to the subject of this book, which is bronze. He mentions the work again, briefly, in 7.127; 34.54; and 36.18. Pliny gives a list of the bronze works of Pheidias which he knew about in 34.54. Floruit autem olympiade LXXXIII, circiter CCC urbis nostrae annum : Pliny gives the 83rd. Olympiad, 448-445 BC, as the date of the floruit of Pheidias, as well as the commencement of bronze art and the art of painting in Greece.2426 By his reckoning this would place the beginning of the art of marble sculpture 332 years earlier. For the benefit of his Roman readers, Pliny also gives the Roman equivalent of the Greek dating. The fact that Pliny dates artists by Olympiads, supplying a Roman concordance, suggests strongly that his source for this material was Greek and it was probably Apollodoros, who in his work ' Etti c^avwv àvôpûv ßious dated people not by the year of their birth but according to their floruit , in Greek, fjKfiaae. The choice of the 83rd Olympiad for Pheidias 's floruit can be explained on the grounds that it was during this period that work on the Parthenon started, a project on which Pheidias is believed to have been heavily involved.2427 It was also during this period that he began to work on the sacred image for the Parthenon, the Athena Parthenos, his most famous work apart from the Olympian Zeus. Pliny's suggestion that bronze art started only in the time of Pheidias is obviously inaccurate and all the more peculiar in that Pliny himself sometimes mentions bronze artists of earlier generations elsewhere in his account. For instance, Kalamis is mentioned in chapter 71, Kanachos in chapter 75, Theodoros of Samos in chapter 83, and Dipoinos and Skyllis in Book 36, chapters 9-10. Of the artists mentioned here as Pheidias's contemporaries, most belong to an earlier period. Such confusion is not surprising, for the grasp of the chronology of the Archaic period in Greek art by ancient commentators was extremely hazy.2428 Concerning Pliny's dating of the beginnings of painting and marble sculpture, see notes to passages in Book 35.54 and Book 36.15-19 respectively. aemuli : When Pliny says that the following artists were Pheidias's rivals, he is probably using the term in a fairly general sense meaning no more than 'of rival merit', as Sellers suggested.2429 Alcamenes : Pheidias had a pupil called Alkamenes, a younger man who, as one gathers from Pausanias, V.11.6, was at work until the end of the 5th century BC. Pliny himself refers to Alkamenes as Pheidias's pupil rather than as his rival in 34.72 and 36.16, and it is this man who made, for instance, the famous 'AcķpoSiTTļ Lv kt1ttoiç, which Pliny 2426 See Pliny, NH 36.15. 2427 Plutarch, Per. 13. 2428 See Kalkmann (1898) 64ff. 2429 Sellers (1896) 36-37, n. 9.</page><page sequence="394">LATIN SOURCES 1045 mentions in 36.16. This artist can hardly have had the same floruit as Pheidias. It is possible that there was more than one 5th century BC artist by the name of Alkamenes. See notes to Pausanias, V.10.8. Critias, Nesiotes : Two Greek sculptors of the early 5th century BC, who often worked in partnership. Critias is the form of the name found in the late literary tradition only; it is surely a corruption of the name Kritios, found in inscriptions. The two artists, Kritios and Nesiotes, are best known for the statue group of the Tyrannicides, set up in the Athenian Agora in 477 BC to replace the group made by Antenor and stolen by the Persians. These artists belong to the generation before Pheidias. Nesiotes is not mentioned again by Pliny; Kritios only en passant in 34.85. Hegias : It seems probable that Hegias is the diminutive form of the name Hegesias, an artist of the generation before Pheidias. Pausanias, VIII.42.10, says that Hegias was a contemporary of Hageladas. Dio Chrysostomos, Or. LV.l, says Hegias was the teacher of Pheidias, and Quintilian, Inst. Or. XII. 10.7, and Lucian, Rhet. Praec. 9, both talk of Hegesias as a contemporary of Kritios and Nesiotes. In NH 34.78 Pliny talks of Hegias and 'Hagesias' as if they were two different people, but this may simply be because, following his source, he has used the Doric form of the name and failed to notice its connection with the name Hegias. If this analysis is correct then Pliny is mistaken in calling Hegias an aemulus of Pheidias as he does here.2430 Hageladas : Sometimes called Ageladas or Hagelaidas or even Geladas (so Tzetzes, Chil. VII.922), this Argive artist is reputed to have been the teacher of Myron and Polykleitos, according to Pliny, NH 34.55 and 57, and the teacher of Pheidias, according to the very late source Tzetzes (Chil. VII.922 and VIII.325) and the scholion for Aristophanes, Ran. 501. Pliny places him in the 87th Olympiad, that is 432-429 BC, which is clearly much too late. From Pausanias, VI.8.6, 10.6 and 14.11, one gathers that he was at work at the end of the 6th century BC, making athlete statues for Olympic victors, and that his career continued into the first half of the 5th century BC.2431 The mistake about his dates seems to have arisen due to the attribution to Hageladas of a Herakles Alexikakos which was supposed to have been set up by the Athenians at the time of a great plague and this is usually taken to be the plague of 430 BC. This must however be wrong, as the date does not accord with anything else that is known about Hageladas.2432 2430 See Le Bonniec (1953) 198 n. 8 and 255 n. 12. 243 1 For his statue of Zeus Ithomatas, which was probably made before 456 BC, see Pausanias IV.33.2 and for the work made as the offering of the Tarentines at Delphi, probably after 473 BC, see Pausanias X.10.6. 2432 See scholion, Aristophanes Ran. 501. See also Le Bonniec (1953) 198-99 n. 9 for a discussion of this matter. For a different view see Corso (1995) 173 and n. 1.</page><page sequence="395">1046 WRITTEN SOURCES PLINY, Naturalis Historia , Book 34, section 53. venere autem et in certamen laudatissimi, quamquam diversis aetatibus geniti , quoniam fecerant Amazonas , quae cum in templo Dianae Ephesiae dicarentur , placuit eligi probatissimam ipsorum artifìcum, qui praesentes erant, iudicio , cum apparuit earn esse , quam omnes secundam a sua quisque iudicassent. haec est Polycliti, próxima ab ea Phidiae, tertia Cresilae, quarta Cydonis, quinta Phradmonis. Although they were born at different times, the most famous artists did come into competition, since they had made statues of Amazons and, when these were going to be dedicated in the temple of Diana at Ephesos, it was decided that they should choose which was the best according to the judgement of the very artists who were present. This turned out to be the statue which they had all judged to be second to their own, that is, the statue of Polykleitos; next to this one came that of Pheidias, third came that of Cresilas, fourth that of Cydon and fifth that of Phradmon. Latin text : Mayhoff, C. (1897) Plinius. Naturalis Historia. Vol. V. Leipzig: Teubner. Date : Mid 1st century AD (the work was dedicated to Titus in AD 77). in certamen : Competitions amongst ancient artists seem to have been quite common. Pliny tells of a competition between Alkamenes and Agorakritos in NH 36.17 and Tzetzes describes one between Pheidias and Alkamenes in Chil. VIII.333ff. The name Cydon, cited here, is not attested elsewhere, whereas the ethnic of the Cretan artist Cresilas was Ku8ū)victTT]s. It is therefore highly probable that Pliny has misinterpreted his source and that four of the artists commissioned to make Amazon statues were Polykleitos, Pheidias, Kresilas and Phradmon. As there seems to be some confusion between the names Ctesilaus and Cresilas in manuscripts of Pliny, it is possible, though not certain, that Cresilas's Amazon was shown wounded. In NH 34.53, Cresilas is mentioned as one of the artists who made an Amazon at Ephesos, but the genitive, Cresilae, becomes Clesilae, Ctesilae and Ctesilai in other manuscripts. In NH 34.74, Cresilas, sometimes written as Ctesilas or Ctesilaus, is credited with making a volneratum deficientem , a wounded and dying man. And in NH 34.75-76, an artist named Ctesilaus is said to have made an Amazonēm volneratam. An inscribed statue base, discovered at Ephesos, shows that a work by another famous Classical artist, Alkamenes, was also housed in the Artemision.2433 The inscription probably dates from the mid 4th century BC. This suggests that the base carried a copy of a work by Alkamenes. According to Corso, however, who drew this piece to our attention, it is possible that an original by Alkamenes was fitted on to a new base in the mid 4th century BC, after the old base was damaged, perhaps in the great fire of 356 BC. 2433 See Içten and Engelmann (1995) 90.</page><page sequence="396">LATIN SOURCES 1047 quamquam . . . geniti : In chapter 49, Pliny said that Polykleitos and Phradmon, two of the artists who are supposed to have taken part in the competition described in this passage, flourished in the 90th Olympiad, that is seven Olympiads after Pheidias, according to his information. It is probable that Pliny has used two different sources and that his comment here is an attempt to reconcile them.2434 Polykleitos of Argos was a contemporary of Pheidias, but he probably outlived him, since he is said to have made the chryselephantine statue of Hera for the new temple at Argos, which was built after the fire of 423 BC. In NH 34.55 Pliny says that Polykleitos was a pupil of Hageladas, and since he places Hageladas in the 87th Olympiad (see NH 34.49), he is forced to put Polykleitos even later. The 90th Olympiad (420-417 BC) would coincide with the making of his great Hera at Argos, and would represent the end of his career rather than his floruit . Cresilas : A Greek sculptor from Cydonia in Crete, who worked mostly in Athens, and was active around 450-430 BC. He is best known for his portrait of Perikles which is preserved in copies. Phradmon : Not much is known about this Argive sculptor. Pliny places him in the 90th Olympiad, after Polykleitos, because of the participation of both these artists, according to Pliny, in the Ephesos competition. This may be correct, and such a date would fit in with Pausanias's attribution, in VI.8.1, of the statue of Amertes of Elis at Olympia to the same artist, if the victory of Amertes dates from after 448 BC. There is also evidence in Anth. Pal. 9.743, for a 4th century BC Phradmon, possibly a descendant of the late 5th century BC artist. PLINY, Naturalis Historia , Book 34, section 54.

Besides the Jupiter at Olympia, which none rivals, Pheidias made in like manner an ivory Minerva in Athens, which stands in the Parthenon. In bronze, besides the Amazon mentioned above, he made a Minerva of such outstanding beauty that she received the name 'the beauty'. He also made a "cliduchus" and another Minerva, which Paulus Aemilius dedicated at Rome, at the temple of the Fortune of the Day, and also two statues clad in Greek mantles which Catulus dedicated in the same temple, as well as a colossal nude statue. With good reason he is judged to have been the first to open up the art of carving in metal, showing its possibilities. 2434 See Kalkmann (1898) 56.</page><page sequence="397">1048 WRITTEN SOURCES Latin text : Mayhoff, C. (1897) Plinius. Naturalis Historia. Vol. V. Leipzig: Teubner.

Minervám : The Athena Parthenos was also chryselephantine, so Pliny merely mentions it here. A fuller description is supplied in NH 36.18, though Pliny is very selective in what he describes even there, for his concern is simply to illustrate the fact that although Pheidias was best known for his colossal works, nevertheless his talent shone even in the smallest details of these masterpieces. Amazonēm supra dietam : For the bronze Amazon statue see Volume 1, chapter 1. Minervám tam eximiae pulchritudinis ut formae cognomen acceperit : Pheidias is reported to have made many statues of Athena. It is sometimes assumed that the outstandingly beautiful bronze statue Pliny is referring to here is the Athena Lemnia, for this work was renowned for its great beauty.2435 But Pliny does not actually name the statue, unfortunately, nor does any other text either confirm that this Athena was popularly called forma , that is 'the fair one' or 'the beautiful one', or tell us what the Greek equivalent might have been (possibly 'ca'r' , KaXXí|iopc|)oç, KaXkíorx] , or even Ouiļ). Fecit et cliduchum et aliam Minervám : Pliny now lists two more statues which he says are by Pheidias, a 'key-bearer' (kXtíôoOx0^) and, as he puts it, 'another statue of Minerva'. Sellers is of the opinion that the key-bearer was probably a votive portrait statue of a priestess, a subject also treated by Euphranor.2436 No other source mentions such a work by Pheidias. On the other hand, as is clear from Aristophanes, Thesmo. 1140f., 'key- bearer' is a title sometimes given to Athena herself, in her capacity as warden of Athens. So could this be a reference to a statue of Athena, perhaps the great bronze Athena, which was made of bronze and which is not otherwise mentioned in this passage, which is after all a list of Pheidias 's bronze works? As to the second Athena statue Pliny mentions here, which Aemilius Paullus is supposed to have transported to Rome and dedicated at the temple of the Fortune of the Day, nothing is known at all. To be mentioned in this book it must have been another bronze statue. Prokopios, De Bell V. 15.1 1, also mentions a bronze statue of Athena (toO XaXKoü Tfjç'A0T1vdç àyá'|iaToç) in the temple of Fortune at Rome, so it is probable that he and Pliny are both alluding to the same work. Linfert suggests that the statue in Rome could be the Athena Tritaia, a statue removed by the Romans before Pausanias, VII.22.6, visited the sanctuary.2437 2435 See Himerios, Or. 28.39 and 68.24; Lucian, Imag. 4 and 6; and Pausanias, 1.28.2. 2436 Sellers (1896).

Aemilius Paullus was famous for the enormous number of statues and works of art he brought back from Greece. See Livy, XLV.33, on this subject: two hundred and fifty chariots full of spoils were supposed to have added to the glory of his triumph.2438 According to Coarelli, the fact that the cognomen is set before the nomen suggests that the person in question could be one of the Aemilii of the 1st century BC who used this cognomen as a nomen.2439 The activity of the gens Aemilia in the Largo Argentina area is well attested: the temple of the Lares Permarini (the so-called temple D) was vowed by L. Aemilius Regillus during a naval battle against Antiochos III in 190 BC and dedicated by M. Aemilius Lepidus in 179 BC. These two branches of the family were related to the Aemilii Paulli.2440 Martin suggests that the use of the words ad aedem to describe the position of the Athena statue, as opposed to in aedem , which Pliny uses for the two statues in cloaks and the colossal nude mentioned just afterwards, signifies that the bronze Athena was placed in front of the temple rather than inside it.2441 In NH 34.60, Pliny mentions a large statue group by Pythagoras of Samos, which he also says was ad aedem. aedem Fortunae Huiusce Diei : The temple of the Fortune of the Day has been identified by Coarelli as the so-called temple B in the Largo Argentina complex, at the southern end of the former Campus Martius.2442 It was founded by Q. Lutatius Catulus (consul in 102 BC) in fulfilment of a vow which he made at the battle of Vercellae, against the Cimbri, in 101 BC.2443 This man was a descendant of the consul of 242 BC, C. Lutatius Catulus, the founder of the temple of Iuturna, also in this area (the so-called temple A). The temple remains show that it was a tholos and that it dates from between the late 2nd century BC and the early 1st century BC, immediately after the whole area was unified by the creation of a limestone pavement. Varro, De Re Rust. III. 5. 12, confirms that the temple was circular and Cicero, In Verr. II.IV.4, 126, says that, because it was so richly adorned with statues from Greece, it was one of the most famous temples in the city. Marble remains of the colossal acrolithic cult statue of Fortuna have been recovered. duo signa, quae Catulus in eadem aede , palliata et alterum colossicon nudum : Nothing is known about these bronze statues.

It is usually thought that the temple founder donated these statues by Pheidias. But Martin suggests that perhaps it was a later namesake, the consul of 78 BC.2444 The addition of statues might explain the reason for the enlarging of the temple, along with the enlarging of temple A, which took place in the 1st century BC. primusque artem toreuticen aperuisse atque demonstrasse merito iudicatur : The meaning of this last phrase is open to question, for it is not clear what exactly Pliny means by artem toreuticen. Toreutice clearly comes from the Greek word Topeimioļ, which seems to be related to TÓpoç, a borer, Topos, piercing, Teipw, to rub or bore, and Topeúo), to bore through or beat, all words that deal primarily with the working of metal. In her discussion of this matter, Thompson quotes Pliny, NH 35.156, Laudat et Pasitelen, qui plasticen matrem caelaturae et statuariae scalpturaeque dixit , which she translates, "(Varro) praises Pasiteles also who said that modelling is the origin of the art of metal- chasing, bronze statuary and sculpture in stone."2445 Sculptura (or scalptura) is the word Pliny uses to refer to sculpture in stone, while statuaria is the word he generally uses to mean sculpture in bronze. So, for instance, in NH 36.15 he says, Non omittendum hanc artem tanto uetustiorem fuisse quam pieturam aut s tatuariam; the arts of painting and sculpture in bronze, he says, are not as old as the art of stone sculpture which started 332 years earlier, according to his reckoning. Pliny also distinguishes between toreutice and statuaria , for these two terms sometimes appear together, obviously intended to mean two different things. For instance, in NH 35.54 he talks of statuarios et toreutas. Partly for this reason, and partly to make sense of passages such as the one in question, some have thought that toreutice must mean the art of sculpture in general. Following Kalkmann and Furtwängler, Sellers was of this opinion.2446 According to Sellers, Pliny is saying that it was the art of sculpture in general that Pheidias was judged to have opened up, and that Polykleitos was supposed to have perfected (see NH 34.56). Such an interpretation would seem to fit the use of the word toreutice in, for instance, NH 35.77, ideo ñeque in hac (pietura) ñeque in toreutice . . . where Pliny seems to be comparing in a general way the arts of painting and sculpture. There are, however, difficulties with such an interpretation. In the first place, it does not do justice to the etymology of the term, which is surely to do with metal working of some sort, rather than sculpture in any medium. See Richter for examples of the use of the term in relation to the working of small objects, such as bowls, plates, and statuettes, particularly in metals though also in other precious materials.2447 Secondly, the whole of Book 34 is about bronze and in this passage Pliny is talking about Pheidias's skill as a sculptor of bronze. Thirdly, Pliny makes it quite clear that, according to his sources, the art of bronze sculpture and the art of painting both started in the time of Pheidias, that is in the 83rd Olympiad, while the art of sculpture in stone started 332 years earlier, that is in the 1st Olympiad (see NH 36.15). It would not make sense for him to say 2444 Martin (1987) 107. 2445 Thompson (1939) 285ff. 2446 Sellers (1896) 42-43. 2447 Richter (1941) 375-83.</page><page sequence="400">LATIN SOURCES 1051 that Pheidias 'opened up' the art of sculpture in general, if he believed that the art of stone sculpture had already been going strong for 332 years before Pheidias. Following Pliny's chronology, it would make sense, on the other hand, to say that he had opened up the art of bronze sculpture. How then does one distinguish between the terms statuaria and toreutice if they both relate in some way to the art of bronze sculpture? Pollitt suggests that the term is used to refer to bronze statue making, and perhaps a particular part of the process, "the part which was executed during the assemblage of the pieces of a bronze statue and the chasing of fine details on the surface of these parts."2448 PLINY, Naturalis Historia , Book 34, section 56. hie consummasse harte seientiam iudieatur et toreutieen sic erudisse, ut Phidias aperuisse.

Ferri argues that seientiam refers to Polykleitos' theory of proportion.2450 Pollitt, on the other hand, takes it to mean bronze statue-making in general, as opposed to a part of that process which he says is toreutice ,2451 To interpret this passage, one must view it in conjunction with NH 34.54, where some of the same terms are used. hie consummasse ... ut Phidias aperuisse : As in NH 34.54, Pliny expresses the idea that Pheidias's work is not the culmination of Greek sculpture, as Cicero, for instance, or Quintilian maintain, but rather an important step in its development.2452 This view points to a different tradition concerning the development of Greek art, the so-called 'Xenokratic' tradition.2453 According to this theory, Greek sculpture continued to develop until Lysippos, in the 4th century BC, brought the art to its highest point. 2448 Pollitt (1974) 107. 2449 See Pliny, NH 34. 49, and also notes to NH 34. 53. 2450 Ferri (1940) 140-42. 2451 Pollitt (1974) 336. 2452 Cicero, Or. 2.8-9; Quintilian, Inst.

In NH 35.54 Pliny states that he was Pheidias's pupil. According to Pausanias, V.20.1-2, he made a chryselephantine table for the Heraion at Olympia, on which were placed the crowns of the victors at the games. According to Strabo, Geogr. 8.3.4 (VIII, 337C), he made a chryselephantine statue of Asklepios at Cyllene. Since he specialized in the same field as Pheidias, it is probable that he learnt from the great master and worked with him. In NH 35.54, Pliny attributes to him the Athena at Elis, another chryselephantine statue, which Pausanias, VI.26.3, attributes to Pheidias. 2454 See also Pausanias, V.10.8, and notes, and Pliny, NH 36.16-17. 2455 For a discussion of this matter, and suggestions about the type of the statue and possible copies, see Le Bonniec (1953) 244 n. 3 and Sellers (1896) 58-59.</page><page sequence="402">LATIN SOURCES 1053 PLINY, Naturalis Historia , Book 35, section 54.

On this matter the Greeks are not being accurate when they place the painters many Olympiads later than the bronze sculptors and the casters, and date the first of them in the 90th Olympiad, when tradition tells us that Phidias himself was a painter to begin with and that he painted a shield at Athens. Furthermore, it is acknowledged that his brother, Panaenus, who flourished in the 83rd Olympiad, painted the inner side of the shield of a statue of Minerva at Elis, the work of Colotes, a pupil of Phidias and the man who helped him in the making of the Olympian Zeus. Latin text : Mayhoff, C. (1897) Plinius. Naturalis Historia. Vol. V. Leipzig: Teubner. Date : Mid 1st century AD (the work was dedicated to Titus in AD 77). non constat sibi in hac parte Graecorum diligentia multas post olympiadas celebrando pictores quam statuarios etc. : According to Pliny, NH 36.15, the arts of pietura , painting, and statuaria , bronze sculpture, both started with Pheidias in the 83rd Olympiad, the date he gives, in NH 34.49, as Pheidias's floruit. Here he complains that Greek authorities place the beginning of the art of painting as late as the 90th Olympiad, thus failing to mention all known earlier artists including Pheidias himself who, he claims, started his artistic career as a painter. The Greek sources he is referring to are probably Xenokrates of Sikyon ( writing around 280 BC); Antigonos of Karystos (born around 295 BC); and Douris of Samos (born around 340 BC). Whether these sources really did fail to mention the earlier painters in their works or whether Pliny's direct source, who was probably Varro, and the intermediate writers Varro relied upon, failed to do so is not known, but the latter possibility is not implausible. Sellers suggested that the idea that there were no earlier painters may have come from the fact that later writers criticized the works of the early Hellenistic art commentators, so that eventually this mistaken notion became widespread.2456 In NH 35.60 Pliny lists the following artists as those active in the 90th Olympiad: Aglaophon, Cephisodorus, Erillus, and Euenor, father of Parrhasius. These, he says, were not as good as the first truly famous painter, namely Apollodorus of Athens who flourished in the 93rd Olympiad.2457 statuarios ac toreutas : For a discussion of these terms see NH 34.54 and notes. 2456 Sellers (1896) xxx. 2457 See note to pieturam in Pliny, NH 36.15-19.</page><page sequence="403">1054 WRITTEN SOURCES et Phidian ipsum initio pictorem fuisse tradatur clipeumque Athenis ab eo pictum : As in the case of Pythagoras of Samos (see NH 34.60), Pliny says that Pheidias started his career as a painter. He bolsters his claim with the idea that one of his painted works was a shield in Athens, and that his brother was the famous painter Panainos. The basic lack of information about Pheidias' s early training has led some people to think that the story that he was originally a painter is an anecdote thought up to fill a gap in our knowledge about the life of the great master.2458 It is certainly true that other sources are fairly vague about Pheidias' s early years and that they are not in general agreement. On the other hand, there are reasons for thinking that Pliny may be right when he says that Pheidias started out as a painter. Several sources repeat that Panainos was a close relative of Pheidias. Furthermore, although the shield Pliny mentions is not identified, it is possibly that of the Athena Parthenos. There is some evidence to suggest that the inner surface, which was adorned with a Gigantomachy, was painted. That the inner surface of a shield was sometimes painted is confirmed by Pliny's following words concerning the shield of the Athena at Elis. Concerning Pheidias's close awareness of contemporary painting see Volume 1, chapter 6.3. Panaenus : For notes about the painter Panainos, see Pliny, NH 35.57. clipeum . . .

He 2458 So Sellers (1896) lii.</page><page sequence="404">LATIN SOURCES 1055 mentions him again in NH 35.58, saying that he participated in painting competitions, the first of which took place at the Pythian Games, when he was against Timagoras of Chalcis, who beat him, and in NH 36.177, where he says that Panainos painted the walls of the temple of Athena at Elis as well as the shield of the temple image. Pausanias, V.l 1.5, says that he made paintings for the barriers in the temple of Zeus at Olympia and, in V.l 1.7, also calls him the brother of Pheidias. But Strabo, 8.3.30, says he was Pheidias's nephew. The painting referred to here, of the Battle of Marathon, was in the Stoa Poikile at Athens, in the northwest part of the Agora. It was built in around 470 BC. Pausanias, V.l 1.7, agrees that it was the work of Panainos. The date of this work suggests that Panainos was more likely to be Pheidias's brother than his nephew.2459 PLINY, Naturalis Historia , Book 36, sections 15-19.

I must not omit to mention that this art is a great deal more ancient than the art of painting or bronze sculpture, both of which started with Phidias in the 83rd Olympiad, about three hundred and thirty-two years later. It is said that Phidias himself sculpted in marble, and 2459 See Croisille (Paris 1985) 174-75, notes 1 and 2 for comments about Panainos. For a discussion of the date of Panainos, see Moreno, EAA V, 924ff.</page><page sequence="405">1056 WRITTEN SOURCES that a Venus of his is in Rome, in the Porticus of Octavia - a statue of outstanding beauty. It is an undoubted fact that he taught Aloamenes the Athenian, a first class sculptor. Many of his works are in Athens in the temples, and his famous statue of Venus, which is called 'A&lt;1)po8ÍTTi ev K Tļ Trots (Aphrodite in the Gardens), is outside the city walls. Phidias himself put the finishing touches on this work, so it is said. A pupil of the same man was Agoracritus of Paros and it is said that he was so pleasing to Phidias because of his youthfulness that Phidias let him attach his name to several of his own works. The two pupils did however come into competition in the making of a Venus, and Alcamenes won not because of his sculpture but because of the votes of his city, which favoured its own man against a foreigner. Tradition has it that for this reason Agoracritus sold his statue on the condition that it should not reside in Athens and he named it Nemesis. It was set up in an Attic deme, Rhamnous, and Marcus Varro placed it above all statues. In the sanctuary of the Great Mother, in the same city, there is another work by Agoracritus. That Phidias is the most renowned sculptor amongst all who understand the high reputation of his Olympian Jupiter, no-one doubts. But, so that even those people who have not seen his works may know that he fully deserves such praise, I shall put forward some small proofs of his particular genius. For this purpose I shall not use the beauty of his Olympian Jupiter, nor the size of his Minerva at Athens, though she is twenty-six cubits high, and all made of ivory and gold. But I shall mention Minerva's shield, on which he chased on the convex side the battle of the Amazons and on the concave side the struggles between the gods and the giants, while on the sides of her sandals was the battle of the Lapiths and the Centaurs. So true was it that for Phidias every single space afforded the opportunity for art. The relief on the base is called the Birth of Pandora: there are twenty gods .... present at the birth. The Victory is particularly wonderful, but experts also admire both the serpent and the high sphinx under the very tip of the spear. May these passing remarks about a sculptor who can never be praised fully enough help at the same time to demonstrate that this magnificent talent was just as great even in the smallest details.

Date : Mid 1st century AD (the work was dedicated to Titus in AD 77). hanc artem : The art of sculpture in marble, which Pliny calls sculptura. Pliny dates the beginning of stone sculpture 332 years earlier than the arts of painting and bronze statuary which he says started with Pheidias in the 83rd Olympiad. This puts the origins of stone sculpture neatly in the 1st Olympiad. Dipoenus and Scyllis, who flourished before the 50th Olympiad, were the first to become famous in this field, he says in NH 36.9, and he also states, in NH 36.11, that the great-grandfather of Bupalus and Athenis lived in the 1st. Olympiad. Pliny bases his calculations on the idea that a generation equals sixty years, that is a human life-time, rather than the more usual thirty-three years. See NH 34.49 and 35.54 for further notes. pieturam : The judgement that the art of painting began at the time of Pheidias goes against the Xenokratic view which was that it started later than Pheidias, in the 90th</page><page sequence="406">LATIN SOURCES 1057 Olympiad (420-417 BC), with the artist Apollodorus of Athens in the 93rd Olympiad being the first to become truly famous.2460 In NH 35.54 Pliny stresses his belief that the Greek tradition is wrong on this point, since Pheidias and Panainos were painters, and he places their floruit in the 83rd Olympiad. statuariam : The art of sculpture in bronze. The idea that Pheidias stood at the very beginning of the development of bronze statuary follows the tradition of Xenokrates, though Pliny contradicts himself at times and mentions earlier bronze artists. See NH 34.49 for notes. Phidian tradunt scalpsisse marmora : Pliny's expression here lacks the certainty of first- hand knowledge. It sounds as though Pliny himself had no direct acquaintance with any marble works by Pheidias, and the only example he can give here is of a statue which he himself had not seen and could not describe. When one considers the ancient literary sources generally, one realizes that there is little record of Pheidias's work in marble. Most of the sources talk of his chryselephantine works, in particular the Zeus at Olympia and the Athena Parthenos at Athens, and many make mention of his bronzes. This is hardly surprising considering the impressive nature of these works which gave Pheidias his undying fame. But of statues in marble, only the following are recorded: the Aphrodite Ourania in Athens (Pausanias, 1.14.7); the Hermes Pronaos in Thebes (Pausanias, IX. 10.2); the Venus, mentioned in this passage, which Pliny says was taken to Rome, and possibly the Mother of the Gods in the Athenian Metroon (Pausanias, 1.3.5, and Arrian, Peripl 9.1; note that Pliny, AW 36. 17, attributes a marble Mother of the Gods to Agorakritos). Apart from the Mother of the Gods, none of these works can be clearly identified in a second source. It seems most probable that Pheidias was involved with the sculptural decoration of the Parthenon, but the sources tend to concentrate on free-standing works of sculpture rather than reliefs or pedimental groups and those of the Parthenon hardly get a mention in the ancient sources. Plutarch, Per. 13, is the only writer who states that Pheidias was the 'episkopos' of the Parthenon project, and what this means exactly is not certain. But several ancient writers appear to refer to Pheidias specifically as a marble worker, a fact which seems to require some explanation.2461 Veneremque eius esse Romae in Octaviae operibus eximiae pulchritudinis : Nothing is known about this marble statue of Aphrodite, which Pliny claims was taken to Rome. Becatti suggested that the seated Olympias type as seen, for instance, in Torlonia 77 (Volume 3, fig. 18.1), may reflect the work but the written sources reveal nothing of the iconography of the statue, so the identification cannot be verified.2462 Strocka supports the attribution of the Olympias type to Pheidias, but he questions the usual assumption that it reflects an image of Aphrodite.2463 2460 See NH 35.60, where Pliny calls him one of the lumina artis. 2461 See Lucian, Jup. Trag., 7.9ff; Aristotle, Eth. Nic. VI. 7; Dionysios of Hal., De Din. XII.7.7. 2462 Becatti (1951) 201. 2463 Strocka (2004) 5. v. Pheidias, section on the Meter in the Athenian Metroon, 225f.</page><page sequence="407">1058 WRITTEN SOURCES The location of the Venus statue was in the Campus Martius in Rome. There was a group of buildings, with a portico surrounding the temples of Jupiter Soter and Juno Regina as the main architectural element. The portico, which was originally started in 146 BC by Q. Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, was replaced by Augustus and named the Porticus Octaviae, in recognition of his sister's help with the project. It was finished between 27 and 23 BC. In AD 80 it burnt down, was restored by Domitian, suffered another fire in AD 203, and was restored again by Septimius Severus and Caracalla. It is possible that the statue was kept in what was known as the schola , a large semi-circular exedra which was used as a museum. Alcamenes : The Athenian sculptor Alkamenes was a pupil of Pheidias, and Pausanias, IX. 1 1 .6, makes it clear that he was at work until at least the end of the 5th century BC. He seems to have worked mainly in Athens.2464 He produced works in various media, including gold and ivory, marble and bronze. See Pausanias, V.10.8 for notes concerning a possible older Alkamenes. See also Pliny, NH 34.49 and notes for other references to Alkamenes by Pliny. ' A(ļ)po0iTTļ kv KT1TT01Ç : The most famous work by Alkamenes was the 'Aphrodite in the Gardens'. Mentioned here, and also by Lucian, Imag. 6, and Pausanias, 1.19.2, this statue was clearly very popular. Its iconography and original location in Athens are not known for certain. A popular type sometimes identified with this work is that of a seated, draped figure, the so-called Olympias/Sappho type.2465 Many scholars would disagree with this identification.2466 Pliny says that the statue was outside the city walls, and this has led some to think that it was situated near the Ilissos, east of the Olympieion. Pausanias, 1.19.2, certainly mentions the Aphrodite in the Gardens of Alkamenes just after his description of the Olympieion. The statue may, however, have been in another shrine of Aphrodite in the Gardens on the north slope of the Akropolis, where there was a temple of Eros and Aphrodite.2467 Pausanias mentions this shrine also, in 1.27.4, and reveals that there was a secret passage nearby that was used by the Arrephoroi, for carrying certain sacred objects about in their ceremonies. As Travlos points out, it was not unusual to have two separate shrines for the same god in Athens. In this case they were situated close to each end of the secret underground passage talked about by Pausanias.2468 In general, see Delivorrias and Picard.2469 Without sounding very convinced himself, Pliny states that Pheidias was supposed to have put the finishing touches on the 'Aphrodite in the Gardens' 2464 See Pausanias 1.8.5; 1.20.3; and II. 30. 2; Cicero, De Nat. Deor. 1.83 for examples of sculptures made for Athenian sanctuaries. 2465 See Volume 1, chapter 18.

Although this is not impossible, it seems more likely that this is a story put about in order to add caché to a popular work. Agoracritus : Agorakritos of Paros was another pupil of Pheidias and according to several sources, his favourite.2470 For the question of the authorship of the Nemesis at Rhamnous, see Pausanias, 1.33.2 and Strabo, Geogr. 9.1.17 and notes. Certavere . . . inter se ambo discipuli Venere facienda : According to Pliny, there was rivalry between Agorakritos and Alkamenes, and discrimination against Agorakritos because he was not an Athenian citizen. Pliny's anecdote that Agorakritos changed the name of his statue to Nemesis after it failed to win the competition, might have sprung from the fact that it held an apple branch in one hand, the symbolism of which could be seen as more appropriate to a statue of Aphrodite, goddess of fertility, than to Nemesis. It is also possible that the story was an attempt to explain why the Rhamnousian Nemesis differed from the type usual later, for she was depicted without wings. M. Varro : Marcus Terentius Varro (1 16-27 BC), the great Roman scholar, seems to have been Pliny's main source for his writings on marble sculpture. est et in Matris Magnae delubro . . . Agoracriti opus : For the Mother of the Gods in the Metroon of the Agora at Athens, see Pausanias, 1.3.5 and notes. Iovis Olympii : For the Zeus at Olympia, see Volume 1, chapter 11. Minervae Athenis : For the Athena Parthenos at Athens, see Volume 1, chapter 6. in scuto eius Amazonum proelium caelavit etc. : The shield of the Athena Parthenos receives more mentions in the ancient sources than any other part of the statue. For all that, the sources do not provide us with a detailed description of its appearance, unfortunately. Much of the interest in the shield centres on two points, at least one of which may not have any basis in fact: firstly, the Amazonomachy on the outer surface of the shield was supposed to include likenesses of both Pheidias and Perikles, as Plutarch, Per. 31, mentions, and, secondly, it was said that there was a secret device that attached Pheidias 's image to the shield in such a way that if anyone tried to remove the image the whole statue would fall apart.2471 See Volume 1, Athena Parthenos, section 3, for a full discussion of the Parthenos shield. dimicationes, in soleis uero Lapitharum et Centaurorum : This is one of the very few references made in the sources to the sandals of the Athena Parthenos. See also Pollux, Onom. VII. 92. Pliny is our chief source for the information that there was a Centauromachy depicted along the sandal edges, a detail which clearly struck Pliny 2470 See Overbeck (1868) nos. 829-43; Picard Man. (1939) Vol. 2, 531-43; Lippold (1950) 187-89. 2471 See Cicero, Or. 71.234 and notes.</page><page sequence="409">1060 WRITTEN SOURCES forcibly, as an illustration of Pheidias's talent and the care he lavished on his work even in the smallest details. Considering the scale of the statue and the proximity of the goddess's feet to the onlooker, this decoration would have been more accessible to view than many other details of the work. In basi autem quod caelatum est : For the base, see also Pausanias, 1.24. 5ff. and Volume 1, Athena Parthenos, section 4. The technique of the base is not known for certain. Pliny's term caelatum est suggests metalwork, but Pliny is not consistent in his use of this verb, as one can see from NH 36.95, where he uses it to describe sculptured columns. dii sunt nascenti ....s XX numero : The Codex Bambergensis of about AD 820, which is the most reliable manuscript for this book of Pliny, reads dii sunt nascentes XX numero , which clearly does not make sense. Mayhoff suggests that something has been omitted in this phrase between nascent- and -es; he puts forward -i favent- or -i dona ferent- as possibilities. A more likely alternative, suggested by R. Ireland, is praesent-. The whole phrase would thus read dii sunt nascenti praesentes XX numero , meaning 'twenty gods are present for her birth.' Victoria . . . serpentem : For the statue of Nike on the right hand of the Athena Parthenos and for the serpent coiled up inside her shield, see Pausanias, 1.24. 5ff. and Volume 1, chapter 6.5. ac sub ipsa cuspide aeream sphingem : This surely refers to the same sphinx as the one mentioned by Pausanias in 1.24.5, which is on the top of the goddess's helmet. Ferri suggested that Pliny has here mistakenly translated the Greek word dicpov, meaning 'ó(1)oę, as cuspis instead of apex?m Apart from the fact that this explanation credits Pliny with less Greek than he probably knew, it seems unnecessary since, viewed from below, the sphinx on the helmet may well have appeared to be under the point of the spear. The word aeream has also caused difficulty. It is usually understood to mean 'made of bronze' but it is odd that the sphinx alone should be made of bronze when the rest of the statue was either ivory or gold. It is possible that the sphinx was in fact made of gilded bronze, like the shield and possibly the serpent, and it is perhaps to this fact that Pliny is alluding, even though he does not say so explicitly. The emendation auream is not based on our best manuscript, namely the Bambergensis, and therefore should not be entertained. A simpler explanation is that Pliny is using a variant spelling of the word aeriam meaning 'on high', or 'lofty'. This meaning of the word would suit the position of the sphinx very well indeed. But the rhythm that the use of this word would create in the phrase aeream sphingem at the end of the sentence, is completely out of keeping with Pliny's style. One must, therefore, accept that Pliny is here using the word aeream to mean 'made of bronze'. The resulting clausula is of a type frequently employed by Pliny. 2472 Ferri (1946) 229, n. 1.</page><page sequence="410">LATIN SOURCES 1061 PLINY, Naturalis Historia , Book 36, section 177.

Latin text : Barber, E. A. (1960) Propertii Elegiae. Oxford: Clarendon Press © Oxford University Press. Date : Probably between 25-21 BC. In this poem, Propertius writes of the riches he possesses in his gift of poetry, in the hope that this will move the heart of his mistress. In the last part of the poem, from which these lines are drawn, the poet comments on the undying fame that will come to the one the poet praises. Unlike fine buildings, which will in the end be destroyed by fire, or rain, or the passage of time, the poet's words will endure for ever unscathed. pyramidům sumptus . . . Iovis Elei . . . domus . . . Mausolei dives fortuna sepulcri : Propertius contrasts his works with three of the most famous structures in the ancient world, which he reckons will be destroyed before his poems have been forgotten. So far, he has been proved right in the last two instances. Though the pyramids still stand, the temple of Zeus at Olympia was severely damaged by fire in about AD 425 and it was finally ruined in the 6th century AD when the river Alpheios changed its course; the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was attacked by an earthquake in the 13 th century AD and then comprehensively taken apart in the late 1 5th century by the Knights of St. John, who used its stones to refortify their castle at Bodrum. The pyramids and the Mausoleum are two of the traditional items in the ancient lists of world wonders, and although the temple of Zeus at Olympia itself was not included in these lists, the temple image of Olympian Zeus, which was by Pheidias, nearly always was. Perhaps the poet has decided to make this change so that his list comprises nothing but buildings. The idea of comparing some work of art with the wonders of the world, in order to bestow the highest possible praise on it, is one which recurs frequently in ancient literature.2475 2474 For notes, see Corso (1988) 665-66. 2475 See, for instance, Cassiodorus, Var.

Phidiacus . . . luppiter : Pheidias's 'ivory' Jupiter is the chryselephantine Zeus at Olympia. In lines 9-16 of this poem, Propertius lists five different arts along with leading exponents of each type. These are as follows: 1 . Bronze sculpture, and the artists Lysippos and the earlier Kalamis 2. Painting, and the artists Apelles and the earlier Parrhasius 3. Metal engraving, and the artists Mentor and the earlier Mys 4. Chryselephantine sculpture, and the artist Pheidias 5. Marble sculpture, and the artist Praxiteles The list begins with bronze sculpture, bronze being the most popular material for statues in the Augustan period, and the leading artist in this domain is thought to be Lysippos. This follows the Xenokratic view of Greek art. Xenokrates considered that the high point in its development was reached in the 4th century BC, rather than in the 5th century BC with the art of Pheidias, as so many other art critics thought.2476 The Xenokratic view is later found echoed in the work of Pliny (see, for instance, NH 34.56), and it differs markedly from the position of, for instance, Cicero or Quintilian.2477 This passage is discussed by Corso.2478 QUINTILIAN, Institutio Oratoria , II.3.6. . . . nisi forte louem quidem Phidias optime fecit, ilia autem quae in ornamentům operis eius accedunt alius melius elaborasset . . . . . . unless indeed Pheidias happened to make Jupiter very brilliantly, but another and better artist elaborated those parts which are added to the decoration of his work . . .

Compare Pliny, NH 36.18, above, for the fascination people had for Pheidias 's great skill in creating works of monumental size which nevertheless exhibited a wealth of intricate and detailed decoration on a small scale.

Precision of detail and grace are found above all in the works of Polyclitus, who is considered the greatest of sculptors by most people though, so as not to make him faultless, they do think that his work lacks dignity. For while he lent ideal grace to the human form, it is thought that he did not fully express the authority of the gods . . . But what was lacking in Polyclitus, is given to Phidias and Alcamenes. Latin text : Winterbottom, M. (1970) Quintiliani Institutio Oratoria. Oxford: Clarendon Press © Oxford University Press. Date : Between AD 93-96. Quintilian here compares the development of rhetorical criticism with the development of Greek art. This is an idea that finds expression in the writings of many orators, and they share the view that the apogee of Greek sculpture was reached in the mid 5th century BC, particularly in the works of Pheidias. For a discussion of this matter, and the so-called 'phantasia' theory of Greek art, see Cicero, Or. 2.8-9 and notes. diligentia ac decor . . . pondus : These words all belong to the technical vocabulary of art criticism. Polliti translates diligentia as 'precision of detail' and decor as 'appropriateness in the art', the equivalent of the Greek term, tò ttpéttov.2479 He comments, "Quintilian's attribution of decor supra verum to the art of Polyclitus . . . probably meant that the outward harmony of Polyclitan figures was felt to convey the higher nature of the human 2479 See Pollitt (1974) 343ff.</page><page sequence="414">LATIN SOURCES 1065 iļjuxT1 "2480 Pondus is the quality that Polykleitos' art lacked, according to Quintilian, and that was to be found chiefly in the art of Pheidias, who succeeded in rendering the gods in a way that Polykleitos failed to do. The term seems to imply weightiness or importance, in a metaphorical sense, such as it is often used by Cicero.2481 Pollitt compares this passage of Quintilian with Strabo, Geogr. 8.6.10, and suggests that perhaps the concepts of pondus and maiestas together would express the Greek term [iéy€0oç.2482 The works of Polykleitos and Pheidias, the two great names of the mid 5th century BC, are compared and Quintilian' s general conclusion is that while Polykleitos excelled in the portrayal of the human figure, Pheidias was the undoubted master when it came to representing gods, especially in the chryselephantine technique. Polykleitos's most famous work was undoubtedly the Doryphoros, a bronze nude that exemplified his canon of proportions for the human male figure. He did, however, produce at least one chryselephantine deity: the Hera at Argos which was greatly admired in antiquity.2483 The ancient sources record that Pheidias produced statues of gods in the main, though he too created some human figures.2484 QUINTILIAN, Institutio Oratoria , XII. 10.9. O: 721.

Phidias, however, is believed to have been a better sculptor of gods than of men and indeed, in ivory, to have been far superior to any rival - this would be thought even if he had produced nothing apart from the Minerva at Athens or the Olympian Jupiter at Elis, whose beauty seems to have added something even to received religion, so exactly does the majesty of the work measure up to the god.

According to Quintilian, Pheidias's statues were so inspired that they helped to express and even to develop popular religious beliefs in a way that no other sculptures were ever able to do. This is a view that is echoed in the writings of other rhetoricians and which forms part of the so-called 'phantasia' theory of Greek art.2485 Mineruam Athenis : The chryselephantine Athena Parthenos, described by Pausanias in 1.24. 5ff. and Pliny in NH 36.18.

All these works secured Pheidias's reputation among the top Greek artists. pulchritudo: An essential quality of the gods, and one which Pheidias succeeded in portraying better than any other artist, in the view of Quintilian and other proponents of the 'phantasia' theory. The term is often used in connection with the art of Pheidias.2486 maiestas : According to Schweitzer, this term translates the Greek [léyeQos , and means the greatness of the gods.2487 It is one of the essential Latin terms associated with the 'phantasia' theory of Greek art.2488 SENECA PHILOSOPHUS (Younger), De Beneficiis , 2.33.2. facit Phidias statuam; alius est fructus artis, alius artificii : artis est fecisse, quod uoluit, artificii fecisse cum fructu; perfecit opus suum Phidias, etiam si non uendidit. triplex illi fructus est operis sui: unus conscientiae; hunc absoluto opere percipit; alter famae; tertius utilitatis, quern adlatura est aut gratia aut uenditio aut aliqua commoditas.

Phidias : Pheidias is used by Seneca as an example of a well-known master craftsman, with whom he can compare his ideal wise man in order to elucidate the nature of the wise man. The subject of Seneca's treatise is doing good. He explains that, like Pheidias's creative work, a good action brings several rewards to the person who carries it out. SENECA PHILOSOPHUS (Younger), Epistulae Morales adLucilium , 9.5. sine amico quidem numquam erit : in sua potestate habet quam cito reparei . quomodo si perdiderit Phidias statuam protinus alteram faciei, sic hic faciendarum amicitiarum artifex substituet alium in locum amissi. Indeed, he will never be without a friend: he can find another as quickly as he wants. If Phidias loses a statue, he will make another one immediately, and, in the same way, the wise man - master craftsman in the art of making friends - will substitute another in the place of the friend he has lost. Latin text : Reynolds, L. D. (1965) Senecae Epistulae. Oxford: Clarendon Press © Oxford University Press. Date : Written at some time between AD 62-65. Phidias : As in De Ben. 2.33.2, the wise man is portrayed as a master craftsman in the art of living and in this capacity Seneca compares him with Pheidias, the most renowned of all craftsmen. According to Seneca, individual sculptures are as replaceable by Pheidias as friends are by the wise man. Presumably he means this in the sense that it is not so much the finished sculpture that is of importance to Pheidias, in his role as sculptor, as the making of the sculpture. SENECA PHILOSOPHUS (Younger), Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium, , 85.40. O: 784. non ex ebore tantum Phidias sciebat facere simulacra; faciebat ex aere, si marmor illi, si adhuc viliorem materiam obtulisses, fecisset quale ex ilia fieri optimum posset.</page><page sequence="417">1068 WRITTEN SOURCES Phidias knew how to make statues not only out of ivory, he made them out of bronze. If you had obtained marble for him or even some baser material, he would have made the most beautiful work he could out of it. Latin text : Reynolds, L. D. (1965) Senecae Epistulae. Oxford: Clarendon Press © Oxford University Press. Date : Written at some time between AD 62-65. Seneca's subject in this epistle is the idea that suffering and poverty cannot stand in the way of the wise man, who will succeed whatever the circumstances. As an example he mentions Pheidias, the greatest of Greek sculptors, who produced masterpieces in the richest materials, such as ivory, but succeeded just as well in lesser materials, such as bronze, and could even have turned a cheaper material into a great work of art. When he speaks of ivory, Seneca is clearly referring to Pheidias 's great chryselephantine statues, notably the Zeus at Olympia and the Athena Parthenos. Several works in bronze are attributed to Pheidias in the sources, notably the great bronze Athena, an Amazon at Ephesos, an Apollo Parnopios, a large group at Delphi, commemorating Marathon, and a number of others, if Pliny is to be trusted.2489 Seneca leaves open the question of whether or not Pheidias worked in stone, a subject on which the sources say little.2490 SENECA RHETOR (Elder), Controversias , Book VIIL2, (Müller, 361-362).

How Phidias lost his hands. The sacrilegious shall have their hands cut off. The Elians welcomed Phidias from the Athenians so that he could make a statue of Olympian Jupiter for them, on the condition that either they returned Phidias or one hundred talents. When the Jupiter was completed, the Elians said that Phidias had stolen gold and they cut off his hands for sacrilege and gave him back to the Athenians thus mutilated. The Athenians are asking for their one hundred talents. The Elians are disputing the matter. (For the Athenians) Now we cannot lend Phidias. The majesty of Jupiter can be expressed only when the soul has seen the work, and the hand has shaped it. Phidias made the Jupiter for himself before he made the statue. You are the sacrilegious ones, who cut off those sacred hands. The first blood seen by the god was that of his craftsman. As a witness, I call on Jupiter, now Phidias' own god. Art sustains others in their misery, but you it has made most miserable of all. It was his hands which made Phidias worth contracting out. Do you think we are about to take Phidias back without the very asset but for which you would not have taken him on? We lent you someone who was able to make gods, we have taken back a man who cannot even worship them. Are you not ashamed to owe your statue of Jupiter to someone guilty of sacrilege? The man exists still, but the artist has perished. You are giving back to us the punishment meted out to Phidias rather than giving us Phidias. The hands which used to make gods are now not even able beg from men. The Jupiter he made was of such fine quality that the Elians wanted this work to be his last. We lent you his hands; it is his hands we ask you to return. The witness is an Elian, the accuser is an Elian, the judge is an Elian; the defendant alone is from Athens. I call on the gods, both those that Phidias made and those he was capable of making. We have received Phidias: I admit this, if we can lend him out. (The other side) We had gold that was once sacred, we had ivory; we sought a craftsman to fashion this holy material. Indeed we had intended that Phidias should make images for other temples also, but it was not as important to adorn the gods as to avenge them. Latin text : Winterbottom, M. (1974) Seneca . Vol. II.

Seneca died some time between AD 37 and 41.</page><page sequence="419">1070 WRITTEN SOURCES Phidias Amissis Manibus : This is the fictional subject of the declamation. Little is known about what ultimately happened to Pheidias. The main sources regarding Pheidias's end are Plutarch, Per. 31-32 and Aristophanes, Pax 603ff. Sacrilego manus praecidantur : The stated law under discussion. This too is a fiction, for neither in Italy nor in Greece were the sacrilegious punished in this way. perfecto love Elii Phidian aurum rapuisse : The idea that the Eleians accused Pheidias of stealing gold sounds like a made-up story, for the sake of argument, based on the fact that the Athenians accused Pheidias of embezzlement after he had completed the Athena Parthenos. Compare Anonymus Seguerianus, Ars Rhetorica , 216. See also Dio Chrysostomus, Or. XII.49-50, who imagines the Eleians asking Pheidias to justify not the accounts for the statue but the form he gave to his Zeus. The second scholiast to Aristophanes, Pax 605-06 takes up the rather dubious idea that Pheidias was punished by the Eleians after he had finished the Zeus for them. There is no evidence to support such a claim. pars altera : The Eleians. disposueramus quidem, ut aliis quoque templis simulacra Phidias faceret : In fact, Pheidias made at least one other statue for the Eleians: a chryselephantine Aphrodite Ourania, mentioned by Pausanias in VI.25.1. Pausanias, VI. 26. 3, also attributes to Pheidias the chryselephantine statue of Athena at Elis, but this was perhaps the work of his pupil Kolotes, as Pliny, NH 35.54, says. SENECA RHETOR (Elder), Contr over siae, Book X.5.8, (Müller, 496). O: 718. non vidit Phidias lovem , fecit tarnen velut tonantem; nec stetit ante oculos eius Minerva, dignus tamen ilia arte animus et concepii deos et exhibuit. Phidias did not see Jupiter, however he made him as if he was thundering; nor did Minerva stand before his eyes, but his soul, that was worthy of such art, both imagined the gods and displayed them. Latin text : Winterbottom, M. (1974) Seneca. Vol. II. Loeb Classical Library. London: W. Heinemann and Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. Date : Not earlier than AD 37. Seneca died some time between AD 37 and 41. Iovem : The Zeus at Olympia by Pheidias. fecit tamen velut tonantem : Pausanias's description, V.l 1.1-10, and the evidence provided by coins agree that the Zeus of Pheidias held a Nike in his right hand and a sceptre with an</page><page sequence="420">LATIN SOURCES 1071 eagle perched on the top in his left hand. Seneca seems to suggest here that the Zeus was holding a thunderbolt, a mistake that is repeated by Lucian.2491 Minerva : Seneca is probably alluding to Pheidias's other most famous work, namely the Athena Parthenos. et concepii deos et exhibuit : Pheidias's great skill, according to many, was his ability to imagine the divine nature of the gods, using his imagination and intuition, and to transmit this to others through his art.2492 SENECA RHETOR (Elder), Contr over siae, Book X.5.1 1, (Müller, 497). Phidias omnia opera sine tortore fecit. Phidias did all his work without using a torturer. Latin text : Winterbottom, M. (1974) Seneca. Vol. II. Loeb Classical Library. London: W. Heinemann and Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. Date : Not earlier than AD 37. Seneca died some time between AD 37 and 41. sine tortore : The matter under discussion in this controversy concerns the famous Athenian artist, Parrhasios, and his painting of Prometheus. According to the story, when Philip was selling the people of Olynthia as slaves, Parrhasios bought one of the old men. He subjected this man to torture and then used him as a model for his painting of the suffering of Prometheus. Parrhasios gave his painting as an offering in the temple of Athena. The question is the following: was this painting an acceptable gift to the goddess and, furthermore, how justified was Parrhasios to act in the way he did? As pointed out in the comment on X.5.8 above, Pheidias did not see Jupiter before he made his brilliant statue at Olympia. And, as stated here, he never resorted to torture. Pheidias was renowned for the power of his imagination.

After which, your cups and a couch in the midst of your Muses kept us busy: statues and images, in bronze or marble and colours, of a quality which Mentor, Praxiteles, and Scopas never produced and of a size which neither Polyclitus himself fashioned, nor Phidias with his engraving tool. Latin text : Anderson, W. B. (1936) Poems and Letters. Sidonius. Loeb Classical Library. London: W. Heinemann &amp; Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. Date : No. XXIII was written to Consentius of Narbonne, probably between AD 462 and 466, the most likely date being AD 463. post quas : That is, after a visit to the private baths attached to the villa. Sidonius is describing his recent visit to the house of his friend Consentius at Narbona. He describes the baths, and then, in this passage, the triclinium where, amid works of art, Sidonius listened to his friend's poetical compositions {tuarum Musarum). Mentor, Praxiteles , Scopas : Sidonius compares the quality of works of art to be found in his friend's house with those of artists of the late Classical era, judging the former to be superior. It is probable that his view that the late Classical period saw the highest point in the development of Greek art springs from his reading of Latin authors of the Flavian period, such as Pliny for instance, who were influenced in their judgement by Hellenistic writers such as Xenokrates. In NH 33.154, for instance, Pliny states that Mentor was the best toreutic artist; in NH 36.20, he says that Praxiteles was the best marble sculptor; and in NH 36.25, he says that Skopas was on a par with Praxiteles. Sidonius's acquaintance with Greek art would seem to be drawn not from first hand experience but from his reading of the Latin literary tradition. The grouping of Praxiteles and Skopas is to be found, for instance, in Martial, Epigr. IV.39.3 and Priapea , poem 10, line 2. Mentor is often mentioned as the best Greek toreutic artist. See, for instance, Juvenal, Sat. 8.104; Martial, Epigr. 4.39.5. statuas imaginesque : Sidonius talks about statues in bronze and images in marbles and colours; the latter presumably includes both marble sculptures, in the round and in relief, and paintings. This classification of works of art according to material probably stems from Pliny, NH Books 34-36, where the same system is used. The plural marmoribus is appropriate since at least two different types of marble are regularly mentioned in the Latin literary tradition, Pentelic and Parian. The word coloribus is appropriate for the paintings, but also for the marble sculptures which would have been painted in part, for instance on the drapery, eyes, hair, sandals and attributes. Polycletus . . . Phidiaco . . . caelo : Polykleitos and Pheidias are mentioned by Sidonius because of the size of their works. Both these artists, though more particularly Pheidias, were famed for colossal statues. The phrase Phidiaco . . . caelo is probably taken from Martial. See Epigr. III.35.1; X.87.16.</page><page sequence="422">LATIN SOURCES 1073 SIDONIUS APOLLINARIS, Epistulae , VII.3.1. hac enim fronte possemus fluminibus aquas, silvis ligna transmitiere; hac &lt;enim&gt; temeritate Apellen peniculo , caelo Phidian, malleo Polyclitum muneraremur.

The Amphiareion was not at Rhamnous, as Soliņus says, but a little to the north in a place called Psaphis. Phidiacae signum Dianae : The famous statue at Rhamnous was not of Diana but of Nemesis, and it was most probably a work of Agorakritos rather than of his master Phidias.

Statius is the first poet to give lengthy descriptions of villas. ueteres : The age of Pollius's pieces would add prestige to his collection. It is highly doubtful that he possessed any originals, but he may well have had copies of ancient masterpieces for these were very popular and easy to obtain.2493 cerae : Encaustic painting. Pheidias : Pheidias is mentioned along with Myron and Polykleitos. These artists often appear listed together, to represent the flower of the high Classical period in Greek sculpture. Compare Tzetzes, Ep. 42, and Juvenal, Sat. 8, 102-04. uacua tarnen admirabile Pisa : The name Pisa was often used as a variant for Olympia.2494 Pheidias' s great work at Olympia was the chryselephantine Zeus, so the works in Pollius's collection by Pheidias date from before the Zeus, according to Statius. The tamen is to be taken with admirabile , the implication being that even though these works were not Pheidias 's masterpieces, they were nevertheless excellent works in their own right. The Zeus at Olympia was made during the 430s BC. It may have been one of his last works. It is not clear which works Statius is referring to here. Van Dam suggests miniatures by the master, on the grounds that one of Statius 's themes is the idea that artists often worked on small projects before they turned their hands to major pieces.2495 This idea can be found in relation to poets in, for instance, 1.3.50-1 and IV.6.44. There is no good evidence for miniatures by Pheidias, however. rasere : From radere , to rub smooth, to file. Statius uses the same word again at IV.6.27. Van Dam makes the useful comment that the verb is often used metaphorically to describe a piece of writing as 'highly polished' and he quotes Ovid, Ex Ponto II.4.17; Martial, Epigr . 4.10.1; and Quintilian, Inst. Or. IX.4.17.2496 With this in mind, Statius is deliberately adding strength to his praise of Pheidias.

Latin text : Courtney, E. (1990) Statii Silvae. Oxford: Clarendon Press © Oxford University Press. Date : Published between AD 92-95. This poem is addressed to Novius Vindex, a poet and an art connoisseur, after a dinner- party at which he showed the guests a statuette of Hercules he had. The same subject is treated by Martial in poems 9.43 and 44. The statuette in question is thought to be a reduced copy of a work by Lysippos, perhaps recognized in the so-called Alba Fucens type, after its place of discovery (where it was excavated in I960).2497 Vindex was no doubt a very wealthy man and his collection may have been one of the most important in this period. hie tibi . . . monstrabit : Just before this passage (line 24), Statius tells us that Vindex was able to recognize the works of masters even without a signature. In Classical times, works were signed on the base of the statue, if at all. ebur Pisaeo pollice rasum : Pisa is used synonymously with Olympia.2498 The most famous ivory fashioned at Olympia was the chryselephantine Zeus of Pheidias, of course. Using this expressive phrase Statius underlines how famous Pheidias was, for he does not even need to name the artist directly. For the use of the word rasum see note in Statius, Silvae, II. 2. 63-67. Myron , Praxiteles , Polyclitus , Apelles : As so often, Myron, Polykleitos and Praxiteles are all included in the canon of Greek artists, and, as in the case of Pheidias, the material in which they produced their greatest masterpieces is specified: Myron and Polykleitos both distinguished themselves with their bronzes, while Praxiteles was famous for his marble sculptures. Apelles was a 4th century painter, one of the most renowned in antiquity, and the only one Statius ever mentions. Compare Silv. II.2.63- 67, where the same artists are listed, with the exception of Praxiteles. 2497 See Coleman (1988) 173. Cf.

Date : Probably 4th century AD, following the 1st century AD work of Valerius Maximus. iidem Phidiam tulerunt : An amusing anecdote about discussions on the choice of material for the Athena Parthenos, the artist supposedly favouring the cheaper but more durable option of marble. It was not so much the ivory that cost a fortune, but the gold - to the tune of some forty-four talents of State treasury money. According to this story, the people might have been persuaded to go for marble on the grounds that it would make the monument last longer, but the thought of it being cheaper was not attractive. Part of the statement proclaimed by the Parthenos concerned the self image of the Athenians, as rich and powerful people.</page><page sequence="429">1080 WRITTEN SOURCES VALERIUS MAXIMUS, Factorum ac Dictorum Memorabilium , III. 7. ext. 4.

For when the statue of Jupiter (and human art has manufactured nothing more excellent or more admirable than this) was completed, he was asked by a friend to what model he had turned his mind to capture, in ivory lines, the face of Jupiter, which seemed to have been sought in heaven itself.

However insignificant his works, Fabius Pictor signed them because he did not want to be forgotten by posterity. clipeo Mineruae effigiem suam inclusit : Valerius likens Fabius Pictor to Pheidias for, he says, Pheidias included a self-portrait on the shield of the Athena Parthenos. It seems probable that Valerius is here thinking of the passage in Cicero, Tusc. Disp. 1.15.34, or another source common to him and Cicero, saying that there was a likeness of Pheidias on the Parthenos shield. Valerius goes one step further than Cicero, however, for while Cicero talks of a likeness of Pheidias on the shield, sui similem speciem , Valerius talks of a portrait of the artist. Later versions of the story all follow Valerius's lead.2500 Two other sources, Plutarch, Per. 31, and Dio Chrysostomos, Or. XII.6, which probably derive from a common source, tell of two portraits on the shield, one of Pheidias and one of Perikles. qua conuulsa tota operis conligatio solveretur : Although Valerius mentioned the portrait of Pheidias in terms of the artist's signature, as Cicero did, in Tusc. Disp. 1.15.34, he then brings in another idea which is not found in Cicero but which is eagerly taken up by later writers, namely that the portrait of Pheidias was some sort of mechanism capable of destroying the shield if it was ever removed.2501 As the story grows, so the details are subtly changed. In the end it was said that the destruction mechanism was placed in the middle of the shield and that it was capable of destroying not just the shield but the entire statue. It is possible that the tale may be traced back to a misinterpretation of Cicero, Or. 71.234, and that it is no more than a fanciful elaboration of what Cicero said in that passage. Valerius's words tota operis conligatio may perhaps echo Cicero's collocationis universam speciem. Perhaps there was another source, common to Cicero and Valerius, but probably no earlier than the 3rd century BC.2502 VIBIUS SEQUESTER, Septem Mira Orbis . O: 734.

But we can observe this best from the example of ancient sculptors and painters because, of these, the ones who gained recognition of their worth and the benefit of recommendations remain alive for posterity, the memory of them is eternal: so, for instance, Myron, Polycletus, Phidias, Lysippus and the rest of those who acquired renown through their art.

It follows the Xenokratic tradition, as transmitted by Antigonos and Varro, but it is odd in that it does not include Pythagoras of Rhegion or Praxiteles. The order in which the names are cited is chronological, if one takes it that Polykleitos and Pheidias represent the high Classical period, though Polykleitos was in fact a slightly younger contemporary and continued to work some time after Pheidias. But it is possible that the sculptors' subjects determine the order of their names, thus pointing to rhetorical influences in this passage. The rhetoricians were fond of opposing sculptors of humans to sculptors of gods. So here one finds Myron, famous for his sculptures of animals, followed by Polykleitos, most renowned for his sculptures of humans, followed by Pheidias and Lysippos who both made great statues of gods.

Following Ferguson and Meritt's cycle of treasurers (see no. 457 above), this would date the inscription to 440/439 BC. The accounts: One hundred talents were received from the treasurers, and with this were bought gold and ivory. Luckily, both the weight of the gold and its cost are preserved, and from this one can see that 1 drachma of gold equalled about 14 drachmai of silver, as Dinsmoor calculated for the year 434/433 BC.2515 The quantity of ivory purchased is, unfortunately, not preserved, so the price of the ivory is unknown. IG I3 449, lines 392-94, from the building accounts of the Parthenon, preserves the information that a weight of 3 talents 60 drachmai of ivory was sold for 1,305 drachmai and 4 obols in the year 434/433 BC.

This must represent all or most of the total amount of credit given to the overseers for the execution of the chryselephantine statue. Not everyone agrees with Dinsmoor's restoration of the sum, which must have been more than 700 talents and less than 1000 talents. Lines 6-9: The mention of an individual's name here (the father of Kritias?) in conjunction with a sum of gold and the word dveGeicev suggests an offering by a rich individual. It is listed before the expenses and immediately after the very large credit sum, so it is likely to represent a sum added to the original credit as part of the total credit available. With this idea, Donnay restores [Trpoaeyév]-eTO at the end of line 6.2518 Lines 10-12: Now come the expenses, and it appears that the first figures, which are extremely large, represented the total expenditure, while later on a breakdown of the figures was given. The cost of the work was likely to be close to the total credit available. Some idea of the cost can be gleaned from the literary sources, which confirm that it was, at minimum, over 600 silver talents, for the gold revetment alone was of the order of 616 silver talents. Philochoros, in the scholia to Aristophanes, Pax , 605f., says that the statue cost 44 gold talents (that is, exactly 616 silver talents, if the gold to silver ratio was indeed 1: 14). Plutarch, De Vit . Aer. 2, says it cost 40 talents, while Diodorus Siculus, XII.40.3, made it fifty talents. Donnay restores the numbers as follows: [PlHIHHrXXXXHHlIFAA. This would make the total come to 805 talents, 4,270 drachmai. Lines 13-14: The sum involved in this section is quite modest, being something between 770 and 800 drachmai. This suggests that the word aTT€pyaaia refers to the 'execution' of a part of the whole project, something which could be valued separately from the whole and which did not involve particularly expensive materials. Donnay suggests that this refers to the making of the statue base, made of marble and limestone and he restores the text thus: aTTepya[aia tô ßaGpo].2519 Lines 15-17: The cost here is substantially higher than in the previous section, being at least 30 talents 300 drachmai and possibly as much as nearly 50 talents. The meaning of the term KaTcißX6|ia is not clear, though its basic meaning is 'something put down' possibly as a foundation. Could this be a reference to the wooden armature inside the statue? This would have involved a delicate and time-consuming carpentry job, and the materials needed would have been fairly costly, if, like the Zeus at Olympia, the Athena 2518 Donnay (1967) 74. 2519 Donnay (1967) 80-81.</page><page sequence="445">INSCRIPTIONS 1097 Parthenos was given an inner framework made of enduring woods such as cypress and citron wood.2520 Lines 18-19: Fragments of the last two extant lines, mentioning gold and the statue, perhaps refer to the gold revetment and the delicate job of attaching it to the figure.

Reasons for supporting this view can be summarized as follows: 1 . The accounts detail the expenditure of large sums of money primarily on copper, tin and wages for the workforce. Estimates of the weight and cost of the work involved, which are discussed below, point to a colossal work such as the Athena 'Promachos.' 2. The date of the inscription points to a dedication made a little before 450 BC, a date which would well suit the 'Promachos'. 3. Five of the inscription fragments were found on the Akropolis, two in the Agora. The provenance of the other four fragments is not known. An Akropolis dedication could be indicated by these finds. 4. The information provided in the inscription points to an officially supervised work financed by State funds, with the accounts open to public inspection on completion. This too would suit a dedication such as the Athena 'Promachos.' 5. The accounts in question cover a nine year period, and it seems likely that Pheidias's great statue was smaller than both the Colossus of Rhodes, which took twelve years to build, and the Mercury of Zenodorus which took ten years to build, both mentioned by Pliny, in NH 34.41 and 44, but bigger than the statues by Alkamenes for the Hephaisteion, which took at least five years to build. It is sometimes argued that the mention of the purchase of copper and tin almost until the end of the project suggests that more than one statue was being made, and that these accounts concern a statue group. But if one looks at the preserved figures, it immediately becomes clear that the weight of copper and tin acquired in year 6 (lines 69-71) and year 8 (lines 101-04) is significantly less than that acquired in year 2/3 (lines 10-12). An explanation for this might be that the main body of the statue was made in year 2/3, while later years saw the production of the smaller, attached pieces, the piecing together of the parts of the statue, and the making good of the joins. Therefore, the buying of metals until almost the end of the project is not inconsistent with the idea that these accounts deal with one large statue. The stele almost certainly consisted of three double columns. Columns II and III each contain the accounts for three years, therefore the statue must have taken nine years to complete. The document can be divided into annual parts as follows: Year 1 or 2 : lines 1-2 Year 2 or 3: lines 4-23 Year 4: lines 24-35 Year 5: lines 36-62 Year 6: lines 63-85 Year 7: lines 86-93 Year 8: lines 94-1 18 Year 9: lines 120-24. The epigraphical evidence reveals that the accounts were written around 450 BC. The fact that there is no change in the character of the stoichedon writing throughout the document and that the inscription is symmetrically spaced on the stone seems to confirm that thé whole document was cut by one hand at the conclusion of the work on the statue, giving a summary of the yearly records that had been kept by the overseers. The statue can therefore be dated with some confidence in the years around 460^50 BC. The following problems regarding the stele are as yet unresolved: 1 . There are no remains of the top margin.</page><page sequence="454">1 1 06 WRITTEN SOURCES 2. There is no firm proof for placing fragment Z in Col. I rather than in Col. III. 3. On the right side of fragment A there is unexplained anathyrosis.

Secretary of the overseers : The secretary's name and demotic was always given in the accounts, the demotic filling the space between the words éypa|i[i(ÍTeue and êuiaTaTai in the second line. None of the demotics is preserved, but it may be possible to restore ' A[xapvei3]s for Kallistratos (Col.

The epistatai : These people, officially in charge of supervising the work and ensuring that money provided for it was well spent, are always mentioned in the plural but, as in the case of the Parthenos, Parthenon building, and Hephaisteion temple statues accounts, their names and number are never given. Raubitschek argued for five overseers, of whom one was the secretary.

They will be in charge of the funds of the two goddesses in the same way as the supervisors of the works in the city were in charge of the temple and the statue. (Greek text: Lewis, D. (1981) Inscriptiones Graecae , Vol. 1 (3rd. edition), fascicule 1, no. 435. Berlin: W. de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co.) This inscription deals with the institution of a board of overseers whose function was to administer the funds of the two goddesses 'in the same way as the overseers of the Akropolis were in charge of the temple and the statue.' This inscription is usually dated to before 448/447 BC, so the statue in question is thought to be the Athena 'Promachos.' The administrators at Eleusis were five in number, including their secretary. They each received 4 obols a day. Mattingly, however, is in favour of down-dating this inscription to 432/431 BC and in identifying the temple and statue here mentioned with the Parthenon and the Parthenos.2523 3. The kolakretai : These were official Athenian financial officers, who entrusted state money to the overseers to pay for the project. The money came from the spoils of battles fought against the Persians, perhaps the battle of Marathon.2524 IG I3 505, doubtfully identified by some as the base of the statue, does not specifically mention Marathon. The restored reading simply says e'c tûv MeôiKwv. Materials used : The materials used in the project seem to corroborate the theory that these are indeed the accounts of the great bronze Athena of Pheidias, the only known colossal bronze statue to be made on the Akropolis at the time in question. (1) Copper and tin. The main items purchased were copper and tin. These were mixed together to make the bronze alloy used for the statue.2525 They were bought in varying quantities, over a number of years, even as late as the eighth year of the project. During the 450s BC, the price of tin fluctuated but the average cost would have been about 232dr. 2ob. per talent. In year 8 (lines 101-06) there are fragmentary remains of the cost of purchases of copper and tin, and from these Raubitschek calculated that two talents of tin cost 466 dr.2526 He restored lines 103-04 as follows: HHfHHF1] [KajTTiTĆpo : T[aXávTa T T] AHM [Tl[l]è TOUTO* Copper would have cost much less than tin in this period, probably about 35 dr. per talent. IG I3 472, lines 139-41 confirms that it cost 35 dr. per talent (that is 3.5 ob. per mina) in 2523 Mattingly (1961) 171-73. 2524 See Pausanias, 1.28.2. 2525 Formigli (1984) 120 states that, although traces of lead may be found in the alloys of large-scale bronze statues of the Archaic and Classical periods, lead was not used intentionally in bronze alloys until the 4th century BC in Greece. Mattusch (1996) 137, on the other hand, asks whether lead was a standard component of statuary bronzes, even in small quantities, since it is found in a number of surviving works. The Riace bronzes have a lead content of less than 0.2% in most parts, according to Formigli (1984) 121-26, while the Piraeus Apollo, dating to c. 530-520 BC, has a lead content of 1%, according to Mattusch, like the mid-4th century BC Piraeus Athena and larger Artemis. For a table giving the percentages of copper, tin and lead in ancient bronzes, see Haynes (1992) 87. 2526 Raubitschek (1943) 12-17.</page><page sequence="456">1 1 08 WRITTEN SOURCES around 420 BC, and, as Donnay points out, since in line 90 of this document the last two figures equal exactly 3.5 ob. times 2, this suggests that the price of copper was the same in the 450s BC as it was in the 420s BC.2527 In one of the early years of the project, year 2/3, the total annual budget was 78,1 lOdr., and out of this sum 34,852dr. were spent on the purchase of one metal, and at least 6,350dr. were spent on the purchase of the other (see lines 10-13). In year 6, 14 Euboian talents in weight of one metal were bought, an expenditure of about 490 dr., and at least 7 (but less than 10) talents of the other, an expenditure of about 1,631 dr. (see lines 69-72). In year 8, the sum spent on copper was about 1,101 dr. 1 ob. (and not more than 1,400 dr.), while the sum spent on tin was about 215 dr. (and less than 500 dr.). It seems that towards the end of the project, the amount of money spent on copper and tin, and other materials for that matter, dropped off considerably, as one would expect. Instead, more money was spent on wages, presumably in an attempt to get the great statue completed. It is not known what the proportion of tin to copper was in the alloy. According to Formigli, analyses of large-scale bronzes dating from before the 4th century BC, including the Riace bronzes, reveal that the usual tin content was between 9-1 2%.2528 The fact that the metals were bought separately is in itself an interesting point, for it shows that the alloy was made by the artists of the statue, rather than bought ready made.2529 In year 8, the purchase of copper is listed before the purchase of tin in the accounts. Therefore, it is generally believed that the same order can be expected in year 2/3, where the figures alone have survived. If this is true, then the figures in year 2/3 indicate the purchase of about 996 talents in weight of copper in one year alone. Since the figures for many of the years are missing, the true weight of copper might have been substantially higher. Considering that the Colossus of Rhodes weighed 500 talents and was about 30 metres high, according to Philon of Byzantium, VII spect. 4, this total seems impossibly large, even if one assumes that the 5th century BC statue had thicker walls. Donnay therefore suggested that the figure 34,852 dr. in lines 10-11 refers to an amount paid for tin rather than copper, while the figure 6,350 dr. in line 12 refers to the copper.2530 If this is the case then it would mean the purchase in year 2/3 of 181 talents in weight of copper and about 150 talents of tin. (2) Silver. Silver is mentioned in years 5 and 6 (see lines 56-57 and 79-80) and it was used, apparently, to 'decorate' the statue. If one thinks of the Delphi Charioteer, for instance, which has several details made in silver, such as the teeth, then one can imagine that the great bronze Athena too might have been finished in a similar way, with the colour of silver being used to contrast with the bronze to pick out details of the composition. If this is correct, then it would be reasonable to expect that the amount of silver used was not enormous and that silver was not required until the statue was well under way. Unfortunately, the amount of money spent on silver in any one year is never fully preserved. In year 6 the amount is partially preserved, hence it is known that more than 281 dr. 2 ob. were spent, but the first numeral of the sum is missing, so it is possible that the total was in fact substantially higher. 2527 Donnay (1963) 65. 2528 Formigli (1984) 120. Haynes (1992) 83 notes that between 10-15% tin in the alloy improves the mechanical properties of copper without rendering the metal too brittle. 2529 Haynes (1992) 83-84. 2530 Donnay (1963) 64.</page><page sequence="457">INSCRIPTIONS 1109 (3) Clay and Hair. These items are a regular but inexpensive feature of the accounts. They are mentioned in year 2/3, line 20; year 4, line 27; year 5, line 53; year 6, line 78; year 7, line 86; and year 8, line 113. The only preserved costs for these items are in year 6, when 66dr. were spent on them and in year 8 when at least lOdr. and possibly as much as 19 dr. were spent. Mattusch suggests that the clay was used to make the moulds for the bronze pieces that constituted the statue, and possibly also to make the core of the statue, though in such a big statue she thinks this might also have been of stone. In her opinion, the hair may have been mixed with the clay to reduce shrinkage.2531 The technique employed to make the statue is not known, and it is not clear that moulds were used at all. The admixture of hair in a clay core, however, would have helped to make the clay porous, allowing for the escape of gases during casting. (4) Wax. This is an item which one would expect to find in the accounts for a large hollow cast statue in bronze, but it can only be restored once in the extant fragments, and then only with uncertainty. This is in year 8, line 105. In that year, between 150 and 200dr. were spent on this item, but the amount purchased is not known. (5) Coals and firewood. These items are listed as follows: year 2/3, line 17; year 4, line 24, year 5, line 49, year 6, line 75, and year 8, line 110. The cost of these items is preserved in a fragmentary form only once. See year 6, line 75. They were used for firing the furnaces. Wages : Two separate groups of wages were paid out: there were the wages of the craftsmen and artists which were paid by the day, by the prytany (35-36 days), or by the job, and there were the annual salaries of the overseers, their secretary and their servant. The annual expenditure on the salaries of the administrators is preserved for year 6 (line 81-82) as l,963dr. 2ob. Raubitschek assumed that this can be broken down as follows: 1 drachma per day for each of the five overseers, of whom one was the secretary, and 1 obol per day for the servant (that is, a total daily expenditure of 31 ob. for the administrators in a year calculated as 380 days long).2532 Raubitschek restored the same annual expenditure for year 8.2533 According to him, therefore, the total expenditure on these salaries, over the nine year period, would be of the order of 17,670 dr. It is not known whether, at this period, the Athenians were using the 'prytany' calendar of 366 days every year or the calendar with intercalated months, equalling 384 days (plus or minus one day) in a leap year, and 354 days (plus or minus one day) in an ordinary year.2534 Donnay provided examples to show that the salaries of administrators were calculated by the day and remained unchanged during the year.2535 He concluded that year 6 of the 'Promachos' accounts must have been an intercalated month and, therefore, that year 8 cannot have been an intercalated month. If this is the case, then it would be wrong to restore the missing figures in lines 114-115 following lines 81-82, as Raubitschek did. Donnay suggested a 2531 Mattusch (1988) 169ff. 2532 Raubitschek (1943) 14-17. 2533 Raubitschek (1943) 17. 2534 Pritchett and Neugebauer (1947) 106 argued in favour of the prytany calendar, saying that the administrators might have been paid by the prytany or even that their salary may have changed during the course of the year, a view with which Donnay (1963) 7 Iff. and note 204 disagreed. 2535 por reference, see previous note.</page><page sequence="458">Ilio WRITTEN SOURCES figure of 1,860 dr., which would equal 11,160 ob., that is, 31ob. times 360 days. One might note that at Epidauros, the architect of the temple of Asklepios, dated to c.375-370 BC, received an annual salary of 353 drachmai.2536 The amount spent on wages to the labour force required to carry out the project is not known, and it is difficult to estimate as there seems to have been considerable annual variability. In year 6 we know that 6,600dr. 2ob. were paid for wages per day, per prytany, and per job (see line 76). In year 8, this expense was far higher, being at least 10,100 drachmai and possibly as much as almost 20,000 drachmai. One can also guess that in year 2/3 the amount spent on labour costs was high, for there is a wide discrepancy between the value of the disposable income for that year (78,110 dr.) and the amount spent on the purchase of metals (41, 202 dr.), the single most expensive item in the accounts apart from labour costs. Clearly the number of workmen involved on the project varied from one phase to another, depending on the tasks that needed to be done. If year 2/3 was the year in which the main casting work was done, then one would expect a large number of people to be involved in the project at that time. It is also understandable that the project should become more labour-intensive towards the end, when all the finishing touches were being made. Other expenses: (1) Furnaces. The building of furnaces is recorded at least three times as an important single expense connected with the project, obviously for casting the bronze. See year 2/3, line 16; year 5, lines 47-48; and year 6, line 74. It was probably also a feature of at least years 4 and 8, where coals and firewood are listed, items always mentioned immediately after the furnaces. The cost of the building of furnaces is never preserved. (2) àìTÒ touto êç hiepa. In lines 41, 68, and 100 these words can be restored. They form the first item of expenditure, before the mention of the purchase of metals. Because of the repetitive nature of these accounts, the phrase can also be restored in line 9 (yr. 2/3), where the amount spent on this item is preserved, 198 dr. In line 100 (year 8) the cost was less than 10 dr. Donnay compares these words with the first item of expenditure listed in the Erechtheion accounts, IG I3 476, 285-88: heis íepà |i[e]Ta tôv 8ep.i[op]ya)v hévei Kai véai heiç Qvoíav rèi ' Aöevaiai, and suggests that the expense represents money spent on sacrifices made to ensure divine protection against accidents for the artisans working in the foundry.2537 The sum spent in year 2/3, comparatively larger than that spent in year 8, seems to strengthen the idea that the bulk of the casting was carried out in year 2/3, when large quantities of metal were purchased. (3) [ ] Xe|jL This entry occurs once only, as the last item of expenditure in year 4, before the summary of the expenses for that year is given. Donnay suggests that this might be restored as KaTctßXe|ia and refer to the making of the statue's interior armature.2538 If this is so, then it would seem that the main body of the statue was cast in year 2/3 and then mounted on its base during the 4th. year. Compare IG I3 460, line 15 in the summary of the accounts for the Athena Parthenos, where the word KaTaßX€|ia is restored, though with doubtful meaning. 2536 IG IV2 1, 102, line 9.

Annual budgets are preserved in two years only and from these it is clear that the budget could differ widely in different years: in year 2/3 the budget was 78,110 dr. while in year 6 it was 12,997 dr. 1 ob. An estimated total of 83 talents is often quoted, following Dinsmoor's calculation.2539 This is often compared with the 80 talents given to the Plataians, after Marathon, to restore their sanctuary of Athena.2540 In the latter case, the sum covered the cost of the statue and the temple. If one examines Dinsmoor's reasons for estimating the cost as he does, it becomes apparent that they are not strong. The figure of 83 talents is based on an average estimated expense of 55,000 dr. per year, that is a total expenditure of around 500,000 dr. or 83 talents. The average annual expenditure is arrived at by assuming that in yr. 2/3 the mention of sums of c. 71,000 dr. and c. 34,000 dr. means that expenses might have gone as high as 100,000 dr., while in yrs. 6 and 8 the annual budgets were of the order of 10-12,000 dr. At the time Dinsmoor was writing, several fragments of the inscription had not yet come to light and the following points are now clear: 1 . the sum of c. 34,000 dr. in yr. 2/3 is an item of expenditure not income, which is in fact what Dinsmoor suspected, and that the total annual income for yr. 2/3 was c. 78,000 dr. rather than c. 100,000dr. 2. the sum of 10,100+ dr. mentioned in yr. 8 is not the total annual receipts, but rather an expenditure on wages. Dinsmoor's average might lie, therefore, not between c.l2,000dr. per year and c.l00,000dr. per year, but between c. 12,000 dr. and c. 80,000 dr. This would mean an average expenditure of c. 46,000 per year, and a total estimated expenditure of c.414,000 dr. or 69 talents. Since fragmentary figures survive for three years only out of at least nine years of accounts, it seems most hazardous to suggest that this estimate might be at all accurate, but the estimate is made to illustrate the point that if one uses Dinsmoor's method to estimate the cost, then with the further information available to us since Dinsmoor was working, it is clear that the cost of the statue might have been substantially less than Dinsmoor first thought. Donnay's estimated minimum weight of the statue, 775T, would involve a minimum cost of about 10T just for the metals involved in making the statue. One can add to that about 3T for the cost of the salaries of the overseers. But no other items of expenditure are known for certain and none can even be guessed at. The most important item on the list must surely be the total cost of wages to labourers and artisans, but the annual totals are known to have fluctuated greatly and there are simply not enough figures to allow one to come to any conclusions about this aspect of the total cost. 2539 Dinsmoor (1921) 126. 2540 So Plutarch, Arist. 20.3.</page><page sequence="460">1112 WRITTEN SOURCES TWO INSCRIBED BLOCKS, IG P 505 A B [ àv]éQe[&lt;jav ] - : Łk t dedicated from the Greek text : Lewis, D.

According to Raubitschek and Stevens, the inscription was cut on the lowest step of the base. Lewis had doubts about reading, [ ' AGevaîoi : âv]É0e[aav] : 6k t[wv : MeôiKÛv] and preferred to restore [TToXe|iiov] or [Méôov]. He also doubted the attribution of the inscription to the so-called Promachos statue base on the grounds of date.2544 Lewis pointed to the use of the cross bar theta which, he thought, dates the inscription quite firmly to a little later than 480 BC. This date would be much too early for the 'Promachos' dedication, if one accepts the evidence of the building accounts, IG I3 435. Bundgaard compared both the monumental size of the lettering and the use of the cross bar theta with those found on the Stoa of the Athenians at Delphi and argued on this basis that the form of the inscription does not prove that the inscription is as early as Lewis supposed.2545 The date and purpose of the Stoa of the Athenians at Delphi has been widely debated. The earliest studies of the building suggested that it was constructed in the 450s BC.2546 This view was challenged by Amandry, who argued that it was built in the 470s BC, as a monument to display spoils taken from the Persians by the Athenians.2547 Although his arguments won much support, they were judged not "quite compelling" by Meiggs and Lewis.2548 Walsh has since shown the weaknesses in Amandry's case for dating the monument so early and he has sought to show that the literary, archaeological and epigraphical evidence all points to a construction of the 450s BC, in celebration of an Athenian victory over the Spartans.2549 Of particular relevance here are his comments on the use of the cross bar theta which, he says, cannot be used on its own as a decisive dating criterion. As Meiggs and Lewis point out, the cross bar theta cannot be found on any dated public inscription after 490 BC, but this in itself is not conclusive dating evidence for Walsh, for the number of dated public inscriptions from about this time is very small. Furthermore, we do not know when the cross bar theta was superseded by the dotted theta and there are at least two inscriptions in existence which use both types of theta, showing that the change from one letter form to the other was not a strict transition. Walsh also points to the use in the Athenian stoa inscription of the isosceles alpha with horizontal cross bar and the epsilon with horizontal branches: both of these forms are later than the cross bar theta, so one should be wary of relying too heavily on the evidence of the theta alone. Walsh concludes that the use of the cross bar theta in this case may have been dictated by practical considerations, such as clear legibility from a distance and familiarity to the widest public, since the inscription was on a monument in a panhellenic sanctuary. Considering the dangers involved in relying too heavily on the cross bar theta 2544 Lewis (1994) IG I3 505 (fascicule 2). 2545 Bundgaard (1976) 165-67. 2546 Haussoullier (1881) 12; Hicks (1882) no. 20; Dittenberger (1898-1901) no. 3; Rouse (1902) 124. 2547 Amandry (1953) 104 and (1978) 582 n. 1. 2548 Meiggs and Lewis (1975) no. 25.

A further aspect of the blocks which probably succeeds in ruling out the theory that they were used in connection with the great bronze Athena of Pheidias is that all four faces were prepared with a smooth narrow border, enclosing a pick-dressed centre, suggesting that the blocks were not designed to lie side by side with any other blocks.2550 Gauer found it probable that the blocks belonged to the supports of a massive warship dedication made on the Akropolis after the Persian Wars. Their function as stanchions would explain why the stones were dressed as they are.2551 Subsequent work on the Akropolis has brought to light several more pieces from the same construction. 2550 Thompson (1965) 318, n. 4.

Bundgaard (1976) 167 also objected to Dinsmoor's suggestion (1967) 151-55 that the blocks, which have deep, irregular holes in their upper faces, were used to hold posts which carried the chains from the destroyed bridge of boats built by Xerxes across the Hellespont. He suggests that they were cut in the Middle Ages, when the blocks were reused for a different purpose as, for instance, "counterweights on a well sweep or the like." 2551 Gauer (1968) 73.

The stele measured 1.60m high, 1.80m wide, and 0.20m deep. On the two broad faces of the stele there are three double columns, in which the accounts for years 1-13 were inscribed, while the narrow faces bear year 14, which fills only half of the right side, and year 15, on the left side. It is possible that year 15 was not in fact the last year of the accounts, though this seems unlikely given that if there had been a sixteenth year this could easily have been fitted on to the right narrow face of the stele which remained blank.2552 The dates of the accounts: The dates can be fixed by certain pieces of evidence, drawn from the accounts themselves as well as from other sources. The year was identified by the name of the first secretary of the Boule, given in the prescript of the first ten years of the accounts; this was supplemented by the name of the archon in the last five years of the accounts. In year 14, the name of the archon, Krates, is preserved in the prescript. Thus year 14 is known to have been 434/433 BC, while year 1 was 447/446 BC and year 15 was 433/432 BC. These dates fit perfectly with the terminus post quern of 450/449 BC, provided by the carrying of Perikles's proposal to use 5000 talents of tribute funds to rebuild the temples of Athens,2553 and the terminus ante quern of the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War. If the Parthenon was begun in 447/446 BC, then it could well have been functional by 438 BC, the year in which the Athena Parthenos was dedicated.2554 Merritt has argued that there was a cycle in the reverse of the official order of the tribes for the treasurers of Athena from 443 BC to 430 BC.2555 Accounts format: The basic format used for the accounts was as follows: (1) Prescript a. years I-X : 1 . year number 2. name and demotic of first secretary of the Boule 3. name and demotic of the secretary of the overseers 4. names (?) of the overseers 5. name of the permanent under-secretary of the overseers b. years XI-XV (simplified format) 1 . name of the permanent under-secretary of the overseers 2. year number 3. name and demotic of first secretary of the Boule 4. name of Archon 2552For a summary of the fragments remaining and the available editions, see Lewis (1981) 431. 2553 ¿71, II, 16D 13. 2554 Scholia to Aristophanes, Pax , 605f. 2555 Merritt (1932) 26ff.</page><page sequence="483">INSCRIPTIONS 1135 (2) Revenue a.

Foreign currency (gold staters of Lampsakos and Kyzikos) Secretary of the epistatai: Each year one secretary was appointed to work with the board of epistatai. In the first ten years of the accounts, this person's name was the first to be mentioned. In the last five years, his name was not given at all, and instead the date of the year was specified by the name of the archon. The epistatai: Probably five in number, they were appointed annually. They were directly responsible to the Athenian people for the outcome of the project and they had to ensure that the work was progressing satisfactorily, that the workmen were being paid the right amount, that materials were being bought, delivered and used appropriately. Permanent under-secretary of the epistatai: Antikles was regularly named as the secretary of the epistatai, along with the annually appointed secretary. The term used, in the earlier prescripts, is x^uveypafiiiaTeue. Having a permanent member of staff on the administrative side must have been invaluable when so many other people came and went each year. Names of archontes: These were given in Years XI to XV. In order, they were Euthumenes, Lysimachos, (Year XIII too fragmentary), Krates, and Apseudes. The gold staters: Gold staters from Lampsakos and Kyzikos, which were never spent. The Kyzikene staters were paid into the League treasury as part of their tribute. Thompson gives the value of the Lampsakene stater as 24 drachmai, that is, seven times its weight in silver (it weighed 3dr. 3ob., or 15.36 grammes). He says that the Kyzikene stater weighed 1 oboi more (3dr. 4ob., or 16 grammes), so it should have been worth almost 7 obols more of</page><page sequence="484">1 1 36 WRITTEN SOURCES silver, that is about - though not exactly - 25 dr. apiece.2556 The Lampsakene and Kyzikene staters in the accounts did not amount to very much, probably about 2460 drachmai in total. Why this gold was never spent is not known.2557 Sources of Revenue: (A) The Treasurers of the Goddess. These were the Treasurers of Athena, who paid almost completely for the statue of the goddess and provided the main source of funding for the Akropolis building programme. How much money they controlled is unknown, but the figure is likely to have run into thousands of talents.2558 Like the Hellenotamiai, they too started to contribute to the Propylaia once that building project was under way. Until Year X, they gave regular contributions, at which point they turned their attention to the Propylaia, until Year XIV, when the Propylaia were almost finished. (B) Hellenotamiai. The Hellenotamiai, who administered the tribute from the Delian League, figure in the accounts of years 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10 but they are noticeably absent in years 11-15. This is because from 437/436, when the temple was structurally complete, down to 433/432 BC, they started to contribute to the Propylaia building project instead. Unlike the Treasurers of Athena, the Hellenotamiai contributed a fixed item of the Parthenon construction budget. This was the aTTapxîi of one sixtieth of the annual tribute of the Delian League, which Dinsmoor estimated to be about 40,000 drachmai per year.2559 This was the rightful share of Athena, so enemies of Perikles could not substantiate, from the accounts of the contributions of the Hellenotamiai at any rate, the claim that he was using League money for his building project. The Delian Treasury that was intended to protect all the Hellenes against the Persians had been transferred to Athens in 454 BC probably. At that time it perhaps amounted to some 8,000 to 10,000 talents.2560 Although admitting that there is no direct evidence for such a merger, Blamire believes that the funds of the Delian League were merged with the funds of Athena, making Athena the legal owner of the money, at some time between 449/448 BC, the Peace of Kallias, and 447/446 BC, the first year of the accounts for the Parthenon.2561 He also believes that the sum of 9,700 talents, to which Thucydides refers in II. 13.3, represents the amount of money in the fund at the time of the merger. By 431 BC, Athenian resources had diminished by 3,700 talents, according to Thucydides. This sum is interpreted by Blamire as the amount spent on the Periklean building project as well as on military campaigns and naval expeditions during this period. Certain entries in the accounts suggest that League money was used to build the Parthenon. For instance, League money was used to rebuild the Athenian trireme 2556 Thompson (1963) 1-4. 2557 See Wesenberg (1985) 50-51. 2558 Blamire (2001) 100 n. 3. 2559 Dinsmoor (1913) 53ff. 2560 Diodorus Siculus says 8,000 talents in XII.38.2 and 10,000 talents in XII.40.1-2, XII. 54. 3 and XIII.21.3. 2561 Blamire (2001) 99ff.</page><page sequence="485">INSCRIPTIONS 1137 fleet, which would safeguard all the Greeks, but the money left over from this operation was not put back into the League fund but diverted to the Parthenon project.2562 (C) Other sources of revenue. Particularly during the first ten years of the project, the treasury contributions were supplemented from various other sources, which gradually dwindled away as the project advanced towards completion and other projects, such as the Propylaia, started up. These included the following: 1. Surplus funds remaining from other public works: (i) Money from the Teichopoioi' (Year V, line 127), that is from the builders of the Middle Long Wall. This was undoubtedly surplus money from a budget provided by the Allied treasury. (ii) Money from the 'Trieropoioi' (Year IV, line 77), that is from the builders of the new fleet of triremes, again League money. This windfall must have been quite substantial, for of the five or six figure number only the last is preserved and that is M, 10,000 drachmai. Dinsmoor estimated 90,000 drachmai.2563 (iii) Money from the Public Baths, accepting the restoration of Lewis (Year V, line 121). Bathing establishments were not unknown in Classical Greece. Aristophanes mentions them several times, usually in a critical manner, regarding them as soft, luxurious places not fit for decent men.2564 In the Kerameikos at Athens one example has been found, complete with a water-heating system apparently linked to a potter's kiln.2565 2. Contributions from the Xenodikai (Year IV, line 75; Year V, line 26). These were the judges in cases for prosecutions for illegitimate citizenship, of which there were hundreds during this period. The amount of money involved is not known, though in Year IV the figure is partially preserved: four digits are missing at the beginning of the figure, so the sum involved must have been substantially greater than 2,148 drachmai, which is all that can now be read. 3. Profits from the Laureion silver mines (Year IX, line 249-50; Year X, line 294-95; both entries come from the Hephaistiacum silver mine). The mining area of Laureion extends for about twelve kilometres on a rather narrow stretch of land a couple of kilometres north of Cape Sounion. Over a thousand mineshafts have been discovered in this area. The mines were exploited in the 5th century BC, until the Peloponnesian War period. After some years of inactivity, the mines were again put into production, reaching a new peak in around 345 BC. The mines belonged to the state of Athens, so profits accrued from them funded many state projects. Land was leased to private entrepreneurs for a fairly low sum. When a new mine struck ore, it was registered as an 'ergasimon' mine and granted a three- year trial working period. This status meant that the production of the mine was taxed at a lower rate. There is very little information in the mining lease records concerning the State- levied silver tax and the procedure for collecting it. It seems that the tax increased when a mine became fully operational, going from an initial 1 /24th to as much as around 1/1 0th. 2562 For the argument that the Parthenon was not paid for by the tribute reserve, see Kallet-Marx (1989) 252-66 and Giovannini (1990) 129-48. 2563 Dinsmoor (1921) 243. 2564 See, for instance, Aristophanes, Nubes 837, 991, 1045. 2565 Wycherley (1962) 150 and 218 n. 7.</page><page sequence="486">1138 WRITTEN SOURCES When the mines were in full production the tax would have been an important source of State revenue.2566 It is no coincidence that the last entry of money from the mines in the Parthenon building accounts occurs in 438/437 BC. Once the Parthenon was substantially completed, funds were diverted to the Propylaia. The Laureion contribution of five-sixths, mentioned in years IX and X, may have been five-sixths of the state's income from the mines in those years.2567 4. Revenue from the sale of surplus materials. Entries of this kind occur only from Year X onwards, 438/437 BC, when the building was almost complete, apart from some of its decoration. Gold was sold off in Year X (line 296) and Year XIV (lines 389-91); wood was sold in Year X (line 298); ivory was sold in Year XI (lines 320-21) and Year XIV (lines 392-94); wood for wheels was sold in Year XI (lines 324-25); tin was sold in Year XI (line 326). Tin and other metals too, no doubt, were probably used for fittings. The wooden wheels must have been used to roll the great marble blocks to the Akropolis from the Pentelic quarries.2568 Large amounts of timber must have been used for scaffolding, as well as for the roof timbers. The gold and ivory are thought by some people to be surpluses from the statue of Athena Parthenos, which were turned over to the Parthenon and sold to raise money for the carving of the pediments.2569 There is, however, no firm proof that this was the case. The execution of the statue and the construction of the temple were handled by two separate groups of epistatai, who kept completely separate accounts. Furthermore, as was the case in other temples, ivory and gold were probably used to decorate the woodwork of the Parthenon.2570 Indeed, the information that gold was used in the adornment of the doors of the Hekatompedon, for example, is preserved in the inventory lists of the Parthenon treasures. In Year XII, line 351, there is an intriguing entry: a useless pair of items was sold off to increase the annual budget. But what were they? Shear suggests a pair of slaves who had become disabled in some way.2571 It seems doubtful that this would have raised enough money to merit an entry in the accounts. Burford suggests that this refers to some sort of worn-out mechanical equipment, perhaps a pair of lifting devices.2572 5. Donations by private individuals. As in some other cases, this source of revenue occurs first in Year X (lines 299-300), when the statue of Athena was finished and attention could be focused on the building. Eupheros, Sauron and one other, are named in Year X. 6. Funds from some holy precinct. See Year XII (line 350). This suggests contributions from other treasuries.2573 2566 Aperghis (1998) 15-19.

An estimate of 470 talents has been suggested, but the cost was probably over 500 talents, and it may have been as great as 700-800 talents.2574 Heliodoros, FGrHist , 373 F 1, is quoted as stating that the cost of the Propylaia alone was 2000 talents. But Blamire finds it more likely that this figure approaches the sum spent on the entire Akropolis building programme.2575 (A) Materials purchased Year IV, line 107: something made of fir-wood. This probably refers to roof timbers, considering that the purchase was made in the early years of the project. Year IX, lines 266-67: ivory. This may have been used, along with gold, to make decorations for doors and perhaps ceiling coffers. Year X, line 302; XI, line 329; XII, line 353; XIV, lines 396-97 (where cost is partially preserved): unspecific entry for oveļiaTov. It is not clear to what this might refer. Amongst the materials purchased there is a notable absence of any reference to the main material used, namely Pentelic marble. Like the Laureion silver mines, the Pentelic quarries were state owned, so the material was cost free. Even so, the idea of building a temple almost entirely of marble would have been quite infeasible if the quarries had not been so close. It was the labour involved in quarrying, transporting and working the stone which required vast expenditure. (B) Wages for the workforce Considering the fact that most of the materials required, except for the wood, ivory and perhaps some metals, were available for nothing, the most important item of expenditure must have been the cost of hiring the enormous workforce needed to carry out the job. This would have involved an army of unskilled workers as well as large numbers of skilled stone-masons, sculptors, carpenters, gilders and so on, not to mention the directing artists and architects. The fragments of the building accounts certainly provide an idea of the amount of time and effort involved in cutting, moving and dressing the stones, even if hard facts and figures are no longer extant. The accounts list payments of |ii(70o|iaTa, that is, wages to hired men, and most of the workforce seems to have been employed on this sort of basis. The epistatai acted as contractors, hiring men as and when they needed them. Burford suggests that even highly skilled craftsmen, such as the pediment sculptors, were not paid very well.2576 A day's wage was probably about one drachma for a skilled person and Boardman estimates that the regular workforce involved until the building was structurally complete must have been at least six hundred.2577 2574 Stonier (1953) 68ff. 2575 Blamire (2001) 101 n. 6. 2576 Burforcl (1963) 34. On the subject of wages, see notes to IG I3 435, the accounts of the Great Bronze Athena. 2577 Boardman (1985b) 225.</page><page sequence="488">1 140 WRITTEN SOURCES Workmen alluded to in the accounts include the following: 1. Quarrymen. In Year I (line 24), the first expense is for Xl0otÓ|iolç FlevTeXêGev, the 'stone-cutters' at the quarry, and a large sum of money is involved (about four or five numbers are missing at the beginning of the figure, which finishes with 4,700 drachmai). This entry is then found repeated in Year IX (line 270); Year X (line 304); Year XI (line 331); and Year XII (line 355). The work was slow, and obviously carried on from one year to the next. It involved great skill, for the blocks had to be cut to fairly specific measurements, avoiding any faults in the marble veins.2578 Although not mentioned in the accounts, limestone also had to be quarried and brought to the Akropolis from Piraeus in order to extend the existing temple foundations which were to be reused for the Periklean Parthenon. 2. 'Hewers' of stone. These were the peleketai, mentioned alongside the quarrymen in Years X (lines 304-05) and Year XI (lines 331-32), each time with reference to the stones earmarked for the pedimental sculptures. These men were named after their tool, the pointed hammer, which was used to give a rough dressing to blocks in order to reduce their bulk and weight before the blocks were carried to the building site. Since they are distinguished from the quarrymen, it seems likely that the 'hewers' were more skilled than the quarrymen and that they were able to block out sculptures in the stone. Perhaps they were apprentice sculptors. Their services were called for in the case of the pedimental sculptures because of the enormous size of these pieces. 3. Carters, hauliers, labourers, and road-builders. Once the blocks of stone had been cut, they then had to be transported down the mountainside, across the plain of Attika and up to the workshops on the Akropolis. Since one is talking about some 22,000 tons of marble, a substantial amount of this cut into enormous blocks, the task was no mean feat. For the first part of the journey the blocks were loaded on to sledges and the sledges were guided down a slipway, which can still be seen today, from the quarries to the road. The mountain rises to an altitude of 1 1 08m and the slipway, which was originally about 3km long, goes down to 470m.2579 From the end of the slipway the blocks were loaded on to ox-drawn waggons and taken to the foot of the Akropolis, about 17km away. This sometimes meant a two-day journey, involving up to forty yoke of oxen.2580 The shortest but hardest part of the journey was from there to the Propylaia. The distance is a mere 48m, but it involves a climb of 240m. For this part, the stones were pulled up the hill on waggons drawn by teams of mules.2581 Carting the stone from the mountain and hoisting it up to the workshops are two separate items of expenditure which can be found in Year I (line 24-25); Year IX (lines 271-72); Year X (lines 308-09);Year XI (lines 335-36); and Year XII (lines 356 and 359). The carters would probably have been farmers, making a bit of extra money with their beasts of burden when these were not required on the farm.2582 2578 Burford (1963) 32; Korres (1992) 8-25, 76-77. 2579 Korres (1992) 60, pictures 11-14. 2580 Korres (1992) pictures 15-17; Woodford (1981) 20. 2581 Korres (1992) 70, picture 18.

This would have been a complicated business and one requiring extreme care if the blocks were not to be damaged. Are these the same people as the general labourers on the mountain, mentioned in Year I (line 28) and Year IX (line 278)? The road-builders, mentioned in Year I (line 28); Year X (line 306);Year XI (line 333); and Year XII (line 357) must have been important in order to keep the traffic flowing. The paved slipway, used to get the stone down from Mount Pentelikon, and the road from there to Athens, had already been employed in the 480s BC when the Older Parthenon had been under construction, but the slipway may have needed extending and both the slipway and the road must have needed initial improvements as well as regular maintenance. 4. Stone-masons. Very few hints are given in these accounts about the work of the stone- masons, which was nevertheless very great. At the outset of the project, large quantities of marble were already on the Akropolis, either standing in the ruined predecessor of the Parthenon or awaiting use nearby. Some of the column drums were built into the Akropolis north wall, a striking memorial to the Persian Wars, but any stone which could be reused in the new temple was carefully cut and dressed to suit the new plan. This was possible because of the relative proportions of the old and the new temples. The new columns were taller but their diameter was exactly the same as that of the old columns, and the new capitals were smaller and lighter.2583 The six west porch columns, for instance, consist of reused material. The old foundations and stylobate were also reused, but here again the new temple, which was to be shorter and wider than its predecessor, required adjustments to be made. The foundations were widened by about 5m on the north side and the marble stylobate had to be adjusted too. In the accounts columns are mentioned in Year VI (line 160); and in Year IX they were probably being fluted. By this stage, the masons must also have been busy smoothing and polishing the walls. 5. Carpenters. Mentions of wood and woodwork occur several times in the accounts. In Year I (line 26) carpenters were paid, perhaps for erecting scaffolding; in Year IV (line 107) wood, probably for the roof, was purchased; in Year VII (line 207) the temple doors were under construction; and in Year IX (line 269) another payment was made for woodwork. Shear reckons that the roof and ceiling coffers must have been completed by this stage and suggests that the woodwork referred to in this account must have been the fourteen wooden grilles which enclosed the temple at either end.2584 6. Sculptors. Although these were clearly involved from fairly early on in the proceedings, working on the metopes and the frieze (of which the metopes at least and perhaps part of the frieze too were worked before installation), the sculptors are only mentioned in conjunction with the pedimental sculptures. Thus in Year X (line 310); Year XI (line 338); Year XII (line 360); Year XIII (line 368) and Year XIV (line 402-03) reference is made to payments made for their wages. Because of the uniform approach to the carving of the frieze, Symeonoglou considers that this work involved about nine or ten sculptors at most 2583 Korres (1992) 76-77 estimates that a finished capital from the older temple weighed about 10,300kg whereas the Parthenon capitals weighed about 7,500kg. 2584 Shear (1966) 276f.</page><page sequence="490">1 142 WRITTEN SOURCES and, through an analysis of details of carving in, for instance, drapery, faces and hands, she even considers it possible to attribute different parts to different master sculptors, each one specializing in certain techniques.2585 Younger, however, dislikes the idea of master sculptors dominating the production of the frieze. Through careful observation of the details of the composition and its execution, he finds it more probable that artisans of varying competence were involved in its production, while master sculptors worked more on the general design as well as on some of the finer details of execution. According to Younger, relatively unskilled hands would have transferred cartoons on to the marble, the moderately skilled would have removed the background, while skilled sculptors modelled the figures.2586 7. Gilders. See Year IX (line 274). 8. Silver workers. See Year IX (line 275). 9. Administrators and others. There is no specific reference in the accounts to payments made to the epistatai, the secretaries, the architects, the leading artists. Presumably they were all lumped together under the rubric KciTafievíoiç or KaTdļieviov, which occurs several times (see Year I, line 29; Year VIII, line 231; Year XI, line 339; Year XII, line 361 and Year XIV, line 403).2587 The Phases of Construction: From the information provided in the accounts, a chronological framework for the construction of the Parthenon can be outlined. 1. The Foundations, Stylobate and Superstructure, 447/446-439/438 BC. Year I (447/446): Expenses were almost completely confined to paying wages, especially for quarrying and transporting stone. It is possible that work on the site was already under way by as early as 449 BC, with preliminary jobs such as clearing and levelling being done, but the first year of the accounts marks the arrival on the site of the first new blocks of marble from the quarries. Carpenters were also at work, presumably preparing scaffolding. As mentioned above, the foundations and stylobate of the old temple ruined by the Persians were adjusted and strengthened to receive the new temple. For this purpose the foundations had to be widened by almost 5m on the north side and the stylobate was shifted slightly to the north. It was widened on the north side and shortened on the east side. The large quantity of marble blocks already on the site, belonging to the old temple, all had to be sorted out. The damaged blocks were discarded, the reusable blocks allocated to different parts of the building and cut and dressed as required. Year II (446/445): Large sums of money were spent this year, presumably on wages, though the fragments here are very incomplete. Work on the substructure continued and perhaps masons started cutting the blocks for the superstructure. The first part to go up would have been the outer colonnade. 2586 Younger (2004) 63-85. Neils (2005b) 214-15 thinks that the frieze may have had two designers. 2587 See Wesenberg (1985) 51 and n. 18.</page><page sequence="491">INSCRIPTIONS 1143 Year III (445/444): The inscriptions are very fragmentary. Once the outer colonnade was built, the next job would have been the construction of the naos walls, the porch columns and the double-tiered colonnade for the interior. Year IV (444/443): A reference to the purchase of pine-wood suggests that the roof was now being started. More expensive and more enduring woods, such as cypress, may have been used too.2588 The beams across the inner colonnade had to span a width of eleven metres. These would have needed to be at least seventy centimetres square. The purlins were even bigger, measuring almost one metre square in cross-section. Once the huge wooden beams and rafters were in place, they were covered with marble tiles. Year V (443/442): Work continued, probably on the roof. Year VI (442/441): The main structure of the building must have been nearing completion by now. Columns are mentioned and something made of wood. Perhaps work continued on the roof and ceilings started to be put in. The ceiling coffers were made of marble. The metopes may now have been finished and set in place. These reliefs are thought to have been carved on the ground, probably over a period of several years. The frieze blocks would also have been in position by now but they may not have been carved until several years later.2589 Year VII (441/440): Very fragmentary. Year VIII (440/439): The doors are mentioned. This suggests that the building was now structurally complete and that the stone-masons were busy with the fine dressing of the surfaces of the walls and floors, a laborious work which may have taken several years, depending on the number of stone-masons. Year IX (439/438): Marble was still coming down from the quarries, perhaps now for the beginning of work on the pedimental sculptures, as well as for the great Nikai set on the four corners of the roof. Work in precious materials and in wood is also recorded. This suggests that the decoration of the temple was under way. The ceiling coffers and the marble mouldings would have been adorned. For the very fragmentary accounts of the Parthenon doors, see IG I3, 461, dated by Lewis to 438 BC. 2. The Pedimental Sculptures, 438/437-433/432 BC. Year X (438/437): In this year is found the first extant record of work on the pedimental sculptures, which then dominate the accounts until their close. The accounts are too fragmentary to be sure that work on the pediments did not start before this date, but it seems likely that this was the case. The sale of surplus gold and wood suggests that the interior of the temple was complete and that some of the scaffolding was no longer needed. Enough scaffolding must have been kept to work on the pediments as well as on the frieze. It was in this year that the newly finished image of Athena by Pheidias was dedicated. 2588 Cypress is mentioned in the accounts of the Parthenon doors, IG I3 461, line 35. 2589 From the varying sizes of the peristyle frieze backers, Korres (1994c) 92-108 argues that the design of the Parthenon was modified after the east front was built. Instead of having metopes over the porches, as originally planned, the building was given metopes around the whole of the exterior of the building as well as a continuous frieze around the outside of the cella. Jenkins (1994) 19 argues for a date in the 430s BC for the frieze sculptures, which would make them contemporaneous with the pedimental sculptures.</page><page sequence="492">1 144 WRITTEN SOURCES Year XI (437/436): The major topic is again the pedimental sculptures, and revenue is raised from the sale of surplus materials and construction equipment. Year XII (436/435): Work continued as in Year XI. Year XIII (435/434): Very fragmentary. Year XIV (434/433): Work continued as before. The figures for the accounts of this year are well preserved, showing that of the total annual income, of 29,147 dr. 4ob., 16,392dr. was paid for the wages of the sculptors of the pediments, and a further l,800dr. covered the wages of the other workers, that is the epistatai, their secretaries, and presumably the architects. Year XV (433/432): Very fragmentary. The accounts now closed, as the work was completed. A detailed study of all the remaining architectural blocks is gradually shedding further light on the manner in which the temple was constructed and the order in which work was carried out. The building's unique design is the result of much experimentation and innovation, and it now appears that many modifications were incorporated into the plan as the building went up. Considering the complexity and harmony of the finished temple, it seems extraordinary that the architects were apparently working without 'a thoroughly worked out preliminary plan involving detailed scaled drawings'.2590 But Yeroulanou's careful examination of the building, in particular of all the differences between the east and west ends, leads her to this conclusion. She focuses on the discrepancies in the lengths of the architrave blocks, the metope blocks, the intercolumniations, and the three stylobate blocks under each intercolumniation. Whereas the west end of the building follows a fairly orthodox pattern, the east end shows signs of experimental modifications which suggest that construction must have started at this end. Furthermore, at the point at which a serious misalignment of the krepis blocks and the column positions was noticed at the eastern end of the building, the corner metopes must have been carved already and the corner architrave blocks cut. For, rather than shortening the width of the corner metopes and architrave blocks in order to minimize the misalignment, the builders chose to shorten those next to the corners and to displace to the west the second columns of the east ends of the flanks. If this is correct, then decisions about the sculptural decoration of the metopes must have been preceded by the laying of the stylobate. By the time the builders came to the west end of the building, they had managed to sort out all these difficulties and they seem to have proceeded without having to make alterations. Yeroulanou's curiosity in this matter was aroused by the fact that the metopes of the east side are not all of the same length and the differences cannot be attributed to the complexity of their sculptural decoration. 2590 Yeroulanou (1998) 424.

During this period, we have detailed accounts, sometimes kept in a more orderly fashion than at other times, of the treasures kept on the Athenian Akropolis, in the Proneos, the Hekatompedon, the Parthenon, the Opisthodomos, as well as the Erechtheion, the Chalkotheke and the Stoa of Artemis Brauronia. The Hekatompedon is the name used by the Treasurers of Athena for the east chamber of the Parthenon temple, which housed the great chryselephantine statue by Pheidias.2592 The Pronaos denotes the front porch of the temple, a space which was probably designed and certainly used as a treasury. The Parthenon and the Opisthodomos may have been parts of the same building, but their exact location remains to be proved. The Parthenon originally contained the bronze stele with the inventory list of the Athena Parthenos. It is generally assumed that the Parthenon refers to the large west chamber of the temple or perhaps the west chamber plus the back porch.2593 The word 'opisthodomos' usually means the rear room of a temple, but in the context of the treasures lists, it is not certain what this word designates. Possibilities include the west chamber of the Parthenon, its west porch, or perhaps the west chambers of the old temple of Athena Polias. A fuller discussion of these four treasuries, their possible whereabouts and their contents, is included in Volume 1 The Parthenon, section 1. Amongst the treasures listed in the inventories was the Athena Parthenos though, as mentioned above, this statue formed the subject of its own special inventory, from at least 385/384 BC if not earlier. Several details concerning the Pheidian masterpiece can be gleaned from these inventory lists, helping one to form an impression of its state down to the end of the 4th century BC. The inventory lists also give a little information about the temple itself, in particular about the doors of the Hekatompedon. 1.

IG II2, 1428, lines 9-24 (367/366 BC). IG II2, 1431, lines l^t (c. 367/366 BC). If inscriptions (i) and (ii) above refer to the same Nike, then they provide some valuable information about the statue. One point of interest relates to the date when the wreath is first mentioned as being part of the treasures in the Parthenon naos, namely 428/427 BC. The inventory lists started in 434/433 BC, and the wreath was listed as a new acquisition in 428/427 BC. Therefore, the wreath was not part of the Pheidian composition, which may have been bare-headed, and it was added later, probably to celebrate some military triumph. Donnay suggests Phormion's two victories at Patras and Naupaktos in 429/428 BC.2602 Whatever the occasion, the wreath must have been important, to judge from its numerous mentions in the lists, which are not always as complete or systematic as they might have been, and from the fact that it clearly escaped several treasure melt-downs that occurred during the late 5th and the 4th centuries BC.2603 The other point of interest concerns the fact that down to 408/407 BC the weight of the wreath is always given, whereas from 405/404 BC the wreath is said to be aaTa0p.oç. This is perhaps related to the fact that from 402/401 BC, there appear in the Parthenon inventories four golden olive leaves which are said to be 'from the wreath which the Nike holds, the Nike in the hand of the statue, weight 6dr. 2ob.'2604 It is possible that the wreath was damaged some time between 408/407 and 405/404 BC, either by accident or possibly as a result of the troubled times around 404 BC, and that four leaves of the wreath became detached; the leaves were 2602 Donnay (1968b) 22-25. 2603 /GII2 1447 14ff. records something of the crown's appearance: it consisted of golden twigs, leaves (at least 288) and olives (at least 51). 2604 /GII2, 1376, lines 19-21; 1377, 22-24; 1394, 5-8; 1395, 22-24 and 1414, 10-11.</page><page sequence="499">INSCRIPTIONS 1151 then transferred from the Hekatompedon to the Parthenon for safe-keeping and the treasurers subsequently decided either that it was no longer necessary to give the weight of the wreath in this incomplete state or that it would be dangerous to try to weigh the wreath and risk further damage to an already delicate object. 3.

The rubric ¿ k tô FlapBe vwuoç, 'from the Parthenon,' in no. 1377, shows that by 399/398 BC all the dedications that had formerly been kept in the Parthenon chamber were now moved to the Hekatompedon, but they continued to be inventoried together on separate stelai. 4.

Unfortunately, none of these entries specify the provenance of the fragment beyond the words, àirò toO ßaGpou, which, as Harris points out, could also mean from the backless seat, footstool or bench. But if the words do mean 'from the base' of the statue, as in no. 1388 lines 64-65 above, then this might refer to a fragment from the figured decoration of the base, as Donnay inferred.2611 The base relief depicted the birth of Pandora.2612 If Donnay is right, then these inscriptions would provide evidence both that 2608 Donnay (1968b) 25, n. 7. 2609 Harris (1991) 341, no. 504. 2610 Harris (1991) 356, no. 42 and (1995) 116, no. 13. 2611 Donnay (1968b) 25-26. 2612 See Volume 1, chapter 6.4.</page><page sequence="501">INSCRIPTIONS 1153 the base of the Athena Parthenos was decorated with chryselephantine figures, and that it had already suffered some damage, with parts of the adornment becoming detached, by the early 4th century BC.2613 The inscriptions IG II2 1468 and 1477 state that the base was complete in the years 321/320 BC and 304/303 BC respectively. It is possible that the base had been repaired by then. On the other hand, perhaps the little helmet with its gold and ivory decorations, mentioned in this inscription, was in fact not part of the base at all, but a small votive offering set upon the base. That bases were used for such a purpose seems to be confirmed by finds in the naos of the temple of Nemesis at Rhamnous, for instance.2614 As Leipen points out, other gold objects mentioned along with the little helmet include earrings and rings, and these are much more likely to be offerings placed on the base than pieces detached from the base relief.26!5 There is certainly evidence to show that the base of the Parthenos was probably not simply a marble relief.2616 That the figures were either golden or made of gilded bronze, dowelled on to a stone background, would fit in with Pliny's description of the base as caelatum , a term he usually reserves for metal working, and which he also employs for the shield of the Athena Parthenos.2617 It would also explain the need to mention the base separately as a precious item in the inventories, along with the shield and the statue. Considering the proximity of the base reliefs to viewers, it is not surprising that a careful check was kept on its condition, especially if the reliefs were made of valuable materials. It should be remembered that, according to Pausanias, V.11.8, the figures on the base of Pheidias's Zeus at Olympia were 'golden' and that they were set against a background of dark Eleusinian limestone, so it is possible that a similar technique was used for the base of the Parthenos. 6.

Donnay concludes that one and the same object is being referred to in all these inscriptions. According to him, it is first mentioned as having become detached from the base of the statue and, about twenty years later, as having lost its most precious parts. Harris too thinks that the same helmet is being referred to in all these inscriptions. But it is possible that these are separate little votive offerings placed upon the base by worshippers and completely unconnected with the base reliefs of the statue.2621 7.

(1885) Inschriften griechischer Bildhauer, mit Facsimilen, 323-326, no. 494. Leipzig: Teubner. Date : Uncertain. Perhaps 1st century AD. The so-called Dioscuri of Monte Cavallo (Monte Cavallo being the medieval name for the Quirinal in Rome) form a colossal marble statue group, c. 5.51m high. Two naked men are depicted, steadying their rearing horses. They stand almost symmetrically, both figures leaning on the outer, bent leg, and they face each other so that their heads are seen in profile in relation to their bodies. They stand against their horses, holding the bridle in one, raised hand. The figure on the left has his left upper arm, which is raised, covered in drapery, while the figure on the right has his left lower arm, which is held down, covered in drapery. Against the main supporting leg is set the cuirass, indicating the military role of the pair. The horses also face towards each other, turning their heads towards the centre of the composition. The figures were originally set in niches of a nymphaeum in the Baths of Constantine. They are Roman works, but the pose and style of the pieces suggest "Parthenon overtones".2638 Gury dates them to the time of Constantine.2639 The inscriptions on the bases claim that one is by Pheidias, the other by Praxiteles. The inscriptions seen today date from the 16th century, but these are inverted transcriptions of inscriptions dating from the late antique period, perhaps the 4th or 5th century AD.2640 The fact that both the statues share the same style and that they were made as a symmetrical pair precludes the possibility that they are even copies of works by the two Classical masters named in the inscriptions. Bendinelli suggests that the inscriptions were made in the 4th century AD to protect the statues from destruction at the hands of Christian iconoclasts.2641 If this is the case, then the attributions would be gratuitous. On the other hand, perhaps the inscriptions are faithful copies of earlier signatures, or perhaps they were added with the support not of the epigraphical tradition but of an oral or written tradition.2642 If either of these possibilities is correct, then the inscriptions could have a basis in fact. According to Corso, there is reason to believe that the last possibility is the 2638 Palagia (1993) 9 and n. 24. 2639Gury (1986) 619. 2640 Löwy (1885) no. 494. 2641 Bendinelli (1962) 1, 270-71. 2642 Corso (1988) 33-34.</page><page sequence="509">INSCRIPTIONS 1161 correct one, for the anonymous Mirabilia Urbis Romae , 14, perhaps dating in its earliest form from the 1 1th century AD, attributes these works to two sculptors of the Tiberian era who are named as Fidias and Praxitelus. Disagreeing with Gury, Corso thinks the works could date from the first decades of the 1st century AD, and he is of the opinion that the artists named are perhaps two unknown Tiberian sculptors who used the names of famous Greek artists, hoping to gain popularity in this way. For, as is clear from the literary sources, Pheidias and Praxiteles were often cited together as the most famous dya'|iaT0TT0i0L of the ancient world in Hellenistic and Imperial times. It would not be surprising if the names became confused with the famous Classical homonyms in the late antique period, by which time the great Classical sculptors were almost unknown as individuals and were often cited in an interchangeable way as nomina excellentiae.

The reading of the last line, which is very damaged, is probable but not certain. The base measures 26cm in height and 9.5cm in diameter. The figure it carried must, therefore, have been very small. The mention of a statue of Eros in Athens by Pheidias, on which the Timgad statue was based, may be misleading. But see Athenaios, Deipn.

The statue was dedicated by Hermodotos, possibly grouped with a statue of Aphrodite. The terminology used in these lines is close to that of Anth. Gr.

The Athenians to Apollo, after their victory over the Medes as first fruits of the booty of the Battle of Marathon. Greek text : Audiat, J. (1930) La Dédicace du trésor des Athéniens à Delphes. BCH 54, 296-321, pls. XV-XVI. Date : Perhaps c.480-460 BC, then rewritten at the earliest in the 3rd century BC. Beneath the long south side of the Treasury of the Athenians at Delphi is a triangular terrace, made of tufa surrounded by grey limestone, and originally paved. On it is a long limestone base, composed of two steps. The lower step is made of two rows of blocks, except at the two ends. It is parallel with the south wall of the Treasury and the back blocks rest directly upon one course of the masonry blocks of the Treasury foundations which protrude by between 15-3 0cm along the south wall at the level of the bottom of the lower step of the base.2649 Several of these blocks were found in situ. Others were discovered nearby and replaced. The blocks of the upper step of the base, which bear the inscription and which numbered twelve in total, had all been moved from their original positions. Nine have now been rediscovered while three are still missing, two blocks from the middle of the base, numbers five and six, and the last block, number 12. Five blocks were found lying on the terrace or close by, one was with blocks of the lower step, and three had been reused in later buildings. The letters inscribed on the base show clear signs that the base was altered, perhaps several times in its history, and that it served for two major uses. The dedication was originally made in smaller letters that were closer together. These letters were effaced later on, to be replaced by larger ones - spelling the same words - at the time when the whole monument was elongated in the 3rd century BC. At this time, several of the blocks on the left hand side were left unchanged, perhaps four or five, but then a block was inserted in the middle of the base and two blocks were added on the right hand side, at an oblique angle to the front of the monument. Holes in the upper surface of the blocks show clearly where attachments were fitted into the base to secure the dedications.2650 It has often been argued that the use of the word dicpoGivia in the inscription, the first fruits of the battle, meant literally the best of the weapons, armour and other booty taken by the victors from the field. Amandry, however, makes clear that the word aKpoGivia, like 06kótt1 in many other dedications, is meant in the sense of a monument which stands in lieu of booty.2651 It seems probable, therefore, 2649 Amandry (1998) 75ff., especially 87-89. 2650 Amandry (1998) fig. 4, a and b. 2651 Amandry (1998) 82-84.</page><page sequence="515">INSCRIPTIONS 1167 that a statue group adorned the base and that where there had originally been ten statues, there were later thirteen statues if not one or two more. The inscription which links the dedication to the victory at Marathon and the coincidence that the monument was extended in the Hellenistic period have suggested to many scholars that the monument Pausanias describes in X.l 0.1-2, of which there is no trace in the location he specifies near the sanctuary entrance, can be identified with the Treasury base. Pausanias's base carried the Miltiades Monument made by Pheidias and, according to this theory the base must have been moved, for unknown reasons, after Pausanias saw it. There is as yet no proof that the two can be associated. Indeed, Amandry 's thorough investigation of the Treasury foundations and south terrace seem to demonstrate quite clearly that the Treasury, the terrace and the base were all planned at the same time. Others have argued that the dedicatory inscription on the base applied to the Treasury itself but the lack of any reference to the building in the inscription makes this unlikely. When Pausanias mentions the Treasury, in X.l 1.5, he says it was built from the spoils of the landing of Datis at Marathon (óttò tov Mapaöüva aTToßavTwv o'lov Aótiôl). This information may not be the paraphrase of any inscription, but simply what he was told by a guide.2652 2652 ¡n 1991 9 Vatin published further inscriptions which he claims he read on the upper surface as well as on the sides of the blocks of the upper step of the base. According to Vatin, these inscriptions show that the monument underwent several alterations, one of which was carried out by Pheidias at the same period as he was working on the Miltiades Monument. Vatin further claims that he has found several of the blocks of the Miltiades Monument by Pheidias, in the grounds of the Ecole Française, and that these bear important inscriptions which prove their identity. His publication of the inscriptions includes detailed transcriptions but no photos of the stones in question. Other scholars have been unable to find any trace of the inscriptions Vatin records. His work is therefore unverifiable at present. For further comments and references, see Krumeich (1997) 96 n. 366. BIBLIOGRAPHY Amandry, P. (1981) Chronique Delphique (1970-1981). BCH 105, 677.

Prag interprets the meaning of the inscription as "one Fiorina dedicated to Athena a statuette (at least one) of Pheidian type, which stood on the base".2653 The base is 5 1 cm high. Prag suggests that the Pheidian statue type dedicated on this base was probably an Athena Parthenos. There is evidence in the coins of southern Asia Minor, as well as in a relief from Selimiye in Cilicia, to prove that the Athena Parthenos type was familiar in the region, probably through a local replica or through a local statue adapted from the type.2654 2653 Prag (1984) 186. 2654 Prag (1984) pl. 12, 1-4.

Titus Flavius Heraclitus, a Roman citizen of some importance, one infers, is called a 'descendant of Pheidias' and has the title 'phaidyntes of the Zeus of Olympia.' Donnay states that the inscription dates from the time of Hadrian, and he further suggests that the title 'phaidyntes' originated at this time.2655 The title was of honorary and ritual importance, and it is doubtful whether the holders of the title had any real family link with Pheidias. Hadrian established the title in other Greek sanctuaries also: there is evidence from inscriptions for phaidyntai at the Athenian Olympieion, IG II2 5072 ((ļ)ai6wroi) Aioç'OXu|iTnos èv doTei, 'of the phaidyntes of Olympian Zeus in the city', inscription found on a seat in the theatre of Dionysos at Athens) and 4075, 4, and the Eleusinion, IG II2, 1078, 16.

He taught rhetoric and wrote several works, mostly of a moralizing or philosophical nature. Many of his ideas derive from Stoicism. De Natura Animalium : Anecdotes drawn from the animal world. Aeschines, the Athenian orator (c.397-c.322 BC) and bitter opponent of Demosthenes. In Ctesiphontem : Speech written in 330 BC. Aineias of Gaza, rhetor of the 5th-6th century AD. He was a pupil of the Alexandrian Neoplatonist philosopher Hierokles, who lived between around AD 402-470, and a contemporary of Prokopios of Gaza (AD 468-528). He was probably a Christian. Theophrastos : A dialogue discussing the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body. Theophrastos is taught the ideas of the master Euxitheos. Georgios Akropolites was a teacher and historian, as well as a civil official. Akropolites was born in Constantinople in AD 1217 and he died there in AD 1282. Chronike Syngraphe: The work covers the period AD 1203-1261. It is the author's most famous work. Theodoros Skoutariotes used it as a source for his own Chronicle. Alexander Aphrodisiensis was a Peripatetic philosopher of the 3rd century AD and he was much admired for his commentaries on the works of Aristotle. In Aristotelis Sophisticos Elenchos commentarius : A commentary on the Sophistici Elenchi of Aristotle. Alkiphron. Nothing is known of this writer's life, and he is not mentioned by any ancient author. He is called 'rhetor' in the manuscripts, as well as by Tzetzes (scholion, Chil. VIII. 895) and Eustathios {Adii IX.453). Because of marked similarities with Lucian, he is sometimes thought to have drawn on this writer's works. He may have lived in the 2nd or 3rd century AD, though no satisfactory terminus ante quern has yet been established and his dates may well prove to be later than this. Epistulae : A collection of letters which purport to have been written by 4th century BC Athenians - fishermen, farmers, parasites and hetairai. Ammianus Marcellinus : The last great Roman historian. He came from Antioch and was of Greek parentage, but he travelled widely after he joined the army (he went with Julian on his Persian Expedition in AD 363), and he finally settled in Rome after AD 378. He lived from about AD 330 to 395. Res Gestae : This history covered the period AD 96-378. The first thirteen books, dealing with the years up to AD 352 are lost. The surviving books 14-31 deal in great detail with the years AD 353-378. Ammianus was a pagan and a great admirer of the Emperor Julian. Lucius Ampelius : Writer of the 2nd-3rd century AD.

Expositio totius mundi et gentium: 6th century Latin translation of a 4th century AD didactic work on geography, which focuses on the economical resources of the Roman world in the 4th century AD. Paragraphs 1 to 21 deal with the countries of the Orient beyond the limits of the Roman world. Paragraphs 22 to the end look at countries under Roman control. The original Greek work is now lost, but it is known in this translation as well as in a shorter and more recent version known as the Descriptio totius mundi. Anonymus Seguerianus: Sometimes ascribed to Cornutus, the Roman philosopher of the 1st Century AD, the Ars Rhetorica probably dates from about the 3rd or 4th century AD. Anthologia Graeca : A large collection of Greek poetic epigrams, with works going back as far as Archilochos, put together over several centuries. Most of the works form part of the Anthologia Palatina, which contains about 3,700 epigrams arranged in fifteen books. This anthology survived in a single manuscript, found in the library of Count Palatine in Heidelberg, hence its name. The large volume was compiled in around AD 980. The poems were organized as follows: (1) pious works by Christians (2) description of statues in one of the baths of Constantinople (3) description of statues in a Cyzican temple (4) poetic prefaces for anthologies by Meleager, Philippos and Agathias (5) love poems (6) dedicatory poems (7) epitaphs (8) epitaphs etc. by Gregory Nazianzenos (9) epideictic epigrams (10) poems on life and morality (11) satirical and convivial epigrams (12) poems on homosexual love (13) poems in unusual metres (14) riddles and puzzles (15) miscellaneous</page><page sequence="521">AUTHORS AND THEIR WORKS 1 1 73 The Anthologia Planudea was put together by Planudes, a monk of the 13th/14th century AD. He included almost 400 poems which are not in the Anthologia Palatina , and these are the ones that are nowadays printed under this name. Book 7, Palatina , epigram 25: Possibly written by Simonides (around 556-468 BC), though this is not certain. Book 8, Palatina , epigram 177: by Gregorios of Nazianzos (AD 329-389). Book 9, Palatina , epigram 58: by Antipater of Sidon {floruit around 120 BC). Book 9, Palatina , epigram 599: by Theokritos (c.300-c.260 BC). Book 16, Planudes , epigram 81: by Philippos of Thessalonike, who was writing at the beginning of the 1st century AD. Book 16, Planudes , epigram 157: by Ioulianos: Prefect of Egypt, born in AD 475. Book 16, Planudes , epigram 169: An anonymous work of the Hellenistic period. Book 16, Planudes , epigram 170: Hermodoros : writing in about the 2nd century BC. Book 16, Planudes , epigram 306: Written by Leonidas of Tarantum. Antipater of Sidon, the poet, flourished around 120 BC. Some seventy-five epigrams of his are in the Anthologia Graeca. Some of these are based on earlier Hellenistic works. Anthologia Palatina 9, 58: A poem on the wonders of the world. Appendix Proverbiorum : The origins of the existence of the medieval Corpus Paroemiographorum go back to Zenobius, a sophist of the time of Hadrian. A number of smaller medieval collections of proverbs also exist. These were mostly prepared for teachers of rhetoric and some of them contain proverbs not in the Corpus . Apuleius was born at Madaurus in Africa in about AD 123. He gained fame as a poet, philosopher and rhetorician. The date of his death is not known. He is best remembered for his novel, The Golden Ass. De Mundo : This work is a translation or adaptation in Latin of a treatise, Flepi Koaļiou, written around the mid 1st century BC to the mid 1st century AD by an anonymous author who passed himself off as Aristotle. Whether or not this work can be ascribed to Apuleius is now strongly doubted. It is dedicated to someone called Faustinus. Apuleius may have had a son by that name. Arethas, archbishop of Caesarea in AD 907. A number of his notes on Greek texts are preserved. Aelius Aristides, from Mysia, lived from about AD 117 or 129 until about AD 181 or later. He studied Greek literature and rhetoric, but he was unable to pursue a career in public life because of ill health. He spent most of his life in Smyrna, writing and lecturing. Oratio 1: Called the Panathenaikos and probably delivered at the major Panathenaea in AD 155, the oration is a panegyric on Athens. Chapters 335-401 aim to show the superiority of Athens. Oratio 2: The Defence of Oratory (Ilepi pīļTopiKfļs) was written in Pergamům between AD 145 and 147, and it was prompted by attacks on oratory made by Cynic philosophers using the arguments of Plato's Górgias . Chapters 32-134 deal with the result of conceding</page><page sequence="522">1 1 74 WRITTEN SOURCES that oratory is not an art, followed by arguments to prove that it is indeed an art. This text is quoted by Photios, writing in the mid 9th century AD, in Bibliotheca , 247. Oratio 3: In this speech, * Tirèp tQv rerrapuv, Aristides composed his final attack on Plato's Górgias , some time between AD 161-165. Oratio 34: KaTa twv e£opxoup.evG)v, Against those who burlesque the mysteries (of Oratory). The speech was delivered in Smyrna in AD 170. Aristides argues that oratory is pure and sacred, like a mystery religion, and that the orator is an initiate into this mystery. Orationes 47-5 1 : The first five in a set of originally six Sacred Tales (the sixth is now almost completely lost), which were composed in retirement. Aristides recounts every occasion in his life when Asklepios helped him either by improving his health, saving his life or advancing his career. Aristodemos, the historian, lived probably in the 4th century AD. He wrote a history of Greece, including at least the period 480-431 BC, but the work survives only in fragments. Aristophanes, the greatest writer of Old Comedy, died around 385 BC. His year of birth is not known; it may have been earlier than 457 BC or as late as 445 BC. Aves: Won second prize at the City Dionysia in 414 BC. An Athenian persuades the birds to build a city in the clouds. Equités : Produced in 424 BC, winning Aristophanes first prize at the Lenaea. The play is a bitter attack against Kleon and the demagogues after the Athenian victory at Pylos, which suddenly made Kleon a national hero. Paphlagon, who stands for Kleon, loses his place as favourite slave of Demos to a sausage-seller. Pax : Produced at the City Dionysia in Spring 421 BC. In confident mood, this play celebrates the peace agreement about to be made between Athens and Sparta at this time. Plutus : Produced in 388 BC. The play concerns what happens when the god of wealth is cured of his blindness. Thesmophoriazousai : Written in 410 BC, this play concerns the Thesmophoria, an all- women festival in honour of Demeter and Persephone. Aristotle, the philosopher, 384-322 BC. Athenaion Politeia : An account of the constitution of Athens, written about 329-328 BC. Ethica Nicomachea : This is a treatise on moral science, written for Nichomachos, Aristotle's son. Book VI deals with the intellectual virtues. The work dates from the later 4th century BC. The first edition of this work cannot have appeared much before 300 BC. Historia animalium : The first draft of this work was probably written between 347 and 342 BC, while Aristotle was at Assos and Mytilene, before he went to the court of Philip of Macedón. It is a very full and detailed account of the habits and characteristics of animals. Of the ten books, the last is though not to be by Aristotle. Books I - IV: a comparative anatomy of animals. Books V-VII: the reproduction of animals. Books VIII-IX: the character and lifestyle of animals. The books were accompanied by illustrations in the text. Corpus Aristotelicum De Mirabilibus Auscultationibus : This work, which is certainly not by Aristotle but perhaps by the Peripatetic School, comes down to us as part of the Aristotelian 'corpus'. It</page><page sequence="523">AUTHORS AND THEIR WORKS 1 1 75 is a collection of disparate notes on various subjects, all strange or marvelous, and more or less interesting. Many of the remarks are concerned with animals and plants. The passage quoted is found almost unchanged in another part of the Corpus, De Mundo. De Mundo : A work generally thought not to be by Aristotle. Usually dated to the earlier 2nd century AD, and considered as deriving most of its doctrines from Poseidonius. Reale, however, disputes this idea, arguing that the work is by Aristotle and that it dates from the period 343-340 BC.2656 Arnobius lived in the later 3rd and early 4th centuries AD. He was a convert to Christianity (around AD 295) and he wrote strongly against paganism. Before his conversion he practised rhetoric in Proconsular Numidia. Adversus Nationes : Arnobius wrote this work in seven books towards the very end of the 3rd century AD. It argues against opponents of Christianity. Arrian (Lucius Flavius Arrianus), the historian, came from Bithynia and lived in the 2nd century AD. He was consul in around AD 130 and governor of Cappadocia under Hadrian for six years until AD 137. He wrote several histories and in addition he kept a written account of the lectures of his teacher Epictetus, the Stoic philosopher. Alexandři Anabasis : Arrian's most important work, a history of Alexander the Great. His main source for the work was Ptolemy I. Dissertationes Epicteti : The works of the Stoic philosopher, Epictetus (around AD 55-135), are known to us only through the posthumous publication of some of them by other authors. Most important was the publication by Arrian of his teacher's lectures, the ÄiaTpißai ( Dissertationes Epicteti ), which are now in four books, though there may have been as many as eight or twelve originally. It is likely that Arrian simply edited the lectures, without adding any material of his own, and that they were published shortly after AD 130. They were certainly known to Aulus Gellius when he was in Athens between AD 160-164. Periplus Maris Euxini : Shortly after his appointment, in around AD 131, as governor of Cappadocia, Arrian undertook a visit of inspection. It was during this voyage, or shortly afterwards, that he composed this brief work. The influence of the style of Xenophon is noticeable. Athanasios, the saint, who was a theologian and Bishop of Alexandria, lived from around AD 295 to 373. Contra Gentes : an early tract, written about AD 318, attacking pagan mythology. Athenagoras of Athens was a Christian Apologist of the 2nd century AD. Legatio : This work, the Plea ox Embassy, was probably written between AD 176 and 178, and may have been delivered in person to Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. In this piece, Athenagoras attempts to defend the Christian faith, particularly against the charge of atheism, that is, the refusal of Christians to recognize the Roman gods and to take part in traditional rites. 2656 Reale (1974) 32.</page><page sequence="524">1 1 76 WRITTEN SOURCES Athenaios was born in Naucratis in Egypt, but he is known to have lived in Rome at the end of the 2nd and the beginning of the 3rd centuries AD. Deipnosophistae : The only extant work of Athenaios, ÀeiTrvoao(1H(jTaí, The Sophists at Dinner, was probably completed after AD 192 (the year of the death of Commodus, who is mentioned as a contemporary in XII.537F) and possibly after AD 228. Fifteen books survive, plus excerpts from some others. Using the symposium as a framework, the author wanders through many subjects, from literature to medicine. Michael Attaleiates, the historian, was born around AD 1020-1030 in either Attaleia or Constantinople and died after AD 1085. Historia : This work covers the period AD 1034-1079/1080. It is a rhetorical panegyric of Nikephoros III. Decimus Magnus Ausonius, the rhetor and poet, was born at Bordeaux in the early 4th century AD. He died around AD 395. Epigram 12: Written in dialogue form, this epigram describes two statues: Occasio and Metanoea, the first of which is attributed to Pheidias. Mosella : A poem in 483 hexameters, describing the fish in the river Moselle as well as the buildings and other interesting sights on the banks. The poem was probably completed by around AD 371. Basil, St. Basil, bishop of Caesarea in Cappodocia, and theologian. He was born around AD 330 and died in 379. De legendis gentilium libris : In this protreptic essay, Basil puts forward the view that not all Greek literature is devoid of value for Christians. The work probably dates from AD 375-380. Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus, the Roman politician and writer, lived from around AD 490 to around AD 583. Variae : This work, in twelve books, consists of the writer's official correspondence, with the imperial edicts that he had drawn up. Book VII. 15 is a formula to the Prefect of the City on the appointment of a public architect. Chorikios of Gaza was a Christian rhetorician of the 6th century AD. He was the pupil of Prokopios of Gaza. Of his works remain forty-six declamations. He is most well known for his defence of mime and theatre. Declamatio VIII: Probably written between about AD 520-540. According to Chorikios, the Lakedaimonians once suffered a terrible affliction: all the daughters born to them were exceedingly ugly. So they went to Delphi to seek advice from the oracle and they were told that Aphrodite was angry with them for some reason and would be appeased only if she was honoured with a statue. So the people commissioned a statue from Praxiteles. He made an image of his lover, the hetaira Phryne, which he labelled 'Aphrodite'. The people gathered to consider whether they should accept this work. Praxiteles urged them to accept it, but one Spartan argued against doing so. This declamatio supposedly presents his arguments. The episode is set a little later than the De Falsa Legatione of Demosthenes, dating from 343 BC. Corso, who discusses this work at length, argues that the statue in question really did exist and was probably the work mentioned by Pausanias, in III. 18.1,</page><page sequence="525">AUTHORS AND THEIR WORKS 1 1 77 which was on the Akropolis of Sparta, near the altar of the sanctuary of Athena Chalkioikos.2657 This was a statue of Aphrodite 'Turner away of old age' and it was set up by the Spartans following an oracle. The idea of writing a declamation on an Aphrodite modelled on Phryne, by Praxiteles, probably came from Libanios, who also wrote a declamation on hetairai and included his views on Phryne and the Delphic statue by Praxiteles. This declamation is the longest known source concerning Praxiteles, and the second longest known source on any ancient artist, after the speech on Pheidias's Zeus at Olympia by Dio Chrysostomos, in Oratio XII. Published for the first time in 1894, it appeared after Overbeck' s catalogue of sources and was therefore not included in this work.2658 Chronicon Paschale : An anonymous chronicle of the early 7th century AD. It was produced in Constantinople. The period covered by this work is from the time of the Creation to about AD 628, which is reckoned to be some 6,144 years. In the chronicle, biblical and secular events are interrelated, and history is interpreted in Christians terms. Much effort is put into working out the exact date of Easter, hence the name given to the work. Marcus Tullius Cicero, the politician, writer and leading figure of his day at the Roman Bar, lived from 106-43 BC. Académica Priora : Written in 45 BC, the work deals with the views of the Athenian 'new' Academy and in particular Carneades. Brutus'. Written early in 46 BC. A history of Roman oratory presented in dialogue form. De Finibus : Written in 45 BC, this work is on the different conceptions held by philosophers of what constitutes the chief good. De Natura Deorum : Dating from 45/44 BC, this work examines the different views about the nature of the gods held by various philosophical schools. De Oratore , II: A treatise on rhetoric in dialogue form, written by 55 BC. De Re Publica : Written between 54 BC and about 51 BC, concerning the ideal state. In C. Verrem Act. II: 70 BC. An oration in prosecution of Verres after his oppression and exploitation of Sicily while proconsul of the province in 73-71 BC. Orator ad M. Brutum : Written in 46 BC, in the form of a letter to M. Junius Brutus, Cicero here gives a picture of what he considers to be the perfect orator. Paradoxa Stoicorum : Published at the beginning of 46 BC, these six essays attempt to present in an acceptable way some of the most difficult and provocative doctrines of the Stoics. Tusculanae Disputationes : Written in 45 BC. This philosophical work deals with problems such as death, grief, passion and fear and the true causes of happiness. Clemens Alexandrinus, whose full name was Titus Flavius Clemens, was born around AD 150, probably in Athens, and died between AD 211 and 216. He was converted to Christianity and spent much of his life as a priest in Alexandria, where he succeeded Pantaenus as head of the Catechetical School. 2657 Corso (1991) 27-110. 2658 Overbeck (1868).</page><page sequence="526">1 1 78 WRITTEN SOURCES Protrepticus : This work is an appeal to readers to conversion and true religion. It was written between AD 200 and 203, when Septimius Severus was Emperor. In Book D Clemens deals with the impiety and absurdities of the pagan mysteries and myths. In book IV, Clemens seeks to show that the folly, the deceitfulness and the impudence of the Greek gods is apparent in their idols, the authorship of which is entirely human. Clemens Romānus, Pope Clemens I, the saint, is generally thought to have been the second or third successor of St. Peter in the see of Rome. Several surviving works are traditionally linked with this pope. Of these, the First Epistle to the Church at Corinth , written in around AD 95, is probably genuine, while all the others are thought to be spurious and to date from later periods. They include a Second Epistle to the Church at Corinth , the Apostolic Constitutions and Canons , two Syriac Epistles on Virginity , the Clementinae (the Recognitions and Homilies) and two epistles to James (the Epitome prior and altera , or Epitome de ges tis S. Petri). Epitome Altera and Epitome Prior. These are later than the Homiliae; they repeat some of the Homiliae and introduce an account of the martyrdom of Clement. Homiliae : These are twenty discourses which Clement is supposed to have sent from Rome to James of Jerusalem. They form a religious and philosophical romance, containing much legendary material, telling of the travels of the saint in the East, when he met St. Peter. They may have been written in the 4th century AD. Recognitions : Latin translation of Pseudo-Clemens, the Homilies and the Epitome prior and altera. Codex Vaticanus Graecus 989 : This Codex, dating from the 13th century AD, and copied most probably from an older document, gives a unique list of thirty wonders of the ancient world. Traditionally, the number of wonders was seven, and most lists include between six and eight wonders. Here, however, there are thirty pagan monuments: nos. 1-8 are constructions, nos. 9-13 are sculptures, nos. 14-28 are constructions, and nos. 29-30 are again sculptures. The most famous works are placed at the head of the list, numbers 1-13; the rest are less famous but deemed worthy of a mention. Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella, from Gades in Iberia, flourished around AD 50. De Re Rustica : This work was written around AD 60-65. It is an agricultural manual in twelve books, showing a very systematic approach and demonstrating Columella's great knowledge and experience in this domain. Book 1 : Introduction. Layout of a villa and organization of slaves. Book 2: Arable cultivation. Books 3-5: Viticulture and trees. Books 6-7: Animals. Books 8-9: The breeding of poultry, fish, game, bees. Book 10: Horticulture. Book 1 1 : Duties of the vilicus (slave estate-manager). Calendar of farm work and horticulture. Book 12: Duties of the vilica. Wine and oil processing. Food conservation. Damaskios was born in Damascus around AD 460 and died after AD 538. He studied and later taught rhetoric at Alexandria, before going to Athens to study under Marinos at the Athenian Academy. He eventually became the head of the Neoplatonic school. Vita Isidoři : A biography of the author's colleague, Isidoros. It survives in fragments in the Suda and in Photios. The passage quoted in this volume is drawn from the Suda , 1.13.</page><page sequence="527">AUTHORS AND THEIR WORKS 1 1 79 Demetrios, the writer of New Comedy, flourished in the later 4th century and early 3rd century BC. Demetrios. Very little is known about this writer, and his treatise on style, Fiepi ép|ir|veíaç. However, it is most probably not the case that this Demetrios is the same man as Demetrios of Phaleron (who was born around 350 BC), to whom the treatise on style is traditionally ascribed. The Demetrios in question probably lived in the late Hellenistic, or early Roman period, though much of his material comes from 4th century works. Demosthenes, one of the greatest Athenian orators, was born in 385/384 BC or 384/383 BC and died in 322 BC.2659 Contra Androtionem : The speech was written as Demosthenes began his public career, in about 356-355 BC. An old enemy Diodoros accuses Androtion of illegality. Contra Timocratem : Work written in early 353/352 BC, when Thoudemos was archon. The case represented another attack against Androtion. De Falsa Legatione: 'On the Embassy', or riepl rr'ç riapaTTpeaßeias, was delivered in the summer of 343 BC. In this speech Demosthenes prosecuted his political rival Aeschines for malversation which he claimed was committed by Aeschines as a member of the embassy sent to Macedonia in 346 BC. De republica ordinanda : A work probably not by Demosthenes, which borrows or parodies phrases from his speeches. Written after 351 BC. Olynthiaca III: The last in a series of three speeches Demosthenes wrote demanding Athenian support for Olynthos, which had recently been attacked by Philip, in 349 BC. Dio Chrysostomos, whose real name was Dio Cocceianos, but who later came to be called 'Chrysostomos,' lived from around AD 40 to after AD 112. He came from Prusa in Bithynia. He was perhaps the grand-father of Cassius Dio Cocceianos. Greek orator and popular philosopher of the Stoic-Cynic school, he wrote many speeches (some eighty in number) on a wide variety of themes. He was a friend of the emperor Trajan. Oratio XII: The 'Twelfth Discourse', sometimes known as the 'Olympic Discourse', was delivered at Olympia in AD 97. It deals with man's conception of god, which, according to Dio, is innate in all men and at the same time strengthened by men's experiences and observations. The views of poets, law-givers, artists - painters and sculptors - and philosophers, he says, all help to shape man's image of the divine. A great part of the discourse is taken up with a mock trial of Pheidias. He is accused of being presumptuous, on the grounds that he has limited men's concept of Zeus by creating an image of the god, at Olympia, which is seen by many people as the perfect encapsulation of their own religious beliefs. Pheidias's imagined response makes the following points: that men's views of the gods had already been fixed for us by the poets (§ 55-57); that he chose to represent the god in human form firstly because it expresses intelligence to us and secondly because it makes us respond with affection (§ 58-61); that Homer's Zeus was far more fully anthropomorphic than his own since he makes Zeus express a whole gamut of emotions, not all of them pleasant (§ 61-69); that sculpture is much more constrained as an art form than poetry (§ 70-72); that Homer's god is one of power and battle, whereas 2659 Davies (1971) 123-126.</page><page sequence="528">1 1 80 WRITTEN SOURCES Pheidias's god is, above all, a Father, who is kind and merciful (§ 73-79); that the greatest of all craftsmen is Zeus himself, who made the universe (§ 80-83). In the course of this speech, Pheidias stresses the fact that he based his vision on that of Homer, a theme which is taken up in many of the sources. However, unlike Homer's Zeus, who is often unkind, violent, or angry, Pheidias's Zeus is always gentle and merciful. One of the points Dio is making here is that, in his opinion, Pheidias created a worthier image of the god. Oratio LV: on Homer and Socrates, putting forward the view that Socrates acquired his art as a teacher from Homer. Cassius Dio Cocceianos : A close relative, perhaps a grandson of Dio Chrysostomos, who was born between about AD 155-164. Rhomaike historia : Originally in eighty books, and covering the period from the landing of Aeneas down to the year of Dio's second consulship (AD 229). Dio says (LXXII.23.5) that the work took twelve years to compose. It is probable that he collected the material for the history between AD 21 1-220 and that he then wrote it between AD 220-231, or a little later.2660 Diodorus Siculus, the historian, from Agyrium. He flourished under Caesar and Augustus, and lived until at least 21 BC. Bibliotheca Histórica : A world history, originally in forty books, written in the period 60-30 BC. The author's main source, particularly for books XI-XVI, was the 4th century BC writer, Ephoros. Diogenes Laertius. Very little is known about this author, who probably lived in the early 3rd century AD, judging from the internal evidence of the work ascribed to him. There is no mention of Neo-Platonism, which suggests that he was writing before the 4th century AD, and the latest philosopher mentioned in the work is an otherwise unknown character called Saturninus, a pupil of Sextus Empiricus (see Bk. IX. 11 6), who is supposed to have been active around the end of the 2nd century AD. Vitae Philosophorum : The Vitae philosophorum , or Bioi Kai yvo)|iai twv Lv (1hXo(jÓ(1&gt;oiç eú8oKi|ir|(jávTü)v, which is about the lives and opinions of some eminent philosophers, was probably written in Rome, in the period from Septimius to Alexander Severus.2661 Dionysios of Halicarnassus, the Rhetor and historian. Born around 60-55 BC, he lived and taught in Rome for many years, from around 30 BC. De Demosthenis dictione : One of a series of discussions on the orators. It was probably written in two parts, the second part, chapters 35 to the end, dating from much later than the first part.2662 In this passage, Dionysios is addressing the question of how one is to recognize the style of Demosthenes and distinguish it from that of others. He says that one must first learn to recognize its 'melody', é|i|iéXeia, and this takes long practice. 2660 Corso (1990) 39. 2661 Corso (1990) 37 and n. 1306. 2662 Concerning the date of the work, see Aujac (1978) 22-28.</page><page sequence="529">AUTHORS AND THEIR WORKS 1181 De Dinarcho : The subject of this work is the 4th century BC orator, Dinarchos, who modelled himself on Demosthenes. He was one of the least popular of the orators, but Dionysios was interested in him partly in order to establish which speeches attributed to Demosthenes should in fact have been ascribed to Dinarchos. De Isocrate : A discussion on the orator Isokrates. De Thucydide : A treatise on the style of Thucydides, which Dionysios condemns rather fiercely. The work was written at the request of Quintus Aelius Tubero, and it forced Dionysios to interrupt another piece, on Demosthenes, that he was working on at the time (perhaps his critical treatise, now lost; see Dionysios, Demosthenes , V.57.3). The De Thucydide was probably written around 15 BC. Epiktetos, the Stoic philosopher, lived around AD 55-135. His works are known to us mainly through the Dissertationes Epicteti of his pupil, Arrian. Epiphanios, of Eleutheropolis in Palestine, lived from around AD 315-403. He was a monk and he became bishop of Salamis in Cyprus in 367 AD. His dislike of Greek culture is evident in his writings. Panarion: The 'Medicine Chest' for curing eighty heresies, written in AD 375. Eunapios was a Greek sophist and fervent opponent of Christianity. He was born in Sardis in AD 346 and died in about AD 414. He wrote a history of the period AD 270-404, now almost completely lost, as well a work on the lives of the Sophists. Vitae Sophistarum : This work, written about AD 396, deals with the lives of Greek Sophists and philosophers - mainly 4th century Neoplatonists - and follows the model of Philostratos' Bioi sophiston , written in the early 3rd century AD. The passage quoted in this volume comes in the section about an otherwise unknown man, Akakios. Eusebios of Caesarea lived from about AD 260 to 340. He became bishop of Caesarea in around AD 314. He was well acquainted with Greek philosophy and thought. De Vita Constantini : This work was posthumously published. Eusebios died between AD 337 and 340, not long after Constantinos himself. The work is not a simple biography of the Emperor, but rather an encomium. Praeparatio evangelica : Probably started around AD 312, but not completed until a few years later, this work is a criticism of Greek philosophy, aiming to demonstrate that the best of Greek philosophy is in agreement with the teachings of the Bible, and partly derived from the Bible. Eustathios came from Constantinople and died around AD 1 194. He taught rhetoric until AD 1 174, when he became archbishop of Thessalonika. He was a prolific writer. Commentarii ad Homeri Iliadem et Odysseám Pertinentes: Eustathios wrote his commentaries probably around AD 1170. They are based on his lectures and deal with questions of language, mythology, history and geography. His vast work on the Iliad is twice the length of his commentary on the Odyssey. Eustratios was a philosopher and theologian from Nicaea. He was active around AD 1 100. He became metropolitan of Nicaea.

Marcus Cornelius Fronto, the orator, was born at Cirta (now Constantine) in Numidia in around AD 100 and he died in about AD 166. He became tutor to Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, after AD 138 when Marcus was adopted by Hadrian. None of the letters that have survived can be dated earlier than AD 139. Ad Verum I: Both the heading and title of this letter are lost, so its attribution is uncertain. Haines suggests that it could be a letter from Fronto to Marcus Antoninus, datable to around AD 162, but others assign it to Verus.2663 Epistula I : Written to Fronto by Marcus Aurelius in AD 143. Fronto became consul suffectus for July and August of that year under Pius. Marcus is referring to Fronto's speech of thanks to Pius in the Senate. Galen of Pergamon, the philosopher and physician, lived from AD 129 to perhaps AD 199. He became the court physician of Marcus Aurelius. De anatomicis administrationibus : A work on anatomy which made Galen very influential. De naturalibus facultatibus : One of Galen's great works, its subject is physiology. His thesis, the argument from design, is that the human body is so perfectly designed in all its parts, to fulfil each function, that any change must be for the worse. De usu partium : Galen wrote the work in two stages; he wrote Book I around AD 165 in Rome, at the suggestion of his friend and patron, Flavius Boethus, the ex-consul, while Books II-XVII were written between AD 169-175. The work deals primarily with anatomy and physiology, but many other subjects are dealt with too. It was never superseded in antiquity. Usus , in Greek xPe^a, means the suitability or aptness of a part for performing actions. Book 3 looks at the foot and the leg. Book 15 deals with the reproductive tract, the foetus and the hip-joint. Pro puero epileptico consilium : A work on epilepsy. Qoud optimus medicus sit quoque philosophus : Concerning the view that a good doctor should also have a strong philosophical training.

Annales : This chronicle, the Biblos Chronike , covers the period from the beginning of the world to the death of Alexios Komnenos in AD 1118. The Great Chronographer : An anonymous chronographer of the 8th century AD, known as 'o mégalos chronographos' when he is quoted in two places in the 10th century AD manuscript of the Chronicon Paschale. In the first case, there are fourteen extracts, which tell of natural disasters dating from the late 5th century to the mid 8th century. These are inserted in the account of the Nika Riot. In the second case, one extract is inserted in the account of Phocas's deposition of Maurice. It seems very likely that the Great Chronographer is one of the sources for the Chronographia of Theophanes and the Brevarium of N ikephoros . Gregoras Nikephoros was born in Herakleia Pontike around AD 1290/1292 or 1293/1294 and died in Constantinople between AD 1358 and 1361. He was one of the great scholars of his age, interested in many diverse subjects. Rhomaike Historia : A history in thirty-seven books, covering the period from AD 1204 to 1359.

He became bishop of Constantinople. Carmina Moralia: A collection of forty poems. Gregorios wrote much poetry, including 254 epigrams collected together as Book 8 of the Anthologia Palatina. In total, he wrote some 17,000 lines of verse, mostly when he was in retirement. His verses are not considered very inspired, but some show an interesting attempt to bring Christianity and traditional Greek culture together. De Theologia : A set of orations, written in the summer of AD 380, on the spiritual conditions for knowledge of God and on the Trinity. Heraklides, known as 'the critic', a travel writer of the mid 3rd century BC. Fragments of his work Concerning the cities in Hellas survive, and they give a vivid description of a journey through Greece.2664 Hermodoros, writer of Book 16, Planudes , epigram 170, was probably writing in the 2nd century BC. He may have come from Syria. Hesychios of Alexandria, a lexicographer, probably of the 5th century AD. Lexicon : The work was based on specialist léxica of Aristarchos, Heliodoros, Apion, Apollonios, Diogenianos, and Herodian. Unfortunately, it is preserved only in one 15th century manuscript, where the original text is clearly abridged and filled with interpolations. 2664 See Der kleine Pauly (1967), volume 2, 1042-43, no. 17.</page><page sequence="532">1 1 84 WRITTEN SOURCES Hesychios Illoustrios, a pagan historian of the 6th century AD, came from Miletos. He died after AD 582. Patria Konstantinoupoleos : This work consists of a revision of part of his history of the city of Byzantion up to the time of Constantine the Great. Historical facts and imaginative fancy are liberally mixed in this work. Eusebius Sophronius Hieronymus of Stridon, better known as St. Jerome, was a monk and Doctor of the Church. He was born in Stridon, near Aquileia, in Dalmatia around AD 341 and he died in AD 420. He was baptized some time before AD 366. He had an excellent knowledge of Classical culture and languages. He translated the Chronicle of Eusebios and a number of Origen' s homilies. His main work, however, was the production of a standard Latin text for the Bible.2665 Chronicorum Canonum Liber. This work consisted of a history of the world from the birth of Abraham to AD 325. It was written originally by Eusebios of Caesarea (around AD 260-339 or AD 340); using Sextus Julius Africanus as his main source, Eusebios gave lists of the rulers of the Chaldeans, Assyrians, Hebrews, Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, and included brief mentions of important historical events, many biblical and some non- biblical. Eusebios was very interested in clarifying the chronology of events, showing what was happening at the same date in different parts of the world. The work was then expanded by Hieronymus, who produced a Latin paraphrase of it. Commentaria in Zachariam Prophetam : One of numerous commentaries Hieronymus wrote on particular books in the Bible, including the Prophets and the Epistles. Himerios of Prusias in Bithynia (around AD 310-390). He was a rhetorician and an important exponent of the pagan renaissance. The extant speeches seem to date from quite early in his career. Out of a total of eighty speeches, twenty-four survive, as well as excerpts from ten more. The speeches include a funerary oration on Himerios's son; six declamations on themes from Athenian history; inaugural lectures; ceremonial orations; and addresses to high Roman officials.2666 Oratio 24: Written for his friend Seberos. Oratio 28: Written for his companion Athenaios. Oratio 32: Part of the exordium of the speech to the prefect Anatolius. This speech is known through Photios, Bibl. 243, through the Codex Neapolitanus II C 222667 and in the glosses of the Lexicon Vindobonense of André Lopaiotès (14th century). Oratio 64: An extemporary speech delivered in his lecture room. Probably written around AD 350, in the early years of his teaching, and in Athens, where Himerios had a school of rhetoric. Oratio 68: On the subject of pursuing variety in speech. Hyginus. Nothing is known of this writer. He cannot be identified with Augustus's librarian of the Palatine library or with the grammarian of Trajan's time. 2665 See Pauly's Kleine Encyclopädie , VIII. 2 (1913) 1565, no. 16, concerning his life. 2666 Concerning Himerios, see Kennedy (1983). 2667 Schenkl (1911) 414.</page><page sequence="533">AUTHORS AND THEIR WORKS 1 1 85 Fabulae: Title given in the editio princeps of Micyllus (Basle, 1535), to a handbook of mythology, Genealogiae , compiled from Greek sources probably in the 2nd century AD. Isokrates, the Athenian orator, 436-338 BC. Antidosis : Speech written in 354/353 BC.

No date can be ascribed to it on the basis of its contents. Letter to the Senate and the People of Athens : Written in Illyricum in AD 361, when Julian was on the march against Constantius. The letter defends Julian's acceptance of the title of Emperor and his break with Constantius. Misopogon : Written around AD 362. The letter is addressed to the people of Antioch, whom Julian found most irreverent and frivolous when he stayed in Antioch during the winter of AD 361/362, on his way to Persia. Oratio II: This is a panegyric in honour of the Emperor Constantius, written while Julian, already elevated to Caesar, was campaigning in Gaul. Oratio III: The speech was written in honour of the Empress Eusebia, the first wife of Constantine. It was probably composed either in Gaul, or shortly before Julian's expedition to Gaul. Juvenal, Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis, the satiric poet, was born around AD 50-65 in Aquinum. He was still writing in AD 127, and the date of his death can be put around AD 130, though it is not known for certain. Satur ae, 8 : Juvenal wrote five books of satires and they contain sixteen poems in all. The eighth poem dates from around AD 120. It deals with the idea that virtue is more important than family connections if one is seeking advancement. Kallimachos, the famous Hellenistic poet from Cyrene, lived from around 305 BC to around 240 BC. He spent most of his life in Alexandria.</page><page sequence="534">1 1 86 WRITTEN SOURCES Iambi VI : In this poem, addressed to a friend about to set sail for Elis to see the statue of Zeus by Pheidias, Kallimachos described the statue in some detail. He gave the dimensions of the throne, the footstool, and the seated figure as well as the total cost of the work. Unfortunately most of the lines are fragmentary or lost, but a few important facts may still be gleaned. Kallisthenes of Olynthos, nephew of Aristotle and official historian of Alexander's expedition. He was executed in 327 BC, after being implicated in the Pages' conspiracy. His works survive only in fragments. Georgios Kedrenos, who was almost certainly a religious, lived in the late 1 1th and early 12th centuries AD. Compendium Historiarum : Georgios Kedrenos wrote his Compendium Historiarum in the late 11th century, probably in Constantinople.

It is heavily based on the works of pseudo-Symeon Maģistros, Theophanes, George Hamartolos, Constantine of Rhodes and Skylitzes. Konstantīnos Manasses was born in Constantinople in around AD 1 130. He was a writer at the courts of Sebastos Kratorissa, Irene Komnene and Manuel I. He eventually became Metropolitan of Naupaktos. He died in around AD 1 187.2668 Descriptio Imaginum : This work on figurative art was written in the mid 12th century AD. The passage quoted comes from a part of the work in which the author is praising the figurative arts and pointing out their potential both for creating beauty and for imparting fame to artists. Konstantīnos Rhodios, a poet from Lindos in Rhodes was born around AD 870-880 and died after AD 93 1 . Ekphrasis : This poem consisted of two sections: descriptions first of the seven wonders of Constantinople and then of the Church of the Holy Apostles. It is addressed to the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenete, but its date cannot be given more precisely than within the rule of this Emperor, that is AD 912-959. Kedrenos, writing about a century later, drew heavily on Konstantinos, though probably not directly. Laterculi Alexandrini : Written probably in the mid 2nd century BC, they consist of compilations of curiosities from the Greek world, of a historical or mythological nature. Leonidas of Tarentum, the greatest of the Greek epigrammatists of the Alexandrian age. He lived in the earlier 3rd century BC.

Livy, Titus Livius, the Roman historian from Patavium (Padua), lived from 64 or 59 BC to AD 12 or 17. Ab urbe condita : A history of Rome, from its origins. The work was composed in 142 books, of which 35 remain extant (I-X, XXI-XLV), in addition to some fragments of other books. Books XXXI-XLV deal with the Macedonian and Syrian Wars. Much of the extant work seems to date from late in the 1st century BC. Lucian of Samosata was born around AD 120 and died after AD 180. He is famous for developing the Satiric Dialogue form. De morte Peregrini , Ylepì rf's Flepeypivou TeXeirrfjç: Written soon after AD 165, when Peregrinus, the Cynic philosopher, cremated himself at Olympia after the Games. Lucian apparently witnessed the events about which he is writing. De parasito , riepì riapacriTot; otl Têxtil ^ riapaaiTiKiļ: A work written in Lucian's old age, demonstrating, in ironical manner, that the highest form of art is that of parasitism. De Sacrificiis , Ilept Gixjiwv: Written around AD 165. Lucian's theme is the stupidity of much religious practice and the low view of the gods which it implies; the gods are assumed to enjoy being flattered by men. De Saltatione , riepi'OpxTlcrews: An encomiastic treatise, written in dialogue form. It was probably written at Antioch in AD 162-165. Lykinos convinces the Cynic Crato of the artistic value of pantomimic dance. Along with Imagines and Pro Imaginibus , which are in praise of Panthea, the mistress of the Emperor Verus, this dialogue is a compliment to the Emperor, who was very keen on dancers. Lykinos appears as the main character in several of the dialogues (for instance Imagines , Pro Imaginibus , and Amores) and he is clearly Lucian's mouthpiece. Gallus, "Oveipoç f' ' AXeKTpuwv: A Cynic sermon in praise of poverty, written in dialogue form, the speakers being Micyllus, the cobbler, and his cock, who is the reincarnation of Pythagoras. It was probably written between AD 160-165. Hermotimos,' Ep|iÓTip.oç Tļ riepi Alpéaewv: This is Lucian's longest work and it attacks the philosophical schools. Hermotimos is a pupil of the Stoic school and he is made to see, after enduring a Socratic style interrogation, that the Sceptic is right in saying that the best way of living life is to be an ordinary man. In section 13, Lucian says he is aged 40 at the time of composition. Icaromenippos, ' Impose v itt-ttos f| f YTTepvéc1&gt;€Xoç: Menippos tells a friend how he flew up to Heaven, and saw that everything there was just as the poets had described. The work is a satire directed against both philosophical views and the beliefs of ordinary people about the gods, as expressed in poetry. Imagines , Eikóveç: Probably composed in AD 162-163, this dialogue pays an elaborate compliment to Panthea, the courtesan from Smyrna who was the favourite of the Emperor Lucius Verus. By praising Panthea's physical and mental qualities through comparison with masterpieces of the visual and then the literary arts, Lucian, in the guise of Lykinos,</page><page sequence="536">1 1 88 WRITTEN SOURCES succeeds in flattering not only the woman and so, indirectly, the Emperor, but also the reader who is cultured enough to appreciate the allusions made. Juppiter Tragoedus,Zevç Tpaywôós: Probably written around AD 165. The theme of this dialogue elaborates that of Zeus Elenchomenos, in which the raison d'être of the gods is questioned by a Cynic. Zeus calls a council of the gods, because he fears that the Epicurean Damis will convince people that the gods do not exist. Pro Imaginibus,' Ytt€P twv Elkovwv : Written around AD 163-164, in answer to Panthea's objections to the praise lavished upon her by Lucian in Imagines. Here Lucian defends what he wrote and at the same time pays Panthea even greater compliments. Quomodo Historia conscribenda sit, îlwç Sel 'IcFTOpiav auy y pachivi Written during the Parthian War of AD 162-165, this piece criticizes all those third-rate historians who rushed to report the campaigns. Rhetorum Praeceptor,fPr'TÓç)(i)v ÀiSdaKaXoç: A satire on the new fashion in oratory to entertain the audience with oratorical display. If Lucian's butt was his contemporary Pollux, the lexicographer, then the piece must date from after AD 179, when Pollux became professor. Somnium, Flepi to£&gt; 'Evirnriou fļToi Bíoç AouKiavoö: This work was probably written around AD 160, when Lucian first returned to his native Syria, after his stay in Gaul which brought him fame and success. He recounts the dream he had as a youth when trying to decide which path to take in life. He dreamt that two women, 'Hermogluptike Techne', the Art of Sculpture, and 'Paideia', Education, each tried to drag him towards her to make him her own. Timori'. A satirical portrait of Timon of Athens, which renders him unrecognizable. Timon was known as a misanthropist. According to Lucian he became so through the ingratitude of his friends who used his money and then forgot about him. Here, Timon finds buried treasure and gets his revenge on everyone. Lucretius, the poet and philosopher, probably died in 53 BC. De rerum natura : a didactic poem about Epicureanism, in six books: (1) Atoms and void. (2) The characteristics of atoms. (3) The mortality of the soul. (4) Thought and sensation. (5) The history of the world and its mortality. (6) Phenomena of the heavens and the earth. Lykourgos, the orator, was born in 384/383 BC and died in 324 BC. Kata Kephisodotou : This speech survives only in fragments. Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius was probably writing in the early 5th century AD. He may have been of African origin. Saturnalia : A symposium in seven books, composed for the education as a gentleman of Macrobius's son. It includes discussions of many varied topics but the central subject, which occupies books 3-6, is a critical appreciation of Virgil. Ioannes Malaias, the rhetor, lived around AD 490-570. He was educated at Antioch but later lived in Constantinople, where he was a loyal supporter of Justinian. Chronographia : This work, in eighteen books, covered the period from the time of Adam to at least AD 565, that is, the end of the reign of Justinian. Most of it was written in Antioch in AD 530-540, but it was later updated and enlarged a short time after AD 565.</page><page sequence="537">AUTHORS AND THEIR WORKS 1 1 89 Marinos was a Neoplatonist philosopher of the later 5th and early 6th centuries AD.

Of his works, forty-one lectures, ÀiaXeÇeiç, survive. These were delivered in Rome, probably during the reign of Commodus (AD 180-192). Quoting mostly from Homer and Plato, these lectures consist of exhortations to virtue. Their philosophical content is drawn from Cynicism and Platonism. Dialexis 2: In this discourse, Maximus considers the question of whether images should be dedicated to the gods. Dialexis 3: Whether Socrates did well in not defending himself before his judges. Dialexis 8: The nature of the daimon of Socrates. Dialexis 15: Maximus argues that the practical life is of more worth than the theoretical life. Dialexis 17: The theme announced in the title of this discourse is whether Plato was right in expelling Homer from his Republic. Maximus takes the view that one can both honour the works of Plato and admire those of Homer; while pleasure is one element in response to Homer's verses it is by no means the only one. Dialexis 25: The title of this discourse, which only partially fits the contents, is that those discourses are the best which correspond to works (oti oí aú[i(1)ü)voi toîç êpyoiç Xóyoi ápKJToi). An idea which Maximus repeats quite often, in this discourse and others, is that pleasure alone is not a worthy end, but if it accompanies virtue then so much the better. Dialexis 27: On the question whether virtue is an art. Pomponius Mela came from Tingentera, near Gibraltar and lived in the reign of Gaius and perhaps Claudius. He wrote on geography. De Chorographica : A geographical survey of the inhabited world, written in the 1st century AD, under Gaius or early in the reign of Claudius. Much of it was 'borrowed' by Soliņus. Menandros Rhetor was from Laodicea in Phrygia, and he lived in the 3rd or 4th century AD. He was an orator and a teacher of oratory, who greatly influenced Byzantine authors of all periods. He was regarded as the main authority on epideictic oratory - the rhetorical celebration of public and private events. nepi'EmôeiKTiKwv: Menandros is traditionally named as the author of two treatises on the subject of epideictic oratory. However, evidence from the texts suggests that the two treatises are incomplete, that they are not parts of a single work, and that they are probably</page><page sequence="538">1 1 90 WRITTEN SOURCES by two different authors. Both works can be dated with a fair degree of certainty to the period of the reign of Diocletian (AD 245-313). The author of the second treatise was writing from Athens, for a pupil from Alexandria Troas (see section 445). Ianuarius Nepotianus, probably alive in the 5th century AD, wrote an epitome of the work of Valerius Maximus, up to and including the beginning of Book 3.

While still a young man, Synesios was afflicted by hair loss, and in this piece he humorously expresses his reasons for viewing this as a privilege rather than a misfortune. George the Synkellos, the monk, lived in the time of Tarasios, Patriarch of Constantinople (AD 784-806). He spent much time in Palestine, and he may well have been a monk at the monastery of St. Chariton, at the Old Lavra.

It was in these early years that he wrote paraphrases of many of Aristotle's works, with explanatory comments. Oratio 21: On how to recognize a true philosopher. The speech was delivered in AD 355/356. Oratio 25: This little speech was delivered probably in AD 373, when Themistios had been asked by the Emperor Valens to speak that same day, without preparation. In the speech he excuses himself, saying that he is following the example of great sculptors who never attempted any work without due thought and care. Oratio 27: This speech was delivered in Paphlagonia in AD 355. It is an elegant speech written in the form of a letter to a young student, stating the case that it is not where you learn but from whom you learn that matters. Themistios himself was taught the art of oratory in a very obscure place. Oratio 34: The speech was written in answer to the accusations made against Themistios by Palladios in an epigram (. Anth .

He speaks of the ruined architecture with great admiration, admitting that the achievements of the Greeks of pagan antiquity put to shame his own wretched age. Mango recognizes the significance of the letter as evidence of a growing awareness of Byzantine culture as a separate entity from ancient Greek culture: "To make pagan antiquity appear as a distinct epoch to be viewed from a distance, a violent jolt was needed. It was never achieved in Byzantine times, though Theodore's letter shows signs that it could have been."2677 Theodoros Skutariotes, an author of the later 13th century AD. Synopsis Chronike : A history of the world to the time of Theodoros. Theokritos, who lived around 300-260 BC, came from Syracuse. He was one of the greatest Greek pastoral poets.

Epistle 21 : Tzetzes excuses himself for passing off some of his own writing as that of his brother Isaak. Epistle 42 : Written probably in Constantinople some time after the death of the Emperor Ioannus II Comnenus in AD 1143.
