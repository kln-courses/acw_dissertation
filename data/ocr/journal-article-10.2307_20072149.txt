Ambiguity often presents itself in all aspects of the human condition and is culturally celebrated as the negotiation of a multiplicity of diverse and shifting classificatory schema.2 In this paper I will suggest that the magico-seductive prowess ascribed by many Kelantanese (Thais, Chinese, and Malays) to the actor-dancers of the indigenous nuuraa theatre acquires ritual meaning when viewed as the mediation of complementary binary distinctions that Kelantanese Thais employ in structuring and animating their perceptions of social and cosmic reality.3 The nuuraa actor, like the various Malay spirit beings discussed in Kirk lrThis paper is based on an earlier academic exercise entitled "Sacred Steps: The Nuuraa as a Magical Practitioner in the Kelantanese Thai Culture Region", submitted as an Honours thesis in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Southeast Asian Studies, National University of Singapore (1995/96). Fieldwork for the present paper was conducted during trips to Kelantan, Malaysia in 1995 and again in 1997. I wish to thank all those who have made this exercise a success. Special thanks go to all my Kelantanese friends and relatives, with whom I spent many enjoyable hours discussing the ritual and performative aspects of the nuuraa, especially to Lung Phud, Lung Chom, Lung Thid, Phra Phiang, Thankhru Iak and Than Thiang. I also wish to extend my gratitude to Dr. John Miksic and Dr. Ananda Rajah of the National University of Singapore and Professor Michael Herzfeld of Harvard University for their expert advice and time. All Thai words appearing in this paper are in the Tumpat-Taak Bai dialect of Southern Thai spoken by most Thais in Kelantan and lower Narathiwat. My orthography of Tumpat-Taak Bai words follows the phonetic system used by Mohamed Yusoff Ismail in his book Buddhism and Ethnicity: Social Organisation of a Buddhist Temple in Kelantan (Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 1993). Place names in Thailand are spelt as they appear in most official Thai maps. Malay words are spelt according to the standard Malay spelling system. I make the distinction between the theatrical genre and the actor by using a capital letter to refer to the latter; pronunciation of both terms remains similar. Actor-dancers are identified by the honorific title of Nuuraa preceding their personal names. In order to protect my informants' privacy I have substituted pseudonyms in place of real names. 2James Fernandez has rightly pointed out that ambiguity and disorder are an integral part of social life in all cultures. He notes that "whatever set and scenario we construct on the main floor of our experience, there remain at the bottom of the stairs such dilemmas and ambiguities of social and personal life, such shapeshifting, as to offer no permanent resolution good for all seasons" (James Fernandez, "The Dark at the Bottom of the Stairs: The Inchoate in Symbolic Inquiry and Some Strategies for Coping with It", in On Symbols in Anthropology: Essays in Honor of Harry Hoijer, 1980, ed. Jacques Maquet [Malibu: Undena Publications, 1982], p. 24). 3The appeal of the dualistic mode of classification, which David Maybury-Lewis and Uri Almagor have aptly termed "the attraction of opposites", has merited the close scrutiny of numerous Western scholars ranging from the structural-functionalism of Durkheim's "elementary" forms of social life to L?vi-Strauss' reading of kinship and the nature of human thought. See David Maybury-Lewis and Uri Almagor, The Attraction of Opposites: Thought and Society in the Dualistic Mode (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1989). 286</page><page sequence="2">The Nuuraa Performer's Ritual Persona Kelantanese Thai Society 287 Endicott's work on Malay supernaturalism, symbolically breaches the boundaries of cultural categories.4 Mary Douglas' well-read thesis spoke of how dangerous (and often negative) power accrues to ambiguous individuals who situated themselves in the "inarticulate area, margins, confused lines, and beyond the external boundaries", in short, the unstructured and anomalous regions between implicitly contrastive classificatory systems.5 Her remark is applicable in understanding the ritual power Kelantanese Thais ascribe to the Nuuraa. Theoretically Nuuraa are ambiguous persons who occupy important social and ritual positions in rural Kelantanese Thai social structure. Unlike other persons, the Nuuraa mediates between visible humans and their formless ancestral spirits, between a familiar and cultured humanity and a distant unpredictable animal world, and between gendered masculinity and femininity. His transgression of these symbolic dichotomies commences with his formal theatrical apprenticeship as an adolescent female impersonator. Subsequent initiation into the nuuraa dramaturgical establishment situates the actor within a hierarchy of ancestral figures from which the corpus of power-laden oral spells used in the catalyzing of love magic are believed to derive. So widespread is the general belief in the nuuraa^ lascivious nature that it has become ingrained in the "collective fantasy" of most rural Kelantanese.6 Juxtaposed "betwixt and between" a multiplicity of symbols in the Kelantanese Thai classificatory system, the Nuuraa can theoretically be considered a liminal figure. Victor Turner popularized the study of liminality, adopting the concept from Arnold Van Gennep's earlier analysis of life cycle rituals.7 Van Gennep proposed the Latin term limen (lit. threshold) in reference to the intermediate state in rites of passage that lay between the neophyte's separation from, and his reaggregation into, society. Like his respected pre decessor, Turner reinforced the processual view of liminality as an intermediate stage within a dynamically transformative ritual structure. This temporal definition of the ritual process with its tripartite division of separation, liminality and reaggregation, holds true when considered in the light of certain nuuraa ceremonies such as initiations. Nuuraa actors may also be considered liminal persons, though their liminal status is spatially institution alized. Nuuraa do not re-emerge from their liminal status as does a neophyte in rites de passage-, their symbolic significance and power affiliations accrue from their constant maintenance of zones of uncertainty in the social and ritual order. Thus, echoing Turner, the Nuuraa's unsurpassed magico-erotic potential stems from their liminal and ambiguous qualities. I conclude my analysis with a short observation of the Nuuraa love magician in the context of contemporary Kelantan where all forms of indigenous theatre seem to be on the losing end of the battle with cosmopolitan-type entertainments (cinema, television, videos, radio, etc.) at securing audiences. This is occurring in the midst of an antagonistic political environment that officially chastizes displays of "un-Islamic" art forms in efforts at the creation of an Islamic state within a secularized Malaysian nation-state. 4Kirk Endicott, An Analysis of Malay Magic (Singapore: Oxford University Press, 1991). 5Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger: An Analysis of the Concepts of Pollution and Taboo (London and New York: Routledge, 1966), p. 99. 6Louis Golomb, Brokers of Morality: Thai Ethnic Adaptation in a Rural Malaysian Setting (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1978), p. 59. 7 Victor Turner, The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1969), p. 95, and Arnold Van Gennep, The Rites of Passage (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1960).</page><page sequence="3">288 Irving Chan Johnson The Historical and Ritual Context of the Kelantanese Nuuraa Kelantan is the northernmost state on the East Coast of peninsular Malaysia. Directly across the Golok River to the north lies the Thai province of Narathiwat. Having been neglected for the most part of its modern history by both British Malaya's colonial interests and the contemporary Malaysian nation-state, Kelantan can be considered a social and economic backwater. Unlike the states on the West Coast of the peninsula, where the tin and rubber industries of the nineteenth and early twentieth century spawned the development of large urban centres which attracted a substantial number of Chinese and Tamil immigrants, over 90 per cent of Kelantan's population is Malay and Muslim. Most Kelantanese Malays are rural dwellers who are engaged in an intensive paddy economy oriented towards subsistence and market consumption.8 A minority Chinese population of mostly Hokkien speakers is found in the state capital of Kota Baru and in smaller towns and villages.9 Other ethnic minority groups in Kelantan include Indians (Tamils, Sikhs, etc.) and Thais. Tai-speaking Theravada Buddhists totalled 8301 individuals or 0.7 per cent of Kelantan's total population in 1991.10 Twelve of the nineteen Thai villages (Thai baan) are located in the administrative district (Malay jajahan) of Tumpat near the Thai-Malaysian border.11 The Thai community's rural economy resembles that of their Malay neighbours, revolving around the agricultural production of wet rice, tobacco, and vegetables in smallholdings. In addition, some villagers also raise animals (cows, chickens and pigs) for sale to Malay and Chinese buyers.12 Thais attempt to avoid slaughtering the animals themselves because of the Buddhist abhorrence of killing. Many Thai settlements in Kelantan today are characterized by the outmigration of economically active men lured by employment opportunities in the construction and shipyard industries of Kuala Lumpur 8In addition to wet rice, many Malay farmers also cultivate dry vegetables (e.g. beans, eggplant, ginger, turmeric, etc.), fruit, rubber, and tobacco. Most rural Malays also practise some form of animal husbandry. In addition, inshore fishing and the processing of fish products (e.g., sun-dried salted fish, fish crackers and fermented anchovy sauce) are important sources of revenue for coastal Malay communities. 9Yusoff, Buddhism and Ethnicity, p. 21, notes that Hokkien speakers accounted for 59.6 per cent of the total Chinese population in Kelantan in 1980. Other Chinese dialect groups include Cantonese, Hakkas, and Teochews. Most rural Chinese are more culturally akin to their Thai and Malay neighbours than to the mainstream Chinese culture of the cosmopolitan states on the West Coast, possibly as a result of a long period of historical contact between these communities. Urban Chinese in Kelantan are largely descendants of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century immigrants and identify themselves with the larger Malaysian Chinese community. For an in-depth study of rural Chinese society in Kelantan see Roger Kershaw, "Towards a Theory of Peranakan Chinese Identity in an Outpost of Thai Buddhism", Journal of the Siam Society 69 (1981): 74-106. 10Kelantan's total population in the same year was recorded as 1,181,680 (Population and Housing Census Malaysia 1991). 11 Other Thai villages are situated in the jajahan of Pasir Mas (Baang Saet), Pasir Puteh (Baan Soemoerak), Tanah Merah (Baan Thaa Saung), Bachok (Baan Balaj) and Kota Baru (Baan Sidang/ Aaree). Possibly the southernmost extension of Kelantanese Thai ethnic and cultural identity is represented by a few small Thai villages in nearby Trengganu (Baan Moering, Baan Pok Kiang, Baan Jong). 12Goats, sheep, and water buffaloes are usually raised by Malays. During my stay in Kelantan, I came across only one Thai household that raised sheep. See Golomb, Brokers of Morality, pp. 175-80, for a discussion of the reasons why Thais in his village did not have water buffaloes.</page><page sequence="4">The Nuuraa Performer's Ritual Persona Kelantanese Thai Society 289 and Singapore. Thai government land settlement schemes (Th. nikhom) in the provincial subdivisions (Th. amphoe) of southern Narathiwat have also attracted a small number of Kelantanese Thai households.13 Mohamed Yusoff Ismail estimated that Thais have been living in Kelantan for at least a century.14 It is probable that the populating of the fertile Kelantan plains with Tai speakers occurred gradually and in conjunction with culturally and linguistically similar areas in Narathiwat. The international border separating the district of Taak Bai in Narathiwat from Kelantan was drawn in 1909 to demarcate British Malaya from an independent Siam. Despite identifying themselves as Malaysian citizens (Th. khon myang malaysia) and Kelantanese (Th. khon myang lantan), Kelantanese Thais maintain a close social relationship with their culturally identical counterparts across the border. Temple celebrations, pilgrimages, and the large weekend market in Taak Bai are popular informal settings where people meet and renew kin ties. A shared cultural, ethnic and historical consciousness unites these communities, although current political allegiances may vary. Living among Malay neighbours for a long period of time has caused Kelantanese Thai culture to show strong traces of Malay cultural borrowings and vice versa. For example, the Tumpat-Taak Bai patois spoken in all but three Kelantanese Thai villages includes many loan words from the Kelantan-Pattani dialect of Malay.15 The latter also incorporates certain Thai terms into its stock vocabulary.16 Kelantanese Thai and Malay theatre exhibit many parallels in presentation and narrative structure, music and ritual significance. It is not uncommon for audiences and sometimes the performers and musicians themselves to come from both ethnic groups. Nowhere is this dynamic cultural syncretism more obvious than in the Kelantanese Thai dramatic form called the nuuraa. The nuuraa is performed in Kelantan and in the southern Thai provinces of Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat. The genre has much in common with the maanohraa theatre thriving in Thailand's southern peninsula, stretching from Nakhon Si Thammarat to the northwestern Malaysian states of Kedah and Perlis. According to my Nuuraa informants, the term nuuraa apparently derived from a southern Thai abbreviation of Maanohraa (Sanskrit Manohara), the name of the heavenly bird-maiden (Th. kinnaarii) heroine in the Thai adaptation of the Sudhana-Manohara, a popular Sanskrit narrative. Relating Prince Sudhana's tireless quest for his love, the Sudhana-Manohara forms part of the 13A common grievance I heard from Kelantanese Thais who had visited nikhom communes was the poor accessibility of the villages. During my stay in Kelantan in 1995, I had planned to visit one such settlement. Unfortunately, the rains the night before had made the dirt track leading to the village impassable even to motorcycles. Villagers often complain of banditry in the areas. For a fuller description of nikhom projects see Golomb, Brokers of Morality, pp. 21-23; and Yusoff, Buddhism and Ethnicity, pp. 30-31. 14Ibid., p. 19. 15The latter three settlements of Baan Balaj, Baan Soemoerak and Baan Thaa Saung speak a second dialect that possibly reflects a different origin of these communities somewhere in Thailand. See Roger Kershaw, "The Thais of Kelantan: A Socio-Political Study of an Ethnic Outpost" (Ph.D. diss., University of London, 1969). Constant interaction between these communities and Tumpat Taak Bai speakers, however, has produced what Golomb {Brokers of Morality, p. 12) has called a "lexical convergence" in both communities. 16On the incorporation of Thai vocabulary in Kelantan-Pattani Malay, see Mohamed Yusoff Ismail, "Kata-Kata Pinjaman Thai dalam Dialek Kelantan", in Warisan Kelantan VIII (Kuala Lumpur: United Selangor Press, 1989), pp. 42-50.</page><page sequence="5">290 Irving Chan Johnson Pannasa Jataka, a compilation of fifty Buddhist birth-stories.17 Although it comprises one of the twelve tales (Th. sib saung baut) that make up the nuuraa's classical reper toire, the story of the bird-maiden is rarely, if ever, performed in the nuuraa, and it is not associated with the genre's creation story.18 The origin myths of both the southern Thai maanohraa and the Kelantanese nuuraa share a common thematic motif that surrounds the exploits of a virgin princess who was magically impregnated after consuming an enchanted lotus. The princess' father, enraged that his daughter could not identify the father of the child growing in her womb, banished her from the kingdom. She was set afloat on a raft, which eventually landed on a previously uninhabited island where she soon gave birth to a son.19 In a dream a deity (Th. theewaadaa) revealed the twelve dance steps (Th. thaa sib saung) of the drama to the princess (in some versions, it was her son who received the divine revelation).20 Mother and son practised and soon perfected the dance to the natural rhythm of waves crashing against the shore and the trickling of water splashing against pebbles. News of the intriguing dance soon reached the king, who invited the pair to perform in his palace. As a gift for an excellent performance, the beguiled king bestowed upon them his royal crown (Th. soed). Subsequently, the nuuraa's regalia and musical instruments were fashioned, giving rise to the first nuuraa troupe.21 17For an English translation of the Thai interpretation of the Pannasa Jataka, see Dorothy Fickle, "An Historical and Structural Study of the Pannasa Jataka" (Ph.D. diss., University of Pennsylvania, 1978). Besides Southeast Asia, stories of bird maidens have been documented in the literatures of China, Japan, Korea, Persia, Scandinavian and, Greenland, as well as certain native populations in North and South America; see Arthur Thomas Hatto, "The Swan Maiden: A Folk-Tale of North Eurasian Origin?", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 24 (1961): 326-52. The Sudhana-Manohara story has been the inspiration for many Southeast Asian aesthetic forms. For explorations of the narrative as it occurs on Borobudur reliefs in Java, see Padmanabh Jaini, "The Story of Sudhana-Manohara: An Analysis of the Texts and the Borobudur Reliefs", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 29 (1966): 533-58; and John Miksic, Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas (Jakarta: Periplus Editions, 1996), pp. 77-81. 18The twelve stories include Jaw Keet, Naang Taeng Aun, Chaalawan (Jaw Kraj), Eh Wong, Daaraawong, Sinlaawong, Wang Hong Naa, Suwanahong, Naang Nuuraa, Khubot, Khuhon and Chantakurop. 19The island, Ko Sichang or Ko Kachang, is believed by the various Kelantanese nuuraa I visited to be geographically situated in the Gulf of Siam. Preecha Nunsuk, Nora (Bangkok: Khurusapha Lardphrao, 1994), p. 8, locates the island in the Songkhla lake. 20The number twelve figures prominently in northern Malay and southern Thai numerology. Like the nuuraa, the Kelantanese Malay makyong drama is also comprised of a literary repertoire of twelve stories. See Ghulam Sarwar Yousof, Panggung Semar: Aspects of Traditional Malay Theatre (Petaling Jaya: Tempo Publishing, 1976), p. 84. In David Bank's Trance and Dance in Malaya: The Hindu-Buddhist Complex in Northwest Malay Folk Religion (Buffalo, NY: State University of New York at Buffalo, 1976), p. 11, he observes that Kedah Malay magical practitioners have a corpus of twelve oral texts. Ritual fees (M. pengkeras) paid for Pattani Malay magic contain the number twelve (e.g. 12, 112, 120, etc.); see Louis Golomb, An Anthropology of Curing in Multi Ethnic Thailand (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1985), p. 78. 21 For variations on this myth see, Phinyo Jittham, Nora (Songkhla: Songkhla Teacher's Training College, 1965); Wichien Na Nakhorn, "Tamnaan lae Khwaam Pen Maa Khong Nohra rue Nora", in Phum Thewa (Bangkok: Office of National Culture, 1980), pp. 73-99; Omar Farouk Bajunid, Warisan Kesenian Kelantan (Kuala Lumpur: Hakcipta Asrama Za'ba, 1989); Pin a/1 Endin Klap, "Sejarah Menora", Proceedings of the International Seminar on Southeast Asian Performing Arts (Penang: Universiti Sains Malaya, 1992), pp. 1-2; Yousof, Panggung Semar, Chantas Thongchuai,</page><page sequence="6">The Nuuraa Performer's Ritual Persona Kelantanese Thai Society 291 The earliest documentary evidence for the Kelantanese Thai nuuraa can be traced to the Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah, a travelogue of the nineteenth-century Malay scholar Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir Munshi. During his travels in Kelantan, Abdullah wrote of the audience he was granted with the Raja Bendahara, a minor Malay chief. The latter mentioned how some of his retainers had watched a menora (his spelling) performance at Kampung Laut (presently a Malay village located in the jajahan of Tumpat).22 A mural painted on the outer walls of the derelict ordination hall (Th. bot) of a temple in the Thai settlement of Baan Jungkaw includes a faded scene of a nuuraa performance. Judging from the depiction of a European-type steamship and Chinese men wearing queues, I believe that the mural was probably painted in the nineteenth or early twentieth century. In his inventory of Malay dramatic forms Walter Skeat listed the mendura as a genre of Malay theatre of Siamese origin.23 From the above evidence it is plausible to conclude that the genre has been performed in Kelantan for at least a century. The nuuraa is a dramatic form incorporating elements of dance, music, narration, sung verse and comedy.24 A small ensemble of mostly percussion instruments provides musical accompaniment throughout the performance.25 The maanohraa and nuuraa were both traditionally performed by an all-male cast with teenage boys impersonating feminine characters (Th. naang),26 Since the 1960s, most (if not all) Kelantanese troupes have Phaasaa lae Watthanatham Pak Tai (Bangkok: O.S.

The incorporation of women into the maanohraa may be related to the Royal Dance Drama Edict of 1861, which encouraged Thai women to perform on stage so that they would be able to earn an income, as suggested by Mary Grow, "Dancing for the Spirits: Lakhon Chatri Performers from Petchaburi Province", Journal of the Siam Society 80 (1992): 105-112. Prayad Kasem, "Kaan</page><page sequence="7">292 Irving Chan Johnson included women (often accomplished Malay makyong actresses) to dramatize female roles.27 The inclusion of women in the Kelantanese genre was a result of necessity due to the unpopularity of the nuuraa profession with Thai boys, most of whom preferred the reliable economic returns secured from tobacco cultivation and urban employment. William Malm has suggested that female impersonation in the nuuraa could have arisen from an Islamic gendered bias in the dichotomizing of private and public spaces.28 Although it is possible to argue that Islam has impacted the structuring of Kelantanese Malay visual art, as evidenced by the use of Quranic formulas in most theatre prologue rituals, the extent of Islam's cultural influence on Buddhist Thai theatrical forms is unclear. Nevertheless, the nuuraa maintains a strong Malay flavour. Fluency in the Kelantan-Pattani dialect of Malay is a prerequisite to becoming a Nuuraa. This language is the preferred mode of dramatic discourse, with Thai being reserved for some formal songs and poetic chants.29 Celebrated actors have studied under or imitated acclaimed Malay makyong artistes to be able to sing in the stylized verse of the makyong drama that appeals to Malay audiences. Some troupes include Malay comedians and musicians as well. The nuuraa lead actor has however, remained Thai and male, thanks to his effective bilingualism (Malays rarely speak or understand Thai) and intimate association with sacred Thai performer ancestors. Prior to the Second World War, the nuuraa was common entertainment in Thai and Malay settlements throughout Kelantan, Trengganu, and southern Thailand. Thai temples usually engaged troupes as part of a programme of secular entertainment during festivals (Th. ngaan wat). Ritual occasions that merited nuuraa performances included the annual appeasement of village tutelary spirits (Th. waaj thaung), the feasting of damned ancestors (Th. saaj preet) and rewards to the spirits from grateful sponsors for fulfilled vows (Th. kae bon). A few wealthy Chinese staged nuuraa at lavish weddings and during Chinese religious ceremonies.30 Kelantanese Malays also sponsored annual nuuraa performances as visual offerings to the sea spirits (M. puja pantai) and during the Sultan's birthday celebrations (M. puja umur). Until the 1950s, the most popular troupes occasionally performed in the residences of the Sultan of Kelantan and his deputy, the Temenggong. Nuuraa lead actors who performed for royal personages enjoyed certain social privileges such as corv?e exemption. Today some Kelantanese Thais still refer to these once prestigious troupes by the honorific title of nuuraa phjaa (lit. the ruler's nuuraa). At Sadaeng Nora Jaak Adit Thueng Pajjuban", in Phum Thewa, p. 129, believes that the inclusion of women in the southern Thai drama began some seventy years ago in the province of Phatthalung. The practice was popularized by the two wives of the late Noraa Toem and was later adopted by troupes throughout the region. 27Makyong is a classical Kelantan-Pattani Malay dance-drama. 28William Malm, "Music in Kelantan, Malaysia and some of its Cultural Implications", in Studies in Malaysian Oral and Musical Traditions (Ann Arbor: Michigan Papers on South and Southeast Asia, 1974), pp. 1-47. 29The Kelantanese nuuraa is sometimes affectionately called the nuuraa khaek (lit. Malay nuuraa) by Thais owing to the strong Malay cultural elements present in the genre. Nuuraa thaj refers to the form of classical theatre performed in areas further north, including the maanohraa as well as Central Thai dramatic genres. 30For a description on Chinese sponsorship of maanohraa performances at a Chinese shrine in Penang, see Tan Sooi-Beng, "The Thai Menora in Malaysia: Adapting to the Penang Chinese Community", Asian Folklore Studies 47 (1988): 19-34.</page><page sequence="8">The Nuuraa Performer's Ritual Persona Kelantanese Thai Society 293 Nuuraa Khaan's house one afternoon, he eagerly showed me the crown which he had used during palace performances in his heyday as an actor some fifty years ago. The association of the nuuraa with ancestral spirits is well recognized by Kelantanese Thais. It is therefore unfortunate that researchers of North Malaysian theatre have overlooked the nuuraa's ritual role in the rural community.31 Lorraine Gesick has pointed out that most scholars who have studied the southern Thai maanohraa have concentrated on scrutinizing the art form's performance elements.32 Even though Louis Golomb and Roger Kershaw have provided commendable accounts of the Kelantanese Nuuraa's ritual and social identity as a magical practitioner, their discussions are situated within the study of Thai ethnicity in a plural Kelantanese setting.33 In order to understand the Nuuraa's ritual capacity as a love magician, it is essential that the indigenous concept of sanee be analyzed. Ijyve Magic and the Nuuraa When not performing on stage, the Nuuraa often functions as a love magician (Th. mau sane?). Kelantanese Thai love magic (Th. jaa sanee) is a form of manipulative magic directed at securing a bond of emotional attachment between individuals through the utilization of a pharmacopoeia of charmed substances (similarly referred to as jaa sane?) in the form of food, powders, perfumes, oils and so forth. Not infrequently love magicians may be requested by their clients to dissolve socially disapproved romances. During my stay in Kelantan, I heard of Thais seeking out renowned Nuuraa love magicians to discreetly destroy romantic intrigues between Thai Buddhists and their Malay Muslim lovers, relationships which if left unchecked were likely to result in the Thais' eventual conversion to Islam.34 In extreme cases, estranged and jealous lovers were rumoured to employ aggressive forms of love magic to bewitch their victims. Insatiable lust, insanity, incurable maladies, and death were the end results of the sorcery process. All forms of Kelantanese Thai love magic involve sanee?5 Most of my Thai informants agreed that sanee can best be interpreted as the charismatic appeal an individual exudes 31For example, Malm, "Music in Kelantan"; Sheppard, "Manora in Kelantan"; Yousof, Panggung Semar. Jeanne Cuisinier's article, "Une Danse Siamoise: Le Manora" {Journal de la Soci?t? des Oc?anistes II [1946]: 55-77) is commendable despite its Orientalist romanticism for its discussions on the Kelantanese Thai Nuuraa's ritual persona. 32Lorraine Gesick, In the Land of Lady White Blood: Southern Thailand and the Meaning of History (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1995), p. 65. 33Golomb, Brokers of Morality; Kershaw, "A Little Drama". 34Kelantanese Thais associate the conversion to Islam with the acceptance of Malay cultural identity, the conversion process being referred to as khaw khaek (lit. to enter into being a Malay). See Mohamed Yusoff Ismail, The Siamese of Aril: A Study of an Ethnic Minority Village (Bangi: Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 1980), p. 10. Unlike Standard (Central) Thai, which often uses the term khaek as a pejorative for South Asians, Tumpat-Taak Baj Thai defines khaek as non Buddhist Malays, including Muslims from the Indonesian archipelago. South Asians are often referred to by specific cultural-linguistic categories, e.g. Keling (Tamils), Saelaung (Sinhalese), and Siik (Sikhs). Thais who have converted to Islam are often no longer members of the Thai village community and usually reside in Muslim settlements. 35The concept of sanee has no equivalent in the English language. My definition is based on what Kelantanese Thais related to me in Thai and through the translation process has lost some of its original meaning.</page><page sequence="9">294 Irving Chan Johnson which makes him or her irresistably attractive and popular in the eyes of certain onlookers. The power attributed to sanee can vary from a mild sympathetic response to severe emotional enchantment. Some people are believed to become so hypnotically absorbed by the magnetic appeal of an actor's sanee that they remain in a state of physical and emotional stupor. Kelantanese Thais refer to this intense psychological attraction as long (lit. to become lost); it is usually associated with audiences at theatrical events, especially nuuraa performances.36 "Even men fell for each other", laughed Nuuraa Waan, recalling sanee's seductive magnetism. He remembered an incident involving a group of Malay men who had become long as a consequence of watching his performance one evening. The next morning he was surprised to find the youths asleep at his doorstep. Despite his repeated attempts at persuading them to leave, the mesmerized men stubbornly resisted, insisting on being physically close to their "idol". As a last resort, Nuuraa Waan sprinkled his unwelcome guests with lustral water (Th. naam mon), after which they regained their faculties and dispersed. Belief in the alluring genius of theatrical personae is not unique to Kelantanese Thais. Barbara Wright has observed that Kelantanese Malay shadow puppet masters (M. tok dalang) are often credited with a "technology for seduction".37 In her study on Thai theatre, Mattani Rutnin writes of the intense admiration some women viewers have for their favourite actors in the urban like drama of Central Thailand.38 According to Somchintana Thongthew-Ratanasarn, both like and northeastern Thai lamtad artistes have a notorious reputation as adulterers.39 Maanohraa actors in southern Thailand, like their Kelantanese counterparts, are often acclaimed as charmers extraordinaires and a threat to young girls, who are believed to fall madly in love with these amorous performers.40 Most Kelantanese Thai villagers I spoke with were well aware of the Nuuraa's purported seductive prowess. Nuuraa in turn manipulate this stereotyped image of themselves through informal channels of subtle appropriation. Their sanee is authenticated through being located historically in the extensive network of gossip and rumour which "mythologise" the Nuuraa's esoteric abilities. Non-Nuuraa villagers often speak of how romantic liaisons were miraculously forged or dissolved after clients had consulted Nuuraa love magicians. Active mythologizing is not restricted to the recollection of contemporaneous accounts, but involves the dissemination of narratives situated in a shadowy past. For instance, former Tumpat resident Ke Nuan remembered hearing of how the late Nuuraa Khaeng 36Amin Sweeney has observed a similar belief in the hypnotic effect audiences experience when watching Malay shadow plays. This belief could have led to the official chastisement of theatrical performances by conservative Muslim theologians who viewed the engagement of the senses to performance as a detachment from Islamic conceptions of rationality {akal). A similar belief in the spell of the performance has been discussed in Homeric philosophy.

She had never seen him in action (in fact, most of my informants who spoke of sorcerers had never seen sorcery in practice) but had heard of the incident from a well-respected monk residing in the temple. Nuuraa unabashedly relate firsthand accounts of the forcefulness of their sanee and their many successes in love magic. Even Nuuraa Khaan, who usually distanced himself from the ethics of the debate on the morality of emotional manipulation, was quick to recall the numerous women admirers he had during his heyday as a young actor nearly fifty years ago. At the time, his gaze and voice were enough to move star-struck members of the audience to tears, and some of them secretly trailed him home after the evening's performance. Nuuraa Waan and Nuuraa Sao prided themselves on their travels to various Malaysian states (as well as occasional trips to Singapore) during which they dispensed love medicines for a largely urban-based clientele who included members of the Malaysian political elite. These vernacular discourses articulated by Nuuraa and non-Nuuraa have spread well beyond the ethnic and cultural confines of the Kelantanese Thai community. Malays and Chinese also actively engage in the reproduction and elaboration of these accounts, thereby strengthening the "legendary prowess" that surrounds the actor in the social imaginings of the Kelantanese community.41 Power and the Mediation of Opposites The magnetic appeal of sanee is animated through recourse to a variety of sanee enticing, -enhancing, and -maintaining devices, the most important of which are the short verbal incantations known as khaathaa. Composing an amalgam of Thai and Pali words, these spells impregnate various symbolic articles (including the intoner himself) with sanee, thereby sacralizing the otherwise "raw" ingredients into potent love medicines. Nuuraa Waan revealed that the Nuuraa's unbridled status as a charmer was a result of his arcane knowledge of sanee magic carefully cultivated through the successive recitation of khaathaa. In his usual witty manner, Nuuraa Waan acknowledged the fact that: even before he [the Nuuraa] began the performance he sacralised this and sacralised that. He continued even when he was on stage through reciting incantations that he brought on stage with him. This is what spectators see as beautiful...ah...there are many incantations, they are not long but there are many different types...yes... sometimes looking [at the Nuuraa] in the day...hmm...But at night...oh wow! Not all khaathaa involve the generating of attraction. Spells may also be recited to achieve success in business or education, personal safety and so on. A number of khaathaa are understood by Kelantanese Thais to be public knowledge and reciprocally transacted between intimates. The recently published (1997) biography of the late chief abbot of Wat Phikulthongwararam, a temple in the village of Baan Bausamed, incorporates an appendix of selected khaathaa along with the historical account of the old monk's life. During the temple's cremation festivities, copies of the souvenir booklet were distributed to members of the lay community whose financial contributions had helped defray the huge funeral budget. Despite the seeming commercialization of the printed spell, its mystical power is 41 Golomb, Brokers of Morality, p. 55.</page><page sequence="11">296 Irving Chan Johnson not negotiated, since a spell's ritual efficacy lies in its origins in sacred personae, rather than in the medium of its transmission. Not all khaathaa are publicly accessible. Khaathaa utilized by the Nuuraa in activat ing sanee are never revealed to non-actors who remain outside the art form's ancestral kin network. As with Stanley Tambiah's definition of the Sanskritic-derived mantra, the language of the Nuuraa's khaathaa is "muttered...and it is not meant to be heard [by the human audience] for it constitutes secret knowledge".42 In her excellent analysis of Trengganu Malay shamanistic seances, Carol Laderman pointed out that not all shamans (M. bomoh main peteri) emphasized secrecy in guaranteeing magical efficacy. She noted that Malay magical practitioners who maintained the exclusivity of their ritual knowledge through placing a high value on secrecy were sometimes mocked by their less discreet peers, who argued that secrecy was a veneer to mask what was really a deficiency in their store of ritual knowledge. Magical practitioners who did not insist on secrecy included theatrical personae such as makyong performers and shadow puppet masters. They held the opinion that magical efficacy lay in the "contextual meaning" of the words that comprised oral spells rather than in the theatrics of fixed and secret recitation.43 Kelantanese Thai Nuuraa give high priority to discretion in their magical endeavour. The precise vocabulary of the khaathaa remains in the hands of the Nuuraa and is not publically shared with non-performers. This does not mean that non-actors are unaware of the existence of such spells. The Nuuraa's possession of attraction enhancing spells resembles what J?rg Bergmann has called the "open secret".44 Non-Nuuraa (both Kelantanese Thais and Malays) are aware of the spell's existence through a channel of vernacular discourses that surround the actor's ritual power. Nonetheless, by restricting access to the specifics of textual phraseology the Nuuraa maintains his dominant monopoly of love magic. The khaathaa's ritual significance derives from its being the repository of the sacred power of the Nuuraa's teacher ancestors (Th. taa jaaj nuura?), a. sub-group within a wider ancestral domain (Th. taa jaaj). Real and mythic teacher ancestors themselves exuded sanee in their lifetime and are now appealed to by their performing descendants to operationalize their own attractive potential.45 Most Nuuraa claim to have been descended from Nuuraa (Th. titih/bangkau nuuraa). Nuuraa I met all spoke affectionately of their predecessors, often positioning themselves within complex genealogies of performer culture heroes, thereby affirming the historic authenticity of their khaathaa and concomitant power-laden repute. A son traditionally succeeded his Nuuraa father, although this was not always necessarily the case. Interested boys sometimes learnt the art form through imitation or formal apprenticeship. The late Nuuraa Ceng and his brother were renowned actors who had mastered the genre through imitating the style of senior performers. Since they had not been formally initiated into 42Stanley Tambiah, "The Magical Power of Words", Man 3 (1968): 175-208. 43Carol Laderman, Taming the Winds of Desire: Psychology, Medicine, and Aesthetics in Malay Shamanistic Performance (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985), pp. 52-53. ^Jorg Bergmann, Discreet Indiscretion: The Social Organisation of Gossip, trans.

As such, Nuuraa Ceng and his brother were not known to be love magicians. The intimate relationship between the human actor and his art form's progenitors is reflected during ritual events that engage both realms of existence. As with most South east Asian performative genres, every nuuraa performance commences with a theatre consecration ritual.46 Through the recitation of khaathaa the troupe's lead actor (often the Nuuraa himself) attempts to transmit sanee from its foci in the primordial Nuuraa, Theeb Singhaurn, to the living performer.47 The deified ancestral spirit is respectfully enticed to descend from his heavenly abode and "possess" (Th. sing so/khaw song) the Nuuraa for the duration of the dramatic performance. Ancestral presence is understood by Kelantanese Nuuraa to be a passive psychological experience not resulting in an altered state of consciousness. The Nuuraa remains aware of his physical and mental faculties throughout the performance. He realizes that it is he who is speaking, singing, dancing and joking, but at the same time implicitly believes that he is a physical embodiment of Theeb Singhaurn's sanee-?We? subjectivity, which aids in securing the audience's attention.48 Nuuraa Sao summed up the condition as follows: He is attractive since before wearing the nuuraa costume he invokes Theeb Singhaurn, the Teacher, to possess our bodies.. .after being possessed then people will look at him and fall in love and be attracted to the Nuuraa. Exhibitions of deep cathartic trance in the nuuraa are rare and restricted to teacher homage ceremonies (Th. waaj khruu) and the initiation of new actors (Th. khraub soed). These ritual occasions are characterized by successive episodes of ecstatic trance posses sion alternating among various members of the nuuraa institution. Possessing entities are drawn from the ranks of a multiplicity of anthropomorphic ancestral spirits ranging from the art form's earliest founders to lesser-known and recently deceased historical actors. Invisible ancestral spirits are materialized in the speech, gesture and movement articulated through the medium of the actor whose self-consciousness has been deliberately and momentarily suppressed. The entranced Nuuraa effectively mediates the social distance that divides the supermundane sacredness of the ancestors with the mundane world of their living kin. Trance possession personifies the uncanny parallelism between both ancestors and humans. Like humans, the ancestors speak a familiar language (Tumpat Taak Bai or Central Thai, depending on the presumed history of the possessing entity), chew betel, are enticed by gentle persuasion and sensory stimulants (benzoin, incense, food offerings and music) and have similar emotional and psychological dispositions 46In An Anthropology of Curing, p. 54, Golomb notes that the near universality of the prologue ritual in most forms of Southeast Asian theatre points to possible origins in the recitation of spells prior to the religious presentation of Hindu epic literature in India. 47Mattani has suggested that Theeb Singhaurn could have been a derivative of Panja Sikhon Thewada, a heavenly musician in Indra's heaven (Mattani, Dance, Drama, and Theatre, p. 34). Kelantanese Thai Nuuraa credit him with being the son of the virgin Mae Si Maalaa. 48Carol Laderman has observed that there are differing levels of trance within a Malay Main Peteri seance. She points out that during the lightest "trance" state the shaman, like the Kelantanese Thai Nuuraa, "is aware of the spirit's presence, but it is he, not they who speak". Deep entrancement occurs when the possessing entity is a powerful genie or spirit. See Laderman, Taming the Winds, p. 88.</page><page sequence="13">298 Irving Chan Johnson (sympathy, anger, compassion, etc.). Despite these explicit structural resemblances, the Nuuraa's performing ancestors remain the powerful denizens of an ancestral netherworld and are therefore categorically opposed and inaccessible to the living. The Nuuraa during trance rituals breaches this binary differentiation. His simultaneous symbolic existence between the sacred and the secular is further elaborated in relation to the Nuuraa's ritual attitude toward the crocodile (Th. thoekhee). It is common belief amongst some Kelantanese Thai villagers that Nuuraa are reborn as crocodiles upon death. Their reptilian rebirth is dependent solely on their membership in the dramaturgical institution achieved through participation in a successful initiation ceremony. The classical nuuraa narratives of Naang Taeng Aun (lit: the Young Melon Princess), Chaalawan, and Aj Wong contain powerful images of crocodile transmogrifi cation during which the human actor was miraculously transformed into a crocodile.49 As we discussed the intimate relationship between Nuuraa and crocodiles, Nuuraa Waan affirmed in a rather serious tone that: ...people who are Nuuraa are always reborn as crocodiles once they die...there are instances of people whose ancestors are crocodiles, they [the ancestor] have surfaced so that humans could see them. There are some in Tuuwaa [a Thai village in the jajahan of Tumpat], even here at Baang Mod there are a few...it's because since the beginning of time, Naang Taeng Aun's elder brother was transformed into a crocodile...it comes from this story...in the past, if we were unsure of the story, we could not perform Chaalawan or Aj Wong. They say that if you did not perform it right, you would slither into the river and become a crocodile, soed and all. Yes, you would change into a crocodile. Nuuraa who have been reborn as crocodiles can, through the conduit of possession, temporally re-enter the human realm. Crocodiles rarely discriminate in choosing who they will possess. To illustrate, Nuuraa Waan told me of how he had come into direct contact with one of these sacred creatures. One evening, a group of friends gathered at his house to savour palm wine, a common social activity in many Kelantanese Thai villages after the day's work has been done. In the jovial atmosphere some of the men decided to try their hands at playing Nuuraa Waan's musical instruments, and soon a tune was struck. Suddenly, Jaw Dit stood up and started to dance, although he had not received any training in the nuuraa. His erratic behaviour was peculiar for a man well known for his reticence. "I am the old Nuuraa", he sobbed, referring to the late Nuuraa Phud. Revealing his identity as an inhabitant of the river that flowed through the village of 49Malays also have beliefs about the magical power of crocodiles. The story of Tok Sarilang tells of a human infant who is mysteriously transformed into a crocodile after falling into a river. See Skeat, Malay Magic, pp. 285-86. Richard Winstedt, in The Malay Magician: Being Shaman, Saiva and Sufi (Kuala Lumpur: Oxford University Press, 1993 reprint), suggests that the crocodile as a sacred ancestor in Malay folk belief could have possible Hindu origins in Sambhu, an avatar of Shiva and Lord of the Waters. Skeat notes that Malays sometimes refer to the reptile as "Sambu Agai" or "Jambi Rakai", the first portion of the name probably referring to the avatar. Some Malay beliefs place the original crocodile as a plaything of Siti Fatima, the Prophet Mohammed's daughter and therefore make it a sacred animal. See Skeat, Malay Magic, for a lengthier explanation of the narrative. Malays also have beliefs about the magical power of crocodiles. The story of Tok Sarilang tells of a human infant who is mysteriously transformed into a crocodile after falling into a river. See ibid., pp. 285-86.</page><page sequence="14">The Nuuraa Performer's Ritual Persona Kelantanese Thai Society 299 Baang Saet in Pasir Mas, he added that he had heard the music and thought that there was a nuuraa performance to which he was not invited, thus accounting for his sorrow. Only after Nuuraa Waan explained that the music was not meant for a performance did the possessing entity leave Jaw Dit, to continue on its watery journey to "visit" living kin in a nearby Thai settlement. Crocodiles represent an intermediate stage in the Nuuraa's progression from human to ancestor. The Nuuraa becomes fully incorporated into the ancestral realm only after the crocodile dies. The crocodile's position within the symbolic ordering of the Kelantanese Thai external world associates the creature with the power-laden sacredness of liminality. Through the process of possession, the Nuuraa in his crocodilian form can mediate between human (Th. manud) and animal (Th. sad) realms, penetrating these mutually opposed categories. Mary Douglas has stated that the benevolent and procreative energies which the Lele people associate with the pangolin derive from the anteater's liminal attributes that mediate the cognitive classificatory fields in Lele thought. Physically and behaviourally, the pangolin represents an amalgamation of culturally significant opposites since "its being contradicts all the most obvious animal categories. It is scaly like a fish, but it climbs trees. It is more like an egg-laying lizard than a mammal, yet it suckles its young. And most significant of all, unlike other small mammals its young are born singly."50 Likewise, the crocodile can be considered an anomalous animal in the Kelantanese Thai classificatory system. It is unlike most animals in its ability to survive on land and in water, preferring the estuarine zones where the edges of water and land merge. The fact that it has few predators makes it the dominant creature in both ecological niches. Turtles (Th. taw) and frogs (Th. khied) also inhabit the blurred boundaries between land and water, but these small animals are considered docile by Kelantanese Thais since they are part of village (cultured) space, dwelling in the shallow streams, ponds and rice fields located in and near the village.51 Crocodiles are associated with deep rivers far from human settlement, areas inhabited by potentially hostile spirits (Th. phii).52 Although referring to animal categories in north eastern Thailand, Stanley Tambiah's astute observation that animals of the deep forest represent the "power, danger, and might of the forest ... and they are viewed with admi ration and awe and fear" is applicable to Kelantanese Thai perceptions of the crocodile.53 Nonetheless, the crocodile is not exclusively a forest animal. Certain large rivers that 50Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger, p. 170. 5 kelantanese Thais believe the crocodile has a more docile counterpart in the unassuming little house gecko (Th. cingcauk). At some point in the mythic past, the two reptiles agreed to assist each other in their activities. Thus, Kelantanese Thais point out that if a person has been attacked by a crocodile, he must never come into contact with gecko droppings lest it kill him. The unlucky individual must recover in a shed specially constructed in the middle of the rice fields, far from the habitation of geckos. Similarly, Stanley Tambiah has shown that northeastern Thai villagers believe that domesticated animals also have counterparts in the forest. See his article entitled "Classification of Animals in Thailand", in Rules and Meanings: The Anthropology of Everyday Knowledge, ed. Mary Douglas (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1973), pp. 127-65. 52For further discussion on Thai perceptions of the forest, see, J.L. Taylor's Forest Monks and the Nation-State: An Anthropological and Historical Study in Northeastern Thailand (Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 1993), pp. 246-50. 53Tambiah, "Classification of Animals", p. 145.</page><page sequence="15">300 Irving Chan Johnson flow through villages or on the peripheries of human habitation, such as those at Bang Saet, Baan Naj and Tuuwaa are believed to be the home of large and sometimes sacred crocodiles, although most villagers rarely come into direct contact with them. One of my friends from Baang Saet told me that he had heard of an albino crocodile inhabiting his village's river.54 He had never seen the mystical creature himself but had heard of it from another villager who had spotted its pink nose surfacing for air. The crocodile's carnivorous ferocity associates it with the undomesticated wilderness beyond the confines of a controlled and cultured humanity, yet it, too, is found in the unclear boundaries that demarcate settlements from nature. Its symbolic positioning between spatial domains (land-water, untamed wilderness-human settlement) associates the crocodile with a power unmatched by other animals, the exception being the tiger, an animal Roger Wessing considered liminal since it is simultaneously benevolent (destroying pests) and savagely unpredictable (killing humans). Kelantanese Thais, like Malays, believe shamans (Th. mau phii jab) are reborn as tigers once the mortal body has died.55 The complex dialectic between the triadic classificatory structure comprising Nuuraa, crocodile and ancestral spirit can be presented diagrammatically (see Figure). Each symbol within this structure interacts with the next nearest symbol. The structure is held in place by the Nuuraa's mediating abilities. The Nuuraa's specific magico-erotic power in influencing human emotions is the attribute of his constant mediation of these otherwise disparate and opposed categories. Belief in a predestined rebirth proves a contradiction to popular Buddhist notions of kamma which state that all intentional actions will result in positive or negative reac tions.56 Most Kelantanese Thais understand rebirth to be conditioned upon their kamma. Merit (Th. bun) acquired through moral acts such as listening to Buddhist sermons, freeing captive animals, assisting in temple maintenance and showing generosity yield other-worldly rewards including for example, an improved rebirth as a deity (Th. theewadaa) in one of the many hierarchically ordered "heavens" (Th. sawan). Animal rebirth is the abhorred reverberation of immorality (Th. baab) and is viewed with con tempt by Kelantanese Thais. Unlike humans, animals are believed to live in perpetual fear and misery, their unpredictable social world constructed around the gratification of base instincts (eating, procreation, sleep, etc.).57 Through belief in a predestined crocodile rebirth dependent solely on his membership in the nuuraa institution, the actor symbolically dissociates himself from the workings 54Albino crocodiles are also sacred animals in Malay and Javanese popular belief. 55The association of shamans with tigers is not confined to the Kelantanese Thai case but has been documented in many parts of insular Southeast Asia as well. Roger Wessing has argued that like the tiger, the shaman is himself a liminal and therefore powerful persona. He too bridges the gap between socially constructed boundaries such as village and forest, ancestors and humans, animal and human. See Roger Wessing, The Soul of Ambiguity: The Tiger in Southeast Asia (Northern fllinois University: Centre for Southeast Asian Studies, 1986). 56Narada, The Buddha and His Teachings (Kuala Lumpur: Buddhist Missionary Society, 1988), defines kamma (Sanskrit karma) as, "any kind of intentional action whether mental, verbal, or physical" (p. 348). 57In Pali Buddhism, the realm of animals (Pali tirachana) is one of four "states of unhappiness" {apoya). The other three states of suffering are the hells {niraya), pathetic and deformed departed spirits {peta), and demons {asura). See Narada, The Buddha and His Teachings, pp. 437-39.</page><page sequence="16">The Nuuraa Performer's Ritual Persona Kelantanese Thai Society 301 Humans {manui) Initiation Nuuraa Animals {sad) ii / / \ ^, Crocodile 7/ death Figure The Ritual Dialectic between Nuuraa, Crocodile and Performing Ancestral of kamma in accounting for his future existence, which could possibly attest to a non Buddhist belief system woven into a larger Buddhist cosmos. The Nuuraa manages this paradox through expressing a seeming disbelief with regard to his rebirth as a crocodile. Nuuraa Khaan, Nuuraa Sao, and Nuuraa Waan vehemently denied that they would be reborn as crocodiles, although they did not question crocodilian ancestry in the art form pointing to the classical and vernacular narratives as archaic truisms. By locating predestination in an historical past rather than in the contemporary present, the Nuuraa symbolically dissociates himself from accusations of immorality whilst maintaining associations with reptilian rebirth. Non-Nuuraa villagers seem to express more confidence regarding the ritual connection between Nuuraa and crocodiles. Seventy-five-year old Ke Phud, who spent her childhood in the small district town of Tumpat, remembered hearing of a baby crocodile found entangled in a fisherman's net. The surprise catch attracted many curious onlookers who believed that the reptile was none other than the recently deceased Nuuraa Khaeng, a well-known actor and notorious sorcerer. Nuuraa Waan's wife Ke Tern seemed resigned to accept her husband's ultimate fate, in spite of his firm denial that he will be reborn as a crocodile. She was in no way fatalistic, however, and noted that by doing more moral deeds, his rebirth as an animal could be countered.</page><page sequence="17">302 Irving Chan Johnson Until the 1960s, the social world of the Kelantanese nuuraa was strictly androcentric. Women were barred from performing due their association with ritual uncleanliness emanating from the menstrual cycle.58 Only men and post-menopausal women could prepare offerings (Th. baj sii) used in the propitiation rituals of nuuraa ancestral teachers.59 Nuuraa Waan warned that should a menstruating woman be allowed to enter the performing arena (Th. rong), the troupe would become susceptible to the penetration of malevolent phii dispatched by rival performers to destroy competitors. The destructive potency of a menstruating woman even had an effect on the construction of the performing arena. Justifying the exclusion of women from the genre, Nuuraa Waan recalled that: This is why they [the Nuuraa] prevent women from coming onto the nuuraa perform ance area. It's all right if the woman is not menstruating, but if she is experiencing that time of month, we cannot even erect the fence around the arena. It will never hold together. In the past, women were even prevented from stepping onto the performing area. They had to watch from the sidelines. In the Kelantanese Thai communities I visited I did not observe any explicit social proscriptions against menstruation except in nuuraa rituals. The lack of emphasis on menstrual taboos in Kelantanese Thai society may be due to widespread gender role complementarity in which both men and women share near-equivalent social status. Laura Appell uses the term "gender symmetry" to refer to societies in which gender difference is de-emphasized.60 Although Kelantanese Thai men and women often perform different roles in socio-cultural life, these activities are frequently not mutually exclusive, with both being regarded as complementary and therefore of equal importance in the maintenance of the community. Similarly, Kelantanese Thais trace descent bilaterally, brideprice and wealth flow in both directions, and postnuptial residence is often ambilocal. Gender asymmetry comes to the fore in the ritual context. Most Kelantanese Thai magical practitioners are men, although women used to perform minor roles as spirit mediums (Th. mae mod) during the now extinct exorcistic seances (Th. phii jab). Women are often denied access to Buddhist knowledge and sacra vital components in the activation of ritual power, which hampers their participation as religious specialists. Kelantanese Thais classify menstrual blood under the general rubric of "dirty things" (Th. khrueng sakhrok) that include excreta, corpse parts, body grime, hair, nails and so on. The onset of menstruation is commonly referred to as maa roeduu (lit. the season's arrival), maa prajam (lit. the regular arrival), or maa sakhrok (lit. dirt's arrival). Douglas' contention that dirt is "matter out of place" and therefore a "powerful" and dangerous anomaly is relevant in interpreting its presumed use as an active ingredient in the most aggressive 58Gesick, In the Land of Lady White Blood, p. 6, states that female pollution was not restricted to menstruating women in Thai society but included post-menopausal women as well, citing as evidence a story from a Northern Thai chronicle. I believe the issue is more complex and depends on the social and ritual context. For instance post-menopausal women were not considered as polluting in the context of the nuuraa but were still denied access to Buddhist sacra. 59Baj sii offerings usually consist of an arrangement of flowers, incense, candles, betel, fruit and various kinds of specially prepared food. 60Laura Appell, "Menstruation Among the Rungus of Borneo: An Unmarked Category", in Blood Magic: The Anthropology of Menstruation, ed. Thomas Buckley and Alma Gottlieb (Berkeley: University of California Press), p. 94.</page><page sequence="18">The Nuuraa Performer's Ritual Persona Kelantanese Thai Society 303 forms of love magic.61 Many Kelantanese Thais and Malays accuse Nuuraa of preparing harmful sorcery medicines from these polluting agents.62 The Nuuraa I spoke to staunchly denied accusations that they dabbled in malign sorcery. They were quick to clarify that the love magic they prepared contained only ritually "clean" (Th. klieng) ingredients obtained from flowers, beeswax, coconut oil, perfume and talc. They attributed the power of Nuuraa love magic to their spiritual patrons, who were believed to be immaculately pure and readily repulsed at the slightest hint of pollution. Their hallowed purity only allowed them to transmit sanee and never to inflict hurt, an activity Nuuraa associated with lay {non-Nuuraa) sorcerers. Nuuraa Waan emphasized the fact that "those who dabble with corpse spirits are never Nuuraa. I am sure of it ... Nuuraa never practice magic to instigate hatred ... or to inflict pain on someone ... this is not the concern of the Nuuraa. The Nuuraa only prepares one thing, that is, love magic." I had heard from some villagers that Nuuraa Sao had been spotted preparing sorcery medicines in the temple graveyard a few times. At his house one morning, I asked him if he had dabbled in dangerous and harm-inducing magic. Nuuraa Sao smiled and readily admitted that in his younger days he had prepared sorcery medicines from corpse parts, including the much feared chin oil.63 He had stopped doing so since it was now too difficult to find the ingredients necessary for catalyzing sorcery because of the practice of immediate cremation of the violent dead. In the past, these corpses were buried in the temple graveyard prior to their cremation a few months later. Nuuraa Sao professed that his manufacture of malicious magic had nothing to do with his professional vocation as a Nuuraa; in fact, he stated that it was opposed to the sanctity of ancestral power. He acknowledged that he had studied sorcery with a non-Nuuraa practitioner. His esoteric excursions into the feared realm of sorcery initially resulted from a youthful curiosity, but he later realized that by preparing both love magic and sorcery, he enjoyed the economic rewards of a wider clientele. At the ritual age of twenty-two the apprentice Nuuraa was formally inducted into his professional career through the elaborate Crown-Wearing Ceremony (Th. khraub soed) during which his teacher presented him with the various khaathaa used in generating attraction. The initiation ceremony was last performed in Kelantan some thirty years ago to mark Nuuraa Waan's successful completion of his theatrical apprenticeship. Through out his apprenticeship, the performer enacted only feminine roles, playing the part of queens, princesses, and other refined women. On stage, he dressed in drag and imperson ated culturally defined feminine characteristics. Femininity was restricted to the period when the drama was in progress. Outside the performance context, the actor reverted back to social maleness. His long uncut hair, earrings and effeminate-like mannerisms distinguished him as a trainee Nuuraa. Emerging from the Crown-Wearing Ceremony, 61Douglas, Purity and Danger, p. 36. 62Wavell, "The Naga King's Daughter", pp. 136-37, notes the notorious repute Kelantanese Thai Nuuraa had as sorcerers in the popular imagination of Malay villagers. 63Corpse chin oil (Th. naam man phraaj/naam man phii taaj hong) is extracted by heating the fatty tissue under the chin of a corpse which had suffered a violent death (Th. taaj hong), e.g. during pregnancy, in accidents, as murder victims, and so on. Similar beliefs in corpse chin oil have been observed amongst Kelantanese Malays; see Wavell, "The Naga King's Daughter" and Marlene Gueldren, Thailand: Into the Spirit World (Bangkok: Asia Books, 1995).</page><page sequence="19">304 Irving Chan Johnson the Nuuraa dramatized only masculine roles associated with the narrative's protagonist culture heroes. Although apprentice actors symbolically transgressed genders, I did not hear of any instances of homosexuality in the nuuraa. Kelantanese Thais do not have an indigenous term that refers to same sex desire or to transvestite cross-dressers. The Kelantanese Thai classificatory system recognizes only two genders defined by genitalia into a binary opposition between "men" (Th. phoe chaaj) and "women" (Th. phoe nying). A man who is sexually attracted to another man nevertheless remains phoe chaaj since he is biologically male and therefore need not warrant a distinct sexual category. Not all Kelantanese Thais have such distinct gendered identities. Although I did not meet anyone who transgressed gender categories, I heard some of my informants speak of men who behave effeminately despite possessing male genitalia. Nuuraa Sao used the Kelantanese Malay term ponde to refer to these unconventional individuals who deviated from culturally sanctioned standards of sex-gender behaviour. He denied any association of the Nuuraa with these marginalized and mocked members of the community. To him, there was a sharp distinction between the Nuuraa who play-acted feminine and the ponde whose unbridled femininity was expressed during everyday interactions. Nuuraa Waan suggested that the ponde is a recent construct in the gendered imaginings of Kelantanese Thai, emphasizing that such a person was unheard of in the past. The only individual who symbolically crossed genders was the Nuuraa, and his role was legitimate. This echoes Mark Johnson's suggestion that the crystallization of bantut (which he equated with "transgenderally identified men") as a sexual/gendered identity in Sulu was a result of the imposition of Western sexual discourses on southern Filipino society, itself a relatively recent social trend.64 The apprentice Nuuraa's cross-dressing and effeminate behaviour, unlike that of the ponde, is restricted to the drama's ritual meaning. Also unlike the ponde, the actor is not regarded as a social deviant since his gendered behaviour represents a "sacred" involvement with the nuuraa's powerful ancestral spirits who, unable to tolerate the pollution of menstruation, require males to perform as females. The societal tolerance accorded female impersonation in the drama can be viewed in the light of Victor Turner's recent analysis of performance.65 According to Turner, cultural performances presented before an audience are instances of public liminality in that "they are performed in privileged spaces and times, set off from the periods and areas reserved for work, food, and sleep...[T]he phenomena of liminality dissolve all factual and common-sense systems into their components and 'play' with them in ways never found in nature or in custom, at least at the level of direct perception."66 Theatre is therefore "sacred", especially when it includes ritual symbols. Unexpressed and socially restrained modes of behaviour come to the fore and are tolerated in the play. Turner considered cultural performances to be part of the "subjunctive domain of culture", since they express pure possibility rather than the statement of actual social facts.67 The ^Mark Johnson, Beauty and Power: Trans gendering and Cultural Transformation in the Southern Philippines (Oxford and New York: Berg, 1997). 65Victor Turner, The Anthropology of Performance (New York: PAJ Publication, 1992). 66Ibid., p. 25. 67Ibid., p. 101.</page><page sequence="20">The Nuuraa Performer's Ritual Persona Kelantanese Thai Society 305 apprentice Nuuraa presents himself as a woman only during the subjunctive and ritualistic mood of the play, unlike the ponde, who is not a part of the ritual process. Nuuraa Waan added that the Nuuraa was never associated with permanent gender crossing. He did not use the term "effeminate" or the phrase "woman-like" (Th. myuen kan phoe nying) when speaking of the Nuuraa's personality, preferring instead the word aun ae (lit. graceful).68 Barbara Wright has noted a similar norm of idealised behaviour amongst Kelantanese Malay shadow puppeteers who are socially expected to behave gently by expressing "a modest and unassertive demeanour" (M. lemah-lembut).69 The Nuuraa's projections of aun ae are demonstrated both on and off the stage. Nuuraa are often recognized by their poised confidence and gentle mannerisms which, although bordering on the effeminate, are not associated with femaieness or feminine sexual instinct. Benedict Anderson has remarked that one of the sources of power in Javanese cos mology arose from the concentration of "apparently antagonistic opposites".70 This is clearly illustrated in ancient Javanese iconographie representations of ardhahari images, the left side of which is depicted as biologically female and the right side as male. Of these figures Anderson observed that "the essential characteristic of this combination of opposites is not their merging but their dynamic simultaneous incorporation within a single entity".71 The Nuuraa symbolically manifests both genders within himself. His masculinity is culturally ascribed by virtue of his physiological make-up, as well as the hallmark of an achieved status resulting from initiation. He simultaneously represents an idealized femininity in subscribing to the cultural ideals of "gracefulness". In short, like the Javanese image the Nuuraa is "at once masculine and feminine, containing both elements within himself and holding them in a tense electric balance". Power is the attribute of the Nuuraa's ability to concentrate opposing gendered symbols. This abstract power is translated into a familiar magical efficacy through establishing connections with ancestral spirits with the successful completion of theatrical initiation. Conclusion Theoretically the Nuuraa can be viewed as an ambiguous person in Kelantanese Thai society. As opposed to most villagers, he consolidates within definitions of his self a multiplicity of juxtaposed and contrastive symbols which taken together account for his assumed seductive power. In self-consciously interpreting his social and ritual identity as a villager (Th. chaw baan), an artiste (Th. lakleeng) and a love magician (Th. mau sanee), 68The Kelantanese Thai word aun ae is also used to refer to the weak/sickly condition some children and adults experience due to congenital defects. In the context of performance, the term refers specifically to graceful mannerisms of speech, action, behaviour, etc. During my conversations with Kelantanese Thai informants, the same weak state was sometimes simply referred to as the condition of being aun or aun prie. In Standard (Central) Thai, aun ae refers to physical weakness, whereas aun aen refers to a state of almost effeminate gracefulness. 69Wright, "The Role of the Dalang", p. 34. The heroic characters of the Kelantanese Malay shadow puppet theatre are also believed to epitomize graceful behaviour (personal communication from Professor Amin Sweeney, 1998). 70Benedict Anderson, "The Idea of Power in Javanese Culture", in Culture and Politics in Indonesia, ed.

I have framed my analysis around Victor Turner's idea of liminality. The thrust of Turnerian liminality is processual, emphasizing temporality above spatiality. Entities are liminal only in the context of a dynamically transformative social structure that will result in a changed situation (e.g. in an enhanced social status) once achieved. In the nuuraa, the characteristic example of temporal liminality is the apprentice performer undergoing ritual initiation into the dramaturgical institution through his participation in the Crown Wearing ceremony. Graduating from initiation, the actor is reintegrated into the hierarchi cally ordered social and ritual structure. The Nuuraa can also be analyzed as existing within a permanent and spatially bordered liminality through his integration of contrastive yet complementary binary oppositions. His symbolic bridging of differentiation positions him outside the workaday world of the village community while his theatrical and ritual associations ensure his membership and participation in the social-cultural processes of Kelantanese Thai life. Symbolic associations exist at various levels of signification (e.g. ancestral, ritual, species, gendered, etc.) encompassed within a broader cultural spectrum divided between the familial intimacy of the known cultural environment and the distance of the unknown. Although symbols and the meanings they present are in a constant dialogue, mediated by the Nuuraa, the underlying substructure remains one of power relations and their sub sequent translation by the Nuuraa into a magico-erotic ritual prowess. The Nuuraa straddles mundanity and sanctity. He is a member of the familiar social environment of the Kelantanese Thai village while simultaneously forming a bridge to the distant "otherness" of ancestral spirits. Teacher ancestors are the catalysts for the operationalization of love magic. Their sacred power is transmitted through discreet verbal spells. His respected intimacy with the supermundane is made public during large scale ritual occasions involving trance-possession. The Nuuraa actively engages in both the ancestral and human worlds simultaneously ? even non-ritual performances are preceded with invocations to Theeb Singhaurn ? and enjoys their social relationships in the form of social prestige and seductive calibre. On a more abstract level, the Nuuraa mediates between living humans and the powerful ex-human ancestral spirits. This mediation and its concomitant liminal power can be construed as a historically ordered progression in the development of the actor's professional career. Upon death, the actor is reborn as a crocodile prior to incorporation into the formless atemporal space of departed actors. His predetermined crocodilian rebirth decreases the symbolic distance between the here and now of a shared and cultured humanity and the unpredictability and danger of the natural world of wild beasts. Only Nuuraa and shamans are believed to have power-laden transmogrific abilities, bridging the nature-culture divide. All other people have to be content with being passive observers rather than active participants in the natural world. In short, the Nuuraa's life history can be represented as a unidirectional continuum that progresses from secular powerlessness to sacred power-filled status: Apprentice (secular)?&gt;[Initiation]?&gt;Nuuraa?&gt;crocodile?&gt;sacred ancestral spirits The mediation of opposites also occurs at the level of gendered experiences. The Nuuraa is biologically male and therefore culturally constructed by Kelantanese as masculine yet his theatrical training as a female impersonator allows him access to a gendered domain of experiential reality denied most other men. His inability to menstruate</page><page sequence="22">The Nuuraa Performer's Ritual Persona Kelantanese Thai Society 307 despite his ritual feminine guise ensures that the sacred purity of his genre's progenitors is neither negotiated nor breached. The experience of femininity is a necessary prerequisite to the achievement of ancestral recognition that allows for the successful preparation of love magic and construction of the seductive image. In so doing he allows for the reproduction of sacred power. As a liminal person, the Nuuraa symbolically disrupts the ordinary. Otherwise fixed classificatory systems in the social order are turned on their head with the creation of zones of uncertainty within the social structure of Kelantanese Thai society. His symbolic connection with the ancestors is integral to the effective functioning of the ritual complex. Nevertheless, his privileged reversal of the social order can and does make him the target and object of popular suspicion. It is this suspicion and its conceptualization that form the central theme of the numerous vernacular narratives (gossip and rumours) that permeate throughout Kelantanese Thai society. I heard many stories of how Nuuraa Khaeng and his apprentice Nuuraa Sao were spotted exhuming a grave to extract chin oil from the corpse, how Nuuraa Waan had used love magic to break up his sister's increasingly intimate relationship with a Malay, and how women eagerly presented their head-cloths to a Nuuraa to hang from his waist, thereby charging the clothes with an unbridled erotic potential. Some of the narratives have found their way into the popular oral discourses of non-Thais (urban Chinese and Malays) some of whom are unfamiliar with the nuuraa theatre itself. The widespread dissemination of these narratives contributes to a positive feedback loop that reinforces the power-filled image of the Nuuraa as a charmer par excellence. In a similar vein, Anderson has pointed out that in Java, a ruler's virility was a sign of his power. Hence the intimate details of Sukarno's private affairs were publicized as a political attempt at legitimizing his authority as a ruler.72 The past twenty years have witnessed the Malaysian government's cultural (reproduc tion of tradition through the appropriation and commodification of the Kelantanese Thai nuuraa as an essentialized and "traditional" Malay(sian) entertainment called menora (derived from the Thai Maanohraa), in the process displacing the genre's ritual and ethnic content.73 Some Kelantanese troupes have been sponsored by government organi zations and private foundations to perform abbreviated renderings of the nuuraa as part of "traditional" culture showcases in Kuala Lumpur and abroad. Aside from the usual "nuuraa circuit" of villages in Kelantan, Trengganu, and southern Thailand, Nuuraa Waan has brought the genre to Kuala Lumpur and the urban centres of Canada, Australia and Europe. Most Nuuraa are well-respected men and held in awe by Thai villagers due to their connections with the divine; they are often situated close to the apex of the village ritual structure. Thomas Fraser observed that amongst rural Pattani Malays there existed two forms of village authority.74 The kamnan, nominated by the Thai government, represented 72Ibid., p. 32. 73For an in-depth analysis of the recontextualizing of the Kelantanese Thai nuuraa as secular and Malay, see Kershaw, "A Little Drama". Peter Vandergeest and Paritta Chalermpow-Koanantakool, "The Southern Thai Shadowplay Tradition in Historical Context" {Journal of Southeast Asian Studies 24 [1993]: 307-329) have described the historical changes southern Thai shadow puppetry (Th. nang talung) has gone through after its definition as a "regional" and "traditional" art form by local intellectual elites and the national Thai government. 74Thomas Fraser, Fishermen of South Thailand: The Malay Villagers (Illinois: Waveland Press, 1984).</page><page sequence="23">308 Irving Chan Johnson the hegemonic discourse of an abstract-nation state centred in a culturally unfamiliar Bangkok. But it was the indigenous authority of the orang baik, senior members of the local community that was of greater significance to the everyday lives of villagers. Although I have not come across any Kelantanese Nuuraa who is a state appointed village head (M. penghulu; Th. naaj baan), possibly due to their low levels of formal education in government schools, the Nuuraa is recognized by Thais and Malays alike as a revered elder. His ritual authority stems from the power he derives from concentrating and mediating binary categories, a power that is objectified through the ability to magically manipulate the emotions of selected targets. Although nearly ninety years old, Nuuraa Sao is still consulted to predict the date of the annual ceremony for placating tutelary spirits (Th. waaj thaung). During his village's loy krathong festivities a few years ago, the renowned Nuuraa, decked in his theatrical regalia, sat on a float and was paraded around the district town as a celebration of Kelantanese Thai cultural identity. Roger Kershaw has highlighted the reverence Thais in the village of Baan Soemoerak in the jajahan of Pasir Puteh had for Nuuraa Nong. He pointed out that "[Nuuraa Nong] had never been a naaj baan [headman] but people stood in great awe of him [they spoke of their 'fear' and in some cases it went as far as 'fear' in the English sense] and they trusted in his power to prevent disorderliness among the youth and to impose peace on quarrelling neighbours."75 Despite the exalted ritual status of the Nuuraa within the Thai village, the nuuraa theatre is in decline faced with the onslaught of modern forms of entertainment that have found their way even to the "remotest" Thai settlement. Most Kelantanese Thai house holds are equipped with television sets and video recorders, signs of the increasing cosmopolitanism and affluence in part due to the lucrative nature of commercial tobacco cultivation. The decline of the Nuuraa is exacerbated in a political climate that is unsupportive and hostile to "traditional" performative genres. When I was doing my fieldwork in Kelantan in 1995, the nuuraa was banned by the opposition Islamic state government (PAS) for "un-Islamic" motifs.76 Official justification for the ban included the tabooed mingling of men and women on stage and non-Islamic rituals associated with the drama. The ban was slapped upon other popular genres as well, including the makyong and Malay shadow puppetry (M. wayang kulit), and has recently been extended to include Malay choral singing (M. dikir barat). Returning to Kelantan in June 1997, I noticed that the ban on the nuuraa had been relaxed, and a few performances were presented as part of Thai temple festivities. Not withstanding the state's official disapproval, annual nuuraa performances are enacted during a Chinese religious celebration and as part of a vow-fulfillment in a Thai temple. A Teacher-Homage ceremony conducted last year included trance possession sessions, ritual curing and nightly nuuraa performances. The three-night affair attracted a large crowd comprising locals, tourists, reporters and photographers. Kim Hock, a Chinese villager from Tumpat, remarked that the state government's sudden move to issue enter tainment licenses for the staging of nuuraa performances was politically motivated in 75Kershaw, "A Little Drama", p. 73. 76Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) came to power in Kelantan in 1990. The ban slapped on performing arts was part of a larger campaign to turn Kelantan into a model Islamic state within a secular Malaysia.</page><page sequence="24">The Nuuraa Performer's Ritual Persona Kelantanese Thai Society 309 order to win Thai votes in the upcoming general elections. But despite the recent increase in the number of performance opportunities, Nuuraa lamented that there is no continuity in the art form as it is difficult to obtain entertainment permits, and that there is a serious lack of new performers. Younger Kelantanese Thais prefer wage employment to becoming nuuraa actors. Nuuraa Waan's teenage son Eh Chaaj expressed interest in learning the nuuraa and its associated esoteric lore, but it was a secondary preoccupation for him. None of the Nuuraa I know have full-time apprentices, and most have retired from active performing due to their advanced years. The inevitable decline in the number of Nuuraa will predictably result in fewer love magicians in Kelantan. However, it is difficult to envision that the demand for the services of the love magician will fall.77 Nuuraa today are making the most of the lack in per formance opportunities through a commodification of their ritual status by practising the magical arts on a full-time basis, inadvertently displacing their social role as entertainers. Whereas in the past the Nuuraa travelled to distant communities to perform, today they frequently travel for the sole purpose of searching out and preparing love magic for a diverse clientele. This has brought high economic rewards, with some love medicines costing hundreds of ringgit depending on the intended result.78 The placing of a price tag on magical services is a recent innovation amongst Nuuraa. Traditionally they did not usually charge for love medicines, which were provided as a service to needy clients. But many have found this practice financially unprofitable, especially in a rural society encroached upon by capitalism. Nuuraa Waan pointed to his sleek black Proton Saga (a Malaysian-manufactured car) as testimony to his lucrative earnings as a love magician. He had also purchased a hand-held telephone for himself so that clients could reach him easily, and he insisted that non-Kelantanese clients must cover his travel budget and accommodation bills if he were to make out of state consul tations. He smiled as he compared his life-style with that of the non-Nuuraa villager who had to work for hours under the blazing sun on tobacco and vegetable plots, only to reap a meagre financial reward. Nuuraa Sao welcomed a steady stream of people hoping to affect the emotions of another despite the exorbitant rates charged for his magical services. Thus even though the nuuraa's future as popular entertainment seems bleak, the social recognition of these seductive mediators may appear self-perpetuating. 77Louis Golomb has argued that the demand for love magical services results primarily from the flexibility of Kelantanese Malay marriage patterns and the position of women within these unions. For further elaboration, see Golomb's Brokers of Morality. 78One Malaysian ringgit is approximately thirty US cents.</page></plain_text>
