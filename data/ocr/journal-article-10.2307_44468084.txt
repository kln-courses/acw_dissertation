Gauthier Office of Market Incentives NHTSA Washington, DC ABSTRACT The 35 mph frontal barrier crash Repeatability Test Program (RTP) conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) resulted from concerns over the significance of New Car Assessment Program data derived from a single crash test and the repeatability of that crash test data. To help identify and quantify, to the extent possible, the sources of variation, the agency initiated the RTP. The program consisted of a minimum of four frontal barrier impacts of 1982 Chevrolet Citations at three different test sites, and resulted in a total of fourteen tests. The fourteen identical make and model test vehicles were manufactured consecutively on the same production line in the same assembly plant in an attempt to achieve maximum possible uniformity. The NHTSA test sites were Calspan Corporation, Buffalo, New York; Dynamic Science Inc. , Phoenix Arizona; and the Transportation Research Center, East Liberty, Ohio. The RTP data was analyzed to examine data variability due to test facility, test instrumentation, test procedure, the test dummy and the test vehicle. The analysis also examined any correlation that existed within the various data results. BACKGROUND As a result of increased public concern over motor vehicle death and injury rates, damage levels, and repair costs, the Congress enacted Title II, "Automobile Consumer Information Study," of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act. This 1972 law requires the development and dissemination of comparative information on the crashworthiness, damageability, and repairability of motor vehicles. The foundation of Title II is the belief that if consumers have valid comparative information on these features of motor vehicles, they will use that information in their purchase decision. In turn, this would stimulate competition and design improvements in these areas among automotive manufacturers. From 1973 to 1979, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) conducted extensive feasibility studies of various methods of developing this comparative information. For crashworthiness, a number of sources were investigated, including accident data analyses and mathematical modeling, with crash testing for validation. All of the approaches which were investigated for developing comparative crashworthiness information for new motor vehicles were flawed for one or more reasons - for example, timeliness of the data, sample size, and missing critical data elements. In 1979, the agency established the experimental New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). The objective of the NCAP was to assess the feasibility of developing new vehicle crashworthiness information through measured performance. As designed, the program would provide consumers with information on how various motor vehicles compare under standardized, representative crash conditions. These test conditions were similar to those required by FMVSS Nos. 208, 212, 219, and 301-75, but the test speed was increased from 30 mph to 35 mph. The NCAP initially included 35 mph frontal barrier impacts, 35 mph rear impacts by a 4,000 pound moving barrier, and 35 mph frontal 30° 1.1024 0096-736X/85/9301-1024$02 • 50 Copyright 1985 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">oblique tests. By 1982, it was determined ' that the rear and oblique test configurations were not providing consumers with information which discriminated among vehicles. As a result, they were eliminated from the NCAP, and the program's resources were allocated to frontal tests only. All NCAP tests include instrumented anthropomorphic dummies in the driver and front seat passenger locations, which are properly seated and restrained by the vehicle's safety belt system. Measurements of crash forces to the dummies ' heads, chests, and femurs are measured in the tests. This comparative information is publicized through various consumer information channels. As a result of concerns over the significance of NCAP information based on a single crash test, the NHTSA undertook the Repeatability Test Program (RTP) to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of 35 mph frontal barrier crash tests. PURPOSE/DESIGN Since the inception of crash testing, safety researchers have been concerned with the repeatability of test results. Great strides have been made in improving all the aspects of testing - instrumentation, test dummies, and test procedures. Nevertheless, taken together with the vehicle itself, the variations in all these components, as well as chance factors, will result in some degree of variation in the measurements recorded on the test dummy during a crash test. Analysis of the dummy measurements in a series of crash tests allows one to quantify the degree of variation, as well as develop generalized statistical conclusions about crash test repeatability. Indeed, when the agency planned the Repeatability Test Program (RTP), the statistical implications of the program were carefully considered. The agency chose an experimental design which called for a total of twelve (12) tests - four (4) tests at each of three laboratories. This design would provide a useful estimate of within site variability, and a chance at estimating between site variability. It was recognized that the twelve test design would not, however, allow the statistical quantification and identification of the sources of variability. The 1982 Chevrolet Citation was chosen as the vehicle for the RTP because much was known about its crash performance. A 1980 Citation had been tested in the NCAP, and that test provided a driver Head Injury Criteria (HIC) of 845 and a passenger HIC of 623, along with Chest Resultant Accelerations of 48 g 's and 35 g 's for the driver and passenger, respectively. The agency had also conducted some R&amp;D-type testing of Citations. For example, in a 40 mph frontal barrier impact, a 1980 Citation had a driver HIC of 1,039 and a passenger HIC of 1,117, with Chest Resultant Accelerations of 60 for the driver and 38 for the passenger. Between the NCAP test and the R&amp;D tests, the Citation appeared to represent a vehicle with good crashworthiness characteristics. In order to insure that the vehicles were as identical as possible, the 1982 Citations were all assembled at GM 's Tarry town, New York, assembly plant during one shift. The vehicles were equipped identically - four-door sedans, four-cylinder engines, standard transmissions, no optional equipment, and identical colors and trim. The design of the RTP was to assess the repeatability (can crash test results be replicated at the same test site?) and reproducibility (can different test sites produce the same crash test results?). However, due to the large amount of overlapping variation that resulted within each test site, there was insufficient data to assess any variation that might have existed between test sites. Although statistical analysis of the data from this program cannot address the causes of the variability, these causes are of fundamental concern. By identifying and analyzing the causes of the variability, it may be possible to implement changes and improvements which will result in a reduction in dummy measurement variability. The purpose of this paper is to analyze various components of the crash tests conducted in the RTP, and assess, in a qualitative sense, what role they play in the variability of the dummy injury measurements. Through years of crash testing and related research, four basic components, in addition to uncontrolled or chance factors, which contribute to variability in dummy injury measurements have been identified: 1. The Test Facilities; 2. The Test Dummy; 3. The Test Procedure; and 4. The Test Vehicle. The specific contribution each of these can cause in overall dummy injury measurement variability depends on many factors, and cannot be given a unique characterization. Extensive computer analyses, utilizing mathematical models, laboratory evaluations, sled tests, and full-scale crash tests have all demonstrated 1.1025</page><page sequence="3">1.1026 J. M. MACHEY AND C. L. GAUTHIER that variations in these four components will cause variation in the dummy response measurements. After analyzing these four components as they apply in the RTP, the effects of reducing the variability on overall statistical conclusions will be discussed. Additionally, improvements in the agency's test procedure for conducting crash tests will be presented, and the reasons for them. ANALYSIS OF MAJOR VARIABLES The statistical design for assessing the RTP centered on a twelve-vehicle test series, i.e., four identical vehicle crash tests at each of three test sites with each test site using their own set of four dummies in the driver and passenger seating position. The vehicles were to be frontally crashed at 35 mph into a fixed barrier at 0°. The crash data examined, for statistical purposes, were the accelerations and loads experienced by the dummies during the crash event. The vehicles were assigned randomly to the three sites from the 21 vehicle pool and were to be tested in the same order. The test dummies and instrumentation were also selected randomly from what was available at each test site. The instrumentation and dummies were calibrated before and after each test and at the end of the test series. As stated previously, from a statistical perspective the program would not identify and quantify the components of variability in crash testing. In the course of the engineering analysis of the RTP data, some of these components were identified. However, it was not possible to quantify the amount each component contributes to the overall variability. Four components were identified: (a) the test facility; (b) the test dummy; (c) the test procedure; and (d) the test vehicle. TEST FACILITIES Although "reproducibility" (can different test sites produce the same crash test results?) was included in the RTP design, it was recognized that the within-site variation might not allow for a reproducibility assessment. Due to the overlapping variation that actually resulted within each test site, only overall and within site variation can be analyzed. It is not possible to assess the variability between test sites. An independent contractor, MGA Research Corporation, Buffalo, NY, was responsible for observing and summarizing the crash testing at the NHTSA test sites. The sites were Calspan Corporation (CAL), Buffalo, NY; Dynamic Science, Inc. (DSI), Phoenix, AZ; and Transportation Research Center (TRC), East Liberty, OH. MGA observed the vehicle preparation, procedural compliance, test instrumentation, test dummy positioning, and the conduct of the test. Each test site employed high quality instrumentation amplifiers to condition the measured sensor outputs. Data channel calibration consisted of recording zero and calibration levels both prior to and following each test. The recorded test data is played back, digitized, and then processed in a digital computer to produce a data tape and output plots of the test data for analysis. Impact velocity measurements of the vehicle were made just prior to impact. The methods used by the test sites were to record the time interval over a given distance with carbon rods or tape switches. All of the test sites collected photographic data with high speed cameras and all had similar views to facilitate a comparison of vehicle and dummy kinematic analysis. All of the test sites appeared to have equipment and capabilities which exceed all minimum levels of performance required to conduct vehicle crash tests. However, there is some acknowledged degree of variability that exists within each test site in the area of data collection and processing. In order to quantify and develop improvements to reduce this variability an instrumentation analysis program was established in 1980. A signal generator was developed and taken to each test laboratory to examine their data acquisition and reduction equipment. The Test Site Instrumentation Study, completed in 1981 by MGA Research Corporation, reviewed the data acquisition and reduction practices at fifteen crash and sled testing facilities which perform vehicle tests for NHTSA. Repeatable signals were input into each test facility's data acquisition system. The signals were recorded and the results analyzed with emphasis on the sensitivity of Head Injury Criteria (HIC), maximum accelerations, and time shift variations. Two different acceleration pulses from a 35 mph barrier crash test are shown in Figure 1. These pulses (numbers 1 and 2) were used as inputs in performing HIC calculations at each facility.</page><page sequence="4">CRASH TEST 1.1027 Dummy Head Result Waveforms 400 r- 300 - ~V) b c o % 200 - © © u o &lt; 100 - °0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 Time (sec) (xlOt - *&gt; ) No. 1 400 I- 300 - 'w b c o ~ 200 - CO © © 1«.

The time shifts observed are of a magnitude that further action should be considered at the laboratories. MGA conclusions regarding HIC and time shift are as follows: "The rather significant variations in hIC values determined in this study appear to be primarily due to differences in facility equipment and practice rather than differences in software calculation routines. Although variations uncovered in the study are believed to be quite significant, it is felt that through more stringent practices, variations in the order of plus and minus three percent in HIC values should be achieved among all facilities. Hence, an order of magnitude reduction from the observed variation, is believed to be achievable. Note, a three percent variation is slightly less than the average differences recorded between individual channels at any given facility. "</page><page sequence="5">1.1028 J. M. MACHEY AND C. L. GAUTHIER "Time shifts in data responses in the order of 10 msec, were not uncommon among the facilities. Differences of this magnitude are indeed significant for crash test data where the entire event is of the order of 100 msec. At this point, it is not clear why these different magnitudes exist; however, it is apparent that there does not exist redundant procedures at most facilities in order to insure high confidence in the time base. In addition, because facilities use different techniques and sampling rates during the analogue to digital conversion process, it is not possible without considerable more study, to fully account for these observed time base differences. " The dummy response values (HIC and chest gfs) varied for all of the vehicles tested, however, when comparing the mean dummy response data from site to site, there is some consistency. The HIC and Chest G responses were highest in the test results produced by TRC, and lowest for those at Calspan. It appears that the test sites can produce some variability and as reported in the MGA study, instrumentation differences can produce as much as 10 percent variation in HIC values. One topic which was not examined at the test sites was the environmental (temperature, humidity) effect on dummy responses. It is not known what effect this would have on dummy response values. However, the dummies were maintained at the required temperature and humidity prior to testing at the NHTSA laboratories. TEST DUMMY The Part 572 dummies which were used in the RTP were calibrated before and after each test and at the end of the test series by the NHTSA test laboratories. A total of four dummies were used at each laboratory. The dummies were randomly chosen from the test site pool and assigned a seating position, i.e., driver or passenger. If a dummy was randomly used as a driver in the first vehicle test, then it became a passenger in the second vehicle test. The dummies were calibrated per the Part 572 Performance Calibration Procedure. This procedure requires conformance of the dummy's physical measurements, mounting and calibration of triaxial head and chest accelerometers, installation of load cells in the femurs, and conducting a head drop test, neck bending test, abdominal compression test, lumbar flexion test, chest impact test and knee impact tests. The dummy respnse head drop test specification for peak resultant acceleration ranges from 210 to 260 g's. In the pendulum tests, the head rotation angle requirement is 63 degrees to 73 degrees. Figure 4 is a graphical display of the pretest calibration results of the peak G data. All of the dummies were within the requirements of Part 572 prior to the conduct of the vehicle crash test. The logical question was whether any correlation between dummy calibration response and dummy responses in the actual tests existed. Based upon analysis performed by the agency, there is no correlation between the calibration values and the head injury criteria values of those dummies in the test environment. Figure 4 Upon completion of the RTP, all of the dummies were examined and calibrated at the Transportation Research Center. The intent was to determine if any significant dummy differences would be uncovered by examining the dummies at one laboratory thereby reducing any differences due to various laboratories. The results of the physical examination revealed that some of the dummies did not meet some of the Part 572 dimensional specifications, such as seating height. Five of the dummies had seating height dimensions that ranged from 35.25 to 35.89 inches. The specification is 35.6 to 35.8 inches. In addition, two dummies from DSI had cracked necks. It is not known if this occurred during the RTP testing or during usage in tests following the RTP. The preliminary analysis does not indicate any correlation between the dummy calibrations and the crash test measurements.</page><page sequence="6">CRASH TEST 1.1029 A significant component of the crash event, in terms of dummy response, is the impact of the dummy's head with the steering column assembly, the rotation of the dummy head and torso and passenger dummy head to knee contact.

The information presented in Figure 5 illustrates that in different tests the dummy experienced different head strike locations with the steering wheel rim. The various head contact areas with the steering rim/hub as shown in Figures 6 and 7 appears to be partially due to random steering column movement in the X-Z plan. The driver dummy, as seen in Figures 8 and 9, was observed to rotate as much as 45° about the belt system in some tests and experienced no rotation in other tests. The upper torso rotation about the seat belt could be due to belt placement about the torso, or the result of vehicle structure deformation causing the legs to pivot the dummy about its buttocks. Figure 6 Figure 7</page><page sequence="7">1.1030 J- M* MACHEY AND C. L. GAUTHIER Figures 8 and 9 illustrate various degrees of rotation of the passenger dummy about the belt system. This could be caused by the same factors as stated for the driver dummy. In some cases, the passenger dummy head contacted the right knee as shown in Figure 8. This appears to be a result of placement of the right foot and random floor pan buckling which caused the right knee to rise and result in head to knee contact. The interaction of the floor pan and right foot could also contribute to the dummy's upper torso rotation. Figure 8 Figure 9 The variability due to the dummy is not quantifiable for these tests. The laboratories performed the calibration test as required and there appears to be no correlation of calibration data to dummy response results in the vehicle crash event. The dummy head contacts with hard objects produced the highest peak accelerations and resultant HIC's. The vehicle dummy kinematics could be affected by vehicle structure deformation. TEST PROCEDURES As stated previously, all of the NHTSA test sites followed Laboratory Procedure for Vehicle Assessment, IP-212-02. The primary focus of the procedure is dummy placement in the test vehicle and seat belt positioning. These are considered critical elements in affecting occupant response. MGA Research Corporation observed the following in their report titled, "Crash Test Repeatability Program - Site Visits, 1983: " "Although the individual facilities adhered to IP-212-02 regarding dummy placement within the test vehicle, the following differences in technique were observed and are felt to possibly affect test repeatability. Different techniques were used at the test laboratory to develop and apply the various forces required to position the test dummies in the specified seating position. Due to the use of both mechanical and also manually applied forces to position the test devices, there appear to be variations that can occur in the installation of the test devices. The test procedure requires that the dummy be lifted until the buttocks no longer contact the seat cushion. However, the actual method of attaching to the dummy during the lifting phase is not defined. Laboratories employed either a lift sling that supported the dummy below the buttocks or around the chest. The positioning forces that are applied to the pelvic and chest areas of the dummy were also applied either manually or with constant pressure controlled cylinders. It appears that the use of pressure controlled cylinders allows for a more repeatable installation." The placement of the dummy's feet is also critical and the test procedure discusses this issue. For example, regarding the passenger dummy, the procedure states: "If the feet cannot be positioned flat on the toeboard, they are set perpendicular to the lower leg and placed as far forward as possible with the heels</page><page sequence="8">CRASH TEST 1.1031 resting on the floorpan." The intent of the statement is for the foot placement to be on the floorpan or as close to it as possible. However, the statement is somewhat vague, and in an effort to maintain parallel femurs some feet were placed on the wheel housing projection in the passenger compartment. This placement could cause the right knee to raise higher than the left during the test and possibly result in head-to-knee contact. Following dummy positioning, the test procedure specifies the correct procedure for safety belt positioning. "Fasten the safety belt in position using directions supplied in the vehicle owner's manual. At each retractor in the system, feed as much belt as possible into the retractor by hand. When all excessive slack is taken out of the belt system, release the belt. Only the amount of slack released by the retractor should be allowed to remain in the system." The procedure does not specify belt tension requirements and it probably varied from site to site, however no slack was observed in any of the test vehicles. MGA observed the following: "The belt restraints were fitted around the test dummies following the instructions outlined in the owner's manual at the three NHTSA test contractors. " "After the belts were positioned around the dummies, tape was used to support the shoulder belt load cells to the roof of the car to prevent the weight of the load cell from introducing additional slack into the restraint." The placement of the shoulder belt on the upper torso is not specified in the procedure and as presented in Figure 8 , the dummy rotated in the X-Y plane about the shoulder belt differently from test to test. A safety belt positioning and tension procedure should be examined to explore methods of specifying the appropriate placement of the shoulder belt about the upper torso. The test procedure does not appear to be specific enough in regard to how the dummies are positioned in the vehicle seating position and in the manner in which forces are applied to the dummy during settling. It is not known how this affects the final position, nor the effect of the dummy position on resultant dummy responses. Improved approaches should be examined and considered for future testing. The foot placement in vehicles with compound floorpans, i.e., wheel housing intrusion, must be examined and consideration given to the variations that may exist and how to place the feet without introducing unnatural resultant dummy kinematics. VEHICLE Variations in the vehicle both in terms of dummy seating position, safety belt positioning, and vehicle response during the crash can have an effect on dummy kinematics and response measurements. In an effort to determine some of the vehicle variations, the identically equipped 1982 Chevrolet Citations were examined, weighed, and measured upon completion of assembly. To preclude an incorrect setting at any of the laboratories prior to testing, the seats were set in the mid-seat track position and welded at the assembly plant. The vehicles were then randomly chosen and shipped to the participating laboratories. Visual inspection confirmed that the vehicles were identical with respect to vehicle components. The vehicle items measured were the "H" point location of the driver and passenger seating position, the steering wheel location and angle, and the left and right side "B" post door striker location. These measurements are referenced to the front seat mounting bolt, referenced as the No. 1 fiducial mark, and are accurate to +.1 inch. Figure 10 illustrates the "H" point locations for the driver and they are approximately one-quarter of an inch rearward of the passenger. "H" Point Location 1" Front ģ** • V - ^ Driver 1" •&lt; • .

The passenger side points are clustered together, but greater variation of the driver striker location exists, especially vehicle 18, which was significantly rearward and higher than the others. It is important to note that striker location is dependent on the "B" pillar location which effects the "D" ring location and shoulder belt positioning across the chest.

These column angles varied between 21.5° and 23.5°, over a 9 percent difference.

An examination of the vehicle engine cradle revealed that different load paths developed during the crash event. As presented in Figure 14, the bending at the cutout of the engine cradle members varied. In some vehicles, both left and right sides buckled, some only the left and others only the right member buckled. Vehicle 9 is an example of a vehicle which appears to have no bending at the driver's side cradle member cutout and was the only vehicle which had forward motion of the steering column as illustrated</page><page sequence="10">CRASH TEST 1.1033 in Figure 18. Vehicle 14 had very slight bending at the drivers side cradle member cutout, however its steering column moved rearward.

Weld failures also occurred in the floor pan, some welds pulled parent metal, others failed at the weld joint. Because of the greater range in the driver HIC1 s which were recorded, and realizing the importance of the steering column location at the time of driver contact, the steering column assembly motion was analyzed photographically and its motion recorded in the X-Z planes. Figures 17 thru 19 graphically demonstrate the movement of the steering column from the onset of the crash (barrier contact) to the time of dummy contact with either the steering wheel hub or rim. This irregular motion of the column and its location at the time of dummy impact vastly effects the point and duration of contact of the driver dummy's head with the steering wheel hub or rim and the velocity at which the driver is moving forward. Obviously, this can affect the resultant HIC.</page><page sequence="11">1.1034 j. M. MACHEY AND C. L. GAUTHIER 2 I 1 1 1 1 I I I CALSPAN Tests £ £ 1 © 13^ E ® I / « 20^.

In an effort to better understand the role of the safety belt system and its influence on dummy kinematics and responses. A review of previous research revealed that sled tests had been conducted by Transportation Research Center (TRC) in 1979 which demonstrated that shoulder belt placement on the upper torso can effect chest g's, shoulder belt loads and HIC. The results demonstrate the importance of shoulder belt location and clearly show that dummy shoulder rotation is substantially reduced when the belt is placed two inches above the center of gravity (CG) and is nominally larger (as compared to belt placement at the CG) when placed two inches below the CG. The average rotation of the shoulders for belt placement on and about the CG was as follows: 10° above the CG, 51° on the CG, and 69° below the CG. The mean response values of the thorax are at a minimum with the shoulder belt located at the CG. The head response values are higher with the belt placed above and on the CG. However, the lowest mean HIC value appears with the belt below on the CG. The shoulder belt loading is highest for belt locations at the CG of the thorax, somewhat lower when the belt is below the CG, and is even lower when the belt is above the CG. In summary, the four characteristics of the vehicle's structural response, and the differences in dummy/safety belt interacton all displayed signficant variability. However, no correlations were evident between these vehicle responses and the HIC measurements. Nevertheless, we must consider that previous safety research has demonstrated that these structural behavior characteristics do have influence on dummy HIC values, possibly of major proportions. STATISTICAL CONCLUSIONS A statistical analysis of the RTP dummy responses has been performed and the results were reported in the Statistical Analysis of Crash Test Variability. It is important to reflect on the results of this analysis and their impact on other crash test results. The pooled standard deviation (SD) of all three laboratories in the RTP for the driver HIC is 137 and for the passenger HIC is 77 for the 1982 Citation vehicles in 35 mph frontal crashes. Since the HIC values ranged from 495 to 954 for the driver, and from 542 to 793 for the passenger, the differences in range and standard deviation</page><page sequence="12">CRASH TEST 1.1035 for the driver and passenger are noteworthy. The only difference between the two seating positions is the presence of the steering column assembly on the driver's side. It certainly appears that the steering column assembly has a dramatic effect on the HIC. Examining the Citation's steering column motion and driver's head contact points, it is not unexpected to obtain these range differences. These values represent the dummy responses in the laboratory crash tests of 1982 Chevrolet Citation's and should not be utilized to make statistical conclusions for all model vehicles. The danger in generalizing is that standard deviation of the other vehicles could be substantially different. CORRELATION BETWEEN DUMMY RESPONSE AND CRASH TEST VARIABLES - MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS The previous discussion indicates that dummy responses (HIC, Chest g, etc.) vary considerably from one crash test to another. Some of this variation (how much is unknown) can be attributed to the dummy's themselves. A substantial portion is believed to be attributable to non-dummy sources. It would be useful to not only identify the sources of variation, but also to quantify each source's contribution to the overall dummy variability. Once this has been accomplished, one might begin to better understand the variation of dummy responses from test to test. The most obvious sources to consider are dummy calibration measurements, and vehicle dynamic responses and vehicle static measurements. Ideally, some of these variables would account for almost all of the variability in a particular dummy response. An attempt was made by the University of Virginia to identify such variables for explaining HIC and Chest g variability using the RTP data. Dummy responses were treated as dependent variables, and all other measurements as independent variables. The goal was to identify the variable or variables which produced the highest R-squared value. Using regression techniques, various combinations of independent variables were tested. The overall outcome did not show any significant R values. Further analysis may be warranted to determine if correlation between dummy measures and vehicle responses exist. OTHER CRASH TEST RESULTS The agency has obtained vehicle crash test data from Volvo for a series of 35 mph frontal barrier impacts they conducted on a 1983 Volvo 760 GLE. The vehicles were crash tested basically following NHTSA test procedure IP-212. The tests were conducted at two laboratories, MIRA and Volvo, and contained instrumented Part 572 dummies. The dummy response HIC results are as follows : MIRA Driver Passenger 945 729 697 890 820 990 Volvo Driver Passenger 857 715 1004 702 869 755 860 752 The calculated mean and standard deviation for the MIRA and Volvo test data are as follows: Mean Standard Deviation Mira Driver 821 124 Mira Passenger 870 132 Volvo Driver 898 71 Volvo Passenger 731 27 The differences in average HIC numbers between the MIRA and Volvo test laboratories may be due to procedural , vehicle, dummy and/or facility differences or combination of these and other sources. Examination of the Volvo data reveals that it is a data set with less range and lower standard deviation than the RTP results. Since the variances are significantly different for the passenger HIC 's as determined by an F test (statistical test) no pooled standard deviation was calculated for the MIRA and Volvo dummy responses. NHTSA, as an additional data point, tested a 1983 Volvo 760 in the 1983 New Car Assessment Program and the driver and passenger HIC 's were 791 and 778, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The RTP results analysis have revealed potential causes for the variability for each of the following major items.</page><page sequence="13">1.1036 J. M. MACHEY AND C. L. GAUTHIER Test Facilities o Each facility employed a different technique when placing dummies in the proper vehicle seating position, i.e., various support mechanisms and force application methods were employed during the dummy positioning and settling procedure, o Different equipment and calibration methods are being employed by each laboratory to establish time zero and the film timing reference, o The laboratory instrumentation test site study showed that using the same electronic data input, the laboratories produced HIC numbers which varied from site to site by approximately 10% for the three channels examined. Test Dummies o The physical condition of some of the dummies were not within the specifications for the Part 572 dummy, specifically the dummy seated height dimensions, o All of the dummies met the dynamic test requirements of the Part 572 calibration procedure. Test Procedures o The test procedure, concerning how to position a dummy in a designated seat position requires further clarification. For example, the procedure should specify type of fixtures to be used, and how to apply forces to the dummy during settling in the seat, o A shortcoming of the test procedure for foot placement was discovered in this program. The procedure permitted differences in foot placement, and should be revised to encompass various floorpan/ wheel housing variations, o The procedure for belt installation references the manufacturer's owner's manual. This can result in different interpretations regarding applied belt tension (slack) that results with a seated dummy, o There is no reference in the procedure for placement of the shoulder belt about the upper torso. This permits the belt to be placed randomly within limits on the chest and can result in upper torso rotation about the shoulder belt. Test Vehicle o The peak dynamic crush varied from vehicle to vehicle with a range of 27.5 inches to 32.0 inches, a difference of 4.5 inches, o The steering column movement in the X-Z plane varied from vehicle to vehicle and resulted in various driver head to rim/hub contact points and times, o The buckling of the floorpan in the passenger compartment can possibly affect dummy kinematics. o The engine cradle member bending varied due to different load and force paths produced during the crash event, o The dimensions of the vehicles varied for those items measured, such as, steering wheel angle and location, "H" point location, and front door striker location. It is not known what manufacturing tolerances are expected for these items, o The four characteristics of the vehicle's structural response, and the differences in dummy/safety belt interaction all displayed significant variability. However, no correlations were evident between these vehicle responses and the HIC measurements. Nevertheless, we must consider that previous safety research has demonstrated that these structural behavior characteristics do have influence on dummy HIC values, possibly of major proportions. RECOMMENDATIONS o Further examinations and analyses are needed of the instrumentaton, data acquistion and processing equipment at each laboratory and consideration should be given to providing them with signal generators for verfication purposes. o Consider amending Laboratory Procedure for Vehicle Assessment IP-212-02 in the following areas: (1) Thoroughly and graphically explain the dummy seating and force application procedures for placing the dummy in the vehicle; (2) Establish seat belt tension values in addition to referencing the vehicle owners manual when installing the belt system on the dummy ; (3) Explain clearly the position of the dummy's feet within the passenger compartment floorpan/wheel area with consideration given to various differences in vehicle floorpan design; (4) Measure the location of the shoulder belt with reference to a dummy component, and (5) Measure the dimension of the dummy to steering column rim/hub and record the steering column angle. o Perform photographic analysis of the steering column motion for all NCAP tests. o Implement a dummy mangement program to insure that all test dummies are maintained to the required specification.</page><page sequence="14">CRASH TEST 1.1037 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors wish to thank the following personnel for their contribution to this paper: The testing laboratories that participated in the RTP, William A.
