<plain_text><page sequence="1">TERMINAL SATIRE AND JUDE THE OBSCURE BY AARON MATZ I. MOSTLY THE SATIRISTS Two words haunted Thomas Hardy in the years he was plotting and composingJude the Obscure. The first of these, satire, litters his note- books and diaries of the era, and it appears with remarkable frequency in the finished novel itself. The earliest example arrives when Jude receives Sue's letter stating her decision to marry his former school- master, Phillotson. The letter is brutally short; Sue is so formal that she signs her complete name. Hardy then shifts to Jude's reaction: Jude staggered under the news; could eat no breakfast; and kept on drinking tea because his mouth was so dry. Then presently he went back to his work and laughed the usual bitter laugh of a man so confronted. Everything seemed turning to satire. And yet, what could the poor girl do? he asked himself: and felt worse than shedding tears.1 The sentence in question seems deliberately vague, as if Jude's paranoid sense of victimhood cannot place the source of the cruel joke to which he has been subjected. The satire is on Jude. But from what or from whom does this satire issue-from Sue, or Phillotson, or God? This question may be simply another useless effort to pursue the elusive riddle of Jude the Obscure, which is the problem of knowing why Jude Fawley must suffer so intensely and relentlessly. The satirist in question must be elusive. If the true cause of Jude's misery were known, he might be in the position of overcoming it, and such a promise is impossible amidst the bleakness of this novel. In this sense the agent of the satire on Jude is like the "President of the Immortals" who concludes his sport with the heroine at the close of Tess of the d'Urbervilles, or the "sinister intelligence bent on punishing" Henchard in The Mayor of Casterbridge-these abstractions are similarly beyond human reach, and equally cruel.2 But in Jude the Obscure this abstraction consistently takes the same name: Hardy insists on calling it satire. When things go wrong for Jude-when Sue causes him pain, or when he is denied a reprieve from ELH 73 (2006) 519-547 0 2006 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 519</page><page sequence="2">the vicissitudes of Christminster-he routinely imagines his misfortune in the guise of an immense conspiracy of mockery. So when Jude re- ceives a subsequent letter from Sue asking if he would give her away at the wedding, Hardy writes that "if Sue had written that in satire, he could hardly forgive her"; after Jude and Sue overhear two clergymen speaking in hushed tones outside their home, Jude cries, "[W]hat a sat- ire their talk is on our importance to the world!"; and even Sue herself begins to imagine things in the same terms, begging Jude in the midst of their deterioration, "Don't satirize me: it cuts like a knife!" or, pages later, "Don't crush all the life out of me by satire and argument!" (J, 205, 424, 435).3 Satire may not be the word most readers of this novel would expect at such moments; we observe the lashings endured by the blighted couple but struggle to find any humor behind them, as a satire might suggest. But as the peculiar word keeps surfacing, and as we grow strangely accustomed to it, we begin to wonder if it signals a larger pattern in the substructure of Hardy's final novel. Jude the Obscure was the product of the early 1890s: the germ of the novel can be traced back to 1888, when Hardy recorded in his diary his plan for "a short story of a young man-'who could not go to Oxford'-His struggles and ultimate failure," but he did not set down to write it until the turn of the decade.4 The Early Life of Thomas Hardy also testifies that in 1890, after finishing Tess and just before beginning Jude, Hardy immersed himself in a particular course of reading: In the latter part of the year, having finished adapting Tess of the d'Urbervilles for the serial issue, he seems to have dipped into a good many books-mostly the satirists: including Horace, Martial, Lucian, "the Voltaire of Paganism", Voltaire himself, Cervantes, Le Sage, Molikbre, Dryden, Fielding, Smollett, Swift, Byron, Heine, Carlyle, Thackeray, Satires and Profanities by James Thomson, and Weismann's Essays on Heredity. (E, 301) It can be dangerous to seek too much significance in a novelist's reading at a particular point in his career: those books will often have little to do with his own writing. But Hardy's immersion in "mostly the satirists" cannot be ignored in light of the furious book that was to emerge from these first years of the 1890s. The two volumes of The Early Life and The Later Years of Hardy-published under the name of his wife, but conventionally assumed to be from Hardy's own pen-are notable for their concision; there are few allusions that stray from the central project of charting the evolution of the artist's consciousness in chronological relation to his work. It is unlikely, that is, that a nod 520 Terminal Satire and Jude the Obscure</page><page sequence="3">to "the satirists" would have found its way into the autobiography if it did not have some reason to be there. It is significant, too, that this is the only such instance of generic classification in the Life. When Hardy provides other catalogues of his readings, they are typically a farrago of classical literature, English verse and prose, and philoso- phy; nowhere else does he choose his books around a single tradition or mode. Hardy's own remark that he embarked on this reading just after completing Tess is no less noteworthy. These satirists seemed to arrive at a pivotal moment in his career; something would be quite different afterwards. There is in fact evidence of Hardy's interest in formal satire throughout his private writings of this era. At the beginning of 1890, according to The Early Life, he was "looking over old Punches" and was "struck with the frequent wrong direction of satire ... when seen by the light of later days" (E, 293). It seems that Hardy was far more impressed by Voltaire than by Punch. His Literary Notebooks from this same period contain jottings from two Voltaire-related works from the previous two decades: T. B. Macaulay's Critical and Historical Essays (1879), from which he excerpted passages about Voltaire and Freder- ick the Great; and John Morley's Voltaire, first published in 1872 and reprinted in 1886. From the first book, Hardy fixated on Macaulay's titles for the French satirist: "the great scoffer-mocker-Voltaire"; "the greatest puller-down, both of bad &amp; good-Voltaire." From Morley's monograph, the future author of Jude the Obscure extracted longer passages for his notebooks, focusing mostly on Voltaire's attacks on Christianity. Hardy cited Morley's remarks on "the strange &amp; sin- ister method of [Voltaire's] assault upon religion wh. we of a later day watch with wondering eyes" and noted his inclusion of Voltaire in the category of "persons with something of a vested interest in darkness."5 For Morley-and for the Hardy who was reading him in 1890-supreme among Voltaire's achievements was his role as truth- teller, freed from the constraints of polite society. "Such a liberation of the human mind as Voltairism" quotes Hardy from Morley; and it is hard to ignore, even in the fragmented extracts that make up the notebooks, Hardy's veneration for a writer he was coming to regard as an authentic literary ancestor.6 The immediate consequences of such reading and note-taking for Jude the Obscure may be obvious. The profound religious skepticism of Hardy's novel surely owes a great debt to Voltaire. Hardy even casts Sue in the position of religious freethinker in the French tradi- tion-on two occasions Jude calls her by Voltaire's name. When Sue Aaron Matz 521</page><page sequence="4">offers to create for Jude a "new New Testament" by cutting and pasting the Epistles and Gospels into their proper chronological order, Jude protests that she is "quite Voltairean"; two chapters later, when Sue declares her refusal to consider marriage a sacrament, he cries: "Sue, you are terribly cutting when you like to be-a perfect Voltaire!" (j, 182, 199-200). If Jude complains elsewhere about the designs of an elusive satirist, some agent responsible for the miseries with which he is so relentlessly cursed, he also identifies his beloved cousin as a sort of satirist-in-miniature, a Voltaire figure as capable of cruelty as she is of blasphemy. The book's terror hovers between a grand satire from without, something cosmic acting upon Jude and Sue together, and a narrower satire from within, issuing most often from Sue, but which is no less ruthless in its grip on the title character. The first may seem rather fantastical, perhaps out of place within the bounds of normal realist fiction; the second, involving as it does the clash of a man and a woman within the confines of a narrow society, is positioned squarely in the tradition of the nineteenth-century realist novel. I began by claiming that two words haunted Hardy in the era of Jude the Obscure. The other is realism, a term which on the surface seemed to vex him as much as satire intrigued him. According to The Early Life, in August 1890-just as he was immersing himself in "mostly the satirists"--Hardy recorded these reflections in his journal: Art is a disproportioning-(i.e., distorting, throwing out of proportion)-of realities, to show more clearly the features that matter in those realities, which, if merely copied or reported inventorially, might possibly be observed, but would more probably be overlooked. Hence 'realism' is not Art. (E, 299) Hardy would not allow himself to belong to a movement that pre- tended to represent the world in documentary terms without-as he saw it-the mediation of a dominant poetic sensibility. The following year Hardy again voiced his objection to the word realism and the school that bore its name, this time in the essay "The Science of Fic- tion," which he contributed to a symposium in the April 1891 issue of the New Review: Realism is an unfortunate, an ambiguous word, which has been taken up by literary society like a view-halloo, and has been assumed in some 522 Terminal Satire and Jude the Obscure</page><page sequence="5">places to mean copyism, and in others pruriency, and has led to two classes of delineators being included in one condemnation.7 By the final decade of the century, Hardy understood that realism had come to dominate the debates in England about the techniques and uses of fiction: this awareness is the source of his vehement opposi- tion to the term. One participant in these debates whom Hardy read particularly closely was his friend John Addington Symonds, whose Essays Speculative and Suggestive (1890) are cited extensively in the notebooks; Hardy read them in May 1891. Symonds was as skeptical of the "realist" project as Hardy. The realist, according to Symonds-and in a passage later excerpted in Hardy's notebooks-"seeks to ignore the fact that art must aim at selection." The phrase could just as easily be Hardy's own. Symonds described realism, with considerable irony, as "truth to actual fact." This line also is cited in Hardy's notes from the period.8 But Symonds's writings of the era, like Hardy's, train one eye on the problem of realism while keeping the other focused on theories of satire. The chapter of Essays Speculative and Suggestive that provided Hardy with such reflections on realism was called "Realism and Ideal- ism"; it considered both literature and painting. Only three chapters later came a sort of companion essay, "Caricature, The Fantastic, the Grotesque," in which Symonds studied literary characterization in relation to caricature, obscenity, and satire. Despite this division into discrete chapters, Symonds's collection retains the focus of a unified argument, and so he is careful to relate his discussion of satirical cari- cature back to his earlier theme, the question of realism: The real aim of caricature is to depreciate its object by evoking contempt or stirring laughter, when the imaginative rendering of the person is an unmistakable portrait, but defects are brought into relief which might otherwise have escaped notice. Instead therefore of being realistic, this branch of art must be reckoned as essentially idealistic.9 This central question of the relative realism of satirical art was to re- verberate incessantly in Jude the Obscure. Hardy seemed to take away two major lessons from his reading of Symonds: a skeptical frustra- tion with the concept of realism as it was understood in late Victorian England, and an increased attention to the relation of realist fiction to the tradition of satire-a tradition in which he had already been ensconced for the previous year. In the same notebook pages as his Aaron Matz 523</page><page sequence="6">citation of "realism-'truth to actual fact,'" Hardy thus jotted these fragments from Symonds: "[Sometimes] characterization borders upon caricature. In all cases it implies a willing sacrifice of superfl. beauty for the sake of force &amp; uncompromising veracity"; and, a few entries later, "For examples of satire = Archilochus &amp; Aristophanes, Juv. &amp; Persius, Rabelais, &amp; Regnier, Cervantes &amp; Swift, Dryden &amp; Pope, Heine &amp; V. Hugo."'0 This catalogue from 1891 is of course strikingly reminiscent of the "mostly the satirists" reading list from the previous year. These were the writers who occupied Hardy as he turned from Tess of the d'Urbervilles to Jude the Obscure. It is no accident that this struggle with these two interpenetrating ideas-a struggle so exemplary of late Victorian literature-would define Thomas Hardy's last novel in particular. Despite his reluctance to accept realism as a name for his own fiction, it is hard to ignore that Jude the Obscure owes more than any of his previous works to that tradition. Jude does not fit easily into the pastoral mold of ear- lier fictions like Under the Greenwood Tree or A Pair of Blue Eyes; it does not share the comic lightness that characterizes The Hand of Ethelberta or much of The Woodlanders; it does not depend as heavily upon the improbable coincidences that fuel the plots of The Return of the Native and The Mayor of Casterbridge. More than any other Hardy novel it exposes both hero and reader to the brutal facts of real experience. Jude is mostly devoid of esoteric Wessex folklore; it leaves behind the consoling solaces of rustic life as soon as Jude sets off for Christminster. In its arc of promise and disillusionment set against a backdrop that for Hardy is relatively urban, in its story of utter failure in love and profession, it has a tendency to recall Illusions perdues or L'Education sentimentale more closely than Hardy's earlier novels. But this realism coexists awkwardly with the strong influences of Jonathan Swift, Voltaire, and Satires and Profanities. Jude the Obscure exists at the remote frontier of Victorian realism, where the detachment of the novelist blurs into the scourge of the satirist, who forfeits any semblance of objectivity in the interest of fury and abuse. "There are limits to realism," Edmund Gosse wrote two years before Jude was published, "and they seem to have been readily discovered by the realists themselves."" Jude the Obscure is a testament to the accuracy of Gosse's judgment. 524 Terminal Satire and Jude the Obscure</page><page sequence="7">II. PREPOSITIONAL SATIRE Nowhere in Hardy's fiction is the influence of satire-or the invoca- tion of its name-more prominent than in Jude the Obscure. But Jude is in fact one of two focal points of satire in the larger Hardy corpus. The other is his verse cycle Satires of Circumstance, first published in 1911, his only work to invoke the genre in its title. In 1914 this was subsumed into a considerably larger collection, entitled Satires of Circumstance, Lyrics and Reveries, which featured no fewer than one hundred poems, among them "Channel Firing," "The Convergence of the Twain," and "God's Funeral": all in the first rank of his verse. In this larger collection the cycle Satires of Circumstance itself constitutes the final part. Each of its fifteen poems is short, between two and five stanzas. They all describe an ironic situation: some scenario in which a character does not know, or only learns too late, something that would change utterly his perspective on his own circumstances. In the second "satire," for example, a preacher mesmerizes his congregation from the pulpit, then retires to the vestry where he thinks no one can see him. One of his Bible students, hoping to speak with him, sees him behind the door he thought he had closed. But her "idol" is reenact- ing "Each pulpit gesture in deft dumb-show / That had moved the congregation so": the seemingly authentic display of piety from the pulpit was merely a performance.12 The first, fourth, fifth, and tenth satires all concern the harsh recognition that a man or woman has chosen the wrong spouse; the lurking presence of a different lover is an unforgiving reminder of an earlier mistake. Three other satires take place at a grave. In the third poem, a girl tells her lover that her now-deceased aunt had been giving her money to pay for her headstone upon her death; the lovers decide to spend the money on a dance that night instead. The sixth satire tells the story of two women arguing over whose son is buried in a particular plot. Another voice-"the man of the cemetery"-tells us that the plot in question was removed long before to make way for a drain.'3 And in the fourteenth satire the first and second wives of a dead man hold a conversation next to his grave; the first regrets that she divorced him simply because he had loved the second. These "satires" are all condensed tragedies of ignorance. In each case the circumstance is satirical because someone has been oblivi- ous to a certain fact, or has never understood the true opinions or desires of someone else, or continues to be kept in the dark about the actions of another. The result of such ignorance is either a small cruelty-as with the dead aunt whose headstone money is being Aaron Matz 525</page><page sequence="8">used for other purposes-or a belated recognition of extraordinary error, as in the plight of the miserable brides who have chosen the wrong man to marry. These are satires, says Hardy, but the satirist in question is never named. It is not even suggested that those who do something improper (the lovers who spend the headstone money) are the agents of satire. These are "satires of circumstance": though some cruelty defines each poem, its source is not identified. The elusive and aphoristic structure of the satires even implies that it would be a mistake to seek this source in the first place. In Hardy's equation the proximity of human to human-even the dead to the living-is enough to render every circumstance satirical. We find ourselves endlessly in laughably tragic scenarios. Over the course of the last thirty-five years of his life, Hardy created an immense body of verse; the most recent edition of The Complete Poems numbers nine hundred forty-eight poems. But Satires of Cir- cumstance is the only unified cycle among these. This is the only group of Hardy poems designated as belonging together or revolving around a central theme or genre. This unity is evident in the common ironic or satirical situations they narrate, of course; but it is equally clear in the titles of each poem. Each of the Satires is named for a situation expressed grammatically through a preposition: "At Tea"; "In Church"; "By Her Aunt's Grave"; "In the Cemetery"; "In the Nuptial Chamber"; "On the Death-Bed"; "Over the Coffin." These prepositional phrases are consistent with Hardy's vision of "circumstance": a circumstance is a position we find ourselves in, a scenario of the self in relation to its surroundings. But this chain of titles is strikingly reminiscent of another series in Hardy: the individual titles of each section of Jude the Obscure. That novel is divided into six parts, each centered on the scene of action, the place where Jude finds himself: "At Marygreen"; "At Christminster"; "At Melchester"; "At Shaston"; "At Aldbrickham and Elsewhere"; "At Christminster Again." This design is unique in Hardy's mature fiction. In certain of his other novels each section division is titled, but in The Return of the Native and Tess of the d'Urbervilles these titles bear no real or consistent thematic relation to one another. This strange parallel encourages us to read Satires of Circumstance and Jude the Obscure side by side-to read Jude as a six-part satire of circumstance in prose. All these narratives are structured around the most basic statement of existence. The unstated verb that precedes each preposition is to be: the young girl is in church; the lovers are in the cemetery; Jude is at Marygreen, then at Christminster, then at 526 Terminal Satire and Jude the Obscure</page><page sequence="9">Melchester, and at the end of the novel he is back at Christminster again. The preposition is the most basic grammatical unit of Hardyan satire. To be located in some place, to take up space on a particular plot of land somewhere in Wessex, is already to fall into the error that draws the wrath of an elusive cosmic satire. Every "at" is a scourge and a curse. This is a major theme in Hardy's fiction, of course: the association of darkly comic absurdity with the stark reality of exist- ing in this world. To find oneself in a particular place is the one unchanging circumstance that begins at birth; and to be born, says Hardy across his fiction, is the primal mistake. For Tess Durbeyfield "birth itself was an ordeal of degrading personal compulsion"; after her disastrous wedding night she realizes that "in some circumstances there was one thing better than to lead a good life, and that was to be saved from leading any life whatever," at which point she hears "a penal sentence in the fiat, 'You shall be born"' (T, 456, 311). In The Return of the Native, Eustacia Vye expresses "an agonising pity for myself that I ever was born"; Clym Yeobright later reaches a similar discovery that "he had been ill-used by fortune, so far as to say that to be born is a palpable dilemma, and that instead of men aiming to advance in life with glory they should calculate how to retreat out of it without shame."'14 This nihilism finds its strongest expression in Jude the Obscure, where Father Time is said to represent "the coming universal wish not to live," and the hero, on his deathbed, recites the verses from the Book of Job: "Let the day perish wherein I was born" (J, 406, 488). These are all different ways of rephrasing the quandary of Hardy's prepositional satire: to be born, and then to exist, is to fall into the trap of being satirized. This extreme pessimism, the object of much study in Hardy criticism, would seem to be another word for what is often called the novelist's "tragic" sense. But Hardy's own formulation for the problem is not the "tragedy" of circumstance; it is the "satire" of circumstance. In Hardy's staging of circumstance, satire is what happens when a person becomes aware of his own tragedy. Satire is a name for self-consciousness and recognition, even when this may be a false recognition. In that scene from the serial version of Jude to which I alluded earlier-when Jude overhears the conversation of some clergymen after the infanticide and cries, "[W]hat a satire their talk is on our importance to the world!"-the allegation of satire is the expression of a paranoid vi- sion of reality. Jude hears other people and relates this conversation to himself; this magnifies his conception of the wretchedness of his situation; suddenly he sees himself as a victim and tragedy dissolves Aaron Matz 527</page><page sequence="10">into satire. A scenario therefore becomes satirical precisely when the central character himself feels satirized, even if he cannot know the source of the attack. A fine example of this Hardyan scenario comes from Tess of the d'Urbervilles, where the heroine waits longingly for the husband who has abandoned her. The narrator cites two lines from Wordsworth's "Ode: Intimations of Immortality"-"Not in utter nakedness / But trailing clouds of glory do we come"-and writes that to Tess "there was ghastly satire in the poet's lines" (T, 456). We must remember that Wordsworth did not write these lines as ghastly satire; Hardy has ripped them out of context and slotted them ironically into his own story, where the phrasing does not change but the significance does, since they seem like satire and mockery directed at Tess amidst her misfortunes. This passage provides a valuable analogy for our own in- terpretation of a novel like Jude the Obscure. It represents a moment of reading. It is not necessarily clear that Tess Durbeyfield knows these lines from Wordsworth-it should be presumed that she does not-and yet Hardy implies that their spirit is nevertheless familiar to her, except that she can only understand this spirit in reverse, as satire. Tess is thereby in the position of reading a sentiment but only comprehending it as a mockery of her situation. This is an attitude of suspicion that insists on understanding the self as a constant target. For Hardy satire is a question of interpretation, of reading things as signs and reacting accordingly. In Fiction and Repetition J. Hillis Miller notes that Hardy's narrators "see things in figure" and call attention to repetitions that may not in fact be true likenesses. "The problem," writes Miller, "is not that there are no explanations proposed in the text, but that there are too many."'15 This observation applies to Hardy's characters no less than to his narrators. To see patterns in the world beyond ourselves, and then to seek total explanations for them despite the probability of mere contingency, and finally to connect them to ourselves: this is to see things in figure. This is to succumb to the temptation of personifying circumstance; and this is to take certain rules of the realist novel and reread them as satire. Satire in Hardy must be vague to be prepositional; if it were too specific, we would be able to discern in too vivid detail the identity of the forces acting upon Jude Fawley. Jude the Obscure relies heavily on its hazy suspicion of "things": Jude and Sue's contemplation, late in the book, of "the direct antagonism of things" is exemplary of the novel's stance towards the vagueness of animosity (j, 413). It is important to remember that there is no villain in this novel. This is true of many 528 Terminal Satire and Jude the Obscure</page><page sequence="11">Hardy novels; Alec d'Urberville, if he should even be called a villain, is exceptional. In Jude the Obscure it is "things" that fill the void left by villainy. This is one reason for their anthropomorphism; antagonistic forces can only be understood when they are given a human shape. But if "things" are so often to blame, they are also the very essence of Hardy's stories and plots. In his explanatory note to the first edition of Tess he wrote that his purpose had been "to give artistic form to a true sequence of things" (T, xv). His novels-like most novels that belong to the realist tradition, broadly stated-are efforts to explain why things happen the way they do: in what sequence, and through what chain of cause and effect. But in Jude the very idea of sequence is left radically uncertain. Since Jude's fate is so often reduced to his simply being at a particular place, then finding himself somewhere else later, this chain is reduced to a series of brute statements of existence. The "true sequence of things" of Tess becomes a six-part satire of circumstance in Jude, which as a result retreats to the extreme frontier of the realist project. It represents the point at which realism, the mostly objective effort to describe life as it is, can no longer be dissociated from a radical form of satire, in which human character is depicted in order to show how it is mocked simply for being there. This is the essence of prepositional satire, the starkest mode of real- ism. Nowhere is this idea of genre expressed more succinctly than in Hardy's own title for his later verse cycle. Satires of Circumstance seems on the surface to be a paradox: "circumstance" should be far too neutral a term to allow for the polemics and prejudices of satire. But in Hardy's equation the two are fused into one another; and in the end satire and circumstance sound so interchangeable that the phrase itself risks being redundant. III. FARCE AND THE COMPARATIVELY UNREAL Prepositional satire is the fate primarily of the title character in Jude the Obscure. But he is not the only figure in the novel to lament this basic condition of existence, or to locate its origin in the actuality of having once been born. Jude's closing words-"Let the day perish wherein I was born"-are in fact an echo of an earlier proclamation by his son Father Time. Time, in his final conversation with Sue before hanging himself and his two half-siblings, bluntly declares: "I wish I hadn't been born!" (J, 402). His ensuing suicide/infanticide seems on the surface to be the corrective to this blight of entering the world, a corrective that Jude himself can only attain through a much more Aaron Matz 529</page><page sequence="12">protracted suffering, at the end of the novel. But Time's notorious act cannot be understood merely as a corrective to his own existence, or to that of the two other children he murders. In his conversation with Sue, just after proclaiming his wish never to have been born, he elaborates: "I think that whenever children be born that are not wanted they should be killed directly, before their souls come to 'em, and not allowed to grow big and walk about!" (J, 402). There is an alarming universality in this statement, a total theory behind it, which transcends even the particular instance of the excruciating scene that follows. There is no alternative proposed in the novel for how to deal with children: after Time kills himself and his two half-siblings there are simply no other children left in the story. He has, effectively, ac- complished his goal of a large-scale extermination. If Father Time has always been a problem for readers of Jude the Obscure, it is largely this very universality that is to blame. Every- thing the child says and does bears such an extraordinary weight of significance, and his doctrines reach so far beyond the normal ken of a young boy, that it seems he cannot be accommodated within the realistic contours of the novel. Many critics therefore deem it impos- sible to accept Hardy's characterization of the boy in the same way we do the veracity of Jude or Arabella. Irving Howe, representative of such readers, complains about the "glaring falsity" of such scenes as the infanticide, which is a "botched incident"; he pronounces it "a failure of tact to burden [Father Time] with so much philosophical weight."'6 We can presume that if Father Time were simply a moody child who ended up killing himself-but without exemplifying "the coming universal wish not to live"-Howe and others might not ob- ject so viscerally to the inclusion of an ethereally austere boy within a novel so widely admired for the unforgiving precision of its realism. The strange personage of Father Time ultimately leads readers of the novel to seek divergent ways of explaining him; few can bring themselves to ignore him. Early vociferous critics of the novel rejected him altogether. Mrs. Oliphant, for example, writing in Blackwood's, called the infanticide "pure farce ... only too grotesque to be amus- ing.""7 An unsigned review in The Illustrated London News went into more detail: Now, up to this point, woe has been heaped upon woe, and the reader has accepted it all, with some reservations, as a natural evolution of the circumstances. The tragedy of the children strains his belief to snapping point.... [I]t is strange that Mr. Hardy did not perceive 530 Terminal Satire and Jude the Obscure</page><page sequence="13">how he had imperilled the whole fabric by a stroke which passes the border of burlesque.'8 This anonymous critic's objection to the "burlesque" is similar to Mrs. Oliphant's "farce": both are registering the difficulty of assimilating the infanticide with the realism of the story. This was also the objec- tion of Havelock Ellis, who in an otherwise reverential review in The Savoy-"Jude the Obscure seems to be the greatest novel written in England for many years"-singled out the infanticide as the novel's lone fiasco: Only at one point, it seems to me, is there a serious lapse in the art of the book, and that is when the door of the bedroom closet is sprung open on us to reveal the row of childish corpses. Up to that one admires the strength and sobriety of the narrative, its complete reliance on the interests that lie in common humanity. We feel that here are real human beings of the sort we all know, engaged in obscure struggles that are latent in the life we all know. But with the opening of that cupboard we are thrust out of the large field of common life into the small field of the police court or the lunatic asylum, among the things which for most of us are comparatively unreal."9 For all these 1890s readers, this scene at some basic level cannot be accepted as true: it is closer to farce or burlesque than to their idea of the novelistic, and so it is unreal. More recently some readers have tried to connect Father Time's act to Malthusian population theory; they explain the proclamation of the boy's infamous suicide note-"Done because we are too menny"-as an unfortunate byproduct of nineteenth-century social science (J, 405).20 The expressed universality of Father Time's project seems to encourage a Malthusian reading: the slaughter of the young is in essence a drastic method to limit population on a grand scale. But this reading alone is ultimately inadequate, for though it may consider the magnitude of the event, it does not account for the generic outrageousness of its representation. In calling it "farcical," Mrs. Oliphant-for all her foolish opposition to the novel upon its publication-may have came closest to an accurate judgment of the infanticide. The nineteenth-century novel is rife with examples of child-killings, real or alleged: in Walter Scott's Heart of Midlothian and Frances Trollope's Jessie Phillips the crime is presumed; in George Eliot's Adam Bede Hetty Sorrel does in fact kill her infant child. But in none of these novels is the killing of children related to the problem of overpopulation, grandly stated; Aaron Matz 531</page><page sequence="14">and in none of them is the individual event asked explicitly to serve the exemplary role played by the catastrophe in Jude the Obscure. In Jude the vast design behind the event tugs its reader in two contrary directions. It asks us to believe its credibility by alluding to the pos- sibility that there is in fact a problem of overpopulation; and yet it burdens the boy and the act with such overwhelming consequence that it strains all bounds of verisimilitude. It is a moment of such excess that it does in fact approach the farcical. Father Time's own stated philosophy-"I think that whenever chil- dren be born that are not wanted they should be killed directly"-has no real precedent in the Victorian novel. The vast scope of its potential application (it should apply "whenever," and to "children" generally) exceeds, for example, the specific tragedy of Hetty Sorrel's fatal aban- doning of her child. In truth Father Time's proclamation owes much more to Swift's Modest Proposal than to any scene or statement in nine- teenth-century literature. At the beginning of Swift's satire, before he has revealed the essence of the proposal, he writes that his intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the Children of professed Beggars: It is of a much greater Extent, and shall take in the whole Number of Infants at a certain Age, who are born of Parents, in effect as little able to support them, as those who demand our Charity in the Streets.21 In a sense Father Time's oath sounds like an echo of the Modest Proposer's: it plays on the idea of taking in a vast portion of society, of the "whole Number of Infants." In both cases the problem has to do with the danger of taking things too literally. The interest of the Modest Proposal lies not only in the virtuosity of its rhetoric, but in the unlikely but possible danger of a reader's absurdly literal interpretation.22 For Father Time the tragedy can also be traced to a literal interpretation of things: when the boy asks Sue if it would be better for him and the other children to be "out o' the world than in it," she replies "it would almost, dear"; two pages later the three children are hanging from box-cords. Sue realizes just after the infanticide that "he took it literally" (J, 408). We err when we read things by the letter, for-in the formulation of the novel's epigraph-"the letter killeth." John Bayley has remarked that this "literalness" provides the shock- value for both Hardy and Swift, but he does not acknowledge that this shared effect may not be coincidental-that Hardy may have had Swift in mind when he decided to kill off the children in this way.23 We should 532 Terminal Satire and Jude the Obscure</page><page sequence="15">not forget that Swift was one of the "satirists" Hardy was reading as he turned from Tess of the d'Urbervilles to Jude the Obscure. Though Swift's name, unlike Voltaire's, does not appear in the novel itself, Hardy had a distinct interest in the Augustan satirist throughout most of his career and especially towards the end of the nineteenth century. The Early Life records that in 1880 Matthew Arnold had advised Hardy to study him: "[T]he best man to read for style-narrative style-was Swift" (E, 175). It is uncertain whether Hardy took up Swift in earnest before 1890, but by the final decade of the century the great satirist had become a central figure for Hardy's own self-image. An 1899 entry in The Later Years of Thomas Hardy makes this quite clear: Hardy had a born sense of humour, even a too keen sense occasionally: but his poetry was sometimes placed by editors in the hands of reviewers deficient in that quality. Even if they were accustomed to Dickensian humour they were not to Swiftian. Hence it unfortunately happened that verses of a satirical, dry, caustic, or farcical cast were regarded by them with the deepest seriousness.24 By the turn of the century Hardy had devoted himself exclusively to poetry; the allusion here is to his verse in particular. But this affinity for Swift emerges no less forcefully in the novel published only four years earlier. If there is humor in Jude the Obscure, it is a perversely Swiftian humor: a radically ironic and misanthropic, perverse humor. It is revealing that Hardy instinctively opposes this kind of humor to the Dickensian variety, which was a much more familiar and available mode of satire within the idiom of the Victorian novel. Dickens's satire typically zeroed in on a particular segment of society: the Chancery, the Circumlocution Office, the provincial schoolhouse. But Swift's was more pervasive and more essential: less compatible, it would seem, with the generous perspective of the Victorian novel.25 The apparent universality of Father Time's murderous proclamation may seem comical if we know to associate such grand suggestions of child exterminations only with proposals that must be satirical; it is when the boy enacts a small-scale version of it that we shudder to see im- plausible theory transformed into grotesque action. Such an awkward transition cannot help but baffle many readers of the novel. And so it is difficult not to associate Hardy's complaint above-that reviewers of his poetry could not appreciate its Swiftian satire-with his similar grievances a few years earlier, when other reviewers had greeted Jude the Obscure with such revulsion.26 Aaron Matz 533</page><page sequence="16">As with so many other aspects of Jude, however, the infanticide hovers between its debt to formal satire and its concurrent gestures towards a certain realism. One might say it is satirical in design and realistic in execution. It is hard to think about the scene without recall- ing the vividness of its detail, the ruthless intensity of its visual sense. Here for instance is our first vision of the hanging children, which we see through Jude's eyes: He looked in bewilderment round the room. At the back of the door were fixed two hooks for hanging garments, and from these the forms of the two youngest children were suspended, by a piece of box-cord round each of their necks, while from a nail a few yards off the body of little Jude was hanging in a similar manner. An overturned chair was near the elder boy, and his glazed eyes were staring into the room; but those of the girl and the baby boy were closed. (1, 404-5) The entire scene depends upon the ocular, from the cruel panorama we share with Jude to Father Time's own eyes, staring stubbornly at the follies of the world he has just renounced. Nowhere else in Jude the Obscure is the narration so matter-of-fact. It is disarmingly calm, taking us patiently through every cruel detail in the room.27 This exact- ness of detail marks Hardy's total mastery of the mercilessness lurking within so much late Victorian realism. But it also seems strangely at odds with the grandiosity of the boy's theory of child-killing only two pages earlier. It is as though the infanticide were a crucible of genre for Hardy: in this sequence of the novel, more than in any other, he would have to vacillate between the implausible hyperboles of satirical suggestion and the rigorous methods of realist narrative.28 The specter of three children hanging from hooks and nails marks a terminus in the evolution of Victorian realism. The bleak rustic tragedy of Adam Bede or the urban poverty of such 1880s George Gissing novels as The Nether World may have looked ahead to such a vision, but they could not predict its clear aim to bring a novelistic tradition to a point beyond which transcendence would be impossible. And yet the novel itself does continue beyond this point. There are in fact nine subsequent chapters in Jude the Obscure, each bringing a new portion of misery and wretchedness to Jude and Sue. Even the end of the infanticide chapter allows no respite from the horrific. Most readers remember three dead children in this chapter-Father 534 Terminal Satire and Jude the Obscure</page><page sequence="17">Time and the two others he has hanged alongside himself. But there is a fourth: in the chapter's final line, Jude learns that the pregnant Sue has gone into labor prematurely and that the child is stillborn. If Gosse's "limits of realism" had not been reached in the scene of the infanticide, surely they are attained here: at such a moment the plausibility of tragedy threatens to dissolve completely, leaving only the sour taste of an author intent on subjecting his reader to an absolute assault on the senses. The final chapters of Jude the Obscure taunt us; they provoke our complete stupefaction that Hardy can push his narrative any further. These eighty pages are, more perhaps than any sequence in any other English novel, a prolonged exercise in excruciation. This is an excruciation of prolongment and protraction. The pattern is repeated throughout these late pages: Sue threatens to go back to Phillotson again, and after more debate she finally does; Jude turns gravely ill, but two chapters from the end he recovers briefly, delaying the death that could finally bring the novel to a close; in the final chapter, when Arabella discovers his corpse, she chooses not to report his death im- mediately but to go out to join the crowds at the boat race instead, and so the dead Jude must lie there, unattended, a little longer. This perverse excruciation in Jude the Obscure signals a larger resistance in Hardy to the idea of continuation and the regular flow of events. In the most basic sense Hardy was profoundly suspicious of the normal evolution of time; this is an essential part of his deep- rooted conservatism. In 1888, according to The Early Life, he wrote: "It is the on-going-i.e. the 'becoming'-of the world that produces its sadness. If the world stood still at a felicitous moment there would be no sadness in it" (E, 265). Elsewhere the same volume cites Hardy's opposition to nature's "blunder of overdoing"-the mistake of man's having evolved this far in history-and elaborates several pages later: "We [human beings] have reached a degree of intelligence which Nature never contemplated when framing her laws, and for which she consequently has provided no adequate satisfactions" (E, 192, 213). This relates directly, of course, to the fierce ambivalence in Jude the Obscure towards the very idea of the propagation of the human species; these axioms are blatantly prophetic of Father Time's suicide note. But Hardy's resistance to the "on-going" of things also has a formal or novelistic interest for us. It suggests that such conservatism risks being fundamentally at odds with the structure of narrative art itself-which in any realist idiom traces the evolution of events, or what Hardy called in his prefatory note to Tess of the d'Urbervilles the Aaron Matz 535</page><page sequence="18">"true sequence of things." But in Jude the "on-going" of the world no longer seems in harmony with this true sequence. This is not to say that Hardy completely reconceived his relationship to narrative after Tess, just that-as his plots revealed their debt to non-novelistic forms like satire-the continuation of the narrative began to seem less like a natural progression of a particular story, and more like a lesson that on-going itself was the problem. These late, post-infanticide chapters in Jude the Obscure suggest that if on-going is tragic or "sad," to use Hardy's own term, this sadness cannot be dissociated from a certain grotesque comedy. The pastoral sorrow of the first parts of the novel yields to a much more bizarre, carnivalesque wretchedness by novel's end. The closing chapters ring with the inescapable sound of discordant laughter, a laughter which emanates primarily from Arabella. A few chapters after the hanging we find her with her father, engaged in a conversation about the absurdity of her reuniting with Jude: "Arabella was suddenly seized with a fit of loud laughter, in which her father joined more moderately" (J, 457). A short while later, as she flirts with the quack doctor Vilbert and brings him a drink, "Arabella began shaking with suppressed laughter" (J, 485). Such awkward hilarity is exemplary of the garish tone that dis- torts the late sequences of Jude the Obscure. Jude seems particularly haunted by this laughter: in his final days he begins to hear the voices of the great minds of Christminster-Addison, Johnson, Arnold-and cries: "They seem laughing at me!" (J, 474); and in the same scene in the serial version he rails against the "great permanent sneer" of the university.29 This of course recalls all the previous occasions of Jude's paranoid conviction that he is the object of a grand satire; but in these late scenes such laughter tolls even more cacophonously. It may seem peculiar to record the sounds of laughter in Hardy's fiction, much as it first seems counterintuitive to trace the influences of satire. Hardy cannot be called a comic novelist in any ordinary sense. Father Time, in his first appearance in the novel, is said to bear an expression that says: "All laughing comes from misapprehension. Rightly looked at there is no laughable thing under the sun" (J, 332). We are not supposed to understand this completely ironically; this grave suspicion of laughter is a genuine reflex in Hardy's philosophy. In a letter to Symonds in 1889-the year before the publication of Symonds's Essays Speculative and Suggestive-he wrote: "All comedy, is tragedy, if you only look deep enough into it.1"30 But such resistance to laughter and comedy does not mean that Hardy rejected the inclu- sion of either one in Jude the Obscure. It cannot be accidental that 536 Terminal Satire and Jude the Obscure</page><page sequence="19">laughter emerges brashly in the late chapters of the novel, after so many forms of tragedy have already run their course. If all comedy is tragedy, then the are of Jude the Obscure suggests that the reverse must also be true. When all the realistic manifestations of tragedy have been exhausted, there remains nothing else for us to do but laugh-if only for the terrible fact that for an excruciatingly long period, even after the elimination of the whole number of infants, the novel per- versely refuses to end. IV HARDY AND THE LIMITS OF GENRE At a much earlier point in Jude the Obscure, only shortly after he has arrived at Christminster and met Sue, Jude receives a letter from T. Tetuphenay, master of Biblioll College. The letter recommends that Jude abandon his effort to enter any of the colleges at Christminster. Jude, devastated, goes to a local bar and has two drinks, then contin- ues on to an intersection called The Fourways, located in the middle of the city. "It had more history than the oldest college in the city," writes Hardy. "It was literally teeming, stratified, with the shades of human groups, who had met there for tragedy, comedy, farce; real enactments of the intensest kind" (J, 139). It is here that Jude real- izes that his desire for an education at Christminster is futile, and that "town life was a book of humanity infinitely more palpitating, varied, and compendious than the gown life" (J, 139). But The Fourways is also a natural metaphor for Jude the Obscure itself: a crossroads of genre, where "tragedy, comedy, farce" intersect to produce a hybrid form that yields a mode of a whole new intensity. To pursue the contours and limits of genre in Hardy is only to trace a subject that consumed the novelist himself. Such remarks as "All comedy is tragedy, if you only look deep enough into it" are echoed throughout his private writings, especially towards the end of the nineteenth cen- tury. In an 1888 journal entry, according to The Early Life, he wrote: "[I]f you look beneath the surface of any farce you see a tragedy" (E, 282); the lesson again is that a thorough examination of any ostensibly humorous human situation provides a revelation of its genuine sadness. But different genres could be theorized as distinct as well as fluid. In the "General Preface to the Novels and Poems," written for the 1912 Wessex Edition, Hardy advised novelists to orient themselves towards the mode or idiom for which they felt a natural affinity: Differing natures find their tongue in the presence of differing spectacles. Some natures become vocal at tragedy, some are made more Aaron Matz 537</page><page sequence="20">vocal at comedy, and it seems to me that to whichever of these aspects of life a writer's instinct for expression the more readily responds, to that he should allow it to respond.31 So although Hardy may have seen comedy slipping frequently into trag- edy, he could nevertheless conceive of genre as a category that might retain certain immutable properties. Though it may seem paradoxical, this belief is no less typical of Hardy. He had, in the Balzacian tradition, a strong interest in classifying his own fiction. In the "General Preface" he laid out the categories in which each novel would fall: "The Wes- sex Novels," Hardy's own unified Com(die humaine, would be further grouped into "Novels of Character and Environment," "Romances and Fantasies," and "Novels of Ingenuity.""32 Such categories are indeed closer to Balzac's subject- and locale-based groupings than they are to the Shakespearean classifications of the First Folio-"Comedies," "Histories," "Tragedies"-but they are nevertheless proof of a novelist keen on the generic subdivision of his own body of fiction. In fact Hardy was not the first to propose a system for classifying what would become the Wessex novels. In 1894, before even the ar- rival of Jude the Obscure, Lionel Johnson published The Art of Thomas Hardy, the first volume ever devoted to Hardy's fiction. Johnson im- mediately set about organizing the novels by genre: For clearness' sake, a classification of these fifteen volumes may be tried, according to the dominant tone and nature of the various groups, into which they fall with ease. There seem to be three such groups: the Tragic, the Idyllic, and a third; for which I can find no name, until one word be discovered to express in combination the comic, the ironic, the satiric, the romantic, the extravagant; a spirit of mocking audacity, and of serious laughter, animating a Pantagruel of Psychology.33 The first group included most of the major novels: The Return of the Native, The Woodlanders, Tess of the d'Urbervilles, The Mayor of Cast- erbridge and others; the second consisted of Under the Greenwood Tree and The Trumpet Major. But it is this third group that demonstrates the considerable difficulty that would await those inspired to classify Hardy's novels-even as early as 1894. Johnson placed in this third category A Laodicean, The Hand of Ethelberta, and Two on a Tower, then hastened to explain that such classification was "a little whimsi- cal," since certain properties and sensibilities seeped from one group to another: "[A] touch of innocent joy does but deepen the prevailing tragedy; a stroke of grim tragedy does but add fresh zest to the sad 538 Terminal Satire and Jude the Obscure</page><page sequence="21">laughter of the satirist."34 Still, Johnson would return later in his study to the problem of this third category, represented primarily by novels written early in Hardy's career: His earlier extravagance is an extravagance, which delights in audacities of situation, and in exhibitions of temperament, rather startling than brilliant: a certain touch of unpleasantness, and taste of vulgarity, just felt by the distressed reader, went near to spoiling some stories, otherwise delightful. The satire seemed almost splenetic, the humour little else than bad nature: the cynic's wit was mordant, the jester's smile, a sardonic wrinkling of the lips ... something unkind, an uncanny sort of pleased and sly malevolence, looks out upon me from many a page, and stops the laughter. Johnson was wary of such early manifestations of Hardyan humor and satire; he goes on to compare these novels unfavorably with "Rabelais, Voltaire, Swift, Heine, Sterne."35 Indeed, even though he never says this explicitly, his tripartite division of the novels amounts to a ranking in the quality of the books, with the "Tragic" category clearly at the top of the list. But these other novels of "splenetic" satire continued to puzzle Johnson. This perplexity is quite significant: the odd satiric strain in Hardy, Johnson understood in 1894, dated back to the earli- est Wessex novels. Hardy himself, though he would not declare his turn to the "satirists" until 1890, provides similar evidence of a youthful interest in the genre. In The Early Life he includes an unusually long anecdote about his effort to secure a publisher for his first novel, The Poor Man and the Lady. The tortuous route leads Hardy finally to the firm of Chapman and Hall and a mysterious "gentleman" who reads the manuscript-and who turns out to be George Meredith (E, 80). Meredith first agrees to accept the novel, though he has strong reservations; he worries that it will be "attacked on all sides by the conventional reviewers" (E, 81). The Early Life explains: The story was, in fact, a sweeping dramatic satire of the squirearchy and nobility, London society, the vulgarity of the middle class, modem Christianity, church restoration, and political and domestic morals in general, the author's views, in fact, being obviously those of a young man with a passion for reforming the world. ... The satire was obviously pushed too far-as sometimes in Swift and Defoe themselves-and portions of the book, apparently taken in earnest by both his readers, had no foundation either in Hardy's beliefs or his experience. (E, 81) Aaron Matz 539</page><page sequence="22">This anecdote, in Hardy's eventual rendering of it, takes on the sta- tus of a veritable foundation myth in the story of his emergence as a novelist. Many of the themes that will define his career-the threat of controversy, the attack on religion, his desire to reform the world-are there in embryonic form. The genesis of the novelist is the same story as the birth of the satirist. And there is a remarkable escalation, a spi- raling out of the satire, in this version of the story: it begins with the squirearchy and ends with political and domestic morals in general. In retrospect, such a description of his own early fiction seems rather overstated; "sweeping" satire-or Johnson's "splenetic" satire-sounds like a far better name for the later invective of Jude the Obscure. But Hardy clearly believed that the roots of such a mode lay in his earliest fiction, and that the identification of this satiric tendency was closely related to his own fixation on the generic classification of his novels. In the debates over realism that would define English criticism in the late Victorian period, the main participants would often describe the school or movement in terms similar to those used by Hardy, Johnson, and others in their reports on novelistic satire. Gosse, in "The Limits of Realism in Fiction," wrote of the wave of naturalism that began to leave its mark on English fiction in the 1880s: "[I]t was to be the Revealer and Avenger. It was to display society as it is, and to wipe out all the hypocrisies of convention.""36 This is a curious pair of epithets: it encourages us to ask what exactly revealing has to do with avenging. To reveal seems the province of the realist; it is demonstra- tive and aspires to a certain objectivity. But to avenge is immediately to forfeit any semblance of objectivity or neutrality; it is to pick sides; and it marks another kind of blurring, this time from realist narrative into something approaching satire. The Thomas Hardy who wrote Jude the Obscure, and who through- out these years was so perplexed by the problems of genre in his own fiction, exemplified the uneasy simultaneity of these two endeavors. To reveal, proposed Hardy, is to avenge. In the same 1888 journal entry in which he laid out the first plan for Jude (the story of a young man "who could not go to Oxford"), Hardy went on to declare of this nascent project: "There is something [in this] the world ought to be shown, and I am the one to show it to them" (E, 272). "Showing" was from this first moment a furiously moral act-an exigency and a responsibility. Though Gosse would not read Jude the Obscure until two years after the publication of "The Limits of Realism in Fiction" in Questions at Issue, Hardy's novel would mark such an affirmation of his prophecy that it seems almost to have anticipated him. Jude marks that crucial 540 Terminal Satire and Jude the Obscure</page><page sequence="23">phase in which the immersion in unpleasant detail divulges a strong moral purpose, in which realism may be said to yield to satire. This is why Hardy's oft-repeated line from his poem "In Tenebris II"-"if way to the Better be, it exacts a full look at the Worst"-is so signifi- cant."3 Hardy toys with the idea that an exhaustive look at misery or folly can point the way out of the morass of experience, even if in Jude the Obscure he effectively renounces such a hope. Such guarded optimism, even if only temporary, is a doctrine native to much satire, which traditionally serves a corrective purpose. Such declarations and confusions were, in fact, the very terms of the debates over genre so common in these late Victorian years. A prime example is the Henrik Ibsen controversy among British critics in the late 1880s and early 1890s, in which Ibsen's plays were called both "realistic" and "satirical." Hardy himself followed these debates closely. In 1890, for instance, he noted in his journal: "In an article on Ibsen in the Fortnightly the writer says that his manner is wrong. That the drama, like the novel, should not be for edification. In this I think the writer errs. It should be so, but the edified should not perceive the edification. Ibsen's edifying is too obvious" (E, 294).8 Hardy seems always anxious to achieve such a concealment of edification, to bury his moralism deep within his narratives. In his 1892 preface to Tess of the d'Urbervilles, he declares that his aim was "to be neither didactic nor aggressive ... a novel is an impression, not an argument" (T, xviii); and at the end of The Return of the Native he writes sympathetically that Clym Yeobright's philosophical discourses were "sometimes secular, and sometimes religious, but never dogmatic."39 If Hardy was drawn to satire, especially in the first years of the 1890s, he was nevertheless intent on obscuring its traces in his fiction. For although he recognized that genres had a tendency to fuse into one another, he was intent on containing the moralizing force of satire within the predominantly realist contours of his fiction. By 1895, however, realist representation had become too abrasive to hide its polemical tendencies, and the idea of genre could no longer be dissociated from the question of the moral implications of novelistic art. In the following year, more than six months after the publication of Jude the Obscure, Hardy wrote to an American journalist who had first excoriated the novel in the pages of the New York World, then asked him for an interview: "Those readers who, like yourself, could not see that "Jude" (though a book quite without a "purpose," as it is called) makes for morality more than any other book I have writ- ten, are not likely to be made to do so by a newspaper article, even Aaron Matz 541</page><page sequence="24">from your attractive pen."40 And indeed, for all the enraged readers who considered Jude an immoral book, there were many others who complained of its excessive moralizing: few thought it a completely amoral, and thus a purely "realistic" effort.41 The "extravagant" satire that Johnson identified and objected to in Hardy's earlier novels had evolved into a far more essential and profoundly moral satire in the form of Jude the Obscure. There is perhaps no greater proof that Hardy's final novel blurred the boundaries of genre beyond recogni- tion, and that it did so through the channels of its satiric heritage: it was no longer very easy to distinguish reckless immorality from the unbearable sobriety of deeply moral art. V TERMINAL SATIRE The destructive energy of Jude the Obscure is aimed in many direc- tions: at the oppressive Victorian strictures of marriage, at the exclu- sion of the universities, at a society in which the lot of the poor is so wretched. A less obvious but perhaps more fundamental object of the novel's vituperation is the existence of writing itself. The suspicion of books is an integral theme of Hardy's novel from its first pages. In an early scene, when the young Jude first tries to learn Latin and Greek and discovers the immense difficulty of that project, he is already starting to understand books as part of the larger problem: "[H]e wished he had never seen a book, that he might never see another, that he had never been born" (J, 31). The long defeat at Christminster is encompassed in this single line, for Jude already feels betrayed by the knowledge that will continually fail him. He expresses this enmity syntactically as a version of that essential curse of prepositional satire: he wishes he had never fallen under the spell of writing just as he wishes he had never been born. Jude's oath against books is a prophecy of Hardy's own vow that he would abandon fiction after Jude the Obscure. In his letters Hardy implied that it was the abusive reaction to Jude that impelled him to renounce novels altogether-and for the most part the last century of Hardy criticism has taken this version of the story to be true.42 But the 1897 section of The Later Years reminds us that it was a decision "to abandon at once a form of literary art he had long intended to abandon at some indefinite time," especially since in his estimation the novel was becoming merely "a spasmodic inventory of items"-an art form under the dominion of a tyrannical realism.43 It is a mistake to say that Hardy's renunciation of the novel was a decision he made in response 542 Terminal Satire and Jude the Obscure</page><page sequence="25">to the aftermath of Jude the Obscure. It was, instead, something he had set out to do in the very writing of the book. The renunciation of words and writing is a prominent enough theme in Hardy to constitute a veritable sub-genre in itself. Bayley goes so far as to begin his monograph on Hardy by claiming that in the novels Hardy "gives the impression of a man who would rather be silent than speak."44 This impression is as central to Hardy's poetry as to his fiction. The final poem in his immense body of verse is entitled "He Resolves to Say No More": though a statement from 1928, it can refer just as naturally to his momentous decision to renounce fiction in 1896. Miller is correct to say that this predisposition to reticence, though articulated most explicitly in this final poem, "has been covertly present in the tone of all his speech."45 Although Hardy may at times be the great "Revealer," he is at other moments resistant to divulge anything at all; such that his final poem announces defiantly: "From now alway / Till my last day / What I discern I will not say."46 Perhaps the best expression of this essentially Hardyan theme is to be found in his preface to the Wessex edition of Tess of the d'Urbervilles. Ad- dressing the controversy that swirled around the book's subtitle-"A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented"-Hardy writes, "It was disputed more than anything else in the book. Melius fuerat non scribere" (T, xxi). Though Hardy may have been referring specifically to the prob- lem of the subtitle, the grammar of the Latin is appropriately unclear in the scope of its implications. In a sense, Hardy encourages us to understand, it would have been better not to write at all. There is a point in much satirical writing when the satire turns into an attack on writing itself, an expression of exasperation at the endless production of words. This is one of the lessons of Swift's Tale of a Tub; an important theme in another late Victorian realist novel, Gissing's New Grub Street; and a central idea in such twentieth-century satirical apologias as Wyndham Lewis's Men Without Art and Louis-Ferdinand Celine's Entretiens avec le professeur Y. Ultimately Hardy's strange ambivalence about expression and writing cannot be understood apart from his lifelong interest in satire. And his great renunciation of a specific kind of writing-his repudiation of fiction after Jude the Obscure-cannot be divorced from his course in reading "mostly the satirists" in the 1890s. Jude is a novel that courses inexorably to its ending, and that makes the very idea of an ending a theme in itself. It is true that the post-infanticide chapters are excruciatingly protracted. But after these nine late chapters have at last run their course, the novel does necessarily come to an end. This conclusion is markedly Aaron Matz 543</page><page sequence="26">different from the endings of so many Victorian novels: there is not only no marriage, but no promise of marriage, no suggestion of any kind of regeneration. In this sense it is different even from Hardy's earlier tragic novels. In Tess of the d'Urbervilles, for example, the weighty fact of the heroine's execution is mitigated partially by the suggestion that Angel Clare and Tess's sister, Liza-Lu, will provide some minimum futurity-and so the story continues despite Tess's death. The Victorian novel does not so much end as it gets displaced elsewhere, off the page. But this is not the case in Jude the Obscure. The novel ends with a conversation between Arabella and the Widow Edlin as they stand over Jude's coffin. This conversation turns mostly on the question of Sue, and whether she ever came to see Jude in his final days. Mrs. Edlin asks whether the dying Jude had ever asked for Sue to be sent; Arabella says that she offered to do so but that Jude refused. Arabella then has the final word of the novel: Sue has never found peace since she left Jude, and she never will find peace until she is dead, as Jude is. This is the novel's final, perverse cruelty: it ends with Arabella and her bleak recognition. But in a larger sense it is also a glaring rejec- tion of the conventions of the Victorian novel maintained even in a work as dark as Tess. Instead of providing a man and a woman, and the promise of regeneration that such a couple implies, it leaves us with the figure who most complicated the story of Jude and Sue in the first place. To conclude with the woman who laughs rather than the woman who cries-for in theory Jude the Obscure might have shifted to Sue in its closing scene-is to bestow one final reminder of the novel's great debt to the grotesque, the farcical, and the satirical. This ending offers no hint of what may come next. There is no sug- gestion of Sue's future life, or even Arabella's. There are no children to pin our hopes on-they have all been killed off. There is, rather, a sense that this ending seeks to be a total ending, the expression of an absolute silence. The are of Jude the Obscure is an are of noisy fury: it reaches its height in the brash sounds of Sue's convulsions upon seeing the hanging children, then in the dissonant noise of Arabella's laughter. But when this are has reached its full distance, and when all this noise has been exhausted, there is nothing the novel can do but fall silent. D. H. Lawrence, writing of Jude in his study of Hardy, would insist that this is an inevitable silence: "[T]here is no further possible utterance of the peace that passeth all understanding, the peace of God which is Perfect Knowledge. There is only silence beyond this."47 The destructive energy of the novel, having directed its own fury at 544 Terminal Satire and Jude the Obscure</page><page sequence="27">so many institutions and circumstances, must in the end turn inward, on itself. By its final chapter, Jude the Obscure seems rendered hoarse from its own howls. And so it reaches an end that appears to be a true terminus, as if to say: melius fuerat non scribere. I claimed earlier that this ending is entirely unlike anything in the Victorian novel. If there is a precedent for this way of concluding a narrative, it lies instead in the satirical tradition. This pattern of noise and silence is part of the fabric of such formal satires as A Tale of a Tub, in which Swift's Hack, exhausted by digression after digression, can only end by saying: "Therefore, I shall pause here awhile, till I find, by feeling the World's Pulse, and my own, that it will be of ab- solute Necessity for us both, to resume my Pen."48 Or Hardy's novel is prescient of certain twentieth-century novels that fuse an intense hyperrealism with the fury of satire, novels like line's Voyage au bout de la nuit, which ends with the narrator on the banks of the Seine renouncing all desire to continue his narrative any further: "qu'on n'en parle plus."49 This bleak statement-let's speak no more of it-could be just as easily the final line of Jude the Obscure. Hardy's final novel ends not like a recognizably realist novel but in the fashion of a ter- minal satire: after such a litany of invective it can do nothing else but end in exasperated and absolute silence. Hardy understood this, and by 1896 he had abandoned the novel for good. Wesleyan University NOTES 1 Thomas Hardy, Jude the Obscure, Wessex Edition (London: Macmillan and Co., 1912), 203.

There was a similar occurrence in the Victorian period upon the 1840 publication of a tract called "On the Possibility of Limiting Populousness" that promoted the idea of gassing children. It was taken by many to be a serious proposal but is now assumed to have been an imitation of Swift. See R.

See "Radical Satire and the Realistic Novel," Essays and Studies 8 (1955): 58-75. 26 See especially Hardy, The Collected Letters of Thomas Hardy, ed. Richard Little Purdy and Michael Millgate, 7 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978-1988), 2:97-106. 27 This is also evidence of a larger Hardyan technique in the representation of violence and death. Such cool specificity of detail recalls the similarly after-the-fact report of Tess's murder of Alec in Tess of the d'Urbervilles. In that novel it is the householder, Mrs. Brooks, who comes across the first evidence of death. She looks up at the ceiling and notices a spot on the white surface: "It was about the size of a wafer when she first observed it, but it speedily grew as large as the palm of her hand, and then she could perceive that it was red" (488). 28 Such violently hyperrealistic narration unsettles many readers of Hardy. Philip Larkin, for instance, observed upon rereading Hardy: "I am more conscious than I was, too, of an undercurrent of sensual cruelty in the writing-this seems an extraor- 546 Terminal Satire and Jude the Obscure</page><page sequence="29">dinary thing to say of Hardy, but for all his gentleness he had a strong awareness of, and even relish for, both the macabre and the cruel."
