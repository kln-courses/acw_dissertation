GREENSTEIN Deconstruction and Biblical Narrative . . . deconstruction is nothing if not a way of reading. . -1 Derrida is clearly out to do more than develop new techniques of reading. . . .2 . . . the implications of deconstruction for the study of literature are far from clear. . . .3 AS ONE OF THE MOST RADICAL and difficult expressions of postpositivist thinking, deconstruction has unsurprisingly provoked both enthusiasm and dread. The recently published Literary Guide to the Bible specifically excludes the bugaboo deconstruction, along with Marxism and feminism, as an unsympathetic approach to reading biblical literature.4 The editors of the Guide, Robert Alter and Frank Kermode, maintain quite correctly that deconstruction does not share the New Critical and structuralist view of the literary text as a contained and unified system of codes.5 Jacques Derrida, who first developed deconstruction, clearly aimed "to unlock and break out of what have been seen as the constricting forms and patterning of structuralism."6 Deconstruction contends not only that the present center does not hold; it holds that no center can hold.7 Although Alter and Kermode claim to allow for an eclectic pluralism in their Guide,8 this openness must draw the line at a criticism such as deconstruction in which a text is shown to be "necessarily divided against itself."9 The unity of the literary, or any artistic, work has been adopted by Alter and Kermode as the common, unifying presupposition of all the PROOFTEXTS 9 (1989): 43-71 ? 1989 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">44 EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN authors in their Guide. The assumption of the Bible's unity in ancient times, by classical midrash, for example, reflects a belief in the unity of God and the revealed character of the sacred text. The assumption of the Bible's literary unity by contemporary critics stems from a Western notion of the integrity of the human personality. Freudian psycho analysis, however, as Geoffrey Hartman has noted, "has intensified our suspicions concerning the unity of art by suggesting that the unity of the person is at best synthetic or adaptive and more likely to be multiple and self-divisive."10 If so, one might consider the possibility that texts, like those of us who read them, can be "divided against themselves," and one might entertain a criticism such as deconstruction that would by not presuming unity reveal internal division and instability within texts. Little has been published as yet on the applications of deconstruc tion to the Hebrew Bible, and I have seen virtually no purely deconstructive readings of it.11 An issue of Semeia devoted to Derrida talked about rather than did deconstruction.12 There is, however, rapidly growing interest and decided influence in certain quarters.13 Biblicists will quite naturally hesitate to work deconstructively, partly (pace Alter and Kermode) because that would demand a suspension of conventional beliefs and partly too, perhaps, because reading deconstruction is a demanding enterprise. In any event, one cannot assess the potential benefits of deconstruction without understanding it and seeing how it might be applied, and so I have endeavored to explain something of the background and philosophy of deconstruction as the context for my own reading of certain biblical texts, the narrative of the deaths of Aaron's sons Nadav and Avihu in particular. While I shall be indicating below those aspects of deconstruction that clearly militate against the Bible's own professed positions, I shall also suggest the values or uses of deconstruction for reading biblical narrative. These values or uses may be not only hermeneutical but theological as well. Before proceeding, there is one more preliminary matter I should like to address. As a mode of discourse, deconstruction has strong implications for the way we write. Nietzsche developed an aphoristic, fragmented style as a reflex of his understanding that we cannot attain completeness and true coherence in knowing.14 To write continuous, straightforward prose would be to deny or suppress the kaleidoscopic character of our knowledge. The critical discourse to which we are accustomed is composed in a narrative form that by its nature presup poses completeness?a beginning, a middle, and an end.15 Derrida seeks to decenter and liberate from (always superimposed) structure on the one hand and to underscore the dynamic play within language on the other by expressing himself in unconventional form and rhetoric.16 A</page><page sequence="3">Deconstruction and Biblical Narrative 45 new way of thinking prompts a new way of writing. Though hardly going all the way, I have attempted to incorporate certain aspects of this quite earnest and provocative mode of discourse into the present essay. The style is not intended to distract but to call attention to the question of how we make meaning and how all discourse is in a real sense a composite?what Derrida terms a "bricolation"?and echo of prior discourse. Another deconstructive rhetorical tradition, if one can call it that, is that one reads texts such that they are not merely the object of a concern with language but are themselves about a concern with lan guage in the most basic sense.17 While this convention manifests the fundamental Derridean idea that it is we who inscribe what we read with sense, it is a strategy that has independent merit for returning us always to text. Derrida has cogently broken down the boundaries between theoretical, philosophical discourse and literature,18 so that it will make sense for us to track the philosophical development of Derrida's critical process through a reading of?in this case?biblical texts. We begin with difference. In the beginning was difference, accord ing to what we read in Genesis.19 God began creation by speaking the word "light," or, before it referred to anything. In the theory of Saussure, the starting-point for all modern linguistic investigation, the sign comprises two concurrent, indivisible, yet distinguishable ele ments?the concept, the "signified"; and the "sound-image" that repre sents it in speech, "the signifier."20 "The bond between the signifier and the signified is arbitrary,"21 by which Saussure means conventional.22 A language is a system of signs. Meaning is determined by speakers observing the relations among signs. Signs are distinguished from one another by their differences. Words, as signifiers, have no intrinsic relation to the concepts they signify. They are the product of relations with no positive value: "in language there are only differences without positive terms."23 "Their most precise characteristic is in being what the others are not."24 "Proof of this is that the value of a term may be modified without either its meaning or its sound being affected, solely because a neighboring term has been modified."25 Once values have been assigned to signifiers by linking them with signifieds, the resul tant sign does carry a positive value.26 In Gen. 1:3 the word or does not yet signify a signified, is not yet a signifier.27 It differs from the word the narrator uses to denominate the pre-existing darkness, hoshekh (v. 2), but the narrator is telling in retrospect. There was no differentia tion yet, no definition. Differentiation (of signifieds) comes only after "there was light"?vayhi or (v. 3). Light is defined only by its contrast</page><page sequence="4">46 EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN with darkness: "He divided, God did, between the light and between the darkness" (v. 4).28 It is this division, this difference, between light and dark, that creates them.29 Had there been light to begin with and had God created darkness, in this respect it would have made no difference, as it would have produced difference. One without the other could not be said to exist in any intelligible way. Their meaning, and in fact all meaning, is relative?the product of difference. The word for light, or, however, pre-existed both the darkness and the light as it differs from the only word that precedes it?y ehi, "Let there be. . ." (v. 3). In the narrated time of the Genesis 1 narrative the words yehi and or anticipate becoming and light, respectively. The signifiers do not represent the signifieds, they precede them. They are meaningful only by virtue of their difference from each other and from all other possible words. They seem to exist as words that stand for something, as verbal signifiers. But signifiers cannot be signifiers unless they signify some signified. In the presence of signifiers without signifieds we hear the sound of one hand clapping. There is a further paradox in the word we now know as the verbal form yehi, "Let there be!" As we read on we contrast it with the verbal form vayhi, "there was." The two forms differ in tense (future/past) or aspect (incompleted action/completed action). (Grammarians are divided.)30 Either way the word yehi, were it already to signify anything, would precede any difference in time. Time could be indicated only after the contrast of signifiers yehi/vayhi came into be(com)ing. This is further problematic, for the concept of time itself is only introduced after light begins to alternate with darkness.31 It is their difference that creates time: "He divided, God did, between the light and between the darkness. He called, God did, the light 'day/ and the darkness he called 'night'" (vv. 4-5). We anticipate the creation of time by projecting our already formed concept of time onto the text (more on which below). By the time God named day and night they had already become, like the animals the first man {ha'adam) will name in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 2:19-20). Day and night as signifieds might seem to precede the words "day" and "night" as signifiers. But that is not so. Day and night are not the same as light and darkness. More precisely, "day" and "light," on the one hand, and "night" and "darkness," on the other, are not variable signifiers of the same signified. "Day" denotes all the light between two periods of darkness, and "night" denotes all the darkness between two periods of light.32 Each term entails a presence following an absence, or an absence following a presence; each involves time. As I have said, it is the sense of difference between periods of light and dark that creates the contrast day/night, and with it the concept of time. In the realm of the signifier, tense precedes time. In Genesis, signifiers play by themselves before they are attached to signifieds.</page><page sequence="5">Deconstruction and Biblical Narrative 47 In Saussure's system signifier and signified are paired within the sign yet distinct. Derrida will find this distinction to be "problematical at its root" because "every signified is also in the position of a signifier."33 In order to appreciate the dynamic nature of signification, consider the Tower of Babel story. "It was, all the land was one language and one speech" (Gen. 11:1).34 That language was "the holy tongue" (so Rashi ad loc.), Hebrew, the language God reportedly spoke in creating the world. Because it was God's language, it was not conventional; the bond between signifiers and signifieds was not arbitrary but authoritatively determined. At first, linguistic harmony obscured an underlying cultural differentiation. The narrator notes that the easterners?the builders of Babel?and the Hebrews despite the unity of their language had different building systems: "for them [i.e., the easterners] bricks were as stone, and bitumen was for them as mortar" (v. 3). The function of the building blocks was served by culturally differentiated materials. The easterners used man-made bricks, the Hebrews would have used God-made stone. Westermann, in line with many other critics, calls this comment in verse 3 "an explanatory note," "a parenthesis," implying its secondary interpolation into the text.35 The deconstructor seeks to read in these margins; it is no less text than the rest. Indeed, the allegedly parenthetic aside may serve as the key to the entire story. According to Benno Jacob, "one speech" (devarim ahadim) in contrast to "one language" (safa ehat) refers to syntax (connected discourse) and vocabulary, respectively.36 If so (and even if not), because the narrative foregrounds wordplay and language,37 one can draw an analogy between the building of the city and tower and the linguistic practice of the builders. Syntax binds words as mortar/bitumen binds stones/ bricks. The building can be read as an allegory of language. The builders operated under certain false ideas about language and signification. First, they thought that different signifiers could represent the same signified. The phonological difference between hemar, "bitumen,"38 and homer, "clay," i.e., "mortar," on the one hand, and between levena, "brick," and leaven, "(for) stone," on the other,39 seemed so slight that it would make no difference. Small phonological distinctions can make all the difference in the wor(l)d, however. A greater error was that they thought they could, like the God of Genesis, establish unique and permanent unities between a signifier and a signified. They sought to make for themselves "a name" (v. 4)?a permanent and irreplaceable signifier of themselves, or rather of extensions of themselves, the tower and city. As Derrida observes, these builders are the sons of Shem, "Name."40 Bearing the name of Name, these mortals would "imposte] their tongue on the entire universe on the basis of this sublime edification."41 The name, they believed, would forever signify</page><page sequence="6">48 EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN themselves as signified. The story, in which YHWH shattered their linguistic cohesion and renamed their city, proves otherwise. To explain a third, more profound error, we return to our reading of the narrative. So long as the builders of the tower and city bind the same signifiers to the same signifieds, they proceed smoothly. But God endeavors to undo their plan by collapsing their foundation?the fact that they employ a single language (see v. 6), a consistent set of signs. "Come, let us go down that we may confuse their language there, so that one man cannot understand his neighbor's language" (v. 7). Rashi (ad loc.) insightfully suggests how the confusion occurred: "This one would ask for a brick, and the other would bring him mortar. . . ." The words in the two languages were homophonous! The same signifier would signify one signified to one person and a different signified to another. It is the reverse of the error we noted above. The inevitable frustration and anger that would ensue would lead to a lot of head bashing (so Rashi). Perhaps Rashi was particularly sensitive to the capacity of the same "sound-image" to represent different "concepts" in different languages because he perceived that even within the same language a signifier can have more than one signified. The bond between signifier and signified may be unstable. Meaning flickers. Rashi understood (albeit differently from Saussure) that meaning is derived from the contrasts among signs. Gen. 11:1 reads that "all the land was one language (safa ehat) and one speech (devarim ahadim)." As "speech" contrasts with "language," they must, Rashi felt, differ in sense. In extraordinary fashion, even for him, Rashi proffers no fewer than four meanings for "one speech." First, their speech was one?they plotted in unison against the preroga tives of God. "One" refers to the subject of the discourse. Second, they spoke One-talk?talk directed against God, the One in the world. Third, "one" (ahadim) by its phonetic similarity to "sharp" (haddim) evokes another sense. The builders spoke sharply: they calculated that the sky would imminently fall and attempted to avert the disaster by propping it up. In this construal of meaning "one" modifies "speech" in a quasi-adverbial manner. To get this sense Rashi must read the signifier ahadim not as the direct signifier of a signified but?and this is quite typical of midrash42?as the signifier of a signified that itself becomes the signifer of another signified. It sets off a (limited) chain of signification. We find an analogous trigger of signification in the name YHWH gives to the newly built city, havel, "Babylon."43 The name serves first to denominate the city: it signifies a concrete signified. God, however, charges it with a second signification. The name havel must signify another signified, the verbal stem h-l-l, which in turn signifies the signified concept, "confusion"?". . . he called its name Babylon (havel),</page><page sequence="7">Deconstruction and Biblical Narrative 49 for there he confused (balai), YHWH did, the language of all the land" (v. 9). According to Rashi's fourth comment on the locution "one speech," the phrase need not be interpreted in immediate relation to what follows?building the city and tower. Rashi, at verse 9, summing up, at a remove from the narrative's beginning, "forgets" his earlier proximate readings of "one speech" and interprets it as the harmo nious state in which the builders lived before embarking on their (self-) project(ion). Rashi's repeated substitutions of signifieds for the same signifier, along with his awareness of how signifieds can themselves become signifiers, exemplifies the dynamic play of signification. In a close critical reading of Saussure, Derrida demonstrates that not only does Saussure fail to allow for this dynamic play, his semiology is fraught with questionable assumptions of Western metaphysics.44 By distinguishing signifier and signified within the sign, he "leaves open the possibility of thinking a concept signified in and of itself, a concept simply present for thought, independent of a relationship to language, that is of a relationship to a system of signifiers."45 In order to expose those faulty assumptions Derrida locates contradictions, inconsistencies, incoherencies in Saussure's writing and explains how such a difficulty (aporia)*6 must inevitably follow. The analytical method, or, more precisely, the critical mode of discourse that Derrida develops is deconstruction?taking apart the unacknowledged presuppositions of a text by identifying how, on their account, the text deconstructs itself.47 Derrida both illustrates deconstruction's mode of operation and pro pounds its core ideas in his reading of the founder of phenomenology, Husserl.48 "It is perhaps the essay which I like most," Derrida has said.49 One can see why: it says what it does, and it does what it says. In establishing the rationale for deconstruction it is always already (as Derrida likes to say) deconstructive. Husserl took up the project of Descartes, to establish that which we can know for certain and proceed to explain how we know what we know.50 By bracketing out all phenomena that depend on some prior concept or mediating sense, Husserl sought, on the one hand, to expose our assumptions and beliefs, and, on the other, to identify what we perceive immediately, purely, without the interference of something we already know or feel. The only thing, in the end, that we can posit absolutely, Husserl thought, is the "I," the Ego?pure self consciousness.51 All else can be shown to be a construct of some sort, the product of ideas, not unmediated perception. We apprehend not by direct perception but by directing our consciousness and objectifying our ideas. Through a Cartesian method of radical skepticism, Husserl attempted to create the science of science itself, "the one science that criticizes itself at the same time."52</page><page sequence="8">50 EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN Derrida would seem to be engaged in a similar project. His target, however, is not merely epistemology but the most pervasive assump tions of metaphysics, those which even Husserl uncritically accepted. Derrida's distinctive (though not unique) mode of operation is not to attack one position by posing against it a superior one. Accordingly, Derrida, though heavily indebted to Nietzsche,53 does not demolish HusserTs notion that self-consciousness is immediately perceptible by referring to Nietzsche's teaching that self is it-self an ideational construct, a "synthetic concept."54 We begin with difference. Nor will Derrida undermine Husserl's theory of signs by adducing Saussure. Rather, Derrida works within Husserl's text to puncture and deflate it from the inside out. He deconstructs Husserl. Husserl had not recognized the mediating role of language in affecting consciousness.55 Derrida challenges this denial. Without even defining "sign," Husserl distinguished between signs that "indicate" directly and signs that "express" as a result of will and consciousness. Derrida shows that even Husserl's "expressive" signs involve subjective associations, reflections, re-presentations to one's consciousness, intention. Husserl's distinction between two types of sign implicitly manifests the body/soul dichotomy of ancient Greek and subsequent Western philosophy. Meaning presupposes the presence of will or inten tion to the self. It is impossible, as Husserl asserted, to separate reality from representation in language. Language already represents. Husserl wanted to remove the sign from immediate self-consciousness in order to save the metaphysical idea that something is always present to us. But even the sole survivor of Husserl's most extreme bracketing, the "I," already implies an opposition between the "I" that lives and is and the "I" who will be dead and is not. Derrida proceeds to show how retention as a mode of perception that is continuous with the now involves time. Time, by definition, is relational, more extensive than an ever-present instantaneous moment. Derrida has caught Husserl in a serious inconsistency. More over, the very concept of the present implies the non-present. Meaning (like being in the Creation narrative) is always already the product of difference. When Adam and Eve chose to disobey God and eat from the Tree of Knowing, they applied a sense of discrimination that was not to be theirs until they had already eaten from the Tree.56 Expression, Husserl maintained, must be immediately present. Derrida has delineated two ways in which it is not. Now Derrida attacks the same central point in Husserl's phenomenology from a different angle. Expression must be conveyed by a medium that is purely unworldly, unobjectified. That medium is the voice. The voice precedes consciousness, or, contends Derrida, is consciousness.57 Auto affection, "the exercise of the voice," conditions self-presence; in</page><page sequence="9">Deconstruction and Biblical Narrative 51 consequence, "no pure transcendental reduction [bracketing of all intermediation] is possible."58 That is, a priori one cannot bracket out all effects of consciousness because pure self-consciousness itself is condi tioned. Signification is conditioned by difference, or rather diff?rance, a hybrid term incorporating both spatial difference and temporal defer ral. Time itself is the product of metaphor: it does not literally "move." Accordingly, "the living present... is always already a trace."59 One can be aware only of what has been. The very sense of time cannot occur to us until time has past. Tense, as in Genesis 1, precedes time. If signification involves diff?rance, a subject cannot perceive in Husserl's unmediated sense. Metaphysics is grounded in a belief in some absolute presence. With the insight that presence is never fully there and is realized in traces?indications of absence?metaphysics, Derrida avers, has come to an end.60 The presence of the signified to the signifier, of even the sign itself, is a fundamental notion in Saussurean theory that is supplanted, or plowed under, by Derrida.61 Signs do not indicate presence; they "represent the presence in its absence; they take the place of the present . . . the movement of signs defers the moment of encountering the thing itself. . . ."62 With this Derrida lays the groundwork for his second, more devastating critique of Saussure. Saussurean semiology posits speech as the primary model of language.63 This conforms to the metaphysics undone by Derrida in which voice manifests presence and writing "obscures" and "disguise[s]" that presence.64 Through a deconstruction of many Western philosophers Derrida exposes the aporia in their arguments precisely at those points where speech is privileged over writing. In fact, Derrida argues, if the sign represents but the traces of presence, of absence, then a better model of consciousness than speech is writing.65 Semiology, the science of signs patterned on spoken language, is replaced by "grammatology," the science of writing. In writing we understand the trace of presence that is absent; writing, therefore, serves as the better model of experience. Experience, then, is textuality, a tissue of traces.66 Meaning is not present in writing??criture, anglicized as ?cri ture67?but emerges from the play of diff?rance?anglicized as diff?rance with an "a"68?among the traces of presence. "Like diff?rance, the trace is never presented as such. In presenting itself it becomes effaced; in being sounded it dies away. . . ."69 "Play is the disruption of presence. The presence of an element is always a signifying and substitutive reference inscribed in a system of differences and the movement of a chain."70 The text, the tissue of traces, does not embody or convey meaning. It is the scene of activity in which the reader inscribes meaning. Meaning, then, is unstable, shimmers, like the self-effacing traces that are the scene of sense.71 "The unconscious text is already a</page><page sequence="10">52 EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN weave of pure traces, differences in which meaning and force are united?a text nowhere present, consisting of archives which are always already transcriptions," writes Derrida.72 Clearly Derrida is describing a totally different way for understanding experience. Deconstruction is a different way of thinking. Derrida suggests in his deconstruction of Freud that the mind is it-self already structured from made meaning. Reading a text is writing a text, inscribing it with the meaning that we find in it.73 Recall God's creation of light in Genesis 1. Texts, written texts, are made of texts already made (a fact I have been highlighting in the composition of the present essay). All language echoes other language.74 The implications for reading biblical narrative can reach as far as one will let them.75 But before entering into that barely charted territory, it will be worthwhile to note that while language for Derrida is written??criture?it is not literal.76 Language is always other than what it says, always already figured. Consider the number of obvious metaphorical usages in the first sentence of this paragraph: "implica tions" (do I not draw them out?), "can" (what "can" an implication by itself do?), "reach" (with what arms?), "let them" (see how the implications have been personified). Think of my repeated usage of "on the one hand ... on the other hand. . . ." To what extent is our habit of contrasting two elements in an opposition conditioned by our two handedness? The root of language, of assertion, of "truth" itself is metaphor.77 Conviction follows from the tentatively apt analogy, as Nietzsche, in an oft-cited passage, proclaims: What, then, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms?in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins.78 One of deconstruction's projects is to lay bare the figurative, non literal, false?or perhaps rather, untrue?within commonly accepted language. In order to accomplish this task the deconstructor must, ironically, use language, perhaps the very terms that one is deconstructing. To catch the thief one must use the thief herself. Deconstruction, like Husserl's phenomenology, must subject itself to deconstruction. In order to use language differing from itself in sense, free from the meanings by which it has been inscribed, Derrida adopted from Heidegger the practice of writing "under erasure."79 To indicate, for example, that when we speak of textuality as traces that aXe no longer,</page><page sequence="11">Deconstruction and Biblical Narrative 53 we can write the word "are"?representing an elusive, always deferred presence?under erasure since we confine ourselves by our linguistic habits to speak of that which X, when, in theory and in fact, itX not. ThereX no present. The technique, or style, of writing under erasure could be useful in making ourselves aware of the metaphors and theology by which we live in reading biblical narrative. I might read Gen. 1:3-4, then, as follows: ?*e sXd, God did, "iXt there light!" and there vXs light. fcfe sXv, God did, the light, that it vXs good. Most premodern readers would not read any of this passage under erasure. What we might read as the anthropomorphism and person ification of God they would interpret literally. But a committed deconstructor could not rest contented with the above reading. Another important term to place under erasure would be "God." Deconstruction, as modelled by Derrida, seeks, as we have seen, to pull out the bottom from under all metaphysics. Husserl had already felt compelled to bracket out a transcendent God as a "highly mediated" construct of consciousness.80 In Derrida's view Western thought has posited God in order to prevent the chain of signification from extending endlessly into oblivion.81 By setting up God, as Genesis does, as the author(ity) behind language, signifiers will always reach an ultimate signified. God has been the "transcendental signified" in which meaning has inhered, the one assurance of presence behind the phenomenological curtain of absence. The transcendental signified is inconsistent with Derrida's theory of signification: "I define writing as the impossibility of a chain arresting itself on a signified that would not relaunch the signified, in that the signified is already in the position of the signifying substitution."82 The builders of Babel, in attempting to produce a permanent signification, were doomed to failure. So, for Derrida, is the God idea. God is one of those concepts the West has cherished in order to hold the center, impose structure and finitude, a sense of order and arrangement?the sense we get in any conventional reading of Gen esis. When, in the history of Western metaphysics, physical realities evolved into language and "everything became discourse," "it was necessary to begin thinking that there was no center, . . . that it was not a fixed locus but a function, a sort of nonlocus in which an infinite number of sign-substitutions came into play."83 Deconstruction would subvert any presumption of a center, implying a given structure; it would deny any guarantor of such structure, such as God, or any foundation of absolute knowledge, such as the mind of God. There can,</page><page sequence="12">54 EDWARD L, GREENSTEIN then, be no unity of text, as Alter and Kermode would have it.84 For theology, "deconstruction ... is in the final analysis the death of God put into writing. . . ."85 "Deconstruction/7 Derrida insists, "is not neutral. It intervenes."86 To deconstruct the Bible would reduce it to the same nothingness to which other texts have been deconstructed. One would be left in the end with a Nietzschean vision of the void. Derrida's clearing the ground, Hartman has suggested, might allow for some other, non-metaphysical building in its stead.87 Deconstruction might pave the way for types of constructive theology?confecting models of God?in place of the descriptive theologies that have typified Western religions.88 On the other hand, the explicit anti-theology of Derridean thought might find constructive systems to be as antithetical as YHWH found the Tower of Babel. It had to be smashed. Perhaps for this reason, Miscall, who had applied certain deconstructive techniques in his reading of biblical narratives,89 felt compelled to demur in his subsequent work: "This is not a deconstructive reading, since I see no need to deconstruct the Bible in the same sense that de Man or Derrida feels the need to deconstruct the texts he [sic] reads."90 Deconstruction takes apart the system it reads. It would be ironic indeed to read the Bible according to an approach so out of sympathy with the Bible's own outlook.91 One might nevertheless find good reasons to perform deconstruc tive operations on the Bible. It is the deconstructor's tack, as we have seen in Derrida's reading of Husserl, to dismantle the text from within. One could say that in so doing one is fulfilling the destiny of the text itself. Husserl presented his phenomenological criticism as "if it were the secret longing of the whole philosophy of modern times."92 It is basic to Derrida's position that the texts he reads are self-deconstruct ing. Derrida, the reader, teases out their implications. Now what if one were to view the Bible as a model of deconstruction? One could then perform deconstruction in response to the Bible's inherent tendency. Herbert Schneidau has characterized the Hebrew Bible as a text that continually subjects its own values to criticism in a sort of proto deconstructive fashion.93 With respect to God, the Bible does not present the deity systematically, and rarely through description. YHWH becomes known through his acts, by later retrospective inter pretation, through displacement.94 One might challenge Schneidau on his admittedly Lutheran emphasis on prophecy at the expense of law, or on his relativistic readings of self-proclaimed absolute texts. There is, however, something of the subversive, or at least the restive, within the complex arrangement of materials in so textured a text as the Torah, and we shall reconsider this matter below. One could further argue the consonance of the Bible with the deconstructive program by pointing to the indivisibility of signifier and</page><page sequence="13">Deconstruction and Biblical Narrative 55 signified that is reflected in the fact that Hebrew davar means "word" and "act" and "thing."95 Derrida himself has connected his views on the primacy of writing and the dynamic nature of signification within the Hebraic tradition.96 Yet, one can hardly overlook the central impor tance of God's presence in biblical narrative, literalized (or literally) in the aura, the kavod, that so often was made manifest before the eyes of the Israelites (e.g., Exod. 40:34-38; Lev. 9:23). The Torah's reiteration that YHWH "walks" among the people (cf., e.g., Exod. 33:16; Deut. 23:15), even if interpreted metaphorically, gives a strong impression of presence. Israel's worship of YHWH was predicated on its witness of the divine presence in their present, albeit often a recollected present. The point can be underscored by noting the verbal resemblance between witness and worship in such a verse as Exod. 14:31: "It saw (vayyar), Israel did, the hand, the great one, that he had done, YHWH had, against Egypt; they feared (vayyiru), the people did, YHWH." Deconstruction must blow away the cloud of God's presence that hovers over virtually all biblical narrative. One might do better to exploit deconstruction as a means of liberating ourselves from what Harold Bloom has termed "facticity"? "the state of being a fact, as an inescapable and unalterable fact."97 By exposing the root ideas supporting biblical narrative, we become aware of the extent to which we are entangled in them ourselves. Our critical reading of the Bible, or of any other text, is liable to be compromised by our unconscious acceptance of the views of which we are supposed to be critical.98 Like the fruit of the Tree of Knowing, deconstruction may open our eyes to facts so commonplace we had not noticed them before. We might, like the couple in Eden, blush at our nakedness. Certain recent feminist criticism of the Bible, for example, has had this effect.99 Similarly, we have assumed more than we are apt to realize of traditional perspectives on the biblical text. The mode of deconstruc tion, by its denial of given centers and structures, favors the roads not taken, the margins, even the unthinkable, or more precisely, the unthought. To get a better look, it likes to invert. Bloom, for example, escapes the powerful facticity of conventional readings of the Garden story by reading it Gnostically: the Serpent is not Satan but hero.100 This is not how the story has been generally read. J has been read straight, not ironically. But if meaning is indeed inscribed within the traces, the product of presuppositions that are always already in the reader's mind, then an ironist will find an ironist in J just as a traditionalist will find a traditionalist. Consider again the Tower of Babel text. When YHWH marks the builders' initial progress he says: "Now they will not be blocked from all that they had schemed to do" (Gen. 11:6b). YHWH sounds worried. Rashi, our proto deconstructor, subverts this sense. A pious traditionalist, Rashi does</page><page sequence="14">56 EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN not allow a God who could feel alarm at the idea that the builders might succeed. Accordingly, Rashi inscribes the text with the interrogative and reads it as a question: "Shall they not be blocked from all that they had schemed to do?" The alternatives of meaning are always already with the reader. Center and margin, top and bottom all depend on perspective. An ironist will find an ironist, and a religious reader will find God in the Torah. The Derridean incisor to cut at all must cut both ways. I hope to show that by implementing strategies of deconstruction as hermeneutical tools one can both pry open and plumb more deeply into biblical narrative. One can perhaps even enhance the presence of God, at least by virtue of having inscribed it. Rather than venture to summarize here the reading strategies that one might adopt from deconstruction,101 I apply various of those strategies to a reading of a brief, opaque narrative?the story of how Aaron's eldest sons, Nadav and Avihu, died. I choose this passage for a number of reasons, not least of them the fact that the text has been read (inscribed) by many readers over many centuries in numerous ways. All along we shall be asking whether the text deconstructs itself. We shall find it a model of undecidabilty. Here is my rendering of the passage (Lev. 10:1-5; verse numbers are in square brackets): They took, sons of Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, did, each man his tray; they put in them fire; they placed on it incense; they brought near before YHWH fire, strange (fire), that he did not command them. [2] It came out, fire did, from before YHWH;102 it consumed them; they died before YHWH. [3] He spoke, Moses did, to Aaron: "It is that which he spoke, YHWH did, saying, 'Among my near-ones I shall be hallowed, and before all the people I shall be honored'." He was still, Aaron was. [4] He called, Moses did, to Mishael and to Elzaphan, sons of Uzziel, uncle of Aaron, and he said to them: "Draw near, carry your brothers away from before the holy-place to outside of the camp." [5] They drew near, and they carried them in their tunics to outside of the camp, according to that which he spoke, Moses did. The text is rife with ambiguities. The most obvious of them result from undefined pronominal antecedents. Who, in verse 1, is the subject of "he did not command?"103 To what does "that which" in verse 3 refer? In whose tunics did Mishael and Elzaphan remove the detritus of their hapless cousins (v. 5)? Each of these ambiguities has been exploited by exegetes as a clue to solving one of the several mysteries of this episode?the story of what looks to most readers like a punishment in search of a crime.104 Some assume that it was YHWH who "did not command" Nadav and Avihu to bring the fire.105 Others assume it was Moses, in which case Nadav and Avihu were usurping prerogatives of Moses' authority.106 As for "it is that which" in verse 3, most commen</page><page sequence="15">Deconstruction and Biblical Narrative 57 tators, like Aaron, are silent, stymied perhaps. Ehrlich foregrounds the issue: "It (hu) cannot refer to what YHWH had said because YHWH had never said any such thing. It must refer, rather, not to what precedes but to what follows."107 By incinerating Aaron's sons YHWH has quite flamboyantly made a point: "Among my near-ones I shall be hal lowed. . . ." "Near-ones" here, Ehrlich contends, means Aaron alone. (One should not be thrown off the track by the plural suffix on "near ones.") We shall discuss the ambiguity of "near-ones" below; for now we turn to the third ambiguous reference in this passage, "their tunics" (v. 5). "Their" could, of course, refer to Mishael and Elzaphan. That would be too simple, it would seem, for virtually all commentators?or they have been so caught up in the facticity of prior readings that they have not even seen this possibility. Assuming the pronoun refers to Nadav and Avihu, the puzzle is more intriguing. How could they have been borne out in their own clothes after they had been consumed by fire?108 The midrash Mekhilta demilluim explains how the priests' bodies were all that was burned: the fire entered their nostrils and consumed them from the inside out, stopping at their garments.109 Philo is more "rational" but presupposes more background: Nadav and Avihu strip ped naked before making their offering?naturally, their clothes were untouched by the fire.110 None of these ambiguities can be resolved, except by control ling their references, incorporating them into a specific (pseudo-) comprehensive interpretation of the story?shaving the pieces until they fit into the puzzle one has imagined. Deconstruction holds that ambiguity is not an occasional property of literature, selectively enrich ing the sense of the text. Ambiguity is characteristic of language itself, the dynamic play in the scene of reading.111 While other critical approaches attempt to solve the puzzle, deconstruction denies the objectivity of order and "renounce[s] the ambition to master or demystify its subject (text, psyche) by technocratic, predictive, or authoritarian formulas."112 Meaning is always indeterminate. Most readers, in their efforts to circumscribe sense, enlist a particular hermeneutic to decide the interpretation. Most are trans fixed by the fire: there was something foul about the fire.113 Haran,114 for example, elaborates the view of R. Abraham Ibn Ezra (12th c): Nadab and Abihu intended to make an offering of incense in their censers (Lev. 10:1-3). They were punished because they offered it to Yahweh in "strange fire," that is, fire other than that which was kept burning on the altar for the daily sacrifice. Nadab and Abihu apparently [emphasis added] took their fire from somewhere outside the altar-area and placed it in their censers, as it is stated: "each took his censer and put fire in it."</page><page sequence="16">58 EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN It should be remarked at the outset that the certainty of this exegesis is belied by the exegete's evocation of doubt when he honestly introduces the word "apparently." We are being cautioned: assumptions are being made. The prooftext cited is certainly no proof?it says nothing about the source of the fire. Indeed, a persistent problem with this reading is the fact that the "fire" is presented first as mere, unqualified "fire." It is modified as "strange" (more on which below) only after it had been offered with incense before YHWH.115 We may then raise other possibilities of meaning. Perhaps there was something wrong with the priests bringing incense.116 Compare Noordtzij: "Apparently [emphasis added] they intended to offer daily incense that only the high priest was authorized to do."117 The telltale "apparently" admits to a high degree of doubt, leaving room for the contrary claim: "Along with Aaron and their brothers, Eleazar and Ithamar, [Nadab and Abihu] had just been ordained as priests. It may be assumed [emphasis added], therefore, that they had the right to offer incense."118 The need to "assume" bespeaks the undecidability of the sense. Perhaps, as Wenham suggests, the fire was made "strange" because YHWH (or Moses) had not commanded it.119 Though possible, this reading can be challenged. The phrase "that he did not command them" can be understood as a description of the "strange fire" after the fact rather than as an explanation of its cause. The nature of the fire, in other words, conditioned its being not-commanded. Perhaps, alternatively, Nadav and Avihu were in fact unauthorized to offer incense.120 In support of this interpretation Gradwohl adduces Lev. 16:12, which prescribes that the high priest remove fire from the altar and bring incense into the holy of holies.121 One cannot, however, deduce from this prescription a proscription of incense offerings by other priests. On the other hand, the term for "strange," zar, may serve as a clue. Milgrom has made a respectable philological case that zar refers to unauthorized cultic personnel.122 The verb "to draw near," qarev, denotes encroachment of the sacred precincts. In our passage, however, the verb "to draw near" is not predicated of Nadav and Avihu. They brought the fire near (hiqriv), and it is not at all clear that zar has the same force when said of objects such as "fire" as it has of personnel.123 Moreover, when Moses orders Mishael and Elzaphan to "draw near" (qarev), and they do so (vv. 4-5), it is hardly a matter of encroachment. There is a play in our text of only five verses among the hiqriv of Nadav and Avihu's offering, the qarev of Mishael and Elzaphan's response, and the enigmatic statement of YHWH: "Among my near-ones (qerovay) I shall be hallowed" (v. 3). Does this imply that Nadav and Avihu were not YHWH's "near-ones" (emphasis on "near ones")? Or does this mean to condemn what Nadav and Avihu as priests who should have</page><page sequence="17">Deconstruction and Biblical Narrative 59 known better did as a desecration of YHWH's cult (emphasis on "I shall be hallowed")? The succeeding phrase, "before all the people I shall be honored," is prone to the same alternatives in emphasis. Assuming that Nadav and Avihu acted in view of the assembled Israelites (end of chapter 9), one could read it: "before all the people" is the place to honor me. Or one could read: "before all the people" you had better show me honorl This clause seems less critical than the preceding one, but it cannot be used to decide the meaning of the preceding. Back to square one. Shinan wants to settle the issue simply, using two strategies.124 One capitalizes on the parallelism of "fire" and "fire": since the supposed punishment is divine fire, the sin, too, must have related to the fire.125 One can go further and note that the phrase describing the incineration of Nadav and Avihu?"It came out, fire did, from before YHWH; it consumed them (Lev. 10:2)"?echoes the description of the divine ignition of the altar immediately above (9:24). The notion of measure-for-measure retribution is well known in the Bible.126 It is, however, neither universal nor predictive. The man gathering wood on the Sabbath was, after all, stoned to death (Num. 15:32-36). He was neither burned nor impaled. Moreover, as we have seen above, "fire"/"fire" is not the only motivic-linguistic parallelism in our passage. One could argue along similar lines that YHWH's declaration, "Among my near-ones I shall be hallowed," points the accusing finger at Nadav and Avihu as the culprits, not at the fire that they took. Again, we recall that the fire only explicitly became "strange" after it had been "brought near" by the young priests. The second of Shinan's strategies is to interpret Scripture by Scripture. He cites three other passages in the Torah in which the death of Nadav and Avihu is mentioned: Lev. 16:1; Num. 3:4; and Num. 26:61. In his text Shinan states that the expression "strange fire" repeats three times.127 But in a footnote128?and through independent checking?one finds that not every passage refers to the "strange fire." It is telling that in order to proffer any interpretation, one must select and suppress textual data, forcing the square peg into the round hole. The Torah resists such oversimplification. As Gradwohl observes, even within the so-called Priestly material of the Torah, the death of Nadav and Avihu is differently motivated.129 Num. 3:4 and 26:61 both describe the deaths "when they brought near fire, strange (fire), before YHWH." Lev. 16:1, however, reads differently: "when they drew near before YHWH, and they died." Here, the deaths seem attributed to the priests' encroachment of the sacred precincts.130 Such an interpretation is consistent with the following verse, which warns Aaron against entering the inner sanctum "at any time." Had Lev. 16:1 conformed to the other passages, one might submit to the uniform interpretation</page><page sequence="18">60 EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN that would result (though it would still be no less an interpretation). The verse, however, impedes any attempt to harmonize. The ancient Aramaic targum, Onkelos, seeks harmony. In conse quence, it does violence to our text. It renders Lev. 16:1 beqarovehon eshata nukhreta?"when they brought near fire, strange (fire)." Other ancient versions similarly succumb to the Hellenistic penchant for order.131 The integrity of the Hebrew source in its diversity stands intact against the efforts of interpreters, ancient and modern, to domesticate it. It is as stubborn as Job in the face of his friends' contentions. In the end God supported Job. Interpretation runs into difficulty?Derrida's aporia?at precisely those points at which it seeks to impose order. The Torah's three references to the story of Nadav and Avihu in Lev. 10:1-5 present two alternative readings of the passage.132 Each, we have seen, is problematic. The Torah would seem to exemplify the play of reading that deconstruction assumes for any text by inscribing the passage one way?placing the onus on the fire (Num. 3:4 and 26:61)? and by inscribing it another way?placing the onus on the personnel (Lev. 16:1-2). It would seem to self-deconstruct. Our reading is hardly exhausted. We had been assuming that the sense of the passage could be located within verses 1-5 of Leviticus 10. Frames, however, are artificial, superimposed at will.133 Let us expand the frame and look at the succeeding text. Rashi cites another classical midrash, this in the name of R. Yishmael.134 Most readers view the death of Nadav and Avihu as an effect and look for a cause. The midrash sees the death-scene as a cause and looks for an effect. The effect holds the key to the cause. In Lev. 10:8-9 YHWH commands the priests to beware entering the sacred precincts drunk with wine or beer?"so that you do not die" (velo' tamutu). If this be the effect, Nadav and Avihu died because they approached YHWH in an intoxicated state.135 The impulse to interpret, to subordinate the text, and not simply to inhabit it, leads some to read words in.136 Others read more in words. Philo spins a reading out of the protagonists' names. The names are not incidental but crucial to his sense of the text. Like a deconstructor who "castles" the center and the margin, exposing the merely relative position of each, Philo reads the plot in the names. Nadav, from the verbal stem n-d-b, "to donate," denotes the one who serves God willingly, without compulsion. Avihu, "My Father is He (i.e., God)" (or "Yah is my Father") represents pious submission to the sovereignty of God.137 The young priests in a fit of ecstasy purposely transgressed the danger limit of the divine presence so that they would be immolated and translated into immortality, like Enoch and Elijah. A text as mystifying as ours prompts far-reaching exercises to make it intelligible. One grasps for clues.</page><page sequence="19">Deconstruction and Biblical Narrative 61 Another midrash returns us to Num. 3:4. Immediately after relat ing the deaths of Nadav and Avihu, in the context of the Aaronide genealogy, the text adds, "and sons, they were not theirs"?i.e., Nadav and Avihu had fathered no sons.138 Could this seeming disregard for the divine commandment to procreate (cf. Gen. 1:22; 9:1) and continue the priestly line have motivated their deaths? Did they, like Esau, belittle their hereditary vocation? Could the genealogical note in Numbers 3 hold the key to the mystery in Leviticus 10? The midrash has made the connection. How long will it remain inscribed? It is ironic that within the Bible's narrative patterns or typologies Nadav and Avihu never had a chance to survive. It is well known that in the Bible's global scheme firstborn sons must yield to their juniors.139 In accordance with this pattern, Aaron's eldest sons must be eliminated to allow Eleazar and Ithamar, the next youngest pair, to receive the mantle of priestly leadership.140 Note the sequence of events related in 1 Chron. 24:1-2: . . . sons of Aaron: Nadav and Avihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. They died, Nadav and Avihu did, before their father, and sons, they were not theirs. (So) they served-as-priests, Eleazar and Ithamar did. One could say that the fact of Eleazar and Ithamar's succession conditioned both the sonlessness (it would not have mattered had they had daughters) and the death of Nadav and Avihu?the extinction of their line. If, indeed, the young priests had to die, the search for a reason for their deaths within the local narrative may be misguided from the start. To put it differently, the narrative may not motivate their deaths at all; there may be no reason to look for. The search for a reason reflects a drive for order within the interpreter (pace Nietzsche). The presupposi tion that there is a reason not only motivates the search (the reader already "knows" that some explanation lurks within the text); it necessarily posits, or superimposes, the structure of sin and punish ment on the story. The doctrine of retribution is found widely in the Torah.141 But one cannot know but only assume that that doctrine is assumed by every Torah text.142 Its presence is a sign of its facticity, the product of a tradition of reading. One service of deconstruction, as noted, is its capacity to break facticity. If, for argument's sake, the narrative of Nadav and Avihu meant to challenge or subvert the absolute rationality of the Torah, the scrutability of divine retribution, we could never find such a meaning were we to posit the pervasiveness of the sin-and-punishment pattern. Perhaps in the way that metaphysi cians were never aware that they presupposed presence because they had been indoctrinated with the idea itself, readers will not be able even to consider the possible irrationality or disorderliness of the Nadav and Avihu narrative if they first assume orderliness.</page><page sequence="20">62 EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN A story in which incinerated bodies are transported on intact garments gives pause/cause to suspend our presumption of reason and order. A scene of reading/writing in which the modifier "strange" stubbornly clings to the second, not the first, mention of the "fire" foregrounds its indeterminacy. The further we explore the possibilities of intelligibility, the knottier we find the jungle. The quest for coherent sense has gone up in in-cense. Our search for the rational God of the cultic law has led us to ponder the imponderable mysterium tremendum of Otto.143 Reading our story, Plaskow has written: The idea that divinity can be terrible and awesome, an unbreachable mystery and consuming fire, is far from modern notions which equate God's holiness with sanctity and moral purity or which find God's presence only in sustenance and care. Yet this terrifying aspect of God is found repeatedly in the Tanakh.14* Jewish tradition, as Plaskow, too, has noted, comments on the irrationality of the Nadav and Avihu episode by coupling it in the weekly Torah reading cycle with the haftara relating the sorry story of Uzzah in 2 Sam. 6:1-8. In the course of David's bringing the Ark of YHWH to Jerusalem with his men, the wagon bearing the ark was about to topple. Trying to break the ark's fall, Uzzah touched it, provoking YHWH to "explode" (parats) against him.145 The intertextual connection of this tale to ours is more than thematic. The ark had just been removed from the house of Uzzah's father Avinadav, a name that is nothing but a reverse conflation of Nadav and Avihu.146 The terrible destructive power that consumed Nadav and Avihu lurks within the story of Uzzah in a barely concealed permutation. Shades of Nadav and Avihu indeed! The method, or mode, of deconstruction?of driving wedges into the spaces of the text and leaving them there?can be used as a means of remystifying the text, insisting on the unknown as we grope for the known. It is not that we can never produce a reading. We can never produce a certain, stable, or impregnable meaning. As Derrida says near the end of "Speech and Phenomena," "This does not mean that we know nothing but that we are beyond absolute knowledge."147 The beginning of wisdom is the ac-know-ledgement of our limitations in knowing. The God-belief, or ideal, entails our humanness; humanness implies human limitation. A way of thinking and doing such as deconstruction, which is dedicated to exposing the limits/borders of human understanding as a consequence of the instability of linguistic sense, can paradoxically facilitate a God-belief (though not the God of absolute order). If, as Ebner writes, the "foundation task" of religious education "is to foster awareness of Mystery,"148 deconstruction could be the prime hermeneutic of the unknown: it deepens our mystification as we read. It can inspire awe.</page><page sequence="21">Deconstruction and Biblical Narrative 63 There has always been an intimate, perhaps necessary, correlation between the obscurity of texts and their sacredness. Sacred texts, the ones in which readers "find" God, can only function when their spaces are frequent and wide. The heightening of the meaningfulness of a text as a whole is . . . often connected with a lowering of its meaningfulness at the level of ordinary linguistic communication. Hence, the typical process whereby incomprehensible texts become sacred: utterances that circulate in a given community but which are incomprehensible to it are given text signifi cance. . . .149 Inasmuch as a high degree of text meaning is perceived as a guarantee of truthfulness, and text meaning grows inasmuch as ordinary linguistic meaning is obscured, in many instances the tendency can be observed to make texts from which a high degree of truthfulness is expected incomprehensible for the addressee. In order to be taken as a text the message must be incomprehensible or barely comprehensible and must need further translation or interpretation.150 In this regard the opaque story of Nadav and Avihu serves as a quintessential sacred tale, a text most obviously open to endless interpretation, as its numerous readings attest, or?to no interpreta tion. In its radical reduction of the text, deconstruction ironically reveals the sources of its sacredness. The story of Nadav and Avihu, as narrative, intrudes into the exposition of cultic law that precedes and follows it. It may strike the reader as disrupting the text as violently as the flash of fire annihilated the young priests. As the narrative genre of the episode disturbs the legal landscape by its otherness, so does its representation of a possibly opaque and nonverbal?irrational?God upset the orderliness of the cultic system. Notwithstanding the cultic regulations, all of which posit that reward and punishment follow directly from obedience to or violation of divine prescriptions, God has not in fact explained every thing. The system contains terrible dark secrets; YHWH may strike without warning. The system of the cult rationalizes, sets things in order. It reassures that there is a way to purify the polluted and expurgate sin; like the rainbow after the Flood it guarantees human life despite its imperfection. It entails, however, a theological danger: it renders God normative and predictable. It subordinates the deity to the system the deity is supposed to transcend. "The value and force of a text may depend to a considerable extent on the way it deconstructs the philosophy that subtends it."151 Lest God become altogether manipulable by the cult, the episode of Nadav and Avihu, I would suggest, subverts the orderly ritual's implication of orderliness by asserting YHWH's unpredictability and autonomy, YHWH's sheer transcendence. Consider Damrosch's more traditional perspective, first published in Alter and Kermode's Literary Guide:</page><page sequence="22">64 EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN "Clearly the episode serves, in part, a monitory purpose, to warn against the invention of new practices or the importation of practices external to the cultic order."152 This reading assumes the inviolability of order?even by God. YHWH's fire, in this view, restores order. But our deconstruction of the passage has made the search for a rational cause impossible in practice and possibly misguided in theory. In our reading, YHWH breaks up the orderliness to show he is above/beyond the cultic order. A God worthy of the name cannot be trammeled by rules, any more than an infinite God can be contained by names, by language. Wenham observes that the first verse of our passage, Lev. 10:1, employs the Priestly vocabulary of the surrounding context: laqah ("to take"), natan ("to put"), sim ("to place"), hiqriv ("to bring near," i.e., to offer), q-t-r ("incense").153 The words are at home in Leviticus; the story seems of a piece. By weaving the local vocabulary into a tale of the mysterium tremendum, the narrative of Nadav and Avihu can be under stood to deconstruct the finely wrought cultic fabric. Order is sub verted to expose disorder. The young priests are functioning as priests?the words seem right. It is not enough, however, to act the priest. The priest can only control what the priest does; he cannot control God. Behind the orderly veneer of priestly ritual, behind the parokhet that screens off YHWH's quasi-condensed presence from the human observer, is the inscrutable Other. YHWH can hardly be better comprehended than the motives of Nadav and Avihu and the question of whether they had done anything amiss. As I have claimed in my deconstructive analysis, the very strange ness of the episode undercuts its susceptibility to rational explanation. There is no reason to assume that there is any reason for Nadav and Avihu to die, though, as we have seen, readers have cast about for reasons. One can always contrive some reason from fragments of text. But a deconstruction will both turn up other, ill-fitting fragments and show that the fragments themselves are plays of differance, no-longer present constructions ready already for de-construction.

I offer a brief word of explanation for the mode of translation I use. It is meant to highlight certain linguistic or rhetorical patterns in the Hebrew. Often certain Hebrew usages are more nuanced than any idiomatic English counterpart. For example, "between . . . and between" renders Hebrew ben . . . uven, which contrasts with ben . . . leven; the former indicates a parity relation while the latter places the inferior term after the preposition /; see Arnold B. Ehrlich, Mikra Ki-Pheschuto, vol. 1 (Berlin, 1899), ad Gen. 1:6; cf. vol. 3 (1901) ad 2 Chron. 14:10.

To convey an idea of what such a (heavily christological) discourse sounds like, I cite a brief passage from pages 106-7: "The death of the father opens the reign of the word that is embodied in scripture. Since this word enacts absolute passage, it is forever liminal and eternally playful. The play of the word is writing, and the drama of writing is word. In writing, fixed boundaries break down. Scripture, therefore, is always marginal. The/A word is nothing in itself; it is a play within a play. . . ." 88. Cf. Charles E.

Samuel ben Meir (12th c), comparing the ignition of the altar in Lev. 9:24 with that in 1 Kgs. 18:38, concluded that the fire came down from the sky, as in the latter verse. David Zvi Hoffmann, in his Leviticus commentary (trans, from German to Hebrew by Z. H. Shefer and A. Lieberman; Jerusalem, 1966), p. 203, cites the more widely held, as well as the classical rabbinic position that the fire emerged from the holy of holies. The phrase lifne YHWH, "before YHWH," occurs several times in the preceding chapters of Leviticus as the site where offerings to YHWH were made (e.g., Lev. 8:26-28; 9:2, 4). In Lev. 9:5 the entire</page><page sequence="27">Deconstruction and Biblical Narrative 69 assembly (kol ha'eda) approaches YHWH and stands lifne YHWH, awaiting the materializa tion of the divine aura {kavod; v. 6). It would seem that the people are standing outside of and facing the tent of meeting, housing the holy of holies. This interpretation may be corroborated by 9:21. There Aaron displays animal parts that are offered lifne YHWH; then (v. 23) Moses and Aaron enter the tent of meeting. The locution lifne YHWH would seem to indicate a locus in front of and facing the divine abode. It is not, therefore, clear that the fire igniting the altar in 9:24 and consuming the young priests in 10:2 came from within the tent. It may have materialized outside the tent or, indeed, fallen from the sky. 103. Certain critics remove the phrase from the text altogether as a later scribal gloss; cf., e.g., Roland Gradwohl, "Das 'Fremde Feuer' von Nadab und Abihu," Zeitschrift f?r alttestamentliche Wissenschaft 75 (1963): 288-96; here, 289, . 5. 104.

One midrash finds the cause of Nadav and Avihu's punishment in the past, at the Sinai revelation; see Stephen A. Geller, "The Common and the Uncommon," Conservative Judaism 19/3 (1965): 57-62. David Damrosch, in The Narrative Covenant:</page><page sequence="28">70 EDWARD L. GREENSTEIN Transformations of Genre in the Growth of Biblical Literature (San Francisco, 1987), pp. 266 ff., in an intricate and intriguing analysis, finds Aaron, not his sons, to be the focus of attention. Assuming the death of Nadav and Avihu is a punishment, Damrosch explains it as a displacement of the punishment that Aaron himself deserved for his role in making the golden calf. The fact that Nadav and Avihu revive in only slightly altered form as the sons of King Jeroboam I, who himself made two golden calves, lends force to Damrosch's reading. See further below. 134. Cf. Shinan, p. 208. 135. Rabbenu Asher (14th c.) elaborates that these prohibitions were transmitted to the priests prior to beginning their service. The fact that the Torah presents this law after the death of Nadav and Avihu has no chronological bearing. En muqdam ume'uhar battora?the Torah does not adhere to a chronological sequence; quoted in Adin Steinsaltz, Perush hammiqra' besifrut hashe'elot uteshuvot [Interpretation of Scripture in the Responsa Literature] (Jerusalem, 1978), pp. 36-37. 136.

Journal of Biblical Literature 96 (1977): 27-44. Goldin correctly notes (p. 35) that Aaron the high priest was not a younger brother but a first-born. Aaron, however, is in his own generation made subservient to his younger brother, Moses. Eleazar and Ithamar succeed to the position of their older brothers, Nadav and Avihu. The crucial relationship of older and younger is established between brothers. Consequently, it is of no consequence that Aaron's oldest surviving son, Eleazar, should serve as high priest under his unrelated contemporary, Joshua. 140. Cf. Jacob Licht, A Commentary on the Book of Numbers [1-X] (Jerusalem, 1985), pp. 33-34 [in Hebrew]; Damrosch, p. 278. 141. Cf., e.g., Fokkelman (see n. 37), pp. 32-39. 142. Wenham, p. 155, posits a normative situation: "The whole narrative from 8:1 has led us to expect God's ministers to obey the law promptly and exactly." It is this expectation or presupposition that allows him to conclude that Aaron's two sons were killed for having brought "something that had not been commanded." Similarly Leibowitz, Studies in Vayikra, p. 68, assumes that "normative religious discipline" precludes "religious ecstasy. For this reason they were punished." 143.
