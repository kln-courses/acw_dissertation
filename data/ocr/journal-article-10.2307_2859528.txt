<plain_text><page sequence="1">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY emphasis on Guazzo to the disparagement of Castiglione may constitute an underrating of courtesy as a symbol of social harmony (as the circu- lar imagery in the Courtier implies, I think), still he makes a valuable contribution to our knowledge of this aspect of the poem. And his com- mentary (pp. 251ff.) on the 'froward/towards' crux in the vision on Acidale seems to me by far the most illuminating-and least trivial-of all that has been written on this passage. But Tonkin is at his most ad- venturous and stimulating in writing of the central mythological allu- sions in Book vi: those to Proserpina (pp. 307-315), or Orpheus (pp. 213-219), or the related choices of Hercules and Paris (pp. 264-280). In passages such as these, his earlier proposal to 'step back' from the poem in order to see it whole is fulfilled in ways which suggest that he may have been half-consciously borrowing Frye's familiar posture-to which Tonkin in fact alludes rather skeptically elsewhere (p. 307 n.). But for all his unwillingness to stand revealed as an unqualified disciple of Frye, Tonkin's ultimate contribution to Spenser studies in this vol- ume may be his ability to lead with tact and learning toward a more profound awareness of the ways in which Spenser used the complex mythological traditions available to him. UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS, AMHERST Donald Cheney Thomas McFarland. Shakespeare's Pastoral Comedy. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1972. 218 pp. $8.95. Shakespeare's Pastoral Comedy consists of six chapters and an appendix. The first chapter expounds the doctrine that comedy and its pastoral ex- tension rest upon a reciprocal social and religious concern, that 'the ideas of hope, joy, and sacred community constitute the perennial vital- ity of Shakespeare's pastoral comedy' (p. 48). His pastoral comedy, we are told, is as serious as tragedy. In the author's experience, Shake- speare's comedies elicit less laughter than do Jonson's. It is illustrative of the book's emphasis that the index lists ten references to Plato, six to St. Paul, eight to Freud, and only two or three to Plautus and Terence. The alliance of comedy and pastoral realizes what neither mode could adequately achieve by itself: the representation of paradise. An alliance is necessary, for such a representation must be conceived simultaneously as happy society and blessed place. All comical and pastoral meanings converge upon this truth. The coming together of comic laughter and pastoral in the reclamation of childhood, and the union of all three in the happiness of play, pass in the words of Plotinus into a depreciation of the impor- tance of death, and in the words of Plato into a sacramental activity. (p. 37) 524</page><page sequence="2">The five remaining chapters provide readings of Love's Labour's Lost, with emphasis on its Playfulness; A Midsummer Night's Dream, with its Happiness; As You Like It, with its Complications; The Winter's Tale, with its Disintegration and Reunion; and The Tempest, with its Vision of Paradise. Noting that in LLL there is much ado about language, the author contends that 'Language, like sex and money, is a social phe- nomenon, and like them, both holds society together and symbolizes society's understanding of itself' (p. 73). A new awareness of commu- nity means that the old law is fulfilled and there is a kind of religious joy: 'It is religion thus to be forsworn; / For charity itself fulfills the law, / And who can sever love from charity?' (Iv.iii.359-361). In MND the Pyramus and Thisbe play is not seen to be hilarious satire: 'The play-within-a-play thus becomes, in its mirthful good fellowship, a testament to a society in bliss' (p. 90o). McFarland can suck pastoral out of a court comedy as a weasel sucks eggs. But when he gets to a real pastoral comedy, As You Like It, what does he find? Why, that 'Indeed, this comedy, even more than Twelfth Night, rejects romantic love as social sickness. In the Forest of Arden romantic love replaces, and thereby almost seems to participate in the antisocial nature of, the darker motif of Cain against Abel that has char- acterized the action at court' (p. 112). And The Winter's Tale, surely in Act iv Shakespeare's most consummate pastoral, what does it do? 'This play, in fact, attacks pastoral bliss at its very heart, for childhood is the persistent object of the action's dramatic rage' (p. 123). The Leontes jealousy plot would seem to be central and profound in meaning: 'The most persistent theme in all Shakespeare, in fact, is that of human faith- lessness. It is the very substance of the history plays, the most tormented preoccupation of the tragedies, the chief ingredient of the bitterness in the middle and late comedies, all haunted by the theme of sonnet 92: "Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not" ' (p. 127). The Tempest is in McFarland's view the triumph of what he calls pastoral comedy: 'The childish impotence of evil emphasizes the almost divine power of Prospero's good. And it is accordingly in this play that Shakespeare seems to come closest to open identification of the comic ideal and the hope of religion, of pastoral realm and Christian heaven' (p. 15o). Prospero is an anthropomorphic figure of the divine, and 'In- deed, on the rarefied comic level to which The Tempest attains, religion no longer stands above comedy, but is actually its other face' (p. 174). In the Appendix, entitled 'A Babble of Green Fields: Falstaff as Pas- 525 REVIEWS</page><page sequence="3">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY toral Outcast,' the author undertakes to show that the fat knight was the good guy and Prince Hal some kind of Machiavellian villain. He main- tains 'that Hal, the ideal prince of Elizabethan popular imagination ... was, in fact, like a Kennedy of our own day, tainted by the opportunism and unscrupulous Caesarism that go hand in hand with political power' (pp. 177-178). Falstaff is an outcast from the pastoral world, but he looks backward to it with longing as he babbles of green fields. When Dr. Johnson was asked what he thought of Maurice Morgann's defense of Falstaff's courage, he said, 'Why, Sir, we shall have the man come forth again; and as he has proved Falstaff to be no coward, he may prove Iago to be a very good character.' In McFarland's wild western, Maurice Morgann rides again, as Dr. Johnson predicted he would. HUNTINGTON LIBRARY Hallett Smith Mark Rose. Shakespearean Design. Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1972. 204 pp. $7.95. Mr. Rose completed his book before the publication of Emrys Jones's Shakespeare's Scenic Art, with which it has something in common since both critics stress the fact that Shakespeare, despite the act divisions of the First Folio, took the scene as his unit. The methods and conclusions of the two critics are, however, very different. Mr. Rose declares that The much debated question of act division in Shakespeare has been a scholarly red herring, diverting attention from the real issues and seriously impeding our under- standing of the plays' organization. ... As recent scholarship has demonstrated, act division plays no part at all in Shakespearean structure. T. W. Baldwin is dismissed, somewhat too easily, in a footnote. The main concern of the book is with the spatial structure of individ- ual scenes and of groups of scenes. Taking analogies from painting, and with some help from the work of Beckerman, Kemodle, and Wick- ham, Mr. Rose stresses the importance of proportion in Renaissance aesthetics; and he examines a large number of scenes in order to demon- strate how carefully they are planned. The 'scenes' are not always those indicated in editions of Shakespeare. Mr. Rose argues, no doubt cor- rectly, that scenes 2, 3, and 4 of the second act of King Lear are really one; that the action takes place from dawn to dusk; and that 'the unity of the scene is thematic rather than narrative,' Kent, Edgar, and Lear are each shut out in the cold. He thinks of the scene as a triptych 'in which 526</page></plain_text>
