<plain_text><page sequence="1">To rethink the animal is to rethink the human. This tenet, supported by an interdisciplinary consideration of ani- mal/human relations, informs an examination of how the representation of animals in Elizabeth Bishop's writings contributes to a "taxonomy of selfhood" and a "neotenous" imagination sympathetic to difference. "You are not Beppo": Elizabeth Bishop's Animals and Negotiation of Identity PRISCILLA PATON To tions is rethink that asserted animals the animal by are philosophers, like is to and rethink unlike art the critics, us human. (Midgley sociologists, Another 1; Berger biologists, tenet 2; Franklin of myriad and ethologists 9): implica- like us tions asserted by philosophers, art critics, sociologists, biologists, and ethologists is that animals are like and unlike us (Midgley 1; Berger 2; Franklin 9): like us enough to be useful in experimentation for human benefit, unlike us enough to deflect concern on their behalf; like us in sentience and will-to-be; unlike us, many assume, in lack of intellect and moral agency. Cultural and literary practices often reinstate such hierarchies of animals' coexistence with the human, representing them as totemie scapegoats; amoral creatures of sensation and sexuality; a lower order to be dominated, sacrificed, destroyed, consumed, petted, and ignored. In these paradigms, the animal defines the human by antithesis, as "other," the beast to be conquered by enlightened civilization. Rethinking the potential of the animal thus means rethink- ing mindedness and physicality, domination and ethics, otherness and identity; it involves, as philosopher Mary Midgley explains, "concepts of childhood and maturity, and the human race's general view of itself in relation to the physical universe" (7). Questions of likeness and unlikeness, paradigms of identity, and relations to others Mosaic 39/4 0027- 1276-06/1 970 18$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">198 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) and the physical world pervade the writings of Elizabeth Bishop, frequently through the guise of imagined creatures and common animals: "The Man-Moth," "The Fish," "The Armadillo," "Sandpiper," "Pink Dog," and "The Moose."1 Viewed through recent philosophical, environmental, and ethological considerations of the human/animal connection, Bishop's works reveal that hierarchical concepts of animal-as-less are deeply embedded. Anthropocentric assumptions underlie her apparently sympathetic depictions, particularly when identification with an animal conveys a destabilized abject self, as outlined in the theories of Julia Kristeva. On the other hand, the writ- ings express spontaneous attraction to animals. Then the reassuring presence of birds, dogs, chickens, and cows contributes to a "taxonomy of selfhood," as described by ecologist Paul Shepard. These animal passages suggest the presence of a literary form of "neoteny." In biology, neoteny means the retention of juvenile traits into maturity, including mental plasticity and curiosity; in a broad sense, neotenous beings retain openness to the unfamiliar - a characteristic conveyed by Bishop's childlike response to distinctive creatures. It is animals' seemingly dual nature - the lowly beast and the marvellous playmate - that informs a construction of self that reconciles the abject and appealing, the physical and psychic, and the childish and mature. The "animal," in Bishop's writing and in contemporary thought, inspires perceptions of the "other" that allow for sympathetic connection in the face of difference. Identity" objective is description, difficult to who fathom shied with away a writer from literary initially cliques known and for grandstanding, discretion and objective description, who shied away from literary cliques and grandstanding, whose later writings and biographies disclose a figure lonely, suffering, and sickly. Bishop scholars have noted her troubled sense of self, which emerges in the poetry through resistance to a dominant "I," ambivalence to female presences, and "closeting" of sexual desires (Zona 69; Goldensohn 46; Diehl 101; Patón 206). While her reticence may be refreshingly free of self-indulgent ego, it can also veil insecurity and distress (Merrin 2). Marilyn Lombardi connects the poet's struggles with asthma, alcoholism, and lesbianism to a private habit of "self-recrimination": "her detailed confessions of weakness [in unpublished writings] reveal a morbid streak to her imagination that is judiciously suppressed in her public persona" (6). This morbidity surfaces in her liter- ary treatment of animals: they act as a measure of the writer's displacement from con- ventional standards of human fulfillment, and their lowliness further testifies to the poet's tendency for self-loathing. Animals are often "a cast of surrogates and vehicles for riding out a problem" (Shepard 75), but that surrogacy takes its toll. Bishop's portrayals diminish animals when she dwells on them as lesser in identifying with vulnerable neurotic creatures.</page><page sequence="3">Priscilla Patón 199 This is not to accuse Bishop of "speciesism," to use Peter Singers opprobrium (54), but to emphasize that animal-as-lesser is a "basic metaphor," in Mark Turners terms, "a pattern of thought that underlies our cognition and knowledge generally" (10-11). The lowly beast is taken for granted, and the poet's self-disgust erupts through that trope. The sympathy she creates for beings such as the "battered," "homely" fish that "hadn't fought at all" is sympathy she may wish to experience for herself ( Poems 42). The abasement of self is also conveyed by proximity to the beast, evident in "The Prodigal." In this poem, inspired by the Biblical parable and the poet's alcoholism, the "prodigal" in his exile as a keeper of swine is repulsed by his literal and symbolic close- ness to "self-righteous" pigs who live cheerfully in a dung-lined sty and eat their own young (71). However, Bishop's projections on the animal can also be assurances that companionship, adaptability, self-possession, and play exist. Poet-animal as lowly being and poet-animal as emblem of self-possession and belonging are made evident in two prose pieces that frame Bishop's childhood, "The Country Mouse" and "In the Village." Together they tell of Bishop's childhood as a vir- tual orphan: her father died when she was an infant and her mother was institution- alized for mental illness when Bishop was five years old. The child was shuffled back and forth between her mother's farm family in Great Village, Nova Scotia, and her father's reserved, well-to-do family in Worcester, Massachusetts. The title of "The Country Mouse," echoing the familiar fable, suggests in a lightly self-deprecating tone that Bishop views her child-self as a drab, timid "creature." The story follows Bishop's unwanted transplantation from Nova Scotia to Worcester: "I had been brought back unconsulted and against my wishes to the house my father had been born in, to be saved from a life of poverty and provincialism, bare feet, suet puddings, unsanitary school slates, perhaps even from the inverted r's of my mother's family" ( Prose 17). Her powerlessness and fear that she is socially inferior explain why she follows the common pattern of a shy child more at ease with pets than people, but even this affin- ity is upset in the move. The Worcester animals embody the household's "ominous" character: "awful rats in the attic" and "ugly" cats that the child says "ran away from me - not like my black Nanny in Nova Scotia" (19). The first bonding in the story, if the child did indeed bond with any there, was with the Boston bull terrier, Beppo. The narrative's anthropomorphism enhances the child-like perspective and conveys that much human communication not only hap- pens nonverbally, but also crosses the barriers of species and age. As Bishop recalls, Beppo took the initiative to greet her, sensing that this new arrival was, like him, low in the pack order and less judgmental than the alpha adults: "At first I was afraid of him, but he immediately adopted me, perhaps as being on the same terms in the</page><page sequence="4">200 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) house as himself, and we became very attached. He was a clever dog; he wore a wide collar with brass studs, which was taken off every night before he went to bed. Every morning at eight o'clock he would come to my door with the collar in his mouth, and bang it against the door, meaning for us to get up and dressed and start the day together" ( Prose 21). This echoes children's stories in which child and animal, mar- ginalized by rational, dominant adulthood and by peculiarities of circumstance, resemble star-crossed soulmates who substitute sex with literal petting. In this genre (the National Velvet, Lassie, or Flipper romance), the animal is disliked because it retains some "wild" trait, resembling the child's antisocial bent, or because, as misfit, it lacks resource value: child and animal cross the lines of acceptable behaviour. Here Beppo's habits seem humanly neurotic as he interiorizes and physically manifests the household's disdain of him: "he vomited frequently" and hid in the closet "punishing himself." He had, Bishop explains, a "peculiar Bostonian sense of guilt" (21). Beppo does not belong to the romantic or demonic literary species that aggran- dize individual possibilities: he is no innocent little lamb or tiger burning bright. The terrier is a slightly absurd domesticated creature, mirroring the girl/writer who can- not convincingly cast herself as a tragic figure, enlarged by passion and grief. The self in Bishop's work is neither a romantic soul unveiled nor a self-governed self-fashion- ing: it is subject to, but not completely dominated by, contingencies of the cultural, physiological, and natural environments. Shy, sickly, and at odds with the household temperament, the virtual orphan of "A Country Mouse" cannot construct by herself an identity that reconciles her feelings, her social position, and her voice. She lies to another child, proclaiming "in a sentimental voice" that her mother is dead, rather than admitting that she is in a "sanatorium, in another prolonged 'nervous break- down'" (31-32). As Beppo punishes himself in the closet, the young Bishop, in "self- distaste," "jump[s] up, to get away from my monstrous self" (32). Identity and status within a group, along with thinking through likeness and unlikeness with animals, involve what Paul Shepard terms "microdifferentiations" and "macrodifferentiations" (100), which create a shifting rather than fixed "taxonomy of selfhood" (99): "Each kind of animal [in children's play] gives concrete representation to an ephemeral and intangible element of the human self such as assertion, intimi- dation, affection [. . .]. Only when these feelings are discovered outside the self and then performed can such intense but elusive 'things' be made one's own" (83). In other words, people (or animals) gauge themselves in relation to changing group dynamics and to perceptions of outsiders; they externalize the internal and internal- ize the external; they try out or have imposed upon them different positions, labels, or symbolic totems. Bishop's writings parallel Shepard's paradigm of child's play as</page><page sequence="5">Priscilla Patón 201 crucial to the formation of identity and relationships and to the comprehension of individual feelings and social categories: the animal imagery of stories and poems becomes "concrete representation" for the "ephemeral and intangible element of the human self." Rather than "confessing" her illnesses and concerns in the manner of her contemporary, Robert Lowell, Bishop "chooses instead to cloak and recloak her own flesh, to cross-dress, displace, or otherwise project her most intense feelings onto a variety of poetic protagonists in order to escape stifling categorization and conven- tional definitions of identity" (Lombardi 16-17). Bishop may try to escape "conventional definitions" through animal "protago- nists," but stereotypes confine the poet, and warp the understanding of real and liter- ary animals. Beppo suffers as the "scapegoat" or omega animal, and like several of Bishop's creatures, he evokes submissiveness and pathos: "He jumped nervously at imaginary dangers [. . .]. His hyperthyroid eyes glistened, and begged for sympathy and understanding" ( Prose 21). Beppo resembles the Giant Toad of Bishop's "Rainy Season; Sub-Tropics," who begs, "Pity me. My eyes bulge and hurt" ( Poems 139). In that parable, a toad, "strayed crab," and "giant snail" betray vulnerability as they speak of their bodies, which do not serve them well: "I am too big" laments the toad, who is abused by boys; "This is not my home," the oblique crab worries; "Our proportions horrify our neighbors," "Pity me," muses the snail (139-41). Personified animals often function like the rustics or clowns of traditional literature: marginal, low-status beings who act out exaggerated hopes and fears. These creatures that do not fit them- selves may reflect Bishop's discomfort with her allergy-prone physique and what Anne Colwell describes as the poet's ambivalence about the split "between the visible body and the invisible life force within it" (2). This mirroring of a human self is important, and so is the perception of difference as threatening: this unlikely trio attests to Bishop's "conscious, though always limited, determination to reidentify with what one initially finds repulsive or merely other" (Zona 7). To return to "The Country Mouse," neither Bishop nor Beppo find their misfit traits transformed into talents that save them, that is to say, they do not become Lassie and Timmy rescuing each other to win esteem in a community that now comprehends them. Eczema and asthma plague the child so that "at nights Beppo and I scratched together, I in my bed and he outside my door. Roll and scratch, scratch and roll" (29). Despite this tragi-comic shared misery, Beppo, as one cause of the allergic reaction, aggravates Bishop's emotional and physical displacement. The paradox that Beppo is the child's ally and enemy introduces a frustration that runs through much of Bishop's life and writing: a quirky doom that she is at odds with whatever life should be, as "The Man-Moth" always seems "inverted" and finds himself "facing the wrong way" ( Poems 14).</page><page sequence="6">202 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) Yet response to other animals demonstrates an alternative to that doom with the child's potential for delight. Unhappy in her body, unhappy in the house, Bishop experiences one "happy" surprise in the Worcester story when her grandfather brings her Golden Bantams (30). Nearly crying "for pleasure," the girl displays "immediate, intense physical reactions," which, according to a journal she kept in college, should intimate "something, I suppose, spiritual " (Costello 3). Her reaction suggests neoteny in its childlike attraction to different responsive "obliging" creatures: When one hen pecked at some cornmeal on the enamel table, and made miniature but hen- like sounds, I could have cried for pleasure. Where to put them for the night? The problem was solved by using one of the "set tubs" in the laundry off the kitchen. But hens and roost- ers have to perch, and Grandma found a bleached stick [...]. It was stuck into one stone tub and the three tiny fowl immediately and obligingly hopped on and clung to it [. . .]. They were mine [...]. I could scarcely bear to leave my little poultry. (30) Because the toy-like birds remind her of Great Village farm life, because she is made special by care of others, the child is delighted with them. The Bantams also offer a contrast: unlike the wheezing girl and vomiting Beppo, they are free of the burden of self-consciousness and adapt immediately to a new home comprised of a stick and a tub. Although animals may represent the "bestial" in all its negative connotations, they can also signify a unified being. In that sense, animals seem Unfällen creatures at one with an unmediated existence, a romantic view that has cogency as Paul Shepard expresses it: "We seem frantic to contact some intelligence more assured than our- selves, to be blessed in their witness of our mutual presence, to be given their surety that life is real and purposeful, even if the purposes lie beyond our grasp" (141). A chicken may not exactly be an "intelligence more assured than ourselves," nor does Bishop idealize animals by depicting them as saviours enlightening anxious humanity (as do some contemporary writers such as Rick Bass in Colter and Pam Houston in Sight Hound). Still, the Bantams' presence briefly comforts the child and gives her purpose. Animals influence children's development and leave an imprint, a matter only recently receiving extended study: they tap what psychologist Gail Melson calls a child's "intuitive affinity for other forms of life" (6) and provide "reassurance, support, and the contact comfort' of touch" (5). Children learn about their world and themselves not only through imitating and interacting with adults, but also through imitating and interacting with animals (Shepard 87). However, kinship needs must be largely satisfied within a species, a realization dramatized in Bishop's "Crusoe in England" when the speaker finds that the island's turtles, gulls, and goats annoy rather</page><page sequence="7">Priscilla Patón 203 than relieve lonely solipsism ( Poems 162-66). For all the attention she gives to animals in her poetry, prose, and letters, Bishop does not portray them as soulmates or fetishize them as love objects. In "The Country Mouse," animals alone do not provide adequate basis for the child's physical or social flourishing. The departure of the Swedish cook, Agnes, who likely resembled Bishop s nurturing Nova Scotia grand- mother, undoes the child, whose health worsens. In Bishop's writings, desire for human kinship is denied by such losses and by the difficulty of one imperfect needy self adapting to another imperfect needy self, who seems at once strange and familiar. The story concludes with the memory that also inspired the poem "In the Waiting Room," that of gazing at the National Geographic in a dentist's office. In this memory, self and other are confused, and the child strug- gles with micro and macro differentiations of selfhood. Her attempt at "taxonomy" unsettles more than reassures as it leaves large questions of existence and identity unanswered: A feeling of absolute and utter desolation came over me. I felt . . . myself. In a few days it would be my seventh birthday. I felt I, I, I, and looked at the three strangers in panic. I was one of them too, inside my scabby body and wheezing lungs. "You're in for it now," some- thing said. How had I got tricked into such a false position? I would be like that woman opposite who smiled at me so falsely every once in a while. The awful sensation passed, then it came back again. "You are you," something said. "How strange you are, inside looking out. You are not Beppo, or the chestnut tree, or Emma, you are you and you are going to be you forever." It was like coasting downhill, this thought, only much worse, and it quickly smashed into a tree. Why was I a human being? (32-33) This uncontrolled sliding to a smash, like "the sensation of falling off / the round, turning world" in the poem, suggests "abjection" as defined by Julia Kristeva in Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection : "what disturbs identity, system, order. What does not respect borders, positions, rules" (4). Abjection "is elaborated through a failure to rec- ognize its kin; nothing is familiar" (5). That failure is problematized in the Bishop passage because when kinship is recognized, it is kinship with what is abhorred, "a false position." Kristeva elaborates on a disturbance to identity with the illustration of a male child who has "swallowed up instead of maternal love [. . .] an emptiness," and is "pet- rified" by the "untouchable, impossible, absent body of the mother." In his state of fear, "discourse will seem tenable only if it ceaselessly confront [sic] that otherness, a burden both repellent and repelled, a deep well of memory that is unapproachable and intimate: the abject" (6). Bishop's literary representation of a traumatized self</page><page sequence="8">204 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) anticipates Kristeva's psychoanalytic theories in the struggle with likeness and unlike- ness to others: a woman with a false smile; a friend or tree or Beppo; and, implied, "the untouchable, impossible, absent body of the mother." A strict adherence to Kristeva's theories commands that to move away from the abject, the poet must stop identifying with "the threatening world of animals or ani- malism [. . .] representatives of sex and murder" or at the least suppress bodily and primitive urges overwhelming a higher self (12-13). The early identification with Beppo indicates Bishop's insecurity and foreshadows a life of internalizing social judgments. The animal identification of "The Country Mouse" becomes more dis- ruptive in the corresponding section of "In the Waiting Room." The poem's National Geographic images of stereotyped "primitives" and cannibalism, the extreme failure to recognize kin with "A dead man slung on a pole / - 'Long Pig,'" represent the human as frighteningly close to the animal in Kristeva's sense. Viewing the animal as "abject," according to W.J.T. Mitchell, or as "merely below or beside" the normative "'human'" is a "prejudice that is so deep and 'natural' that we can scarcely imagine human life without it" (xiv). However, animals in other pieces by Bishop rarely carry the sym- bolic weight of lawlessness or dread taboo. Nonetheless, whether fantastic or realistic, the poet's creatures, such as the "inverted" "Man-Moth," the "melancholy" horse of "Cirque D'Hiver," the amoral pigs of "The Prodigal," and the scabrous "Pink Dog," seem odd, unlikely, vulnerable. At this point, one might protest that Bishop's portrayal of animals is too sympa- thetic for this hierarchical judgment: she does more than cast animals as inferiors or project on them her worst moments of self-disdain and pity. There's something soothing, even friendly. In fact, Bishop's references to animals imply a "mixed com- munity" that includes them and can foster associations "amounting to symbiosis" (Midgley 112). More than mirrors for internal human states, they appear as figures that animate landscapes, as creatures at home in their surroundings, and as compan- ions contributing to well being. Several animals in Bishop's prose are called by name - Beppo, Nanny, Nelly, Jock - which enhances a familiar, childlike tone. But what's in a name is complex. Having a name seems crucial to identity - a key part of the taxonomy. Species, genus, titles, and family names also situate individuals in hegemonic structures, social con- tracts, and intimate groups. Naming suggests power over what is named: a god names the created; the conqueror renames the conquered; parents christen a child; children name pets. The consequences of naming recall the epiphany of "In the Waiting Room" when the demarcation between self and other is dissolved by the aunt's cry of pain: "Without thinking at all / 1 was my foolish aunt." To dispel this vertigo, the child names</page><page sequence="9">Priscilla Patón 205 herself and acknowledges, if reluctantly, kinship with the other: "you are an I, / you are an Elizabeth , / you are one of them " (Poems 160). With names comes responsiveness and relationship. Philosopher and animal trainer Vicki Hearne asserts the saving sig- nificance of naming a companion animal (and by implication naming a human being): she says of a once intractable horse, "without a name and someone to call her by name, she couldn't enter the moral life" (168). Given a name, an animal (or an "Elizabeth") enters a community; she can now communicate (though this challenge may involve training, socialization, or the practice of art), can do as bid by others, or refuse that bid- ding. Recognizing a name can signify agency, self-affirming delight, or a moral burden; the bad Beppo is sent to the closet, and a confused child is daunted by selfhood. In another story, animals receive their names, but those of the central individu- als are suppressed. "In the Village" rehearses the emotional trauma of the mother's breakdown and subsequent disappearance from Bishop s life; neither mother ("she") nor child is referred to by name. This has the paradoxical effect of balancing intimacy - they know who they are and their significance is beyond words - with distance - their situation cannot be addressed with direct recognition. The tension surrounding the mother is offset by several contrasts and the pres- ence of animals. Two sounds are paired in the story: the mother's scream and the "beautiful" clang of the blacksmith's hammer. Another pairing is the secretive space of anxious women attempting to repress sorrow and madness, and the sociable space of the blacksmith's shop. As the mother, still in mourning after five years, is being fitted with a dress by a worried seamstress, the horse is being fitted for shoes by a laughing Nate. The mother's scream terrifies because it is an involuntary reaction to so little - being measured for a dress, and so much - the inability to cope with death, with fam- ily, and with a functional presentation of self. The opposite of self-restraint, it dissolves the lines between internal and external situations, between self and outsider, between private and public. The scream too, as the mother's unwilled self-expression and as the child's unwilling response, can be parsed through Kristeva's theories of abjection: "If it be true that the abject simultaneously beseeches and pulverizes the subject, one can understand that it is experienced at the peak of its strength when that subject, weary of fruitless attempts to identify with something on the outside, finds the impossible within; when it finds that the impossible constitutes its very being, that it is none other than abject" (5). Because the scream signifies the unbearable that has taken over the mother's "very being ' and that threatens to overcome the child as well, she escapes by "vanishing" (as the daughter) and reappearing (as a neighbourhood child) at the blacksmith's. Perhaps this world of men (a desire for the ever absent father?) and its necessary, but not urgent, chores offers a respite to the house of nervous women.</page><page sequence="10">206 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) In its external elements of women engaged in dress-making, the scene of the moth- er's scream is a version of the domesticity that recurs in Bishop's work. However, the essence of motherhood deconstructs in this passage, and the narrative shifts to a stereo- typically masculine setting to recover home: "Two men stand watching, chewing or spit- ting tobacco, matches, horseshoe nails - anything, apparently, but with such presence; they are perfectly at home. The horse is the real guest, however. His harness hangs loose like a man's suspenders; they say pleasant things to him; one of his legs is doubled up in an improbable, affectedly polite way, and the bottom of his hoof is laid bare, but he doesn't seem to mind. Manure piles up behind him, suddenly, neatly. He, too, is very much at home" (257). The repetition of "home" is telling, connoting not place or gen- der as much as interaction and acceptance. Also telling is the horse's ease, despite his bare hoof. The tone is comforting, but the details are not those of proper domesticity: Bishop employs her "method of embedding indelicate details inside a delicate frame" (Travisano 115). The child watches in fascination as manure piles up "neatly," as she later watches Nelly make "cow flops," "fine dark-green and lacy" (263). The animals' oblivious comfort with their bodily functions (like that of the spitting men) fascinates the child because such functions are taboo in "polite" company and because that com- fort contrasts with her mother's anxiety and with her own internalized distress; it con- trasts as well with the fear of the improper and unclean that contributes to the "abject" (Kristeva 2-5). The animals' behaviour aligns impulse with bodily action, and that behaviour is accepted within the physical and social surroundings. Unlike Beppo who vomits, the mother who screams, and the child who erupts in sores, the horse and cow are what they are without apology. Descriptions of animals, more so than the poet's accounts of her bodily illnesses, reconcile physicality with assurance. Bishop thus par- ticipates in modern culture's idealization of animals' presumed lack of self-conscious- ness: they appear literally and symbolically content in their own skin. Attention ening signs to an of unified animal being, such as it the also horse becomes in "To a means the Village" of revising not only and offers reviving heart- the ening signs of unified being, it also becomes a means of revising and reviving the domestic and of rescuing the damaged human from the abject. The continued description of the horse eloquently portrays creaturely ease. This passage follows a pattern of Bishop's writing in that careful observation of mundane, seemingly unap- pealing details (like the froth around the horse's mouth) and distortions of scale (his "enormous" size) approach the marvellous. Attention to the indelicate, grotesque, or sordid may liberate Bishop from feminine propriety and allow her to express darker impulses (Travisano 116); the visceral details also temper the transcendence of envi- sioning a stable animal as exemplar of a "world":</page><page sequence="11">Priscilla Patón 207 He is enormous. His rump is like a brown, glossy globe of the whole brown world. His ears are secret entrances to the underworld. His nose is supposed to feel like velvet and does, with ink spots under milk all over its pink. Clear bright-green bits of stiffened froth, like glass, are stuck around his mouth. He wears medals on his chest, too, and one on his fore- head, and simpler decorations - red and blue celluloid rings overlapping each other on leather straps. On each temple is a clear glass bulge, like an eyeball, but in them are the heads of two other little horses (his dreams?), brightly colored, real and raised, untouch- able, alas, against backgrounds of silver blue. His trophies hang around him, and the cloud of his odor is a chariot in itself. At the end, all four feet are brushed with tar, and shine, and he expresses his satisfaction, rolling it from his nostrils like noisy smoke, as he backs into the shafts of his wagon. (257-58) The horse, a huge beast that could be dangerous, provides an alternative to "the sensation of falling off / the round, turning world / into cold, blue-black space" of "In the Waiting Room" (160). In physical presence and temperament, he is a world unto himself as an example of composure not intimidated by surrounding "otherness." To a child's eyes his decorated bridle affirms his value. For that composure and for his dis- tinctive taxonomy as creature, he is worthy of medals and a fit subject for artistic con- templation, at least in the glass globes that contain icons of horseness. This is not a scene of perfect human behaviour or unalloyed bodily perfection. Yet there is no dissonance between inner states and outer appearance or between self and other: the creature itself (the horse), the greater community (the men and child), and the representative art (the decorations of the harness) converge in an atmosphere of acceptance and contentment. Unlike many beings, human or animal, in Bishop s writings, the horse is at home with others seemingly unlike him, he is honoured, and he is satisfied. This attention to the horse, like Bishop s other animal passages, creates a distrac- tion from self that nevertheless contributes to its "taxonomy" the experience of pleas- ure, worth, and belonging. Contemplation of otherness threatens, reasonably enough, when the other is censorious and destructive: the Worcester grandmother of "The Country Mouse" who disapproves of the child's clothes, worn dolls, country manners, and probably the marriage that engendered her. That threat is complicated when destructive tendencies are absorbed into the self: the girl of "In the Waiting Room" fears she shares her aunts foolish timidity and even the grotesque femininity of the cannibalistic women pictured in the National Geographic. These threats lead to disso- lution, the sliding into "blue-back space." But contemplation of the other when it moves (sometimes struggles) toward empathy is restorative, if only for a moment. The inverse of a self-consuming abject threat appears in a letter where Bishop</page><page sequence="12">208 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) illustrates her views on art with a tableau of Charles Darwin. This letter to Anne Stevenson is often quoted as an expression of the poet's elision of the conscious and unconscious and her "glimpses of the always-more-successful surrealism of everyday life, unexpected moments of empathy (is it?)" (66). These poetics imply creative openness, spontaneity, and resilience, far from the implosion of the abject self, and to some critics are "a latter-day version of Keats's 'negative capability'" (Rognoni 239). In addition, the imagined view of Darwin uncannily parallels the child's observations in the dentist's waiting room and her slide "off into the unknown": "But reading Darwin, one admires the beautiful solid case being built up out of his endless, heroic observa- tions, almost unconscious or automatic - and then comes a sudden relaxation, a for- getful phrase, and one feels that strangeness of his undertaking, sees the lonely young man, his eyes fixed on facts and minute details, sinking or sliding giddily off into the unknown. What one seems to want in art, in experiencing it, is the same thing that is necessary for its creation, a self-forgetful, perfectly useless concentration" (Stevenson 66). For Bishop, coping with a suddenly different perspective on other or self is not a matter of domination, but of the efforts of paying attention, not unlike the "efforts of affection" - a phrase she applied to Marianne Moore, another intense observer ( Prose 121). "Self- forgetful" entails not the loss of identity but a release from sickening self- consciousness. However, Bishop does not exactly replace the powers of horror with the powers of ecstasy. As the parallels between passages imply, the distinction between horror and ecstasy is not fixed; intimations of both vacillate in a poem's slide into the "unknown" as there is a "constant negotiation of the abject and ideal" (Zona 7). Self-forgetfulness during an idealized moment, in its possibilities and transience, shapes the poet's perceptions and self. The horse of "In the Village" is more consis- tently valorized than most of Bishop's creatures and is a sign that satisfaction, bodily comfort, ease in others' presences, and a realization of home exist. He offers as well the fascinating presence of sameness and difference, the seemingly useless facts of horseness. But his presence by itself does not radically shift the mood of the work, as do the animal epiphanies of "The Fish" and "The Moose": the disintegration of the mother is too painful, and the horse's contentment is too remote from the child's fragility. More often Bishop creates a dialectic and synthesis of the flawed and the attractive, the base and the admirable, to enable identification with, or at least recog- nition of, the "other," be it a snail, a fish, a moose, or a small child too shy with elders and too like a neurotic pet. The poet's efforts of attention, at first "lonely" like Darwin's, can lead to fruitful, rather than "fruitless attempts to identify with some- thing on the outside" to rescue the self from abjection (Kristeva 5).</page><page sequence="13">Priscilla Patón 209 In world a century of animals that saw like world Beppo, wars, the proud nuclear horse, bombing, or the racist deaf and dog ethnic Jock, whose upheavals, family a world of animals like Beppo, the proud horse, or the deaf dog Jock, whose family would "be lost without him" (263), may seem precious and childish. Although Bishop s childlike tone has been lauded, such praise can undermine itself with connotations of false innocence or an inability to face the conflicts, demons, and responsibilities of adulthood. A positive approach to this "childishness" is offered by a concept from developmental biology - neoteny or "the retention of juvenile physical and behavioral features into adulthood" (Melson 25). A simple illustration is that an adult Golden Retriever looks more puppy-like than wolf-like, and the retriever remains playful, trusting, and ready to bond with a stranger who shows interest. In general, primates, social and playful animals like seals, and domesticated species are neotenous, though Homo sapiens is the most extreme example of neoteny, in that human beings retain plasticity of mind and behaviour throughout adulthood (Gould 400-2). In Animals and Why They Matter, Mary Midgley blurs the distinction between neoteny as a genetic tendency and as a metaphor for receptivity: an intense interest in animals (like Bishop s ) demonstrates the "extra emotional porousness of the human species-barrier." Midgley believes that neoteny, from "an evolutionary point of view," may account for human beings' "exceptional development." Neoteny leads to "play of all sorts, including such things as imitating, singing, dancing and the making of objects for pleasure, habits on which the arts are based" (1 19). Curiously, such child- like tendencies and moments of pretend become responsible for the insight and empathy of maturity: The capacity for widely extended sympathy, for social horizons not limited to one's famil- iar group, is certainly a part of this childish spontaneity. It is also the window through which interest in creatures of other species enters our lives, both in childhood and - if we do not firmly close the window - in later life as well. It is one aspect of that openness to new impressions, that relative freedom from constraining innate programmes, which makes us culturally malleable [. . .] It carries with it, too, that still wider curiosity, that capacity for interest in other, inanimate surrounding objects - plants and stones, stars, rocks and water - which extends our horizon beyond the social into the ecological, and makes us true citizens of the world. (120) These hopeful speculations could describe Bishop s childlike attention to details many would overlook, such as the cow flops and horse s bridle, the fascination with land- scape, and a poetic quest for "widely extended sympathy, for social horizons not lim- ited to one's familiar group." Bishops writings do not ascend steadily to a Nirvana of sympathy, but "travel," to use one of her motifs, through abjection, repulsion, delight,</page><page sequence="14">210 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) and back again. The poetic quest can meander and stall, rather like the "Prodigal" among the snoring pigs who took "a long time / finally to make his mind up to go home" (Poems 71). Despite, or rather through, examples of negative worth conveyed by submissive, vulnerable animals, possibilities for an empathetic self in Bishop's writings arise from a "pastoral" vision that not only includes terrain but also embraces a rapport with cows, sheep, seals, dogs, cats, and moose. In that, she reflects the situation of animals in the mid-twentieth century when predators were seldom a threat, farms were not yet factories, and pets were common but not so excessively pampered (Franklin 5). Bishop's temperament remains close to the symbiotic encounters with the animals of her Great Village and Worcester childhood. In general, she does not select a creature for the sake of myth alone ("Leda and the Swan"), arcane symbolism ("I Am The Walrus, goo goo goo joob"), comic relief ("Rocky and Bullwinkle"), or wild threat ("lions and tigers and bears, oh my"). More so than poets of similar leanings, Marianne Moore and Amy Clampitt, Bishop depicts "neotenous" animals that do not scare. They inhabit the household and yard, though the backyard is sometimes Brazil; there is often an interaction between the poet and animal - a fish is let go, a seal is sung to, a pig is scratched, a dog is pitied, a moose is admired. If Bishop seems guilty of anthropomorphism, it may be time to reconsider that term. Anthropomorphism, like the pathetic fallacy, has been suspect in post-romantic literature and unacceptable in the "hard" sciences for the assumed falsity, arrogance, or sentimentality of the imposition of the human on the nonhuman. This rejection provides a needed corrective, but stifles ways to think about the other. Midgley ques- tions the assumptions behind the stricture of behaviouristic science "that the use of ordinary social and emotional language to refer to animals is illegitimate": "This attack assumes that human language is invented in the first place not only by humans, but exclusively about humans - to describe them and them alone." The attack fails to recognize that "language has, from the start, arisen in a mixed community" of species (124). Paul Shepard asserts, "the human mind is the result of a long series of interac- tions with other animals" (15). Primate scientist Frans de Waal advocates the "use of anthropomorphism as a means to get at the truth, rather than an end by itself" (xv). This certainly does not mean that the mind is always "right" about the "other," human or animal, but unconsidered charges of "anthropomorphism" elide the extremes of a continuum: the imposition of the self's preconceptions on external beings versus the attempt to place oneself literally or imaginatively in another's position. With poetic license, Bishop indulges in fantastical and transparent personifica- tion, as with the "Giant Snail"; but her anthropomorphism is generally nuanced. The</page><page sequence="15">Priscilla Patón 211 anxieties of self are suspended in a Darwinian concentration that turns over varied possibilities and qualifies impressions, as in "The Fish": "from his lower lip / - if you could call it a lip" ( Poems 43). When identification results from that concentration, it is enabling because of a "negative capability" embedded in the common perception of animals: they can be accepted as beastly and strange even as that difference (horse- ness, for example) elicits wonder. Identification with the animal, while it can have a transcendent aura, also suggests acceptance of the body that vomits, defecates, and becomes ill, yet remains the source of receptivity and responsiveness. The emotional and physical discomforts Bishop experienced in her life, as I have noted elsewhere (Paton 205), are reflected in portraits of distorted animals like the Giant Snail and redeemed in experiences like the "sweet sensation / of joy" that attends the awkward but "grand, otherworldly Moose" ( Poems 173). Bishop, it seems, employs a literary version of "critical anthropomorphism." As practiced by contemporary ethologists, this anthropomorphism combines the empir- ical method with "perceptions, intuitions, feelings, careful behavioural descriptions, identifying with the animal" (Bekoff) to approach, though rarely to know completely, what behaviourists could not: the mindedness of an animal, of an initially foreign consciousness. Implicit in Bishop's writings, and explicit in a theoretical paradigm presented by Donna Haraway in The Companion Species Manifesto , is the concept that accepting and respecting the animal other - on a continuum with the human but never in the same position - offers an entry into living with the likeness and unlike- ness of other human beings and to exploring "an ethics and politics committed to the flourishing of significant otherness" (3). To rethink the animal, then, not only extends the capacity for comprehending what is initially "other," it reimagines the human. In Bishop's case, the rethinking does not promise Utopian flourishing: her history is too marked by "the art of losing" (Poems 178). She does, however, recreate the contingencies in which the human, to repeat Paul Shephard, is "blessed in the witness of [animals'] mutual presence" and "given their surety that life is real and purposeful, even if the purposes lie beyond our grasp" (141). Bishop's writings demonstrate that she does not view "the social world as an exclusively human one" but as a "mixed community" (Midgley 1 18). If the ideals of belonging to a community and having a home remain troubled ones for a poet who seems the exile torn from relationships, they are often grounded, nonetheless, by ani- mals. Even the Prodigal sees that the "cows and horses in the barn" are "safe and com- panionable as in the Ark" ( Poems 71). "The Moose" too synthesizes the alien ("the impenetrable wood") with the domestic: "high as a church, / homely as a house / (or, safe as houses)" (172-73). Elizabeth Bishop's predilection is for the integration of</page><page sequence="16">212 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) human and animal presences, for a neotenous imagination, and for a critical anthro- pomorphism. It is not surprising, then, that in "Over 2,000 Illustrations and a Complete Concordance," the poet's image of the "old Nativity," her icon for divinity, is "a family with pets" (58-59).
