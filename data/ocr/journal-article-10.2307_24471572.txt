Curtis began the project of recording on film with explanatory text all available information on the Indians of North Ameri ca. He estimated the task would be completed in about ten years. By 1905 the project had not only not been completed, but Curtis had also depleted his own financial resources, and he sought a patron to assume the financial burden. He was fortunate in enlisting the sym pathy and financial support of J. Pierpont Morgan early in 1906, and in that year Curtis resumed his field work with renewed vigor. Curtis encountered every imaginable difficulty in the following years, but he was able to complete the project by 1930. He made over forty thousand negatives, first using a 14 x 17 view camera, later an 11 x 14, and finally a 6 x 8 reflex camera. Nearly all the photographs were made on glass plates. The final published work extended to twenty volumes of text, each of which was accompanied by a portfolio volume of plates. The North American Indian was one of the most ambitious books ever undertaken by a single man. Its text is of importance to the scholar of the American Indian and its plates record for posterity what Curtis thought to be a vanishing race. Forty years after the publication of the last volume of The North American Indian, The Pierpont Morgan Library, under the direction of Dr. Charles Ryskamp, presented a major exhibition of the photographs by Edward S. Curtis. This exhibition served to renew interest in his work and inspired both the exhibition in the fall of 1972 at the Phila delphia Museum of Art and this publication. The complete set of Cur tis's work at the Philadelphia Museum of Art was purchased with funds generously donated by the American Museum of Photography. PREFACE</page><page sequence="6">INTRODUCTION MIRRORS FOR IDENTITY in The Photographs of Edward S. Curtis It is th us near to Nature that much of the life of the Indian still is; hence its story, rath er than being replete with statistics of commercial con quests, is a record of the Indian s relations with and his dependence on the phenomena of the universe — the trees and shrubs, the sun and stars, the lightning and rain—for these to him are animate creatures. Even more than that, they are deified, therefore are revered and propitiated, since upon them man must depend for his well-being. Edward S. Curtis The images projected by Edward Curtis speak with urgency and time liness. The message is of people and of culture; it is of a multitude of ways of being and living, of acting and interacting, and of qualities of relationship. Across the total collection of text and plates the essential message is of a crisis. It is a crisis not exclusively related to survival of the American Indian and his cultures. It is a more general crisis terribly real for all men today, Indian and non-Indian. The critical problem is not of a vanishing race, as Curtis's generation saw it; for we now under stand that providentially the Indians as a people are far from vanish ing. The problem, rather, is rooted in a continuing and ever expanding process of detraditionalization whereby dimensions of the sacred are eliminated from life and from being and acting. No men are immune from the pervasiveness of this process. The spiritual and aesthetic shock experienced through the Curtis portraits derives from the realization that the qualities reflected here were forged by an age lost to the world of today. From this loss, modern man senses a nostalgia which leads with frantic compulsion in a quest extending in every possible direction. His search, often unconscious, is for something which may give back to life its meaning and purpose. The quest accelerates through time, for concomitant with the loss of INTRODUCTION MIRRORS FOR IDENTITY in The Photographs of Edward S.

In the result ing dehumanization and desacralization of Nature, man experiences suffering in fear. For if men listen to no other teacher, Nature demands that they listen to it; inevitably, it is the Master who must and will have the last word. Approaches to ecological problems which ignore these fundamental concerns will always remain superficial, illusory, and ineffective. The current renaissance of interest in the American Indian is in large measure related to our own critical concerns. In our search for our selves we are beginning to look to the American Indian in a manner never attempted before. We wish to know who the Indian was and is, by what values he lived, and the nature of his special relationship with his natural environment. Our hope is that these questions are being asked in sincerity, with real intellectual commitment rather than with just emotional reaction; for, if the search is sincere, it is possible that men may learn from the Indian's legacy and example. The problem in such a projected dialogue lies in the danger that once again the Indian will be used as he has been in the past. He may not be seen for, nor will it be asked how he became, what he was or is. He may be used, instead, as a mirror in which we conveniently see only what we want to see of ourselves and our personal illusions. Then, rather than finding answers to hard questions which demand a giving up of our illusions, hypocrisies, and favorite comforts, we may engage in the pro jection of an idle dream world, with the riches of the Indian heritage remaining as inaccessible and as incomprehensible as before. Those lost qualities of being, reflected with clarity in each personality portrayed by Curtis, and still to be observed and felt in many living Indians, provide eloquent statement about a rich legacy deeply spiritual in essence. We need to know the key dimensions of this legacy and the modes by which such wisdom becomes integrated into human personality. Aware of these broad considerations, and having experienced the emptiness of an academic world of irrelevant theory, some twenty-five knowledge as to who man is, is the abuse of his environment — now erroneously thought to be totally other than man himself.

We need to know the key dimensions of this legacy and the modes by which such wisdom becomes integrated into human personality. Aware of these broad considerations, and having experienced the emptiness of an academic world of irrelevant theory, some twenty-five</page><page sequence="8">years ago I sought for an American Indian who might still be a living example of the traditional values of his people. Eventually, I found Black Elk (Hehaka Sapa), an old sage of the Lakota, or Oglala Sioux, living on the Pine Ridge reservation near Manderson, South Dakota. In our ensuing day-to-day encounters, lasting several years until the old man's Black Elk, 1947 (Photograph by J. E. Brown) death in 1950, and leading to my adoption into his family, I learned to understand how qualities of being could become total, thus holy, through participation in the nourishing force of a rich and demanding spiritual heritage. If, as I observed, Black Elk manifested a quality of soul which could be called childlike, it was because for him the state of the child had become integrated into, not excluded from, the state of the man. He could laugh and play games and tell stories and relate to little children as if he himself were a child. When I asked how he understood his re lation to children, he replied that he and the little child were very close in reality; for the child had just come from the Great Spirit (Wakan Black Elk, 1947 (Photograph by J. E. Brown)</page><page sequence="9">Tanka); and he, an old man, was about to return to the Great Spirit. The attitude reflected an integration of being, present not by accident nor by chance; for it was the product of long participation in a total tradition of sacred wisdom accompanied by ritual method. Purity of body and soul was actualized in the Lakota through the rites of the sweat bath (inipi). In the round lodge where these rites took place, earth, air, fire, and water joined forces to act upon and cleanse the total man. Combined with purity of being and inseparable from it is the state of humility which, it was thought, must he present if guidance is to be received through the sacrificial retreat or lamenting. In purity with humility something of the primordial state of the child can become present in the realized man. This was one aspect of Black Elk perceived by those who knew him. Where there was in the soul of Black Elk purity and humility there was, at the same time, an expansion of being which finds its outward expression in spontaneous generosity, a prime virtue of the Lakota. His soul and being had become like the totality of the circle of the tradi tional camp, or as the circle of their dwellings, the Tipi, or like the round purification lodge, or ultimately like the circle as principle which finds its reflection in all the forces and forms of the world. Nature may teach this principle once the secret is known, but without the grace and power of traditional wisdom, such understanding remains inacces sible to man. Crucial to the actualization of wholeness of being are the many dimen sions of a wisdom learned and perpetuated through a deep understand ing of all the forms and aspects of Nature to which the Indian was ex posed in his environment. When Black Elk told his countless stories about the animals and their little traits and characteristics, I came to understand that he was talking about the deep realities of his religion. In the all important bison, for example, generosity was apparent to Black Elk, for his people filled almost all their physical needs with all that the bison provided: hides for lodge-covers and for clothing, horn and bones for tools and utensils, sinew for thread, and a hundred more</page><page sequence="10">articles from all parts of the animal's body. The bison was an all-giving mother, nourishing the people and, in her special care for her own chil dren, providing an example of a devotion mingled with sacrifice. In this way the bison was eminently sacred, wakan, containing in essence the generous all-giving nature of the earth itself. The four winds of the four directions of space, about which Black Elk often talked as if they were anthropomorphic beings, represented distinctive power which determined the dynamic process and qualita tive nature of life. Underlying this concept was the understanding that ultimately these winds were but one wind, unseen in its effects upon phenomena just as the Great Spirit remains unseen but is evident and known through effect upon the forms of the world. It was from such effects that Black Elk, and the Indians universally, learned the secrets of life, for every aspect of the outer world had its counterpart in the soul of man. Underlying all life —man, the animals, birds, forms and forces of the natural environment — were similar sacred meanings. Where there is actualized a wholeness of person rooted in purity and humility, there is possible the ultimate experience of identity and in tegrated knowledge of a fundamental unity underlying all the diversity of the world of appearance. For Black Elk, a bird like an eagle was not arbitrarily a symbol of some other or higher reality; it was that reality manifest. I learned this lesson in a hard way. As many Indians then did, I hunted eagles since I understood in what manner the older Indians valued their feathers for headdresses and plumes, wing bones for Sun Dance whistles, and claws for necklaces. Black Elk appreci ated these forms for use in various rites. Yet, one day he said that I should not shoot the eagle; for in reality I was shooting himself. In his frequent vision-encounters with the eagle he had come to identify with all that the eagle represented. He explained: as the eagle flies in a circle, higher than all other creatures, and as he sees all upon the earth below, so he was understood to be, ultimately, none other than the Great Spirit.</page><page sequence="11">This quality of identity, and relatedness to all that is, came to be realized not simply through encounter with the forms of nature, but first and primarily through the supporting power of the traditional values made concrete through the sacred rites and ritual forms. The fire at the center of the tipi, or the central tree at the center of the Sun Dance Lodge as axis of the world, or simply the central point estab lished at the earth-altar of the four or six directions of space, all ex pressed the concept of a central unity without which space has no meaning. Purification, expansion, and identity are the key dimension in the structure of Black Elk's world, as indeed they are the key to all legiti mate traditions and spiritual ways of the world. Within such a structure, Nature is not understood with the vague and romantic sentimentality which is generally our relationship today. Rather, the messages of Nature for the Indians are so situated within the framework of tradi tions of sacred origin that they constitute an exacting and complex science, the integral understanding of which, like all real knowledge, demands intense sacrifice. This was a part of the world of Black Elk. It was the recognition of the loss of this world that gave him the hard sense of destiny to mend in some way the broken hoop of the nation, to bring to flower again the sacred tree of life. It was this struggle which gave to his life both tragic suffering and the heroic elements of sacrifice. This was the kind of world which formed, in varying degrees and with varied expressions, the personalities documented by Curtis with the realism of his camera, tempered by his own creative sensitivity and by insights into his own inner world, which actually was very close to the world of the Indian. The words of Frithjof Schuon, one of the greatest living exponents of the philosophia perennis, provide apt concluding commentary to these qualities of life and being impressed upon the face of Black Elk and upon the subjects of the Curtis photographs.

A fascinating combination of combative and stoical heroism with a</page><page sequence="12">priestly bearing conferred on the Indian of the Plains and Forests a sort of majesty at once aquiline and solar; hence the powerfully original and irreplaceable beauty that is associated with the red man and contributes to his prestige as a warrior and a martyr. Like the Japanese of the time of the Samurai, the Red Indian was in the deepest sense an artist in the outward manifestations of his personality: apart from the fact that his life was a ceaseless sporting with suffering and death, hence also a kind of chivalrous Karma yoga, the Indian knew how to impart to his spiritual style an aesthetic adornment unsurpassable in its expressiveness. One factor which may have caused people to regard the Red Indian as an individualist— in principle and not merely de facto — is the crucial importance he attaches to moral worth in men —to character if you will — and hence his cult of action. The whole Red Indian character may be summed up in two words, if such a condensation be allowable: the act and the secret; the act shattering if need be, and the secret impassive. Rock-like, the Indian of former times rested in his own being, his own personality, ready to translate it into action with the impetuosity of lightning; but at the same time he remained humble before the Great Mystery, whose message he knew, could always be discerned in the Nature around him.

His interest in the traditional beliefs and values of the American Indians led him to Black Elk, with whom he lived for a year recording his account of the seven rites of the Oglala Sioux. He published this account in The Sacred Pipe, University of Oklahoma Press. He has also published The Spiritual Legacy of the American Indian, Pendle Hill. He is presently a professor in the Department of Religious Studies, the University of Montana. 12</page><page sequence="13">TEXT AND PHOTOGRAPHS TEXTAND PHOTOGRAPHS</page><page sequence="14">Perhaps it may be, and this is my prayer that, through our sacred pipe peace may come to those peoples who can understand, an understanding which must be of the heart and not of the head alone. Then they will realize that we Indians know the One true God, and that we pray to Him continually. We should understand well that all things are the works oj the Great Spirit. We should know that He is within all things: the trees, the grasses, the rivers, the mountains, and all the four-legged animals, and the winged peoples; and even more important, ive should understand all this deeply in our hearts, then we will fear, and love, and know the Great Spirit, and then we will be and act and live as He intends.

They moved about in space between the earth and the stars. They were seeking a place where they could come into a bodily existence. They ascended to the sun, but the sun was not fitted for their abode. They moved on to the moon and found that it also was not good for their home. Then they descended to the earth. They saw it was covered ivith water. They floated through the air to the north, the east, the south, and the west, and found no dry land. They were sorely grieved. Suddenly from the midst of the water uprose a great rock. It burst into flames and the waters floated into the air in clouds. Dry land appeared; the grasses and the trees grew. The hosts of spirits descended and became flesh and blood. They fed on the seeds of the grasses and the fruits of the trees, and the land vibrated with their ex pressions of joy and gratitude to Wakonda, the maker of all things.

The sun, which is so bright and beautiful, is one place where he has stopped. The moon, the stars, the winds he has been with. The trees, the animals, are all where he has stopped, and the Indian thinks of these places and sends his prayers there to reach the place where the god has stopped to win help and a blessing.

Only to the white man was nature a wilderness and only to him was the land infested with wild ani mals and savage people. To us it was tame. Earth was bountiful and we were surrounded with the blessings of the Great Mystery. Not until the hairy man from the east came and with brutal frenzy heaped injustices upon us and the families we loved was it wild for us. When the very ani mals of the forest began fleeing from his approach, then it ivas for us that the Wild West began.

My day is done. Darkness is stealing over me. Before I lie down to rise no more I will speak to my people. Hear me, for this is not the time for me to tell a lie. The Great Spirit made us, and gave us this land we live in. He gave us the buffalo, antelope and deer for food and clothing. Our hunting grounds stretched from the Mississippi to the great mountains. We were free as the winds and heard no man's com mands. We fought our enemies, and feasted our friends. Our braves drove away all who would take our game. They captured women and horses from our foes. Our children were many and our herds were large. Our old men talked with spirits and made good medicine. Our young men hunted and made love to the girls. Where the tipi was, there we stayed, and no house imprisoned us. No one said, "To this line is my land, to that is yours." Then the white man came to our hunting grounds, a stranger. We gave him meat and presents, and told him go in peace. He looked on our women and stayed to live in our tipis. His fellows came to build their roads across our hunting grounds. He brought among us the mysterious iron that shoots. He brought with him the magic water that makes men foolish. With his trinkets and beads he even bought the girl I loved. I said, "The white man is not a friend, let us kill him." But their numbers were greater than blades of grass. They took away the buffalo and shot down our best warriors. They took away our lands and surrounded us by fences. Their soldiers camped outside with cannon to shoot us down. They wiped the trails of our people from the face of the prairies. They forced our children to forsake the ways of their fathers. When I turn to the east I see no dawn. When I turn to the west the approaching night hides all.
