<plain_text><page sequence="1">Landscapes of an "Auftrag" Helen Fehervary The flood of citations of and accolades to Heiner MUiller have failed to mention the name of the one woman writer who had crucial influence on the language, style, imagery, political philosophy, and mythic topog- raphies in the playwright's work - Anna Seghers. Born in 1900, recipi- ent of the Kleist Prize in 1928, exiled in 1933, and a leading figure among antifascist writers in the 1930s, the German-Jewish writer Anna Seghers became internationally renowned with the American publica- tion of her antifascist resistance novel The Seventh Cross in 1942. The novel was a book-of-the-month-club selection, quickly became a best- seller, was published as part of the war effort in a special armed forces edition, and even became a recruitment tool as a comic strip serialized nation-wide. In 1944, after consultations with the author in Mexico, the director Fred Zinnemann turned the novel into a successful Hollywood film starring Spencer Tracy, Hume Cronin, Jessica Tandy, and Signe Hasso, and with Brecht's wife Helene Weigel in a stunning mute appearance as a concerned janitress who dutifully reports to the Gestapo a tenant harboring one of the escaped prisoners in his apartment.1 After thirteen years of exile in France and Mexico, Seghers returned to Berlin in early 1947 via New York, Stockholm, Paris, and Mainz. When Brecht, following his HUAC testimony, flew to Paris on 31 October of that year, he postponed his trip to Zurich by three days so as 1.

On 4 November he wrote in his work journal: "anna segh- ers, white haired, but her beautiful face fresh. [she says] berlin is a witches' sabbath where they already need more broomsticks. she is vis- iting her children who are studying in paris, and she also wants to recu- perate. in order to safeguard her mexican passport she is not living in the russian sector, so she does not get the privileges without which it is impossible to work. she wants her books to be read in the non-russian zones too. she seems to be perturbed by the intrigues, suspicion and spying. i encourage her to complete the 100 novellas she promised me 12 years ago."2 Following their meeting, Brecht wrote to Ruth Berlau that Seghers, who herself shuttled between Berlin and Paris, recom- mended "definitely, one must have a place to live outside Germany," and that one must "build up a strong group. It's impossible to exist there alone or practically alone."3 Seghers's own position as a left-wing writer and intellectual who sought to maintain an avant-garde position in the relationship between art and politics, and to tread the very path between East and West that was quickly eroded in the postwar years, can be compared in many ways to Brecht's. As John Willett has observed about their involvement in the projects and debates of the 1930s: "if there was a sister around it was Anna Seghers."4 In the GDR, both Seghers and Brecht were courted by the authorities and quickly assumed public stature and influence. Whereas Brecht's work revolved around the creation of a new kind of theater based on the experiments of the Berliner Ensemble, Seghers assumed the Presidency of the GDR Writers Union, a position she held for twenty-five years and from which she was able to have a major impact on literary developments in her time. They collaborated in a number of ways, most notably on the 1952 Berliner Ensemble production of Seghers' radio play Der Prozefi der Jeanne d'Arc zu Rouen 1431 [The Trial of Jeanne d'Arc in Rouen in 1431], which she had written in 1937 in response to the 2.

Seghers wrote new folk scenes for the Berliner Ensem- ble production, which thanks to the collective audacity and cunning of Seghers, Brecht, and Helene Weigel, was premiered on 23 November 1952 as a parallel/counter trial to the Slansky show trial conducted amidst much publicity and bombast that very same week in Prague.5 "Proof of the superiority of the system was its better literature, Brecht, Seghers, Sholokhov, Mayakovsky" - was Heiner MUiller's explanation in his autobiography of why he never left the GDR.6 The sentence has rarely been quoted by Miiller scholars, perhaps not only because it equates Seghers and Brecht. Seghers, whom Hans Mayer has called "the greatest woman author of German prose in our century,"7 was of course not primarily a playwright like Brecht and Miiller. Her influence, which extended to a great number of writers, is most often associated with the work of Christa Wolf, who has acknowledged her indebtedness to the elder writer in no less than ten essays devoted to her. But, as is obvious from a close reading of her texts, Wolf was more influenced by Seghers's essay style than by her prose fiction.8 In Miiller's case, the reverse is true. As is well-known, Muiller acknowledged his reliance on Seghers's prose in Der Auftrag [The Task, 1979] - "the play uses motifs from the narrative Das Licht auf dem Galgen [The Light on the Gallows, 1960] by Anna Seghers"; and in Volokolamsk Highway III: The Duel - "after Anna Seghers" [Das Duell, 1965].9 Mtiller's acknowledgement, especially in the first instance, is modest at best, since in these and other plays he took from Seghers's prose not only "motifs," but entire plot structures, stylistic patterns, linguistic idiom, poetic imagery, and even scenic arrangements and epic constellations for his memorable "landscapes." That MUiller was aware of the extent of his debt to the writer Seghers is suggested by a letter he wrote to her shortly after the 5.

I have taken so much from you, and it is not the first time: without your story DIE UMSIEDLERIN, the play that is currently being staged under the title DIE BAUERN could not have been written. Today, on your 80th birthday, I have the terrible feeling that after all I presumed to "take" for myself I can give you nothing but this stammered expression of my thanks and my admiration for your great epic oeuvre which will last longer than the windy clouds of the cliches and the screams of the marketplaces. 19 November 1980.

See Miiller, Herzstiick (Berlin: Rotbuch, 1983) 43; and Miiller, Shakespeare Factory 2 (Berlin: Rotbuch, 1989) 239. In these and other German publications Mtiller's acknowledgement is visibly positioned directly under the play title as it appears before the text. In his translation of Der Aufirag Carl Weber disregards this positioning and only includes a reference to Seghers, as if arbitrarily, in his Notes to the respective play. [Mtiller, Hamletmachine and other texts for the stage, ed. and trans. Carl Weber (New York: PAJ, 1984 ) 82; and MUiller, Explosion of a Memory, ed. and trans. Carl Weber (New York: PAJ, 1989) 109, 131.] Moroever, in both Notes Weber merely paraphrases the original German, and in the case of Das Duell severely limits the meaning of Mtiller's more accurate acknowledgement "nach [after] Anna Seghers." In his own Note to this play MUller wrote: "Volokolamsk Highway writes further [schreibtfort: i.e., "continues," H.F.] the story DAS DUELL by Anna Seghers." (Mtiller, Shakespeare Factory 2 244.) For an interesting discussion of these two texts (albeit in generational terms, from Muiller's point of view), see Anna Chiarloni, "Zu Heiner Miillers DUELL," Heiner Miiller Mate- rial, ed.

Likewise, the central plot and charac- ter in Traktor (1955/61/74) are derived from Seghers's story Der Trak- torist (1952). For his first play Der Lohndriicker [The Scab, 1956], MUller took the name, character type, and speech patterns of the figure "Geschke" straight out of Seghers's novel The Dead Stay Young, where the character Geschke plays a central role as a disgruntled worker aban- doned by, yet loyal to the Social Democratic Party of his youth. (MUller's autobiographical interest in this theme is well-known from his prose text The Father.) A similar parallel exists between the pious farmer Andreas Bastian in Seghers's Der Kopflohn and the old worker Bastian in MUller's Der Bau [The Construction, 1965]. Character types and character constellations in Die Schlacht [The Battle/The Slaughter] can be traced to a number of Seghers's prose texts, notably among them the physicalized "death-sleep" passages in the Stalingrad chapters of The Dead Stay Young. Moreover, the uprising that begins as a "walk" defying "traffic laws" in scene three of Hamletmachine is prefigured in Seghers's stream-of-consciousness narrative Auf dem Weg zur amerika- nischen Botschaft [On the Way to the American Embassy, 1930], which explores the thoughts of four individuals swept along by a crowd of demonstrators on the day of the Sacco and Vanzetti executions.11 Even a highly "deconstructive" play such as Verkommenes Ufer Medeamaterial Landschaft mit Argonauten [Despoiled Shore MedeaMate- rial Landscape with Argonauts, 1982] exemplifies MUller's continued reli- ance on the mythic topographies prefigured in Seghers's texts and their articulation of crucial political-historical issues. The first scene of Verkom- menes Ufer, for example, echoes the postwar setting, tone, and imagery of Seghers's narrative Das Argonautenschiff [The Ship of the Argonauts], written in 1948 after her return from exile and at the height of the cold war purges of Communists and left-wing intellectuals in both East and West. Both texts revolve around the failed revolutionary in the figure of the mythical Jason, who after innumerable voyages returns alone and unrec- ognized to his homeland. Seghers's own disillusionment at the time is 11.

He didn't believe in the gods anymore either. And in humans, now less than ever."l12 The mood of despair culminates in the tragic irony of Jason's death as he lies down to rest under a great tree, swarming with birds, whose branches hold the remains of his own ship: "The storm broke. It burst the last cords with one blow. The entire ship's hull crashed down on Jason. He perished with his ship, as was told long ago in legends and songs."l13 The tragedian Mtiller renders the moment in classical verse: "Bis ihm die Argo den Schadel zertrdimmert das nicht mehr gebrauchte/ Schiff Das im Baum haingt Hangar und Kotplatz der Geier im Wartestand" [Till the Argo smashes his skull the no longer required/Ship that hangs in the tree hangar and dung place of the vultures in retirement].14 Mtiller first publicly expressed his esteem for Seghers's narrative work in a review in Sonntag (31 May 1953) of her collected stories: "What her great novels bring forth in a steady, calm flow, namely the image of class struggles past and present, these stories bring into burn- ing focus: the historical process in the individual fate; the truth about what is real in the precise depiction of the real; its changeability, and the direction in which this change is to be achieved."15 Less than a decade later - after the workers uprising in June 1953, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the Berlin crisis and the Berlin Wall, and follow- ing his own expulsion from the Writers Union in 1961 - MUiller's style of writing, and thereby also his discursive relationship with Seghers, changed radically. What had first seemed like the "truth about what is real in the precise depiction of the real" appeared increasingly con- torted and abstract - yet evidently no less an inspiration for his own work. Mtiller's poem "Motiv bei A.S." ["Motif in A.S."] - neither is the narrative's title mentioned nor the author's name fully spelled out - was written in response to his reading of Seghers's novella Das Licht auf dem Galgen after its publication in Sinn und Form in 1960: 12.

Mtiller's acknowledgement of Seghers's active opposition to the campaign against him is framed in personal terms: her behind-the-scenes attempts to dissuade Siegfried Wagner, head of the cultural division of the SED Central Committee, as well as other leading functionaries, from their position; her request of Helene Weigel that she help Mtiller formulate the official self-criticism that might save him (as Weigel had earlier helped Brecht); and her overt gesture of sympathy in the form of a handshake before the officially assembled writers, followed by the gesture of protest in her sudden departure: "After Siegfried Wagner's speech Anna Seghers stood up and came over to Inge and me; she offered both of us her hand and then left.

The 1981 East Berlin Henschelverlag edition of Der Auftrag, Der Bau, and Herakles 5, on the other hand, indicates that MiUller wrote the poem "at the beginning of the sixties," (8) which must be closer to the truth.

Nor does the autobiography make reference to Seghers's other efforts on his behalf, among them her extended impromptu speech - dramatically staged with Schweijkean cunning and forcefully delivered in her broad Mainz drawl - before a closed meeting of the Writers Union Drama Section on 17 October, at which neither Heiner nor his wife Inge MUiller were present, and which he may have known only from hearsay even as late as in 1992.18 Mtiller was expelled from the Writers Union by a unanimous vote (with one abstention from Peter Hacks) on 28 November 1961.19 A Stasi report of a meeting of the Party caucus before the plenary session of the Writers Union mentions that "Anna Seghers voted against the expulsion" and that "Comrade Rodenberg twice demanded that Seghers take a public stand [i.e., as President of the Writers Union for the expul- sion], which she rejected with the explanation that her vote was suffi- cient evidence of her opinion."20 After the Party caucus Seghers left the building, that is, as President of the Writers Union openly boycotted the plenary session that followed, where the vote was to proceed as prede- termined in the caucus.21 According to the Stasi-informer Paul Wiens who dutifully summarized the information he had gathered that day, Seghers went directly to Helene Weigel, who "assured her that if MUiller so wants, she will give him any and all the support she can and will take him into the [Berliner] Ensemble. [Thereupon] Anna Seghers returned to the Writers Union while the plenary meeting was in ses- sion, had the Secretary, Comrade Schulz, called out of the meeting, and entreated him once again, as she already had done before the meeting, to prevent M.(iiller)'s expulsion." At this juncture the cynicism underly- ing the Stasi report comes to the fore: "She made a point of her com- passion and her affection. Among other things she also said that this 18.

When told that M.(Uller) was not even in Berlin, she became ponderous."22 What we know of Seghers's actual influence as President of the Writ- ers Union is still only fragmentary. As Christa Wolf wrote with some pessimism in 1992: "We don't know everything about her, certainly not about her hidden motives and actions, and we will never know it. Almost all the witnesses are dead."23 We do know that following his expulsion from the Writers Union in 1961, the period of Miller's great- est difficulties in the GDR coincided with the two decades in which Seghers, however sceptical and critical of the system she also helped to legitimate, became one of its cultural icons. Claimed as "unsere Anna" by GDR readers and Party leaders alike, the "princess of poets of the German Democratic Republic," as her former comrade and admirer Manes Sperber dubiously called her,24 had become a figurehead and legend long before she resigned as President of the Writers Union in 1978. The resignation was certainly due to her failing health and the death that same year of her husband Liszl6 Radvainyi, to whom she had been married for fifty-three years.25 But Seghers's resignation of her duties also gave evidence of her regret about the events of 1976 that led to the expulsion of Wolf Biermann and the ensuing campaign against an entire generation of artists and intellectuals. Indeed her own reluctance in November 1976, following her initial intention, to join the signato- ries of the declaration protesting the expulsion of Biermann, drove a wedge between her and the very writers whose side she had supported on so many previous issues, among them Stephan Hermlin, Christa 22.

Seghers did not, like Brecht, "die in time," as MUiller often said of the playwright whose person and work so preoccupied him. As a conse- quence, MUiller's relationship to the "Uber-mother" behind his own work necessarily became even more troubled and conflict-ridden than his already much discussed relationship to the "father figure" Brecht, of which he notably wrote: "To use Brecht without criticizing him is to betray him."27 Regarding Seghers, too, there was no lack of critique for fear of "betrayal," as in MUiller's 1990 poem "Epitaph," which eulo- gizes her personification of communism as the utopian goal and mourns its/her demise, yet at the same time, not unlike Hamlet's charge against Gertrude, "criticizes" her, the life-long Communist Party member, for also yielding to the step-father's "embrace": Now you are dead, Anna Seghers Whatever that may mean Your place, where Penelope sleeps In the arm of relentless suitors But the dead girls hang on the line on Ithaca Blackened by sky, beaks in their eyes While Odysseus plows the surf At the bow of Atlantis.28 If the poem suggests that Mfiller did not want to "use" Seghers with- out "criticizing" her, it testifies at the same time to the intensity of a lit- erary kinship whose evidence is plain in the mythic histories, 26. Christa and Gerhard Wolf have told me that when they asked Seghers to sign the declaration she first agreed, then after consulting with her husband, declined on his recom- mendation.

As Hans Mayer rightly observed: "All the world in Anna Seghers is at once also mythic world."29 The very same of course can be said about Heiner Miiller's plays - wherein lies the crux of the intertextual matter that concerns us here. As Walter Benjamin already noted in 1938 in his review of Seghers's Die Rettung [The Deliverance], Seghers's epic prose is not written from the perspective of the modem novelist, but from the age-old vantage point of the story- teller and chronicler. Her narratives do not address the indifferent reader of the novel (whom Benjamin described in "The Storyteller" as "warm- ing his shivering life with a death he reads about");30 instead, "they await the listener" ["sie erwarten den Horer"].31 Whereas Western readers know Seghers primarily as the author of such novels as The Seventh Cross and Transit, her contemporaries Ben- jamin and Brecht, and later Heiner MUiller, were particularly interested in those aspects of her work that are exemplified in her shorter, highly poeticized, and more or less explicitly "mythic" narratives. The prob- lem is analagous to that of Brecht's own work: Whereas Seghers's "anti- fascist" novels are comparable to the parable and chronicle plays written by Brecht during exile, her shorter "mythic" narratives have more in common with the experimental character of Brecht's learning plays and the internal critique inherent in what he called the "Grof3e Padagogik." The comparison with Brecht also helps explain why MUiller, who returned again and again to the model of the "Grof3e Padagogik"' and the learning play, also relied repeatedly and throughout his writing career on the poetic model(s) found in Seghers's "mythic" prose texts. As in Brecht's case, the "mythic" model in Seghers's work was first tested in the 1930s as the growth of fascism and Stalinism threatened to undermine the projects and self-identity of the historical avant-garde. Seg- hers's explicit contributions to the Expressionism debates, in which she came to the defense of modernism along with Brecht, Benjamin, Bloch, Ballzs, Eisler, et al., took the form of two open letters to Georg Lukics, 29.

This is most certainly the case in her narrative Die sch6nsten Sagen vom Rduber Woynok [The Handsomest Tales of Woynok the Brig- and], which Brecht published in the June 1938 issue of Das Wort.33 As we know from Benjamin's notes on his conversations with Brecht in Svendborg in the summer of 1938, Brecht "praised" Seghers's narra- tive for the very reason that "a crank and loner acts as the main figure in these stories."34 In the same conversation with Benjamin on 25 July 1938, Brecht made a point that must certainly have struck Heiner MiAller when he himself later studied these conversations, for it directly addresses the problematic which also continued to preoccupy him as a writer in the GDR. In Benjamin's words: "Brecht praised Seghers's Die sch6nsten Sagen vom Rduber Woynok because they reveal Seghers's lib- eration from the Auftrag (i.e., the "task" or "mission": "daB sie die Befreiung der Seghers vom Auftrag erkennen lassen"). Thereupon Brecht added what must have been all the more intriguing to Mi.ller: "Seghers is unable to produce on the basis of an Auftrag just as I couldn't imagine how I'd start writing without an Auftrag."35 The distinction made by Brecht in 1938 may strike us in retrospect as being somewhat overstated. Nonetheless, regarding Seghers and her own influence on Brecht (and later on Mtiller), it is instructive. Written in the wake of Karl Radek's trial in Moscow, and during preparations for Bucharin's, Seghers's Rduber Woynok tells the story of a reckless, 32.

And so once again - like Radek and Bucharin after their first banishment under Stalin - Woynok returns to the pack encamped around the fire: "A rush of icy cold air flew from him and fluttered around the fore- heads of the robbers. . . . He sat down on the earth, beyond those cir- cled around the fire. He resembled the Woynok of before as much as the dead can resemble the living" (44). Like Brecht's The Measures Taken, Seghers's narrative thematizes the philosophical contradiction inherent in the political-historical moment: "Woynok was much too weak to move nearer to the fire. Who should have thought of drawing him closer in?" (45) His increasing isolation and ambivalence - "Why did I come back here? Why did I make my way back on the terrible road across the mountains? . . . I could have had my peace long ago, I could have been snowed under long ago" (45) - takes him away from the camp one last time. By the time Gruscheck and his robbers find him, "he had burrowed himself head-first into the snow" (46). "Should he be buried in the camp?" the robbers ask in a tone reminiscent of Pilate's "indifferent" question as he presents Jesus to the crowd (a tone that also presages the inverted victor/murderer question in Miller's The Horatian). The laconic response of the (Sta- lin)/Grushek figure - "That goes too far" - is followed by the no less shattering narrative gesture by which the story ends: "So then they sim- ply laid Woynok down flat with his face up and covered him with snow. That was quickly done" (46). The thematic and imagery of the Seghers model are echoed in a num- ber of MUller's plays, notably in Der Bau: "I am the snowman, no tree can flatten me anymore."; "My life story is buildin bridges. I am/The pontoon between the ice age and the commune. But more impor- tantly, the topographic-anthropomorphic configuration that underlies 36.

He climbed down the rock face and tried to break into the forest alone. The fragrance and the darkness dazed him. Every movement of his body seemed to propagate itself into the endlessness; as if the forest were twitching convulsively over the splinter that had penetrated it. Woynok climbed a tree in order to check his course. He had scarcely moved away from the rock face. He had claimed as little of the endlessness of the forests as of the star- studded sky. (39) The stasis of history that in this case marks the years of the Stalinist purges and trials is reiterated in Miiller's Cement. The end of the scene "The Peasants" presents the failure of internationalist hopes as the turn- ing point from Leninism to Stalinism in the mid-1920s. Borshchi looks up at the sky, "moves his neck, as if in a yoke," and says "Stars." "I'm not interested in astronomy," replies Badyin. "The stars aren't inter- ested in us either, Comrade Badyin," says Borshchi. Badyin's answer ends the scene: "I don't need to see them anymore. Dead."38 In the ensuing prose passage "Herakles 2 or the Hydra" the focus shifts radi- cally from sky to earth, that is, from universal hope to the very mate- rial of the "body" that seems to "propagate itself into the endlessness" of the "forest," as prefigured in the passage from Riuber Woynok quoted above: "For a long time he believed he was still walking through the forest. . . . In the first few days and nights - or were they only hours, how could he measure time without the sky - he still wondered what might be under the ground which struck waves beneath his steps and seemed to breathe. How thin was the skin above the unknown below, he wondered, and how long would it keep him out of the bow- els of the earth. When he tread more carefully it seemed as if the ground, which he had thought was yielding under his weight, met his foot half-way or even attracted it with a sucking movement."39 The metamorphosis self/body/forest/beast is more explicit in Segh- ers's novella Wiedereinfiihrung der Sklaverei in Guadalupe [Reinstate- ment of Slavery in Guadalupe, 1948], as in the black revolutionary Jean 38.

Its roots twisted out of the earth like gris- tly hexes up into the branches. The branches grew back down into the forest ground, and everything was matted and mossy and entwined in liana. He didn't need to crawl any longer. The earth sucked him in. Its small animals whirred toward him, stared, tickled him. He was so alone that he no longer felt alone. He gave up feeling alone in the swarm. In the midst of so much life he gave up feeling like a special life that feared something. If any thoughts had still come to him in the hot whis- tling darkness, then he might have thought that he would rather die a thousand ways than to be destroyed by what he was fleeing.40 Like Sasportas in Seghers's Das Licht auf dem Galgen and MUiller's Der Auftrag, the black "free" man Jean Rohan is finally "destroyed," but nonetheless endures as the one "body" within the landscape and soul of the revolution that does not "betray" itself: "Jean Rohan knew it was the end. It would have been better to perish in the clench of a snake. Better a scorpion, even better a jaguar. Better to be a jaguar than a bloodhound. Was it better to be a slave than a dog? For a Negro it was only possible to live as a slave, or not at all.'41 The passage antici- pates the imagery of metamorphoses and resurrections conjectured by "FirstLove" in Der Auftrag - "slavery," "slaves," "bloodhounds," "teeth," "claws," "skin," "flesh," "tiger," "tiger mask," etc.42 Seghers's description of Rohan hiding in the crown of a tree, his violent death, and his subsequent transformation in death, is discursively more linear, but no more relenting than the equivalent passages on slavery/freedom in Der Auftrag: The hounds once again went into a raving frenzy. The patrol otherwise could not have distinguished the dark from the dark, nor have spotted the two white points that belonged to it. The patrol laid back its heads and yelled and whistled and screamed. Then it pointed and shot. The dead man first tumbled, then came down in gliding flight. The patrol left by the path the Negroes had cut with their machetes after it tore the rav- enous hounds - for the hunting season was short - from the booty. In its back a migration of insects hurled itself onto the remaining flesh; then came small rodents with teeth and snouts. At the end, shooing away 40.

In Das Licht auf dem Galgen she grappled with Stalinism - Napo- leon/Stalin as the liquidator of the revolution. I was interested above all in the motif of betrayal."44 This comparison has rightly been called into question, since the constellation "Napoleon/Stalin" in fact preoc- cupied MUiller much more than it did Seghers.45 The time span of the text's origins is instructive. Seghers already drafted significant por- tions of the text in the late forties during the antisemitic purges of internationalists within the Eastern Bloc. In this sense Das Licht auf dem Galgen must be considered alongside the two Caribbean novel- las she completed at that time - Wiedereinfiihrung der Sklaverei in Guadalupe and Die Hochzeit von Haiti [High Time in Haiti]. Whereas Wiedereinfiihrung der Sklaverei in Guadalupe, as indicated above, has as one of its central figures the black "free" man Jean Rohan, the plot of Die Hochzeit von Haiti revolves around an Ashkenazic Jew: Michael Nathan, a young jeweler inspired by the Revolution in Paris, comes to Haiti on family business, participates in the Revolution there, marries a black woman, and after her death and the defeat of Toussaint L'Ouverture, returns to Europe, where like Toussaint in his French imprisonment, he, too, soon dies. By foregrounding Jewish figures in her Caribbean novellas, Seghers averted any possibility of a neat colonialist/anticolonialist constellation. Indeed in contrast to MUiller's Der Auftrag where the Sasportas figure becomes a black man, the Sasportas character in Seghers's Das Licht auf dem Galgen is a Sephardic Jew. Moreover, Seghers's characteriza- tion of Jean Sasportas seems to be based on the historical figure of Rabbi Jakob ben Ahron Sasportas (born 1610 in Oran, died 1652 in Amsterdam). In numerous writings, among them the book Zizat nowel Zewi, Jakob Sasportas opposed the claims of the so-called "false Mes- siah" Sabbatai Zwi (1626-1676) and the enthusiasm of the Sabbataean 43.

By indicating that Debuisson is a white European landowner's son and presenting the Sasportas figure as both martyr and Jew, Das Licht auf dem Galgen inverts the prevailing Christian European myth and thus complicates the factor of "betrayal" in a significant way. Both Seg- hers's and MUller's texts draw on the iconography of the passion. Like the works of Brecht, whose knowledge of the Protestant Bible was impressive, Muller's Der Auftrag renders this iconography in a more or less explicitly Christian sense. Seghers's Das Licht aufdem Galgen, on the other hand, evokes the spirit of Jewish messianism and brings to mind the Jewish uprisings and communal experiments that culminated in the first century A.D. It is this messianic topography of revolution that lurks behind the many "Jamaican" landscapes of Seghers's novella, not least the "crucifixion" landscape of the gallows from which Saspor- tas is hanged, as well as the light that appears to shine from it.47 Completed at the time of the Cuban revolution and first published in 1960, Das Licht auf dem Galgen can also be read as the expression of Seghers's interest in the liberation movements of that time in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Certainly the novella also contains her response to the events of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Considered in this light, the figure of Debuisson who "betrays" the revolution can be said to bear aspects of the different political positions ascribed to Janos Kdddr, or even of the role of Georg Lukdcs in 1956, who as a member of the revolutionary Nagy government voted against its decision to leave 46. I owe this information to Bernhard Greiner, "'Kolonien liebt, und tapfer verges- sen der Geist': Anna Seghers' zyklisches Erzihlen," Argonautenschiff3 (Berlin: Aufbau, 1994): 155-71. In an intriguing essay advancing the notion of Seghers's "semiological ori- entation,"(160) Greiner argues that the anti-colonial liberation movements in her Carib- bean novellas are framed in antipodal relation to a European history of loss represented by the expulsion of the Jews from Spain at the time of the first voyages to the Americas. In this context Seghers novella is informed by the historical problematic of the "false Mes- siah," Greiner argues, whereas Miller's Der Aufirag shortchanges the issue by defining it solely in terms of revolutionary dialectics (157). 47.

The figure of Sasportas, on the other hand, seems to be modeled at least in part on the person of Imre Nagy, who together with other leaders was clandestinely executed and buried in a mass grave. That MUiller in Der Aufirag identifies himself as an author with the position of Debuisson, i.e., in this case with the uneven revolution- ary history of the antifascist/intemationalist/"betrayer"/reformer Janos Kaddr, or the "dual" position by which Georg Lukics was able to save his neck in the wake of November 1956, is quite in keeping with the original spirit of Seghers's own no less complex text. Based on theories and epistemologies that are largely extraneous to his own work, postmodem readings of Miiller's texts tend to interpret them as deconstructions of the histories or "stories" on which they are based. Any number of Mialler's pithy observations on contemporary art and culture could be used to argue against, or again, in support of, this trend. Instead, I would draw attention to Hans Mayer's words at the end of his eulogy to Anna Seghers on the occasion of her death in 1983. Referring to this German-Jewish communist writer's meager, and often hostile, West German reception, even in her native Rhineland, Mayer wrote: How is one to explain the fact that the work of Anna Seghers, world- famous because countless people have read it in all the world's lan- guages, the work of one of the greatest writers of our century, remained virtually unknown in her own homeland: sparsely read, dismissed by sham journalists with a few cliches? Party politics don't suffice as an explanation. Rather one must take into account that a disparaging soci- ety of consumers ["Wegwerfgesellschaft"], disinterested in where it came from and incapable of believing in any kind of future, can scarcely bear the tragic reality that is found in Anna Seghers's works.48 Heiner Mialler, it seems, was not only able, but felt compelled to "bear" that "tragic reality," reintegrate it into his own work, and pass on its poetic-mythic legacies to us. 48.
