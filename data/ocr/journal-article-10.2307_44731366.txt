<plain_text><page sequence="1">710079 Volunteer, Anthropometric Dummy, and Cadaver Responses with Three and Four Point Restraints L. M. Patrick and K. R. Trosien Wayne State University RESTRAINT SYSTEMS in some form offer the best potential for protection and improvement of the automotive safety record of any known safety device at the present time, ac- cording to the opinion of most safety experts in the western world during the fall of 1969 (1)*. Their overwhelming en- dorsement of this premise emphasizes the importance of re- straint systems and the need to know the performance charac- teristics of different types. Lap or lap and shoulder belts are provided for all seating positions in late model U.S. automo- biles (2). The purpose of the research program reported on is to evaluate the performance of the restraint systems presently utilized, and to compare the response characteristics of a vol- unteer, an anthropomorphic dummy, and cadavers when sub- jected to identical collision environments while wearing a three or four point torso restraint system. Many studies have been made of restraint systems on sleds (3-6), in staged crashes (7-9), in simulated crashes (10, 11), *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. with mathematical models (12-14), and in accident investiga- tion programs (15-17). All of the studies have contributed to the general knowledge of restraint system performance, but have not provided a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of parametric variations in the normal crash environment. Re- sults of careful studies of different parameters and their ef- fects on performance under identical conditions are reported herein. Simulated frontal force barrier collisions in a modified automobile provide the realistic environment for the restraint system performance study. The dynamic performance charac- teristics of the three and four point restraint systems are pre- sented based on simulated barrier collisions with a volunteer, a cadaver, and an anthropomorphic dummy as the occupants in the right front occupant seat. Restraint systems are complex systems involving human tol- erance, interior vehicle geometry, kinetics of the whole sys- tem, and interaction of the restrained occupant with the vehi- cle during the collision. The system is further complicated by the different seating positions which result in several con- figurations to be studied. The driver, who is always present, has the steering assembly to contend with, in addition to the ABSTRACT The paper gives an evaluation of the performance of lap and shoulder belt restraint systems currently being used in American-built automobiles. Comparisons are made of the re- sponse characteristics of a volunteer, an anthropometric dummy, and a cadaver when subjected to identical collision environments while wearing a three or four point torso re- straint system as occupants of the right front seat. Simulated frontal force barrier collisions in a modified automobile provided the realistic environment for the restraint system performance study. Human tolerances, interior vehi- cle geometry, and the interaction of the restrained occupant with the vehicle during the collision are reported in detail. 256</page><page sequence="2">active restraint system. With the introduction of the energy- absorbing steering assembly in 1967 models, the driver has a passive restraint system, as well as the conventional restraint system, to assist him in avoiding or mitigating injury. In both systems, the object is to decrease the relative velocity be- tween the occupant and the vehicle without causing injury. In current model vehicles, the driver has both a pelvis and up- per torso restraint available. The right front passenger also has the pelvis and upper torso restraint available, but does not have the steering wheel in front of him to modify his kinematics and kinetics. He does have an instrument panel which his knees often contact and, if the restraint system is loose enough, his head can hit the header, windshield, or instrument panel. The center front seat passenger is provided with a lap belt only. His position is complicated by the large tunnel which requires him to put his legs on one side or the other, the pos- sible impact to a rear view mirror, and a different seat cushion characteristic due to the tunnel which minimizes the deflec- tion distance available in the cushion. Bench-type seats limit the anchor positions for the center seat position pelvis re- straint, and the vehicle design does not provide a suitable upper anchor attachment point for a torso restraint. The im- portance of augmenting the active lap belt restraint with a well-designed instrument panel and a passive knee and head restraint cannot be overemphasized. The anticipated introduction of passive restraint systems in the form of airbags or others (18-21) is expected to have a major influence on the design and use of the conventional re- straint systems, but there is some question as to the feasibility of eliminating the belts when the airbags are installed. Con- sequently, this study is timely and the results will hopefully be beneficial in deciding whether the belts should be eliminated when airbags are provided. THREE AND FOUR POINT RIGHT FRONT PASSENGER RESTRAINT SYSTEMS The restraint system supplied as standard equipment for the right front passenger on current production American auto- mobiles is either a three point or a four point type. The four point system has four separate belt ends or anchor points, al- though the inboard belt ends usually anchor at the same loca- tion. In order for the passenger to don the system correctly, he must fasten and adjust the lap belt, either by retractor or adjustable buckle, and fasten and adjust the shoulder or upper torso belt. The commonly used three point system is somewhat sim- pler than the four point system in that the shoulder belt at- taches to the lap belt, leaving only three belt ends or attach- ment points at the buckle. The attachment to the lap belt in some vehicles is a keyhole fastener, which allows the outboard end of the lap belt and the shoulder belt to stay connected. The passenger can, therefore, don the entire system by merely buckling the lap belt, but he still has the option of wearing the lap belt only. Other shoulder-to-lap belt attachments are more cumbersome. Both three and four point systems are worn at the discretion of the occupant, and both can be worn without the shoulder belt. The current adjustment of the system is de- pendent on the user. There are many real or imagined objec- tions to both systems, and the limited statistics available indi- cate that usage is less than 4%. The overall objective of this paper is to compare the absolute and relative safety performance of the two systems on a vol- unteer, cadavers, and a dummy in forward force, simulated barrier impacts at velocities ranging 10-30 mph on the basis of: 1 . General dynamic motion comparison at impact veocities of 1 1 and 1 5 mph. 2. Detailed head motion and acceleration during the 1 1 and 1 5 mph impacts. 3. Neck torques and forces resulting from the two systems in the 1 1 and 1 5 mph volunteer experiments. 4. Tendency of occupants to submarine at the 1 1 and 15 mph impacts. 5. Velocity at which the volunteer, dummy, and cadaver submarine. 6. Effect of inboard belt length for the three point system on submarining at speeds up to 30 mph in barrier impacts. 7. General performance, including load distribution, as ob- served from the high-speed movies and oscillograph records. Each item is considered in detail, with results and conclusions based upon experimental data and general observations, METHODOLOGY A specially modified vehicle was prepared for repeated sim- ulated barrier impacts on the WHAM II (22) crash simulator shown in Fig. 1. The vehicle is a 1968 intermediate size 4-door sedan. The instrument panel and windshield were re- moved, and the belt anchorages reinforced to withstand the forces of repeated impacts. The seat was welded in place to prevent it from shifting during deceleration. All but four of the 30 mph experiments were conducted with the seat in the full rear position, since this would yield the greatest inboard belt length and ostensibly the worst submarining condition. The front seat was replaced when the understructure or spring- ing began to deform. WHAM II was programmed to simulate the impact deceleration pulse and stopping distance (dynamic crush) of a vehicle of this size and weight. The stopping dis- tances corresponding to the various impact speeds are shown in Table 1. Fig. 1 - Modified vehicle on WHAM II prior to a simulated barrier impact 257</page><page sequence="3">258 L. M. PATRICK AND K. R. TROSIEN Instrumentation, in addition to a vehicle accelerometer and velocity sensor, consisted of belt load cells and occupant head accelerometers. The load cells were three-bar, in-belt trans- ducers mounted on the belts near the anchor points at the upper shoulder and outboard belt and above the seat for the inboard belts. The low-speed dummy, cadaver, and human volunteer experiments were conducted with head accelerom- eters. A molded fiberglass skullcap with a biaxial forehead accelerometer was tightly strapped to the occupant's head. The volunteer had an additional biaxial accelerometer on a special molded dental bite plate. The signals from these trans- ducers were conditioned by broad band d-c amplifiers and re- corded on a light beam galvanometer oscillograph. Photographic coverage consisted of four high-speed cameras operating at 500 frames/sec. Onboard cameras were positioned to observe the belt-hip interaction on both sides. An overhead frontal camera was used to record the shoulder harness motion and the upper torso kinematics, and an offboard lateral camera photographed the occupant and vehicle during deceleration. The movies and the oscillograph records were synchronized by an inertially triggered flashbulb. Velocities of 1 1 and 1 5 mph were used for the volunteer- cadaver-dummy comparison with the three and four point systems, with stopping distances of 8 and 17 in., respectively.

HUMAN VOLUNTEER EXPERIMENTS Six simulated barrier impacts were conducted with a 5 ft 9 in., 160 lb human volunteer in the right front seat with a three or four point restraint system. Nominal impact speeds were 1 1 and 15 mph, with vehicle stopping distances of 8 and 17 in., respectively. The experimental setup was the same as for the low-speed cadaver and dummy runs, except that thick padding was added to the forward surfaces of the interior to guard against possible injury. The volunteer wore the instrumented skullcap, which carried a biaxial accelerometer strapped securely to his head, Fig. 2 - Volunteer with skullcap and biteplate before run 22 Table 2 - Right Front Passenger Restraint System Data-Human Volunteer Belt Run Velocity Type Belt f^eometry»,,t De8 Maximum Loads, lb Submarining^ No. mph point USH LSH OBL IBL USH LSH OBL IBL Right Left Remarks 17 11.2 4 27 58 56 62 230 190 115 120 No No Muscles tensed, one fist shoulder belt slack 18 10.8 4 29 65 68 60 450 400 120 120 No No Musclés tensed, no shoulder slack 19 11.4 4 27 58 66 60 430 370 210 200 No No Relaxed, no slack 20 15.0 4 26 65 68 58 560 460 170 190 No No Tensed, no slack 21 11.4 3** 33 - 70 61 520 - 160 490 No No Tensed, no slack 22 15.0 3** 32 - 66 62 480 - 190 510 No No Tensed, no slack ♦All angles measured from horizontal just prior to impact. ♦♦Overall length of inboard buckle tab of 7 in. t Indicates whether belt came over right or left iliac crest.

Hence, complete dynamic information about the head of the volun- teer was available. In-belt load cells were used at the extremi- ties of the restraint system. Fig. 2 is a photograph of the vol- unteer in position with a three point restraint system prior to barrier impact simulation. FOUR POINT RESTRAINT - Table 2 is a summary of the restraint peak loads, impact velocity, belt geometry, volunteer muscle condition, and lap belt submarining tendency. Sub- marining-the term applied to movement of the hip under the lap belt- will be discussed later in comparison with the results obtained in the high-velocity impacts. The first impact, run 17 (1 1 .2 mph), with a four point re- straint was conducted with the recommended "one fist" of slack in the shoulder belt and with the lap belt snug. The volunteer complained of a whip or snapping head motion and decided to eliminate the slack for run 18 (10.8 mph), which was conducted with all other conditions the same as run 17. Fig. 3 shows the oscillograph records for these two runs. Both records show the peak load for the lap belt to occur at about 90 ms after the beginning of vehicle deceleration with almost identical 240 lb lap belt loop loads. However, with a tighter shoulder strap, the peak upper torso belt reactions and the peak head acceleration occur earlier, 75 ms in run 18 com- pared with 1 10 ms in run 17. The accelerometer traces are similar in magnitude, but the duration of oscillations is shorter in run 18. The shoulder belt loads, both upper (450 com- pared with 230 lb) and lower values (400 compared with 190 lb), are twice as large as in run 17, but the volunteer felt less Fig. 3 - Oscillograph records for runs 17 and 18 with the volunteer in a four point restraint</page><page sequence="5">260 L. M. PATRICK AND K. R. TROSIEN discomfort in run 18. There is no obvious reason for the shoulder belt loads being lower in run 17 than in the following three runs. Runs 18 and 19 compare the effect of the occupant muscle reaction on the severity of the impact with identical four point restraint geometry at a nominal 1 1 mph. In run 18, the volun- teer tensed his muscles while maintaining the same initial posi- tion as the dummy and cadaver. In run 19, the volunteer tried to maintain a completely relaxed state throughout the impact. Fig. 4 shows the records for runs 18 and 19, with the begin- ning of vehicle deceleration in the same vertical line. The lap- belt loop loads increased to 410 from 240 for the tensed condition where the volunteer pressed on the floor pan with his feet. The shoulder belt loads are not greatly different for the two cases since the volunteer used the ride-down provided by the tight shoulder harness rather than muscle reaction to decelerate his upper torso. The accelerometer traces for run 19 indicate a more severe motion of the head for the relaxed state at this velocity. The curves for the runs are similar in shape, indicating similar mo- tion, but the magnitudes attest to the increased severity. Peak resultant acceleration at the mouth in run 19 reached 18.8 g, compared with 12.9 g in run 18, with both maxima occurring at peak restraint system loads. The volunteer stated that there was a great differnece in the violence between the two runs, but he felt no aftereffects. He was not aware that his limbs had flailed as violently in the relaxed run, as the movies revealed. Run 20 was conducted with the same four point geometry, but at 15.0 mph with the volunteer again tensing his muscles.

The curves for the load cells and accelerometers are similar in shape, and have the same phase relationships and essentially the same time dura- tions. However, the magnitudes of head acceleration in run 20 are greater than in run 18, and are equal to or greater than those of run 19. The resultant acceleration at the mouth reached 18.6 g in run 20 during the peak belt loading, and 13.4 g at the forehead mount 20 ms later. The volunteer stated that the upper torso loading was uncomfortable, but the head motion was not as severe as in run 19. The volun- teer did not want to try a 15 mph impact in a relaxed condi- tion or proceed to a higher speed with tensed muscles. Fig. 6 shows several frames taken from the high-speed movies of runs 18 (10.8 mph) and 20 (15 mph) with muscles tensed. The volunteer is shown at the beginning of vehicle deceleration, at time zero, at the beginning of restraint system loading, at 30 ms at near maximum belt loading, at 70 ms and after restraint loads are about over at 130 ms, but both SI ac- celerations are still high. At 70 ms after start of impact with maximum harness load, the head rotation is essentially zero. At completion of the loading cycle, the head rotation is con- siderably greater for the higher velocity, indicating that the muscle reaction is inadequate to maintain position of the head. As indicated by only a slight increase in maximum neck torque (24.1 to 27.2 ft-lb, Table 3), the muscle reactions are bene- ficial in reducing injury potential in low velocity impacts. THREE POINT RESTRAINT - Runs 21 and 22 were con- ducted with a three point restraint with a 7 in. inboard belt Fig. 5 - Oscillograph records for runs 18 and 20 at impact speeds of 1 1 and 15 mph</page><page sequence="7">262 L. M. PATRICK AND K. R. TROSIEN length, at velocities of 1 1.4 and 15.0 mph, with muscles tensed and no shoulder belt slack. A 7 in. inboard belt is about the minimum belt length with the seat in the rearmost position, which corresponds to a minimum practical belt length of 3 in. when the seat is in the full forward position. Fig. 7 shows oscillograph records for these runs with the beginning of de- celeration at the same vertical line. The time relationships of the traces for runs 21 and 22 with the three point system are similar to those for runs 18 and 20 (Fig. 5) with the four point system. The upper shoulder harness load with the three point system is 520 lb (run 21), or slightly higher than 450 lb with the four point system (run 18), probably due to a slightly higher veloc- ity (1 1.4 compared with 10.8 mph) and upper shoulder har- ness belt angle (33 compared with 29 deg), as indicated in Table 2. There is little differnece between the total loads for the three point system of runs 21 and 22 (1 170 compared with 1 180 lb), although the velocity for run 21 is 1 1 .4 mph, as compared with 15 mph for run 22.

The head accelerations for runs 22 and 20 at 15 mph with three and four point re- straints, respectively, are similar in shape and magnitude. NECK FORCES AND TORQUE - Acceleration measured at two points on the head of the volunteer permits a complete analysis of the forces and torque at the occipital condyles to be made according to the method of Mertz (23). The ac- celerometers are fixed with known geometry to the head, and it is therefore necessary to measure the angular position of the head from the lateral high-speed movies so that the directions of the accelerations can be calculated. The angular displace- ment is plotted as a function of time and it, together with the accelerometer traces from the oscillograph record, are digitized for computer analysis. The weight of the volunteer's head had been previously determined to be 1 1.50 lb, including the instrumentation which contributes 6% of the total. The total mass moment of inertia is 0.23 lb/in./sec , including the 10% increase due to the instrumentation. The angular acceleration of the head calculated from the ac- celerometer readings during the impact cycle is shown in Fig. 8 for run 19, with a four point harness and muscles re- laxed at 1 1 .4 mph. The vehicle deceleration pulse and the head acceleration curves are included for comparison. Prints of single frames from the lateral camera movies are included in Fig. 8, so that occupant motion and the measured and cal- culated responses can be compared. Each frame has an arrow indicating the time on the record corresponding to the time of the frame. At the start of the cycle, the head has essen- Fig. 7 - Oscillograph records for runs 21 and 22 with a three point restraint</page><page sequence="9">264 L. M. PATRICK AND K. R. TROSIEN Fig. 8 - Calculated neck forces and torque curves for relaxed volunteer in an 11 mph impact</page><page sequence="10">THREE AND FOUR POINT RESTRAINTS 265 tially zero angular velocity and acceleration. The first part of the cycle (positive angular acceleration) produces flexural angular velocity of the head to some maximum, after which it is decelerated, as indicated by the negative values. The two peaks of angular acceleration (plus and minus) for the volun- teer runs are shown in Table 3. The negative angular acceleration is of importance in flexural neck injuries. In the curve of Fig. 8, the negative acceleration is less than the positive acceleration, indicating that the in- voluntary control of the head by the muscles of the neck is sufficient to prevent excessive angular displacement, and the situation referred to as "bottoming out" is not present. When some critical neck angle is reached, the torque increases rapidly and injury results. In this run, the involuntary reaction of the neck muscles prevented the head from reaching the critical angle. The same analysis was executed for all six human volunteer runs, with similar curves being derived in each instance. Table 3 shows the maxima of each of these values and the time after deceleration at which they occur for the volunteer experiments. The extremes for the calculated values occur at the point of maximum belt loading for run 19. However, in the 1 1 mph runs with tensed muscles, the head reactions are delayed about 30 ms, and the peak neck reactions occur dur- ing the second maxima or reversal of the SI acceleration curves. The curves for the 1 1 mph run 19 (muscles relaxed) are similar to the 1 5 mph impacts of runs 20 and 22 (muscles tensed). The maximum positive angular acceleration of the head in run 19 at 1 1 .4 mph with muscles relaxed in 657 rad/sec , which is almost as high as the values of 746 and 700 (Table 3) reached in runs 20 and 22 at 15 mph with muscles tensed. Torque at the occipital condyles for the 1 1 mph relaxed run 19 is 26.2 ft-lb which is approximately the same as that of runs 20 and 22 at 15 mph, with muscles tensed where the neck torques were 27.2 and 26.4 ft-lb. Obviously, none of the neck reactions are above the human tolerance limits since the volun- teer was not injured. The same volunteer had been subjected to flexion torques at the occipital condyles of 66 ft-lb in sled rides, with only minor injuries, as evidenced by a sore neck for several days. The volunteer's apprehension and decision not to go to higher velocities in the series of runs reported herein was due in part to the position of the shoulder belt on his shoulder-neck intersection. VOLUNTEER, CADAVER, AND DUMMY EXPERIMENTS AT 11 AND 15 MPH A series of runs was conducted with a dummy and a cadaver at low speeds to duplicate the human volunteer experiments. The simulated barrier impacts were at nominal speeds of 1 1 and 1 5 mph, with both restraint systems installed in the same vehicle geometry. One fist of slack was used in the shoulder belt as in run 17 of the human volunteer series. The dummy, an Alderson VIP-50 anthropomorphic device, and the cadaver, a 5 ft 9 in. 150 lb male with a 35 in. waist and 37-1/2 in. hips, both wore the instrumented skullcap used in the human volun- teer experiments. However, no mouth instrumentation was used. The seat was kept in full rear position. The violence of the neck motion of the dummy was not an- ticipated, and the head accelerometer data from the three point system runs at both 1 1 mph (run 23) and 1 5 mph (run 24) velocities are not complete, since the traces went off the oscillograph record with values in excess of 70 g for both runs.

M. PATRICK AND K. R. TROSIEN unteer, cadaver, and dummy experiments, using the three and four point systems. Included in these tables are the restraint peak loads, impact velocities, belt geometry, and submarining tendency for comparison purposes. Figs. 9-12 are photographs of the oscillograph records for the dummy and cadaver runs. The lap belt loads of the dummy and cadaver can only be compared with volunteer run 19, where the volunteer was re- laxed. The upper shoulder harness loads can only be com- pared with volunteer run 17, where there was one fist of slack. In the remaining volunteer runs, the values for the vol- unteer will be attenuated due to muscle tension, and will be modified by the lack of slack in the shoulder harness. The same reasoning applies to the head accelerometer readings, which are dependent on the degree of upper torso restraint. The time relationships for the restraint system load maxima are essentially the same for the dummy and cadaver (Figs. 9-12). The peak values are reached at 85-95 ms after the be- ginning of deceleration at 15 mph, and at 95-105 ms at 1 1 mph. The time to peak restraint load reaction for the 1 1 mph volunteer run 17 with the same shoulder belt slack is 100 ms, or about the same as for the cadaver and dummy. The time to peak loads is shorter for the 1 1 and 15 mph volunteer runs 18-22 without slack in the shoulder belt. Comparison of the upper shoulder harness loads shows volun- teer run 17 to have a load of 230 lb, cadaver run 27 to have a load of 350 lb and dummy run 25 with a load of 520 lb, all for the four point system at 1 1 mph. The volunteer run was with muscles tense and one fist of slack in the shoulder har- ness, which is the same as the slack for the cadaver and dummy runs. There was no 1 1 mph run with the three point system for the volunteer with slack in the upper harness. Therefore, the comparison on a three point system will be only for the cadaver and dummy. Cadaver run 29 resulted in a 420 lb upper shoulder load, while the same load for dummy run 23 was 560 lb. There is a marked increase in upper shoulder load going from the volunteer to the cadaver to the dummy for both the three and four point systems, as indicated in the data just presented. The increase in lap belt loads with velocity is illustrated in the four point system. The relaxed volunteer run 19 at 1 1 mph has a loop load of 410 lb, cadaver run 27 has a loop load of 430 lb, and dummy run 25 has a loop load of 620 lb. For the same conditions at 1 5 mph, there is no comparable re- laxed volunteer run; cadaver run 28 has a load of 740 lb (sub- marining occurs) and dummy run 26 has a lap loop load of 1050 lb. Again, the larger load for the dummy run under the same conditions is obvious. Fig. 13 compares the resultant head accelerations for runs 19, 27, and 25 for the volunteer, cadaver, and dummy, with the four point restraint at 1 1 mph arranged on the same time reference with respect to vehicle deceleration. Fig. 13 also shows several frames from the high-speed movies for each of these runs in order to compare occupant motion. Volunteer run 19 is different from runs 27 and 25 in that there is no slack in the shoulder harness. The volunteer was re- laxed, which is considered to be the closest to the cadaver and dummy conditions that can be achieved. Without slack in the belt, the head acceleration followed a long duration, com- paratively low magnitude path, while the cadaver in run 27 had a somewhat similar but higher magnitude record. The higher magnitude can be explained by the impact load that oc- Table 5 - Comparisons of Four Point Restraint System Loads for the Volunteer, Cadaver, and Dummy. 11 And 15 mph Barrier Collision Simulations. _ ,r , Belt Geometry, Deg Maximum Loads, lb Submarining _ Run ,r Vel, , 1 _ No. mph USH LSH OBL IBL USH* LSH OBL IBL Right Left Subject** 17 11.2 27 58 56 62 230-S 190 115 120 No No Vol.-T 18 10.8 29 65 68 60 450-NS 400 120 120 No No Vol.-T 19 11.4 27 58 66 60 430-NS 370 210 200 No No Vol.-R 27 11.4 30 68 60 59 350-S 290 220 210 No No Cad. 25 11.0 32 62 58 67 520-S 330 340 280 No No Dum. 20 15.0 26 65 68 58 560-NS 460 170 190 No No Vol.-T 28 15.3 26 64 65 55 530-S 410 400 340 No Yes (340)f Cad. 26 15.3 34 60 63 70 680-S 450 530 520 No No Dum. *S - One fist of slack, NS - No slack in upper shoulder belt. ♦♦Volunteer muscle tone: T - Tensed, R - Relaxed, f Max load sustained after submarining, IBL.

Dummy run 25 (neck adjusted as tightly as possible) is dis- tinctly different from the other two runs, in that there is a very high spike near the end of the cycle. This spike is due to the bottoming-out characteristic of the dummy neck, which is much more abrupt than that found in the cadaver or the human. SUBMARINING TENDENCIES AT 1 1 AND 15 MPH - Of interest in these experiments in the tendency for submarin- ing associated with the two restraint systems. Submarining is defined as the movement of the lap belt up over one or both iliac crests (conversely, the hip moves under the belt) so that the belt forces are applied to the abdominal area, creating an injury hazard to the abdominal viscera and spine. Since the shoulder belt attaches to the lap belt in a three point system, there can be a component of force tending to pull the lap belt upward, increasing the submarining tendency. The length of the inboard lap belt end or tab determines the point at which the shoulder belt attaches to the lap belt loop and, therefore, affects the submarining tendency. The vehicle used had a bench-type front seat, and the in- board belt anchored to the floor passed between the seat back and cushion. Establishing the minimum tab length of 3 in., with the seat in the most forward position, resulted in a 7 in. tab length when the seat was moved to the rearmost position. Tab length was varied from 7 to 12-3/4 in. above the seat trim to study its effect on submarining, although the longer length is not likely to be used. With a minimum tab length of 3 in., Fig. 9 - Oscillograph records for 1 1 and 15 mph dummy runs with a three point restraint</page><page sequence="13">268 L. M. PATRICK AND K. R. TROSIEN the upper shoulder harness at the attachment with the seat belt is approximately colinear with the inboard seat belt tab, so there is a minimal tendency to lift the lap belt over the iliac crest. The Alderson VIP-50 dummy has a simulated pelvic com- plex. The skeletal structure has a "flesh" covering which ex- tends above the iliac crests approximately 1 in. and stops, leaving a gap into which the belt can slide if submarining oc- curs. This hip complex is good for investigating the submarin- ing potential of a restraint system, since there is no doubt when the belt snaps over the iliac crests. The thighs are larger in diameter than a 50th percentile male, causing the lap belt to be positioned higher on the anterior iliac spines than nor- mal, which increases the submarining tendency. The higher position of the lap belt could be considered comparable to belt position for an occupant who fastens his lap belt over his coat. This dummy should give a conservative estimate of the submarining potential of a restraint system, in that its ten- dency to submarine is probably greater than that of the aver- age human. Observing belt movement with respect to the ilium with a wrapped or covered cadaver is difficult. The hips are usually not prominent, and motion of the flesh covering prevents sur- face references from being used. General anatomical refer- ences such as leg and spine positions are used to determine the probable location of the crests and to estimate the time of sub- Fig. 10 - Oscillograph records for 1 1 and 15 mph dummy runs with a four point restraint</page><page sequence="14">THREE AND FOUR POINT RESTRAINTS 269 marining. When submarining occurs with abdominal compres- sion which could produce injuries to the abdominal viscera, the lap belt slips over the top of the iliac crests which are then quite pronounced in the high-speed movies. The major difference in the behavior of the two restraint systems as installed in the test vehicle is the interaction of the lap belt with the occupant hip complex. As indicated in Table 4, for the three point system the lap belt rode over the inboard hip for all of the cadaver and dummy runs, except for the 10 mph run with a 3 in. tab. Submarining did not occur for either of the volunteer runs, although in the 15 mph run 22, analysis of the high-speed movies indicated that the in- board side of the belt was quite high on the iliac crest. Fig. 14 shows several frames from the high-speed movies of the 15 mph run 22, in which submarining was imminent for the volunteer. Several different investigators looked at the movie with one indicating that, in his opinion, submarining had occurred. However, the general consensus was that submarining was close but did not actually occur. The volunteer's muscles were tense and his feet were pressing against the floor board, which tended to prevent the pelvis from rotating under the belt. While in the cadaver and dummy runs there is no such action, it should be pointed out that the relaxed individual who has been sleeping or does not realize that a collision is about to take place would probably be more prone to submarining. Also, since the submarining tendency was noted to be greater at the higher speeds for the volunteer as well as for the other occupant, it is concluded that at higher Fig. 11 - Oscillograph records for 11 and 15 mph cadaver runs with a four point restraint</page><page sequence="15">270 L. M. PATRICK AND K. R. TROSIEN velocities under the same conditions, the volunteer would probably have submarined. When submarining occurs on the inboard side with the three point system, the resulting abdominal loads cannot be ex- plicitly determined, because the inboard load cell senses the lower shoulder harness load as well as the abdominal or lap belt load. An upper bound for this load can be obtained from the maximum outboard load cell reading which occurs after submarining. Because of the decrease in body rigidity which occurs when the lap belt slips over the top of the iliac crest, the major portion of the lower restraint load will be applied to the outboard belt, which is still in contact with the opposite iliac crest. Consequently, the abdominal load will be less than the corresponding outboard belt load. In the case of the cadaver runs, the maximum loads applied to the abdomen were less than 250 and 500 lb for the 1 1 and 15 mph runs, respectively. For the four point system, sub- marining occurred only for the cadaver in the 15 mph run 28. As indicated in Table 5, the maximum load applied to the abdomen after submarining was 340 lb. Only moderate ab- dominal compression was observed in the high-speed movie analysis of these runs. DUMMY AND CADAVER EXPERIMENTS AT HIGH VELOCITIES To investigate the submarining tendencies at higher veloc- ities, a series of simulated barrier impacts was conducted at Fig. 12 - Oscillograph records for 11 and 15 mph cadaver runs with a three point restraint</page><page sequence="16">THREE AND FOUR POINT RESTRAINTS 271 Fig. 13 - Comparison of resultant forehead accelerations and head motions for the volunteer, cadaver, and dummy at 11 mph</page><page sequence="17">272 L. M. PATRICK AND K. R. TROSIEN 20 and 30 mph using the same vehicle. Only cadaver and dummy data were obtained at these velocities, since the volun- teer was not willing to go higher than 15 mph. Instrumenta- tion was confined to vehicle accelerometer and restraint sys- tem load cells. In many runs, an additional load cell was located in the shoulder belt just above the attachment at the lap belt buckle of the three point system. As indicated in Table 6, the lap belt rose over at least one hip in all of the 20 and 30 mph runs conducted with the three point system with both the dummy and cadaver. The effect of changing the length of the inboard belt was to change the time at which submarining occurred. Submarining occurred earlier with a long tab than with a short tab length, resulting in higher loads being applied to the abdomen. With the four point system (Table 7), the dummy did not submarine on the 20 mph run 5, nor on one of the two 30 mph runs, run 14. The cadaver submarined on both 30 mph runs. The resulting maximum abdominal loads were 920 lb for run 9, where only the inboard hip submarined, and 880 and 900 lb for a total of 1780 lb in run 16, where both hips submarined. Submarining with the three point system with the long tab occurred almost as soon as the belts begin to load, causing the lap belt restraint load on the side(s) which submarined to be applied to the abdomen and not to the illium as desired. Fig. 15 and 16 are the oscillograph records for runs 7 and 10 with the VIP-50 dummy, shown with several frames from the high-speed movies for these 30 mph runs. The inboard belt or tab length in run 10 was 12-3/4 in., which put the shoulder belt attachment point near the middle of the lap belt. The second photograph in Fig. 16 shows the instant at which the belt slipped over the left hip. The in- board load cell signal showed a dip or load decrease as the belt force decreased. The outboard or right side submarined about 10 ms later, as indicated by the dip in the transducer signal. There was a tendency for both hips to submarine earlier when the tab was long. The major restraining action on the dummy, after submarining occurred in this run was by the shoulder harness with a maximum load of 2370 lb as the lap belt loop load decreased to about 600 lb after submarining. The dummy rotated to the right and the lap belt was buried in the abdominal opening, as the last two photographs at 40 ms intervals show. Similar photographs for run 7 in Fig. 15 show the lap belt still on the hip at the 50 ms point, at which submarining oc- curred in run 10 with the longer tab length. Submarining oc- curred only on the inboard side in run 7 and at a later time. There is less upper torso rotation in run 7. The reactions of the dummy and the cadaver are compared in Figs. 17 and 18 for runs 1 1 and 12. Both runs are with the three point system in the same configuration with an 1 1 in. in- board belt. The frames from the high-speed movies were taken at 40, 60, 80, 120, and 160 ms after beginning of vehicle deceleration for both runs. Comparison of these single frames shows good correlation between the kinematics of the dummy and the cadaver. The load cell records are also similar, except Fig. 14 - Photos of high- speed movies at beginning of deceleration and at maximum belt loading, showing movement of in- board belt tab on left hip of volunteer</page><page sequence="18">THREE AND FOUR POINT RESTRAINTS 273 for the double hump in the upper shoulder belt load, which is a peculiarity of the dummy found in several runs. Since the inboard belt is relatively long, submarining occurs early. The second photograph for each run taken at 60 ms shows the belt over the inboard hip. The submarining is reflected in the inboard load cell record in run 11 at 40 ms by the momentary change in slope. The lap belt is shown to pull deep into the abdominal area in the succeeding photographs.

TROSIEN This loading which is applied through the lap belt after sub- marining occurred could cause internal injury to a living oc- cupant. The hip complex of both occupants rotates out from under the lap belt after submarining because the lap belt force is applied above the pelvis. The springing of the seat cushion permits downward motion which reduces the lap belt angle. The last frames in both figures show the cadaver and dummy with increased curvature of the lower spine. The cadaver submarines more readily than the dummy or human volunteer due to the moist plastic wrappings and tights which cover the belt contact areas. Frictional resistance to belt mo- tion is lower than that of clothes and tends to aggravate cadaver submarining. Another comparison of the three and four point systems is presented in Figs. 19 and 20 of runs 14 and 15 at 30 mph. These runs were conducted with the seat full forward with a 7 in. tab in run 15, which is the tab length corresponding to an 1 1 in. length with the seat fully back. The figures again in- clude several frames from the high-speed movies at 24, 44, 64, 84, and 124 ms after the beginning of vehicle deceleration. The kinematics of the two occupants are similar, and both re- straints prevent the occupant from dangerous impacts to the vehicle interior. There are significant differences, however. The second frame for the three point system (Fig. 19) shows the inboard buckle assembly close to the top of the hip com- plex. Ten ms later, the load cell signal has the characteristic dip indicating the sudden loosening at submarining, and the third frame shows the lap belt pulled into the abdominal cavity. Analysis of the frames for the four point belt shows the lap belt to be on the hips throughout the entire loading period. The hip complex is kept below the torso, preventing increased curvature of the lower spine and minimizing po- tential injury. Submarining occurs first on the inboard hip with either re- straint system. This is due to the smaller inboard lap belt angle caused by routing the belt through the seat crease, and is further aggravated for the three point system by attaching the shoulder harness belt to the lap belt on the inboard side. Only cadaver runs will be considered in calculating the ab- dominal load, due to lack of compliance in the dummy ab- Fig. 15 - Transducer record with several movie frames for run 7 with a three point belt with a 7 in. tab at 30 mph</page><page sequence="20">THREE AND FOUR POINT RESTRAINTS 275 dominai region which makes the loads less meaningful. In the 30 mph runs 8 and 12, the submarining occurred on the in- board side only, while in run 13 at 30 mph, the submarining occurred on both hips. In run 8, the force on the abdomen was, at most, 860 lb, and in run 12 the abdominal load was, at most, 720 lb, as indicated by the outboard load cell reading of Table 6. The 30 mph run 13, in which submarining occurred on both hips, resulted in a maximum total load of approximately 1360 lb, calculated by doubling the outboard belt load shown in Table 6. Submarining on the four point system at 30 mph occurred on one side in run 9 and on both sides in run 16. In run 9, with the one side submarining, the force was 920 lb, based on the inboard load cell reading, while in run 16, the total load on the abdomen with both sides submarining was 1 780 lb, based on the summation of the forces at both ends of the lap belt, as shown in Table 7. The maximum loads occur- ring after submarining were lower for the three point than for the four point restraint system. Submarining occurred on both hips in run 16 as compared with one hip in run 9 under identical conditions, illustrating one of the major disadvantages of cadavers. The cadaver had been subjected to five 30 mph impacts between run 9 and run 16, so its response might have been altered due to tissue damage. The difference is probably considerably less than physiological variation in the occupant popula- tion. SUMMARY There were 19 runs with the three point system, with sub- marining occurring in 16 of them. Submarining on one hip was observed in 12 cases and on both hips in four cases. The volunteer was subjected to two three point system runs and four four point system runs, divided between 1 1 and 15 mph, without submarining occurring in any of the runs. Submarin- ing was imminent in the 15 mph three point system run. Submarining occurred on one hip at the 1 1 and 1 5 mph runs for the three point system with the cadaver, on one hip in two of the 30 mph runs, and on two hips on one 30 mph run with Fig. 16 - Results of run 10 with a three point system with a 12-3/4 in. tab at 30 mph</page><page sequence="21">276 L. M. PATRICK AND K. R. TROSIEN the cadaver. The dummy submarined on one hip at 1 1 mph, one hip at 1 5 mph, one hip in two runs at 20 mph, one hip in thřee runs at 30 mph, and both hips in one run at 30 mph. The volunteer did not submarine in any of the four runs with the four point system. The cadaver did not submarine with the four point system at 1 1 mph. At 15 mph, the cadaver submarined on one hip, and at 30 mph, the cadaver submarined on one hip in one run and on both hips in one run with the four point system. With the four point system, the dummy did not submarine at 11, 15, and 20 mph. In the 30 mph run, the dummy did not submarine in one run and sub- marined on one hip in the other run. From these data it can be concluded that the volunteer with tense muscles is not as prone to submarining with the three point belt as either the dummy or cadaver. Also, the dummy is not as prone to submarining as the cadaver, as evidenced by more frequent submarining at lower velocities in the case of the cadaver than in the case of the dummy. The four point system is not as likely to result in submarining at any of the velocities investigated as the three point system is. When an occupant wearing a lap belt only is subjected to a severe impact and the lap belt rides over the iliac crests, injury to the abdominal viscera occurs. This has been documented by several authors (24-26). A literature search reveals a lim- ited number of injury cases with the three point belt. The in- jury pattern is considerably different than for lap belt only. Three point harness injuries are usually higher on the torso with sternum and lower rib fractures, plus injuries to organs under the lower part of the rib cage (27-30). In many foreign countries, the three point systems are used extensively, and abdominal injuries are rarely reported. If submarining does not occur, it could be due to a better installation available in the bucket seats that are prevalent in many European auto- mobiles. This is particularly true in the case of the Volvo sys- tem used in Sweden, which is probably the most widely-used three point system in the world. If submarining does occur, the apparent lack of injury could be attributed to better load distribution over the torso by the combined lap and shoulder harness. Consequently, it should be pointed out that even though the three point system is more prone to submarining with the installations used with the bench-type seats, there is no positive evidence that such submarining leads to serious injuries. However, the abdominal area is more prone to injury from loading by the lap belt than the pelvis or other skeletal parts; it is obvious that precautions should be taken to minimize the exposure of the abdomen to such injuries. One potential problem associated with the four point sys- Fig. 17 - Oscillograph record and movie frames for run 11 with a VIP-50 dummy and three-point system with an 11 in. inboard belt</page><page sequence="22">THREE AND FOUR POINT RESTRAINTS 277 tern in high-velocity impacts is the sliding of the shoulder strap across the chest of the occupant. The frames in Fig. 19 show the shoulder belt to rise up under the left arm as the occupant moves forward. In addition to abrasion of the right side of the neck, there is the possibility of breast injury to female passengers. Also, when submarining occurs, the high position of the belt produces a higher location of the resultant force applied to the torso than for the three point system, resulting in higher abdominal loads as noted previously. However, use of the four point system offers an overall safety benefit and this ride-up hazard does not appear to be as severe as that associated with the three point system. Rib fractures (area of ninth and tenth ribs) and associated ab- dominal injuries have been reported (27, 28) with the use of the three point system. The greater likelihood of submarining occurring for the three point system is also believed to be more significant than the shoulder belt rise-up. While hazards exist for both systems, it must be emphasized that either sys- tem offers a significant overall safety benefit. CONCLUSIONS 1. Right front passengers should not be injured at barrier equivalent, frontal force collisions of at least 15 mph when wearing either the three or four point harness correctly. 2. The severity of impact to the passenger at 1 1 mph with muscles relaxed approaches that of the 15 mph impact with muscles tensed. 3. Shoulder belt loads are lower when "one fist" of slack is used, but due to the slackness, the upper torso impacts the shoulder harness, producing an uncomfortable whipping ac- tion of the head. 4. By bracing his legs against the floor pan, an occupant is able to reduce substantially the lap belt loads and forestall submarining at speeds up to at least 15 mph. 5. Due to the rigidity of the dummy's structure, belt loads for the dummy were higher than the corresponding loads for the volunteer or cadaver. 6. The 1 1 mph volunteer run with muscles initially relaxed produced approximately the same magnitude of resisting torque at the occipital condyles (26.2 ft-lb) as was produced in the 15 mph run where his neck muscles were initially tensed (26.4 and 27.2 ft-lb). All of the neck torques for the 1 1 and 15 mph runs were well below the injury threshold level of 66 ft-lb. 7. The dummy neck does not simulate the neck of the volunteer or the cadaver. Even when fully tightened, it does not offer sufficient resistance to rotation until it reaches the Fig. 18 - Oscillograph record and movie frames for run 12 with cadaver 1404 and three point system with an 1 1 in. inboard belt at 30 mph</page><page sequence="23">278 L. M. PATRICK AND K. R. TROSIEN end of travel, when the torque increases grossly, as evidenced by the high acceleration levels measured on the head. 8. Submarining did not occur with the volunteer with either the three or four point restraint system at 1 1 and 1 5 mph. However, submarining was imminent with the three point system at 1 5 mph. 9. The cadaver used in these runs was more prone to sub- marining than the dummy. 10. The Alderson VIP-50 dummy is a satisfactory device to use for determining whether or not submarining will occur, and is probably somewhat conservative. 1 1 . There is a greater tendency to submarine with a three point than with a four point system. 12. The length of the inboard tab in the three point system determines the tendency to submarine. A long tab causes both hips to submarine, whereas a short tab will only ride over the inboard hip in most instances. Submarining occurs at lower velocities with a long inboard belt. 13. When submarining occurred with both systems under identical conditions, belt loads produced by the four point system were higher than those produced by the three point system. 14. The movement of the four point system shoulder strap across the chest may cause neck and breast abrasion and may, to some extent, detract from the overall safety benefit of the system. REFERENCES 1.
