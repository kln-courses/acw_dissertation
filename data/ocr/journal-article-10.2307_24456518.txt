Being a Christian be- out working by and in the social order, comes as commonplace a fact as being This is another characteristic of the the son of one's parents. And just as world we live in. Now prayer, as every</page><page sequence="14">M CROSS CURRENTS one knows, is essentially a personal ac tivity. In it the soul is alone before its God. Necessarily prayer is valued too little by the modern mentality. No longer is the accent placed on the apos tle's personal sanctity; it is placed on his social qualities. No longer is it im portant to be as close as possible to God for Whom we work; it is important to be as close as possible to, and as often as possible with, our neighbor upon whom we work. Seen in this spiritual perspective, the time set aside for prayer seems a waste of time; activism engrosses our lives—and scatters them. The result is an emptying ourselves of God, a vacuum which condemns our apostolate to sterility. As long as an equilibrium is not struck between contemplation and the apostolate which should flow from it, prayer will not have its proper place in our religious lives as the ser vants and children of God. Conclusion In the course of these pages, we have seen prayer involved in two spiritual contexts: the religious life and the theo logical. We have seen that we are accus tomed by our Christian education and our religious experiences to identify these two spiritual contexts even though they are essentially different both in the doctrine they imply and the psychologi cal attitudes they suppose. By its very nature, the religious life is, in effect, a service; its involves an obligatory enlist ment by which the creature dedicates to God the worship due Him. In this en listment, God is absolute Lord, indis putable Master of everything man is and possesses; man is a serf, with all the kinds of dependence this idea implies. On the other hand, the life of the theo logical virtues is a life of contemplation and love. It is characterized—not by a master-slave relationship—but by the in timate and affectionate father-child re lationship. The functions of prayer, then, will normally differ as prayer is at the service of the life of the servant of God or as it manifests the activity of the child of God. This duality of function necessarily transforms the in terior structure of each of these prayers. For this reason our procedure has been to see what characterizes the roles of servant and child of God and the in dividual aspect they present to doctrinal reflection. On this basis we have tried to show the nature and properties of prayer as the activity respectively of the servant and the child of God. May the daily recitation of the Lord's Prayer be for each one of us the perfect integration of these two aspects of pray er in as much as it is the simultaneous expression of our service and our love of the Father Who is in heaven.
