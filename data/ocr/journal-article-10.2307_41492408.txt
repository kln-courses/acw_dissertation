SMITH ABSTRACT. - In the early Neolithic site of Ganj Dareh many of the clay cones have been deliberately modified by gashes stabbed into the plastic material. The purpose is unclear. The feature may be peculiar to this site. RÉSUMÉ. - Л Ganj Dareh, de nombreux cônes d'argile portent des entailles pratiquées délibérément. Leur signification reste ignorée; cette caractéristique pourrait être spécifique de ce site du Néolithique ancien. The purpose of this note is to call attention to an unusual type of Neolithic clay cone that occurs, to the best of our knowledge, only in the site of Ganj Dareh, Iran. This site is a small tepe or mound in the central Zagros mountains of western Iran, in the district of Bakhtran (formerly Kermanshah), near the ethnic boundary between Kurdistan and Luristan. It was excavated in four seasons between 1967 and 1974, and some preliminary reports have appeared (1). There is a sequence of five main occupation levels designated E to A, extending from about the mid-8th millennium (if not earlier) to the late 8th or early 7th millennia. It reveals early stages of plant (barley) cultivation and animal (goat) husbandry, although subsistence was still largely based on hunting and collecting (2). Because one of the levels (D) was burnt, it yields an unusually good picture of mud and brick architecture (3) and of other objects fas- hioned in clay such as cones, spheres, animal and anthropomorphic figurines, and small quantities of simple software pottery (4). The excavations produced 644 pieces that can be classed as cones, and of these 204 examples are modified in an unusual way. A gash had been stabbed into the plastic clay after the cone had been modelled. The gash itself was made with a narrow (2.5-3.0 mm) flat, reed-like object with a straight blunt end. This end was jabbed into the plastic clay starting at the top and continuing with overlapping jabs diagonally downward, or occasionally straight down (fig. le, le). The result is a series of step-like impressions. In the middle of these jabs the reed-like instrument was pushed from side to side to open up the gash being formed. On some pieces the gash has split the cone open, indicating that a certain amount of force was used (fig. lc, Id). Sometimes the slit was closed again by pressure of the fingers holding the still plastic clay. Some of the cones have tips that had been shaped by a vertical pinch or projection, thus creating what looks like a nose (fig. la, lb, Id). Where this "nose" is present, the gash had been made in the opposite surface of the body of the cone, i.e., on its "back". A rather interesting feature is that close exami- nation of the gashes shows which cones were jabbed by use of the right hand and which by the left. If the cone was held in the left hand and stabbed with an object held in the right hand, the gash slants from upper right to lower left and the finger pressure of the left hand caused the cone to tilt forward and to the right. The reverse is true for cases where the left hand was used to make the jabs. In the sample studied, right-handedness prevails. The close overlapping of the stab marks reflects considerable manual control as well as deliberate intent. The large number of examples of this particu- lar form at Ganj Dareh (almost one-third of the total cone sample) indicates that the practice had some specific meaning, although there is not at the moment any good explanation. The gashes do not occur on other artifacts so the meaning is specific to cones, whose meaning(s) are in turn unclear. We can speculate that the operation was meant to "re- lease" something inherent or immanent in the cone, or to intensify or amplify its original significance. These gashed cones have not been found in large concentrations in the site nor in recognizably special contexts. The senior author, who has studied most of the other collections of Neolithic clay cones in Near Eastern sites (5) has not observed any that 115 (1) SMITH, 1976, 1978, 1983.

This may reflect a very localized form of behaviour at the site, which has also produced several other appa- rently unique artifact types in clay and bone.
