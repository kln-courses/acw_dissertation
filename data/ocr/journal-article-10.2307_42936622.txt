<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON SCIENCE BASHING: A BASHFUL ARCHAEOLOGIST SPEAKS OUT LEWIS R. BINFORD An alarming amount of the literature in archaeology today seeks to discredit methods for learning.1 This increase in anti -science posturing arises from the humanistic position that humankind is unique and must be understood in terms of the familiar "essential properties" of humans themselves. Those who seek explanations for human behavior, the products of behavior, and variability in organized life, in terms other than the familiar, understood properties of humankind, are said to be misguided. Thus the humanistic view is elevated rhetorically to a position of "realism". Scientists are characterized as "unrealistic," and the scientific approach to learning is generally attributed either to foolishness, reinforced by a naive acceptance of an unrealistic view of man, or to self-interest, driven by hidden agendas that seek to dupe the masses in order to attain power or in pursuit of other questionable goals. My work is not an uncommon target of persons with these views. For instance, we have been recently told: "...in parallel with the postwar public service ethic there expanded an all-embracing positivism, which culminated in a proliferation of dehumanising approaches both in public life and the educational world, and such as were highly suited to statistical and computer manipulation... Archaeology adopted these late in the 60's and 70's as part of the more complex package of the New Archaeology. Characteristic features were mechanistic or deterministic models... and the use of a Systems Theory perspective ... Likewise emanating from the optimistic planning perspective for a renovated Western World arose the belief that the sciences of Man could discover and operationalize the general principles of human society, past, present and future" (Bintliff 1988:12). Many analogous arguments can be found in the current literature. Several authors attribute the developments called here the "New Archaeology" to the Vietnam War and its pervasive ideology of confrontation and dissent. The New Archaeology has been depicted as a kind of adolescent temper tantrum, which can therefore be dismissed (Lamberg-Karlovsky 1989:4). Humanists support their claim that "Science is not above culture" with boring demonstration that Darwin was a product of his times, or that there is a coincidence between the frequency of ecological explanations for the patterning seen in Maya archaeology and such events as Earth Day and the passage of the Marine Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, etc. (Wilks 1985). Of course, such work supports the popular view enunciated by Leach (1984:3): "Academic anthropology has developed as a consequence of the interaction of prominent individual scholars and the cross-fertilization of their leading ideas. But these "prominent individual scholars" were ordinary human beings who had private as well as public life histories. Whatever they did or said as anthropologists was simply a "structural/ metaphoric transformation" of what they did</page><page sequence="2">330 Bulletin of the Deccarì College 60-61 (2000-2001) and said in quite nonanthropological contexts." Put in simple terms, science is a sham. Scientists are both self-deceiving and misleading to mankind. No special credence should be placed on their knowledge claims-they are just ordinary people, like you and me. Let us examine some of these claims. Suppose we claim that science is a learning strategy and that it faces the difficult task of evaluating the accuracy and utility of our ideas (Binford 1976). If this claim is accurate, why should we be surprised when scientists turn their attention to evaluating the ideas of and for their own time? What other ideas could they profitably evaluate? Certainly that is what I was doing in the early 1960s. I was evaluating the accuracy and utility for learning of the ideas that I had been taught as a student of anthropology (see Binford 1989). Why then all the fuss about scientists being products of their times? A hidden agenda is supposedly at work here -the issue of motive. If the motives of scientists are conmonplace and represent a kind of adolescent temper tantrum, then the product, the producer, and the ideas involved can simply be dismissed as unworthy. Why do the science bashers operate with all the worst kinds of argument, for instance (a) ad hominem (arguments against the person, not the ideas), (b) strawman arguments against positions not advocated, (c) ad ignorantium (arguments that appeal to the ignorance of the audience), and (d) moral value judgements regarding the terrible consequences of listening to scientists. Using these types of arguments, humanists attempt to demonstrate that scientists are simply people like all others, expressing their personal opinions on the issues of their times. Implicit is the suggestion that knowledge claims offered with reference to learning strategies, such as scientific methods, are totally unconvincing. Why? Because for the humanists such arguments fly in the face of truths accepted as "realistic." Why should anyone argue against such clear, unambiguous, and self-evident truths? There must be a reason and it must rest with motive. According to humanists, any person who follows the unrealistic program of science must be either a rational person who has very specific goals or a very silly person who is having a temper tantrum. This conclusion is the purest form of ad hominem argument, which as we all know is a fallacy in logic and represents a failure to deal with the issues germane to the argument. Is this criticism accurate, however? What if the argument asserts that there are no germane issues other than those of the personal and character-based, self-interest-driven motives of the actors? Under this law-like proposition, all arguments must be ad hominem in character and therefore meet the test of being germane! For purpose of demonstration let us accept this law-like proposition and see where it takes us. What if the personal and character-based interests of a given actor were simply to gain a knowledge and understanding of experiences in the external world? What germane issues of relevant ad hominem arguments would then be introduced by the committed humanist? Clearly, the humanist would point to the flaws in the person's ability to recognize self-evident truths. Only a fool could not recognize "true" self-evident knowledge! We are forced at this point, however, to be quite curious about the source of the knowledge claimed by humanists. Where does their self-evident knowledge come from? If I begin my search for knowledge not with the external world but, instead, with my inner, subjective view of experience, there is simply no way another person can challenge and sustain a case that such alleged knowledge</page><page sequence="3">On Science Bashing : A Bashful Archaeologist Speaks Out 331 is faulty. Proceeding in this manner, what can I say with certainty? I think; I construct models of reality; I partition experience cognitively; I cause things to happen; I have goals; I have moral responsibility; I have beliefs. Now, on further reflection, I might argue that it is my volitional actions executed in terms of my goals, which in turn are conditioned by my beliefs that cause things to happen in the external world. It should be emphasized that there are many ways of constructing antithetical positions from these ontological principles. Is this exercise a search for understanding? Does it seek to understand the external world of experience in terms of itself? Although the answer to this question is actually "no," the person conducting the preceding introspective exercise would, of course, answer "yes," along with Collingwood (1946) and most other historians, as well as many anthropologists. For these people, experiences in the external world are assumed to be caused by human beings themselves as a consequence of their essential properties. Let us explore this introspective approach further. Suppose we introduce another person, let us say someone from another culture. We can now extend our concept of self-knowledge to them. If I talk with them, or observe their behavior, I may note that they do not behave as I do. We might engage in "dialogic learning" (Päge 1988) to gain some intersubjective understanding of the differences in our concepts of moral responsibility or our goals. I may discover that I do not share this other person's ideas of morality and perhaps I do not empathize with his goals. I am puzzled! A different subjectivity is staring me in the face! Now, being introspective, I might turn for help to my list of ontological assumptions about myself and about the world of experience. I think, I construct models, I partition experience cognitively, I cause things to happen, I have goals, I have a sense of moral responsibility, I have beliefs. How can I understand this other person? Being liberal, I extend to their subjectivity all the essential properties of my own. Then how can we be different? If I construct models and partition experience cognitively, then this other person does so also. Suppose others do it volitionally but their way is different from mine. This is one possible source of our failure to be alike. If the way* in which we partition experience conditions our beliefs about the world of experience, then our beliefs could be different. Because these beliefs condition both the character of moral responsibility and the character of our goals, the causes of the differences must therefore rest with our different beliefs and our different cognitive devices. In turn, because it is individuals who cause things to happen, any two people will cause different things to happen: we see the world differently and our behaviors and actions will therefore appear different. At last we have an accommodation! My narcissistic thoughts provide a self-evident frame of reference for apprehending everything beyond my subjective self. The big 7" has proven its worth; I can share an identity with others. I can approach others with the hope of gaining an inter-human understanding. Once this conclusion is reached, a variety of paths can be followed in arguments about these wonderful insights. I can declare, for example, that since moral responsibility is one of my essential characteristics, I should not judge other human expressions-I could become a devoted cultural relativist. Or, appealing to the same essential characteristic, my moral responsibility, I could argue that it is my responsibility to judge the worth of other cultural forms in terms of their contributions to the overall welfare of humankind, which is the position taken in most of the recent science -bashing literature. Clearly, appeals to the essential characteristics of the human identity can result in totally opposite</page><page sequence="4">332 Bulletin of the Deccarì College 60-61 (2000-2001) outcomes that are equally referable to the same "cause." Still other arguments are consistent with this observation. For example, since volition is my active essential characteristic, and since I acknowledge this characteristic as present in others, any attempt to explain variability among humans is foolish. We have already decided that variation is not caused by characteristics in the external world but is the result of free will and volitional behavior. All we should attempt are "thick descriptions" or other types of translations for purposes of understanding others. As this approach plays out the potential for publication is endless. The fact that we can think this way is not at issue. Nor is the truth of the ontological assumptions about ourselves necessarily at issue. What is at issue concerns what we as anthropologists are trying to do. What strategies result in the growth of knowledge and which procedures for learning are productive? If our goal is to increase our knowledge and our ability to explain the world of experience, we may reasonably question the utility of accommodating all of the staggeringly varied experiences we might have to our characterizations of self. The essential characteristics used by humanists to understand the world are so vague and ambiguous, any experience could be accommodated to such beliefs. This very point was the locus of concern at the dawn of what we today call science. At that time the philosophers/scientists were concerned with accepting a priori , theistic, essential characteristics as causes. Humanism today takes as essential causal conditions the self-explanatory properties of ourselves. It is a commitment to anthropocentrism, a view that Gellner (1974:102) has termed "naive familiarism." The preceding discussion of science and humanism has focused on major differences seated in ontological issues and, importantly, in the role ontological assumptions play in the learning process. From a scientific perspective one must ask if the ontological locus of cause must be determined before new knowledge can be sought. The answer is a resounding "No." Do we have to decide the truth of the proposition that, for example, "the social relationships of production" are the cause of differing social formations, before we can outline a procedure for learning? The answer is again "No." One of the central issues that scientific procedures can help us to explicate is related to our reasonable uncertainty regarding cause, and in turn the evaluation of arguments advanced on this issue. One of the most important historical trajectories of knowledge growth, has resulted from the scientific investigations of alternative arguments regarding the character and identity of "causes." This exploration has been upsetting to humanists. Gellner has summarized the situation as follows: "What is at issue is the human vision of man, the defence of anthropomorphism in human studies. 'The proper study of mankind' is no longer at issue; what is at issue is the style of explanation, not the choice of area for investigation" (Gellner 1974:100-101). In short, if humanness is not self-explanatory, then humanity, like the rest of nature, is controlled or at least contingently conditioned by external variables, and we are not uniquely in the driver's seat. The conflict between humanism and science has been summarized as "the incompatibility of cognition and identity.... The price of genuine, powerful, technologically enriching science is that its style of explanation ruthlessly destroys those very notions in terms of which we identify ourselves... The salient feature of scientific knowledge is that its explanatory schemata are impersonal, indifferent to</page><page sequence="5">On Science Bashing : A Bashful Archaeologist Speaks Out 333 idiosyncracy and identity, and articulated in terms which are socially and morally blind" (Gellner 1974:101). Scientific explanations are about the world we live in, not simply descriptive renderings of the world in terms of our notions of our identity. Theories are about mechanism, advanced by us, and if useful, they lay out impersonal causal relationships among variables, which permit an explanatory understanding and an ability to anticipate experience accurately. Even though humankind may be characterized by volitional ability, this characteristic is not self- explanatory-it is not part of an explanation at all. If accepted, it is simply held constant as a characteristic of humans, and constants neuer explain variability. In stark contrast, dynamics are imagined by some as being seated in different subjectivities (individuals). When these individuals interact, a dialectical dynamic results from the playing out of self-interests in different, unique contexts. Again, this dialectic is not an explanation, only an accommodation of experience to prior belief. Both of these arguments maintain that regardless of what directions human history might take, the results are uniformly referable to essential human characteristics. With such approaches, no learning can take place. We can only be proud or sad, admiring or surprised. We can glory in our identity and in our belief that we are in the driver's seat, but we can never explain our condition or our history. Modern science works differently. It takes the perspective that causes are postulated by us. It seeks to avoid ontological assumptions as fundamental building blocks of theory. It accepts as its responsibility the production of explanations for observations that have been made. In a strict sense, any ontological assertions made by scientists are about learning strategies, not about the subject matter being investigated. Science postulates mechanisms and interactive dynamics that operate causally in the world of experience. As a by-product of its causal arguments, science requires that we be able to anticipate accurately observations not yet made. Those who are committed to understanding the world by listing and defining self-evident ontological truths believe that all of these explanations, postulations, and predictions are impossible. To them, modern science sounds like a false world naively constructed without regard for the great truths they hold-those self-evident truths about human nature that were outlined previously (see Hexter 1971). This same response was played out in the seventeenth century by those who claimed that self-evident great truths grounded, a priori , their views of experience. Today we see this conviction in the statements of creationists or adherents to other positions grounded in faith. (The word faith is used here to refer to any argument in which the truth of a proposition is accepted as self-evident.) I started this essay with a question about science bashing. Why are scientists and their products evaluated in ad hominem terms or with other fallacious arguments? Why are scientists said to be dupes of governments, economic systems, or social class values? Why must Darwin be dismissed because he was a product of his times? Why am I a duped tool of the rebellious Vietnam War era? The answer is inherent in the metaphysical postures adopted by those who make such claims. The very fact that I am upset, that scientists are disgusted with humanist claims and that we have chosen to answer back in this symposium is a case in point. This response can, of course, be accommodated to the humanist position. We may be dismissed because supposedly we are simply engaged in the expected dialectical process of differential commitment of varying self-interests! The issue, however, is not so</page><page sequence="6">334 Bulletin of the Deccan College 60-61 (2000-2001) easily and superficially treated. I am primarily upset because the humanist characterizations of me, my work, my very professional existence is misrepresented, distorted, and simply wrong. I represent a human being who is outraged by the humanists' claim that they accurately or even vaguely understand my work, the issues involved, the scientific approach in general, and the actions of other scientists. If they give priority to self-knowledge, I also can at least claim to be an authority on myself and to charge that they are wrong in what they say. Yet, in the face of their failure to understand my "subjectivity," their procedures are boldly advanced as the true way to know the past, to understand history, and to penetrate the reality of persons living in different cultures. In the science-bashing literature, objections such as those that will arise in today's symposium may be dismissed as examples of "masking" tactics, demonstrations of a lack of self-knowledge, or simply evidence of bad motives. But how is it possible to self-knowledge as the basis for general understanding and at the same time to deny this approach to others? Humanists are committed to the defense of their chosen identity. Their methods are vacuous and their attempts at learning pathetic. When challenged, their only recourse is to ad hominem argument. In defense of their identity, they must insist that others' self-knowledge is false. Those who do not share their privileged knowledge are to be understood as defective persons, persons blinded to the truth, or persons who deny the truth in order to pursue dubious social goals. Clearly, then, as any inquisitor of the sixteenth century would have known, the job of the righteous is to expose the non-believers. Critical theory and deconstruction are the means, and exposing the "fifth column" in our midst through ad hominem argument is the duty of the righteous humanists. Science is not committed to the defense of "identity." It seeks knowledge and the ability to explain experience. It seeks to explain the variability in what is observed. This ability is not grounded in the belief that all people are like me. Instead it Is grounded in the proposition that what is considered to be interesting derives from a reasonable consistency in observation (by observers collectively considered). The task of the scientist is to explain these collective observations with reference to the processes that condition the dynamics in the world of experience. In turn, explanations can be evaluated through other public experiences. Science is skeptical of all claims for self-evident truth, and it is generally skeptical of knowledge claims of all kinds. As Feynman has summed up the situation, "If we... (proclaim) This is the answer, my friends; man is saved!' we will doom humanity for a long time to the chains of authority, confined to the limits of our present imagination. It has been done so many times before. It is our responsibility as scientists, knowing the great progress which comes from a satisfactory philosophy of ignorance... to teach how doubt is not to be feared but welcomed and to demand this freedom as our duty to all coming generations" (Feynman 1988:24s).1 Notes 1.
