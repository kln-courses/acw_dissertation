Snyder Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan ABSTRACT The importance of crash-worthiness and the role of restraint systems in occupant impact protection in U.S. civil aircraft design is being increasingly recognized. Current esti- mates of the number of fatalities which could be prevented annually in survivable accidents range from 33 to 9^%» This study reviews the development of existing Federal Aviation Ad- ministration restraint system standards from the first requirement for safety belts in the Air Commerce Regulations of 1926 to present Ik CFR 1.1. The FAA and industry standards are critically evaluated for Parts 23 (small airplanes), 25 (air transports), 27 (rotor- craft), and 29 (transport category rotorcraft). State-of-the-art developments, including an overview of previous accident experience, re- sults of experimental studies, comparison with other standards, and primary data sources are provided. It is concluded that both FAA standards and manufacturers restraint protec- tion in most U.S. civil aircraft are far below that presently provided by other federal standards or available in state-of-the-art technology. 635 0096-736X/78/8601 -0635$02.50 Copyright © 1978 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">636 R. G. SNYDER THE INCREASING RECOGNITION of the importance of crashworthiness in civil aircraft design and regulation has resulted in a greater empha- sis in research and development in occupant restraint systems. There is now an overwhel- ming "body of data documenting much earlier findings that the single best crash protection for any vehicle occupant is an adequate res- traint system. This has already influenced more advanced requirements in both military aircraft and automotive vehicles. Indications of the substantial effort that has been going into improved restraint system research and development may be observed in numerous areas. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the Department of Transportation has required upper torso re- straint in automobiles manufactured for sale in the U.S. since 1 January 1968,(1)* and dur- ing the past five years has funded over $10,000,000 in restraint system research. (2) The automotive industry has similarly invested significant efforts over the past two decades in restraint development, especially in infla- table passive restraint devices. The military services have had continuous programs in de- velopment of improved restraint systems for over three decades. Due to new data developed since its last revision in 1971» the Army is initiating another revision of its "Crash- worthy Survival Design Guide," (3) which has roots evolving from the 1956 Cornell Aviation Crash Injury Research Guide. (h) This provides advanced restraint design information for both rotorcraft and light fixed wing aircraft. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has simi- larly evolved several revisions of its Crash- worthiness Design Guide from 196k to 1973.(5» 6,7) More recently, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the FAA have launched a joint crashworthiness program aimed to contribute additional restraint infor- mation relative to current light aircraft occu- pant protection performance, ( 8-10 ) while the Civil Aeromedicai Institute of the FAA has con- tinually published results of restraint studies since 1960.(ll) There now is a massive body of literature: The joint FAA-USAF literature study of 1962-65 cited 3872 studies and refer- ences in restraint systems alone, (12,13) and the NHTSA library presently includes over 2200 *Numbers in parenthesis designate references at end of paper. references, mainly for the period 1967-1975. The objectivé of this paper is to bring together selected data to provide an overview of where we stand relative to the state-of-the- art in civil aviation restraint systems and pro- vide basic source data for the design engineers, researchers, and other users which has not pre- viously been found in any single source. Em- , phasis will primarily be in the area of stan- dards, accident experience, and the findings of experimental studies, with references provided relative to more detailed sources for testing techniques, materials, or other technical as- pects . APPLICABLE FAA STANDARDS Civil aircraft manufactured for sale and operation in the United States under a U.S. Standard Airworthiness Certificate must comply with applicable requirements of the Federal Aviation Regulations in effect at the time of manufacture. The current regulations (March, 1977) relate to those in effect on March 30, 1967» as supplemented or modified in sections k through 10. The most recent requirements are found in Code of Federal Regulations ( lU CFR l.l), Aeronautics and Space, Parts 1 to 59» re- vised as of January 1, 1977.(1*0 The appli- cable parts are found in Part 23 (airworthiness standards: normal, utility and acrobatic cate- gory airplanes) which applies to small airplanes having a passenger seating configuration, ex- cluding pilot seats, of nine seats or less, Part 25 (airworthiness standards: normal cate- gory air transport), Part 27 (airworthiness standards : normal category rotorcraft ) , and Part 29 (airworthiness standards: transport category rotorcraft). Within each category of airplane and ro- torcraft there are several specific sections of the Federal Aviation Regulations which state restraint system requirements for the certi- fication of aircraft. The principal require- ments related to aircraft restraint systems are found in Parts 23, 25, 27, 29:561 providing emergency landing conditions; section .625 for fitting factors; section .1Ú13 and .785 relating to safety belts and harnesses, and in. Part 37. .132, TS0-C22f (safety belts ). TS0-C22f in turn relies upon National Aircraft Standard Speci- fication (NAS) 802 (195O) for applicable belt standards .( 15) Appendix A provides current FAA</page><page sequence="3">RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 637 standards . Additional regulations related to seats, but which may also be pertinent to restraint systems include Part 37 «135 (TSO-C25a) for aircraft with type certificate prior to March 5, 1952; and Part 37 .136 (TSO-C39a) for aircraft having type certificates after March 5» 1952. In turn, TSO-C25a sind TSO-C39a refer to National Aircraft Standard Specification (NAS) 8o6 (re- vised January 1, 1956), (l6) or (NAS) 809 (Janu- ary 1, 1956). (IT) DEVELOPMENT OF FAA STANDARDS To most clearly understand the evolution of the present Federal Air Regulations related to aircraft restraint systems and in regard to their relationship to state-of-the-art tech- nology, a brief history of the regulations will be outlined. This will be followed by a com- parison of comparable standards required for military aircraft, automotive vehicles, by other countries, and by other technical stan- dards organizations. The first Air Commerce Regulations became effective December 31» 1926. These initial regulations of the Department of Commerce were contained in a booklet of U 5 pages which mea- sured only U by 7 inches. From the outset, safety belts were included. Section 15» en- titled "Required Equipment and Instruments" , paragraph 3. A required "safety belts or equiva- lent apparatus for pilots and passengers in open-cockpit airplanes carrying passengers for hire or reward. "(l8) At this time the U.S. was far behind many other countries in commercial aviation. As early as 1913 Russia's Sikorsky had built a U-engine airliner with enclosed cockpit and cabin, room for 2 pilots and U passengers, with k seats, a sofa and table, and equipped with electric lights and a washroom. Sikorsky1 s Ilia Mourometz carried l6 passengers in 191^(19) and some 70 aircraft, of this type were built. (20) Britain and France were operating sched- uled flights between London and Paris, and the Fokker F-II Air Transport went into service with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in April, 1920. By 1923, when the U.S. lacked even a single airline, Britain was flying 30 scheduled flights a day across the channel in aircraft featuring upholstered chairs. The U.S. "air- line" of 1926, in comparison, consisted of con- verted WWI DH-U observation planes designed to carry mail, rather than people, and often passengers found themselves riding on top of mail sacks (with goggles, helmets, windjackets, and hot water bottles provided by the operator). By 1925» 31 of the first ho pilots hired by the U.S. Post Office Department six years earlier had been killed in crashes. In 1931 the fata- lity rate for passengers was nearly 15 deaths per 100 million passenger miles. (21) Prior to 1929 there were no specific strength requirements. Aeronautics Bulletin 7A, effective July 1, 1929, first required res- traint strength standards. This consisted of the addition: "Safety belts or equivalent for pilots and passengers in all airplanes (are required) . Seats or chairs in cabin planes shall be firmly secured in place. Safety belts and their attachments shall be capable of with- standing a load of 1,000 pounds applied in the same manner as a passenger's weight would be applied in a crash. The attachment shall be such as to be capable of carrying this load through to the main structure. "( 22) The next change occurred five years later and was introduced in Aeronautics Bulletin 7A as amended October 1, I93U. At this time it was required that a design load of 1,000 pounds per person should be applied upward and forward at an angle of approximately U50 with the floor line (Sec. 60, p. h3) . The Air Commerce Regu- lations at this time published the first opera- ting requirement, requiring that an individual safety belt be provided for each passenger .( 23) Due to the growth of aviation, the inade- quacy of the Air Commerce Act of I926 became apparent, and in 1938 Congress passed the Civil Aeronautics Act. (2*0 This granted much broader authority to the Administration to regulate safety and design standards, and also created an Air Safety Board to enforce safety standards for air commerce and manufacture. Standards were established for certification of aircraft and components at the design, production, and flight stages. Air transport aircraft manufactured on or after January 1, 1951 were required to be equipped with safety belts approved in accor- dance with CAR Ua.31, considering ultimate load factors specified in CAR Ua.193, of 2 g upward, 6 g forward, and I.5 g sideward (Amendment Ua- U*, 15 F.R. 29, January 6, 1950). The ultimate accelerations assumed in light aircraft at this time in normal category were 3 g upward, 9 g forward, and 1.5 g sideward (CAR 3.386 Protec-</page><page sequence="4">638 R. G. SNYDER tìon) (25 ,26) In 1958 comprehensive changes resulted from the Federal Aviation Act of 1958.(27,28) This act established the Federal Aviation Agency, headed by an administrator, and continued the Civil Aeronautics Board. The Civil Air Regulations were again re- vised effective January 1, 19 6l, however; CAR 3.386 remained the same as specified in the Civil Aeronautics Administration, U.S. Depart- ment of Commerce, Civil Aeronautics Manual 3 of March 8, 1950. This stated that, "The fuse- lage shall be designed to give reasonable assu- rance that each occupant, if he makes proper use of belts or harness for which provisions are made in the design, will not suffer serious injury during minor crash conditions as a re- sult of contact of any vulnerable part of his body with any penetrating or relatively solid object, although it is accepted that parts of the airplane may be damaged ."( 27 ) In addition, the ultimate accelerations to which occupants were assumed to be subjected for normal cate- gory aircraft were 3.0 g upward, 9*0 g forward, and 1.5 g sideward. Both the I95O (CAA) and I96I (FAA) ver- sions of this part included a Part 3.386-1 "crash protection (FAA interpretations which apply to 3.386)," which is provided in Appen- dix B.(27) In the interpretations provided by the FAA in relation to restraints it was pointed out (b) (2), "The torso is rarely exposed to dangerous injury when the safety belts hold and control wheels provide reasonable support for the chest. "(27) Four points of general signi- ficance were followed by a list of eight "typi- cal injurious objects. " Paragraph 7 notes :"In personal aircraft every consideration should be given to holding the body by adequate safety belt installations, and by the support which can be provided in control wheels and instrument panels. The present "1000 pound" safety belts have failed in a high percentage of accidents without causing internal injuries or bruising of the hips. In failing, they have exposed the pilot to excessive injuries ."( 28) Seat strength,, installation, and testing requirements were con- tained in 3.39O-I, -2, (29) and 3, (30). Proof of compliance could be shown by structural analysis alone; a combination of structural analysis and static load tests to limit loads; or, static load test alone when such tests are carried to ultimate loads. TSO C-25 (section 51^.25) provided methods for seat tests accept- able for certification by the FAA. (l6) On September 28, I96U Part 3 of the Civil Air Regulations was replaced by a Part 23 (new). The sections were re-numbered and arranged to be comparable to Part 25 (new), 27 (new), and 29 (new). The word "must" was substituted for "shall", to reflect the fact that airworthiness standards are conditions required for the issu- ance of a type certificate. However, most changes were of a minor "technical clarifying nature" rather than substantive. ( 31) Thus in I96U CAM 3.386 (protection) became the revised FAR 23.561, and CAM 3.390 (seats and belts) be- came the revised FAR 23.785, while CAM Ua.565 (safety belts) became 25.1^13. Part 23.625 (fitting factors) also required that seat, berth., safety belt, and harness show by analysis, tests or both, to be able to withstand the inertia forces prescribed in 23.561 multiplied by a fitting factor of 1. 33. ( CAR-KJAM*FAR 23) When the U.S. Department of Transportation was created by Congressional action in I966, the Federal Aviation Agency was placed within the Department under the jurisdiction of the Secre- tary. A brief review of impact of Congressional action upon aviation regulation and effects on the engineer and manufacturer has been provided by Johnston (33), and a review of FAA experience has been provided by Paullin and Heyl (3*0, in previous SAE papers. Since 1969 several additional proposals have been made to change standards relative to occupant restraint and protection. In I969 the FAA proposed that Part 23 be further amended for small airplane type certification, proposing that 23.625, 23.785, and 23.IU13 be consolidated to place seat, berth, and belt attachment factors all in one section, "and to require the installa- tion of effective upper body restraints (harness- es) , or the airplane interior to be designed either to eliminate injurious objects within striking radius of the head or to provide energy absorbing support for the upper torso". (35) These amendments reflected comments from a notice of proposed rulemaking (KPEM) listed in the Fede- ral Register (32 FR 5791) on April 11, 1967 and circulated as notice 67-lk. A rule requiring every occupant flying on a U.S. registered civil aircraft to fasten safety belts during takeoff and landing was adopted by the FAA effective August 30, 1971. Although the installation of seat belts had been required since 1926 (l8), except for commercial opera- tors of large aircraft and air carriers,</page><page sequence="5">RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 639 there had been no legal requirement to use the seat belt. The specific rule, as applied over 130,000 civil aircraft (in 1971) in non-air- line operation, states, "During the take-off and landing of a U.S. registered civil aircraft (except airships), each person on board that aircraft must occupy a seat or berth, with a safety belt properly secured about him. How- ever, a person who has not reached his second birthday may be held by an adult who is occu- pying a seat or berth, and a person on board for the purpose of engaging in sport parachuting may use the floor of the aircraft as a seat." (37) In 1973 the FAA circulated a NPRM, "Crash- worthiness for Small Airplanes", which included proposals to amend Part 23 to require the in- stallation of shoulder harnesses, and to require manufacturers to provide shoulder harness attachment points on airplanes being constructed under existing type certificates so that air- planes manufactured after the effective date of this amendment could be equipped with shoulder harnesses. ( 38) Part 91 (91.33 and 91.39) would be amended to prohibit, 1 year after the effec- tive date of this proposed amendment, the operation of such aircraft without an approved shoulder harness for each occupant (except rear facing). Part 91.7 and 91.1^ would be amended to require each occupant of a seat equipped with a shoulder harness to fasten it during takeoff and landing. These 1973 proposed changes are provided in Appendix C. After h years review (Jan 1973-Jan 1977)» however, there has been no further action on these or the 1969 proposals. Current FAA requirements related to restraint systems are listed in Appendix C. Current FAA standards applicable to re- straint systems are summarized as follows: 1. Emergency Landing Conditions. The structure must be designed to protect each occupant and give each occupant "every reasonable chance of escaping serious injury in a minor crash land- ing when proper use is made of seats, belts... and the occupant experiences the following ultimate inertia forces"(lU).

" 2. 37.122 Safety Belts TS0-C22f ( lU) . Belts manufactured on or after May 1, 1972 must meet National Aircraft Standards (NAS) specification 802 revised May 15, 1950(15) except that the rated strengths specified for the belt assembly (Ul.1.1. of NAS 802) shall be 1,500 pounds (single occupancy) and 3,000 lbs. (double occu- pancy) instead of 3,000 and 6,000 lbs. The belt width shall not be less than 2 inches. NAS 802 defines the minimum performance and safety standards for aircraft safety belts to be in- stalled in certified aircraft and covers all types of safety belts for civil aircraft use. It reflects the judgment of the National Air- craft Standards Committee of the Aircraft Industries Association of America. The latest revision is dated 15 May 1950. 3. Seats and Berths. Current requirements are found in Part 23, 25, 27, or 29.785, and pro- vided in Appendix C, with Part 25 . 785, related to air transport aircraft, the most extensive; Part 27.785 , related to normal category heli- copters, the briefest. Part 23.785 requires seats to be designed for I70 lbs. occupants in normal category small airplanes, and for emer- gency landing conditions prescribed in 23.561. Each occupant must be protected from head in- jury by (g), (l) a safety belt and shoulder har- ness that will prevent the head from contacting any injurious object; or (2) a safety belt plus</page><page sequence="6">640 R. G. SNYDER the elimination of any injurious object within striking distance of the head; or (3) a safety belt plus an energy absorbing rest that will support the arms , shoulders , head and spine . Thus, two alternatives to a shoulder harness are allowed for newly certified aircraft under Part 23.561 and also apply to air transports (25.561) and air transport category helicopters (29.T85), but not to normal category helicop- ters (27. 785). ( lU) h. Safety Belts and Harnesses. Specified in section . 1Í13 of the FARłs, the rated strength of safety belts and harnesses may not be less than that corresponding with the ultimate load factors specified in section 23-561 (b). In addition, Part 25.1^13 also requires each belt to be attached so that no part of the anchorage can fail at a lower load than specified in 25.561, multiplied by a factor of 1.33 (rather than the fitting factor prescribed in 25.625). The requirements for air transport helicopters state only, "if there are means to indicate to the passengers when safety belts should be fastened, they must be installed to be operated from either pilot seat. "(li) Current require- ments are provided in Appendix C. 5. Fitting Factor. Part 23.625 for small air- planes requires seats, safety belts, and har- ness attachments to be able to withstand the inertia forces prescribed in 23.561, multiplied by a fitting factor of 1.33 (e.g. h g upward, 12 g forward, and 2 g sideward), as does Part 25 for air transports 25.785 (i) and 25.1Í13 (c). However, fitting factors for helicopters are not specified for seats or restraints direc- tly.CU) AIRCREW RESTRAINT STANDARDS Each crew member seat at flight deck sta- tions must have provisions for a shoulder har- ness (FAR 25.785g) which must be worn during takeoff and landing unless the wearing inter- feres with crew member function (Part 121.31). Investigation of the United Boeing 727 crash at Chicago O'Hare on 21 March I968 revealed that the "crewmembers1 cuts, bruises, and back in- juries were received as a result of their being violently tossed around inside the cockpit by the crash impact" and prompted the NTSB to recommend (28 January I969, Not. I87, 69-27) to the FAA that shoulder harnesses be required for aircrew during takeoff and landings ( 39) . Responding to the NTSB on 17 March I969, the FAA issued NPRM 69-33, amending Part 121, 31l('ô) to propose that shoulder harnesses be worn during takeoff and landing. On 12 August 1969 this requirement was subsequently adopted. However, as a result of lack of shoulder har- nesses being worn during the United Boeing 737 crash at Midway on 8 December 1972; in the North Central McDonnell Douglas DC-9 crash at O'Hare on 20 December 1972; and in the Eastern Lockheed L-1011 crash at Miami on 29 December I972, the NTSB again recommended to the FAA (39) that all air carrier checklists contain a "fasten shoulder harness" item. The FAA res- ponded (A-73-39) on l6 July 1973 by revising Air Carrier Operations Bulletin No. 69-21 to suggest that "fasten shoulder harnesses" be made a standard item. At that time it was also recommended by NTSB that FAA amend li CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 25.785(h) to require provisions for a shoulder harness at each cabin attendant seat, and amend li CFR 121.321 to require that shoul- der harnesses be installed at each cabin attendant seat. Some 30 years had elapsed from the first NTSB/CAB recommendation (No. 32-0-38) for FAA to require crew upper torso restraints (iO). On 29 January 1973(39) NTSB pointed out to FAA further inconsistencies relative to shoulder harnesses: "Under part 121, the degree of protection afforded crewmembers flying air- craft certified before January 1, 1958, is less than that provided in more recently certified aircraft, where registered multi-engine air carrier airplanes still in service were certi- fied prior to January 1, 1958. One of the air- planes in this category, a Mohawk FH-227, crashed in Albany, New York, on March 3, 1972 killing li passengers and% the two crewmembers on the flight deck. This aircraft, although manufactured in 1967, "was type certified prior to 1958 and thus exempted from the shoulder har- ness equipment. Investigation disclosed that the Captain and the copilot might have survived the accident had they worn shoulder harnesses" [NTSB Not. 1+07, CY 7O-U2, I/29/7O] ( 39, ^1) . As a result of two FH-227 accidents and a Lear Jet accident, NTSB Safety Recommendations A-73-105 and 106 were issued October 25, 1973 recommen- ding that a shoulder harness be made mandatory on transport aircraft certified prior to 1958 and on large corporate and executive aircraft.</page><page sequence="7">RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 641 Fig. 1 - Cabin attendants1 restraint system in current air carrier operation, using fold-down rear-facing seat with upper torso restraint. RELATED STANDARDS In order to assess the current state-of- the art in restraint relative to civil air- craft it is also necessary to compare related standards with the applicable FAA airworthiness standards outlined in the preceding section. Requirements for military aircraft restraint systems undoubtedly , except for space craft, are the most stringent; however, the army operates many rotorcraft and light fixed-wing aircraft which have civil counterparts. There are also some differences in requirements in foreign countries which apply to U.S. aircraft exported pr licensed for operation in other countries. Guidance has also been available by reference to the SAE Aerospace Recommended Practices (ARP's), whose purpose is to provide recommendations representative of experts in the area from in- dustry, government, operators, and the research community. Such recommendations usually do not represent the optimum but take into considera- tion the most reasonable compromise between different viewpoints. Since review is often continuous, revisions serve to often keep the ARP more representative of the state-of-the-art than the FAR's. It was previously noted that the FAA re- quirements for occupant restraint protection in both air transport (Part 25) and general avia- tion (Part 23) aircraft have not changed significantly since the CAA first issued such requirements for certification, TS0-22f strength requirements being last upgraded (NAS 802) in I95O. However, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)(39) and the FAA Office of Aviation Medicine (OAM) have strongly recommen- ded increased occupant impact protection design criteria and especially seat/belt strength re- quirements on a number of occasions over the past decade. In response to the FAA Flight Standards Service NPRM 69-33 in I969 (1+2) the Office of Aviation Medicine prepared consider- able documentation to substantiate their recom- mendations that Part 25.561 requirements be in- creased significantly ( U3 , UU ) . Earlier I967 recommendations by Turnbow, et. al., based upon extensive crash testing experience conducted for the Army also would increase the recommended design loads for seats and lap belt restraint systems for fixed-wing transport aircraft (^5). These recommendations are provided in Table II. Both the OAM and the Turnbow Army study also recommended the addition of rearward- facing criteria for air transport aircraft. Table II.

SNYDER SAE ARP 750A (Passenger Seat Design - Commercial Transport Aircraft) of 15 January 197^(^6) points out that FAR* s and Technical Standards Order (TSO's) requirements are mini- mum requirements only (U7) hut does not provide any particular dynamic seat load requirements. SAE ARP 767 (impact Protective Design of Occu- pant Environment - Transport Aircraft )( U8) in Part 6.1.11 provides information that forward deceleration of the healthy young male res- trained only by a seat belt of 5 cm (2 in) width» which is properly positioned on the hips, may be tolerated up to 33 G for 0.035-0.065 second at 2,300 G/sec onset rate with minor complaints, with human tolerance limits for non-reversible injury to 50 G peaks at 500 G/sec rate of onset for O.O25 second duration with both shoulder and lap belt restraint (issued 10-31-67 .)( *+8) SAE ARP 682A (Safety Belts for Civil Trans- port Aircraft), is presently being revised( 1+9) . This document does not provide specific belt strength recommendations, but rather states that the strength of the belt and components should be equal to the design ultimate load of the seat and its structural attachments under both static and dynamic loading conditions. Recommendations for crew restraint systems for air transport aircraft are referenced in SAE ARP 998.(50) British Civil Airworthiness Requirements for ultimate inertia forces are similar to U.S. FARfs(5l). However, aft-facing seats are re- commended under their acceptable practices. For forward- facing seats, the radius of the arcs of travel of the occupants* head, and seat back specifications are detailed. Since 1967 the U.K. has required upper torso restraint in aircraft over 5000 lb. Since 197*+ all aeroplanes have been required to have a "safety belt with one diagonal shoulder strap or safety harness for every pilot* s seat... and any seat situated alongside a pilot* s seat," and in all helicopters and gyroplanes for every pilot * s seat in use. ( 51) Canadian standards are also reciprocal with that of the U.S. in these requirements. As a prerequisite for an Austra- lian Certificate of Airworthiness, aircraft, most of which are imported from the U.S., must have their front seats fitted with an approved upper body restraint system. By 1973 this re- quirement was retroactive for most of Austra- lia * s older aircraft as well. Australia has also required 25 g upper torso restraint on air- craft (mostly U.S. manufacture) since 1956.(52) The Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Civil Aviation, issues three sets of air regulations: Advisory Circulars, Air Navigation Act Regulations, and Air Navigation Orders. Section IOI.6.I6 (Seat Belts, Safety Harnesses and Inertia Reels, related to imported turbine aeroplanes above 12,500 lb.) requires a safety harness (upper torso restraint) for each pilot and flight engineer seat, as in U.S. regula- tions. For transport category aircraft not above 12,500 lbs. section 101. U (6.12) requires a safety harness for each pilot seat as of 1 July 1967.(53) The minimum standards for safety belts, harnesses, and reels are specified in Air Navigation Order IO8.U.I3, which notes that FAA TS0-C22 is acceptable in compliance; but, a supplementary requirement makes restraints in- dividual systems, e.g. no doubling up, aß per- missible under U.S. FAR*s.(5U) In 1976, after a number of years of dis- cussion, SAE committee A-23, ( Cockpit /Cabin Standardization-General Aviation Aircraft) approved a new Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP 1226) for Occupant Restraint Systems (Active) for General Aviation Aircraft. This ARP was intended to provide guidance for the design engineer and "to provide recommendations that will lead to restraint protection for occupants of general aviation aircraft and to provide increased safety during survivable acci- dents, emergency landings and turbulent flight." (55) A second proposed ARP, 1318, for general aviation seat design, which provided criteria for increasing occupant protection (56) was also approved by the commit tee (Table III). Although both ARP* s remain proposed, since they have not been approved by the Council, and the Committee itself was disbanded as being redundant to General Aviation Manufacturers Associa- tion (GAMA) objectives, these proposed aero- space recommended practices remain the best guidelines available to date relative to general aviation restraints . (Appendix E) The Army data relates to that provided by the Crash Survival Design Guide for human toler- ance limits under full torso restraint. These values coincide with those specified in the .USAF Systems Command Design Guide (formerly HAID) with the exception of sideward tolerance, which the Air Force specifies as 9 G for 0.1 sec. for the occupant protected by lap belt and shoulder harness. (57) Tests to date indicate that tol- erances are lower for lateral than either for- ward or rearward facing body orientation for the</page><page sequence="9">RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 643 restrained occupant. Sonntag has found the maximum voluntary subjective tolerance to be 14.1 peak sled g at 600 g/sec for 0.122 sec duration. ( 58) For light aircraft (Part 2$) and rotorcraft (Part 27) current FAR requirements are shown in Table III in comparison with proposed SAE and Army recommendations. Table III.

There recently have been several state-of- the-art evaluations and comprehensive compen- diums related to human impact tolerances, and these should be referred to for more detailed information. ACCIDENT EXPERIENCE Data strongly document the life-saving protection offered by restraint systems. The NHTSA has estimated that 100# usage of lap and shoulder belts by automotive occupants would result in the saving of 16,300 fatalities per year, and 916, kOO injuries reduced or avoided per year in the United States. (59) In aircraft, estimates of the number of fatalities which could be prevented annually in accidents, if both lap and shoulder restraints were available and used, currently range from 33# (60) to 94# (6l). Survivable general avia- tion accidents have been studied in the State of Michigan during the period I969 through 1975 in a study conducted by HSRI, the University of Michigan. ( 62-65) During this period over 1000 accidents occurred and it has been estimated that the use of adequate upper torso restraints could have been expected to reduce fatality and serious injury by 75# in the selected survivable crashes investigated (e.g., accidents in which the cabin remains essentially intact without intrusion) . (65) A study of 28 "serious" air- craft accidents in central Ohio between 1964 and 1976 revealed that 7 fatalities out of 58 were medically estimated to be preventable with the use of shoulder harnesses, and 24 of these fatalities could have been prevented by im- proved cockpit and fire protection. ( 66) Such estimates however are not new, and reflect accident investigation findings going back at least 60 years. DeHaven conducted a pioneering study in 1917 of the relationship between accidents and occupant injury. (67) An analysis of 913 light plane accidents investi- gated by AV-CIR between 1942-1952 indicated that 33# of the 389 occupants "died unnecessarily." (68) By 1966 an FAA report by Möhler and Swearingen estimated that as many as 50# of the annual fatalities could have survived if ex- isting information on occupant protection, in- cluding upper torso restraint , were incorporated in aircraft design. (69) Hasbrook estimated that between I966 and 1970 approximately 600 lives could have been saved and dangerous-to-life injuries prevented in 5000 individuals (lOOO per year) through im- proved safety design of light aircraft .( 70) There have been many published studies of the effectiveness of the lap and upper torso belt, particularly over the past 35 years, and posi- tive conclusions have repeatedly been cited. From I95O to the present, there have been many studies of light aircraft, air transports, and helicopter accidents to determine Injury causation and relationship to structural design. These have overwhelmingly confirmed and docu- mented the earlier findings of DeHaven, (67,71- 77*143) DùBois, (78-80), Marrow (8l), and other studies of the 194ofs (99» 112-114), especially in regard to the effectiveness and need for</page><page sequence="10">644 R. G. SNYDER upper torso restraint protection. These have been reported oy Hasbrook (68, 70,82-90); Swearingen (o95 91-98); Snyder ( 62-65 ;107-110 , 122) and Ryan and Wick (66) in the U.S.; Mason (100) Stevens (101), and Cullen (102) in Eng- land; Brown and Lane (103-105) in Australia; and others (ill). There have also been a large number of both accident investigations and crash studies of Army light aircraft and helicopters by Flight Safety Foundation ( AV-Cir ;Av-Ser ) researchers. Accident experience for air transport category aircraft (Part 25) also has documented the need for improved occupant restraint. Analysis of 6l survivable aircraft crashes by the Flight Safety Foundation in 1967 indicated that nearly half of the 1,037 fatalities and serious injuries probably could have been pre- vented by the use of improved restraint systems. (115) Research conducted by the Civil Aero- medical Institute of FAA also indicated that seat and restraint failure had occurred in a number of otherwise survivable accidents. CAMI investigations of five air transport crashes during the preceding six-month period from Aug- ust 1968 to January I969 were cited. Relative to inadequate seat restraint protection of occu- pants, these accidents included: (l) the Pied- mont FH-227B crash on 10 August I968 at Charles- town, W. Va., fatal to 35 of 37 aboard; (2) the Northeast Fairchild FH-227 crash on 25 October 1968 near Hanover, New Hampshire fatal to 32 of 42 occupants; (3) the Allegheny Convair 58O crash on 2k December I968 at Bradford, Pa. , fatal to 20 of 47 occupants; (k) the North Cen- tral Convair 58O crash at Chicago on 27 Decem- ber, 1968, fatal to 27 of 45 occupants; and (5) the Allegheny Convair 44o which crashed near Bradford, Pa., fatal to 11 of 28 occupants. A detailed listing of all air transport accidents since 1964 for both U.S. and NATO countries, together with a much more detailed discussion of advanced restraint systems for air transport aircraft, has recently been published by NATO/ AGARD.(ll6) The Civil Aeronautics Board, and' subse- quently National Transportation Board, respon- sible for accident findings in the U.S., have reported recommendations to the FAA for over 15 years related to deficiencies found in opera- tional restraint systems. As a result of a Cessna I70A accident in June 196I, a fatality was attributed to a buckle assembly which did not prevent belt slippage under impact. It was recommended ( 1.17/62) that the TS0 under which the belt was approved be revised to require positive locking. The FAA noted that TS0 C-22 (d) was being studied and an AD had been issued. Sixteen years later the TS0 has been amended to C-22f, but there is still no requirement ade- quately covering this. As a result, many oper- ational aircraft still have older metal to fabric cam-type buckles having a release which can be inadvertently opened. In fact, at this time two U.S. air carriers still use such buck- les as standard equipment . As a result of an accident in June, I96I, the CAB recommended (11/3/64) that a shoulder harness be required for each occupant on all newly certified general aviation aircraft unless it can be demonstrated that no injurious Objects are within striking radius of the head with only a seat belt. At that time (1964) the FAA res- ponded that it could not cite definitive data to support this position. This position appeared to ignore substantial research data of its own investigators as well as that of previous studies . ( U3 , M , 67-87 ,90 , 93 ,111 , 117 , 1^3 , lUU ) . In high performance air transport aircraft, the consequences of not wearing restraint on the flight deck during flight can be tragic . The spectacular crash of the Russian Tupolev Tu-l44 supersonic transport at the 1973 Paris Air Show has been hypothesized as due to the unrestrained flight test engineer being in the cockpit with a movie camera when the pilot made a sudden evasive maneuver, perhaps fearing collision with a nearby French Air Force Dassault-Greguet Mirage 3R. The crew member may have fallen against the pilot or the controls during this critical time, precluding recovery. Four bodies and a movie camera were found upon investigation where only three should have been.(ll8) Occupants in rotorcraft crash impacts are subjected typically to much greater vertical (+G2) forces than in most fixed wing general aviation or air transport accidents. However, in this situation upper torso restraint can pro- tect the crewmember or passenger in two major ways. Restraint will keep the upper torso and head from flailing and impacting structures dur- ing the impact sequence and rebound, when such accidents consist of a series of acceleration peaks. Often overlooked is another important function of the upper torso restraint in heli- copter accidents, in that proper restraint can serve to maintain the upper torso to best transmit the impact loads to the body in the</page><page sequence="11">RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 645 vertical impact. When the vertebral column is vertically loaded (+GZ) in an erect seated posi- tion, the body is able to absorb more energy prior to structure failure, then if the verte- bral column is bent over and then subjected to vertical loading. ( 119) The head is the primary body region invol- ved in fatal and serious injury accidents, and a major function of upper torso restraint is to prevent head contact with structure. In an otherwise survivable accident involving fire or ditching, if the pilot or occupant has been ren- dered unconscious by head impact, he may not be able to escape in time. Categorization of aircraft damage in a crash impact may bear little relationship to occupant survivablility . The NTSB categorizes the severity of aircraft accidents by the terms "destroyed," "substantial damage," "minor," or "no damage." Since 1 January I968, substantial damage has been defined as "damage or structural failure which adversely affects the structural strength, performance, or flight characteristics of the aircraft, and which normally requires major repair or replacement of the affected component" ( 121) Often substantial damage to the aircraft may involve undercarriage, wing tip, or propellor damage without discernible damage to the cabin area. This may also be the case even when an aircraft is "destroyed," but the cabin area remains essentially intact without intrusion. In such cases it has long been documented that occupant protection by upper torso restraint is critical. Cases also have been found in accident investigation where the aircraft damage has been minor, as in an emer- gency landing following loss of power on takeoff; but, the occupant, unprotected by upper torso restraint, has jack-knifed forward over the lap belt and received substantial head injury in contact with the instrument panel or structure. Examples of this in recent accidents have been previously published (62,122). However, two examples illustrate the need for upper torso restraint throughout the range of aircraft damage categories. The pilot of the Piper Commanche PA-2U shown in Figure 2 successfully landed on rough dirt overrun after engine failure on takeoff, only to receive severe forehead lacerations when he jack-knifed over the lap-belt and contacted the panel. Touchdown was at about 6Q mph, and deceleration forces very low. In many other similar cases occupants receive fatal injuries. Fig. 2 - Successful gear-up landing on overrun after engine failure resulted in head injuries due to lack of upper torso restraint. In a second case, a Cessna U2I, low on an instrument approach in a snowstorm, struck trees at 130 mph, and crashed into a wooded frozen swamp area, "destroying" the air- craft (Figure 3). Even so, the pressurized cabin area remained intact, with no windows bro- ken, and the cabin door was not deformed. "While cabin integrity and potential crashworthiness remained excellent, failure of seats and lack of upper torso restraint resulted in severe trauma to the pilot and two passengers. Fig. 3 - Although the cabin remained intact in this accident, the occupants received serious injuries when seats failed and lack of upper torso restraint allowed body contact with structures.</page><page sequence="12">646 R. G. SNYDER Through 1975» comparison of aircraft acci- dents in the Michigan study of occupants with and without upper torso restraint could not he made due to a lack of accidents investigated involving aircraft with such systems installed. However, in other accidents reported, the upper torso system has proved to he extremely effec- tive. It is interesting to note that upper torso restraints have heen installed in training air- craft of the Department of Aviation, the Ohio State University, for the past 29 years. During this period six aircraft have heen totally des- troyed, yet there have heen no major injuries to any occupant wearing an upper torso re- straint. In contrast, in one accident a flight instructor applicant riding in the rear seat of a 197*+ Pipêr PA-28-180 Cherokee, which did not have a shoulder harness in the rear, did sustain substantial hack injuries. Installations were with FAA field approval, hut in no case» except for Beech Aircraft in 1969» was the manufacturer ahle to provide upper torso restraint satisfac- tory to the operator. Since the Ohio State operation with general aviation aircraft prohahly represents the most extensive use of advanced restraint systems in civil operation, their experience is felt to he an extremely important contribution. They first installed double shoulder harnesses in 13 Cessna l*+Ofs in 19*+8.(l23) These 2-place light air- craft had the upper torso portion» installed by the OSU aviation shop, attached to a flat plate in the the aft section of the fuselage. In 1956 a double shoulder harness with inert ial reel was installed in the front seats of 5 Cessna 172* s by the OSU shop. These were attached to the bulkhead aft of the baggage com- partment. A similar installation was made in 1961 to 8 two-place Cessna I50 aircraft. Their fleet of training planes was again replaced in 1965 with 13 Piper Cherokee l*+Ofs. This time a shoulder harness with inertial reel installation was made by the OSU shop and attached to the overhead structure in the fuselage. In I969 the fleet consisted of 12 Beech Musketeers A-23 aircraft, and these were equipped with a factory installed Y-yoke shoulder harness with inertia reel. The present training fleet consists of 15 197*+ Piper model PA-28-l*iO Cherokees. A Y-yoke harness was installed under sub-contract to the dealer. The present 197^ aircraft were the first four-place aircraft in this fleet to have the shoulder harness installed in all four seats.

Double upper torso restraint has been effectively used in light aircraft flight training programs contin- uously by OSU since 1948. (Courtesy Mary Beth Rich, Pilot) Fig. 5 - The inverted Y-yoke restraint system allows complete movement until an impact acceleration of 2+ .5g 1s sensed by the Inertia reel, locking the system, and restraining the upper torso.

Note that the inertial reel is installed overhead to structure, rather than to the seat. This also provides a correct angle over the shoulder. This belt, identical-except for the reel setting-to that used in the I966-69 Ford/Shelby GT 350 and GT 500 Mustang sport cars, using Hammill Manufacturing Co. belt /reel systems has been available from at least three different suppliers. American Seating in 1958 developed such a system in 1958 and conducted several dy- namic tests. (187) It is called an inverted Y- yoke harness because the single belt joining the inertia reel divides behind the neck into two belts going over the shoulder, under the arms, and attaching to floor structure. This system offers complete freedom of motion until the iner- tia reel senses an acceleration (in excess of 2 g ± .5g) at which time it "locks", firmly suppor- ting the upper torso. This system is especially comfortable for female users because unlike single diagonal systems it does not go over the breasts and can be worn with less rumpling of clothing. In six crashes reported to date with this system (in both cars and aircraft), at impact ve- locities exceeding 70 mph, no significant in- juries have been reported. This system has re- ceived extensive testing. In 1967» It was tested in comparison to other advanced aircraft res- traint systems by the Civil Aeromedicai Institute, FAA, on the Holloman AFB Daisy track, (I2U) using inertial reels manufactured by Hammill Mfg. Co. More recent tests on the Daisy track using the American Seating Company system used dummies, ba- boons, and humans, (125) Figures 6 &amp; 7 illustrate an accident in- volving a Poper Cherokee PA-28-lUo equipped with the OSU inverted Y-yoke with inertia reel system. During an emergency landing demonstrated by an instructor pilot, high tension lines were inad- vertently contacted 70 feet from ground level while the aircraft was climbing at full throttle. The aircraft subsequently struck the wires at an initial 90 mph impact velocity, impacted the ground on the nose and right wing, and rolled over into an inverted position on its back. Al- though the aircraft was destroyed, the cabin area remained relatively intact, and the 210 lb. female student pilot and 61 , 132 lb. male in- structor restrained by the lap belt and double upper torso harness, reportedly survived without significant injury.

SNYDER EXPERIMENTAL DATA With at least 2200 (and probably over 5000) references in the literature, restraint systems have been the subject of numerous experimental testing and development programs. Further, there are now well over 100 restraint configu- rations; in fact, the recent AGARD study des- cribed some 65 variations of advanced passive restraints which have been developed. ( II6) These include belts, nets, inflatable belts, transparent shields, blankets, cushions, arms and barriers, capsules, integrated seats and déployable head restraint systems. Since de- tailed analysis of the bulk of this literature is beyond the scope of this paper, reference is made to other publications where further detail is available. ( 126-129) DEVELOPMENT OF RESTRAINT SYSTEMS Restraint systems appear to have been developed for use in automotive vehicles prior to aircraft, probably the first patent being that of Freeman in l883.(l30) By 1903 Leveau of France had devised and patented an integrated full body restraint system consisting of ad- justable double cross-chest belts and a lap belt, with the shoulder straps attached to high- backed seat. (131) An analysis of the develop- ment of automotive restraint systems, concepts, and design problems, has been discussed in a previous SAE publication. ( 132 ,133) Aviation* s first safety belt has been attributed to Lt. Foulois in I9IO when a field artillery saddle maker modified a trunk strap for U.S. Army aeroplane No. 1 (13*0. The U.S. Military air power at that time consisted of one pilot (Lt. Loulois), 8 enlisted men, and 2 civilian mechanics, operating on an annual bud- get of $150.(135) By World War I the need for additional restraint became evident to some as fighter pilots of the era devised the basic aerial combat maneuvers (Lufberry, Immelman, vertical reverse, etc.) which would be employed for the next Uo years. The English used an upper torso restraint in the English Spad fight- er of 1917* while the Germans used upper torso restraint in the Fokker Triplane (watch closely when you see the movie "The Blue Max" ) and other aircraft . Although the lap belt became standard equipment in U. S. Civil Aviation with the Aviation Act of 1926, the military again led the way in use of the shoulder harness. The B-12 "shoulder belt" (a double upper torso harness) was developed by the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1939 after several years of experiments initiated in I937 by F.G. Manson, under direction of Lt. Col. Grow and Capt. Armstrong, at Wright Field. ( 136) At about the same time, German scientists, such as Ruff, were conducting early impact and re- straint studies which continued in the late 30* s and early Uo*s.(l37) Tests established that, where jack-knifing over the lap belt alone occurred at 8 G, use of both lap belt and upper torso restraint enabled use without serious in- jury at an estimated 30 G impact .( I38-IU2) The Air Corps Newsletter of October 15, 1939 noted, "It is now known, as it was then (1937) believed, that the high percentage of injuries to the head and face in aircraft accidents in compari- son to the relatively low percentage of injuries to other parts of the body is due to the use of the lap type belt which prevents the lower part of the body from being thrown forward during crashes while the upper part of the trunk and the head are unrestrained and jack-knifed for- ward, allowing the latter to strike the instru- ment panel or other structured parts of the air-</page><page sequence="15">RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 649 plane. 11 (.135) Although the same observation had been made during World War I, the solution at that time had been to cut out the cowl to pro- vide 8 inches more space. (136) While shoulder harnesses remained standard in fighter aircraft and were provided for mili- tary transport and bomber aircrew, they were not always worn by the latter since they were often uncomfortable and cumbersome on long missions. Acceptance was more universal in fighter air- craft where the pilot was restricted in movement and subjected to high acceleration forces re- quiring upper' torso restraint. During this period the 1+0 G cockpit of World War II fighters was established, although emphasis was on improving the standard 3" belt webbing strength and characteristics, attach- ments, and introduction of the inertia reel for the shoulder harness. The work of Col. (then Captain) John. Paul St app at Edwards AFB during 19^5-^6 marked the initiation of modern bio- medical studies of advanced occupant restraint protection in this country. ( 138-11+2) Crash Injury Research of Cornell University» later dividing into Aviation (under Dr. H. Haven) and Automotive (under J. Moore) divisions, con- ducted a number of pioneering studies during the 191+0* s of civil aircraft accidents, invol- ving both air transport and light aircraft. The reports of DeHaven ( 67 »71-77 »ll+3), DuBois (T8-80), and T. Marrow of the Civil Aeronautics Authority (8l) concerning the causation of occupant injury and the relationship between cabin structure and injury provided an early basis for improved occupant protection in air- craft design. (ll+l+) Early application of this work went into the crashworthiness design of the CAA-Texas A &amp; M AG-1 prototype aerial applicator of 1952, which featured a UO-Gseat, military lap belt, and integral double tipper-torso restraint with inertia reel. This aircraft was designed to protect the pilot against serious injury in a collision at velocities up to 120. .7 km/hr (65 mph)(77). DYNAMIC CRASH TESTS The accident investigation studies of the 191+0* s also provided a basis for improvements in light aircraft safety design. Beech pio- neered the "shoulder strap concept" for light aircraft in I9I+8 (1U5), and was granted U.S. Patent 2,576,876 (1U6). Subsequently, between February and April 1951 Beech Aircraft Corporation conducted a series of 35 experimental tests of lap and upper torso restraint system. The tests were conduc- ted utilizing a bonanza fuselage on a track snubbed by a vehicle. The CAA 216 lb. anthropo- morphic dummy "Elmer" was used in these pioneer- ing dynamic deceleration tęsts. Tests pro- gressed from 6.2 G (1339 Tb.) to l6 G ( 31+56 lb.) before belt failure. However, in March, an improved belt was tested to l8 G, and in the final test in April, 1951» 20.3 G was sustained without failure. (ll+7) This shoulder harness/lap belt system was subsequently incorporated in all Beechcraft Bonanzas (after serial D268l), all Travel-Airs, and all Twin-Bonanzas after serials H-6(9l+) • In Service Engineering Report No. 101 to owners, an excellent presentation was made as to the why and how of the shoulder harness and other protective structural design features, including results of several accidents. One pilot and a passenger, who survived the crash ("completely demolished") of a 1955 F-model Bonanza in a 1958 accident, attributed their escape from injury to "the use of the shoulder harness and. . .wonderful construction of the Bonanza" ( 1U8 ) . This system was reportedly first used in the 1951 Model 35 (l*+9) and the first protective value proven in a 1953 accident . ( 150 ) These restraint systems were installed first as standard on Beech* s production aircraft, then made optional, as "...the owners not only re- fused to use the restraint systems but many actually requested the removal of the shoulder restraints, "(151) and finally dropped as an option, until recently. In this regard it is interesting to note that, while in 1975 Cessna seat design "progressed from 9 G to 15 G crash capability ,**(151) 2k years earlier they had ad- vertised a "25 G" capability and had tested to over 20 G(l52). Other light aircraft providing a combined lap-shoulder harness as standard equipment during this period, as a direct result of the earlier AV-CIR studies, were the 1953 Helioplane Courier and the two-place Myers IU5, using U275 lb. strength belt webbing. (77) During the early 1950* s the National Ad- visory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) con- ducted a number of dynamic crash tests at the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory, which re- sulted in a number of crashworthiness recommen- dations related to the occupant protection afforded by upper torso restraint . (153-158) Restrained anthropomorphic dummies occupied</page><page sequence="16">650 R. G. SNYDER three light aircraft (.J-3 Piper Cubs) which were crashed into a barrier at U2, 1+7» and 60 mph velocities and demonstrated conclusively the requirement for upper torso seating and improved anchorages and seating (as well as the need for an improved dummy) (153-155). Additional crash tests involved fighter aircraft (FH-l), Trans- port-Cargo aircraft (C-U6, C-82) , and RSD Lode- star. On 17 April 1956, a major conference on airplane crash- impact loads, crash in juries, and principles of seat design for crashworthiness was held, and the accompanying attendance list indicated that manufacturers, suppliers, govern- ment agencies, airlines and other aviation or- ganizations were well represented (158). Major findings reported in these NACA tests were that a shoulder harness would protect the occupants of a typical two-place Piper training aircraft in stall-spin impact speeds up to the 60 mph tested. It was concluded that without a shoulder harness, severe to fatal injury is likely (due to head and body striking the in- strument panel) unless an additional space of 31-^5 inches was clear of any solid or un- yielding protuberances. NACA researchers also concluded that the present seat belts (to 1953) "should be capable of withstanding higher break- ing loads than those presently used. "(153,15^» 158) The U.S. Army has had a particular interest in restraint systems in crash survival research for the past 20 years and has sponsored a number of crash tests. In the period 1955-1959» work was initially sponsored in the form of grants to Aviation Crash Injury Research (at that time associated with Cornell University; subsequently becoming in April 1959» the Aviation Safety Engineering and Research Division (AVSER) of Flight Safety Foundation; then the Dynamic Science Division of Marshall Industries; and» at present ^ known as Ultra Systems). In September 1959» the U.S. Army Transportation Research Command (USATRECOM) entered into a contract with Flight Safety Foundation for the conduct of a long range program. On 23 October i960, the initial drop of a Piasecki model H-25A helicop- ter occurred, released from a drop height of 29 feet at a forward velocity of 30 mph. Since then a number of tests of helicopters, and one light aircraft, have been conducted (159). Most of these have been primarily concerned with seating or restraint system tests. The data from these tests have formed the basis of the series of design guides (for fixed wing and rotorcraft) issued by the Army (3,120) as well as the FAA (5-7). While to date no jet air transport aircraft have been crash tested, there have been some experimental tests of propellor-driven models. Besides the NACA tests involving C-U6, C-82, and RSD aircraft conducted in the early 1950's, the FAA crash tested a Lockheed Model 16^9 (160) and Douglas DC-7 (161) transport. Crash tests of light aircraft had been previously proposed and planned in Í959 at the College of Engineer- ing, University of Arizona's Tumococ Test Facil- ity at the FAA1 s Civil Aeromedicai Institute's Oklahoma City facility in I962 ; and, in I969 the University of Michigan's Willow Run Airport facility. However, a crashworthiness program was finally initiated in 1972 by FAA and NASA in cooperation with the general aviation manufac- turers# Utilizing as a basis 31 Piper aircraft which had been subjected to flooding, a series of crash tests are being conducted at NASA Langley Research Center using a 350 foot tower. The purpose of the Langley tests is to define the dynamic load criteria in general aviation accidents for future designs. At present, air- worthiness regulations for type certification express loads in terms of static conditions. Since this may be unrealistic for an actual crash which involves velocity, attitude, angle of impact, and different rates of onset, pulse time, and many other factors, the studying of controlled instrumented crashes through dynamic testing will contribute greatly to more realis- tic test requirements. The automotive industry, in comparison, had crash tested an estimated 10,000 automobiles by 1970 and has long used dynamic test criteria rather than static. Additional tests have been conducted at NAFEC, using a catapult and 300 ft. track to accelerate aircraft seats and cabin (up to 6,300 lbs.) to velocities of 6l mph. In addi- tion, NAFEC has a 35 1 drop facility capable of test dropping a 30,000 lb. load (162). The FAA has also been conducting dynamic crashworthiness tests at the Civil Aeromedicai Institute at Oklahoma City. These have primarily involved dynamic testing of current and experimental air- craft seating and restraint systems. In the 1970 's Cessna Aircraft Company adopt- ed dynamic crash test facilities based on the automotive industry experience. These include: a free-fall drop tower with a drop height of 10 feet and maximum capacity of 57 lb . , to test</page><page sequence="17">RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 65 1 small components; a pendulum with a 12 foot swing radius initially used on impact tests of Model 336 nose wheels; a 20 foot bungee sled with 200 lb. load (30 mph) capability; a chain drive 33 foot sled track (capacity 500 lb., at over 75 mph velocity); and a barrier crash site. The latter was a 600 foot track and guide rail into an earth barrier providing speeds in excess of 60 mph (163). Crash tests to date have in- cluded a Model I50 at 50 mph, and a Model 337. Results of these tests and details on restraint systems tested have not been published. Various methods of energy absorption can be incorporated into restraint components, such as a stainless steel cable with h0% elongation, and various soft metal rollers in reels. In 197^ Gamble described a technique for reducing the impact loading of an individual by absorbing a portion of the impact energy within the res- traint system. While often used in vehicle structural design, such techniques have not of- ten been employed. This system is based on a set of relatively soft metal rollers which are deformed as the shaft rotates inside the wheel when a predetermined value is exceeded. This may reduce the sharp peak loading in an impact and reduce the loading on the occupant . (157) At the present time about 85# of the res- traint systems utilized in commercial aviation are supplied by Flight Systems, Inc. of American Safety, with Pacific Scientific, Davis Aircraft Products Company, Inc., and American Seating supplying most of the balance. At least two of the major suppliers use the applicable- test methods and limits for components as specified in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (MVSS) No. 209 for automobiles,(l) which have much more advanced requirements than the present applicable FAR 's. Nevertheless, there are im- portant differences between aircraft and auto- motive needs. Concepts for improved testing of inertia reels and shoulder harness assemblies for aircraft have recently been published by Ross, following earlier test findings at CAMI that some inertia reels allowed significant upper torso motion. It was concluded that "c rudeness of the Mockup test device prevented an accurate assessment of current reel design" (165) and additional study is required. How- ever, a new test block was designed to produce the load vector geometry at the buckles, and a test procedure was designed for providing load distributions. These were considered potentials ly adaptable and valid for all shoulder harness designs. Dynamic testing of safety belt assemblies, using a Part 572 dummy by SAE J117&gt; was found to provide an acceptable guide, minimizing the potential for: a double standard between dynamic and static test criteria. This work should be referred to by all engineers involved in air- craft restraint system testing. In I972 a series of twenty-two FAA dynamic tests had been conducted at NAFEC utilizing lap belt and lap belt /shoulder harness restraint systems. In these tests, "it was demonstrated that the lap belt /shoulder harness restraint systems offered occupants successful restraint at occupant inertia force levels substantially above the current regulatory level". (166) An earlier I969 FAA study which evaluated dynamic test criteria for aircraft seats had found that static testing for the type certi- fication of aircraft seats and restraint de- vices, as specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations and Technical Standard Orders, can- not be related to crash environments, while dynamic test regiments can be specified in terms of crash severity. It was recommended that dy- namic testing be considered for the type certi- fication of aircraft seats and restraint devices (167). Among the more interesting test series &gt; which have been more recently conducted, were 1976 CAMI tests of an integrated seat and re- straint system of a certified (i.e. meeting 9 G static requirements), aircraft that failed at 6.5 G under dynamic loading. On the other hand, a promising prototype seat restraint and cabin interior system functioned adequately at 30 G. (192) RESTRAINT DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS A detailed discussion of occupant restraint systems relative to automotive use was published in 1969» describing the design engineer's prob- lems. Many of the conclusions in that study are applicable to civil aircraft and rotorcraft today. (.132) A more recent consideration of safety, comfort, economy, and ease of installa- tion of current restraint take-up devices, and their use in general aviation, was discussed by Hughes (168). However, a major point in both studies related to the importance of design of the restraint system for user acceptance, something which most automobile manufacturers seem to have failed at (an exception being the</page><page sequence="18">652 R. G. SNYDER 1966-69 Ford Shelby Hamill Y-yoke restraint sys- tem similar to that now used in many aircraft.) One solution in automobiles to problems in fit and acceptance was offered by the integral res- traint system. By placing the inertia reels and retracting restraint into the seat itself, as has been done in numerous experimental con- cept vehicles, most of the problems of fit can be eliminated. But seats of significant strength are not yet available in most general aviation aircraft (exception being the 25 G/ ko G aerial applicator systems). Another alternative is the use of passive restraint systems, where the user has to take ńo action but is automatically protected when exposed to loads exceeding a predetermined acceleration. The "air bag" approach is not yet practical for aircraft, due to as yet un- solved problems related to the differences be- tween automotive and aircraft impact environ- ments, particularly in sensing when a crash is occurring and discriminating between other en- vironments such as turbulence (where a belt system offers better restraint), a hard landing, etc. A number of other passive systems have been developed but most are not yet practical for aircraft. A recent (1976) detailed analysis of advanced aircraft restraint systems presents an evaluation of these systems and other sour- ces of reference .( 116) A systems engineering evaluation conduc- ted for the U. S. Air Force, of passive res- traint systems for air transport aircraft found an increased human error potential, and human factors problems .( 169) Before air bags are seriously considered for use in operational air- craft, it was recommended that a number of fac- tors need definition. The G levels expected in aircraft accidents must be accurately defined, a crash envelope determined, including critical closing rates and collision object definition for use with proximity sensors. In addition, it is necessary to determine the level of hazard with respect to occupant toxicity and noise. It is also necessary to conduct a cost effec- tiveness comparison between systems from the viewpoint of structural changes in operational aircraft. This should consider factors such as the penalty for increased weight, redesign of seats, increased maintenance requirements, and decreased human user error potential. This systems study, believed to be the first use of this technique applied to restraint systems for transport aircraft, also found that present Air Force transport l6 G rear-facing seats offered more reliable impact protection than do current state-of-the-art air bag systems. Current FAA acceptable methods, techniques and- practices of shoulder harness installations, effective restraint angles, and attachment meth- ods are found in AC 1+3.13-2 (170). Following dynamic tests, additional recommendations for installation of upper torso restraint, to speci- fic location on structures without major air- frame modification, were published in an FAA report by Young in I966 (171). The importance of upper torso restraint in aircraft accidents (70- 80# of fatalities due to head injury; 50% might have been prevented) is shown in "Restraint for Survival, "( 172) a FAA documentary film of the I96U-65 aircraft cabin dynamic tests conducted at CAMI by Young upon which the recommendations were based. A functional comparison of basic restraint systems was also made by Young. He pointed out the protective advantages of a double shoulder harness system over a single diagonal upper torso belt; the importance of the seat belt anchorage (tie-down) which establishes the seat belt angle ("a greater forward location of a tie-down decreases the restraint function of a seat belt and can seriously compromise the entire restraint system"); and the significant difference in occupant kinematics at impact re- strained by shoulder harness and seat (lap) belt as compared to a lap belt only. (173) Inadequate restraint designs which have been observed in some general aviation aircraft include: poor fit of the single diagonal shoulder belt across the neck, no upper torso restraint, seat belt attachment points too far forward (which pulls the belt across the upper legs rather than pel- vis); and, in one model of a popular aircraft, the rear seat lap belt inboard attachments were 15 inches to the rear of the outboard attach- ments which provides uneven restraint and de- grades protection, bringing the outboard strap over the thigh (rather than pelvis) in excess of 70° angle with the longitudinal axis of the air- craft. The recommended guidelines for optimal restraint protection should provide a 1+5-55° belt angle at the occupants1 pelvis. The angle of the shoulder belts to the shoulder should be between 0° and 30° above a line parallel to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft . Aged, frayed, or deteriorated belts should be replaced, and while this should be a respon- sibility of the pilot and owner, a greater</page><page sequence="19">RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 653 effort by the manufacturer and FAA should be conducted to educate the owner and pilot about its importance. Perhaps it could be made a part of the annual inspection. Similarly, the metal to fabric and open-cam type seat belt buckles most often fail since the cam can be inadvert- ently opened during impact. Such belts are also still seen on some air carrier aircraft, but may no longer be available after June 1977 in this country. A snugly fit lap belt is more effective than a loose one, and the introduction of the automoti ve- type self-locking retractor can assist with proper fit. The retractor type lap belt is presently used in some flight attendant stations in air transport aircraft. However, the user must be careful to extend both sides of the lap belt at least 8 to 10 inches before the retractor mech- anisms will lock both sides of the lap belt. If this type of belt is put on by pulling only one side over the lap to the other side, with- out extending the opposite half, one side may not lock properly and allow the occupant to slip out during side or forward loads (17^). Similarly, the lap belt portion of the lap/ shoulder restraint system must be adjusted to fit the flight attendant occupying the seat. Figure 8 illustrates correct and incorrect methods of restraint with this system. F ig. 8 - Correct and incorrect methods of wearing flight-attendant lap belt/upper torso restraint. (After R. Dennis, McDonnell -Doug! as) NASA-AMES k5 G AIR TRANSPORT SEAT /RESTRAINT In 1966 NASA initiated studies under Kubo- kawa at Ames Research Center to design and de- velop an improved restraint-seat system for air- line use. This system features a double shell. The outer shell, fastened to the floor, is the primary structure to which the impact attenuat- ing devices and the inner seat are attached. This outer shell is an aluminum structure formed over fiberglass, and is padded on either side, thus providing protection to the passenger from free- flying objects during impact. The res- traint system retracts back into the seat and consists of double shoulder belts attached to a lap belt as shown in Figures 9 and IO4 however, both ends of the shoulder belt continue to attach at the lower end into the seat, forming side protection.

Kubokawa, NASA-Ames) Fig. 10 - Details of NASA-Ames Integrated Restraint System 1n mockup seat. (Photo courtesy C. Kubokawa, NASA-Ames)</page><page sequence="20">654 R. G. SNYDER The NASA- Ame s system has had more extensive research development than any previous system. ( k ,116 ,175-178) The double torso belt with in- ertia reels has been demonstrated to restrain an occupant safely at 22 G in the horizontal direc- tion without submarining or ejection. In the NASA seat design, the peak load energy is ab- sorbed by the stretching of energy absorbing cables and the activation of other energy absorb- ing mechanisms located between the inner and outer structures. Three series of impact tests were conducted on four prototype seats. The first series were conducted in June 1970 at the AVSER dynamic crash facilities at Dynamic Science, a Division of -Marshall Industries (at that time) at Deer Valley, Arizona, utilizing test equipment made available by the U.S. Army Air Mobility Research and Development Laboratory at Ft. Eustis, Virginia. ( 176) A second series of tests were conducted on two new seats in October 1971 at the FAA* s Civil Aeromedicai Institute (CAMI) at Oklahoma City. The third series of vertical tests were conducted at CAMI in March 1972, to ^5 +G2 impact levels, exceed- ing the design objectives .( k) However, while this seat was tested and proven some five years ago as representative of the state-of-the-art for air transport occupant protection, and found to exceed present FAR 25.56I minimum oçcupant protection requirements by 10 times in the ver- tical component and to provide over double the forward protection, it still remains unused by the aircraft industry. Other integrated restraint systems have been designed which are applicable to air trans- port aircraft. Chrysler Corporation presently uses a lap belt with diagonal upper torso re- straint in the Gruman Gulf stream G-2 jet cor- porate aircraft. When not in use the upper tor- so restraint retracts into the seat-back on an inertia reel. (179) An integrated restraint system, also having a diagonal upper torso re- straint attached to an inertia reel in the seat back, was designed by Robbins et. al. in 1971 on an advanced concepts contract with NHTSA (180). Several systems were developed and tested, in- cluding a bucket seat with airbag torso res- traint and energy absorbing lower panel (passive system) , a bucket seat with inverted Y-yoke harness, and a bucket seat with a 3-point har- ness system. One advantage of the integrated restraint-seat system is that it will allow optimum belt angles on the occupant since the system is independent of seat movement. PREGNANT OCCUPANT PROTECTION So far discussion has assumed the I70 lb. occupant FAA uses as a test criteria; but, often occupants include the pregnant female, children and infants. Tests using baboon subjects (18I- 183) have been conducted to determine the effect of restraint wearing upon a pregnant female in impact. Automotive accident cases have been studied involving pregnant seat-belted occu- pants. (183) While there may be a chance of trauma to the fetus in a severe impact, the fetus has little chance of survival without the mother surviving. In most cases the pregnant female has tolerated the impact well provided the belt restraint was correctly worn, and fit snug and low on the fundus. There is no evi- dence to date indicating that seat belt res- traints increase mortality of either mother or fetus iņ severe accidents (183). Upper torso restraint will provide increased protection to the pregnant as well as non-pregnant occupant. INFANT AND CHILD RESTRAINT At the present time there are no FAA stan- dards pertaining to child restraint. Infants and children under two years of age may be held on the mother ł s lap on air carrier aircraft , but this may be hazardous in a crash impact since the mother may not be able to retain the child if the deceleration is great enough. Jack- knifing forward over the lap belt may injure the child. Under no circumstances should children and infants be unrestrained in turbulence, land- ing or takeoff, or in a crash landing situation. Although a number of infant and child res- traint systems have been tested and used in automobiles in compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213 (I8U), the environ- mental factors in an aircraft crash may differ significantly from the automotive accident. In particular, the vertical loads may be expected to be greater than normally occur in an auto- motive accident. It is necessary to conduct tests using aircraft seats in typical aircraft crash profiles to determine how effective seats developed for automobiles may be in aircraft crash environments. Recognizing this need, Chandler at the FAA's Civil Aeromedicai Insti- tute in Oklahoma City, conducted tests on several automotive child restraints in 1975 • However, the FAA has not yet acted on these data nor conducted a further test program.</page><page sequence="21">RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 655 Until guidelines are available for air carriers, flight attendants are in the position of having to ask parents, who bring automotive child or infant restraints on board, to take their child (if under 2 years of age) out of th&lt; protective device and hold him (or her) on a parent's lap during takeoff and landing. Al- though this makes little sense, there have been no FAA guidelines, standards, or advisories on this subject to date. In 1975 the Aerospace Medical Association requested that the FAA take immediate action to resolve the child restrain" program by appropriate testing and subsequent issuance of recommendations and guidance to air carrier operators, physicians, and all pilots, concerning those restraint devices approved for use of infants and children in aircraft. The Society of Automotive Engineers has had an Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP 766) available since I967. This is presently in re- vision and ARP 766 should be issued early in 1977.(185) There are some significant additions to this guideline, which are intended for chil- dren weighing up to ho lbs. and able to sit up, which provide protection during landings, take- offs, turbulence, and survivable aircraft im- pacts. The child device used should provide protection during a kk ft. /sec. velocity change with g levels not exceeding a range for accel- eration/time based upon a AV of 30 mph, and with the deceleration vector at any angle within a forward k^° cone of the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. The force required to release the restraint device shall not exceed ik lbs. (6. U kg) while a horizontal load of U 5 lbs. (20 kg) is being applied to the system. Each child restraint device should be capable of being properly installed in a civil air trans- port passenger seat using only the standard adult lap belt assembly,. A new SAE Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP 1U69) will provide guidance for restraint of infants under 20 lbs. (9kg) and/or too young to sit up.(l86) The NHTSA has established a child restraint standard (MVSS 213), first issued in March 1970, and effective 1 April 1971. Only static testing is prescribed under this current standard. How- ever, proposed amendments to FMVSS 213 would re- quire that devices be tested under simulated frontal, lateral and rearward dynamic crash conditions. Head motion would be limited to l8 inches excursion. Testing for three weight ranges would be specified: 17 lbs. (7-7 kg) or less, 17-^3 lbs. and over U 3 lbs. (19.5 kg). A major difficulty has been availability of satis-H factory child test dummies which accurately simulate size and O.G. properties. There is now extensive literature related to child restraints and considerable research and development related to automotive vehicles. Basic anatomical considerations for engineers have been outlined by Burdi et. al. (188) and other studies consider child restraint basic design, and child design measurements .( 192 ,193) AIRCRAFT "AIR BAG" RESTRAINT In recent years a considerable amount of research effort, primarily stimulated and funded by the NHTSA, U.S. Department of Transportation, has gone into the development of inflatable occupant restraint systems, commonly (but tech- nically erroneously) known as "air bags". Such systems are composed of six basic components consisting of: (l) crash sensor-initiator, (2) energy (gas) source (stored gas and/or solid gas generator), (3) valve to release gas, (U) mani- fold (to distribute gas), (5) inflatable bag, and (6) malfunction detector and system readi- ness monitor. Each of these subsystems has its own set of environmental problems and compo- nents . Inflatable restraint systems were closely associated with aircraft in conceptual devel- opment, although almost all recent development has been for proposed automotive requirements. Pre-inflated bags developed by Clark and Blech- schmidt were tested by the Martin Company, NASA, FAA, and Flight Safety Foundation in a series of tests in the i960 1 s . ( 19*t ) CAMI (FAA) con- ducted the first full-scale air bag testing pro- gram with test animals on the Holloman AFB Daisy Decelerator in 1967.(12**) In 1971 the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center (NAFEC) of the FAA funded an engineering research study conducted by Beta Industries to develop a con- cept of an inflatable restraint system for general aviation aircraft. Although they con- cluded that significant modifications would be necessary to the seat support structure and seat pan to provide the necessary- energy absorption characteristics for alteration of the vertical crash load, their study indicated that an air "bag system could fully protect the occupant of a general aviation aircraft in a crash impact. (195) The FAA conducted a test of a prototype air bag system at the NAFEC facilities, mounted</page><page sequence="22">656 R. G. SNYDER in an aircraft cabin arrested at 130 km/h (8l mph). In comparison with a lap belt- shoulder harness restraint the air bag lessened peek loads on the torso, but resulted in an initial "violent" rearward head acceleration as the bag inflated. Although static tests were conducted in this series only one dynamic test was attempted, and this work was reported in May 1972.(196) Thus, other than the pioneering work of Clark and Blechschmidt, (19*0 the pre- liminary conceptual study for light aircraft reported in 1973, (195) and the prototype static tests and single dynamic test at NAFEC in 1972, (196) there have been no significant aircraft tests reported to date. Inflatable restraint systems have been applied to alternate lateral (-Gy) impact for Air Force new escape modules such as the General Dynamics F-lll, (197) and to the impact attenuator bladders of the B-l bomber, although crew restraint in each is a belt system utilizing inertia reels. (198) Use of passive restraint systems involves economic, mainten- ance, and reliability concerns, as well as whether additional weight penalty may be invol- ved. For light aircraft Carr and Philips esti- mated 3.63 kg (8 lbs.) per occupant. Assuming similar bag specification and requirements for air transport aircraft this could add over a ton weight penalty to a wide body transport. In a systems engineering study conducted to evaluate air bag potential in military air transports, Robbins and Snyder concluded that a major pro- blem requiring solution involved crash sensing criteria. ( 169) A number of crash sensors have been developed or proposed including: acoustic (ultrasonic, sonic), optical (laser, infra-red), radar (microwave), radar- impact switch combina- tion, mechanically extended probes, and electro- mechanical (inertial) approaches ; however , no system is yet known to be capable of reliably sensing an impending aircraft crash. The range of environmental problems encountered in aircraft accidents are significantly different from those encountered in automotive crash conditions. The problem of providing occupant protection in other than impact conditions, such as in turbulence, would probably still require a lap belt. It is concluded that the air bag system at this point in the state-of-the-art is not ready to re- place active belt type systems, but will require much further research and development for the aircraft environment. A comprehensive evolution of the air bag (and other passive systems) for air transport aircraft has recently been pub- lished by NATO (lió, 169, 179, 199) and this and ancillary studies should be referred to for detailed information. UPPER TORSO RESTRAINT AVAILABILITY Although a well-documented life-saving de- vice, since upper torso restraint still is not required by the Federal Aviation Administration, many manufacturers have not until recently in- stalled them as standard equipment, and then only in the two front crew seats. Beech Air- craft Company for example (which tested 20 g upper torso restraints in aircraft in 1951 and has pioneered upper torso restraints since I9U8) reported only a 6.7$ customer request as an option in 1972, and did not provide upper torso belts as standard for crew and passenger in all models until 1976. Piper aircraft (although providing a 25 g double upper torso restraint as standard in its agricultural applicator, PA- 25 Pawnee, since 1957) did not provide upper torso restraint as standard (crew only) in its heavy twins until 197^, and in singles and light twins until 1975. Cessna had about a 5$ in- stallation of upper torso harnesses in its single engine aircraft in 1973; about 50$ on its twins, as options; and still offered upper torso har- nesses as optional in 1977 single-engine models. At present only the 197^ Ohio State PA-28- lUo Cherokee training aircraft, and the Chrys- ler Corporation Grumman G'll (Part 121) aircraft are known to provide upper torso restraint protection to rear seat passengers, and both were special installations of the operator. Appendix D provides an estimate of shoulder belt and inertia reel restraint system., instal- lations for the period 1972 through 1976 in various general aviation aircraft and heli- copters . DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY The foregoing has provided an overview of the development of civil aircraft restraint systems, applicable standards, pertinent acci- dent findings, experimental data, and appli- cations . It is apparent that there are considerable objective data available through accident exper- ience over the past 30 years to document the need for upper torso restraint in civil air-</page><page sequence="23">RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 657 craft. In air transport aircraft, rear-facing seating, seats with integral restraint systems, and improved state-of-the-art seats with inte- gral restraint systems (such as the NASA-Ames airline passenger seat-reportedly capable of attenuating loads of 21 -Gx and 45 +G2) all offer occupant protection greatly in excess of current minimum FAA standards. In light of air- craft and helicopters, upper torso restraint, such as has been used in aircraft continuously since 1948 by Ohio State University, could significantly reduce serious and fatal injury in current accidents. There has lông been confusion and mis- understanding concerning certain key phrases in the FARfs, and greater clarification of some specific terms appears long overdue. Of par- ticular significance in part 23.561, for ex- ample, are the terms "minor crash landing" and "moderate descent velocity»" which lack objec- tive definition by the FAA, yet are required in design standards for occupant protection. The need for realistic standards dealing with occupant protection in "moderate" to "severe survivable" accidents, above that of the "minor crash landing," was documented in an FAA Office of Aviation Medicine staff report sub- sequently transmitted to FAA Flight Standards Service nearly a decade ago. This stated, "data on human tolerance limits to deceleration (threshold of injury), when properly restrained, far exceed the ultimate inertia forces for a minor crash landing as specified in Part 25.561. Conferees at the December I967 USAF-Industry Life Support Conference recommended revising load factors for passenger seats from the pre- sent l6 g to 20 g and that aft-facing seats be used whenever possible. "Experience has shown that survival can be expected and has occurred repeatedly at crash force levels far in excess of the minor crash landing criteria in Part 25.561. This exper- ience confirms the experimental data accumulated over the last two decades. In addition, surviv- able conditions relative to the occupiable area have been found to persist at increasingly high- er crash force levels. Survivable crash force conditions in today's modern airplane are approaching the threshold limits of human tol- erance to accelerative forces. "Conclusions: There are no standards deal- ing with occupant protection in moderate to severe survivable accidents. It is concluded that human tolerance to accelerative forces is much greater than the forces generated during some of today's "non survivable ' accidents. We have 1+0 g people riding in 20 g airplanes, and sitting in 9 g seats and restraint systems (43, 44)." These findings reflect the significant gap between the current civil aircraft design standards and the state-of-the-art. The standard prescribed by the FAA is often below that prescribed by comparable standards of other federal agencies and is usually tech- nically far behind the state-of-the-art. For example, for seat belts, NHTSA Federal Motor Vehicle Satety Standard 209 has required 4000 lb. type II and 6000 lb. type I belts in motor vehicles. It also has required upper torso restraint (type 2 or 2a) in the outboard front seat positions in all new cars, except conver- tibles, manufactured for sale in the U.S. since 1 January I968 (l). The Army specifies 4000 lb. (tension) strength belt webbing for har- nesses (3, p. 181) in light fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. While design of the civil aircraft restraint system strictly to conform with the minimum FAR applicable standards or I5OO lb. belt strength (in tension) may meet certification standards for that particular factor, such design has not utilized state-of- the-art knowledge, nor does it "constitute the optimum to which the regulated should strive. (w* Federal Aviation Order DA2100.1, which prescribes the "Rulemaking Policies for Safety and Air Traffic Rules" clearly defines the in- bent of the regulations and standards of the Federal Aviation Act. This states "Standards. The Act Provides for the Establishment of Mini- mum Standards. This will be interpreted to mean those standards adequate to meet basic require- ments, giving dņe regard to the state-of-the- art and the needs of the national system. Such standards do not consitute the optimum to which the regulated should strive(47)". Thus the standards are intended as minimum requirements only, rather than as the design goal. A significant amount of accident data is available to illustrate that the "minimum" rest- raint requirements are not adequate. For example, an Australian study has shown that "the belt or attachments failed in the pilot ' s position in at least l8# of fatal and serious injury accidents and the pilot's seat failed in at least 28# of accidents (52)." In another example of current experience, the NTSB investigation of a Piper Seneca (Pa-</page><page sequence="24">658 R. G. SNYDER 3U-2OO) accident in February 197^ disclosed that five (of 7) unoccupied passenger seats came loose in a "relatively moderate" crash sequence, were propelled forward in the cabin, and probab- ly contributed to the pilot* s fatal injuries. This aircraft was equipped with an upper torso restraint for the pilot and autopsy findings and damage to the aircraft * s instrument panel indi- cate that the pilot "would have survived" if he had been wearing his harness. .In a three page report the NTSB noted that the same conditions which could cause the seat to come loose when empty could also cause it to come loose when the seat belt is fastened loosely around either an empty seat or an occupant, and strongly ques- tioned the adequacy of lUCFR23 certification criteria for static testing of seats and res- traint devices (190). This accident points out both design inadequacies and human user inade- quacies. Unless the restraint system is worn by the occupant it cannot protect him. Unless the seat /restraint system is adequately designed for an otherwise survivable impact, the occupant will not be adequately protected. The Department of Civil Aviation, Austral- ia had issued an airworthiness advisory in 1968, finding a similar situation with the Piper PA 32 series readily removable rear seats, which were found to disengage at forward accelerations of only 3 to 3.8 g. It was recommended that seat belts be firmly fastened across unoccupied seats to keep them from becoming detached in an emergency landing (191). Another problem relates to the limited availability of upper torso restraint in the civil aircraft fleet. As noted previously, upper torso restraint is not yet standard equipment for all occupants in U.S. aircraft in production and, unless provision is made for retroactive requirements, it may be many years before a significant proportion of aircraft occupants has such protection available. Section 23.785(g) of the Federal Aviation Regulations, as amended August 1, 1969, Amend- ment 23-7, presently requires small civil air- planes, for which applications for type certi- ficates under Part 23 are filed after September lU, 1969, "to provide each occupant with pro- tection from head injury, either (l) by a safety belt and shoulder harness that will prevent the head from contacting any injurious object; or, (2) by a safety belt plus an energy absorbing rest that will support the arms, shoulder, head, and spine; or, (3) by a safety belt plus the elimination of any injurious object within striking radius of the head. 11 ( lU ) However, this requirement presently applies only to aircraft newly certified after September lU, 19^9, and thus is not required on any of those aircraft presently in production under earlier type certificates. Since new models of aircraft may be produced for long periods of time under an original type certificate, large segments of to- day* s general aviation aircraft will not be in- cluded even in the proposed new crashworthiness and restraint standards. Further, unlike auto- motive vehicles with an average life span of about 12 years, aircraft may continue in opera- tion in excess of 20 years. Thus, in order for new upper torso restraint requirements to pro- duce any observable significant effect, they would have to apply retroactively to earlier certified aircraft as well. An analogy may be made to automotive vehicles, which were required to have .upper torso restraints installed after January 1, I968. Yet, it will require another three years of attrition of older model vehicles before more than 90? of the vehicles on the highway are so equipped. With aircraft, par- ticularly in light of the historical precedence of the time involved in implementing regulatory amendments, significant coverage of the flying population may well require many years unless retroactive requirements are adopted. CONCLUSIONS : (1) Current estimates of the number of fatalities which the use of upper torso res- traint systems could preveht annually in sur- vivable accidents range from 33? to 9^?, with extensive data available from accident studies covering 30 years. (2) Since 1929, there has been only one updating of the original 1000 lb. seat belt strength requirement for civil aircraft. U.S. Civil Aircraft seat belt strength is promulgated on standards (NAS 802) last revised 27 years ago (1950). The FAA in TS0-C22f allows an exception in seat belt assembly strength, reducing the I95O standard (U.l.l) by 50?. Current FAA belt strength standards for all categories of civil aircraft are 1500 lb. in tension load and 1.9 times rated strength (loop load strength of 2850 lbs.) in a static test. The 1950 NAS (FAA ISO 22f) belt strength requirements remain the same in 1977 as 25 years earlier, when found inadequate in NACA tests, and despite Australian</page><page sequence="25">RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 659 findings of 10% failure in serious accidents. (3) At present there are no FAA standards or tests required for upper torso restraint or for inertia reels; NAS 802 and TS0-C22f relate only to lap belts . (k) There is no requirement at present for upper torso restraint protection for all civil aircraft occupants, even in newly certified air- craft. After U years, the FAA is still studying the proposed 1973 amendment 23.785(g) that would require protection of each occupant in a forward facing seat "by a safety belt and shoulder har- ness . " (5) Although strongly recommended in the FAA crashworthiness guide, and required by federal standards for automotive vehicles, there is no requirement as yet for dynamic tests of civil aircraft restraint systems. By compari- son, the present static tests were outmoded in the automotive industry over a decade ago. (6) No consideration in present standards has been given to infant and child occupant pro- tection, although FMVSS 213 and SAE ARP's pro- vide guidance. Further dynamic tests of pro- duction child restraints are required under aircraft crash environments. (7) The ultimate inertia force require- ments of Part 23, 25, 27 and 29.56I are totally inconsistent and outdated for realistic occu- pant restraint protection, since human tolerance data indicate they are far below occupant capa- bilities. In effect, we have "Uo g occupants riding in 20 g aircraft protected only by 9 g restraint/seat systems." (8) The need is evident for changes in the FAA standards in Part 23, 25, 27, and 29.561 to consider "moderate to severe survivable acci- dents" rather than the present undefined "minor crash landing" design criteria. (9) Civil aircraft restraint standards and test requirements are below comparable re- quirements for automobiles, comparable military aircraft, and recommendations of other federal and professional organizations, and far below the state-of-the-art technology. (10) It is within the state-of-the-art to provide protection to occupants of small air- planes (Part 23), air transports (Part 25), and normal (Part 27) and air transport helicopters (Part 29) Tar above the minimum standards now provided in such aircraft. Among promising new restraint systems is the NASA-Ames Integral Pas- senger Seat, reportedly capable of protecting the occupant against vertical impacts some ten times more severe than specified in current FAR standards .

Part 37.132 Safety Belts - TS0-C22f § 37.132 Safety Belts-' TSO-C22Í. (a) Applicability - (1) Minimum per - formance standards. This technical standard order prescribes the minimum performance standards that safety belts must meet in order to be Identified with the applicable TSO marking. New models of safety belts that are to be so identified and that are manufactured on or after May 1, 1972, must meet the standards set forth in National Aircraft Standards (NAS) Specification 802 revised May 15, 1950, with the exceptions covered in sub- paragraph (2) of this paragraph. NAS 802 is incorporated by reference herein in accordance with 5 UJ3.C. 552(a) (1) and § 37.23 and is available as indicated in S 37.23. Additionally, NAS 802 may be examined at any FAA regional office of the Chief, Engineering and Manufactur- ing Branch (or in the case of the West- ern Region, the Chief, Aircraft Engineer- ing Division) , and may be obtained from the National Standards Association, 1321 14th Street NW., Washington, DC 20005, at a cost of three (3) dollars. Belts ap- proved under prior issuances of this sec- tion may continue to be manufactured under the earlier provisions. (2) Exceptions, (i) For the purpose of this section the strengths specified in section 4.1.1 of NAS 802 shall he 1.500 pounds and 3,000 pounds instead of 3,- 000 pounds and 6,000 pounds. (ii) In complying with section 4.3.2.2 of NAS 802, the curved portion of the test form may be padded with no more than one inch of medium density sponge rub- ber, or equivalent, and covered with suit- able fabric to simulate a person's body and clothing. (iii) Synthetic material webbing which is not subject to loss of strength due to the influence of humidity, tem- perature variations, etc., need not be subjected to the first six-month retest- lng period specified in section 3.1.2 of NAS 802. Retesting at succeeding six- month periods will be necessary if the belt manufacturer is unable to ascertain by means of textile data available to him that the webbing is unaffected by ambient storage conditions for the pe- riod of time involved. (iv) In complying with section 4.1.3 of NAS 802, the two-inch webbing width shall be considered a nominal width. Thus, after considering all manufactur- ing processes as are necessary such as weaving, dyeing, mildew proofing, flame resistance and abrasion treatments, a webbing width of l^« inches inch shall be acceptable. iv) The slots or openings in the hard- ware for attachment of the safety belt webbing shall not be less than two inches. (vi) In lieu of compliance with para- graphs 1.1.1, 3.1.4, and 4.3.1.1 of NAS 802, the webbing and all other materials used in the belt assembly must comply with the fire protection provisions of S 25.853 (b-2) of this chapter. (b) Marking, (l) Each half of safety belt shall be marked in accord- ance with § 37.7 except that the weight required by paragraph (d) (3) of § 37.7 need not be shown and the rated strength of the safety belt assembly shall be shown, and (2) In lieu of the marking require- ment in paragraph (d) (4) of § 37.7 the date of manufacture is required. The serial number may also be marked on the belt but not in lieu of the date of manufacture. (c) Data requirements. (1) The manufacturer shall maintain a current file on complete design data. (2) The manufacturer shall maintain a current file of complete data describ- ing the inspection and test procedures applicable to his product. (See para- graph (d) of this section.) (3) One copy of the following shall be furnished to the Chief, Engineering and Manufacturing Branch, Flight Standards Division, Federal Aviation Ad- ministration, in the region in which the manufacturer is located: A drawing of the complete belt assembly showing the manufacturer's part numbers together with a notation indicating the minimum webbing strength specified by the belt manufacturer. If the test belts were tested to destruction, the average strength of the belt assembly should also be indicated. (d) Quality control. Each safety belt shall be produced under a quality con- trol system, established by the manufac- turer, which will assure that each belt is in conformity with the requirements of this standard. This system shall be de- scribed in the data required under para- graph (c)(2) of this section. The Ad- ministrator shall be permitted to make such inspections and tests at the manu- facturer's facility as may be necessary to determine compliance with the require- ments of this standard. [Doc.

(b) The following points are of general significance: (1) Many survivable accidents are "fatal" because of insufficient design consideration when mocking up the cabin and its installation.

SNYDER 3.386-1 (b) (2) Civil Aeronautics Manual 3 (2) The torso is rarely exposed to dangerous injury when the safety belts hold and control wheels provide reasonable support for the chest. (3) Fractures of the extremities occur in severe crashes but are not normally regarded as dangerous injuries. » (4) Head injuries are the principal cause of crash fatalities. Increased protection for the head can be provided by elimination, shield- ing, or redesigning of elements of the cabin which permit solid head blows in a crack-up, such as turn-overs during a bad landing. (c) In view of the fact that injuries and fatalities in many mod- erate and severe accidents are purely mechanical results of poor cock- pit design, the following guide rules for design are suggested: (1) Typical injurious objects, from the standpoint of crash in- jury, are listed as follows: (i) Those which present a hard surface and are so attached or have sufficient mass to produce a severe impact when struck by the head or other vulnerable part of the body as 1t swings forward under the specified inertia forces. (ii) Those which present corners, knobs, or similar projections which are likely to penetrate a vulnerable Dart of the body, even when the impact forces are not as high as in case (a). (2) A flat or curved sheet metal panel which will dent upon im- pact by the head is not considered dangerous, whereas a magnetic compass case having appreciable mass and a rigid mounting might cause fatal head injuries. (3) Heavy transverse braces or other structures immediately be- hind a light instrument, panel have changed many accident reports from "Instrument panel depressed six inches by pilot's head" to "Fatal head in- jury; depressed fracture of the skull." Pilot's chances can be greatly improved by spacing solid braces several inches behind the ductile skirt of an instrument panel. (4) The solid tubing used as a backrest of the front seats of tan- dem aircraft is a set-up for excessive head injury. The suggestion has been made that backs of forward seats be allowed to pivot forward so that the head of the occupant of the rearward seat would not contact the solid members when the body pivots about the belt. (5) Panels should be smooth, with top edge curved in a substantial radius.

(7) In personal aircraft, every consideration should be given to holding the body by adequate safety belt installations, and by the support which can be provided in control wheels and instrument panels. The present "1000 pound" safety belts have failed in a high percentage of accidents without causing internal injuries or bruising of the hips. In failing, they have exposed the pilot to excessive injuries. (8) Control wheels should be designed to provide broad areas of support for the chest.

SNYDER APPENDIX C CRASHWORTHINESS PROPOSED CHANGES ? AS PUBLISHED IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER (38F.R. 2985) ON JANUARY 31, 1973. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration [14 CFR Parts 23, 91] [Docket No. 10162; Notice 73-1] CRASHWORTHINESS FOR SMALL AIRPLANES Notice off Proposed Rule Making The Federal Aviation Administration is considering amending Part 23 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to require on all small civil airplanes for which applications for type certificates under Part 23 are filed after the effective date of the proposed amendment, the instal- lation of shoulder harnesses and that cabin and flight crew compartment in- teriors be designed to protect occupants from injury caused by contact with in- terior objects. In addition, the FAA Is considering amending Part 91 to require the Installation of shoulder harnesses on all small civil airplanes manufactured after 1 year from the effective date of the proposed amendment, and on small civil airplanes manufactured prior to that date if they have structural pro- visions for the attachment of shoulder harnesses, and to require occupants of seats equipped with shoulder harnesses to use the shoulder harnesses during takeoff and landing. Interested persons are invited to par- ticipate In the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should Identify the docket number and be submitted in du- plicate to the Federal Aviation Adminis- tration, Office of the General Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket, AOC-24, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, D.C. 20591. All communications received on or before April 30. 1973, will be con- sidered by the Administrator before tak- ing action upon the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in the light of comments re- ceived. All comments will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, In' the rules docket, for exami- nation by interested persons. Section 23.785(g) of the Federal Avia- tion Regulations, as amended August 1, 1969, Amendment 23-7, requires small civil airplanes for which applications for type certificates under Part 23 are filed after September 14, 1969, to provide each occupant with protection from head injury either (1) by a safety belt and shoulder harness that will prevent the head from contacting any injurious ob- ject, or; (2) by a safety belt plus an en- ergy absorbing rest that will support the arms, shoulders, head, and spine, or; (3) by a safety belt plus the elimination of any injurious object within striking radius of the head. Subsequent to the adoption of Amend- ment 23-7 the FAA has continued its review of the very complex area of oc- cupant restraint and crashworthiness of small airplanes. The FAA has also re- ceived suggestions concerning areas in which the protection of occupants from injury in a crash or emergency landing might be improved, Including recom- mendations by the National Transporta- tion Safety Board (NTSB) . In addition, Mr. Ralph Nader filed a petition with the FAA requesting the institution of rule- making to Improve the crs|shworthiness of small aircraft. In disposing of that pe- tition the FAA advised that it was in the process of developing proposals concern- ing shoulder harness and occupant re- straints and the improvement of the de- sign of cabin interiors which would be included in a notice of proposed rule making. This notice takes into account the recommendations made by the NTSB and by Mr. Nader concerning require- ments for shoulder harnesses and cabin interior design. After evaluating the data and recom- mendations received and upon consid- eration of the type certification require- ments for small airplanes, the FAA be- lieves that additional crash protection is needed for occupants of small airplanes type certificated under Part 23, and pro- poses herein to amend S 23.785(g) to require that each occupant of those air- planes be protected from head injury when he experiences the inertia forces prescribed In (23.561(b)(2) in a for- ward facing seat (0* to 18* angle with tho vertical plane containing the air- plane rent orline) or in a sideward facing seat (more than 18*) by a safety bolt and shoulder harness. In add ttton,a sideward facing seat that Is angled towaitl the rear of the airplane would be required to have an energy absorbing rest that would sup- port the arms, shoulders, head, and spine. A rearward facing scat (0* to 18*) would be required to have a safety belt and an energy absorbing rest, but not a shoulder harness since the seat would prevent an occupant from pitching forward in the event of a crash. Furthermore, the FAA believes that, in order to provide the intended crash impact protection for flight crewmembers, each flight crew- member's shoulder harness should be fastened at all times. Therefore, It Is pro- posed to add a new (,23.785dl) that would require that shoulder harness in- stallations at flight crewmember stations permit a crewmember, when seated at his station, with his safety belt and shoulder harness fastened, to perform all func- tions necesary for flight operations. In addition, the FAA believes that there should be provisions to prevent shoulder harnesses and safety belts, when not in use, from interfering with the operation of the airplane or with rapid eeress under emergency conditions. Accordingly, it is proposed to add a new ( 23.785(1) that would require that a means be provided to secure safety belts and shoulder harnesses when not in use. While the proposed shoulder harness requirements should reduce the probabil- ity of occupant injury in small airplanes, the FAA believes that further protection should be provided in the area surround- ing each seat within striking* distance of the occupant's head, torso, and flailing arms and legs. Therefore, it is proposed to add a new ( 23.785 (J) that would re- quire that this area (including interior walls, the Instrument panel, control wheels, pedals, and seats) be free of sharp edges, protuberances, and hard areas. Section 23.1307 is being amended edi- torially to delete the requirement for a safety belt for each occupant as re- dundant because ( 23.785 presently re- quires a safety belt for each occupant. The foregoing proposed amendments would be applicable only to small civil airplanes for which applications for type certification under Part 23 are filed after the effective date of the amendments. However, the FAA believes that, to the ¡extent feasible and reasonable, small civil airplanes already in service should also be equipped with shoulder harnesses. Many small civil airplanes presently in service have structural provisions (tie- down points) for the attachment of shoulder harnesses and the installation of shoulder harnesses in these airplanes should not present any significant prob- lem. However, there are a number of small civil airplanes now in service that cannot readily be fitted with shoulder harnesses since the necessary attach- ment points were not included In the design of the airplane. The FAA believes, further, that it would be feasible and not unreasonably burdonsome, for small civil airplane manufacturers to provido shoulder harness attachment points on airplanes being constructed under existing type certificates so that airplanes manufac- tured after the effective date of this amendment could be equipped with shoulder harnesses. The date of manu« facture of an airplane, for purposes of tho proposed rules, would bo the date the inspection acceptance records reflect that the airplane is complete and meets the FAA approved type design data. Accord- ingly, it is proposed to amend SS 91.33 and 91.39 to prohibit, after 1 year after the effective date of this proposed amendment, the operation of such small civil airplanes with standard category and restricted category TJ.8. airworthi- ness certificates unless they have an approved shoulder harness installed (for each occupant except an occupant of a rearward facing seat specified in ( 23.785 (g) (2) ) that is designed to protect the occupant from injury when the occupant experiences the ultimate Inertia forces, specified In I 23.561 (b) (2) . This regula-</page><page sequence="45">RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 679 tlon would not apply to airplanes that were manufactured prior to 1 year after the effective date of any final rule based on this proposed amendment and that do not have structural provisions for the attachment of shoulder harnesses. The proposal would require that a placard be Installed on those airplanes stating that shoulder harnesses are not required In order to assure that this Information is available to the pilots of these air- planes. It Is also proposed to amend §8 91.7 and 91.14 to require each occu- pant of a seat equipped with a shoulder harness to fasten his shoulder harness during takeoff and landing, and in the case of a flight crewmember, at all times while he Is at his station. The PAA has also received suggestions from Mr. Nader and the NTSB concern- ing other areas in which the protection of occupants from injury In a crash or emergency landing might be improved. In this connection It was suggested that the regulations be amended to require higher Impact "g" force levels than are now prescribed, to require that the cock- pit or cabin structure remain intact under those impact forces, to require the dynamic testing of seats, and to require further means to reduce potential igni- tion Sources associated with accidents. Although the FAA's basic research and development programs and the data and recommendations submitted by those interested persons indicate possible fu- ture courses of action with regard to upgrading the crashworthiness of small airplanes in those areas, the information presently available is not sufficient to support rule-making action. The PAA is continuing its investigations in those areas and appropriate rule-making action will be initiated when sufficient data is available to provide a basis for rulemaking. In consideration of the foregoing, H Is proposed to amend Parts 23 and 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: 1. Section 23.785 would be amended by amending the title and paragraplis (b) and (g) and by adding new paragraphs &lt;h), (i), and (J) to read as follows: S 23.70.7 Sen U, berth*, «afe ty belt*, and harne**e*. ♦ • • • • (b) Each scat, berth, safety belt, and harness must be approved. • • • * • ig) Each occupant must be protected from head injury when he experiences the inertia forces prescribed in fi 23.501 (b)(2) In- (1) A forward facing seat (0" to 18' angle with the vertical plane containing the airplane centerline) by a safety belt and shoulder harness that is designed to prevent the head from contacting any injurious object. (2) A rearward facing seat &lt;0* to 18# angle with the vertical plane containing the airplane centerline) by a safety belt and an energy absorbing rest that is de- signed to support the arms, shoulders, head, and spine. (3) A sideward facing seat (more than and 18° angle with the vertical plane con- taining the airplane centerline) by a safety belt and shoulder harness that will prevent the head from contacting any in- jurious object. In addition, sideward fac- ing seats that are angled toward the rear of the airplane must have an energy absorbing rest that is designed to sup- port the arms, shoulders, head, and spine. (h) The shoulder harness Installation at each flight crewmember station must permit the crewmember, when seated and with his safety belt and shoulder harness fastened, to perform all func- tions necessary for flight operations. (i) There must be a means to secure each safety belt and shoulder harness, when not in use, so as to prevent inter- ference with the operation of the air- plane and with rapid egress in an emer- gency. (J) The cabin area surrounding each seat, including the structure, interior walls, instrument panel, control wheel, pedals, and seats, within striking dis- tance of the occupant's head, torso, arms, and legs (with the safety belt fastened), must be free of potentially injurious ob- jects, sharp edges, protuberances, and hard surfaces. If energy absorbing design or devices are used to meet this require- ment, they must protect the occupant from injury when the occupant experi- ences the ultimate inertia forces pre- scribed in 5 23.561(b) (2). 2. Section 23.1307 would be amended by deleting present paragraph (a) and redesignating present paragraph (b) as follows: S 23*1307 Miscellaneous equipment* The following equipment is required miscellaneous equipment: (a) A master switch arrangement. (b) An adequate source of electrical energy. (o) Electrical protective devices. 3. Section 91.7 would be amended by amending paragraph (b) and adding a new paragraph (c) to read as follows: § 91.7 Might crewniemhcrs at stations* • • • • # (b) Keep his safety belt fastened while at his station. (c) After 1 year after the effective date of this amendment) in a U.S. regis- tered small civil airplane, if the seat at his station is equipped with a shoulder harness, keep the shoulder harness fastened while at his station. 4. Section 91.14 would be amended by amending the title and by amending paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as follows: 8 91. I t Fastening of safety belts nn«l shoulder harnesses* (a) Unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator - (1) No pilot may take off or land a U.S. registered aircraft (except an air- ship) unless the pilot in command of that aircraft ensures that - (1) Each person on board that aircraft has been instructed in the proper use of occupant restraint provisions. (li) Each person on board that air- craft has been notified to fasten his safety belt. (ili) Each person on board that air- craft occupying a seat equipped with a shoulder harness has been notified to fasten his shoulder harness. (iv) At each unoccupied seat, the safety belt and shoulder harness, if in- stalled, are secured so as not to interfere with the operation of the aircraft and with rapid egress of occupants in an emergency. (2) During the takeoff and landing of U.S. registered civil aircraft (except air- ships), each person on board that air- craft must occupy a seat or berth with a safety belt properly secured about him. However, a person who has not reached his second birthday may be held by an adult who is occupying a seat or berth, and a person on board for the purpose of engaging in sport parachuting may use the floor of the aircraft as a seat. (3) During the takeoff and landing of a U.S. registered civil aircraft (except an airship) , each person on board that air- craft occupying a seat equipped with a shoulder harness must properly secure the shoulder harness about him. (b) This section does not apply to operations conducted under Parts 121, 123, or 127 of this chapter. Paragraphs (a) (2) and (a) (3) of this section do not apply to persons subject to 5 91.7. 5. Section 91.33 would be amended by adding a new paragraph (b) (13) to read as follows:</page><page sequence="46">680 R. G.

It is not the purpose of this document to specify design methods or mechanisms to be used in accomplishing the objectives of this document or to re- commend specific test methods to verify performance of the system. 2.0 LIMITATIONS - This ARP is applicable only to those active restraint systems such as conventional webbing strap devices. Advanced systems, such as passive restraints, air cushions, rigid load distribution systems, etc., are not considered by this ARP. ARP 1318, General Aviation Seat Design, should be consulted to assure compatibility of restraint system and seating system configurations. 3.0 INTRODUCTION - A restraint system (which may include seat belt/shoulder harness systems) comprises all components of the occupant restraining device, exclusive of the seat, couch or berth structure. However, since the seat normally assumes the function of providing restraint against crash loads imposed from the bottom and rear of the aircraft and of absorbing rebound energy of the occupant resulting from restraint elastic properties, attention should be given to ARP 1318 to assure seat design compatible with the objectives of this restraint system ARP. Consideration should also be given to details of cabin interior, seat adjustment range, and restraint structural anchorage location, all of which can modify performance required of the restraint system. Particular concern should be given to designs incorporating seats which deform (absorb energy) during a crash to assure that the de- formation does rot alter the occupant/restraint relationship and increase injury potential. 3.1 Restraint systems are provided for the protection of occupants of aircraft during routine takeoffs and landings, turbulent flight, emergency conditions (such as intentional ditchings and crash-landings) and unexpected crash conditions of a survivable nature. Restraint integrity should be maintained through crash conditions having multiple impacts. February 28, 1975</page><page sequence="54">688 R- G. SNYDER Occupant Restraint Systems (Active) for General Aviation Aircraft (cont'd) 3.2 A restraint system's primary function is to safely retain the occu- pant in his seat, couch or berth and prevent secondary impact between the occupant and the cabin interior, without, in itself, endangering the occupant during or immediately after an incident or accident. 3.3 To encourage constant use during routine flight, the restraint system should provide a high degree of comfort, ease of adjustment, and be easily donned, removed and stowed convenient for ready access. 3.4 Requirements of FAA FAR's and Technical Standard Orders for occupant restraint systems should be considered as minimum requirements, limited by the necessary condition that they be applicable to any general con- figuration. Specific configurations of seating, cabin interiors, airframe design or operational application may generate more stringent requirements for the occupant restraint system. 4.0 RECOMMENDATIONS - The recommendations contained herein apply primarily to restraints for forward-facing seating positions; however, design of restraint systems should take into account the fact that crash loads may be applied from any direction; i.e., combinations of forward, lateral and spinal loadings, and may be in excess of those specified in current FAR's. The following criteria are recommended: 4.1 Upper torso restraints shall not be used in the absence of an appropriate lower torso restraint. 4.2 If the restraint system is attached to the seat, the strength of the restraint system/seat combination should not be less than the strength of the seat/aircraft attachment, even after degradation due to environ- mental exposure. 4.3 If the restraint system is attached directly to the aircraft structure (by-passing the seat) the ultimate load capacity of the restraint system/ a ire ra ft attachment should be sufficiently high as to insure integrity of the restraint-to-aircraft-load-path even after seat failure. 4.4 Each occupant should be provided with his own individual restraint system; shared systems are not considered acceptable. 4.4.1 For criteria relating to special restraint devices for small children, see ARP 766, Restraint Device for Small Children. 4.5 In the absence of crash environmental data or test requirements for the specific application under consideration, the system should at least provide restraint against the static load vectors shown in Figure 1, acting independently or concurrently, whichever is most critical. February 28, 1975</page><page sequence="55">RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 689 Occupant Restraint Systems (Active) for General Aviation Aircraft (cont'd) 4.6 Elongation of any portion of the restraint system (other than that specifically designed for controlled energy absorption), due to impact loading, should be held to a minimum to provide maximum benefit from crush characteristics of the aircraft structure and to reduce potential for secondary impact between the occupant and the aircraft interior. 4.7 The attachment point(s) of the upper torso restraint systems (or the harness guide, if used) should be located, insofar as possible, to min- imize lateral movement of the upper torso during sideward deceleration of the aircraft, to avoid discomfort due to neck chafing by the restraint, to assure proper location of the restraint over shoulder, and to reduce elastic deformation of the system under dynamic load. 4.8 Integrity of the restraint system should not be compromised by deform- ation of the attachment structure that can be reasonably expected in a survivable crash. 4.9 The material composing those portions of the restraint system in con- tact with the occupant's body should be pliable (with the exception of necessary buckle or adjuster hardware), and should have no sharp cutting edges. Sharp discontinuities between component widths should be eliminated wherever possible. Lower torso restraint material should not be less than two inches in width; upper torso material should not be less than 1-1/2 inches in width. 4.10 Restraint loads should be distributed by the system so as to apply minimal pressure on vital body areas, exploiting, as much as possible, the strength and resiliency of the heavily muscled and/or skeletal structure of the body, such as the pelvis, rib cage, and shoulders. Heavy restraint loads should not be applied against the abdominal area. Excessive compression, torsion or bending loads should not be induced on the occupant's spine because of the restraint system configuration. 4.11 The restraint system should provide necessary upper torso freedom of movement during normal flight as is required for all necessary flight duties under all operating conditions. 4.12 The lower torso portion of the restraint system should maintain firm, but comfortable, contact of the buttocks with the seat, so as to re- duce unwanted movement, regardless of the direction of crash loading or of gust (rough air) accelerations. During crash loading of the restraint system by the occupant, the resultant load vector should cross the iliac crests (hips) between 45 and 55 relative to the compressed plane of the seat cushion as shown in Figure 2. The tendency of the upper torso restraint to displace the lower torso restraint in an upward direction under high dynamic loading conditions must be given special design attention.

SNYDER 4.13 The restraint system should provide freedom from undue fatigue during normal flight over extended periods of time, such as two or more hours of uninterrupted use. 4.14 The buckle, or other such locking-unlocking device, should be minimal in size, lightweight, easily operable by the user in any position of his body with respect to the seat, and should have no sharp cutting edges nor protuberances that might be injurious to the occupant. False latching of the buckle should not be possible. 4.15 The system configuration should be such that the correct method of wear- ing the restraint is obvious to the occupant. The system should be capable of being easily donned and removed by an inexperienced user, and its manner of use, locking, adjustment and unlocking should be ob- vious without the need for printed or verbal instruction. 4.16 If conventional type shoulder harness straps are used in the system, the straps should be instài led so as to prevent their snagging on near-by structures; splices should pass freely through the harness guides or fittings to preclude "false" deceleration/acceleration and subsequent inadvertent locking of the inertia reel (if used). 4.17 When shoulder straps are used in thfe system, they should cross the shoulder to prevent edge chaffing against the neck (see Figure 3.) 4.18 The angle of the shoulder straps to the shoulder should be between 0 and 30 above a line parallel to the longitudinal axis of the air- craft (see Figure 4.) 4.19 If a single diagonal strap type of upper torso restraint is utilized, the strap should cross the chest above the e.g. of the torso (Figure 3) so as to minimize the chance of the shoulders rolling out of the "open" side of the restraint system during accelerations involving a comb- ination of lateral and forward loads. 4.20 When a single diagonal strap type of upper torso restraint is util- ized on a forward-facing seat, the upper part of the strap should preferably cross the "outboard" shoulder-trapezial slope, so as to provide maximum lateral restraint of the upper torso relative to near- by structure. The lower end of the strap should be located near the inboard hip (see Figure 5). 4.21 When a single diagonal chest strap is utilized on a side-facing seat, the upper end of the strap should cross the forward shoulder; the lower end should attach near the "rear" hip (see Figure 5). Side- facing seats are not recommended. 4.22 If an inertia reel or similar dqvice is utilized to maintain contact between the restraint system and the occupant's upper torso during normal movement and activity, the "reel-in" or retraction tension load imposed on the shoulders should be minimal (less than one-half pound).
