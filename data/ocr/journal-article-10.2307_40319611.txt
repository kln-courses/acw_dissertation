<plain_text><page sequence="1">Konstantin Kolenda Truth and Fallibilism One of the unresolved questions about Peirce's account of truth is whether he meant to provide its meaning or its criteria. Recent scholar- ship offers differing interpretations. Susan Haack claims that Peirce confused the meaning of truth with its criteria.1 H. S. Thayer, on the other hand, defends the view that Peirce meant to offer merely a definition, not the criterion of truth.2 In my discussion of Haack's paper, I have argued that a criterion would have to provide the test of a belief's truth or falsity, and that Peirce's definition of truth makes such a criterion inaccessible.3 According to him, truth is that belief which would be agreed upon if it were subjected to an indefinitely long investigation. Regarding his definition, Peirce says in a letter to Lady Welby: "I only say that that alone is what I call truth. I cannot infallibly know that there is any Truth."4 In other words, Peirce tells us what he means by truth, and he admits the possibility that one may be never in possession of an infallible truth. This shows, it seems to me, that Peirce does not equate meaning and criteria of truth. We know the meaning of truth, but its meaning is such that we cannot use it as a criterion. The distinction between the definition and the criteria of truth helps us to understand Peirce's fallibilism. Fallibilism has to do with our use of criteria to determine any given truth, but at no point does it affect the definition of truth. In other words, we are fallible because in some situations the criteria we apply turn out to be inadequate, and the availability of a correct definition of truth makes it possible for us to discover that our criteria, in such situations, are inadequate. What may mislead us to overlook this important distinction is Peirce's theory of meaning. The pragmatic maxim specifies that a concept, to be meaningful, must pass through the gate of perception. Applying the maxim to the concept of truth, we may wonder how it would affect the distinction between definition and criterion of truth. Both the definition and a criterion of truth must satisfy the pragmatic maxim. And they do, but in different ways. The definition specifies that an indefinitely large number of investigators would take into account their perceptions</page><page sequence="2">252 KONSTANTIN KOLENDA in their verdict. What makes this definition inaccessible as a criterion of truth is its open-endedness: it is to include all potential perceivers and investigators. Since their number is indefinite, the verdict is never in. On the other hand, any adequate criterion of truth must also satisfy perceptual requirements, in the sense that the given truth claim must be borne out by what is uniformly perceived by those who examine the claim. It is here that Peirce's appeal to the test of doubt becomes relevant. When our descriptions and our perceptions match, we reach a resting point. We do not doubt that we see what we sincerely say we see. As Wittgenstein observed: " 'But, if you are certain, isn't it that you are shutting your eyes in face of doubt?' - They are shut."5 When we are confidently making a factual statement, we are debarred from indefinitely revising that statement - even to be understood at all, we must start with something that neither we nor our hearers can doubt. Peirce and Wittgenstein were not alone in seeing an important con- nection between truth claims and doubt. Consider the following passage: The historical and judicial search for truth is the search for evidence which will set doubt at rest. The philosophical endeavor to characterize truth in general has tended to become the endeavor to characterize that which in general sets doubt at rest; and finally at rest. This Peircean-sounding view was expressed by P. F. Strawson.6 As Peirce was clearly aware, the way perception enters into the confirmation of our beliefs is rather complicated. There must be a reference to perception, but not to naked, "neat" perception. As his detailed account shows, a perceptual situation for Peirce is a complex affair; he even coined a special term for it: percipuum. Percipuum is an umbrella term covering two components: percept and perceptual judgment. The latter is a logical interpretant and is of the nature of a sign. To be a sign or concept is to point to certain conceptual conse- quences, which, of course, in turn, point to further perceptual conse- quences. This circumstance introduces a coherence requirement into our descriptions of phenomena. The upshot of this requirement is that through perceptual judgments we are brought into a wider circle of perceptions and concomitantly into a wider circle of interpretants or signs.</page><page sequence="3">Truth and Fallibilism 2 53 Given Peirce's full account of perception, let us now ask: which beliefs are true? Answer: I ought to accept beliefs which 1) are borne out by my perceptions, and 2) produce interpretants, or generate signs, which, in turn, are borne out or are not disappointed by further per- ceptions. This, however, is not enough, for the simple reason that in order to be firm and indubitable, my perceptions and logical inter- pretants ought to agree with the perceptions and logical interpretants of others. Should I find my perceptions contradicted by those of others, unless I suspect hoax or deceit, I would have reason to doubt my own perceptions - the irritation of doubt would be unavoidable. The requirement that inquiry be public is not extrinsic - it belongs to the very meaning of inquiry, which demands that my perceptions and judgments should square with others. What happens in one laboratory should be borne out by and must not conflict with what happens in others. Envisage now the following situation. Your description of a phenome- non 1) is borne out by perceptions, yours and everyone else's, and 2) coheres with all other descriptions, conceptually and empirically con- nected with that phenomenon. Can you say that your belief is true? To answer this question we need more than just the definition of truth. The definition states the ideal conditions for determining the truth, and hence it is not available under less than ideal conditions. And that means that it is not available under any actual conditions. But if, in addition to the definition, we also have adequate relevant criteria, the answer to our question is yes. We can say that the belief characterized above is true, because it satisfies the applicable criteria of truth, which criteria, of course, do not call for an unlimited scope of confirming reports provided by an unlimited community of investigators. It is important to note that our distinction does not entail two conceptions of truth - short run and long run. To say that a belief is true is 1) to indicate that it satisfies the relevant criteria, and 2) to let us under- stand that we have no reason to think that these conditions will fail to hold even if the number of investigators were to increase indefi- nitely. In other words, we can make truth claims on the basis of adequate criteria which are consonant with the definition of truth. Do we make such claims? Peirce thought that we do. For, he said that ". . . upon innumerable questions, we have already reached the final opinion."7 Here we may include such indubitable propositions as those describing everyday familiar objects, or, for instance, my saying</page><page sequence="4">254 KONSTANTIN KOLENDA that I am now in Houston, or any of so-called eternal sentences, or first-person reports of sensations. Of all of them we may be certain that their truth-value will not be reversed no matter how long anyone wished to inquire into them.8 Under some circumstances, we are in the position to claim that all the relevant data and their logical interpretants are in. There are, then, not two kinds of truth for Peirce - short-run and long-run. Every truth is covered and governed by the regulative ideal expressed in the definition of truth. In many instances we have no reason to think that further criteria and tests are necessary to arrive at final truth. Here we may say that the truth we actually have coincides with the ideal. It is important to note that for Peirce a perceptual judgment is an index of a percept; it does not merely correspond to it. He extends this conclusion to other factual propositions. The interpretant of a true proposition "represents the proposition to be a genuine Index of a real object . . . for an Index involves the existence of its Object."9 Peirce also says that "Truth is the conformity of a representamen to its object, its object, ITS object, mind you."10 These passages indicate that according to Peirce there is no epistemological gap between a true belief and its object (as there is no epistemological gap between percept and perceptual judgment), and that often things are the way we describe them. To say that our description merely corresponds to the way things are is to allow for the possibility that this relationship of cor- respondence could always be analyzed further. But why stop here? Why not ask how that new analysis or description corresponds to what it describes? Peirce sees no reason to open the door to this kind of infinite regress. His preference for the word "index" may call to mind Wittgenstein's picture theory, but it seems that for Wittgenstein there still was a correspondence of the elements of the proposition to the elements of the depicted fact. For Peirce, the known fact show itself, not its elements, in the true proposition. As a man of science, Peirce was primarily interested in the frontier area of knowledge, in its growing edge. Beliefs referring to routine phenomena are of little interest to the scientist. Quite understandably, he finds such true beliefs trivial. As Peirce says, the value of perceptual facts in themselves is small.11 Perceptions have to be, related to our purposes, and the chief purpose of the scientist is the advancement of knowledge. On the broad front of this advance toward truth, fallibility is neither surprising nor rare; in fact, it is rampant. The frontier</page><page sequence="5">Truth and Fallibilism 255 dimension of science is shot through with grey areas in which our perceptions do not give us uniform verdicts and our conceptual analyses and logical interpretants do not add up to a coherent picture. But all of this does not affect the definition of truth; it rather shows that the outcome of applying the criteria conflicts with that definition, thus showing forth their inadequacy. Peirce's fallibilism intends to alert us to the possibility that our criteria of what we claim to be true may need to be revised in the light of further experience. This realization is not equivalent to saying, as some interpreters have said (Susan Haack, for instance), that we are fallible because we are apt to hold false beliefs. The point is that some of our beliefs are more apt to be false than others, and we usually know which are which. Our suspicions are generated by a doubt whether the criteria we are applying are adequate or sufficient. For some beliefs it would be false to say that they are apt to be false, although, to be sure, they may not be among our more interesting beliefs. Among the central criteria of veridical perception are normal eyesight and optimal lighting conditions, but on some occasions we may wonder whether they are enough or trustworthy. However, in the absence of any clues that we need to reexamine the adequacy of our criteria, we are entitled to make truth claims based on them. The confidence with which we often report our perceptual judgments squares with Peirce's contention that the aim of inquiry is to produce indubitable beliefs. Such beliefs go beyond the mere correspondence between propositions and states of affairs. In offering his account of inquiry, Peirce took note of the fact that we cannot drive a wedge between propositions that are true and those that we believe to be true - they are too intimately connected for that to be possible. Professor Ayer supported Peirce's conclusion on this matter by observing that one could not rationally carry out the assignment of writing down on two sheets of paper a list of true propositions and a list of proposi- tions which we firmly believed, "with the proviso that the lists were to be mutually exclusive."12 In terms of his phenomenology, the secondness of the fact is reflected in the thirdness of knowing that fact, but third- ness does not correspond to secondness. Secondness, as he puts it, can be prescinded from thirdness, but not thirdness from secondness.13 Percepts can be prescinded from perceptual judgments, but not the other way around. This is why "Index involves the existence of its object," existence for Peirce being secondness par excellence.</page><page sequence="6">256 KONSTANTIN KOLENDA Here, I believe, in the desire to get beyond mere correspondence, is one of the sources of Peirce's metaphysical realism. That realism is reflected in his pragmatic maxim and in his theory of truth. He was enough of a Kantian, however, not to expect more than a human, anthropomorphic truth. Peirce candidly confesses that in proposing his hypothesis the scientist is governed by certain unavoidable anthropo- morphic constraints. It will be asked whether he will not have a shocking leaning toward anthropomorphic conceptions. I fear I must confess that he will be inclined to see an anthropomorphic, or even a zoomorphic, if not a physiomorphic element in all our conceptions. What we think is not unrelated to what we can do - here is the key to the pragmatic turn in epistemology. In action, Peirce continues his line of thought, "logical energy returns to the uncontrolled and un- criticizable parts of the mind."14 Thought moves within the compass of our general intentions and purposes, and these are constrained by what confronts us in perception, or in the general facts of nature, including human nature. It is true that the descriptions we give are restricted to our, human, purposes. But such restrictions do not constitute a cognitive drawback, an epistemological imperfection. Sometimes the insistence on applying more refined tests and criteria is wrong-headed. Beliefs describable as short-term truths should be subjected to further tests, but not all beliefs are thus describable. The claim that a line is straight is not undermined by the possibility of looking at it through a microscope. Here the "long-run" move is irrelevant. The distinction between short-run and long-run is not always applicable. It is natural for those cases in which we have good reasons to suspect that our judgment is provisional and must be circumspect. It does not make sense to say: In the short run this is a book, but in the long run it may turn out to be something else. If it does turn out to be a disguised whiskey container, the mistake is not due to the fallibility of the perceiver's judgment, but to the prankster who used the covers of books for his liquor cabinet. No cognitive imperfection is at work here, but only our ability to deceive and the capacity for being deceived when familiar appearances are purposely manipulated.</page><page sequence="7">Truth and Fallibilism 257 The cases of deliberate deception underscore our distinction between the definition and the criteria of truth. The object of human interven- tion may be to lull us into unsuspectingly accepting normal criteria while manipulating them. The practical joker who transformed his library into a bar is one example, a gambler loading the dice another, and many others come easily to mind. There is a connection between fallibility and gullibility, but they are not identical. Knowing what the governing criteria are and having some control over them enables one to modify them, thus wreaking havoc with normal, rational, justifiable expectations. As Descartes noted, there is no defense against an evil demon who can alter laws of nature at will. To the extent that Peirce's meaphysics admitted the presence of tychism in the universe, it allowed for the possibility that our criteria of truth may turn out inadequate at some points. This metaphysical doctrine is responsible for his statements to the effect that "there are three things we can never hope to attain . . . absolute certainty, absolute exactitude, absolute universality. "1J But even this metaphysical view does not affect Peirce's definition of truth. Should a ty chis tic deviation occur, or should God, to Einstein's distress, play dice with the universe, the occasion on which this occurred would still be determinable by an indefinite community of investigators. This, of course, would include God as well, for if he respected truth he would admit that on that particular occasion he decided what was to happen by throwing (unloaded?) dice. As long as tychist forces are at play, no stable criteria for determining the truth of a given state of affairs are available, the saying of which is almost a tautology. But as long as a given phenomenon or process shows no tychistic elements, we have all the right to make truth claims based on established criteria. Rice University NOTES 1.
