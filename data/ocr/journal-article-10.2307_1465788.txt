<plain_text><page sequence="1">SESSAY On Thinking of God as Serendipitous Creativity Gordon D. Kaufman In my book In Face of Mystery I proposed the concept of "serendipitous creativity" as a metaphor more appropriate for thinking of God today than such traditional image/concepts as creator, lord, and father. In this essay I more fully elaborate and more carefully nuance that concept. It is no longer possible, I argue, to connect in an intelligible way today's scien- tific cosmological and evolutionary understandings of the origins of the universe and the emergence of life (including human life and history) with a conception of God constructed in the traditional anthropomorphic terms. However, the metaphor of creativity-a descendant of the bibli- cal concept of creation, and directly implied in the idea of evolution itself-has resources for constructing a religiously pertinent and mean- ingful modern/postmodern conception of God. In this essay the notion of creativity is explored in connection with the profoundly serendipitous mystery implied in it; with its usefulness in orienting human life today, particularly with respect to contemporary ecological issues; and with its implications for such traditional theological themes as the problem of evil and "God is love." The essay concludes with a brief characterization of what human life and faith would be like if ordered in relation to a God conceived as "serendipitous creativity" instead of a God defined in the more traditional anthropomorphic terms.

It has seemed to me increasingly impossible-in this age of cosmological thinking that emphasizes an understanding of our universe as having come into being in and through a "big bang" some 12 to 15 billion years ago- to make sense of the traditional defining idea of God as "creator of the heavens and the earth." A good many members of the American Acad- emy of Religion have expressed interest in the theological reconstructions on which I have been working, and many have also raised serious ques- tions about my proposals. I am now able to clarify certain ambiguities and other difficulties in my earlier formulations, and in this essay I attempt to refine and amplify some of my central concepts, particularly the concept of "serendipitous creativity." The Journal of the American Academy of Religion is, I think, the best journal in which to make these reflections available to those in religion studies and theology interested in them. Biblical texts have been the most influential source of Christian and other western thinking about God. When those texts were written, the earth and its immediate environment (the "heavens") were regarded as all that existed, the universe; and though this universe was doubtless im- mense to the humans living within it, it was minuscule by today's stan- dards. Under these circumstances it was not implausible to imagine some almighty personal being who existed before and apart from the universe and by all-powerful fiat brought it into being (Gen. 1). Moreover, one could imagine this superpersonal being taking up clay from the ground and forming creatures, including humans, out of it (Gen. 2). Both of these types of creativity were well known to men and women, and it is not sur- prising, therefore, that they should have imagined the universe being brought into existence through acts of this sort. The biblical stories thus supplied an account of an ultimate origin of things and of an ultimate personal power behind all things-God-that still remains remarkably plausible to many. In my view, however, we can no longer continue thinking of God along these lines. What could we possibly be imagining when we attempt to think of God as an all-powerful personal reality existing somehow before and independent of what we today call "the universe"? As far as we know, personal agential beings did not exist, and could not have existed, before billions of years of cosmic evolution of a very specific sort and then fur- ther billions of years of biological evolution also of a very specific sort had transpired. How, then, can we today think of a person-like creator-God as existing before and apart from any such evolutionary developments? What possible content can this more or less traditional idea of God have</page><page sequence="3">Kaufman: On Thinking of God as Serendipitous Creativity 411 for those of us who think of the universe in our modern evolutionary way, according to which no life or consciousness can be imagined apart from the emergence of these very specific and quite extraordinary conditions?' The idea of creativity, however (in contrast with the notion of a cre- ator)-the idea of the coming into being through time of the previously nonexistent, the new, the novel-continues to have considerable plausi- bility today: indeed, it is bound up with the very belief that our cosmos is an evolutionary one in which new orders of reality come into being in the course of exceedingly complex temporal developments.2 In my view, there- fore, those interested in theological reflection and construction can and should continue to work with the idea of creativity (a descendant of the biblical idea of creation), but they should no longer think of this creativ- ity as lodged in a creator-agent (a concept no longer intelligible). There are a number of advantages to this move, though it also presents us with some serious ambiguities and problems.3 In this essay I reflect on some of these, thus elaborating further and nuancing in certain respects what I have heretofore said or written about God as creativity. 1 In many current discussions of religion and science issues by theologians who otherwise seek to take modern evolutionary biology and cosmology seriously, there is a failure to come to terms directly with the problem just sketched here. See, for example, John Polkinghorne's subtle consid- eration of the idea of God's action in the world in his otherwise quite excellent article "Chaos Theory and Divine Action": "The picture is ... of an open future in which both human and divine agency play parts in its accomplishment. Christian theology has, at its best, striven to find a way between two unacceptably extreme pictures of God's relationship to the creation. One is that of the Cosmic Tyrant, who brings everything about by divine will alone. Such a God is the puppet master of the universe. ... The detached God of deism, who simply watches it all happen, is another extreme, unacceptable to Christian thought. We seek a middle way in which God interacts with the creation without over-ruling it.... All that we are attempting to do in the present discussion is to show that one can take with all seriousness all that science tells us about the workings of the world, and still believe in a God who has not left the divine nature so impotent that providence cannot act con- tinuously and consistently with cosmic history" (249). In this article Polkinghorne takes "with all seriousness all that science tells us about the workings of the world" with the exception of a central scientific understanding: that complex features of the world such as conscious intention, purpo- sive action, deliberate creation of artifacts, loving attitudes and behaviors, and the like-all attrib- uted to God from the "big bang" onward in the anthropomorphic model in terms of which his notion of God is constructed--can come into being only after billions of years of complex cosmic, biological, and historical development have provided the necessary conditions for their emergence to occur. This would seem to be a rather important exception to Polkinghorne's (and many oth- ers') claims to take scientific understandings "with all seriousness." 2 As brain scientist Terrence Deacon has observed in his book, The Symbolic Species: The Co- evolution of Language and the Brain, "Evolution is the one kind of process able to produce some- thing out of nothing. ... [A]n evolutionary process is an origination process. ... Evolution is the author of its spontaneous creations" (458). 3 A full discussion of these pros and cons can be found in my book, In Face of Mystery: A Con- structive Theology (1993: chs. see especially 19-22).</page><page sequence="4">412 Journal of the American Academy of Religion I First, let us consider briefly some features of the idea of creativity it- self. It is often assumed that creativity is to be thought of as a sort of force at work in the cosmos, bringing the new into being. Some of the rhetoric in my writing and speaking (including much that was said in In Face of Mystery) suggests this. This sort of thinking in effect just substitutes the notion of force for God, implying that creativity is simply a kind of im- personal-instead of personal and agential-power. To make that sort of claim, however, presupposes that we know more about the emergence of truly new and novel realities than we actually do. The notion of cre- ativity (as I am increasingly thinking of it) is very close to being a syn- onym of the concept of mystery. It differs from "mystery" in that it di- rects attention to the coming into being of the new, whereas "mystery" (when used in a theological context) refers simply to fundamental limits of all human knowledge (Kaufman 1993: 54-69) and carries no such fur- ther meaning. But creativity is profoundly mysterious: as the ancient phrase creatio ex nihilo emphasized, the coming into being of the truly new and novel is not something that we humans understand. We can see this most vividly, perhaps, when we consider the old unanswerable question, Why is there something, not nothing? As Nicolas Berdyaev puts it, "Cre- ation is the greatest mystery of life, the mystery of the appearance of some- thing new that had never existed before and is not deduced from, or gen- erated by, anything" (163). To regard creativity as a kind of "force" is to suggest that we have here a sort of (vague) knowledge of an existing some- thing or other when in fact we do not. All we really see or understand is that new and novel realities have begun to exist in time. There is a seren- dipitous feature in all creativity: "more [happens] than one would have expected, given previously prevailing circumstances, indeed, more than might have seemed possible" (Kaufman 1993: 279).4 In the case of evolv- ing life we see that this occurs through chance variation and selective ad- aptation, but neither of these can properly be reified into "causes" or "forces" (in any ordinary sense of those words) that directly produce the new creation. Creativity happens: this is an absolutely amazing mystery- even though we may in certain cases, for example, with the evolution of life, be able to specify some of the conditions without which it could not happen.5 4For elaboration, see the discussion of the "serendipity of history" in Kaufman 1993: 273-280. 5 In recent theorizing about complexity, as it develops in highly intricate networks of life (and elsewhere), it is argued that changes may reach an unforeseeable "tipping point" where previous organizational patterns break down and new ones begin to emerge, thus bringing into being novel forms. For illuminating discussion of this sort of ongoing creativity in the world, see Taylor: ch. 5.</page><page sequence="5">Kaufman: On Thinking of God as Serendipitous Creativity 413 Precisely because of this close connection with the idea of mystery, "creativity" is a good metaphor for thinking about God. If used properly, it preserves the notion of God as the ultimate mystery of things, a mys- tery that we have not been able to penetrate or dissolve-and likely never will succeed in penetrating or dissolving. This aspect of the notion of cre- ativity draws us into a deeper sensitivity to God-as-mystery than some of our religious traditions did, with their talk of God as the Creator. For this latter concept seemed to imply that we knew the ultimate mystery (God) was really a person-like, agent-like being, one who "decided" to do things, who set purposes and then brought about the realization of those pur- poses-as a potter or sculptor creates artifacts (Gen. 2) or as a poet or king brings order and reality into being through uttering words (Gen. 1). Absent these models of creativity the biblical writers and their successors might never have generated the notion of creatio ex nihilo. But with Dar- win we have learned that significant creativity can be thought of in other ways as well. Indeed, according to the evolutionary theory these sorts of human agential creativity themselves came into being ("were created") as cosmic processes in the course of long stretches of time brought into being certain very complex forms of life. The most foundational kind of creativity (for us today), therefore, appears to be that exemplified in the evolution of the cosmos and of life, rather than that displayed in human purposive activity. Though we can describe the evolutionary model with some precision, it in no way overcomes the most profound mystery at the root of all that is: Why is there something, not nothing? Why-and how- can the new actually come into being in the course of time? Nor does the "big bang" throw any light on these questions; it only succeeds in raising them over again in an extremely acute form.6 Thinking in terms of the ultimacy of the mystery of life and the world in this way is in keeping, I think, with the concern of the tradition of nega- tive theology that we not reify God in any way, that we not think that we really know what or who God is (e.g., an anthropomorphic agent who makes covenants with us, takes care of us in special ways, etc.). God is, in the last analysis, utterly unknowable. As German hymn writer Gerhard Tersteegen (d. 1769) put it, "A God comprehended [that is, successfully 6 I shall not be discussing the "big bang" in this essay. But it is worth noting that it does not answer the question of why there is something, not nothing. We have no way of thinking of a purely spon- taneous event because in all our experience events occur in a context in which they are preceded, surrounded, and followed by other events, so the very concept of "event" precludes the idea of any sort of absolute beginning. Augustine long ago was aware of these problems. Modern cosmolo- gists are also aware of them and are attempting to think of ways of contextualizing the "big bang." For interesting discussion of these issues, see Martin Rees's Before the Beginning: Our Universe and Others.</page><page sequence="6">414 Journal of the American Academy of Religion captured in, and thus mastered by, our human concepts and images] is no God."' Pseudo-Dionysius, Maimonides, Thomas Aquinas, Eckhart, Luther, and others all understood this, though unfortunately they often compromised this insight by claims about special "experiences" of God or "revelations" from God (which, of course, gave humans a sense of profound knowledge, comfort, and certainty). In the view I am present- ing here, these compromises are no longer made: God is utter mystery, the mystery of creativity; speaking of God as creativity in no way dimin- ishes the ultimacy of the mystery with which life confronts us.8 The metaphor of creativity, as I have been suggesting, is appropriate for naming God because (1) it preserves and indeed emphasizes the ulti- macy of the mystery that God is, even while (2) it connects God directly with the coming into being-in time-of the new and the novel.9 I high- light the significance of this second point by calling attention to the "ser- endipitous" aspect of creativity, a matter of special import when we at- tempt to think of God in this way. We humans, of course, are (so far as we know) the only beings that can or do take note of the creative pro- cesses and events in the world and who are aware that apart from these processes we-and all else that makes up the world-would not exist at all. Only humans, therefore, are in a position to value the creativity in the world and particularly to value its serendipitous character. If we value our own existence, we can hardly fail to regard the continuous coming into being of the new that has led to the emergence of humankind as "seren- dipitous," as a highly beneficial (for us) though a quite surprising and chancy sequence of events. We would not exist had there not been this quite particular succession of happenings, summarized by Martin Rees as follows: For life like us to evolve, there must be time for early generations of stars to have evolved and died, to produce the chemical elements, and then 7 Quoted by R. Otto in The Idea of the Holy (25). 8 This sort of move-enhancing the mystery dimension of our God-talk by focusing on the metaphor of creativity, thus ceasing to reify person-agent metaphors-has the further advantage of facilitating conversation between Christian theologians and adherents to certain of the reflec- tive dimensions of East Asian cultures. The Buddhist metaphor of funyata (emptiness, nothing- ness), for example, seems to carry some motifs similar to the idea of creativity. Confucian thinking about "Heaven" and Taoist ideas of chaos seem to be similarly related. Replacing the reifying no- tion of God as Creator with creativity, in our theological reflection, may help prepare for more fruit- ful conversations with, and even collaborative thinking with, representatives of these East Asian traditions. 9 This linkage between "God" and the "coming into being of the new in time" was long ago made by Isaiah, who portrays Yahweh as saying, "I am about to do a new thing: now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? ... From this time forward I make you hear new things, hidden things that you have not known. They are created now, not long ago; before today you have never heard of them, so that you could not say, 'I already knew them"' (43:6, 48:6f.).</page><page sequence="7">Kaufman: On Thinking of God as Serendipitous Creativity 415 time for the Sun to form and for evolution to take place on a planet around it. This takes several billion years. .... The size of our universe shouldn't surprise us: its extravagant scale is necessary to allow enough time for life to evolve on even one planet around one star in one galaxy. This is an example of an "anthropic" argument, which entails realizing that the Copernican principle of cosmic modesty should not be taken too far. We are reluctant to assign ourselves a central position, but it may be equally unrealistic to deny that our situation in space and time is privileged in any sense. We are clearly not at a typical place in the universe: we are on a planet with special properties, orbiting around a stable star. Somewhat less trivially, we are observing the universe not at a random time, but at a time when the requirements for complex evolution can be met. (229- 230) 10 It is thus quite appropriate to remind ourselves regularly of the seren- dipitously creative character of the specific trajectory (as I like to call it [see Kaufman 1993: ch. 20]) of the cosmic evolutionary process that pro- duced us humans. Characterizing this trajectory in this way and thinking of God in terms of the metaphor of serendipitous creativity are further examples of what (as Rees suggests) has come to be called "anthropic" thinking. That is, they call our attention to a feature of the universe that is of special importance to us humans, and they name this feature in a way that points out its sig- nificance not only for us humans but for our understanding of the uni- verse as a whole. These ideas are not merely of subjective human interest and importance: they tell us something that is also objectively true of the cosmos within which we live. The symbol "God" has always functioned in this way to call attention to that reality believed to be of greatest im- portance for ongoing human life, and in this respect it is an anthropic idea. The concept of serendipitous creativity can perform a similar anthropic function in relation to our modern/postmodern cosmological thinking; and for this reason I regard it as providing a useful way to bring the sym- bol "God" into significant connection with that thinking." 10 For a summary of the details of the very close margins that have made these developments in cosmic evolution possible, see Rees: ch. 14. See also William J. Broad's "Maybe We Are Alone in the Universe, After All." If one takes claims such as these "with all seriousness" (as Polkinghorne puts it [see note 1]), how is it possible to continue to think of God as a human-like person/agent existing before and independent of any such complex developments? 11 It is important to recognize that the notion of serendipitous creativity accomplishes this ob- jective without leading into or providing grounds for a teleological argument for the existence of (an agential) God. This is, thus, a modest or "weak" anthropism. (See Rees: ch. 15 for a thoughtful brief discussion of various sorts of anthropic thinking. For an early full discussion of "the anthropic principle," see John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler's The Anthropic Cosmological Principle.)</page><page sequence="8">416 Journal of the American Academy of Religion II In our use of the word God (as I suggest in my Essay on Theological Method [1995]) we humans are attempting to direct attention to what can be called the "ultimate point of reference" of all action, consciousness, and reflection: "No regressive reflection seeking to push back to an ultimate starting-point, no creative action moving toward an unstructured future, no appreciative feeling of worship or devotion expressing the orientation of the whole life of the self can intend some reality 'beyond' God" (Kauf- man 1995: 14). But the idea of an ultimate point of reference is itself much more abstract than the concept of God. What more, then, should be said? In In Face of Mystery (and in this essay and other writings over the past fif- teen years) I have taken the position, following suggestions of H. N. Wieman, that God should be thought of as creativity; creativity is the only proper object of worship, devotion, and faith today, the only proper ultimate point of reference for our valuing. Everything other than the ultimate mystery of creativity is a finite created reality that may indeed be valued and appreci- ated (within certain limits) but is itself always subject to distortion, corrup- tion, and disintegration and thus must be relativized by the creativity mani- fest in the coming into being (and the ultimate dissolution) of all finite realities-that alone may be characterized as "ultimate." There is a problem here, however, the seriousness of which I have not clearly acknowledged in my writing heretofore. Creativity understood as the coming into being of the new whenever and wherever this occurs- regardless of whether what is created "appear[s] (from human and hu- mane perspectives) to be horrifying evils ... [or] great goods" (Kaufman 1993: 278)-raises some difficult questions. (On this issue I depart sig- nificantly from Wieman, for whom the "creative event" is always "the source of human good.") The biblical God, of course, was thought of as sometimes bringing into being what from our human perspective appear to be great evils as well as goods: "Does evil befall a city, unless the Lord has done it?" asks the prophet Amos (3:6); "I make weal and create woe," says Yahweh through the mouth of Isaiah (45:7; cf. Job, Jeremiah, and many other texts). In the New Testament for the most part, God's fearful judgment and destructiveness remain despite the theme that "God is love" (as 1 John 4:8 and 16 put it). God is a frightening judge and destroyer as well as a forgiving father and redeemer; in this both Old Testament and New were consistently monotheistic. And so also have I been, in my think- ing of God as serendipitous creativity-ultimately, as we have just been noting, a mystery beyond our comprehension. If one takes this sort of position, how can serendipitous creativity be regarded as manifesting what is ultimately valuable and normative for</page><page sequence="9">Kaufman: On Thinking of God as Serendipitous Creativity 417 humans in all situations? Are we humans to emulate God's destructivity, God's bringing of evils (as they seem to us) into being, as well as goods? This may raise serious questions for many Christians (as well as others), although those who have regarded the warrior metaphor as an apt one for God (and also for Christ) have in the past been willing to draw this conclusion. For those (like myself) who take a radically christomorphic faith stance,12 the creation of horrific evils can hardly be regarded as appropri- ate human activity. This concern has become particularly important today, when the human project can no longer tolerate the destructiveness of unrestricted warfare, for we now have the power to bring all human life (as well as much other life on planet Earth) to a halt. Clearly creativity without qualification-creation of historical trajectories going in almost any direction-cannot be regarded as a norm appropriate or helpful for the guidance of human life and activity: our human creativity must be directed toward bringing goods into the world not evils, toward healing, toward resolving disputes through compromise and mediation, and to- ward overcoming the destructive momentums we have already brought into the ecological order on planet Earth and into the historical order of human affairs; the human creation of trajectories of massive destructive- ness must be put out of bounds. How can qualifications of this sort be reconciled with the claim that cosmic serendipitous creativity should be regarded as the ultimate point of reference in terms of which human exis- tence is to be oriented, ordered, and normed? This is not an insoluble issue. Problems arise here only if we think of serendipitous creativity in the abstract, as that creativity manifesting it- self throughout the cosmos in trajectories of many different sorts, some of them in sharp tension with others. However, when we consider that humans are neither responsible for nor can do much about most of what goes on in the universe, we can see that the examples of creativity that are to be regarded as normative for us must be restricted to the produc- tive creativity manifest on planet Earth and its immediate environment. Earth and its environment alone is really the only region of the cosmos that can be affected by our actions and projects (at least for the foresee- able future), and it is within this context that we must, therefore, seek 12 I characterize a faith stance as "radically christomorphic" if it takes such New Testament em- phases as (a) Jesus' radical teaching to "love your enemies" (Mt. 5:43-48), (b) the nonresistant posture of Jesus himself in facing his own enemies and acceding to his crucifixion, and (c) the Pauline characterization of Jesus as one who having "emptied himself, taking the form of a slave,... humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death-even death on a cross" (Phil. 2:7-8) to be paradigmatic for understanding what it means to regard God as "love" (1 John 4) and for defining the radical stance that is (should be) normative for Christian life and action. For elaboration, see Kaufman 1993: chs. 25-26.</page><page sequence="10">418 Journal of the American Academy of Religion to understand both our place in the created order and the activities ap- propriate for us to engage in; productive creativity alone, for clearly there is no reason to suppose that we humans-a very tiny part of the ecologi- cal web that has grown up on planet Earth-have been in some way "au- thorized" (by the ultimate cosmic creativity) to engage in extensive de- struction of the orders of life and their ongoing momentums (emerging over thousands of millennia). Such a claim would manifest monstrous hubris and arrogance. We must be quite constrictive in our thinking about our projects and our creativity: it is on a particular biological-historical trajectory that we humans have come into being,13 and it is this trajectory that serves as the niche in Earth's ecological web where we must live and act. Doubtless this trajectory will end at some future time, but there is no basis for arguing that it is our proper human business to bring that about: our creativity, rather, should be exercised in searching out ways to live within our eco- logical niche on this planet, with a minimum of destructiveness of the other lines of life that also have their homes here. This is the moral impli- cation of our growing ecological sensitivity and consciousness in recent decades: we no longer can live basically concerned with only the human project; our knowledges and sensitivities today enable us to understand that our projects need to fit in much better with the broader ecology of planet Earth than they often have heretofore; and it is our task today, there- fore, to make whatever creative moves we can that will facilitate this. This does not mean that all destructive activity must be ruled out for humans; indeed, we need to destroy many of our own present patterns of action, ways of thinking, institutions, and so on if we are to succeed in creating ecologically appropriate forms of human life on Earth. But destructive- ness of this sort will be in the service of the further creative movement of the biohistorical trajectory that has brought us into being and continues to sustain us. Thus our creativity will be serving-rather than blocking or otherwise countering-the forward movement into the open future (on planet Earth) of the cosmic serendipitous creativity to which we seek to be ultimately responsible. In this way, the seeming paradox involved in regarding cosmic serendipitous creativity as the ultimate point of ref- erence for our human devotion, thinking, and action dissolves away. At- tempts to employ this ultimate mystery abstractly-that is, without the qualifications just mentioned-as a norm for making judgments about particular concrete cases here on Earth will always be obscure and dubi- 13 For fuller discussion of our human "biohistorical" reality and the biohistorical trajectory that has brought us into being, see Kaufman 1993: pts. 2-3.</page><page sequence="11">Kaufman: On Thinking of God as Serendipitous Creativity 419 ous, as were attempts in the past to invoke "God's will" directly as justifi- cation for particular human decisions and actions. These considerations bring us into a position from which we can take up briefly some further concerns that Christians might have respecting the proposal that we think of God as serendipitous creativity. Consider, for example, the Christian affirmation that "God is love" (1 John 4). In many respects this notion represents the epitome of Christian anthropo- morphism/anthropocentrism. Do the theological moves I am advocating rule out or make unintelligible this central Christian claim? The funda- mental anthropomorphism of Israel's God-talk (as displayed in the Old Testament) helped prepare the way for using the metaphor "love" as a (perhaps the) defining characterization of God in Christian thinking and practice. Because loving, caring attitudes and behaviors are of such im- portance in human life, thinking of God in terms of this metaphor had great rhetorical power: God, the very creator of the universe, was now seen as standing in an intimate loving relationship with every person, God was "our father in heaven" who would meet every human need. "Even the hairs of your head are all numbered," as the words of Jesus put it (Mt. 10:30). Thus, both the deep human longing for unlimited agape-love and an ex- ceedingly powerful way of addressing that longing found significant real- ization in the conception of God, the ultimate power and resource in all the universe, as loving. The basic anthropomorphism of the early Chris- tian conception of God made this thought seem both plausible and salvific. Does the move to a deanthropomorphized God (as I am proposing) require us to jettison this whole way of thinking? No, it does not. What it does require is that we think through carefully the way this human need for love is to be understood in relation to serendipitous creativity. As I have been noting, it would certainly be a mistake to argue that all cosmic creativity manifests love for all the creatures involved: that would be un- intelligible, indeed absurd, in face of all we know about nature red in tooth and claw, to say nothing of the apparent origins of the universe in a "big bang" conceived in fundamentally physicalist terms. But there is every reason to maintain-in the theological position I am sketching-that the emergence of the love that has become of such central importance to human being and well-being must itself be seen as in significant connec- tion with the creativity apparent in the coming into being of our human- ity. In the processes through which our humanness was created, activity, attitudes, and behaviors of the sort we call loving emerged and came into focus. In our corner of the universe-that is, on the trajectory that has brought us humans into being-capacities and needs for agape-love gradually became important and prized (at least in some quarters). So in and through our specifically human relation to God (as Christians have</page><page sequence="12">420 Journal of the American Academy of Religion claimed), loving, caring attitudes and activities have become a significant feature, and love is both given and received-unlike the relations of cre- ativity to many other spheres of the cosmic order, each of which has its own distinctive character. It would, of course, be improper to say simplistically and without qualification that "God is love," as Christians have sometimes done in the past; that would be to project on every feature and dimension of the uni- verse what we find to be true and highly significant (only?) in our distinc- tively human sphere. But it is far from improper to say that not only in our relations with other humans but also in our human relation to God (creativity) and in God's relation to us, agape-love has become an impor- tant feature. In that sense, we can still say, "God is love," although this is not the only way in which God should be characterized, nor is it the most fundamental or defining metaphor to use in thinking of God. That place must be reserved for the serendipitous creativity universally manifest. Of course, Christians have always understood that a whole configuration of terms must be used in characterizing God (power, omnipresence, eternity, creativity, etc.) not love alone; indeed, to try to conceive God simply and completely in terms of the metaphor "love" would make both God and that metaphor unintelligible. A brief word should, perhaps, be added here about the implications of all this for the concept of evil, a notion central in western (as well as many other) religious traditions. I have argued elsewhere that this con- cept and the correlative concept of salvation from evil are generated largely by concerns about our own human well-being and fulfillment, on the one hand, and about human disaster or failure, on the other: The framework of valuation here is [as Spinoza argued] anthropocentric- at least initially.. . . The acts of generalization that occur as these complexes of terms are developed [in monotheisms], however, move toward transcen- dence of their anthropocentric origins. .... And with the conception of God-though the name "God" initially designated, perhaps, that reality believed to be ultimately salvific of the human-there is clearly an attempt to indicate a point of reference in terms of which all else (including, of course, the human itself) can be assessed and judged. ...

Our human-centered judgments about right and wrong, good or bad, were overruled with the emergence of theocentric faith: what God is doing and what God wills for humanity became the ultimate criteria in terms of which all judgments of value and goodness, truth and meaning, were to be made. Obviously, these ideas can be connected directly with the theological position sketched in this essay. Indeed, conceiving God as serendipitous creativity-thus moving away from the anthropomorphic/anthropocen- tric tendencies in much traditional thinking-makes this theocentric fea- ture of our God-talk more emphatic and austere than in most traditional views; and this is accomplished here (as I have just noted) without losing sight of God's loving relationship with humankind. The cosmic serendipi- tous creativity manifest throughout the universe is taken to be the ulti- mate criterion of all value and meaning, but the application of that crite- rion to our actual human living and dying is made not in these abstract terms but, rather, in terms of the facticities of our human situatedness in the evolutionary/historical trajectory that has brought about and contin- ues to sustain our human existence on Earth. Any human acts or prac- tices, customs, or institutions that violate or are otherwise destructive of the biohistorical constraints within which humankind must live and work are to be characterized as "evil"; in contrast, whatever creatively facilitates the forward movement of the evolutionary/historical trajectory of which we are part-and is in relative harmony with the wider ecological order on Earth-is to be considered good, right, fitting. Judgments made about values and meanings, about good and evil, continue here to have a direct bearing on and pertinence for human being and well-being, but they are no longer governed by essentially anthropocentric criteria. Because they are basically concerned with the ongoing sustainability of human exis- tence within the web of life on planet Earth, they have a certain ecological objectivity-however difficult it may be, in specific cases, to ascertain in scientifically measurable terms just how this is to be understood. They cannot, therefore, be considered merely a function of human desires and wishes.</page><page sequence="14">422 Journal of the American Academy of Religion III Let us step back now and take note again of the enormous difference in scale of today's vast universe as compared with the biblical one in which human God-talk began. The universe that we must take into account today-as we attempt to think about God and our obligations in the world-did not come into being just a short time before humanity was created. Nor does it consist largely in what is visible to the naked human eye; most of it appears to lie beyond the reach of even our most powerful telescopes and other instruments. Both temporally and spatially, then, this universe is of an entirely different order than anything imaginable by humans through most of history. Women and men have existed in this universe for only a minuscule fraction of its temporal development, and human activities and actions can have effects only quite locally on planet Earth and its immediate environment. Our place in God's universe and our responsibilities in God's world must thus be understood as much di- minished from what our traditional stories and images have suggested. God also (and God's "eternity")-if God is to be thought of as the cre- ativity manifest in the ongoing evolution and development of this entire vast cosmos (thus continuing a central theme of the monotheistic religious traditions)-will have to be conceived as much greater in scale and in mys- tery than anything suggested by the stories and images that informed and constituted most of our traditional thinking. The kind of personal intimacy with God fostered by many of these images-especially such anthropomor- phic ones as "father," "lord," and "king"-no longer seems appropriate or even imaginable or intelligible. So our human relationships with God will have to be conceived in much vaguer and less vivid terms than in the piety of the past-the characterization of God as serendipitous creativity straight- forwardly suggests this-and our understanding of human existence as "under God" will be experienced as much more open, much looser, much less determinate and specific. Life no longer will be thought of or experi- enced as dependent on our unmediated direct relation to a divine being whose character and will, and whose requirements of the human, are fairly clear and distinct. Rather, we must come to understand that how we live out our lives and take responsibility for ourselves and our activities here on planet Earth are matters that we humans ourselves must work out as care- fully and responsibly as we canl5-normed of course (as we have noted) by the directions in which creativity appears to be moving in our part of the 15 This was also a note in traditional Christian thinking: "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God [i.e., creativity] who is at work in you, enabling you both to will and to work" (Phil. 2:12f.).</page><page sequence="15">Kaufman: On Thinking of God as Serendipitous Creativity 423 cosmos. Thus, our lives and our ethics-all of the matters bearing on how we live, think, and act-will have to be oriented much more in terms of the overall context of human life here on Earth than traditional ways of think- ing about God and our relation to God have suggested. Earth is our home, and it should no longer be said or thought that we are "strangers and for- eigners on the earth... [who] are seeking a homeland ... a better country, that is, a heavenly one" (Hebr. 11:13-14, 16). Our modern/postmodern world picture, taken together with the con- ception of God as serendipitous creativity, evokes a significantly differ- ent sort of faith, hope, and piety than that associated with the Christian symbol system as traditionally interpreted. The childlike trust, assurance, and consolation characteristic of the conviction that throughout our lives we are cared for lovingly by a heavenly father are no longer available. In exchange, we humans become aware of ourselves as a unique species deeply embedded in the magnificent intricate web of life on planet Earth, with distinctive obligations and responsibilities to that web and the cre- ativity (the coming into being of the new and the novel) manifest in it- a creativity present and active throughout the cosmos and in all human cultural and religious traditions and activities. Thinking of God as creativity undercuts the arrogant stance of much traditional Christianity vis-a-vis the natural order as a whole, as well as with respect to other religious and secular traditions. Christians may no longer consider themselves to be authorized by God's special revelation in what they say and do. Nevertheless, important continuities with tradi- tional Christian understandings remain, continuities significant enough to warrant considering this picture of God, the world, and the human as appropriate for Christian faith today. First and most important, understanding the ultimate mystery of things, God, in terms of the metaphor of serendipitous creativity manifesting itself in a variety of evolutionary and historical trajectories-instead of in terms of the anthropomorphic creator/lord/father metaphors that constituted the traditional picture of a God with largely anthropocentric purposes-facili- tates (more effectively than did the traditional imagery) maintaining a deci- sive qualitative distinction (though not an ontological separation) between God and the created order. Such a distinction, perhaps the most important contribution of the monotheistic religions to human self-understanding, provides (as I have noted) the basis for regarding God (serendipitous cre- ativity) as the sole appropriate focus for human devotion and worship, as that alone that can properly orient us in the world. All other realities, being finite, transitory, and corruptible-created goods that come into being and pass away-become dangerous idols that, when worshiped and made the central focus of human orientation, bring disaster into human affairs. This</page><page sequence="16">424 Journal of the American Academy of Religion important distinction between God (the ultimate mystery of things) and the idols is strongly emphasized in the symbolic picture being sketched here. To attempt to order one's life in terms of the mystery of creativity can only be, of course, a move of faith, of a deep trust in the mystery that has brought us into being and continues to sustain us. Second, in keeping with this first point, conceiving humans as bio- historical beings who have emerged on one of the countless creative tra- jectories moving through the cosmos-instead of as the climax of all cre- ation, distinguished from all other creatures as the very "image of God" (Gen. 1:26-28)-makes it clear that we humans are indissolubly part of the created order and not in any way to be confused with the creativity manifest throughout the cosmos, in all its complexity, order, and beauty. In this picture the too-easy anthropocentrism of traditional Christian thinking is thoroughly undercut. We humans can exist only (as far as we are aware) within the boundaries and conditions of life found on the par- ticular trajectory within the created order in which we have appeared. Though strikingly different in important respects from some tradi- tional Christian emphases, this understanding of God and of the human is clearly a form of radical monotheism (to use H. R. Niebuhr's term). Moreover, it is a conception that can be developed into a full-orbed Chris- tian interpretation of human faith and life, if the creativity that is God is brought into significant connection with the poignancy and power of the story and character of Jesus-regarded (by Christians) as the "image of the invisible God" (Col. 1:15) that is paradigmatic for the human sphere of life.16 The reconstructions of the conceptions of God and humanity discussed here thus provide a way for Christian faith-and perhaps some other faiths as well-to reconstitute themselves in respects appropriate to our contemporary evolutionary/ecological sensibilities and knowledges. We humans did not bring the world into being, and it is not we who sustain it. We did not create the evolutionary process, forever bringing into being new, unforeseeable forms of life. There is a powerful, awe-inspiring creativity manifest in our world-and indeed, in ourselves: the new, the novel, the unforeseeable, the previously unheard of, break forth roundabout us and in our midst; and human life continues to be sustained from beyond itself. This serendipitous creativity provides grounds for our hope for the future. Human life can go on and, we dare to hope, will go on. And we are called on to participate ever more fully and effectively in the creative trans- formation of our existence that will enable this to happen. 16 In In Face of Mystery I have attempted to present such a Christian world picture (though I develop this world picture in terms of a "wider christology" than is mentioned here); for a briefer version of this Christian world picture, see Kaufman 1996: especially pt. 2.</page><page sequence="17">Kaufman: On Thinking of God as Serendipitous Creativity 425 REFERENCES Barrow, John D., and The Anthropic Cosmological Principle.
