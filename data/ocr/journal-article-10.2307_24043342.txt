<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wild in the City: Past, Present, and Future Aleksandra Ilicheva California State University, Northridge ARSTRACT This paper analyzes human-animal landscapes within an urban setting. I use a historical ecology approach to discuss the formation of (post)modern landscapes in the twenty-first century Los Angeles. The historical approach is necessary to make informed decisions for habitat restoration, and to map out human influences on natural ecosystems (Egan and Howell 2001). In the process I discuss strategies for a new urban wildlife theory. Conflicts and encounters between humans and non-humans can be more intense and controversial in a city. Because cities are usually seen as human-only landscapes, urban wildlife is more marginalized there than anywhere else. This is especially relevant in Los Angeles, a prime example of unchecked growth that brings more urbanités to the periphery and into contact with wild animals. For that reason I maintain that an urban setting is ideal for wildlife conservation and creating more egalitarian human-nonhuman relations and for breaching of traditional boundaries of exclusion. The definition of urban, in this paper, includes areas within city limits, as well as areas outside: suburbs or urban fringe. With growing urbanization and the spread of built-up areas all over the world, there remains no choice but to create more hospitable conditions for wildlife within the city, if we want to preserve the wellbeing of individual animals or entire species and ecosystems. I am interested in various qualities in urban landscapes that would create these conditions. Introduction Studies of animals have rarely transcended disciplinary boundaries. Most often, animals dwelled in the realm of biological science, which separates living things into kingdoms and other distinct units of classification. In ecology, animals are players in a network of biotic and abiotic factors called ecosystems, which rarely include humans. More recently, animal geography looks at human-animal relations through a more animal-centric lens (Philo and Wilbert 2000). Landscape ecology, which is more readily identified with physical geography, studies the patterns that arise as results of ecological © 2010 by the Association of Pacific Coast Geographers.

There has been criticism of the landscape approach to conservation for its rigid controls in organizing (Lulka 2004) and its "inherent conservatism" and resistance to social change (Cosgrove 1985). Many argue that landscape ecology should take into consideration cultural, social, economical, and political forces (Nassauer 1995; Turner, Wear, and Flamm 1996). Still, there have not been many studies in landscape ecology that are comprehensive and extensive in their use of such qualitative variables; more often than not they are added as an afterthought or a suggestion for further studies (see Turner et al. 1996, for example). I look at physical conditions, cultural and ethical relationships between humans and non-humans, and other complex variables where human ac tions and natural processes are an indistinguishable ecological force. One perspective is useless without the other. If we take a strictly biogeographical approach we will find it hard to reconcile human-nonhuman relations. Con servation sciences are often too preoccupied with functions and populations to address ethical issues. On the other hand, the humanist perspective does not address animals and ecosystems in other ways than secondary to human societies. Studying urban wildlife requires an understanding of complex human-nature relations, as well as a realization that animals will be animals that require certain environmental and ecological conditions to survive. We must, then, examine the historical ecology of the city to realize the extent to which human processes altered ecosystems throughout time. Al though animals live—and occasionally thrive—in cities, the stresses they face are much greater than those of their rural counterparts (Ditchkoff, Saalfeld, and Gibson 2006). As cities like Los Angeles (LA) push further and further outward, more animals are forced into its urban network, more bodies litter freeway shoulders, and more species become endangered. Such events are neither ethically nor ecologically sound; there has to be a radical change in urban planning and in viewing nonhumans that will allow them to carve their own spaces within the city in a safe and healthy environment. Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Reserve: An Example for the City? For a hopeful outlook for LA's wildlife I would like to present the Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Preserve, in the northern part of the city. It is a much less known and smaller nature area than some other landmarks in the city, such as Griffith Park or Santa Monica Mountains; however, the existence of such</page><page sequence="3">58 APCG YEARBOOK . Volume 72 • 2010 place could bring a new understanding of urban wildlife, and acceptance for urban nonhumans. The Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area. The 2,000-acre Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area is located in the San Fernando Valley (SFV), near the intersection of the Interstates 405 and 101, one of the busiest intersections in the country. The area takes its name from a dam on the Los Angeles River, which flows from west to east throughout the Valley. The multiple-use area contains two golf courses, recreational parks, two artificial lakes, bicycle trails, a Japanese Garden, soccer fields, and more. Non-recreational areas include a water treatment plant, a military base, and some agricultural fields. The eastern part of the basin, including the area right by the dam, is designated a wildlife reserve and contains trails open to public use, except for one area west of Woodley Boulevard that is designated a fly zone for model airplanes. The 225-acre reserve was created part by part in the 1970s and '80s as a "revegetation project" by the Army Corps of Engineers, but is now managed by different organizations that form the Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Areas Steering Committee (SBWASC), such as City of Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation, Los Angeles Audubon Society, The River Project, Tree People, Sierra Club SFV Chapter, and others (SepulvedaBasinWildlife.org 2009). The reserve, bisected into a The Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area.</page><page sequence="4">Ilicheva: Wild in the City: Past, Present, and Future 59 northern and a southern part by Burbank Boulevard, contains an 11-acre lake made from reclaimed water; the island in the lake, as well as the in accessible east bank, serve as breeding grounds for bird species such as cormorants, coots, and various ducks (Figure 1). Audubon, which conducts monthly bird walks in the area, counted over two hundred bird species resi dent or visiting different habitats of the reserve, including aquatic, riparian, woodland, and chaparral. Although the Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Reserve (SBWR) is called so, it is not really the type of wilderness preserve that readily comes to most peoples minds (the terms preserve and reserve are used interchangeably). It is not a remnant habitat of any sort, nor is it strictly regulated (although there are certain restrictions in place, such as on dogs, fishing, collecting insects, and so on). It is also located in the middle of an urban center of over one million people. The ecological integrity of the "preserve" can be debated. SBWASC states "even though the Wildlife Reserve has the 'look' of a natural' habitat, it would be incorrect to state that we have 'restored' the habitat" (SepulvedaBasinWildlife.org 2009). The committee does not explain in detail the definition of "natural" and "restored," but it could be assumed that they are vying for a habitat of mostly native riparian plant species. Although the habitat would see improvement through elimination of some of the invasive plant species and a greater diversity of native plants, I see the SBWR as a success already; moreover it would be unfair to declare it "unfit" wildness, or something incomplete. There is no concrete point of reference for restoration, because the original habitats were completely replaced by urbanization and agriculture, and there is no record of precisely what ecosystems were in place. The river and the hydrology of the region, too, have been completely altered by the Corps of Engineers and surrounding urbanization. Because the seasonal flow of the Los Angeles River has been engineerically equalized, the area is actually wetter than it would normally be—a condition that proliferates growth of certain invasive species, such as the castor bean, Ricinus communis. We know that the San Fernando Valley, as well as most of California's flatlands, had been a native grassland, populated by rodents, antelope, and grizzlies (Schiffman 2005). Most of the grasslands are gone from the entire state, and there is no record as to specifically what plant species were found. Therefore, complete restoration of habitat is unat tainable. Furthermore, planting grass species is insufficient to restore the habitat, without the birds, animals, and insects that live there.</page><page sequence="5">60 APCG YEARBOOK • Volume 72 • 2010 The plants and animals are coming back to the reserve, whether or not the same ones that inhabited the Valley in pre-colonial times. Many of the native plants have "volunteered," that is, they have grown without being planted since the reserve was created (SepulvedaBasinWildlife.org 2009). The animals, too, have shown up. The lake and the riparian vegetation attracts many birds, including Canada geese (Branta canadensis), and the diversity and abundance of insects increased as well, now including species such as the praying mantis (Tenodera aridifolia sinensis). Mammals are not as abundant. There is a large cottontail (Sylvilagus auduboni) population that has devoured attempts at introducing native grasses; the rabbits also graze on the soccer field after the sun goes down. There are not many predators to hunt the rabbit population: red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) are present; coyotes (Canis latrans) have been sighted as well, but are unlikely resident to the reserve. Several fish species are present in the lake and surrounding streams. It is uncertain where they came from; the Los Angeles River once supported a variety of species. There have not been thorough surveys of wildlife, besides birds. Almost none of the animals were present in the area before the reserve was established, so greater future diversity is possible. The fact that animal populations have not been actively managed in the reserve, yet had successfully established themselves, gives great hope for a new model of urban ecosystem restoration. Instead of presenting urban wildlife as rigidly defined and confined, the SBWP can serve as a model of what Whatmore and Thorne call "topologies of wildlife," or "a relational achievement spun between people and animals, plants and soils, documents and devices, in heterogeneous social networks that are performed in and through multiple places and fluid ecologies" (Whatmore and Thorne 1998, 473). This way the animals, and to an extent the plants too, are active agents in creating their environment. Animals and Landscapes Animals never figured prominently in urban planning other than in a form of pests, and animal geography has not been widely studied until recently (Wolch 2002; Philo and Wilbert 2000; Wolch, West, and Gaines 1995; Philo 1995). The reason is that urban planners and academics alike do not see cities as suitable places for wild animals. Despite the growing popularity of urban ecology and using ecological concepts to study urbanization (Fagan et al. 2001), major schools of urban thought such as the Chicago School com pletely left out plants and animals (Wolch 2002). Of course, many animals</page><page sequence="6">Ilicheva: Wild in the City: Past, Present, and Future 61 do live and even thrive within cities. The problem clearly lies not with the question of propriety of habitat, but with human values of what animals' habitats and lives should be. The two most common arguments for why cities are unsuitable for wildlife are (1) cities are "unnatural" or "degraded" and (2) wild animals present a threat/nuisance to people. Both of these arguments perpetuate the common nature/culture divide, where humans and animals are seen in opposition to one another. This view is held by scientists, social scientists, and policy makers and is reflected within the rectangular bound aries of national parks or pest extermination programs in the cities. Urban nature, or any human-modified landscape, is often seen by purists as profane, fallen, or contaminated. In reality, after millions of years, there is very little nature left that has not been affected by humans at some point (Denevan 1992; Cronon 1998). In American history, California was the "final frontier" where "rugged men" and "soiled doves" (prostitutes) flocked to find gold and fortune. This typical history discounts prior settlement and cultiva tion of land by Mexicans, Spaniards, and Native Americans. The great vistas of the Sierras whose wild beauty John Muir so admired were settled by Native Americans, who fished the streams, hunted the animals, collected plants, and burned the brush to create picturesque valleys and groves (Blackburn and Anderson 1993). It is very hard then, if not impossible, to pinpoint the end of naturalness as Native Americans and then Spaniards, Mexicans, and eventually Americans inhabited the region. Rather, it is the peoples relation ship with nature that changes as time and different regimes go. The devaluation of a landscape is a serious problem for animals, because their own lives become devalued as a result. Landscape quality, paired with ecological ideas of populations and sustainability, often informs conserva tion practices. Thorne ( 1998) writes that the conceptualization of Australian plains as "badlands" influenced the perceived abundance of kangaroos that live there and resulted in an unimpeded hunting of these animals. In Yel lowstone, buffalo that stray outside park boundaries can be removed or killed (Lulka 2004). It is believed that the animals are pressured to move when the park's population grows too big. In such a case, there is no issue with eliminating the excessive individuals. The cities, too, can be seen as barren landscapes, as far as wildlife conservationists are concerned. Species found in abundance in cities, such as rats, pigeons, sparrows, crows, raccoons, mallards, etc., are considered pests. The eradication of any of these species would not cause any widespread ethical or environmental outrage. Ironi cally, the abundance of these species is often the result of their interaction</page><page sequence="7">62 APCG YEARBOOK . Volume 72 • 2010 with the urbanized landscapes. Just like with Thome's kangaroos, a complex relationship between an individual animal and its environment is discounted in favor of a perceived notion of a landscape or population. Wolch, West, and Gaines (1995, 751) propose a "new environmental history" that views environmental disturbance as the main component of urbanization. Cities can affect climate and hydrology of landscapes. A built up area can change wind speed and direction on a regional level, and the abundance of concrete and relative lack of vegetation will affect temperature and humidity, in what is known as the urban heat island effect. Reduced percolation and increased runoff will change the hydrology of the region and pollute ocean waters. Human social and political systems will also modify landscapes, as certain species will be deemed useful and incorporated into the economic system and others will be exterminated. The new environmen tal history helps to move away from the idea that cities somehow stand apart from the natural environment, as opposed to rising from the environment. It also forces humans to accept responsibility for the damage inflicted upon the environment and wildlife. In the landscape ecology approach, we learn to see the heterogeneity in landscapes as a result of various disturbance regimes. Cities are no different from any other patch, though they may fall on the extreme end of the disturbance spectrum. Social Constructions of Animals and Landscapes— Discourses and Encounters The myths and generalizations about groups of animals can be created through folk tales, modern media, cultural values, or scientific studies. With the rise of capitalist economy, these perceptions take on a very black-and white appearance, where animals (or plants) are either commodities and resources or a threat or nuisance that should be disposed of. This regime de-emphasizes the inescapable fact that human existence depends on our environment and that trying to control every aspect of nature is simply absurd. Even National Parks' primary purpose is recreation; the managerial practices are in the interest of the public and do not always correspond with what is best ecologically. Geographic areas that serve more conservationist purposes carry names like wildlife refuge or reserve (as in case of SBWR), which imply the precariousness of existence of nonhumans in our society. As Birch (1998) writes, these designations, for all their good intentions, turn into areas of captivity rather than safety, meant to keep inhabitants in rather than keep intruders out.</page><page sequence="8">Ilicheva: Wild in the City: Past, Present, and Future 63 In urban centers, the perceptions of wildlife are even more one-dimen sional. Most of the time, cities are completely unsustainable on their own, meaning that they depend on food and water being brought from outside and on engineered solutions for water treatment, soil quality, and other sub stitutes for natural processes. Yet, for a lot of people this realization dawns only while reading apocalyptic literature, and then it safely dissipates once the book is closed. In Los Angeles the disconnect started with Anglo-American settlement (Davis 1998). The arid Mediterranean climate was unfamiliar and perceived as a barren desert. To sell valuable real estate to a large mass of people, water was brought in from as far as the Sierras, and palm trees and gardens were planted to give the city a lush, tropical appearance. Today the desert itself becomes an empty lot, as greater and greater portions of Mohave and Colorado deserts are subdivided, driven by the inexhaustible forces of expansion. Energy companies portray deserts of the Southwest as blank canvases upon which we can paint the new future of sustainable energy: enormous space for thousands of square miles of solar panels, filled with sunshine and nothing else. Los Angeles is a relatively young city, but it grew enormously fast in the past century. Older or even middle-aged lifelong residents of the San Fernando Valley can remember the time when this multicultural concrete home of over a million people, encompassing more than half the area of the City of Los Angeles, was mostly agricultural, or just "empty land." From this frenetic development that never really stopped, Los Angeles developed into an urban center of people who are from somewhere else. People like that do not have many ties to native ecosystems; most often their understanding of the native environment comes from ideas transplanted from the place they lived before (like the original Anglo settlers), or from their expectations of what LA should be. And the marketed representation of the city has always been superficial. As new subdevelopments along the periphery filled with residents, Los Angeles became the city with the most urban-wildlife edge, with virtually no agricultural buffer that characterizes other cities (Davis 1998). It is ironic that people complain about the lack of nature in Los An geles, when it actually has the most natural areas within a city (Davis 1998). For example, the Santa Monica Mountains are completely circumscribed by the city or the Pacific Ocean. In such a landscape matrix, many residents have proximity to wildlife, but not necessarily intimacy with, or a great un derstanding of, their environment. "Meaningful interaction" with animals is</page><page sequence="9">64 APCG YEARBOOK • Volume 72 . 2010 replaced by consumption of a culturally and commercially produced image, reducing animals to objects (Wolch, West, and Gaines 1995). The landscape matrix sets the stage for the formation of cultural and ethical landscapes that are more difficult to analyze. Jones talks about a "spatiality of ethics" that forms an ethical landscape (Jones 2000). Accord ing to Jones, encounters with individual animals are shaped by perceptions of entire species of population, and in turn, each encounter may serve to form a more lasting view of a larger group. The discourse about animals will shape the "sociospatial practices" toward these species or individuals, creating spaces of inclusion or exclusion (Philo 1995)—not just physical, but ethical spaces as well. Davis (1998,267) writes that our knowledge of the en vironment is "a two-dimensional cartoon based on random encounters and behavioralist [sic] clichés," such as the portrayal of "deviant" "man-eating" mountain lions that threaten hikers and suburbanites. However, opinions about groups at large can affect the treatment of individual animals. Species that are deemed abundant or out of place may fall outside ethical consid erations of animal cruelty and abuse. Jerolmack's study of peoples attitudes toward pigeons shows how the birds newfound stigma has led to abuse and even mass extermination of these longtime urban residents (Jerolmack 2008). Jerolmack pinpoints the origin of the expression "rats with wings" to a newspaper article in the 1960s, a label that justified all past and future exterminations of the birds by "framing" the pigeon within the cultural discourse. Moreover, Jerolmack (1998,86) writes that "the frame serves as a distancing mechanism, so that one who encounters a representative member of a species so labeled will be more inclined to dismiss, abhor, or even kill in accordance with the proffered interpretation." While Jerolmack discusses metaphor and symbolism applied to a species, it is important to mention the aspect of anthropomorphism used to further stigmatize animal popula tions. Anthropomorphism of animals is inevitable, and can be beneficial in helping people connect and relate to the rest of the natural world, but it can also lead to harmful and ridiculous generalizations of animals. Jerolmack's pigeons were compared to bums and squatters in New York Times articles. Mountain lions of southern California have been called "deviant" and a threat to the safety of affluent White communities. Thus people further marginalize "problem" animals by attributing them with problematic human social characteristics. Unlike other generalizations about populations, these anthropomorphisms are not grounded in any sort of reality or scientific</page><page sequence="10">Ilicheva: Wild in the City: Past, Present, and Future 65 fact. Still, no matter how far they escape from logic, these beliefs are highly prevalent in the formation of ethical landscapes. The lack of intimate knowledge of the animals, coupled with perpetuat ing stereotypes about groups, leads to fear. The card of security trumps all other considerations: a mountain lion attack on a human raises an army of vigilantes and government officials who will hunt down the lone, weak animal; a belief that some animals may carry a dangerous disease will lead to the slaughter of millions. Populations of animals pay the price for human fear with confinement to their appropriate area, and individuals pay the price with their lives. Davis writes that dominant groups disseminate myths that create landscapes of fear, whether of poor people, minorities, or mountain lions, where these groups of Others become marginalized. Birch also makes the connection between wildlife and marginal humans, both seen as "oth ers" and a threat to the established order. The order, which Birch (1998) calls imperial power, is in reality a large set of complex cultural, economic, scientific, and other factors that has changed and evolved through time. The result is that nature is denied "self-determination" and is subsequently "incarcerated" into designated areas. The Los Angeles River is a perfect example of a natural feature that has been misunderstood, reinterpreted in a negative way, declared a wasteland, ardently controlled, incarcerated within a channel of concrete, and built up as a landscape of fear. As a seasonal dry-climate river, flooding and chang ing its course erratically (Davis 1998; Gumprecht 2005), the Los Angeles River did not act in a way expected by Anglo settlers, The river had a very wide floodplain and was not confined to a very specific track. Therefore, without its current concrete container, parts of the river could have been in a different location today, a location that could change after each major flood. It is only the best-engineered interpretation of the real Los Angeles River. Though it was used as the water source for the young city, after the completion of the aqueduct, the channel that was often dry in the summer was used as a gravel pit or a trash dump (Gumprecht 2005). The value of the rivers landscape only went down after the concrete channel was constructed. Los Angeles residents seem to forget that once it was home to many different species; today birds still flock to restored and vegetated parts of the river. It was the fear and lack of understanding of natural environment that killed the Los Angeles River. Today the river still remains a fearscape, a blighted underbelly of the city. A recent Los Angeles Times article, "Life, death, and fear on the L.A. River," describes the dangerous and paranoid existence of</page><page sequence="11">66 APCG YEARBOOK . Volume 72 . 2010 a group of homeless people living under the bridge on the river s banks in Long Beach (Goffard 2009). A murder recently occurred nearby that has the residents living in fear, and very few of the numerous crimes that occur there get reported or investigated by the police. Although many ended up under the bridge due to drug addiction and life's misfortunes, one resident expressed his desire to live freely on a river. More often than not, the homeless are driven out of their makeshift residences on the river or under freeway overpasses and confined to designated areas such as skid row. Both human and nonhuman occupants of the river can be feared and despised by the general population. Human attitudes toward animals can be very complex and nonlinear. Kellerts study of Americans' attitudes toward nature showed that while urban residents held less knowledge of animals than rural residents, they had more sympathetic attitudes, though limited mostly to charismatic or endangered species (Kellert 1979, 1980; Kellert and Berry 1980). Re spondents with lower levels of education tended to have more negativistic attitudes about animals. However, a study of attitudes of animal wellbeing among several thousands of Ohio residents (Kendall, Lobao, and Sharp 2006) showed greater concern expressed by less educated, low income, or minority respondents. These results suggest that those groups identify with animals as another group that has been oppressed or discriminated against. Another study done by Wolch et al. (Wolch, Brownlow, and Lassiter 2000) of a group of African-American women in Los Angeles also hints at their solidarity with wildlife. Individual background and experience also plays a big role in attitudes towards animals, underlying the importance of en counters in the formation of larger cultural animal landscapes. The Kendall et al. study showed that people who grew up in a rural setting or have more contact with an agricultural or rural environment express less concern about animal wellbeing, regardless of current residence. However, in another Los Angeles study, Latina women who came from rural backgrounds expressed humanistic attitudes toward animals, and described as "traumatic" having to witness animal slaughter and suffering during childhood (Lassiter and Wolch 2005). Lassiter and Wolch maintain that many Latino families keep farm animals as a way to reconnect with their cultural identity; however, some of the Latinas in the study group adapted new cultural practices such as keeping pets. This "post-modern malaise" of living in a transition between cultures, trying to adapt past practices for a new way of life, while very relevant for Los Angeles, has not been well studied due to the marginal</page><page sequence="12">Ilicheva: Wild in the City: Past, Present, and Future 67 or illegal status of the people. The women all expressed a strong desire to educate their children about nature and treatment of animals, contrary to popular belief that poorer, less educated people don't care about animals, or have better things to worry about. The discrepancy between the complex reality and simplistic belief about attitudes impinge negatively on the lives of people and wildlife. Institution alized practices regarding animals can affect a certain group of people; for example, based on Lassiter and Wolch study we can deduce that a recent limit on backyard chickens in Los Angeles would negatively and dispro portionately affect lives of Latinas (Lassiter and Wolch 2005). However, demographics also shape landscapes of wildlife within the city. The City of Los Angeles has had a shortage of parks from the start; Olmsted and Bar tholomew tried to mitigate this problem in their 1930 plan for the greater Los Angeles region (Hise and Deverell 2000). The plan failed to actualize, and the city remains one with the least amount of park area per resident in the country. Studies show that lower-income people and minorities have the least access to parks (Wolch, Wilson, and Fehrenbach 2005). An ongoing project by Jackiewicz and Davidson on roles of parks in recreation shows that there is a shortage of parks in the San Fernando Valley, particularly in lower-income areas (Jackiewicz and Davidson, unpublished). In fact, the most prominent method of recreation in the valley, according to the study, is going to the mall. Shopping centers make sense for the consumption driven economic point of view, but they are also places that are much more easily policed and monitored. Not surprisingly, one of the most common arguments against parks is that of safety. The valley residents in Jackiewicz s and Davidsons study did voice safety concerns, but many of them preferred parks as a method of recreation. Interestingly, from my own experience, in a city such as Beverly Hills there would be more resident opposition to parks, based on safety anxiety. Jackiewicz and Davidson (unpublished) emphasize that parks should be designed with the needs of the target population in mind; I maintain that they should also be designed with wildlife in mind. Sepulveda Basin is an example of an urban park that has mixed human recreational areas and a wildlife area, but one in which the two are not mutually exclusive.</page><page sequence="13">68 APCG YEARBOOK. Volume 72. 2010 Wilderness Versus Wildness Urban wildlife "management" comes down to a question of how to address the needs of animals without imposing physical constraints on their propa gation and movement, and without imposing cultural and social constraints on what animals, ecosystems, and nature-human relations should look like. I propose, along with others, that we must think in terms of wildness instead of—and without—wilderness. Countless unresolved debates had passed about the designation of those terms, so I would rather focus on the relational implications of wildness and wilderness, instead of trying to define either one. Wilderness implies an existence of a certain state of purity that is unlikely to be found in a city, or anywhere else. In this state, wilderness has a concrete boundary that defines the place of wildness, therefore in this popular way of thinking "wild" is simply a function of the wilderness. According to Lulka (2004, 458) this "official definition of wildness skirts around the realization that wildness is fundamentally relational, continu ally in contact with externalities, and thus, in the process of delineating the place of wildness (figured as wilderness), there is unavoidable devaluation of the expressive qualities of nonhumans and the spatial relations they entail." Cronon defines "wild" as "the autonomy and otherness of the things and creatures around us," and the use of this notion consequently will lead to greater care and responsibility for the world (Cronon 1998,495). To acknowl edge the essence of otherness is essential for allowing the self-determination of wildlife, for it means that none of the human management practices should serve to fully control nature. Where wilderness is often seen as a resource, whether of aesthetics or tangible goods, wildness is "plain disutility," which cannot be incorporated into any sort of economical or "imperial" order (Birch 1998). Wildness possesses intrinsic value and is never fully know able. Farina (2007), for instance, refers to cognitive landscapes of living things as "subjective worlds" produced by autopoietic mechanisms of each individual, as well as the surroundings. In other words, wildness signifies dissipative systems composed of all the individual physical bodies as well as the collective of all the potentials of all individuals. Wildness is essential, yet it is never fully realized because it is always in the process of remaking itself. Lulka (2004,459) refers to this concept, or specifically to populations of animals, in Deleuzian terms as a Body without Organs. Therefore, wildness is spaceless, "because it is constantly in the process of making space."</page><page sequence="14">Ilicheva: Wild in the City: Past, Present, and Future 69 Conclusion In this paper I touched upon the complex relations that create animal spaces within the city of Los Angeles. Animals have not enjoyed a great importance in urban planning, and their agency in creating their own habitats has been underrated at best. Assessing the environmental history of the region shows how human forces acted as disturbance upon natural ecosystems to create the current land-use matrix. Encounters and perceptions shape each other and form discourses about animals within the scientific community and the general public, which in turn shape animal landscapes. Looking at the social construction of nonhuman populations is useful in analyzing the co constructed landscapes of the city. However to move beyond description and into the realm of praxis, it is necessary to see animals as flesh-and-blood, breathing individuals that are active agents in the creation of livelihoods and landscapes (Philo and Wilbert 2000; Wolch 2002). To move away from the concept of designated wilderness and into the idea of inherent wildness would help create city planning initiatives that would focus on the wellbeing of nonhumans across the entire spectrum of urban landscape. The study of urban wildlife is and will be ridden with problems and controversies. It is also a great opportunity to create new theories and un derstandings of human-nonhuman relations. Much research still needs to be done on the best methods for restorative ecology in cities, and better policies that reflect the needs of animals. There is also a need for some reconcilia tion between out treatment of different groups of nonhumans, specifically an approach that is both ecologically and ethically sound. I use the Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Reserve as an example of historical ecology applied to the city, and as a hopeful sign for wildlife in Los Angeles. The involvement of the city and many other organizations and communities in the restoration is a stark contrast to the single-minded forces of develop ment that shaped the suburban form of the San Fernando Valley. Restoration of the Los Angeles River offers a promise of connectivity of habitats within the city, as well as the public s greater support and involvement in greening the city. As Philo and Wilbert (2000) suggest, we should allow animals more space within the city to be animals; the reserve could serve as a platform for nonhumans to (re)create their livelihoods within the city.
