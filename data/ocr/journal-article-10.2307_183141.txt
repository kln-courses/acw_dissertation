While over the past decade some historians have attempted to take the question of gender seriously, 'women's studies' or 'women's history' has not come to con- stitute a significant or recognizably separate field of scholarship in South Africa, they maintain.2 It seems that this situation is changing. The recent publication of a collection of essays on Women and Gender in Southern Africa to I9453 and the growing number of articles on the history of South African women appearing in journals, as well as the establishment of women's studies programs in some of the universities, suggest the consolidation and legitimation of a South African feminist scholarship that for too long has remained extremely marginalized. The institutionalization of gender studies as a separate field is, however, a double-edged prospect. On the one hand, such a development will inevitably stimulate the vibrant, if comparatively small, area of historical research. And there is no question that the accumulation of studies of women's and gender history over recent years has registered some effect on radical South African historiography. In textual terms this is manifest in the requisite 'women's chapter' in historical collections and the compulsory citing of gender in the third or fourth place in the invariable litany of significant social factors that must be considered in historical explanation. In terms of historical content, women, black and white, have been revealed as historical actors, their organized and public political struggles now well recognized; the work that women do - in agriculture, in the informal sector, in others' homes and even, to some extent, in their own homes - has shifted into historical purview even while its significance remains undertheorized; and there is, more and more, an acknowledgment that those historical processes previously represented as gender-neutral ones - migrant labour, proletarianization, urbanization, labour force organization, etc. - are in fact structured by gender relations and differentially experienced by men and women. But on the other hand, as feminist historians have found out elsewhere, 1 This paper was originally presented to the 33rd Annual Meeting of the African Studies Association, Baltimore, Maryland, 1-4 November I990, in a panel on 'Gender and the reconceptualization of African History' organized by Iris Berger.

The nascent field of gender studies in South Africa is overwhelmingly inhabited by women scholars who study women. Historians doing 'general' or 'universal' history continue to ignore gender. With some women seen to be doing the work of gender history within a designated sub-field, other (particularly) male historians can rationalize an exemption from the struggle to integrate a gender perspective into their work - a challenge that grows ever more sophisticated and consequential as feminist theory advances and one that potentially can undermine their mastery of the subject. It is also the case, with few exceptions, that South African feminist historians are white and middle class, reflecting the patterns of racial exclusion and hierarchy that structure South African academic institutions. The social profile of historians who address gender in South African studies - the predominance of white women, the inordinate lack of representation of black women, of black men, of white men - is an important and consequential political issue to be addressed.4 But social identity cannot abstractly constitute a claim to the validity of one's historical analysis, or indeed a justification for failing to analyse the gender or racial dimensions of social organization. The analysis of gender is, I hold, the task of all historians - as is the analysis of race, ethnicity, age, language and other significant dimensions of social differentiation and hierarchy. And, like Walker, I would argue that the visible identification of the historian with, and her subjective experience of, the issues at hand do not necessarily ensure a more astute, comprehensive or progressive analysis, even while cultural and social proximity clearly in- fluence perceptions and understandings.5 Nor would an alteration in the race and gender profile of South African historians looking at 'women' secure an immunity from ethnocentrism or phallocentrism. For the more radical thrust of the feminist and anti-racist critique of historiography has been showing precisely the extent to which the invisibility or ' otherness' of women and non-whites is embedded in the very epistemological assumptions and analytic strategies the historian uses.6 The ghettoization and marginalization of feminist and gender-sensitive history relate then not just to its historians but also to mode and objective of gendered historical research and analysis. As Joan Scott writes: New facts might document the existence of women in the past, but they did not necessarily change the importance (or lack of it) attributed to women's activities. 4 Participants at a conference on Women and Gender in Southern Africa at the University of Natal in January I99I raised, as a political problem, the preponderance of white women amongst South African feminist academics (author's observation). 5 Cherryl Walker, 'Women and gender in Southern Africa to I945: an overview', in Walker (ed.), Women and Gender in Southern Africa, 5-7. 6 See Chandra Mohanty, 'Under western eyes: feminist scholarship and colonial discourses', Feminist Review, xxx (I988), 6i-88, for a critique of ethnocentric meth- odology; and Joan Scott, Part I and Part III of Gender and the Politics of History (New York, I 988), Linda Nicholson, Gender and History: The Limits of Social Theory in the Age of the Family (New York, I986), and Denise Riley, 'Am I That Name?' Feminism and the Category of 'Women' in History (Hampshire, I988), as examples of some of the radical rethinking of historiography that centers gender analytically.</page><page sequence="3">STATE AND GENDER 443 Indeed, the separate treatment of women could serve to confirm their marginal and particularized relationship to those (male) subjects already established as dominant and universal.7 The further development of women's history in South Africa cannot therefore ensure either that it will be more valorized as a field of research or that it will be taken into account within mainstream history. Nor can it be assumed that the production of a 'critical mass' of feminist and women's history will prompt a more profound, gendered re-thinking of the historical enterprise. Such an outcome is dependent both on the institutional politics around the legitimacy of gender inquiry in what is now recognized as 'history' (including all its sub-disciplines) and on the way in which gender analysis is conceived by South Africanist historians. Different conceptual- izations of gender will challenge 'South African history' in more or less profound ways and bear different epistemological implications. Some ways of treating gender can be incorporated into existing modes of analysis without too many ruffles, while others force and forge more fundamental reconceptualizations. In South African history, as elsewhere, 'gender' has tended to be conceived as synonymous or coterminous with 'women'. In some cases gender is claimed to refer to the relations between men and women, but in actual use the concept often retains 'women' as its central focus - women as oppressed by men or under patriarchy. The object of gender history has thus tended to be either women, or those areas of social life which are centrally associated with, and also defining of, female gender - areas such as family, the domestic sphere, biological reproduction, sexuality and certain areas of production culturally constructed as 'women's work'. This reduction or conflation of the meaning of gender acts to confine its analytic gaze to a limited range of social life. The consequence of this focus is that central social and political categories and historical processes have not been subjected to sufficient scrutiny from a gender perspective. The reconceptualization of South African history in terms of gender requires minimally a more determined and relentless interrogation of those topics that are not immediately identifiable as 'women' s history' or as gender-laden - questions of the state, war, colonial- ism, nationalist politics, urban class formation, mine labour, etc., which have long been represented as the domain of 'general' history. As part of that project, I focus, in this article, on the conceptualization of 'the state' in South African women's history. To what extent has feminist South African historiography contributed towards an understanding and analysis of the state in relation to women and towards a gendered reconcep- tualization of state? The state or state formation (the theoretically and historically more appropriate term) has been integral to the defining preoccupations of radical South African history - the dissolution of in- digenous African societies under the impact of colonialism and capitalism, the complex construction of the systems of migrant labour and apartheid and the forms of struggle and resistance that have shaped them. Women and gender, as I will go on to discuss, have been shown (true, in discrete and 7 Scott, Gender and the Politics of History, 3. 16 AFH 33</page><page sequence="4">444 LINZI MANICOM sometimes tangential ways) to be threaded and knotted throughout these broad historical processes. Yet conceptualizations of 'the state' as such have remained impervious to the theoretical implications of what Elizabeth Fox- Genovese has described as 'placing women's history in history'.8 Women are not present in 'the state', in more ways than one. Debate around the state in progressive South African history has been dominated by the question of whether and how race and/or class have structured the apartheid state. The quickest of glances will show that women, historically and today, have been negligible in state structures, that state policy has discriminated against women, oppressively so against black women, and that, indeed, the historical development of apartheid was predicated on state-enforced gender sub- ordination. A more penetrating look will reveal, as feminist political history is beginning to do, that the very fundamental categories of state and politics - like citizen, worker, the modern state itself - are shot through with gender; they were in fact historically constructed and reproduced as masculine categories, predicated on the subordination of women.9 Gender is clearly a relation of power, of domination and of rule. Yet gender does not feature in the race-class debate, even in its more recent incarnations, and it is certainly far from conventional to refer to the masculinist state, the patriarchal state - along with the colonial/segregationist/apartheid/capitalist/reformist state in South African history.10 Part of the reason for this lack of reconstruction of our understanding of the state comes from the fact that much of women's history is located within the social history tradition which developed in the late 'seventies in explicit opposition to the broad theoretical (some would say theoreticist) debates about the development of apartheid 'from above'. This more empirical approach focuses on local historical and social processes, paying more attention to the perspective of the historical social actors.11 The other reasons must be sought in the ways in which 'gender' and 'state' have been conceived in South African historiography. A critique of these conceptions will structure and delimit the review of 8 Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, 'Placing women's history in history', New Left Review, CXXXIII (I982), 5-29. 9 See, for example, Nancy Fraser, 'What's critical about critical theory?

The review provides neither a comprehensive survey of the literature nor an exhaustive exam- ination of the themes which are addressed. I am concerned rather to identify the main analytic paradigms that have characterized the work, focussing on the way in which the relationship between women/gender and state has been posed within these. I want to show the limitations of those conceptions and draw out the implications and insights of some of the research that has been done, particularly recently, for challenging how we understand South African state formation. Some of the problematics I identify have been thoroughly transcended; others continue to have resonance in the literature that is currently being produced. As will be seen, within the relatively small body of women's history that has been published, while there is reference to state actions or measures against women, there has been very little explicit theorizing of 'the state' or state processes. There has been even less from a self-consciously gender or feminist perspective. This means that my observations and arguments often rely on extrapolation and on drawing out the implications of the different approaches. I make no claim to elaborating full critiques of the different positions but want rather to discern the disruptions of prevailing under- standings of state formation as these are urged by the inclusion of women and gender within the frame of historical analysis. In the final section of the article, I turn to look very generally at recent approaches to the question of ' the state' in radical South African historiography, discussing the con- sequences of their failure to integrate gender. Like others, I am arguing that there are inadequacies in current theorizing of South African state formation that have to be addressed."2 Unlike such authors, I am insisting that the re-thinking has fundamentally to integrate the theoretical and epistemological implications of gender. This, I argue, is not just a matter of looking at what 'the state' does (in the form of legislation, policy, repressive practices) to ( particularly black) 'women'. It is not just a matter of adding in women as a constituency or objective of state policy, of looking at the differential impacts and implications of state practices for men and women. Posing the relationship in this externalized way exempts both categories of 'state' and 'women' from interrogation in terms of one another; it disguises their mutual constitution in the historical process. I want to show how recent South African historical studies which look at 'the state' as state formation and at 'women' as gender constructs suggest ways of moving beyond these prevailing conceptualizations. Drawing on, and drawing out, the challenges to categories of historical explanation posed and prompted by the integration of gender will contribute towards a more adequate analysis of South African state formation. 12 This point is variously argued by Greenberg, Legitimating the Illegitimate; Martin Chanock, 'Writing South African legal history: a prospectus', J. Afr. Hist., xxx (I989), 265-88; Baruch Hirson's review of Glenn Moss and Ingrid Obery (eds.), South African Contemporary Analysis, in South African Review of Books, xvi (1990), 5; and Wolpe, Race, Class and the Apartheid State. 16-2</page><page sequence="6">446 LINZI MANICOM RECUPERATIVE WOMEN S HISTORY The research into women's history that began to be carried out in the late 1970s under the general rubric of revisionist or radical South African history conformed very much with what is now regarded as 'recuperative' women's history, redressing the absence of women from the historical narrative - or part of it anyway. The popular political struggles in which (mainly black) women had been central actors were unearthed from archives and witness accounts and put on record."3 This was part of the more general recuperation of African nationalist history and culture that the South African apartheid state had quite successfully managed to suppress during the 'sixties and early 'seventies. The topics of this new 'women's history' were the struggles around pass laws, women's involvement in popular organizations and women's role in emergent township culture, issues that reflect the concerns of radical social history with class formation and popular organization."4 This work was uneven in the extent to which it attempted to theorize 'the position of black women', but in general women were construed as a specifically disadvantaged subsection of the urban or rural populations. Little structural or theoretical significance was accorded their gender difference. Relatedly the state, in this perspective, was seen to promulgate measures that addressed and affected black women in a particularly negative way -as in the extension of pass laws. But these effects tended to be perceived within the terms of general state policy and repression of Africans rather than as indicative of specifically patriarchal ruling interests. In the studies of women and pass laws which formed the bulk of this early women's history, state control and coercion of women was understood as an aspect of the structuring of the system of migrant labour. Measures enacted to restrict the presence of women in towns were interpreted in terms of the (contested) policy of preventing the development of a permanent African urban proletariat. In other words, 'women' were being fitted into a pre-existing, and gender-blind, analysis of the role of the apartheid capitalist state. The popular but theoretically vacuous phrase 'triple oppression' was widely used in this initial spurt of women's history, a formulation which implies a commensurability of the three kinds of oppression and offered no analysis of their dynamics or integration. It also tended to focus what 13 Cherryl Walker's study, Women and Resistance in South Africa (London, I982), remains the most comprehensive and definitive history of women's struggles and organizations. 14 For example Hilda Bernstein, For Their Triumphs and For Their Tears: Women in Apartheid South Africa (London, I985); Walker, Women and Resistance; Joanne Yawitch, 'Natal, I959: the women's protests' (paper presented to the Conference on the History of Opposition in Southern Africa, Johannesburg, I978); Helen Bradford, "'We are now the men": women's beer protests in the Natal countryside, I929', in Bozzoli (ed.), Class, Community, 292-323; and a number of papers on women's anti-pass struggles by Julia Wells, "'The day the town stood still ": women in resistance in Potchefstroom I9I2-I930', in Belinda Bozzoli (ed.), Township, Labour and Protest: Studies in the Social History of the Witwatersrand (Johannesburg, I979), 269-307; '"Passes and bypasses": freedom of movement for African women under the Urban Areas Act of South Africa', in Margaret Jean Hay and Marcia Wright (eds.), African Women and the Law: Historical Perspectives (Boston, I982), I26-50; and 'Why women rebel: a comparative study of South African women's resistance in Bloemfontein (I9I3) and Johannesburg (I958)', 7. Southern Afr. Studies, x (I983), 55-70.</page><page sequence="7">STATE AND GENDER 447 explanation there was for the specificity of gender oppression on the normative characteristics of 'women' themselves, those which defined women as different, rather than on gender relations or the gender character- istics of the ruling power (this being self-evidently racist and oppressive). For instance, the socially assigned responsibility of women for the care of children, instead of something to be explained, was seen as a reason for the particular hardships faced by African women under, and their resistance to, the apartheid state. This kind of explanation uncritically replicated the construction of women that was dominant in the discourse of the popular women s organizations themselves - namely, women as mothers. Implicit, and even explicit, in this approach was the reduction of women's difference and their vulnerability under the state to their essential - and some argued, materialist - capacity for biological reproduction. FUNCTIONAL WOMEN The tendency to understand the relationship between black women and the state as one unmediated by either men or gender was also evident in women's history carried out within another prevalent paradigm at this time (i.e. the late I970s, early Ig8os). Influenced by French marxist anthropology, a seminal article by Harold Wolpe argued that the function of the native reserves was to subsidize the sub-value wages of migrant labourers.15 This argument mirrored one about the function of the family-household (held to be the site of women's oppression) that was developing within the 'domestic labour debate' in western marxist feminism. These two strands of theory were easily transposed into an explanation for the oppression of African women in the rural reserves under capitalism."6 The role of the state in the oppression of African women, in this argument, was encapsulated in a significant intervention - the enactment of the 1927 Native Administration Act, which recognized, nationally, the institutions of African customary law (transformed and reinterpreted to be more restrictive in the process) as the central mechanism for confining women to the reserves and thereby ensuring the continuity of rural production. Because this Act (and other pieces of gender-discriminating influx control legislation) were understood in terms of the articulation of pre-capitalist and capitalist modes of production, their significance as both the entrenchment and legitimation of patriarchal forms of ruling and of control over women was obscured - points, I will go on to show, that are essential to understanding state formation. This approach has been thoroughly criticized, both for its functionalism and for the way it located the oppression of women solely in the rural reserves (or family-household, as the case may be) where the re/productive work of women contributed to capital accumulation.17 Applicable too is the more 15 Harold Wolpe, 'Capitalism and cheap labour power in South Africa: from segregation to apartheid', Economy and Society, I (972), 425-56. 16 Linzi Manicom, Marjorie Mbilinyi and Jeanette Hartmann, Women under Apartheid in South Africa (unpublished ms, Paris, I979); and Joanne Yawitch, 'Black women in South Africa: capitalism, employment and reproduction' (B.A. Honours dissertation, University of the Witwatersrand, I978). 17 Belinda Bozzoli, 'Marxism, feminism and South African studies', J.

It should be noted though that feminist appropriation of the 'cheap labour' thesis made too glib a sub- stitution of the category 'women' for what Wolpe (and incidentally the state itself in its arguments for a reserve system) conceived as 'the extended reserve family'. It is true that rural women were having to pick up the enormous burden of rural production as an increasing number of men spent periods away on migrant contracts. But it is important to understand that this work (and indeed the subordination of women) was organized by patriarchal familial relations even when men were physically absent, as much, in the broader sense, as by the relations of capitalist production - which themselves were organized by gender. DOMESTIC STRUGGLE It was this critique of 'the functionalist approach' that was central to Belinda Bozzoli's important and ambitious attempt to think through the implications of feminism for marxist South African studies.'9 Bozzoli problematized the facts that the migrant labour force that developed was male and that women took on the burden of rural production. This differentiation could not be taken for granted but had to be explained, historically. Resisting the obvious essentialist biological argument - women bear babies therefore, logically, naturally, men would migrate - she insisted that an understanding of the gender relations of pre-capitalist African societies was central to the ex- planation of the form of development of capitalism in South Africa. This insight - and the related questioning of the gender structuring of such apparently 'neutral' processes as proletarianization, urbanization and the making of the industrial labour force - represented a critical contribution to the reconceptualization of South African history. The two central theoretical constructs Bozzoli employed to elaborate her argument were, however, less convincing and influential. Trying to avoid the structuralism of the prevailing 'cheap labour thesis', she posited a rather amorphous notion of 'domestic struggle', the struggle between players in the domestic sphere over household resources. The outcome of this - a particular mode of female subordination - would shape the development of capitalism and, importantly here, although not specifically elaborated by Bozzoli, the form of the state. To describe the systems of female subordination that result from domestic struggle she used the notion of historically specific 'patriarchies'. This conception of particular patriarchies related to specific social organ- izations of production bears the problems of theoretical dualism with which marxist-feminism generally has had to contend.20 If the concept of patriarchy 18 See for example, Linda Nicholson, 'Feminism and Marx: integrating kinship with the economic', in Seyla Benhabib and Drucilla Cornell (eds.), Feminism as Critique (Minneapolis, I987), I6-30. 19 Bozzoli, 'Marxism, feminism'. 20 See the discussion by Iris Young, 'Beyond the unhappy marriage: a critique of dual systems theory', in Lydia Sargent (ed.), Women and Revolution (Montreal, I98I), 43-70.</page><page sequence="9">STATE AND GENDER 449 is to be given central analytic weight, what are the implications for the historical periodization of capitalist development? How to account for transition from one patriarchy to the next? Or is the explanatory power of patriarchy finally subordinate to that of capital accumulation as in most marxist feminist theorizing, rendering shifts in partriarchies ultimately epiphenomenal? Such issues remain confusing and unresolved in the text. They are, however, central to the project of re-thinking state and gender, for they pose questions about the relationship of state formation and patriarchy. A critical look at a couple of problematical areas in Bozzoli's con- ceptualization can help to clarify, or more correctly reveal the complexity of, the questions. In her concern to attribute agency to African societies and to their resistance in the shaping of capitalist development in South Africa, Bozzoli perhaps underemphasized the role of state formation in the gendered organization of the social relations of production. 'The state' is depicted as somehow external to patriarchal domestic systems. She argues that house- hold members were able to draw on 'wider societal legitimating political or economic forces to support them as protagonists in this [internal domestic] struggle', but whether such forces include aspects of the state is not clear. Mentioned only are such external resources as 'ideologies of male su- periority'. The dynamics of domestic struggle as this shapes capitalist development are then explained in terms of household relationships and the individual attitudes' of household members with their recourse to legitima- ting patriarchal ideologies.2" Absent from this apparently subjectivist ap- proach is an understanding of the structuring of domestic or household forms and relationships which took place increasingly through state regu- lation and various state measures. State practices not only constructed and legitimated gender divisions and domination within 'the domestic sphere' but also defined and established the very terms and arena in which 'domestic struggle' ensued. The second related issue is the analytic status Bozzoli attributes to 'the domestic sphere' and her tendency to locate patriarchy primarily within it. She claims, for instance, that the feminism of her approach is represented by the attention to some of the dialectical conflicts within the domestic sphere that produce social change, noting that these conflicts were often between men and women. The shaping capacities of patriarchy, according to her formulation, seem to reside in the 'pre-given' gender patterns of pre- capitalist African societies and in families or culturally specific 'different groups' in the modern era. But to assume the continuity of 'the domestic realm' as an analytic category from pre-capitalist to modern South Africa and across different types of societies, as this kind of explanation tends to, raises problems. For what it conceals is the historical construction of 'the domestic' as a separate, private and gender-identified sphere in opposition to ' the economy' (in one representation of this opposition) or to 'the public' (in another) as neutral, neutered spaces.22 And state formation is central to this 21 Bozzoli, 'Marxism, feminism', I47-8. 22 The debate about the relationship between patriarchy, the domestic sphere and the public sphere has produced a number of different positions. My argument here is influenced particularly by the writings of Linda Nicholson, who makes a strong case for understanding the constitution of those separate spheres historically in her Gender and</page><page sequence="10">450 LINZI MANICOM process, 'the state' itself being defined by and in relation to 'the domestic', where state practices and categorizations define, delimit and assign gender through constructions of 'the domestic' - be it the household, the family, the tribe. These designations are not once-off events that can explain women's subordination but are ongoing and shifting constructions, varying between class, race, culture and state policy.23 If an analysis of state formation is to avoid reproducing or casting its theory in terms of the prevailing normative gender and ideological meanings of 'the domestic sphere', it would need to explore and explain the historical constitution of this category, not assume it as pre-given. PRE-CAPITALIST GENDERED PRODUCTION There are two further areas of historical research that have been, and are potentially even more, significant in the development of a gendered under- standing of South African history and state formation, though neither would be characterized as 'gender studies' (particular given the tendency to treat gender as referring to women only). The first of these is the detailed research undertaken on indigenous African societies, tracing the transformations with the advent of mercantile capitalism, colonial rule and the genesis of the migrant labour system. Production, as many studies have shown, was organized along gender and generational lines (as well as other significant social divisions) and mediated by lobola, the regulation of marriage, fertility and familial form. As Bozzoli and Delius point out, Those concerned with realist humanism and influenced by Africanism have taken gender into account because gender cleavages are of inescapable importance in understanding the internal mode of operation, the lines of and the forms taken by the dissolution of African societies.24 The earlier research of this kind focused on the relation of control and exploitation of chiefs over what they conceived of as the production of young men and how this was effected through control over the productive and especially reproductive capacity of women.25 While this literature revealed the absolute centrality of the work of women for the reproduction of such societies, it took for granted (as Bozzoli pointed out) the subordination of African women. While the social relations between chiefs and men were portrayed as ones of domination and governance, those between men/chiefs and women were not perceived in the same way - as a contested relation of History (New York, I986); Carol Pateman, who explores the complexity of representa- tions of public and private within liberal, marxist and feminist theory in, for example, her essay 'Feminist critiques of the public/private dichotomy', in The Disorder of Women; and Nikolas Rose, 'Beyond the public/private division: law, power and the family', Journal of Law and Society, xiv (I987), 6I-76. 23 See particularly Rose, 'Beyond the public/private'. 24 Bozzoli and Delius, 'Radical history', 33. 25 See, for example, William Beinart, 'Production and the material basis of chief- tainship: Pondoland, c. I830-80', in Shula Marks and Anthony Atmore (eds.), Economy and Society in Pre-Industrial South Africa (London, I980), I20-47; and Jeff Guy, 'The destruction and reconstruction of Zulu society', in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone (eds.), Industrialisation and Social Change in South Africa (London, I982), I67-94.</page><page sequence="11">STATE AND GENDER 451 ruling. In more recent work, influenced by the circulation of feminist research and interpretation about the resistance of women to patriarchal control and to oppressive marriage forms, there is more explicit and argued acknowledgement of the relationship of power, politics and struggle between male elders and women within indigenous African societies prior to and especially during the restructuring of gender relations that took place during the colonial and early mining periods. Jeff Guy's most recent piece, where he argues that women's oppression must be understood within the terms of those societies themselves, is an excellent example of the acknowledgement of gender as a relation of governance.26 LEGAL HISTORY The second area of work relevant to the issues discussed here is that of South African legal history. A couple of texts are central - H. J. Simons' classic study of the legal status of African women in South Africa and Martin Chanock's work on 'the making of customary law' in Malawi.27 With an interpretation that has been widely adopted, Chanock accounted for the process in which male representatives from African communities encount- ered the colonial legal system at a point of insecurity as their control over the labour of women and young men was being eroded by wage labour. They represented African customary law to colonial rulers in ways that emphasized their control over women, interpretations which under the format of colonial legal procedures were rendered even more rigid. African patriarchal gender values converged with the colonial administrators' and judges' own patri- archal views and their administrative interests in controlling African women and strengthening the capacity of chiefs to govern locally. Cherryl Walker' deploys this argument in looking at gender and migrant labour in South Africa, and Jo Beall suggests a similar conclusion with reference to the enactment of repressive measures against Indian women under the system of indentured labour in Natal.28 This kind of investigation of the gender politics of the making and use of customary law could usefully be replicated more extensively within colonial and post-colonial South Africa to deepen our understanding of state formation as a gendered process. The authorization of certain (re)constituted 'traditional' marriage forms, for example, was a process both of gender regulation and of engendering 'the state' as male. It is significant that the visibility and analysis of state formation as a gendered and gendering process are much more acute with reference to the pre- and colonial periods of South African history than in the later industrializing or contemporary periods.

For the privileging and separation of the public, ruling sphere from the private, domestic sphere (or the 'traditional', indigenous sphere) have come to constitute unquestioned assumptions about state form. Equally, the routines and rituals of state rule, which invariably regulate and reproduce gender (such as census-taking, marriage registration, housing administration), have entrenched themselves as the 'obvious' way things are done, and the distinction and designation of state policy as social or economic or political in ways that organize and confirm gender have come to be taken as for granted.29 Where contemporary state practices are recognized as patriarchal it is only in the form of the unnaturally imposed relics of 'traditional' African societies, as in the conventional explanation of the system of customary law. This representation, in its appeal to historical hangover, just as effectively obscures the more recent history and gender dynamics of state formation. However, in pre-colonial South African societies - where the social relations of production were directly organized by gender and generational relations, by lobola and familial relations; where any attempt by the colonial admini- stration to reorganize productive relations meant an assault on, or at least disruption of, familial and gender relations and powers; and conversely, where attempts to reorder gender precipitated shifts in 'economic' power - the processes of gendered state formation were very much more immediate. GENDER MEANINGS The South African women's/gender history published in recent years evidences a considerable shift in the conceptualization and the deployment of the category of 'gender', as compared with the work of a decade or so ago. That men's and women's lives are differentially structured by gender, that men and women differently experience historical processes and daily life, is now taken as the starting point of analysis rather than as something to be demonstrated. Gender is not subordinated to the categories of race and class, but analyses attempt to identify the complex intertwining and mutual definition of these socially inscribed divisions. The focus of much of this contemporary gender history remains ' women) or those areas of social life with which women are more closely identified - family, domestic work, women's work in towns. The social historians' starting point of popular experience decrees this focus, for 'the domestic realm' is apparently the most immediately structuring of women's experience and consciousness. African women predominate as the main objects of study, but at the same time the divisions between women of different class, race and culture are demonstrated. The history of white women in terms of gender, class and race and language divisions is receiving some attention,30 as is the 29 The argument here is drawn particularly from that of Philip Corrigan and Derek Sayer in The Great Arch: English State Formation as Cultural Revolution (Oxford, I985).

A prominent theme is the domesticating mission of Christian and colonial education and its ambiguous accommodation to pre-colonial indigenous African gender ideology.32 Another theme that threads through various studies is the significance of the ideological constructs of 'mother' and 'the family' in popular cultures and in nationalist struggles, both African and Afrikaner.33 Studies of early urbanization explore the gender constructs around which policy and administration measures in relation to women were mobilized-'whore', 'evil, loose women', 'unruly' women.34 Where previously the concern was to demonstrate the varied and differ- entiating structure of the lives of women of different race, class, social and geographical locations, now the focus is on the multiple and changing social meanings that are signified by the category 'women'. Cherryl Walker discusses some of the issues as they affect historians: The meaning of 'woman' was not the same in precolonial as it was in twentieth century southern Africa; it was not the same in precolonial as it was in settler society. The differences went beyond obvious ones in the type of work and responsibilities assigned to women's roles. While both indigenous and settler women bore and raised children, this act took place in a web of socially specific relationships that were embedded in two profoundly different sets of productive relationships. Wife, mother, lover, daughter, sister, mother-in-law - these terms did not have the same range of reference or resonance in the two systems and were not readily translatable, even though officials, missionaries, philanthropists, employers and ordinary members of society regularly presumed to do just that.35 She goes on to mention the difficulties of trying to determine the relevant meanings of 'woman' at different historical conjunctures, taking into account how definitions would vary across the race, gender and class of those subscribing to them and that those of the ruling men would most likely have prevailed in historical record. 'Even within a single period', she maintains, ' the boundaries of the category " woman " are rendered extremely elusive by the operation of other significant markers of social power'. 31 E.g. T.

The status and meaning of 'women' within history is a complex, contested issue within feminist scholarship.36 Feminist historians working within a post-structuralist framework take that instability as a starting point for their investigation, accepting that 'women' are always constituted historically and socially within discourse. There is no pre-given, historically 'true' 'woman' or 'women' that can be ferreted out from beneath the ideological overlaying of racial and class versions of womanhood, no essential or natural defining feature of women that can explain gender difference. To assume a fixed opposition between men and women suppresses the diversity within each of those binary categories, invariably allowing normative or essentialist gender definitions to infuse our understandings. It removes from investigation that which has to be explained, namely, the meanings of those gender categories relative to their histories, relative to other social con- structions. Denise Riley argues for a shift in the project of feminist historical inquiry from that of producing theories ' about the timelessness of the binary opposition of sexual antagonism and about the history of ideas of women' to look instead at the 'course of alignments into gendered categories'.37 GENDERED RULING RELATIONS Problematizing the category of 'women' and understanding it as historically constructed within discourse is, I argue, particularly relevant for re-thinking the relationship of state and gender in South African history. It immediately implies a critique of the prevailing formulations of the relationship of 'the state' to 'women' that are implicit in most South African studies.38 Where, as shown in the preceding review, some of the studies emphasize the ways in which the state specifically and disadvantageously differentiates women from men, others emphasize the different implications or impacts of (apparently neutral) state policy on men and women and the different experiences of state measures by men and women. But both these perspectives take for granted the category of 'women' (even where the category may be more narrowly defined, as, for example, in looking at ' African working class women'). They also assume gender difference (generally referring to women's location 36 Sandra Harding, 'The instabilities of the analytical categories of feminist theory', Signs, xi (I986), 645-65; Linda Alcoff, 'Cultural feminism versus post-structuralism: the identity crisis in feminist theory', Signs, xiii (I988), 405-36; Mohanty, 'Under western eyes'; Riley, Am I That Name?; and Scott, Gender and the Politics of History. 37 Riley, Am I That Name?, 7. 38 As mentioned previously, there has been little explicit theoretical focus on state and gender or women in published South African history. There is much more such work referring to other African regions, but most of this would be subject to the same critique. SVe for example, the recent collection of articles on Women and the State in Africa edited by Jane Parpart and Kathleen Staudt (Boulder, I989). Both the introduction and the articles represent a range of theoretical perspectives and issues around gender and state, many of which reproduce the externalized relationship that I am depicting here. Margot Lovett, for example, in a useful summary article on 'Gender relations, class formation, and the colonial State' that outlines the various ways in which gender relations are both institutionalized and resisted in and through state practices, reduces the understanding of gendered state formation to 'the differential impacts on women and men' (p. 23).</page><page sequence="15">STATE AND GENDER 455 within a social division of labour and their biological capacities). Scott outlines the problems residing in these assumptions: By assuming that women have inherent characteristics and objective identities consistently and predictably different from men's, and that these generate definably female needs and interests, historians imply that sexual difference is a natural rather than a social phenomenon. The search for an analysis of dis- crimination gets caught by a circular logic in which 'experience' explains gender difference and gender difference explains the asymmetries of male and female 'experience '.39 The conventional formulations equally imply a pre-existing, unitary category of 'the state' with a coherent ruling project and essential functions and interests. Within the prevailing marxist paradigm of radical South African women's history, these interests are (often implicitly) designated as capital accumulation and social control.40 This everyday, anthropomorphic and monolithic representation of 'the state' is clearly analytically inadequate. The point is now widely taken that the state is not a unitary structure, to be wielded instrumentally by the ruling class, and for that matter, ruling gender.41 It is rather a differentiated set of institutions and agencies, the policies of which in relation to women (or to any category of subjugated people) cannot be assumed to be coherent nor necessarily and inevitably congruent with the project of capital accumulation or patriarchal and racial domination.42 The range and complexity of institutions, policies and prac- tices that are lumped together under the rubric of 'the state' is very apparent in twentieth-century history, but even the comparatively less differentiated 'colonial state' can be shown to have sustained diverse and contending policies and ruling objectives in relation to the indigenous people of South Africa and to 'women'. Philip Abrams, and in a different way Nicos Poulantzas, take apart the idea of 'the state' even more profoundly. They understand it as an ideological abstraction which in its appearance of unity and externality to society or social classes obscures the very relations and practices through which rule is effected.43 Abrams argues for conceiving the project of state as 'politically organized subjection'. Investigation of 'the state' in this view involves not only an analysis of the institutional forms, practices and ideologies of its disaggregated parts but also the study of the way in which the relations and objects of rule are constituted within and by what Poulantzas calls 'the institutional materiality' of the state. Neither of these theorists paid attention 39 Scott, Gender and the Politics of History, 4. 40 Such interests are not always stated explicitly but can be readily inferred in much of the work on South Africa. See for example, the articles by Walker, 'Gender and migrant labour', and Beall, 'Women under indentured labour', in Walker (ed.), Women and Gender in Southern Africa, I68-96 and I46-67. 41 Wolpe in Race, Class and the Apartheid State and Greenberg in Legitimating the Illegitimate make the point about the non-unitary character of the state with reference to South Africa. 42 Melanie Randall, 'Feminism and the state: questions for theory and practice', Resources for Feminist Research, XVII (I988), I3-I4, makes the argument for problema- tizing the categories of 'state' and 'women' in similar terms. 43 Philip Abrams, 'Notes on the difficulty of studying the state (I977)', J7ournal of Historical Sociology, I (I988), 58-89, and Nicos Poulantzas, State, Power, SociaTism (London, I 978).</page><page sequence="16">456 LINZI MANICOM to gender, but their approaches suggest ways in which to understand and analyse how gender is assigned and deeply embedded through state practices and forms. Corrigan and Sayer (who, in a similar approach, do point to the analytical implications of gender) emphasize the 'moral regulation' inherent in state formation, the valorization of particular social and political relation- ships and identities and the marginalization of others; in their own words, 'a project of normalizing, rendering natural, taken for granted, in a word "obvious", what are in fact ontological and epistemological premises of a particular and historical form of social order'." Those premises of the long historical process of state formation are ones predicated fundamentally on gender differentiation. The routines of bureaucratic administration, the recording of demographic information, the application of dress codes and bureaucratic procedures, the regulation of labour, marriage and schooling - all of these are examples of every-day state forms and practices which institute patterns of gender (as well as race, class, ethnicity, age, locality, etc.) as they politically organize gender (et al.) subjectivities. The naming and recording of 'the Native' as the head of household in the administration of urban townships in the early years of the century, as a moment of moral regulation and gendered state formation, was an example of the way in which an apparently neutral regulatory procedure inscribed gender and authorized a particular social form. ' The Native' as a category of rule was a masculine one. African women were always distinctively desig- nated when addressed within urban administration discourse as 'the wife of' or, if not definable in terms of a legitimate relation to a man, as 'the Native woman) , a sexualized construct and one that was framed as a social problem. Not only was the proper urban subject being constructed in this process as masculine, or, secondarily, a married female, but so was the accepted, ideal social form of urban family-household. The categories in terms of which 'the population' is ruled, and which establish the boundaries of the ruled population, are constituted within and by the ' official discourses' (commission reports, parliamentary debates, laws); by administration practices (rules and procedures); within the social spaces defined and delineated in state policy and by state formation itself (the family, the economy, the polity). 'The state' in its policy and legislation invokes, appeals to, interpellates (to use the Althusserian term), regulates, not men or women as concrete historical subjects but rather the gender categories of 'women' and 'men' as defined and constructed within the particular discourses and practices of ruling. As recent South African gender histories have revealed, different policy discourses and legislation refer to African women, for example, in a variety of ways - as mothers, as wives, as blacks, as workers - steeping those constructs in racial, sexual and class ideologies. But what is important to stress, is that in doing so, state policy and practices are also constructing 'women' as objects of rule, reproducing or restructuring normative gender meanings and subordinate social and political identities in the same process. The construction and regulation of gender clearly do not take place only in and through state agencies and administrative practices. As Nikolas Rose argues: " Corrigan and Sayer, The Great Arch, 4.</page><page sequence="17">STATE AND GENDER 457 The state is not ... the locus of all social power, but a complex set of agencies which are involved to different extents in projects for the regulation of social and economic life whose origins, inspirations and power often come from elsewhere.45 Non-state sites of moral and gender regulation, such as churches, familial relations, indigenous social organization, political organizations, were and are critically involved in the ordering of political subjection at different historical moments.46 The role of Christianity and the missionaries during the colonial period, the focus of much historical study, was particularly important in shaping appropriate ideals of Christian African womanhood, in reconstructing gender during the establishment of colonial rule.47 However, in trying to understand 'the state' as gendered, what is important is the way in which, historically, pre-existing forms of power and gender regulation are appropriated and transformed by the institutions of rule (as in the making of customary law). At the same time the jurisdictional boundaries of 'state' and ' non-state' areas of social life are ordered and re-ordered along gender lines, such as the shifting public/private divide. What distinguishes the gendered relations of ruling re/produced in state practices and procedures and the social categorizations taken up within official discourse is the particular form of power and legitimation they bear. This power derives not only from the threat of punishment for transgression, nor from the rationalizing male and white supremacist ideology that is present in their terms and meanings. The power of gendered ruling relations and definitions resides in their ongoing confirmation and materiality within state forms that organize political subjection. I'm suggesting, with this argument, that 'the state' in South African history should be understood not merely in terms of state policy that reflects patriarchal and racist ideology but rather as organized by gender (and race) difference and subordination in its very formation. Looking at the formation of 'the state' as a relation of ruling, and refusing essentialist definitions of 'women', implies a departure from the question of whether gender, race or class factors and interests are dominant in state policy.48 It suggests rather the examination of the constructions of 'women' that are being produced in different state policies and practices to see how these are more or less infused with gender, race or sexual meanings relative to and within different contexts of ruling. For example, in much colonial and early Union official discourse, the construct of 'African woman' was invested heavily with female sexuality and patriarchal propriety; whereas mid- 45 Rose, 'Beyond the public/private', 7 I . 46 State theorists have variously accounted for the relationship between that which is formally acknowledged as 'the state' and the more extensive domain of ruling: Gramsci with his notion of hegemony, Althusser's 'ideological state apparatuses', Foucault's understanding of the dispersion and varieties of disciplinary power. See Lorna Weir's discussion of this point in 'Studies in the medicalization of sexual danger: sexual rule, sexual politics, I830-I930' (Ph.D. thesis, York University, Toronto, I986), I3-23. 47 See Gaitskell, 'Devout domesticity?'; Hughes, "' A lighthouse for African woman- hood "', and Sheila Meintjies, 'Family and gender in the Christian community at Edendale, Natal, in colonial times'; all in Walker (ed.), Women and Gender in Southern Africa, 25 I-72; I97-220 and I 25-45. 48 This way of formulating the theoretical question represents an extension of the race- class debate in South African historiography, but it does not shift the terms of that debate.</page><page sequence="18">458 LINZI MANICOM century state discourses around the question of the appropriate form of labour force organization (whether migrant or urbanized) constructed 'African women' more in terms of racial and cultural identities (i.e. as Natives, as tribal) and in terms of gendered spatial associations (the Reserves, the traditional family). Deconstructing such categories as 'African women' within historical state discourse to reveal their gender, race and class meanings, it becomes apparent that different interests and objectives were being addressed in distinct but contemporaneous policy formulations. The focus of historical investigation then becomes not what 'the state' did to 'African women' but how and why different social concerns got taken up in policy in terms of particular constructions of gender and how gender difference and subordination were being regulated. For example, looking at policy that specifically addressed 'the African family' in the first three decades of the twentieth century, it is clear that its origins and promoting agencies were many and varied, ranging from mine labour regulation to reports on sexual offences, to urban administration and to concerns about declining rural agricultural production. Taking cognizance of this variety by examining the particular contexts and discourses in which 'African women' or 'African family' were constructed can allow interpretation of the some- times contradictory or anomalous policy of a particular government. Equally, a single state measure directed at women may have been motivated by a number of interests which invoked different constructs of 'African women', the specificities of which get obscured by a general explanation of a repressive state's quest 'to control women'. For example, measures enacted to regulate the presence of African women in towns in the I930S were argued for in terms of women as sexual subjects (prostitutes), as racial subjects (anti- miscegenation, bred by the urban proximity of the races), as economic subjects (whose beer-brewing enterprise was depriving local state authorities of revenue) and as disciplinary subjects (unruly populations requiring policing). The laws that were mobilized to keep women out of the towns variously specified them as wives, and as daughters, as tribal members and as the property and responsibility of men whose patriarchal power the laws were thus reinforcing and legitimizing. In her exploration of gender as a useful category of historical analysis Joan Scott argues that gender is 'a primary way of signifying relationships of power', or 'a primary field within which or by means of which power is articulated'." Gender meanings are mobilized as metaphors of governance and of domination and subordination in relation to specific historic regimes and then concretized in particular measures. There are many illustrations of this process to be drawn from South African history. For example: within African societies, the (paramount) chief was/is regarded as 'the father of the people', a patriarchal power appropriated by the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa in the I927 Native Administration Act; in the early phases of urbanization the central problem of governance was represented as 'the control of women' and implemented in restrictive influx control measures; both Afrikaner and African nationalisms were articulated signi- ficantly through ideologies of gender and family and imprinted in male- Joan Scott, 'Gender: a useful category of historical analysis', Gender and the Politics Of HistorY, 45.</page><page sequence="19">STATE AND GENDER 459 empowering marital legislation.50 As Scott points out, measures against women enacted by (particularly repressive) states might make little sense in terms of the women themselves, or in terms of gains the state might make from the control and repression of women, but may represent an assertion of domination and consolidation of power that was given form as a policy about women.5' In this process of invoking gender to express and legitimate a particular relationship of power or domination, the hierarchical gender relationship is reproduced and confirmed both ideologically and in state regulation and policy. Gender is being made as a ruling relation. 'The problem of women' within the urban areas, 'the breakdown of the African family' - these were two significant gendered metaphors that were mobilized at a number of points of crisis in rule during the first half of the twentieth century in South Africa. How did the representation of such crisis as a social and moral problem focussing on 'women' and 'family' help establish the terms of its resolution (as involving the control of women's movement and sexuality) and contribute towards a construction of gender that rendered African women 'unruly' and specific patriarchal forms and relationships in 'the family' as in need of repair and reinforcement? RETHINKING STATE? Bozzoli and Delius mention in their review the new course that research generally on the state has taken in radical South African history, one which moves away from the more over-arching instrumentalist conceptions of the state toward a more nuanced understanding of the conflicts and divisions within the institutions of the state, the shaping of its form by social cleavages and popular struggles as much as by capitalist interest.52 What can this new direction in theory contribute toward understanding specifically state for- mation and gender in South African history? Saul Dubow and Stanley Greenberg are two of the historians mentioned as approaching 'the state' in a new way. Their work examines the actual institutional workings and conflicts of state departments and the elaboration and transformations in ideologies which guided these.53 The attention paid to the actual structures and processes of governance in these texts represents a significant advance over the previous abstract 'race-class' state theorization. But both of these otherwise insightful analyses are profoundly marred by a gender-blindness. Dubow, for instance, discusses in detail the passing of the Native Administration Act without seeing it as the institutionalization and legitimation of patriarchal (as well as paternal) ruling relations. Although Greenberg mentions those aspects of labour regulation that affect black 50 See the argument of Gaitskell and Unterhalter, 'Mothers of the nation'. 51 Scott, 'Gender: a useful category', 47. 52 Bozzoli and Delius, 'Radical history', 32-3. 53 Saul Dubow, Racial Segregation and the Origins of Apartheid in South Africa, 1919-36 (Oxford, I989), looks at the establishment and institutional development of the Native Administration Department in the inter-war years, importantly tracing the elaboration of the segregationist ideology with reference to the development of thinking around 'race'. Greenberg, in Legitimating the Illegitimate, looks more contemporarily at the institutions of labour control at their various levels of practice, examining the recent ideological shifts that attempted to legitimate a state whose narrow ruling base makes it inherently illegitimate.</page><page sequence="20">460 LINZI MANICOM women, he adopts and reproduces uncritically the masculine naming and ideological constructions of 'labour', 'the worker', 'the blacks', that abound in the discourse of state and market in South Africa, historically and today - a point to which I return. The significance of the analysis of customary law for understanding how specific moments of state formation are historically gendered (an argument originally articulated by Martin Chanock) was mentioned previously. Chanock's newer work-in-progress - a history of legalism in South Africa - potentially opens further avenues for concrete historical investigation of the 'making of law' in relation to the 'making of gender'. Chanock argues, as I would, that an analysis of law is central to understanding state formation. He rejects the understanding of law as super-structural or legitimating a particular regime of rule as some brands of marxist and feminist legal theory would have it. His focus is rather on how the law works as a mechanism of power, as 'that which contributes to the creation of the categories of persons and their powers which are fundamental to the workings of any society'.54 The 'categories of persons' that Chanock understands as being constituted in law are gendered ones, although Chanock himself (disappointingly) does not emphasize gender in the article referred to. His concern with patriarchal and gender relations appears confined to discussions of the customary law system and disappears when the subject turns to common law.55 This displacement of an acknowledgement of gender as a relation of ruling to 'traditional' African customary law (a displacement in time, a relic; a displacement in space, to 'the Other') is all too common in understandings of state formation and governance in South Africa. The kind of analysis being proposed is consonant with a number of contemporary critiques of law and legalism which draw on the methodology of Foucault to examine how the claim to truth of the abstraction 'the law' works as a mechanism of power and how legal subjectivity is constituted within discourses of law.56 Corrigan and Sayer draw attention to the taken- for-granted aspects associated with the legal process - the legal recordings, the court rituals that legitimate legal rulings, the naming of persons under the law - as elements of state formation which are based on, and produce social divisions like, race and gender. The definitions of 'husband' and 'wife' and laws about marriage in customary and common law, the very fact of marriages being recorded and contestable in court, the assumptions about domestic arrangements that inform labour regulation, the regulation of ' normal' sexuality - all represent fundamental material and moral con- structions of gender integral to state formation. A feminist elaboration of the kind of historical project that Chanock has undertaken will contribute much 5' Chanock, 'Writing South African legal history', 273-4. 5 It is perhaps unfair to judge a body of work-in-progress on the basis of its published prospectus only, but it remains striking and indicative of a particular perception of the significance of gender that Chanock, when discussing common law, mentions criminal law, labour law and constitutional law but refers to only the systematic racial differen- tiation and discrimination in these forms, not those of gender, and also makes no reference to what is called 'family law' where patriarchal relations were so obviously constructed. 56 See, for example, Carol Smart, Feminism and the Power of Law (London, I989), and Jerry Palmer and Frank Pearce, 'Legal discourse and state power: Foucault and the juridical relation', International Journal of the Sociology of the Law, xi (I983), 36 I-83.</page><page sequence="21">STATE AND GENDER 46I to an understanding of law not just as discriminating against women but also as constitutive of gender. Another distinctive approach to understanding state formation is found in Adam Ashforth's recent analysis of the official discourse of the 'Grand Tradition' of South African government commission reports, those which had as their objective the posing and resolution of 'the Native question'.57 Ashforth is concerned to understand the persistent exclusion of Africans from citizenship within a unified nation-state, not merely as the effect of a hegemonic white supremacist ideology but also as a power/knowledge relation. He looks at how the (mis)representation of concrete lives within the terms and categories of state discourse circumscribes and structures the ways of addressing the political arrangements of rule and subjection in South Africa and how these forms of representation thereby rationalize and legitimize the various 'resolutions' which are put in place by the commissions to what was constituted as 'the Native problem'. Ashforth traces the way in which knowledge about 'the Native' (later, Blacks) was constructed in the official discourse of these major reports, showing how the meaning of 'the Native' was established and produced in relation to other significant categories of population - such as labour and citizen - and other dimensions of governance - such as territory and representation. The association of citizenship with territory and the submersion of the designation 'labour' to the identification 'Native' within official discourse produce a legitimating framework for the particular forms of representation of Africans within labour and political formations. Ashforth's sophisticated and sensitive analysis, which cannot be done justice here, offers a way of understanding South African state formation that is neither economically reductionist nor instrumentalist. It is, however, flawed by its blindness to gender. For Ashforth failed to identify and analyse the shifting historical constructions of the categories of 'the Native' (as well as 'labour', 'citizen', etc.) and hence of state formation itself as funda- mentally gendered. A gendered reading of those same 'Grand Tradition' commissions would point to the universalization of the abstract male African in the constitution of the central political subject, 'the Native', even though the meaning and significance of that category shifted with each historical reorganization of knowledge about 'the Native question' that the Commis- sions worked to establish. It would also analyse how metaphors and meanings of gender were integral to the legitimation of ruling policy. The point is not that Ashforth failed to look at 'women', nor that the commission reports gave them no mention. On the contrary, as part of the subject and subordinated population, 'Native women' made not-infrequent appearances in the writings of the commissions. But the set of assumptions and concerns that framed discussions of 'Native women' positioned them differently than 'the Native' - the masculinized general category. When 'Native women' were recognized in official discourse, it tended to be in ways that both confirmed their subordination to men and which legitimized the construction of 'the native' as 'Other', and therefore subject to different 57 Adam Ashforth, The Politics of Official Discourse in Twentieth-Century South Africa (Oxford, I990). Ashforth analysed the major commission reports from the South African Native Affairs Commission (I903-5) through to the Manpower Utilization Commission (Riekert, of I977-80).</page><page sequence="22">462 LINZI MANICOM forms of governance. By failing to analyse gender as a significant social difference that was structured by and through official discourse, Ashforth is not only reproducing, uncritically, historical gender constructs which dis- place women, but he is also forfeiting some of the dimensions of an explanation for the continuity of a segregated state formation. Sometimes women were signified as 'and his wife', an hierarchical consttruction of gender difference. More often African women appeared in the commissions' proceedings as 'the problem of women', a gendered and sexualized representation of what were in fact, broader social and political issues, as discussed earlier. It is important to understand that the way in which 'women' were represented in discourse had real consequence in their lives. The forms of moral and physical regulation of African men and women that were the logical set of policy or administrative options in response to 'the problem' construed in such gender and sexual terms organized and constrained their subjection in particular ways. When Commission reports worked to establish the difference between 'the Native' and 'the citizen' on account of 'his' different social conditions and culture, 'Native women' were understood as expressive of that disqualifying cultural difference with their distinctive femininity, their location within the patriarchal familial organization and the different/unequal gender relations organized by lobola and marriage. The silencing and exclusion from the national political community of 'the Native' through specified differences was thus a compounded silencing and exclusion for 'the Native woman'. An understanding of state formation along these lines would also need to take account of the exclusion from the 'universal political community' until I930 of white women. Their exclusion, like that of 'the Native', was rationalized and legitimated in terms of 'natural' difference, established too by spatial association (the domestic realm), their being non-bearers of property, being subordinated within a marriage contract and not bearing the attributes (such as rationality, voice and male-defined labour) associated with citizenship.58 CONCLUSION These tentative and general explorations of how gender might be integrated into Ashforth's analysis are suggestive of the potential that this kind of approach holds for gender-aware reinterpretations of state formation. Such an approach is clearly incompatible with a conceptualization of gender that focuses on women or the relations between men and women. That narrow interpretation of gender overlooks or even excludes from analysis all those areas of social life, those state institutions, policies and practices that apparently do not concern women. It also implies that the meaning of gender 58 Carole Pateman, The Sexual Contract (Cambridge, I988), and ' The Civic Culture: A philosophic critique', in The Disorder of Women (Stanford, I989), I4I-78. See Walker, 'The Women's Suffrage Movement', for a political history of the struggle for and around the franchise of white women in South Africa. The masculine abstractions of 'the white man' and 'the black man' remain the official and everyday terms in which central relations of governance and subjection are signified in South Africa today. The collectivities 'migrant workers' and 'urban blacks' might appear to be gender-neutral, but their masculinity becomes apparent when women are invoked as a special condition or a designated relation - 'female migrants', 'and his wife', 'women-headed households'.</page><page sequence="23">STATE AND GENDER 463 categories can be taken for granted, the experience of women generalized. That limited conceptualization has been challenged not only by post- structuralist feminist theory but significantly also by black, indigenous and 'Third World' women in their critique of certain ethnocentric tendencies in 'Western feminism'. It has also been challenged rather implicitly, as I have shown, in the more recent South African women's and gender history where the meanings and experience of 'women' so obviously have no fixed and unitary content. The shift in the objective of history that is prompted by the re-conceptualization of gender is characterized by Joan Scott in this way: The story is no longer about the things that have happened to women and men and how they have reacted to them, instead it is about how the subjective and collective meanings of women and men as categories of identity have been constructed.59 The refusal to take categories of social identity for granted (whether political, juridical or biological) and the examination of their historical and social construction within official and dominant discourse are methodological strategies shared by some of the recent innovative analyses of state formation and relations of ruling in South Africa discussed above.60 A gendered analysis of South African state formation could fruitfully integrate the insights of these two approaches. The direction that I am proposing implies a shift in theoretical pre- occupation and perspective, away from questions of who rules and why to one of how rule is achieved.6' This is not to negate the general analytical and political intention of those former questions but rather to push through the theoretical sterility that has come to characterize the race-class debate in South African historiography and open up new questions. That debate, arguably, cannot be salvaged by adding 'patriarchy' as a third contender for analytic primacy in theorizing 'the South African state'. The notion of 'the patriarchal state' is certainly descriptively accurate at a general level, and it certainly represents a politically important corrective to the prevailing characterization, particularly in the light of the endemic gender-blindness of South African studies. But analytically, whether named directly (which it rarely has been in historical studies) or implied (which is more often the case in women's history), it is a formulation riddled with problematic assump- tions. Applied to 'the state', the blunt concept of patriarchy occludes more than it illuminates. The disaggregation of 'the state' into its institutional diversity, as proposed by historians wanting to gain a more historically and empirically 59 Scott, Gender and the Politics of History, 6. 60 I am here referring particularly to the work of Ashforth and to that of Martin Chanock as set out in his 'Prospectus'. There is an increasing body of unpublished work that is exploring similar approaches. 61 Philip Corrigan, 'State formation (entry for a dictionary)', in Social Forms/Human Capacities (London/New York, I 990), 264. This refocusing reflects the influence of Foucault's approach to analysing power; see particularly 'The subject and power', Critical Inquiry, xiii (I982), 777-95; 'Questions of method', Ideology and Consciousness, VII (I98I), 3-I4; and 'Governmentality', Ideology and Consciousness, vI (I979), 5-2I. A similar concern with the way in which governance is achieved is found in Dorothy E. Smith's elaboration of the concept 'relations of rule' where she looks at the textual mediation of social organization and forms of ruling; see The Conceptual Practices of Power (London, I99O) and Texts, Facts and Femininity (Toronto, I99O).</page><page sequence="24">464 LINZI MANICOM grounded understanding of state policy and struggles between different state bodies, does little to open space for gender considerations. While a definite advance over the ideal of a monolithic and coherent state, a disaggregated view of the state can quite comfortably reproduce a gender-blind analysis, as shown. Perhaps if such detailed investigations of particular institutional histories focused on state policy and bodies directly concerned with women or gender issues, some questioning of the overall gender order and theory of 'the state' would be the outcome. Understanding state formation as gendered involves moving beyond the view of 'the state' or state policy as oppressing, neglecting, victimizing, protecting or denying 'women' as if the contents and interests of this gender category are pre-given. It involves looking also at how gendered racial and class political subjectivity is produced and hierarchically organized by state discourses and practices as these vary across policy and institutions. It involves conversely not just showing that women have been excluded from the historical definitions of 'worker', 'the African' and 'citizen', for example, but also how those fundamental categories of social and political analysis came to be suffused with gender assumptions. The representation of such categories (and the broader social divisions of private and public, family and economy, that underwrite them) as natural and neutral, and the obscuring of their normative gender, race, class and sexual attributes that denied political subjectivity in all who did not bear them, is precisely the achievement of the process of state formation that must be brought to light. Several recent reviews of South African historiography have called for self-reflection and theoretical renewal in the field.62 Though there is some recognition of feminist analysis as bringing new energy to South African social science, the theoretical and methodological implications of gender as an analytic category are nowhere near being sufficiently asserted in the re- thinking that is proposed.63 This gender silence is particularly significant in the field of political and state history where the stirrings of renewal are being felt. If South African left historiography wants to retain its radical credentials and to continue to hold out the promise of history's relevance to popular resistance against all oppressive social relations, historians and critical reviewers will have to take on gender analysis with all its challenging implications. 62 Jeremy Krikler, in a review of P. Bonner, I. Holmeyr, D. James and T. Lodge (eds.), Holding Their Ground: Class, Locality and Culture in igth and 20th Century South Africa (Johannesburg, I989), makes this point strongly, quoting Dunbar Moodie and Colin Bundy as having voiced similar concerns. Bozzoli and Delius more cautiously advocate an advance towards 'creative theory building as our work matures' ('Radical history', 35). See Krikler, 'Waiting for the historians', South African Review of Books, iii (i99o), I6-I7. 63 Krikler, in his review, does point to the intellectual tradition of socialist feminism as constituting 'one of the vital and original components of the social science of the South African Left' (p. I6), but he gives no indication of how that tradition might be disturbing previous paradigms of historical interpretation. My review has suggested that the socialist feminist tradition has, in the past, tended to be confined largely to inserting women into the historical picture and benignly incorporating their histories into the prevailing marxist theory.</page><page sequence="25">STATE AND GENDER 465 SUMMARY Although South African women's history has been growing in volume and sophistication over the past decade, the impact of gender analysis has yet to be felt in mainstream or radical historiography. One reason for this neglect is the way in which the categories of both 'gender' and 'women' have been conceived - with 'women' assumed to have a stable referent and 'gender' treated as synonymous with women. Those areas of social life where women are not immediately present have thus remained unreconstructed by the theoretical implications of gender. This is particularly the case with the history of 'the state'. The article identifies and looks critically at the major paradigms of South African women's and gender history in terms of how the relationship between 'the state' and 'women' is implicitly or explicitly represented. It argues that the understanding of the category 'women' as socially and historically constructed (as evident in more recently published gender history) provides a way of moving beyond the more static or abstractly posed state-versus-women relationship. This requires too that 'the South African state' be understood not as unitary or coherent but as institutionally diverse with different objectives being taken up and produced as policy and practice. The project then becomes one of understanding South African state formation as a gendered and gendering process, of exploring the different institutional sites and ruling discourses in which gender identities and categories are constructed.</page></plain_text>
