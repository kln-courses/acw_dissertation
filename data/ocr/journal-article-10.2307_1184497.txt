<plain_text><page sequence="1">LAGUNA SYMBOLIC GEOGRAPHY AND SILKO'S CEREMONY Edith Swan SESLIE MARMON SILKO'S critically acclaimed novel Ceremony (1977) weaves a tapestry of interlacing stories depicting the Laguna' world as seen from the vantage point of the mixed-blood hero, Tayo, the novelist's alter ego. Tayo must function in and come to terms with the cosmos spun by the thought process of Spider Woman. Silko attributes her "story ceremony" to this source (1977:1), indelibly dyeing the warp and weft of the novel with the sacred, immortal voice of genesis, the universe maker. The spatial/temporal paradigm of the world that Spider Woman fabricated for the Laguna forms Laguna symbolic geography. This cipher to the Laguna cosmic system serves as a guide in understanding Tayo's spiritual journey towards health and harmony after leaving his family to fight in the Pacific during World War II. He returns a sick, battle-weary veteran. Through his affliction Tayo is transformed into a culture hero. Like his counterpart in folklore who is carried by an eagle to visit Spider Woman (Boas 1928:146-7), the golden eagle insignia of the U.S. Army coupled with Tayo's curse of the tropical rain when his brother Rocky dies precipitate a quest for spiritual mentors- Ku'oosh, Betonie, the Hunter, Mountain Lion, Night Swan, the Mexican captive, and Ts'eh. Eventually, this search also leads to Spider Woman, the Creatrix. Each of these characters represents qualities associated with powers inherent to a cardinal direction. By virtue of his interactional relationship with these personae, Tayo can harness the potency of the sunwise cycle on the one hand and incorporate the ceremonial nature of male and female on the other. Tayo's wish for a "safe return" is realized in the balance and harmony he seeks during his gradual reinstatement with the land combined with the removal of witchcraft through the ritual termed Ghost Way2 performed by the Navajo med- icine man, Betonie. Tayo's journey brings to light the beauty, sophis- tication and complexity of the Laguna world view. Spider Woman: The Creative Force Primacy of the oral tradition figures strongly in Laguna mythology. Speech distinguishes humans from animals and contains the raison d'etre of life according to cheani3 Ku'oosh: "no word exists alone, and 229</page><page sequence="2">230 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1988 the reason for choosing each word had to be explained with a story about why it must be said this certain way. That was the responsibility that went with being human, old Ku'oosh said" (Silko 1977:36-7). Tayo knew he caused the rain to cease because he cursed it, prayed it away (ibid: 203): "he damned the rain until the words were a chant ... He wanted the words to make a cloudless blue sky.. ." (ibid: 12; my emphasis). Consequently, bad thoughts forged drought and desiccation in the environment, a state mirrored by Tayo's wracking disease. Lit- erally and figuratively, Tayo dries up, victimized by his own thoughts articulated into words. These affect the author just as they affect the earth to which he is inextricably bound. This quintessential power of thought, "the master mind that has always existed," is embodied as Grandmother Spider (Gunn 1917:89). Spider Woman is Thought-Woman, the creator on the opening page of Ceremony, who thought the story Silko told. As thoughts are spoken and "things" are named, they become reality (Silko 1977:1). Words, then, mark the inception of the world. They begin it by giving ideas both form and density. Laguna origin myths commence in the following manner: Long ago, [Spider Woman] finished everything, thoughts and the names of everything here on earth, and she also finished all the different lan- guages (Boas 1928:7) ... In the beginning Thought-Woman lived in the lower world. There was nothing but water except a small island in the middle. Indians and Mexicans and Whites were created there. Thought- Woman looked like a man. She was called Thought-Woman because her thoughts were always carried into action (ibid: 221). Consequently, the Laguna hold that the world is a projection of thought encapsulated in stories. Spider Woman makes and names everything, makes and names essentials by singing reality into being. The two creator sisters (or sister and brother) become "our Mothers" ("our Mother and our Father"). She plans the universe, she teaches the creators. Aside from the creation of the world through the agency of language, Spider Woman's other gifts are also legendary: she originates the "sunwise" cycle, the ultimate model for correct ceremonial order, and forms the Place of Emergence (ibid: 22). Laguna Symbolic Geography The Laguna call Spider Woman's Emergence Place shipap. It ap- pears in the middle section of Table I, the central point permitting access to or egress from the four4 lower worlds. Folklore depicts the gradual upward progress of the people who still appear in their super- natural form. They climb from one world to the next, successively</page><page sequence="3">LAGUNA SYMBOLIC GEOGRAPHY AND SILKO'S CEREMONY 231 going from the white to the red, blue and yellow worlds. As we shall see, this sequence of colors provides a code synonymous with the cardinal directions of east, south, west and north; both series signify upward movement. Note, this is the reverse cycle from the one set by Spider Woman; therefore, we shall interpret Spider Woman's circuit as imputing directional movement from up to down symbolized by the rising and setting of the sun. The holy people mount to the surface of the present (fifth) world coming through the opening from the nadir, shipap. The ancient ones came up and out. The dead go in and down: they return to the Emer- gence Place and the worlds below. In turn, some ancestral spirits become the Katcina who bring the rains. The Katcina dwell at Wein- imatse located west or northwest of Zuni Pueblo (ibid: 277; Table 2). Katcina join the Kopishtaya and Shiwana to form the core supernatural powers in Laguna ideology; the former are anthropomorphic beings, best known as the masked deities who arrive in dawn's light for the winter season. Only properly initiated men impersonate the Katcina. They don masks and elaborate costumes for performances of the dances which turn the ritual calendar. Dead souls return to shipap, the Laguna home of Spider Woman and Our Mother to await rebirth. Above, below and all around (i.e. the totality of the cardinal directions) are the six sacred mountains fashioned by Spider Woman. On their peaks reside the shiwana or storm clouds. These thunder clouds are said to be the children of Sun Man, who awakens them each day (Boas 1928:76-7): "Father of the clouds you are beautiful at sunrise" (Silko 1977:190). When the clouds are captured or imprisoned in mythology, the rains cease (Boas 1928:76). Storm clouds are the physical form of the breath body of the ancestors who in turn become the Katcina bringers of rain. At death, the deceased's face is painted with designs distinctive of clan5 membership so that the person is recognized by Our Mother when the soul returns to dwell with her at shipap (ibid: 295). "The facial paintings resemble those of Katcina impersonators, and some of the songs sung over the corpse imply an association with the storm clouds" (Eggan 1950:266). So the dead ancestors (as Katcina) bring rain, well-being and the means for a livelihood to their living descendents. A shiwana medicine society has special responsibilities in rituals for rainmaking. Among the clouds, the most prominent are winter (north) and summer (south). Within the Laguna sacred world, winter, spring, summer and fall occur re- spectively in the north, west, south and east (Table 2). Logically, the sun's diurnal passage through the sky as ordained by Spider Woman becomes the determining model for the sequence of the seasons. The lower worlds are joined to the zenith along a vertical axis that intersects with the earth's surface at theoretical center, shipap</page><page sequence="4">232 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1988 TABLE 1 THE LAGUNA SYMBOLIC UNIVERSE: VERTICAL ASPECTS OF SPACE AND TIME ZENITH-Sky Home of Sun Southeast A = Koatyuma Zenith Zenith Mectctyuma (Sh) **Summer Solstice Eagle "far south" or Brown "southeast corner" Cedar O= Earth's Surface/Emergence Place or Shipap NADIR-Earth Home of Spider Woman and Our Mother Northeast A = ctciaitcana Nadir Nadir *Morityami (Sh) **Winter Solstice Shrew "far north" or Green "northeast corner" Oak Lower Worlds Ancestors EII yellow (color of North) Spider Woman's Sunwise Emergence Cycle III blue (color of West) Cycle of Movement of Movement I-I red (color of South) I--I white (color of East) A = sacred mountain *(sh)= Shiwana or storm clouds Italicized words are also names of Laguna clans (Parsons 1923:211) After Dozier 1970: 204-6 Boas 1928: 276, 283-4 **Parsons 1920:112 (Table 1). Vertical phenomena of "up" (zenith) and "down" (nadir) are given horizontal placement, and related to periods of seasonal time. Qualities connected to the zenith are geographically set in the Southeast, the so-called "far south corner," the temporal space for the summer solstice (Parsons 1920:112). The nadir at the opposite pole is situated in the Northeast, where the winter solstice occurs in the "far north corner" (ibid: 112). The most prominent occupants of the northeast sector are the Kurena shamans, who "came up" with Spider Woman and Our Mother (Boas 1928:222), and founded a medicine society which leads all others (ibid: 292); they oversee the ceremonial season when the Katcina</page><page sequence="5">LAGUNA SYMBOLIC GEOGRAPHY AND SILKO'S CEREMONY 233 dances occur between harvest and the winter solstice. During this interval, their songs celebrating "Sunrise" are chanted on a daily basis (ibid: 293), and their masks are kept in a Sun Clan house (Parsons 1923:256). Essentially, they are responsible for the myriad ritual prac- tices designed to protect and "turn the sun back" from his darkest and most dangerous moments, ensuring that the span of daylight will gradually increase. There is a dual ceremonial organization (ibid: 253) with the Kurena in control of the "west" group of clan dancers comprising Bear, Parrot, Coyote, Roadrunner and Oak (ibid: 229). The Kurena are paralleled by a complimentary "summer" society, the Koshare, who live at the Sun's home in the east (Table 2), and led the "east" group of clans, i.e., Sun, Corn, Turkey, Water, and Turquoise (ibid: 229).6 The Koshare hold jurisdiction over the remaining portion of the seasonal cycle, and their masks are maintained by the Water Clan because "water is between earth and sky" (ibid: 256). Shipap is located by the Laguna on Mount Taylor. Sometimes Mount Taylor is designated the sacred mountain of the west (Table 2) but more frequently it is the sacred peak of the north. This confusion is interesting because at Acoma, a sister Keresan Pueblo about 15 miles southwest of Laguna, Mount Taylor is the sacred northern mountain called Kawaishtyima (White 1930:66). The Laguna have the identical name for the mountain of the north (Table 2). Myths recount Spider Woman's feat of making, naming and positioning the sacred mountains in each cardinal direction, the zenith, and the nadir (Tables 1 and 2). Informants told Boas that Mount Taylor was positioned first (1928:283), so it is preeminent among the sacred peaks, the ordinal member of the series. This is "the mountain" which figures in Betonie's prophecy for Tayo: "Remember the stars" he said. "I've seen them and I've seen the spotted cattle; I've seen a mountain and I've seen a woman" (Silko 1977:160). Core horizontal and vertical structures frame a central paradigm integrating aspects of time and space within the Laguna symbolic universe. Sacred elements are assigned to each of the cardinal directions (Table 2). Included are Spider Woman's mountain, along with a rain- maker (shiwana), color, corn, animal, season, bird(s), tree and animals controlling hunting practices. The social dimension of this paradigm is immediately visible; half the corpus of extant clan names appear among these regional entities. These cardinally based clusters of symbols are textually linked to the masculine and feminine cast of actors in Silko's Ceremony (1977), where they outline an underlying logical structure critical for un- derstanding Tayo's metaphysical search.</page><page sequence="6">234 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1988 TABLE 2 THE LAGUNA SYMBOLIC UNIVERSE: HORIZONTAL ASPECTS OF SPACE AND TIME North = Kaweshima *Cakak (Sh) Mountain Lion (hunt) Yellow/yellow corn Birds-snow bird, robin, turkey Weapons-hail, ice, snow Spruce Winrer Northwest A Northeast Reed Leaf Town (NW)- North Winter Solstice (NE) house of Kaupata (The (left) Home of Kurena Shamans (NE) Gambler), and Pacayanyi; Far North Corner also Weinimatse, home of Katcina West A A East A= tspina West East A = K'tcuna *Cuisiyai (Sh) (back (facing) *Cuityirai (Sh) Bear towards) j wolf; coyote (hunt) Shohona (hunt) white Blue A many colored/white corn Blue corn South House of Sun/Kopishtaya/ Pine (right) Sun Man Spring Sunman/Sunrise Koshare Shamans Aspen Fall South Southeast A= Tautyuma Summer Solstice *Mayotcina (Sh) Far South Corner Badger Wildcat (hunt) *(Sh) = Shiwana or Red Cloud Eagle, Eagles storm clouds Red Corn Fish hawk, swallow A =sacred mountain Birds Bat, Swift Weapons-Thunder, Lightning Oak Flint and Fire Shamans Summer Italicized words are also names of Laguna clans (Parsons 1923:211) After Dozier 1970: 204-6 Boas 1928: 276, 283-4</page><page sequence="7">LAGUNA SYMBOLIC GEOGRAPHY AND SILKO'S CEREMONY 235 However, before systematically addressing this matter, we must first explore the mechanism which allows one to join a person with a point on the Laguna compass. Silko (in Fisher 1980:20-2 1) has told us how much she is influenced by "place" and "people" and why "relationships" with both are so deeply engraved on her perceptions that they serve as the centerpiece of her writing: "Things about relationships. That's all there really is ... That's all I'm interested in. You have to come to terms, to some kind of equilibrium with those people around you, those people who care for you, your environment" (Silko in Katz 1980:22). Laguna conceptions of "place" start with a name, Spider Woman's stamp of reality. They are enlivened by stories so that the landscape and forces of nature become animated with a presence of their own. "Place" stories are often about a spiritual being who represents an aspect of nature, and may appear either in the human shape of an animal (like Spider Woman) or in the form of a person such as Our Mother. "Place" stories are told and retold, forming a social legacy between generations of the clan, becoming a part of "blood memory" or the "consciousness" shared by the clan. Depending on the story, features of the natural order may function as an organizational model for the social order generating, for instance, names for clans or depicting spiders and spider behavior as a master image for corporate matriliny, and the genesis of the Laguna world view. "Place" may connote space as well as time as in the association of the northeast to the nadir and winter solstice. "Place" may refer to an intersection between human and environmental affairs acknowledging the common bond between these levels of existence as in Tayo's curse which reveals the link between his own bodily health and the condition of the land. With reference to Mount Taylor, Betonie states that "people belong to the mountain" (Silko, 1977:134) so that "people" and "place" are in this instance coterminous. Strands forming the interconnective tissue of relationships pull on the logical arrangement of the universe, and on Laguna symbolic geography. The mention of a color or a season, for example, is a trigger stimulating the Laguna mind to add a field of symbolic referents providing the broader mental context called "place." Gender and Phenomenology of the Cardinal Directions in Ceremony Day-to-day social affairs at Laguna establish rules for the acqui- sition of identity, norms governing Tayo's search in the novel. Social identity passes through women. Clans and extended families are ma- trilineal; in other words, descent is traced through women, so a child belongs to the clan of the mother (Swan 1988a). However, children</page><page sequence="8">236 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1988 belong to the ceremonial chamber, the Kiva, and dance group of their father (Parsons 1923:253). Religious identity and access to ideology formally pass through men. The development of identity, therefore, necessitates an integration between these bilateral threads of gender- specific behavior and knowledge. Each mentor is affiliated with a "place," one cardinal direction, and condenses the power posited in its representative group of symbols. Tayo's interactions and exchanges with these characters serve to ground him in this set of phenomenological attributes defined by Laguna symbolic geography. He must synthesize each set in turn in order to internalize and absorb the universal picture predicated by Spider Woman's sunwise circuit (Swan 1988b). But there are two sides to this coin of power. In keeping with the formula set in secular life, Tayo must engage and balance the duality of forces guiding his identity formation-male and female. Sex-linked channels for transmitting religious and social identity are the source of Tayo's education in his rise to power. Male Characters in Ceremony and the Cardinal Directions Articles of blue clothing combined with the pungent clean odor of sacred blue sage are signs announcing the presence of powerful men with whom Tayo interacts, and factors which suggest that males generally tend to be tied to the complex of symbols located in the beneficent West (Table 2). There Mount Taylor is the sacred mountain, and Cuis'yai is the shiwana rainmaker notable for the rains of spring, the relevant season within the novel. Blue is the sacred color and blue corn the staff of life. Bear and pine represent the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Additionally, individual masculine characters convey the symbolism of a specific cardinal direction (Table 3). Silko's narrative data portrays the proximity of each character to his unique symbolic milieu. Betonie is an "unpopular and unorthodox" Navajo healer who ministers to Tayo when Ku'oosh's remedies prove inadequate, perhaps because Tayo has moved beyond the efficacious reach of traditional Laguna values. Thus he requires treatment by an outsider. Betonie represents symbolism for the west (Table 3), and it should be noted that the Navajo Reservation lies west and to the north of Laguna. The shaman's "elbows made brown points through the sleeves of the blue cotton work shirt" (ibid: 124) and Tayo smells the contents of the Navajo hogan,7 "a great variety of herbs and root odors were almost hidden by the smell of mountain sage" (ibid: 125); moreover, "light from the door worked paths through the thick bluish green glass of</page><page sequence="9">LAGUNA SYMBOLIC GEOGRAPHY AND SILKO'S CEREMONY 237 TABLE 3 SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF MALE PERSONAE IN CEREMONY North The Hunter (Mountain Lion) Northeast Ku'oosh, cheani of Kurena Shamans West East Betonie The Japanese (Bear) Sun Man/Sunrise Laguna Tayo as "white smoke" Middle (Coyote) Josiah Robert Rocky Ku'oosh Sunwise cycle established South by Spider Woman Descheeny (Badger) the coke bottles" (ibid: 126). Under Betonie's direction, Tayo undergoes the first two nights of his four-night ceremonial. These are held west of Laguna, respectively on a hill above Gallup and in the "pine of the Chuska mountains" (ibid: 145). During the performance on the second night, the medicine man's apprentice Shush, the boy like the one who visited the bears (ibid: 135-7), enacts the role of the bear apprentice prescribed in the mythic account (ibid: 148; Bell 1979:33-4). Bears are the sacred animal of the west (Table 2; ibid: 49); they are able to "restore the mind" (ibid: 147). Tayo holds a basket containing pray- ersticks. These are pressed to his heart by the Bear boy who then guides Tayo's footsteps into the painted bear paw prints towards hoops which catch the coyote skin of witchery (ibid: 150-1). The Hunter is firmly entrenched in the symbol cluster for cardinal North where the color is yellow like the first world below this one; corn is yellow and the rainmaker is Cakak, the bearer of snow. The sacred birds are snowbird, turkey8 and robin;9 the birds are believed to function as Cakak's shield. North is the spatial place for the winter season who possesses weapons of hail, ice and snow. While descending Mount Taylor in the midst of a blizzard, Tayo encounters the Hunter (Ts'eh's companion). The Hunter is the human manifestation of Moun-</page><page sequence="10">238 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1988 tain Lion, the Katcina spirit who provides hunting techniques, and controls the capture of game in the north (Swan 1988a); he wears a cap "made from tawny thick fur... it looked like mountain lion skin" (Silko 1977:216). Mountain Lion is the sacred animal of the north. The Hunter with his animal counterpart, the yellow mountain lion, serve as Tayo's spiritual mentors. Tayo learns the traditional hunting songs (ibid: 215-6), gets advice about weapons, views the old war shield left by the Hunter decorated with Betonie's star constellation (ibid: 224), and is initiated as a hunter by the penetrating yellow light from the cougar's eyes (ibid: 204-5). Tayo is affiliated with attributes of the South through Descheeny, Betonie's grandfather (Table 3). For this cardinal direction, the group of salient symbols includes badger, oak, red, eagle, summer and the sacred Southern Mountain. Descheeny puts on his "old badger fur hat"'" (ibid: 155), and tells his other wives he'll marry the youthful Mexican captive (ibid: 155) brought by the hunters from the South Peak (ibid: 152) during the heat of the summer months (ibid: 156): Old age made him fearless. He flexed the old chants and the beliefs like a mountain-oak bow. He had been watching the sky before she came, the planets and constellations shifting the patterns of the old stories. He saw the transition and he was ready.., .he heard her moving in the hogan," the soft sounds of basket lids lifted and buckskin bundles un- rolling, the rustle of seeds and dry leaves, the clink of eagle claws and wolves' teeth ... He gazed into his smoke quartz crystal and she stared into the fire2 and they plotted the course of the ceremony: ... (ibid: 157-8). Dignified by his badger hat, Descheeny typifies a male healer- and badger is the sacred animal of the south. In Laguna tales, Badger Old Man is a mythic shaman who carries medicine in a bag on his back. He applies these to the dead body of Yellow Woman (Ts'eh of the novel) so her bones are set straight. He blows sunwise in Spider Woman's circuit reviving the heroine from death (Boas 1928:58-9) as he does with Coyote (ibid: 163). Thought Woman has comparable powers (Gunn 1917:151-2) because spiders are said to blow. In poetic form, Silko describes these healing proclivities in "Skeleton Fixer" (1981:242-5). The narrative in Ceremony portrays Tayo as an analog of Sun Man (Silko 1977:178-84). This personage dwells in the east (Table 2) with the benevolent Katcina-like beings termed Kopishtaya; he is associated with the color "white," and his movement under the command of Spider Woman establishes the sunwise cycle (Swan 1988a). Tayo, like Sun Man, must free the rains. After receiving instruction from Spider</page><page sequence="11">LAGUNA SYMBOLIC GEOGRAPHY AND SILKO'S CEREMONY 239 Woman, Sun Man defeats the witch, Kaup'a'ta the Gambler, who stole the rain; Sun cuts out the Gambler's eyes, and these become the constellation of Pleiades and Orion, the horizon stars of autumn. These are the stars from Betonie's prophecy that guide Tayo's journey. Also, they are painted on the Hunter's war shield: "his protection was there in the sky, in the position of the sun, in the pattern of the stars" (Silko 1977:259; my emphasis). Tayo is joined to the configuration of elements characteristic of the East by his linkage to Sun Man as well as his own body imagery in conjunction with the Japanese and trappings of witchcraft (Table 3). The eastern symbol set is comprised of the autumn season, white corn, sunrise, the white of the fourth world below this one where Thought Woman created her universal scheme, and coyote is the sacred animal. Tayo must become the color yellow since it conveys the Laguna notion of personhood as well as the identity of the clan name (Swan 1988a). Yet for most of the novel, Tayo personifies qualities of the east: in his guise as "white smoke" (ibid: 14); in the genetic "blood" of his unknown white father; in the way the Laguna assign white people to the east (Boas 1928:225), including the Japanese who inhabit the land of the rising sun; in Tayo's dawn prayers to the sun, the "Sunrise" poetry opens and closes the novel; in his quest for the spotted cattle on Mount Taylor during the fall season; in his victory over witchcraft that removes the coyote skin from his body; and in his penultimate climax on the night of the autumnal equinox. Ku'oosh is placed both in the center of the diagram (Table 3) as well as in the northeast. He is in the middle at Laguna with Josiah, Robert and Rocky because he lives and works there in the profane world. But as a medicine man, he is also in the outer circle of the sacred domain located in the northeast. In spatial terms, the northeast is the nadir as well as the mythic home of the Kurena shamans (Boas 1928:222, 293), and temporally, it is the site of the winter solstice (Parsons 1920:112). Ku'oosh appears to be the leader, cheani, of the Kurena who head the Scalp Dance group of the west and are charged with the safekeeping of autumn so that summer will inevitably come. Ku'oosh plays several mediating roles for Tayo from his northeast "place" between the "white" east and the "yellow" north. As a doctor, Ku'oosh provides a pivot between health and illness, life and death, sanity and insanity. After Tayo's return from the Pacific theater, Ku'oosh has the first and last medicinal bout with Tayo's disease inflicted in the white man's wars by the manipulators of witchcraft. Ku'oosh conducts the Scalp Ceremony for Tayo and the other Laguna veterans</page><page sequence="12">240 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1988 (Swan 1988a), only to recognize its limitations in the face of white (Anglo) influence. He refers Tayo to Betonie, the "outside" Navajo medicine man. Betonie is known for curing diseases induced by the white introduction of Christianity and alcohol, an expertise shared with his grandfather, Descheeny (Silko 1977:158). Eventually, Ku'oosh welcomes Tayo back to Laguna society when Tayo enters the Kiva to tell his tale to the elders of the medicine society (Kurena) headed by Ku'oosh (ibid: 269). Since religious identity passes through men, this suggests that Ku'oosh is a surrogate Laguna "ceremonial father" sub- stituting for the biological "white father" Tayo never knew-thus, Tayo joins the kiva of his "father" (see Eggan 1950:279-80). Consequently, Tayo's transmutation from one color (white) to an- other (yellow) in the mythic sphere may be regarded as a logical transformation of the biological factors enmeshed in his racial iden- tity-he is a half-breed vacillating between the conflicting demands of his paternal "white" blood versus his maternal "yellow" blood (Swan 1988a). Men of power wear blue clothing or turquoise jewelry, and smell of mountain sage. They cure, hunt, engage in war and conduct activities to order and strengthen life. They attend spiritual matters, and combat evil using as their agents the sacred animals of the cardinal directions. Their medicine story is strong. Each character harnesses the individual potency from the respective quadrants of the universe. Each is a spiritual mentor, and under their combined tutelage Tayo matures into the diverse labors of men. Collectively, they bestow the esoteric ceremonial knowledge undergirding the foundations of Tayo's religious identity, and represent a holistic, cosmic portrait of masculinity. Female Characters in Ceremony and the Cardinal Directions As was the case for men, blue clothing along with other items carrying this valence of the west signify women with a state of power. In addition these women have a strong base in cardinal south evident in a variety of shared Mexican features. Links between women stitch the social fabric of a matrilineal society together. Through the female thread of characters, Tayo achieves his social identity. The symbolic framework surrounding the Mexican captive, Be- tonie's grandmother, known to Tayo as a word-being, gives substance to the medicine man's reflections. Each of these three characters has hazel-green eyes, a tell-tale mark setting them apart from the others, and creating a bond between them because mixed ancestry makes itself known in the color of their eyes. Her "hazel green eyes had a peculiar night shine of wolf or bobcat" (ibid: 154). She is brought to</page><page sequence="13">LAGUNA SYMBOLIC GEOGRAPHY AND SILKO'S CEREMONY 241 Descheeny's house at the "white clay spring" (ibid: 155) during the heat of summer by Navajo hunters from the South Peak (ibid: 152). The southern placement described above for Descheeny is matched by the Mexican origins of his youthful wife. She had lived in the fort at San Mateo,13 built along the northwest base of Mount Taylor, with the soldiers her captors were so anxious to avoid; the text specifies this sacred mountain is blue in color (ibid: 105, 134). It is night and the girl is hidden in a pinyon tree; her blue lace shawl falls "lightly like a bird" (ibid: 154) which gives her away. She is linked to eagle claws and red fire (ibid: 157-8). She joins Descheeny in sexual and ceremonial partnership; the former eventually begets Betonie, and the latter becomes the ceremony which Betonie performs for Tayo. She rears her grandson, Betonie, with an eclectic spiritual education garnered from the wisdom of differing cultures to combat an expanding coven of witches (ibid: 127-8) operating within and between these social traditions. Descheeny's bride displays referents joining her to symbolism associated with both Ts'eh and Night Swan. She is like Ts'eh in the following respects: both possess blue shawls (ibid: 154, 233); they are linked to pools of water (ibid: 155, 232); and have long hair that blows about their faces (ibid: 154; 241); their gaze causes one to "feel chill" and experience "fear" (ibid: 154-5, 223); both are medicine women who stare into red fires and hear voices in foreign tongues at night (ibid: 157, 243); with Descheeny, the girl initiates Tayo's ceremony (ibid: 158), Ts'eh gives Tayo love and feminine guidance so that he may endure to finish it (ibid: 243-4). The Mexican captive, Ts'eh and Night Swan reside on Mount Taylor. Night Swan is a matured, "elder" image of the "young" Mexican captive. Night Swan is to Tayo as the Mexican captive is to Betonie- a grandmother figure from the spiritual plane. The similarity between the two women prompts Betonie to understand Tayo's relationship to the ceremony planned by his grandparents. Betonie becomes excited when Tayo tells him about how Night Swan insisted on the purchase of the spotted cattle and also the gist of her words about their hazel green eyes (ibid: 104). Night Swan is Mexican, a flamenco dancer with "eyes like a cat" (ibid: 91) who comes from the southeast (Socorro) to live in Cubero on the south side of Mount Taylor. Her direction of origination is the "place" of the summer solstice in the far south corner (Table 2). She came and remained because of the mountain (ibid: 91). Night Swan surrounds herself with imagery of blue (ibid: 91, 92, 101), indicative of her state of power as well as her residence on the sacred western mountain. The rain starts when Tayo arrives, and he</page><page sequence="14">242 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1988 smells her presence-perfume scented like the "ivory locust blossoms of spring" (ibid: 102), the season affiliated with the west. Night Swan greets her lovers clothed in blue (ibid: 87); when Tayo arrives she wears slippers and a kimono of blue satin and motions him "to a blue armchair with dark wooden feet carved like eagle claws" (ibid: 102). Summer is the season of the south, its weapons are thunder and lightning (Table 2). These predominate as the summer storm that brought Tayo to Night Swan mounts to a crescendo: he is sexually initiated. "She did not look old or young to him then; she was like the rain and the wind; age had no relation to her" (ibid: 103; my emphasis). Like Ts'eh, she is timeless, immortal. As Tayo leaves, Night Swan says, "You don't have to understand what is happening. But remember this day. You will recognize it later. You are part of it now.. ." (ibid: 105). She refers to the skein of factors linking Tayo to Ceremony, and the love later borne to him by Ts'eh. Tayo believes that Josiah "died because there was no one to help him search for the cattle after they were stolen" (ibid: 130). Following Josiah's funeral, Night Swan vanishes; "nobody knew where she went, only that she walked to the highway with a suitcase" (ibid: 109). She disappears with baggage in hand, just as Ts'eh departs with her be- longings wrapped in her blue shawl and balanced on her head "the way Tayo had seen the old woman at Laguna do" (ibid: 245). Night Swan comes from the direction of the summer solstice (southeast) and Ts'eh leaves in the direction of the winter solstice (northeast). Ts'eh, the "woman" of Betonie's vision, has "light brown skin" and "ocher eyes" (ibid: 185) comparable to her mystical prototype, Yellow Woman, who Silko describes as having "light hair and eyes" (1981:55). Moreover, Ts'eh is a Katcina; her eyes and cheek bones slant upward suggesting the "face of an antelope dancer's mask" (Silko 1977:185). At Laguna, Yellow Woman is the generic name for all female Katcinas (Boas, 1928:280); she is the genetrix of the Antelope Clan which originated from the Keresan speaking pueblo of Acoma some 15 miles southwest of Laguna where Antelope remains as the ruling clan (Parsons 1917:172-3; Stirling 142:99-108).'4 People of this clan are thought to be among the clans founding Laguna (Boas 1928:38), and in turn, Laguna mythology locates antelope in the cardinal direction of the south (ibid: 30, 295). Ts'eh's antelope aspects are linked to the spotted cattle which Tayo, Rocky and Josiah see as being "desert antelope" (Silko 1977:77). Josiah purchases the cattle at Night Swan's behest and we have noted that the cattle function as Tayo's bridewealth for Ts'eh (Swan 1988a). The spotted cattle move south, bound for Mexico, driven by an instinct to return to their Sonoran homeland. "They took off, heading south</page><page sequence="15">LAGUNA SYMBOLIC GEOGRAPHY AND SILKO'S CEREMONY 243 in a steady travelling gait. Tayo watched them disappear over the horizon, their ivory hides shining speckled brown like a butterfly's wing" (ibid: 81). Furthermore, the spotted cattle carried a Mexican brand in the shape of a butterfly (ibid: 84, 222). Butterflies are also a symbol connected to Yellow Woman in legends,'" an association reinforcing Ts'eh's personification of the Mexican cattle and amplifying her "desert antelope" features. Ts'eh, Night Swan and Betonie's grandmother are Mexican, women of the south. Ts'eh's antelope nature connects her to Descheeny, the dominant male figure of the south married to the Mexican captive. Descheeny carries a "cane"' 6 and wears his "old badger fur" hat (ibid: 155). At Laguna, the potency of the badger must be conjoined with that of antelope; this pairing so crucial to mythology serves to legitimate and guarantee the effectiveness of Tayo's ritual. Consequently, Badger (Descheeny) and Antelope (Ts'eh) convey a rich complex of meanings. We have just reviewed antelope's hearth at Acoma. The Badger Clan was brought to Laguna from Zuni (Parsons 1920:103) as was the Katcina Cult itself (ibid: 88). Badger and Antelope not only condense the hybrid nature of Laguna's cultural heritage (Swan 1988a), but also constitute the Laguna clans which help the war captains "look after the Katcina. The Shamanistic groups prepare the masks in the houses of the antelope and badger clans" (Boas 1928:291) and after use the masks are hidden from the eyes of the uninitiated (ibid: 282). Tayo glimpses these stored in the southwest corner of the kiva (Silko 1977:269). This auspicious responsibility confers meanings of great signifi- cance to this pair of characters. Each is a Katcina.'7 Together, they are caretakers and guardians of the Katcina. In sum, Ts'eh possesses several implicit bonds to Mexico: in her relationship to the Mexican cattle ("desert antelope"), through the antelope and butterfly symbolism drawn from Laguna stories about Yellow Woman, in parallels between Ts'eh and the Mexican captive within the overlapping imagery stressing their association to each other and with Tayo as medicine women. Ts'eh's Katcina, antelope and cane features connect her to Descheeny who represents the badger healer of myth married to the youthful Mexican captive. In turn, the young spouse is reminiscent of Night Swan, the Mexican dancer, whose directional ties to the southeast and the summer solstice contrast with Ts'eh in her guise as Yellow Woman linked to the northeast and the winter solstice. Yet Ts'eh has an overt Spanish quality which relates to her name: "You never told me your name," he [Tayo] said. "I'm a Montafio,"18 she said (Silko 1977:233). In the local vernacular, Montafio is a colloquial expression for the summer range for grazing livestock along the higher plateaus of</page><page sequence="16">244 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1988 Mount Taylor (ibid: 22). Ts'eh resides in this "place" of summer pasturage living side-by-side with the spotted cattle (herself) she tends until Tayo arrives during the blizzard she causes. Montafio is also "the mountain" itself, in its Spanish definition. So Ts'eh emphasizes her intrinsic relationship to Mount Taylor'9; she is a "mountain" woman of great power home-based in a Montafio valley located on the "south- east" quadrant (ibid: 214) of the Laguna sacred peak. This evidence concerning Ts'eh's directional ground reiterates the comparable placement of Night Swan's "southeast" origins (from Socorro, New Mexico), as well as the site of her rooms above the cantina in Cubero on the south side of Mount Taylor. She says, "You may call me Ts'eh. That's my nickname because my Indian name is so long.. ." (ibid: 233). Whatever her long Indian name may be, Ts'eh is the initial homophone in two crucial Laguna words: Ts'its'tsi'nako, Spider Woman, and Tse-pi'na, Mount Taylor: they could hear a low rumble of thunder in the distance from the direction of Tse-pi'na, Mount Taylor. The wind came up from the west smelling like wet clay. Then he could see the rain. It was spinning out of the thunderclouds like gray spider webs and tangling against the foothills of the mountain (ibid: 100). The "woman veiled in [spider] rain clouds" is Ts'eh Montafio, the "Western Woman Mountain" as she is called by Allen (1979:10), dressed respectively in her Laguna and Mexican names, both of which honor the mountain first fabricated by Spider Woman. The blue color (Table 4) of this sacred Western Mountain (Silko 1977:105, 134, 154) is replicated in the blue of rain, sky, water and turquoise; blue often associated with Spider Woman, Ts'eh and Night Swan through flowers and their fragrance (ibid: 181, 191, 241, 102- 3). During the lover's tryst on Mount Taylor, Tayo accompanies Ts'eh to learn about flowers and help her gather plants and roots. She spreads her blue shawl on the ground and closely examines the plants. "She carefully dug the sand away from the roots. This one contains the color of the sky after a summer rainstorm. I'll take it from here and plant it in another place, a canyon where it hasn't rained for a while" (ibid: 235). Obviously, Ts'eh is also a "water"20 woman materialized in the clouds, fog and snow swirling like a veil around Mount Taylor, a spectre granting her holy name (ibid: 91, 192-93). Water originates from the home of the Katcina, Spider Woman and Ts'eh (ibid: 49). Willows signify water, and twigs are often used in the preparation of prayersticks (ibid: 72, 240). Each time Tayo catches sight of Ts'eh, she carries a willow cane. "He noticed she was holding a small willow</page><page sequence="17">LAGUNA SYMBOLIC GEOGRAPHY AND SILKO'S CEREMONY 245 TABLE 4 SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF FEMALE PERSONAE IN CEREMONY North Spider Woman Our Mother Ts'eh (as Yellow Woman) Northeast Winter Direction of Yellow Ts'eh's Departure (Winter Solstice) West Laguna East Ts'eh Montafio Middle White women whores in (Tse-pi'na) Grandma Japanese War Night Swan Auntie Spring Sis (Tayo's mother) Spider Woman's Blue Sunwise circuit South Southeast Night Swan (Eagle/Wildcat) Direction of Mexican captive (Eagle/Wildcat) Night Swan's origin Ts'eh (Spotted Cattle/Antelope (Summer solstice) Butterflies/Eagle) Summer Red staff, slightly curved at one end" (ibid: 185, also 231). Boas tells us such crooked canes "are used by women shamans to draw in the clouds from the four directions" (1928:287). Ts'eh wears high moccasins below her skirt; "the silver buttons up the side of each moccasin had rainbirds21 carved on them" (Silko 1977:185). When Ts'eh folds up her stormcloud blanket, covered with designs of the shiwana and lightning (ibid: 186), the first big snow storm of the season on Mount Taylor gradually stops. "The tree," he [the Hunter] said to her [Ts'eh], "you better fold up the blanket before the snow breaks the branches" (ibid: 128). Ts'eh's storm is the blizzard which engulfs Tayo after his hunting initiation by Mountain Lion. Snow covers both his prints and those of the cougar, allowing them to escape undetected; snow fills his tracks like pollen, and reminds him of the curtains in Night Swan's room (ibid: 102-3): "The snow packed under his feet with a hollow sound. The big snowflakes still crowded behind him like the gauzy curtains in the woman's house" (ibid: 215). It would seem then, that Ts'eh is the northern winter version of the summer Night Swan. Silko's permutation on the parable of Yellow</page><page sequence="18">246 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1988 Woman, who is married to Winter and Summer (Boas 1928: 33-5), shows Tayo as a Yellow Man joined to Winter and Summer aspects of the same woman. Women of power favor blue silk clothing and shawls. They are medicine women, and have eyes either hazel-green (Night Swan and the Mexican captive) or ocher (Ts'eh and Spider Woman) in hue. Like Spider Woman, all are mountain women settled in or on Mount Taylor, the sacred cardinal peak foremost in rank to the Laguna, dictated by Spider Woman's ordering of the creative process (Boas 1928:283). In addition, they harness the elemental powers of the universe: fire, water, wind, rain, snow, light and the stars. Through women, Tayo is connected to the land, and he earns his social identity as a yellow person, beloved by family and welcomed in the Kiva. "We came out of this land and we are hers" (Silko 1977:267; my emphasis). All of the female characters are associated with the supernatural being called Our Mother who is positioned at Spider Woman's shipap. She symbolizes love, life and their everlasting continuity: In myth, Naija iyatiku lived within the earth at Shipap ... together with her sisters [Spider Woman, Nau'its'iti and I'tets'ity'i]... she said that she would never come out of the earth. "If I go out into the world and people see me they will not prosper. If they do not see me, they can pray to me and I can help them"... For this reason there is no face on the iyatiku (corn ear fetish), so they will not see her. And the altar is on the ground so under it iyatiku will be [able] to hear (Parsons 1920:96). One important pattern at Acoma, which is characteristic of Keresan villages generally, and which contrasts with the Hopi and Zuni to a considerable extent, is the emphasis on the concept of 'mother.' In the origin myth we have seen that the central figure is Iyatiku, who is the 'mother' of the people whom she created and whom she receives in death. The corn-ear fetishes represent her and have her power (Eggan 1950:239). But she chooses to remain within the earth, invisible to those she protects and nourishes. In a very real sense, then, Spider Woman may be regarded as the visible counterpart of the invisible Mother as are the other women in the sacred precincts of Ceremony (Swan 1988a). "Our Mothers, Uresete and Naotsete are aspects of Grandmother Spider, are She at lower voltage, so to speak. The same may be said of Ts'eh, who is Tse-pi'na, the Western Woman Mountain" (Allen 1979:10). At the novel's conclusion, witchery is "dead for now" unravelled from Tayo's mind and body, the vacated space in his belly filled with internal peace won through the victory of Yellow Woman's love. He knows "she had always loved him, she had never left him; she had</page><page sequence="19">LAGUNA SYMBOLIC GEOGRAPHY AND SILKO'S CEREMONY 247 always been there" (ibid: 267). Affirmation of Spider Woman's web of relationships encompasses the organization of dualities into the cosmic structure of Laguna symbolic geography. She is eternal, infinite in her capacity, and the invisible Mother transfigured into forms of the secular and spiritual women of Ceremony. In his manhood, Tayo has come to master the arts of taking (hunting, killing) and giving (planting, herding, nurturing) (Swan 1988a). He has become unified within him- self, an androgynous being integrating opposing characteristics as the ancient ways are molded by present experience, and "white" converts to "yellow." Tayo reclaims the "time immemorial stories" of his youth, comes to understand the ceremonial nature of male and female, and is absorbed into Her land. He arrives at the river below Laguna at sunrise (ibid: 267) like his mother pregnant with his seed (ibid: 73): but now he is conceived anew-whole, loved and home at last. He arrives at sunrise like the Katcina. He arrives at the autumnal equinox, the moment of celestial balance. He arrives as the culture hero, Tayo, "a yellow man" now recognized by the Kopishtaya and Our Mother. He arrives to tell his story about Her to the Kurena priests in the kiva. A holy man returns home. At least for the present, balance is restored. NOTES 1. Laguna Pueblo, named for a dried-up lake, is located in northwestern New Mexico. It was founded about 1700 A.D. (Swan 1988a). 2. Navajo ceremonials are named "chants" or "ways." Thus "way" in this context should be understood as the method or procedure used to address the ugly effects of witchery precipitated through the influence of ghosts (Haile 1950). 3. Cheani is the Laguna term for the leader of each medicine society. 4. In Laguna numerology, four is the most sacred number, with its power stemming from four cardinal directions. Four signifies wholeness or completeness; a tenet shared by other Puebloan and Athapascan peoples in the Southwest. 5. The clan and extended family comprise the major units of Laguna matrilineal social structure (Swan 1988a). Clans classify "people for social purposes" and they classify "the world of nature in its important aspects" (Eggan 1950:301). The Western Pueblos share a common set of clan names which Eggan says "must be viewed in terms of the relationship between man and nature. The aspects of the natural world which have social or ritual value for the Pueblos are similar, and the clan names reflect these aspects" (ibid: 301). Parsons lists the following clans at Laguna: Water, Parrot, Turkey, Sun, Bear, Lizard, Roadrunner, Badger, Eagle, Corn [with segmental groups of different colors], Oak, Antelope, Locust and Turquoise while Coyote, Deer, Snake, Pumpkin, and Wheat are now "extinct" (Parsons 1923:211, 232). Individuals may carry fetishes representing the appropriate clan "totem" or in certain instances pray to their totemic principal as well (ibid: 212-3), exemplifying how the social classification bonds humans to the natural order through symbolic representation which gives one a name, the social identity of the mother's clan. 6. "At Laguna there is some seasonal assignment of ceremonial activities, and a dual organization of clans for dances, a possible substitute for a former two Kiva system [referring to pre-historic settlements in Chaco Canyon] ... and they control ceremonial rivalry by regulating competition and dividing responsibility into channeled</page><page sequence="20">248 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1988 areas ...The Katcina cult is associated with the Kivas, but the medicine societies play a dominant role in village life" (Eggan 1950: 302-3; my inclusion in brackets). Parsons discusses the close similarity between the clan groupings at Laguna with the winter/ summer moiety system characteristic of Zuni, and some of the Tewa and Eastern Keresan pueblos (1923:229); moieties are social units dividing a society into two parts. Eggan extends the argument by stating that the Laguna dual pattern of ceremonial life provides the basic ancestral model for its more evolved eastern counterparts (1950:280). 7. Hogan is the name for the circular Navajo dwelling place. It is a microcosmic version of the structural elements composing the Navajo world view. It is sacred space. 8. Turkey originates on Mount Taylor (Boas 1928:180) and Turkey Woman is Spider Woman's sister (ibid: 100, 255). 9. Robin is the bird hunted by the folklore hero Tayo when he goes hunting with the boys of Spider Woman; then he gives the birds to her as a gift (ibid: 147). 10. Influential men such as warriors, hunters and healers wear hats often fashioned of fur (Boas 1928:153). The type of fur indicates a close bond between the human bearer and the animal donating its skin as a gift, as we saw with the Hunter who wears one made from mountain lion skin. 11. Their "winter hogan" on the mountain rimrock (Silko 1977:156) is the hogan Betonie uses for the second night of Tayo's ceremonial. Descheeny's other wives remain at the "summer hogan" where he was living when his young spouse arrived. The traditional Navajo settlement pattern was seasonal, and polygyny (multiple wives) was the customary form of marriage. 12. Smoke quartz crystals are utilized by the Flint Shamans who are closely connected to fire, the color red, and the Fire Shamans; both shamanistic societies have "places" in the south (Boas 1928:276, 291); see Table 2. 13. The Spanish term for Mount Taylor is San Mateo. 14. "The Antelope clan does occupy an important position at Laguna in myth and ritual, however, and Parsons notes that, when the Antelope clansmen took over as head of the three Katcina dance groups 'he went to Acoma to be installed by his clansmen, the Antelope Man, Town Chief.' She points out that it would have been an easy matter to adopt the Acoma pattern of town chieftaincy at this time, but the secular government was too firmly established" (Eggan 1950:289). 15. Sun Man uses butterflies both to lure and guide Yellow Woman (Boas 1928:86, 87) because she is anxious to copy their wings as a design for weaving clothing and basketry (ibid: 89, 95). Yellow Woman's dress is said to turn into butterflies (ibid: 180); Tayo helps Ts'eh pack her things and "when he went to get them for her, the blouses and skirts were like bright wings of butterflies settled on the branches" (Silko 1977:245). 16. Ts'eh also carries a "crooked cane" (Silko 1977:185, 231). 17. Eggan states that "the Katcina cult remained under the control of the Antelope and Badger clans" (1950:288); their role of leadership stems from several accounts where the "Katcina tried to run away from the people. The antelope tried to overtake them, but could not do it. The badgers succeeded in the Zuni mountains" (Boas 1928:282). Badger and antelope team together to free the Katcina (ibid: 235). During the process, antelope butts down the door making an opening for the Katcina, and badger is given mask and body paints, with the result that "These two lead in the dances and all disputes are referred to them" (Parsons 1917:192; 1923:220-1; Gunn 1917:139-40). 18. Montailo is the Spanish word for "mountain." 19. Mount Taylor is the "place people belong to" who Silko calls "our mother where the deceased go to be reborn" (Silko 1981:202). 20. Paula Gunn Allen, a Laguna critic of Ceremony, says "Love, the Mountain Spirit Ts'eh, the Wonderbeing,-water (Ts'e) woman (Nako)-is the creatrix of the waters of love that flow from a woman to bless the earth and the beloved with healing" (1979:8). Lincoln connects her name to "Tsi'ty icots'a or Salt Woman, the pan-pueblo spirit of pure water" (1983:246). 21. Rainbirds are eagles, sacred bird of the south.</page><page sequence="21">LAGUNA SYMBOLIC GEOGRAPHY AND SILKO'S CEREMONY 249 REFERENCES Allen, Paula Gunn 1979 "The Psychological Landscape of Ceremony."
