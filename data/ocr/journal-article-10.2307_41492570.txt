NADEL ABSTRACT. - The paper presents two kinds of evidence concerning the commonly held notion that the archaeological record of the Levantine Upper Palaeolithic/Early Epipalaeolithic period is the "poorest" in human skeletal remains. First, the details of the H2 grave at the well-dated site of Ohalo II (19,000 B.P.) point to a tradition of burying the dead in very shallow pits. This behaviour is probably a key factor in understanding the scarcity of preserved articulated skeletons. Second, a comparison of all prehistoric periods shows that when the relative numbers of sites (with skeletons) and skeletons are evaluated (by calculating them per time unit), the period in question is very similar to the preceding Middle Palaeolithic. RÉSUMÉ. - Cet article présente deux types d'information se rapportant à la notion bien établie que le Paléolithique supérieur et l'Epipaléolithique ancien du Levant sont les périodes de la Préhistoire les plus " pauvres " en restes humains. En premier lieu , la sépulture H2 du site bien daté ď Ohalo II (19.000 BP) implique que la coutume était alors d'enterrer les morts dans des fosses peu profondes. En second lieu, une comparaison de toutes les périodes préhistoriques montre que lorsque l'on évalue le nombre des sites (avec restes humains) et des squelettes (en calculant par unité de temps), la période en question est très semblable au Paléolithique moyen qui la précède. INTRODUCTION The Levant is one of the richest areas in the world with evidence for prehistoric burial customs. Hundreds of graves and skeletons from the Middle Palaeolithic - Chalcolithic sequence have been unearthed since the beginning of the century, reflec- ting a wide variety of traditions and ways of dispo- sing of the dead. Two groups of skeletons have been the focus of many studies and debates since the middle of this century. The first is the group of Mousterian (166,000 - 45,000 B.P.) skeletons found in the Car- mel (Kebara, Skhul and Tabun caves) and Galilee (Amud, Qafzeh caves) sites. As they are among the earliest examples of human burial, and as they have much to contribute to our understanding of the ori- gins of modern humans, they have been the focus of many researches. The second group of skeletons derives from the late Epipalaeolithic Natufian (12,500 - 10,300 B.P) graveyards at El-Wad (cave and terrace), Eynan, Hayonim (cave and terrace), Nahal Oren and other sites. This group is the first large group (hundreds of skeletons) to enable biological and palaeodemo- graphic studies of past human societies (1). It is also the most varied example of burial customs from the Pleistocene period in the Levant, and as such it provides the basis for interpretation of symbolic behaviour and its social context (2). The period between the Middle Palaeolithic and the Natufian is commonly viewed as "poorest" of all - when evidence for intentional inhumation is referred to (3). Thus, the Upper Palaeolithic and Early Epipalaeolithic (45,000 - 12,500 B.P.) finds have long been in the shade of the preceding and succeeding remains. The two time units have been combined in the following discussion according to the scheme of Garrod and Neuville which was recently adopted by Gilead (4), and due to the fact that the two periods show limited archaeological evidence for burials and that they are similar in several aspects pertinent to the ongoing discussion. It is the aim of this paper to focus on this "poor" period, and to re-evaluate this issue in the light of the recently excavated grave at Ohalo II. THE UPPER PALAEOLITHIC - EARLY EPIPALAEOLITHIC REMAINS The scarcity of human remains from the Upper Palaeolithic period (5) is manifest by the facts that 30 years ago there were no known graves from the period (excluding 'Egbert' from Ksar Akil), and comparative analyses were thus rendered im- (1) BELFER-COHEN et al., 1991 ; HERS HKO VITZ and GO- PHER, 1990.

In fact, until recently only six articu- lated skeletons were found from the entire Upper Paleolithic/Early Epipalaeolithic periods, and these were usually fragmented. The six articulated skeletons reported so far derive from five sites. The oldest and first to be discovered is the Ksar 'Akil 1 juvenile from the early Upper Palaeolithic layers (7). The second is a skeleton of a woman from the Upper Palaeolithic site of Nahal Ein Gev I. It was found in a tightly flexed position, the skull fragmented into many pieces. The skeleton was not discovered in a clear archaeological context although the majority of the lithic material was typical of the Levantine Aurig- nacian tradition (8). The third is a Kebaran female skeleton from Ein Gev I. The woman was apparently buried under a floor of a cabin (9). Two skeletons were found in the Kebaran layer of Kharaneh IV (phase B), under a living floor (10). The sixth is a fragmented skeleton from the Geometric Kebaran site of Neve David (11). Additional human skeletal remains have been recovered, preservation conditions being too poor to permit any interpretation of burial customs. Thus, isolated human frontal bones were recovered from Qafzeh Cave (12); isolated bones and teeth of im- mature individual(s) and adult(s) from Hayonim Cave (13); fragments of humeri, ulnae, and mandi- bles from Kebara Cave (14); teeth, fragments of bones and a mandible from El Wad Cave (15) ; bones of one individual from Neve David (16); bones of two individuals and a tooth from Ksar Akil (17); half a cranium and fragments of a male skeleton from Abri Bergy(18); fragments of a skull and bones from 'Antelias (19). These remains represent at least ten and probably more than 15 individuals, in addition to the skeletons mentioned above. OHALO II The most complete example of intentional in- humation from the U.P./E.Ep. period was found at Ohalo II in 1990. The site was a fisher-hunter camp FIG. 1. - Map showing location of site. on the shore of the Sea of Galilee 19,000 years ago (fig. 1). The excellent conditions of preservation at the submerged site, especially of organic remains, have enabled us to study the economy and daily life of the inhabitants in detail. Twenty six samples of charcoal from eight loci at the site were examined by three laboratories, averaging 19,300 B.P. (20). Over 300 sq. m. of the habitation area have been cleaned from recent sands and excavated (fig. 2). Three structures have been identified, all with clearly visible shapes and well preserved in- situ layers. Two successive floors of the largest structure (locus 1) have been excavated and ana- lysed (21). The other two structures, loci 2 and 3, have been tested. The structures were surrounded by a series of hearths, each set of hearth(s) being distinct in its sediment and contents of debris (loci 6,7,9,11). In addition, a stone installation (locus 4), a grave (locus 5), a small pit (locus 8), and a dumping zone (locus 10) have been identified and tested. (6) BINFORD S., 1968; HARROLD, 1980.

Dotted line marks area of surface collection (after NADEL et al in press). The H2 skeleton was found in a shallow pit (Locus 5), with the skull and the topmost bones visible above the Lisan Formation bedrock, and covered by recent sand. However, most of the skele- ton was embedded in the Lisan clay. A loose layer of stones partially covered the western part of the grave (PI. 1:1). The contours of the pit were not visible on the surface, but its bottom part was dis- tinguished : the fill of the pit was yellow while the sediment around it was grey (PI. 1 : 2). The individual was lying on its back in a semi- flexed position with the hands folded on the chest and the knees folded backwards (PI. I : 3, 5). One knee was found on the surface about 0.5 meter to the east of the skeleton with a fresh break, and was reconstructed in its original position. The forehead was slightly damaged due to its proximity to the surface. These two damages seem to be the result of a tractor working on the beach before it was recognized as an archaeological site. Its tracks on the ground, as well as the surface stones left un- touched in some parts of the site attest to the mi- nimal surface damage caused to the archaeological features. The head was slightly lifted by placing it on three small stones (PI. I : 4). These stones were the only stones found under the skeleton : the grave fill was a mixture of the Lisan Formation clays and sand. The fill of the grave contained flint and bone artefacts of the types common in the rest of the site. A large round hammerstone was found between the legs, near the pelvis. The body (a disabled male, 35-40 years old and 1.73 m tall) (22) was placed along a north-south axis : the head towards the north, the legs to the south and the face to the east. This orientation is parallel to the shoreline of the Lake, and to the general arrangement of the camp (23). The grave itself is located to the west of the structures and hearths (habitation area), and thus while facing east the head was also facing the camp. It should be noted that the entrances to loci 1 and 2 are also from the east. In addition, the only feature at the site constructed of stones (locus 4) was found about (22) NADEL and HERSHKOVITZ, 1991 ; HERSHKOVITZ et al. ; 1993, in press.

It was a round installation, 45 cm in diameter and constructed of one flat layer of unworked stones (Pl. II : 1). There were many charred remains found here, but there is no direct evidence to connect the paved circle with the grave. Several gazelle mandibles were recovered from the vicinity of the grave. An incised bone fragment was found behind the head (Pl. II : 2, 3). It was a short fragment, with a series of short incisions all around it (24). It is less than 3 cm long, broken in antiquity on both sides. The marks are composed of groups of short inci- sions, each group differing from the others in the depth of the engravings and the type of tool used to produce them. This is thought to be the earliest example of a worked artifact being deliberately placed in a grave in the Levant. The only earlier Levantine grave furnishings found were animal parts placed in Mous- terian burial pits : fallow dear antlers on the chest of a child (H.ll) at Qafzeh Cave (25) and a mandible of a wild boar in the grave pit of Skhul V (26). Other incised bone fragments were found in other parts of the Ohalo II site. They were less elaborate in comparison to the implement found in the grave. Other human remains from Ohalo II include a mandible of an adult and isolated bones of an adult and a child. These were found on the surface, and we had no way of determining whether they derive from a grave, and if so where its location was. DISCUSSION Various hypotheses have been suggested in at- tempts to explain the low numbers of U.P./E.Ep. (24) RABINOVITCH and NADEL, in press. (25) VANDERMEERSCH, 1970.

In order to present this commonplace notion in a quantitative manner (table 1), we have counted sites containing evidence of skeletons/burials, and presented them by seven periods, from the Middle Palaeolithic through the Chalcolithic (27). It should be noted that the numbers of skeletons (of individuals) are, for some sites, only estimations. First, several publications concerning the skeletal material are not clear as to the exact number of individuals represented by a total count of the re- mains. Second, some of the recently published papers offer different counts of skeletal material published in the past (28). In addition, several recent discoveries have not been fully published yet. This survey is limited to the southern Levant : Israel, Lebanon, southern Syria and Jordan. The material recovered from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites in southern Sinai, as well as the many 4th-3rd millennium B.C Nawamis burial structures in the same area have not been included here. Also, the dolmens in the Jordan Valley have been omitted, as most of them date to the Bronze Age. Thus, the last period (the Chalcolithic) is actually under-repre- sented here. It should be noted that even so it is the richest period in the Levantine sequence, as far as archaeological remains of burials are concerned. It will be readily appreciated that the earlier two periods are very similar to one another, and very different from the later periods. The number of sites per 1,000 years (an arbitrary unit chosen for comparison) is ca. 0.07 - 0.36 for the Middle and U.P./E.Ep. periods, and more than ten times higher for later periods. When the number of skele- tons per time unit is compared, the difference is even more apparent - the frequencies of skeletons in later periods are over 100 times higher than in the early ones. Thus, the U.P./E.Ep. period is de- finitely similar to the Middle Palaeolithic period, in the numbers of sites and skeletons, when compared per time-unit. Moreover, even the number of articu- lated (buried) skeletons out of the total number of individuals [17 out of ca. 80 in the Middle Palae- olithic (29), and 7 out of ca. 22 for the U.P./E.Ep.] is very much on the same scale. There is a sharp rise in the number of finds from the Late Epipalaeolithic, being more or less constant through several periods thereafter. A second rise is apparent in the Chalcolithic period. It is self evident that later sites are better preserved, but this is not the only reason for the observed trends. It should be noted that many of the Chalcolithic skeletons were poorly preserved, though the burial places were well-preserved and relatively easy to identify by archaeologists. This is due to the fact that these burial places were large graveyards, artificial caves or stone built structures. In other words, it is the 4th millennium architecture (of the burial place) that makes this period so differ- ent from earlier ones : there is no such architecture before, and though it had symbolic meaning (hous- ing the dead) - it made this period look "richer" in burial remains. Middle Palaeolithic skeletons were found exclu- sively in caves. It is interesting to note that although U.P./E.Ep. humans were also disposed of in the same caves (e.g. Kebara, Hayonim), their skeletons were poorly preserved. In open-air U.P./E.Ep. sites only isolated skeletons were found. It has been suggested that this may be due to poor preservation conditions, to the small area of excavation (e.g. Nahal Ein Gev, Ein Gev I), to the ephemeral nature of Upper Palae- olithic sites (30), or to the shallow nature of the graves. (27) The complete list of sites is available in NADEL, 1992 and NADEL, in press a). (28) E.g. BELFER-COHEN and HOVERS, 1992. (29) BELFER-COHEN and HOVERS, 1992 : table 2. (30) BAR-YOSEF and BELFER-COHEN, 1988. 118</page><page sequence="7">The Ohalo II grave clearly demonstrates a tradi- tion of burying in very shallow pits. It should be stressed that there is no evidence for erosion of a top layer at the site. In none of the features could we notice the missing or the truncation of an upper layer. Furthermore, in locus 1 the remains of the wall made of plant material were still in-situ around a floor. Had there been erosion, the bottom part of the wall would have disappeared. The H2 skeleton was buried very near the sur- face. As a matter of fact, it is possible that the top part of the lying body was actually above ground, and in order to cover it a thin layer of clay and sand was heaped on top. It is also reasonable to assume that the body was covered by perishable materials. Thus, only the quick cover of the site (after abandonment) sealed the grave and other fea- tures and saved them in-situ for 19,000 years. It should be noted that more human skeletal remains were found at the site, with no correlation to any grave or feature. At a site where in-situ and articu- lated delicate remains such as fish skeletons and a base of a wall made of straw and branches were recovered, one expects grave pits to remain intact. The isolated human bones could be viewed as rep- resenting disturbed shallow or above-ground burial installations. Shallow burial pits would be preserved only under very favorable conditions. It is possible that similar graves at Ohalo II (maybe at a greater dis- tance from the structures presented in figure 2) and at other sites were badly disturbed, resulting in the destruction of the skeletons and the preservation (if at all) of isolated bones on the surface of the site. Thus, the case of Ohalo II clearly demonstrates that it is not the ephemeral nature of the site that is the main factor causing archaeological invisibility of graves. Ohalo II is a camp of fisher-hunter-gatherers occupied for long durations (more than half a year for each episode) several times (31), and yet the graves are shallow. The conclusion reached here is that it is this tradition of disposing of the dead near the surface that affects the preservation of U.P/E.Ep. graves. This is even reinforced by the fact that many of these sites were not inhabited for durations as long as the Middle Palaeolithic occupations of some caves (deposits accumulating for several meters), and thus there was no quick anthropomorphic - derived sedimentological cover of the thin layers containing graves. There is another aspect to be considered. In some of the Middle Palaeolithic caves the skeletons were found in small areas of the sites (e.g. Skhul, Kafzeh). In sites of the following period, burials took place at various parts of the sites. At Ein Gev I a skeleton was found under a floor of a cabin, while at Ohalo II the skeleton was not found within any visible structure - it was buried outside the main habitation area (where huts and hearths were located). It would indeed seem that regarding the place of the burial, the relatively homogeneous Middle Palaeolithic tradition, and the more varied U.P./E.Ep. burial customs, did affect our chances of finding the skeletons. Skeletons under thick layers in the caves are relatively well preserved, and so are skeletons from later open-air sites, if they were buried deep enough (e.g. Ein Gev I). Some of the U.P./E.Ep. burials were near the surface or not under a structure in the actual living area of the camp, thus there was less chance of their being found during excavations. Through time, changes in settlement patterns, subsistence strategies and social organization were closely influencing the spiritual realms of human societies. Mortuary behaviour, as a central aspect of social life (32), was reflected in these changes. It was only since the establishment of semipermanent or permanent Natufian camps (33), especially in the open-air, that burial places looked very different from earlier ones. Now, more people than ever before were buried in one site, reflecting higher population densities (at specific sites and at the regional level) and longer habitation of each site. Thus, Natufian and later burial places and grave- yards are more visible to the archaeologist : they contain dozens and even hundreds of skeletons. Furthermore, Natufian and later (Neolithic and Chalcolithic) graves contain ample material evi- dence for symbolic behaviour correlated with burial practices. Of these, the more cited ones include construction of the grave in various ways (e.g. stone circles, cairns, tumuli), secondary burial, decoration of the dead, detachment and treatment of skulls and addition of grave goods/offerings. It is beyond the scope of this paper to explore the symbolic meaning of mortuary behaviour, or the details of the social units (within the larger systems) involved in funerary rites (34). However, it should be stressed that although pre-Natufian graves do not provide a wide variety of grave types and of treat- ment of the dead, symbolic behaviour was certainly practiced already by Middle Palaeolithic socie- ties (35). This, first of all, is supported by the fact that they buried their dead (or at least some of the dead) : an innovation reflecting a new attitude towards death and its implications for the survivors. Secondly, the details reveal a certain range of sym- bolic behaviour (36). (31) NADEL, 1991; KISLEV et al., 1992; LIEBERMAN, 1993. (32) HUNTINGTON and METCALF, 1987, and many exam- ples there.

(36) Ibid. 119</page><page sequence="8">The Ohalo II grave reflects a careful planning of the way the dead were disposed of 19,000 years ago. The posture of the body, its orientation, the incised bone fragment placed near the skull and the hammerstone between the legs attest to mortuary symbolic behaviour, performed at and after the death of a person. The well-established date of the site, and the details of the grave were used here to shed some new light on burial practices of the period. The analysis also showed that the Upper Palaeolithic period in the southern Levant is not "poorer" than the Middle Palaeolithic period, in the relative num- ber of sites containing skeletons, as well as the relative number of articulated skeletons and other human skeletal remains.
