Krieger This article reads the teachings of two rabbis from the Second Century through the lenses of cognitive science on legal reasoning and shows the relationship of their nar- ratives and legal opinions. Cognitive scientists posit that both logical and narrative thinking are essential and interrelated modes of cognitive functioning. The stories and legal decisions of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael, as described by Abraham Joshua Heschel in his masterpiece, Torah min Hashamayim ( Heavenly Torah) sup- port these insights. Consistent with the findings of cognitive science, the narrative themes and images of each rabbi permeate their legal rulings. Heavenly Torah also reflects Heschel's own narrative, his attempts to make meaning after the Holocaust and in the midst of 1960s America. As with Akiva and Ishmael, Heschel's narrative infuses his own approach to legal decision making. This article demonstrates that in analyzing issues, all legal practitioners consider both the logical principles of their legal system and the narrative themes and images they have created to find meaning in the world in which they live. INTRODUCTION Rabbinic literature contains two main modes of expression: halakhah and aggadah. Halakhah (plural: halakhot) is legal in nature: legal rules and decisions applying those rules in particular cases. It refers to the legal parts of the Torah (the Address correspondence to Stefan H. Krieger, Hofstra University School of Law, 121 Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY 1 1549. E-mail: Stefan.H. Kiieger@hofstra.edu</page><page sequence="2">1 70 KRIEGER first five books of the Old Testament or Pentateuch) and rabbinic interpretations of those legal rules. Aggadah (plural: aggadot) is narrative in nature: stories, biogra- phy, homily, and folklore (A. Heschel 1 n.[l]). Aggadot can either fill in the gaps of the narrative sections of the Torah or embellish those stories.1 Although the rabbinic literature is replete with aggadot, over time most rabbis considered halakhah and aggadah as two distinct modes of thought and treated aggadah as the lesser of the two. Traditionally, they felt that [i]n contrast to Halakhah which sounds a note of strength, Aggadah sounds a note of feebleness. Many have the sense that there is nothing that can be demonstrated by appeal to Aggadah. They see it as a game rather than a product of serious thought; its exegeses seem like the playthings of an unrestrained imagination. [Many] sages . . . regarded Aggadah as mere side dishes to the main course of Halakhah .... (A. Heschel 6, 13) In the early fourth century, Rabbi Zeira proclaimed that the volumes of aggadot were "books of bewitchment" (A. Heschel 12). Rabbi Saadia Gaon, the prominent religious philosopher who lived in early tenth century Babylonia, ruled that aggadot were not precise enough to become authoritative and that a rabbi could not cite aggadot as authoritative proof in legal decision making (A. Heschel 22). Consistent with this approach, by the late Middle Ages teachers in traditional Jewish schools tended to ignore aggadot except when students became tired and restless with their study of halakhot (A. Heschel 9). Even today, many traditional rabbis and scholars continue to view aggadot dis- missively. For example, in a recent opinion denying the right of rabbinic ordination to openly gay and lesbian Jews, Joel Roth, a preeminent halakhic scholar from the more liberal Conservative Movement, wrote: There can be no real doubt that normatively speaking the halakhic tradition is the given, and theology is required to fall into place behind it. Theology can, indeed, should, provide the narrative which makes the halakhic tradition intellectually per- suasive and emotionally acceptable and satisfying, and that narrative can change as needed, and it need not be the same narrative for everyone. Narratives, after all, are aggadic, and thus, neither normative nor binding. That claim, incidentally, in no way diminishes their importance. Whatever narrative works is fine, so long as the narrative does not reverse which is the dog and which is the tail. (30) In his magisterial work Torah min Hashamayim (" Heavenly Torah"),2 Abraham Joshua Heschel, one of the most influential Jewish theologians of the twentieth century, reviews and contrasts the halakhot and aggadot of two rabbis, Akiva and Ishmael, who lived nearly two thousand years ago. In doing so, Heschel provides us with a treasure trove of material for testing the traditional assump- tions that these two modes of rabbinic expression are independent and that aggadot are unrelated to halakhot and somehow inferior. While Heschel uses</page><page sequence="3">STORYTELLING IN LEGAL REASONING 1 7 1 the quite divergent legal opinions and stories of Akiva and Ishmael to identify their theological differences and the impact of their writings on Jewish think- ing throughout the generations, the examples cited by Heschel provide ample evidence showing that, contrary to traditional notions, a close interrelationship exists between the two rabbis' legal reasoning and their storytelling. This con- clusion is supported by the findings of cognitive science that narrative and logical modes of thinking are interconnected and crucial to the legal reasoning process. This article will read the narratives and legal opinions described in Torah min Hashamayim through the lens of cognitive science on legal thinking. I will first review the cognitive science literature on logical and narrative modes of thought and the relationship of stories to legal reasoning. I will then provide a brief history of the literary, cultural, and historical context in which Akiva and Ishmael developed their stories and decisions. I also will describe representative stories and legal opinions of each rabbi and contrast these narratives and rulings in light of the insights of cognitive science about the legal reasoning process. Finally, I will examine Heavenly Torah as reflecting the relationship between Heschel's own storytelling and his approach to Jewish law. COGNITIVE SCIENCE CONTEXT: LOGICAL AND NARRATIVE MODES IN DECISION MAKING While cognitive scientists today recognize the traditional Jewish understanding of a distinction between logical and narrative modes of thought, they strongly reject the notions that narrative thinking is somehow inferior to logical reasoning and that the two modes are independent and unrelated to each other. Jerome Bruner, a pioneer in cognitive science, posits that there are two modes of cognitive func- tioning. The first mode, paradigmatic or logical thinking, "attempts to fulfill the ideal of a formal, mathematical system of description and explanation" (Bruner, Actual Minds 12-13). The second, narrative, or syntagmatic thinking, constructs stories to account for our experience. Throughout our lives, we are bombarded with hundreds of stimuli. To make sense of this onslaught, we need to filter out details we consider extraneous and focus on those details we view as essential. In the process, we weave stories. Bruner theorizes that the narrative mode serves two functions: (1) It makes our experience communicable to others and increases cultural solidarity, and (2) it gives "a certain predictability to the plights of com- munal life and a certain direction to the efforts to resolve them" (Amsterdam and Bruner 1 15-17). Narrative forms are "recipes for structuring experience itself, for laying down routes into memory, for not only guiding the life narrative up to the present but directing it into the future" (Bruner, Life as Narrative 691).</page><page sequence="4">1 72 KRIEGER Logical and narrative thinking have different operating principles and standards for judging their appropriateness: logic strives for verisimilitude - for one truth; narrative seeks meaning - sense in a particular situation (Bruner, Actual Minds 1 1; Bruner, What is a Narrative Fact 23). Unlike logical argument, narrative takes for granted that the puzzling problems with which it deals do not have a single "right" solution - one and only one answer that is logically permissible. It takes for granted, too, that a set of contested events can be organized into alternative narra- tives and that a choice between them may depend upon perspective, circumstances, interpretive frameworks. (Amsterdam and Bruner 141) Cognitive scientists posit that both logical and narrative thinking are essential modes of cognitive functioning, and our decisions and behavior in general are con- trolled by both modes (Keren 177). Specifically, in regard to the domain of legal reasoning, narrative by its very nature makes it possible for us to relate abstract legal doctrine to actual cases: [I]t is through narrative that we provide humanly, culturally comprehensible justifi- cations for our principled decisions and opinions. It is through narrative, rather than through some impeccable, impersonal argument from first precepts, that we show how the plaintiff's or the defendant's case is to be judged as we judge it. (Amsterdam and Brunner 41) In other words, most legal cases are not subject to solution simply by resort to algorithms. As with all our cognition, narrative and logic control our decision making. As Robert Cover observed in his classic Nomos and Narrative , The student of law may come to identify the normative world with the professional paraphernalia of social control. The rules and principles of justice, the formal insti- tutions of the law, and the conventions of a social order are, indeed, important, to that world; they are, however, but a small part of the normative universe that ought to claim our attention. No set of legal institutions or prescriptions exists apart from the narratives that locate it and give it meaning. For every constitution there is an epic, for each decalogue a scripture. Once understood in the context of the narratives that give it meaning, law becomes not merely a system of rules to be observed, but a world in which we live. (4-5) Every story, then, has its own prescription of what is right and wrong, and every legal rule has its own underlying story. While logical and narrative thinking may operate according to different rules, they complement each other. There is no clear demarcation between a culture's rules of control and its meaning-making narratives. These theories of cognitive science raise serious questions as to the validity of the assumption made by traditional Jewish sages of a stark distinction between halakhah and aggadah. The stories and legal opinions of Akiva and Ishmael described in Heavenly Torah clearly demonstrate the fallacy of this assumption</page><page sequence="5">STORYTELLING IN LEGAL REASONING 1 7 3 and support the insights of cognitive science in regard to the relationship between law and narrative. LITERARY, CULTURAL, AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF RABBIS ISHMAEL AND AKIVA To begin an analysis of Heavenly Torah and the writings of Ishmael and Akiva, a short historical overview is necessary. If, as Bruner asserts, stories are a means for communicating life predicaments faced in a particular culture, it is important to examine the world in which Akiva and Ishmael developed their stories and legal opinions. Literary Context Akiva and Ishmael inherited a rich interpretive tradition. While traditional Jews believe that God gave the Torah or Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible, to Moses on Mount Sinai after the exodus from Egypt in the thirteenth century BCE, modern scholars believe that the text of the Torah was redacted from different sources hundreds of years later. Both traditional Jews and modern scholars agree, however, that the Torah was written in a form similar to the present text by the fifth century BCE around the time of the scribe Ezra, after the return of the people to Palestine from the Babylonian Exile (Halivni 12, 19). Traditionalists, as well as some modern scholars, believe that from the time of Ezra onward, the reading and study of the Torah became a regular practice ( 19-21). In their close reading of the text, ancient scholars discovered significant problems. The written text of the Pentateuch studied by these sages contained inconsistencies, gaps, and even contradictions, sometimes in the most essential matters of observance (Halivni 23). The written text does not seem to be writ- ten in chronological order (A. Heschel 240-41). In Deuteronomy, for example, Moses's prologue to his farewell address to the Israelites appears to occur near the very end of the speech (A. Heschel 240-41). 3 Moreover, as anyone who has read the Torah knows, numerous passages in the text are repetitive without any appar- ent explanation (A. Heschel 466). Both Leviticus and Deuteronomy, for instance, contain similar dietary laws concerning forbidden fowl but give no rationale for the duplication (A. Heschel 466). 4 Also, the text contains blatant contradictions (A. Heschel 303). While in Exodus, for example, God states that "no human can see me and live," two books later, in Numbers, the Torah explicitly says that God spoke to Moses "mouth-to-mouth . . . in-plain-sight" (A. Heschel 306).5 Similarly, the laws of the Passover sacrifice provided in Exodus vary substantially from those given in Deuteronomy (Halivni 25-26).6 Finally, numerous commandments for aspects of religious observance lack essential details. For example, although</page><page sequence="6">1 74 KRIEGER the Torah provides a list of the holidays throughout the religious calendar, in most cases it gives only a bare description of the practices for these celebrations (Halivni 24). Facing these perplexing problems with a text that ancient sages believed was the word of God, they sought to find meaning for these inconsistencies, gaps, and contradictions. In the process, they developed alternative hermeneutics for inter- preting the written text. The resulting exegeses - evolving interpretations, stories, and embellishments on the written law - were orally transmitted from generation to generation (Baron xxii). One sect, the Pharisees, came to believe that these oral traditions, as well as the written Torah, had been given to Moses on Mount Sinai and that both the Written Torah and Oral Torah must be observed (Baron 72). This oral interpretation was eventually recorded by the rabbis in the Mishnah (com- piled around 200 CE in Palestine) (xxii) and in the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds (redacted between the fifth and seventh centuries C.E.) (Neusner, The Four Stages 12). Another sect, the Sadducees, which died out after the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, believed that only the written text of the Torah had been given on Mount Sinai and needed to be observed (ix). Both Akiva and Ishmael lived approximately 70 years before the redaction of the Mishnah and followed the approach of the Pharisees, believing in the divine authorship of both the Written and Oral Torah. They were the two greatest teachers of the third generation of Tannaim, the rabbis who taught during the period preced- ing and at the time of the redaction of the Mishnah. Later generations nicknamed them "Fathers of the World" (A. Heschel 29). Cultural Context The stories and legal rulings of Akiva and Ishmael were developed in a primarily oral culture. "[T]he characteristic organs of the literary life were the mouth and the ear, and its main textual reservoir was the memory. Literary culture was commonly delivered orally and received aurally" (Jaffee 18). Manuscripts were composed; in fact, the two rabbis' narratives and decisions were preserved in those documents. However, these texts were written under the assumption that they would be read in an oral performance setting (18). Indeed, "their compositional styles drew deeply upon habits of speech and rhetorical traditions that had their living matrix in oral communication" (18). At the foundation of these manuscripts was the belief that the rabbinic literary tradition would be passed on through the medium of speech from sage to disciple (72). In this society, then, legal decision making was not a process of institutional adjudication or formal legislation (Jaffee 78). Rather, like stories, traditions about social or deviant behavior, economic relations, and ritual observance were orally transmitted from Sages to their disciples. While arguments often took place between different sages in resolving these issues, "[n]o consultation of a written</page><page sequence="7">STORYTELLING IN LEGAL REASONING 1 75 text intervene[d] between the perception of a legal issue and its authoritative res- olution" (78-79). Decisions were rendered based on these oral traditions, not abstract rules. In this context, Ong's observations about legal decision making in oral cultures are quite relevant. As Ong notes, "Oral cultures tend to use concepts in situational, operational frames of reference that are minimally abstract in the sense that they remain close to the living human lifeworld" (49). He describes, for example, how pre-Socratic Greeks thought of justice "in operational rather than formally con- ceptualized ways" (49). Formal logic, including explicit syllogistic reasoning, he asserts, was the invention of the Greek culture only after it had developed the technology of alphabetic writing (52). Ong cautions, however, that it should not be assumed that the thinking of illiterates is illogical. Rather, the reasoning of such people is simply not explicitly articulated in formal logical forms (52). Accordingly, while the rulings of Akiva and Ishmael rendered in an oral culture were different from Western legal decision making, which purports to be stated in terms of formal rules of logic, these sages' decisions had their own logic. These decisions were not articulated in terms of abstract rules. Rather, these rulings focused on the particular situations (either real or hypothetical) considered by the rabbis. Indeed, at first glance they appear to be "narratives." That difference from Western law, however, does not make their decisions any less "legal"; these rulings do attempt through a reasoning process to regulate behavior and to set norms for relationships in society. In fact, because these decisions were transmitted without the baggage of the technical language of formal rules of logic, they may help us recognize more clearly the relationship between law and narrative. Historical Context At the time of Ishmael and Akiva, early second century CE in Palestine, the Jewish people faced a major social and theological crisis (Neusner, The Evidence 40). In 70 CE, the Romans destroyed the Second Temple (25), and a large number of Jews were exiled from the land (E. Meyers 162). The Temple had been the physical representation of God's presence for the Jewish nation, and its destruction caused a crisis of faith among the Jews of Palestine (Neusner, The Pharisees 101). Their "confidence in the truth of the Mosaic revelation and the goodness of God was shaken" (Neusner, The Evidence 40). This despair became even more intense in the years after the destruction of the Temple. Around 132 CE, the Jews of Palestine rebelled against the Romans in a revolt led by Bar Kokhba (Neusner, From Politics 123). After this revolt failed, the Romans established a repressive system against the Jews and made the practice of Judaism a crime (123). Belief in the grace of God was weakened, and Jews began to question why they were forced to undergo this persecution (Neusner, The Evidence 40).</page><page sequence="8">1 76 KRIEGER Akiva and Ishmael The schools of Akiva and Ishmael emerged in the midst of all the suffering. Little is known about each of these rabbis, and much of our knowledge is based on legend. Akiva was believed to be a zealot and a supporter of the Bar Kokhba rebel- lion (Neusner, From Politics 99), who preached martyrdom and encouraged the Jews of Palestine to revolt against the Romans (A. Heschel 146). Akiva ultimately proved his commitment to the importance of martyrdom in the name of God ( 149). According to a well-known legend, Akiva was one of ten rabbis captured by the Romans and persecuted for violating the ban on the study of Torah (A. Heschel 135). While a Roman officer tortured him, Akiva smiled and recited a portion of the Written Torah stating that Jews should love God with all their heart and soul. When asked why he was smiling, Akiva replied that all of his life he did not under- stand what loving God with one's soul meant, but he was happy because he was now able to fulfill the commandment through his martyrdom (A. Heschel 135). Unlike Akiva, Ishmael, who was the descendant of a priestly family, was more of an accommodator and believed that the Jews did not have to revolt against the Romans or commit martyrdom when commanded to refrain from the study of Torah (A. Heschel 30-31, 147). Despite his political position, Ishmael, according to legend, was one of the ten rabbis persecuted and executed by the Romans (29 n.[103]). Cautionary Notes Before examining the stories and legal decisions of Akiva and Ishmael, some cautionary notes must be given. First, this review is based exclusively on the description of the writings of these two rabbis as set forth in Heschel's Heavenly Torah . As Gordon Tucker repeatedly notes in his English translation of the book, Heschel's arguments are phenomenological, not necessarily historical (A. Heschel 429 n.[16], 461 n.[23], 570 n.[55]). Heschel presents Akiva and Ishmael as eternal paradigms of two distinct theological approaches that have existed for the last two thou- sand years in Jewish thought (47). For that reasons, some of his selections of stories and legal decisions may have been driven more by Heschel's overall argu- ment than by historical accuracy.7 Since, however, little is actually known about the historical Akiva and Ishmael, relying on Heschel's descriptions of their writ- ings is reasonable. Moreover, because the purpose of this paper is to examine the interrelationship between narrative and legal decision making, its conclu- sions are relevant regardless of whether the texts are considered to be written by actual individuals or merely represent Heschel's portrayal of them. If the lat- ter, this paper is examining the relationship of Heschel's own stories and legal opinions.8</page><page sequence="9">STORYTELLING IN LEGAL REASONING 1 77 Second, while reference is made in this paper to the "schools" of Akiva and Ishmael, neither had formal academies at which their students studied. Both merely had followers who adopted their interpretive and jurisprudential approaches. Finally, it can be argued that the opinions of Akiva and Ishmael are irrelevant to any examination of law and narrative in contemporary society because these rulings are not legal decisions in the traditional sense. These rabbis' rulings were rendered without the sanction of the coercive power of the state. Some of the decisions, for instance, concerned the sacrificial rite which was no longer in oper- ation; most, if not all, do not address actual cases brought by interested parties. These objections, however, ignore the seriousness with which the rabbis of the period rendered their decisions. Many of the legal opinions, moreover, concerned communal and interpersonal problems that existed in their communities. The rabbis of this period operated as if the state might imminently be reestablished (E. Meyers 164). In this context, they rendered many of their judgments with the expectation that they would have an effect in the real world. Most important, they believed that their decisions were based on the will of God. For that reason, even if they knew that some of their decisions could not be immediately enforced by the state, divine sanction was ultimately possible. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STORIES AND LEGAL OPINIONS OF THE FATHERS OF THE WORLD Akiva's and Ishmael's Schemas Even a cursory review of the themes and images in the stories of each rabbi and his followers demonstrates that they had very different schémas about the world in which they lived. The narratives of Akiva and his school revel in the miraculous; imagine a very personal God directly involved in the world as a powerful warrior; see no clear boundaries between heaven and earth; and envision the people of Israel as dutiful followers, almost passive recipients, of God's commands. In their writings, Akiva and his followers "did not shrink from anthropomorphism . . . cherished imaginative meanings, . . . and created images of the supernal world" (A. Heschel 34). On the other hand, the stories of Ishmael and his disciples "sought to strip Scripture of anthropomorphism and to excise unnecessary metaphor and imagery" (A. Heschel 34). He and his followers used straightforward logic; shied away from the miraculous and supernatural; saw a clear demarcation between heaven and earth; and conceived of Jewish leaders and the people of Israel as somewhat autonomous actors (A. Heschel 34, 497, 532; Tucker, Translator's Introduction 65).</page><page sequence="10">1 78 KRIEGER As this section will demonstrate, these distinct schémas are reflected in the nar- ratives of these rabbis crafted as they attempted to find meaning for a community in crisis. In turn, these narrative schémas permeated their legal decision making and reasoning. Stories of the Image of God/Legal Rulings on Religious Obligation Given the persecution and suffering of the Jewish people in the second century CE, the affliction of Jews was a preoccupation of the rabbis living at that time. In Akiva's stories, affliction was extolled as a virtue and as a means for purification. They frowned upon the questioning of God's actions for everything God does is grounded in truth and injustice. Even afflictions could be a reward and not merely a punishment. Akiva told the story: A king had four sons. Upon being struck, one was silent; one protested; one begged for mercy. The fourth said to his father: "Yes, strike me!" Abraham was stricken and was silent. . . . [King] Hezekiah begged for mercy when he was stricken. . . . King David said to his Father, "Yes strike me!" For it says, "Wash me thoroughly of my iniquity and purify me of my sin" (Psalm 51.4). (A. Heschel 130) Akiva lauded David's response. "It was characteristic of Rabbi Akiva to love afflictions, and not gratuitously did he instruct his generation: 'Let a person rejoice more in affliction than in fortune'" (A. Heschel 130). (The legend of Akiva's own martyrdom concludes with his joyful realization that, with this act, he was serving God with all his heart and soul.) Ishmael's image of God in relation to human affliction was substantially darker. In his narrative, at the Sea of Reeds, the Israelites sang, "Who is like you among the gods, O [Lord]!" (Exod. 15.11). Focusing on the similarity between the Hebrew words for "gods" or "mighty" ( bďelim ) and "mute" ( bailemim ), his school put the following words into the mouths of the Israelites at the Sea of Reeds, "'Who is like You, God, among the mighty [baelimY - Who is like You among the mute [ba ilemin]' Who is like You in how you see the humiliation of Your children and remain silent!" (A. Heschel 137). For Ishmael, experienc- ing Roman persecution, even at the most triumphant moment in Israelite history, God's power was in some ways overshadowed by God's silence in response to human affliction. This contrast in the image of God is also reflected in stories about the split- ting of the Sea of Reeds. The text of the Torah refers to God as "a man of war" (Exod. 15.3). A disciple of Akiva portrayed this event with striking imagery: "God revealed Himself to them in all His armor, as a warrior girded with a sword, as a horseman in a coat of armor and helmet, holding a spear, wearing a breastplate and shield" ( A. Heschel 227). Another follower of Akiva recounted that at the Sea</page><page sequence="11">STORYTELLING IN LEGAL REASONING 1 79 of Reeds the Israelites beheld God publicly, as it is written: "And Israel saw the great hand (Exod. 14.31)" (A. Heschel 310). Ishmael's narratives, however, took the images in the written text and made them more abstract. At the Sea of Reeds, Ishmael imagined a vision of God with no need for armaments: "The Lord is a man of war" - Can such a thing be said? Does it not say: "For I fill both heaven and earth, declares the Lord"? (Jeremiah 23.24). . . . What, then, does this verse, "The Lord is a man of war" come to tell us? In effect, God says to Israel, because of your love for Me and because you have become holy by performing My [commandments], I will sanctify My name through you, as it is written, "Though I am God, and not a man, yet I, the Holy and Blessed One, am in your midst" (Hosea 1 1.9) - I sanctify My name by you. The Lord is His name - God does power through the power of His name, and has no need for armaments. (A. Heschel 227) These opposing views of the image of God in the two rabbis' respective stories are reflected in their legal rulings. One of the major issues confronted by these rabbis concerned edicts of the Roman government against Jewish practices, such as circumcision and public study of Torah, issued to undermine the morale of the people. These decrees raised the question whether a person was obligated to observe every law of the Torah, even under the threat of the death penalty. The majority of sages, including Ishmael, ruled that a person should transgress any law in the Torah when threatened with death, except for those commands prohibiting idolatry, adultery /incest, or murder (A. Heschel 147, 150). Akiva, however, decided that there were no distinctions between different laws of the Torah and that martyrdom was preferable to transgressing any commandment (146-47). Faced with the severity of the Roman decrees, the sages also tackled the issue whether to enforce the observance of religious practice stringently. In new cases that arose in his generation, Ishmael generally took the more lenient position and insisted "whoever imposes stringencies must prove their validity" (A. Heschel 724). He noted, "From the destruction of the Temple onward, it would have been proper to decree for ourselves no longer to eat meat or drink wine; but one does not issue a public decree with which a majority of the public cannot live" (724). Ishmael even posited that some of the laws of the Torah were optional and suggested that he opposed a new dietary restriction that prohibited the eating of cheese produced by gentiles (A. Heschel 151). Akiva, on the other hand, recog- nized no distinction between major and minor commandments. He declared, for example, "Not visiting the sick is equivalent to committing murder" (178-79). The distinction between the stringencies of the school of Akiva and the leniency of the school of Ishmael is starkly reflected in their respective rulings</page><page sequence="12">1 80 KRIEGER on the ultimate punishment in Jewish law, that is, denial of a share in the world to come, the afterlife. In all his opinions, Ishmael never ruled that a particular trans- gression would result in the loss of a share in the coming world (A. Heschel 176). In contrast, Akiva recognized this penalty in a number of cases: studying of non- canonical books; uttering scriptural incantations over wounds; and transforming verses from the biblical book, the Song of Songs, into barroom ballads (176-77, 177 n.[36]). For Akiba whose stories imagined God as an all-powerful, armed warrior at the Sea of Reeds and treated persecution of the Jews as a reward from God, the bound- aries between heaven and earth were blurred. In these tales, God was directly involved in all aspects of our aspects of our lives. Consistent with these themes, Akiva's legal decisions held that all of God's commandments had to be strictly enforced. Martyrdom, for example, was the only option in response to a Roman edict requiring transgression of any commandment in the Torah. For his followers, there was no leniency in the interpretation of the religious law. The law requiring visits to the sick was the same as strictures against murder. In contrast to Akiva's stories, Ishmael's narratives imagined a more aloof God, less involved - even silent - in the lives of humans. They downplayed God's inti- macy with humans. Accordingly, in Ishmael's legal decision making, this abstract, more distant God became less demanding than Akiva's. Ishmael's rulings focused on the realities of human life, not supernal demands and had a much more prag- matic, down-to-earth view of religious practice than Akiva's. Not seeing affliction as virtuous, Ishmael ruled that, on pain of death, a person should transgress most laws in the Torah. He put the burden on advocates of stringent practice to support their position and explicitly rejected any public decree that a majority could not follow. He had no ruling denying the afterlife for violation of commandments. Stories About Human Autonomy/Legal Rulings on Interpersonal Relations The two rabbis also had significantly different narratives about human auton- omy in relation to God. These stories concern the authority of both Moses and the Israelites. In regard to Moses, the Oral Torah grappled with many ques- tions left open by the written Torah: What was Moses's relationship with God? What authority, did Moses have to act on his own? What role did Moses play in developing the Oral Torah? Akiva's narratives portrayed Moses as God's duti- ful servant, doing nothing on his own authority. In Exodus, for example, when Moses descended from Mount Sinai with the Torah and saw the Golden Calf, he "threw the tablets from his hands and smashed them beneath the mountain" (Exod. 32.19). Disregarding the literal language of the Torah, Akiva embellished the text recounting, "The Holy and Blessed One instructed him to shatter them." The</page><page sequence="13">STORYTELLING IN LEGAL REASONING 1 8 1 school of Ishmael, however, read the text literally portraying Moses's decision to break the tablets as his own (A. Heschel 411). God played no part in the decision. These different approaches are also reflected in stories about Moses's indepen- dence in making commands to the Israelites. In Exodus, for instance, before the giving of the Torah, God told Moses, "[Let them] be ready for the third day." Four verses later, Moses changed the wording slightly and said to the Israelites, "Be ready for three days" (Exod. 19.1 1-15). Apparently, then, Moses added an extra day to the preparatory period. The story of Akiva's school read into the text a sec- ond command from God revising the original instruction to reflect the language of the second verse (A. Heschel 41 1-12). In contrast, in the account by a follower of Ishmael, Moses on his own added an extra day, making the period a full three days. After Moses made this decision, God, concurred (41 1). These contrasting images of Moses - as a passive follower of God's commands versus an independent player with some autonomy - have crucial significance in the conflicting narratives about the role of Moses in the actual writing of the Torah. In the narrative of Ishmael, when revealing the Torah, God gave Moses general principles on Mount Sinai but communicated the particulars of the law in the Tent of Meeting in the wilderness where Moses met with God on a regular basis (A. Heschel 462-63). For Ishmael, then, many matters given on Sinai were ambiguous and needed explication in the ongoing, day-to-day life of the Israelites. Moses brought these questions to God in the Tent of Meeting for decision (or perhaps for negotiation or collaboration). On the other hand, in Akiva's retelling of the Sinai story, God gave Moses both general principles and particulars on Mount Sinai and merely repeated them in the Tent of Meeting (463). Moses was the passive scribe. In a similar vein, in the narratives of Ishmael, when Moses used the expres- sion "Thus says the Lord" in the Written Torah, he occasionally altered God's language and transmitted only the general intent (A. Heschel 497). His school related, "[ J]ust as a hammer throws off many sparks, so does a single verse [of Torah] branch off into many meanings. . . . [T]he Torah granted wisdom to the Sages to expound and to proclaim" (577-78). In contrast, the disciples of Akiva portrayed Moses in their tales as merely God's mouthpiece: "Moses spoke only what the Holy and Blessed One had told him" (A. Heschel 497). A similar divergence is reflected in the rabbis' different stories about Israel's autonomy. In the Written Torah, in the story of the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai, the text reads, "Now all the people were seeing the thunder-sounds, the flashing torches" (Exod. 20.15). How, the sages asked, did the people see the sound of thunder? According to the Akiva narrative, at Sinai the Israelites heard what is normally seen and saw what is normally heard. The speech came from God's mouth, and the people immediately saw it and knew all the interpretations of the text. Everything was revealed at Sinai, and there was no need for any fur- ther human interpretation or explanation (A. Heschel 484-86). Human reasoning was irrelevant. In their retelling of the story, however, the followers of Ishmael,</page><page sequence="14">1 82 KRIEGER interpreted the words in the text "saw the thunder-sounds" to mean understanding through reason. "There was a partnership based on reason, for as they heard the words, they would explicate them on their own" (A. Heschel 486). These contrasting narratives about the authority of Moses and the Israelites are reflected in the two rabbis' legal decisions on interpersonal relationships. Like Moses in the wilderness, sages in second-century Palestine faced the challenge of setting standards in everyday life for interpersonal relations, including family law, life cycle events, and relations with the gentile world. Were they bound by particular commands made a millennium earlier at Sinai, or did they have some authority to set their own standards? Ishmael took the approach that whenever the literal language of a law on interpersonal relations could be read as conditional, rather than mandatory, it should be read as an option. "To Rabbi Akiva, however, every single word of Torah was a commandment and carried with it obligation" (A. Heschel 153-55). One example of the different approaches on issues of interpersonal relations was the rabbis' attitude toward jealousy in a marriage. The Torah, for example, required that a woman be subjected to an ordeal ritual before the priest if her husband suspected her of marital infidelity (Num. 5.1 1-31). The written text of the Torah required the ordeal ritual whenever "the rush of jealousy comes over [the husband]" (Num. 5.14). Akiva read this text as a commandment that all husbands, regardless of their actual feelings, must be jealous of their wives. Generalizing from the particular language of the Torah, Akiva created an obligation for all husbands (A. Heschel 154). Ishmael, on the other, read the text literally and rec- ognized no such all-encompassing command (154). Feelings of jealously were human emotions, not obligations from God. Another illustration of these divergent views concerns the burying of close rel- atives. The sages grappled with the question whether a person was obligated to interrupt his performance of a religious practice to bury a close relative. To answer that question, Akiva focused on a verse in the Torah (Lev. 21.1-3) that prohibited priests from coming into contact with a dead body except in the case of the burial of a close relative (A. Heschel 154 n.[25]). Akiva read this verse as a command requiring all persons, not just priests, to interrupt their performance of another commandment for the burial of a close relative. Ishmael did not generalize from a particular incident in the text and left the decision to the individual whether to interrupt his religious practice for such a burial ( 154 n.[25]). Accordingly, in the area of everyday affairs, Akiva read the Written Torah as giving little, if any, discretion to Israel in practicing the commandments. For Ishmael, however, whenever the text did not unambiguously require certain social behavior, the individual was free to choose. This approach is clearly demonstrated by some "case law" attributed to Ishmael. Under the laws of the Torah, a man is required to fulfill any vow made in the name of God (Num. 30.3). In the case before Ishmael, a husband, in a fit of anger, swore that he would no longer have</page><page sequence="15">STORYTELLING IN LEGAL REASONING 1 83 sexual relations with his wife. Later, the man changed his mind, wanted to have sex with his wife, and sought to annul the vow. However, he faced the stringent laws of the Torah in regard to vows. Ishmael asked that the wife be brought to his home, where he gave her a complete makeover. Ishmael then asked the hus- band, "'My son, is this the woman from whom you vowed no benefit?' He replied, 'No.'" Ishmael then permitted him to annul the vow (A. Heschel 154 n.[25]). Accordingly, as in their stories, the different legal decisions of the two rabbis reflect divergent views of human autonomy. To Akiva, legal obligations in regard to interpersonal relations were derived from eternal commands from Mount Sinai with no human intervention. To Ishmael, these decisions could, to a certain extent, depend on the context of the everyday experience of the people and their rabbis. Rabbis, like Moses, were required to read the Torah as given in human language, not as commanded by some supernatural voice. As is clear from the decision in the case concerning the husband who precipitously vowed not to have sexual relations with his wife, Ishmael saw the role of the rabbi as an active problem solver, not as a rigid magistrate. Akiva viewed that role as a passive, strict enforcer of given commandments. Role of Emotions in Stories/Legal Decisions on Intent Akiva and Ishmael also viewed the role of emotions differently in their respec- tive stories, especially in regard to an individual's relationship with God. The Written Torah is replete with passages urging the Israelites to "love [the Lord] your God, to walk in his ways, and to cling to him" (Deut. 1 1 .22) and promis- ing that if they walk in God's ways, God "will walk about in your midst" (Lev. 26.12). The stories of Akiva take these passages literally and extol the inner spiritual experience of actually cleaving to God. He portrayed God as a close companion to the Jewish people: "[Our relationship with God] may be com- pared to a king who went for a stroll in the garden with his tenant. The tenant sought to hide himself and the king asked, 'Why are you hiding from me? I am just like you"' (A. Heschel 192). In other narratives, God took a sensual delight in the sacrifices brought by the Israelites. In the Written Torah, sac- rifices resulted in a "soothing savor" to the Lord (Lev. 17.6). The school of Akiba imagined God hungering for the smell of sacrifices. Almost like a pas- sionate lover, God beseeched the Israelites, "I desire nothing but the sacrifices. Their sweet savor brings delight to me" (A. Heschel 86). As Heschel observes, "According to Rabbi Akiva's teachings, love and cleaving to God are matters given to the heart. Love is not an attribute of action; it is an action in its own right " (A. Heschel 200). The school of Ishmael rejected such anthropomorphic imagery and emotional flights of fancy. In its stories, cleaving to God meant actions: performing good deeds and studying the Torah, not an intimate relationship. In contrast to the</page><page sequence="16">1 84 KRIEGER images in Akiva's stories, in the narrative of that school, "the sweet savor" of sacrifices meant merely that God was pleased with the fulfillment of the com- mandment to sacrifice (A. Heschel 83). The purpose of sacrifices was not to arouse an emotional connection with God but rather to provide an incentive to avoid sin. Likewise, in Ishmael's narrative, the commands in the Written Torah to walk with God and cleave to God were only metaphors for performing God's command- ments. Actions in this world were the focus of his stories, not some emotional connection with the divine (A. Heschel 190-91). These divergent narratives on the role of emotions infuse the rulings of the two rabbis on the issue of whether evil intent, without any action, could constitute a transgression. In several places commandments in the Written Torah focus on the intent of the individual, not just his or her actions. The best-known of these laws is the prohibition in the Ten Commandments of "desiring the house of your neighbor" (Exod. 20.14) or in the second version "cravfing] the house of your neighbor" (Deut. 5.18). In interpreting these and other "commandments of the heart," the ancient rabbis faced the question whether evil intent alone was suffi- cient to find an individual guilty or whether some action was required to constitute a transgression. In regard to these commandments, Akiva required only intent to establish guilt; Ishmael adopted an "intent plus" requirement. To the school of Akiva, the use of the different words "desire" and "crave" in the two versions of the Ten Commandments was not a mere redundancy but rather established two separate prohibitions: (1) the intent to transgress and (2) the act itself. Accordingly, a person who craved only in thought was as guilty as one who followed through on that craving (A. Heschel 201). The school of Ishmael, however, treated the two versions as identical commands and held that a person must take action before ren- dered guilty. One who covets merely with words was not guilty of a transgression until he or she actually acted upon the craving (201). Even when the Torah literally did not impute liability for evil intent alone, Akiva sometimes found it so. In regard to the commandment not to commit adul- tery (Exod. 20.13), Akiva ruled that the law even prohibited contemplation of the transgression. Ishmael found that the commandment concerned only the act itself (A. Heschel 201). For Akiva, who focused in his stories on the emotional connections with God and who saw love of God as independent of obedience to the commandments, coveting one's neighbor house, contemplating adultery, or even having feelings of vengeance against another person could constitute an independent transgression (A. Heschel 202). In his view, we must devote our whole selves - emotions and actions - to God, and if our emotions are tainted, we can be guilty of sin. On the other hand, Ishmael was concerned primarily with the nitty-gritty living of our lives, our actions not our emotions. For him, then, the intent element in transgressions was insignificant. He ignored the plain reading of the Ten</page><page sequence="17">STORYTELLING IN LEGAL REASONING 1 85 Commandments and decided that coveting one's neighbor's house, without more, did not constitute a sin. Stories About Miracles/Legal Hermeneuitcs The Written Torah contains many examples of miracles, especially surrounding the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, their wanderings in the desert, and the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Confronted with a society of exile, persecution, and suffering, Akiva and Ishmael faced the daunting questions whether miracles were still possible in the world and whether God would eventually intervene to alleviate Israel's plight. Their own stores about these miracles reflect divergent answers to that question. Ishmael shunned wonders and miracles and instead focused on the natural world. Akiva, on the other hand, reveled in the supernatural and even sought to embellish the miraculous nature of events recorded in the written text. One example of the rabbis' different approaches to supernatural is the mir- acle par excellence : the splitting of the Sea of Reeds when the Israelites left Egypt. Rejecting an Otto Preminger approach, the Ishmaelian school's retelling of this story even tried to give a naturalistic rendering of this event. It read God's turning the sea into "dry ground " as meaning "somewhat dry ground" and "the water formed a wall" to mean "something resembling a wall" (A. Heschel 67). Akiva, on the other hand, was not satisfied with the literal portrayal of this event in the written text. According to an earlier tradition, God inflicted ten plagues on the Egyptians in Egypt and ten at sea. Akiva embellished the story even fur- ther and imagined that the Egyptians suffered 50 plagues in Egypt and 250 at sea (A. Heschel 67). Even in regard to manna, the miraculous bread from heaven, delivered by God six days a week to the Israelites in the desert, Ishmael was the rationalist. While most of the sages considered manna "bread from heaven" in the literal sense, the school of Ishmael recounted this story: [The Torah recounts], "The Lord will open for you His bounteous store, the heav- ens (Deut. 28.12). " Shamayim (heavens)" is an epithet for God, the Heavenly One. "Bread of heaven" means bread by the agency of God, not spatially coming from the heaven. Would you imagine that God would actually open the heavens? Rather, these verses speak of God's blessing, the symbolic storehouse of goodness. So too "bread from heaven" connotes bread from God's storehouse of goodness, which is found everywhere. (A. Heschel 69) Akiva expanded on the text, asserting that manna was the food eaten by God's ministering angels (A. Heschel 69). As these stories demonstrate, the distinction between the two schools in regard to miracles is not the difference between a literal and loose reading of the Written Torah. Akiva's stories seem more faithful to the literal words of the text than</page><page sequence="18">1 86 KRIEGER Ishmael's. Rather, the divergent themes reflect alternative views of the operation of the world. Where Ishmael saw order, Akiva saw miracles (Tucker, Translator's Introduction 65). The contrasting schémas in the two rabbis' storytelling are reflected in their approaches to interpretation of legal texts. The school of Akiva gave meaning to the precise language of the Written Torah - every word and every letter - even if the resulting reading might seem contrived. The school of Ishmael, on the other hand, sought to find a commonsense interpretation of a legal text read in light of the realities of the world even if this construction varied from the literal meaning. A good example of the differing approaches of the two schools to the language of the text concerns a law in Leviticus concerning harlotry by a priest's daughter: "And the daughter of a man (who is a) priest - when she profanes herself by whoring, it is her father that she profanes, in fire she is to be burned" (Lev. 21.9). While this language is fairly straightforward, the issue arose whether a distinction in regard to the penalty to be imposed should be made between a priest's daughter who was only betrothed and one who was fully married. Two possible means of execution were available - burning and strangulation - and in the rabbinic view, burning was more extreme (A. Heschel 49 n.12). In deciding this "sentencing" issue, Akiva adopted an exact reading of the text, and noted that the text reads " and the daughter," rather than "the daughter." (In Hebrew, the word "and" is noted only by a single letter, a vav, as a prefix to the noun following it.) Because of this additional letter, Akiva ruled that it did not matter whether the woman was betrothed or fully married; in any case, the penalty should be burning. He reasoned that every letter in the Torah must have meaning; therefore, the additional word/letter "and" showed that the extreme penalty of burning should always be the means of execution regardless of the precise marital status of the priest's daughter. Ishmael, however, found the additional word "and" to be superfluous and ruled that burning should only be used if the woman was betrothed. In the reported "in chambers" interchange between the two rabbis, Akiva argued, "Brother Ishmael, my exegesis is of the difference between 'daughter' and 'and the daughter,' to which Ishmael responded, "Shall we condemn this woman to be burnt just because you wish to interpret the letter vöv?!" (A. Heschel 49). In his reasoning strategy, however, Ishmael would himself rely on the precise, if stilted, construction of the text when it would serve some other policy goal. One example of this approach is his interpretation of the verse in Deuteronomy that provides the penalty for a town which engages in idolatrous worship: [S]trike-down, strike-down the settlers of that town with the edge of the sword, devote it to destruction, it and all that is in it, and its animals with the edge of the sword, and all its booty, you are to gather to the middle of its (town) square and are to burn with fire. (Deut. 13.16-17).</page><page sequence="19">STORYTELLING IN LEGAL REASONING 1 87 Following their respective positions on issues of interpersonal relations, Akiva held that these commands were mandatory, and Ishmael held they were optional. Ishmael, however, restricted the law even further: "If the town has no open square then it cannot be classified as a subverted town and it is not to be burned." This time, Akiva disregarded the precise language of the text for the sake of enforcing the commandment: "If it has no square, then you build one" (A. Heschel 154). Accordingly, consistent with his narratives shunning miracles, Ishmael was guided by the principle "the Torah speaks in human language" (A. Heschel 381). He sought to interpret the written text in a straightforward manner using human reason and sensibilities. Akiva, whose stories envisioned miracles in every aspect of existence, "extracted from every jot and tittle in the text piles and piles of [laws. He] believed it impossible that there be in the Torah a single superflu- ous word or letter. Each word, each letter issues the invitation: Tnterpret me!" (A. Heschel 47). HEAVENLY TORAH AS HESCHEL'S OWN NARRATIVE AND JURISPRUDENCE In Heavenly Torah , like many of his other texts, Heschel seeks to present a certain theological perspective. However, a close reading of the book discloses that, like Akiva and Ishmael, Rabbi Heschel himself was composing his own story, attempting to find meaning in the modern world in which he lived and to develop a jurisprudence appropriate for this world. In this way, Heavenly Torah is not only a resource for comparing storytelling and legal reasoning in two-thousand-year-old rabbinic law but also for examining the legal thinking of a contemporary rabbinic scholar. As with the analysis of the writings of Akiva and Ishmael, a little biograph- ical background is helpful to understanding the context in which Heschel wrote Heavenly Torah.9 Heschel was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1907. Both his mother and father were descended from distinguished rabbis of Hasidic Judaism, the mystical, revivalist movement that arose in Eastern Europe in the late eighteenth century. Heschel received a traditional Jewish education and obtained rabbinic ordination in Poland. At the age of 20, however, he left Poland for Berlin to study Jewish texts at a liberal rabbinical seminary and philosophy at the University of Berlin. In 1935, he received his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Berlin, writing his dissertation on the biblical prophets. Even after Hitler's ascendancy to power, Heschel continued to teach in Germany and live a traditional religious life committed to Jewish law. In 1938, along with other Jews living in Germany but holding Polish passports, Heschel was deported to Poland. For ten months, he taught Jewish philosophy and</page><page sequence="20">1 88 KRIEGER Bible in Warsaw. Fleeing from the Nazis, Heschel found refuge in England and then in the United States. His mother and two of his sisters perished in the Holocaust. In the United States, Heschel first taught at the reform rabbinical semi- nary, Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio, and in 1946 he moved to the Conservative rabbinical seminary, the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) of America in New York, where he was a professor of ethics and mysticism. He taught at JTS until his death in 1972. Heschel's published works reflected his eclectic interests: Yiddish poetry; a monumental text, based on his doctoral dissertation, on the biblical prophets; a book on the most distinguished Jewish medieval philosopher and rationalist, Moses Maimonides; numerous works on Jewish theology; and several texts on the spiritual lives of Hasidic masters. As his daughter Susannah Heschel notes, throughout much of his work Heschel "writes of the sheer joy of being Jewish, the vitality, the love of learning, and also the tenderness, the gentleness, the sincer- ity and deep trust of other people that characterized East European Jewry - and himself" (S. Heschel, Introduction xx). Heschel's prominence, however, was not limited to the arena of Jewish schol- arship. He was an early advocate for the rights of Jews in the Soviet Union. He took a leadership position in discussions of Christian-Jewish relations during the Second Vatican Council in the mid-1960s. He also was an active religious leader in the civil rights movement and against the Vietnam War. In 1963, he met Martin Luther King, Jr. at a forum on religious issues in race relations, and they quickly became friends. Heschel became a prominent spokesman within the religious Jewish community on behalf of civil rights. In 1965, he marched with King in the front line of the march in Selma. Then, Heschel became a strong advocate against the Vietnam War and, along with religious leaders from other faiths, helped found the antiwar group, Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam. From this short biography, it should be clear that Heschel was more than a typical ivory tower academic or a traditional rabbi focused exclusively on his com- munity or the details of Jewish ritual law. While he was a brilliant scholar, he also was a mystic, poet, and storyteller. (Anyone who has read Heschel's beautifully crafted writings is amazed that English was his third language. His prose reads like poetry.) While throughout his life he was a devoutly religious Jew, he was also a champion for social justice and peace not only for the Jewish people but also his country and the world. At the core of both his writing and his advocacy, he attempted to tackle the question: "How could the spirituality of Hasidism, the holiness of East European Jewish life, now utterly destroyed, be expressed in the language of postwar America?" (S. Heschel, Introduction xxi). Like Akiva and Ishmael, Heschel faced a world in crisis. The Eastern European Jewish community in which Heschel had grown up was destroyed; members of his family had been murdered in the Holocaust; secular philosophy proved inadequate</page><page sequence="21">STORYTELLING IN LEGAL REASONING 1 89 to tackle the issues of the day ; and conflicts between traditional and liberal Jews were growing. The country that had provided him safe haven from the Nazis continued to deny full civil rights to blacks and was engaged in a war that he considered imperialistic and immoral. In this context, Heschel was faced with his own crisis of faith.10 Heavenly Torah was one of his responses. In this text, Heschel paid tribute to both the wondrous tales of Akiva and the down-to-earth stories of Ishmael but was reluctant to endorse entirely the narra- tives of one rabbi over the other. Both, he felt, were essential to finding meaning for his generation. In this way, he developed his own narrative combining the themes of both Fathers of the World. To Heschel, recognition of the awe of the miraculous was necessary for navigating this frightening world. Acknowledgment of the realities, limitations, and demands of day-to-day living, however, were essential for living in this world, not outside of it. As he wrote of the approaches of Akiva and Ishmael, "Each interpretation has its own truth, but none can stand all by itself. Had the Torah been given cut and dried, we would have no leg to stand on" (A. Heschel 709). While this narrative point of view may seem too open-ended, fuzzy, and inadequate to some, "these tensions form the foundation of the mode of paradox that characterizes religious experience" for Heschel (Tucker Preface xxvii).11 Like Akiva and Ishmael, however, Heschel confronted actual legal questions in the real Jewish world in which he lived that needed resolution: for example, issues of proper ritual observance in modern times, the status of women, and rela- tions with the non- Jewish world. These issues were fueled by tensions between traditionalists who strove to comply with every provision of the Written and Oral Torahs and liberals who regarded halakhah as outmoded. In tackling these questions, Heschel presented his own approach to Jewish law: The Halakhah is the lens through which, seeing human life, one distinguishes between the forbidden and permitted, the suitable and the unsuitable, the liable and the exempt. Its mode of thought is that of rules, justice, legislation. But this raises several questions. Does the Torah contain but one mode of thought, the legal mode? Is there no role for the mode of mercy, that which commands action beyond the legal boundary? Moreover, does the Torah give us no life values other than those of "kosher" and "nonkosher"? Do we need to take into account the values of pleasant- ness and righteousness? If ... a person may be a "scoundrel within the bounds of the Torah," it is implied that there is another path, beyond the line of the Halakhah. (A. Heschel 782) Accordingly, like his open-ended narrative vision, Heschel straddled the worlds of both Akiva and Ishmael to advocate reverence for established precedent but openness to change. Heavenly Torah demonstrates not only that Jewish law has been infused by the two rabbis' different narrative voices, but also that Heschel's own jurisprudence continued their traditions and was permeated by his own storytelling.</page><page sequence="22">1 90 KRIEGER CONCLUSION While Heschel uses his close examination of these rabbis' aggadot and halakhot to provide his own theological insights, these stories and legal opinions also give lawyers, judges, and students of the law profound insights into their craft. These texts clearly support the theories of cognitive scientists that all human decision making, including legal judgment, is controlled by both logical and narrative thinking. As Bruner writes, narrative makes it humanly possible for us to provide culturally comprehensible justifications for our principled decisions and opinions. In the context of Heavenly Torah , each legal opinion of Akiva or Ishmael - or for that matter, Heschel - reveals an underlying narrative viewpoint that each developed to make meaning in their cultural environment, Moreover, a close examination of the stories of Akiva and Ishmael shows narratives packed with normative standards. The different stories about the pur- pose of the sacrificial rite, for example, certainly present fascinating portraits of God and God's relationship to the Israelites, but implicit in each of them is an opinion on the stringency required for proper religious practice. As the great twentieth-century Talmudist Rav Joseph Soloveitchik observed, every narrative has a normative vision (Soloveitchik 86). Both Akiva and Ishmael lived at a critical period in Jewish history. The Temple, the central focus of the people's connection with God, had been destroyed; large numbers of Jews were exiled from the land; the practice of Judaism had been criminalized; and Jews, including prominent rabbis, were humiliated and perse- cuted. In this culture, both rabbis wove narratives in an attempt to give meaning to this catastrophe. Akiva's stories centered on God's supernatural and miraculous intervention in the world; God's anthropomorphic manifestations and loving rela- tionship with Israel; and a passive, dependent role for Israel which one day would be miraculously redeemed from its present misery. Akiva, in essence, portrayed God as the central character in the story. Ishmael's narratives, on the other hand, focused on the natural cycles of the world, a clear demarcation between heaven and earth, and an autonomous role for humans in the decision-making process. Ishmael, in essence, viewed humans as the central characters in the narrative. These narrative themes and images permeated the legal rulings of each rabbi. In his decisions, Ishmael took a middle of the road, down-to-earth approach focusing on the humanity of the parties, the realities of the decision-making process, and the commonsense meaning of the written text. In contrast, Akiva's rulings were usually extreme, demanded strict compliance with commandments, and attempted to give meaning to every word and letter given by God. Because these stories and rulings were developed in a predominantly oral cul- ture, the deep interconnection between them is more evident than the relationship between narratives and legal decisions in a literate society. In an oral culture, legal concepts are expressed in situational frames of reference. Akiva's and Ishmael's rulings have an almost narrative quality. Only with the development of literacy</page><page sequence="23">STORYTELLING IN LEGAL REASONING 1 9 1 and, in Ong's terms, "the technologizing of the word," did those legal concepts become articulated in the language of formal logic. As Jewish culture became more literate, manuscripts proliferated, and eventually the printed word became the predominant mode of communication, and legal expression became more abstract and codified. At this point rabbis began to consider aggadah as a mere side dish to the main course of halakhah. These changes in modes of expression about halakhah did not alter the basic cognitive processes involved in the legal decision- making process. As Heschel demonstrates, both in his description of the works of Akiva and Ishmael and his own writings, contrary to the traditional perspective, halakhah and aggadah are inextricably intertwined. When rendering their legal decisions, these rabbis probably did not consciously reflect on the different narrative visions they had developed. Nor did they resort to simple algorithms applying the facts to the rules and established precedent. As human judges, they attempted to relate legal principles to actual cases using both the logical principles of their legal system and the narrative themes and images they had created to find meaning in the world in which they lived. The lesson that these stories and opinions teach us is that, as lawyers and judges, we need to understand the complexity of the decision-making process and recognize the crucial role that our culturally developed stories play in actual judgment. We need to view our craft through both the lenses of legal rules and the narratives of the people affected. Professor Stefan H.

While the terms halakhah and aggadah refer to different modes of discourse, midrash (plural: midrashim) is the general term used in rabbinic literature for interpretation of the written text of the Torah. A midrash is "not merely a statement of the plain meaning of a verse but is an investigation into its deeper intent and thrust" (Elon 275). 2. Heschel originally wrote Torah min Ha-shamayim in Hebrew in the 1960s. In 2005, the book was translated into English and edited by Gordon Tucker with Leonard Levin under the title Heavenly Torah as Refracted Through the Generations.</page><page sequence="25">STORYTELLING IN LEGAL REASONING 1 93 3. All references to sections of the Peneteuch and translations of those verses are from the Everett Fox translation. Five Books of Moses. 4. Compare Lev. 11.14 with Deut. 14.13. 5. Compare Exod. 33.20 with Num. 12.8. 6. Compare Exod. 12.3, 12.9 with Deut. 16.2, 16.7. 7. Despite Heschel's suggestion, for example, that Akiva was a strict enforcer of the Torah's require- ments for the penalty of capital punishment (A. Heschel 154), in other writings Akiva appeared to be quite lenient on the issue of capital punishment. "R. Tarfon and R. Akiva say, 'If we had been in the Sanhédrin [council of judges in ancient Israel], no one would ever have been put to death.' Rabban Simon ben Gamiliel says, They would indeed have [thereby] increased shedders of blood in Israel'" (Mishnah, Makkoth 1.10). 8. See Heavenly Torah As Heschel's Own Narrative and Jurisprudence. 9. This section on Heschel's background is based primarily on his biography written by his daughter Susannah Heschel as an introduction to a book of his essays (see S. Heschel, Introduction ix-xxix). 10. For example, at a vigil at Arlington National Cemetery against the Vietnam War, Heschel exclaimed, with the words of Psalm 22, "My God, My God, why has Thou forsaken me" (Fiske 17). 11.
