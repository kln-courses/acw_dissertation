<plain_text><page sequence="1">GENERAL AND SYSTEMATIC BOTANY TEXTBOOK OF BOTANY. Revised Edition. By E. N. Transeau, H. C. Sampson, and L. H. Tiffany. Harper and Brothers, New York. $6.00. xi + 817 pp. + I pl.; text ill. 1953. This textbook is quite different from most of those intended for beginning courses in general botany, and the authors make a great deal of the fact that nearly every chapter has been written to be read following the making of observations and the drawing of inferences by students, or after class discussion. However, it is conceivable that it might be read as a guide to making such observations and inferences. The authors lean over backwards "to avoid language patterns charac-</page><page sequence="2">410 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY teristic of abandoned ideas and interpretations" (personified and anthropomorphic interpretations). One is led to suspect that many students (and maybe some instructors) will find themselves confused rather than edified, at times. The drawing of "best inferences" (scientific conclusions, principles, natural laws, etc.) after specific observations and references is a worthy aim and one with which we might all agree although success might depend on whether the materials for such inferences are adequate, whether the student is intellectually able, and whether the instructor is capable and "on his toes." As to the content of the book, it seems better in the coverage of physiological than of morphological ma- terial, it is excellent for its emphasis on the interrela- tionships of parts of the plant and the ecological rela- tionships of plant organisms, but the material which might serve for a survey of the plant kingdom is some- what meager, and those who look for an evolutionary thread will find it tangled or undiscernable. Common, everyday things about plants and their economic and human welfare aspects are given in abundance, are well integrated, and should appeal to the "general- education-minded." Certain chapters, such as those on the Seasonal Aspect of Plants, Vegatative Multi- plication, the Origin of Plants Used by Man, and the Vegetation of North America will prove interesting and informative reading for any student or amateur botanist. It seems to me that this revised edition has little to recommend it over the original text, but that those who liked the original will doubtless approve this revision, while those who preferred other textbooks will not choose this one even though it has been revised. Certainly the present "edition" should be considered merely a revision, as the title page indicates, and not as a second edition, even though in the Preface the authors speak of "the major changes in the second edition." I was unable to find much that was new or any very striking improvements to justify calling it a second edition. However, as the authors indicate, there have been corrections of errors and some simplification of discussions, as well as a much revised and more adequate index, more references at the ends of chapters, and certainly some of the material has been brought up to date. We find alleles, antibiotics, apomixis, aureomycin, and bacteriophage included in text and index, to mention a few subjects, but it is disappointing to find no reference made to the rejection of the prin- ciples of Mendelian inheritance in Soviet Russia. A misleading reference found under "acknowledg- ments," is that to "many new drawings." To imply that there is much new illustrative material does not seem justified, since of the 424 figures in both original and revised texts, there have been only about 30 changes, some of which are doubtful improvements, some merely slight enlargements or better prints, and others very slightly modified diagrams.
