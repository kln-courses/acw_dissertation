<plain_text><page sequence="1">406 REVIEWS Religion,Religion, Philosophy, and History, by Thomas B. Strong, Bishop of Ripon. (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1923.) ' In these lecturesthe author says, ' I have endeavoured to put forward the view that the element in man's effort to interpret the world which expresses itself later as religion is a primary and necessary element in his reaction to his environment; or at least that it has the same kind of claim to validity that is allowed to those elements which express themselves later as philosophy, art, and ethics.' Philosophy, I take it, is in this context, intended to include science, and so to be equivalent to the whole output of the discursive reason. This discursive reason, it is argued, has assumed an unduly predominant part in man's inter pretation of the world; so that it has come to be looked upon, mis takenly, as affording the test, measure, or criterion of all truth. A juster balance would be secured if religion, and in particular, the Christian religion, were admitted to the rank of a complement if not of a primus inter inter pares. Such, if I understand aright, is the gist of the main thesis of this volume. It is seldom that a writer on philosophical theology has disentangled so successfully from innumerable side-issues and subsidiary details, this fundamental theological question ; and I think there are few who have handled it with more sympathy and less rhetoric. I will pass over the author's account of the history of the gradual differentiation of science, art, and religion, in order to reserve space for consideration of the important contention to which that is preparatory. I am wholly in agreement with the Bishop of Ripon as to all human thought, philosophy, or science, being, in the first instance, a ' reading into' the world by the human mind, rather than a 'reading off' ot passively received data. We are only now learning how essentially and inevitably ' anthropomorphic' we are; though that is not perhaps the happiest term to designate the truth that the fundamental categories of all our thinking are subjectively derived, and that '.understanding', in the last resort, means assimilating to self. The element of truth in the ancient dicta that like only knows like, and that man is the measure of all things, has of late years passed, I believe, from an anticipatory guess into a scientifically established fact, vouched for by psychologists, philo sophers,sophers, and inductive logicians alike. However, there are the further questions to be faced : Does ' reading into' end in ' reading off' ? Does invention merge into discovery? Does the tentative clue lead to know</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 407 edge of the fact? Is the anthropomorphic nature and origin of our thought irrelevant after all ? And if thought thus comes to know, have we the same right to believe it to do so in the sphere of religion as in the sphere of science? What tests can we apply with a view to ascertaining ? At this point my path diverges from that of Dr Strong's thought: though only to rejoin it at a point further on than, in these lectures, he has pursued his own. He objects, as I have already represented, to science or discursive reason usurping exclusive right to be the testing stone; it has received exaggerated predominance in this connexion. This view I must traverse. Reason is the sole test of truth, though not the sole source of clues and inventions. I think any common-sense person would subscribe to that declaration, provided ' reason' be left conveniently undefined, and would also accord to science much more of ' rationality י than to religion or theology, which no one takes to be an 'exact science'. But when 'reason' is scrutinized, it is found to include much more than apprehension of self-evident axioms or than comparison of ideas such as may be attended with logical certainty'; it reveals elements of faith or hope unverified and unverifiable at the foundation of all scientific knowledge such as transcends the pheno menal up to date. Thus, at a further point, not reached by Dr Strong's thought as presented in his lectures, I rejoin him. If 'reading off' ever is attained by ' reading in', we never can have absolute, i. e. logically demonstrable, knowledge of the coincidence being fact. If religious thought be more akin to art than to logic, it is now open to theology to reply with a tu quoque to science, which, in any aspect thereof that is relevant to its relation to religion, is but a substantiation of things (irrationally, in the logical sense) hoped for and unseen, and rests on belief. Unfortunately the question does not end here. I think that in the book before us it is conclusively shewn that science and philosophy cannot invalidate the religious interpretation. That, of course, is not a new discovery. It is a further task to shew that the religious interpretation can be validated in the same degree—that is, without further presuppositions— as can the scientific. Now there is one fundamental respect in which science and religion are for ever different. Both alike employ human artifacts; but science is in contact with 'reality' in its primary and fundamental sense, viz. that which, in sense-perception, is willy-nilly given; what is not ourselves or of our creating, but over-against us, and so as real, or as much ' thereas are we. This enables ' verification' and prescribes a limit to the flight of subjectivity. Moreover, many of the ideas with which science works are (unlike cause, substance, &amp;c.,</page><page sequence="3">408 the journal of theological studies which are anthropic inventions) derived from, and so are valid of, per cepts. To this extent—and it is surely a very large extent—science is founded on and keeps in touch with real or existent data. But where are we to find data, of the same self-evidencing reality, for religious thought to operate upon ? If no man hath seen God at any time, are not the data from which alone His existence can be problematically inferred, those which supply the world of science ? And as sensory verification is out of the question in religion, it seems that the veri liability of a scientific induction (once its underlying faith is recognized) is of a very different order from that of anything, in the sphere of religion, on which we would bestow the same name. For these reasons I would submit that the religious interpretation of the world cannot be credited with the same intellectual cogency as the scientific—by which, of course, I do not mean the mythologically mechanistic. In In order to secure equal cogency, the prevalent method of late has been to set out from ' religious experienceBishop Strong is more logically stringent, though I fear I must believe he is destined to be no more successful, in setting out from historical, particular facts; and at this stage his argument, so far as strong as it is modest, seems to me to become weaker. For instance (pp. 58-59), St Paul's vision is appealed to as a case of real contact with God; and it is represented that such spiritual fact is not to be found wanting because it is not amenable to the same tests as the experiences which give access to material reality. To St Paul, doubtless, the one sort of fact was as real as the other; and there is certainly no a priori reason for asserting that God cannot reveal Himself through a vision. But to us, with our sciences of psychology and psycho-physics, there is every reason to distinguish between the two kinds of fact; and I am afraid there is as little reason for believing as for disbelieving that God did actually so reveal Himself. Similarly the experiences on which inspiration and mystical apprehension have been based, are now patient of an explanation that does not indeed disprove their divine causation, but does modify their evidential value of such unmediated causation. There is an explanation of the historical forthcoming when we invoke Christian theistic faith ; but that such faith can be proved from particular facts, either of science or of history, seems to me an untenable plea.</page></plain_text>
