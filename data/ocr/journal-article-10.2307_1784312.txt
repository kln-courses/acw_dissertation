Paris: Van Oest 1930. 14X10 inches; viii-j-70+lvi pages; illustrations and maps. 350 fr A vast region covered with virgin forests would not, on the face of it, appear to be a very fertile field for the archaeologist, and the author, after describing in this finely printed and luxuriously illustrated monograph the discoveries that have been made, admits that we are only at the beginning of the investigation. Baron Nordenskiold uses the term Bassin de l'Amazone in a somewhat restricted sense, for he excludes the tributaries rising in the Andes until they reach the plains to the east of the mountains. On the other hand he includes a part of the coast north of the mouth of the river, which, strictly speaking, cannot be said to be part of the basin. The sources of information are two, viz. the state of Indian civilization observed by the earliest explorers and the archaeological remains. The character of these remains is necessarily limited, for the hot, humid climate permits the preservation only of objects of stone, clay, shell, and bone. Slight indications of woven material and basket work are revealed by impressions on the damp clay used for pottery before firing. The Amazon Basin being poor in stone, temples and other stone monuments cannot be expected. Metal objects are very rare, and in parts quite unknown, and where found were probably obtained by exchange from Andean peoples. None of the tribes representing Indian civilization in the Amazon basin spoke Aymara, Quichua, or Chibiha, and were therefore not related linguistically to the most highly civilized peoples west of the Andes. Of the three predominant families of languages spoken in this region?Arowak, Carib, and Guarani?the first was the most important, and wherever Indian civilization was relatively advanced it is to be attributed to the Arowaks, or at least to their influence. At the epoch of the Discovery they occupied the Greater Antilles, and their civiliza? tion had many affinities with that of the Amazon. The chief archaeological relics are of pottery, which has been found on numerous sites. One of the richest is Santarem near where the river Tapajos enters the Amazon, and it is interesting to note that it is situated in a district observed by an early traveller, Heriarte, to be densely populated by Tapajosos and Trombetas Indians who had a remarkable clay with which they made a beautiful pottery. Fine specimens of ornamented pottery come from the islands at the mouth of the river, especially Marajo. The Curuziaris, living below the confluence of the Yapura and Amazon, made pottery and traded it on a large scale. The Caripuana and Zurimo tribes south of the river Purus were clever wood- carvers, and their wooden idols were so realistically sculptured that Acuna thought modern sculptors might well take a lesson from them. The Omaguas on the Maranon below the Rio Napo, according to Carvajal, of Inca origin, who accompanied Orellana on the first descent of the Amazon in 1541, made a pottery the finest in the world. They were also clever weavers. In North-East Bolivia, in the neighbourhood of Mojos, Sara, and the Rio Beni, good pottery has been found. Jose de Castillo, an early visitor to these parts, praised the ware he</page><page sequence="2">AUSTRALASIA AND PACIFIC 385 saw there. The natives made roads as banks on which they could walk when the country was inundated, and also canals between the rivers. The archaeological discoveries obviously correspond with the civilization of the Indians as described by the early explorers, for it is clear that a remarkable pottery which excited their admiration was made both in the lower and upper Amazon basin, and was an important article of trade. The pottery discovered is of a varied character, com? prising vases, cups, urns, and figurines. Not the least interesting are the Funerary Urns, which are often anthropomorphic in form. There is reason for believing that burial in funerary urns characterized a later civilization than that when inhumation was customary, and further that the latter corresponds with the Tiahuanacan, the most ancient Andean civilization, the former with the latest, the Incan. If this dating is justified it may render it possible to fix the chronology of the discoveries in the Amazon basin. The evolution of Amazonian pottery would appear to show a passage from relief decoration through engraving to painted ornamentation, its latest development. Comparison of the Amazonian pottery with that of the Antilles and Central America raises interesting points. Some of the resemblances in the Antilles are striking, but the funerary urns, so common in the lower Amazon, are not found there. The pottery of the Antilles, though Arowak, is evidently earlier than the painted anthropomorphic urns of the continent. The art of painting pottery before firing was no doubt derived from the west, and eventually reached the Antilles, but never so far as the distant islands. We may assume therefore that the Arowak migration to the islands took place before they had learnt to fire the painting on pottery: at a time, in fact, when their pottery was still archaic. There are several characteristics common to the Amazonian pottery and that of Central America, especially Chiriqui and Costa Rica, e.g. tripod vases, especially common at Mojos, in North-East Bolivia, and vase supports in the form of caryatids found at Santarem. These features do not occur in the Antilles, pointing to the Arowaks having migrated before they were adopted by the Amazonian Indians, with whom they had then no longer relations. Space does not permit further reference to the many ethnological details and fertile suggestions the author's gift of lucid condensation has enabled him to compress into the brief text of this work. Sufficient has been said however to indicate how archaeological research may throw light on the ethnology of the region. E. A. P.</page></plain_text>
