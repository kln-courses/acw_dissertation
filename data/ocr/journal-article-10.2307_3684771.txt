<plain_text><page sequence="1">Concrete Rules and Abstract Machines* GILLES DELEUZE and FELIX GUATTARI S Strata, stratification. 3 The strata are phenomena of thickening of the Body of the earth, both molecular and molar: accumulation, coagulation, sedimentation, tucks. These are Belts, Pincers, Articulations. Three great strata are summarily and tradi- tionally distinguished: physical-chemical, organic, anthropomorphic (or "allo- plastic"). Each stratum, or articulation, consists of coded milieus, formed sub- stances. Forms and substances, codes and milieus are not really distinct. They are the abstract components of any articulation. A stratum obviously presents very diverse forms and substances, varied codes and milieus. It thus has both different Types of formal organization and different Modes of substantial development, which divide it into parastrata and epistrata: for example, the divisions of the organic stratum. The epistrata and parastrata which subdivide a stratum can themselves be considered as strata (such that the list is never exhaustive). Any stratum whatsoever still has a unity of composition, despite its different organization and development. The unity of composition concerns formal traits common for all the forms or codes of a stratum and substantial, material elements common for all its substances or its milieus. There is a great mobility among strata. A stratum is always capable of using or of striking another's substratum, independently of an evaluative order. And especially between two strata or between two divisions of strata, there are phenomena of interstrata: of cross-codings and of changes of milieus, mixings. The rhythms refer to these interstratic movements, which are equally acts of *Plateau 15, "Conclusion," from Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Mille Plateaux: Capitalisme et Schizophrenie, II (Paris: Minuit, 1980).

SubStance No 44/45, 1984 7</page><page sequence="2">8 Gilles Deleuze and F6lix Guattari stratification. Stratification is like the world's creation from chaos, a continuous and renewed creation. And the strata constitute the Judgement of God. The classical artist is like God, he creates the world by organizing forms and sub- stances, codes and milieus, and rhythms. The articulation constitutive of a stratum is always a double articulation (double pincer). It actually articulates a content and an expression. And whereas form and substance are not really distinct, content and expression are really distinct, so that strata correspond to Hjemslev's grid: articulation of content and articulation of expression, content and expression each having its own form and substance. Between the two, content and expression, there is neither cor- respondence, nor cause-effect, nor signified-signifier relationships: there is a real distinction, reciprocal presupposition, and only isomorphy. But content and expression are not distinguished in the same way on each stratum: the three great traditional strata do not have the same distribution of content and expression. (There is, for example, a "linearization" of expression on the organic stratum or a "superlinearity" for the anthropomorphic strata.) This is why the molar and the molecular, depending on the stratum considered, enter into very different combinations. 3 &amp; 4 What movement, what thrust drags us out of the strata (metastrata)? Cer- tainly, there is no reason to think that the physical-chemical strata exhaust the matter: there is an unformed, submolecular Matter. In the same way, the organic strata do not exhaust Life: rather, the organism is that which life opposes in order to limit itself, and life is all the more intense and potent by its very inorganic nature. And again in the same way, there are non-human Becom- ings of man which overflow the anthropomorphic strata in all directions. But how are we to reach this "plane" or, rather, how are we to construct this plane and trace the "line" which leads us there? For, beyond strata or without strata, we no longer have any forms or substances, organization or development, con- tent or expression. We are disarticulated, we no longer even seem sustained by rhythms. How would unformed matter, anorganic life, non-human becom- ing be anything other than pure and simple chaos? Also, all enterprises of destratification (for example, overflowing the organism, launching into a becom- ing) must first observe concrete rules with extreme care: any too brutal de- 6 stratification risks being suicidal or cancerous, that is, at once opening itself into chaos, emptiness, and destruction and yet closing over us the strata which harden even more and even lose their degrees of diversity, differentiation, and mobility. A Assemblages. The assemblages are already something other than the strata. They are 11 made, however, in the strata, but they operate in zones of decoding of the milieus: they first slice a territory out of the milieus. Any assemblage is terri- torial first. The first concrete rule of assemblages is to discover the territoriality</page><page sequence="3">Concrete Rules 9 which they envelop because there always is one: in their garbage can or on their bench, Beckett's characters make themselves a territory. To discover the territorial assemblages of someone, man or animal: "at home" ("chez moi"). The territory is made of all kinds of decoded fragments borrowed from milieus, but which then acquire a value of "properties": even rhythms take on a new meaning here (refrains, ritournelles). The territory makes the assemblage. The territory exceeds both the organism and the milieu and the relationship between the two; this is why the assemblage goes beyond simple "behavior" (thus the importance of the relative distinction between animals of territory and animals of milieus). While territorial, the assemblages still belong to strata; at least they belong 4 to one aspect of them. And it is from this aspect that one distinguishes in any assemblage the content and the expression. In each assemblage, one must find the content and expression and evaluate their real distinction, their reciprocal presupposition, their piece by piece insertions. But what already determines that the assemblage is not reduced to the strata is the expression becoming therein a semiotic system, a regime of signs, and the content becoming therein a pragmatic system, actions and passions. It is the double articulation face-hand, gesture-word, and the reciprocal presupposition between the two. That is there- fore the first division of any assemblage: it is both, and inseparably, on the one hand, machinic assemblage and, on the other hand, assemblage of enun- ciation. In each case, one must find both: what does one do and say? And between the two, between content and expression, a new relationship is estab- lished which did not yet appear on the strata: the statements or expressions express incorporeal transformations which "attribute themselves" as such (proper- ties) to bodies or to contents. In the strata the expressions did not form signs, nor the contents pragmata, so that there did not yet appear this autonomous zone of incorporeal transformations, expressed by the first (expressions), nor attributed to the second (contents). Of course, the regimes of signs are only developed in the alloplastic or anthropomorphic strata (including territorialized animals). But they traverse all the strata nonetheless and do cross them all. To the extent that assemblages remain subject to the distinction of content and expression, they still belong to the strata; and we can consider the regimes of signs, the pragmatic systems, as constituting strata in their turn, in the broad sense we have seen above. But because the content-expression distinction takes a new shape, we already find ourselves, in a narrow sense, in another element than strata. But the assemblage is already divided along another axis. Its territoriality (content and expression included) is only an initial aspect, the other aspect being constituted by the lines ofdeterritorialization which cross it and carry it off. These lines are very diverse: some open the territorial assemblage onto other assem- blages and make it pass onto these others (for example, the territorial refrain of the animal becomes the courting or group refrain. . .). Other lines woik directly on the assemblage's territoriality and open it onto an eccentric, inmemorial, or future earth (for example, the play of the territory and of the 11 &amp; 4 earth in the lied or, more generally, in the work of the Romantic artist). Still</page><page sequence="4">10 Gilles Deleuze and F6lix Guattari other lines open these assemblages onto the abstract and cosmic machines that they (the assemblages) bring about. And just as the assemblage's territoriality originated in a certain decoding of milieus, it is prolonged just as necessarily in these lines of deterritorialization. The territoriality is no less inseparable from deterritorialization than the code was from decoding. And it is following these lines that the assemblage no longer presents any expression or distinct contents, but only unformed materials, destratified forces and functions. The concrete rules of the assemblage therefore operate along these two axes: on the one hand, what is the assemblage's territoriality, what are the regime of signs and the pragmatic system? On the other hand, what are the points of deterritorializa- tion and the abstract machines that they bring about? There is a tetravalence of the assemblage: 1) content and expression; 2) territoriality and deterritoriali- zation. These are the four aspects in the privileged example of assemblages in Kafka. R Rhizome. 10 Not only the strata, but also the assemblages are complexes of lines. We can specify an initial state of the line or first species: the line is subordinate to the point; the diagonal, to the horizontal and vertical; the line creates contour, figurative or not; the space that it traces is of striated nature (de striage); the innumerable multiplicity that it constitutes remains subject to the One in an always superior or supplementary dimension. The lines of this type are molar 9 and form an arborescent, binary, circular, segmentary system. &amp; 1 The second species is very different, molecular, and of the "rhizome" type. The diagonal is freed, is broken or meanders. The line no longer creates con- tour and passes between things, between points. It belongs to a smooth space. The line traces a plane which has no more dimensions than what pervades it; also, the multiplicity that the line constitutes is no longer subordinated to the 2 One, but achieves consistence through itself. These are multiplicities of masses 10 or of packs, and no longer of classes; anomalous and nomadic multiplicities, 12 and no longer normal or legal; multiplicities of becoming, or in transforma- &amp; 14 tions, and no longer in enumerable elements and ordered relations; vague wholes (ensembles flous) and no longer exact, etc. From the point of view of pathos, it is psychosis and especially schizophrenia which express these multiplicities. From the point of view of the pragmatic, it is sorcery which manipulates them. From the point of view of theory, the status of multiplicities is correlative to the status of spaces, and inversely: the smooth spaces of the desert, steppe, or sea type are not without people or depopulated, but are populated by multi- plicities of the second species. (Mathematics and music have gone quite far in elaborating this theory of multiplicities.) However; it does not suffice to replace the opposition of the One and the 9 multiple with a distinction of types of multiplicity. For the distinction of the two types does not prevent their immanence, each "emerging" from the other</page><page sequence="5">Concrete Rules 11 in its own way. There are not so much arborescent multiplicities, and others that are not, than there is an arborification of multiplicities. It is what happens when the black holes distributed in a rhizome begin to resonate together, or 12 when stems form segments which striate space in every way and render it com- parable, divisible, homogeneous (we saw this notably for the Face). It is also what happens when the movements of "mass," the molecular flows, conjugate onto points of accumulation or stoppage which segment and rectify them. But inversely, and without symmetry, the stems of rhizome do not stop coming out of trees, the masses and flows do not cease escaping, inventing connec- tions which jump from tree to tree and which uproot: a real smoothing of the space, which reacts in its turn on the striated space. Even and especially, the territories are agitated by these profound movements. Or language: the lan- guage trees are shaken with sproutings and rhizomes in such a way that lines of rhizome oscillate in fact between the tree lines which segment and even stratify 8 them and lines of flight or rupture which carry them off. &amp; 9 We are therefore made of three lines, but each species of line has its dangers: not only the lines in segments which cut us and impose on us the grooves of a homogeneous space, but also the molecular lines which already carry along their micro-black holes; and finally, the lines of flight themselves which always risk abandoning their creative potentialities in order to turn into a line of death, to be turned into a pure and simple line of destruction (fascism). C Plane of Consistence, Body without Organs. 10 The plane of consistence or composition (planomene) is opposed to a plane of organization and development. The organization and the development concern form and substance: both development of the form and formation of substance or of subject. But the plane of consistence ignores substance and form: the hecceitis inscribed on this plane are precisely modes of individuation which proceed neither by form, nor by subject. The plane consists abstractly, but really, of the relations of speed and slowness between unformed elements and of the compositions of corresponding intensive affects ("longitude" and "lati- 11 tude" of the plane). In a second sense, the consistence concretely groups hetero- geneous elements, disparate elements, as such: the consistence assures the con- solidation of blurred wholes (ensembles flous), that is, multiplicities of the rhi- zome type. In fact proceeding by consolidation, the consistence acts necessarily in the milieu, by the milieu, and is opposed to any plane of principle or of finality. Spinoza, H6lderin, Kleist, Nietzsche are surveyors of such a plane of consistence. Never unifications, totalizations, but consistencies or consolida- tions. 10 The following are inscribed on the plane of consistence: the hecclitis, events, incorporeal transformations perceived for themselves; nomadic essences, vague 4, 6 yet rigorous; continuums of intensity or continuous variation, which overflow the 7, 9 constants and the variables; becomings, which have neither term nor subject,</page><page sequence="6">12 Gilles Deleuze and F6lix Guattari but bring each other into zones of proximity and undecidability; smooth spaces which are composed across striated space. One would say each time that a body 6 without organs, bodies without organs (plateaux), are put into play: for the &amp; 10 individuation by heccdit6, for the production of intensities starting from a zero degree, for the material of variation, the medium of becoming or of transfor- 14 mation, the smoothing of space. Powerful inorganic life which escapes strata, traverses assemblages, and traces an abstract line without contour, a line of nomadic art and of itinerant metallurgy. Is it the plane of consistence which constitutes the bodies without organs, or the bodies without organs which compose the plane? Are the Bodies with- out organs and the Plane the same thing? In any case, the composer and the composed have the same power: the line does not have a dimension superior to the point, the surface does not have a dimension superior to the line, nor 10 the volume to the surface, but always a fractional, nonexact number of dimen- &amp; 14 sions or one which does not cease to grow or decrease with its parts. The plane operates the division of multiplicities of variable dimension. The question thus concerns the mode of connection of diverse parts of the plane: to what extent are the bodies without organs composed together? and how are the continuums of intensity prolonged? in what order are the series of transformations made? and what are these alogical chain linkages that are always made in the milieu and by which the plane is constructed piece by piece following an increasing or decreasing fractional order? The plane is like a suite of doors. And the plane's concrete rules of construction are valid only in so far as they exert a selective role. In fact, it is the plane, that is, the mode of connection, which gives the means to eliminate the empty and cancerous bodies which rival the body without 6 organs, to reject the homogeneous surfaces which cover up the smooth space, to neutralize the lines of death and destruction which turn aside the line of flight. Alone is retained and conserved, thus created; alone consists that which augments the number of connections at each level of the division or of the composi- tion, thus in decreasing no less than increasing order (that which divides not without changing its nature, that which is composed not without changing its criterion of comparison . .). D Deterritorialization. 5 The function of deterritorialization: D is the movement by which "one" leaves the territory. It is the operation of the line of flight. But some very different cases occur. The D can be covered over by a reterritorialization which com- pensates for it, so that the line of flight remains barred: in this sense, we say that the D is negative. Anything can act as reterritorialization, that is "to stand for" (valoir pour) the lost territory; in fact, one can be reterritorialized on a being, on an object, on a book, on an apparatus or system. . . . For example, the State apparatus is wrongly called territorial: in fact, it operates a D, but is immediately covered over by reterritorializations on property, work, and money</page><page sequence="7">Concrete Rules 13 (it goes without saying that ownership of the earth, public or private, is not territorial, but reterritorializing). Among the regimes of signs, the signifying regime certainly attains a high level of D; but because it operates at the same time a whole system of reterritorializations on the signified, on the signifier itself, it blocks the line of flight and only allows a negative D to subsist. Another case occurs when the D becomes positive, that is, affirms itself through the reterritorializations which play no more than a secondary role, but remains nonetheless relative, because the line of flight that it traces is segmented, divided into successive "actions" (proces), swallowed into black holes, or even results in a generalized black hole (catastrophe). Such is the case this time with the subjective regime of signs, with its impassioned and conscious D (sa D passionnelle et conscientielle), which is positive, but only in a relative sense. One will already notice that these two great forms of D are not in a simple evolutionary rela- tionship: the second can escape the first, can lead to the first as well (we see it notably when the segmentations of concurrent lines of flight bring about a 9 reterritorialization of the whole, or to the advantage of one of the segments, so that the movement of flight is stopped). There are all sorts of mixed figures which borrow from very diverse forms of D. Is there an absolute D, and what does "absolute" mean? We must first better understand the relationship between D, territory, reterritorialization, and earth. In the first place, the territory itself is inseparable from vectors of deterritoriali- zation which work on it from within: either because the territoriality is supple 9 and "marginal," that is, itinerant, or because the territorial assemblage itself &amp; 13 opens onto other types of assemblages which carry it along. In the second place, 11 the D in its turn is inseparable from correlative reterritorializations. This is because the D is never simple, but always multiple and composed: not only because it participates at the same time in diverse forms, but because it causes distinct speeds and movements to converge after which one assigns a "deterri- torialized" or a "deterritorializer" to this or that moment. Further, the reterri- torialization as original operation does not express a return to the territory, but rather these differential relations within the D itself, this multiplicity within 7 the line of flight (cf. "theorems of D"). Finally, the earth is not at all the contrary &amp; 10 of the D: we already see it in the mystery of the "native" (natal), where the earth as ardent, eccentric, or intense home (foyer) is outside the territory and 11 only exists in the movement of the D. But, moreover, it is the earth, the glacial, which is the Deterritorialized par excellence: it is in this sense that the earth 3 belongs to the Cosmos and that it appears as the material by which man channels cosmic forces. We will say that the earth, in so far as it is deterritorialized, is itself the strict correlate of the D, to such an extent that the D can be called the creator of the earth - a new earth, a universe, and no longer only a reterri- torialization. That is therefore what "absolute" means: the absolute expresses nothing transcendent or undifferentiated; it does not even express a quantity which might exceed any given (relative) quantity. It only expresses a type of move- ment which is qualitatively distinct from the relative movement. A movement is absolute, irrespective of its quantity or speed, when it relates "one" body</page><page sequence="8">14 Gilles Deleuze and Fdlix Guattari considered as multiple to a smooth space that the movement occupies like a 7 whirlwind. A movement is relative, irrespective of its quantity and speed, when &amp; 14 it brings a body considered as One to a striated space in which the movement is displaced and that it measures according to at least virtual straight lines. The D is negative or relative (however already real or effective) each time that it operates according to this second case, either by principal reterritorializa- tions which bar the lines of flight or with secondary reterritorializations which segment and tend to beat back (rabattre) the lines of flight. The D is absolute, according to the first case, each time that it operates the creation of a new earth, that is, each time that it connects the lines of flight, carries them to the power of a vital abstract line, or traces a plane of consistence. Further, what compli- cates everything is that this absolute D necessarily passes through the relative one, precisely because the absolute one is not transcendent. And inversely, the relative or negative D itself needs an absolute in order to proceed with its operation: it makes of the absolute a "uniter" ("englobant"), a totalizer which overcodes the earth and which henceforth conjugates the lines of flight in order to stop them, to destroy them, instead of connecting them in order to create. (It is in this sense that we opposed conjugation and connection, although we have often treated them as synonyms, from a very general point of view.) There 9 is thus a limiting absolute which already intervenes in the properly negative &amp; 14 or even relative Ds. And above all, it is at the shift (tournant) of the absolute that the lines of flight are not only barred or segmented, but turn into a line of destruction and death. For that is precisely the gamble of negative and posi- tive in the absolute: the earth, belted, united (englobee), overcoded, conjugated 11 like an object of a mortuary or suicidal organization which surrounds it every- where; or else the consolidated earth, connected to the Cosmos, placed in the Cosmos following the lines of creation which cross it like so many becomings (Nietzsche's statement: Let the earth become the light one . . .). There are thus at least four forms of D which confront and combine with each other and that we must distinguish with concrete rules. M Abstract Machines (diagram and phylum). In an initial sense, there is not any abstract machine or machines which would be like platonic Ideas, transcendent and universal, eternal. The abstract machines operate in concrete assemblages: they are defined by the fourth aspect of assemblages, that is, the points of decoding and of deterritorialization. They 11 trace these points; they also open the territorial assemblage onto something else, onto assemblages of another type, onto the molecular, the cosmic, and constitute becomings. They are therefore always singular and immanent. Con- trary to what happens in the strata, and also in the assemblages considered from other angles, the abstract machines ignore forms and substances. This is what makes them abstract, but it is also the rigorous sense of the machine concept. They exceed any mechanism. They are opposed to the abstract in</page><page sequence="9">Concrete Rules 15 its ordinary sense. The abstract machines consist of unformed matters and informal 5 functions. Each abstract machine is a consolidated whole of matters-functions (phylum and diagram). We see it well in a technological "plane": such a plane is not simply made of formed substances, aluminum, plastic, electric wire, etc., nor of organizing forms, program, prototypes, etc., but of a totality (ensemble) of unformed matters which present no more than degrees of intensity (resistance, conductibility, heating, stretching, speed or slowness, induction, transduc- tion . . .), and diagramatic functions which only present differential equations or, more generally, "tensors." Of course, at the heart of the dimensions of the assemblage, the abstract machine or machines occur in forms and substances with variable states of freedom. But the abstract machine had to compose itself and, simultaneously, compose a plane of consistence. Abstract, singular and creative, here and now, real although not concrete, actual although not com- pleted (effectuies), this is why the abstract machines are dated and named (abstract machine-Einstein, abstract machine-Webern, but not any less Galileo or Bach or Beethoven, etc.). Not that they refer to persons or moments of accom- plishment, but, on the contrary, these are names and dates which refer to the singularities of the machines and to their accomplishment (a leur effectue'). But if the abstract machines ignore the form and the substance, what hap- pens for the other determination of strata or even of assemblages, content, and expression? In one respect, we can say that this distinction also ceases to be 3 pertinent in relation to the abstract machine, and precisely because it no longer has forms and substances which condition the distinction. The plane of consis- tence is a plane of continuous variation; each abstract machine can be con- sidered as a "plateau" of variation which places into continuity variables of content and expression. Thus, content and expression attain their highest rela- 4 tivity and become the "functives of the same function" ()onctifs d'une mnmefonction") &amp; 5 or the materials of the same matter. But, in another respect, we will say that the distinction subsists, and is even recreated, in the state of traits: there are traits of content (unformed matters or intensities) and traits of expression (infor- mal functions or tensors). The distinction is entirely displaced or even new, since it now concerns the points of deterritorialization. In fact, absolute deter- ritorialization implies a "deterritorializer" and a "deterritorialized" which are divided in each case, one for expression, the other for content, or inversely, but always in such a way as to convey a relative distinction between the two. So that the continuous variation necessarily affects the content and expression together, but does not distribute any the less two asymmetrical roles as ele- ments of one and the same becoming, or as the quanta of one and the same flow. Thus the impossibility of defining a continuous variation which would not take both the content and expression in order to render them indiscernible, but also which does not proceed by one or the other, to determine the two relative and mobile poles of what becomes indiscernible. This is how we must define 1, 2 both traits or intensities of content and traits or tensors of expression (indefinite 4, 10 article, proper noun, infinitive and date), which work in turns, pulling each other onward to the plane of consistence. The fact is that unformed matter, the phylum, is not a dead, brute, homogeneous matter, but a matter-movement</page><page sequence="10">16 Gilles Deleuze and F6lix Guattari 12 which includes singularities or hecclitis, qualities, and even operations (techno- logical itinerant offspring); and that the informal function, the diagram, is not an inexpressive metalanguage without syntax, but an expressivity-movement 4 which always includes a foreign language in the language (langue), nonlinguistic categories in the language (langage) (poetic nomadic offspring). So, one inscribes the real (on icrit a meme le rdel) of an unformed matter at the same time as this matter crosses and stretches the entire informal language: a becoming-animal 10 like Kafka's mice, Hofmannsthal's rats, Moritz's calves? A revolutionary machine, all the more abstract since it is real. A regime which no longer passes through the signifier, nor through the subjective. So much for the immanent and singular abstract machines. But that does not keep "the" abstract machine from being able to be used as a transcendent model in very special circumstances. This time the concrete assemblages are referred to an abstract idea of the Machine, and are affected by coefficients which take stock of the assemblages' potentialities, creativity, according to the way in which they complete (that idea). The coefficients which "quantify" the assemblages concern the variable components of assemblage (territory, deter- ritorialization, reterritorialization, earth, Cosmos); diverse intermingled lines which constitute the "map" of an assemblage (molar lines, molecular lines, lines of flight); the different relations of each assemblage with a plane of consistence (phylum and diagram). For example, the component "blade of grass" can change 11 its coefficient through animal assemblages which are of nonetheless very adjacent species. As a general rule, an assemblage is all the more in affinity with the abstract machine since it presents lines without contour which pass between 4 things and enjoys (jouit) a metamorphosis power (transformation and &amp; 10 transsubstantiation) corresponding to the matter-function: cf. the machine of [V. Woolf's] The Waves (Vagues). We have, above all, considered two great anthropomorphic and alloplastic assemblages, the war machine and the State apparatus. It concerns two assemblages, not only differing in nature, but which are differently quantifiable in relation to "the" abstract machine. It is not the same relation with the phylum, with the diagram; they are not the same lines, nor the same components. It is this 12 analysis of two assemblages, and of their coefficients, which shows that the war &amp; 13 machine does not have war as object by itself, but necessarily takes on this object when the machine gets itself appropriated by the State apparatus. It is at this very precise point that the line of flight and the vital abstract line that it completes turn into a line of death and destruction. The war "machine" (thus its name) is therefore much closer to the abstract machine than is the State apparatus, which makes the abstract machine lose its power of metamorphosis. Writing and music can be war machines. An assemblage is all the closer to the living abstract machine in that it opens and multiplies connections and traces a place of consistence with its quantifiers of intensities and consolidation. But 1, 4 the assemblage moves away from the abstract machine to the extent that, for 5, 9 the creative connections, it substitutes conjunctions which create blockage 12 (axiomatic), organizations which make strata (stratometers), reterritorializations &amp; 14 which create black holes (segmentometers), conversions into lines of death (ddldomitres). Thus an entire selection of assemblages is exerted according to</page><page sequence="11">Concrete Rules 17 their capacity for tracing a plane of consistence with increasing connections. Schizo-analysis is not only a qualitative analysis of abstract machines in rela- tion to assemblages, but also a quantitative analysis of assemblages in relation to a supposedly pure abstract machine. There is still a final viewpoint, typological analysis. For there are general types of abstract machines. The abstract machine or machines of the plane of consistence does not exhaust and does not dominate the aggregate (l'ensemble) of the operations which constitute the strata and even the assemblages. The strata "take" ("prennent") upon the plane of consistence itself, there forming thickenings, coagulations, belts, which are going to be organized and developed 3 along the axes of another plane (substance-form, content-expression). But, in this sense, each stratum has a unity of consistence or of composition, first con- cerning substantial elements and formal traits, and giving evidence of a properly "stratic" (stratique) abstract machine which presides over this other plane. And there is a third type: on the alloplastic strata, particularly propitious for the assemblages, abstract machines rise up which compensate the deterritorializa- 9 tions by reterritorialization, and especially the decodings by overcodings or equivalents of overcoding. We have seen more particularly that if abstract machines open the assemblages, they also close them as well. A slogan machine 11 (une machine a' mots d'ordre) overcodes language, a "faceness" machine (une machine de visaglitd) overcodes the body and even the head, a subjection machine (une 4, 7 machine d'asservissement) overcodes and axiomatizes the earth: it is not at all a &amp; 8 question of illusions, but of real machinic effects. We can no longer say that assemblages are measured on a quantitative scale which brings them closer to or farther from the abstract machine on the plane of consistence. There are types of abstract machines which do not cease working within each other and which qualify the assemblages: abstract machines of consistence, singular and mutant, with multiplied connections; but also abstract machines of stratification, which sur- round the plane of consistence with another plane; and overcoding or axiomatic 5 abstract machines, which proceed to totalizations, homogenizations, conjunctions &amp; 13 of closing (conjonctions defermature). So that any abstract machine refers to other abstract machines: not only because they are inseparably political, economic, scientific, artistic, ecological, cosmic- perceptive, affective, active, thinking, physical, and semiotic - but because they make their different types interweave as much as they make their functioning converge.
