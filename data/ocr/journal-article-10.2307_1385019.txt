<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NON-RELIGION OF THE FU- TURE: A SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY. By M. GUYAU. (With an introduction by Nahum N. Glatzer). New York: Schocken Books, 1962. 538 pp. $2.95 (paperback), $5.00 (cloth). Jean Marie Guyau (1854-1888), a stepson and disciple of the philosopher Alfred Fouillde, owes his obscurity to the fact that it was his fate to spend his brief career surrounded by giants. In addition, the lines of discipleship were curiously crossed. In a France dominated by pro- and anti-Comteans, Guyau was a fol- lower of Spencer. L'Irreligion de l'avenir was published in 1887 and an English translation one year later. Now that a new edition has appeared, a critical reassessment of his contri- bution is in order. Guyau was impressed by Spencer's use of the organismic analogy, evolutionary approach to religious institutions and comparative method. He saw anthropomorphic thinking as at the heart of man's efforts to explain natural as well as religious phenomena. The key to all such theories lies in man's need for association. The evolution of religion is from dogma (Ca- tholicism) through religious individualism (Li- beral Protestantism) to what he calls religious anomy, ... the absence of any fixed moral rule... the complete enfranchisement of the indivi- dual in all religious matters, the redemption of his thought, which is more precious than his life, the suppression of dogmatic faith in every form. Instead of accepting ready-made dogmas, we should each of us be the makers of our own creed. (pp. 374-375) It is worthy of note that the anomie or "normlessness" which many sociologists since Durkheim have been deploring as a basic factor in contemporary social problems, is for Guyau a necessary condition of progress from dogma to doubt, from religion to science,-one further evidence of 19th century evolutionism and rationalism, which he heralds with almost lyric fervor. His positive use of the term "anomy" is analogous in many respects to Max Weber's use of the term "alienation" in his sociology of religion. While Guyau sees merit In Comte's basic idea of a religion of humanity, he rejects "Comtism" because it is "cultist," preserving traditional dogmas and worship in new guise, with humanity now the "fetish." Ethical Cul- ture, while "prosaic," is more of a departure from ritualistic religion. Guyau's view of the future "non-religion" encompasses a plurality of associations.-without dogma or cultism- intellectual, scientific, moral and esthetic. In this rationalist utopia, metaphysical hypotheses centering around individualism and idealism would guide social action. Guyau for all his vision, shares the pre- judices of his day. Analogies between "savages" and children are numerous. Malthusianism is viewed as a peril to the survival of the race, the credulity, conservatism, timidity and mys- ticism of women are regarded as a challenge to the Free Thinker. Subjective, impressionis- tic assertions are accepted as self-evident. Ne- vertheless, Guyau's value to the sociologist of religion lies in his furnishing further documen- tation of the climate of opinion that nurtured commitments to rationalism, secularism, indi- vidualism and liberalism. While his concept of "non-religion" may be vulnerable to semantic criticism and his view of "traditionalist" reli- gion may be oversimplified, his humanism is freshingly provocative in an age when it has been under attack, when the mortification of self is a 20th century problem.
