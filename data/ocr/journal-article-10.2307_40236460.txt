<plain_text><page sequence="1">Edward Gutting Venus7 Maternity and Divinity in the Aeneid1 the Aenäd, Venus plays the incongruous roles of an erotic god- dess and a matrona with a mortai family. These rôles do not exist independently of one another, as if Vergil chose which mask she would wear in a given scene. Instead, they engage one another throughout the poem. Venus' first appearance in book ι flags the inconcinnity that arises between these two roles. Her mortai con- cerns dash with thè divine perspective that Jupiter assumes ought to belong to her as a goddess. Shortly thereafter, she meets Aeneas in a scene which foregrounds the friction between the erotic and maternai éléments of her character. In turn, this scene's echoes of thè Romene Hymn to Aphrodite emphasizes how thè gap between immortals and mortals informs Venus' precarious balance be- tween being Aeneas' mother and a goddess of love. The focus on Venus' relation to the mortai and immortal realms leads to further insight into her characterization in her meeting with Neptune in book ν and her speech before the assembly of the gods in book x. Ultimately, the way Vergil deploys the deep set tensions between her disparate roles helps shape our understanding of the technique behind Venus' characterization. In Venus' first appearance of the Aeneid, her interview with Jupi- ter at 1.224-296, 2 she plays roles typical for an upper-class matrona. Though she is the goddess of love, her portrayal in this strongly anthropomorphic passage is based more upon her iemale gender than her numen. Hère Vergil offers a more dignified variation on the kind of play which Apollonius makes upon mortai and immor- tal characterizations of Aphrodite at the beginning of his book 3. The portrayal of Venus as a matrona has multiple aspects. She is a mother driven by compassion for her son, meus Aeneas (1.231) as she calls him. At the same time, her concern extends beyond Ae- neas' simple well being to a high-stakes politicai game. She seeks to preserve Aeneas' birthright, Italy, with thè fervor of a matrona 1 I wish to thank Molly Pasco-Pranger and the editors of this volume for their kind help. 2 For thè scene in generai, see A.

Just like a human matrona, she can seek thèse goals only through thè indirect means of domestic politics, and so she lobbies Jupiter, her paterfamilias. As would be thè case for a mortai matrona, her participation in thè politicai game is predicated upon an identification with a man, Aeneas, who can directly partieipate in it. Even though she per- sonally has much at stake hère as a goddess - thè protection of thè Trojans, a specially favored people, the honors that will accrue to her as the goddess presiding over the création of the Romans - in her complaint to Jupiter she does not separate herseif frorn Aeneas: nos, tua progenies, caeli quibus adnuis arcem, navibus (infandum!) amissis unius ob ir am prodimur atque Italis longe disiungimur oris. (Aeneid 1.250-252) The first line contains a remarkable zeugma, in which the human son and divine mother of nos are both characterized as mortai by the caeli quibus adnuis arcem. Such a promise only has mean- ing when made to someone who is mortai and therefore without access to Olympus. Yet Venus includes herseif with Aeneas as a récipient of the promise. She has put aside her divinity, as it were, to play the Roman matrona. Finally, a matrona is never just a matrona, but also a daughter, and this generai iemale rôle is equally important in domestic politics. Venus takes that rôle hère as well, even though, given the com- plexities of her parentage, Vergil is not bound to depict her in this way. He eschews the Homeric tradition of Venus as daughter of Dione, but keeps her as daughter of Jupiter even though he could have ignored this and stressed her Uranian aspect. By petitioning Jupiter as a daughter, Venus does not make use of her seduetive powers as the goddess of love, as can be seen in the decidedly un- erotic kisses Jupiter bestows upon her, Olli subndens . . . oscula libavit natae (1.255-257). Venus' dual aspects as mother of Aeneas and daughter of Jupiter introduce a defining thème for her: tension between the mortai and immortai worlds. As daughter of Jupiter she is an immortal, but she is also the mother of a mortai. In this scene, we see the first</page><page sequence="3">Venus ' Maternity and Divinity in the Aeneid 43 évidence of the tension. Venus speaks to Jupiter from an immortal perspective when she calls to mind thè future greatness of Rome: certe hinc Romanos olim volventibus annis, hinc fore ductores, revocato a sanguine Teucri, qui mare, qui terras omnis dicione tenerent, pollicitus - quae te, genitor, sententia vertit? hoc equidem occasum Troiae tristisque ruinas solabar fatis contraria fata rependens; nunc eadem fortuna viros tot casibus actos insequitur. quem das finem, rex magne, laborum? (Aeneid 1.235-241) A long-term view of Rome's history is the province of the gods because only they will live to see it unfold. Rome's greatness is of special concern to Venus qua goddess because of her rôle as patron of the future city. At the same time, a permanent seat at history 's parade allows for a more sophisticated view of fate in which the big picture améliorâtes individuai tragédies, solabar fatis contraria fata rependens. The image of weighing which Venus chooses is apt because it recalls Jupiter's habit of weighing mens fates against each other, the action in which the king of the gods affirms his im- mortai rule over the mortai world. But the loftiness of the immortai perspective does Venus no good since she is too tied to a mortai perspective because of her son. She complains of eadem fortuna pursuing the Trojans. Immor- tals need not worry about fortune being thè same. If they wait long enough, the cycle of history will bring something différent. In fact, the choice of the word fortuna here is markedly mortai. Gods know the exact iron-dad détails of what will happen, and this is fatum. But when thèse things befall mortals, they expérience them as random events, fortuna, because they cannot see the long-term future. Yet Venus nevertheless must be concerned about fortuna being the same because death may end Aeneas' life before he ex- périences any of history's rewards. Thus, despite the immortals' long-term appréciation of fate and history, Venus asks quem das finem, rex magne, Xaborumì (1.241) on behalf of her son. Her use of finis further indicates concern with thè mortai condition. The mortai world differs from the immortal in its concern for finitude, l and Vergil makes this a leitmotif in thè scene. It begins with et 1 As we see, for example, in Aeneas' Statement, Ο passi graviora, dabit deus his quo- que finem (1.199).</page><page sequence="4">44 Edward Gutting iam finis erat (1.223), a backward glance at thè mortai world which effects the transition of scene from Carthage to thè world of thè gods, and Jupiter responds to Venus with his ego nee metas rerum nee tempora pono: / Imperium sine fine dedi (1.279-280). 1 Jupiter's response to Venus' unhappiness is to put everything back into a consoling immortal perspective for her.2 His first step is to promise that Aeneas will be deified, as is suitable for the founder in a ktisis narrative: sublimemque feres ad sidera caeli/ magnanimum Aenean (1.259-260). Having thus addressed Venus' excessive identi- fication with her mortai son, Aeneas, Jupiter can now soothe her by evoking the füll pageant of Roman history, with all its cyclic balance of Trojan suffering. Imperium sine fine dedi is the high point of his speech, and with sine fine Jupiter makes dear that he is not dealing in finite mortai terms, and by implication neither should Venus. All would be well following Jupiter's words, except for one problem. Aeneas is not yet deified, and so Venus is still implicated in thè mortai world. Imperium sine fine would be fine comfort from a purely immortai viewpoint, but it is lacking as long as Venus is tied by a human son to the limitations of thè mortai world. This is why Venus must still personally intervene at Carthage even though she knows the grand narrative of Rome has been decreed by fate.3 Though Vergil characterizes Venus in thè above scene through thè generai type of an upper-class Roman matrona to the exclusion of her more familiär rôles as a goddess, thè next scene character- izes her through both the maternai and divine types that make up her character. In the resulting tension, we begin to see that a dis- tinctive personality all her own arises from the generalized types which constitute her.

This may be a surprise, given that she appears disguised in a Diana-like costume:1 Nudagenu nodoque sinus collecta fluentis (1.320) recalls Diana's iconography,2 and so prompts Aeneas to ask, an Phoebi soror? an Nympharum sanguinis una (1.329). But the amusing irony of imagining Venus disguised as the chaste goddess brings her position as goddess of love to the fore by contrast. This initial impression that we are not dealing with Venus as ma- trona or daughter is confirmed in the way Venus teils thè story of Dido (1.1.335-370). 3 Specifically, Venus relies heavily on the terminology of erotic el- egy to teil Dido's story.4 Sychaeus, for example, is magno miserae dilectus amore (1.344). The application of magnus to amor is a staple of elegy, as is thè word diligere, which is used interchangeably with amare. Miser, in turn, is regularly applied to lovers who are separat- ed, often by death, and so hère proleptically partakes of this usage in füll.5 These instances come as no surprise; Dido and Sychaeus were certainly lovers and the language is appropriate. But Venus does not apply this erotic vocabulary only to them; it informs all thè rest of thè story. The story 's villain, Pygmalion, is cast as a kind of horrible per- version of the normal erotic lover. He acts auri caecus amore. Catul- lus at 67.25 uses just such terminology to describe improper erotic behavior. A father's incest is speculatively attributed to caeco amore. Caecus amor continues to crop up in later elegy, for example in Propertius 2.14.17 and Ovid, Fasti 2.762. When Pygmalion acts on this love, the language is still that of erotic elegy. He kills Sychaeus, dam ferro incautum superat, securus amorum / germanae (1.350). Se- 1 E. L. Harrison, Why did Venus Wear Boots?

Ferrum and its merci- less firmness describe the cruelty of those who separate lovers, as Pygmalion's sword literally does. * Incautus applies to those who unhappily are too little aware of erotic rivais.2 Indeed, compare Unes 1.348-351 to the description of Orestes' murder of Neoptol- emus due to their erotic rivalry over Hermione at 3.330-332: quos inter médius venit furor. ille Sychaeum impius ante aras atque auri caecus amore clam ferro incautum superai, securus amorum germanae; factumque diu celavit... (Aeneid 1.248-251) ast illum ereptae magno flammatus amore coniugis et scelerum furiis agitatus Orestes excipit incautum patriasque obtruncat ad aras. (Aeneid 3.330-332) As thè underlined words show, Neoptolemus' death is described in terms strikingly similar to the book 1 passage.3 Venus caps off the horrifie murder with factumque diu celavit et aegram / multa malus simulans vana spe lusit amantem. Dido plays the role of the wretched lover, left by her beloved, as she will again in book iv. She is mentioned twice, once at thè end of each line, by aegram and amantem respectively, both good elegiac terms for the love-lorn. Pygmalion, for his part, turns elegiac love play on its head in a dreadful way. Celare, simvdare, vanus, and spes aÛ hâve a part in the delicacies of erotic courtship. Accordingly, in erotic elegy they should precede the triumphant ludere which would follow upon vanquishing an incautus rivai. In a most curious way, the erotic vo- cabulary is suited to seeing Pygmalion as a rival for Dido's love. Thus, Venus indiscriminately colors the passage with erotic love. While this is certainly appropriate for the two lovers Dido and Sychaeus, it is not at all so for Pygmalion. He is at best a twisted version of an elegiac lover, motivated by auri amor rather than de- sire for another person. But this erotic coloring of him becomes utterly stränge when it casts him as a rival for Dido's love.

This clash between Pygmalion's literal role in thè story and his characterization through Venus' focus on erotic love puts her firmly in the rôle of goddess of love, a divinity who opérâtes wholly in erotic terms. Venus can only describe Pygmalion's crime through the metaphor of erotic elegy. To depict him as a villain she présents a perverted picture of an elegiac hero (i.e., the elegiac lover, possessed by an unstoppable desire, trying to triumph over rivais, adept at thè game of love). This emphasis on the erotic is in striking contrast to the pre- vious scene, in which Venus played with ease the daughter and matrona. But the contrast is no less jarring than, for example, the discontinuity of Mezentius acting as vicious tyrant and then as lov- ing father. In this case, the présence of Aeneas, however, does not allow Venus to act as goddess of love throughout thè scene. The purpose of her visit is both maternai and erotic. She will insure the safety of her son by means of a love affair with Dido. To this end she has made Dido as attractive as possible to Aeneas, highlighting the similarities between them, namely, their status as refugees and their loss of a beloved spouse.1 Venus will make Dido fall in love with Aeneas, and therefore it is essential that Aeneas be inclined to return those feelings. While a love affair may protect Aeneas, unrequited love on Dido's part risks the opposite, as Venus' literary antécédent in thè Hippolytus so starkly shows.2 The maternai side of Venus appears again in her final speech be- fore she leaves Aeneas. Aeneas tells her, maire dea monstrante viam data fata secutus (1.382), and once again she maternally shows her son the way : perge modo atque hinc te reginae ad limina perfer (1.389). Her use of augury to comfort him recalls her father Jupiter's own unveiling of the future to comfort her in the previous scene, and her preface to the augury, ni frustra augunum vani docuere parentes, playfully alludes to that connection. 1 E.

(Aenäd 1.407-409) What is Aeneas' objection? Venus in 1.387-401 was the good mother, showing him where to go next (a role Aeneas has already acknowledged) and comforting his fears of friends lost. The ob- jection is to Venus' disguise, the falsa imago of a Diana-like Tyr- ian maiden. Such a disguise, and the subséquent récognition, is typical when a goddess deals with a favored mortai, but not with a son. Thetis in the Riad never disguised herseif for Achilles. So Aeneas points to a tension between his mother's behavior as god- dess and as mother. This tension is even more spécifie. Venus is the goddess of love, and as such her disguise, as we hâve seen, serves as a foil to her eroticism. This would all be appropriate and undistressing if Venus were funetioning only as a tutelary goddess. * Athena at Odyssey 13.221 meets Odysseus in disguise, and the resuit is a liar's match in which both characters appreciate each other's métis, a satisfy- ing outcome showing how well hero and tutelary goddess are matched. Aeneas, however, is not the sort of mortai Venus would normally aid; someone like Paris is more her type. In fact, one can imagine the scene recast with Paris in Aeneas' place, the resuit be- ing a mutuai appréciation between hero and goddess of thè ironie play inhérent in the erotic goddess's chaste disguise, especially when she teils thè story of Dido, a subject fit for a Tyrian maid, but told in erotic language all Venus' own.2 But Aeneas is embar- rassingly unerotic, especially in comparison to Venus' other son, Cupid. 3 As a resuit her disguise reveals a yawning gulf between her and Aeneas. So Venus deals with Aeneas as mother to son, but also as erotic goddess to hero, and the closeness of the former is under- 1 Harrison (above, [n. 1 on p. 45]), p. 47. 2 Furthermore, were the scene with Paris instead of Aeneas, the eroticism which Venus oozes throughout would not hâve its disturbing incestuous overtones, on which see E.

MORTALITY AND ImMORTALITY This tension between Venus' engagement in mortai and immor- tal worlds gains depth when her meeting with Aeneas is viewed alongside thè Romene Hymn to Aphrodite. 2 In the Hymn, Zeus forc- es Aphrodite into a liaison with Anchises as a humiliating punish- ment, a payback for her similar humiliation of himself and other gods. After she has spent the night with Anchises, she enumerates the problems immortals encounter in dealing too intimately with mortals. Using the stories of Ganymede and Tithonus as parables3 she shows how thè gap between mortai and immortal cannot be closed even when a mortai is given endless life. The mortai must pay too high a price for such a boon, and as a resuit becomes, though technically immortal, an incomplete, déficient person.4 Ganymede remains in a state of arrested development, forever the youthful wine pourer and eromenos, never to become a man. Tithonus stands as his polar opposite, caught forever by old age. Because the gift of everlasting life is insufficient to make mortals perfect immortals, Aphrodite faces the unpleasant prospect of leaving Anchises mortai and watching him grow old; an unaeeept- able option for her because immortals hate aging, one of the dear- est signs of mortality. An equal problem is the différence in status between mortals and immortals. Aphrodite has stooped too low in making love to Anchises, and she will now be subjeet to meg' oneidos from the other gods. The crowning piece of the humilia- tion and displeasure Aphrodite takes in her forced association with thè mortai world is her conception of a mortai son. In récognition of this, and perhaps of the pain a mortai son will bring her in the manner of Achilles and Thetis, she names him Aeneas, explaining it by etymological connection to ainon aehos. 1 Thus Wlosok (above, [n. 2 on p. 41]), pp. 86 ff. rightly sees that Venus' disguise emphasizes thè gap between gods and mortals. 2 The loti classiti for such mortai /immortal tension, of course, are the scènes be- tween Thetis and Achilles in the Riad. Apollonius' Argonautica 4.783-884 and Catullus 64 (esp. its emphasis on mortality at 366-375) stand out as well. 3 Lines 202-238. 4 P. Smith, Nursling of Mortality, Frankfurt am Main 1981, pp. 71-82.</page><page sequence="10">50 Edward Gutting Vergil acknowledges this rieh literary tradition of the difficul- ties engendered by thè mingling of mortai and immortai worlds in thè meeting of Venus and Aeneas in Book 1. His own view of such difficulties appears in his présentation of thè painful gap between Venus' rôles as tutelary erotic goddess and mother, but he also evokes thè Romene Hymn to Aphrodite through a séries of parallels. * Venus appears to Aeneas disguised as a mortai, as Aph- rodite did to Anchises, and in a wilderness setting that matches Mt. Ida. The détails of the disguise put an emphasis on Venus' clothing and appearance similar to that achieved in the Hymn by its detailed description of her dressing prior to meeting Anchises (Unes 53-67) and undressing in his hut (Unes 161-165). Like Anchis- es, Aeneas immediately suspects that she is a god, but she de- murs and diverts his attention. In Aeneid 1, Venus does not directly answer Aeneas' question about her divinity, but instead explains how her clothing is typical of Tyrian maids. In the Hymn, she behaves similarly when she diverts Anchises' interest from her di- vinity by focusing on an explanation of why she can speak Trojan even though she is from Phrygia. In both cases Venus allows the mortai to know who she is at thè end of thè scene, and in both cases causes thè mortai anguish. Finally, at the end of her meet- ing with Aeneas, Venus leaves for Paphus, the place from which in the Hymn she sets out for Ida Thus, Vergil acknowledges prior treatment of the problems encountered when divine and mortai realms mix. Working from this basis, Vergil develops the thème in directions ail his own. We hâve seen how in book 1 Vergil uses finis to highlight thè mor- tai /immortai dichotomy from which thè conflicts that illuminate Venus' personality arise. Venus' meeting with Neptune (5.779-815) extends the contrast of the finitude of mortality and the absence of boundaries for immortals, thereby further characterizing Venus 1 C.-A. Sainte-Beuve, Étude sure Virale, Paris 1891, pp. 251-260 (edn. with preface dated 1855), and A. Barchiesi, Rappresentazioni del dolore e interpretatone nelVEneide, «Ant. und Abendl.» 40, 1994, pp. 109-124. The Homenc Hymns influence Latin litera- ture both before and after Vergil. M.

When Venus complains to Neptune of Juno's actions against Aeneas and his companions, she does not portray the conflict as between two goddesses, but between an immortal and mortals. Ve- nus' immediate rhetorical intent is dear. She underscores the plight of Aeneas by emphasizing the mismatch of goddess against mortai, much as Juno does in speaking of Venus' conquest of Dido at book 4.93 laudem et spolia ampia refertis / . . .una dolo divum sifemina vieta du- orum est. But unlike Juno, who goes on to flex her own divine power via matchmaking, Venus suppresses mention of the divine power she has used in the aid of Aeneas. She complains as the mother of a mortai, and makes nothing of her position as a goddess. As a resuit her words have a mortai tint to them, in contrast to her emphasis on the limitlessness of Juno's immortal anger. Venus' failure to em- phasize her own divinity is striking because she is in a distinctively divine exchange, a negotiation over thè fate of favored mortals. Venus stresses the divinity of Juno by emphasizing the limitless- ness of her anger. She begins with Iunonis gravis ira neque exsatura- bile pectus (5.781) and at 5.785-788 continues:1 non media de gente Phrygum exedisse nefandis urbem odiis satis est nec poenam traxe per omnem reliquias Troiae: cineres atque ossa peremptae insequitur. Venus collects other material to make the same point and so un- derscores Juno's divinity. Exsaturabile provides an écho of Saturnia, the name indicating Juno's divine parentage.2 Further, she is unaf- fected by the passage of time, quant [Juno] nec longa dies pietas nec mitigat ulla (5.783), time being the dimension in which immortals, because they do not âge, are distinctively unbounded. Venus also gives her a kind of parity with Jupiter and the fates: nec Iovis imperio fatisele infracta quiescit (5.784) Finally, the use of exedisse in 5.785 characterizes Juno and her hâte as a naturai force, an équation of- ten made between gods and thè naturai world, as is seen in the identification of Juno /Hera with aer.3 1 On the passage, see K. W. Gransden, Virgil's Riad, Cambridge 1976, pp. 73-74. 2 J. O'Hara, True Nantes, Ann Arbor 1996, pp. 68-69. O'Hara identifies the same etymological play at 5.606-608 and 7.297-298. See also R. Ο. A. M. Lyne, Words and the Poet, Oxford 1989, pp. 173-177. 3 There are multiple layers in this use of edo. The most obvious is its application</page><page sequence="12">52 Edward Gutting Venus takes care to identify Juno as a goddess in détail. At the same time, she contrasts the Trojans as woefully finite mortals. In so doing she suppresses her own divinity, and adopts in its place a mortai point of view. Quant nee longa dies pietas nec mitigat uüa (5783) takes the standpoint of Aeneas. The temporal concern of longa dits, particularly its implication that time brings closure, be- longs to thè mortai world. The référence to pietas is directly to Ae- neas' thoughts and actions, most pertinently his attempt to propiti- ate Juno at 3.547. Venus may not always accompany Aeneas in his wanderings, but she still knows what he has been doing. She then identifies with the Trojans as a whole in Unes 5.785-788, speaking strongly of the destruction of Troy even though she will occupy a more prominent and prestigious position in Rome, a future Jupiter has already shown her. This not only indicates a short-sightedness unsuitable to a purely immortal point of view, but also an over- identification with the Trojans. As a goddess, Venus should be de- lighted to be prominent in Rome rather than Troy. Troy may hâve had lofty walls and wide streets, but it hardly had Imperium sine fine. Moreover, Venus' importance in Troy is nothing compared to what it will be in Rome. Paris was a fine mortai favorite, but he is no Julius Caesar or Augustus. But Venus does not look ahead like a farsighted immortal, as best exemplified by Jupiter. She still dwells on the human sufferings of the Trojans. Moreover, she is very con- scious of how limited mortals are, as her référence to cineres atque ossa (5.787) makes clear. Having a mortai son does not allow Venus a purely divine perspective. Venus' speech also pointedly ignores her own divinity. She does not mention her miraculous birth from the sea, though this would be a powerful rhetorical point in her favor, and it is left to Neptune himself to point it out:^ts omne est, Cytherea, meis tefidere regnis, / unde genus duds (5.800-801). An even more striking avoidance of référence to her godhead cornes when she discusses the causas tanti to destruction through naturai forces (tll, edo, n.A.i.a.alpha.Roman numéral «I» circled) like Lucretius' «flammeus ardor horribili sonitu Silvas eserat altis a radicibus» (5.1253). At thè same time, «media de gente Phrygum» taps into the word's sensé of hollowing out, as seen at Georges 4.44, 4.419, and Aeneid 8.418. The word's primary sensé, that of eating, has no literal application hère, but echoes Riad 4.34 ff., where Zeus charges that Hera would not be satisfied even if she ate the Trojans raw, brings out that sensé to a degree.

Venus is dismissive of Juno's reasons, but Juno has strong motivation behind her furor, as Unes 1.23-28 show. Of thèse reasons, spretaeque iniust Juno on her own divine tunafor- mae refers to the Judgment of Paris, a glorious moment for Venus as the goddess of love. Not only was she declared the fairest of immortals, as befits her erotic numen, but she went on to beif. Venus' victory at the Judg- ment results in a triumph of erotic love over conjugal love when Paris seduces Helen away from Menelaus. The reasons behind Ju- no' s fiiror have everything to do with Venus* power and greatness as the goddess of love, but Venus déclines to speak of this - a sort of humility (however calculated) unexpected in an immortal. By thè end of her speech, it is no surprise that she speaks uncertainly of future fates, si concessa peto, si dant ea moenia Parcae (5.798). Jupi- ter has laid forth the long-term future of Rome for her, but Venus is concerned with a much more limited subject: thè immediate fate of Aeneas and his comrades. She forgoes the long-term privi- leged view of the immortals to promote her identification with her mortai son Aeneas. After all, the worries with which she began the speech was not concern for Rome's future greatness - that has already been promised in no uncertain terms. Safety for Aeneas, and amélioration for his suffering, are another matter. The same thèmes return in Venus* book 10 speech. She calls to mind her stake in the mortai world by référence to her wounding by Diomedes: equidem credo, mea vulnera restant / et tua progenies mortalia demororarma (10.29-30). The story stresses the tension be- tween Venus as goddess and as mother of a mortai. In Riad 5.311- 342, Aphrodite must come to the aid of Aeneas because Diomedes is about to kill him. Such concern with his mortality, however, forces her to betray her divine nature, which has no place on the battlefield. 1 Thus, the goddess of love finds herself in the middle of battle, where she cannot prevent Diomedes from wounding her. Venus hère expériences in a direct physical way thè Romene Hymn to Aphrodite s etymology of Aeneas from ainon achos. The pain of having a mortai son cornes not only from thè knowledge that he will die, but also from trying to ward off that death. Venus then sympathetically présents a mortai Trojan point of view: 1 As Athena sharply points out by focusing on Aphrodite 's erotic facets at Riad 5.420-425. It is interesting that Aphrodite abandons her maternai efforts on Aeneas' behalf without much résistance just before Athena depicts her as an erotic goddess.</page><page sequence="14">54 Edward Gutting si sine pace tua atque invito numine Troes Italiani petiere, luant peccata neque illos iuveris auxilio; sin tot responsa secuti quae superi manesque dabant, cur nunc tua quisquam vertere iussa potest aut cur nova condere fata? (Aenäd 10.31-35) She excludes her own divine knowledge in return for thè drama of presenting thè case from thè limited mortai perspective of thè Trojans. Venus knows as well as Jupiter what fate has decreed and how baseless her fears are. But thè concerns of thèse Unes are very real for anyone with thè limited viewpoint of a mortai. Aeneas in book 3 made clear how difficult it is for mortals to know thè will of thè gods and correctly follow their signs. Venus gives voice to this mortai perspective because it illustrâtes thè difficulties and suf- ferings of Aeneas and thè Trojans. This makes for good rhetoric because it elicits thè sympathies of her audience by portraying thè Trojans as helpless mortals plagued by thè power of an immortal. Her bias towards thè mortai perspective becomes ali thè stron- ger when she offers to forsake thè immortai concern for fate and history in exchange for solace as thè mother of a mortai. Liceat dimittere ab armis / incolumem Ascanium, liceat superesse nepotem ... magna dicione iubeto/ Karthago premat Ausoniam; nihil urbibus inde / obstabit Tynis (10.46-55). She will forfeit being Venus Genetrix to thè mistress of thè world so long as her mortai family is spared. Like Aphrodite in Riad 5, Venus appears willing to betray her divine na- ture for mortai concerns. l Venus also plays out thè tension between mortai and immortai concerns in thè way she contrasts Troy to Rome. Rome is to be im- mortai, Imperium sine fine, while thè death of Troy has made its lim- itations clear. Venus forsakes immortai for mortai throughout thè speech by asking to have Troy in piace of Rome . 2 She does not hedge about Troy 's mortality, per eversae, genitor, fumantia Troiae / excidia 1 Whether or not Venus is serious is another question. The speech is histrionic, and could be read as a rhetorical dive into thè deep end purely for effect. Whether or not this is true does not ultimately affect thè point at hand. What matters is that Venus can mine for her speech this kind of tension between her connections to thè mortai and immortal worlds. 2 Jenkyns (above, [n. 2 on p. 48]), pp. 587-589 on juxtaposition of Roman and Ital- ian with Trojan names in this passage, with pp. 393-396 for thè same in Jupiter's and Venus' book 1 encounter (1.223-295).</page><page sequence="15">Venus ' Maternity and Divinity in the Aeneid 55 obtestor (10.45-46). Indeed, her identification of Troy with mortality allows her to use it to revisit her book 5 axis of infinite /immortal vs finite /mortai with non satius cineres patriae insedisse supremos / atquesolum quo Troia fuit (10.59-60). Juno is immortal and unbound- ed in her appetite for revenge (non satius), l while her victims, Troy included, are limited in their existence. After Venus dismisses any claim to the immortal future of Rome by calling on Carthage to conquer Italy, she asks for Troy back again, along with ail the woe that such mortai things entail: Xanthum et Simoenta / redde, oro, miseris iterumque revolvere casus / da, pater, Iliacos Teucris (10.60-62). Thus, the contrary éléments of Venus' characterization continue well beyond book 1 of the Aeneid. In meetings with the other gods, the incongruity between her relation to thè mortai and immortal realms continues to express the tension of her rôles as a mother and goddess of love. Vergil has made this tension a powerful tool of characterization. Conclusion Through the tension between Venus' rôles, we see one of the ways in which the Aeneid accomplishes her characterization. She is a goddess, but her mortai son brings her into all too close contact with mortai concerns. The resulting conflict between mortai and immortal perspectives does much to define her. She fails to play fully the rôle of a mother because of the distance between her and Aeneas, a distance which her playing the erotic goddess has cre- ated. Yet she cannot fully act as such because she must deal with Aeneas as mother to son and give him direction and encourage- ment. The tension between the two rôles prevents us from rely- ing on either of them for an adequate explanation of Venus; each undercuts the other. Nor do the two rôles exist independently of each other, something which would allow a schizoid Venus who shifts persona according to thè demands of a given moment. Thus in the end, we see the Venus whom the poem présents as some- thing more than either rôle; she is a distinctive personality poised between contradictory considérations. We cannot simply speak of Venus as playing a goddess of love or the mother of a mortai. She is a peculiar, ill-fitting combination of both which we can only de- scribe through the unique term 'Venus'. University of Musissippi 1 Another etymological play on Saturnia.</page></plain_text>
