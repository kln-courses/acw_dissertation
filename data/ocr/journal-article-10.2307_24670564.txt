By Alan Appelbaum. (Judaism in Context 7). Piscataway (NJ): Gorgias Press, 2010. Pp. x, 341. Hardback. US$ 132.80. ISBN 978-1-61719-159-6. Appelbaum defends the thesis that the narratives of rabbinic king parables reflect historical events of the turbulent 3rd c. Roman Empire. Thus, A. revives Ziegler's historical reading of parables (1903). Ziegler's hypothesis that the rabbis were aware of the Roman court etiquette has been criticized, and A. is well aware of this. However, the basic intuition of Ziegler that parables as Active tales made use of realistic scenarios known to the rabbis and their audience guides this study as well. He covers the period starting with Septimius Severus (193 c.e.) until Diocle tianus' death in 285 c.e. A. proceeds by collecting parables in documents whose editing is dated to the 3rd or beginning of the 4th c. c.e., i.e., Mishna, Tosefta, and the halakic midrashim. This method validates Lieberman's view that rabbinic texts are historically most reliable on the editorial level. However, whether anonymous parables in these collections reflect a 3rd c. context and not, e.g., 2nd c. circum stances, remains a non-proven presupposition. His tool to detect 3rd c. parables in later documents is attribution to a 3rd c. rabbi. This common sense validation of attributions is based on the presumption that oral traditions are not leveled out or homogenized in the process of editing. A.'s argument that we also read Roman historians to learn about earlier periods is less convincing, since here the difference in genre is overlooked. Thus, A. has distilled 232 3rd c. King parables from among the thousand parables collected by Ziegler (he adds some overlooked by him). Most of these belong to the first two Amoraic generations. A. depicts 3rd c. rabbis as a group of elite city people who were awarded Roman citizenship with the Constitutio Antoniniana (212 c.e.), a view contested by scholars such as Mommsen and Alon. Moreover, he suspects that the name Arius/ Arios in Tannaitic sources may be a defective form of Aurelius. In his discussion of form patterns, A. shows some interesting cases where the nimshalnimshal augments and explains the parable, or where the relation to the parable appears as haphazard. This pleads for Stern's original view of the nimshal as not necessarily governing the parable. Unfortunately, the debate between Boyarin and Stern on this matter suffers from a lack of clarity and A. shares in this confusion; footnotes 210 and 229 offer contradictory reports. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012 DOI: 10.1163/157006312X644164</page><page sequence="2">Review Review of Books / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 43 (2012) 380-444 381 In ch. 4 A. comes with a surprising thesis, arguing that the king is not a "stand in" for God but should rather be seen as a literary device for exegetical purposes. This hypothesis also explains the dual title of this study that refers to parables and midrash alike. The argument is twofold. First, "contrast parables" oppose the behaviour of human kings with God. Second, some parables show behaviour that hardly reflects divine qualities. In one case the king recedes to the province to take vacation and leaves his matrona behind, not a conduct one would expect from God. A. goes against the current of extant scholarship here but his critique as well as his solution raises questions. First, the figure of a "stand in" presumes allegorical strategies which overstate the referential values inherent in a Bildfeld theory. Sec ond, parables operate with shock effects that disturb common expectations. Stern's explanation of the king figure as an "anthropomorphic paradox" still appears as theoretically more appealing. It may be noticed that a similar discussion on the king figure in synoptic parables has been initiated by Louise Schottroff, but her views are not shared by other scholars. A. is more successful in adducing material culture and imperial history to explain details. A parable of R. Abbahu {Exod. Rab. 23:1) mentions a king stand ing on the board where Augustus sits. This presumes knowledge of Roman art depicting a sitting king and a standing figure, interpreted by the rabbis as a king. Entering the scholarly discussion of the social setting of the parables as either originating in the synagogue or in the Academy, A. concludes that the consensus view here is probably correct and both origins can be argued for. Adducing the literary theories of Bhabha on colonial mimicry and Scott's con cept of a "hidden transcript," A. recurs to his historical reading and probes the parables on their inner resistance to Roman imperial power. His interesting obser vations here are put forward with caution. Most innovative is his reading of the parable narratives as reflective of Roman history. A. makes it plausible to read parables against the background of political turbulences in the eastern provinces. These parables present usurping characters, kings trying to suppress insurgencies and armies acclaiming their general Augustus, as in the aforementioned parable of the seated Caesar. A.A. s study is reflective of a methodological watershed in the study of rabbinic narratives. The scepticism, which denies these narratives historical value and instead relies on individual documents as reflective of all sorts of "Judaisms," is fading. A. succeeds in showing the necessity to employ Roman sources and mate rial culture to comment on details in the Active narratives. This approach should be extended to synoptic parables (king parables are discussed in an appendix) and 2nd c. rabbis. Thus, A.'s well written book shows promising ways for studying the mesmerizing literature called parables. Eric Ottenheijm Utrecht University</page></plain_text>
