<plain_text><page sequence="1">PEGGY KAMUF Monumental De-Facement: On Paul de Man's The Rhetoric of Romantic1im T HE JOURNAL in which this essay is destined to appear itself figures in The Rhetoric of Romanticism and not just in an inci- dental way. At the risk of great exaggeration, one can say that Com- parative Literature figures there as an origin of "comparative literary history as a whole" in America, which is said to proceed from the at- tempt to reunify the fractured concept of romanticism. One can say without any great exaggeration that in America, comparative liter- ary history as a whole has proceeded from the attempt to find an answer to the challenge posed by the philosopher and historian of ideas Arthur O. Lovejoy when, in 1924 in an essay "On the Discrimination of Romanticisms," he proposed quite simply to abandon the expression "romantic" since it was without meaning. The first issue of the journal Comparative Literature, which felt itself called upon to fill the shoes of the time-honored Revue de la Littdrature Comnparee, opened with a response to Lovejoy's challenge. That was in 1949.1 If there is exaggeration here, it concerns the claim that comparative literary history may be considered "as a whole," a unity or a distinct entity which can be circumscribed. Obviously, the "thing" called "com- parative literary history" is not itself circumscribable; it is only as a concept that it can be named as a whole and thus posed in some histori- cal or other relation. But one begins to suspect that the version de Man gives here of comparative literary history in America is designed pre- cisely to call attention to the error involved whenever the unity of a concept or a name is substituted for the "thing" designated. The error can be made to appear, for example, in the difference between the his- 1 Paul de Man, The Rhetoric of Romanticism (New York, 1983), pp. 48-49; hereafter cited in the text. 319</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE tory of comparative literature in America and the history of Compara- tive Literature in America. While there is certainly some relation be- tween the two, it would be an obvious error to take the latter to be the same thing as the former. Yet this is the error de Man seems to allow when he proposes that the starting point for comparative literary history in America can be said to coincide with the initial essay in the inaugural issue of Comparative Literature. Such an error cannot go unnoticed, which suggests that one object of the exercise may be to indicate the position or the imposition of error at the outset. And this it does by pointing to an essay that inaugurates Comparative Literature in Amer- ica. The essay, by Rene Wellek, is titled "The Concept of 'Romanticism' in Literary History." The Rhetoric of Romanticism proceeds as a deconstruction of the concept of romanticism. Rhetoric, the irreducible property of language to be always figurative, never proper, is here distinguished from the two domains that romantic poetry is thought to conjoin or unify: nature and imagination. The remarking of rhetoric, in the sense of a collection of tropes, goes counter to the systematic avoidance of figurative disrup- tions of unity that characterizes most interpretations of this poetry. This avoidance retains the symbol to mark the place of linguistic figuration, and thus privileges the trope that figures a continuity with the sym- bolized, an effacement or a transcendence of difference.2 Wellek's essay, for example, concludes by stressing the coherent integration of "a true symbolism" into romantic epistemology: There is ... a profound coherence and mutual implication between the romantic views of nature, imagination, and symbol. Without such a view of nature we could not believe in the significance of symbol and myth. Without symbol and myth the poet would lack the tools for the insight into reality which he claimed, and without such an epistemology, which believes in the creativity of the human mind, there would not be a living nature and a true symbolism. We may not accept this view of the world for ourselves-few of us can accept it literally today-but we should grant that it is coherent and integrated ...3 Whence comes this imperative to continue to grant that which one no longer believes ? In "the profound coherence . . . between the romantic views of nature, imagination, and symbol," another coherence would 2 In two essays not included in The Rhetoric of Romanticism, de Man goes to the authoritative references for this privilege of the symbol: the poetics of Cole- ridge in "The Rhetoric of Temporality" (Blindness and Insight: Essays in the Rhetoric of Contemporary Criticism, Second Edition, Rev. Minneapolis, 1983. Pp. 191-200) and the aesthetics of Hegel in "Sign and Symbol in Hegel's Aesthetics" (Critical Inquiry 8 [1982]: 761-775). In both cases, the privilege is found to be an unwarranted reading of texts which display a certain undecidability between symbol and other tropes. 3 Comparative Literature 1 (1949): 172; italics added.

The note of condescension that can be heard in the distinction of a literal belief "for ourselves" from an indulgent granting of the naive belief of another age betrays an anxious determination to comprehend a certain past while still keeping it at a distance. The imperative, then, is perhaps that we should continue to believe in the possibility of a literal language even if we must also admit that that possibility has passed away. "Romanticism" thus interpreted would constitute a monument to denegation: "a living nature and a true symbolism," its literality at once preserved and set aside, made to stand in the place of self-coherence and buried out of sight. To judge from its preface, The Rhetoric of Romanticism's decon- struction of the monument is not an operation carried out from a safe distance. While de Man notes that "the collection represents the main bulk of what I have written on romanticism" (p. vii), manifestly the continuity of his own signature is insufficient in his terms as a unifying principle. Rather than pointing to a coherence (as such prefaces most frequently do), these pages insist instead on the breakdown of the book's apparent unity. This is not a condition to contemplate compla- cently but more as one would "a somewhat melancholy spectacle." The phrase may remind one of the sense of theoria as a solemn procession, but one is also sent to the processional march that moves through the Triumph of Life and through what is perhaps the most moving and startling of all the essays in this volume: "Shelley Disfigured." Like Shelley's narrator who is always led "back to a new scene of question- ing," (p. 98) de Man passes his texts in review and comments: Such massive evidence of the failure to make the various individual readings coalesce is a somewhat melancholy spectacle. The fragmentary aspect of the whole is made more obvious still by the hypotactic manner that prevails in each of the essays taken in isolation, by the continued attempt, however ironized, to present a closed and linear argument. This apparent coherence within each essay is not matched by a corresponding coherence betzween them. Laid out diachronically in a roughly chronological sequence, they do not evolve in a manner that easily allows for dialectical progression or, ultimately, for historical totalization. Rather, it seems that they always start again from scratch and that their conclusions fail to add up to anything. If some secret principle of summation is at work here, I do not feel qualified to articulate it ... This principle will not be found in any claim made for a fragmentary style or form that, for others (Adorno and Auerbach are mentioned), has served to recuperate a unity on another level. "The apparent resig- nation to aphorism and parataxis is often an attempt to recuperate on the level of style what is lost on the level of history. By stating the in- evitability of fragmentation in a mode that is itself fragmented, one re- stores the aesthetic unity of manner and substance that may well be what 321</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE is in question in the historical study of romanticism" (p. ix). But as for himself, de Man writes that he feels "compelled to write as if a dialectical summation were possible beyond the breaks and interruptions that the readings disclose." Despite the confessional diction, this frustration con- forms to the disjunction between knowing and doing that de Man de- scribes as afflicting language use in general. Knowing what he knows, he should be the last "to write as if dialectical summation were possible." Yet writing's performance forgets what reading discloses, leaving one to confront again the ironic spectacle of one's own disjointed discourse on disjunction. In a sense that is developed in the essay "Autobiography As De- Facement," the self-reflective moments of the preface de-face The Rhet- oric of Romanticism by resisting the temptation to put a good face, as one says, on things. To put it quickly: instead of fitting them together and making a coherent or at least a pleasing whole, de Man sees his fea- tures decompose. He refuses to apply in his preface the two most preva- lent defenses against decomposition, defenses repeatedly unmasked in the essays that follow : historicization (the representation of a coherent relation between past and present) and aesthetification (the beautiful adequation between symbolic form and idea). In "Shelley Disfigured," published the same year as "Autobiography As De-Facement" (1979), de Man understands these two strategies of defense as forms of monu- mentalization. "For what we have done with the dead Shelley, and with all the other dead bodies that appear in romantic literature . . is simply to bury them, to bury them in their own texts made into epitaphs and monumental graves ... They have been transformed into historical and aesthetic objects" (p. 121). Together, the historical and aesthetic trans- formations have erected romanticism into a monument that stands as an aid not to memory but to forgetting. Thus subsumed, a text like Shelley's The Triumzph of Life cannot be read. Reading, for de Man, will thus have to be a kind of exhumation, certainly an unpleasant analogy. It can suggest, however, that if de Man is so difficult to read, then at least part of the reason should be sought in the reluctance to follow a gaze bent so intently on the disfigured features disclosed by reading. Before attempting to look more closely at some of these features, let us review the contents of The Rhetoric of Rolimanticisimi: ten essays, three of which are published for the first time. One of these, "Image and Emblem in Yeats," is a section from de Man's doctoral dissertation; the other two-"Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric" (on Baude- laire's "Correspondances" and "Obsession") and "Aesthetic Formaliza- tion: Kleist's (?ber das Marionettentheater"-are the most recent in- the collection, having been written for the volume. The other seven essays are gathered from various periods, publications, and languages; 322</page><page sequence="5">DE MAN'S RHETORIC OF ROMANTICISM two are presented for the first time in English translation ("The Image of Rousseau in the Poetry of H61derlin" translated by Andrzej War- minski, and "Wordsworth and H1lderlin" translated by Timothy Bahti). Wordsworth returns most frequently in these pages, supplying texts for "Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image" (along with Rousseau and H61derlin), "Wordsworth and H61derlin," "Autobiogra- phy As De-Facement" (on the Essays Upon Epitaphs), "Wordsworth and the Victorians" and "Symbolic Landscape in Wordsworth and Yeats." De Man's sustained preoccupation with Rousseau, which pro- duced the second half of Allegories of Reading, is still in evidence here, where both H6olderlin and Shelley are read as readers of Rousseau. But it is finally perhaps to the poetry of H olderlin that de Man returns most compulsively, calling it in his preface (in another moment that marks a failing or a falling) "the obvious stumbling block of my own enterprise" (p. ix). The figure of the stumbling block has a rather singular function in many of de Man's essays. It appears, so to speak, in its absence, wher- ever a reading manages to glide smoothly toward a resolution of the questions the text seems to raise about itself. The very ease with which reading assimilates or comprehends its object invariably leads de Man to suspect that a difficulty-a stumbling block-is being avoided, resisted, repressed. For example, in "Wordsworth and the Victorians," this sus- picion is attracted by the phenomenological interpretation of the poet, "a move to which Wordsworth's texts respond with almost suspicious docility" (p. 87). Once aroused, such suspicions should not be ignored: "The very alacrity with which Wordsworth's major texts respond to this approach should make one wary" (p. 88). The ease with which readers dispose of texts operates for de Man as a symptomatic indicator, a denegation. "The apparent ease with which readers of The Triumph of Life have been able to dispose of this challenge demonstrates the in- adequacy of our understanding of Shelley and, beyond him, of roman- ticism in general" (p. 121). Elsewhere, in an essay on Hegel's Lectures on Aesthetics not included here despite its obvious pertinence to the concerns of the volume, this reading procedure is recommended as the safest guide through a field littered with stumbling blocks: But in the craggy field of literary theory one should not be too easily satisfied with one's own satisfaction. Prudence is the main virtue of theoretical discipline, and prudence dictates suspicion when one feels too pleased with a methodological solu- tion. The alacrity with which one rushes, as by instinct, to the defense of aesthetic values indicates that the source of one's suspicion should be the compatibility of the aesthetic dimensions of literature with whatever it is that its theoretical in- vestigation discloses.4 4 "Sign and Symbol in Hegel's Aesthetics," op. cit., p. 762. 323</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE As this string of quotations suggests, de Man finds no easy way to read, only hard ones, no method that can guarantee a graceful naviga- tion around the stumbling blocks of theoretical disclosures, only prudent suspicion in the face of "one's own satisfaction" with method. Prudence, however, cannot anticipate or predict the pitfalls which the random factor of language, as gratuitous, unmotivated event or act, continues to imprint on even that most highly controlled discourse called literature. Literary theory, in its most prudent, rigorous and disciplined form, has thus to admit that it neither is nor can be a theory in the strict sense (a generalizable model that can predict occurrences within the field of its object). Systematic methodologies for reading have more or less sys- tematically continued to present themselves-and precisely at those points which have become most problematic in the conceptual field that governs understanding (reader response theory would be perhaps the best recent example); but the successful, repeatable, teachable inter- pretive performance promised by their methods-their ease of applica- tion-should provoke suspicion of an a priori term or system that is merely reproducing itself with little regard for the literary "thing." "It can be shown, however, that in all cases this success depends on the power of a system (philosophical, religious, or ideological) that may well remain implicit but determines an a priori conception of what is 'literary' by starting out from the premises of the system rather than from the literary thing itself.""5 To start out from the literary "thing," on the other hand, would be to turn the theoretical initiative over to the very "object" that is supposed to be in question. Relinquishing a certain priority over the literary work puts at risk the assurance of a control- lable systematicity of thought which has been upheld to no small degree by all the different versions of literature's secondarity, its servility. To "leave the initiative to words," in Mallarmi's phrase, is to risk undoing all the defensive structures that keep words in their place and put a good face-aesthetically pleasing or ideologically reconfirming-on the de- composition of the mind's work. The poets de Man reads in each of these essays remain challenges to interpretation precisely to the extent that words take the initiative in their poetry. The history of the interpretation of this poetry will neces- sarily be a history of evasions because, as de Man writes at the end of "Wordsworth and the Victorians," "it would be naive to believe that we could ever face Wordsworth, a poet of sheer language, outright" (p. 92). This assertion of the inevitability of evasion or turning aside in the face of "sheer language" follows upon a succinct dissection of the occur- rence of the word "face" in Book V of The Prelude. (In "Autobiog- 5 "The Resistance to Theory," Yale French Studies 63 (1982) : 5. 324</page><page sequence="7">DE MAN'S RHETORIC OF ROMANTICISM raphy As De-Facement" this facial operation continues on another part of Wordsworth's corpus.) Poetic knowledge would be the knowledge that there is no face-to-face possible with the totalizing surface of lan- guage, which cannot be circumscribed as an entity, and that all other forms of knowledge, of sense-making or face-making, depend on "a surface which it prohibits us from finding." Evasion seeks shelter from this predicament by giving the surface some relief-depth or content- a safe pocket within which to contain a knowledge of negativity. This is the sense of both Leslie Stephen's and Matthew Arnold's readings of Wordsworth, which were opposed on the question of whether or not one should take him seriously as a thinker. The former's conviction that such poetry "was not just 'a thing of beauty,' an object of aesthetic pleasure, but that it also had the power to console, to edify, and to protect from anxieties that threaten life and reason" (p. 85) was rejected by the latter's dismissal of Wordsworth as a moral guide. De Man reads this Victorian difference of opinion as a conjunction of de- fensive maneuvers: Arnold's instinct was not unsound, especially in making it apparent that Stephen's claim for Wordsworth's consoling power was less convincing than his6 awareness of the threat which these powers were supposed to console one from. The strategy of denegation which calls a threat a shelter in the hope of thus laying it to rest is all too familiar; Arnold was reacting in his own defensive manner to Stephen's defensive attempts at reassurance. 'Philosophy' is supposed to shelter us from something to which Wordsworth's poetry, unlike any other romantic poetry, gives access, although it remains unnamed and undefined. The effort of all subsequent Wordsworth interpreters has been, often with the poet's own assistance, to domesti- cate it by giving it at least a recognizable content. (italics added) One should not overlook the doubling over on itself that occurs in the last sentence of this passage; the very evasiveness that is being described also has to be assumed by this reading which, like any other, cannot face Wordsworth outright. Such doubled-over, self-deconstructive moments are explicitly marked in all de Man's later essays. Yet clearly the "effort" in question here goes directly counter to the domestication of a threat and, instead of giving it a recognizable content, disfigures the familiar almost beyond recognition. The figural displace- ments de Man traces through the several lines of The Prelude set out from the face of the Mother, more precisely her eye which, as de Man notes in two places, can already be read as displacing her breast ("the Babe/Nurs'd in his Mother's arms ... /Doth gather passion from his 6 His ? Whose? Stephen's, Arnold's, or Wordsworth's ? All three are possible. This is an example of the sort of undecidability in de Man's own syntax that Bar- bara Johnson has recently analyzed so acutely in "Rigorous Unreliability" (Criti- cal Inquiry 11 (1982) :278-285. 325</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Mother's eye !" or "who, with his soul/Drinks in the feelings of his Mother's eye !").7 There are few images as universally comforting or promising of shelter (or as domestic) as the one which these lines leave almost, but not quite, blank. De Man's gesture is to read the displace- ment upward-from breast to face-not as a sublimation but as a lin- guistic act that performs the subject: "Man can address and face other men, within life or beyond the grave, because he has a face, but he has a face only because he partakes of a mode of discourse that is neither entirely natural nor entirely human" (p. 90). A precise reading practice supports such assertions and justifies the resolute matter-of-factness, neither menacing nor reassuring, with which this practice disfigures the surface of expressivity. A stunning example of such disfiguration occurs in the reading of Baudelaire's sonnet "Correspondances." Perhaps the most commented- upon poem of Les Fleurs du mnal, "Correspondances," notes de Man, "has been made to answer a considerable number and variety of ques- tions ... In all cases, the poem has never failed to answer to the satisfac- tion of its questioner" (p. 244). This passe-partouzt compatibility of the poem with such a variety of interpretive preoccupations may be ex- plained by the thematic of analogical substitution-or "correspondance" -whose telos is "the unified system 'esprit/sens,' the seamless articula- tion, by ways of language, of sensory and aesthetic experience with the intellectual assurance of affirmation" (italics added). The seeming seamlessness of the articulation between the two senses of sense has had the effect of distracting attention from the poem's obvious stitch marks and from a syntax that cannot at every point dissimulate a rupture incompatible with the poem's supposed meaning. Unnoticed by all the poem's previous commentators, just such a rupture occurs in the lines surrounding the final use of the word "comme," which up to this point has carried the burden of the analogical shuttling between registers. In the last tercet, however, the univocal functioning of the "comme" is overcome by a syntactic ambiguity: its analogical function is doubled by the incompatible function of exemplification or enumeration. This supplementary syntactical possibility produces, instead of a comparison between different terms on which depends the movement from sense to sense, a tautological repetition that goes nowhere: "Ii est des parfums ... /Comme [des parfums] ." At this moment (and de Man signals that it is "the crucial moment when the poem promises ... to reconcile the pleasures of the mind with those of the senses and to unite aesthetics with epistemology," p. 250), it is as if a heretofore docile, self-effacing 7 For a reading of such figurations of the maternal face which takes up the psychoanalytic implications that de Man set aside, see Neil Hertz's superb "After- word" to his The End of the Line (New York, 1985), especially pp. 230-239. 326</page><page sequence="9">DE MAN'S RHETORIC OF ROMANTICISM syntax suddenly balked at the prospect of its own imminent transcen- dence by the sheer powers of mind united in a seamless immediacy with sensory experience (but it is also precisely the "as if" of such an anthropomorphizing description that has been undercut). Instead of a transfer into the transcendent realm of "les choses infinies," the syntax begins to turn around sheer repetitive number; instead of a smooth articulation between registers, a mechanical stutter intervenes when "enumerative repetition disrupts the chain of tropological substitution." Left to themselves, words show a contrary tendency to renege on the totalization promised by metaphor and to put off the reconciliation of "the pleasures of the mind with those of the senses" which is presumed possible by an aesthetic ideology of interpretation. Such disruptive or defacing acts cannot easily be attributed to a de- liberate intentionality because what is at issue is the very possibility of making language submit to intention. While an anthropomorphic inter- pretation moves to override the other possibility and the possibility of other-ness, disfigurative reading gives it its chance. Baudelaire's final "comme," by doubling back on itself, leads de Man to observe: "That the very word on which these substitutions depend would just then lose its syntactical and semantic univocity is too striking a coincidence not to be, like pure chance, beyond the control of author and reader" (p. 250). Note the conjunction here of "author and reader." While at first it might seem that a common-sense distinction is being invoked, nothing could in fact be less certain than the grounds of this distinction once it is conceded that texts are "out of our hands" to the extent that they resist such anthropomorphic descriptions of their functioning. "Authorship" would be only the defensive name of a relation to language, a name which covers up its essential inseparability from the supposedly second- ary activity of reading. Or, put another way, "authorship" is a concept that protects reading from the knowledge of an essential impossibility of understanding. Elsewhere, de Man has written that "writing can just as well be considered the linguistic correlative of the inability to read. We write in order to forget our foreknowledge of the total opacity of words and things or, perhaps worse, because we do not know whether things have or do not have to be understood."8 The "problematization of reading conceived as the determination of meaning" (p. 273) would be somewhere near the source of the difficulty posed by reading de Man. His essays activate the condition of a double bind by insisting on our inescapable situation as readers of what is finally unreadable. The singular force of de Man's thought remains in S Allegories of Reading: Figural Language in Rousseau, Nietzsche, Rilke and Proust (New Haven, 1979), p. 203. 327</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE the ability to encounter repeatedly "the inability to read" without erect- ing this repetition into a system or method of reading. If indeed, as one reader has remarked, one has both "the feeling beforehand that one knows what de Man will do" and "a reluctant but solid conviction that one could not duplicate [his performance],", is it not because de Man is always starting again "from scratch," as he puts it? That is, from the literary "thing" that alone can give rise to theory ? Miami University 9 Wlad Godzich, Introduction to Blindness and Insight, op cit., pp. xv-xvi. 328</page></plain_text>
