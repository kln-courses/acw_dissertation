Transnational in scope and transdisciplinary in orientation, the jour- nal strives to spark and galvanize intellectual debates as well as to attract and foster critical investigations regarding any aspect of culture as it expresses itself in words, images, and sounds, across both time and space. The journal is especially keen to support scholarship that engages the ways in which cultural production, cultural practices, and cultural forms constitute and manifest the nexus between the aesthetic, the psychic, the economic, the political, and the ethical intended in their widest senses. While informed by the diverse traditions of histor- ical materialism as well as by the numerous critiques of such traditions from various parts of the globe, the journal welcomes contributions based on a variety of theoretical and methodological paradigms. Cultural Critique appears three times a year. General issues, includ- ing essays, book reviews, and thematic sections, as well as entire issues devoted to special topics, are regularly published. The editors welcome the submission of freestanding essays, special issue proposals on top- ics of interest to the journal, as well as reviews of relevant, new, and not-so-new books. Cultural Critique Books is the companion series of the journal. It seeks to attract work by those scholars across the humanities and social sciences who continue to draw inspiration from, and seek to con- tribute to, the theoretical movements and debates so long nurtured at Minnesota. Book proposals should be addressed to one of the three editors at: Cultural Critique,Department of Cultural Studies and Com- parative Literature, 235 Nicholson Hall, 216 Pillsbury Drive S.E., Uni- versity of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, U.S.A., or via email to cultcrit@umn.edu.
