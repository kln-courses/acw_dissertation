<plain_text><page sequence="1">COLLABORATIVE TEACHING TECHNIQUES IN PHILOSOPHY C. B. Weber* o ne of the main goals of the general education movement is the establish ment of relationships between conven tionally compartmentalized subject fields. In turn, these relationships are founded on the assumption that a logic other than the logic of the subject matter of a specific field obtains. For years in collegiate education in the United States various courses in phi losophy have been offered as part of the undergraduate liberal arts program. The avowed intent of such courses is to afford students a portion of the back ground most frequently designated as that of a "liberally" or "generally" edu cated man. The sad fact remains, how ever, that the unquestioned nobility and desirability of the intent is by no means automatically father to its realization. Students within both my range of per sonal experience and that of my fellow educators have made that fact amply clear. The particular philosophy course which is the root of my concern is a two-semester history of Western philoso phy offered in the sophomore year. Most colleges and universities in the United States have a comparable course; it is as traditional as the belief that people should attend institutions of higher learning for at least four years before being awarded the Bachelors degree. Several years ago, when the then instruc tor of philosophy retired at the College of Marin, I inherited his survey course. After the first year I became acutely * Mr. Weber is Instructor in Philosophy at the College of Marin at Kentfield, California. aware of a vague but persistent discon tent on my part. My unhappiness was doubtless heterodox, for all the stand ard greats of Western philosophy, start ing with Tha?es and ending more or less with Kant, had been mentioned, and the standard few had been discussed with some attempt at thoroughness. Still, at the end of each semester, I sensed that the students were not really getting what the course was supposed to give them. These misgivings were reinforced by more than several articulate ex-mem bers of my classes, who declared that they had wondered what the purpose of philosophy was and that they had come to the conclusion it had none. Even after making a generous allowance for the possibility of my own professional in eptitude, the fact remained that that kind of criticism should not have been forthcoming if the conventional struc ture of the course were sound. That some of the implications of Cartesian dualism had not been probed, I grant; that Spinoza's dictum about the ultimate intelligibility of nature had been ex plained in a less than intelligible man ner, yes; but not that philosophy is point less, an irrational species of academic dilettantism. What was wrong, then, with the his torical approach? Why, if there were a direction and a purpose in Western phi losophy as presented in a course using such an approach, were students?sin cere, thoughtful students?not able to perceive them? It seemed to me that a re-examination of the basic assumptions of the historical approach was in order. Certainly, one of the chief assump 120</page><page sequence="2">COLLABORATIVE TEACHING TECHNIQUES 121 tions is that the history of Western phi losophy has a structure, a series of pat terns. Thus one may trace in a certain segment of Western thought a move ment from Minoan animism through Olympian anthropomorphism to pre-So cratic rationalism. Later one might trace another manifestation of the same sort of pattern in the current of thought which began with the Church Fathers, gained volume and placidity of direction during the age of scholasticism, and rose to a towering, fluid wall with British empiricism. At this point the teacher of a course in the history of philosophy?if he were a "good" one?would observe that both these movements were charac terized by a prehminary stage of grop ing, of using primitive tools, followed by an intermediate stage of refining and in tellectualizing of these tools, in turn capped by a period during which these tools were used predominantly. Now such a teacher would be "good" in the sense that he would have demonstrated the validity of one of the main assumptions of his course: Western philosophy is cyclical, with its cycles differing in de tails but not in general configuration. Such an approach, then, is excellent as far as it goes; but experience seems to indicate that it does not go far enough, though, apparently, teachers of philoso phy frequently suppose that the peda gogical Ultima Th?le has been reached when this approach has been employed. Unfortunately, for the alert student, re vealing the structure of philosophy is not synonymous with revealing its effects. And it is precisely in this regard that the traditional undergraduate history of philosophy course is most feckless. To maintain, in our modern technological, practical-minded society, that the spirit of philosophy can be communicated by baring its skeleton, however systemati cally, is to be guilty of passion unattend ed by wisdom?indeed, is to be unphil osophical about philosophy. Once again, it is this discrepancy between the alleged importance of philosophy and the ob vious failure of many teachers of phi losophy to impress their students with that importance which provides me with some of my most serious misgivings. Another basic assumption which seems in need of reappraisal is that what might be called the "all-inclusive approach" is necessary. The articulate proponents and unconscious practitioners of this ap proach are, of course, often the same persons who lay open the patterns to be discerned in the structure of Western philosophy in the manner described. This approach is often characterized by the conviction that an introductory course is best taught by a subject-matter specialist, who handles the course as if all or most of the students are going to major in philosophy. Once the assump tion is made that a primary purpose of a sophomore philosophy course is to en able the student to apprehend the "struc ture" of philosophy, this conviction fol lows almost as an inevitable corollary. If one is to major in a subject, he must somehow become cognizant of the ra tionale of that subject. This, in conse quence, entails his knowing as many of the philosophers, major and minor, as time will allow. Plato must be preceded not only by Socrates but by Hippias and Prodicus and followed not only by Aris totle but by Plotinus. The student must likewise learn all the concomitant ter minology that can possibly be crowded in: idealism, moral relativism, teleology, sophism, mystical empathy. The logic of the approach is irrefragable because it is dictated by the logic of the subject matter. The goal toward which both the ap proaches we have examined are directed is the disciplining of the student's mind, training the student to acquire the phil osophic attitude, encouraging him to move from specifics to generalizations tentatively held because the materials of philosophy demand constant re-examina tion and resynthesis. However, the scru</page><page sequence="3">122 JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION tiny to which we have subjected the two approaches reveals one very important fact: both approaches are the result of the insights of the philosophic mind, but the evidence afforded us by stu dents in undergraduate survey philoso phy courses indicates that the philosoph ic mind cannot, with any appreciable degree of certainty, be acquired by ex posure to these approaches. In short, bor rowing from one of Hume's most famous observations, we are entitled to the con structs we wish to impose upon our ex perience, but we have no rational right to expect others to erect the same con structs in regard to the "same" experi ence. It would seem, then, that the teachers of philosophy, in so far as they them selves are really philosophers, became such either because of a process of which they are conscious but which they do not put to use in their courses or be cause of a process of which they are not consciously aware and which, therefore, they cannot employ in their courses. So long as this process remains hidden from the thoughtful student, he is being asked to be thoughtful about nothing or, what is better only because it is more substan tial, about the wrong thing. Philosophy as a distillate of insights is quite dif ferent from the juxtaposition of specifics which gave rise to those insights. The point which I wish to restate at this juncture is that in the traditional sopho more history-of-philosophy course the juxtaposition of specifics is seldom at tempted, and to ask the student to attend to philosophic insights which are mere ly the superficies of underlying par ticulars is to beseech him to be super ficially philosophical, and this?bless his heart!?the thoughtful student, with his integrity of intelligence, obstinately re fuses to be. This attempt becomes almost criminal when we recall that, for most of the students in such a course, this course is their last formal contact with philosophy. If the course exists in the curriculum of most liberal arts colleges and of most colleges of letters and sci ence within universities as part of edu cators' attempts to educate their students liberally or generally, what can be done to make such a course more nearly achieve this purpose? At this point I would like to refer to some actual teaching procedures with which another instructor and I at the College of Marin have experimented in the hope of accomplishing to some de gree that goal, which, if not achieved, frustrates the achievement of ancillary goals in the type of philosophy course we have been discussing. One of our art instructors, who has been interested in the objectives of general education and has tried working toward them in his own courses, volunteered to work with me in devising ways of making clear to stu dents the kinds of relationships which obtain between philosophy and art. We thought that our main stress should be on the manifestations of philosophic trends in painting, since this art form seemed to be the one to which students responded most quickly and most fully. I should like to elaborate on two of the periods during the philosophy course when this instructor and I collaborated in selecting materials which would dem onstrate the kind of ramifications that we considered crucial to an understand ing of philosophy. For the first period we spent several sessions selecting slide and opaque projector material which would reveal the manifestations in painting of the philosophic shift from the medieval, otherworldly, Scholastic view to the hu manistic, this-worldly view of the Ren aissance. We started with works like Simone Martini's "The Annunciation" and Duccio di Buoninsegna's "The Marys at the Tomb," luminous with the artist's desire to capture graphically a religious lesson that could thus be transmitted to people who were, for the most part, illit erate. The lack of psychological insight ?or? at least, the failure to project such</page><page sequence="4">COLLABORATIVE TEACHING TECHNIQUES 123 insight into painting?was obvious in these typical works; this lack, in turn, pretty clearly implied the emphasis of medieval Christendom on the de-drama tized Augustinian concept of "the drama of salvation." When actually presenting this material, the art instructor elabo rated on such details as the golden back ground of Buoninsegna's work and the stereotyped, elongated faces of the fig ures in the Martini masterpiece, which, through their avoidance of coming to grips with the particulars of life-experi ence, proclaimed the medieval commit ment to the enduring of earthly existence as a prelude to eternal happiness in an other life. In such works of Giotto as "The Flight into Egypt" and "The Meet ing of Joachim and Anna," by the appear ance in the first of rocks and trees in the background, with an accompanying angel, although the perspective is na?ve; and in the second by the absolutely un medieval and creative touch of the dra matic, humanistic background of the black-robed maid, who had taunted Anna about her sterility, being ridiculed by her fellow-attendants?in such works we found excellent material which ob jectified the trend recently discussed in an abstract manner in preceding classes of the philosophy course. The essentially transitional nature of Giotto's work was indicated by a discus sion of the tendency toward the formal ized, monotonous, somewhat Byzantine facial expressions in the two paintings just referred to which had also appeared in the Martini and Duccio di Buonin segna paintings. The fairly complete change from the Byzantine, medieval style of painting to the realistic-humanis tic, which developed rapidly during the early Renaissance, was next dealt with as revealed in works like .Masaccio's "The Expulsion of Adam and Eve," with its superb projection of the nude in the round and its grasp of basic human emotions. Gone are the pictorial moral lessons and the devitalized religiosity; in their stead, we find philosophic convic tion and psychological perception. To these points the students reacted various ly and often perspicaciously; but the im portant fact in terms of our present con cern is that they reacted. As we moved into the onrush of the Renaissance in the work of Fra Filippo Lippi, with its exquisitely poetic back grounds; of Antonio Pollaiuolo, with its meticulously, yet miraculously, construct ed landscapes; of Botticelli, with its mar velous control of line and movement, the humanism of the period became even more clearly exemplified. The range of pictorial matter increased enormously, no longer being restricted chiefly to reli gious themes. When we had reached the peak of the Renaissance in the creations of Titian, Tintoretto, Raphael, Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Veronese, Giorgione, the shift in philosophic thinking evinced in the readings from Erasmus' Praise of Folly, Galileo's Dialogues concerning Two New Sciences, and Sir Francis Bacon's Novum Organum became patent beyond escape. In the presentation of this visual mate rial, the art instructor and I operated as collaborators. He would indicate and elaborate upon certain aesthetic and artistic aspects, and I, where I saw fit, injected a comment about certain phil osophic concepts which related to the material at hand. Often the students themselves made observations, raised questions, and established relationships, during the course of the presentation. Much the same kind of collabora tive preparation and presentation was re quired for a later session. During this class period, one of the last in the course, we endeavored to demonstrate primarily the repercussions of British empiricism in the painting of various British mas ters. It so happened that many of the students had established a prior famili arity with the literary manifestations of this same philosophic movement, as ex pressed in the neoclassical period of Ad</page><page sequence="5">124 JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION dison and Steele, Pope, Dryden, and a host of minor luminaries. Our use of visual material in this particular situa tion served, therefore, rather to intensify and broaden than to initiate the students' awarenesses. The empirical emphasis on determining the limits of human knowl edge, on establishing the reasonable per mutations of sense data as given, on em ploying the rational elements embodied in experience and deprecating the emo tional and the imaginative, could cer tainly be found in the Essay on Man or the Spectator. We hoped that it was no less discoverable in the boisterous real ism of Hogarth's "The Shrimp Girl" and the eight scenes of "The Rake's Prog ress," the inspired earthiness of Joshua Reynolds' "Dr. Johnson," the controlled enthusiasm of Gainsborough's "The Hon orable Mrs. Graham," the reserved affec tion of Sir Henry Raeburn's "The Drum mond Children." Supplementary references in previous philosophy discussion periods had been made to the deistic ideas of Voltaire and the atheistic and materialistic convic tions of Holbach, particularly as ex pressed in his System of Nature and Common Sense. The thinking of these men who, on the Continent, were ap proximately contemporaneous with the British empiricists proved interesting. Voltaire's reliance on reason as the in strument by which religion could be proved validly meaningful and Hol bach's categorical denial that religion of any sort could withstand the onslaughts of common-sense, rational inquiry mir rored the same engrossment with the interpretive possibilities of human ex perience as did the considerations of their British brethren. This philosophic kinship was illustrated by some of the still lifes of Jean Baptiste Chardin; by the "Storming the Citadel" of Fragonard, which, even in its depiction of the fashionable frivolity of the court of Louis XVI, makes sense; by the pure, dispassionate draftsmanship of David in such a work as the portrait of Mile. Charlotte du Val d'Ognes, and, in cul mination, by the picture of Mme. Ri vi?re painted by Ingres, devoid of sen timentality or prettification, a cool, poised, aesthetic achievement. In addition to these main benefits to the students which have been outlined in this paper, the chief incidental bene fit to be derived from using these col laborative techniques seemed to be that illumination was cast not only upon cru cial insights in philosophy but also upon the bases of art in general and painting in particular. Too frequently, students "appreciate" art; they do not understand it. The art instructor and I found that the numerous cross-references we were forced to make to each others field brought about a kind of cross-fertiliza tion of students' ideas in our respective areas, almost in spite of ourselves. Espe cially heartening was the students' reali zation that a great painting is not some thing fortuitous, accomplished by a blind stroke of luck or mystical concat enation of circumstances. Thus the un derstanding was born that art premises an art form, a structure, and that through his discernment of this structure a per son can evaluate the artist's work in terms of conception versus execution. The visual approach we had employed in our pedagogical partnership also un derlined tangible evidence for the gen eralizations we had been accustomed merely to offer ready-made, in both the art and the philosophy courses. There has been much scorn addressed to the belief that areas as sacrosanctly ab stract as philosophy and art should be pinned down by anything as mundane as a tangible manifestation of their oper ative energy. Perhaps John Dewey's gen eral point of view in Reconstruction in Philosophy is more seminal than has been usually conceded: We must not forget that the abstract is but the reverse side of the coin bearing on its obverse face the concrete and the actual. Our</page><page sequence="6">COLLABORATIVE TEACHING TECHNIQUES 125 lament for the student who is not liberal ly or generally educated is often a mis placed elegy; we should really be wail ing at the biers of his teachers. There seems to be no reason why the abstract should have the moat of its inviolability threatened if the assertion is made that it rests upon experiential particulars. In deed, the abstract becomes the object of the worst type of profitless cogitation when it is hypostatized into a kind of superreality, somewhat echoing, in its re lation to the specific, the forms of Pla tonic idealism. There are signs upon the collegiate horizon that promise further experimen tation with the type of collaborative techniques described in this article. But they are still tentative and sparse. The standard undergraduate philosophy course persists in the traditional form and with the traditional goals. However, the ever changing ingredients, the par ticular life-experiences which provoked philosophy into existence and which con tinue to sustain it, and the importunate thoughtfulness of large numbers of stu dents cannot be ignored much longer. The primary purpose of an undergradu ate philosophy course cannot be left as that of teaching the student the history of philosophy; it must become, instead, teaching the student that philosophy has a history because men have philoso phized?and, to philosophize, as Profes sor Brand Blanshard of Yale has put it, "is to try to understand; to understand is to explain to oneself; to explain is to relate."</page></plain_text>
