Beginning from the observation that the word 'monotheism' was coined in 1660, this subtle, thought-provoking book explores the tense relationship between that concept and the process of narration in Milton's major poetical works. Stoll's contention is that</page><page sequence="2">820 REVIEWS seventeenth-century elaborations of the idea of monotheism pushed God into a position of abstraction, even 'erasure' - what he terms 'an extreme minimalism in representation and ontology' (p. 9). The endpoint of this was so-called 'aniconism', the recognition that there is in God (properly conceived) a 'total absence of representability', an abstract blankness which defies anthropomorphism. Yet the medium through which the Judaeo-Christian revelation has traditionally presented its deity is narrative, and because the 'praxis of narrative' demands some degree of personification, its methods in fact compromise (or at least interrupt) the abstractions of monotheism (p. 14). It is in terms of this structural bind that Stoll argues we should make sense of Milton's presentation of God; and in so con- tending he offers an innovative alternative to the familiar dichotomy which claims either that Milton has an Arian cum Socinian dimension (Kelley) or that he is an orthodox Trinitarian (Patrides et al.). Such is Milton and Monotheism's main contention, but the book develops, besides, a subsidiary thesis. Stoll suggests that an examination of Milton's works framed in the terms he advocates also accounts for the contested place which Milton assumed within the history of deism. The first strand of this argument is developed through four principal case studies. Stoll begins by setting the catalogue of devils in Paradise Lost Book Î¹ against earlier discussions regarding the probity of representing pagan deities within Christian epic (Seiden, Davenant, etc.). Cowley, for example, writing in Davideis, capitalises upon the imaginative force of such gods by evoking them as real presences within the body of his poem, but he then neutralises that threat to monotheism by adding numerous footnotes which re- present these idols in historicised terms, as primitive fictions. Milton, Stoll argues, manages to integrate both these functions into Book i's verse (with no need of footnotes). As an exercise in literary genealogy, this account of the Miltonic catalogue's origins is compelling, but one might question Stoll's further claim that 'imaginatively . . . the catalogue feels like polytheism' (such that the poem's narration stands at odds with its monotheistic doctrine (p. 31)). More persuasive, to my mind, are Stoll's subsequent examples of structural tensions embedded within the Miltonic narrative. The next case study centres around the argument that, rather than choosing between Empson's Olympian God (with his pronounced personality) and Danielson's beacon of abstract justice, we should regard the presence of both these things as a structural necessity in a text poised between narration and monotheism. Book in presents God as the principle of equitable justice, but the Father is also presented as participating in an intimate, challen- ging dialogue with Christ, one which rescues God's will from being merely automatic or impersonal. Similarly, Stoll sets Adam's Book vm effort to conceive of God in his oneness (an effort framed as a series of abstract, negative definitions) against Raphael's emphasis on the doctrine of accommodation, a doctrine which (for example, in ascribing emotions to God) lends narrative personality to divine beings. Stoll's third case study focuses on the war in Heaven: both the oddity that Abdiel's effort to bring news of Satan's rebellion is rendered defunct by divine omniscience, and the further absurdity, emphasised in the poem, that Heaven's conflict could be resolved by God at any moment were he to exercise his omnipotence. The war narrative serves to provide a pretext, an occasion, for revealing divine omnipotence, yet at the same time jolts of bathos (such as the angels' suddenly healing their own wounds) deny the significance of that narrative. Such denials 'speak forcefully' of God's monotheism and its resistance to being meaningfully captured within any story (p. 152). The book's fourth case study, concerning the status of Christ, follows from this third concern. Stoll positions Milton as an anti-Trinitarian with a subordinationist view of Christ's relationship to God, yet also as a believer in Christ's pre-incarnate existence. Whereas Fowler hints that such equivocation</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 821 amounts to prudent trimming, Stoll argues that it is precisely Christ's liminality which equips him to mediate between the poetry's twin poles of narration and abstract monothe- ism. The preincarnate Son is more readily 'narratable' than God: his 'begetting' triggers a plot (the angel's rebellion); he provides the medium for drawing God into dialogue; and he 'stands in for the utterly abstract Father [whenever] it comes time to act' (pp. 225-7). Most strikingly, although it is said to be God who effects the Creation, it is nonetheless the Son who returns to Heaven once that job is done, an ontological instability, Stoll maintains, in which one can discern 'negotiations typical of monotheistic narrative' (p. 228). Stoll's interest in deism follows from that last point. He argues that the poem's exposure of the dynamics of monotheism encourages deistic readings. On the one hand, the abstract God of Book in anticipates the abstract deity - a kind of rational principle - favoured by the deists. On the other hand, Paradise Lost* s epic machinery, its angels and devils, is seen by some eighteenth-century readers as destroying the sense of mystery which should surround God (and which constitutes a principal defence against deism), or simply as encouraging deistic scepticism by giving critically-minded readers a superstructure to attack. One should, though, add a qualification to Stoll's argument here. Whilst he is doubtless right that a wish to resist deistic appropriations of Milton was one factor which propelled John Dennis to emphasise Paradise Los f s sublimity (p. 181), another imperative, too, certainly shaped Dennis's interpretation of that work. Dennis's figuring of the passions as a fiery vehicle which transports us heavenwards is not just a common metaphor for angels (p. 175); this connecting of the passions' power to Elijah's chariot also alludes to Henry More's use of the same association in his Enchiridion Ethicum. What that work shares with Dennis's is a conviction as to the moral importance of the emotions, a conviction fuelled in Dennis's case by an acquaintance with Augustine's De Civitate Dei which emphasised that passions informed by a charitable spirit were essential to man's moral life. This same ethic shapes Milton's depiction of human nature in prelapsarian Eden, as Turner and others have shown. If Dennis looks to Milton for examples of holy affections and sublime passion, it is largely because he valued such things as ideals in their own right, and only secondarily because such sublimity could provide a bulwark against the march of deism. This is to quibble though. In truth, persuasive, admirably nuanced judgements are the hallmark of this monograph, a book which develops a sophisticated, compelling thesis even whilst never losing sight of textual details. Stoll's foremost virtue is his refusal to resolve tensions within Milton's work; his insistence, rather, on describing carefully poised subtle- ties integral to the structure underlying this poet's portrayal of God. Perhaps the reader is left wishing for more comment on the early religious verse - the 'Nativity' ode's 'trinai unity', 'At a Solemn Music's' vision of 'perfect diapason' with God - but if so, that sense of want serves only to underline the more this book's great value as a stimulus to further thought.
