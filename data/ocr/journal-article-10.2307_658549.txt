<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST VoL. X WASHINGTON, D. C., MAY, 1897 No. 5 MORPHOLOGY OF TUSAYAN ALTARS J. WALTER FEWKES The word morphology has been appropriated by naturalists, and, as generally defined, is limited to comparative studies of the modifications in structure of animals and plants. In the pages which follow I shall use this term, perhaps inadvisedly, with a different application, preserving its strict etymological meaning, as a science of forms. In one sense the anthropologist, as well as the biologist, has morphological problems to solve, and it is my purpose to indi- cate the nature of one of these as applied to an obscure branch of our science. The title of my article might perhaps more hap- pily have been worded "A Comparison of a Few Tusayan Altars Chosen from Different Ceremnonies " to illustrate a similarity in type or plan. The present examination is an attempt to dis- cover firom the symbolism of Tusayan altars the dominating elements of the ritual, or to trace the common strands which con- nect rites, myths, and religious paraphernalia. I shall attempt to show that although many altars appear to vary very greatly in form, in reality their resemblances are very close, and that two conceptions dominate all others in their symbolism. These two elements are thought to result from climatic conditions, great aridity, and uncertainty of crops, acting on the mind of an agri- cultural people, whose greatest desires, which among all people determine the character of their rituals, are that their corn may sprout and grow to maturity, and that rain will water their farms. The ceremonials of the Hopi are made up of rites to influence 17 (129)</page><page sequence="2">130 THE AM1ERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. X supernatural beings who control these processes, and it remains to be shown that the character of the altars reflect the same through their symbolism. While my present analysis is not comprehensive, and fails to include all Tusayan altars, it considers at least two groups, one of which is known as the Katcinas,' the other chosen from a number of ceremonials of societies unrelated to this division. That phase of ancestor worship called the Katcina cult con- trols fully one-half the Tusayan ritual, beginning with January or February and lasting until July, inclusive. It is distinguished from other components by the presence of masked participants, called Katcinas, which are deified spirits of ancestors. The yearly departure of these worthies from the villages is celebrated in July by a great ceremonial called the Nimnb Katcina; their arrival, by several rites, one of the most striking of which is called Pow~cbai or " Bean Planlting." At the times of their arrival and departure there is erected in each of the five villages which cele- brate them an altar about which certain secret rites are performed. Our knowledge thus far is limited to three2 of the five Nimnr Katcina altars, and there still remain two, those of Oraibi and Cufiopavi, regarding which nothing has yet been recorded." I have been interested to discover what proportion of the whole number of ceremonials in Tusayan have been described, and the results are such as to allay any conceit that we know much about the subject. Without considering abbreviated ceremonials, there are twelve in the Tusayan ritual which are of nine days' dura- tion. Thlere are five variants of this ritual, differing in altars, paraphernalia, and rites, so that we may say there are lperformed in Tusayan about sixty ceremonials, each nine days long, to be 1 The Katcinas have nothing to do with the following, among other, ceremonials in Tusayan : Snake Dance.

Their great ceremonials are PowamanC, Paltlikoftti, and Nimdn Katcina, and they have many abbreviated dances every summer, as I have described in vol. i of Journ. Amer. Eth. and Arch. The Sitcomovi Calako must be ranked among the great Katcina exhi- bitions on the East Mesa. It is possible that Soyaluia may also be found to belong to this group, but from the little I now know of this obscure ceremony I judge that it commemorates the return of the sun, as elsewhere indicated. 2 Journ.

Of these, there are forty of which we know noth- ing save their existence; fifteen, fragments of which have been described, and five which have been fairly well studied. There are about thirty altars which have never been figured or, so far as I know, seen by ethnologists. It thus appears that there is plenty of material in this province to occupy students of primi- tive ritual for some time to come. It can hardly be expected, however, that descriptions of the modifications of the altars of the same societies in different vil- lages will materially change the types which we are able to con- struct from those which are known. Modifications will doubt- less be found, but no radical differences. Variations are to be expected, but experience has taught that fundamentally all Antelope altars are the same, and all Katcina altars are made in a typical form, while all Flute altars are practically identical. Although we know nothing of the Ldlakoiiti and Mlimzraati altars of any village but Walpi, I venture to predict that when those, now unknown, are described their differences from those at Walpi will not be one of type, but of minor variation. If, in other words, we know one altar of a given society well we will have no difficulty in recognizing the same type in the other four Tusayan villages. There are, therefore, believed to be at least as many types of tiponi altars as there are sacerdotal societies, and the most difficult question is a comparison of these types rather than members of the same type. The Katcina Altar at C(ipaulovi Cipaulovi is the smallest of all the Tusayan pueblos and its altars are the poorest in ceremonial paraphernalia.' Nowhere is this poverty better seen than in the Katcina altar of that village. It consists of a figure of seven rain-clouds, with parallel lines, representing falling rain, drawn on the floor of the kiva with sacred meal, in front of a row of five vertical sticks, symbolic of cornstalks or growing corn. Upon that part of this meal plicture which represents falling rain four stone implements are arranged in a row. There are no anthropomorphic images on this altar, 1 For description of the Nimsn Katcina altars of Cipaulovi, Walpi, and Micofiinovi, see Journ.

The Katcina altar at Cipaulovi is very simple,' but we may rightly suspect that the essentials of a Katcina altar are present.

It has, however, an upright reredos, instead of a meal figure oni the floor, upon which are depicted rain-cloud symbols. Two supple- mentary upright slats, with pictures called Tufiwup, an anthro- pomorphic representation of the sun, are present. There are zig- zag slats, symbols of lightning, and round sticks with emblematic corn designs. 1 In all the altars which we are considering there is always a tiponi or chieftains' badge. Accessories like medicine bowls, trays of sacred meal, aspergills, etc, are common to all altars, and are not regarded as distinctively characteristic enough to be of value in comparative studies. Homologous objects on these altars have the same numbers in the cuts. 2 The character of public Katcina dances, even when abbreviated, justifies the belief that they are performed for rain and corn. The pranks of the clown priests are con- cerned with growth of crops, over which this society has special powers.</page><page sequence="5">May 1897] MORPHOLOGY OF TUSAYAN ALTARS 133 While, therefore, the altar at Walpi is more complicated than that at Cipaulovi, it is not as rich in accessories as that of Micofiinovi. The Katcina Altar at Micotinovi The Katcin.a altar in this the most populous village at the Middle mesa is still more complicated than the Walpi repre- sentation. In addition to other objects found on the Walpi altar it has two images, one on each side, and while the zigzag sticks fail, stone implements, similar to those on the far simpler Cipau- t1 -, -. . ?~'~' ;/J FIG. 2-Katcina Altar at Walpi. lovi altar, are presealt. There are two symbols of maize, as at Walpi, and numerous sticks, representing growing corn, recall the same symbols of the Cipaulovi equivalent. The two images of the Micofiinovi altar are evidently those of the Little War God and the Germ Maid. There can be little doubt of the accuracy of identification of the latter, and the former has the parallel marks on the body symbolic of Piifikofi- hoya. A comparative study of the symbolism, simple and elaborate, of the Katcina altars leads me to the conclusion that the altar at</page><page sequence="6">134 THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. X Micofiinovi is the most complicated yet described,' and that this complication is an elaboration of the less developed and not due to the introduction of new elements. Analysis reduces this composite symbolism to rain-clouds, fertilization, growth, and maturity of corn, the most important elements of the whole Hopi ritual. A somewhat more detailed statement of this point is per- haps desirable.

These three methods may coexist, they are interchangeable, and are phylo- genetically connected in the development of rituals. In public 1 Mr H. R. Voth has kindly sent me photographs and sketches of the Oraibi Katcina altar, which show that it is even more complicated than the Micoilinovi. He has also given me a copy of his notes on the Oraibi PowamBi, with permission to quote them, but as he has in mind a detailed description of this elaborate ceremony, it is best not to anticipate his account with fragmentary references. They add strong support to the conclusions arrived at in this article.</page><page sequence="7">May 1897] MORPHOLOGY OF TTSAYAN ALTARS 135 ceremonials the first method is almost invariably adopted. but in secret rites all three are employed. The representations on the Ninman altar at Cipaulovi and Walpi are limited to the third method, those at Micoflinovi in- clude likewise the second. There is no need of considering more in detail the character of the symbols illustrating the third method of representation on Katcina altars. They refer, as already stated, to rain, light- ning, and corn in various stages of growth. A clearer idea of the use of the second method, representation by images, is perhaps desirable. These figurines, commonly called idols, occur on the Katcina altar of Micofiinovi, and are really symbols of a male god, who wields the lightning, and a female divinity, who con- trols rain and corn. They are simply more highly specialized symbols of the same conceptions as the pictures used in the third method. The image with the rain-cloud coronet is a representation of a mythic rain corn personage, who has many names, appearing in ceremonials, both public and secret, of several different sacer- dotal societies. In the ceremony called the Ldlakoi~ti she is personated both by women in the public dance and by effigies on the altar, and is called the Lakone mana, or maid. In the October ceremony, called the Mamzrauti, she' is like- wise represented by the first and second methods, and is called the Mamzrau mana," or Mamrnzrau maid. During the dramatization in the Antelope kiva of the Snake ceremonials at Walpi she is personated by a maid called the Tcia mana or Snake maid, but no effigy of her is employed in 1 In the public dance she is represented by a girl, but there is a beautiful instance in this ceremony where the third method is substituted for the first in the public dance. For some reason unknown to me in the 1891 exhibit at Walpi no girl took this part, but her place was taken by a participant in the dance who was not dressed as the Germ Maid (Mamzrau mana), but bore in her hands a flat board with a picture of the Germ Maid (see Mamzrauti, pl. Iv, figs 9, 10). The picture, not the bearer, represented the Germ Maid. It is a remarkable confirmation of my theory that Mamnzrau mana is the same conception as Calako mana; that this picture is identical in symbolism with pic- tures of the latter, and was so called by the priests. Comparing the picture of Mamzrau mana on the Mamzrau altar and that of the same on this tablet, we have examples of old and new Hopi art. The picture, publicly exhibited, conforms to modern conception of her symbolism; that on the altar is drawn in simpler and more primitive style of art. 2 Amer. Anthrop., July, 1892. 3 Journ. Amer.

The most elaborate figurines 2 of this being, known as the Corn maids, are used as dolls, and are well represented in various ethnological mn useums. All her different names, and some others which might be men- tioned, are aliases, sacerdotal society names of the same mytho- logical conception, which may be called Muiyinwi, the Germ goddess, associated with rain. This image is called the rain-germ (corn) maid because in the most elaborate representations of her this bifid nature is strongly indicated by symbolism. Her idol on the Micofiinovi Flute altar has four symbols or pictures of maize on the body and three rain-cloud tablets on the head. In numerous dolls she has a picture of an ear of corn on her forehead and an elaborate rain- cloud emblem, with rainbow above it, as shown in figure 5.3 The symbolism of the lefthand image of the Micofiinovi Kat- cina altar, although highly conventionalized, is clearly enough defined to show that it represents the Rain-germ goddess or the Corn maid.4 The other image, likewise known in various Tusayan cere- monials by tutelary sacerdotal aliases, is the male Katcina cultus hero, the fructifying principle symbolized by lightning and per- sonified by such supernaturals as Pitkoihoya, Tcinatiyo (Snake youth), Leiyatiyo (Flute youth), and the like. The images of the altars, therefore, as well as the pictured sym- bols, show us that fructification, growth, and maturity of corn and representation of rain-cloud, lightning, and rain are the most important conceptions involved. I have not yet offered a suggestion in regard to the pictures of TIiwup, which are quite prominent on both the Walpi and Mi- cofiinovi Katcina altars. I believe they are representatives of 1 Journ.

Ix, fig. 31) we have tile two Corn maids and Hehea Katcina, a being with zigzag lines on the cheeks and phallic symbols on the breast, represented like a totem-pole, one above the other. 4 As maize is the important food plant of the Tusayan and Pueblo Indians, there is a tendency to call this rain-germ maiden the Corn maid, as appears in the nomenclature of dolls, where no special religious society name is involved. 18</page><page sequence="10">138 THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. X Tawa, the sun, in anthropomorphic form, for the following rea- sons, and that this beneficent being is introduced as father not FI. 5-Dolt of Calako mana.l1 only of all life, but as giver of the great blessings desired by the celebrants of the ritual. 1 The terraced bodies on the head are rain-cloud symbols; the semicircle, which is colored with different pigments, the rainbow. Thle two pyriform bodies are tipped with radiating rods connected with yarn, and are symbols of squash blossoms and the whorls in which Hopi maids dress their hair. The rectangular design on the forehead is a symbol of an ear of maize, and from it, above the nose, there hangs a small fragment of haliotis shell. The feathers on the body represent the feathered garment which the Corn maids are reputed to have worn.

Both have two horns, crests of feathers, and similar markings on the foreheads. When the Corn maids brought all colored corn seeds to the Hopi, it is said in their legends that the young men were initiated by being flogged by Calako taka, and this flogging initiatory cere- mony still occurs every year at Powami, either by a personator of this mythic person or at the altar when he is symbolically present, as I have described in the 15th Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology. Calako taka is represented by four giants in a ceremony which occurs in Sitcomovi in July of each year, as I have described in the article just mentioned, at which time these "bird monsters," accompanied by Eototo and a number of Koyimse or mud-head priests, enter the pueblo and perform many rites connected with direct sun worship.' The avian symbolism of Calako taka is an expression of the many instances in Hopi worship of an association of the sun and the eagle or some raptorial bird, and these four monsters repre- sent fabulous giant sunbirds. The special ceremonials in which they participate occur at the summer solstice in Sitcomovi and near the winter solstice in Zufii. Tiiwap and Calako taka are Ipractically the same conceptions with different names, and a figure of this god or the sun naturally is drawn on Katcina altars.2 Let us now in our com1)arative studies pass to a consideration of the altars of those ceremoitials which occur between the de- parture of the Katcinas and their return, or the ceremonies of August to December, inclusive, and show the morphological re- semblances between their altars and those of the Katcinas. Of these I will choose the Flute, since we know the variations of the Flute altars in the same three villages, Walpi, Cipaulovi, and 1 This celebration at Sitcomovi is derived from the ZuFii Shalako, celebrated at the winter solstice in that pueblo. 2 The two ceremonials Powama and Paliilkonti, in both of which sun emblems play a conspicuous role, are rites for the germination of corn and beants. This process in the primative mind is aKin to sorcery or brought about by the arts of wizards; consequently the former occurs in the Powako or wizard's moon, Powako muiyaw4, which gives us by syncopation Powama. It is also, as I have pointed out, a purification or lustral cere- mony when children are initiated or introduced to the Katcinas.</page><page sequence="12">140 THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. X Micofiinovi, the Katcina altars of which pueblos have been compared. An analysis of these altars shows us that the same dominant elements, rain-making and growth of corn, exist here as in Katcina altars; the same two cultus heroes, male and female, the light- ning, the germ maids, and symbols of rain-clouds. Other ele- ments which are peculiar to the society are introduced, but in essentials the altars are homologous. The Oraibi Flute altar lends additional evidence to my conclusions, but although I have elsewhere described it, I have not brought it into my present comparisons, in order to limit myself to the three villages where Katcina altars are considered. To simplify my comparisons I will limit myself to one set of Flute altars in the three villages or those erected by the Blue Flute society, which is vigorous in the villages of Cipaulovi, Walpi, and Micofiinovi. Each of the three Blue Flute altars which we are studying has a reredos upon which, as in Katcina altars, rain-cloud symbols are depicted, and in addition we have in the Walpi variant a figure of the sun introduced. Flute Altar of Cipaulovi1 The Flute altar of Cipaulovi is the simplest in symbolism. The reredos is represented by upright slats, arranged side by side, obscurely marked with rain-cloud symbols. In front of the ver- tical slats are sticks, emblematic of growing corn or cornstalks. The four zigzag symbols of lightning hang from the rafters of the room in which the altar is erected. The two figurines-one male, the other female-stand one on each side of the altar. One of these is the Corn maid, the other the Flute hero, both known by the society names the Flute maid and the Flute youth. The other objects-birds, flower mounds, and pollen trail-do not concern us in our comparisons, save to lead me to say that they are common to all Flute altars, and are absent in Katcinas. Flute Altar at Walpi Passing now to the Flute altar of this village, we find it, as that of the Katcina of the same place, more complicated than that of 1 Journ. Amer. Folk-lore, vol. viii, No. xxxi, pl. ii.</page><page sequence="13">May 1897] MORPHOLOGY OF TUSAYAN ALTARS 141 Cipaulovi, and less so than that at Micofiinovi. In it likewise we find the main symbols on the uprights are rain-clouds and corn designs. Four zigzag slats hang from the transverse part over the objects below. Here likewise are the sticks representing growing corn. Three figurines stand before the altar on the floor; the two at the left representing the Corn maids, one of whom, Muiyinwd, has figures of corn on her body and three rain-cloud tablets on her head. The figure on the right is a symbol of the hero, the Flute youth, but although these idols are called by society names, their symbolism leaves no doubt of their identity with images on other altars. Flute Altar at Micoiinovi' It needs but a glance at the two Flute altars at this village to see how close they both are to similar forms already studied. The pictures of rain-clouds on the reredos are the same; there are zigzag slats, symbols of lightning, and rods representing corn, in seed or stalk. We have likewise the Corn maids and the Flute youth, as in the other altars. Comparing, therefore, the main elements indicated by symbols on the Flute altars of Cipaulovi, Walpi, and Micofiinovi, and we find they represent the same dominant ideas as the essentials of the three Katcina altars of the same villages; so there is a certain type relationship between them. The cultus hero and the two Corn maids, which, as we have seen, figure so conspicuously in both Flute and Katcina altars, are represented in the public exercises of the Flute by a lad and two girls, or by what I have designated the first method of per- sonification. It is hardly necessary for me to describe them in detail, or to introduce facts to show that the girls represent the Corn maids, and the lad the Flute hero. I have a suggestion to make explanatory of their non-appearance in the public exhibi- tions. It would be unwise to bring out of the kiva the effigies of these worthies to be seen by vulgar eyes of the uninitiated, and consequently the three children don appropriate costumes to represent the same mythic beings. They are toled into the village from the spring called Tawapa 1 Journ. Amer. Folk-lore, vol. viii, No. xxxi.</page><page sequence="14">142 THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. X by symbols of rain-clouds drawn on the ground, as I have already elsewhere described. Antelope Altar in the Srnake Dance It could hardly be recognized at a glance that the altars of the Antelopes have any great resemblance to those of Katcinas, or Flute societies, and, indeed, outwardly they appear widely different. Morphologically, however, I regard them very simi- lar. The symbolic representations on the sand altar of the An- telopes at Walpi are rain-clouds, falling rain, and lightnings, comparable to those on the reredos of Katcina altars of Walpi and Micoiiinovi or the Flute altars of the villages where they are known. It may be asked, however: Where are the representa- tives of the two supernaturals, male and female, the cultus hero, and the Corn maid? In reply I would say that these are rep- resented not- by wooden images, as in the Flute, but by a boy and girl, who stand one on each side of the altar on the last days of the sixteen songs' ceremony. They wear the same cloth- ing as the Flute hero and maid and represent what these worthies personify. The boy is the Snake Cultus hero; the girl, the Corn maid. Hence the former carries his emblem, the snake, symbol of the Snake society, while the latter appropriately bears the earthen bowl with cornstalks and bean vines, emblem of her function.' The same dominant elements control the Antelope-Snake cere- mony as the Katcinas and Flute, and the same mythological beings figure in it. We might, if space permitted, extend our comparisons to the altars of the great germinative ceremonies, the Lalakoiiti and Mamzramuti, where we would find the same male and female fig- urines, representatives of cultus heroes and germ maids. We might likewise point them out in the public exercises of the same ceremonies. There are variations characteristic of the so- cieties, and the idols bear different names, but behind these un- important variations are the same conceptions, variously worked 1 In my memoir on the Walpi Snake Dance I have not emphasized sufficiently the elements of corn worship which pervade. it. The ceremony is performed both for rain and ,bundant harvests, and differs from others only in the fact that the Snake priests introduce their 'elder brothers," the reptiles, to aid them in bringing the rains. The Antelope dance on the eighth day is practically for abundant crops, and the Snake dance, when the reptiles are carried by the Snake priests, is a prayer for rain.</page><page sequence="15">May 1897] MORPHOLOGY OF TUSAYAN ALTARS 143 out, which I have designated rain-clouds and rain, lightning, germination, growth, and ripening of the corn crop. We must await new studies to become familiar with modifi- cations of altars in different villages, but enough is already known to predict that they will show us simply modifications of these elementary ideas, the substratum of all Hopi worship. On the screen of the Walpi Palliikoiti we find the same sym- bols, rain-clouds, lightning, sun emblems, and pictures of the two Corn maids and two males or lightning gods, comparable with either Cotokinu~iwi or Piliikoihoya. In this ceremony, like- wise, we have the effigies of the Plumed Snakes and the sym- bolic dramatization, through their agency of the earth by the sun, of the fertilization of the cornfields in the way I have else- where described. Even in this highly modified form we detect the same elements which were found in the altars previously considered.' We are justified in regarding the supernaturals personated by adults or children and represented by symbols in the form of images or pictures on Tusayan altars as spirits of the ancients. On this theory we have a ready explanation of the fact that Katcinas are represented by masked persons, and as a corollary a suggestion regarding the symbolism of the masks they wear. The Hopi, like many people, look back to a mythic time when they believe their ancestors lived in a "paradise," a state or place where food (corn) was plenty and rains abundant-a world of perpetual summer and flowers. Their legends recount how, when corn failed or rains ceased, culture heroes have sought this imaginary or ideal ancestral home to learn the "medicine " which blessed this happy land. Each sacerdotal society tells the story of its own hero, who generally brought from that land a bride who transmitted to her son the knowledge of the altars, songs, and prayers which forced the crops to grow and the rains to fall in her native country. To become thoroughly conversant with the rites he marries the maid, since otherwise at his death they would be lost, as knowledge of the " medicine" is trans- mitted not through his clan, but to the child of his wife. So the Snake hero brought the Snake maid (corn-rain girl) from 1 It is very much to be hoped that exhaustive studies may be made of Soyalui~a and Paliitiikoiti in all the Tusayan villages, for our knowledge of them is at present very fragmentary and recorded facts too scanty for accurate generalizations.</page><page sequence="16">144 THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOIOGIST [Vol. X the underworld, the Flute hero, her sister, the Little war god the Lakone manna. A Katcina hero, in the old times, " on a rabbit hunt, came to a region where there was no snow. There he saw other Katcina people dancing amidst beautiful gardens. HTe re- ceived melons from them and carrying them home told a strange story of a people who inhabited a country where there were flowering plants in midwinter. The hero and a comrade were sent back, and they stayed with these people, returning home loaded with fruit during February. They had learned the songs of those with whom they had lived and taught them in the kiva of their own people.'1 In the ceremnonies with unmasked personifications an attempt is made to reproduce the conditions which these cultus heroes saw in the lands they visited, to augment the efficacy of the cere- monies copied. In the Katcinas the same feeling is dominant. Each perform- ance is an endeavor to reproduce an ancestral Katcina celebra- tion, and in this sense is a dramatic performance, reproducing, as far as legends can guide them, the nature and personnel of the ancestral ceremony. The p)erformers are masked because, according to their stories, the participants in those ancient rites had zodmorphic and totemic, or at least only partially anthropo- morphic, forms. The symbolism of the mask betrays the totem of those ancestral personages-corn, rain, water-loving animals, lightning, and the like. I have shown that the most prominent symbols and figurines on several Tusayan altars of widely different societies refer to the sun, rain-clouds, and the fertilization, growth, and maturity of corn. Masked performers represent supernaturals connected with the production of the latter. The ceremonial acts about the altars or in the public exhibitions have one intent, to affect the gods who control these necessities. In their complicated rites the priests believe they can do this by reproducing ancestral cere- monies and are guided in their presentation by current legends. Personifications, masked or unmasked, are therefore introduced that the performance may be more realistic-a more accurate reproduction of the ancient. This feeling is essentially the reason why the priests are so conservative and why, unable to explain 1 Journ. Amer. Eth. and Arch., vol. n, No. 1, p. 152.

It looks to me as if the same evidences of composition which we find in the social organization of the Hopi can also be de- tected in their ritual. Originally a few clans living in separate villages, time and possibly desire for mutual protection has led them to unite into phratries and larger groups, whose members are only distantly related by blood. Each new increment brought its contribution to the ritual, and did not abandon its own rites on consolidation; hence the marvelously rich ritual which has resulted. Some of these components are so close to others that we may suppose the phratries who brought them were closely related; others vary so widely that they can hardly be compared. Probably no one component of the consolidated stock ever practiced all the ceremonies now observed yearly in any one of the five largest Tusayan towns, but the growth of the system has kept pace with the advent of additions. In the same way no doubt they would receive any new cult, and they prob- ably accepted Christianity, when it first came to them, as an addition to those preiixisting. When, however, it dawned upon them that the padres intended to unify their religion, and sub- stitute for ancient ceremonials a new system, it was far above their comprehension. They pronounced the innovation Powako, or sorcery, and so effectually eradicated it that for over two cen- turies no missionary could live among them. 19</page></plain_text>
