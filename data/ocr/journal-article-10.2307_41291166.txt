<plain_text><page sequence="1">169 Dedicated to the memory of Traianos Gagos* The Epistolary Rhetoric of Zoilos of Aspendos and the Early Cult of Sarapis: Re-reading P. Cair.Zen. i 59034 Long recognized as an important document in the history of the cult of Sarapis, the enigmatic letter from an unknown individual named Zoilos to Apollonios the finance minister ( dioiketes ) of Ptolemy II, re- corded as received on February 12 or 13, 257 B.C., stands out for the degree to which we are able to view the earliest stages of the process by which a sanctuary might be founded.1 Given that most of our other non-literary evidence on the foundation of cults and shrines dates to stages much further along in their development and tends to provide minimal information on the impetus, the letter serves as an espe- cially important source for that nascent process, as well as for the role of dreams in determining or justi- fying a religious undertaking. Although its contents are generally well known, several aspects of the pa- pyrus have not been closely scrutinized, with the result that its value for the study of religion in the Hel- lenistic period, and especially the cult of Sarapis, has not been fully realized. In light of recent scholar- ship situating Zoilos's proposed sanctuary of Sarapis at Memphis and other recent work on the early cult, the letter requires a reevaluation as evidence for the god's worship in his native city and land, as it potentially becomes one of the most important sources for the worship of Sarapis within Egypt. Moreo- ver, the letter itself demonstrates noteworthy rhetorical skill that blends subtlety and bluntness in em- ploying a deliberate rhetorical strategy, and as such it stands out among the representatives of the episto- lary genre surviving from Ptolemaic Egypt. Section I: Text and Translation of Zoilos's Letter First edited and published in 1917 by Girolamo Vitelli, who was working from a copy made by the re- cently deceased Guido Gentilli, the Zoilos papyrus is among the most important and well-known of the 3000 surviving papyri (only 1750 of which are legible) in the Zenon Archive, having received multiple editions and been the subject of innumerable discussions.2 Zoilos's letter consists of twenty-eight lines It was with great sadness that we learned of the passing of Traianos Gagos as this article was nearing completion. Traianos had given us much valuable assistance along the way, not only in terms of making the papyrology facility at the University of Michigan an accessible and ideal place in which to work, but also by sharing his insights on several issues ad- dressed below. On a more personal note, it was Traianos who gave Renberg his first experience working in this field, by hir- ing him as an undergraduate to assist with the preparation of a bibliographical database of Michigan papyri that ultimately became part of APIS. Thus like so many others in the field we feel his loss both personally and professionally, and therefore have dedicated this article to him. 1 We would like to thank Dorothy J. Thompson and Kent J. Rigsby for their generosity in reading earlier drafts of this article and providing many valuable comments, and Ludwig Koenen for his similarly illuminating feedback at multiple stages of this project, especially for his guidance during the process of determining the significance of the ink traces on recto and verso and establishing a new edition of this text. We have also benefitted from consultations with Nikos Litinas, Franziska Naether, and Heinz-Josef Thissen on specific points, and wish to express our gratitude. We are greatly indebted to Rosario Pintaudi and Diletta Minutoli for providing us with the high-resolution scans of this papyrus prepared for the online PSI pro- ject, and to Sayed Hassan of the Egyptian Museum of Cairo, where the document now resides. Special thanks are due to Alex Lee of the University of Chicago for technical assistance. This project began during the year that we overlapped as faculty members at Washington University in St. Louis. Though very much a collaborative effort, composing Sections I &amp; III was primarily undertaken by Renberg and Section II by Bubelis. 2 Before its standard edition by C.C. Edgar as P. CairZen. I 59034 (with PI. 12), the papyrus appeared as: PSI IV 435 (with comments of U. Wilcken, AfP 6 [1920], 394-395; followed by Deissmann [1923], 121-128 + figs. 19-20); P. Edg. 7; SB III 6713. Edgar's edition has been followed in Clary sse- Vandorpe [1995], 78-85 (with photo), C. Zen.Palestine 31, RICIS 314/0601, and all other reproductions of the text. The one potential improvement to the text has been Peter van Minnen's</page><page sequence="2">170 G.H. Renter g and W.S. Bubelis of text on both recto and verso , only a few of which cannot be fully restored with confidence, and meas- ures 30 by 30.5 centimeters. Due to the availability of new, high-resolution scans of the papyrus we have been able to provide the first new edition of the text since that of C.C. Edgar (Figs. 4-5). 3 These scans have permitted several minor improvements but, more importantly, made it possible to examine and con- firm the reverse-image traces of the text on the verso that were employed by Edgar to restore part of the large lacuna at the recto's upper-right (see note to //. 9-10). These reverse-image traces are themselves quite significant, since they lead to the inclusion of Zoilos's letter among the small group of papyri that have had text transferred from one side to the other, enabling the restoration of lost material. The most notable example of this phenomenon is the Artemidorus Papyrus, which had ink trans- ferred both from verso to recto and recto to verso (see Bastianini [2009] and D'Alessio [2009], 37-41), and a significant amount of the "New Posidippus" papyrus was retained as such "offset images" as well (P. Mil.Vogl. VIII, pp. 6 et pass). This group is also known to include a fragment from Thucydides Book VII in the Yale collection (P. Yale I 19; see Babcock- Emmel [1997]) and an unpublished frag- ment from Thucydides Book I which is to appear in PSI XVI, both of which have verso traces preserving other parts of the text.4 In the case of the Posidippus papyrus, the ink transfers occurred after it had been cut up and moistened for use as cartonnage , but in the case of the Artemidorus Papyrus it occurred while the document was rolled up and somehow became wet, leading several drawings and some text to be re- produced. Similarly, the reversed, offset image on the back of the Yale papyrus has been shown to have been transferred when the lengthy scroll was being rolled, after a portion had somehow become wet and moistened the ink.5 This sort of transfer, also producing reversed letters, is evident on the Zoilos papy- rus, even though since it was a single sheet of papyrus it was folded vertically rather than rolled horizon- tally.6 What makes this papyrus distinct from the others with mirror texts, and possibly unique, is that the Zoilos papyrus, always having been a single sheet rather than part of a longer scroll or codex, pre- rejection of the ethnic "Aspendios" in favor of the patronymic "son of Asklepiades," but we have been able to confirm the original reading (see note to /. 1). The bibliography on this papyrus is vast, and therefore only studies that are of particular significance to the topics addressed here are cited. The two most recent treatments of note are Rigsby (2001) and Pfeiffer (2008), which provide further bibliography.

By using Adobe Photoshop to create a translucent mirror-image of the verso and then slide it over the scan of the recto until both text and mirror text were lined up it was possible to find sev- eral precise matches for particular letters and groups of letters, demonstrating beyond any doubt that the verso text came from the recto (see figs, la-c, showing 7ipociay|xaciv in /. 19 on the recto and verso and as a semi-opaque overlay).

This folding process was repeated several times, so that traces of lines 4-20 can be found on the verso , including the text that would otherwise be lost because of the large lacuna. There are no traces from lines 1-3, since there was not enough space at the top of the papyrus to receive their impressions. It is a curious aspect of this mir- ror text that the transferred letters are more clearly visible and identifiable on the right side than the left, which suggests that while the papyrus was still folded this side became wetter than the other (see fig. 2, last page).

When I had come to Alexandria and hesitated I16 to talk to you concerning these matters instead of the business matters which you had agreed to with me, once again I suffered a relapse that lasted for four months, on account of which I was unable to come to you right away. Therefore, Apollonios, it would be good for you to heed the god's commands so that Sarapis will be merciful to you and greatly enhance your I20 status with the king and give you good health.

Edgar's long-accepted - but admittedly "doubtful" (P. Edg. 7, at 176) - reading of the ethnic 'ActcsvSioc in I. 1 was challenged by P. van Minnen, who on the basis of a photograph pro- posed the patronymic 'AckXt|7U(x[5]oi) instead (BL VIII, p. 77). However, our examination of the new scan con- firms Edgar's Xc7iev[5]ioc. (C.A. La'da cites van Minnen but retains the foreign ethnic [Pros. Ptol. X E263].) x[cov ] Thus Edgar. The first line most likely gave additional information regarding Zoilos's social status and associates, but this has been lost in the lacuna. One should not accept unhesitatingly the restoration of x[cov Ke- pi Ka^iKpaxriv] that was tentatively suggested by Edgar - who inadvertently switched the references to P. Cair. Zen. I 59006 and 59034, but clearly intended the latter - in his edition of P. Mich. I 100 based on the presence of a Zoilos in that Zenon papyrus's opening, 11. 1-2: ['A7toM,covicoi 8ioi]Kr|ifii xaipsiv Zco&amp;oc o 7ia[pd # . Jovxoc xox&gt; 7iapa KaAAiKpaxoDC Aoysvxric [xou xpir|papxil]|iaxoc (Pros. Ptol. VI 15725, 15758 and Pros. Ptol. X E263). Ed- gar himself noted that "The hands, though similar, are not identical," which raises doubt that it is the same Zoilos, or at least the same scribe. Moreover, the Kallikrates in question was the Ptolemaic fleet commander Kallikrates of Samos (Pros. Ptol. VI 14607), making any reference to unnamed "Friends of the King" superfluous: identi- fying himself as an agent of Kallikrates of Samos would have been more than sufficient as introduction for Zoilos. (On Kallikrates, see Hans Hauben, Callicrates of Samos: A Contribution to the Study of the Ptolemaic Admiralty Studia Hellenistica 18 [Leuven 1970]; cf. Mooren [1975], 58-60, No. 010.) While the restoration x[cov Tcepi KctXki- Kpaxriv] remains possible but unverifiable, another person's name might instead have appeared in a similar phrase, but the lacuna could just as easily have identified a group that was not necessarily associated with a single pro- minent individual, such as cleruchs or military personnel. A restoration with the formula xfjc 87iiyovfjc, signaling that Zoilos was a native-born descendant of a foreign soldier, should also be considered, though it falls well short of filling the lacuna , and since some of the letter's contents hint at foreign origin this is less likely than a restora- tion indicating Zoilos's membership in some group. (For the formula xfjc S7nyovf|c, see C. A. Lada, "Who were those 'of the Epigone' T' in PapCong 21, 1:563-569.) The one other suggestion that has been made, that the tau belongs to a toponym (Clary sse- Vandorpe [1995], 80), can be discounted because this would require following the name of one place - Aspendos - with another. 2 oc kou: For the use of Kai as an interjection adding emphasis, see Mayser, Gram. II. 3, p. 144. 1)710 xcov xou Pacilscoc (piXcov: This phrase presents a problem, since in Egypt this was a court title only em- ployed in reference to someone's belonging to the group of "friends" serving the king, i.e. "[name] imo xcov xou PaciXscoc cpiXcov," rather than for identifying someone individually as a "Friend of the king." Thus Zoilos either accidentally omitted the name of a person giving him introduction to Apollonios, which seems unlikely given the polished nature of the letter, or was using the phrase in a non-traditional way, perhaps emulating looser overseas practices (see Sect. II. i). 4 7ipoc: The letters are squeezed together and the word itself exdented; the ink reveals clear signs that a previ- ous, slightly shorter word was washed out and replaced with this one. 4 and 6: Both xp^maxiCeiv and xp^maxic|ii6c were routinely used for a range of oracular media that included dreams but was not limited to them (see Louis Robert, RevPhil [1974], 205n.l52 [= Robert, OMS V:292], Robert, Hellenica 1:72, and Christopher P. Jones, "Epigraphica," ZPE 139 [2002] 108-1 16, at 1 10). From the context there is no particular reason to reject the interpretation of xpr||iaxic|i6c in /. 6 as "dream-oracle." 5 and 7: In his original edition Edgar wrote of lines 5 and 7 that "The restorations in this line and in line 7 are more or less conjectural" (P. Edg. 7, at p. 176). With the aid of the new scans we have been able to improve upon Edgar's text of /. 5 (rcpoc cs Kai 8|xcp[avicco coi xo]v5s xo[v]), which is still uncertain but now less so; however, it has not been possible to improve on /. 7, though Edgar's reading seems secure based on context. 5: Beginning with Edgar's first edition (P. Edg. 7, at pp. 173, 176), the phrase oncoc fiv diaiiXsvcco npdc cs was long thought to refer to a voyage across part of the Mediterranean Sea from outside of Egypt, primarily be- cause of Zoilos's use of SiarcXeTv rather than Kaxa7iX8iv or 7iapa7iXeIv. As recently argued by K.J. Rigsby,in Egypt the act of sailing "over" would usually have been taken to refer to the Nile river, which supports linking this papy- rus to the Memphis area (Rigsby [2001], 120-121, with references to those following Edgar at 118n.2). The be- ginning and end points of Zoilos's crossing, however, are impossible to determine with any certainty. Part of the problem lies in the fact that the phrase "Sarapis instructed me again and again in my sleep" (xov Capa7uv |ioi Xpr||iaxiCeiv rcXeovaKic sv xoic ikvoic) in the preceding clause might represent a conflation of dreams that Zoilos received over a period of months, as he resisted the god's wishes. Even if Zoilos was referring solely to dreams re- ceived at Saqqara, where he appears to have received at least the initial dream or dreams (see Sect. Ill.ii), it is pos- sible that Apollonios at the time was a short distance downriver at Heliopolis or Berenikes Hormos if not on the eastern side of the Nile across from Memphis. Unfortunately, since the location of Apollonios 's Scoped in the Memphis area is unknown, there is no particular reason to place him in the latter area, making nearby Heliopolis</page><page sequence="8">176 G.H. Renberg and WS. Bubelis or else Berenikes Hormos preferable, even though Kaia7i^8Tv would have been slightly more appropriate than SiarcAsiv. Apollonios is known to have made at least one trip through the Delta in 258 B.C., which not only puts him in the area of Alexandria - specifically, at Nikiou, on the Canopic branch midway between Alexandria and Memphis - around the time that Zoilos indicates he was there, but also makes it almost certain that Apollonios would have spent at least some time in Memphis as well that spring and summer (see Appendix). Therefore, either point between Memphis and Alexandria is a likely place for Apollonios to have been when Zoilos first considered sailing across to him. (The precise location of Berenikes Hormos is unknown, but is thought to have been north of Memphis on the east side of the river, perhaps serving Heliopolis itself [see Pestman (1981), 481; cf. Rigsby, ibid ., 121].) There is also a third possibility worth considering: if Apollonios was in Memphis itself at the time then Zoilos would have been referring to a boat ride across the Phchet canal, which ran parallel to the Nile on the west side of the city, between Memphis and Saqqara (see Thompson [1988], 10-17, with figs. 2-3). During the summer months a lake formed in the area extending from the canal to the dikes along the city's western perimeter, but perhaps part of the lake remained year round just northwest of the city. Though not as wide an expanse as the Nile, the canal nevertheless had to be sailed across, either directly or diagonally, by anyone wishing to reach Memphis from the temple complexes atop the bluff. Thus if Zoilos was indeed at Saqqara when he received his initial dreams from Sarapis and Apollonios was in Memphis, it would not have been the Nile that he was instructed to sail across in order to reach Apollonios, but rather this canal - and, if these dreams were received in July (see Appendix), when the Nile flood would occur, its waters may well have been overflowing and forming or expanding the lake at the time. 6 aDTCOi [ c. 16 vaov xe]: Several attempts have been made to restore this lacuna , which measures roughly 19-22 letters (and, unfortunately, cannot be recovered from the verso reverse-image because of the same extensive lacuna). The restoration of Edgar, who in his notes proposed [toic coTc avr|A,co|iaciv ispov is] "or something simi- lar," has not been accepted, although it was duly reported in his own notes by X. Durand, who in turn suggested that instead the lacuna contained the name of the site where the sanctuary was to be established (C. Zen. Palestine, p. 190). However, in light of the letter's emphasis on finances, Edgar's restoration remains worthy of considera- tion. More recently, Rigsby has argued against U. Wilcken's restoration of Capajneiov because this term would automatically imply the establishment of a temenos ( AfP 6 [1920], 395n.l : [imo cod Capa7usi6v is] | Kai TS^ievoc), in turn tentatively proposing Pcofioc while leaving unrestored the beginning of the lacuna (Rigsby [2001], 122n.l 1: [ c. 10 pcojiov ts] | Kai xsjasvoc). Rigsby is indeed correct that Capcmslov is Kai tsjisvoc would be unnecessarily redundant: papyri from Egypt and inscriptions from throughout the Greek world provide no such combination of tsjisvoc with a term for sanctuary specific to a particular god, such as Capa7ii8iov, "Icieiov, and 'AcK^r|7n£lov, according to searches of the Packard Humanities Institute's database of Greek inscriptions (http://epigraphy/packhum.orginscriptions; searched 9/1 1/2010) and the Duke Data Bank of Documentary Papyri (http://papyri.info/navigator/ddbdpsearch; searched 9/11/2010). However, although Rigsby supports his restora- tion of pcojLioc by pointing out that '"Altar and precinct' was an obvious way to inaugurate a sacred place - to wit, the altar mentioned at the end of the same sentence," and comparanda for this do exist (/. Alex.Ptol. 14, 11. 8-10: touc Pcdjiouc | Kai xa isjjivri Kai ttiv ci)v|KupoDcav aikoic yi^v; I. Alex.Ptol. 25, /. 3: to tsjisvoc Kai tov Pco^iov), a restoration of [ vaov is] Kai tsjlisvoc (or perhaps [vaov is pcofiov is Kai] xsjasvoc) is preferable. A restoration that includes vaoc is suggested not only by the broader context of Zoilos 's letter (see Sect. IH.i for discussion), but by the available epigraphical comparanda from Egypt and beyond that mostly show dedica- tions of temples and precincts to gods (in contrast to /. Alex.Ptol. 14 and 25, cited above, which were both for sites partly honoring Ptolemaic rulers living or dead). Most notably, one of the gold plaques from the Alexandrian Sarapieion' s foundation deposits records the dedication by Ptolemy III of xov vaov Kai to tsjusvoc to Sarapis (/. Alex.Ptol. 13). Other inscriptions provide further examples: in Ephesos during the third century B.C., a priest con- secrated a sanctuary of a god inconclusively identified as Sarapis and built a temple to him in compliance with a divine command ([ ]vod iSpiScaxo | Kaxa 7rp6cxay|ia tov 08oi) | to lep6[v] Kai tov vaov | cbiKoSojaricsv Kai to T8(j,8voc | avsSsi^ev ispov tod 0801) 7ip0c|Ta£avT0c, ispsvc ysvojasvoc | rtaxvKiac MevsKpaTODc) (/.

These arguments for a restoration of [ vaov xs] Kai xejievoc have been partly anticipated by S. Pfeiffer, who, though unaware of Rigsby's article, states, "I think that 'altar' as a possible reconstruction is less probable, as a temenos must normally have a naos " (Pfeiffer [2008], 396n.54). For a similar argument regarding another document from the cult of Sarapis, see F. Sokolowski's reason for restoring [ie]|[p]ov instead of [P(o]|[^]ov in an inscription from Magnesia on the Maeander: "I think that the building of a temple or chapel was more important for the establishment of a cult than that of an altar" (Sokolowski [1974], 448, on I. Magnesia 99, //. 12-14 [ RICIS 304/0701]). Though right in principle, Sokolowski appears mistaken regarding this particular situation. The re- levant lines in Kern's corpus run: ev aM-coi 8e xorccoi |xf| [ttoibixco pco]|[|a]ov Capa7u5oc* si 8s |if|, ocpeiXexco xcoi 5tijlicoi 5[paxjiac | K]ai o xorcoc ecxco xfjc 7ioX[eco]c ("Let him [i.e. the priest] not erect an altar(?) of Sarapis in another place; but if he does, let him owe the demos ... drachmas, and let the spot become city property"). This suggests strongly that the injunction concerns an altar, since a new precinct could be consecrated and an altar erected relatively quickly and thus without detection (or obstruction), whereas the establishment of a new shrine would have come to the attention of civic authorities before it was completed and thus been easily prevented. The intended purpose of this passage appears to have been to prevent the cult's spread to multiple sites. A similar con- clusion regarding the desirability of restoring [Pco]|[jli]ov in the Magnesia inscription is to be found in K.J. Rigsby, "Notes on Sacred Laws," ZPE 170 (2009), 73-80, at 77-78. For the beginning of the lacuna it is worth considering a restoration of Kal xfji "IciSi, which would make this a temple shared with Isis (tentatively suggested by L. Koenen). 7 Edgar's suggested reading of "ev xfji fEM,r|viKfii (sc. |ispi8i)" is questionable because jiepic is not the word one would use for city quarters in Memphis, which originally was divided into ethnic quarters and in Roman times into ajacpoSa (see Calderini, Diz. geogr. 111:260 and Thompson [1988], 266; for the administrative use of ajucpoSa in Roman Egypt, see Richard Alston, The City in Roman and Byzantine Egypt (London &amp; New York 2002), 130- 157; for use of the term in the Hellenistic world outside of Egypt, see Sara Saba, "'AficpoSa in Hellenistic Times: Urban Planning and Philological Interpretation," AntCl 11 [2008], 79-90). Although the term ajicpo8ov is not known to have had its feminine form (ajicpoSoc) until Roman times, it is possible that this form was in use earlier, in which case Zoilos could have been referring to a fEM,r|viKr| a(i(po5oc. Since this is by no means certain, how- ever, other alternatives must be considered. The common name of the Helleno-Memphite quarter to the north of the city proper is believed to have been xo 'EXkr'vxov, based on a small number of Greek and Demotic papyri (see Thompson, ibid., 17n.38, 95-97), and one would expect Zoilos to have used this term instead of the related adjec- tive. The likeliest solution is that Zoilos had in mind an unknown Greek agora , the existence of which might be inferred from a reference to an "Egyptian agora " in the Ptolemaios Archive ( UPZ I 19, /. 10: ev xfji Aiyojcxiai ayopai; see Thompson, ibid., 19, 72). As Ptolemaios 's petition states that this agora was beside the river, a Greek agora presumably would have been located there as well, rather than in the Hellenion , which does not appear to have abutted the river (see Thompson, ibid., fig. 3). Support for this interpretation can be found in Zoilos's use of the phrase rcpoc xcoi Xi'xev[i], an apparent reference to the harbor of Memphis, which dated back to Pharaonic times and was a destination for sea-going vessels as well as those plying the waters of the Nile and nearby canals (see Thompson, ibid., 59-61). This is problematic because the term Xi[ir'v, which ordinarily referred to coastal harbors, does not appear in any papyri in reference to the harbor at Memphis (or any other city on the Nile) before Roman times. However, since references to the A,i|ir|v Mejoxpscoc are found in a number of customs documents be- ginning in 42 A.D. (P. Customs, pp. 22-23, 223 [= Index VII]), it is likely that the harbor was called this long be- fore the imposition of a tax that necessitated use of the name in official documents. Indeed, the presence of sea ships would have made Xijxtiv a logical term for this riverine harbor, though perhaps it was previously just an in- formal name. Either a Greek neighborhood or Greek marketplace would have been an appropriate place for a Sa- rapieion to be constructed, so it is impossible to come to a definite conclusion regarding the intended meaning of sv xfji 'EMriviKfji, though a Greek market at which goods were loaded and offloaded is preferable. (We are grate- ful to L. Koenen, D. Thompson and the late T. Gagos for their illuminating comments on the issues associated with these topographical problems.) 8 From the context, Edgar's restoration of 7i[a]p[aixr|caji8VOD] is preferable to A. Deissmann's 7c[a]p[a- KaXicavxoc]. Although Edgar's restorations of xov Geov or xov Caparciv are equally plausible, neither is a good fit for the lacuna of 12-17 letters following where 7rapaixr|ca|i8VOD would end. This suggests either that one or two additional words are missing - perhaps an adjective modifying Capable or 0eoc - or that the god is again referred to as xov Geov Capa7uv (as in I. 3, though not I. 4), as was proposed by Deissmann but rejected by Edgar.</page><page sequence="10">178 G.H.

For spacing reasons, the traces identified by Edgar as the upsilon at the end of the word must come from the beginning, and appear to be from the upper hasta of the epsilon and the bottom of the rho.

In his first edition of this text he stated that the ends of //. 9-10, which are in lacuna , "have been deciphered from the impressions left on the verso " (P. Edg. 7, at p. 173), echoing this in the commentary to his final edition in P. CairZen. These "impressions," as discussed above, are letter traces that were transferred from the recto to the ver- Fig. 6: verso, flipped and reversed image of a section of lines 9-10 transferred from recto so when the papyrus was folded. Although letters and letter fragments found in 11. 7-20 are visible, only in 11. 9-10 can several letters be strung together, and even two complete words be formed (above, Fig. 6). It is very good for- tune that it should be 11. 9-10 that were preserved better than others, since the ends of both lines on the recto were lost in the lacuna. Through a remarkable effort - one made all the more so because he did not have the luxury of flipping around digital images or manipulating them - Edgar was able to use these impressions to restore most of the missing text. In order to see the "impressions" that Edgar used to restore these two lines one must turn the verso upside-down and view a mirror image of it. The sic in 1.9 and 7ip0C8i)£;d|Li8V0C in /. 10 become clearly legible, Fig. 7: end of line 9 and it is also possible to discern the APPQ from Edgar's dppcoc[i](a[v],as well as several full letters from other words. Some are more difficult to identify, including the letters that match up with -fiakzv on the recto and form [7i]8pie(3aA,8v (see Fig. 7, left). The new high- resolution scans have made it possible to confirm all of Edgar's restorations except for [8]a[|i (is] at the end of /. 10, and also have permitted two minor improvements to this line that strengthen his restoration. 10-14 Edgar maintained that "In the sentence beginning 7tpoc8i)£d|a8voc we must supply a verb such as uyidc0r|v," but this becomes unnecessary if one reads this sentence as ending at /. 14 (rather than after 7rpocxacc6|i8VOV in /. 12), with 7iap8y8V8io functioning as the main verb and Sioii synonymous with oil. This also has the effect of eliminating an anacoluthon caused by 7rpoc8i)£dji8voc being without a main verb, which leaves only one, more acceptable anacoluthon (i.e. the use of the infinitive 7ioniC8iv in /. 11, denoting a transition from direct speech to indirect). 17 Although not stated explicitly by Zoilos, the use of i)7i8ipo7rdc0r|v 7cd&gt;av indicates that this four-month ill- ness was similar to or the same as the one described in 11. 9-10, from which it can be inferred that his earlier expe- rience with this unidentified affliction had also been of some duration. The verb i)7i0ip07rdC8iv itself, a variant of i)7coxpo7rid^8iv (or else an error), is only found in Zoilos's letter (though LSJ , 1900, s.v. "i)7ioipo7rdCoo" mistakenly cites it twice, and with different translations, as both PSI IV 435 and P. CairZen. I 59034, giving the false im- pression that there are two instances).

Samuel, Ptolemaic Chronology MiinchBeitr. 43 [Munich 1967], 161-67), subsequent work on the calendar by L. Koenen and P.W. Pestman led to a date of Feb. 12/13 (evening to evening) (Eine agonistische Inschrift aus Agypten und</page><page sequence="11">The Epistolary Rhetoric ofZoilos of Aspendos: Re-reading P.

Erhard Grzybek, Du calendrier Macedonien au calendrier Ptolemaique: Problemes de Chronologie hel- lenistique Schweizerische Beitr. zur Altertumswiss. 20 (Basel 1990), 188, which ought not to be relied on. The main issue is that Samuel, Koenen and Pestman conclude that the Macedonian calendar at this time was lunar and thus began in the evening (see Samuel, ibid., 37-51), but there are also minor differences in some of the underly- ing calculations. Section II: Redefining Religious Agency and Sacral Finance i. The language of salutation Among extant papyri, Zoilos's letter is remarkable for the skilful manner in which he deploys a rhetoric of religious piety in service of his goal of convincing Apollonios to establish and fund a new sanctuary of Sarapis and place himself in a position of authority over the project, and perhaps ultimately the sanc- tuary itself. Zoilos constructs a narrative that interweaves his formal request with a history of his rela- tions with both Apollonios and Sarapis, and thereby situates himself as the necessary and obvious link between the two. Although one cannot objectively ascertain Zoilos's sincerity and whether his true aim was to exploit Apollonios 's religiosity for his own material benefit, the more meaningful issue is how he constructs his appeal within the particular framework of the letter and his relationship to the cult of Sarapls.9 As if by default, Zoilos would thus manage the foundation of the sanctuary, over and against any possible lack of technical experience and perhaps in spite of his past record of service for Apollo- nios. Although Apollonios occupied an official post of real importance, and perhaps of special signifi- cance in this matter given his financial responsibilities, Zoilos utilizes rhetoric that shifts the burden of the argument onto ritual duty and personal benefit and away from pragmatic concerns of cost. Read as either a sincere expression of religious belief or as the tool of a conniving hustler, the letter skillfully ad- vances Zoilos's claims and proposals while perhaps also performing a sleight of hand in relation to the important business at issue. From the outset of his letter, Zoilos establishes a complex, two-fold self- representation that must navigate between the two poles of (relative) subservience to Apollonios and of Zoilos's own identity as an individual of Greek ethnic or cultural background. Such a strategy was nec- essary in order to best leverage every scruple of good will that he might obtain from Apollonios. Zoilos's letter is especially significant for being the only surviving papyrus document known to em- ploy in its salutation a reference to one or more close associates of the king by designating them as "Friends of the King" (/. 2), i.e. agents, aides or counselors. Expanding from the short epistolary formula that customarily begins a letter,10 Zoilos first appears to refer to a group to which he belonged, now missing from the first line, which he expects Apollonios to view respectfully, if not positively (see note to /. 1). Following this quite commonplace opening comes a relative clause in which Zoilos makes an unusual claim, that he was "recommended to you by the Friends of the King" (8iaai)V8aid0r| ooi imo xcov xou paaiXicoc; qntaov). Since, as discussed above (see note to /. 2), the proper Ptolemaic title when employed within Egypt was "[name] xcov xov PaoiAicoq (piAxov" and this would be applied to a single in- dividual, Zoilos's implication that he is held in high opinion by multiple "Friends" is unparalleled, and suggests either a lack of familiarity with the proper use of this title in Egypt, or a willful misuse so as to allege elevated support as a gesture of sophistication. Unfortunately, since the papyrus lacks the end of the first line at the crucial point where Zoilos identifies himself, it is impossible to determine whether this information would have shed light on his relationship to a member or members of the court. The ex- tant section of the greeting nevertheless allows us to contextualize some of the social, and perhaps politi- cal, grounds of Zoilos's appeal to Apollonios. 9 For the possibility that Zoilos was knowingly attempting to deceive Apollonios for personal gain, see n. 61. ^ Although he does not include this particular letter, see Buzon (1984) for epistolary formulae in Greek Ptolemaic let- ters. Depauw (2006) offers a thorough conspectus of Demotic letters and their formulae, as well as a brief treatment of Greek epistolography (pp. 295-299).</page><page sequence="12">1 80 G.H. Renberg and W.S. Bubelis Since we are lacking the information originally included or alluded to in the letter's first two lines, certainty about Zoilos's education and social status remains out of reach. But, Zoilos's understanding of court protocol is in keeping with how that titulature was applied to philoi of the king operating outside of Egypt, and thus raises the possibility that he was influenced by usage overseas. As Herman has shown using the evidence of honorary decrees from the Aegean and Asia Minor, only by the 270's B.C. had the nomenclature of such philoi begun to shift toward more explicitly designating their position in the court, and the language still remained general and amorphous for some period of time.11 Ptolemaic involve- ment with southern Anatolia dates to as early as 280 B.C., and thus opened the way for someone living at Aspendos to become familiar with that protocol in its earliest development.12 Zoilos's invocation of philoi thus could reflect knowledge of such a "friend" who operated in southern Anatolia in that time, but this is far from certain.13 For instance, the Samians granted honors to a father and son as philoi of Ptolemy II (IG XII.6, 1, 28; Mooren [1975], 61, Nos. 012-013), and also to a Macedonian as another such philos ( IG XII.6, 1 , 52). Likewise, at Oropos the koinon of the Boiotians honored a Byzantine as a philos of Ptolemy IV, and Athens might also have continued the tradition for a non- Athenian philos of a still later king (probably Ptolemy VI).14 In every case, the titulature of those with such status is (or can plausibly be restored as) (piA,oc; xoD paai^ecoq, and the friends in question are certainly or very likely to have been from some other polity than Egypt or the community from which they received honors.15 Such cases provide at least some grounds for suspecting that Zoilos did indeed possess a legitimate con- nection to several members of the court, possibly stationed outside of Egypt, and it is this support that he 11 Gabriel Herman, "The 'Friends' of the Early Hellenistic Rulers: Servants or Officials?"

Bagnall, The Administration of the Ptolemaic Possessions Outside Egypt (Lei- den 1976), 1 10-1 14; cf. John Ma, Antiochos III and the Cities of Western Asia Minor (Oxford 1999), 39-43. 13 Although only at the end of the third century were Ptolemaic philoi designated by rank, L. Mooren has shown that the majority of known Ptolemaic philoi in the highest rank served in positions that would have taken them out of Egypt, espe- cially in the capacity of ambassador and general (L. Mooren, "Die diplomatische Funktion der hellenistischen Konigsfre- unde," in E. Olshausen and H. Biller [eds.], Antike Diplomatic [Darmstadt 1979], 256-290, at 258-260; cf. Savalli-Lestrade [1998], 355-368, for distribution of court functions of philoi within other Hellenistic kingdoms). We do not wish to suggest a direct connection with Zoilos, but it should be noted that a possible "Friend," Philip the son of Alexander, is known to have been active in Pamphylia in 281/0 B.C., when Termessos honored him for his activities as the Pamphyliarch appointed by Ptolemy II (DAMM, pp. 53-58). 14 Oropos: /.

Although Kastor is not given an ethnikon, the absence of a demotic might be taken as evidence that he was not an Athenian. 15 Compared to the high incidence of non-Egyptian philoi , few are known to have been of Egyptian origin and also at- tested outside of Egypt. An interesting case is that of a senior Ptolemaic official named Eirenaios, who accompanied a garri- son from Alexandria to the important naval base at Methana, and who identifies himself as one of the "Friends (of the King)" in a dedication on behalf of Ptolemy VI Philometor, Kleopatra II and "their children" sometime during 163-145 B.C. (IG IV 854 = RICIS 102/0501). On this inscription, Eirenaios and the garrison, see D.W.J. Gill, "Arsinoe in the Peloponnese: the Ptolemaic base on the Methana peninsula," in T. Schneider &amp; K. Szpakowska (eds.), Egyptian Stories: A British Egyptologi- cal Tribute to Alan B. Lloyd on the Occasion of His Retirement AOAT 347 (Miinster 2007), 87-109 [esp. 99-103]; cf. Mooren (1975), 202, No. 0370 and G.H. Renberg, "An Overlooked Demotic Source for the Career of Eirenaios, 'Friend of the King'?" (in preparation). Savalli-Lestrade (1998), 256-257, notes that foreign philoi were common already in the reign of Alexander the Great, as is clearly born out in the epigraphic evidence for the philoi of Alexander and the various successors. Egyptian origin would presumably be marked by the appropriate civic or national ethnikon , as for example in the honorary decree of Thera for two brothers identified as Alexandrians and philoi of Ptolemy III or IV ( SEG 18, 325; see Robert, Hel- lenica XI-XII, 1 1 1-1 15). In any case, Egyptians appear to make up a very small percentage of those serving the kings in such a capacity: see Savalli-Lestrade, ibid., 215-250, on the recruitment of philoi as expatriates by other Hellenistic kings.</page><page sequence="13">The Epistolary Rhetoric ofZoilos of Aspendos : Re-reading P. Cairo Zen. 1 59034 181 counts upon to secure his request with Apollonios.16 But it is also worth considering that, as a foreigner, he might have used the term philoi to refer to individuals in Egypt, unaware that his particular deploy- ment of the title was not standard practice, or attempting to impress Apollonios by showing a certain flair. From the salutation onward, Zoilos also deploys several key terms with which he constructs his rela- tionship with Apollonios as one not of subservience and outright deference but one meriting co- operation and near equality. It is difficult, however, to determine the precise semantics of Zoilos's epis- tolary rhetoric, given that no letter from the Ptolemaic period offers even a close point of comparison. Indeed, while Zoilos's language echoes common verbal constructions he combines the various elements of standard epistolary or technical prose to effect a striking composite. First, in order to emphasize his association with one or more members of the court, Zoilos establishes his credentials through a rather uncommon locution that appears intended to denote a kind of intimacy with those of influence, and even a degree of autonomy despite his material dependence. As a verb of introduction, ooviaxdvai is com- monly found and its use would in no way be noteworthy. Yet the doubly compounded verb Siaaima- xavai used here seems intended to connote high confidence placed in Zoilos by important associates of the king, since this rare term appears to have been used for introducing or providing strong backing to someone of much lower status than the addressee but still worthy of confidence.17 Of relevance also is Zoilos's use of the word 6|iota)ysiv, which is a standard enough term found among the documents of the Zenon Archive and many other papyri, but which Zoilos employs in a manner suggestive of a more equal relationship than was probably the case. When casting over the history of his relationship to Apol- lonios, Zoilos employs it to signify Apollonios's agreement with Zoilos about some prior (or, ongoing) affair (//. 15-17: £'iox&gt; 8e 7iapay8vo|i8vou sic; 'AA,8£dv5p8iav Kai okvouvto &lt;; aoi | 7ispi toutcdv cvtuxsiv, akXa 7ispi 7rpay(iax8ia(; riq Kai ob|iota)yiiK6i(; l^oi, | nakiv U7r8xpo7ida0r|v (Lifjvac; xeoaepaQ). For Zoilos to tell Apollonios in this letter that he agreed to some matter strongly suggests that Zoilos is confident in his status as an "unequal equal" of Apollonios: that is, in the present matter Apollonios was not in a po- sition to give orders to Zoilos, and it must be assumed that Zoilos was in some sense free to refuse the business or tasks offered him, and perhaps even that it was Zoilos himself who had first suggested these to the dioiketes. Yet, the two men were not on truly equal ground, since Zoilos's whole proposal for the Sarapieion is predicated upon his financial deficiency. In the earlier matter as well as the shrine's foun- dation that he now proposes, Zoilos situates himself as a kind of agent for Apollonios, at once trusted with an important matter and yet independent of Apollonios's direct authority. Such independence of speech also supports, at least rhetorically, Zoilos's claim to enjoy favor among associates of the king, since someone of distinctly lower status would likely not presume to use the language of equals in a business matter, as an agent free to accept or reject a proposal might. Apollonios himself certainly had numerous business and other interests abroad, as is shown by the Zenon Archive - particularly Zenon' s trip to Judaea, Galilee and Idumaea in 260-258 B.C. (see Pestman [1981], 264) - as well as an inscrip- tion possibly indicating that Apollonios was a native of Cyprus (see K.J. Rigsby, "Two texts of the dioiketes Apollonius," forthcoming in BASP). * ' The term appears in only one other contemporary papyrus, also in the Zenon Archive, in which a letter writer re- counts a complaint for which he sent his slave to seek redress from a scribe (P. CairZen. Ill 59332; cf. P. CairZen. II 59284, an uncertain restoration of this verb). The writer describes his servant by means of this verb in the form of an aorist passive participle (11. 4-6: xov 5iacruv£axr||asvov naida 0paacova... fi8T87t8|i'|/&lt;xjir|v), and also claims that the man was successful in his immediate task. Because the servant in question was a slave (naTc;), the term cannot mean here that the person so established or introduced existed on the same social, legal, or financial level of wealth as the others involved in the affair, in spite of his ability to settle matters favorably on behalf of his master. While the prefix 8ia- arguably signifies only an intensive form of the more common verb of introduction oDvioxavai, the social dynamics of the letter do raise the possibility that this verb was used to express special confidence in an individual whose status might otherwise be viewed as negligible.</page><page sequence="14">1 82 G.H. Renberg and W.S. Bubelis ii. The Rhetoric of Responsibility Zoilos extends his rhetorical self-positioning to a narrative that consists of the core of his argument, namely, that Apollonios must utilize him as a kind of partner or agent for religious affairs because of that previous experience. He begins by reminding Apollonios that the minister had already entrusted him with some business (/. 16: rccpi Tipayjiaisiaq riq Kal objLioXoynKeix; |ioi) but concedes that he did not com- plete his work in any consistent manner. Since Sarapis alone was responsible for the bouts of illnesses that kept Zoilos from his duties (//. 8-17), and he does not otherwise explain his absence of four months (/. 17), Zoilos implies that his absence was nothing more than the work of the god. Although there is no overt reason to question Zoilos' s sincerity in making such a claim (and even in seeking the material sup- port of Apollonios), his apology nevertheless shifts much of the burden of responsibility for his own halting service to the god alone (even if he was responsible for provoking the deity). Furthermore, Zoilos states that he hesitated to discuss his dreams with Apollonios when the two met in Alexandria, preferring instead to stick to Apollonios's business (//. 15-16: sjiou... okvowtoc; goi | 7rspi xoikcov sviDxeiv, akXa 7i8 pi 7ipay^iaT£ia(; r'q Kai objioXoynKSK; jioi). If not for the god's pressing demands, Zoilos thus seems to imply, he would have continued to act diligently on behalf of Apollonios, and would not have been out of communication for such a long period of time in the aftermath of their meeting. In his telling, there- fore, Zoilos is hardly guilty of having abandoned his work, since one cannot disobey a god without seri- ous consequences. While that concession might imply regret about the effects of his sickness upon Apol- lonios's affairs, it is striking that Zoilos does not admit fault. Instead, Zoilos offers a narrative of past service that, if successful, would mitigate any accusation that he should not be entrusted with any other business of Apollonios, much less take on as complicated and (potentially) expensive a task as he pro- poses later in the letter. In addition, Zoilos carries the strategy of obfuscation even further as he interweaves the pragmatic dimensions of his proposal within the narrative of his dreams and the god's instructions to him, the ef- fect of which is to situate himself as the obvious person to oversee the foundation of the new sanctuary. Rather than present even rough financial figures for the project, Zoilos points to the pragmatic require- ments of his proposal through his narrative of the god's instructions to him, which is explored at greater length in Section III. The tone and form of Zoilos 's request contrasts sharply with a well-known letter sent to Apollonios by a group of Egyptian priests, perhaps within several weeks of Zoilos 's request. In this letter, the priests of Aphrodite (i.e. Hathor) at Atfih address Apollonios merely as an official of the king using a standard epistolary formula (/. 1: oi ispsiq ifjq 'AcppoSixriq 'AteoAAcdvicdi [tooi 5ioiKr|i]fii Xaipciv).18 Moreover, the priests have no need to elaborate on their status as Zoilos does, and waste no time in reminding the minister to fulfill the king's promise to provide 100 talents of myrrh for the immi- nent burial of a sacred cow. Notwithstanding the value of the myrrh and the significance of the ritual, the letter is short and businesslike, if not perfunctory, as are several other letters to Apollonios on religious matters.19 What such materials have in common is that the theological import of the requests never re- P. Zen.Pestm. 50 (= Sel. Pap. II 41 1). As noted in Thompson (1988), 1 15, by closing their letter to Apollonios with the wish that Isis "grant you favor before the king" (auxri 5s aoi 5oir| 87cacppo5io(av 7rp[oc; xov PaaiJ^ea), the priests imply a traditional Egyptian quid pro quo whereby heeding a request from priests or cult officials will bring divine blessing, espe- cially for the king or someone who serves the king. Examples of this approach in documents written in both languages show that in Ptolemaic times it filtered from Demotic letters into Greek (see O. Hor , p. 123 and W J. Tait on P. Zen.Pestm . 50, /. 6). However, since Zoilos appears to have been of foreign origin and was not himself a priest it should not be assumed that his taking a similar approach with Apollonios reflects such influences, as this would depend in part on how long Zoilos had been in Egypt and whether he had had some sort of involvement in the cult of Sarapls. Claude Orrieux, Les papyrus de Zenon: L' horizon d'un grec en Egypte au IIIe siecle avant J.C. (Paris 1983), 94, suggests that the tone of the letter lacks any defer- ence because the temple of Aphrodite was under the protection of the king - a status Zoilos did not enjoy. For the relations between Egypt's priests and the royal administration, see now Gorre (2009). The Phoenico-Memphite priests of Astarte at Memphis, for example, also sent a letter to Zenon asking for the same dispensation of oil as the Carians and Helleno-Memphites received ( PSI V 531). Likewise, in a letter of 250 B.C., Zenon wrote to ensure that a priest of Thoeris at Philadelphia received the full amount due him in order to conduct sacrifices (P.</page><page sequence="15">The Epistolary Rhetoric ofZoilos of Aspendos: Re-reading P. Cairo Zen. 1 59034 183 quires anything other than a short letter that is to the point and contains nothing more than a minimal salutation. Dorothy J. Thompson (1978, under Crawford) appropriately emphasizes the degree to which the Ptolemaic administration favored personal connections and status relative to technical experience and managerial technique. Yet the priests' letter is nevertheless an official document first and foremost, and only secondarily a letter that expresses deference to Apollonios, and minimally at that. In contrast, while Zoilos shows extensive interest in Apollonios 's well-being, he neither specifies the approximate cost of construction nor provides even a general list of what materials would be required. Nevertheless, he does identify a series of ritual and practical desiderata that by implication cannot be fulfilled without a substantial outlay of money. The combined temenos and temple for Sarapis (//. 6-7; see note to I. 6) are unlikely to have been perfunctory constructions involving little financial expense or administrative trouble. Since Zoilos stipulates that the shrine must be located in a Greek neighborhood or agora of what is probably Memphis, the cost of land within a relatively crowded urban landscape must be taken into account, regardless of what was to be built on that land.20 Later in the epistle Zoilos also reveals that another worshipper, an unidentified man from Knidos, did manage to produce stones necessary for completing a sanctuary in the same place (11. 13-14: 7cpoa|ayriy6x£i ^iGouq). The natural inference is that the sanctuary Zoilos was proposing to Apollonios would not be a wholly mud-brick construction within a simple temenos , but rather one built in part with expensive masonry. To this should be added any architectural decoration and finishing, as well as all of the paraphernalia of the cult itself. The silence of Zoilos 's letter on the question of calculable financial cost leads to a more significant lacuna , namely, who should administer the sanctuary and its cult and with what kind of managerial structure. The initial construction of the temple and its temenos would represent a significant one-time expense, but the services of a priest and the offerings denoted by the phrase 87riPco|iiC8iv imsp ujicdv (I. 8) would require an on-going source of income.21 While any gift of land by Apollonios could certainly en- dow the cult with much of its resources, it is conceivable that Zoilos intends this Sarapieion to be ad- ministered not solely upon Egyptian lines, but perhaps also with some involvement by Apollonios, in an arrangement that might be more at home elsewhere in the Hellenic world (from which at least one of the two men likely hailed). Private Greek benefactors undertook substantial financial and managerial bur- dens to establish cults whose worship they personally provisioned, and without necessarily any overt in- volvement by the polis , koinon , or king. Whereas the euergetism of wealthy individuals underpinned much religious finance elsewhere in the Greek world, the wealthy of Ptolemaic Egypt - whether Egyp- tian or Greek in heritage - appear to have played a much smaller role, with the king largely eclipsing them 22 Moreover, even when the Lagid crown had appointed certain officers to represent its fiscal inter- CairZen .

Both examples conform to the basic structure, formulae and tone of almost all Ptolemaic letters, for which see Buzon (1984). ™ Location of shrine at Memphis: Rigsby (2001); see discussion in Sect. Ill .i. Population and density remain difficult problems. Thompson (1988), 35, estimates that the city's Ptolemaic population might have been in the range of c. 50,000- 200,000 (and more likely toward the lower end of the scale), but this is based in part upon the assumption that the population density of Memphis was close to only 10 people per hectare. Thompson, however, has informed us via personal communica- tion that she now believes that even the figure of 50,000 is too high for the population of Memphis during this period. Over- all, although we are unaware of any study on the real estate market in Ptolemaic Egypt, it stands to reason that urban real es- tate in Memphis would have been expensive. 21 For the possible interpretations of this phrase, see below. 22 Peter Van Minnen, "Euergetism in Graeco-Roman Egypt" in L. Mooren (ed.), Politics, Administration and Society in the Hellenistic and Roman World. Proceedings of the International Colloquium, Bertinoro 19-24 July 1997 (Leuven 2000), 437-469 [esp. 444-453] does suggest that private benefactors played a role in Ptolemaic religious affairs, though one quite secondary to that of the king, and tended to be limited to civic contexts, whether the shrine or cult was Egyptian or Greek in origin. One important example of such a benefactor to Greek and Egyptian temples alike is that of Kallikrates of Samos (for whom see note to /. 1). J. Quaegebeur argues that the Egyptian priests served as the principal benefactors for their temples but were mainly dependent upon royal revenue and fiscal privileges for their economic position (Jan Quaegebeur, "Documents egyptiens et role economique du clerge en Egypte hellenistique" in Edward Lipinski [ed.], State and Temple Economy in the Ancient Near East: Proceedings of the International Conference Organized hy the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven from the</page><page sequence="16">1 84 G.H. Renberg and WS. Bubelis ests within the traditional Egyptian temples, amidst broader economic and political shifts, these com- plexes remained in the control of (wealthy) native Egyptians who administered them upon largely tradi- tional lines.23 Whereas Egyptian priesthoods remained firmly in the hereditary control of prominent families, Zoi- los's proposal requires a priest to be selected and installed. Even if this new priesthood were hereditary, as were most priesthoods both in traditionally Greek areas of the Mediterranean and Egypt, the priest presumably would have functioned without the administrative apparatus and plethora of offices that typi- fied Egyptian religious complexes. It is unlikely, furthermore, that the priest would have come from the great Sarapieion at nearby Saqqara, since if that were the case we could expect that its priests would or- ganize the whole affair, quite likely with the king's direct or indirect involvement, and have no need to call upon Apollonios.24 Likewise, Zoilos promises that he - and no one else - will administer the sanc- tuary's foundation in conjunction with Apollonios (//. 23-24: aDV87riaxaTiiaco yap syob naai toutou;), and thus by extension to relieve Apollonios of all burdens but the minimum benefaction required to establish the cult in a suitable manner. Yet, it is unclear from Zoilos's letter whether the role of epistates would have been needed once construction was finished - and, if so, whether Zoilos intended to continue in that capacity and remain in Memphis. In short, Zoilos appeals to Apollonios not to found a Sarapieion at Memphis that might mirror the one atop the Saqqara bluff, but rather one to be run along traditionally Greek, and not Egyptian, adminis- trative lines. Unfortunately, since virtually nothing is known about the administration of the cult of Sarapis in Egypt at this time, including the ethnicity of the god's priests, it is impossible to determine how such an arrangement typically would have been handled during the cult's early years.25 Moreover, 10th to the 14th of April 1978 [Leuven 1979], 11:707-729, at 714-717). Thompson (1988), 114-125, provides a further dis- cussion of royal euergetism. 23 On Egyptian priests and the level (or, quality) of Ptolemaic oversight, see Janet H.

Finally, Werner Huss, Der Makedonische Konig und die agyptischen Priester: Studien zur Geschichte des ptolemaischen Agypten Historia Einzelschriften 85 (Stuttgart 1994), 41-58, elucidates the uneasy dependence of the king upon the priests for social and political support, in return for which the king customarily granted or renewed privileges and bestowed material support (though with some restrictions, pp. 58-68); cf. W. Huss, "Gedanken zum Thema 'Staat und Kirche' im ptolemaiischen Agypten" in Jakob Seibert (ed.), Hellenis- tische Studien: Gedenkschrift fiir Hermann Bengtson (Munchen 1991), 55-60. 24 For the probable relevance of Saqqara for our understanding of the Zoilos papyrus, see Sect. III. 25 As noted by Fraser (1972), 1:264, no inscriptions are known from this period that record the names of priests of Sara- pis in Alexandria, and more than three decades later this still holds true, making it impossible to determine the ethnic makeup of those serving Sarapis during the first century of his cult. Elsewhere in Egypt, the evidence for priests and cult officials of Sarapis during the early Ptolemaic Period is likewise negligible: an undated letter from the Zenon Archive was written by a priest (ispsuc;) of Isis and Sarapis with the Egyptian name Phemmenas (Osmnsvaq), but since he refers to his Isieion ( PSI V 539, /. 5: sv ion c^icoi 'Igisico[i]) the importance of Sarapis at the site appears to have been secondary, while a Greco-Demotic</page><page sequence="17">The Epistolary Rhetoric ofZoilos of Aspendos: Re-reading P. Cairo Zen. 1 59034 185 there is the question of whether or not Apollonios could take part in such a foundational act as establish- ing a new priesthood without acknowledging the superior ritual position of the king, as well as the ques- tion of whether the king would have played more than his traditional, nominal role as high(est) priest. Since Zoilos neither claims to have royal support nor appeals to Apollonios to secure that support or authorization in due time, it appears to have been understood that Apollonios would be the one to ap- proach the king, and that the latter' s support was not in question. Without the direct financial and politi- cal support of the king, the cult would probably not have access to the nexus of financial, legal, and ad- ministrative resources that was a hallmark of traditional Egyptian cults. At a minimum, the new cult would require either the constant donation of subsidies or, more likely, major one-time gifts of land or other capital with which it could raise income directly. Since an absence of such support would surely doom the project, it is conceivable that Zoilos imagines that Apollonios would be interested and able to help personally even if unable to secure royal support. A letter and two accounts reflecting Apollonios 's own religious activity raise the possibility that Zoilos had good reason to expect Apollonios to shoulder such burdens personally. The letter, written by Apollonios to Zenon, tells his manager that he has given instructions for a Sarapieion to be constructed in Philadelphia near the Isieion and temple of the Dioskouroi, and instructs him to make sure that this is accomplished.26 Though dating a year or two after the Zoilos letter, Apollonios's letter demonstrates his willingness to undertake such a building project himself. The two accounts, on the other hand, show his support for existing sanctuaries. A fragmentary account (P. Mich . 131 [c. 256/55 B.C.]) that perhaps dates to the year or so following Zoilos' s letter shows that Apollonios had assigned (/. 4: Kaxa|i8|i8Tpr|v- xai) 240 arouras of his land (/. 1 : xfjq 'AtioAIcoviod yfjq) to support jointly the cults of Sarapis and Askle- pios, an amount twice that which the same papyrus shows he designated for the support of Zeus Labraundaios, and significantly more than the five arouras awarded to a keeper of sacred ibises (/. 8). 27 Although there is no basis upon which to identify this particular cult and sanctuary with that of Zoilos 's letter, the account does show that Apollonios supported other cults with land in his possession (i.e. as Scoped from the king), and not necessarily as part of his service as dioiketes. The account also stipulates that Apollonios himself, through his own letters rather than an agent working on his behalf, was the im- surety contract from the Arsinoite nome dating to 224 B.C. is written by a nakoros of Sarapis with the Greek name Achilles son of Dioskourides (SB XVI. 1, 12414). Also, an undated inscription that is most likely to date to the later years of the Ptole- maic period records that a priest of Sarapis and possibly Isis with the Greek name Lupcov, whose home is unrecorded, visited her temple at Philae (/. Philae I 85). Moreover, as Fraser points out, at sanctuaries outside of Egypt the priests were typically Greek. A tantalizing exception is the original priest of Sarapis on Delos, described by his grandson in the famous "Delian Aretalogy of Sarapis" as "Apollonios, an Egyptian from the priestly order" ( IG XI.4, 1299 [see n. 59], /. 3: 'A7toM,(6vio&lt;;, cov Alyu7ruio&lt;; ek tcov iepecov), who hailed from Memphis (//. 37-38). The reference to his being "from the priestly order" suggests ties to Saqqara and Osorapis, raising the question of whether Apollonios arrived at Delos bringing with him this god and over time the cult shifted from the worship of Osorapis to that of Sarapis, or if from the beginning it was solely the Hellenized god Sarapis whom he introduced to the island. (For this issue of the cult's Hellenization, see Sect. III.l.) It is at least curious that none of the worshipers whose names are preserved in the earliest inscriptions from the Delian Sarapieia have Egyptian names, perhaps signaling a purely Hellenized cult, but these all post-date the god's arrival by several decades. (Although the year of Apollonios's arrival is unknown, it is clear that this occurred in the middle of the 3rd cent. B.C. [see Helmut Engel- mann, The Delian Aretalogy of Sarapis EPRO 44 (Leiden 1975), 13-14], most likely post-dating Zoilos's letter. Therefore, if the dioiketes Apollonios did build a Sarapieion in Memphis, it is at least possible that the priest Apollonios had some associa- tion with it before setting off for Delos.) 26 P. CairZen. II 59168 (April 27, 256 or 255 B.C.); see Holbl (1993), 23-24 and Pfeiffer (2008), 403-405. Regrettably, the letter preserves no information regarding whether Zenon, who unlike Zoilos was intimately involved with Apollonios's business affairs, would have played a role in the sanctuary's oversight once it had been completed. Likewise, this letter is silent on whether Zenon would have profited from his assigned role, as Zoilos evidently desired for himself. 27 Scholars sometimes regard the papyrus as referring to a single god, Sarapis-Asklepios, since there is no conjunction written between the two names. However, the evidence for Sarapis and Asklepios being conflated is limited, dates to Roman times, and comes from beyond Egypt. Moreover, the cult of Zeus Labraundaios was to receive half as much support, so it stands to reason that in this case the cults of Sarapis and Asklepios were distinct. Since the undivided land was meant to sup- port both of these gods they probably were worshiped as (juwaoi 0eoi (suggested by L. Koenen). The provenience of the pa- pyrus is unknown, but the Carian god suggests Philadelphia or the Memphis area (see Rigsby, forthcoming [supra n. 16]).</page><page sequence="18">1 86 G.H. Renberg and W.S. Bubelis mediate source of authority for the arrangements that it details (//. 5-6: Kara xaq rcapa AtoM-owiou 87riaio^dq). Moreover, another account that is slightly later than Zoilos's letter shows that Apollonios distributed two kotylai of oil to a man responsible for lighting lamps at the Saqqara Sarapieion coincid- ing with his own visit to the sanctuary, a possible reflection of Apollonios' s personal piety.28 Given such activity and financial support, it is not difficult to see why Zoilos might think it appropriate to concede that Apollonios's expenses for the proposed shrine would indeed be significant (//. 21-22: juri Kaxa7rX,a- yfjiq [cov] to aviiA,co|ia cbq ano jieya^riq aoi danavr{q | soojusvriq). In sum, Zoilos's vision of the new Sarapieion in the Greek neighborhood or agora at Memphis appears to straddle the realities of royal support for Egyptian cults by indicating expectations or hopes that Apollonios could play the role of a foundational benefactor in a manner befitting a more typically Greek context. That Apollonios has a strong personal stake in the matter, notwithstanding those realities, comes to the fore in Zoilos' rhetorical strategy. Zoilos frames Apollonios' desired involvement as anything but that of a neutral party who might grant money and support but would lose nothing by remaining unin- volved. Zoilos avoids making a straightforward request, instead insinuating that Apollonios faces a criti- cal choice: if he provides the necessary resources, Sarapis will treat him especially well, but if not he risks receiving much the same treatment as Zoilos (treatment Zoilos will be freed from now that he is placing the burden on Apollonios). Zoilos recognizes that the cost is a potentially major obstacle to ful- filling the god's instructions, but places the burden of his appeal on the personal welfare of Apollonios, and in a manner that far exceeds what surviving requests for religious support typically offer. The letter of the priests of Aphrodite, for example, promises that Isis will grant Apollonios "favor before the king" (P. Zen.Pestm. 50, /. 6: auxrj 5e aoi 5oir| 87ia(ppo5iaiav 7ip[6&lt;; xov Paai]^sa) as a result of fulfilling their demands, just as the priests of Astarte wish for Zenon ( PSI V 531, 11. 1-2: ooi 7iapa ifji 'Aaidprni 5oi)vai aoi | 87i[acppo5iaiav 7tpo](; xov Paailsa), but otherwise neither group elaborates upon or repeats the wish.29 Yet as far as administrative details go, Zoilos claims that it is necessary, not merely desirable, that the priest at this new sanctuary personally sacrifice on behalf of Apollonios, pos- sibly in addition to his family (//. 7-8: i[epea] 87iiqxax8iv K[ai] | 87ri(3cojiiC8iv vntp i^cov).30 Since the term 87ii(3co|i{C8iv locates the priest as the immediate officiant before the altar, rather than allowing a less prominent worshiper to make the offering, Zoilos concedes a privileged status to Apollonios.31 The of- fering was thus not inconsequential or trivial, but in Zoilos's reckoning the personal cost to Apollonios will be more than made up by the personal benefit that the project will initiate and sustain. Zoilos does not lay out the issue of cost in a discrete and self-contained section, but subtly builds a case throughout the letter that he alone is in the position to realize those benefits for Apollonios, pro- vided only that Apollonios makes the right decision in supporting his request. Zoilos appears not only to 2^ P. Corn. 1 , 11. 78-80 (257 B.C.): 'E^svcoi zni ^aja7ixfipa op0pou | avapaivovxoq 'AtioXXcoviod | elq to Xapa7U8iov ko(xu- Xm) p. Apollonios's visit to the Sarapieion appears to have predated the arrival of Zoilos's letter by just two weeks ( UPZ I, pp. 451-452 and Pestman [1981], 265; see Appendix). On the question of Apollonios's piety, see also Thompson (1988), 148. 29 The same sort of wishes, for an official's favor before the king and queen as granted by Sarapis and Isis, are also found in papyri from the archive of Ptolemaios from the Saqqara Sarapieion , in which Ptolemaios begs the official for help in a matter involving distribution (owra^ic;) of oil ( UPZ I 33-36, of 162/61 B.C.; cf. Thompson [1988], 244n.209). In a petition from Busiris, an Egyptian priest and prophet of Harpsenesis and Sarapis lodges the same kind of complaint and invokes the same wish for the relevant officer ( BGU IV 1 197; 5/4 B.C.). Edgar has rightly pointed out the ambiguity of ujicdv in this context (P. Edg. 7, at p. 176). S. Pfeiffer, also noting the problematic nature of this passage while interpreting imsp ujxcov as solely "on behalf of Apollonios," states that since sacri- fices at temples were normally made "on behalf of the king" in this case "the dioiketes of the king had assumed a royal posi- tion in the temple" (Pfeiffer [2008], 396-397). In conveying this aspect of the god's instructions, therefore, Zoilos may well have been adding flattery to his rhetorical arsenal, if Pfeiffer's interpretation is correct. 31 Hesykhios (s.v. s7iipcofiiCovxr Bvovxi) equates one performing this action with the sacrificer himself, just as other texts also suggest (e.g. H. Hepding, "Die Arbeiten zu Pergamon. II. Die Inschriften" AthMitt 35 (1910), 401-493 [esp. 454- 457, No. 39 (Pergamon)]; cf. Lysim. FHG vol. Ill fr., la apud Jos., Ap. 1 .(34).307). In addition, the stem is frequently associ- ated with supplication (e.g. Eur., Heracl. 44; cf. IG XII. 9, 21), which confirms that the verb indicates immediate proximity to an altar.</page><page sequence="19">The Epistolary Rhetoric ofZoilos ofAspendos: Re-reading P. Cairo Zen. 1 59034 187 offer Apollonios an opportunity to invest in his own prosperity, but, according to one way of reading of the letter, also to warn him of the consequences of failing to heed Sarapls. Zoilos does this by relating his own personal interactions with the deity, who mandates a certain course of action through dreams and ensures compliance by causing bodily suffering when disobeyed (//. 9-12, 16-18). Moreover, Zoilos goes on to suggest that Sarapis's orders do not merely affect Apollonios in his official capacity but di- rectly concern his well-being: if the god has sickened a mere messenger like Zoilos, the epistle seems to imply, what might he do to Apollonios for failing to carry out the god's wishes now that he knows them?

Zoilos contin- ues by stating that if Apollonios accedes to Sarapis's 7cpoaxdy|LiaTa, the god will be "merciful" (/. 19: Evxkaxoq) toward him - a term which often means "propitious," but quite possibly is used here not to claim that the god will be Apollonios's benefactor, but rather that he will not be his tormentor.32 The notion of Sarapis being "merciful" to one who ultimately heeds him can be compared to the im- precation in a well-known magical papyrus from Saqqara, dating to the late fourth century B.C., by means of which a woman named Artemisia calls upon Sarapis's forerunner Osorapis and the other gods of the Sarapieion to punish her deceased daughter's father "so that he will not find mercy" (/. 8: |ir|88 ilaovoc; ruxavoi) from them because of his impious behavior.33 Likewise, several curse tablets from Hel- lenistic Knidos call upon Demeter not to be smXam to the target; in one text, the accursed need only meet a certain condition, the return of stolen clothing, to receive divine favor once again.34 In this and other texts of the period, the term seems to point to an emotional state of a deity in which divine anger is something to be averted, if not replaced by some form of help or encouragement, or it at least implies the absence of punishment or further suffering.35 In the Septuagint , too, the term and related verb are used in 3^ With the recent exception of "merciful" being employed in Pfeiffer (2008) - though without explanation - previous studies of the Zoilos papyrus have overlooked the potential reading of su&amp;axoc; as referring to Apollonios's avoidance of a punishment, instead translating it in English as "gracious" (Rigsby [2001]), in French as "favorable" (C. Zen. Palestine) or "propice" (Clary sse- Vandorpe [1995]; Borgeaud- Volokhine [2000]; R1CIS ), and in German as "wohlgeneigt" (Deissmann [1923]). Since there are several instances of the word being employed in the sense of "propitious," as well as comparable uses of the Latin propitius , this remains a possible reading of the Zoilos papyrus, but both the context and Zoilos 's rhetoric suggest the alternative reading proposed here. For an important discussion of smXaioq, propitius and other relevant terms, see Henk S. Versnel, "'May he not be able to sacrifice...': Concerning a Curious Formula in Greek and Latin Curses," ZPE 58 (1985), 247-269, at 260-261. UPZ 11+ add. pp. 646-647 (= Pap. Graec. Mag. XL); cf.

For the relationship between Osorapis and the Hellenized god Sarapis, as well as the worship of the former at Saqqara, see Sect. Ill .i. As was demonstrated by Robert K. Ritner ("Implicit Models of Cross-Cultural Interaction: A Question of Noses, Soap, and Prejudice," in J.H. Johnson [ed.], Life in a Multi- Cultural Society: Egypt from Cambyses to Constantine and Beyond SAOC 51 (Chicago 1992), 283-290, at 289), Artemisia's appeal appears to show the influence of Demotic petitions to the gods (now collected in P. Gotterbriefe ), but the letter also contains several Greek elements (see Modrzejewski, ibid.). Therefore, it is unclear whether her emphasis on the denial of mercy as divine punishment reflects an Egyptian approach to cursing or else a Greek mindset. The latter cannot be ruled out, not only because of Artemisia's ethnicity, but also since the earliest example of a Greek defixio that cites injustices as justifi- cation for the curse is thought to be an Athenian lead tablet also from the late-fourth century B.C. ( SEG 55, 324; cf. Versnel [2010], 311-312). 34 I. Knidos 152; cf. 154, 158. The clearest example of the term is that of I. Knidos 151, in which the accursed should fail to obtain as a patron Demeter or any of the gods associated with her (11. 4-5: juri xuxoi emXd|[xoD] |if| Ad(ia{|Lia}Tpo(; {Aajaaxpoc;} jiti 0ecov tcdv rcapa Aajiaipi; cf.

Renberg and W.S. Bubelis reference to God's being merciful (Muraoka, LexSept ., 300, s.v. "8i)itaxTO&lt;;," "em^aieucD''). The "mercy" thus seems to be a residual quality of the deity in what is a fundamentally asymmetrical relationship: by giving offense the worshipper loses divine protection against sickness, evil spirits, and the loss of status. Two enteuxis petitions by Egyptian women concerning shrines over which they had authority pro- vide a telling contrast with Zoilos's proposal and use of narrative. In the longer and more complete document, Epoeris, a priestess-administrator of a temple of Isis (laiovojioq) at the village of Athenas Kome in the Arsinoite nome, wrote to the authorities out of concern for the state of her shrine.36 Adher- ing to the approach typical of most enteuxis petitions, in which requests for action by a strategos and other local authorities were addressed to the king as a formality,37 she asks that Ptolemy III instruct the strategos to inspect the situation and, if she is found to be telling the truth, to support the shrine's demo- lition and reconstruction under her control. The letter also records the orders given to an officer to con- duct the inquiry just as Epoeris requested, accompanied by the local epistates and komogrammateus . In contrast to Zoilos's letter she offers only a brief summary of the situation, noting that the shrine has be- come so dilapidated that she fears for her safety because of the likelihood of a collapse (//. 2-3: i)nap%£i jnoi 'IgisTov..., o oDjiPsPriKev 1 7C87iov8K8vai Kai 5ia touto [ir' 5waa0ai ev apical KaxayiveaBai, cpoPoDjji- vr| [ir' ai)|i7i8ar|i). Although Epoeris promises sacrifices on behalf of the king and royal family, the letter does not deviate from the point of her request: to receive royal permission to demolish her shrine and to rebuild it. Just as this isionomos does not cite a divine cause for the current state of the shrine or equivo- cate about its costs, she likewise avoids invoking the gods as her patron's benefactors. If, in fact, she did intend to request something in the way of financial support from the king, this curt petition betrays no sense of her own willingness to be held, in effect, legally or financially accountable in return, and fea- tures nothing more than the customary formulae of respect. Zoilos, in contrast, seems to have no firm expectation whatsoever that Apollonios will pay for the Sarapieion without assurances of his loyalty and competence. The other enteuxis petition, which can only be read in part because of serious damage to the papyrus but was obviously quite similar to that of Epoeris, indicates that a woman named Smithis who served in some capacity at an unidentified temple in or near Magdola had written Ptolemy IV and the same strategos seeking permission to demolish and reconstruct it.38 The surviving text suggests that this letter followed closely that of Epoeris in form and content, and therefore likewise avoided the personal approach that Zoilos used when writing to Apollonios. The sum of the contrast between these documents and Zoilos' communication thus lies in how Zoilos crafts an epistolary rhetoric whose intimate content and sophistication belie his lack of official standing - from an opening which claims important connec- tions, to the cautionary narrative that illustrates the need to heed Sarapis's wishes, to the conclusion ex- is best paralleled by Ptolemaic petitions to those in high office (Jordan, SGD 60; cf. John Gager, Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient World [New York 1992], 165-167; Versnel [1991], 69-70, and Versnel [2010], 334-336). H. W. Pleket, "Religious History as the History of Mentality: The 'Believer' as Servant of the Deity in the Greek World," in H.S. Versnel [ed.], Faith, Hope and Worship: Aspects of Religious Mentality in the Ancient World Studies in Greek and Roman Religion 2 (Leiden 1981), 152-192, at 189-192, argues that the conceptual language of this text, especially in connection with this key term, does not render it the product of oriental influence. Also pertinent is an oracle question from Egypt, probably of the second century B.C., in which the petitioner - who represents himself as the gods' slave (/. 3: ujiSTSpou 5ou^[ou]) - asks the gods to be "merciful" to him and his children (//. 8-9: eveiXaxoi jioi Kai loiq | tskvou; jiou ysv6|isvo[i]), since they have fallen on hard times and wish to know when their fortunes will change (SB XVI 12677).

Cairo Zen. 1 59034 189 pressing his concern for Apollonios's well-being and emphasizing the potential benefits of pleasing the god. Section III: The Zoilos Papyrus and the Cult of Sar apis at Memphis and Saqqara i. The Significance of Zoilos' s Proposed Sarapieion A closer examination of the Zoilos papyrus yields not only new insights into the author's rhetorical ap- proach and apparent personal goals, as discussed in the previous section, but also the religious milieu in which it was written. Since its publication, this letter has been recognized as one of the most detailed sources of information for the spread of the cult of Sarapis, but as it was thought to pertain to a site out- side of Egypt it was treated as evidence for the cult's proliferation beyond the god's native land. In light of two relatively recent articles that appeared around the same time, the study by Kent J. Rigsby placing Zoilos and his Sarapieion in Memphis and one by Philippe Borgeaud and Youri Volokhine regarding the cult's origin, it is necessary to reevaluate the papyrus now that it can be viewed as a source for the ex- pansion of Sarapis's worship within Egypt.39 As such a fresh look reveals, this document is of great in- terest not only because of the roles possibly played by Zoilos and Apollonios in the spread of the cult, but also because of the issues it raises concerning the god's worship at Memphis. Of particular signifi- cance is that Zoilos appears to have been proposing not a minor shrine consisting primarily of an altar and intended for a small group of worshipers, but rather a sanctuary at which members of the Greek and Macedonian community could worship the Hellenized god Sarapis in his own right, and without having to journey an hour out of town to the sanctuary of his Egyptian forerunner, as the native population and assimilated members of the Helleno-Memphite community were doing.40 If Zoilos 's letter does indeed address the need for a Sarapieion in Memphis, he would have received his dreams at the only known place where he could have been "paying worship to the god Sarapis" (/. 3): the nearby " Sarapieion " (or pr-Wsi r -Hp , "House of Osiris- Apis," in Demotic) that was situated atop the Saqqara bluff west of the city. This large complex, which played a central role in the religious life of Memphis beginning under the Pharaohs, was associated primarily with the burial vaults of the Apis bulls and worship of Osorapis (i.e. Osiris-Apis), Sarapis's native Egyptian precursor.41 This, in turn, would mean that the Zoilos papyrus should be included among the earliest documents to show an ethnic or culturally Greek individual worshiping Sarapis at Saqqara as a Hellenized god 42 One of the central questions regarding the cult of Sarapis in Egypt is to what extent native Egyptians recognized and worshiped this Hellenized god, represented throughout the Mediterranean world as a bearded figure wearing Greek garb, rather than his antecedent, the divinized bull-god who blended elements of both Apis and Osiris. Though the evidence is scanty, it appears that while at least some Hellenes living in Egypt would willingly worship the native Osorapis as "Sarapis," the Egyptians themselves showed little 39 Rigsby (2001); Borgeaud- Volokhine (2000). Borgeaud and Volokhine argue for Memphis rather than Alexandria having been the cult's point of origin, a position partly anticipated by Anna Swiderek ("Sarapis et les Hellenomemphites," in J. Bingen, G. Cambier &amp; G. Nachtergael (eds.), Le monde grec: Hommages a Claire Preaux [Brussels 1975], 670-675). Rig- sby 's article for the first time argues against the long-accepted conclusion of Edgar that Zoilos had received his dreams of Sarapis in an unidentified coastal city and sailed across the eastern Mediterranean to Alexandria, which necessitates a reap- praisal of this document's significance for the study of the cult of Sarapis (see note to /. 5). 4^ On this Helleno-Memphite population, which dated back to the Ionian mercenaries who settled in Memphis in the late-6th century B.C., see Thompson (1988), 95-97; for ethnic minorities in Memphis in general, see ibid., pp. 82-105. Several other divinities were also worshiped and their sacred animals buried at this extensive site.

Bubelis interest in worshiping this anthropomorphic god instead of their own, especially when Sarapis' s cult was still young.43 Telling evidence for the latter can be found in a second-century B.C. Demotic ostrakon from the Hor Archive in which this servant of Thoth at Saqqara records himself seeking prophetic dreams by invoking both Osorapis and Osormnevis, a similarly divinized form of the Heliopolitan Mnevis bull. Since the latter had no known Hellenized equivalent at the time (or later), it is almost certain that in Hor's mind he was calling upon two traditional native gods, not one Greco-Egyptian and one Egyptian god.44 That the Macedonians and other Hellenes, in contrast, associated Osorapis with Sarapis is demon- strated at the center of Sarapis worship itself, the great Sarapieion at Alexandria: a series of foundation deposit plaques recording the establishment of the Sarapieion by Ptolemy III and of a shrine to Harpok- rates by Ptolemy IV includes several bilingual inscriptions that name "Sarapis" in the Greek text and "Osorapis" in the hieroglyphic text 45 Further evidence for this phenomenon comes from Saqqara itself, where despite abundant archaeological and documentary sources there is no evidence for the official in- stallation of the Hellenized god Sarapis, but nevertheless Greeks visiting or living at Osorapis 's Sara- pieion left records that they were worshiping "Sarapls."46 While it is impossible for us to know what would have influenced Zoilos's subconscious mind, it could have been this lack of an official cult of Sarapis at the Sarapieion that led to the dreams calling for 43 See Fraser (1960), 5-9, 18-20; cf. Borgeaud- Volokhine (2000), 60 and W. Clary sse and M.C.D. Paganini, "Theo- phoric Personal Names in Graeco-Roman Egypt: The Case of Sarapis," AfP 55 (2009), 68-89, at 78-80. 44 O. Hor 13; cf. O. Hor 1 . A comparable example from Saqqara, though dating more than a half century later, would be the reference in three papyri to an apxevxacpiaoxriq 'Ooop(X7tioc; Kal 'OaopjiviiODioq, i.e. the head of the embalming guild of Osorapis and Osormnevis, with the Egyptian name Petesis, son of Chonouphis (UPZ I 106-108; see Thompson [1988], 186- 188). On Mnevis and Osormnevis, see Eberhard Otto, Beitrage zur Geschichte der Stierkulte in Aegypten Untersuchungen zur Geschichte und Altertumskunde Agyptens 13 (Leipzig 1938), 34-40 and LexAg.

A papyrus from Soknopaiou Nesos that refers to a tspov Xapa7ii5oc; 'Oaop|iviiouioc; shows that by the 2nd century A.D., at least at this site, the god Osormnevis appears to have been reduced to an epithet of Sarapis, but there is no evidence of this from Hor's era (P.

Chr. IFAO Etudes alexandrines 15 (Cairo 2008). 46 Of particular interest are the Greek graffiti written by worshipers of Sarapis and Isis (identified with the Mother-of- Apis at Saqqara), some of whom were contemporaries of Apollonios and Zoilos ( SEG 49, 2260, 2261, 2301, 2314, 2315, and possibly 2313, dating c. 275-175 B.C.). All of the graffiti naming one or both gods were left by individuals with Greek names, though the matter is complicated by the fact that other Greek graffiti making no reference to any gods were written by worshipers with Egyptian names. For a discussion of some of these texts, see Georges Nachtergael, "Graffites du Sarapieion de Memphis," CdE 74 (1999), 344-356. Further examples of Greek inscriptions pertaining to Sarapis as well as relevant De- motic texts may appear in the two volumes currently being prepared for publication by John D. Ray, Demotic, Hieroglyphic and Greek Inscriptions from the Sacred Animal Necropolis, North Saqqara and Demotic Ostraca from North Saqqara. A related phenomenon seems to be indicated by an inscription from Taposiris Parva, located in the Delta region between Alexandria and Canopus, that dates to 205-181 B.C. and records the private dedication of an altar and persea trees to "Osoro (i.e. Ws - 7 r , "Osiris the great"), who also is Sarapis, and Isis and Anubis" ('Oaopco xe | Kal Xapa7ii5i Kal "IaiSt | Kal Xvou- PiSt, 08oic; | 7taoi Kal 7td&lt;jai&lt;;, tojli | Pcojxov Kal xac; Tiepasac;) ( OGIS I 97; cf.

The address to "Osoro" reveals that the worshipers who made this dedication had in mind Osiris, while the conjunc- tive phrase xe Kai, which is extremely rare in dedicatory inscriptions in the context of listing gods (PHI database search, 9/11/ 2010), appears to show a close identification between this god and Sarapis but also some amount of distinction between the two (see Fraser 11972], 1:252-253, 11:40 lnn.487-488; cf. Borgeaud- Volokhine [2000], 60-61). Unfortunately, it is impossi- ble to know whether these worshipers were Greeks or Egyptians, especially since the name Paris could be born by an Egyp- tian. (For the possibility that the otherwise unattested name of the primary dedicant, E7iapi&lt;;, is ndptq preceded by a stone- cutting error, see Fraser, ibid., II:429n.688.)

Cairo Zen. 1 59034 191 a new Sarapieion , along with a priesthood devoted to the god, to be established "in the Greek (market- place / neighborhood ?) near the harbor" (/. 7: bv xfji fEAlr|viKfii rcpoq xcoi A,i|j£v[i]). As a native of Aspendos or descendant of an Aspendian and thus ethnically or at least culturally Greek, and also as one who had or sought ties to the royal court, Zoilos most likely would have been worshiping Sarapis as a Hellenized god when he was at Saqqara "paying worship to the god Sarapis on behalf of [Apollonios' s] health and success with King Ptolemy" (11. 2-4). 47 If he did not already have a cult site there that remains unre- corded, this Hellenized god was one in need of a sanctuary within the city of Memphis itself. In his arti- cle on the Zoilos papyrus proposing Memphis as the site destined to receive this Sarapieion , Rigsby suggests that general displeasure over how the Egyptian priests officiating at Saqqara treated Greek wor- shipers may have created the need for a sanctuary at which the Greeks could worship the god in the manner to which they were accustomed (Rigsby [2001], 122-123). To this can be added the possibility that relations between Egyptians and non-Egyptians living at Saqqara sometimes got tense, which per- haps would have made a Sarapieion that was relatively free of native Egyptians quite welcome to the Greeks.48 But such differences with Egyptians who were serving or working at Saqqara would seem a less important motive for establishing a new sanctuary than the desire many members of the Greek- speaking ethnic minorities presumably would have felt for a sanctuary at which Sarapis could be wor- shiped as a Greek (or, more precisely, Greco-Egyptian) god and in a Greek manner. And, as Zoilos's let- ter reveals, he was not the first to sense the need for a Sarapieion ev xfji 'EAlriviKfji, since he tells of a man from Knidos beginning such a construction project but being forced by the god to abandon his plan (11. 12-15). In establishing the new Sarapieion , therefore, Apollonios would not only have been fostering the spread of the cult of Sarapis, but also providing a viable alternative for those residents of Memphis wishing to worship this god rather than the unassimilated Egyptian god 49 For this to have been the case, the cult site proposed by Zoilos need not have been an especially large complex, but it would have had to suit the needs of Memphis 's Greek and Macedonian population. This raises the question of how best to restore the lacuna at the end of the papyrus 's sixth line, where Zoilos originally specified at least one structure or object that Sarapis wanted Apollonios to include in 47 If Zoilos did indeed come from Aspendos (see note to /. 1), it is unclear whether he would have become a devotee of Sarapis while still in Pamphylia rather than elsewhere in Asia Minor or the Mediterranean world, or else Egypt itself. Al- though no evidence of the worship of the Egyptian gods that predates the Roman period has been found in Pamphylia (see Bricault, Atlas , p. 69), it is likely that the cult of Sarapis had penetrated the region by the mid-third century B.C., due to the close connection between the Ptolemies and Aspendos, many of whose citizens served them as soldiers or officials (see Christopher P. Jones and Christian Habicht, "A Hellenistic Inscription from Arsinoe in Cilicia," Phoenix 43 [1989], 317-346 [esp. 337-338]). (For the spread of the cult of Sarapis outside of Egypt, see Fraser [1960], 20-49; cf. Borgeaud- Volokhine [2000], 59 et pass.) 4^ The evidence for strained relations between Egyptians and non-Egyptians residing at Saqqara comes from claims by the "recluse" Ptolemaios that he was attacked twice by local Egyptians because of his Greek ethnicity ( UPZ 17,//. 13-14 and 8, /. 14), though alternative explanations for this violence are available (see Thompson [1987], 116; Thompson [1988], 229- 230; Koen Goudriaan Ethnicity in Ptolemaic Egypt Dutch Monographs on Ancient History and Archaeology 5 (Amsterdam 1988), 42-57; Ludwig Koenen, "The Ptolemaic King as a Religious Figure," in A. Bulloch et al. [eds.], Images and Ideolo- gies: Self-definition in the Hellenistic World [Berkeley, Los Angeles &amp; London 1993], 25-1 15, at 36-38; and, Anne-Emma-n- uelle Vei'sse, "Les identites multiples de Ptolemaios, fils de Glaukias," AncSoc 37 (2007), 69-87, at 83-85). Regardless of where the truth lay in these two instances, the fact that Ptolemaios would blame his misfortunes on ethnic tensions when re- porting these events to the authorities shows the inherent plausibility of such claims. 49 Only three sites, Alexandria, Athens and Delos, are known to have had multiple Sarapieia in Ptolemaic times, and only at Alexandria can this be detected by the mid-third century B.C., since epigraphical and literary evidence reveal that there were at least two privately funded Sarapieia during this period in addition to the famed Rhakotis sanctuary established by the Ptolemies (see Fraser [1972], 1:270-273; see below for /. Alex.Ptol. 5, the dedicatory inscription from one of these sites). At Delos, on the other hand, first the small Sarapieia A and B were privately built, but a few decades later the far lar- ger Sarapieion C was established as a public sanctuary. If Apollonios actually heeded Zoilos's message and built the Sara- pieion then the Memphis area would belong in this list (even if the complex at Saqqara was not a typical Sarapieion). Unfor- tunately, it is impossible to know whether it would have been the first within the city itself, or if other individuals, as at Alex- andria, had already established shrines or sanctuaries of Sarapls.</page><page sequence="24">192 G.H. Renter g and W.S. Bubelis the temenos (see note to /. 6). While Rigsby's proposed [pcojiov xe] Kai xsjisvoq is certainly possible, it does not suit the apparent situation, as analyzed in Section II: not only would a sacred precinct with nothing more than an altar have gained less prestige for Apollonios as founder, and generated less in- come for Zoilos from overseeing the building project (if he was indeed paid), but it would have been less impressive to the king. Establishing a proper sanctuary with a temple, however, would meet all of the requirements implicit in Zoilos' s letter, and also would have better suited the needs of Memphis' s Greek-speaking population, and thus a restoration of [ vaov is] Kai tsjusvoc; seems best, as discussed above. Therefore, even though there are comparanda to support a restoration of (3co|i6v is Kai T8|ievo&lt;;, the apparent circumstances of the letter's composition as well as the comparanda for [ vaov is] Kai xejievoq (or perhaps [vaov is pcojiov is Kai] isjievoq) suggest that Zoilos was urging Apollonios to build a temple within a sacred precinct that he was to purchase and consecrate to Sarapls. Such a restoration is also supported by the fact that Zoilos refers to the man from Knidos assembling building materials and beginning to construct a Sarapieion in the location Sarapis intended for Apollonios 's sanctuary. While it is impossible to know whether the use of the term Zapa7ii8iov (/. 13) indicates that this Knidian was planning to erect a temple within a sacred precinct rather than a mere altar, the fact that he had gathered stones for the project suggests that he had something more than an altar in mind. In addition, it seems unlikely that the god would have been thought satisfied by such a simple cult site as an enclosure lacking a temple from the wealthy Apollonios, especially if the Knidian had intended a more elaborate complex. Such a sanctuary certainly need not have been on the scale of the Alexandrian Sarapieion or copied its layout; instead, the likeliest parallel would be the well-preserved Sarapieion A on Delos, which featured a small temple, altars, banqueting areas, and porticoes, and is most likely typical of early, privately funded Sarapieia .50 This original Delian sanctuary was modest enough to have just a single priest offici- ating, just as Zoilos proposed in his letter - perhaps an indication of the scale Zoilos intended.51 While we do not know whether Apollonios ever heeded Zoilos 's letter, he would have known that the establishment of a Sarapieion was one way of honoring and ingratiating himself with Ptolemy II, as is obvious from the relationship between the Ptolemies and the cult of Sarapls.52 That other prominent figures in Egypt viewed the establishment of Sarapieia with at least some amount of pragmatism is sug- gested by a likely parallel from Alexandria: the dedication of a temenos to Sarapis and Isis in honor of this monarch by the " epistates of Libya," either an official of the Libyan nome or an individual exercis- ing some amount of power in Cyrenaica, along with his wife (imsp PaaiXccoq ITc0^8|uai0D | ioi&gt; ITcoXe- jiiaiOD Kai BepsviKriq | Zcoxiipcov, 'ApxayaGoq 'Aya0o|KAioi)(; STUGTarnq xfjq Aipv|r|(; Kai yuvri ExpaxoviKri | Sapa7ri5i vIai5i to tsjisvoc;) 53 Regardless of which post he held, and at this early point in Ptolemaic 5^ On Sarapieion A, see Bruneau (1970), 459-461 and Philippe Bruneau and Jean Ducat (with M. Brunet, A. Farnoux, and J.-C. Moretti), Guide de Delos (Athens^ 2005), 267-269. As discussed in Sect. Il.ii, Zoilos's Sarapieion most likely would have been constructed of stone rather than simple mud-brick. 51 The privately founded Sarapieion A had a hereditary priesthood (see n. 25), whereas the public and much larger Sarapieion C had a ixptspeuq and other cult personnel in addition to the priest; the cult hierarchy of the other private Egyptian sanctuary, Sarapieion B, is unknown.

Although the conclusion that he was a nome official was adopted in Pros. Ptol. VI 14495 + add. VIII 375b and remains common (e.g. Pfeiffer [2008], 394-395), there is good reason to identify him as a much more important individual, perhaps even the nephew of Cyrenaica' s governor Magas and son of the Syracusan tyrant Agathokles, as was ar- gued most extensively by Roger Bagnall ("Archagathos son of Agathocles, Epistates of Libya," Philologus 120 [1976], 195- 209). Archagathos and his wife most likely gave the two gods more than just an enclosure: whereas dedicatory inscriptions concerning the establishment of a temenos commonly listed at least one structure or cult object that was included within, it was no less acceptable to record the dedication of a temenos alone, with the accompanying dedication of structures and ob-</page><page sequence="25">The Epistolary Rhetoric ofZoilos of Aspendos : Re-reading P. Cairo Zen. 1 59034 193 history it is unclear just what the nature of his administrative role would have been in either case, Arch- agathos was obviously wealthy and prominent, and the inscription shows him using his wealth to gain favor with the king - whether this was his primary intent or would have been an incidental benefit cannot be known - by establishing a sanctuary for Sarapis and Isis. Apollonios may well have done the same after receiving Zoilos's letter, prominently displaying a dedicatory inscription similar to this one. For all of these reasons, then, Zoilos's letter to this dioiketes almost certainly was advising him to establish a sanctuary that, in the words of the dedicatory inscription from Hermoupolis Magna quoted above, featured "id dya^jiaxa Kai xov vaov Kai xa aXka evxoq xou xsjievotx;" (see note to I. 6), and that though not necessarily large was of sufficient scale to suit the local population's needs. It is impossible to know whether, if Apollonios did indeed heed Zoilos's letter, this would have been the first Sarapieion the finance minister established, but it is known that just a year or two later Apollonios gave instructions for one to be built in Philadelphia, the town that he himself had recently founded, as is revealed in one of his letters to Zenon (P. CairZen. II 59168; see n. 26). Whether the letter of Zoilos had increased Apol- lonios 's devotion to Sarapis, perhaps indirectly leading to the establishment of this Philadelphian Sara- pieion , is likewise impossible to know. ii. Zoilos's Dreams and their Cultic Context From the beginning, dreams appear to have held significance for worshipers of Sarapis, especially with regard to the foundation of cult sites.54 As noted above, foundation deposit plaques from the Alexandria Sarapieion record Ptolemy III dedicating xov vaov Kai xo xsiisvoq sometime in the period 246-221 B.C. (see note to 1.6). K similar foundation deposit plaque reveals that an unknown temple (vaoq) of Sarapis was dedicated by the same ruler either in Alexandria or the vicinity, but unlike the other plaques its text employs the formula Kaxa 7rpoaxay|ia to indicate that the dedication was made in compliance with a di- vine command.55 Likewise, Ptolemy IV dedicated the shrine of Harpokrates in the Alexandrian Sara- pieion Kaxa 7cpooxay|ia Eapa7ci5oq Kai "IaiSoq, according to bilingual foundation deposit plaques exca- vated at the site.56 While these divine 7Cpoaxay|naxa could have been issued through some traditional type of oracular consultation, the evidence for the term (along with the related 7cpoaxaaa8iv) also having been used to refer to god-sent dreams - in the Zoilos papyrus, most notably (/. 19: 7rpooxay|iaaiv; 1. 12: 7tpocxacc6|j,8vov) - raises the possibility that both Ptolemies decided to build temples because they be- lieved themselves to have been instructed to do so by Sarapis in a dream 57 While this is by no means certain, the fact that Ptolemy I was supposed to have established the cult of Sarapis in Alexandria fol- lowing a dream - assuming that there is some truth in the later reports - would have led his heirs to place great weight on dreams received from Sarapis, or at least to publicly attribute such actions to dream-oracles from this god.58 As is known from the Delian aretalogy's narrative concerning the god's jects being implied: see I. Alex.Ptol., p. 47, citing I. Delta I, 236-237, No. 7 from Canopus (PaaiXeix; nxo^efiatoc; IlTO^enaioD Kai | 'Apaivorjc;, Gecdv a5eAxpcov, Kai Pao&amp;ioaa | BepeviKri, f| aSeAxpri Kai yuvri amox&gt; , | to xsjasvoq 'Oaipei); cf.

The inscription's original co-editor translated the hieroglyphic text as follows: "Le roi Ptolemee, aime d'Isis, fils du roi Ptolemee et de la reine Berenice, a Harpocrate par ordre de Serapis et d'Isis." 57 Other examples of these terms being used for dreams: e.g., /. Oropos 329 (c. 300-250 B.C.); I. Delos 2105-2106 (= R1CIS 202/0340-1) (98/7 B.); Aristid., Or. 48.7, 48.51, 49.20, 50.14, 51.32. 5 ^ The sources for Ptolemy I having the colossal statue of Pluto in Sinope brought to Alexandria following a dream and the cult's recognition as Sarapis by the religious authorities are Tac., Hist. 4.83-84 and Plut., de Is. et Os. 28 (= Mor. 361F- 362A). On the episode, see Borgeaud- Volokhine (2000), 38-46 and McKenzie- Gibson- Reyes (2004), 79-81; see also Alfred Hermann, Die agyptische Konigsnovelle Leipziger Agyptologische Studien 10 (Gllickstadt, Hamburg &amp; New York 1938), 42-44, first linking this episode to the Egyptian "Konigsnovellen" tradition. It should be remembered that Alexander</page><page sequence="26">194 G.H. Renberg and W.S. Bubelis establishment on that island and can be inferred from other sources, Sarapis was also being seen in dreams beyond Egypt by the late-third century B.C.59 Therefore, since dreams had been playing such an important role in the worship of Sarapis and would continue to do so, it is not surprising that Zoilos would have expected Apollonios to act when informed that the god had revealed through this medium that the two were to help spread his cult.60 Thus even if Zoilos completely fabricated his story, as has occasionally been suspected, the tale would nonetheless be significant because it would reflect - and, indeed, be playing upon - genuine religious beliefs, even if these were not felt by the author himself.61 the Great was supposed to have founded New Smyrna in the aftermath of seeing the Nemeses in a dream (Paus. 7.5.1-3), so the successors of Ptolemy I, who venerated Alexander, would have been cognizant of the need to heed their dreams. Moreo- ver, the Ptolemies were probably aware of at least some of the Pharaonic precedents for royal figures receiving and acting upon dreams, or else the pseudoepigraphical accounts of Egyptian kings and princes receiving god-sent dreams which were in vogue during the Late Period and Ptolemaic period. (On royal dreams in Pharaonic Egypt, see Kasia Szpakowska, Behind Closed Eyes: Dreams and Nightmares in Ancient Egypt [Swansea 2003], 47-57.) 59 The Delian aretalogy, dating to within a decade or two of 200 B.C., is the earliest epigraphical evidence for dreams received from Sarapis outside of Egypt ( IG XI .4, 1299, /. 3 [= RICIS 202/0101]; see Ian S. Moyer, "Notes on Re-Reading the Delian Aretalogy of Sarapis (IG XI. 4 1299)," ZPE 166 [2008], 101-107, for recent improvements to the text), though a num- ber of dedications employing the term 7ip6oxayfxa could allude to such an experience ( e.g , IG XI.4, 1238, 1251, 1256 [= RI- CIS 202/0179, 202/0149, 202/0180]; SEG 25, 1121-1122 [= 401/0604, 401/0601]). Similarly, it has been suggested that an oracle for the Cypriot king Nikokreon, an ally of Alexander the Great and later Ptolemy I who died in 31 1/310 B.C., that is of doubtful authenticity might have been issued in a dream if indeed genuine (Macrob., Sat 1.20.16-17; see R. van den Broek, "The Sarapis Oracle in Macrobius, Sat. I, 20, 16-17," in M.B. de Boer &amp; T.A. Edridge [eds.], Hommages a Maarten J. Ver- maseren: Recueil d' etudes offert par les auters de la serie Etudes preliminaires aux religions orientales dans V Empire ro- main a Maarten J. Vermaseren a V occasion de son soixantieme anniversaire le 7 avril 1978 EPRO 68 [Leiden 1978], 1:123- 141 and Borgeaud - Volokhine [2000], 55-56). The inscription from the Thessalonika Sarapieion attesting to the dreams received by Xenainetos (see n. 63) dates to the first century A.D., but is almost certain to describe an event from the Hellenis- tic Period. 60 in addition to the Ptolemaic king or kings who dreamed of Sarapis, it is possible that from the earliest days of the Al- exandrian cult the god was issuing dreams to his worshipers, though the only evidence for this is two later sources of ques- tionable reliability indicating that sometime after Demetrios of Phaleron's arrival there in 297 B.C. he was writing about dreams sent by Sarapis, especially those leading to medical recoveries, and may even have received such a dream himself. Artemidoros reports that Demetrios's treatise on this subject was five books in length (Artem. 2.44, p. 179 Pack), but Darius Del Corno has reasonably called into question whether this work was rightly attributed to him, partly because it seems un- likely that a large enough body of aretalogical tales and dream accounts would have been in existence so early in the cult's history ( Graecorum de re onirocritica scriptorum reliquiae , Testi e Documenti per lo Studio dell'Antichita 26 [Milan 1969], 138-139). According to Diogenes Laertius, Demetrios "is said to have lost his eyesight and regained it in Alexandria through Sarapis 's agency" (Xeysiai 8s a7io(3a^6vxa auiov xaq o'|/eiq ev 'AXs^avSpsia Kojiioao0ai auBu; 7tapa tov SapotTtiSoq), which is potentially an allusion to his having engaged in therapeutic incubation and received the type of curative dream about which Artemidoros claimed he had written (Diog. Laert. 5.5.76). For the writings and career of Demetrios, see William W. Forten- baugh &amp; Eckart Schiitrumpf (eds.), Demetrius of Phalerum: Text, Translation and Discussion Rutgers University Studies in Classical Humanities 9 (New Brunswick &amp; London 2000). 61 This discussion, like so much of the present article, is based on the assumption that Zoilos was conveying to Apollo- nios legitimate religious experiences. However, while most scholars take Zoilos at his word - in one case even going so far as to compare him to St. Paul in terms of being a reluctant missionary (Clary sse - Vandorpe [1995], 84-85) - a minority have expressed varying degrees of skepticism regarding Zoilos's veracity and motives (see, e.g. Arthur D. Nock, Conversion: The Old and the New in Religion from Alexander the Great to Augustine of Hippo [Oxford 1933], 49-50; Wilhelm Schubart, Glaube und Bildung im Wandel der Zeiten [Munich 1947], 15n.l; E.R. Dodds, The Greeks and The Irrational [Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles 1951], 125n.32; Fraser [1960], 42n.3; and William V. Harris, Dreams and Experience in Classical Antiquity [Cambridge, Mass. 2009], 165n.245"). Admittedly, as the skeptics imply, there is another viable way of reading the Zoilos papyrus: the writer may have been taking advantage of the recipient's known piety and munificence when he claimed that he had received dreams from Sarapis to the effect that the wealthy Apollonios must pay for the construction of a Sarapieion and put Zoilos in charge. The elaborate story of initially ignoring a series of dream-oracles, asking Sarapis to be relieved of his obligation, falling ill, recovering, failing to act on the god's orders, falling ill again, and (implicitly) acquiescing to the god's wishes and regaining his health as a result would have had great appeal for one with a strong attachment to Sarapis, whose repeated miracles became the stuff of numerous aretalogies and stories circulating in Egypt (see Maria Totti, Ausgewahlte Texte der Isis- und Sarapis-Religion Subsidia Epigraphica 12 [Hildesheim, Zurich &amp; New York 1985], 29-33, and Ael., NA 1 1 .31 , 34, 35). The Zoilos letter, therefore, might reflect what a cynical hustler knew would resonate with a devout worshiper of Sarapis and lead to steady employment for himself, rather than the honest testimony of one who was himself a worshiper, albeit a wayward one. Or, since at 11. 17-18 Zoilos cites his four-month illness as the reason for not reporting to Apollonios</page><page sequence="27">The Epistolary Rhetoric ofZoilos of Aspendos: Re-reading P. Cairo Zen. 1 59034 195 What makes the Zoilos letter so remarkable in addition to its rhetorical qualities and unusual epistolary elements is not that he had dreamed of Sarapis, but the tortuous path on which his dreams led him - a series of events that raises a number of questions regarding what exactly happened and the timeframe within which they occurred (see Appendix). The first such question is what Zoilos was doing when the dreams from Sarapis first came to him. According to Zoilos, "It happened to me as I was pay- ing worship to the god Sarapis on behalf of your health and success with King Ptolemy that Sarapis in- structed me again and again in my sleep that I should sail over to you and inform you of this oracle" (11. 2-6). Though in the past this has been taken by some to be an indication that Zoilos had been engaging in incubation,62 it should not be assumed that this was the case: after all, worshipers often received un- bidden dreams that seemed to have divine origins, and nothing in the letter's language points to Zoilos deliberately engaging in ritual incubation on Apollonios's behalf or his own.63 Moreover, if Zoilos was indeed at Saqqara then concluding that he solicited these dreams through incubation would be problem- atic, since there is no reliable evidence for ordinary individuals being able to consult either the Hel- lenized god Sarapis or his Egyptian forerunner Osorapis through incubation at the site 64 Although some sort of connection between Zoilos 's dreams and his "paying worship to the god Sarapis on behalf of [Apollonios's] health and success with King Ptolemy" is evident, it is more likely that he was visiting Saqqara and stayed there for at least one night, receiving this series of dreams at his lodgings, than that he formally engaged in incubation 65 Whether he had indeed trekked there for the sole or primary pur- pose of seeking blessings for Apollonios as claimed in lines 3-4 is impossible to tell, but if he was truly engaging in prayers and rituals by day it would not be unexpected for him to have dreamed of Sarapis regarding some business affair when he was supposed to, it is also possible that Zoilos dreamed up this account as an elabo- rate alibi. If Zoilos fabricated or embellished his tale it is worth considering that the template might have come from one or more other cults. Sarapis, after all, was not the only subject of aretalogical narratives circulating in antiquity. Of particular note is an anecdote preserved by Lucian that concerns the Seleukid queen Stratonike and parallels Zoilos 's letter in several ways (Lucian, Syr. D. 19, with commentary by J. L. Lightfoot, Lucian: 'On the Syrian Goddess ' Edited with Introduction, Trans- lation and Commentary [Oxford 2003], 402-404). Upon receiving divine instructions from the goddess Hera (i.e. Atargatis), Stratonike delays building the prescribed temple, and is punished with sickness until she does begin the work in earnest, whereupon she is cured right away. Despite Lucian' s brevity in treating the episode, this essential pattern of events bears clear resemblance to that of Zoilos' s own narrative, not to mention several other Mesopotamian and Mediterranean parallels (see Lightfoot, ibid., for references, including Zoilos 's letter). Thus the experiences described by Zoilos were not necessarily unique to the cult of Sarapis, and may have been rooted in stories of Stratonike or others who failed to heed god-sent dreams. 62 E.g. Wilcken apud Deissmann (1923), 152n.6; Fraser (1972), II:408-409n.538; Holbl (1993), 31-32; RAC XVIII (1997), 203, s.v . "Inkubation" (M. Wacht). 63 A similarly ambiguous situation is to be found in the inscribed narrative of an individual named Xenainetos, whose account of receiving dreams from Sarapis while visiting the Thessalonika Sarapieion is often compared to that of Zoilos ( IG X.2, 1, 255 + PI. 10 [= RICIS 113/0536 + PI. 26]; see Sokolowski [1974], 441-445, and Borgeaud - Volokhine [2000], 47- 48). According to this inscription, Xenainetos had come from Opous on some sort of embassy, and while sleeping in an oikoc; either in or near the sanctuary had received two identical dreams from Sarapis in which the god stated that he should tell his rival Eurynomos to receive Sarapis and his "sister" Isis and bring him a letter that the god had left under his pillow - a letter which he found upon awakening and brought back to Opous, leading Eurynomos to see to the establishment of Sarapis and Isis in a private home there. Since the beginning of the inscription is broken it is impossible to determine whether Xenainetos was engaging in incubation - perhaps in order to seek the god's guidance concerning a dispute with Eurynomos - or sleeping in a structure reserved for visitors or belonging to a religious association. 64 See Gil H. Renberg, "Incubation at Saqqara," in Pap.Cong. 25 (Ann Arbor 2010), 649-662. It is possible, although there is no supporting evidence, that ordinary worshipers such as Zoilos might have been able to seek dreams from Sarapis at the nearby Asklepieion , a complex distinct from the Sarapieon but routinely visited by the same worshipers. 65 On the village settlements located among the Saqqara temple complexes, in one of which Zoilos most likely would have stayed, see Davies- Smith (1997), 120. Zoilos does not indicate whether he received multiple dreams in a single night or over several nights, and parallels exist for both phenomena: the case of Xenainetos at Thessalonika (see n. 63) is one of several ancient sources for individuals receiving more than one divine dream in a single night, while the former priest of Athena Lindia who is said by the "Lindian Chronicle" to have dreamed of the goddess on six consecutive nights represents an example of the latter situation (/. Lindos I 2, D, //. 107-1 13; see Carolyn Higbie, The Lindian Chronicle and the Greek Crea- tion of their Past [Oxford 2003], 141-151, 273-288 et pass).</page><page sequence="28">196 G.H. Renberg and W.S. Bubelis and Apollonios at night - especially since, as is implied by lines 18-21 , the god's instructions for Apol- lonios were directly related to the purpose of Zoilos's original prayers. What makes Zoilos's account strikingly different from most other narratives involving divine commands is that he later "implored [the god Sarapis (?)] that he excuse me from this work(?)" of informing Apollonios about the dream-oracle (/. 9), even though Zoilos professed to be both a worshiper of the god and an agent and well-wisher of the finance minister, and, as the papyrus itself demonstrates, the very least that was required of him was to write a letter to Apollonios. The manner in which Zoilos "implored" Sarapis - assuming that the text has been correctly restored (see note to /. 8) - is also unclear: although it might be inferred from Zoilos's terse narrative that he did so in a conversation with the god in his dreams and became deathly ill soon after awakening,66 it is more likely that sometime after receiving the dreams he offered up prayers to Sarapis to be released from his obligation, and subsequently began to suffer 67 For how long Zoilos suf- fered before consenting to the god's wishes, and whether he was struck ill while still at the sanctuary or had already left, is likewise unclear, but it would not be unreasonable to infer from the length of his sub- sequent four-month relapse (/. 17) that the illness continued for several days at the very least. Zoilos's recovery was followed by the sudden appearance and perplexing disappearance of the Knidian "who undertook to build a Sarapieion in that place" but was later forbidden to do so by the god (//. 12-15), with the possible implication being that he was not the one who had been called upon to do so. While there are numerous examples of gods asking through dreams or other divinatory media for temples, altars and other cult objects or structures to be dedicated to them, this episode represents a rare or unique instance of a divinity specifically requesting that a planned dedication not be made. Zoilos is frustratingly silent on how the god's cease-and-desist order was conveyed, leaving it an open question whether the Knidian received a dream in which the god spoke directly to him or had some form of oracle or omen delivered to him, or received a message from local authorities that was ascribed to Sarapls. Zoi- los also is vague about the timeline: he says that the Knidian was told to stop and then went away, and in the next sentence tells of traveling to Alexandria on business and failing to convey to Apollonios the original xpimaua|i6&lt;;. This leaves uncertain how much time had elapsed, but since the Knidian's aban- donment of his project deprived Zoilos of an excuse for not acting it appears that one event followed quickly upon the other. Zoilos likewise neglects to mention whether his four-month relapse ended when he somehow signaled his acquiescence to the god, as can be inferred: he simply states that he was ill for this length of time after failing to broach the subject of the Sarapieion with Apollonios and therefore was unable to meet with Apollonios sooner, and ends his narrative there without further details, includ- ing where he and Apollonios were, respectively, at the time. However, in order to achieve his letter's goals, there was no need for Zoilos to provide such details - their absence is undoubtedly far more vex- ing to us than it would have been to Apollonios. A more general issue raised by the Zoilos papyrus is to what extent the spread of the god's cult oc- curred because of private initiative or, alternately, the dictates of cult officials (who themselves may well have consulted Sarapis, or Osorapis, on such matters). According to the Delian aretalogy, Sarapis had been worshiped in private quarters for many years before a grandson of the "Egyptian from the priestly order" (Aiywrcioc; sk tcov ispscov) who brought the god's cult image to Delos, himself a priest as well, 66 The surviving sources suggest that dreams featuring the gods did not normally include a back-and-forth exchange, since a typical dream-encounter involved the god either delivering a message or simply appearing before the dreamer - and in either case, most dreamers would not have argued with the divinity. 67 The so-called "confession" inscriptions of Asia Minor include several potential parallels from the Roman era involv- ing individuals who became ill and, perhaps with the help of a priest or diviner, determined that this should be attributed to a recent religious transgression that they had committed. (The inscriptions were collected in Petzl, Beichtinschriften , but many important texts have appeared in the years since. Among more recent studies, see especially Angelos Chaniotis, "Under the Watchful Eyes of the Gods: Divine Justice in Hellenistic and Roman Asia Minor," in S. Colvin [ed.], The Greco-Roman East: Politics , Culture, Society YCS 31 [Cambridge 2004], 1-43 and ibid., "Ritual Performances of Divine Justice: The Epigraphy of Confession, Atonement, and Exaltation in Roman Asia Minor," in H. Cotton, R.G. Hoyland, J.J. Price, D.J. Wasserstein [eds.], From Hellenism to Islam: Cultural and Linguistic Change in the Roman Near East [Cambridge 2008], 1 15-153.)</page><page sequence="29">The Epistolary Rhetoric ofZoilos of Aspendos: Re-reading P. Cairo Zen. 1 59034 197 received a dream instructing him to establish the island's first Sarapieion (see n. 25). Similarly, the foundation deposit plaques from Alexandria that record Ptolemaic kings acting on divine Trpoaxdyiiaxa may allude to dreams that they themselves received, perhaps consulting one or more priests or cult offi- cials before undertaking their construction projects, or to dreams received by such religious personnel and brought to the king's attention. On the other hand, in the case of Xenainetos, whose narrative is of- ten compared to that of Zoilos, the surviving text gives no indication that he was a priest or cult official at the time that he reportedly received dreams while visiting the Thessalonika Sarapieion , only indicat- ing that he held public office back home in Opous (see n. 63). Zoilos likewise falls into the category of ordinary worshiper, and thus both cases raise the question of whether individuals truly could determine on their own - i.e. without consulting priests or other cult officials about their dreams - that Sarapis should have a new sanctuary established for him. It is certainly possible that both men would have sought the input of a religious authority with expertise in dream interpretation in order to be sure that they had properly understood their dreams, but that such a consultation was not thought worth recording because it merely confirmed the dreams.68 The presence of at least one apparently professional dream- interpreter at Saqqara a century later, a Cretan known from a sign advertising his practice that was found in the area of the Anoubieion , suggests yet another possibility: if Zoilos (or Xenainetos) felt the need to consult an expert regarding his dreams he could have sought professional advice rather than that of a cult official, especially if he was consulting a non-Egyptian concerning the establishment of a sanctuary in- tended for a Hellenized cult.69 But we must also entertain the possibility that private worshipers could act on their own after believing themselves to have received a direct communique from Sarapis, even in matters as significant as the establishment of new cult sites. With so few pertinent sources, unfortu- nately, it is impossible to determine how representative the Zoilos papyrus is of the spiritual stimuli and decision-making processes leading to the establishment of Sarapieia in Egypt and elsewhere in the Mediterranean world at this time. Ultimately, the papyrus leaves us to wonder many things, not least of which would be whether this sanctuary was ever established, but we can at least appreciate Zoilos 's rhe- torical skills in making his case - even if those very skills and frustratingly concise approach have hid- den from us much that we, and perhaps Apollonios as well, would have liked to know. That the Greeks and Romans did not find it necessary to refer to consultations with dream-interpreters when acting on a god-sent dream is indicated by the fact that out of well over 400 Greek and Latin dedications identified as having been prompted by dreams only a single one indicates their involvement - a Latin inscription on an altar that was given to Liber Pater in Dacia "according to an interpretation of dreams" ( secund[um ] I interpre[tati]lonem so[mni]lorum) ( IDR III .4, 284, //. 5-8). See also I. Delos 2105-2106 (= RICIS 202/0340-1), matching dedications to the Egyptian gods made Kara 7ip6aTay|ia 5ia oveipOKpiTOD, and I. Delos 2151 (= RICIS 202/0289), an inscription possibly from the same Sarapieion that is missing its dedicatory formula but refers to those who dedicated it 7rpooava(pepovx8(; xcai oveipoKpiirii.
