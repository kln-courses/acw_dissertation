Woven of the threads of introspection, reflection on the human condition, and social criticism, it is a life's tapestry of interlocking images of the self, the world, and society, the product of an artist's labour to get the pattern right. The Canti in particular exhibit a shifting balance and intimate development of these elements, crowned by 'La ginestra o il fiore del deserto'.1 This late philosophical poem is Leopardi's mature vision of the self in the world, and an answer to the question, 'How should one live?'. It is also a remarkably ambitious work of creative art. If creativity is 'the ability to fashion objects that are valuable for their beauty, truth, or usefulness',2 then 'La ginestra' is an artist's attempt to achieve the fullest scope of creativity. For in the poem Leopardi seeks to integrate aesthetic, cognitive, and practical value. We wish to shed fresh light on Leopardi's mature vision and the poem's multiple value by inserting 'La ginestra' in a line of social theory anchored in the Enlighten- ment tradition stretching from the French moralists of the seventeenth century to a loose cluster of modern philosophers, the most prominent of whom is Jiirgen Habermas. Within this perspective we define and elucidate a notion of social art as 'communicative action' and interpret 'La ginestra' as an exemplary instance of social art. We argue that Leopardi makes use of five devices in order to make the poem work as social art: dramaturgical action, cognitive exhortation, evocation of sympathy, metaphor, and aesthetic decentring. ('Decentring' denotes the displace- ment of humankind from the centre of the universe.) We clarify and illustrate each device and the manner in which Leopardi weaves them together. And we suggest a variety of criteria forjudging the poem's success as social art. In a refreshing study of art and science, Anthony O'Hear notes 'the centrality of the communication of an experience to all the arts, in contrast to the aims of scientific and literal objective discourse', and urges that a necessary condition for 'artistic success' consists 'in success in communicating a particular vision or set of attitudes or experiences. But this is only the ground level of success in art. There is also the question of the worth or validity of the vision or attitude or experience'.3 O'Hear's vindication of what is shared and tested in art invites closer conceptuali- zation and careful application to 'La ginestra', for the poem communicates a particular vision and distinctive attitudes and experiences, and presents these as being of special validity for the public. A general framework for judging the two kinds of artistic success mentioned by O'Hear can be constructed from Habermas's concepts of dramaturgical and communicative action. Hence we begin, in Section in, by defining social art in terms of Habermas's concepts of action. In Section in we examine the poem's structure and illustrate the centrality of the sublime in Leopardi's presentation of self. In Section iv we analyse Leopardi's conception of 1 In Giacomo Leopardi, Tutti le opere, ed. by Walter Binni and Enrico Ghidetti, 6th edn, 2 vols (Florence: Sansoni, I989), I, 42-45. 2Jon Elster, 'Fullness and Parsimony: Notes on Creativity in the Arts', in Explanation and Value in the Arts, ed. by Salim Kemal and Ivan Gaskell (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, I993), pp. 146-72 (p. 146). 3 The Element ofFire: Science, Art and the Human World (London: Routledge, 1988), p.

We compare his conception with David Hume's notions of the circumstances ofjustice and the poetic fiction of the golden age. In Section v we discuss Leopardi's device of evocation of sympathy in the light of Hume's theory of the workings of sympathy. In Section vi we draw on C. Behan McCullagh's work to analyse the desert flower as metaphor and symbol. In these two sections we draw comparisons with other artists' and moralists' use of cognitive exhortation, evocation of sympathy, and metaphor in a number of texts and paintings similar in subject-matter to 'La ginestra'. In Section vI we consider Leopardi's use of the device of aesthetic decentring. We distinguish several strands of his philosophical materialism and draw upon O'Hear's conception of the difference between art and science to explain why the most radical strand does not find expression in 'La ginestra'. Relatedly, we locate an element of affinity between Leopardi and Karl Marx in Romantic notions of alienation. In Section vmII we briefly set out our conclusions. ii. Art and interpretation Works of art, including literary texts, admit a great variety of interpretations. One class of interpretations focuses upon the relation between the artist's intentions and the audience's understanding or experience of the work. Habermas has constructed a general theory of rational, social action that can illuminate this relation, and make sense of the intimacy of interpretation and evaluation that characterizes aesthetic response. To see this, first consider a well-established way of discovering a work's meaning, the contextual approach, in which the critic acquires a thorough historical knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the composition and reception of the work, as well as of contemporary linguistic, aesthetic, or other conventions. Know- ledge of circumstances and conventions permits the critic to form hypotheses about the work's meaning. The critic can then judge the relative adequacy of rival contextual interpretations in a rational manner, according to the logic of'arguments to the best explanation of available evidence' supplemented by other widely accepted criteria.4 Needless to say, the evidence might be such that no hypothesis can be shown to be superior on rational grounds. Thus, the contextual approach identifies the meaning, or set of meanings, that can be inferred if one assumes that all and only that which is common knowledge for the artist and the artist's intended audience is relevant to determining the meaning of the text. We call this kind of meaning the text's local illocutionary force.5 Habermas's theory suggests another way of construing the relation between artist and audience. He employs a four-fold typology of social action.6 Of the four kinds of action, two bear only indirectly on the theory of social art: strategic action and norm-guided behaviour, concepts of action typically associated with the disciplines of economics and sociology. This is not to say that the concepts of strategic action and norm-guided behaviour are of little interest for the study of literature and art. 4 See C. Behan McCullagh, 'Can Our Understanding of Old Texts Be Objective?', History and Theory, 30 (I991), 302-23; Justifying Historical Descriptions (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, I984), pp. I5-44, 107-10. 5 See notably Quentin Skinner, 'Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas', History and Theory, 8 (I969), 3-53. 6 The Theory of Communicative Action, trans. by Thomas McCarthy, 2 vols (Boston, MA: Beacon Press, 1983 and 1987), i, Section 1.3. 866</page><page sequence="3">JOHN ALCORN AND DARIO DEL PUPPO 867 On the contrary. For example, Paisley Livingston demonstrates that Edgar Allan Poe was engaged in complex and protracted strategic action in writing and publishing 'Mesmeric Revelation' and a number of related texts in I844-45,7 and Jon Elster invokes both concepts to shed light on the nature of aesthetic conventions, which can be understood as a special kind of strategic equilibrium among artists and as social norms enforced by public disapproval or ostracism of artists who flout them.8 For the purpose of describing the relation between artist and audience in social art, however, we turn to the other concepts of social action. One is dramatur- gical action, the simplest form of which is presentation of self; complex forms involve the altercasting and outcasting of others. Habermas remarks, 'presentation ofself does not signify spontaneous expressive behaviour but stylizing the expression of one's own experiences with a view to the audience' (Theory of Communicative Action, i, 86). In dramaturgical action, the actor seeks appreciation, and is therefore constrained by the need to appear sincere in the expression of beliefs and to achieve authenticity in the expression of emotions: So long as we are dealing [... ] with beliefs or intentions, that is, with cognitive acts, the question of whether someone says what he means is clearly a question of[... ] sincerity. With desires and feelings this is not always the case. In situations in which accuracy of expression is important, it is sometimes difficult to separate questions of sincerity from those of authen- ticity. Often we lack the words to say what we feel; and this in turn places the feelings themselves in a questionable light. (I, 93) Then there is Habermas's contribution, the concept of communicative action, in which the speaker seeks consensus. Communicative action is subject to three special constraints, which Habermas terms 'claims to validity'. These are claims to truth, claims to rightness, and claims to sincerity. Communicative action thus consists in sincere assertions about what is and what ought to be the case, and aims at bringing about consensus, or recognition of the validity of a point of view (I, 94-Ioo).9 This cluster of concepts can make sense of a kind of art, which we call social art, as a form of communication. In locating the cement of meaning in rational constraints on artists who wish to have their work not merely understood, but appreciated and recognized, it identifies the work's global illocutionary force. As a normative theory, it has critical value, for the constraints it specifies are criteria for judging the adequacy of the work of art as social action. In so far as artists seek to meet the constraints it specifies, it has explanatory value and is a useful heuristic. There is a sense in which it is a special case of the contextual approach, for it privileges a particular kind of common knowledge for artist and audience: the knowledge that argument and social art are expected to achieve appreciation and recognition of a point of view. The concept of global illocutionary force enables us to make sense of the enduring interest, and indeed meaning, that certain works of art or argument have for audiences who no longer possess the broad, detailed common knowledge that defined the works' contextual or purely historical meanings. In this view, the constraints on dramaturgical and communicative action are more robust and 7 Literature and Rationality (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 199I), pp. 70-79.

In adapting the theory of communicative action to social art we must leave room for characteristic features of artistic expression. Because so much of artistic expres- sion involves the emotions, the criterion of rightness must be extended beyond the domain of ideas and applied to the sphere of the emotions. And because artistic expression often involves the devices of irony and metaphor, the criteria of truth and sincerity must be understood to accommodate these complexities. Before turning to apply these ideas to Leopardi's work, we note two possible objections to the conception of social art as communicative action. It might be thought that art, being a kind of fiction, is not subject to the constraints that define communicative action. But, as Hume notes: 'Poets themselves, tho' liars by profession, always endeavour to give an air of truth to their fictions; and where that is totally neglected, their performances, however ingenious, will never be able to afford much pleasure."l More worrisome is the difficulty of distinguishing social art from other forms of public persuasion that often trade in something like artistic expression of ideas and emotions; for example, propaganda and advertising. Without denying that there are family resemblances, a distinction can be drawn in terms of the relationship between artist and audience. In both propaganda and advertising, whatever claims to truth and rightness are pressed, sincerity is in a way neglected, for the message is typically designed to shape the audience's beliefs and desires by mechanisms that work behind the back, such as wishful thinking and bias of various kinds. The social artist, unlike the propagandist or the advertiser, speaks to the intellect and the emotions in ways that respect one's capacity to form rational beliefs and autonomous preferences.11 This aspect of the relationship in art is well captured in another idiom by O'Hear: 'In contemplating a work of art the observer makes his personal response to the work and is invited to test his subjectivity against that of the author of the work. In art, Dionysiac immersion is or ought to be tempered with Apollinian judgment' (p. 189). in. Aspects of Leopardi's presentation of self The structure of 'La ginestra' Written in 1836 shortly before Leopardi's death at age thirty-nine, the poem is a canzone structured in a loose pattern of endecasillabi and settenari with medial rhymes. At its head is a phrase from scripture, 'E gli uomini vollero piuttosto le tenebre che la luce' (John 3. I9). The setting is the volcano Vesuvius looming over the ruins of Pompeii and the Bay of Naples. The 317 lines are divided into stanzas, which vary in length from twenty-one to seventy-one lines. The first stanza (11. 1-5 I) introduces an anthropomorphic world. The poet addresses a desert flower who consoles the lavic desert with her fragrance. The spectacle of desolation (Vesuvius (a metonym for hostile Nature), the ruins of 10 A Treatise of Human Nature, ed. by L. A. Selby-Bigge, 2nd edn, revised by P. H.

A stark contrast is drawn between the setting's present barrenness, wrought by natural disaster, and its ancient eminence and vitality. The second stanza (11. 52-86), in which Leopardi turns to address another mute interlocutor, his 'proud and foolish century', echoes the contrast between past and present drawn in the first stanza, dwelling on the hollowness and complacency of Restoration Europe, so unlike the substance and wisdom of the forsaken Enlightenment. Here Leopardi appears as protagonist, engaged in dra- maturgical action against the grain of his age. The third and longest stanza (11. 87- I57), which we shall call the 'solidarity stanza', recasts the protagonists of the previous stanza (Leopardi and his century) as two kinds of person: the noble (nobil natura) and the fool or madman (stolto). It also introduces the people (volgo) to the stage. Here Leopardi reframes the dimensions of conflict and cooperation in the world, articulating his peculiar conception of human solidarity against Nature. There is no interlocutor within the stanza; rather, the reader is presented with an essential scene and a potential scenario. The stanza is thus structured as a piece of cognitive exhortation to share Leopardi's vision, and thereby foster nobility, widen the scope of solidarity, and establish the good society. The fourth stanza (11. 158-201) is entirely a piece of dramaturgical action. There is a thematic shift from the leitmotif of the vulnerability of humankind before Nature to the related theme of the utter smallness and insignificance of humankind within the Cosmos. Leopardi begins by expressing, to no one in particular, his experience of the Cosmos, and then turns rhetorically to query the human race, drawing a sardonic portrait of its anthropocentric illusions and pretensions. He concludes this stanza by asking after his own emotions about the human race, remaining torn between laughter and pity. The fifth stanza (11. 202-36) is an extended simile, likening the destruction ofPompeii to the obliteration ofan ant hill by a falling apple. The simile integrates and illustrates the previous themes of humankind's vulnerability before Nature and lack of special significance within the order of things. The sixth stanza (11. 237-96) introduces a new perspective: the imaginative rendering of ways in which others experience the present setting. Leopardi begins by depicting the anxiety of a peasant whose only barrier against starvation is threatened and finally destroyed by Vesuvius. Then he turns to sketch the eeriness, magnetism, and horror that a faceless traveller finds in the nocturnal spectacle. These images of experience or points of view are narrative evocations of sympathy. They promote fellow feeling, and thus function as an affective complement to the cognitive exhortation of the solidarity stanza. Leopardi concludes the stanza by remarking that Nature remains for ever young, as her time-scale of change dwarfs historical time. This point echoes the description of the Cosmos in the fourth stanza, and completes his depiction of the most basic dimensions of experience, space and time, as measures of humankind's insignificance. Leopardi underscores this com- pletion of aesthetic decentring by again mocking the anthropocentric point of view. The seventh and last stanza (11. 297-317) comes full circle to the imagery of the exordium. Leopardi addresses the fragrant desert flower, metaphor for poetry and nobility. A final contrast is drawn between the parallel faults of supplication and hubris before the prospect of death, on the one hand, and the fitting and ultimately more resilient and life-affirming attitude of insight and acceptance, on the other. The poem thus has a complex structure. It is at once anthropomorphic and anti-anthropocentric. The exordium and conclusion are addressed to the desert</page><page sequence="6">870 Social Art in Leopardi flower. The second and fourth stanzas are addressed to abstract, collective inter- locutors: the poet's century and the human race. Each of these four stanzas directly or indirectly displays dramaturgical action. This is plain in the second and fourth stanzas, and in the exordium and conclusion the desert flower is a stylized presentation of self. Dramaturgical action is not confined to the stanzas in which the poet speaks to an onstage actor: in the solidarity stanza the noble is another mask for Leopardi. Communicative action is interwoven with dramaturgical action, as Leopardi constructs a series of frames for the reordering of experience in a stepwise establishment of a demanding point of view he wishes the reader to come to share. Major steps are the inscription of historical contrasts in larger existential contrasts; the recastings of the dimensions of conflict and cooperation in the solidarity stanza, and of space and time in the fifth and sixth stanzas; the elision of presentation of self and universal metaphor in the image of the desert flower; and the succession of attitudes of blanket scorn, blind solidarity, and imaginative sympathy in the poet's complex point of view. Is Leopardi's reordering of experience one the reader can share? Does the poem succeed as communicative action? The answers require examination and evaluation of five elements in the poem: Leopardi's presentation of self; the cognitive exhorta- tion to solidarity against Nature; the evocation of sympathy; the metaphor of the desert flower; the aesthetically decentred point of view. Presentation of self: the sublime and negative emotions In this section we shall limit ourselves to the poet's overt presentation of self, leaving the masks of the noble and the desert flower for Sections iv and vi. It is noteworthy that a distinctive and complex set of Leopardi's own emotions which find recurrent representation in his poetry (the emotions associated with personal memory and anticipation) are absent from 'La ginestra'. None the less, the poem does express two characteristic Leopardian emotions. One emotion is aesthetic, and is related to the experience of finitude before the awesome phenomenology of Nature.12 Following Burke, we call this emotion the experience of the sublime: The passions which belong to self-preservation turn on pain and danger; they are simply painful when their causes immediately affect us; they are delightful when we have an idea of pain and danger, without being actually in such circumstances; this delight I have not called pleasure, because it turns on pain, and because it is different enough from any idea of positive pleasure. Whatever excites this delight, I call sublime. [... ] The passion caused by the great and sublime in nature, when those causes operate most powerfully, is astonishment; and astonishment is that state of the soul, in which all its motions are suspended, with some degree of horror.13 Kant contrasts the feeling of the sublime to another aesthetic emotion, the feeling of the beautiful, in which the experience is one of harmony with Nature. He sketches the sublime temperament in terms and images that well describe much of Leopardi's sensibility: 12 Compare Nicholas J. Perella, Night and the Sublime in Giacomo Leopardi (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1970); Daniela Bini, A Fragrance from the Desert: Poetry and Philosophy in Giacomo Leopardi (Saratoga, CA: Anma Libri, 1983), pp. I54-77. 13 A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origins of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, 2nd edn (London, [ 1759?]), Part I, Section viI, and Part n, Section i.</page><page sequence="7">JOHN ALCORN AND DARIO DEL PUPPO Temperaments that possess a feeling for the sublime are drawn gradually, by the quiet stillness of a summer evening as the shimmering light of the stars breaks through the brown shadows of night and the lonely moon rises into view, into high feelings of friendship, of disdain for the world, of eternity [...]. The sublime moves, the beautiful charms [...]. The sublime [... ] is sometimes accompanied with a certain dread, or melancholy; in some cases merely with quiet wonder [...]. Deep loneliness is sublime, but in a way that stirs terror. 14 Each element mentioned by Kant is found in 'La ginestra'. The poem is suffused with 'deep loneliness' and 'melancholy'. A mood of 'quiet wonder' comes through in Leopardi's description of the vaulted night in lines 158-66: Sovente in queste rive, Che, desolate, a bruno Veste il flutto indurato, e par che ondeggi, Seggo la notte; e su la mesta landa In purissimo azzurro Veggo dall'alto fiammeggiar le stelle, Cui di lontan fa specchio II mare, e tutto di scintille in giro Per lo v6to seren brillare il mondo. An emotion of 'disdain for the world' is given vent in lines 38-62 and I69-88. A feeling of'eternity' in Nature is expressed in lines 289-96: Cosi, dell'uomo ignara e dell'etadi Ch'ei chiama antiche, e del seguir che fanno Dopo gli avi i nepoti, Sta natura ognor verde, anzi procede Per si lungo cammino Che sembra star. Caggiono i regni intanto, Passan genti e linguaggi: ella nol vede: E l'uom d'eternita s'arroga il vanto. 'Dread' is found, not in Leopardi's presentation of self but in his depiction of the anxiety of the peasant threatened by Vesuvius (11. 24-68). 'High feelings of friendship' are expressed in the lines exhorting humankind to solidarity against nature (11. 111-57). Finally, the poem is clearly meant 'to move' rather than 'to charm'. The non-aesthetic emotion that Leopardi expresses in his presentation of self is actually a subtle complex of several negative emotions. It comprises strains of pride, vanity, scorn, and bitterness directed at his 'foolish century' (1. 53) that believes in progress without enlightenment (11. 52-7I, 98-I 0, I83-201). Here the expressive act of writing shades over into strategic action. Habermas states that 'dramaturgical action can take on latently strategic qualities to the degree that the actor treats his audience as opponents rather than as a public' (I, 93). Despite the slippage towards strategic action, these sections of the poem are effective as dramaturgical action, for the emotions are expressed with evident sincerity and authenticity. The verses expressing negative emotions are in tension with those portions of the poem that constitute communicative action, which entails the further constraint of rightness or appropriateness of the emotions. Casual observation and introspection suggest that readers do not form a negative judgement of Leopardi's presentation of self, despite his expression of negative emotions. What is it about the poem that inclines the 14 Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime, trans. byJ. T. Goldthwait (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1960), pp. 46-49. 87I</page><page sequence="8">Social Art in Leopardi reader towards charity? The answer carries us over into the sphere of communi- cative action, in the forms of cognitive exhortation, evocation of sympathy, meta- phor, and aesthetic decentring. iv. Cognitive exhortation in the solidarity stanza It is generally agreed that a central and distinctive feature of Leopardi's mature philosophy is the conception of human solidarity expressed in 'La ginestra'. Curiously, however, there has been no close analysis in English of the way he actually frames the problem of cooperation in the poem. Italian critics have focused upon the thrust of his conception and its implications for understanding the development of his thought as a whole.15 The nuts and bolts of his mature conception of solidarity remain enclosed in something of a black box. Let us open up the black box by exploring lines I I I-57 of the solidarity stanza, where Leopardi sketches his vision of the good society and turns all his powers towards cognitive exhortation. This vision is a metamorphosis of the poetic fiction of the golden age. As Hume explains, poets have ever sensed that conventions of justice, 'the mine and thine, which are so necessary, and yet cause such disturbance in human society', would be superfluous were it not for the facts of natural scarcity and human selfishness which place us in conflict with Nature and with one another. In everyday circumstances, these conflicts take the form of toil and bargaining, but they occasionally take the form of calamities such as natural disaster and war. '[The poets] easily perceiv'd, if every man had a tender regard for another, or if nature supplied abundantly all our wants and desires, that the jealousy of interest, which justice supposes, could no longer have place [... ]. Encrease to a sufficient degree the benevolence of men, or the bounty of nature, and you render justice useless, by supplying its place with much nobler virtues.' In the poetic fiction of the golden age, scarcity, selfishness, and their attendant conflicts and calamities are absent. 'The storms and tempests were not alone remov'd from nature; but those more furious tempests were unknown to human breasts [... ]. Even the distinction of mine and thine was banish'd from that happy race of mortals [... ]' (Treatise of Human Nature, III.2.ii). Leopardi does not wish to put forward a poetic fiction. His respect for il vero is expressed in an insistence upon constraints that Nature sets for human welfare: the ecological fact of scarcity, the biological fact of death, and the intermittent fact of sudden disaster. Instead, in his vision of the good society he reconsiders the other constraint mentioned by Hume, that of selfishness, and sketches a mechanism whereby enlightened self-interest can reduce social strife and bring about human solidarity against Nature. Leopardi begins from the premise that selfishness is a benighted condition, and that nobility rests on a kind of insight. He accepts a dichotomy of selfish and noble motives, such as we have seen in Hume's account of justice, but wishes to change the mix of motives in society. 15 See notably Walter Binni, 'Leopardi poeta delle generose illusioni e della eroica persuasione', in Leopardi, Tutte le opere, I, xi-cxx; Cesare Luporini, Leopardi progressivo (Rome: Editori Riuniti, I980); Sebastiano Timpanaro, 'Alcune osservazioni sul pensiero del Leopardi', 'II Leopardi e i filosofi antichi', and 'Natura dei e fato nel Leopardi', in Sebastiano Timpanaro, Classicismo e illuminismo nell'Ottocento italiano, 2nd edn, revised and enlarged (Pisa: Nistri Lischi, I969), pp. 133-82, 183-228, 379-408. 872</page><page sequence="9">JOHN ALCORN AND DARIO DEL PUPPO 873 Noble belief and action Leopardi posits and characterizes two types: the noble and the fool. He associates nobility with cognitive courage: Nobil natura e quella Che a sollevar s'ardisce Gli occhi mortali incontra Al comun fato, e che con franca lingua, Nulla al ver detraendo, Confessa il mal che ci fu dato in sorte, E il basso stato e frale; (1. III) There is an element of stylized presentation of self as the noble displays stoical pride: 'Quella che grande e forte I Mostra se nel soffrir [... ]' (11. I I8-I9). Leopardi states that hatred and anger bring the worst harms, worse than those wrought by Nature: ne gli odii e l'ire Fraterne, ancor piu gravi D'ogni altro danno, accresce Alle miserie sue, l'uomo incolpando Del suo dolor (1. I I9) He proposes to redirect these emotions against Nature. It is here, in lines I23-26, that he makes the paradoxical claim that men are not to blame for the noble's suffering: ma da la colpa a quella Che veramente e rea, che de' mortali Madre e di parto e di voler matrigna. Costei chiama inimica; The paradox lies in the fact that human actions, and notjust wicked actions, often do cause harm and suffering. What can Leopardi mean by the claim that Nature is the truly guilty one?16 What is going on here is a fusion of dramaturgical and communicative action. Leopardi is simultaneously expounding a conception of the real dimensions of conflict (a claim to truth and rightness) and casting roles for a drama. He is implicitly cast as the noble, the unenlightened are altercast as non-nobles who might even be fools, and Nature is outcast as the common enemy. The personification of Nature as a wicked stepmother to humankind permits the addition of a third character to the drama and onstage outcasting. A three-person drama is the simplest scheme available to Leopardi for representing his abstract subject: the dynamics of conflict, cooperation, and coalition-formation. By casting an anthropomorphic entity as the onstage outcast, he sets the stage in such a way that a coalition of cast and altercast amount to the elimination of conflict within humankind. 16 Leopardi expresses the same conviction in a notebook entry written seven years before (2 January I829): 'La mia filosofia [... ] di sua natura tende a sanare, a spegnere quel mal umore, quell'odio, non sistematico, ma pur vero odio, che tanti e tanti, i quali non sono filosofi, e non vorrebbono esser chiamati ne creduti misantropi, portano pero cordialmente a' loro simili, sia abitualmente, sia in occasioni particolari, a causa del male che, giustamente o ingiustamente, essi, come tutti gli altri, ricevono dagli altri uomini. La mia filosofia fa rea d'ogni cosa la natura, e discolpando gli uomini totalmente, rivolge l'odio, o se non altro il lamento, a principio piu alto, all'origine vera de' mali de' viventi ec. ec.' (Zibaldone di pensieri, ed. by Giuseppe Pacella, 3 vols (Milan: Garzanti, I99I), II, 2,509-10 (MS p. 4,428)).</page><page sequence="10">874 Social Art in Leopardi In this vein, he argues that noble action also rests on the belief that humans first formed society as a cooperative endeavour against Nature: e incontro a questa Congiunta esser pensando, Siccome e il vero, ed ordinata in pria L'umana compagnia (1. 126) This places Leopardi squarely within the grand tradition of social philosophers who frame their theories in light of speculative conceptions of the state of nature and its supersession: the diverse tradition of Lucretius, Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. Evidently, this speculative move is part of the discourse of Ancient and Enlightenment social philosophy, and an element in suasion. Leopardi's position within this tradition is the Lucretian one, that a state of nature marked by horror was followed by the establishment of human communities based on solidarity against Nature, which in turn developed into societies marred by myopic selfishness and strife.17 Leopardi construes the noble's insights about Nature and society as reasons for the noble to practise unilateral cooperation within an imagined community embracing humankind: Tutti fra se confederati estima Gli uomini, e tutti abbraccia Con vero amor (1. I30) This is not an idiosyncratic conception of the moral motive. Christianity, Kantianism, and Utilitarianism are general in this sense: at an abstract level, the imagined community is humanity, or all rational beings, or all sentient beings. In practice, however, the stuff of moral life and, more specifically, of solidarity and cooperation seems to have everything to do with the drawing of boundaries, establishing a subset of persons who count as the agent's moral community. Hume writes: 'In general, it may be affirm'd, that there is no such passion in human minds, as the love of mankind, merely as such, independent of personal qualities, of services, or of relation to ourself' (II.2.i). In a word, moral life exhibits a pervasive framing effect: the bounded application of theories or precepts which claim to be unbounded. How, then, should we interpret Leopardi's noble precept, 'embrace the whole of humanity in deep love'? Perhaps Leopardi, who is wont to lend his voice to Icelanders and Asian shepherds, really does mean unbounded human solidarity.18 If so, it is at once the beauty and the unreality of his vision, as with the precepts ofJesus, Kant, andJ. S. Mill. What actions does this deep love for all members of the species entail? In lines 132-35 Leopardi states that the noble engages in unilateral cooperation, 'expect- ing' reciprocity: 17 De rerum natura, ed. by W. H. D. Rouse and E.

The mention of alterni perigli makes explicit the fact that the noble, too, can expect to stand in need of help at some time. The basis for wider solidarity is thus recognition that we have a common interest in cooperation. The mention of angosce links the common interest to an emotional basis for solidarity, fellow feeling, and thus adumbrates the description of the anxiety of the peasant threatened by Vesuvius (11. 240-68). The noble does not retaliate against insults or harms inflicted by others, for retaliation is foolish, even mad: Ed alle offese Dell'uomo armar la destra, e laccio porre Al vicino ed inciampo, Stolto crede cosi qual fora in campo Cinto d'oste contraria, in sul piu vivo Incalzar degli assalti, Gl'inimici obbliando, acerbe gare Imprender con gli amici, E sparger fuga e fulminar col brando Infra i propri guerrieri. (1. 35) The analogy to civil war in the context of a larger war suggests that the noble man reasons that retaliation among humans places Nature, the real enemy, in the position of tertia gaudens. The reference to offese indicates that unilateral cooperation by the noble does not by itself bring about generalized reciprocity. Indeed, in a way, the noble's own rejection of retaliation is a rejection of reciprocity, a rejection of strict reciprocity in the form of tit-for-tat strategy. Leopardi is working from an asymmetry between the psychology of the noble, who engages in unilateral coopera- tion, and that of non-nobles, who at best engage in conditional cooperation. The grounds of the good society Is the noble's unilateral cooperation a form of enlightened self-interest or altruism? Recall that Hume posits two constraints that define the problem ofjustice: "Tis only from the selfishness and confin'd generosity of men, along with the scanty provision nature has made for his wants, that justice derives its origin' (I.2.ii). Does Leopardi accept the constraint of confined generosity in his theory of human solidarity against Nature? On the one hand, lines I35-44 suggest that the noble sees that turning the other cheek is the wiser course, for retaliation is termed stolto, and the civil-war analogy focuses upon consequences of retaliation than can harm the retaliator, too. On the other hand, in lines 87-98 of the same stanza, Leopardi employs association of adjectives to present the noble as magnanimo, generoso, and alto. It seems that he believes nobility entails not just enlightened self-interest but some other-regarding motives and an element of principle. Nobility is thus a synthesis of motives construed to point in roughly the same direction: enlightened self-interest; concern for the general welfare (unweighted altruism); a notion of duty; virtue, as expressed in the Christian maxims, 'love thy neighbour' and 'turn the other cheek'. What Leopardi suggests is that these motives are sufficiently integrated within some</page><page sequence="12">876 Social Art in Leopardi individuals to constitute a complex disposition to cooperate: nobility. Again the strength of his point of view is at once its weakness. For we should expect that in the most basic matters of human cooperation there will be no permanent, radical, and overriding conflict among enlightened self-interest, concern for the general welfare, duty, and virtue. Yet we should also expect that conflicts among these motives will often arise and block cooperation: all good things do not always go together. Leopardi concludes the stanza by arguing that if the noble's insights become generally recognized, human community can flourish within the constraints set by Nature. He draws attention to a specific insight that is needed to establish a sense of community: the 'horror' that first caused humans to band together against Nature: Cosi fatti pensieri Quando fien, come fur, palesi al volgo, E quell'orror che primo Contra l'empia natura Strinse i mortali in social catena, Fia ricondotto in parte Da verace saper, l'onesto e il retto Conversar cittadino, E giustizia e pietade, altra radice Avranno allor che non superbe fole, Ove fondata probita del volgo Cosi star suole in piede Quale star puo quel ch'ha in error la sede. (1. I45) Leopardi thus comes full circle to the notion of cognitive courage, the virtue with which he began his characterization of nobility. For he draws a contrast between the good society, which can be built upon the sound foundation of cognitive courage, and strife-ridden society, which is sapped at its base by wishful thinking and self-deception ('superbefole' (1. 54) ). It should be noted that for much of his life he held the contrary belief: that the forms of irrationality which can be grouped under the Italian term illusioni are the very cement of society and the spring of what is most worthy in human action. He states this clearly in a notebook entry dated I8 April 1825: La distruzione delle illusioni [... ] ha distrutto l'amor di patria, di gloria, di virti, ec. Quindi e nato, anzi rinato, uno universale egoismo. L'egoismo e naturale, proprio dell'uomo: tutti i fanciulli, tutti i veri selvaggi sono pretti egoisti. Ma l'egoismo e incompatibile colla societa. Questo effettivo ritorno allo stato naturale [...] e distruttivo dello stato sociale. [...] Conchiudo che la filosofia la quale sgombra dalla vita umana mille errori [... ] effettivam. e [... ] dannosa e distruttiva della societa, perche quegli errori [...] effettivam. sono [.. ] necessari alla sussistenza e conservazione della societa [...]. (Zibaldone, In, 2,258 (MS p. 4, I 36)) The contrast drawn in 'La ginestra' is thus an inversion of a motif of Leopardi's earlier thought. The notion of cognitive courage raises difficult questions about belief. Is belief a state or a kind of action? On the one hand, it is hard to see how one can hold a belief and deem it false. Beliefs aim at truth. On the other hand, it seems that one sometimes manages to commit oneself to a belief on grounds of its usefulness irrespective of its truth or falsehood.19 (Think of those who explain and justify their 19 See C. Behan McCullagh, 'The Intelligibility of Cognitive Relativism', Monist, 67 (I984), 327-39 (PP.337-39).</page><page sequence="13">JOHN ALCORN AND DARIO DEL PUPPO 877 religious beliefs by the solace these provide.) Leopardi's late stance on this complex issue comprises two aspects which differ in the direction of fit between beliefs and the world.20 Consider first the standard case in which beliefs are intended to fit the world as it is. Leopardi doubts that we can choose to believe useful illusioni: the historical development of Reason has undermined humankind's capacity to form and hold such beliefs. He is certain, however, that belief qua action is possible for noble minds in the special case of bitter truths, for in this case there is no conflict with Reason. By contrast, bitter truths are blocked by harmful illusioni in non-noble minds, through the mechanisms of wishful thinking and self-deception. This aspect of Leopardi's late stance squares well with Bernard Williams's remark that 'a correct understanding of how [... ] true factual beliefs are formed has no tendency to undermine them, while the opposite is typically true of ideological beliefs [...]. This is a truth - admittedly far from clear - at the heart of the Enlightenment enterprise' (Shame and Necessity, p. 216, n. 53). The other aspect subverts the standard direction of fit between beliefs and the world. In the concluding lines of the solidarity stanza (11. I45-57 above), Leopardi states that the necessary and sufficient condition for securing the foundations of the good society is that noble beliefs be commonly held. Indeed, if as a rule persons believe that Nature is the enemy, that one should embrace others in true love, extending and expecting help, that horror before Nature is the root of the social bond, and so on, then ipso facto there is human community against Nature. If each holds that Nature is the enemy, then Nature is the enemy. Noble beliefs are self-fulfilling when generally shared. This is a case in which 'saying makes it so', provided there is general agreement. The poetry in 'La ginestra' conjoins the informative, expressive, and directive functions of language. Leopardi implicitly rejects the Ancien-Regime, juridical definition of nobility, yet retains the word. The definition he proposes is at once stipulative and theoretical. The overarching purpose of his redefinition is to influence attitudes, a purpose admitting two measures of success. First, assuming that the force of art and argument can change language, a criterion of success is whether Leopardi's stipulative definition becomes a lexical definition (a conven- tion). Authoritative lexicographical evidence as well as casual observation and introspection suggest that his use ofnobil natura has been less successful than his uses ofnatura in shaping language.21 However, the matter is complicated by the fact that his metaphor for the noble life, the desert flower, is widely recognized as a symbol of nobility (see below, Section vi). Secondly, and more ambitiously, assuming that the force of art and argument can change beliefs and dispositions, a criterion of success is whether Leopardi's theoretical definition becomes a social norm. As he puts it, noble thoughts must again become palesi (1. 146). Poetry is the mechanism. In the beginning was horror before Nature; the golden age of human community was when the people knew and felt this horror. Why have 20 On the notion of 'direction of fit', compare Michael Smith, 'The Humean Theory of Motivation', Mind, 96 (I987), 36-6i. 21 To judge from II grande dizionario della lingua italiana, ed. by Salvatore Battaglia and Giorgio Barberi Squarotti (Turin: UTET, 1961- ), xi (1981), ad voces, Leopardi's redefinition of nobil natura did not become lexical convention. Among the many definitions provided for nobile and nobilta, none conforms to Leopardi's redefinition of 'La ginestra'; the poem is not cited by the lexicographers (pp. 458-63). By contrast, Leopardi's art looms large in the lexical definitions of natura; definitions 2, 7, and 8 cite 'La ginestra' or other Canti expressing meanings also found in 'La ginestra' (pp. 224-30).</page><page sequence="14">878 Social Art in Leopardi they forgotten? Their beliefs about society, and hence about cooperation, are distorted by an availability heuristic:22 the present experience of living within strife-ridden society prevents the people from imagining the state of nature, which in turn prevents them from imagining the possibility of human community. Poetry can remind the people of the horror of Nature. Leopardi is both a poet and a theorist, and the poetry contributes to the force of the theory. Hume writes: The least reflection dissipates the illusions of poetry, and places the objects in their proper light. 'Tis however certain, that [... ] a poet has a counterfeit belief, and even a kind of vision of his objects: And if there be any shadow of argument to support this belief, nothing contributes more to his full conviction than a blaze of poetical figures and images, which have their effect upon the poet himself, as well as upon his readers. (I.3.x) In the solidarity stanza there is more than a shadow of argument: there is a tight sketch of a theory of cooperation that has originality and substance. Leopardi shows that the scope of cooperation depends upon the dynamic interactions of motive- types (nobles and fools), that the disposition to cooperate (nobility) is a complex of motives, and that the mix of motives in society can change with enlightenment. To make insights palesi (to enlighten) requires the vivid, binding, anthropomorphic imagery of art. Conjoining argument and art, communicative and dramaturgical action, Leopardi creates a blaze of poetical figures and images in the belief that poetry, by making noble thoughts palesi, can make minds noble. v. Evocation of sympathy Any ambitious project of widening the scope of solidarity cannot limit itself to cognitive exhortation. It must also speak to the imagination in another way, by evoking sympathy. In 'La ginestra' Leopardi gives due attention to the affective basis of solidarity in his imaginative rendering of others' experience of the scene at Vesuvius. He expresses an unusual and poignant sympathy for the plight of the peasant whose marginal existence roots him in that scene, placing him and his family at the mercy of Vesuvius (11. 240-68), and he conjures the surrealism of the scene from the mobile outsider's point of view (11. 269-88). These sympathetic passages round out the expression of emotions in the poem, counterbalancing the negative emotions expressed in his dramaturgical action. It is true that in the passages in which the poet is the subject, Leopardi makes claims to truth, rightness, and sincerity. But it is in the nature of argument that such claims tend to be viewed with suspicion when they coincide too closely with the self-interest of the one who puts them forward.23 Moreover, sincerity in negative emotions is less conducive to recognition, as distinct from appreciation, than sincerity in positive emotions. Leopardi's evocation of the peasant's situation is disinterested, and his description of the faceless traveller's vision transports the reader to the scene, onstage. Hence the validity claims he makes are correspondingly more forceful. Indeed, we, too, feel sympathy for the peasant and identify with the traveller. It is in these sympathetic verses that Leopardi grounds communicative action in the expression of emotions. 22 See Judgement under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases, ed. by Daniel Kahneman and others (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982), pp. I I-I4 and Part Iv. 23 SeeJon Elster, 'Strategic Uses of Argument', Legal Theory Workshop Series (Toronto: University of Toronto Faculty of Law, I992), p. 7.</page><page sequence="15">JOHN ALCORN AND DARIO DEL PUPPO 879 The workings of sympathy are theorized by Hume: 'No quality of human nature is more remarkable, both in itself and in its consequences, than the propensity we have to sympathize with others, and to receive by communication their inclinations and sentiments, however different from, or even contrary to our own. [... ] As in strings equally wound up, the motion of one communicates itself to the rest.' We do not know the emotions of others directly. Rather, we form an idea of them by our familiarity with their causes and effects: the circumstances that occasion them and their outward manifestations (I. .xi; III.3.i). The strength of sympathy is governed by two kinds of relation between persons, resemblance and contiguity: 'Resem- blance must very much contribute to make us enter into the sentiments of others [... ]. The stronger the relation is betwixt ourselves and any object, the more easily does the imagination make the transition [...]. Nor is resemblance the only relation, which has this effect [... ]. The sentiments of others have little influence, when far remov'd from us, and require the relation of contiguity, to make them communicate themselves entirely' (I.I.xi). In this light it is plain that the social divide between the reader of 'La ginestra' and the peasantry is an obstacle to sympathy. On the other hand, as Hume concedes, "Tis true, there is no human, and indeed no sensible, creature, whose happiness or misery does not, in some measure, affect us, when brought near to us, and represented in lively colours' (III.2.i). Is there a special place for art in the workings of sympathy? The dread, anxiety, and misery of the peasant are palpable in 'La ginestra'. Notice, how, in conformity with Hume's theory, Leopardi vividly describes the causes and effects of the peasant's emotions in order to communicate the emotions to the reader: E il villanello intento Ai vigneti, che a stento in questi campi Nutre la morta zolla e incenerita, Ancor leva lo sguardo Sospettoso alla vetta Fatal, che nulla mai fatta piu mite Ancor siede tremenda, ancor minaccia A lui strage ed ai figli ed agli averi Lor poverelli. E spesso II meschino in sul tetto Dell'ostel villereccio, alla vagante Aura giacendo tutta notte insonne, E balzando piu volte, esplora il corso Del temuto bollor, che si riversa Dall'inesausto grembo Su l'arenoso dorso, a cui riluce Di Capri la marina E di Napoli il porto e Mergellina. E se appressar lo vede, o se nel cupo Del domestico pozzo ode mai l'acqua Fervendo gorgogliar, desta i figliuoli, Desta la moglie in fretta, e via, con quanto Di lor cose rapir posson, fuggendo, Vede lontan l'usato Suo nido, e il picciol campo, Che gli fu dalla fame unico schermo, Preda al flutto rovente, Che crepitando giunge, e inesorato Durabilmente sovra quei si spiega. (1. 240)</page><page sequence="16">880 Social Art in Leopardi Evocation of sympathy and cognitive exhortation in comparative perspective Leopardi's depiction of the peasant's wretched lot invites comparison with an arresting description written at the close of the seventeenth century by another distinguished literary moralist, Jean de La Bruyere: L'on voit certains animaux farouches, des males et des femelles, repandus par la campagne, noirs, livides et tout brules de soleil, attaches a la terre qu'ils fouillent et qu'ils remuent avec une opiniatrete invincible; ils ont comme une voix articulee, et quand ils se levent sur leurs pieds, ils montrent une face humaine, et en effet ils sont des hommes; ils se retirent la nuit dans des tanieres ou ils vivent de pain noir, d'eau et de racines; ils epargnent aux autres hommes la peine de semer, de labourer et de recueillir pour vivre, et meritent ainsi de ne pas manquer de ce pain qu'ils ont seme.24 For our purposes, Leopardi's depiction differs from La Bruyere's in three ways. It bridges the social divide between the reader and the peasantry effortlessly and naturally, whereas La Bruyere's lingers on the near side, dwelling on the distortion wrought by distance, before making the moral leap. It is alive to the peasant's emotions, whereas La Bruyere's has but room for the 'obstinacy' with which the peasants toil. And it is concerned with the peasant's vulnerability to natural disaster whereas La Bruyere's focuses on the requirements of distributive justice for those who bear the burden of everyday struggle with Nature for the fruits of the earth. How might these differences be characterized more generally? La Bruyere is reminding us of the boundaries of the human race. Leopardi is putting us in the peasant's shoes. The emotional effect of Leopardi's poetry is thus more closely related to Hume's notion of sympathy. La Bruyere's description of the peasantry is an instance of cognitive exhortation, speaking principally to the intellect, whereas Leopardi's depiction of the peasant is a narrative evocation of sympathy, speaking principally to the emotions. Each involves the faculty of imagination. The concepts of cognitive exhortation and evocation of sympathy can illuminate social art in media other than literature. To illustrate, consider two celebrated nineteenth-century paintings that depict in some way Leopardi's theme of the toiler's harsh lot. The Gleaners (1857), by Jean-Francois Millet, is close in effect to La Bruyere's description of the peasantry. There is no depiction of the subjects' emotional life; rather, the lack of individuality in the depiction of the subjects com- municates the inhumanity, and hence injustice, of their lot. The painting is thus an example of cognitive exhortation. The Potato Eaters ( 885), by Vincent Van Gogh, at first glance has an effect similar to that of Millet's depiction of the gleaners. Closer observation, however, reveals poignant emotions and individuality among the subjects, who take their humble meal together. Van Gogh's painting achieves both cognitive exhortation and evocation of sympathy. A related distinction can be observed in three paintings that depict instances of humankind's vulnerability before the awesome, indifferent, and destructive phenomenology of Nature, a central theme of 'La ginestra'. In The Shipwreck (I805), by J. M. W. Turner, the horror of the sublime is rendered without depicting the emotions of those aboard the stormswept ship. In The Raft of the Medusa (1819), Theodore Gericault renders the range of the shipwrecked sailors' emotions, from despair to deliverance, with individuality and vivid detail. Gericault's chosen facet of the sublime is not Nature's destructive fury, as in Turner's painting, but her immense indifference, and he 24 'De 1'Homme', in Les Caracteres ou Les Moeurs de ce siecle, ed. byJulien Benda (Paris: Gallimard, 195 ), p. 333 (No. 128).</page><page sequence="17">JOHN ALCORN AND DARIO DEL PUPPO couples it with concrete, emphatic, and dynamic evocation of sympathy. As in Leopardi's poem, the emotions are rendered by depicting the circumstances that occasion them and their outward manifestations. The Wreck of the Hope (I824), by Kaspar David Friedrich, is a work that eludes the distinction between cognitive exhortation and evocation of empathy. It achieves subtle effects by departing sufficiently from none the less recognizable aesthetic conventions to stimulate the imagination. The wreck must be deciphered from what at first appears to be a geometry of fragments. The stillness of the aftermath of utter destruction and the telling absence of human subjects invite us to imagine the story of the wreck. Leopardi does something similar in his description of the way a faceless traveller (the transported reader) experiences the fragmented geometry of the scene at Pompeii: Torna al celeste raggio Dopo l'antica obblivion l'estinta Pompei, come sepolto Scheletro, cui di terra Avarizia o pieta rende all'aperto; E dal deserto foro Diritto infra la file Dei mozzi colonnati il peregrino Lunge contempla il bipartito giogo E la cresta fumante, Che alla sparsa ruina ancor minaccia. E nell'orror della secreta notte Per li vacui teatri, Per li templi deformi e per le rotte Case, ove i parti il pipistrello asconde, Come sinistra face Che per voti palagi atra s'aggiri, Corre il baglior della funerea lava, Che di lontan per l'ombre Rosseggia e i lochi intorno intorno tinge. (1. 269) The fullness and parsimony with which 'La ginestra' achieves the whole range of effects noted in these paintings is impressive. The limits to sympathy A work of social art that trades in fellow feeling measures itself against the limits to sympathy. Hume himself notes that human nature comprises another propensity, intimately related to that of sympathy, but contrary in its effects: the mechanism of self-centred comparison. 'The direct survey of another's pleasure naturally gives us pleasure, and therefore produces pain when compar'd with our own. His pain, consider'd in itself, is painful to us, but augments the idea of our own happiness, and gives us pleasure' (II.2.viii). Self-centred comparison may shade over into the workings of envy, which include the enjoyment and provocation of envy in others. All these mechanisms vary in strength with the resemblance and contiguity of the object of comparison. Where self-centred comparison does not override sympathy, there remains a practical limit to sympathy. In a memorable passage Adam Smith expresses scepticism about the strength and scope of sympathy, not as an emotion or sentiment but as a motive for solidarity. In the first portion of the passage the 30 881</page><page sequence="18">882 Social Art in Leopardi hypothetical protagonist bears an uncanny resemblance ante litteram to the author of 'La ginestra': Let us suppose that the great empire of China, with all its myriads of inhabitants, was suddenly swallowed up by a earthquake, and let us consider how a man of humanity in Europe, who had no sort of connection with that part of the world, would be affected upon receiving intelligence of this dreadful calamity. He would, I imagine, first of all, express very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people, he would make many melancholy reflections upon the precariousness of human life, and the vanity of all the labours of men, which could thus be annihilated in a moment.25 But Smith then argues that such awareness and insight make no practical difference; that the experience of sympathy need not produce solidarity: And when all this fine philosophy was over, when all these humane sentiments had been fairly expressed, he would pursue his business or his pleasure, take his repose or his diversion, with the same ease and tranquility, as if no such accident had happened. The most frivolous disaster which could befall himself would occasion a more real disturbance. If he was to lose his little finger tomorrow, he would not sleep tonight; but, provided he never saw them, he will snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred millions of his brethren. Can a wordsmith, such as Leopardi, increase the force and widen the scope of sympathy, and make it a motive for solidarity, by bringing its potential object near and representing it in lively colours? Leopardi addresses a related issue in one of his Operette morali, 'I1 Parini ovvero della gloria', written twelve years before 'La ginestra' (Tutte le opere, I, I 117-33). The subject of the essay is the limits to appreciation and recognition (gloria) confronting great authors. Leopardi explores reader response and notes a number of psycho- logical and sociological mechanisms that distort it. He also states that some persons are incapable of adequate response, 'gli uomini naturalmente tardi e freddi di cuore e d'immaginazione [... ] non potendo in parte alcuna immedesimare l'animo proprio con quello dello scrittore' (I, 12 ). He concludes that, though to be an artist is an affliction, the artist must pursue his work as virtue demands, for some small good may come of it. It seems that the Leopardi of'La ginestra' is more sanguine, thanks to the reconciliation of Reason and poetry, which jointly make noble insights palesi. In addition to providing entertainment, representations trading in sympathy can be a source of two social goods: the deepening of socialization by rehearsing and exploring social norms that coordinate expectations in a given society; and the recasting of one's sense of self and imagined community. John White captures the distinction: Can the aesthetic experience of art help to make us morally better people? [...] We [...] need to be clear about what is at issue. Is it that art can help to turn the egoist into an altruist? Or, since engaging with it often depends on one's already possessing a capacity for sympathetic involvement, does it, rather, reinforce our altruistic dispositions in us individually and collectively? Prima facie, the second suggestion seems more plausible than the first; but the issue is, finally, an empirical one.26 25 The Theory of Moral Sentiments, ed. by D. D. Raphael and A. L.

We return to this problem in Section vn. vI. The desert flower as metaphor and symbol Leopardi achieves a brilliant fusion of stylized presentation of self, evocation of empathy, and communicative action in the image of the desert flower, an image at once a mask, an object of empathy, and a model for the self. In the final stanza he gathers the threads of the poem and weaves them into a metaphor for the noble life: E tu, lenta ginestra, che di selve odorate queste campagne dispogliate adorni, anche tu presto alla crudel possanza soccomberai del sotterraneo foco, che ritornando al loco gia noto, stendera l'avaro lembo su tue molli foreste. E piegherai sotto il fascio mortal non renitente il tuo capo innocente: ma non piegato insino allora indarno codardamente supplicando innanzi al futuro oppressor; ma non eretto con forsennato orgoglio inver le stelle, ne sul deserto, dove e la sede e i natali non per voler ma per fortuna avesti; ma piu saggia, ma tanto meno inferma dell'uom, quanto le frali tue stirpi non credesti o dal fato o da te fatte immortali. (1. 297) In these lines stylized presentation of self is expressed through an ingenious formal device, the altercasting of an anthropomorphic object indirectly resembling the poet. This device relaxes tension between subjectivity and objectivity, inviting the reader to share Leopardi's point of view by identifying with a metaphor. There is evocation of empathy, as the description of the desert flower's circumstances, attitudes, and actions suggests a feeling of serenity, quite unlike the peasant's anxiety. Here, too, Leopardi ably resolves a tension which he has artfully built up in the poem. In his metaphor the source of serenity is insight; cognitive courage and noble beliefs are ascribed to the desert flower, reminding the reader of the poem's cognitive exhortation. C. Behan McCullagh's work on metaphor can shed light on the desert flower.27 A metaphor can have more than one kind of value. In addition to aesthetic value, it can have cognitive value, for metaphors are claims to truth. 'A metaphorical sentence is metaphorically true whenever an approximate statement of its metaphorical mean- ing is literally true' (p. 33). Metaphors have peculiar cognitive value because they enable one 'to communicate information when literal speech fails' (p. 33). Consider the cognitive value of Leopardi's metaphor. There are features of the noble life which literal descriptions, such as those in the solidarity stanza, can only approxi- mately reveal. One such feature is the shape and unity of the noble life; another is the quality of the noble's wisdom and dignity; still another is the quality of nobility as a 27 'Metaphor and Truth in History', Clio, 23 (1993), 23-49.</page><page sequence="20">884 Social Art in Leopardi public good (see below, 11. 34-37). These features are instead precisely conveyed by metaphorical description in the image of the fragrant desert flower. Metaphors can also have practical value. In so far as Leopardi's descriptions of nobility are an artist's attempt to change a convention of language and to re-establish a social norm (see above, Section iv), then his metaphor is as much a claim to rightness as a claim to truth. Moreover, metaphors can have practical value as claims to rightness in another sense, when they suggest that 'our attitude to the metaphorical object should also be our attitude to the subject of the metaphorical statement' (p. 36). Finally, metaphors engage our subjectivity: 'Metaphorical descriptions challenge the reader to find resemblances between the subject and the metaphorical object' (p. 39). In all these ways Leopardi's metaphor contributes to communicative action and to the integration of aesthetic, cognitive, and practical value in the poem. It also invites comparison with another engaging metaphor for the noble life, Blaise Pascal's image of the thinking reed: L'homme n'est qu'un roseau, le plus faible de la nature; mais c'est un roseau pensant. Il ne faut pas que l'univers entier s'arme pour l'ecraser: une vapeur, une goutte d'eau, suffit pour le tuer. Mais quand l'univers l'ecraserait, l'homme serait encore plus noble que ce qui le tue, puisqu'il sait qu'il meurt, et l'avantage que l'univers a sur lui; l'univers n'en sait rien. Toute notre dignite consiste donc en la pensee. C'est de la qu'il faut nous relever et non de l'espace et de la duree, que nous ne saurions remplir. Travaillons donc a bien penser: voila le principe de la morale.28 'La ginestra' and Pascal's pensee have several elements in common: the representa- tion of human vulnerability by a botanical metaphor; the notion that space and time are dimensions that dwarf humankind; the association of thought and nobility; the conception of'right thinking' as an action, and its association with morality. A vivid difference lies in the presence of subordinate metaphors for poetry and solidarity in the image of the desert flower, as Leopardi's descriptions emphasize its fragrance and beauty (11. 5-8, 297-99), attributes which are at once manifestations of its nature and public goods. Like expressions of pity, they bring solace: e quasi i danni altrui commiserando, al cielo di dolcissimo odor mandi un profumo, che il deserto consola. (1.34) Each author's metaphor is a claim to truth and rightness, a model for the self. From a like conception of dignity, Leopardi's metaphor enlarges Pascal's vision of nobility to embrace social art and solidarity. A hope of the solidarity stanza, that poetry can renew the scope of solidarity by making noble insights palesi, is tested in the grip of the metaphor of the desert flower as a model for the self. The metaphor is so vivid and apt that it has become an enduring symbol of nobility. McCullagh's work on symbol can illuminate this acquired meaning of the desert flower.29 Symbols can stand in one or more of four kinds of relation to what they symbolize: resemblance, contiguity, manifestation, and instantiation (p. 303). Simple examples of each are the following.

The Nazi Holocaust, symbol of the persecution of the Jews, is an extreme instance of this persecution. A more complex example is the owl, symbol of wisdom: 'Owls resemble big-headed, inscrutable people, [who are] manifestations of wisdom' (p. 299). The fragrant desert flower, symbol of the noble life, also involves a complex of re- semblance and manifestation, but with a different structure: it resembles the noble life which Leopardi manifests. It is to be expected that the symbol should have this structure, for the desert flower is both a metaphor (and thus involves a relation of resemblance) and an expression of the poet's stylized presentation of self. Notice that the relations which, according to Hume, contribute to sympathy (resemblance and contiguity) are a subset of the four kinds of symbolic relation discerned by McCullagh. So a common relation of resemblance can be involved in metaphor, sympathy, and symbol. This is the case in the image of the desert flower, which thus has a complex effect, eliciting interpretation of a metaphor, empathy (sympathy), and recognition of a symbol. In sum, the image of the desert flower integrates many of the poem's elements and modalities. That Leopardi's metaphor has become a cherished symbol is a measure of the poem's effectiveness as dramaturgical and communicative action. vii. Aesthetic decentring and the generalization of the sublime It would be misleading to describe Leopardi's sensibility wholly in terms of the sublime, within Kant's schema. Other poems express a deep feeling for Nature's charms, and there is a touch of this in the image of the desert flower. None the less, 'La ginestra' is atypical of Leopardi's auvre in its relentless expression of the sublime, which colours the poem's whole philosophy and sensibility. This generalization of the sublime is anchored in a distinctive point of view which we shall call aesthetic decentring. To elucidate this notion a few preliminary remarks about Leopardi's philosophical materialism and its bearing on his art are in order. Materialism is variously a theory of the world and a theory of consciousness. As a theory of the world, it is the belief that the external world had an existence independent of, and prior to, the existence of humankind. As a theory of conscious- ness, materialism has two basic senses, one weak and one strong. The weak sense is the view that mind is a substance different from, but causally dependent on, matter. The strong sense is the theory that mind is matter under a different description. Sebastiano Timpanaro, who has most deeply explored Leopardi's materialism and its implications for his art, defines materialism thus: Per materialismo intendiamo anzitutto il riconoscimento della priorita della natura sullo 'spirito', o, se vogliamo, del livello fisico sul biologico e del biologico sull'economico-sociale e culturale: sia nel senso di priorita cronologica (il lunghissimo tempo trascorso prima che la vita apparisse sulla terra, e dall'origine della vita all'origine dell'uomo), sia nel senso del condizionamento che tuttora la natura esercita sull'uomo e continuera ad esercitare almeno in un futuro prevedibile. [... ] Non si pu6, in altri termini, negare o eludere l'elemento di passivita che c'e nell'esperienza [... ].30 Timpanaro's definition is thus a composite of the theories of the independence of the external world and the causal dependence of mind on matter, together with a sense 30 Sul materialismo, 2nd edn, revised and enlarged (Pisa: Nistri Lischi, 1975), p. 7. 885</page><page sequence="22">886 Social Art in Leopardi of the human condition that recalls Hume's remark about 'the scanty provision nature has made for [human] wants' (Iii.iI.I). Leopardi himself goes further, expressing the belief that mind is matter (let us call his position strong common-sense materialism) in a notebook entry dated 17 September 1827: Che la materia pensi, e un fatto. Un fatto, perche noi pensiamo; e noi non sappiamo, non conosciamo di essere, non possiamo conoscere, concepire, altro che materia. Un fatto, perche noi veggiamo che le modificazioni del pensiero dipendono totalm. dalle sensazioni, dallo stato del nostro fisico; che l'animo nostro corrisponde in tutto alle varieta ed alle variazioni del nostro corpo. Un fatto, perche noi sentiamo corporalm. il pensiero: ciascun di noi sente che il pensiero non e nel suo braccio, nella sua gamba; sente che egli pensa con una parte materiale di se, cioe col suo cervello, come egli sente di vedere co' suoi occhi, di toccare colle sue mani. (Zibaldone, I, 2,405 (MS p. 4,288)) These distinctions enable us to see that 'La ginestra' is saturated with those aspects of Leopardi's thought which fit Timpanaro's definition of materialism, yet is untinged by Leopardi's strong common-sense materialism. The poem does not express a position on the mind-body problem, nor does it presuppose one in order to work as social art. It works by generalizing the sublime. How 'La ginestra' works bespeaks the artist's situation in the modern world, marked by the progressive extension of scientific inquiry to all phenomena. A general aim of modern science is to reduce phenomenological descriptions, how humans perceive the world, to abstract physical descriptions in terms of natural kinds. Erwin Panofsky notes that already in the seventeenth century 'the very fact that the world of observational science was increasingly dominated by telescopic and microscopic instrumentation served to estrange it from the world of the [visual] artist'.31 James S. Ackerman states that for a period poetry and prose developed in symbiosis with science: 'The written image proved to be sensitive to the kind of natural phenomenon newly revealed by science, while the painted image was not', and 'since science and literature shared a common language, it was possible for literary style as well as content to be influenced by scientific prose'.32 We suggest that a limit to this symbiosis is the extension of science to the study of consciousness itself: the transformation of strong common-sense materialism into cognitive science. However much Leopardi or any social artist might identify with this line of inquiry in the abstract, he cannot make it the substance of his art: a poem describing horror before Nature in the language of modifications of materia, much less neural networks, would be so radically divorced from the language of common perception and feeling to be a curiosum rather than social art. (Perhaps the circle of cognitive scientists, steeped in a specialized language and imagery, would appreciate such a poem.) To clarify the bearing of this thesis on our conception of'La ginestra' as social art, we come full circle to O'Hear's work on art and science. Leopardi's vision has an element in common with scientific objectivity, in which 'the human being is seen as part of a wider and more inclusive causal process, and [... ] of no more significance than any other incident in the development of the cosmos' (The Element ofFire, p. 15). 31 'Artist, Scientist, Genius: Notes on the "Renaissance-Dammerung"', in The Renaissance: Six Essays, ed. by Wallace K. Ferguson and others (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1962), pp. 12 -82 (p. 178). 32 'Science and Visual Art', in Seventeenth Century Science and the Arts, ed. by Hedley Howell Rhys (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 196I), pp.63-90 (pp.64, 65). As an example of this symbiosis, Ackerman refers to John Donne's cosmological metaphors.</page><page sequence="23">JOHN ALCORN AND DARIO DEL PUPPO 887 Each rejects anthropocentrism in this way. But there is a basic difference, too. In science, 'our sensations and perceptions are taken to be secondary rather than primary qualities of things, and the world centring on us and our sensory modalities largely an illusion due to those modalities', such that 'the image of the world given to us in science is one we could not perceive at all' (pp. 14, I I). By contrast, Leopardi's conception of the way things are is rooted in human sensory modalities: the experience of the vaulted night, of the fragments of Pompeii, and so on. His rejection of anthropocentrism is partial, for it is rooted in a human perspective, unlike science, which seeks to describe the world from no point of view at all. These two ways of rejecting anthropocentrism can be called scientific decentring and aesthetic decentring. The scope of scientific decentring is so wide that 'no one can actually live out the scientific perspective' (p. 84). The narrower scope of Leopardi's aesthetic decentring instead defines a point of view the reader can recognize and live out. The sublime evokes an experience of alienation from Nature. Aesthetic decentring thus expresses subjective alienation, an artist's sense of a lack of meaning. In 'La ginestra', a sense of shared alienation from Nature is the ground of Leopardi's conception of human solidarity. It is this Romantic element in his vision, more than the elements of philosophical materialism, that suggests a comparison to Marx's vision. There is a partial affinity between Leopardi's conception of alienation and a strand in Marx's complex theory of alienation. In Leopardi's vision humankind is objectively alienated from Nature, and shared awareness of objective alienation, a shared sense of alienation, moves humankind to establish the good society. In Marx's vision class society is marked by several kinds of objective alienation: of humankind from its 'species being', of workers from the products of their labour, of workers from the labour process, and of workers from fellow workers; shared awareness of one or more of these moves workers to establish communism. Though Marx sometimes argues that contemporary history involves processes in which objective alienation itself begets a sense of alienation, he, like Leopardi, turns all his powers to cognitive exhortation and dramaturgical and communicative action to help bring about the transition from objective alienation to a shared sense of alienation and solidarity. There are, of course, great differences here between Leopardi and Marx. Whereas Leopardi predicts and promotes human solidarity in an ineliminable conflict with Nature, Marx predicts and promotes working-class solidarity in an historical conflict with the class of capitalists. In Leopardi's vision a shared sense of alienation from Nature is the glue of the good society. In Marx's vision communism eliminates alienation altogether.33 We said above (Section v) that it is a real question whether art which evokes sympathy widens the scope of solidarity. We may also wonder whether art which elicits a sense of shared alienation contributes to human solidarity, and what the device of aesthetic decentring contributes to the force of social art. O'Hear writes: 'The stars were not waiting for us to perceive them, but only we could perceive them in the way we do' (p. 14). He describes, in terms that apply closely to 'La ginestra', 33 On Marx, see Jon Elster, Making Sense of Marx (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, I985), Sections 2.2.5 and 2.3.3. Though Marx accepts the independence of the external world, he does not espouse belief in either of the other senses of philosophical materialism. Elster writes: 'I do not know of any passage where Marx argues for a materialist theory of consciousness, in any one of the possible versions of such a theory' (Section 2. I . I).</page><page sequence="24">888 Social Art in Leopardi how artistic expression of human perspectives can elicit appreciation and recognition: A viable form of art has to touch on deep and universal human feelings mediated through images and forms accessible to a whole community. Only in this way can art really move us to give us the consolation and reassurance that we are indeed not alone, but members of a community of fellow sufferers and fellow revellers, and the necessary separateness of the individual and his perspective on the world brought about by our very embodiment elevated from the singularity of the 'I' to the commonality of a 'we'. (p. I48) The deep and universal human feeling that 'La ginestra' touches on is the experience of the sublime, mediated through memorable images and generalized to suggest the widest 'we'. The poem prompts one to imagine the possibility and rightness of human solidarity, and so adds a dimension to the thicket of variously circumscribed imagined communities which compete for one's attention and allegiance. viII. Conclusion Leopardi was a literary moralist, and 'La ginestra' the artistic expression of an ethos grounded in his conception of Nature and human nature. O'Hear states: 'Any viable morality has to build on biological reality: on our biological needs and weaknesses, on our natural capacities for selfishness and altruism, on our natural store of sympathy, on our sense of kin and kind' (p. I33). Leopardi builds on all these elements in 'La ginestra'. The poem is a work of social art, or dramaturgical and communicative action, aimed at securing the reader's appreciation and recognition of the authenticity and validity ofLeopardi's point of view. The point of view is built on his conception of our relation to Nature, which he generalizes from the experience of the sublime. He grapples in turn with the elements required by O'Hear: our mix of motives, the limits to sympathy, and the way we frame the dimensions of conflict and cooperation. He seeks to make us more noble, more imaginatively fellow-feeling, and more broadly solidaristic. To these ends he employs cognitive exhortation, evocation of sympathy, and aesthetic decentring, and creates a vivid metaphor and enduring symbol. 'La ginestra' is a complex poem. It would be an injustice to Leopardi not to note the appeal of the poem as a whole. This poem is an object of special affection for so many Italians, and this is the surest evidence that the whole is greater than the sum of the (already considerable) parts. It is notoriously difficult to state precisely just how a particular work of art achieves this resonance among the parts. Hume offers a general image: The several incidents of the piece acquire a kind of relation by being united into one poem or representation; and if any of these incidents be an object of belief, it bestows a force and vivacity on the others, which are related to it. The vividness of the first conception diffuses itself along the relations, and is convey'd, as by so many pipes or canals, to every idea that has any communication with the primary one. (I.3.x) Just as subterranean springs and rivers of fire produce the ecology of a fragrant flower in a lavic desert, so do hidden pipes and canals unify the poetry of 'La ginestra'.
