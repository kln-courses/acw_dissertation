<plain_text><page sequence="1">108 Two Stupa Slabs from Dupadu, Prakasam District - Coastal Andhra Pradesh Sushila Pant and V V. Subba Reddy 1.1 The village Dupadu (15°55'N Latitude, 79°20'E longitude) lies on the road connecting Vinukonda and Markapur, in Yerragondapalem taluk of Prakasam district, in Coastal Andhra Pradesh. Here is a Buddhist mound locally known as Deebegutta or Rallagutta, situated half way between a n ullah called Tigaleru and the village Dupadu. A very small scale excavation was conducted on this mound in the year 1977 by the Department of Archaeology &amp; Museums, Government of Andhra Pradesh and a stupa structure of baked bricks was exposed.1 1.2 Two vertical trenches each measuring 6 m.x 12m. were taken up for excava- tion. The first trench was laid on the northern slope of the mound and the second trench was dug out on the western slope. However, the stupa has not been completely exposed. The height of the walls of the dome is 1.80 m. as seen from the brick courses that have survived. The walls were constructed with burnt bricks of 50 x 25 x 8 cm. size. The excavation also exposed the Pradakshinapatha and Ayaka platforms on the northern and western side. The vertical face of the drum and the Ayaka platforms were found plastered twice with lime mortar.2 This may indicate two phases of masonary activity. The Ayaka platforms which might have faced the entrances on the north and west were decorated with carved, slabs. Two sculptural slabs of limestone were recovered from two different trenches from this site and at present they are exhibited at Victoria Jubilee Museum, Vijayawada. These slabs were made from a greenish yellow limestone available locally in the quarries along the river Krishna in Palnadu in Guntur district, an adjacent area of Prakasam district. The slabs can be described as follows. 1.3 Slab No. 1 is recovered from the Ayaka platform facing the northern entrance to the Pradakshnapatha. The sculpture contains the model of a stupa. The slab is 1 .72 m. in height, 0.99m. in width and 0. 12 m. in its thickness. The Medhi (a circular platform) portion of the stupa is divided into three sections. The central portion is occupied prominently by a vase. To the right side of the vase there is a throne surmounted by the Bodhi-lree and on it left side there is throne surmounted by Dharamachakra. On either side at the top of the vase there are projections which</page><page sequence="2">665 may represent Ayaka platforms on either of which stands a group of five Ayaka pillars symbolising the five important events in life of Buddha: Birth, Great Renunciation, Enlightenment, First Sermon and Nirvana. The drum is entwined by two three-hooded Nagas whose hoods come out on either side of the Harmika behind the drum. The Harmika is in the form of an inverted stepped pyramid. The top portion of the Harmika has elongated Chhatras flowing in different directions and giving the impression of Bodhi-lrcc. On either side of the stupa stands a devotee with folded hands. The central vase may be taken to represent the relic casket and the three-hooded Nagas that entwin the stupa in the posture of protecting it. Hence, this scupture may be taken to represent the Ramagrama stupa . 1.4. The inscription chiselled on the top edge of the slab in Brahmi characters on palaeographical grounds can be assigned to the Later Satavahana period i.e., 2nd- 3rd c. A.D. It is not yet deciphered but four letters can be possibly made out, reading as sa ma ka sa. But some more letters might have been lost because the left top edge of the slab is broken. 1.5 Slab No. 2 has been unearthed from the Ayaka platform just facing the western entrance to the Pradakshinapatha. But the slab does not contain any inscription. It is more exquisitely carved than the other especially in representing the stupa . The slab measures 1.63 m x 1. 16 m.x 0.18 m. in height, width and thickness respectively. The Medhi portion contains three important events in the life of the Buddha. On the central portion there is a horse coming out of a gate way symbolising Mahabhinishkramana. To its left side is a throne surmounted by the tree symbolising Sambodhi (enlightenment). On the right side is a stupa on a pedestal representing the Mahaparinirvana. The representations of those events are separated by four vertical thabas , or upright posts of railing pattern with the lotus designs at both ends and in the centre. The Harmika is like an inverted stepped pyramid. Above it, there are ornamented chhatras flowing in different directions and giving the impression of a Bodhi-Mtz. The top of the Anda just below the Harmika there are two rows of beaded garlands. The Anda proper is decorated with garlands. One devotee stands on either side of the stupa with upraised folded hands. One of them on the right side of the stupa seems to be a lady. She seems to carry a garland in her folded hands as if she was about to offfer it in worship of the stupa. Below the stupa , the lower border is embellished with a frieze of winged lions in a galloping posture. It appears that this stupa has a Pradakshinapatha edged by a railing around the Medhi. This stupa has no Ayaka platforms and Ayaka pillars. 1.6 The horse in the central part of the railing is shown as emanating from a gateway with three arches which resemble the famous Sanchi gateway. But the horse is not surmounted by a chhatra which is generally found in Bahrut and other North Indian Buddhist sculptures. 1.7 The head-dress of the devotees worshipping the stupa , in both the sculptures, is in typical Amaravati style. In both the sculptures the Harmika is elongated. In slab No. 1 it is much more elongated and even the inverted stepped pyramid above</page><page sequence="3">666 the Harmika has more steps than that in slab No. 2 This elongated Harmika in the form of stepped pyramid might have been the result of the influence of the Buddhist art of western caves. In slab No. 2 as noted above there is a row of running winged lions. It is generally held that the winged animals are one of the peculiar features of the North-Western School or Gandhara School of Sculpture. 1.8 Thus, the sculptures represent a combination of several influences i.e., the north-western the western, the northern and that of the Krishna Valley. We find such influences even in Chandavaram in the same district, where a sculptured stupa has been exposed on a hill. This region on the basis of sculptures of Chandavaram and Dupadu appears to have been a meeting place of several influences. It is likely that the two places Chandavaram and Dupadu were at a converging point of trade routes from the North, West and the East leading to Banavasi, the provincial headquarters of the Satavahanas in Karnataka. 1 .9 As the Buddha is not represented in anthropomorphic form but symbolised by the ßod/n- tree, the throne, IheDharamachakra, and the horse the sculptures may be assigned to the early stage in the history of Buddhist art or to the period before the emergence fo Mahayanism. The two slabs sculptured slightly in bold relief speak eloquently of the skill and craftsmanship of the contemporary artists who could express the rhythm of their inner feelings through their mastery over chisel and hammer. Though the scheme is restricted in area, the artist never failed either in the special arrangement of different components of his frame of in achieving superb plasticity by employing smoothly flowing curves. If a systematic excavation is done at Dupadu many more interesting points in the cultural history of Andhra in general and Prakasam district in particular may come to light. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1.
