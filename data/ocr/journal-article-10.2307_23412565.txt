<plain_text><page sequence="1">בקרת תהיה SAMUEL E. LOEWENSTAMM — Hebrew University of Jerusalem Lev. 19:20) has recently been explained to mean "(claim for)) בקרת The noun indemnity" on the strength of Akkadian baqru. The alleged Akkadian etymon, however, has invariably the sense of a claim in rem, and never that of a claim for indemnity. A structual analysis of the law concerned leads to the conclusion that the time ,honoured interpretation "inquiry" fits the context of the noun perfectly THE BIBLICAL CLAIM OF ESTABLISHMENT J. LICHT — Tel-Aviv University Moses' proclamation "This day you have become a people unto the Lord your God" (Deut. 27:9), though rhetorically exaggerated, betrays the orator's inclination to see the Covenant of the Plains of Moab as a decisive constitutive event. Several slightly less explicit statements to this effect can be easily found in Deut. (26:17-19; 29: 9-12; et al). The quality of a constitutive act can be discerned in the several formulations of the Sinai Covenant (Ex. 19-20; 24; 34), in the Exodus, and in the Promise to the Patriarchs: each conveys in its own way the notion of a definitive beginning; with each Israel started its existence in a slightly different sense. Told in a single narrative sequence, these stories convey the notion of Israel's origins as a process; they are differing expressions of the single underlying claim that Israel was established by a definitive divine act, both in its relationship to its God and its very existence. This claim is common to the more clearly expressed ideas of election and covenant, it is also implied by the narrative theme of the Exodus. It is an idea not VII</page><page sequence="2">fully crystallized, variously conceived and conveyed by slightly overlapping and mildly competing themes of OT historical thought. Its background existence is betrayed by the paradoxical statement of Deut. 27:9: Israel did not really (even according to Deut. itself) become a people unto its God by virtue of Covenant of the Plains of Moab, in a single day; but the orator prefers to see things as if they were so. To take Israel's existence for granted, as something which is just there, is unthinkable to him and to most (though not all) OT writers. This article pursues Israel's claim of being established through some typical phrases, and attempts to compare the OT claims with the Roman claim of divinely ordained origins (mainly in the Aeneid), with the Greek myths about the foundations of cities and actual foundations of Greek colonies, and with some Mesopotamian data. Actual foundations of some states and the ideologies implied are also briefly surveyed. The comparison shows that Israel's claim of establishment is unique, though not altogether removed from the common experience of mankind. The OT view develops what must have been a common feature of the ancient Near East — the concept of a nation with its God — into a particular concept of national existence, which is seen as the result of definitive divine act on the stage of human history. MARAH (EXOD. 15:22-27) AND ITS POSITION BETWEEN THE EXODUS AND THE SINAI COVENANT M. Margaliot — Bar-Han University Marah must be regarded as one of the more difficult narratives of the Pentateuch. It seems to defy any attempt of a unified interpretation. According to the critical concensus, verses 25b and 26 once belonged to D, the narrative itself to J (or E), its initial and concluding itinerary notes to P. Moreover, 25b is assumed to be an ancient relic of an earlier, independent tradition of a rival promulgation of laws at Kadesh, later suppressed by the Sinai tradition. Thus the present text presupposes a complex process of development from various sources and conflicting traditions. But the exact purport of the narrative in its present version seems still to elude the modern commentator. In this article, a new attempt has been made to overcome these difficulties, starting from the assumption that the whole narrative — 6 verses altogether — may be regarded as monolithic; that the present text is actually the original one, without the need of presupposing a variety of hypothetical sources as well as uncontrollable stages in the development of assumed traditions. The solution of the exegetical problem of v. 25b proves to be rather different from what is VIII</page><page sequence="3">co:nmonly believed: no specific laws or commandments were given, at Marah, rather the nature of the divine commandment as such was defined. This solution does away with the need to posit a divergent tradition. Moreover, it fits very well into the context of the whole narrative, and has exact parallels in the OT as well as at Mari. Once it is accepted, the whole narrtive lends itself to a logical and consistent interpretation, and even more so within the broader context of the narratives starting after the exodus and culminating in the Sinai covenant.

P. Artzi) Bar-Ilan University Press, Ramat-Gan, 1978, 3-24. EMANUEL TOV - Hebrew University of Jerusalem E. Elliger and W. Rudolph, edd., Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia, Deutsche Bibelstiftung, Stuttgart 1976-1977. The new edition of the Biblia Hebraica (BH), Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS), is likely to be used much by a new generation of students and scholars, so that a detailed review is in order. BHS contains the following external innovations: (1) BHS contais but one apparatus as against two or three in BH\ (2) In addition to the remarks of the Massorah parva, BHS contains references to the Massorah magna of codex L; (3) BHS adds data from several Qumran scrolls as well as from (4) MSS from the Cairo Genizah; (5) At times, the text arrangement of BHS differs from BH. The method of notation in BHS differs from BH in the following aspects: (1) ÄZ/Scontains several remarks which merely denote differences between MT and the versions in grammatical categories (e.g., plur, sing, pass.). In these cases the Hebrew Vorlage of the versions is not retroverted. (2) The notation G* (the original text of the LXX) is used frequently. (3) BHS refrains from quoting the retroverted variants only. The deviations in the versions are now quoted first in the language of the translation, to be followed by the retroverted variants. This technique is also applied to retroverted variants which are preferred to MT. Therefore, one will not meet any more such notes as IX</page><page sequence="4">"omit with the LXX", but rather "LXX &gt;, omit"; nor "read x with the LXX", but "LXX x, read (x)". However, in these cases the evidence is blurred, because usually the ancient version forms the basis for the preferred reading, which is now presented as if it were an emendation without clear support. This applies especially to such notes as "read x, cf G", when G is actually identical with x. Also in these cases the uninitiated reader will not be able to distinguish between (retroverted) variants and emendations. The following points come to mind in an overall assessment of BHS: (1) BHS is too often imprecise with regard to the printed text, Massorah, and quotations from the versions and Hebrew sources. (2) The subjective nature of the choice of data in BHS must, of course, be accepted, but at the same time one notes too many omissions of significant data while insignificant and irrelevant details (eg., etymofogical explanations and literary judgments) are included. One notes especially the insufficient coverage of the Qumran scrolls as against a relatively large coverage of medieval Hebrew sources. (3) The coverage of the sources in the various books of the O.T. and the inclusion of emendations differs greatly from book to book. Also other inconsistencies in the system of notation are recognized. Because of its insufficient coverage, BHS is neither a suitable tool for the text specialist nor an adequate aid to the uninitiated student. For coverage of the data, one must often return to BH. ESSENE NOTES DAVID ROKEAH — Hebrew University of Jerusalem The author deals with some problems bearing of the interpretation of the Temple Scroll, which has been edited with an introduction and commentary by Yigael Yadin. He discusses two abrogations ascribed by the Mishnah (Ma'aser Sheni, V, 15) to Yohanan the High Priest: the abolition of the declaration concerning the Tithe, and the ending of the function of the Knockers. The author argues, against Yadin, that the presence in the Temple Scroll of the Rings, which replaced the Knockers, and the absence therefrom of the Tithe-declaration, may only prove that the reign of John Hyrcanus I is the terminus post quern of the compilation of the Scroll and not a terminus ante quern, as Yadin suggests. The author then analyzes the prohibitions, concerning drinking wine and anointing oneself with oil, allegedly ascribed by Josephus to the Essenes. He argues against the accepted view that such prohibitions existed, drawing support</page><page sequence="5">from their absence in Philo. Finally, the author disagrees with Yadin's attempt to connect these aleged prohibitions with the Scroll's rulings concerning the Feast of Wine and the Feast of Oil. He suggests that the ceremonies performed at these festivals were intended to permit everyone to consume the oil and wine products of the new harvest. HELLENISTIC UTOPIA AND THE ESSENES DORON MENDELS — Hebrew University of Jerusalem In this paper an attempt is made to show that Hellenistic Utopia could constitute a fruitful background for some of the Essene practices; for instance, life in segregated communities, the special position of the elders, total socio-economic equality, common meals, and asceticism. This thesis is elaborated by a detailed comparison of the sources as well as some historical considerations. JULIUS WELLHAUSEN'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW OF ANCIENT ISRAEL AND ITS FALLACIES MOSHE WEINFELD — The Hebrew University of Jerusalem In spite of its refutation by A. Dillmann and later by Y. Kaufmann, Wellhausen's theory about the lateness of the Priestly code in the Pentateuch is still dominant in the field. The date of the Priestly code (= P) is so firmly established in the eyes of western scholars that historical, cultural, literary and linguistic phenomena reflected in this source serve as criteria for dating institutions, ideas and style in Biblical literature in general. In this essay, the author challenges Wellhausen's thesis, indicating the following four major shortcomings: 1. the prejudice which underlies Wellhausen's thesis about the lateness of P. 2. the failure of his literary-critical analysis. 3. the unacceptability of Wellhausen's conclusions against the background of ancient near Eastern discoveries. 4. the fallacy in his methodology. 1. The prejudice — Wellhausen's opinion about the Pharisaic theocracy, which was the subject of his study in 1874 — four years before the Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels was published — influenced deeply his views about the the Priestly code in the Pentateuch. Since Pharisaic doctrine is based on the Torah XI</page><page sequence="6">and especially on the legislative part of the Pentateuch — which is mainly represented by P — Wellhausen logically looked for the origin of P in a proto Pharisaic environment. Because he could not find traces of the priestly law in the historical accounts of ancient Israel, he decided that this law must have been promulgated by the founders of "Judaism", especially Ezra and Nehemiah. His views about Pharisaic lore were thus projected upon P. As a result of this P was presented as stripped of any natural national-realistic background, as a dry legalistic code without any roots in land and nature, a view clearly contradicted by Leviticus 23, 25 etc. 1 Critical Analysis — His arguments concerning the development of the institutions of ancient Israelite religions i.e., a. the place of worship, b. the sacrifices c. the Festivals, d. the Priests and the Levites, and e. the priestly revenues, do not stand the critical test: a. The Tabernacle is not an invention of post-exilic Judaism as Wellhausen contends; it has roots in the period of Judges (2 Sam. 7:6) and its detailed description was influenced by the Shilo sanctuary as well as by the 'tent of David' (2 Sam. 6:17, 1 Kgs 1:19). b. The sin and guilt offerings attested in P were not developed by P, as Wellhausen argues; they are explicitly mentioned in a chronicle of the ninth century B.C.E. (2 Kgs 12:17). c. The Festivals in P are described against the background of agricultural reality (Lev. 23) and were not denaturalized, pace Wellhausen. The New Year and the day of Atonement are not mentioned in the other sources not becuse they were nonexistent but because they were not popular feasts and were mainly concerned with purification rites in the Temple performed by priests. d. The distinction between priests and Levites is of old origin and not a late invention as Wellhausen argues. The two classes are presupposed by Deuteronomy (18:1-8) and can be traced back to the early periods of Israelite history. e. The Levitical tithe and other holy gifts are rooted in ancient Israelite institutions. 3. Ancient Near-East — Detailed ritual prescriptions are not the product of late priestly speculations as Wellhausen contends. Ancient near Eastern discoveries have shown that exact instructions for ceremonies and festivals exested in all the surrounding cultures. Furthermore, in Mesopotamia and amongst the Hittites the prescribed temple rites are even more elaborate than those of the Priestly code. A complex system of purification offerings is known to us especially from the Hurrian-Hittite culture. Similarly we find there various rites of atonement and substitution offerings, including the scape-goat, which are close in nature to those found in P. Two types of temple officials are attested in the Hittite cult and their XII</page><page sequence="7">functions overlap those of the Priests and Levites in P. A highly elaborate system of festival offerings is found there which reminds us the law in Num 28-29. 4. Methodology — Wellhausen tried to explain contradictions between different laws on a historical basis only. He did not consider the possibility that divergencies can be explained on the basis of the simultaneous existence of different social circles. Thus the peculiarity of the priestly code can be explained as the result of the isoteric nature of the Jerusalemite priesthood. Nor is this Wellhausen's only methodological failing: For example, how can it be explained that a post-exilic writer dares to introduce such radical changes in the old law as annulling the release of slaves after six years, prescribed in the codes of Exodus and Deuteronomy? A more serious difficulty: P contains numerous laws which are meaningless for the post-exilic period: distribution of the land among the twelve tribes (Num. 26), the appointment of a national leader besides the high priest (Num. 27:15ff), the use of the Urim we-Tumim oracle (Num. 27:21) which fell into oblivion during the second Temple period (Ez. 2:63 - Neh. 7:65). On the other hand, one would expect to find in a law code of the post-exilic period laws which answer the needs of the time, such as prohibition of intermarriage or the service of the Levites as singers and gate-keepers which is so salient in the books of Ezra-Nehemiah and Chroniclers but completely missing in the Priestly code. UTOPIA AND REALITY IN BIBLICAL THOUGHT BENJAMIN UFFENHEIMER - Tel-Ar/V University In this paper the term Utopia is defined as the striving for what should be — the striving for the just and the proper. Hence we distinguish between two kinds of Utopia contained in the Bible: l)the practicable one, intrinsic in the ancient laws of the Sabbath and the feasts and in the social legislation pertaining to Shvi'it ( = Shmittah) and Jobel, 1) the historical Utopia of the prophets, describing the aim of Israel's history on a universal setting: this will be brought about by future divine intervention as Israel has failed in the realm of human action. 1) The practicable Utopia aims at overcoming individual death and destruction, inherent in the cyclical time-rythm of nature, by creating a tythm of recreation and rejuvenation. Insofar as this rhythm is related to Sabbath rest, it is mainly conceived as a collective imitation of the Creator's rest. As for the landed property laws their underlying assumption is God's exclusive ownership of the land. The stipulations of all these laws embrace all social strata, thus creating the preconditions of an egalitarian society. Moreover, as land was included by the XIII</page><page sequence="8">Shmittah and Jobel regulations in the rythm of renewal, these assured also the ecological environmental balance essential for the stability of every social framework. The uniqueness and historical authority of Sabbath, Shmittah and Jovel are underscored by comparison of the Biblical material with the pertinent sources stemming from the ancient Near East. 2) The earlier prophetic "historical" Utopia is Hosea's. Its essence is the antitheses of the organic conception of Canaanite paganism which was based an the principle of vitality. The new covenant between God and his people will create cosmic continuity based on the Lord's righteousness, justice, charity and mercy (Hosea 2:19). This monotheistic conception of the universe which is coined in terms of anthropomorphic-mythical language, challenges the naturalistic feature of pagan myth. Fundamentally different is Isaiah,s Utopia which is based on the assumption that Israel's fate is the very core of world history. Assyria's rise toward power is expounded as the expression of the Divine plan to use His rod of fury against His sinful people. On the other hand, in the end of the days the word of the Lord will go forth from Jerusalem to judge the nations to prevent wars and to establish peace. This vision is based on the universal extention of the pilgrim motif from ancient legal tradition and Psalm literature (comp. Is. 2:3-4 with Deut. 17:8-12 and Ps. 122:5), whereas the complementary vision of the future king consititutes a spiritualization of the ancient image of the king (comp. Isa. 11:1-5 with Pss. 2, 45, 72). Likewise the future uprooting of violence in animal nature is depicted by material from the ancient popular legend (comp. Is. 11:6-8 with Gen. 1-3). It was Deutero-Isaiah who in line with this trend expressly severed the history of Israel from the mortal bio-historical cycle dominating the history of the nations (Is. 40:1-5). His prophecy entails the final breakthrough to the linear theological concept of time, as the events forseen will surpass in their miraculousness what ancient myth and legend had related about the beginning of days (Urzeit). They will culminate in the creation of new heaven and a new earth (Is. 66:22). XIV</page><page sequence="9">THE RETURNING EXULANTS UNDER ZERUBABEL AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE SAMARITANS Joel Aloni Jerusalem Isolationism is a salient feature of the rigoristic Judaism represented by Ezra and Nehemia. In Esr. 4:1-5 a similar attitude is attributed to Zerubabel and the people who returned with him to Jerusalem, especially in their relations with the inhabitants of Samaria (here referred to as "Samaritans" for convenience sake, although they were called thus only in a later period). The question is whether this attribution is historically correct. The first six chapters of the Book of Ezra form a self-contained separate unit, both literarily and historiographically. The author of this unit embodied in these chapters various sources: (a) 4:6-6:18; (b) 2:1-3:1; (c) l:9-lla; and-possibly-(d) 1:1-4. The remaining parts of Esr. 1-6 are the author's own contribution and they exhibit marked linguistic, stylistic and conceptual affinities with the Books of Chronicles, a fact which warrants the conclusion that the author is identical with that of the Chronicles. The Chronicler has been variously dated at the end of the 5th, the 4th, and even the 3rd centuries BCE. Thus a period of 150-250 years separaied him from the events of the first return to Zion in 538-520 BCE. And indeed,׳a further examination of the author's own contribution to Esr. 1-6, and especially of 3:1-5:5, shows that his knowledge of these events (apart from the information he obtained from the above-mentioned sources and from the prophecies of Haggai and Zechariah) was scant and-in parts-blurred. The imputation to the Samaritans of preventing the building of the Temple for 18 years (Esr. 4:4-5), from 538 BCE when the Edict of Cyrus was issued until 520 BCE, the 2nd year of Darius I, is spurious: (a) it is unlikely that they could obstruct a royal edict for so long; (b) the Elders do not complain of that obstruction to the Persian governor in Esr. 5:15; (c) Haggai (1:2-4) accuses the Jews of neglecting the building of the Temple, and not the Samaritans. It seems therefore that this allegation "is a retrojection of the strained relations that existed between the Jews and the Samaritans at the time of the author. Similarly, the Jews' rejection of the offer of the Samaritans to participate XV</page><page sequence="10">in the building of the Temple (Esr. 4:3) cannot be an historical fact. Such a rejection would have meant a refusal to cooperate in matters of religion and ritual. Yet this means antedating the rift with the Samaritans to some 70 years or more before Ezra; if that were so, how could the Pentateuch, which assumed its present form at the time of Ezra or even later, have become the Holy Book of the Samaritans? Moreover, the period of the return was one of activistic universalism. It (23 ,21 ,66:18 ;6-7 ,56:3 .was propagated by Deutero- (or Trito) Isaiah (Is and by Zechariah (2:15; 8:20-23), who was a contemporary of Zerubabel and an influential political leader, vide his initiative in the building of the Temple (1:16; 4:9; 6:12-15; 8:9) and his part in the royalist-messianic movement (4:7-14; 6:9-15); his influence over Zerubabel and Jeshua is also stressed in Esr. 5:1-2; 6:14. There is a hint that Haggai, the other spiritual leader of the age, was also inclined towards universalism (Hag. 2:7). In these circumstances, is it reasonable to assume that Zerubabel and Jeshua would adopt an opposite policy of extreme isolationism? It seems that, on the contrary, there was active cooperation between the returning exulants and the Samaritans, in the religious — as opposed, perhaps, to the political — field. The fact that the complete Pentateuch was accepted by both communities, has been mentioned before. Haggai (2:4) and Zechariah (7:5) adopt a positive attitude to the "people of the land", as opposed to the marked hostility towards them in the time of Ezra. Moreover, Bet-el Sharezer and Regem-Melech, who were inhabitants of Samaria (Sellin, Auerbach), turn for guidance to the priests of Jerusalem in the 4th year of Darius I (518 BCE), i.e. two years after the building of ,4:5 .the Temple had been resumed (Zac. 7:1-3), though according to Esr the Samaritans were supposed to "frustrate their purpose". The difficult verse in Esr. 3:3 should probably read: "And they set the the peoples of the (כי באים עליהם) altar upon his bases; and there came to them lands and they offered burnt offerings thereon to the Lord etc." (cf. Graetz, Bayer, Batten). If this emendation is correct, this would be another instance of cooperation between the returning exiles and the local population, both in rebuilding the altar and in offering sacrifices. If so, the only historical fact in the story of Esr. 4:1-5 would be that the Samaritans offered to participate in the building of the Temple just as they had participated in the building of the altar. But, contrary to what is told in that story, their offer was probably accepted, as it had been accepted before. It thus appears that Zerubabel and his contemporaries at the end of the 6th century BCE acted according to the precepts of activistic universalism XVI</page><page sequence="11">as taught by the latter Isaiah and by Zechariah. It was only at the beginning of the 5th century, when the adverse effects of these precepts became apparent, such as the spread of intermarriages, that the opposing view began to gain ground, finally becoming prominent in Ezra's time, when strict measures were taken to separate "the holy seed" from the people of the land. That was "the great watershed of Israel's history" (Bright) and the birth of Judaism. The age of Zerubabel still belongs to the preceding period. THE BIBLE AS REFLECTED IN THE TEMPLE SCROLL Gershon Brin Tel-Aviv University This study establishes that the Temple Scroll was composed by the Qumran sect, and that it combines biblical and extra-biblical material to produce an organized integration of ideas according to a plan which is clear explicitly and implicitly from the text. The author of the Scroll wished to present his work as a composition of great antiquity possessing an aura of holiness. He has therefore formulated it as the direct word of God, and has attempted to give a biblical style even to material which he himself composed. This type of writing is clearly different from the language of his time. An example is the use of 'ani and 'anoki. Occasionally, however, the author "slips up," and thereby reveals the real date of his composition. The Scroll is an obvious product of calculated editing, the most important feature of which is the mosaic use of biblical passages. The passages chosen are intended to confirm the author's interpretation of the biblical laws he discusses, and for this reason a less relevant passage may be preferred to a more relevant one if it supports the author's own view. XVII</page><page sequence="12">Similarly, when the author wishes to engage in polemic against a certain practice or Scriptural interpretation, he employs the same method of selecting passages and piecing them together. When he does not find suitable verses in the Bible, he composes his mosaic of passages of his own creation (see for example, the discussion of the law of the Passover: "From the age of twenty years and over they will perform it"). The author does not refrain from inserting deliberate changes in the texts he quotes. For example, he interweaves a complex of laws concerning the Passover with Numbers 29:18, the law of the Feast of Tabernacles, in order to make use of the passage as a full catalogue of offerings, he even inserts corrections to support his view that meal-offerings are to be made along with the sin-offering. The Scroll's mosaic use of the Bible is one of the most important witnesses to the methods of composition and editing employed in ancient times. This mosaic interweaving is not monotonous but rather quite varied. Phrases and incidents from an unrelated text may be interwoven with the primary text. In other cases, the text is made up of patches of several verses, each from a different source (see the collections of laws of impurities on page 66). Alternatively, the mosaic is a combination of long and short phrases borrowed from many and varied texts (see, for example, the chapter of rebuke, page 59). May conclusions be drawn from this study of the Temple Scroll about the methods of composition used in the Bible itself? That is, are there biblical passages which are comprised of interwoven earlier sources? While the evidence seems to indicate that there are, this topic must be treated in a separate study. The author of the Scroll has a set plan for the organization of his material according to subject. He generally transmits the biblical material in the same order in which it is found in the Bible, taking care not to repeat a law. which was taken out of its biblical context and interwoven elsewhere. We also find that when a passage appears more than once in the Scroll, the author reworks the material more liberally in the "borrowed" occurrence, that is, outside of its usual context, than he does when using the biblical material in a context similar to its original one. The study of the Scroll reveals several examples of rough editing, such as dissonances between the biblical expression and the various ways in which it is used in the Scroll. These dissonances testify to the fact that the author did not have an answer to every problem which his method of editing created. XVIII</page><page sequence="13">THE VOCABULARY OF THE TEMPLE SCROLL E. Kimron Jerusalem The Temple Scroll, just as the other Judean Desert scrolls, has an essentially biblical vocabulary. In particular, words most common to the Bible, and especially to biblical books of the 2nd Temple period, occur frequently in the Scroll. The author has collected 112 expressions found in the Temple Scroll which are not attested in pre-exilic biblical books, and has shown that most of them do occur in 2nd Temple biblical writing, triumph').') נצח ,('impure') גאל ,(vestibule') אסף Examples of this type are ,('middle') אמצע Many are to be found in Rabbinic Hebrew as well, such as winding) מסבה ,(pollution) תגאלת moisture), or in Aramaic, such as) לחה רס staircase). While the Scroll also contains Persian loan-words, such as no Greeks words are attested. These findings indicate that the ,פרשר and Temple scroll was written after the 2nd Temple period had begun and that its language was influenced by Persian and Aramaic. At the same time, the large amount of lexical material in the Scroll unknown from Biblical «nd Rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic must be added to the large body of independent linguistic evidence appertaining to the Scrolls, and lends support to the theory that the Hebrew of the Scrolls is influenced by a ,so-far unknown contemporary dialect unlike Rabbinic Hebrew XIX</page></plain_text>
