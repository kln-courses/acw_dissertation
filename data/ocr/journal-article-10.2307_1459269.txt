Truth and Revelation was first written in 1947 and is the third of Berdyaev's works to appear in English translation since his death. It concerns itself with many of the subjects with which he dealt more intensively in nu- merous volumes: human freedom and destiny, the problem of history, evil and hell, the meaning of truth, redemption and creativity, and the nature of the spiritual life. The book may be regarded as an introduction to Berd- yaev's thought, set in the context of a critique of the understanding of revelation, or in other terms, of the question of God-manhood. A valid critique of the reception of revela- tion carries certain necessary conditions. Lest reason sit in final judgment the critique must be offered from the vantage point of spiritual experience itself. It must be purged of sociomorphism, the application of "slav- ish social relations" to religion. It must avoid "objectification," the disastrous sepa- ration of subject and object which destroys truth. It must manifest "the life of the Spirit" which is "in the dimension of depth." Existentia is always supreme over essentia. "Spirit is freedom, not substance." "If the existence of transcendental man be not ad- mitted, it is impossible to make any pre- tensions to the knowledge of truth." From this existential perspective various evils are avoided and various insights gained. We are delivered from fanaticism, utilitarian</page><page sequence="2">62 BOOK REVIEWS criteria of truth, individualist idolatry, fate- fulness and despair, false anthropomorphism, utopian expectations, forensic interpretations of redemption, and the blasphemous view that hell possesses ontological reality. We now recognize the identity of Truth and God as the very meaning of life (hence atheism as a form of the knowledge of God), the free and creative spirit of man, the communal and personal quality of Truth, the joyous nature of life in the Truth, a living relation between ourselves and a suffering and yearning God, and the coming salvation of the entire cos- mos. "The purifying of the knowledge of God and of the awareness of God should proceed in two directions, negatively in the direction of apprehending God as a mystery which is inexpressible in any human concepts and words whatever; and in a positive direction as the apprehension of the humanity, that is, of the divine humanity of God. This is the simple Truth of the Christian revelation." Part of Berdyaev's difficulty is epistemol- ogical. He maintains that real revelation is apprehended in spite of human distortion. This is inconsistent with his denial that the subject-object world can point beyond itself. Must we not observe that the very affirma- tion of a subject-object relation points be- yond itself to the Truth which precedes the disjunction ? A related and more serious problem is found in the fact that the criteria Berdyaev employs in criticism of alternate views of revelation can be readily turned against his own position. He attempts to escape the em- barrassment in which men always find them- selves when they witness to final religious truth, that of having to take an ultimate hu- man standpoint in the very act of denying various ultimate standpoints. Berdyaev de- nounces individualism, authoritarianism, and sociomorphism. All these debase the Chris- tian revelation. Such views derive from the categories of the present fallen world. But Berdyaev was born into the same world. He is presumptuous in his claim that he has avoided "a transference to the divine life of relations which exist in earthly life." The tragedy of Berdyaev is that so great a mind could not submit himself to take his own prescribed medicine. Or was this failure another disclosure of the mysterious tran- scendence of the human spirit? A. Roy ECKARDT Lehigh University</page></plain_text>
