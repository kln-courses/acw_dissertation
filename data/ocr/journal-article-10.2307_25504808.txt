<plain_text><page sequence="1">Language and Silence. By George Steiner. Faber. 50/-. Nabokov's Quartet. By Vladimir Nabokov. Weidenfeld and Nicholson. 21/-. In 1965 George Steiner became publicly embroiled with M. Maurice Girodias on the subject of pornography. The relevant essay is reprinted here and is typical of much of this collection in its almost hysterical insistence on the subversion of meaningfulness in the modern world and in its association of pornographic with Nazi attitudes. There is enough substance in both these fears to make one feel, at the least, profoundly uneasy. Yet Girodias had the best of the debate; he was the more nimble rhetorician. The essays of nine years which make up Language and Silence cohere in their tone, which is dourly melodramatic, and not in their more ostensible concerns. And while conceding about the whole, as we must with the essay on pornography, that Steiner's moral positions are worthy ones, it must also be said that he is his own enemy and that through eccentricities of judgment and disregard for the persuasive function of style he devalues those very virtues which he is engaged in elegising. The book is, for the most part, an elegy, though without the grace that word implies. There can hardly be anyone professionally concerned with the study of literature who sees as little hope for it as Steiner does. He is obsessed with the notion of "falling silent". Rimbaud fell silent, Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron ends in silence, undergraduates are silent on the classical references in Shakespeare, words themselves are only intelligible because divided by silence, McLuhan hints at the "Blakeian" vision of "a world falling silent". Of the reasons for this comprehensive apocalypse, the most familiar is that language itself is threatened by purely denotational codes like mathematics and music. But much more stirring to Steiner are the implications he draws from the record of Nazi and Stalinist atrocities to European Jewry. They murdered, literally and</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 315 metaphorically, that tradition with which he identifies all that was best, the tradition of Central European humanism which flourished roughly between Heine and Kafka. Most of the figures concerned wrote in German, yet "Hitler heard inside his native tongue the latent hysteria, the confusion, the quality of hypnotic trance". And in another essay we are warned that "what had happened to German is happening less dramatically elsewhere", and mass media and the press conferences of Mr. Eisenhower are the immediate examples. One waits to see whether this anthropomorphic view of language can be sustained. It can not: even German is redeemed as a living medium in a later essay on Gunter Grass, and the possible assimilation of the concentration camps to literature in one on Sylvia Plath. With all respect to the force of ieeling which led Steiner into his extremist position, this central premise of the essays is greatly weakened by the abence of argument or exemplary consistency. Steiner is extremist even as to adjectives. Scrutiny was "an utter expense of private energy"; C. P. Snow wishes to be "vitally at home" in several continents; the "unflinching audacity" of Leavis' work is its glory; Mayer's essay on Kleist cannot compare with Mann's for "sheer inwardness"; a piece of literature is habitually, and tautologically, either of "radical complexity" or "radically false". A style which leans so heavily on assertion does not help to reconcile one to such judgments as that the future of the English novel lies with Durrell, that John Cowper Powys is England's Tolstoy, or that "Simenon may be among the last to have taken an entire culture for his verbal canvas". The virtues of The Death of Tragedy are still to be found: Steiner has access to more languages than the generality of critics; he is more sympathetic to Marxist aesthetics; he is strenuously Arnoldian in his relating of litera ture to life. But while one cannot assent to his general or particular arguments, and while the author aggressively refuses to win one to them, the full value of those virtues remains to be exploited. Nabokov's Quartet consists of four stories, one written as early as 1927, the Me&amp;t in 1959. They have all, incidentally, been available in magazines quite recently, the early three in translations by Dmitri Nabokov. It is a commonplace, if an heretical one, that Nabokov's language is so brilliantly alive and intelligent that it redeems his work from occasional, though wilful, triviality or obscurity. Here the transla tion reads so clumsily, especially in would-be racy dialogue-" you'll start cooking apple-sauce in your pants.

"An Affair of Honour" is typical of early Nabokov in what the mordant style passes merciless judgment on the action, a wretched matter of a botched duel, and effectively precludes the reader from feeling for anything except the language itself. "The Visit to the Museum" is even more self-indulgent. "Lik", in its complex themes of haunting and identity, recalls its contemporary, Despair. It is set in the "miragy Riviera", though not as miragy as the locale of "Spring in Fialta", that masterpiece against the accomplishment of which these early stories should surely be judged. "The Vane Sisters" was written in America and in English, Whether because it has not been filtered through a translator, or because Nabokov's genius in this genre is happier relieved of the themes of alienation and nightmare which per vade the stories of his European exile, it is the most masterly of the quartet. The Foreword, uncommonly essential, tells us that the denoue ment of "The Vane Sisters" depends on an acrostic, which the narrator of the story does not himself see. This is a superfluous ploy: the story ends on an effective dying fall in either case. NTJALA O FAOLAIN</page></plain_text>
