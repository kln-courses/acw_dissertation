FORUM the specter of extinction: taking a long view of species loss ABSTRACT This paper explores how naturalists have engaged with the issue of wildlife extinction over the last two centuries. After a long period of resisting the notion of extinction, based on beliefs in the great chain of being and the balance of nature, naturalists finally accepted the idea in the early nineteenth century. By the end of that century, they not only began routinely documenting wildlife extinc tion but also mobilizing to stop it. That campaign led to a series of state and federal laws that culminated in the Endangered Species Act of 1973, landmark legislation that focused on rescuing individual species for the fate of extinction. A second, less prominent tradition of concern, which developed alongside this individual species approach and focused on the loss of biological communities, has garnered increasing attention in recent years. It remains to be seen, however, whether this more ecological approach to wildlife conservation will garner the political support necessary to implement it fully. Â© 2011 The Author.

With a narrative arc that echoes the diffusion of white settlers across the continent, Matthiessen details how one native species after another fell victim to overhunting, habitat destruction, competition from exotic species, and (in the case of predators and pests) systematic persecution. Although an emerging wildlife protection movement rescued some animals, a disturbing number remained imperiled or had already been lost. The foundation for Wildlife in America's compelling story was the work of naturalists, who had been grappling with the issue of species extinction for more than two centuries by the time it appeared. The predominant school of thought in that ongoing conversation-and the one most evident in Matthiessen's book-has focused on the plight of individual species. That approach dates back to the Enlightenment, when most Western thinkers rejected the very possibility of species loss because it violated views about the great chain of being, a theory that portrayed all of creation, from inert matter all the way up to God, as a single linear series.1 This deeply held idea brought together the notion of plentitude, the Platonic belief that the world remains full of all possible kinds of things, with the notions of continuity and gradation, the Aristotelian view that all kinds of organisms could be lined up in a single hierarchical series with no discernible gaps between them. The species comprising the chain of being were seen to exist in an essential depend ent relationship such that if even a single link were somehow broken, the entire edifice would crumble. In short, a strong commitment to the chain of being made extinction unimaginable. That static worldview was finally shattered in the early nineteenth century. The initial challenges came from experience with the local decline or extirpa tion of numerous species and an emerging consensus that many Native American tribes were vanishing. The continued failure to discover living repre sentatives of the many animals whose fossil remains were being unearthed including giant elephant-like beings that would have been hard to miss for the explorers busily crisscrossing the North American continent-provided addi tional threats to that worldview. The final straw came when the French compa rative anatomist Georges Cuvier clearly distinguished the fossil mastodon and mammoth both from each other and from two living species of elephants.2 By the 1820s, few doubters about the reality of extinction remained; even the American statesman and naturalist Thomas Jefferson, who had long clung to hope that the creatures whose fossil bones he had been so avidly amassing might still roam the earth, finally admitted that some species had probably been lost. Two decades later, scientific studies of several large flightless island birds-the dodo, the moa, and the great auk-demonstrated that extinc tion continued to occur in the historical era. Later in the nineteenth century, the widely chronicled demise of the passenger pigeon and the near destruction</page><page sequence="3">430 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 16 (JULY 2011) of the American bison revealed that even superabundant species with continental-wide ranges were vulnerable to human-generated population crashes.3 Increasingly, naturalists documented these and other species that seemed to be teetering on the brink of extinction. By the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries, their efforts spawned protective legisla tion initially aimed at declining game species (see Benson's contribution to this forum) and nongame birds that were falling victim to the millinery trade. By the 1950s, the gravely imperiled whooping crane had become the poster child for a growing concern about species loss. American wildlife conser vationists had always shown a keen awareness of developments abroad, and inspired by the efforts of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Species Survival Commission, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estab lished a Committee on Rare and Endangered Wildlife Species in 1963. Within a decade, that committee's work had become the basis for the Endangered Species Act of 1973, one of the most powerful environmental laws ever enacted.4 A second (and much less prominent) tradition of concern developed around the fate of biological communities rather than individual species. As early as the mid-eighteenth century, the Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus published a lengthy essay, "The Oeconomy of Nature."5 There he argued that a wise, benef icent God had carefully crafted the natural world such that each species not only feeds on its own distinct prey but is also preyed on by other species, thereby existing in a functional relationship that ecologists would later characterize as a food chain. In the 1860s, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel coined the term ecology to describe the "science of the relations of organisms to the environment includ ing, in the broad sense, all the 'conditions of existence.'"6 By the early twentieth century, a diverse group of American biologists adopted the name "ecologists" and began fleshing out the connections between organisms inhabiting a partic ular location. They also campaigned to establish relatively undisturbed nature reserves to protect not just individual species but the full complement of plants and animals residing there, or what they called biological communities. Those study sites offered a critical baseline for exploring the normal functioning of what came to be known as ecosystems in the post-World War II period (see Sandlos and Wiersma's contribution to this forum). Although ecologists worried most about endangered communities, their arguments also loomed large in efforts to protect predators, which played a crucial role in maintaining the health of those communities. By the 1950s and 1960s, with the heightened publicity about the dangers of radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing and a related concern about the increasing use of potentially dangerous synthetic pesticides ignited by Rachel Carson's bestselling book, Silent Spring (1962), basic ecological ideas like food chains, trophic levels, and biomagnification-began diffusing into</page><page sequence="4">THE SPECTER OF EXTINCTION | 431 the broader culture. A desire to keep ecological relationships intact also pro vided one rationale for the Endangered Species Act of 1973.7 Yet ecological ideas ultimately provided little influence on the wording and implementation of that landmark act. Although the Endangered Species Act does require federal officials to designate critical habitat for listed organisms, its primary focus is on monitoring and protecting individual species, not intact ecosystems. Indeed, the act's name itself speaks volumes about its basic orientation. There are many reasons for this state of affairs. Although conservationists had long acknowledged the importance of protecting habitat (see Alagona's con tribution to this forum), they have devoted most of their attention to individual species, not biological communities or ecosystems. Put another way, until recently, habitat protection has been viewed more as a means to preserve declin ing forms of wildlife than an end in itself. At the same time, most Americans seem to more readily identify with individual species-which they often perceive in quite anthropomorphic terms-than they do with more abstract biological communities, which not only have much fuzzier boundaries but also few dis cernible humanlike characteristics.8 And with few exceptions, species seem rel atively easy to recognize and count. I would argue that the Endangered Species Act's focus on rescuing individ ual species-and in particular its goal of maintaining the full array of current organisms-is also a product of the old idea of plenitude, a throwback to a time when the natural world was seen as static rather than dynamic. Although we no longer try to shoehorn nature into a single linear progression of intergrading forms, we continue to strive to preserve nearly all the organisms that currently exist, something in the range of 10 to 100 million species. Moreover, we hope to achieve this goal with the full knowledge that more than 99 percent of all organisms that have ever existed are no longer with us.9 In suggesting that the idea of plenitude continues to color our thinking about extinction, my aim is not to criticize the Endangered Species Act. But the danger is that in focusing on rescuing individual species, we have lost sight of the pressing need to save the intact ecosystems on which those species rely, the very places where the dynamic evolutionary and ecological forces that produced (and continue to support) the earth's biodiversity might continue to play out. Since the 1980s, conservation biologists have begun out lining a new approach to conservation-ecosystem management-that they hope will maintain the integrity of biological communities. It remains to be seen, however, whether that approach will garner the political support necessary to implement it fully.10 Mark V.
