Though she may be star ai tied that I derive so much significance from it, I see in this phrase the acknowledged positionality and the courage that I consider fundamental to her scholarship and her personal interactions. With her use of the first person, she owns the subjectivity of her analyses even as she frames their limits and invites other people to join in the conversation. Once people take up that invitation, she listens. "Fair enough" is another phrase I associate with her, and in that I hear the down-to-earth good manners and open-mindedness of the American Midwest, Indiana rising up to greet India. "To My Mind" serves as the title of this volume partly because it echoes Joanna's voice and partly because it expresses the tone in which we offer these essays to her. We present them to entertain that sharp mind as well as to honor her scholarly career and thank her for all she has done to reshape the study of South and Southeast Asian art history. The contributors are some of the many distinguished scholars and students Joanna's work has enabled, nudged, inspired, provoked. All their essays here continue her project of pushing the limits of our field, challenging its comfortable assumptions and categories. These essays range through the broad swath her own work cuts across the history and geog raphy of southern Asia. These essays also meet her exacting standards for scholarship. Once I had gotten Joanna to consider a project like this - people who know her will guess she had little enthusiasm for so much attention being directed toward her - she agreed on condition that this volume feature only very strong and inter esting work. Little as she wanted homage paid to her, she was drawn to an opportunity to showcase the excellent research being done in our field. Each contribution to this volume does just that. People were quick, I suspect, to dedicate such strong work to this project because Joanna inspires through example. She is toughest on herself. When she punctuates a lecture with an immeasurable pause for the right word, it is worth the wait. A scholar and a traveler of incredible resilience, she lives what she teaches: "no whining." Hopping into a car for a fourteen-hour drive across Rajasthan, or cheerfully quaffing a glass of murky water given her by hosts in a Nathdwara village, she is all about relishing the adventure. Joanna is fearless and patient too when she assesses the work of her students and colleagues. Criticism is rarely fun to hear, but I find it easy to listen to hers because she gives it without animosity and often with humor. Joanna has a particular amused, gimlet eye she trains on pretense, exaggeration, sentimentality, and other forms of hogwash. She can also have mercy for the abject - students, for example, who have completely misunder stood the assignment (me). Visiting scholars and hungry graduate students often find tea or a meal at her orange and purple Berkeley home. She is the biggest tipper I have ever seen. Drivers, waiters, research assistants, even babysitters could receive a month's wages tacked on to a day's regular pay. This is all of a piece with her generosity as a scholar, as Catherine Becker remarks within. Joanna treats the world of scholarship as a community in conversation, not competition. This was the first lesson I saw her teach graduate students. Her instructions were unmistakable and public: share every refer 227</page><page sequence="3">enee, map, photograph, or scrap of information that a fellow student might find helpful. Collabora tion was not optional. Much as the high quality of submissions has made editing this volume a pleasure for me, writing these introductory remarks has been a daunting task, and not only because I imagine the gimlet eye. Finding words equal to the debt we bear her is very tough. My Malayali father told me that people in India say "thank you" seldom because mere words cannot discharge a significant debt. But words are what we do, and what Joanna has gotten all of us to do differently than we did before we knew her or read her work. So we thank Joanna Williams with twelve essays organized around two themes that run deep through her scholarship. The first explores links between contemporary art prac tice and older objects, a crossroads where art history meets ethnography and living artists illuminate art made long ago. Four authors chose to write on this theme : Frederick Asher, Catherine Asher, Kavita Singh, and Tryna Lyons. The other eight address the second theme of this volume: the insights and contradictions that sculptures and inscriptions can bring to each other. As the authors worked through this theme, it widened to embrace a range of verbal sources besides inscriptions - pur?nas, m?h?tmyas, Buddhist sutras, archaeologists' and travelers' accounts - in their interactions with visual materials. As the contributors confronted their evidence, these two themes further expanded along several other grooves that Joanna's work has carved out over the years, pathways that cut against previous assumptions shaping the landscape of South Asian art history. These pathways also cross-cut variously among the essays, pulling each author into several conversations and thereby forming a series of over lapping clusters. I will devote the remainder of my introductory remarks to sketching out those path ways and clusters. This will require me to skip back and forth among the contributions. All the essays rest heavily on what I consider Joanna's prime directive : to attend closely to the visual nature of the objects we study. Their physical surfaces hold the fundamental data for art historical analysis. Seeing is our particular job. Kavita Singh, for example, looks closely at the architecture of Delhi's new Akshardh?m temple complex and the juxtapositions in its gardens, using formal analy sis to reveal political meaning. Sujatha Meegama dissects decorative motifs on Sinhala temples (both devale and kovil) to find traces of the hands of separate artist workshops. When Natasha Reichle ana lyzes the Sanskrit inscriptions as well as the sculptures beside them at Borobudur, she finds that they were not meant to be read once the monument was completed, nor did the sculptors who were meant to read them during construction always follow the written instructions. Janice Leoshko regards the twin hills of Udayagiri and Khandagiri in Orissa, taking up Joanna's invitation to credit the early viewers and makers of Indie sculpture with intentionality and visual lit eracy. This approach leads Leoshko to find that sudden shifts in figurai scale could underscore vener ation and create visions of a wondrous divine world, visions intended perhaps as much for the gaze of the laity as for the Jain ascetics who lived among these carvings. She also finds visual strategies that reach beyond the simple reading of narrative and into the realm of metaphoric thinking. As Leoshko questions what acts of seeing might include, Juhyung Rhi wonders what an image might be and how multiply it might function. Ananda K. Coomaraswamy was thinking in such bold ways, Rhi argues, when challenging Alfred Foucher's claim that embodying the Buddha relied upon non-Indic para digms. Buddha figures from Mathur? and Gandh?ra may have been generated to serve completely sep arate devotional purposes. 228</page><page sequence="4">Jinah Kim's meticulous look at Angkor Wat in Cambodia shows her that some of the site's most famous reliefs were in fact not finished. She turns to Joanna's proposal that unfinished works may be more common than finished ones, and that in any case the unfinished state hardly prevented objects from being well used. At Angkor Wat, Kim argues, the unfinished state even provided later genera tions with welcome opportunities: a sixteenth-century king could articulate his links to the monu ment's twelfth-century patron by finishing surfaces left blank during the initial construction. Natasha Reichle's careful observations of the lowest level of Borobudur's st?pa-chandi turn to unfinished passages too. These serve her as opportunities to humanize the monument's artists and to dignify their work. The physical traces of their hands show Reichle artists working side by side but at different paces, expressing individual sculptural styles, proceeding from the top of the panel to the bottom or outlining entire silhouettes first - in short, artists free to approach their work from various angles instead of having standardization imposed upon them. All the essays in this volume, like Joanna's work, are ambitious and subtle at the same time. Even as they take visual surfaces as their primary evidence, they keep looking beyond first impressions for second, third, and more layers of possible meaning and connections to other sources of information. Devangana Desai, for example, holds up the iconography of K?rma (the tortoise) to many lights, twisting and turning until she sees many facets, replacing a simple, closed reading with an opened sense of the many associations his signs have carried. Thus she disaggregates K?rma from Visnu, the regal god whose iconography later enfolds K?rma as one of his avatars. K?rma's earlier associations with support, water, creation, longevity, and self-control do not mesh simply with Visnu's ; some align him with Siva and the Buddha instead. Catherine Becker just as vigorously unpacks and complicates another of Visnu's incarnations, Var?ha, in its theriomorphic and anthropomorphic forms. Combing through inscriptions, often read ing them against the grain, and setting them in dialog with close visual analysis of the famous sculp tures at E ran and Udayagiri, she teases apart the royal emblem of the man-boar from the all-boar, redo lent instead with connotations of sacrifice and family lineage. Could the all-boar, she asks, have sig nified through Sassanian visual codes, thus seeming to praise the H?na overlords but also undermining them by covertly praying to Visnu for deliverance from them? In her "ethno-art-history" of the Bengali goddess Jagaddh?tr?, Tryna Lyons structures her essay about storytelling as a series of stories itself. She displays an ethnographer's patience with multiplic ity too, mining rather than resisting the multiple variations on a story, the changing forms of icons, the conflicting explanations of iconographie forms, their different meanings for different audiences, to decipher a relatively new deity's role as the goddess of last resort, a last hope against the specific dis aster of a botched sacrifice and impending colonial subordination. Interviews inform Lyons as they do Singh. Attending to the voices of artists, priests, and others who use and protect Jagaddh?tr? and Akshard?m, these authors allow living people to animate our visions of these sacred objects. Following Joanna's insistent gaze beyond South Asia, Meegama, Reichle, Kim, Desai, and Cather ine Asher look to Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, tracing connections to South Asia in the precise and complex ways Joanna urged. They continue her work of displacing the proto-colonialism model that had colored earlier twentieth-century writing, a model that tacitly anointed South Asia as Europe's predecessor at crossing seas to subjugate and civilize alien lands. The authors in this volume trace sto 229</page><page sequence="5">ries, gods, saints, ritual practices, and architectural shapes back and forth across the Bay of Bengal. Everywhere they hit land, these vectors of mutual transformation encountered urgent local require ments and deeply rooted categories of analysis. What got transported also complicates assumptions about the places it left behind. Catherine Asher's ethnographic and visual strategies reveal a very Tamil organization of space and sensory engagement - phenomena one might otherwise call "Hindu" - in the Muslim dargahs of the saint Shahul Hamid Nagori that proliferated from Nagore in Tamil Nadu to Malaysia and Singapore. That proliferation challenges the singularity that elsewhere in Islam is the special province of the dargah (grave). Spanning the sea, Shahul Hamid's shrines evoke the saint's own travels across water and his special ability therefore to protect his faithful, the Tamil merchants who continued to ply these oceans. Eroding the hard edges that have seemed to encrust religious and ethnic identities has been another of Joanna's specialties. In that spirit, Kim reminds us that Angkor Wat, publicized in colonial and post-colonial imagery as the beacon of Khmer identity in all its "Hindu" glory, has in fact functioned as a Buddhist shrine for the last four centuries. Leoshko too wonders when religion is about ritual and when it is about culture, and she finds that the features shared by Jaina and Buddhist objects are at least as informative as those that distinguish them. Meegama reports that festivals and processions in Sri Lanka now work to fuse the concepts of Buddhist and Hindu, concepts that colonial and post-colo nial discourse had polarized and inscribed onto Sri Lankan versus Tamil ethnic identities. Joanna has been, above all, a historian. Engaging with the visual has been about connecting with the past. It is surely no accident that Berkeley's art history department changed its name - to the "HIS TORY of Art" department - while she was part of it. Several essays offer tribute to her deep engage ment with the slipperiness of time and the inevitability of change. Michael Meister layers up so many connections between the P?d?m?t? temple at Didwana, Rajasthan, and the Oevtm?h?tmya hymn that he describes each as a palimpsest: "both struggle to contain the expanding import of these stories" that the hymn narrates and that "clothed [the temple] in oceans of story. " The almost flammable den sity of these stacks signals for him a cultural ferment and a shifting religious landscape around the pro duction of temple and text. Time cannot be contained. Respectful of its irresistible force, Rhi embeds Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy in the world of colonialism and the struggle against it as he tracks the evolution of Coomaraswamy's thinking through the twenty years preceding the influential 1927 Art Bulletin article in which Coomaraswamy argued {contra Alfred Foucher) that Buddha images were more likely to have developed within South Asia than to have been catalyzed by Greco-Roman thinking. In Rhi's hands, we find a Coomaraswamy who was very much a man of his time, shaped by colonialism even as he fought against it, enamored of Blake, Ruskin, Morris, and Nietzsche even as he bridled at Foucher's arrogance and immersed himself in ancient Indie texts to bury Foucher's thesis. The past does not hold still either. It remains available for creative reuse. Singh and Frederick Asher observe this in operation at contemporary and ancient sacred places. Singh decodes at Akshardh?m a rewriting of India's past without Islam and with strong continuities to Harappa, which Akshardh?m casts as precocious in its technological advancements independent of "Western" influence. The mon ument rewrites the past to shape the present and future identity of India. Asher's essay uses the pres ent to pry us loose from certainties about the past. He demonstrates that the sites of the Buddha's life 230</page><page sequence="6">have been continually reshaped and rebuilt, their locations perhaps invented, despite their apparently simple promise to transport pilgrims into their teacher's long-ago presence. Combing through the Pali texts, Chinese pilgrim accounts, nineteenth-century archaeological reports, and contemporary records, which capture like snapshots four discrete moments in the lifetimes of these spots, Asher immerses us in their constant change. He embraces uncertainty and urges us to do the same. As Lyons learns from the worship of deliberately ephemeral clay figures in riparian Bengal, change is not the remarkable thing about this world. Consistency is. 231</page></plain_text>
