<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EVOLUTION OF THE RELIGION OF ISRAEL I. MOSES AND THE COVENANT WITH YAHWEH PROFESSOR GEORGE AARON BARTON Bryn Mawr College Religion may be viewed from either the human or the divine point of view. From the divine standpoint God reveals truth; from the human, man discovers it. Even a superficial study of the history of religion makes it clear that there has been in the course of the centuries an advance in the apprehension of truth and in the grasp of moral and religious ideals. Viewed from the divine side revelation has been progressive; looked at from the human, it has been evolutionary. He who speaks of the evolution of religion does not thereby deny the divine element, nor he who speaks of revelation, the human factor. If, then, in this -series of articles we seek to trace the evolution of the religion of Israel, we shall be but treating in the favorite phraseology of the time the progress of revelation in Israel. The results of a century and a half of scientifically historical study of the Old Testament literature has made it clear that from the human side there was an evolution in Israel's religion far more real than was formerly supposed. It has become evident to the majority of those who have examined the evidence, that, apart from a few poems, such as the song of Deborah in Judges, chap. 5, we have no Hebrew literature from a date earlier than the ninth century B.C. Broadly speaking, Hebrew literature begins with the prophetic documents of the Pentateuch and similarly early strata in the Books of Judges and Samuel. As these writings are prophetic in tone, and as the Book of Deuteronomy (which is prophetic in tone) is demonstrably from the seventh century, while the great body of Levitical laws and priestly narratives are generally recognized as from the fifth century B.C., it is now clear that broadly speaking the prophets were anterior to the law. Although there may be pre-exilic 17</page><page sequence="2">18 THE BIBLICAL WORLD psalms in the Psalter, the collection as a whole was the hymnbook of the second temple, and such pre-exilic material as was embodied in it was re-edited to suit the changed conditions and sentiments of the post-exilic time. The beautiful piety and spiritual aspira- tions of the noblest parts of the Psalter can, therefore, no longer be attributed to David. All this sets the development of Israel's religion in new perspective. This is not the place to dwell in detail upon these literary facts and problems, though in the discussion which follows they will be presupposed. The reader who is unfamiliar with them is referred to one of the several excellent "Introductions"' to the Old Testament. The demonstrated literary facts just alluded to render the investigation of the religious work of Moses exceedingly difficult. Most scholars now place Moses in the thirteenth century B.c., and if our earliest source was written in the ninth century, it is separated from Moses by a space of four hundred years-a period as long as that which separates Columbus or Luther from us. When one thinks of the unreliability of traditions concerning Columbus and Luther apart from written records of their time, the difficulty which confronts the historian of Moses may be vividly realized. Never- theless certain great facts stand out concerning him. Just as tradition affords true testimony to the fact of the great discovery of Columbus, and clearly outlines Luther as the doughty champion of the Reformation, so the Hebrew traditions which converge upon Moses convincingly mark him out as the great emancipator of his people, and as the Hebrew founder of the religion of Yahweh. While now and then an erratic scholar has doubted this, it is a point on which an overwhelming consensus of scholarly opinion unites.2 The insoluble problems concerning the details of the Egyptian slavery of Israel and the Exodus have in recent years been increased rather than diminished by archeological discovery, yet the fact that at least a part of the nation experienced such slavery, that ' Such as S.

Without them the later religious history would be inexplicable. While these fundamental facts stand out clearly through the haze of tradition, there is less certainty as to details. Naturally when the written records come from a period so much later, abso- lute historical certainty cannot be secured in dealing with details. We can discern certain outlines which are probably true, but in drawing these outlines it must ever be borne in mind that they are not historical certainties, but at the most, probable hypotheses. One such hypothesis, which has in the last thirty years won for itself a large acceptance among scholars, is that Yahweh was the deity of the Kenites, a part of whose habitat was Mount Sinai, that it was there that Moses learned of his worship, and that the covenant at Sinai was the introduction into Israel of the worship of a god who had previously been the tribal god of the Kenite- Midianites. The reasons for this view are in part: (i) That it was at Sinai that Moses first learned of the name of Yahweh-a name that was previously unknown to him (see Exod. 3: 2-14). In the ancient East the introduction of a new name meant the introduction of a new deity. (2) That after the exodus from Egypt and the arrival at Sinai it was Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, the priest of Midian, who offered to Yahweh the first sacrifice in which Hebrews parti- cipated. Moses, Aaron, and all the elders of Israel were present and participated in the sacrificial festival which followed (Exod. i8:i2). Apparently Jethro was initiating the Hebrews into the worship of the new deity. Then followed the covenant between Yahweh and Israel. This was sealed by a sacrificial feast without Jethro, at which were Moses, Aaron, and seventy elders of Israel (Exod. 24:9-11). These traditions, which come in part from the J document and in part from the E document, our oldest sources, embody apparently Israel's earliest recollection of these events, and indicate clearly that Yahweh was a tribal god of</page><page sequence="4">20 THE BIBLICAL WORLD the Kenite-Midianites before he became the covenant God of Israel.3 Is it possible to penetrate farther into the past and discern any- thing of the previous history of Yahweh ? Information which has come to light in recent years makes it probable that the name Yahweh was known in Babylonia about 2000 B.c., where it formed a part of certain proper names. This was seven hundred years or more before Moses. It appears there again in the fourteenth century B.c., and was also in the same century an element of a proper name in Palestine. These names come from the century before Moses. It also appears to form a part of the name of an Aramaean king of Hamath in the eighth century B.C.4 The Babylonians who bore these names were foreigners, having moved to that country from elsewhere, and analogy with other Semitic migrations would lead us to believe that they migrated from some part of north Arabia. The Kenite-Midianites had their habitat in that very region, roaming from the peninsula of Sinai on the west far into the heart of Arabia on the east.4 It accordingly seems probable that for hundreds of years the name Yahweh had been known here and that emigrants from this region had carried it into Babylonia and Palestine before the time of Moses. The Yahweh of this ancient time, as an Arabian tribal god, was believed to give the tribe its life and to do whatever a supernatural being could do for his people. Like other Semitic tribal deities he was believed especially to preside over the functions of life. He "opened the womb" (Gen. 29:31; 30:22; 49:25; Exod. 13:2; Ps. 127:3), or "shut up the womb" (I Sam. 1:5, 6). So sacred were the genitals to him that oaths by Yahweh were taken upon them (Gen. 24:2).s It was he who caused grass and trees to grow; 3 For fuller statements of this view see Budde, The Religion of Israel to the Exile, N.Y.: Putnam, 1899, chap. i; Barton, A Sketch of Semitic Origins, N.Y.: Macmillan, 1902, pp. 272 f., 275 f.; and Hastings, Dictionary of the Bible in One Volume, p. 410. 4 For further details see the writer's article "Yahweh before Moses" in the anni- versary volume in honor of Professor C. H. Toy, and the numerous references to other literature there given. s Probably the name Yahweh originated in the Arabic dialect spoken by these tribes, coming from the verb hawiya, "to love passionately," or "desire," meaning "He who causes to desire." (See the discussions by the present writer, cited above.) The writer of Exod. 3:14 naturally at a later time took it for a Hebrew word and explained it accordingly.</page><page sequence="5">THE EVOLUTION OF THE RELIGION OF ISRAEL 21 who caused volcanoes to upheave (Gen. 19:24; Exod. I9:I8); who manifested himself in cloud and thunder and lightning (Ps. 18:7 ff.; Judg. 5:4; Ezek. 1:4 ff.; Hab. 3:4 ff.; Job 38:I; I Sam. 7:Io; Job 37:4, 5). These were natural activities which every Semitic tribe that lived in a region of volcanoes and rain attributed to its deity. One other function apparently was attributed to Yahweh in these early days: he was thought to be a god of war. In ancient wars the gods of the contending tribes were thought to contend as really as their worshipers. The struggle was in the last analysis a supernatural one. Any victory achieved was the triumph of the deity of the victorious tribe. The Kenite- Midianites appear to have become a terror to the tribes about them, and to his other functions their god naturally added those of a god of battles. A later hymn in speaking of the Exodus declares: "Yahweh is a man of war" (Exod. 15:3), and one of his pre- eminent titles was "Lord of hosts" or "armies." Probably it was his reputation for giving victory that attracted the oppressed Hebrews to him, and when the promises that Moses made in his name had been fulfilled and they actually found themselves free from Egypt they entered into covenant with him, that he should be their God. There is no reason to believe that Yahweh in this early Kenite period differed materially from other Semitic gods. His worship was no more ethical than theirs. Down to a much later time he was worshiped in connection with pillars and Asherahs, which were in part sexual symbols, and it would be difficult in this early time to distinguish the ceremonial of his festivals from the festivals of those nomadic tribes who worshiped other gods, or whose deity was the great Semitic goddess.6 Like other Semitic and Egyptian gods of fertility he required circumcision of his worshipers, and also demanded animal sacrifice. In the thirteenth century B.c. the spiritual period of religious and ethical conception had not yet begun. We do not find it in any race until about the eighth century B.c. The religious life of early peoples was much like that of children, who experience the psychological emotions of religion with intensity, but whose inter- pretations are objective and anthropomorphic. If the traditions 6 See the writer's Sketch of Semitic Origins, 289 ff.</page><page sequence="6">22 THE BIBLICAL WORLD of Exod., chap. 3, may be taken as a guide, Moses in his experience of Yahweh at the burning bush gained a personal impression of the power and awe of Yahweh that possessed his whole being. He went to proclaim to his brethren, with an enthusiasm and unction born of the awe of Sinai, Yahweh as a deliverer. No doubt the personal conviction created by his own impressive experience was a dominant factor in enabling him to kindle in the minds of his kinsfolk a faith in the living might of Yahweh sufficient to produce action. Thus in the person of the great founder of Israel's religion there became effective, we cannot but believe, those forces which arise from a personal experience of God. They took the childlike form appropriate to an immature period of human development, but none the less did they mightily impress the soul with the majesty and awfulness of Yahweh and that terrible quality called holi- ness-a quality which at that period of religious thought was not yet ethical, but was conceived as a sort of divine electricity with which it was dangerous for one not initiated to tamper.7 In lesser degree the experience of Moses was probably shared by his followers. The awe and power were kept frequently before them in the storm and the lightning. The thunder with all its terrors was thought to be Yahweh's voice.8 Thus from the beginning there was impressed upon the adherents of the new religion that conception of Yahweh's awfulness and majesty, which at a later time was destined to reinforce in the Hebrew conscience high ethical ideals. In this covenant between Yahweh and Israel consummated at Sinai lay the possibilities of future ethical development. The fact that at a definite period of national life-a period ever well remem- bered-Yahweh had taken Israel for his people placed their mutual relations upon quite a different footing than the relations which existed between any other god and his worshipers. Semitic deities generally were believed to be bound to their worshipers by ties of kinship-ties that were thought to be indissoluble. A Semitic god of this sort was like an Arab sheik: he might not like what his tribesmen did; he might even sulk and leave them for a while to their fate; but in the end he was compelled to come to 7 See W. R. Smith, Religion of the Semites, 2d ed., 141 ff., 450 ff. 8 Cf. I Sam. 7: 10; Ps. 104: 7.</page><page sequence="7">THE EVOLUTION OF THE RELIGION OF ISRAEL 23 their rescue, for if he did not he would be cast out into the world alone. He would not only be a sheik no longer, but could not even keep alive. So a god who did not rescue his human kinsfolk, how- ever unethical their conduct, would no longer be a god. There was little possibility that such religion could ever become ethical. The covenant at Sinai placed the religion of the Hebrews upon an entirely different basis. Yahweh was related to his Hebrew worshipers, not by kinship, but by contract. If they did not fulfil their part of the contract, they could not expect him to fulfil his. He had chosen one people; he could cast them off and choose another. He was bound by no indissoluble ties; his fate was not inevitably linked with that of but one people. In this fact lay the possibilities of Israel's ethical and spiritual progress. Interpreting as the prophets of a later time did this covenant as of ethical and spiritual content, they differentiated the religion of Israel from the other religions of the world and made it the earliest beacon of humanity's highest destiny. The potentialities of this covenant for ethical and spiritual advance lay in part in the fact that at the moment it was not put in written form, but was committed to tradition. That it was not at once committed to writing is clear from the wide divergence of opinion in later times as to what the real content of the covenant was. The author of the J document held the basis of the covenant to be the ten ritualistic commands of Exod. 34: 14-28; the writer of the E document, the agricultural code of Exod. 20: 24-23: 19; the Deuteronomist, that expansion of E's code into which a new humanitarian tone and greater definiteness of ritual had been read, which we now find in Deut., chaps. 12-26; the priestly writer believed it to be the great body of ceremonial law which fills the last part of Exodus and all of Leviticus and Numbers; while to the great prophets Amos, Hosea, Micah, and Jeremiah the essence of this covenant did not lie in ceremony at all, but in thorough fidelity of heart to Yahweh exhibited in a life of ethical justice and purity among men. The covenant became of creative significance because it was sufficiently grand and awful to be inspiring, and sufficiently vague to bear reinterpretation and become a moving ideal-a flying goal.</page><page sequence="8">24 THE BIBLICAL WORLD Of the various "codes" referred to, that in Exod. 34: 14-28, often called by scholars the "Decalogue of J," is on many accounts probably more likely to represent with approximate fidelity the content of the covenant in the time of Moses than any of the others. This is probable (i) because it consists for the most part of simple ritualistic requirements appropriate to the habits and ideas of a nomadic people of that age and country; (2) because the other codes all contain agricultural provisions which presuppose a settled agricultural life and are inappropriate to the nomadic period at which the covenant originated; (3) because these require- ments were arranged in ten simple sentences which were easily carried in the memory and which could be checked off on the fingers; and (4) because these provisions are found in all the other codes, and are the only provisions which run through all four Pentateuchal documents.9 These ten requirements, when separated from their present literary setting, appear probably to have been as follows: i. Thou shalt worship no other god. 2. Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. 3. The feast of the Passover thou shalt keep. 4. The firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; all the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. 5. None shall appear before me empty. 6. Six days shalt thou work, but on the seventh thou shalt rest. 7. Thou shalt observe the feast of ingathering."o 8. Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread, neither shall the sacrifice of the Passover remain until the morning. 9. The firstlings of thy flocks" thou shalt bring unto Yahweh, thy God. io. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. 9 See for proof, Briggs, The Higher Criticism of the Hexateuch, 189-21o. to The command now reads (Exod. 34:22): "Thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, even the ingathering of the wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end." Two feasts, which occurred more than four months apart, are here merged into one command. Of these the first is purely agricultural. Even if we grant that some wheat may have been raised in the wilderness of Sinai, or in the region of Ain-Kadesh, this was only at the extreme western limit of the Kenite- Midianite habitat, and could hardly have been produced in the whole of it. The date harvest was an annual event of the whole region, and probably the "feast of ingathering," which afterward was made a commemoration of the grape gathering, referred in the nomadic period to the date gathering. See Sketch of Semitic Origins, pp. ii iff., and 115. ", It is supposed that "firstlings of thy flocks" in the nomadic days stood where "first of the first-fruits of thy ground" (Exod. 34: 26) now stands, because, as noted above, the harvests of grain then formed no important feature of the economic life.</page><page sequence="9">THE EVOLUTION OF THE RELIGION OF ISRAEL 25 It will be observed that these ten requirements are nearly all of a ritualistic nature. That is what should be expected from a nomadic people of this distant age. For a long time after this, religion consisted not of creeds but of rituals. The customs or mishpats of the deities must be observed; if one were faithful to these, no one asked what he believed. It goes far to establish the historical character of the J document's account of the covenant that these ten simple requirements so well accord with the nature of the religions of people similarly situated. They are easily remembered; they are ritualistic; they are fitted to a desert and nomadic environment. Nevertheless these requirements in one respect contained an unusual element--one in which was the seed of progress. Yahweh, the God of the thunderbolt and the burning mountain, was a jealous God. Less tolerant of rivals than other deities, he demanded that his worshipers worship him alone. This was not the general Semitic custom. Gods were generally regarded as the supernatural proprietors of certain districts, and when one was in the district belonging to a god it was both the polite and safe course to pay him homage, just as one would pay homage to an earthly potentate if one came within the range of his power by crossing his domain (cf. I Sam. 26:19). This custom was so deeply ingrained in the Semitic character that it was long before this first condition of the covenant of Sinai was observed by Hebrews generally, but it was ever present as a demand on the part of their God making toward monotheism. It was not a demand for monotheism; it distinctly recognized the reality of other gods; it was not even in theory monotheistic. It was but an expression of the jealousy of Yahweh which his worshipers naturally attributed to a god whose chief avenue of expression they believed to be the quaking mountain and the burning fire. Later, however, this command and this jealousy came as powerful aids to the prophets as they sought to impress upon the people the higher views of Yahweh and his will which had been born in their souls. Some scholars think it necessary to contend that the more ethical decalogue of Exod., chap. 20, and Deut., chap. 5, originated at Sinai. They feel that somehow the authority of the ethical</page><page sequence="10">26 THE BIBLICAL WORLD commands is less if they came from the prophetic period than if they came from Moses. This feeling the present writer does not share. Whenever the ethical decalogue was written, it has back of it all the authority of right. God has made the mind of man capable of perceiving the right, and when once it is perceived man has been given a conscience which, stirred by the Spirit of God, never lets him rest without living up to the right. There is no other alternative except to eradicate the conscience. When once the ethical decalogue was conceived to be a part of Yahweh's law of righteousness, it had back of it all that power. Had it originated in the time of Moses it could have been enforced by no greater authority. The question of the date of this decalogue may, then, be discussed dispassionately on the external evidence alone. Had it originated with Moses, it seems probable that all the documents would have contained it, as they do the ritualistic decalogue, whereas it was unknown to J, the oldest writer of all. This fact seems to the writer decisive, and this view is confirmed by the fact that the ethical decalogue finds a more appropriate environment in the ninth and eighth centuries than is afforded by the thirteenth century B.C. Such is the outline of the beginnings of the religion of Israel as we can now discern it. Beyond the fact that Yahweh became the God of Israel by covenant at Sinai through the instrumentality of Moses, this outline is confessedly hypothetical. Nevertheless the writer believes it approximately correct. Yahweh was a jealous God, a God of war, a God who could give to Israel just what she wanted-ability to gain freedom and to conquer enemies. If not appreciably higher than other Semitic religions of the time, it certainly was not lower, and the poverty of the steppe kept it relatively pure as compared with the cults of wealthy agricultural communities. It had, however, in it new possibilities, and it had come to Israel in a way that eventually afforded these possibilities the opportunity to be realized. From these simple beginnings the best religion of the world has sprung, illustrating the Master's word: "first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear."</page></plain_text>
