Scopus, Jerusalem 91905, Israel Ashkelon 78150, Israel davbenl87@yahoo.com mdpress52@gmail.com The article discusses terracotta figurines from Iron Age Philistia that are made in the form of Mycenaean figurines or illustrate Aegean iconographie elements. Together with new material published from Ashdod, previously unpublished examples from the new excavations at Tel Miqne-Ekron and Ashkelon call for a reexamination of the typology and function of this group of figurines. As these objects may reflect both cultic practices affiliated with the Aegean and specific religious elements unique for the Philistines, they are especially important; they also indicate if and in what manner certain iconographie elements in Philistia developed over the course of the Iron Age. Both previously pub lished and new data are discussed in terms of the typology, chronology, context, function, and significance of these artifacts in light of the contemporary Late Helladic IIIC and Late Cypriot III material culture. INTRODUCTION AND HISTORY OF RESEARCH Aegean-style terracotta figurines have been the focus of much research, and their im portance for understanding the religion and culture of the Philistines during the Iron I has been readily acknowledged. Early studies of figurines from Philistia reflecting Aegean influence were pub lished in the 1960s and early 1970s (T. Dothan 1967: 173-85; 1969; 1973). But much more attention to these figurines was drawn by the 1968 discovery (and subsequent publication) of the nearly complete seated figurine at Area H of Tel Ashdod (M. Dothan 1971: fig. 91:1; Hachlili 1971: 129), which was nick named "Ashdoda." T. Dothan addressed these figu rines under the rubric of "cult and cult objects" with a discussion of terracotta female figurines (1967: 173-85; 1982: 234-49), focusing mainly on a group of seated figurines (the "Ashdodas") and standing "mourning figurines" (T. Dothan 1969; 1973; 1982: 237-49). Brug, in his work on the Philistines, dis cussed such figurines under "religion" (Brug 1985: 182-88). A. Mazar dealt with various aspects of Phil istine iconography and cultic objects, in relation to the temple of Tell Qasile as well as other sites (Mazar 1980: 78-121; 2000: 223-25). While very few figu rines with identified Aegean elements were unearthed at Qasile, similarities were drawn between the female anthropomorphic vessel from the site and Myce naean female cult figures (Mazar 1980: 81; T. Dothan 1982: 251). Probably the most comprehensive work on the subject is by Schmitt (1999), who combined all types of Iron I Philistine terracotta figurines known at the time into a complete typology. Most types of female figurines discussed here were recog nized by Schmitt. Yasur-Landau discussed the seated Ashdoda figurines in the context of Aegean cult and summarized the data then available (Yasur-Landau 2001). Most of these studies did not properly recognize the range of Aegean-style figurines existing in Iron Age Philistia. In particular, largely due to the studies of T Dothan (1967; 1969; 1982), much attention was given to the so-called "mourning figurine" type; the only other major type recognized at all was the Ashdoda. This focus biased much of the subsequent research on this topic (see further discussion in Press 39</page><page sequence="2">BEN-SHLOMO AND PRESS BASOR 353 2007). Because of Dothan's emphasis, standing Ae gean-style figurines have been generally identified as mourning female figurines (e.g., Mazar 1986: 14, fig. 6:2; Schmitt 1999: nos. 9-10, 12, 18). We argue that the mourning figurines are in fact very rare, or even nonexistent, in the Philistine material culture, and in their place we introduce another major type, the Psi-type figurines. In addition, the current study benefits from the availability of a wider range of material. Earlier stud ies were based primarily on data published from the Ashdod excavations, along with some other scanty finds from the southern Levant. None of the prev ious works have taken into account the majority of examples found in recent excavations of Philistine sites: the Tel Miqne-Ekron excavations and the Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon.1 In addition, a rela tively large number of such figurines have recently been published from Area H at Ashdod (M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: 122). (The favissa near Tel Yavneh included several examples of Philistine-related iconography on terracottas dating to the Iron IIA/ early Iron IIB [Ziffer and Kletter 2007] as well.) The new finds from Tel Miqne-Ekron and Ash kelon and the recently published data from Ashdod more than double the assemblage of Aegean-style figurines and call for a reexamination of their typol ogy, chronology, and function. The new material presented here, much of it from well-stratified Iron I contexts, includes several new types. Moreover, the Philistine figurines in general have not yet been sys tematically compared with similar finds from the con temporary Late Helladic IIIC (henceforth, LH IIIC) Aegean and Late Cypriot III (henceforth, LC III) Cyprus; rather, they have generally been compared with the better-known, but less relevant Mycenaean LH HIB types (for chronology, see table 1). There fore, we aim to compile a new, updated, and compre hensive typology of these types of figurines, with an emphasis on defining and detecting their Aegean iconographie components, and comparing them, as much as possible, with contemporary Aegean and Cypriot figurines.2 Typology, then, is the main con cern of this article. As the stratigraphie analysis of both Ekron and Ashkelon is still in progress, the 1 For Tel Miqne-Ekron, see, e,g., Dothan and Gitin 1993; Gitin, Meehl, and Dothan 2006; for Ashkelon, see Stager, Schloen, and Master 2008: 213-323. 2 Note, however, that the discussion of Aegean and Cypriot figurines here is only in relation to similarities with types found in Philistia; a comprehensive evaluation of the LH IIIC and Late Cypriot Mycenaean figurines is beyond the scope of this article. context, chronology, and possible functions of these artifacts cannot be as systematically studied at this stage as their typology. Nevertheless, we offer here a preliminary discussion of these aspects, along with the significance of the iconographie components rep resented, some of which continue into the Iron Age II. We also argue that the female figurines in Iron Age Philistia, among other aspects of the material culture, reflect a process of "creolization" (Ben-Shlomo, Shai, and Maeir 2004: 20) or "cultural fusion" (Uziel 2007) of the Philistine society. DEFINING AEGEAN-STYLE AND PHILISTINE ICONOGRAPHY Before discussing the typology of the Aegean style figurines, it is important to define the icono graphie characteristics that identify these figurines as "Aegean-style," "Mycenaean-style," "Cypriot-style," or "Philistine."3 While these characteristics have been mentioned in the past in relation to various Myce naean female figurine types (T. Dothan 1982: 234; Schmitt 1999: 633-34; Yasur-Landau 2001: 332), we would define two main classes of figurines from this group. The first class consists of figurines from Phi listia appearing in a form largely identical to a known Aegean (or Cypriot) type, as illustrated both by the shape and posture of the figurine and by its decora tion. In this case a complete "type-concept" is simply copied into or inherited by the Philistine material culture. Examples of this phenomenon include the standing and seated female figurine types as well as the decorated bovine figurines. While different de grees of affinity to the Aegean prototypes appear in these figurines, in all cases their form can be traced back to the Aegean material culture: thus the seated figurines, which reflect further development from their Mycenaean antecedents than the other types, are still included in this group. These types are also clearly distinct from the figurines known from the LB II Canaanite tradition, which continues into the Iron Age. For the female figurines, basic differences be tween the Canaanite and Philistine types are found both in the technique and in the image that technique is used to convey: while most Canaanite female fig urines are plaques made in a mold, and are depicted naturalistically and completely nude, the Aegean-style 3 We use here "Aegean-style," as this is a more general term. Yet, as will be noted, we aim to discuss figurines with various elements that relate to Mycenaean figurine types, which may also appear outside the Aegean, as in Cyprus or the Levant.</page><page sequence="3">2009 A REEXAMINATION OF AEGEAN-STYLE FIGURINES 41 Table 1.

Yasur-Landau defined several Aegean icono graphie elements of the Ashdoda figurines (2001: 332), and following him we propose to elaborate on and extend such attributes to all types of Aegean-style figurines in the southern Levant. Such attributes are especially significant when they introduce elements previously unknown in the iconography of the south ern Levant. For the female figurines, one of the most important elements is the concave head, which prob ably depicts a polos (see M?ller 1915). The term polos is generally not well-defined in the literature: it may refer to any headdress worn especially by female deities (M?ller 1915) or to a particular type of headdress (see L. Holland 1929: 184). On the fig urines, it refers to a headdress with a concave top, which in some cases is so low that it appears to be merely a concave head. We generally use this term, however, as a mere morphological description of the top of the head.4 Other examples of more unusual headgear or headdress are also directly related to Aegean iconography. In addition, the painted designs on these figurines are closely paralleled on the Aegean prototypes, where they represent typical dress and jewelry. The painted decoration is also the main Aegean component of the zoomorphic figurines. It 4 Note, though, that Syrian Bronze Age female figurines also appear with a similar head shape (see, e.g., Badre 1980: pis. 13:58, 65:53). Possibly the origin of this shape comes from the east, yet its appearance in Philistia during the Iron I, in combination with the composition of certain postures and other iconographie details mentioned, should be seen as an Aegean characteristic. should be noted that tracing the style of these figu rines to specific sources in the Aegean (such as the Argolid, the Dodecanese, and Crete) or on Cyprus is problematic, as the published data for these areas during the LH IIIC are so far limited. The second class referred to above includes figu rines in which Aegean iconographie elements are em phasized to varying degrees; the actual form and/or decorative motifs of the figurines, however, are not simply copies of Aegean types, but reflect multiple stages of development from Aegean prototypes. These could also be defined as "hybrid" types. In this case only a selection of individual elements is associated with western traditions; nevertheless, these objects can still be defined as "Philistine" figurines. For in stance, facial attributes recalling Aegean figurines in their details seem characteristic of Philistine figurines throughout the Iron Age: these are applied pellet eyes, protruding nose, and lack of mouth or incised mouth (Ziffer and Kletter 2007: 17). Distinctive Phil istine body details include small applied pellet breasts, which differ from the Canaanite naturalistic rounded breasts on plaque and other female figurines (e.g., Pritchard 1943; Tadmor 1982); they also differ from the depiction on Cypriot LC II?III female figurines (e.g., Morris 1985: 166-70; Karageorghis 1993: 3 10, pis. 1-6). The Iron IIA Ashdod Musicians' Stand (M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: 180-84) and sev eral Iron II figurines from Ashdod (see below), as well as figurines depicted on the models from the Yavneh favissa (Ziffer and Kletter 2007: 17, 24-25), all dis play these elements of Philistine iconography. By the Iron IIB-C, only certain relics of an Aegeanrstyle iconography can be traced in the figurines, becoming</page><page sequence="4">BEN-SHLOMO AND PRESS BASOR 353 a mere echo of Bronze Age Aegean types. This trend is displayed, for example, on throne models or Late Ashdoda figurines (see below).5 TYPOLOGY OF AEGEAN-STYLE FIGURINES FROM PHILISTIA Apart from Schmitt's work (1999), which included only the material published through the 1990s, no at tempt to create a comprehensive typology of Aegean style Philistine figurines has been made. Thus, with the new data from Ashdod, Ashkelon, and Ekron, compiling a new typology is essential. While we are aware that such an endeavor is somewhat problem atic, as most of the figurines are fragmentary, we aim to reconstruct the most complete typology possible according to the evidence at hand. The Aegean-style figurines from Philistia are all handmade and can be divided in two main groups: female anthropomorphic figurines and zoomorphic figurines. Of the female fig urines, the main distinct groups are the standing Psi type figurines and the seated "Ashdoda" figurines. Head fragments of figurines that may belong to either of these groups or to other unknown types will be discussed separately. Miniature examples also appear, as well as a few possible examples of other types such as the mourning female figurines. The Psi-type (and possibly Tau-type) figurines are more closely related to Aegean iconography (Furumark 1941: 86 89; French 1971: 102-48) and will be discussed first. Standing Female Figurines with Upraised Arms, Psi-Type Figurines (Figs. 1-4) This group depicts a schematic standing female figure with its hands uplifted. This type of figurine has only been recognized relatively recently by re searchers (Schmitt 1999: 594-99, Type I; M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: 122)6 and will therefore be described in relative detail, through the examples from 5 Note that figurines of other forms (non-Aegean-style) that appear with general Philistine Monochrome or Bichrome decora tion are not included in our typology. 6 It should be noted that Trude Dothan, in her Hebrew version of The Philistines and Their Material Culture (1967: 181-84), observed that Philistine female figurines (including "figurines of mourning women") belong to Furumark's Psi 2 type. (Note that Furumark [1941], and later French [1971], did not separate the mourning figurines as an independent type.) However, in the English version of The Philistines and Their Material Culture, Dothan, elaborating on her earlier discussion of this type, referred to them simply as "mourning figurines." Tel Ashdod (at least seven examples), Tel Miqne Ekron (at least two examples), and Ashkelon (at least five examples) (figs. 1-4; see also table 2).7 As we demonstrate, the Philistine Aegean-style Psi-type figurines have several attributes linking them to the 12th-century Late Mycenaean Psi figurines (e.g., Furumark 1941: 86; French 1971: 133-39, pi. 22, Late Psi type) rather than to the 13th-century LH HIB Psi figurines. Unfortunately, no complete example of this figu rine has yet been found, and most examples are body fragments. Nevertheless, several large fragments as well as Mycenaean parallels enable us to reconstruct the shape of this figurine (e.g., figs. 1:1, 9; 2; 4). The head is relatively narrow, not wider than the neck, with a flat top. While there is no distinct example with a concave polos, we believe it is possible (if not likely) that some of the polos heads also belong to this type.8 The details of the schematic face include eyes formed from applied pellets (or pierced on the sides of the nose; see figs. 1:9; 4), small pinched nose, and sometimes incised or indented mouth (figs. 1:1, 5; 2). The body has an oval section, relatively thin (fig. 1:3-4), and has two uplifted arms, which are usually small; the complete figurine would have been approximately 10 cm high (see figs. 1:9; 4). The lower body of an example from Ekron (fig. 1:2) is thickened, possibly indicating a pillar base (for Aegean paral lels, see French 1971: 126). The schematic breasts are two small pellets applied to the body (fig. 1:1-6, 9-10). In certain cases perforations in the center of the breasts probably depict the nipples (figs. 1:4, 9; 4). The use of applied breasts is also typical of Late Psi Aegean figurines appearing during the LH IIIC (French 1971: 133), in contrast to the LH HIB Psi fig urines where the breasts are pinched from the torso. The decoration, when preserved, probably depicts the clothing (on at least some of the examples); it is monochrome, sometimes on white wash or slip. One example from Ekron (figs. 1:2; 3) depicts crossed X-shaped straps on the back of the figurine, with 7 Another example is a surface find from Tell Qasile (Mazar 1986: 14, fig. 6:2, pi. 3b). 8 Most Mycenaean LH HIB Psi figurines have pinched birdlike heads with a widening top depicting the polos ("high polos"), which is densely decorated (e.g., French 1971: 133-35, pis. 19:b c; 21:c-d). The LH IIIC Late Psi figurines often have either a low polos ("slight polos," as French terms it) or none at all (see French 1971: 135-39, e.g., pi. 22a:24). This is one of the many respects in which the Philistine figurines show the same elements that are newly developing on LH IIIC figurines.</page><page sequence="5">2009 A REEXAMINATION OF AEGEAN-STYLE FIGURINES Fig. 1.

This pat tern likely depicts a distinct type of ceremonial dress and appears on Aegean (e.g., Phylakopi: French 1985: fig. 6.2:1521, 2007; Lefkandi: French 2006: pi. 73:21) and Cypriot (Enkomi: e.g., Courtois 1971: figs. 149:687-88,151:657) Psi-type figurines. A simi lar pattern probably appears on an example from Ashkelon (fig. 1:3), while other examples from Ash kelon have horizontal stripes on the neck and body and sometimes even on the face (fig. 1:4, 9), possibly a more schematic representation of the same motif.</page><page sequence="7">2009 A REEXAMINATION OF AEGEAN-STYLE FIGURINES 45 Fig. 4. Psi-type(?) figurine from Ashkelon (fig. 1:9; MC 55679; height 8.6 cm). Similar dress straps on the back are depicted on a head from Ashdod (see fig. 10:1). A hatched pattern appears on a fragmentary example found in the top soil at Ashdod Area M (fig. 1:6); parallels for this decoration come from Marmaria at Delphi (Deman gel 1926: fig. 22:3-6). Horizontal bands on the neck also appear (figs. 1:9; 10:2-3). These depictions are paralleled by LH IIIC Psi figurines at Asine (Fr?din and Persson 1938: 308, fig. 212), the Marmaria at Delphi (Demangel 1926: figs. 23:1; 24:6), and Tiryns (Kilian 1979: fig. 15:center left). Some of the ex amples were probably not decorated, as also paral leled on the LH IIIC Late Psi examples (e.g., French 1971: pi. 22a:26). Examples with a triangular-shaped body, nar rower in the lower part (such as fig. 1:8), or rectan gular body (fig. 1:7,9 10) also occur. This body shape, sometimes even more pronounced, is also found on Late Psi examples (e.g., at the Marmaria: Demangel 1926: figs. 16d, 28:1-2; and a larger figurine [height ca. 19 cm] from Ialysos T40/2: Maiuri 1923-1924: 195-96, pi. 4; Benzi 1992: pi. 72b, which also has elaborate painted decoration, including several rings 9 Based on the drawing, this is probably Schmitt 1999: no. 12, although the IAA No. differs. around the neck and circles around the breasts).10 Several body fragments have their hands stretched to the sides (Ashkelon MC 45737; M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: fig. 3.62:2). These figurines are also undecorated or schematically decorated and may vary in their lower parts. This variant also has parallels in the Mycenaean Late Psi D Group (French 1971: 133, 139, pi. 20d). In cases where the lower part of the body is wider and curved inward (fig. 1:7, 9-10; M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: fig. 3.115:5), the figurine may have been attached to a rim (of a krater?). At least one of the examples from Ekron (fig. 1:1) and two examples from Ashkelon (fig. 1:3-4) are made of well-levigated light-colored calcareous clay, similar to the fine Monochrome ("Mycenaean IIIC:r'/"Philistine 1") pottery (Ben-Shlomo 2006a: 24; T. Dothan, Gitin, and Zukerman 2006: 72). Other fragments are made of the more usual reddish brown clay with gray core and quartz and limestone inclu sions.

The Psi-type figurines appear together with Phil istine Monochrome and Bichrome pottery in Iron I strata of the Philistine cities (Ashdod Strata XII-XI, Ekron Strata VI-V); Iron II examples at Ashdod are probably residual (fig. 1:6, 8). They have not yet been found, however, bearing the characteristic Phil istine Bichrome decoration. On the other hand, ex amples with red slip come from Ashdod Area D (fig. 1:11; Hachlili 1971: 131, with no breasts) and from Tell Qasile (Mazar 1986: 14, fig. 6:2, pi. 3:2, appear ing according to the illustrations to be red-slipped in the front, and also depicting a possible necklace). Therefore, although no Psi-type figurines have yet been found in the earliest Iron Age I horizon in Phi listia (Ashdod Stratum XIII, Ashkelon Phase 20, and Ekron Stratum VII; see table 1), we believe that these figurines do indeed represent the earliest stage in the Philistine material culture. As Psi-type figu rines are generally rare and the exposure of earliest Iron I strata in these sites is more limited, this ab sence could be incidental. Moreover, the fact that a few figurines of this type have not only monochrome decoration but a clay recipe identical to that of the "fine Philistine Monochrome" pottery suggests that these specific examples may have been made in the earliest stage of Philistine settlement. The Psi figurine is seen by French as evolving from the Phi figurines, which had a floruit during the LH IIIA (1971: 128). By the LH HIB, the Psi type, with both hollow-stemmed and columnar base, be came more prominent; during the LH IIIC this was probably the most common Mycenaean figurine. The decorative design varies: during the LH HIB, the ver tical stripes on the upper part of the body are very common (French 1971: 127-28), whereas during the LH IIIC, the decoration is more schematic, though the pattern of horizontal bands, probably depicting the dress and jewelry, appears as well (French 1971: 133? 34, pi. 20:d; see also Kilian 1979: figs. 13-15; French 2006: 262, pi. 73:23). In most cases the LH IIIC type has small applied pellet breasts. Standing female figurines with upraised arms also appear at several sites in LC III Cyprus, most notably Enkomi and Kition (see Karageorghis 1977-1978). These usually seem to be less similar in their shape and decoration to Mycenaean figurines, however, than the Philistine examples. Especially noteworthy is the large concentration of such figurines in the courtyard west of the Sanctuary of the Ingot God at Enkomi, dat ing to Cypro-Geometric (CG) I (Karageorghis 1993: 58) or somewhat earlier (the LC IIIC, Courtois 1971: 326-43, figs. 141-54; Webb 1999: 213-15). While most figurines have a vertical disk-shaped, flattened head, a local Cypriot component,11 others are some what similar to those from Philistia, including in the details of decoration (e.g., Courtois 1971: figs. 141:10-11; 142:13-14; 149:687-88; 151:657, 684; 152:637, 639). Some Psi-type figurines may have been attached to vessel rims (Courtois 1971: figs. 153:655, 636; 154:685; also Karageorghis 1993: pi. 17:1-3, from Alambra(?), Alaas, and Hala Sultan Tekke). Another possible example from LC III Cy prus is from Maa-Palaeokastro (Karageorghis and Demas 1988: pi. 221:19). While this type continues into the Geometric period in Cyprus (Morris 1985: 174-77; Karageorghis 1993: 82-85, pis. 36-37), 11 This head shape, probably depicting a special hat or head dress, is typical of Cypriot iconography, particularly on late Geo metric female figurines, and appears to indicate Cretan influence (e.g., Karageorghis 1993: 58-62, 82-85).</page><page sequence="10">BEN-SHLOMO AND PRESS BASOR 353 with new elements reflecting Cretan influence, its early appearance is probably an independent phe nomenon related to LH IIIC Early figurines from the Aegean. In summary, it is clear now that the Psi-type fig urine is a major early Philistine figurine type. It is strongly linked with Aegean prototypes and illus trates variants that are typical of the Mycenaean Late Psi of the LH IIIC. These include characteristics such as the low polos, applied breasts, irregular decora tion or lack of decoration, and variable body shape. Thus, this figurine type indicates links between the material cultures of the Aegean and Philistia during the 12th century b.c.e., rather than an "archaizing" tradition copying the obsolete 13th-century LH HIB figurines. Possible Tau-Type Figurines Tau figurines are well known from the LH IIIB-C Aegean (French 1971: 124-26): they depict females holding or covering their breasts with the hands. A figurine from Ashkelon (fig. 1:9) may be a Tau-type figurine (although, as noted above, it could also be a variation of the Psi-type). In this case the arms, bro ken at the shoulders, would have continued with forearms as separate pieces of clay bent back over the breasts; the breaks on the breasts would then have resulted from the arms breaking off. Another frag mentary figurine from Ashkelon (fig. 8:4) may be related to a Tau-type figurine. The flat body, with its wide upper torso, and the applied pellet breasts are possibly similar to the Psi-type; the (broken) arms, however, are not uplifted but pointing downward. The red decoration consists of a band around the neck and partial bands around the shoulders and breasts, depicting some kind of dress (exposing the breasts?) or emphasizing the breasts(?) (similar depictions are seen on some Ashdoda figurines [fig. 5:1, 5] and on figures from Tiryns, e.g., Kilian 1978: figs. 20-21). This could be a type of hybrid figurine, a combina tion of Aegean style/technique and local Canaanite form/gesture (along with, for example, an Ashdoda figurine from Ashkelon with hand possibly cupping the breast; see below). Note also that the breasts are more emphasized than on the typical Philistine Psi type (or Mycenaean Psi) figurines. Standing Female "Mourning" Figurine The type defined as the "mourning" female figu rine has received a relatively large amount of research attention, especially from T. Dothan (1969; 1973; 1982: 237-49; see also Schmitt 1999: 600-607, Type II; Mazar 2000: 223). These are female figu rines with their hands placed on top of their heads, in a gesture of mourning. Several possible examples have a narrow, pointed lower part; possibly they were placed into some sort of a socket or were attached to rims of open vessels. In fact, as noted above, there is very little direct evidence for this type at Philistine sites, and many of the Philistine figurines referred to as "mourning figurines" in various studies are in fact Psi-type figurines. Dothan presents unprovenanced examples from Tell cEitun and Azor (T. Dothan 1969; 1973), along with one example from Tell Jemmeh (fig. 5:7, the only example from an excavation), and relates these to mourning figurines from the LH IIIC cemeteries of Perati in Attica (Iakovidis 1966; 1969-1970: pis. 51:68-71; 177-78, Tomb 65) and Ialysos on Rhodes (Maiuri 1923-1924: fig. 101). There, kalathoi ap peared with the figurines modeled directly onto the rim, or else with perforations on the rim, for the fig urines to be attached by the means of a dowel or peg (see Iakovidis 1966). In general, however, this type is rare in the Aegean.12 It should be noted that the figurines from cEitun are very different in their style from Mycenaean figurines and from any other type of Philistine figurine. While the small preserved rim resembles Philistine krater rims, these vessels may not date to the Iron I (note that these fragments are not from an excavation context). All of this in dicates that the figurines described by T. Dothan, especially those from cEitun, cannot be relied on as examples for Philistine Aegean-style figurines. One example from Ashkelon (fig. 8:5) possibly belongs to this type. It has a birdlike head with a con cave top and remnants of an application on the top that might represent a hand on the head. One example from Ekron (fig. 8:6) has a narrow "peg-shaped" body and uplifted arms; the head was not preserved, and, as there are no breasts depicted and the bottom is very pointed (as on the Tell Jemmeh example, fig. 8:7; Petrie 1928:17, pi. 36:2; T. Dothan 1982: 237, fig. 12:1), this could be either a mourning figurine or another type of standing figurine. A complete female figurine from Iron I Tel Gerisa (Herzog 1984: 56, pl. 7:E) has a similar shape, but the hands are posi tioned below the breasts. We have not identified most 12 There are also possible male mourning figurines, in the Sub Minoan period, from Vrokastro, Crete (Hayden 1991: 130, 134, no. 36).</page><page sequence="11">2009 A REEXAMINATI?N OF AEGEAN-STYLE FIGURINES 49 standing female figurine fragments as mourning fig urines, as most heads do not show attached hands, and, as noted, there is no clear example of this type from Philistia. Generally we consider these frag ments to be Psi-type figurines.13 Seated Female Figurines, the "Ashdoda" Type (Figs. 5-7, 8:1-3) The other major Aegean-style figurine type in Phi listia, and certainly the best known, depicts a seated woman, but with the body of the woman and the chair fused. It was first identified at Ashdod?where the only nearly complete example was found in Area H Stratum XI (fig. 5:1; Hachlili 1971: 129)?and was therefore nicknamed "Ashdoda" (fig. 5; table 2). It is this Philistine type that has drawn the major ity of scholarly attention to date (e.g., T. Dothan 1982: 234-37; Schmitt 1999: 608-16, type III; Yasur Landau 2001).14 Altogether, at least 37 examples come from Ashdod (including 11-14 late examples from Iron II), at least 6 from Ekron, 14-16 from Ash kelon, and 1 from Tell es-Safi/Gath (Schmitt 1999: 611, no. 64); up to 10 additional examples appear at other sites (see below). While this type deviates from Mycenaean seated female figurine prototypes (French 1971: 167-72; T. Dothan 1982: 234), we include it in the "Aegean-style" figurine group as these figurines share a cluster of Mycenaean icono graphie components, as illustrated below. Based on the nearly complete example from Ash dod (fig. 5:1), which stands 17 cm high, we can recon struct the basic features of this type. The figurine represents a seated female: there is a small schematic head with a low, flaring polos, a long neck, a vertical 13 Open vessels with figurines attached to their rim and related to burials may be considered an Aegean characteristic. While Psi figurines appear to have been rarely attached to vessel rims, Tau figurines have been found attached to rims (e.g., Hala Sultan Tekke: Karageorghis 1993: pi. 18.2). This is reasonable, as beat ing or tearing the breast is another mourning gesture, along with tearing the hair and beating the head, as shown in later Greek literature. For discussion of these literary references, and their relationship to the figurines (as well as to painted Greek represen tations of mourning), see, e.g., Ahlberg-Cornell 1971: esp. 264 65; Mylonas 1963: 476; Immerwahr 1995: 110. Thus, it seems that all of the figurines attached to kalathoi display some mourning gestures. 14 The lower part of a figurine(?) from Ashdod Stratum XII (M. Dothan and Porath 1993: fig. 35:10) is defined by Schmitt as "proto Ashdoda" (Schmitt 1999: 608, no. 20, "type 0"); as the character of this object is not clear and other parallels do not exist, we refrain from treating this as a separate type. flat body with applied breasts, and a seat with four legs. The details of the face include two applied pel let eyes, sometimes on the nose itself (figs. 5:3; 6), and an applied nose, relatively prominent when pre served (e.g., fig. 5:2-3). Some head fragments also have applied ears (fig. 5:3; M. Dothan and Porath 1993: figs. 44:11; 46:9; Ashkelon MC 50562). In general, heads with long, thick necks are typical of the Ashdoda figurines (e.g., fig. 5:3, M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: fig. 3.80:2). Some figurines with short necks, however, also appear to be examples of Ashdodas (e.g., Ashkelon MC 50766; M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: fig. 3.80:1). The top of the head can be concave (more faithful to the polos depiction; fig. 5:1), flat (fig. 5:3), or convex (fig. 5:2). The breasts are usually very small; in several cases (e.g., fig. 5:5; Ashkelon MC 46097) they are very close together. Other examples, which are usu ally undecorated, have no breasts (such as fig. 5:6; M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: fig. 3.62:4). In several cases the figurines have pointed shoulders (fig. 5:6; M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: figs. 3.62:4; 103:2; 115:4). This feature could derive from the intersection of the chair's pointed upper part, as on LH III examples (as Mylonas 1956: pis. 14:6; 15:6). Alternatively, it is possible that this feature is a remnant from the earlier Psi-type figurines' ges ture of uplifted hands. The shape of the seat is either rectangular (fig. 5:1) or square (fig. 5:7). We have classified seat fragments as Ashdoda figurines (figs. 5:7-8; 8:1) when they show remains of a wide, rela tively flat body and/or neck, hands, or decoration typi cal of these figurines (examples without these features could also belong to bed models or "offering tables"; see Hachlili 1971: 129-30). Larger examples of Ash doda figurines also occur, as indicated by the large leg of a seated figurine found in Ekron Stratum IV, with bichrome decoration (fig. 5:8), and possibly by large heads from Ekron and Ashkelon (figs. 5:2; 10:5). It is possible that the Ashdoda figurines were typically larger than other female figurines, speci fically the Psi-type; the nearly complete example, however, is relatively small. In general, the Ashdoda figurines are either un decorated (except for white slip) or decorated in the Philistine Bichrome style, with red and black deco ration over chalky white slip. The decorative motifs are often related to Aegean depictions on female figures and figurines. The decoration of the complete figurine from Ashdod (fig. 5:1) includes a typical Mycenaean triangular pendant (Yasur-Landau 2001: 332). The neck is decorated with red, black, and</page><page sequence="12">BEN-SHLOMO AND PRESS BASOR 353 Fig. 5. Seated female figurines ("Ashdodas") from Ashdod, Ashkelon and Ekron.

Dothan and Ben Shlomo 2005:186, fig. 3.80:2). The body is deco rated with vertical red triangles and stripes, a more "Philistine" motif (e.g., T. Dothan 1982: figs. 34:4 5; 46:2), and the decoration continues on the rear. Other examples of body fragments from Ashkelon (fig. 5:4-5) show also remains of a dress depicted by an X between the breasts, circles around them, and a series of red horizontal bands below (fig. 5:5; see parallels from Asine: Fr?din and Persson 1938: 308, fig. 212: left; and from Tiryns: Kilian 1979: fig. 15: top right).15 One of these (figs. 5:4; 7) is also faintly decorated with two horizontal bands on the upper chest and a vertical curly line descending from the right breast. These examples are more schematic and are not decorated on the back. Stripes continue in red</page><page sequence="14">52 BEN-SHLOMO AND PRESS BASOR 353 Fig. 8. Aegean-style seated and standing female figurines. See table 2 for descriptions. and black on the seat and legs, as also seen in two examples from Ekron (fig. 5:7-8). The stripes on the seat and legs may be either a depiction of the continuation of the dress or a more abstract type of 15 It should be noted that the crossed straps or X on the front of female figurines is also a common motif in Bronze Age Syria, but there it is made by incised or plastic decoration (see, e.g., ex amples from Hama: Badre 1980: pi. 3:67-68, 70). As this motif appears on Philistine figurine types, we believe the more immedi ate connection is with the Aegean examples. decoration. Notably, there have been no examples yet found of Ashdoda figurines decorated in red slip. A variation of the seated female figurine found in Tell Qasile Stratum X (fig. 8:2) is a fragment with an arm depicted across the torso; Mazar (1986: 13) suggested that it was cradling a child. (This type is labeled kourotrophos in the Aegean and appears mostly before LH IIIC; see Furumark 1941: 87; Mylonas 1956; French 1971: 142-44.) A figurine from Ashkelon (fig. 8:3) also appears to have an arm on the torso, but with the hand possibly cupping the breast. Based on the shape of the body fragments, it</page><page sequence="15">A REEXAMINATION OF AEGEAN-STYLE FIGURINES IronIA Iron IB(1) Psi-type Ashdoda Late Ashdoda Heads Other female Bovine Fig. 9. Aegean-style figurine types in Philistia according to Iron Age horizons (see table 1). is very likely that these examples are simply variants of the Ashdoda type. A later development of the Ashdoda can be defined as a "Late Ashdoda type." It appears in Iron II con texts at Ashdod (see fig. 9) and is cruder and lacks decoration except for white slip (fig. 8:1; M. Dothan 1971: fig. 63). Several examples depict hands resting on the sides of the seat (M. Dothan and Freedman 1967: fig. 46:6-7; M. Dothan 1971: fig. 63:3). One Iron IIB-C figurine from Ashdod Stratum VII has incised fingers applied to the sides of the seat and an unidentified protrusion applied in the center of the seat (fig. 8:1). It is possible that during the Iron II the Ashdoda type merged with the Canaanite tradi tional clay bed models or "offering tables," which are found both before and after the Iron I in the southern Levant (see T. Holland 1977: 154; Brug 1985: 186). In the late variant, the body becomes very short, pos sibly without a head (as Yasur-Landau noted, 2001: 337, n. 61; see also Schmitt 1999: 611). The clay of the Ashdoda figurines does not differ from the clay used for Philistine Bichrome or other Iron I pottery: it is reddish brown with a gray core and quartz and limestone inclusions. This is in con trast to the Psi-type figurines, some of which are made of the fine calcareous clay typical of fine Monochrome pottery. Ashdoda figurines do not seem to occur in the ear liest stage of the Philistine occupation (the horizon of Ashdod XIII, Tel Miqne-Ekron VII, and Ashkelon Grid 38 Phase 20) (see table 1). The earliest clear appearance is Ashdod Stratum XII or XI, Stratum V at Ekron, and in Phase 18 at Ashkelon Grid 38 (see fig. 9). Thus, they do not appear in the earliest (Monochrome) stage, but rather only with Philistine Bichrome (and perhaps only in its advanced stage), continuing subsequently (at least at Ashdod) through the Late Philistine stage and into the Iron IIA-IIB-C period, though in a somewhat different form. The new data here nearly doubles the number of examples known and shows a greater variability of this type. The distribution of this type is also much wider, in cluding examples from Tell Qasile (Mazar 1986: fig. 6:1), Tell es-Safi (Schmitt 1999: 611, no. 64), Gezer (Dever, Lance, and Wright 1970: pi. 36:3, from a late context; and Dever 1986: pi. 62:18), Tel Batash (Mazar 2006: 253, photo 107, pi. 82:15; an "Ashdoda" head, Stratum V-IV fill), Tell Hamid (Wolff 1998: 782, fig. 18), Aphek (Beck and Kochavi 1993: 68; Yasur-Landau 2002: 413; Gadot 2006: 31), Beth Shemesh (Grant 1934: pi. 23: lower left), and possi bly Tell Judeideh (Schmitt 1999: 611, no. 65); there is also a likely example from Jerusalem (Gilbert Peretz 1996: 39, type El, fig. 18:11, pi. 9:8-9).</page><page sequence="16">BEN-SHLOMO AND PRESS BASOR 353 Parallels for this seated female figurine come mostly from the 13th century b.c.e. or earlier and have been found on Cyprus in Base Ring Ware (e.g., T. Dothan 1982: 234, pi. 22; Begg 1991: 63, type II.4; Karageorghis 1993: 13-14, pi. 10) and among Mycenaean figurines (see, e.g., Mylonas 1956; French 1971: 167-72, fig. 14; T. Dothan 1982: 234, pis. 20 21; Weber-Hiden 1990: pis. 49-50), showing seated females with their body attached to or combined with the chair (e.g., Nilsson 1968: 305, fig. 149). The Philistine seated figurines, the Ashdoda type, appear somewhat later and are differently and more sche matically designed. The Aegean examples have three legs and the seat is quite rounded,16 as opposed to the four-legged square/rectangular Philistine seat. Moreover, in the Aegean the figure is usually made separately and attached to the seat at a single point; decorated empty seats are common in the Aegean LH IIIB-C as well (French 1971: 172-74). It seems quite possible that the shape of the Ashdoda seat was more influenced by the Canaanite tradition of clay bed models/offering tables, and combined with an Aegean general concept.17 Nevertheless, we see this type of figurine as part of the Aegean-style corpus, due to the basic morphological similarities with the Mycenaean seated figurines. Such seated figurines are unknown in the Canaanite tradition and are strongly linked to Aegean iconography and cultic symbolism (Rehak 1995; see below). Moreover, additional Myce naean-style iconographie details appear both in the shaping and the decoration of these figurines. Thus, the Ashdoda figurine may reflect a blend of an Aegean form and concepts with some influences of local Canaanite traditions, resulting in a characteristically "Philistine" end product. Figurine Head Fragments (Figs. 10-13) Based on certain characteristics (head size, neck length, and especially neck diameter), we believe it 16 The three legs could represent a special type of stool, possibly used as a goddess throne or altar model (Mylonas 1956: 118-19). 17 As noted, in Cyprus seated figurines also appear and were suggested to be the main prototype for the Ashdoda figurines (Sherratt 1998: 302). It should be noted, however, that the Cypriot figurines have the facial and body details characteristic for Late Cypriot female figurines (such as wide head, incised mouth, hands on the belly, and emphasized genitalia), while the Ashdodas lack them entirely. is possible to assign many Philistine figurine heads either to the Psi or Ashdoda types. Generally, short and slender necks are more typical of the Psi-type, while long, thick necks characterize the Ashdoda type. There is, however, a small group of heads whose classification is more problematic. These consist of a few narrow heads and necks with flat tops, or with bird-shaped faces with pinched noses (figs. 10:4; 11 12; also M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: fig. 3.115:6; and possibly M. Dothan 1971: fig. 65:11 and M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: fig. 3.115:10). This group could belong to either the Psi-type or the Ashdoda type, although we believe the latter to be less likely. It is also possible that they belong to an other, as-yet unknown type (see Tau/Phi figurines from LH HIB Midea with bird-shaped heads: Dema kopoulou and Divari-Valakou 2001: 185, pis. 50:f, 51:c). One example from Ashkelon (fig. 10:3) has a narrow head, slightly widening on top, which is painted in red (similarly to fig. 10:1), and with rem nants of a band on the neck. This example probably belonged to a Psi-type figurine. Most Mycenaean LH IIIB-C figurines have bands on top of the polos (see French 1971: 128-31), a feature also found on ex amples from Ashdod (Area G, Stratum X: M. Dothan and Porath 1993: fig. 44:11) and Ashkelon (fig. 10:3; MC 50562). Some of the heads from Ashkelon include unusual features. One large example has a convex head with an elongated protrusion along the top, which seems to continue as a bulge on the front of the head (fig. 10:5; Stager 2006: 15). This may depict a braid of hair tied and fastened to the top of the head,18 similar to depictions on large figures from Cult Room 110 at Tiryns (Kilian 1979: fig. 20; 1981a: fig. 6), Phyla kopi (French 1985: fig. 6:5), and the Temple Complex at Mycenae (Moore and Taylour 1999: pis. 12-14, 19). A similar headdress appears on a figurine from Sinda (Furumark and Adelman 2003: pi. 39:3).19 This may very well be the head of a large Ashdoda figurine. Another head from Ashkelon (fig. 10:6) has a double clay strip applied on the neck/mouth and in between the eyes and ears. The applied ears are elaborately depicted, and the pellet eyes are very large. This double strip of clay may depict a scarf or a necklace worn on or below the mouth and neck and 18 We thank Melissa Vetters from Heidelberg University for suggesting this resemblance to us. 19 We thank Assaf Yasur-Landau for this reference.</page><page sequence="17">A REEXAMINATION OF AEGEAN-STYLE FIGURINES Fig. 10. Heads of Aegean-style figurines. See table 2 for descriptions. tied around the head. While the head could belong to a Psi-type or another type of Aegean-style figurine, its details show a mixture of affinities. For instance, the applied decoration (scarf or necklace) recalls Syrian Bronze Age female figurines (e.g., at Hama: Badre 1980: pi. 5:110). An additional head from Ashkelon (figs. 10:7; 13) shows a necklace (or scarf) on the neck. The top of the head is concave, with in cisions on the rim possibly representing part of the headdress (or even hair); the scarf/necklace is a clay strip applied almost completely around the neck, the ears are applied on the sides, the applied eyes are perforated for pupils, the protruding nose is applied, and the mouth is incised. The facial details are some what different from those of the other Aegean-style figurine heads.20 While these figurine heads have no clear sexual attributes, without further evidence we consider them to be female, for two main reasons: (1) the parallels to these figurines from Mycenaean Greece and Cy prus are almost exclusively female; and (2) no defin itively male Philistine figurines are known. At the same time, the existence of male Philistine figurines cannot be ruled out (see below). 20 A Psi-related figurine from Tell Qasile (Mazar 1986: fig. 6:2) also has a necklace(?) depicted on the neck.</page><page sequence="18">56 BEN-SHLOMO AND PRESS BASOR 353 Fig. 11.

Installation 10048; white slip; height 4.3 cm). Miniature Standing Figurine (Figs. 14, 15:1) Another type that is probably Aegean-style is the miniature freestanding figurine (3-5 cm in height), with two examples coming from Ekron (figs. 14; 15:1; Gunneweg et al. 1986: fig. 1:14) and one from Ashkelon. The lower portion is wider, enabling a stable positioning of the figurine. The posture of the hands, uplifted (in fig. 15:1) and extended forward (in fig. 14), along with the widening and somewhat concave top of the head, alludes to Mycenaean Psi figurines. Figure 14 has a perforation in the lower body, depicting either the female sex or the navel; this feature is notably uncommon for Aegean-style figurines.21 These figurines are crudely made of coarse clay; they are poorly fired and show soot marks. It is possible that they were put in fire in or near hearths. Another possible example is said to come from Tell es-Safi (Schmitt 1999: no. 91, Rock 21 The figurine in fig. 15:1 was analyzed by neutron activation and was determined to come from Ashdod (Gunneweg et al. 1986: 14).

Heads of Other Possible Types of Female or Male Figurines (Fig. 15:2-3) Various heads published from Iron Age Philis tia, and occasionally from other sites, have been identified as Philistine male figurines (T. Dothan 1982: 227-28, fig. 4.5, pi. 12; Schmitt 1999: 619-22, type IV). This identification is far from clear, how ever, based on the actual preserved portions of these figurines. Their connection to the Aegean-style group is based on various iconographie details that reflect Aegean rather than Canaanite traditions. To this group, a large head, neck, and shoulder fragment from Ash 22 A few more fragmentary figurines from the Pentapolis sites may also be miniatures: e.g., Ashkelon MC 40293 (Press 2007: fig. 2:1).</page><page sequence="19">2009 A REEXAMINATION OF AEGEAN-STYLE FIGURINES Fig. 13.

The top of the head is convex but has an uplifted ridge on the edges, per haps depicting a headdress or tiara (as suggested by the painted decoration). The decoration includes horizontal bands on the neck and below it (a hat strap?), and vertical stripes on both sides of the back of the neck. While the headdress and the chin strap may indicate a typical Mycenaean female depiction (see above), Mycenaean depictions of males in clay</page><page sequence="20">BEN-SHLOMO AND PRESS BASOR 353 Fig. 15. Various types of Aegean-style/Philistine figurines. See table 2 for descriptions. do appear, although rarely (e.g., French 1985: 223 30). Somewhat similar Iron Age figurine heads come from Ashdod (M. Dothan and Freedman 1967: fig. 26:3), Afula (M. Dothan 1955: 41, fig. 15:19, pi. VI: 1 ), and Khirbat Sitt Leila (Zephath: Aharoni 1959: fig. 1). Iron IIA-B figurines from Ashdod (fig. 15:3; and the Musicians' Stand: M. Dothan and Ben Shlomo 2005: 181, fig. 3.78:5) and the models from Yavneh (Ziffer and Kletter 2007: 24-25) show a pos sibly similar headdress. The five figures appearing on the Musicians' Stand from Ashdod should be noted (M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: 180-84, figs. 3.78-3.79)? particularly the four smaller ones, as they also illus trate certain elements of Philistine/Aegean coroplasty and iconography (see also Schmitt 1999: 624-27). These include the top of the head (the convex "tiara") and the modeling of the eyes and nose.23 The musi cians on the house model from the favissa at Yavneh are also similarly depicted (Ziffer and Kletter 2007: 24-25, 70-75, no. 1036). Other heads with convex tops and prominent noses that are possible male fig urines were found at Ashdod in Iron II or unstratified contexts (M. Dothan and Freedman 1967: fig. 47:5; M. Dothan 1971: figs. 62:7-8, 63:1; M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: 224, figs. 3.103:1, 3.115:7; see Schmitt 1999: 619-22), Batash Stratum V (Keim and Mazar 1995: fig. C20), Gezer (Macalister 1912: fig. 271), and Tell es-Safi (T Dothan 1982: 227-28, fig. 4.5, pi. 12). 23 The identification of these figurines as male (e.g., Hachlili 1971: 127; T. Dothan and M. Dothan 1992: 171) is possible but not definitive. Note that the peg figurine from Tell Jerishe (Herzog 1984: pl. 7e) has a similar head, but the body clearly has breasts depicted. These objects seem to reflect a continuation of Aegean iconographie style, if not of Aegean-related figurines themselves, in Iron II Philistia. Based on the current evidence, however, these figurines cannot be considered to represent additional types of Aegean style figurines. First, they cannot be classified into clear types, due to the lack of examples preserved below the neck (apart from the musicians). Second, it is not clear at this stage if and how these depictions reflect late Philistine cultural and/or religious com ponents, and what their meaning and significance were. Zoomorphic Decorated Bovine Figurines (Figs. 16-18) The appearance of Aegean-style zoomorphic fig urines in Philistia was not recognized in previous studies, as they are more limited in their distribution. The type is confined, according to the current evi dence, to early Iron I levels at Tel Miqne-Ekron (Strata VII-VI). A group of 12 zoomorphic figurine fragments from Ekron show Aegean affinities and can be labeled Aegean-style decorated zoomorphic figu rines (figs. 16-18; see also tables 2,4:24-34).24 Nine of these figurines come from well-stratified Iron I contexts. Although most of the objects are quite frag mentary, they can be distinguished from the many other undecorated zoomorphic figurines by their clay (characterized by light color, high levigation, and good firing) and modeling as well as their special 24 Another similar monochrome decorated figurine fragment was found at Ekron during the olive factories survey (IAA no. 92 5129, displayed at the Revadim Museum). It has an unusual applied pellet between its front legs.</page><page sequence="21">2009 A REEXAMINATION OF AEGEAN-STYLE FIGURINES 59 0 5cm Fig. 16. Decorated Aegean-style bovine figurines from Ekron.

Four examples (figs. 16:1-2, 4; 17; and Miqne obj. no. 6461) are made of fine calcareous clay and are more similar to the Mycenaean prototypes; the others we consider to be a derivative type (figs. 16:3; 18). Direct links can be traced to LH IIIB-C bovine figurines in the Aegean and LC III examples on Cyprus (see below). The most complete example of this Philistine type was found on the east slope of the acropolis in Stra tum VIIA (figs. 16:1; 17; Ben-Shlomo 2006b: 190, fig. 5.1:1 ) and is the frontal part of a decorated bovine figurine. The dark brown decoration consists of stripes along the snout and dewlap, two dots as eyes, stripes on the horns, and a ladder-shaped pattern on the sides of the neck and legs (a harness design?); the design is quite naturalistic. Aegean parallels include figurines from the Syringes at Tiryns (Weber-Hiden 1990: pis. 41.71, 47.149) and LH IIIC Phylakopi (French 1985: pl. 46.C.148); compare also an example from LC III Enkomi (Dikaios 1969-1971: pi. 137:23). Another example (fig. 16:2), found on a Stratum VI floor, is a frontal torso fragment of a decorated figu rine. The neck and front legs are broken, though the pinched dewlap is preserved. The decoration includes a net pattern on the back and ladders on the sides of the legs. This pattern is common on Mycenaean bovine figurines, especially from the LH HIB and IIIC (French 1971: 156-58). Similar examples were found at Tiryns (Weber-Hiden 1990: pi. 42.86; Kil ian 1981b: fig. 12). A figurine torso (fig. 16:4; found near the cultic room of Area INE.3) is decorated by two shades of red with straight and wavy horizontal lines and dots scattered between them. There are also traces of burning marks on the body. This pattern may depict a harness and/or the hair texture or spots on the animal's body. Similar decorated figurines, usually identified as bovine, were found at Enkomi (Dikaios 1969-1971: pi. 162:36) and in LH IIIC con texts at Tiryns (Zangger 1994: fig. 7; Weber-Hiden 1990: pi. 46:136; Kilian 1978: fig. 6), Mycenae (French 1971: pi. 26.a, d), and Phylakopi (French 1985: pi. 46.2348). Other decorated bovine figurine fragments from Ekron are similar in form but are not as well exe cuted as, or as similar to, the Mycenaean prototypes in terms of clay type, firing, shape, decoration (in both shade and quality), and surface finish (figs. 16:3; 18). These include figure 18, found near a Stratum VI pottery kiln in Field INE (Ben-Shlomo 2006b: 190). It is a front part of a decorated figurine with reddish brown stripes in the form of a "harness." An example coming from a Stratum VIC fill is the complete neck and body of a decorated figurine (fig. 16:3). A lump of clay, applied on the back, may depict the Zebu hump, while a pinched ridge depicts the dewlap. These naturalistic attributes are not common for Mycenaean figurines, yet have parallels from Cyprus (see Kara georghis 1993: pis. 21-22, esp. 22.6; Furumark and Adelman 2003: 118, pi. 37). The decoration, consist ing of vertical and horizontal stripes, forms a "har ness" pattern (the "spine"-type decoration; see French 1971: 151). A very similar figurine, also from an early 12th-century b.c.e. context, was found at En komi (Dikaios 1969-1971: 735, pi. 170.1160); an other possible parallel comes from Lefkandi (French 2006: 263, pi. 75:60). A figurine body with two left legs intact (Miqne obj. no. 1471) has vertical and horizontal bands on the body, creating a harness pat tern; the brown decoration is of a wide vertical band around the body and bands along the legs.25 Other decorated bovine figurines of similar style from Cy prus, probably locally made, include examples from Maa-Palaeokastro (Karageorghis and Demas 1988: pis. 171:150, 154; 212:424), Enkomi (Dikaios 1969 1971: pi. 131:41, 43, 45), and Sinda (Furumark and Adelman 2003: 118, pis. 37, 39).26 The similarity of these figurines to the Aegean prototypes can be seen in the choice and treatment of the clay and body shaping, and above all in the deco ration. The traditional local zoomorphic figurines are almost never decorated with paint, and their bod ies are mostly ovoid?in contrast to the cylindrical bodied Aegean-style figurines (Ben-Shlomo 1999: 52, 60-62, figs. 28-30); at the same time, the Philis tine examples are not as cylindrical and elongated as the LH III examples. We can tentatively identify all of these figurine fragments as bovine, based on both the body details (such as dewlap and shoulder hump) and complete parallels known from the Aegean and Cyprus (see above).27 It is especially noteworthy that the decorated bovine figurines appear in Philistia only at Ekron, and that they are the only Aegean style figurine type appearing in Stratum VII, the earliest Iron I level (see discussion below). 25 A somewhat similar LH HIB:2 bovine figurine was found at Mycenae (Tamvaki 1973: fig. 8.50). 26 See also Webb 1999: 218-19 for a discussion of these figurines as votives. 27 It should be noted that LH HIB anthropomorphic and zoo morphic figurines were also found at Miqne and Ashkelon (e.g., Ashkelon MC 52434), but the difference in clay can be visually recognized. Chemical analysis showed two examples of these bo vine figurines to be locally made (Ben-Shlomo 2006a: 44, 189, samples MQ59-60).</page><page sequence="23">2009 A REEXAMINATION OF AEGEAN-STYLE FIGURINES 61 CONTEXT, DISTRIBUTION, AND CHRONOLOGY As noted above, we are not yet able to discuss issues of function and chronology in much detail, due to the fact that the stratigraphie analysis at Tel Miqne-Ekron and Ashkelon is still in progress (see, however, Gitin, Meehl, and Dothan 2006; Stager, Schloen, and Master 2008: 216-17). Certainly, given the previous state of knowledge of these figurines and the wealth of new data we have analyzed, the major aim of this article is producing a basic typol ogy. Nevertheless, we feel it is important to investi gate function and chronology at least briefly here, while, at the same time, we plan to treat these as pects of the Philistine figurines more exhaustively in future publications. We believe that the function of the figurines should be derived primarily from their context.28 Apart from one example from Ashdod, however, no complete (or nearly complete) Aegean style figurine has been found in Philistia. This fact might limit the significance of any contextual analy sis, as small fragments of figurines could be easily redeposited within the site in mudbricks, walls, and fills.29 Nevertheless, the findspots of several of the larger examples may well be of significance, espe cially as an indication of the basic types of contexts of these figurines (e.g., whether they are characteris tic of domestic or public buildings). It is therefore worth looking briefly at the figurine contexts at each major site. At Ashdod, the nearly complete Ashdoda was found in Stratum XI in Area H in a building abutting the street (M. Dothan 1971: 161, plan 21), within a small room. No other Aegean-style figurines or spe cial finds were found in this room. The unique "apsidal building" of Stratum XII on the other side of the street (M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: 23 25, plan 2.5) contained no figurines. In the affluent Building 5337 of Stratum XII (M. Dothan and Ben Shlomo 2005: 26-30, plans 2.5-2.7) only one pos sible fragment of an Ashdoda figurine was found in the main hall (M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: fig. 3.36:4), while the two Psi-type figurines (fig. 1:5, 7; M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: fig. 3.36:2-3) were found in Building 5128 on the other side of the street, below the building where the complete Ash 28 Cf. French (1971: 107; 1981b: 173) on the Mycenaean figurines; see also Nilsson 1968: 307-9. 29 Cf. Mazow (2005: 247, 388) on "primary" vs. "secondary" discard practices/behavior at Ekron. doda was found. The other examples from Strata XI-X in Areas H and G were found in fills or pits in open areas. During the Iron II in Ashdod Area D, especially in pits of Stratum VII, many fragments of the Late Ashdoda type, with only the seat preserved, were found together with a number of kernos fragments (M. Dothan 1971: fig. 63; Ben-Shlomo 1999: 122, fig. 36). Several pits of Stratum VII (M. Dothan 1971: plan 8, Pits 1067, 1096, and 1122) contained two or three examples of Ashdoda seat fragments each, as well as plaque figurines in the Canaanite tradition and zoomorphic kernoi (M. Dothan 1971: figs. 64, 70). The interpretation of these finds as favissae of a possibly Iron IIB cult place near the city wall (similar to the one presented in Stratum VII: M. Dothan and Freedman 1967: 133-34, plan 7; Yasur-Landau 2001: 335) cannot be ruled out. How ever, these pits could simply be refuse pits related to the industrial area (Ben-Shlomo 1999: 122) and would thus represent material discarded from domes tic contexts. The pits postdate the cultic room and contain many other pottery vessels as well, and thus may not be directly associated with a cultic center. Only one "miniature" late Ashdoda seat was found in Room 1010 near the "cultic corner" (M. Dothan 1971: fig. 43:7). Other fragments from Area D Strata IX-VII come from various open areas. In Grid 38 at Ashkelon, no Aegean-style figurines were found in Phase 20. In Phase 19 two Psi-type fig urines (fig. 1:4, 9) were found, one in a mudbrick wall and the other in the occupational debris of a house. The figurines are more common in Phases 18 and 17, with over a dozen found scattered among the fills and floors of the "north villa," the "south villa," and the courtyard in between.30 Apparently, these con texts all reflect domestic buildings of relatively afflu ent Philistine households.31 At Tel Miqne-Ekron, five zoomorphic figurines come from the earliest Iron I stratum, VII, while no female figurines appear in this stage. All but one of the bovine figurines came from Field INE, including 30 See Cross and Stager (2006: 132), Stager (2006: 14), and Stager, Schloen, and Master (2008: 266, 272) for recent published citations of this distribution. Note, however, that the figurines were not concentrated in the "north villa," as cited by Cross and Stager. 31 Note that the Iron I stratigraphy for Grid 38 is still being analyzed, and so a detailed contextual study of the figurines is not yet available. For a provisional discussion, see Press 2007: 269, 314.</page><page sequence="24">BEN-SHLOMO AND PRESS BASOR 353 the large bovine fragment (fig. 16:1) found in an area of industrial character (Ben-Shlomo 1999: fig. 4); two additional fragments (fig. 18; obj. no. 6519) were found near the Stratum VIA kilns (Ben-Shlomo 1999: fig. 5). One figurine was found in an open area in Field IV Lower, Stratum VIIB (obj. no. 6641: Ben-Shlomo 1999: fig. 7). In Stratum VI a Psi-type figurine (fig. 1:1) was found in relation to rounded Hearth 23086 in Room a of Building 354 (Mazow 2005: 271). In the same room in Stratum IVB, an Ashdoda fragment was found (fig. 5:7). It seems, however, that no such figurines were found in Build ing 350 of Strata V-IV, which has been interpreted as a public building or a temple (T. Dothan 2003; on the architectural units in Field IV Lower, see Mazow 2005). Two figurine heads were found in a Stratum VIA pit in Field ISW. In Field INE, in debris near the "cultic" room in Area INE.3 (T. Dothan 2003:208, fig. 17), a decorated torso of a zoomorphic figurine was found (fig. 16:4; Ben-Shlomo 1999: 117, fig. 6). Other figurine fragments came from fills or unstrati fied contexts. At Tell Qasile, no Aegean-style figurines were found in the temple. Two examples (Mazar 1986: fig. 6:1-2) were found, however, in a domestic area (in Area A). It is also noteworthy that the Yavneh favissa (though quite later), which probably contained cultic objects from a temple at Tel Yavneh in northern Iron IIA Philistia, included no Aegean-style figurines (Ziffer and Kletter 2007: 28)?although some of the human figurines attached to the cult stands display Aegean elements, as mentioned above. Therefore, the contextual data, although partial, points to the appear ance of the Aegean-style figurines in domestic build ings, rather than in temples or public buildings (see also Yasur-Landau 2001: 335), at least for the Iron I. It should be noted that Palace-Temple Complex 650 of the seventh century b.c.e. at Tel Miqne-Ekron, which was dedicated to a female Philistine goddess, Ptgyh (Gitin, Dothan, and Naveh 1997; Sch?fer Lichtenberger 2000; Yasur-Landau 2001: 337-38), also included no such figurines (S. Gitin, personal communication). Thus, the appearance of the Late Ashdoda figurines at Iron II Ashdod may reflect the same domestic use they had during the Iron I (contra Yasur-Landau 2001: 335). One type of context for which we have almost no information, however, is burials, as no cemetery of the Philistine cities has yet been excavated. The mourning figurines could fill this gap, if we rely on the few unprovenanced examples (discussed above). On the other hand, no evidence for Aegean-style figurines comes from the excavated burials at Azor, or from the "500" ceme tery at Tell Farah (S). A comparison with the contexts of Mycenaean figurines in the Aegean is helpful, given the gaps in our knowledge of Philistine contexts. While earlier studies in particular associated Mycenaean figurines with burials (e.g., Tsountas 1888: 167; Mylonas 1966: 114; for discussion and references, see French 1971: 107-8; Tzonou-Herbst 2002: chap. 2), neither female nor zoomorphic figurines are necessarily common in LH HIB and IIIC funerary contexts. At Perati a total of 14 female figurines (7 mourning figurines?from just two tombs?and 7 Psi figurines) were found in a cemetery of 219 tombs, most of which were cham ber tombs with multiple burials (Iakovidis 1969). There were similar numbers in the cemetery at Ialy sos (about 20 figurines), again with over 100 graves (Maiuri 1923-1924; Benzi 1992; see Tzonou-Herbst 2002: 264-65). On the other hand, these figurines seem to be quite common in domestic contexts. Very large numbers have been cited for Mycenae (over 1,100; French 1971: 107) and for LH HIB Midea (175 total; Demakopoulou and Divari-Valakou 2001:182); these include large numbers of fragments from ap parently secondary contexts?but these are figurines that were not deposited in tombs. Other examples of LH IIIC figurines in domestic contexts include Aigeira (Alram-Stern 2006) and Lefkandi (French 2006) on the mainland and Chania on Crete (Winbladh 2000). Figurines are also relatively rare in "official" shrines (e.g., at Mycenae: Moore and Tay lour 1999; and Phy lakopi: French 1985) where cult images (the large terracotta figures) were found. The LH IIIC shrine at Asine is a possible exception (H?gg 1981).32 The appearance of these figurines in various quantities in domestic contexts (e.g., Kilian 1990; Demakopoulou and Divari-Valakou 2001) has often been associated with beads and other small finds (Tzonou-Herbst 2002: 206-39), including during the LH IIIC (Kilian 1990; M. Vetters, personal communication).33 Kala podi is another example of an LH IIIC shrine (along Asine) with Psi and other figurines, although there are no larger terracotta figures reported there (Felsch 1981; 2001: 195, pi. 58b). At Tiryns, Psi and bovine figurines were found in various rooms in the Unter burg LH IIIC levels (Kilian 1978: figs. 6-7; 1979: 32 See Press 2007 for further discussion of Mycenaean cultic contexts and their significance for Philistine female figurines. 33 We wish to thank Melissa Vetters of Heidelberg University, who is currently working on the figurines from Tiryns, for inform ing us of some of her still unpublished results.</page><page sequence="25">2009 A REEXAMINATION OF AEGEAN-STYLE FIGURINES 63 390-91, figs. 12-15; 1982: figs. 29-31), yet in cultic Rooms 110 and 117, only hollow bovine figures were reported (Kilian 1992: 21). At Tiryns and other sites there may be a general decrease in the number of female figurines during the LH IIIC (Kilian 1992: 24; French 2006: 261; M. Vetters, personal communi cation). French (1981a: 45) reports that no bovine figurines appear at the LH IIIB2 sanctuaries of Mycenae, and their findspots are mainly domestic. Tzonou-Herbst, in analyzing the contexts of figurines at Mycenae and Prosymna, concluded that during the LH III A2-B there is a rise in the occurrence of fig urines in burials (Tzonou-Herbst 2002: 264-65). It is not clear if this pattern is more widespread, how ever. Furthermore, even at these sites the majority of figurines came from the settlements and not from cemeteries (see Tzonou-Herbst 2002: 279). Finally, it is worth noting that the appearance of figurines in connection with hearths, as at Ekron, was recorded at Chania, Crete, where two Phi-type figurines were found near a circular LM IIIB2 hearth (D'Agata 2001: 347). Begg, dealing with the contexts of Late Cypriot female and zoomorphic figurines, reached several conclusions about the bovine figurines of the Myce naean type (Begg 1991: 63, type III. 1). Some are found in domestic contexts, while others are related to cultic contexts, mainly in connection to industrial and metallurgical installations. Begg reconstructed their positioning on benches or high places near the walls (Begg 1991: 19). These figurines are not con nected, in his view, to the "Sea Peoples" of the 12th century b.c.e., but reflect the use of foreign, rare cult objects by the local elite (Begg 1991: 39). However, the large assemblage, consisting mostly of Psi-like figurines, found in the courtyard and units to the west of the Sanctuary of the Ingot God at Enkomi (Cour tois 1971: 326-43, figs. 141-54), may indicate that these figurines appeared suddenly during the LC IIIC (Webb 1999: 213-15) or the CG I (Karageorghis 2001: 324) and were related to (new?) cult practices in Cyprus. On the whole, then, the appearance of the Aegean-style figurines in domestic contexts in Phi listia appears to parallel finds of similar figurines published so far from the 13th?11th centuries, espe cially in the Aegean. DISCUSSION According to the updated assemblage presented here, which includes over 120 examples of Aegean style figurines from three excavated Philistine city sites (of which about 60 had not been published pre viously; see tables 3-5), three basic, clear types with strong Aegean affinities are apparent: the standing, Psi-type female figurine; the seated "Ashdoda" figu rine; and the decorated bovine figurines. Other types such as "mourning" female figurines appear rarely (if at all) at the Pentapolis sites and include mostly unprovenanced examples. It may be that "mourn ing figurines" were more common in burial contexts. As no cemetery of the Philistine cities has been ex cavated, however, and no figurines appear at the pos sible Philistine cemeteries of Tell Farah (S) and Azor, this suggestion remains speculative. Only fragmen tary items may indicate additional types such as Tau related figurines or possible male figurines. We believe that the major types described above can indeed be defined as Aegean-style, as they either originate as, or are derived from, Mycenaean proto types. We have shown that these figurines from Philistia are much more strongly connected to the LH IIIC Aegean than to the LC III Cypriot culture. This is based on both the degree of similarity in the parallels cited and their number, as well as on the fact that most of the Cypriot parallels that do exist are also defined as "Mycenaean" types and are not typical of the Late Cypriot culture. Exceptions may be represented by several of the decorated bovine figurines from Ekron, which have closer parallels on Cyprus. Direct interaction between Cyprus and Phi listia during the Iron Age I could have played a cer tain role in the diffusion and development of these figurine types; according to the evidence so far avail able, however, it seems this role was not a principal one. The development and continuation of Philistine coroplasty and iconography are further attested by various head fragments from the Iron II, as well as by figurines from the Musicians' Stand and from the Yavneh favissa assemblage. These are, however, de rivative forms and do not reflect specific and inde pendent Aegean-affiliated types. The development of Aegean-style figurines may be compared with that of the Philistine decorated pottery (see Ben-Shlomo 2006a: 46-75; 2008, on zoomorphic vessels). In the initial stage the similarities in form, decoration, and technique to the Mycenaean prototypes are very high (the Monochrome/Philistine 1 stage; T. Dothan, Gitin, and Zukerman 2006: 72, 80-87); in the sec ond stage (the Bichrome/Philistine 2 stage) the simi larities decrease in all aspects, and hybrid types start to occur; and in the third stage ("debased'VPhilis tine 3), the Philistine artifacts merely echo the Aegean</page><page sequence="26">64 BEN-SHLOMO AND PRESS Table 3.

During the Iron II, possible new types dis playing Philistine style occur, similar to the appear ance of the Late Philistine pottery (Ben-Shlomo, Shai, and Maeir 2004). As a percentage of the total corpus of Iron I figu rines, the Aegean-style terracottas are in fact clearly predominant. The only other figurines that may be said to constitute distinct types in the Iron I are the undecorated coarse zoomorphic figurines, which are also probably associated with the Philistine culture (Ben-Shlomo 1999: 62), and perhaps a small group of undecorated, nude female figurines (Press 2007: 248-49). Given that few if any Canaanite-style female figurines appear during the Iron I at the Philistine sites, the presence of the Aegean-style figurines is more significant, as they constitute the best evidence for possible domestic cult in this period. The fact that Aegean-style bovine figurines have so far been found only at the earliest levels at Ekron may indicate that the cultic (or other cultural) practices related to these figurines were less widespread among the Philistines than those related to the female figurines.34 The stand 34 Moreover, 10 of 11 examples came from the upper city, in Field INE, where the earliest phase of Stratum VII (Phase 9D) is attested, possibly a phase predating the earliest settlement in the lower city, which contains only small amounts of Philistine Mono chrome pottery (Gitin, Meehl, and Dothan 2006: 30-33). ing Psi-type figurines become common during later phases of the Iron I (see fig. 9). Moreover, the Ash doda figurines are the only type of figurine clearly continuing into the Iron II (although found so far only at Ashdod), in a "debased" form. This and other evidence surveyed above suggests that the Ashdoda figurines, which were the first Aegean-style type developed exclusively in Philistia, reflect more im portant and widespread cultural practices among the Philistines. During the late Iron I these figurines also occur beyond the Pentapolis sites, at other sites in Philistia and southern Israel, in small quantities. Should we interpret the female figurines as repre senting goddesses, priestesses, devotees, or votives? Concerning the identification of the seated figurines, it has been suggested that they depict goddesses seated on a throne (Yasur-Landau 2001), in line with various Aegean depictions of a similar type of god dess (Nilsson 1968: 350-51; Rehak 1995: 106, 116 17). Similar seated figures appear on a cylinder seal from Ashdod (M. Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: 166, fig. 3.66) and on a cylinder seal from Maa Palaeokastro (Porada 1988: 305, pi. G:4, no. 560). The meaning of these objects and their iconographie world is clearly cultic, possibly related to the impor tant or even principal role the seated female image (an "enthroned goddess" or queen) played within the Aegean society and cult (Rehak 1995).

The Ashdoda figu rines have been interpreted as goddesses in several studies dealing with Philistine cult and religion (Singer 1992; Schmitt 1999: 635-43; Mazar 2000; Yasur Landau 2001), although the identity of this goddess has not been agreed upon: while T Dothan (1982: 234), Mazar (2000: 223), and Yasur-Landau (2001) have stressed its Aegean identity, Brug proposed a Canaanite origin (1985: 186) and Sherratt suggested a connection with the cult of sailors and merchants of the eastern Mediterranean (1998: 306-8). Singer, meanwhile, suggested a connection to the Anatolian Kybele/Kubaba (Singer 1992). It has been suggested that, as standing female and bovine figurines appear in large quantities in the Aegean, they must represent votive offerings (e.g., Rousioti 2001: 309) rather than deities.

This identification is suggested by the appearance of large sized Psi-like figures in the Argolid (e.g., Asine: Fr? din and Persson 1938: fig. 206; Tiryns: Kilian 1978: 461, 465, figs. 17, 20-21; 1981a; Mycenae: Moore and Taylour 1999: 89-101) and the depiction of seated females with the same upraised arm postures (as at Aghia Triada, Crete: Rethemiotakis 1998: 172, pi. 8:a; and the mainland: Mylonas 1956). The Philistine immigrants arriving in Philistia dur ing the 12th century are likely to have originated from the LH IIIC Aegean society. As the specific function of the Aegean-style figurines in Philistia (according to the limited contextual evidence available so far)</page><page sequence="30">BEN-SHLOMO AND PRESS BASOR 353 seems to be for domestic cult use, the appearance of the Psi-type and Ashdoda figurines in Philistine houses implies that certain Aegean religious prac tices were similarly carried by these immigrants.35 Thus, the similarities in the form of figurines found in the 12th century b.c.e. in the Aegean, Cyprus, and Philistia may reflect a significant connection between these populations during this period. The process of "creolization" (Ben-Shlomo, Shai, and Maeir 2004: 20), "cultural fusion" (Uziel 2007), or "acculturation" (Stone 1995) of the Philistine society, in which the local habits are adopted while keeping certain characteristics of the original immi grant culture, is manifested in our view by the female figurines as well. An early stage, in which homeland customs are followed more precisely, is followed by a stage in which some of the customs are dropped, while others are transformed to be more in line with the local culture. Still, certain basic components con tinue, especially the centrality of seated and clothed goddesses (the schematic breasts merely indicating the sex), contrary to the Canaanite fertility Asherah, depicted naked. This Mycenaean female deity (or deities) may have been a major focus of Philistine worship, together with Bacal, who appears in the Iron IIC temple (Gitin and Cogan 1999) at Tel Miqne Ekron as well as in the biblical "Bacal Zebub" of Ekron (see, e.g., Gitin 2003). Note, however, that no Aegean-style figurines appear in the temples of Tell Qasile or in the Yavneh favissa. In addition, the sev enth-century temple at Tel Miqne-Ekron, which is dedicated to a certain female goddess, Ptgyh,36 con tained no such figurines. The Iron II figurines from Ashdod probably reflect the continuation of the use of terracotta female figurines for domestic cult, which included in this stage also local Astarte-type figurines as well. A similar process may have occurred on Cyprus during the 12th and 11th centuries, where the female and bovine figurines, initially inspired by Mycenaean or Cretan prototypes, eventually became 35 Isolated imported LH IIIA-B female and bovine figurines from LBII contexts, which are scattered at various sites and also within Canaanite shrines, do not indicate such activities, as the religious meaning of these items was likely ignored and they were seen only as exotic artifacts (Petrovic 2004). 36 The most popular interpretations for the identity of Ptgyh have been a form of the Greek Potnia, "the lady," a name or title of one or more Aegean goddesses (Demsky 1997: 1-5), or as nam ing the goddess (Pytho?) Gaia (see Sch?fer-Lichtenberger 2000). Yasur-Landau (2001: 337-38) has tried to combined the two, sug gesting Ptgyh = Pot[nia] Gaia. absorbed into local religious iconography (Kara georghis 2001: 323-27). CONCLUSIONS The recent excavations at Ashkelon and Tel Miqne-Ekron have added about 60 items to the as semblage of Aegean-style figurines from Iron Age Philistia, previously including examples almost ex clusively from Ashdod. When examining this much larger assemblage, it is apparent that only three clear types of Aegean-style figurines are evident: the standing Psi-type female figurine, the seated Ash doda-type female figurine, and decorated bovine fig urines. Other forms such as the mourning figurines and male figurines appear rarely, if at all. These main types appear in different variants and fabrics, and become more distant from their Aegean prototypes, over the course of the Iron Age, with the Ashdoda type alone continuing into the Iron II. The style of the figurines from Philistia shows various connections to the LH IIIC tradition in the Aegean region but also to LC III Cyprus. In some cases a unique Philistine style evolved. Yet it seems that, on the whole, the rele vant Cypriot examples were also derived from Ae gean prototypes. Therefore, the term "Aegean-style" for these Philistine figurines is justified. Given this development, along with the fact that evidence from many LH IIIC sites is still unpublished, it is difficult to trace a single stylistic source for these figurines. They may well attest a mixture of styles. The contexts of these finds, mostly in domestic buildings, also seem in line with some contemporary finds in the Aegean and Cyprus. While the typical Aegean forms of the figurines gradually disappear or merge into the local style, distinct (iconographie or stylistic) components persist in the coroplastic human depictions of Philistia throughout the Iron Age. The figurines, according to both context and form, probably reflect domestic, popular cultic practices, both in Philistia and the Ae gean. In the case of the Philistines, it seems that we are dealing with practices brought to Philistia by indi vidual immigrants rather than by a centralized urban religious establishment. Most of the religious compo nents of the figurines, reflected in their posture and details of dress, do not persist into the Iron II as the Philistine society and its material culture becomes more closely linked to the local Canaanite-Levantine culture. Nevertheless, later variants of the Ashdoda type indicate that some influence of Aegean terracotta production and of Aegean iconography persisted in the Philistine cities to the end of the Iron Age.</page><page sequence="31">2009 A REEXAMINATION OF AEGEAN-STYLE FIGURINES 69 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We wish to thank Professors Trude Dothan and Sey mour Gitin for permitting us to publish the figurines from Tel Miqne-Ekron, Professor Lawrence Stager and the Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon for permitting us to publish the figurines from Ashkelon, and the Israel Antiquities Authority for use of the illustrations of the figurines from Ashdod.
