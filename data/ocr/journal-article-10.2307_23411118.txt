The following account is based on 12 months' sthnomusicological fieldworkonTaku between 1994 and 2000. Takû s pantheon consists of spirits who arrived on the four founding canoes, their known descendants, putative descendants, and one malevolent spirit of no known origin; all are believed to reside on the atoll and the surrounding ocean. It is the duty of the community's spiritual leader, the Ariki, to harness the support of these spirits to ensure ongoing phys ical wellbeing, clement weather, bountiful gardens and fishing grounds, and protection against attack by predator fish. By wearing the emblems of his per sonal spirit, Pûkena, while officiating on the ritual arena, the Ariki also ensures communal protection asainst any malevolent invisible spirits attracted by the sound and sight of group singing and dancing. And these duties continue, largely because of a 40 year Dan on v.vnristian missionaries anu cnuicnes imposed by the community itself, as a reaction to the perceived loss of culture following the mission ization of neighboring islands. Taku represents one of the last Polynesian communities still practicing its traditional religion under its traditional forms of leadership. The material representation of- the spirit Pukena was an anthropomorphic wooden figure kept in its own house adjacent to that of the Ariki, and erect ed outside for several months at a time so that the community could entertain it with daily singing and dancing. The last such image or rukena was created Associate Professor of Ethnomusicology, University of Auckland in the 19th century, and the material rorm or the spirit exists now only in the form of his topknot, which the Ariki wears on ritual occasions.

A vessel appeared, it came on and on and entered the passage at Nukurëkia and imme diately anchored there at the entrance to the passage. While at anchor at the entrance, the crew went ashore at Nukurëkia to collect fire wood. The crew were all [from?] Ponway, and tney went asnore togetner witn some Europeans. Having got their firewood, they brought it to the vessel. When they went ashore, they found Sinatea hana there, so they took Sinateahana with them, loaded it on board, and rowed back to their vessel. The Europeans and those Pon way; the Ponway were black people, and they returned to their vessel and put Sinateahana on top. Then they departed. They threw Sinateahana up on top of the boat, the resident spirit of Nukurëkia. The captain and mate wanted to sail away but when they set off, their ship began to list at Lilt iai biuc oi nit rcei passage, it stayeu mere, its mast pointing first downwards then came up, listing to the other side. When it steadied itself, they sailed on to the entrance at the back. The waves lifted the bow first up then sank it. The captain went down with his ship, then called out to his crew to get into the lifeboat. The chief officer boarded the lifeboat together with other crewmembers. They hoisted sail, and set off at the back of the middle reef. They sailed on beyond the reef, .1 c i a i Tl boats then returned to Nukurëkia. The ship itself sank and its cannon fell overboard at the back entrance. The shin sank into a hole, and the Ponway rowed towards Nukurekia. While staying there, Takii men came and visited them, but that's where those Ponway stayed. The men from Taku gave them food and they stayeu tnere, excnanging scones. iNext day, they returned with more food to give to the Ponway, but the Ponway had already departed and nobody was there.

Despite provision for the repatriation of cultural artifacts among United Nations member countries, however, the Ariki has stated that, after consideration, he does not intend applying for the return of the three figures, on the grounds that the associated rituals have long been discarded and for gotten and the figures future presence on the atoll would therefore be potentially dangerous. Unlike the routine recarving of a new figure of Piikena, which formerly occurred when the existing untreat ed wooden image eventually rotted, no precedent exists in religious practice or oral tradi tion for the renewal of figures deliberately removed from the island. The event was, and still is, suffi ciently foreign to Takû thinking as to defy compre hension, but served to emphasize to the communi ty the somewhat precarious state of their r^rt=&gt;rt=&gt;A f*r\ r^Ko c^&gt;rl rifiiol lift* \xfhir~h acciim^rl r\r^»c_ ences rather than absences, knowledge rather than ignorance, and confidence rather than confusion. bomewhat ironically, therefore, the same religious belief that ascribed significance to these figures a century ago is now effectively blocking their return. Several named spirits resided on the islet, includ ing Teitoro, Sipa, Afelo (abbreviated as Felo) and Aserutahelo (abbreviated as Aseru). Sinateahana herself is identified by her alternative name, Sinariki. Of these spirits, the images of three — Sinateahana, Sipa and Aseru — had been erected on the beach and all three were uprooted and taken away. Al though the poetry names the boat captain as 'Tui,' I am unaware of any further identifying details. The poetry does, however, identify two forms of com miinirv rpartinn rn rhe rhefr Relio-inns leaders rame at night and sprinkled sanctified liquid over the boat in a protective gesture towards the figures on board, a practice they still do over a mortally sick resident. And, as the vessel containing the hgures moved slowly away, the island's men formed a defensive line on the beach against the possibility ot any further landing by the crew. Conclusion This sakitan rlanre r.nn tin lies to he performed on occasions commemorating the death of a member of Hare Nioro clan, which formerly exercised juris diction over Nukurëkia. Another song, similarly icmt-/-\ tv^rtrvrfc fhof t~hf=&gt; tlipff was followed by a tidal wave that swamped the island, ascribing a causal connection between the two events indicative of supernatural wrath at the loss. Three wooden figures provenanced to the Mortlock Islands (Taku) were presented to the Leipzig Museum (Fig. i) in 1911 by an otherwise unidentified Canrain Nauer. Since Takil oral tradi tion records only one theft of such figures, it seems likely that those in Leipzig are Sinateahana, Sipa, and Aseru. In 1999, acting on advice from Takû ex Note i.
