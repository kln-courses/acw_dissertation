<plain_text><page sequence="1">Walter Woodburn Hyde, Paganism to Christianity in the Roman Empire (Philadelphia: U. of Penn. Press, 1946). Pp. viii, 296. $4.00. Seven chapters and an epilogue give the author's views on the religion of pagan Rome with its later cult of the Emperor; eastern mystery-religions; Judaism and the O.T.; Jesus' personality and teaching; and finally, the development of the Church to the time of Theodosius the Great. Three excursuses treat of the origin of Christmas; Sunday observance; and the question whether St. Peter was ever at Rome. The author has set himself the gigantic task of telling the story of "the trans- formation of Christianity into a secularized institution during its struggle with the pagan order of the Roman Empire (p. 7) ." Inasmuch as he consistently chooses the darker colors, it will be instructive to note his preferences in the matter of authorities and to indicate some Of his favorite ideas, thus preparing the reader for the shock of his conclusions. Those which are here mentioned specifically are intended to give a fair estimate of the contents and method of this book, and secondly to show how persistently the old stock in trade attitudes of liberalism and materialism cling to the 445</page><page sequence="2">446 Book Reviews intelligentsia, and finally to give proof - if it be needed - that the battle, far from being over and won, still rages fiercely. Advances made in archeology and textual criticism have rudely shaken one critical and radical position after another, yet in circles left of center sane conservative answers are still without honor. In the matter of authorities the author refers approvingly to (among many others of course) names like Frazer, Gibbon, and Lecky, and especially where he deals with the N.T., to Renan, Loisy, S. Reinach, Klausner, Goodenough. The conclusions are what might be expected. Let us see some of them. Moses, the semi-mythical national hero of Judaism, taught a primitive type of anthropomorphic monotheism, although monotheism as we understand it was not attained until the time of Amos or Isaiah. Yahweh was the local god of Sinai or Horeb, a fire-deity of a clan (p. 79 ff passim ). Christianity is a syncretism, made up of elements drawn from Zoroastrianism through Judaism, and a mystery religion influenced by Mithraism (pp. 60, 65, 205). The reader will learn that the Gospels are untrustworthy, as "they all lack ob- jectivity" (p. 123), and none of them is the work of an eye-witness. Mark was the first written, and his plagiarists were called Matthew and Luke (p. 125). The im- portant Rylands papyrus fragment of John 18:31-33 and 37-38 (the earliest N.T. fragment in our possession) throws "little light on the date of John" (p. 128). Following these principles, a strange picture of Christ is a foregone conclusion. He was with Paul the co-founder of Christianity (pp. Ill, 160). He promised a "joyful millenial future here on earth" (p. 102), and at some point in His life sud- denly came to believe that He was the Messiah (p. 155). Whether He was or not "is a matter of faith rather than of historical fact" (ibid). He worked no miracles, but was possessed of a not too uncommon kind of personal magnetic power (p. 190). Some of the miracles attributed to Him "certainly arose from wrong translations of oral Aramaic, e.g., Jesus' "walking on the sea," which reads in the Peshitto "along the sea" (p. 190). Christ was crucified and was buried, and His resurrection is well attested in the N.T.; but the details abound in contradictions, myth, and the telescoping of events (p. 142) . The appearances of the risen Jesus are perhaps to be explained like His other apparitions "as a group hallucination" (p. 164). It was St. Paul then who universalized the teaching of Christ (p. llOff). As for St. Peter, he was like the other eleven, merely an Apostle. Christ had no idea of founding a Church, so why should He have set up Peter as its head? And too, the author notes with finality that it is Peter's own Gospel (Mark) which omits the promise of the keys and the primacy (p. 161). Christianity and the Church are usually found coupled in these pages with such ideas as intolerance (p. 200), puritanical opposition to intellectual progress (p. 244), unwillingness to refrain from politics, etc. The Church of Rome, unlike the Refor- mation which was intellectual (?) in character, still appeals to the emotions (p. 236), and it is the "citadel of conservatism and illiberality" (p. 238); it is guilty of as- tonishing innovations such as infallibility (p. 237), yet is opposed to the spirit of progress within the Church (ibid.). Organized Christianity is here to stay, it seems, but is weighted down with non- essential doctrines and beliefs, and its only hope is to modernize Church beliefs, and thus win to its cause some of the more intelligent of the race.</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 447 The first excursus deals with "the most widespread myth of Christendom," Christmas, a pagan feast adopted in the fourth century. The Bethlehem story is of course a later addition, prompted by the desire to connect Jesus as Messiah with David (p. 129). Though it was not Jesus' birthplace, Bethlehem was the center of the cult of Adonis (p. 256). The second excursus develops or recalls some of the excesses which have attended on Sunday observance, and concludes that Christ knew nothing of such observance (a later development, p. 257), and apparently would care less. The final excursus denies to St. Peter any part in the establishing of the Roman Church; and the "claim of the Roman Church to universal authority based on the fulfilment of Jesus' words to Peter has little historical basis" (p. 270ff). It may be objected that we have narrowly restricted our attention to a classical historian's views on Christ and the Church. But Christ and His Church are the focal point of history, without which history cannot be written, and it may be presumed that if the author has failed here in his investigation, he has also failed to grasp the core of truth around which his book should have been written. This compilation of facts has somehow missed the point of history. If Chris- tianity ox Christ were what enemies and critics say they were, they could never have weathered the progressive enlightenment of succeeding generations, nor could they ever have transformed the face of the earth, as they did - slowly it is true, but taking always into prudent account the innate unwillingness of men to change time- honored customs (e.g., like slavery) until absolutely obliged to do so. At any rate, it is unfair to limit one's appreciation of such a world force as Christianity to such clich√©s as: intolerant, illiberal, bigoted, political and the like, or to say that Jesus is an ordinary historical personage, and the Church a human institution (p. 111). The Church has never - must it be repeated again? - opposed true scholarship, not even when it turned its face to the comparative history of religions. She merely has insisted with great common-sense that terms be used strictly, and that reason be directed to the unravelling of facts, and not to the service of prejudicial theories. She knows as does all the world that men are strictly limited as to the modes of their religious expression. A man has a body, material possessions, hopes and aspirations, and a soul. If God is introduced into the picture, it stands to reason that man will worship Him either through various oblations and offerings, through words or songs expressive of his deepest feelings, and through bodily postures such as bowing and prostrating himself and the like. Consequently, with just a tiny bit of luck, any investigator can and will find any number of ancient parallels for modern religious beliefs and practices. It is at this point that the Church raises her voice to urge that true scientific caution be exercised, before making assertions as to the intrinsic dependence of the later practice upon the earlier one. She is unalterably opposed to a system whereby all religions, regardless of their quality, are reduced as it were to the least common denominator of quantity, where they can then be judged by the standard of "more" and "less," and where Christ can be favorably (or unfavorably) compared with Socrates or Gautama or Mohammed. Only by such quantification, only by a superficial consideration of history, only by overlooking such things as dates and, above all, values , can one say that Christianity (more specifically, the Church), is a syncretism, a streamlined mystery-religion, a development from paganism.</page><page sequence="4">448 Book Reviews Moreover, the Church knows that just as Christ cannot be judged adequately by mere historical investigation (which she encourages), neither can Christianity. She has never maintained any such position. Hence it is not enough simply to read her doctrinal formulations concerning Cnrist and the Trinity and Original Sin (this last the cause of eighteen centuries of barren dispute, p. 160), to obtain an adequate grasp of her position, for it is not only words that count, but their mean- ing or their sense, and that is something which can only be obtained by contact with Tradition and the spirit of the Faith. Although the author is familiar with the distinction between dulia and hyperdulia (p. 131, n. 97), according to which the Bl. Virgin is given a place of eminence among the saints, he writes that "the 'Annunciation' has led ... to Mary's deification as 'Mother of God' " (p. 130; cf. p. 55). He finds it "difficult enough to harmonize such views of Mary as her "virginity" and "sinlessness" with Jesus' negligent treatment of his mother (John 2:4) and with her evident ignorance of her mission." This statement is fortified with the following footnote, which is quoted as a sample of the author's critical acumen: "If we admit, following most authorities, that the canticle of praise, 'the Magnificat,' assigned to her by Luke (1 :46-55) is really that to [of?] her cousin Elizabeth, the name 'Mary' (v. 46) [was?] inserted by a later scribe" (p. 132, n. 101). From a modern scientific point of view this statement is now (the author cites Harnack [1900] and Burkitt [1906] as his authorities) wholly untenable. Only three Latin manuscripts: a (Vercellensis), b (Veronensis), 1 (Rehdigeranus), have Elizabeth as the subject of the verb "atY." But as ail the Greek manuscripts, all the Syriac, all the Coptic, and all the Latin manuscripts originating from Africa with Tertullian, have "Mary," there can hardly be any reasonable doubt that the ques- tion of "who said the Magnificat?" has been definitely settled in favor of the Blessed Virgin (Cf. Lagrange, S. Luc, p. 44f). The author holds that the virgin birth and perpetual virginity of Mary were not taught in the Church during its first three centuries (p. 130). How could they be, since there is the matter of the "brothers and sisters of the Lord?" (p. 113, 130). St. Jerome's "cousin theory" was "refuted in 1865 by J. B. Lightfoot." One wonders if the author has bothered to read Lightfoot through, fpr while the Anglican bishop's brilliant exposition of the Epiphanian solution (viz., that the "brothers and sisters of the Lord" were Joseph's children by a previous marriage) was presented in opposition to Jerome's theory, the English scholar nevertheless effectively disposed of the so-called scriptural objections to the virginity of Mary, and rejected the idea of her having other children by Joseph. Instances could easily be multiplied where the author has completely missed the subtler nuances of the Gospels, those artless, uncalculated words, phrases, or details that reveal the eye-witness. He has missed the delicacy with which the Evangelists treat of Mary's virginity; he has missed also the honesty of the Evangelists who record the very words of Jesus' contemporaries who were of course ignorant of His mysterious conception and so spoke of Him as the true son of Joseph. No later forger or fabricator would have been so naive on points like these. Unappreciated too is the great humility of St. Peter in omitting from his preaching or at least from his Gospel what might be construed as boasting. Then there is the unsuspected</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 449 depth of Christ's parables of the kingdom, which discreetly contain the "Pauline" idea that His kingdom will be universal, will comprise both good and bad until the end. Other such points might easily be missed by a superficial reader or historian. Finally, it will be admitted in theory that there are two sides to every question. The author has chosen to expound one side of the present question, and has every right to do so. Only it is objectionable to find that he has not shown even a passing acquaintance with the "other " side. His book provides a long bibliography for his views, but he seems pitifully unaware of the works of modern Catholic scholars of international repute in the field of Scripture, scholars who know both sides of the problems attending the emergence of Christianity into a pagan world, and who make out a much more reasonable case for their position than the author does for his. As it is, he is a literalist and historicist, a rationalist and liberal, and has provided the reading public with another one-sided catalogue of monotonous negation. R. T. A. Murphy, O.P.</page></plain_text>
