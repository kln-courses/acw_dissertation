<plain_text><page sequence="1">Foreign Art and Asante Aesthetics HARRY R. SILVER Anthropologists and art historians have long recognized that African art forms can be classified into reasonably distinct ethnic styles. In addition, extensive research demon- strates that they are deeply embedded in the social, political, and religious structures of the societies producing them. Many writers, in fact, see these art forms as visual embodiments of the values and principles governing indigenous life.' Given this close correlation between art and culture, an interesting question arises. How may members of one African ethnic group, steeped in the traditions of their own culture, react when confronted with the unfamiliar art of other African (and even non-African) societies? Will their exclusive backgrounds in one particular art tradition render foreign styles completely senseless to them, resulting in a random as- sortment of confused impressions? Or will viewers develop a set of coherent evaluative criteria that will guide their judg- ments of foreign art in a consistent and culturally meaningful manner? Speculating upon this topic, William Fagg unequivocally states that "the sculpture of one tribe will be meaningless and unintelligible to people of another tribe, because it is art di- vorced from its content of belief" (1965:12). Fagg bases his ar- gument upon the assumption that because of Africans' pre- dominant concern with the functions of art, they have no tra- ditional concept of art for art's sake, and this lack inhibits their ability to respond to what he calls "the universal values found in all good art" (1965:12). Fagg also goes on to say that the av- erage African's ability to appreciate the traditional art of other groups is unlikely to improve even within the more panethnic context of modernization. At the opposite pole, Robert Thompson labels as untrue any assumption that states that "Africans cannot, or are unwilling to, evaluate art. . . from outside their immediate cultural uni- verse" (1974:5). He attempts to support his point by demon- strating, through a field project involving the use of vid- eotapes, that Africans from one culture can respond enthusias- tically to the performance arts of other African groups. Thompson then uses these findings to hypothesize the exis- tence of an African sensibility that he believes may help mold aesthetic values throughout the continent. The contrasting positions offered by Fagg and Thompson do not, however, exhaust all of the modes of response available to African viewers when they evaluate art from other cultural groups. This paper, for example, suggests a third alternative, which in a sense occupies a middle ground between these poles. Through use of an original field study, I will dem- onstrate that while viewers from one African culture are capa- ble of responding consistently as a group to works from other cultures, the criteria they employ in their judgments are not based upon the existence of perceived pan-African values. In- stead, viewers may simply apply the criteria governing aesthe- tic choice in their own societies to artworks of foreign origin. Some precedent for this position already exists in the litera- ture. Crowley, for instance, indicates that Chokwe artists of Central Africa quite willingly critique the artistic capabilities of their Lunda neighbors. Furthermore, these artists go so far as to state that any objects of aesthetic merit attributed to Lunda carvers are really of Chokwe origin (1972:28). In another exam- ple, Picton reports the case of an elderly Igbira carver from Ni- geria who was asked to evaluate a mask produced by the neighboring Basa Nge. After carefully examining it, the carver suggested a series of aesthetic "improvements," which in es- sence would have transformed the piece into a typical Igbira mask (see Willett 1971:206-8). Finally, in a detailed study of aesthetics among Nigeria's Okpella people, Borgatti (1982) clearly shows that when local viewers are called upon to judge masks from other African regions, they reserve their highest ratings for those most closely resembling a set of preferred Okpella prototypes. This study, based on empirical data I collected among the Asante of Ghana, augments these intriguing accounts. Fieldwork was conducted principally in Ahwia, a town located approximately eight kilometers from the Asante capital of Kumasi. The town originally was established in the early 19th century as a carving community devoted to the production of regalia for the Asantehene and other prominent chiefs. Today over 300 townsmen continue to carve professionally, supple- menting traditional regalia commissions with a thriving busi- ness in tourist art (Silver 1981). In addition, since 1960 the town's population has increased dramatically because of an in- flux of migrants from all parts of the Asante region. Seeking modern commercial employment, they were attracted to Ahwia by the prospect of cheap housing within easy commut- ing distance of the capital. None of these new residents ever learned to carve, and, in fact, few ever expressed more than an average interest in local art and aesthetics.2 Findings here are based on the administration of a simple ranking procedure that matched two Asante works against a selection of art from other cultures, African and non-African. The test was composed of ten photographs of sculptures, taken from books I had on hand in Ghana. They are repro- duced here exactly as they appeared to test subjects. Two items were popular carvings of local Asante origin, six came from other areas of West and Central Africa, and two were from the Maori and Sepik traditions of Oceania. It was hoped that the results would help answer the question of whether viewers were able to identify a distinctive African style among objects of diverse origin and, if so, whether they judged these African objects superior to those produced outside the continent. The two locally made carvings were prime examples of con- temporary Asante tourist art, each one offering an interesting blend of modern and traditional themes. One showed an akuaba fertility figure portrayed as a modern market woman (E), while the other presented a man in traditional robes hold- ing an open book (F). Both were expertly carved in a style of "restrained naturalism" (Vogel 1979) and, in several preference tests administered earlier during research, had proved very popular with local residents.3 64</page><page sequence="2">Ds aH!

Three were full figures (C, D, I), and the remaining were masks that de- picted heads alone (A, B, G). All six were anthropomorphic, though some representations were clearly more naturalistic than others. The Oceanic carvings also were museum-quality pieces and representative examples of their respective cultural styles. Item H, a Maori anthropomorphic statue, had easily recogniz- able facial features and clearly delineated hands. Moreover, in a manner typical of Maori art, the figure was covered with elaborate incised surface patterns. Item J, a Sepik carving, combined an anthropomorphic body with a highly stylized bird's head that featured a prominent hooked beak. To obtain a set of responses representative of the entire local community, the test was administered to two groups of people in the Ahwia area: 31 village carvers (N= 31) and 36 noncarvers (N=36). Every carver tested worked as a full-time professional and, as revealed through pretest interviews, possessed a sound knowledge of local aesthetic traditions. Nonartists lacked the average carver's expertise concerning local Asante sculpture. Yet, through years of informal exposure, even they had learned to identify readily many objects that either were sold commonly to.tourists or were used prominently in major rituals. Neither group, however, displayed familiarity with any of the non-Asante art traditions represented in the test sample.4 Each person was shown the ten photos randomly arranged on a flat, well-lighted surface, and was told to rate them in order of preference.5 Subjects were encouraged to explain the rationales behind their ratings. Their comments, which were carefully recorded, enabled the researcher to determine whether low rankings given to objects indicated absolute judg- ments of inferiority, or whether they simply reflected relative preferences within a general class of items all deemed good. The following analysis will show that subjects' evaluations did indeed reveal some tendency to separate test objects into posi- tive and negative classes, a distinction that gains added sig- nificance when interpreted with reference to broader themes in the Asante conceptual system. Every sculpture was assigned a score equivalent to the rank it received on the test (e.g., an object rated first was given a score of one, a tenth-rated object a score of ten). The scores compiled for each item were averaged for each test group, and the ten mean scores were then arranged on an ordinal basis, providing a new set of rankings that reflected average preferences for each sample group. Finally, the level of rank- Non-Carvers (N=36) J Carvers (N= 31) Rank Item Mean Rank Item Mean 1 E 1.61 1 E 1.97 2 F 3.22 2 D 2.74 3 D 3.33 3 F 3.58 4 C 5.19 4 H 5.65 5 I 5.77 5 C 6.10 6 H 6.31 6 I 6.23 7 A 6.75 7 J 6.26 8 J 7.11 8 G 6.58 9 G 7.44 9 A 6.81 10 B 8.44 10 B 8.58 correlation was measured between the two populations.6 Re- sults of these procedures are summarized in the table. As the table demonstrates, the ratings offered by both groups were extremely similar. Furthermore, the reasons commonly given by members of each group to justify their rankings were also nearly identical. Both carvers and noncarvers, for example, consistently included the two local sculptures (E and F) among their top three selections. Item E, the highest-ranked piece, earned particularly wide praise for its mixture of modern and traditional elements. On one level, it was a well-carved akuaba possessing such traditionally valued features as a broad fore- head, prominent eyebrows, layered neck, and full hips. Yet it also displayed several unusual elements, including naturalistic facial features, carved waist-beads, and a hands-on-hips stance. Members of both groups described the carving as a well-rounded representation of the contemporary Asante woman-aggressive in many spheres of economic life (as evi- denced through what subjects termed her "assertive" pos- ture), but also sensitive to the traditional role of women (as re- flected in her use of waist-beads and her conformity to many established standards of physical beauty). Item F, the other figure produced in Ahwia, also earned high scores for its synthesis of traditional and modern themes, as well as for its naturalistic portrayal of the human form. Nearly all subjects interpreted the indigenous robes and rigid pos- ture as clear indications of chiefly rank. The book, however, was said to reflect the literacy and probable Christianity of the person depicted. (Many believed the book to be the Bible.) Members of both groups appreciated this combination of di- verse traits, praising the figure as a nicely carved portrait of the ideal modern leader, in short, an educated man unafraid to retain his ties with the Asante past. Item D, an Ife bronze, also appeared among each group's top three selections. Both artists and nonartists marveled at the highly naturalistic presentation of what they referred to as "a real person." They expressed particular delight with the carv- ing's detailed depiction of elaborate neckware and headgear, adornments interpreted by most viewers as probable signs of regal status. Substantial agreement between groups also emerged on the ranking of the next three objects, items C, H, and I. Each of these figures was anthropomorphic in face and body in a style again recalling Vogel's term "restrained naturalism" as well as Thompson's related concept of "mid-point mimesis," a quality found in imagery that is "not too real and not too abstract, but somewhere in between" (1974:26). In evaluating these foreign items, respondents generally focused upon specific charac- teristics that they could readily reinterpret into meaningful Asante themes. For instance, nearly everyone commented on Item C's elaborate feather headdress. Although a few people disliked it, most found it fascinating, saying that it reminded them of similar adornments worn by local priests during ceremonies. Item I received positive evaluations for two reasons. First, the two figures suggested twins to most observers, and twins hold a revered (though somewhat dangerous) position in Asante culture (Rattray 1923). Second, many subjects were at- tracted by the positioning of one of the figures' arms, interpret- ing this gesture as an indication of friendship. Some older people even claimed that a specific Twi proverb about friend- ship was being represented, though no one ever explicitly identified this adage. Reviews of the Maori figure (H) primarily focused upon its elaborate graphic designs, interpreted as scarification marks by nearly all the Ghanaians. Most respondents in both groups rs = .915 p &lt;.01 66</page><page sequence="4">liked the designs, but a few found them unattractive.7 Many people also commented on the unusual positioning of the fig- ure's hands, which they felt produced a pleasing naturalistic effect similar to that found in Item E. The four remaining test objects garnered lower rankings and increasing amounts of negative verbal criticism. Item J, the Sepik figure, received rather poor ratings primarily because of it was perceived to lack a coherent theme. At best, several people speculated that the figure represented some type of po- tentially dangerous spirit.8 The unusual beak completely mys- tified most viewers, who said they could not understand what the artist had intended. However, a few carvers did see some technical merit in the elaborate headdress, which they judged to be the product of considerable carving skill. Items A, B, and G were all masks, a genre that, for the most part, finds no traditional equivalent in Asante culture. Item A received low rankings for several reasons. Some viewers stated that the incised designs covering the top of the object's head represented an Islamic prayer cap, and, by extension, they identified the carving as the portrait of a Muslim. Typi- cally, comments reflecting Asante hostility toward local Mus- lim residents then followed.9 Other viewers focused upon the object's mouth, often remarking that the thin, protruding teeth created an unpleasant effect that suggested a skull. Furthermore, local artists assigned particularly low rankings because they judged this feature to be very poorly carved. Item G also received negative evaluations from nearly ev- eryone. In many cases, subjects complained that they simply could not understand what the object represented. Even those who did note the presence of a face condemned the piece as "fearfully" ugly because of its abstract features, especially the nose. That Item B was ranked last by both groups at first seemed somewhat surprising, since the mask's facial features were reasonably naturalistic, a trait that generally elicited favorable responses. While viewers did acknowledge this naturalism, they thought the face itself had a very frightening expres- sion, recalling an evil spirit or ghost. (The frown of the open mouth was cited in this regard.) Moreover, many carvers crit- icized the fact that the head itself was not complete since neither the ears nor scalp were represented. 10 The findings reveal impressive agreement between carvers and noncarvers both in rankings of items and in explanations of the reasons behind their judgments. If one pursues the analysis of test data, additional interpretations emerge. As the following discussion will show, the deeper meanings implicit in the local evaluations of art can only be understood by exploring the interrelations of aesthetic values with broader principles of order and control in the Asante conceptual sys- tem. The test results have demonstrated that Asante viewers favor a restrained naturalism in sculptural art. Further analysis, though, suggests that naturalism alone did not guar- antee a favorable rating; carvings also had to present images that could be interpreted in a manner consistent with popular themes in traditional or modern Asante culture. The high rankings given to local artworks (E and F) illustrate the impor- tance of these criteria, since each combined a naturalistic style with well-regarded indigenous themes. These same stylistic and thematic preferences appeared to govern Asante evalua- tions of foreign art, with no express consideration given to whether or not a piece was of African origin. The most popular foreign objects (C, D, H, I) all displayed reasonably naturalistic anatomical features, but they also bore other traits that, re- gardless of their creator's intentions, could be translated into locally comprehensible, and positively valued, referents. For instance, when viewed through Asante eyes, a foreign ob- ject's unusual headdress became the symbol of a chief or priest (C, D), incised facial designs represented ethnic (or medicinal) markings (H), and paired figures recalled proverbs about friendship (I). However, negative judgments of naturalistic carvings resulted when selected traits linked them with un- popular local cultural referents. Item A, with its "prayer cap," was perceived as Muslim, and Item B, with its threatening ex- pression, became a ghost. The remaining test data suggested that the absence (or minimization) of naturalism indeed may have helped consign foreign objects to consistently low rankings, as in the case of items G and J. Both pieces-each, no doubt, easily understood in its own culture-failed to communicate because Asante viewers could not decipher their stylized human (G) or animal (J) heads. When pressed to explain their dissatisfaction, most subjects simply replied that they could not understand what the carvings were trying to portray The unfamiliar stylistic codes interfered from the start with their efforts to uncover a locally meaningful message in the objects. Whether this prop- osition generally holds true for for the cross-cultural apprecia- tion of non-naturalistic art, though, is a question requiring a good deal more research.1" Asante viewers frequently stated that good art "portrays the world as it really is." Based on this study, a more accurate statement would assert that they evaluate art by assessing its capacity to reflect the world as the Asante see and value it. In this respect, the test findings closely parallel Vogel's descrip- tion of Baule aesthetics (1979, 1980). Like the Baule, Asante viewers interpreted specific works of art as representing phenomena that, from a local cultural perspective, either sus- tained or threatened the existing sociocultural order. For exam- ple, viewers did more than merely offer an objective identifica- tion of a sculpture as a chief, a priest, or an Asante woman. In addition, they effectively placed the object and its cultural re- ferent into a class of phenomena that we may loosely term "civilized"; in other words, a category that reflected human (i.e., Asante) ability to order the world in a productive man- ner.12 In objects earning high esteem, selected details of post- ure, expression, and costume became emblems that, at a broader conceptual level, recalled the chief's power to struc- ture social relations, the priest's manipulation of supernatural forces, and the Asante woman's capacity to perpetuate society through her fertility At the same time, unpopular objects were often interpreted as representing Muslims, ghosts, and evil spirits-precisely those phenomena lying outside the bounds of Asante civilization; dangerous phenomena that must be guarded against or controlled if society is to function smoothly. This argument clearly suggests that the act of aesthetic appreciation forces viewers, on a subconscious level at least, to reflect upon much more than art alone. As the analysis of viewers' comments revealed, Asante aesthetic tastes closely articulate with other Asante moral and social values.13 In par- ticular, when judging artworks the viewers consistently con- sidered how objects (and their referents) could be placed into broader categories representing order and disorder in the Asante universe. Consequently, foreign art was assessed in light of the objects' perceived conformity to well-established Akan values. No attempt was made to understand or even to speculate upon the functions and meanings these objects car- ried in their own cultures. In this sense, foreign art did not serve as a window through which to view the ideas and values of others; it acted, instead, as a mirror reflecting the face of Asante society itself.

This statement is based upon data obtained from a ques- tionnaire administered to noncarving residents of Ahwia. The purpose of this questionnaire was to investigate the ex- tent of noncarvers' interests in Asante art. Analysis of the resulting data revealed that, on the whole, noncarvers sel- dom bought, used, or even actively talked about art. Furthermore, while many nonartists were indeed able to recognize extremely famous (or common) Asante carvings, few could accurately interpret the deeper social and religi- ous symbolism traditionally associated with these artworks. 3. These earlier tests had matched Items E and F with a sample of 23 other contemporary tourist carvings produced in Ahwia. Using procedures similar to those described in the present paper, I administered the tests to six differ- ent groups of local artists and nonartists. Results showed that nearly all respondents included both Items E and F within their top five test selections. In addition, Items E and F each received substantial amounts of verbal praise from local viewers. (For a full description see Silver in press.) 4. Most carvers did display a very limited knowledge about several other African art styles that were not represented in the test. They were familiar both with Bambara Chi Wara figures and with selected Senufo masks, expressing an interest in these objects because they believed that Euro- pean consumers were eager to buy them. As a result, vil- lage carvers studied photographs of these sculptures and then tried to copy them, all in the hope that tourists (and even wealthy Ghanaians) would purchase these local re- productions. Interestingly, though, neither Chi Wara fig- ures nor Senufo masks are traditionally carved in a very naturalistic style; and, as the present paper would suggest, Asante artists personally expressed a low opinion of these art forms--even when evaluating their own versions of the pieces (Silver 1979). 5. Throughout the project, no one ever expressed difficulty in understanding text instructions or in interpreting photo- graphic conventions. 6. Spearman's rho was calculated to measure this level. It is, in essence, a test that measures the degree of correlation between sets of rankings offered by two populations. A re- sult of P less than .01 indicates a very strong correlation be- tween the responses of the two groups. 7. Respondents who disliked these designs often stated that scarification marks were indicative of "unsophisti- cated" religious or ethnic beliefs. 8. Several of the subjects remarked that the figure might represent Sasabonsam, a notoriously malevolent spirit who lives deep in the local forest. Folk descriptions of Sasabon- sam, however, do not generally include references to a CONTRIBUTORS ARTHUR P.
