<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEDUSA IN CANADA By Annis Pratt* Certain critical principles are essential for dealing with Canadian poetry which in the study of English literature as such are seldom raised. Unless the critic is aware of the importance of these principles, he may, in turning to Canadian poets, find himself unexpect edly incompetent, like a giraffe trying to eat off the ground. (Frye, The Bush Garden 163) in shifting my attention from an analysis of poems about Medusa by British and American writers to a study of similar Canadian poems, I have recently found myself, like Frye's gi raffe, in the peculiar position of trying to eat off the ground. I had discovered that British and American poets write about Medusa because she is an apt vehicle for their attitudes about a powerful femininity, attitudes which vary along a scale from horrified antagonism to identification. Male poets are more likely to perceive Medusa as an alien, with whom they none theless feel a disquieting complicity; while women poets, though they share the male fear of Medusa, are more apt to identify with her, whether in her victimization or outrageous power. Although there are male poets in England and Amer ica who express sympathy and women poets antipathy, I have found clear variations in their approach to the archetype based upon gender differences in both personal and cultural expe rience. Attitudes to the archetype vary according to the poet's personal signature, based upon the different childhood expe rience of the son/mother and daughter/mother; and accord ing to the cultural signature mandating the subordination of women to men, matter to mind, and body to spirit. •The author would like to thank the Government of Canada for funding to sup port this project under the Faculty and Institutional Research Program, with special thanks to Dr. Norman T. London, Academic Relations Officer of the Canadian Em bassy, Washington, D.C. 1</page><page sequence="2">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW It is this cultural signature which considers Medusa threaten ing, because she violates a world view in which men, mind, and spirituality attempt to control a perennially restless un dertow engendered by women, emotions, and the human body. Carried to an extreme, this attitude suggests that women and nature should not only be subordinated to but absorbed by men, as attributes of male consciousness rather than as entities with being in themselves. Thus Jungian theory sometimes posits "Great Mother Goddesses" or dualistically "Terrible/ Beautiful Mothers" not only as theological but also as patho logical projections of the male psyche, obstacles to be confronted, absorbed, and transcended in the process of "individuation." In literary applications of these theories, the female divinities become elements of an essentially masculine archetypal narra tive, such as the "total verbal order" which constituted Frye's sample for his 1958 Anatomy of Fiction and which was almost entirely Classical, European or American, and male (Pratt, 106-127). Where British and American poets seem influenced by the theory that neither women nor nature have any real existence without reference to the male psyche, Canadian poets see their landscape as alien from human consciousness and inaccessible to anthropomorphic subordination. Although Canadian poets also associate a terrifying femaleness with their landscapes, the sense that nature is nonhuman and insubordinate modifies their approach to feminine archetypes. One would expect that a nature so much stronger than human beings would evoke a kind of Sartrean alienation, a sense of being a tiny conscious ness lost in vast and mindless extension. Many Canadian critics posit initial hypotheses about poet and landscape in Canada suggesting such an existential stance, but, as they explore their material, these same critics create hypotheses more appropriate to an untraditional, non-European attitude toward the en vironment.</page><page sequence="3">MEDUSA IN CANADA Even Northrop Frye, who devotes so much of his analysis of traditional literatures to the theory that the primary source of poems is other poems, suggests that Canadian poetry is not determined as much by other poetry as by the obdurate Ca nadian landscape: "it is not a nation," he now insists, "but an environment that makes an impact on poets, and poetry can deal only with the imaginative aspect of that environment." Where in "older countries" human beings and nature have adjusted to "some kind of imaginative harmony," for Cana dians "the land of the Rockies and the Precambrian Shield" creates a "profoundly unhumanized isolation" (Bush Garden 164). In his writiings about Classical, British and European liter atures, Frye assumes that culture is both different from and dominant over nature, but in his analyses of Canadian liter ature he describes nature as the determinant of culture. In essays written between 1943 and 1958 Frye, like a number of Canadian critics, describes the nineteenth century Canadian writer's attitude towards nature as one of terror before an ab solutely alien otherness. He characterizes more recent poetry also as dominated by "themes of desolation and loneliness, and more particularly of the indifference of nature to human values, which I should say was the central Canadian tragic theme" (Bush Garden 171). Convinced here that literature is entirely derived from other literature, Frye notices the dis junction of Canadian poetry from its literary antecedents: "The imaginative content of Canadian poetry, which is often primitive, frequently makes extraordinary demands on forms derived from romantic or later traditions." At this point Frye finds the Canadian poet so alienated from European "culture" and working in an environment so entirely "primitive" that attempts to use such traditional conventions as the pastoral and the Wordsworthian romantic emerge as mere "erudite paro dies" (Bush Garden 174). By the 1970s, however, when Canadian poetry was burgeon ing in all sorts of new directions, Frye's critical principles in 3</page><page sequence="4">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW elude a recognition of nature as less of a container for pro jected human attributes (analogous to the unconscious or re pressed elements of the personality) than endowed with non human being in its own right and no longer subordinate to what he terms the "Cartesian ego" ("Haunted" 26-7). "Na ture, though still full of awfulness and mystery," has become "the visible representative Cartesian egocentric consciousness" of an order that man has violated, a spiritual unity that the intellect murders to dissect." "Everything that is central to Canadian writing," Frye now asserts, "seems to be marked by the immanence of the natural world" ("Conclusion" 357-8). Deploring the Christian conviction that "the gods that had been discovered in nature were all devils," from which "it fol lowed that a natural religion like that of the Indians simply had to be extirpated if the Indians were to realize their hu man potential," Frye tells an anecdote about a doctor and an Eskimo lost in the Arctic tundra: "What with the cold, the storm, and the loneliness, the doctor panicked and began shout ing 'we are lost.' The Eskimo looked at him thoughfully and said 'we are not lost, we are here.' A vast gulf," Frye concludes, "between an indigenous and an immigrant mentality opened at that point: the possibility of eventually closing that gulf is the main theme of what follows" ("Haunted" 26-7). Given his conviction that Canadian poetry is becoming re sponsive both to guilt over what had been done to the In dians and to a fresh grasp of the values of "natural religion," what follows, in Frye's 1977 essay "Haunted by Lack of Ghosts" is his construction of a rebirth pattern markedly different from the one he had postulated as typical of the "total verbal order" which had informed his 1958 Anatomy of Criticism. In the traditional rebirth quest the hero starts out in a culturally determined "green world" which is a pastoral or an Edenic setting, and moves through adventures of combat with natural and (often) female monsters towards a denouement in which society reaffirms its norms. Although Frye notes a tension be tween the hero's rebellious desire for freedom and society's</page><page sequence="5">MEDUSA IN CANADA concerns, the outcome is his accommodation to culture. The hero's excursion is understood, moreover, as an inward one, his adventures into his own unconscious rather than over a real natural landscape, the quest conforming to such traditional religious paradigms as rituals and sacraments. Nature, in this pattern, is an entirely subordinate vehicle, a realm to be over come in transcendence of matter. When Frye describes the Canadian rebirth journey in es says written during the 1970s, nature and culture remain sep arate but nature is no longer a building brick of society. Rath er, it has become a primary force in its own right, a force which the hero must accommodate. "A poetic consciousness formed within the leviathan of Canadian nature," writes Frye, "feeling that it belongs there and can no longer think of it self as a swallowed outsider, would naturally be preoccupied with two themes in particular: the theme of descent into the self [earlier Frye] and the theme of forming, within that self, an imaginative counterpart of what is outside it" ("Haunted" 41). Frye contrasts the Jonah-punished-by-being-swallowed-by the-whale trope, in which Leviathan embodies all that He brews most feared in nature, to the Canadian vision of a hero who succeeds in his quest journey only insofar as he is willing to come to terms with the whaleness of the whale, the essence of the natural world. Frye is by no means alone among Ca nadian critics in these observations: W. H. New, for exam ple, notes critics' frequent suggestions that "the land becomes a stronger presence than the human figures in Canadian fic tion, a character in its own right, an actor as well as an acti vating power in the psychological and metaphysical dramas being unveiled." Poets must abandon traditional subjective biases in dealing with such a nature, taking on an "empirical realism" which subverts normal "modes of structuring points of view (xii, xxi). Warren Tallman, similarly, in "Wolf in the Snow," describes Canadian writers leaving European myth ologies behind to reinvest "Old Mother North America" with her indigenous divinities (253). In their introduction to Mark</page><page sequence="6">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW ed by the Wild, An Anthology of Literature Shaped by the Ca nadian Wilderness, Bruce Littlejohn and John Pearce cite a number of Canadian critics on the importance of nature to Canadian literature, asserting that "If there is one distinguish ing element that sets Canadian literature apart from most other national literatures, it is the influence of the wild" (11). Ex actly what this influence consists of is the subject of Gaile McGregor's The Wacousta Syndrome, Explorations in the Ca nadian Landscape. McGregor distinguishes between imported American attitudes about the usefulness and amenability of the wild and Canadian convictions that nature is entirely non human and hostile. Her analysis of Canadian texts reveals a disruption of attitude and plot deriving from partial assimi lation of American points of view in conflict with Canadian ones. Nonetheless, McGregor insists that Canadian literature can be distinguished from American and European literature by its entirely different attitude towards nature. II A national literature in which nature rather than culture takes the foreground is likely to contain archetypes quite different from traditional ones. Canadian nature's resistance to anthro pomorphism can be exemplified by contrasting the use of landscape in New England Medusa poems to the Canadian poems which form the sample for this chapter. In Robert Lowell, May Sarton, and Sylvia Plath the specifically named Medusa figure embodies poets' powerful emotions — horrified complicity (Lowell), rage (Sarton) and terror of being fused with one's mother (Plath). The seascape, correspondingly, along with other traditional Medusean motifs such as snakes, oce anic rocks, and fatally seductive eyes, provides extended meta phors and metaphysical symbols expressing these psychological themes. In Canadian poetry, an unnamed Medusa is more likely to be merged into the landscape, background becoming fore</page><page sequence="7">MEDUSA IN CANADA ground as primary attractant, a kind of mesmerizing but not necessarily human outcrop. Whereas in a British or American poem about Medusa rocks might be vehicles for the theme, in Canadian poetry they are more apt to be the primary focus. Thus D. G. Jones begins "For Eve" with what looks like back ground — "The sound of the waves, washing,/Washing, wash ing in on the stones" but in the second stanza he focusses on "the one stone, emerging/Wet in the sunlight." Only in Can ada, it seems to me, does the poet compliment his love by liken ing her to rocks: "I love you for the fear in your eyes/And your beauty like a generous stone/Washing away, in sleep, in the sun" ("For Eve" 20-1). Nature leaping into the foreground as actor can also be seen in a poem like Earle Birney's "No vember Walk Near False Creek Mouth," where the dialogue of rock and sea is dominant over human voices, the "sculptor sea," which "repeats what it said/to the first unthinking frogs/ and the green wounds of the granite stones" relegating mere human contributions to the background (20, 22). Although E. J. Pratt's presentation of the Precambrian Shield as a kind of petrified Grendel's dam in Towards the Last Spike is most often proposed as a prototype of Canadian atti tudes to nature (with Margaret Atwood, for example, describ ing this creature as a " 'thing' not exactly human but at least a female, a sort of reptile made of rock." Survival 200), it seems to me that Pratt's archetype, like that of New England poets, is more anthropomorphic than many rock/female sym bols in Canadian literature. More typically, the rockbound Canadian Medusa is far less humanized, less likely to contain the projected fears of human beings than to represent a strictly impersonal power. In American and British poetry the land scape around Medusa expresses her power, the details of set ting her effects. This difference between Canadian and other landscape imageries has led me to extend my sample of poems about Medusa beyond those very few which name the arche type specifically to the many in which the poet approaches a</page><page sequence="8">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW rocky landscape which sometimes (but not always) has femin ine features. Canadian poems do not all differ from British and Ameri can ones to the same degree: poets approach rocks or stone/ women (or even stone/men) with attitudes varying on a scale from hostility through complicity to attempts at identifica tion; from hatred to awe and respect. Some poets adopt more European and Jungian approaches than others, personifying the Medusa and projecting emotions upon her; at the other end of the scale, a significant number of poets approach the rocky archetype in a manner similar to the Native peoples. Since the Canadian landscape dwarfs both male and female poets with such nonhuman power, one would expect them to respond in a more comparable manner than British and Ameri can ones, necessitating careful attention to the relative roles of culture and gender in comparing poems by Canadian men and women. Among Canadian male poets we find the closest analogues to the reviled Medusa of classical mythology. In St. John Sim mons' "The Dreamers," for example, the poet, like Perseus, murders a Medusa-like woman in order to usurp her powers. The speaker appropriates the generative powers of the woman he hates: he bleeds, endures contractions and gives birth, as sociating placenta and umbilicus ("a blue snake/tangled in the trees, wrapped around rock") with himself, and rock and stone with the woman: My woman with eyes of black stone throwing back at me the dulled vision of meadows. Here, as in many British and American poems by men, the landscape absorbs Medusa's effect, while the poet assimilates her vitality by killing her and appropriating her attributes to himself. Although Simmons' attitude to the "terrible mother" 8</page><page sequence="9">MEDUSA IN CANADA clearly depends upon traditional attitudes to the Medusa arche type described by Jung and Neumann, making him closer to an American poet like Joel Oppenheimer than to many of his Canadian counterparts, there is something about his use of stone imagery that makes his archetype more than merely pro jective. Her "eyes of black stone" and "mica soul," her bones "like grotesque pebbles" conform, on the one hand, to the use of Medusa's effect as setting; we shall see, however, how Simmons' poems conform with a peculiarly Canadian use of rock imagery, specifically in his suggestion that the female's power resides in her affinity to stone. We can perceive this af finity in another of his poems, "The Invention of Mythical Beasts," where the rewards for killing a woman are animals "clear and cold as quartz" and elements which are a "sea of obsidian eyes" enabling the poet to repeat their import "in stone." "Argillite fish" and "slate spiders," similarly, are prizes Simmons wins after killing a Medusa-like female archetype (36-7). Perseus, it will be remembered, earned not only Me dusa's head as his reward for her murder: he was also given the horse Pegasus, born out of her severed neck, which gave him the power of poetic composition. Other male poets whose attitude is less hostile than Sim mons' make the same association between Medusa's allure and her ability not only to petrify all around her but to endure as an object of petrification, frozen into stone in a kind of Keats ian immortality. Thus in one of the very few poems which I have found constructed specifically upon the classical Medusa myth, Daryl Hines' "Tableau Vivant," the poet is sympathetic to Medusa's entrapment in her own effect, having always to dream of petrified forests, Monumental dryads, stone leaves, stone limbs, Or of the mate that she will never meet Who will look into her eyes and live. (65)</page><page sequence="10">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Like a number of British and American male poets, Hines is compassionate for the loneliness of turning everyone looked at into stone. The way that the rock imagery embodies a power which is simultaneously female and nonhuman strikes me, however, as specifically Canadian; the focus on her "agate gaze" suggesting as much fascination with the agate as with the traditionally seductive/destructive eyes. I do not mean to imply that there are no traces of the usual attitudes towards the classical Medusa in this or in other Ca nadian poems: there are nineteenth century poets, like Charles Heavysege in "Sonnet Sequence from Jephthah's Daughter," who alludes to fate as "Gorgon-visaged, dire necessity" (6); and Richard Outram, who assumes Medusa's persona in "Tat tooed Lady" where, after the manner of the terrible/beautiful woman archetype, she lures a lover to a "stone-blind" inter course (194). Far more typical of Canadian poetry, I would nonetheless argue, is A. J. M. Smith's "A Narrow Squeak," where the sorry plight of Keats' hero of "La Belle Dame Sans Merci" becomes transformational because the speaker is turned to stone: "stone my heart, it stopped my breath/I dropped like stone, I dropped down dead." The victim, unlike Keats' wan and deathly knight, revives in a much improved condition, no longer fading under the aegis of the "bloodshot moon" of the first stanza, but reborn through petrifaction into "Bright day, green grass, soft air, warm love" (48). Barbara Godard has noticed that "in A. J. M. Smith's poetry, stones are frequent images, 'The Lonely Land' and all his other northern poems are stone poems; his other poetry is filled with images of jewelry. They are directly related to the creation of beautiful artifacts, by implication the poem." (Letter to the author, November 6, 1985). Many of the stones which appear in the imagery of Ca nadian poetry are also jewels — as in the case of agate and ob sidian — and the poet is perceived as questing not only for Medusa-turned-to-stone but for Medusa-as-jewel/artifact. How ever, Medusa's role as the agent of transformation of people and nature into stone also enters into these quests, so that her 10</page><page sequence="11">MEDUSA IN CANADA alchemical power to transform dross into jeweled artifact be comes one of her alluring and, in some cases, usurpable at tributes. George Bowering's elegy for his father, "Desert Elm," pro vides an interesting variation on the woman poet's association of her mother with Medusa. Although Medusa is not named, stone moves into the foreground so that Bowering endows his father with the qualities of stone more than the stone with the qualities of the father. At his father's death the poet "Thought of a rock, not quite round, be/ginning to crack," and consid ers "The earth he made me on," "all rocks 8c all round rocks, all stones/rolled together," an earth which "is not brown but grey, grey of/stories, the flat stones round to the eye/looking straight down." Where in classical Medusa poems the poet must avoid looking into Medusa's eyes lest he be turned into stone, Bowering absorbs the power of his father's land by "Staring straight into his eyes." Thus in the last stanza the dead father, the father's eyes, the poet's daughter's eyes and Canadian stones are all linked together as the forces which survive death: [In the ocean light of the ward his eyes are barely blue 8c deep in his head like my daughter's. He woke again to see me smiling at him, his head straight in the pillow, a rock nearly round. In the desert the rocks simply lie upon each other on the ground, a tree is overturned out of the ground, its shallow widespread roots coiled around small rocks. By these fruits we measure our weight 8c days. (379-384)] The stones are not merely symbols of the father's eyes or the family's land but represent being in their own right, their natural experience approximating but not subordinate to the human experience, rock and dying father given equal gravity in the poet's imagination. Even when Canadian male poets be gin with apparently traditional Medusa archetypes, something 11</page><page sequence="12">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW in their situation is likely to bring the rocks into the foreground as a transformational power. Thus Ralph Gustafson's "Carta Canadensis" begins with a traditionally gynophobic association of a rocky landscape with a terrifying female. He describes the approach to Canada at the St. Lawrence as "dentelle, indented," a "rock eternal with loneliness" but threatening in a nasty va gina dentata kind of way: the "great Shield clamped/On the place of love" (72). In "At Moraine Lake," however, having proclaimed Canada "a country without myths/We need none," he begins to parody traditional attitudes by ironical juxtaposi tion to Canadian realities: The plumbing in the kitchen Shakes the roof, my love cooks beans — Almost I could get what I drive at down To beans but stick at hoodwink, ketchup Being bloody Oedipus. We'll go To bed later and be our ghosts And pull the gravel over. Being Is instructive. (80) Although the montage of classical and Canadian elements re sembles the mock-classical manner of Eliot, Gustafson tran scends the ironic voice by refusing to despair over the distance between the Canadian and Greek landscapes. Rather, he re solves to pull the gravel over him as an uncomfortable and deathly but distinctly indigenous coverlet. By the end of his "Rocky Mountain Poems," nasty femininity as an aspect of the setting has receded entirely: he appreciates the essence of the rocks in "On the Yukon Run", with "a golden empire of mountains." In the final sonnet he asserts that "In Europe, you can't move without going down into history" while "Here, all is a beginning": Green hangings and great grandeur, over the north Going to what no man can hold hard in mind, The dredge of that gravity, being without experience. (72-89) 12</page><page sequence="13">MEDUSA IN CANADA The "gravity" Gustafson appreciates in nature differs from the anthropomorphosed female body parts in "Carta Canaden sis," expressing his shift from the conflation of dangerous na ture with perilous femininity to an understanding of nature as both unfeminine and nonhuman. Even in the most gynophobic images of rock/women in Canadian male poetry, poets recog nize that the power of the rocks consists in disassociation from human qualities. This does not necessarily mean that Gustaf son's "dredge of gravity" and "being without experience" lead to the existential alienation of human consciousness from a vast uncaring nature: as I shall suggest later, many Canadian poets are more likely to perceive nature as amenable to the needs of human beings if approached in its own terms. Ill Given the impact of the landscape and attitudes towards it on traditional archetypal patterns, will Canadian poetry display less difference along gender lines than British and American? If the attitude towards nature differs in the ways I have sug gested, one might expect that poems by men and women would be more similar to each other than elsewhere. There are, for example, a good number of poems in which the "stone woman" archetype of the male poets merely undergoes inver sion, the woman poet approaching a stone — (or ice- or snow ) man who guards a desired treasure. Thus in "Summer Land scape: Jasper" Dorothy Livesay describes mountains as "cold husbands" whose impotence renders them "remote as brother hoods/bereft of women" (25); and Margaret Atwood, in "River," approaches an "Ice/Man" the way Perseus approaches Medusa, to go "rigid in your sad/mirror while I look" (25). P. K. Page describes a woman's loss of her lover in terms of his petrifaction: "Now he is mineral to her" . . . "Mineral his going and his having gone" so that, at the end, "Nothing's real but mineral: cold touch, sharp taste of it/lodged forever in her routed house" (193). These inversions of the Pygmalion/ 13</page><page sequence="14">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Galatea legend are not always perceived as negative by women poets: thus Miriam Waddington, in "Love Poem," enjoys the transformation of her lover into "a marbled palace /of many rooms" which results from their passion, her "kissing your body/making it white as stone" (150) being a not infrequent outcome in Canadian love poetry. Waddington's transformation of her lover into stone parallels Simmons' activities: making the lover into a stone object sug gests a pattern of sexual exploitation which also characterizes Michael Ondaatje's "Women like You," where "stone mer maids" with "stone hearts" which were once carved by men are approached by the frustrated male poet who resents their preference for rock lovers. "They answer to no one/take the hard rock/as lover" (284-5). What is remarkable in this activ ity is not so much the similarity between poets of different genders as their common assumption that lovemaking results in petrifaction and that petrified lovers (or even just plain rocks) are sometimes preferable to lovers in the flesh. Women poets also like to escape from male lovers to nature — Susan Musgrave avoids a human lover in "Songs of the Sea Witch" by wrapping herself in "the coin of snake skin" of a masculine Lamia or snake god, retreating "cold in the slime of the/snake-seraph with his head dress/and fangs" (35-6). Al though Musgrave's reptile might seem analogous to Pratt's female monster, gender creates an important difference in that Musgrave retreats from a human lover to the snake, having already identified herself with the "Sea-Witch," a female na ture power. To Pratt, in contrast, the stone female remains intractably other, feared by the men who drive spikes into her flesh in order to probe minerals. Women poets sometimes approach stone females as "terrible" or "good" mothers after the manner described by Jung and Neumann. Thus Musgrave uses "terrible mother" imagery in "One-Sided Woman" ("Between her leg is/the slash of an/un derworld" and her breasts "hung like greed") while recogniz ing the frightening female as her mother: "the person inside 14</page><page sequence="15">MEDUSA IN CANADA her/is beating the walls—/knocking on stone" (17-21). Like Medusa, the "One-sided woman" is fatal to men ("Each man drank/in her name . . . her eyes like stones/that water/could not reach"). For women, however, the petrified woman is a vehicle for rebirth. Musgrave's conflation of womb and stone enclosure is a typical Canadian coupled image, similes between flesh and rock being so common that poets seem to assume the readers' unsurprised acceptance of them. Thus Atwood expects the reader will not find linkage of stones and flesh unbelieva ble when in "Black Stone Mother God" she approaches a rock/ mother archetype as something "you like, want/to be like" (90); similarly, Gwladys Downes, in "The Return," when she makes a "bargain with the goddess" to "drink stone/eat silence . . . and she/would give me air" [97]), takes it for granted that imbibing stone is desirable. Female poets seem at ease with the idea that wombs have stone walls and that stone is an empowering elixir, but both genders put as much emphasis upon relating to rocks as to the opposite sex. Even in apparently traditional classical allusions like Daryl Hines' and A. J. M. Smith's the fascination of stone occupies male poets; thus we find Robert Kroetsch likening a woman's "face when she came" to "the Medusa in her snaky hair, stone writhing" (166) because for him, as for so many other Canadian writers, Medusa is made of stone as well as capable of turning people to stone, and, however terrifying, her petrifaction is perceived as a powerful attribute. Stones play a similarly unique role in poems about lovemak ing and about the quest for inspiration, with stone imagery often used either to describe a paradoxically petrified and po tent intercourse or figuring as linguistically inspiring elixirs. It seems that poets' peculiar relationship to the Canadian land scape leads them to write poems in which stone women and stone men make weirdly satisfying love as a matter of course, and in which poetic inspiration consists of speaking in a fresh, pebbly idiom. I am not acquainted with any other national literature in 15</page><page sequence="16">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW which one is unsurprised to come upon one lover announcing to another that "we'll go/to bed later and be our ghosts/and pull the gravel over" (Gustafson above, p. 6); or to find a woman poet saying By the turn of the week I was madly in love with stone. Do you know how beautiful it is to embrace stone to curve all your body against its surfaces (Pat Lowther, "A Stone Diary" 9) The idea of stones having intercourse with each other is not entirely unique to Canadian literature: Isak Dinesen recounts, for example, a Danish story about "big stones at the bottom of the sea which came on land upon full-moon nights, shining wet, hung with sea-thong and mussels; they ran a race, and copulated, on the shore" (241). What is striking about stone imagery in Canadian love poetry is the assumption that being like or turning into stone is a happy byproduct of intercourse. We have seen how, in "Women Like You," Ondaatje resents women's affinity to rock, and how many women poets flee from male to stone lovers or just to stones. Susan Musgrave's "The Sea-Witch" follows a progression from humanized to non human nature, as her affair moves from dreaming about stone, to both lovers becoming stone, to the poet transcending the relationship with her own stoniness intact. Although in "One Sided Woman" Musgrave remains ambivalent about feminine promiscuity, fearing a terrifying woman with "eyes like stones/ that water/could not reach" (21), she aspires nonetheless to the solid, stonelike quality of the archetypal figure. Like Mus grave, Phyllis Webb both dreads and admires the Keatsian stasis of rock. In "A Tall Tale" a "seagirl and a whale make eternally arrested love in an underwater cave. Two hundred years of intercourse have metamorphosed them into "brutal 16</page><page sequence="17">MEDUSA IN CANADA artifacts of stone/polished/petrified prisoners of their layer," but the lovers, through a combination of sexual longevity and petrifaction, have achieved apotheosis as "stone gods/Stone lust, stone grief," illustrating the "moral" that although "lov ing flesh will quickly demise" it can "secrete a skillful shell and stone and perfect be" (155-6). Where in the traditional Medusa myth the hero avoids be ing turned to stone, and where in British and American poems about Medusa poets fear that she will turn them to stone, in these Canadian poems being turned to stone is both an in trinsic quality of Medusa herself and an elixir for successfully approaching her. I do not mean to suggest that any of these stone/flesh images should be taken with entire seriousness, but their ubiquity in Canadian literature, even as flights of meta physical wit, suggests an interesting application of Frye's theory about the impact of the environment upon the Canadian imagination. Dorothy Livesay's "On Looking into Henry Moore" is less of a tourist piece than, like "A Tall Tale," a poem about petri faction. Looking "into" the holes of the Moore sculpture, the poet prays that the sun "stun me, sustain me/Turn me to stone," desiring the statue's "Passivity in fire/and fire in stone." Her transformation requires an androgynous, Jungian balance between "Female and male" so that she can "rise alone" as a reborn personality. The diction, however, is Canadian stone in the metaphorical mode, her goal to be "One unit, as a tree or stone/Woman in man, and man in womb" (517-18). In "Fortunes" Miriam Waddington chooses stone as a means of transcending a confusion of identities ("North American/Jew ish, Russian, and rootless in all four") by going out "to cry my anger to the stone-blind fields" which tell her who she is " (yes-this-is-me, this is no-one else"). Through immersion in the Canadian landscape, Waddington is changed from lost ex ile into indigenous Canadian: "no longer a bewildered prin cess, /but a wonderful living statue of marble stone" (120-1). Waddington accepts herself as a Galatea, but her Pygmalion 17</page><page sequence="18">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW is no human sculptor; rather she achieves rebirth under the aegis of the rocky Canadian landscape. Poets' association of stone with sexuality and rebirth seems related to the idea that by assimilating stone a poet can be lin guistically inspired. Undoubtedly because of her concern with attitudes towards the Canadian landscape in her critical writ ings, Atwood's poetry provides some interesting examples both of metaphoric and metamorphic use of stone imagery. In two poems about pioneering she contrasts early settlers' feelings of alienation from the land, taking a male persona in one and a female point of view in the other. In "Progressive Insanities of a Pioneer" Atwood's male character goes mad resisting the landscape: "disgusted/with the swamp's clamourings and the outbursts/of rocks," he is unable to hear the language of his new environment. Canadian nature turns his assumptions topsy turvy: "his foot sink[s]/down through stone" rupturing his preconception that "The land is solid." Most importantly, na ture is doing the talking, its "clamours" and "outbursts" hav ing nothing to do with human language, "Things/refused to name themselves, refused/to let him name them" (39). At wood is probably satirizing what Frye terms the "Cartesian egocentric consciousness" (Haunted 26-7), the assumption that human ideas have more reality than nature and that nature comes into existence only when named by human beings. In her sequence based on Susanna Moodie's Roughing It in the Bush (in Upper Canada of the 1830s) Atwood depicts a woman who gradually abandons European preconceptions to adjust to Canadian nature on its own terms. In "Resurrection" Susanna recognizes that the dormant stones lie folding their holy fire around me (but the land shifts with frost and those who have become the stone voices of the land shift also and say god is not 18</page><page sequence="19">MEDUSA IN CANADA the voice in the whirlwind god is the whirlwind at the last judgment we will all be trees). (58-9) Susanna realizes that divinity does not use matter as a vehicle for expressing transcendence over it; rather, divinity is im manent within matter and people must be metamorphosed into rocks and trees in order to be in harmony with it. In Atwood's poetry, vehicle and tenor, image and import exchange places, with rocks sometimes standing for human ex periences and human experiences as often representing rocky qualities. Although she sometimes uses stones as metaphysical conceits (as, for example, in "After the Flood, we," where peb bles seem to be metaphors for sperm, 12) they are just as likely to speak for themselves. In her sequence "Some Objects of Wood and Stone" words are similes for stones: the characters gather "coloured pebbles" which "enclosed what they intended/ to mean in shapes/as random and necessary as the shapes of words." Although at first glance the stones seem containers of human sentiments, it becomes clear that the rocks are speak ing their own language, which resembles the shapes of human words. By holding pebbles in their hands the human speakers acquire a fresh, polished diction: [the sounds of our voices fell into the air single and solid and rounded and really there and then dulled, and then like sounds gone, a fistful of gathered pebbles there was no point in taking home. (61)] A poetical dialectic has resulted from an equal interchange of human and of stone being, the synthesis being a "flight of words" as much in the language of rocks as of human beings, 19</page><page sequence="20">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW analogous to the interchange lovers achieve by turning each other into stone during intercourse. IV Like so many other Canadian poets, Atwood shifts within a single poem or sequence from a vision of nature as empty of meaning to an affirmation of the intrinsic being of matter. Thus in "Totems," the first poem in "Some Objects of Wood and Stone," she perceives native symbols as masks empty of import; but in "Carved Animals," the final poem, the text is structured upon totemistic concepts, an exchange of human and stone which takes place when Natives carve animals and their hands bend to hold the shape shape themselves, grow cold with the stone's cold, grow also animal, exchange until the skin wonders if stone is human ... (62) The empowering interchange between human and animal be ing, like the poetical inspiration arising from poets and stones speaking to each other, each in their own language, represents animistic religious assumptions that are markedly different from the Judeo-Christian attitudes towards nature. Atwood's approximation of Native religious attitudes is typical of many Canadian poets who (as Frye, Tallman, and other Canadian critics have noted) develop a nonwestern approach to nature through assimilating indigenous belief systems. Although the whole question of non-Native Canadian poets' use of Native metaphysics is too vast to explore here, the way poets approach stones, as well as their quests for stone/women and their modi fication of the classical Medusa archetype, can be clarified by reference to indigenous theologies. As Paul Radin notes, ". . . the Indian does not make the separation into personal as contrasted with impersonal, corpo 20</page><page sequence="21">MEDUSA IN CANADA real with impersonal, in our sense at all" (141). After quoting Radin at the beginning of an essay on "Ojibwa Ontology, Be havior, and World View," A. Irving Hallowell goes on to dem onstrate how Ojibwa metaphysics extends categories of being to include both human beings and natural objects: when a natural object is important in an Ojibway ceremony, he sug gests, it is no longer perceived as inanimate to the extent that "what we view as material, inanimate objects — such as shells and stones — are placed in an animate category along with per sons." Within these animate categories the natural objects cease to "be linguistically categorized as inanimate," becoming "rei fied person-objects which are other than human but have the same ontological status" (147). Although Hallowell reasons that "Ojibway are not animists in the sense that they dogmatically attribute living souls to inanimate objects such as stones," spe cial stones speak to shamans or walk about fulfilling their own purposes. Canadian poems about such "special" stones are widespread in both Native and non-Native literature — Robert Kroetsch's "Stone Hammer Poem" (238-242), Susan Musgrave's "Dread Song" (47), and Victor Coleman's "Fish:Stone:Song" (69-70) providing examples of the latter. The particular kinds of ani mation accorded to stones in the sample I have surveyed in this chapter — the quality of femininity or motherhood, for exam ple, and of poetic inspiration — can also be found in Native at titudes towards rock. With regard to rocks as sources of in spiration, Basin Johnson recounts an Anishabeg story about this people's excessive love for "small stones, the size of plum pits and of brilliant hues of white, crimson, green, blue, yel low, amber, azure" which were created especially for them by Kitche Manitou (166). There are, of course, as many ways of approaching rock as there are indigenous Native theologies: In his "Old Man, The Sweat Lodge," Nez Perce poet Phillip William George asso ciates the steaming stones which focus the healing powers of the sweat lodge with presences in, "the womb of our mother, 21</page><page sequence="22">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Earth," the lodge, in which "These burning stones are/The coming of new life" (42-3). Anne Cameron, for example, in a chapter on stones in Daughters of Copper Women, details the way certain tribes of Coastal British Columbia used spe cial marking stones to measure solar and astronomical phenom ena, and returned to specially constructed stone circles in order to reach the powers from which they felt themselves to have originally derived (99-106). At this juncture, the importance of briefly touching upon these few Native theological assump tions is to place the poems I have studied in a context which makes their marked deviation from western European concepts about nature much clearer. Thus, for a final example, Pat Lowther's "A Stone Diary" provides perhaps the most detailed description of a Canadian woman poet empowering herself through rocks. The poem ceases to seem like a freak approach to nature when consid ered not only in the context of rock imagery in other Canadian poems but also of indigenous animism. Like Atwood, Lowther describes a progression from the Western European view of nature as alien to an assimilation of its nature's attributes for a transformation. After a week spent "madly in love/with stone" Lowther begins to experience metamorphosis: Today for the first time I noticed how coarse My skin had grown But the stones shine With their own light, They grow smoother And smoother Although, in "Notes From Furry Creek" (9), she acknowledges the distinction between human flesh and the essence of stone, she transforms herself by identification: reaching the centre you become 22</page><page sequence="23">MEDUSA IN CANADA stone, the perpetual laved god. (367) Lowther engages with an (implicitly male) stone god, under going the same kind of androgynous and alchemical transfor mation as Livesay on "On Looking into Henry Moore" and Waddington in "Fortunes." Her quest is to abandon human personality and plunge into total identification with rock, en during a break down in order to break through to rebirth: [The mountains reject nothing But can crack Open your mind Just by being intractably there ("Coast Range" 367).] Lowther is not talking about the kind of cracking up that frantic settlers experience when "bushed" or driven mad by the alien Canadian landscape; she enters, rather, into the "dredge of gravity" that is Canadian nature to its poets. This merging with stones is neither exploitative nor anthropomor phic: rocks remain rocks and women women, the interchange dependent, after the animistic manner, upon each approaching the other from distinct realms of being. V Few recent Canadian poets project psychic attributes onto the environment in the manner of Jung and Neumann; rather, they abandon the anthropomorphic along with pastoral, ro mantic and existential approaches to nature. Canadian poetry embodies a transition from regret for the European culture left behind to affirmation of the Canadian landscape, and a corollary shift from traditional western European smugness about the superiority of mind over matter towards a more cau tious appreciation of nature's intrinsic essence. In surveying the Canadian criticism which assesses these attitudes I have 23</page><page sequence="24">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW noticed that although many critics start out by setting forth hypotheses appropriate to traditional models, their theories about human beings and nature eventually undergo a shift. Thus Warren Tallman's much anthologized essay, "Wolf in the Snow," begins with his characterization of the Canadian hero as alienated in a mindless nature, but ends by acknowl edging that Canadian literature is primarily inspired by "old mother North America with her snow hair, her mountain fore head, her prairie eyes, and her wolf teeth, her wind song and her vague head of old Indian memories." The task of the Ca nadian writer, Tallman concludes, is to repossess the land scape on its own terms: "For when the house is repossessed the Gods come back — snow gods, dust gods, wind gods, wolf gods — but life gods too. And life is the value" (253). Laurence Ricou, similarly, begins Vertical Man/Horizontal World by describing "man on the prairie, as portrayed in Ca nadian fiction, [as] defined especially by two things: expanse, and an awareness of the surrounding emptiness." Ricou asso ciates the "emptiness of the prairie" with existentialist concep tions of human consciousness isolated amid a vast néant, the prairie mirroring "the emptiness of 20th century life." In the course of analyzing his sample of Canadian literature, Ri cou, like Tallman, shifts his ground in defining Canadians' "bond to the land, unarticulated, emotional, even spiritual," their entering of the "actual house of Canada" which depends upon their understanding of its "vague head of old Indian memories" (ix, 7). The actual house of Canada is not an in terior but an entire landscape, the Indian memories of a man ner of approaching nature which differ markedly from tradi tional western European metaphysics and theology. Thus Frye's young hero of romance behaves in a significantly different manner from the Canadian counterpart. In Anatomy, as I have noted, an (implicitly male) hero wrestles with an alien realm where nature, the unconscious, and the feminine are conflated. The outcome is both internal and cultural, an apoth eosis of the hero won by his overcoming and, sometimes, ab 24</page><page sequence="25">MEDUSA IN CANADA sorbing, the contrary forces of his own personality. In the new Canadian archetype the hero, who can be either male or fe male, approaches nature, his or her success determined by the development of a harmonious balance between the human being and the natural universe. In his analysis of James Reaney's "The Heart and the Sun," Frye describes this process as an encounter with "something casual and expected in nature [which] goes through a vortex or gyre into the mind, and cre ates there a riddle of experience which cannot be assimilated to any set of human or social values. Like the gods of polythe ism, it is neither good nor evil, but may be either or both" ("National Consciousness" 53). "Good and evil" belong to traditional attitudes about the enmity between spirit and mat ter, the rejection of the human and the world's body by the Christian attempt to free the soul from their toils. Frye's Ca nadian rebirth journey has far greater affinities to pagan the ologies which characterize pre-Biblical religions of the Middle East and preclassical theologies of Old Europe. The new theories which Frye's inductive methods suggest provide possible explanations for the foregrounding of the landscape in the poems I have surveyed in this essay, especially the empathetic metamorphoses experienced between poet and stone. The difference between the many poems where both men and women are empowered by achieving a harmonious relationship with rocks and British and American poems about Medusa is easier to understand in the context of Frye's anal ysis of Canadian attitudes to nature. The very fact that Medusa goes so often unnamed in Canadian poetry, with rock emerg ing as more important than her classical attributes, conforms to Frye's descriptions of rebirth quest patterns in Canadian literature. The difference between the classical Medusa and the Ca nadian stone/woman archetype may also derive from the quite different attitude towards heroism in Canada which Frye and a number of other critics describe. In the classical archetype, Perseus set forth to destroy Medusa and assimilate her powers 25</page><page sequence="26">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW as part of a series of adventures by which he proves himself worthy. The hero, as Perseus, fades into the background in Canadian poems about stones and stone/women, the subjec tive poetic persona replacing him as questor. Only in very few instances in Canadian poetry have I found his traditional inim ical gynophobia intact as a poetic attitude; a shift in perspec tive which may be explained, at least in part, by Canadian at titudes towards hunter and victim. Whether because of a sense of inferiority in the face of exile from European culture, or the colonial and thus necessarily subordinate posture towards England, or the obdurate quality of the Canadian landscape, the traditional paradigm of hero-hunted-victor dominating an enemy-prey-victim shifts to identification with the victim. Thus Frye notes a "theme of metamorphosis, where the victorious human actually becomes the defeated animal" ("National Con sciousness" 53) and Margaret Atwood develops this shift in attitude into a scale of victim identifications. Having noted, like Frye, that in Canadian literature "the proper response" to the environment is "double-natured . . . not simple escape but further exploration resulting in an increased self-knowl edge" ("Canadian Monsters" 103); in a chapter of Survival en titled "Nature the Monster" Atwood constructs a series of phases in Canadian victor-victim relationships, each of which correlates to a phase of "victimization" discussed in a previous chapter. In position one (correlating to denying being a vic tim) she postulates an attitude of looking to nature as a Divine Mother while simultaneously being eaten alive by mosquitoes. Position two (correlating to admitting one is a victim) involves accepting that Canadian nature is neither Divine nor maternal. Position three, which relates to this acceptance of victimhood as a given, can lead to the decision to attack nature before she/it attacks you, but can be transcended in position four, resolving to be a creative non-victim by taking a stance to ward nature quite similar to the one Frye describes. "What does nature look like from Position Four?" asks Atwood: "Well, it isn't the Divine Mother . . . and it isn't Nature the evil 26</page><page sequence="27">MEDUSA IN CANADA monster. It exists as itself, I suspect, but not as a collection of separate but inert objects; rather it exists as a living process which includes opposites: life and death, 'gentleness' and 'hos tility' " (63). The important thing about "Position Four" as a context for the nature imagery I have studied in this essay is that it expresses an attitude which is simultaneously very old in hu man consciousness and yet being newly rediscovered in re cent decades. Taking nature for itself, a common assumption both in preclassical times and among Native peoples, has not been a favorite Judeo-Christian posture in recent centuries. Correspondingly, taking one's body on its own terms, under standing oneself as needing to be in harmony with nature, was valued in prehistoric times but has only recently regained favor in western Europe and America. From Atwood's Position Four, as she notes, "man himself is seen as part of the process; he does not define himself as 'good' or 'weak' as against a hos tile nature, or as 'bad' or 'aggressive' as against a passive, pow erless Nature. He can accept his own body, including its sexu ality, as part of this process. . . . Since he does not see life as something that can only be maintained inside a fortress and at the expense of shutting out Nature and sex, he is free to move within space rather than in a self-created tank against it" (63). I am not suggesting that it is only in Canada that we find poets suddenly transcending Judeo-Christian dualism through naturistic synthesis of good and evil, life and death. What is striking about Canadian poetry is that it provides so many examples of poets uncomfortable with the traditional categories who recognize this indwellingness of being. "From the deer and fish in Isabella Crawford's 'The Canoe,' " writes Frye, "to the frogs and toads in Layton, from the white narcissus of Knis ter to the night-blooming cereus of Reaney, everything that is central in Canadian writing seems to be marked by the im minence of the natural world" ("Conclusion" 358). A further factor which may contribute to this attitude is the fact that English Canadians were not the only settlers in the 27</page><page sequence="28">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW new land but were accompanied and often preceded by French pioneers. Although it is unfortunately beyond the scope of this study to develop a comparison of French to English Ca nadian poems about various archetypes, such an inquiry would be interesting in light of the different approach to nature taken by French Canadians. In Exiles and Pioneers T. E. Far ley suggests a crucial difference between the way a French pi oneer is "rooted in Canadian soil" which was perceived as "sa cred and alive with indigenous ghosts" (22), and the sense of exile experienced by the English. Loyal to a culture disdainful of the "primitive," and politically estranged from America, where "manifest destiny" gave permission to wholesale geno cide, the English could not be unaware of the greater ease with which the French, long encouraged by their church to inter marry with the Native peoples, not only adapted themselves to the environment but adopted Native attitudes towards it. Thus when Canadian poetry in English produces a Medusa like stone divinity who has shed her classical identity and at tributes to take on those of the Canadian landscape, one can suspect a French as well as a Native influence on the arche type. This divinity is a powerful, prelapsarian force embody ing generative vitality, immortality, and creativity, qualities which characterize the Middle Eastern, Old European, and preclassical versions of Aphrodite and Artemis, whose "pagan ism" consists in a synthesis of the divine and the material. In the Canadian poems which I have studied here the poets some times project human qualities onto this stone being, as in the case of male poets endowing it with femininity and of women poets writing about male stone lovers. As many poets, how ever, are entirely non-projective, approaching rock as rock, as suming that its powerful qualities will flow back into human lives without becoming human in themselves. This peculiar metamorphic approach, in which the poet recognizes the power of rocks to affect human lives in entirely nönhuman terms, characterizes nearly all of the poems which I have surveyed. Even when poets like Simmons and E. J. Pratt and (in two 28</page><page sequence="29">MEDUSA IN CANADA instances) Livesay and Atwood remain at a distance from the stones onto which they have projected qualities of the opposite sex, they are nonetheless comfortable with the idea that human beings have stone qualities. Most strikingly of all, I find no significant differences in point of view and attitude along gen der lines: there are as many female poets who are projective as non-projective; the male poets seem as comfortable empa thizing with and even turning into stones as women poets. What seems to be happening in Canadian literature is a breakdown of the western European paradigm which locates men and mind on one side of a dualism and women and na ture on the other. In Canada, nature is so much a force in its own right and so powerful over human lives, that men and women poets have more in common in their responses than they do in England and America. To put it another way, the Canadian cultural signature undermines the western Euro pean dualism, imbuing Canadian poetry with an attitude to nature which is simultaneously contemporary and ancient. There is something ecologically hopeful about the way Ca nadian poets avoid anthropomorphism, the mere projection of their psychic attributes upon nature, so that even when they seek to fuse with rocks and stones they seem to acknowl edge nature's otherness, nature's endowment with an integral but nonassimilable being. Or, as F. R. Scott puts it: [far voices and fretting leaves this music the hillside gives but in the deep Laurentian river an elemental song for ever 29</page><page sequence="30">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW a quiet calling of no mind out of long aeons when dust was blind and ice hid sound only a moving with no note granite lips a stone throat ("Old Song").] Works Cited Atwood, Margaret.
