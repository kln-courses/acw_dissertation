Scot. 33, 516-17.</page><page sequence="2">PLATE III Obverse THE STELA OF KIA Reverse</page><page sequence="3">collection of the Royal Scottish Museum it was seen that the fragments fit together and make up one half of a stela as shown in fig. I and pl. III.' It will be only too obvious from the drawings in fig. i that since this monument left its sculptor's hands it has suffered considerable damage. Despoilers have hammered out names in some of the cartouches and it has been smashed into large anind small pieces, at least half of which are now missing. In addition, one fragment appears to have been reddened by fire and the others to have lain in a position where drips of water have been able to wear channels in the surface of the soft yellow limestone. Despite this dilapida- tion, however, it is possible to get a very fair idea of the pristine appearance of the stela, thanks to the fortunate chance that opposite faces were carved with a similar scene showing King Amenophis IV making an offering. The three fragments appear among the last seventy-seven items in Dr. Murray's catalogue, where their provenance is explicitly given as Hierakonpolis and their donor as Professor Flinders Petrie.2 There is no reason to doubt therefore that they were brought to light in the excavations of Quibell on behalf of the Egyptian Research Account at Kom el-Ahmar in 1898. This fact is not without its importance since those museums and collections which received material from this dig may well possess other portions of this same stela, and a search among the store-rooms of such institutions might enable us to fill some of the more baffling lacunae in the text. In its original state, the monument must have consisted of a round-topped stela about one and a half cubits high, one cubit wide, and a palm thick, competently carved with a scene in shallow relief showing on the obverse left a god with the head of a falcon seated on a block-throne and bearing on his vertex the sun's disk encompassed by a uraeus. He wears a short kilt and a corselet supported by shoulder straps. In his left hand he grasps a was-sceptre, in his right he holds an rankh. Above and before him in two large cartouches is his name, which, however, has been effaced. Faint traces of some of the glyphs, the double border to the cartouches,3 and evidence from else- where in the stela leave no doubt that the name excised was that of Re'-Harakhti-Aten,4 and that this brief label without any distinguishing epithets is to be applied to the falcon-headed deity upon the throne. Before him is a double altar piled high with bread, fowl, bouquets, and the choicer portions of offal. Facing the god on the right was the figure of the king, which, however, is now missing. A similar figure on the reverse has been so completely obliterated that it is not possible to give a categorical description of his appearance. What seems to be the big toe of his advanced foot may be seen at the base of the nearer altar-support on the reverse, and the streamers from his khepresh may be detected on the extreme right. The intact spout of a nemset-vase above the farther pillar of the altar shows that on one side of the stela at least the king was making a libation.5 The inscription referring to him can be recovered completely on the reverse and partly on the obverse, and describes him as: 'The Good God, Lord of the Two I Acc.

The names in his cartouches have been expunged also, but the last three signs in the nomen are reasonably clear and show unequivocally what must have preceded them. In the prenomen the last sign was clearly a horizontal glyph and the traces suit -. Below this scene was an inscription in sixteen columns' consisting of a hymn to Rec-Harakhti-Aten at his rising, on behalf of a man whose name is almost destroyed except for the last group tj but which may have been Kia.2 As Gardiner has pointed out to the writer, the reverse of this stela when complete evidently showed Amenophis IV offering to a figure on the left which in view of the remains of the inscription must have been the statue of a king. Gardiner adopts the view that this image can hardly have been other than that of Amenophis III and he quotes parallels for such relief-subjects at Soleb (Porter-Moss VII, I69). The writer, how- ever, while allowing due weight to Gardiner's opinion, would prefer not to attempt to name the king in question. Although some puzzling expressions occur in the texts, which the writer must leave for those better equipped than himself to elucidate, the sense seems clear enough, and the hymns do not differ radically from certain other contemporary prayers to the Aten in which the owner supplicates the sun-god for favours bestowed by the king. The fragmentary columns may be translated as follows :3 Obverse (i) Giving praise to Rec-Harakhti-Aten ... (2) at [his] ris[inga in the] eastern [horizon] of heavenb ..

If rnf is to be restored as I have suggested, one would expect rnf m Aten or rnf n Aten.

(e) The phrase -5 ]-GB j C may be recovered without much difficulty but its exact grammatical relationship with what precedes it is not obvious to me. Gardiner suggests that the trend of the inscription may be '(offering made by Akhenaten), great in his life-time, to the statue of King Y (in the house (?) of the Aten in Hierakonpolis etc.... that he may give life, health, wealth to ... Kia)'. The loss of the lower part of the stela at this point is particularly tantalizing. (f) I am unable to make any suggestion for completing the phrase in this damaged context. This fragment in its present decayed state raises a number of importunate questions to which at the moment there are no answers. We may keenly regret, for instance, that column io of the inscription on the reverse is incomplete and the column which pre- ceded it entirely lacking. It would have been interesting to know with the statue of which king Amenophis IV was associated in the prayers of Kia. We should also have liked to know whether the figure of Amenophis was carved in the orthodox style of the first months of the reign or in the pathological fashion of the subsequent period. The high quality of the undamaged parts of the relief, classically correct and precise rather than inspired, leads us to doubt very much whether the figure of the king would have been shown in anything other than the traditional mode. It is not easy moreover to ex- plain why the cartouches of the Aten have been deliberately obliterated before the figure of Re&lt;-Harakhti whereas those in the body of the text have been left intact, though they have suffered fortuitous damage. Nevertheless, despite the lacunae, there is certain information given by this stela for which we should be grateful. We may for the first time infer that there was at least a shrine to the Aten in the great temple of Nekhen. This is a very reasonable assumption in view of the fact that both Rc-IHarakhti and the local deity were falcon-gods. More- over an altar of Amenophis IV found by Quibell at Kom el-Ahmar' shows that monu- ments of the early years of the reign were erected on the site of the ancient southern capital so intimately associated with the kingship. But perhaps the greatest reward that our fragment has to offer is the discovery that the image of Rec-Harakhti can appear as a falcon-headed god bearing the early didactic name of the Aten in double cartouches without any accompanying epithets. The significance of this deserves fuller discussion. 2. The early development of the Aten The small number of monuments from the early part of the reign of Amenophis IV is yet enough to show the evolution of the iconography of the Aten cult. Davies has already drawn attention to the rapidity of this initial development,2 and for reasons I Quibell, Hierakonpolis, ii, p. 53. No details are given. 2 Davies, Rarmose, p. 30; JEA 9, 133. C. ALDRED 22</page><page sequence="6">THE BEGINNING OF THE EL-'AMARNA PERIOD which will be advanced later, we can place it all within the first two regnal years of the young king, possibly in little more than twenty-one months. The first manifestation of a new influence in the religious ideas of the period is the widespread emergence of the sun-god Rec-Harakhti as a principal deity in the current pantheon during the first months of the new reign. Thus on the lintel of the doorway to the Theban tomb of Kheruef (No. 192), Amenophis IV and his mother offer prayers to Atum on the right and Rec-Harakhti on the left. On a side-wall of the entrance appears a figure of the same king making a great oblation to Re-HIarakhti.' The back-pillar of a statue of an unknown official of Amenophis IV is inscribed with htp-di-nsw prayers to Osiris and Anubis on the left and Re-HIarakhti on the right.2 In the Theban tomb of Parennefer (No. I88) the lintel at the entrance bears a scene show- ing the owner worshipping Rec-Harakhti as a falcon-headed deity. This, it is reasonable to suppose, was the first part of the tomb to be carved. Soon afterwards, when the reveals of the doorway came to be cut, a further stage in the evolution of the religious ideas of the age had been reached and Re&lt;-Harakhti had acquired his early didactic name, not yet, however, within cartouches. But by the time that the walls of the hall of this tomb were decorated yet another change had been made, and the rayed symbol of the Aten had replaced the falcon-headed figure of Re-H.arakhti.3 A unique fragment found re-built into a temple of Amenophis II at Karnak and referring to Amenophis IV as beloved of b'cor may possibly record a further intermediate stage between the appearance of the god in traditional form and the acquisition of his early didactic name.4 There is a greater number of examples showing ReZ-Harakhti in his falcon-headed form bearing the didactic name of the Aten but not within a cartouche, such as a stela from Zernik,5 and another at Gebel es-Silsilah6 where Amenophis IV makes offerings to Amin, and although the figure of ReI-Harakhti-Aten does not appear, the king is described as the high priest of that god. Certain fragments retrieved by Legrain from the Karnakfavissa also bore the same form of the name,7 but perhaps the most notable example is the portion of a sandstone relief, now at Berlin, from a building erected at Thebes very early in the reign ( of Amenophis IV and later built into the tenth pylon of Harem- hab at Karnak.8 Here the central column of the inscription 9 % ~ vcz { \1I apparently refers to the advent of the young king. On the left of this is the disk-crowned figure of Rec-Harakhti-Aten: on the right appears the figure of Amenophis making an invocation to a missing representation of the same god. Above the king is the image of the sun's disk encircled by two uraei in opposition,9 each with an rankh around its neck. A remarkable I Davies, JEA 9, 134-5. 2 Last seen in possession of a dealer in London.

C 23</page><page sequence="7">feature of this symbol, which we shall shortly have to consider, is the three smaller rankhs pendent from the lower edge of the disk (see fig. 2). A further reference to Rec-Harakhti-Aten is to be found in the tomb of Racmose at Thebes (No. 55), where the vizier presents to the king a bouquet of Rc(-Harakhti now bearing the early didactic name not enclosed within cartouches.' The king is seated under a baldachin of state not with his consort but with the goddess Macet, and the writer has already given his reasons for considering this representation to show the young king at his advent or coronation appointing Racmose to office or confirming him in it.2 Both this tomb-scene and the Berlin relief-fragment must not be regarded as necessarily coeval with the king's coronation. There would almost certainly be a variable time-lag between the event and its representation, during which changes in the name of the god could very well have been reflected in the inscriptions added to the stock themes. That the Racmose scene is in fact to be dated to some months after the event it records seems to be evident from the fact that, before it could be completed, the revolutionary art of the reign had already swept in and rendered it old-fashioned.3 In the meantime, however, a further stage in the evolution of the new religious ideas had been reached with the incorporation of the didactic name of the Aten within double cartouches. Our stela is the only surviving monument to show this development and it is noteworthy that here the names of the god, unlike those of the king, appear without any accompanying titles or epithets. We can only assume therefore that the Aten had not yet acquired these further distinctions and we shall now consider when, in fact, they were conferred upon him. 3. The jubilees of the Aten The next refinement which the Aten faith undergoes is the invention of the concept of the sun-god as manifest in a disk having an encircling uraeus with an rankh around its neck and emergent rays ending in hands. This is the symbol which is used whenever the god is thought of as existing absolutely or independently, as for instance when he shines upon a temple or altar.4 But in the presence of the king and queen, whether Akhenaten, Amenophis III,5 Smenkhkarec,6 Tut(ankhaten,7 Nefertiti, Tiy,5 Merytaten,6 or 'Ankhesenpaaten,7 some of the hands of the Aten may hold an rankh to the royal nostrils, though the princesses are never favoured in this way. The idea is already im- plicit in the Berlin relief No. 2072 referred to above, where the rankh on the lower edge of the disk must be considered as not hanging but radiating from it, as we hope to show. Apart from one unique instance where the rays hold out 'sovereignty' (a uraeus) to the uraeus on Akhenaten's brow,8 in the majority of cases it is the rankh that the hands of the Aten grasp. There is, however, a small number of examples in which was-sceptres Davies, Rarmose, pl. 30. 2 YEA 43, 115. 3 Davies, op. cit. pp. 30-I. 4 There are many examples: e.g. Davies, Amarna, I, pls. 9. 40; II, pi. 19; III, pls. I I. I4; VI, pl. 20. A possible exception is to be seen in the greatly restored canopic chest of Akhenaten (Hamza, Ann. Serv. 40, pls. 53-54) where the tutelary goddesses have been replaced by the falcon of Rec-Harakhti, showing that the design must date from the first months of his reign. It seems clear from Hamza's remarks (p. 540) that the loose fragments of alabaster inscribed with the later form of Akhenaten's name do not belong to this chest. There is ample evidence that royal funerary furniture was prepared from the earliest days of a new king's reign. 5 E.g.

A fragment of limestone relief, probably from Karnak, and now in the Gayer Anderson Collection at Cambridge (Griffith, JEA 5, 6I; 8, 199) with two representa- tions of the Aten.

A sandstone slab in the Louvre, originally from a temple to the Aten at Karnak and later built into the tenth pylon of Haremhab at Karnak (Asselbergs, ZAS 58, 36). The symbol of the Aten is at the centre of the scene and a figure of Akhenaten, censing, faces inward from each side before an altar now destroyed. The hands of the Aten hold alternate was and rankh-signs except for the outermost pair which carry a rebus reading 'many sed-festivals' to the nostrils of the king. There can at least be little dispute about what these last two representations D and E are meant to convey. Griffith has already drawn attention to the fact that the short cloak worn by the king in D is of a kind traditionally reserved for use in the jubilee cere- monies; and he is therefore in no doubt that the scene records that such a festival was celebrated in the reign of Akhenaten, though he thinks it is the king who is so honoured. Gunn too accepted that this same relief depicts some of the ritual of the sed-festival, though he is of opinion that it is as much the jubilee of the Aten that is commemorated as that of the king.' In addition, he confirmed Asselberg's view that the scene on E, with the rays of the Aten bestowing millions of sed-festivals on the figure of Akhenaten, was also connected with a jubilee, and was inclined to regard it as the same ceremony as that recorded on D. In this he was probably right because in both cases the nomens have been changed from their original Amenophis form.2 Gunn, JEA 9, 170; 17I, n. 7. 2 Gunn, following Asselbergs, was wrong in thinking that the king's names have been surcharged only on the left. I am indebted to M. Bourguet and Mile Krieger, who intrepidly climbed a high ladder to examine the Louvre slab minutely in situ. They report that both nomens have been altered, while the prenomens have been left intact. A photograph kindly supplied through the good offices of M. Vandier clearly shows that the original nomen on the right was Amenhotpe-netjer-hek-Wese. Slab E, however, still poses a number of problems. The two portraits of the king are totally different, a circumstance which Asselbergs seeks to explain by claiming that one is in the traditional mode and the other in the revolutionary style. This seems to me unlikely and I would suggest that through some oversight a design was drawn and cut in relief showing the two co-regents Amenophis III and IV, and this was corrected when the inscriptions were added. Gunn has noted the anomaly of finding the later form of Nefertiti's name upon this relief, and the only explanation can be that her figure (now missing) and inscription were added later to a design which originally excluded her (probably because a pattern dating B 7870 25</page><page sequence="9">From the appearance of the Aten in these two reliefs, we should have warrant for regarding other representations of the sun-god radiating life (j) and dominion (I) as indicating that a jubilee is being commemorated.' That this is the proper interpreta- tion seems clear from a scene in the festival hall of Osorkon II where the image of Horus Bedhety appears as a winged disk with a frieze of rankh- and was-signs emanating from its lower edge,2 a design which recalls the symbol on the Berlin relief referred to above. We can see by analogy that, just as the hands of the Aten in festival hold the rankhs and was-sceptres that appear along the lower edge of the disk of Horns Bedhety, so Aten in his more usual aspect brings to the FIG. 3 nostrils of the king and queen the rankhs that radiate from the lower edge of the disk of Rec-Harakhti in the Berlin relief. It would appear, in fact, that we must regard the five monuments A to E as commemorating specifically and incidentally that the Aten is in jubilee. Stela B could well have been made in honour of such an occasion, if the single was extended to the king is here not a mere touch of fancy on the part of the artist. The panel C gives more definite proof of having been carved in a period of jubilee, though the fact that it lay in the debris of the royal tomb suggests that whatever its original purpose, it had been adapted as a model relief for the sculptors employed on the decoration of the tomb chambers, and left behind when the work was abandoned.3 We shall return to the significance of scene A later. Griffith made a second examination of D, and his reconsidered opinion supported the suggestions of Schafer and Sethe that the name of the king in the second cartouche had originally been Amen-hotpe-netjer-hek-Wese and that this had subsequently been re-carved into the later nomen of Akhenaten. He reached the reluctant conclusion that Akhenaten had therefore celebrated a jubilee early in his reign before his change of name. Gunn, too, accepted this evidence as showing that a jubilee of the Aten had occurred before the latter part of year six of the reign.4 In his study of the inscriptional evidence Gunn concluded that the Aten had celebrated more than one jubilee synchron- izing with those of a king whom he took to be Akhenaten himself.s The,evidence that monuments D and E on the one hand, and B and C on the other, provide is that Akhen- aten celebrated at least two jubilees of the Aten, one before the king's change of name and one after it, since on the latter two monuments no erasure of the king's nomen is perceptible and the queen's name appears in its later form. Moreover, whereas on D and E the king is a lonely figure, on B and C he is shown with his wife and daughters. to a period before her marriage had been adapted by the draughtsman, or because the queen, as custom de- manded, played no part in the ceremony). The fact that she must have been represented on a very much smaller scale than her husband lends support to this view, since she is everywhere else shown as little inferior in stature to her husband. It should be noted that, whereas the Boundary Stelae speak of the Aten as radiating upon the king in life and dominion, the hands of the rayed disk convey only rankhs to the royal nostrils. 2 Naville, Festival Hall, pl. 6. 3 Bouriant et al.

ALDRED</page><page sequence="10">THE BEGINNING OF THE EL-'AMARNA PERIOD Are there any other representations that might be accredited to a second sed-festival ? The writer is of the opinion that the scene sketched on the east wall of the tomb of Parennefer at El-'Amarna may well record a ceremony in this second jubilee.' Here the sandalled feet of a woman shown standing beside the king's faldstool are on too small a scale to be Nefertiti's and must belong to the eldest daughter. We have warrant there- fore for thinking that the event recorded is quite different from the first festival held at Thebes. The king, wearing the triple Atefu crown, sits under a baldachin. The image of the Aten is unfortunately incomplete and it is not possible to see whether any of the rays would have carried was-sceptres as well as rankhs. Before the king is an unusually large array of food and drink and two groups of musicians. This can be no ordinary domestic feast such as those shown in the tomb of Huya;2 the elaborate crown, if nothing else, would be sufficient to dispel this idea. On the other hand, the function can have nothing to do with the reception of tribute as Davies half-heartedly suggests.3 The display set before the king is quite different in character and detail from the gifts brought by foreign legates on their Magi-like journey to the new king.4 Parennefer, too, who waits upon Akhenaten with napkin and perfume vase in his capacity as Washer of the Royal Hands, is not shown in the same mien and dress as those high officials who, with their wands and fans of office, introduce the foreign suppliants before the throne. The damaged inscription is moreover silent about the reception of tribute from abroad, but makes more than a passing mention of the sed-festival. For these reasons, the writer is disposed to think that the scene records a jubilee rite, probably in the mTn-ffl 'Hall of Eating',5 and that Parennefer is the 'friend' who on this occasion is discharging the ancient rite of washing the king's feet.6 This episode was doubtless his finest hour and therefore chosen for perpetuation on the wall of his tomb-chapel. We know from the excavations of the Metropolitan Museum in the ruins of the palace of Amenophis III at Thebes that enormous quantities of provisions were necessary for such func- tions7 and the feast set before Akhenaten in this drawing may perhaps be regarded as significant. We may here pause for a moment to consider a little further this phenonomen of a sed-festival for the Aten. The whole idea in the case of a god, even such a heavenly king as the Aten, must be considered rather incongruous; and the event can hardly have followed closely all the rites appropriate to the jubilee of a Pharaoh. The sed-festival as practised in historic times had for its purpose a symbolical re-enactment of the political union of Egypt under Menes,8 though it may also have had strong undertones of the need for rejuvenating the divine king, or renewing his sovereignty, after a long period of rule.9 Both concepts are incompatible with the idea of an immortal god who sloughed off his anthropomorphic form early in his development. It is hardly an idea that could have arisen spontaneously and must have been suggested by a contemporary event affecting the earthly king. Thus Gunn, who regarded the epithet imi hb sd in the Aten's Davies, op. cit. vi, pl. 6. 2 Davies, op. cit. III, pls. 4. 6. 3 Davies, op. cit. vI, p. 5. 4 Aldred, JEA 43, 1I4-I5. 5 Leps. Denkm.

But if the Egyptian mind could have tolerated such incompatibilities, it must have boggled at admitting the Aten to all the age-old ritual of the Pharaoh's sed-festival. For such a jealous god as the Aten the visit to the shrines of local gods in the jubilee courts and the making of offerings to them would be unthinkable; and the repeated robings in various costumes for a deity in aniconic form were just as impossible. Moreover, what was anathema to the Aten would be equally offensive to his child, high priest, and junior partner, Akhenaten, and we must not therefore expect to find either represented in the traditional iconography of the sed-festival, particularly in the later functions when the monotheism of Aten worship had become more marked. Of the jubilee ceremonies, the only one that seems at all appropriate would be the presentation of food offerings in the Hall of Eating; and this in point of fact seems to be what is represented in the tomb of Parennefer. The king is officiating under his bal- dachin at a presentation of viands, but he is not necessarily partaking of them. The iconography of the El-'Amarna reliefs suggests very strongly that the ritual of Aten worship centred around the presentation of lavish food offerings, a practice which is likely to have been greatly extended during an occasion of jubilee. It is perhaps not without significance that those parts of the temple at El-'Amarna known as the Per-hai and Gem-aten in which the ceremonies of sed-festivals may have been performed' were liberally equipped with offering-tables; and a veritable 'forest' of mud-brick platforms lay to the north and south outside these sanctuaries, perhaps forming the 'Court of the Festival'.2 The representations in the tombs at El-'Amarna3 show that these offering- tables were loaded with food in much the same way as the altars of various gods present at the jubilee of Osorkon II were provided with victuals.4 4. The dates of the jubilees No inscription referring to a sed-festival during the reign of Akhenaten gives a specific date for any of those events, and if we wish to deduce when they were celebrated, we shall have to make use of other data. Thus Gunn has pointed out that certain epithets which accompany the name of the Aten may be employed as a means of dating inscriptions; the phrase 4+, variant +[1j , for instance, regularly following the earlier form of the didactic name of the god, whereas '[,2 variant ', I, is associated with the later name except for a few exceptions in the royal tomb and the tomb of Mahu.5 Fairman has also drawn attention to the circumstance that the omission of the expres- sion ,7 S a m® in the titles of the Aten may be the means of dating an inscription up to the first few months of the eighth year.6 Such indications of date, unhappily, cannot be regarded as absolute, for while it would seem that the evolution of the Aten doctrine was organic throughout the reign of I Fairman, City of Akhenaten, in, 196. 2 Fairman, ibid. 195. It is worthy of note that on the Brooklyn statuette Amenophis III is described as 'Lord of Food, Rich in Provisions, Lord of Festivals in the Per-hai' (Hayes, JNES 10, 178). 3 Davies, Amarna, ii, pls.

It would conform to Egyptian practice if a certain number of accepted subjects for representation in relief and painting were in stock from the earlier years of the reign and only tardily and incompletely revised by the craftsmen, whose instinct would be to copy them mechanically. This is probably the explanation of the anomaly in the tomb of Mahu, cited by Gunn, where the epithet imi hb sd accompanies the later name of the Aten. The sculptor seems to have followed a design stereotyped in an earlier part of the reign, and, while altering the name of the Aten to its later form, had omitted to revise completely the rest of the inscription.2 It may be, too, that those instances where the later name of the Aten has been cut over the earlier form are the result of a belated attempt by the master draughtsman to correct an obvious anachronism after an out-of-date pattern had been followed too blindly, otherwise it is difficult to see why, in all other places where the early name of the Aten now stands, similar revisions should not have been made. The frantic haste in which the immense building operations at El-'Amarna must have been pushed forward and the obvious shortage of skilled craftsmen and efficient supervisors would fully account for such irregularities. Despite this reservation, however, the epithets are a means of narrowing the date of an inscription when they are considered statistically, and it is worth noting that, on all those early monuments of the reign in which the nomen of the king appears in its original Amenophis form, the phrase imi hb sd is found only in the singular. Similarly, the later form of the Aten name is accompanied by the expression nb hb(w) sd in every case except for the two anomalies mentioned by Gunn. A representation of cardinal importance for the dating of these jubilees of the Aten is scene A in the tomb-chapel of Ra(mose. We have already referred to the decoration of the south side of the doorway in the west wall where Ra(mose offers bouquets to the king seated under his canopy of state. Even the draft of this design was not completed before work was switched to the carving of a scene on the north side of the doorway showing the royal pair and their attendants in all the idiosyncrasy of the new Atenist style and iconography.3 The interval between these two designs must be very short indeed, months, perhaps even weeks, rather than years. While on the left-hand side Re'-Harakhti appears with his didactic name still unenclosed in cartouches, and the young king has Ma(et for a consort, on the right, the Aten shines in new-born splendour upon the king and queen in the Window of Appearances, with his rays showing that he is in the jubilee that his freshly won title proclaims. No daughter is in evidence, not even as an infant in the arms of one of the queen's retinue, and this we must accept can only be among the first copies of the approved design for this particular subject and is therefore I Gunn (JEA 9, 171, n. 8) has seen that the Boundary Stelae do not necessarily reflect the situation that existed by the time their carving was completed. 2 It is significant that only one daughter is shown in this relief despite the fact that by year 9 all six had been born to Nefertiti (Aldred JEA 43, 38, n. 8). In an identical version of the same scene elsewhere, the expression nb hb sd appears (JEA 13, pi. 47). For the same reason, the dating of the monuments of the reign by the number of children shown is not always conclusive. 3 Davies, Rarmose, 31. 29</page><page sequence="13">practically coeval with the event. Brief as the interval between the carving of these two scenes must be, there was yet a further development revealed by the stela of Kia, but not represented elsewhere-the appearance of the name of Rec-Harakhti-Aten in two cartouches. The fact that the titulary of the Aten suddenly emerges in its complete early form on the right-hand side of the wall makes it evident that the rayed symbol of the disk and the accompanying epithets, particularly imi hb sd, were conferred upon the Aten on the occasion of his first jubilee and that this must have taken place very early in the reign of Amenophis IV.' Monuments D and E also seem to refer to this first jubilee, celebrated while the name of the king was still Amenophis. If such a striking translation in the appearance and titulary of the Aten occurred on the occasion of his first jubilee it is reasonable to suppose that the other dramatic change that he underwent-the revision of his didactic name and epithets-also coincided with another sed-festival. Indeed, Gunn is in no doubt that the epithet nb hbw sd indicates that the Aten had celebrated more than one jubilee.2 Such an event would therefore have occurred before year twelve of the reign, and probably in year nine.3 The question arises whether this was a second or third jubilee. The sketch on the back wall of the tomb of Parennefer and monuments B and C all show the nomen of the king as Akhen- aten without the least trace of revision, and give the name of the Aten in its early form with the epithet as imi hb(w) sd. These documents apparently refer to an intermediate or second jubilee, while the revised names and titles of the Aten were acquired only on the occasion of a subsequent sed-festival. We may note in passing that while the Aten suffered no radical alteration in his name and styles during this second jubilee, apart possibly from the pluralizing of imi hb sd and the acquisition of nb snn(t) nb 7tn, it must have been about this time that the names of the king and queen were changed, though not perhaps simultaneously ;4 and it seems plausible to consider that this critical event coincided with a ceremony of renewal during a jubilee year. That the Aten could observe as many as three sed-festivals in less than nine years should come as no surprise. Tuthmosis III held four jubilees in twelve years,5 and both Amenophis III and Ramesses II each celebrated three, including the first occasion, in seven years.6 It would seem in fact that these functions were held according to a fixed system beginning with a thirty years' reign, the few apparent exceptions to this rule probably being perfectly explicable if we knew more about co-regency, especially during the Eighteenth Dynasty.7 We have already suggested above that the jubilees of the Aten were closely connected with the jubilees of the Pharaoh, or vice versa, and The scene of the distribution of rewards from the Window of Appearances, so common in the repertory of themes for decoration at 'Amarna, may in fact have had its genesis at the first sed-festival since one of the customs during such functions was the giving of gifts by the king to his henchmen, see Leps.

An alternative explanation is that the draughtsman had not completely brought up to date an earlier draft from which he was working: see below. 5 Breasted, Anc. Rec. II, § 624. 6 Hayes, JNATES Io, 84-86; Breasted, op. cit. II, § 549; Mond and Myers, Temples of Armant, pp. I63 ff. 7 The whole question of co-regency during Dyn. XVIII deserves closer investigation. To the writer there seems a prima facie case for considering that a well-established system of co-regency existed among the Theban dynasts from the beginning of the New Kingdom at least. C. ALDRED 30</page><page sequence="14">THE BEGINNING OF THE EL-'AMARNA PERIOD Gunn reached the conclusion that there was every probability that they synchronized with those of Akhenaten. In his re-examination of slab D, Griffith underlined the diffi- culty of reconciling a thirty-year festival with a date so early in the reign of Akhenaten. At the time he wrote, the human bones discovered in the so-called tomb of Tiy were thought to be the mortal remains of Akhenaten, and it is highly probable that as a result of Gardiner's recent study of the published archaeological evidence from the deposit' this attribution will return to favour. Unfortunately, however, not much more than an age of thirty at death can be claimed for these bones, even if certain pathological charac- teristics are taken into account2 and it looks as though we shall have to admit the fact that Akhenaten died at the age of thirty-three after a rule of seventeen years. Unless we are prepared to claim that Akhenaten was sufficiently unorthodox to flout tradition wherever he found it, we shall have some difficulty in accepting that he could have celebrated three jubilees by the ninth year of his reign, i.e. before he was 26 years old. Few kings celebrated more than one jubilee, the exceptions that immediately spring to mind being the four or more of Tuthmosis III and the thirteen or so of Ramesses II. But Amenophis III also celebrated three such festivals in seven years and the conclusion seems inescapable that the jubilees of the Aten did indeed coincide with those of a king, as Gunn believed, but that king was Amenophis III. To those who contend that there is impressive evidence for a long co-regency between Amenophis III and Akhenaten, and the present writer must number himself among them,3 this solution of the problem should recommend itself. The jubilees of Amenophis III were important affairs that made a deep impression on his contemporaries, and it may well be presumed that the co-regent would hardly escape their impact but would turn them to account on his own behalf and that of his god. He may in fact have played in them the. same managerial role as Khacemwese did in the jubilees of Ramesses II, though, unlike him, hardly in the capacity of setem-priest, which was particularly odious to his doctrines.4 The jubilees of Akhenaten's co-regent, his father Amenophis III, and those of his other co-regent, 'Father' Aten, thus become closely identified. 5. A chronology of the co-regency On the assumption that the first three jubilees of the Atens coincided with the jubilees of Amenophis III it is possible to construct a chronology of the first part of Akhen- aten's reign, up to the time of his father's death, as a working hypothesis and in order to Gardiner, JEA 43, 23. The writer, however, wishes to make it clear that he cannot accept Gardiner's thesis in toto, since to him the evidence that the coffin was originally the second coffin of a daughter of Akhenaten, and only adapted later for the person who was buried in it, is overwhelming. Neither does he accept that Derry's examination of the skull of the occupant of this coffin (Ann. Serv. 31, 116-I9) disposes of a number of issues raised by Elliot Smith and Ferguson in their report on the same remains. It is earnestly to be hoped that all the human bones from this deposit may be re-examined by pathologists who have radiological aids at their disposal and are able to subject the inner table of the cranium, or a cast of it, to very special investigation. 2 G. Elliot Smith, Cambridge Univ. Med. Soc. Mag. iv (1926), pp. 34-39. 3 Aldred, ibid. I I6; JNES i8, I 13-20. The writer shortly proposes to state the case for a co-regency at greater length and to offer fresh evidence. 4 Davies-Gardiner, Amenemhet, 21. 5 There is no evidence that he celebrated any more, though on the analogy of those of Ramesses II others should have followed at three-year intervals. 31</page><page sequence="15">sum up the foregoing discussion. It would be possible in some cases to define the date more precisely by giving month and day, but as our purpose is primarily to show the main sequence of events rather than their exact moment in time, this refinement is avoided here. The first of the year-numbers in the following table refers of course to the regnal year of Amenophis III, the second to that of Akhenaten. Year 28/I. The eldest surviving son of the king becomes co-regent on reaching man- hood and reigns as Amenophis IV. Note: The date appears to be fixed by the circum- stance that 'coronation-tribute' was received in year 12 (Aldred, JEA 43, 114). Since Amenophis III is now known to have lived into his 39th regnal year (Hayes, JNES IO, 87-88), the date of the inception of the co-regency may thus be obtained by dead reckoning. Years 28-30/I-2. The Aten cult develops rapidly from the worship of the falcon- headed ReI-Harakhti, through his acquisition of didactic names, to their enclosure within double cartouches and the emergence of the idea of 'King' Aten. Temples to the new god are built at Karnak and Hierakonpolis and doubtless elsewhere. During this period, Amenophis IV marries Nefertiti, and his funerary furniture is prepared, including his canopic chest. Year 30/2. The first jubilees of Amenophis III and the Aten are held simultaneously, when the rayed symbol of the Aten makes its appearance and the event is commemorated in a titulary which accompanies the name of the god. Years 30-3412-6. The revolutionary art of the Atenists bursts into sudden flower with the first jubilee and is seen at its most extreme in the colossi from the Aten temple at Karnak. The style has still undiminished authority by the time that the boundary stelae are carved at Akhetaten. The hejira thither is planned, and the building of the city of the Aten begun. Note: There is some dispute about the date of the move to Akhetaten, most authorities believing that it did not take place before year 6 (Gunn, JEA 9, 17I) but Davies still adhering to year 4 (Davies, Rarmose, p. 30, n. 2). Even the earlier text of stelae K and X seems to show clearly that what is dedicated to the Aten is not a mere demarcated site, but a township already partly built; and a few years must be allowed for the region to reach even this state of development. The evidence of the wine-jar dockets is not conclusive, since beer brewed locally would have been the drink of the many workmen swarming over the site. The remains of wine-jars occurring from year 5 onwards merely give us the point at which the official classes began to take up residence in newly built quarters, probably from year 6, since the wine would hardly be new. The early planning of the move seems also to be evident in the design of the boundary stelae K and X with only one daughter provided for and the queen's name still in its early form-probably through an oversight on the part of the scribe, who had not revised properly a draft made at an earlier date, perhaps in year 3. Year 34/6. The second jubilees of Amenophis III and the Aten are held. The Aten acquires new epithets, imi hbw sd and probably also nb mn(t) nb Itn. The king's name is changed to Akhenaten and the queen's to Neferneferuaten Nefertiti. The new city at Akhetaten is occupied and dedicated to the Aten. C. ALDRED 32</page><page sequence="16">THE BEGINNING OF THE EL-'AMARNA PERIOD Years 34-37/6-9. The major part of the central city at Akhetaten and most of the tombs are constructed during this time. By the end of the period all six daughters have been born to Nefertiti. Year 37/9. The third jubilees of Amenophis III and the Aten are celebrated, the names of the god being changed to the later didactic form and an epithet modified to nb hb(w) sd. Year 39/II. Amenophis III dies and Akhenaten enters upon sole rule. He receives his 'coronation tribute' soon after in year twelve. B 7870 33</page></plain_text>
