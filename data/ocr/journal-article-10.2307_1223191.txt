Joe Ewan in his review (Taxon 37: 937-938) of Betsy Warren's Wilderness walkers: Naturalists in early Texas (1987) lamented that "natural history juvenilia have been few, ever since [W. P. Garrison's] What Darwin saw appeared in 1880." Actually, Ewan's statement must be qualified to read "relatively few compared to works for adults and professionals" because in the past two decades there has been an explosive growth in natural history juvenilia. This is especially true for books on zoology, partly because the public has always been much more fascinated with crustaceans, dinosaurs, and whales than with crucifers, di- noflagellates, and seed ferns. For example, a quick search of Melvyl, the computerized database of the University of California library system, for "juvenile literature and botany" (and related subjects) 81</page><page sequence="2">TAXON VOLUME 39 yielded 111 hits (including multiple editions) versus 270 hits for "juvenile literature and zoology" (and related subjects). Probably more indicative of reality is the fact that my public library in Ken- sington, Contra Costa Co., California, has at least eight times as much zoological as botanical juvenilia. A listing of some notable, recent botanical juvenilia seems worthwhile for several reasons. Botanical gardens and herbaria with a public education program should strive to have a representative selection of such work. There is room for professional biologists, in particular readers of this journal, to apply their talents and extensive knowledge to adding to the body of botanical juvenilia. Instilling in future generations an interest in and even love of plant sciences is especially important in this day of reductionistic biology. Indeed, from a survival viewpoint, this ranks among our more important tasks. Those of us involved in teaching plant biology to non-major university students can profit from examining botanical juvenilia, which can be valuable in showing us how not to miss the forest because of the trees. Finally, there is the simple esthetic appreciation of botanical art in an area not particularly familiar to most professionals. The following discussion focuses on botanical juvenilia in a broad sense, including agriculture, and notably on the contributions of two preeminent authors and especially illustrators of juvenilia, Carol Lemer and Anne Ophelia Todd Dowden, who have respectively 14 and 18 works. I also consider various other botanical juvenilia published mainly in the 1980s. In all, 91 titles of botanical juvenilia are listed, plus 28 titles of related zoological juvenilia and three related adult books. The works listed are chiefly American, although some are translations from Russian, Swiss, Swedish, and especially Japanese books. Unless noted, all items are hardbound ("PLB" =publisher's library binding) and are illustrated at least partly in color. To save space, an appendix lists publisher's addresses. Items lacking ISBN and price information are out-of-print. Juvenilia have frequent cost increases and go rapidly out-of-print; very little seem to be reprinted. Hence prior to ordering, book information should be verified with the publisher. The information below was current as of early September 1989. The Library of Congress and/or public libraries classify as "juvenile literature" the works discussed here (a few adult books are included for completeness). This embraces a wide variety of levels, from preschool to "young adult," a designation used in trade publications (e.g., Books in print) and also by public libraries. Therefore, whenever possible, I give more specific designations of grade level ("k" =kindergarten, "ps" =preschool), which are usually taken from Book review digest (H. W. Wilson Co., New York) or especially Books in print (P. R. Bowker, New York). The separation ofjuvenile literature into "children's literature" for preschool through grade six and "young adult literature" for grades seven through 12 (e.g., Book review digest) is widely accepted. The Botanical Art of Carol Lerner Carol Lerner of Chicago has developed into one of the leading authors and illustrators of juvenile literature during the past decade. Many of Lerner's well-done efforts have received various com- mendations. The asterisked items below received the American Library Association's "Notable Chil- dren's Book" award. Lerner both authored and illustrated the following contributions to botanical juvenilia, which are listed in chronological order: On the forest edge (William Morrow and Co., New York, 1978, [48] pp., B&amp;W illus., grades 4-6) is an account of the plants and animals inhabiting the area where the edge of a forest meets an abandoned field. The book has a glossary but no index. Flowers of a woodland spring (Ibid., 1979, [32] pp., grades 3-9) depicts various examples of ephemeral woodland wild flowers. Scientific names of plants are not used in this unindexed work. Seasons of the tallgrass prairie* (Ibid., 1980, 48 pp., B&amp;W illus., grades 5 up) presents the seasonal plant life of the American prairie, including the role of wildfire in its ecology. This unindexed book uses scientific names. A biblical garden* (Ibid., 1982, 46, [2] pp., grades 6 up), which has translations from the Hebrew bible by Ralph Lerner, describes and pictures 20 plants mentioned in the Old Testament, including fig, lentil, olive, papyrus, and pomegranate. Scientific names appear in the figure captions. An index is lacking. Pitcher plants: The elegant insect traps* (Ibid., 1983, 63, [1] pp., ISBN 0-688-01717-7, $12.95, ISBN 0-688-01718-5, PLB, $12.88, grades 6 up) is a superb and handsomely illustrated discussion of nine species (scientific names are given) of American Sarraceniaceae and in its treatment of "plun- derers," that is, insects eating the "eaters," covers a topic not usually treated in books on plant camivory. The book is indexed and has a glossary and list of institutions having public displays of carnivorous plants. 82</page><page sequence="3">FEBRUARY 1990 Aforest year (Ibid., 1987, 48 pp., ISBN 0-688-06413-2, $12.95, ISBN 0-688-06414-0, PLB, $12.88, grades 3-5) is a seasonal diorama of the plant, fungal, and especially animal life of a temperate deciduous forest of the eastern United States. The book has a glossary and index but does not use scientific names. Moonseed and mistletoe: A book of poisonous wild plants (Morrow Junior Books, New York, 1988, 32 pp., ISBN 0-688-07307-7, $12.95, ISBN 0-688-07308-5, PLB, $12.88, grades 9 up) introduces wild plants that may be troublesome by irritating the skin or causing illness or death from tasting or eating. This is indexed and includes scientific names of plants. Plantfamilies (Ibid., 1989, 32 pp., ISBN 0-688-07881-8, $12.95, ISBN 0-688-07882-6, PLB, $12.88) is a very handsome and most instructive treatment of 12 families of angiosperms (Ranuncul., Cruc., Carophyll., Lab., Legum., Ros., Umbel., Comp., Lili., Ar., Gram., Orchid.). This has an introduction, useful glossary, and fine full-page illustrations by Lerner, but lacks scientific names and an index. Lerner has also illustrated various works authored by other persons: Anita Holmes's The 100-year-old cactus (Four Winds Press, New York, 1983, [32] pp., grades ps- 3) depicts the first century of life of saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea). Scientific names and an index are absent. Millicent E. Selsam's Treeflowers* (William Morrow and Co., New York, 1984, 31, [1] pp., ISBN 0-688-02768-7, $12.95, ISBN 0-688-02769-5, PLB, $12.88, grades 4 up) follows the growth cycle of 12 common flowering trees (pussy willow, white oak, sugar maple, elm, apple, horse chestnut, flowering dogwood, magnolia, witch hazel, black walnut, black locust, tulip tree). Selsam's descriptions are brief, but excellent, whereas Lerner's 12 color plates are quite fine, "a felicitous union of talents" (Anony- mous, Bull. Cent. Child. Books 37: 212). Scientific names are given, but there is no index. See also the comments below for Dowden's The blossom on the bough. Glenda Daniel and Jerry Sullivan's A Sierra Club naturalist's guide to the North Woods ofMichigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota (Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, California, 1981, viii, 408 pp., B&amp;W illus., ISBN 0-87156-248-0, hardbound, $24.95, ISBN 0-87156-277-4, paperbound, $12.95) is an adult book treating the geology, flora, and fauna of this area, pages 123-302 having Lerner's "botanical drawings." Lerer's black-and-white zoological drawings appear in Robert M. McClung's zoological juvenilia on, respectively, the biology of peeper frog, dragonfly, and sphinx moth: Peeper, first voice of spring (William Morrow and Co., New York, 1977, [32] pp.); Green darner: The story of a dragonfly (Ibid., 1980 rev. ed., [32] pp.); Sphinx: The story of a caterpillar (Ibid., 1981 rev. ed., [32] pp.). The last two are revisions of, respectively, 1956 and 1949 works with McClung's illustrations. Of the above I most appreciate Plant families, Pitcher plants, Moonseed and mistletoe, and Tree flowers. Lerner's works are lucidly written and are usually enhanced with fine, delicate watercolor paintings. However, many of her works can be faulted for not supplying indices or scientific names of plants. The Botanical Art of Anne Ophelia Todd Dowden Anne Ophelia Todd Dowden, born 17 Sep. 1907, and long-time resident of New York City, is a botanical artist of considerable renown. Her exquisite art, notable for its scientific accuracy and extreme detail, has an elegance, naturalness, and subtlety with few superiors. Dowden has had many exhibitions, and one resultant catalog (An exhibition of botanical illustrations by Anne Ophelia Todd Dowden: 17 October 1965 to 15 May 1966, Hunt Botanical Library, Pittsburgh, 1965, 23 pp.). Dowden's splendid title-page artwork in H. W. Rickett's six-volume (in 14 parts) Wildflowers of the United States (1966- 1973) is quite familiar to taxonomists, but her equally superb paintings in various children's books deserve much broader appreciation. Dowden has already been praised in Taxon by Frans A. Stafleu (16: 202, 19: 638-639, 22: 143, 308 for quote), who noted some of her "jewels of plant illustration." Pages 38-39 in George H. M. Lawrence's A selection of 20th century botanical art &amp; illustration (Hunt Botanical Library, Pittsburgh, 1969, 168 pp.) are on Dowden. I have been familiar with Dowden's elegant work for 25 years since purchasing for 95? her fascinating book, The secret life of the flowers (Odyssey Press, New York, 1964, 45, [2] pp., The Odyssey Library, 9), my first introduction to pollination ecology. This has been translated at least twice: La vida secreta de lasflores, translated by Angeles Torre Mendizabal (Novaro, Mexico, 1964, 45 pp.), and Vita segreta dei fiori, translated by Gabriella Rosetti (Mondadori, Milando, 1965, 42 pp.). The 28 original water colors reproduced in this charming book are on permanent loan to The Hunt Botanical Library (Lawrence, op. cit.). In 11 by 17 cm format and with full use of color, this is apparently a children's 83</page><page sequence="4">TAXON VOLUME 39 book, though there is a rather detailed text, many terms, and an index with scientific names. Dowden has authored and illustrated various other botanical juvenilia, which are here listed chronologically (the asterisked items received the American Library Association's "Notable Children's Book" award): Look at a flower* (Thomas Y. Crowell Co., New York, 1963, [viii], 120 pp., grades 6-8) gives generalities on pollination and floral structure and describes ten common families (Lili., Gram., Orchid., Ranuncul., Cruc., Ros., Legum., Umbel., Lab., Comp.). Dowden and Richard Thomson's Roses (Odyssey Press, New York, 1965, 43, [4] pp., The Odyssey Library, 19) is in the same series as Dowden's The secret life of the flowers but treats the history of roses, especially in religion and folklore. Las rosas (Novaro, Mexico, 1966, 45 pp.) is a translation by Gabriela Romero Flores. See addendum note 2. Wild green things in the city: A book of weeds (Thomas Y. Crowell Co., New York, 1972, [viii], 56 pp.) deals with the weeds of Manhattan and their dispersal and concludes with plant lists (with common and scientific names) for Manhattan, Denver, and Los Angeles that indicate how common a species is (for review see F. A. Stafleu, Taxon 22: 308). The blossom on the bough: A book of trees* (Ibid., 1975, [viii], 71, [1] pp., ISBN 0-690-04655-3, PLB, $14.89, grades 5 up) is an particularly beautifully illustrated study of the forest regions of the United States and especially the cones, flowers, and fruits of trees. There are regional lists of species of forest trees and a detailed index. Ten of the 12 trees in the Lerer-Selsam work appear in Dowden's. Dowden's paintings are superior to Lerer's excellent, though slightly too yellowish-green illustrations. However, because Lerner's plates are better labeled and often contain more plant parts, they would be more suitable for class use than Dowden's watercolors. Stateflowers (Thomas Y. Crowell, New York, 1978, 1987 reissue, ix, [i], 86 pp., ISBN 0-690-03884- 4, PLB, $13.89, grades 5 up) has superb color paintings of the flowers of the District of Columbia and the 50 states (Maine is the oddball, having chosen Pinus strobus), descriptions of the flowers, and background information on economic and legislative aspects. This noble harvest: A chronicle of herbs (Collins, New York, 1979, 80 pp., grades 5 up) is an introduction to herbs and their history, characteristics, and uses. Back matter includes lists of herbs used in cookery, plant families of herbs, a bibliography, and a detailed index. From flower to fruit (Thomas Y. Crowell, New York, 1984, [viii], 56 pp., ISBN 0-690-04402-X, $14.95, grades 7 up) nicely depicts, with acute detail, over 150 flowers and their resultant fruits. Clover and the bee (Ibid.) is in press. In addition, Dowden illustrated several juvenile botany books written by other persons (in chronolog- ical order): Jessica Kerr's Shakespeare's flowers (Thomas Y. Crowell Co., New York, 1969, [x], 85, [1] pp., ISBN 0-690-73163-9, hardbound, $14.95, ISBN 0-690-04320-1, paperbound, $6.95, grades 5-7, also Longmans Young Books, London, 1969) has Dowden's color illustrations accompanying quotations from 24 Shakespearean dramas about 27 flowers. The text explains what each flower meant in Eliz- abethan times and the Bard's particular use of it in his plays. The book has a three-page bibliography and indices to plants and Shakespearean matter. Frans A. Stafleu enthusiastically reviewed this work, remarking (Taxon 19: 638-639) that "for many the principal attraction of this exquisitely produced booklet will lie in the beauty of its illustrations," whereas K. S. White (New Yorker 46: 121) noted that it is "the best of the many books on Shakespeare's flowers I have encountered." This is a juvenile book that many adults can enjoy. Hal Borland's Plants of Christmas (Thomas Y. Crowell, New York, 1969, 1987 rev. ed., ix, [i], 21 pp., ISBN 0-690-04649-9, $13.95, ISBN 0-690-04650-2, PLB, $13.89, grades 3 up) explores the legends and symbols of 12 traditional plants of Christmas, such as English holly, ivy, mistletoe, and poinsettia. I have not seen Louis Untermeyer's Plants of the bible (Golden Press, New York, 1970, unpaginated) and the poetry work Roses: Selections (Ibid., 1970, [27] pp.), which I cite from The National Union Catalog. See addendum note 2. Borland's The golden circle: A book of months (Thomas Y. Crowell Co., New York, 1977, [x], 53, [1] pp., ISBN 0-690-03803-8, $13.95, grades 5 up) displays panoramic and miniature views of the zoological and especially botanical world throughout the year. Phyllis S. Busch's Wildflowers and the stories behind their names (Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1977, viii, 88 pp., grades 3 up) nicely illustrates and vignettes 50 familiar American wildflowers. Robert L. Crowell's The lore &amp; legends offlowers* (Thomas Y. Crowell, New York, 1982, [vii], 80 pp., ISBN 0-690-03991-3, $14.95, ISBN 0-690-04035-0, PLB, $14.89, grades 7 up) presents the lore 84</page><page sequence="5">FEBRUARY 1990 and legends behind 24 species of common flowers, including narcissus, crocus, dandelion, dahlia, and marigold. John and Katherine Paterson's Consider the lilies: Plants of the Bible (Ibid., 1986, 96 pp., ISBN 0-690-04461-5, $13.95, ISBN 0-690-04463-1, PLB, $13.89, grades 7 up) offers biblical stories and botanical descriptions supplementing Dowden's illustrations of 39 familiar and exotic flowers, fruits, and plants mentioned in the accompanying bible verses and selections. These are arranged among three groups: "Revelation," "Necessity," and "Celebration." There are indices to scriptures and plants. Lerner's A biblical garden is similar but treats only 20 Old Testament plants. Finally, Dowden authored (as Anne Ophelia Todd) and illustrated the adult book The little hill: A chronicle of theflora on a half acre at the Green Camp, Ringwood, New Jersey (Cooper Union School of Art and Architecture, New York, 1961, 19, [1] pp., 4 color pls., Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, 8). This describes the topography and flora of this New Jersey hill and gives lists of plants (exclusive of grasses and fungi) beginning to bloom each month from April through September, plus trees, edible plants, and medicinal plants. The four exceptionally fine color plates treat six species in four genera: Daucus carota, Rubus allegheniensis, R. orarius, Smilicina racemosa, Verbascum phlomoides, and V. thapsus. All of Dowden's juvenilia meticulously give scientific names of plants, and, except for Borland's two books, all are indexed. Many of her works were checked by prominent botanists. I most like Dowden's The blossom on the bough, Consider the lilies, From flower to fruit, The secret life of the flowers, Shakespeare's flowers, and Stateflowers. Her works are characterized by charm of prose (e.g., from the Blossom book, learning tree structure is "not an easy intimacy") and, naturally, elegance of art. Other Botanical Art Works There are several other examples of recent botanical juvenilia notable for their artwork or literary nature: Barbara Bash's Desert giant: The world of the saguaro cactus (Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, published by Little, Brown and Co., Boston, 1989, [32] pp., ISBN 0-316-08301-1, $14.95, Tree Tales series, grades 1-5) is a colorful and fascinating account of the life history and ecosystem of saguaro, Carnegiea gigantea, called Cerceus giganteus in the book. It is similar to but more informative than Holmes's The 100-year-old cactus discussed above. Richard Mabey, author of various adult works on the British countryside and conservation plus the recent The flowers of Kew: 350 years offlower paintings from the Royal Botanic Garden (1989- see Taxon 38: 627), wrote and Clare Roberts illustrated a charming picture book, Oak &amp; company (Greenwillow Books, New York, 1983, [26] pp., color endpaper illus., grades 1-3). This follows an oak tree and its associated plants and especially animals from its acorn beginning to its death 282 years later. Lena Anderson's (see also below on Bjork) children's poetry and accompanying quaint quasi- botanical artwork, originally published in Swedish, are now available in English versions with new verses by Mary Q. Steele. Steele's Anna's summer songs (Greenwillow Books, New York, 1988, 28, [4] pp., color endpaper illus., ISBN 0-688-07180-5, $12.95, ISBN 0-688-07181-3, PLB, $12.88, grades k-3) is a collection of poems about a fern, iris, chives, and 11 other plants. Steele's Anna's garden songs (Ibid., 1989, 31, [ 1 ] pp., color endpaper illus., ISBN 0-688-08217-3, $11.95, ISBN 0-688-08218- 1, PLB, $11.88, grades k-3) is a collection of 14 humorous poems about beet, potato, radish, pea, and other garden plants. These books are based on, respectively, Anderson's Majas alfabet (Raben &amp; Sj6gren, Stockholm, 1984) and Majas lilla grina (Ibid., 1987). The real charm of both efforts is Anderson's artwork. The plants are mostly accurately drawn, though the garden plants dwarf their Anna in wonderland. Robert Frost's Birches (Henry Holt and Co., New York, 1988, [32] pp., ISBN 0-8050-0570-6, $13.95, grades k-6) is the first picture book version of Frost's famous 1916 poem. Ed Young's subtle, often abstract paintings are part of this quasi-botanical work. However, this union of text and art is not felicitous. I avoid mention of most recent picture books for preschoolers and first graders because they are usually of little or no botanical interest. However, three works are exceptional and deserve mention: George Ella Lyon's alphabet book, A B Cedar: An alphabet of trees (Orchard Books, New York, 1989, [32] pp., ISBN 0-531-05795-X, $14.95, ISBN 0-531-08395-0, PLB, $14.99, grades ps-l), with very stylized illustrations by Tom Parker, is unusual in using not only multiracial hands to hold tree 85</page><page sequence="6">TAXON VOLUME 39 branches, but also some tropical examples, for instance, teak, xolisma (sic), and zebrawood. Along with such familiar examples as ginkgo, oak, and willow, this mixed bag may not be useful for learning the alphabet, and certainly not for any known flora. Gisela Jernigan's One green mesquite tree (Harbinger house, Tucson, 1988, [22] pp., ISBN 0-943173- 01-9, hardbound, $11.95, ISBN 0-943173-07-8, paperbound, $5.95, grades ps-1), is a counting book set to verse. This delightful book has ten scenes of desert life in the American Southwest, each scene with a plant and an animal, the whole representing numbers from one to 20, namely, mesquite/cicadas, saguaros/martins, chollas/wrens, palo verdes/bumblebees, ocotillos/hummingbirds, prickly pears/des- ert tortoises, yuccas/yucca moths, devil's claws/bighorn sheep, creosote bushes/kangaroo rats, and barrel cacti/bats. For once, plants get equal treatment with animals in a biology book! The ten beautiful plates by E. Wesley Jernigan are botanically accurate and a very good rival for those of the famous print-maker Henry Evans. Natal'ia Romanova's Once there was a tree (Dial Books, New York, 1985, [i], 24, [1] pp., color endpaper illus., ISBN 0-8037-0235-3, $11.95, grades ps-l) was adapted by Anne Schwartz from Romanova's Chei eto pen'? (Detskaya Literatura, Moscow, 1983); there is also a German version, Unser Baumstumpf(K. Thienemanns Verlag, Stuttgart, 1985). This intriguing book follows the ecology of a tree stump over time. Gennady Spirin's beautiful, dark and rich coloration will appeal to afi- cionados of gloom. The work is a didactic, ecological fable that, according to Leonard S. Marcus (New York Times Book Rev., 10 Nov. 1985, p. 39), to at least Soviet readers is "a reaffirmation of the collectivist ideal." Works such as those discussed so far are examples of art botanical juvenilia, their artistry being as important as the text matter, indeed sometimes their raison d'etre. Of the highest order are the works by Lerner, Dowden, Mabey/Roberts, Frost/Young, Jernigan/Jernigan, and Romanova/Spirin. Unfor- tunately, original artwork is more frequent in juvenilia for the lower grades and thus is more likely to be missed or unappreciated by professional biologists. The works of Lerner and Dowden, and their collaborators, are atypical in having indices and in using scientific names of plants. Documentary Botanical Works-Stand-alone Efforts Even more common than art botanical juvenilia is artless botanical juvenilia, both figuratively and literally. These usually have clear diagrams, mostly excellent photographs, which are often color nowadays, and straightforward text. Compared to artistic juvenilia such as the aforenoted, most rank as somewhat pedestrian though certainly competent efforts. In the best works, for example, Overbeck's Carnivorous plants, Johnson's Mosses and Mushrooms, and Wexler's books mentioned below, spec- tacular photography sometimes approaches art. Artless juvenilia may be stand-alone efforts on a specific topic or, particularly, comprise parts of a series. For various reasons the following stand-alone works are noteworthy. Most of these selections have only black-and-white illustrations, which is curious for juvenilia published in the 1980s. Jerome Wexler is a prolific contributor to juvenilia, notably botanical literature, both as an author and especially as a photographer (see also below on Selsam). The following works by author/photog- rapher Wexler contain some very excellent photography: Secrets of the Venus's fly trap (Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., New York, 1981, [64] pp., B&amp;W illus., grades 3-5), a very good, but unindexed account of its morphology and trap mechanism; From spore to spore: Ferns and how they grow (Ibid., 1985, 48 pp., grades 3-6), an elaborate photographic documentation that ferns are sites for sori, complete with high- magnification color photographs, an index, and use of scientific names; Flowers, fruits, seeds (Prentice- Hall Books for Young Readers, New York, 1987, [33] pp., ISBN 0-13-322397-3, $12.95, grades ps- 2), a beautiful color atlas lacking an index or scientific names, and having very simple text with some imprecise terminology. Wexler also contributed superb photographs to two works by Patricia Lauber: From flower toflower: Animals and pollination (Crown Publishers, New York, 1986, [vi], 57 pp., B&amp;W illus., ISBN 0-517- 55539-5, $13.95, grades 3-6); Seeds pop, stick, glide* (Ibid., 1981, [vi], 57 pp., B&amp;W illus., ISBN 0-517-54165-3, hardbound, $12.95, ISBN 0-517-56348-7, paperbound, $5.95, grades 2-4). Both are indexed but lack scientific names. These lucidly written books treat two perennially favorite topics in botanical juvenilia: pollination biology and dispersal ecology. Joan Elma Rahn's Plants that changed history (Atheneum, New York, 1982, [i], vii, 144 pp., B&amp;W illus., ISBN 0-689-30940-6, $10.95) and its sequel More plants that changed history (Ibid., 1985, viii, 126 pp., B&amp;W illus., ISBN 0-689-31099-4, $11.95) both consider the influence that the pursuit and cultivation of various plants have had on civilization and nations. The 1982 book treats cereals, spices, 86</page><page sequence="7">FEBRUARY 1990 sugarcane, breadfruit, potatoes, and coal forests, whereas the sequel deals with papyrus and paper, rubber, tea, tobacco, and opium. Both books have an index and bibliography, and a wealth of infor- mation for the intended grade level (5 up). However, the dense text and meager illustration (no photos and Rahn's simple diagrams) unfortunately result in a most unprepossessing format. Darrel D. Young's Wild plants you can eat (Julian Messner, New York, 1983, 112 pp., B&amp;W illus., grades 5 up), with a glossary, bibliography, index, and scientific names, contains fascinating information on using the edible parts of wild plants such as milkweed, dandelion, and burdock. However, the black-and-white photographs are only of average quality, and there is inadequate warning of poisonous look-alikes. Anita Holmes's Cactus: The all-American plant (Four Winds Press, New York, 1982, xiii, 178 pp., B&amp;W illus., ISBN 0-590-07402-4, $14.95, grades 7 up) is a very nice, detailed treatment of the morphology, taxonomy (to the subtribal level!), ecology, cultivation, and uses of cacti, complete with glossary, bibliography, and index, plus recipes and a list of institutions of the Southwest where one may observe cacti. I like this work a lot (it received the American Library Association's "Notable Children's Book" award), but due to its scholarly appearance, lack of photographs, and rather simple illustrations by Joyce Ann Powzyk, I bet that kids do not. One example of gardening juvenilia will suffice. Christina Bj6rk's Linnea's windowsill garden* (R&amp;S Books, Stockholm, 1988, 59 pp., color endpaper illus., ISBN 91-29-59064-7, $12.95, from Farrar, Straus and Giroux-see Appendix), with pictures by Lena Anderson (see also above), was translated by Joan Sandin from Bj6rk's Linnea planterar: Kdrnor, fr6n och annat (Raben &amp; Sj6gren, Stockholm, 1978). Rather curiously old-fashioned with only green and black-and-white illustrations, this inter- esting, but unindexed book nicely introduces the growth and cultivation of plants and has much worthwhile information on creating and caring for a home garden. Documentary Botanical Works-Series on Biology and General Science Many biological juvenilia comprise encyclopedia-style series with offerings on both plants and animals, including agricultural topics. One of the most noteworthy series is the A Lerner Natural Science Book series published by Lerer Publications Co. (see Appendix). Intended for grades four through ten, the entire series (11 books on plants, 25 on animals) comprises adaptations from various Japanese juvenilia. All works sport excellent and intricate color photographs and cost $12.95 trade/ PLB (the series is being reprinted paperbound, $4.95). All eleven botanical works are indexed, have a glossary (usually 2-3 pages), are 48 pages long, and were checked by professional biologists. Un- fortunately, scientific names are used only in Mosses, Mushrooms, and Morning glories. The botanical contributions are by Sylvia A. Johnson and Cynthia Overbeck, my favorite works being Carnivorous plants, Mosses, and Mushrooms. Cynthia Overbeck's Carnivorous plants (1982, 48 pp., ISBNs 0-8225-1470-2, PLB, 0-8225-9535- 4, paperbound) is an adaptation of Shokucha shokubutsu (1975) by Kiyoshi Shimizu, as translated by Chaim Uri, and includes treatments of Venus fly trap, sundew, pitcher plant, bladderwort, butterwort, and waterwheel, and how their active and passive trap mechanisms work. Shimizu's color photographs are very fine and the ones of waterwheel (Aldrovanda vesiculosa, Droseraceae) are the best I have seen, indeed a most significant contribution to the "very limited literature" on this monotypic plant lamented by B. E. Juniper et al. in The carnivorous plants (1989: 17--see entry under "Notices"). Overbeck has three other botanical works in this series: Cactus (1982, 48 pp., ISBNs 0-8225-1469-0, PLB, 0-8225- 9556-7, paperbound) focuses on the morphology and autecology of American cacti and is adapted from a translation by Chaim Uri of Shabo Hani's Saboten nofushigi (1975), with his fine photographs. Similarly, How seeds travel (1982, 48 pp., ISBN 0-8225-1474-5), is an adaptation of a translation by Uri of Hani's Tane no yukue (1978), also with his photographs, whereas Sunflowers (1981, 48 pp., ISBN 0-8225-1457-5), on the life history of this plant, is an adaptation of a translation by Joe and Hiroko McDermott of Morizo Shirako's Himawari no kansatsu (1973), with photographs by Susumu Kanozawa. Sylvia A. Johnson's Mosses (1983, 48 pp., ISBNs 0-8225-1482-6, PLB, 0-8225-9535-4, paperbound) is an adaptation of Koke no sekai (1981) by Masana Izawa, as translated by Yasuhiko Katagiri, and describes mosses and liverworts, with Izawa's superb color photographs. Johnson's Mushrooms (1982, 48 pp., ISBN 0-8225-1473-7), an adaptation of a translation by Chaim Uri of Izawa's Kinoko no sekai (1977), has equally fine photographs by Izawa of mushrooms and other fungi. Johnson's other botanical works in this series include: Apple trees (1983, 48 pp., ISBN 0-8225-1479-6), an adaptation of a translation by Uri of Ringo, kudamono no himitsu (1976) by author/photographer Hiroo Koike; 87</page><page sequence="8">TAXON VOLUME 39 Potatoes (1984, 47, [1] pp., ISBN 0-8225-1459-1), an adaptation of a translation by Hiroko and Joseph McDermott of Jagaimo (1981) by author/photographer Masaharu Suzuki; and Rice (1985, 46, [2] pp., ISBN 0-8225-1466-4), an adaptation of a translation by Wesley M. Jacobson of Ine no issho (1973) by author/photographer Noboru Moriya. These three "agr books" cover the structure, growth, and cultivation of the aforenoted plants. More botanical and morphological are Morning glories (1985, 48 pp., ISBN 0-8225-1462-1), an adaptation of a translation by Chaim Uri of Shuhei Nakayama's Asagao (1972), with photographs by Yuko Sato, and How leaves change (1986, 47, [1] pp., ISBNs 0-8225- 1483-4, PLB, 0-8225-9513-3, paperbound), an adaptation of a translation by Phyllis H. Larson of author/photographer Yuko Sato's Koyo nofushigi (1985). To show the extent of the excellent A Lerner Natural Science Book series I list here the 25 zoological titles: Jane Dallinger's Grasshoppers (1981) and Spiders (1981); Dallinger and Sylvia A. Johnson's Frogs &amp; toads (1982); Dallinger and Cynthia Overbeck's Swallowtail butterflies (1982); Johnson's Bats (1985), Beetles (1982), Chirping insects (1986), Coral reefs (1984), Crabs 1982, Elephant seals (1989), Fireflies (1986), Inside an egg (1982), Ladybugs (1983), Mantises (1984), Penguins (1981), Silkworms (1982), Snails (1982), Tree frogs (1986), and Wasps (1984); and Overbeck's Ants (1982), Cats (1983), Dragonflies (1982), Elephants (1981), Lions (1981), and Monkeys: The Japanese macaques (1981). A similar and more recent series, also with superb color photography, but with much less text and aimed at a lower reading level, namely grades two through five, is the Stopwatch Books series published by Silver Burdett Co. (see Appendix) [also A &amp; C Black (Publishers), 35 Bedford Row, London WC 1R 4JH]. All works are indexed and [i], 24, [1] pages long, and cost $6.95 trade, $9.96 PLB. Botanical titles are author/photographer Barrie Watts's Apple tree (1986, ISBNs 0-382-09440-9, 0-382-09436- 0, PLB), Mushroom (1986, ISBNs 0-382-09301-1, 0-382-09287-2, PLB, Dandelion (1987, ISBNs 0-382-09442-5, 0-382-09438-7, PLB), Potato (1987, ISBN 0-382-09528-6, ISBN 0-382-09527-8, PLB), and Christine Back (author) and Watts's (photographer) Bean and plant (1986, ISBNs 0-382- 09300-3, 0-382-09286-4, PLB). Still another new series, also for grades two through five, is the A Carolrhoda Nature Watch Book series, with only one botanical title so far. Claudia Schnieper's An apple tree through the year (Car- olrhoda Books, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 1987, 48 pp., ISBN 0-87614-248-X, hardbound, $12.95, ISBN 0-87614-248-X, paperbound, $5.95) is a translation by Gerd Kirchner of Schnieper's Der Apfelbaum im Jahreslauf(Kinderbuchverlag Reich Luzern AG, Lucerne, Switzerland, 1982). This has excellent photographs by Othmar Baumli and also a glossary and index. This book is one of the best apple juvenilia (others discussed here are by Johnson, Selsam, and Watts). Yet another, but older series on botanical juvenilia is the untitled one by William Morrow and Co. (see Appendix), with text by Millicent E. Selsam (born 1912) and photographs by Jerome Wexler, both very prolific contributions to biological juvenilia (see also above for these persons). Also intended for grades two through five, the books in this series have clear prose and many excellent photographs. However, the handful of color photographs in each book alas now makes the series rather dated. Botanical works by author Selsam and photographer Wexler in this series, now mostly out-of-print, include (in chronological order): Milkweed (1967, 48 pp.); Maple tree (1968, 46, [2] pp.); Peanut* (1969, 46, [2] pp.); The tomato and other fruit vegetables (1970, 47, [1] pp.); The carrot and other root vegetables (1971, 48 pp.); Vegetables from stems and leaves (1972, 47, [1] pp.); The apple and other fruits (1973, 48 pp.); Bulbs, corms, and such (1974, 48 pp.); Popcorn (1976, 48 pp.); The amazing dandelion* (1977, 46, [2] pp); Mimosa: The sensitive plant* (1978, 48 pp.); Eat the fruit, plant the seed (1980, 48 pp.); Cotton (1982, 48 pp., ISBN 0-688-01499-2, $12.95, ISBN 0-688-01500-X, PLB, $12.88); Catnip (1983, 47, [1] pp.); Mushrooms (1986, 48 pp., B&amp;W illus., ISBN 0-688-06248-2, $12.95, ISBN 0-688-06249-0, PLB, $12.88). The three most recent books have indices; most of the others do not. The asterisked items received the American Library Association's "Notable Children's Book" award. Selsam and Wexler also cooperated on Play with plants (1978 rev. ed., 95, [1] pp.) and The plants we eat (1981 rev. ed., 125, [2] pp., B&amp;W illus.). Both are well indexed and have Wexler's superior photographs replacing the simple pictures in the original editions (1949, 1955, respectively). A somewhat different sort of "artless juvenilia" is the textbook-type or reference-style work, which is usually also part of a general series on science, and to which an often nameless staff of illustrators and photographers have contributed. As many the aforecited examples of "artless juvenilia," the following also have clear diagrams, mostly excellent color photographs, and straightforward text that make for very attractive and technically appealing packages. The following are listed in ascending grade level. 88</page><page sequence="9">FEBRUARY 1990 David Black and Anthony Huxley's Plants (Facts on File Publications, New York, 1985, 64 pp., ISBN 0-8160-1065-X, $14.95, The World of Science series, grades 3-6, also Orbis Publishing, London) covers the diversity, growth, ecology, and uses of plants and fungi and has a glossary and index. The book has beautiful photography but oversimplified text. Mark Lambert's Plant life (Warwick Press, New York, 1983, 91, [4] pp., ISBN 0-531-09216-X, $8.90, A Gateway Fact Book, grades 4-6) covers organismal diversity and ecology. It lacks a glossary but is indexed. David Burnie's Tree (Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1988, 63, [1] pp., ISBN 0-394-89617-3, $12.95, ISBN 0-394-99617-8, PLB, $13.99, Eyewitness Books series, grades 5 up), with an index but no glossary, is a first-class account on the anatomy, morphology, growth, ecology, and forestry economics of trees. The work is reminiscent of Roger Phillips's excellent adult picture series also published by Random House (see Taxon 38: 629). Lionel Bender's Plants (Gloucester Press, New York, 1988, [i], 36 pp., ISBN 0-531-17094-2, $12.40, Today's World series, grades 7-9) is on plant and fungal diversity and has a brief glossary and index. Various figures have the inevitable ambiguities and inaccuracies in works of this sort. World Book staffs The plant world (World Book, Chicago, Illinois, 1985, 159 pp., no ISBN, The World Book Encyclopedia of Science series, not available individually, series ISBN 0-7166-3192-X, 8-vol. set $90.00, grades 7-12) is an extensive treatment of the plant and fungal kingdoms, with emphasis on ecology and plant products. This has a seven-page glossary and detailed index and an apparently high level of accuracy. The Fascination with Carnivorous Plants Carnivorous plants have received much attention even since Charles Darwin's Insectivorous plants (1875, 2nd 1888 rev. by Francis Darwin). The carnivorous plants (1989) by B. E. Juniper et al. is the most recent contribution, a superb and most scholarly treatise (see entry under "Notices"). However, juvenilia on plant carnivory has not been neglected. Mentioned above are Lerner's Pitcher plants, an art book, Overbeck's Carnivorous plants, a fine color atlas, and Wexler's Secrets of the Venus's fly trap, a black-and-white photographic documentation. There are at least seven other, fairly recent, but out-of-print juvenile books on carnivorous plants. These are all much less impressive pictorially than the aforenoted, largely because other than Bentley's work, they are only in black-and-white. As a minimum, all seven books treat the prerequisite American carnivorous plants, namely, Venus fly trap, bladderworts, butterworts, sundews, and pitcher plants. Incidentally, of these ten juvenilia on carniv- orous plants, Juniper et al.'s recent work cites only Overbeck's atlas. Lynn and Gray Poole's Insect-eating plants (Thomas Y. Crowell Co., New York, 1963, [vii], 87, [1] pp., grades 4-7) is indexed and has mediocre sketches by Christine Sapieha. Anabel Dean's Plants that eat insects: A look at carnivorous plants (Lerner Publications Co., Min- neapolis, 1977, 32 pp.) has simple sketches by L'Enc Matte. The novelty of this very elementary, unindexed work is that it also covers fungi predaceous on nematodes. Linna Bentley's Plants that eat animals (McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York, 1968, The Bodley Head, London, 1967, 31, [1] pp., color endpaper illus., A McGraw-Hill Natural Science Picture Book, grades 4-6) is artistically much better. In picture-book format, 25 x 19 cm., this has rather stylized color and black-and-white illustrations by Colin Threadgall. The text is skimpy and the book unin- dexed. John Frederick Water's Carnivorous plants (Franklin Watts, New York, 1974, [viii], 60, [1] pp., A First Book) has illustrations borrowed from various sources. It has a bibliography and index. Jack Harvey ("J. H.") Prince's Plants that eat animals (Thomas Nelson, Publishers, Nashville, 1979, 92 pp., grades 7-12) has the author's unimpressive diagrams and photographs and also a glossary, brief bibliography, and index. Prince treats carnivorous plants, predaceous fungi, and bromeliad tank plants, which are curiously called "vase traps" (the genera mentioned are not carnivorous-see entry for Slack under "Reviews"). Joan Elma Rahn's Traps &amp; lures in the living world (Atheneum, New York, 1980, [vii], 94 pp., grades 5-8) is broader yet, treating not only the usual carnivorous plants but also trap flowers and fungi predaceous on nematodes. The book, with several photographs and many very prosaic diagrams by the author, has a glossary and index. Philip Goldstein's Animals and plants that trap (Holiday House, New York, 1974, 118, [10] pp.) covers the same topics. This work has many good illustrations by Matthew Kalmenoff and several 89</page><page sequence="10">TAXON VOLUME 39 fine photographs borrowed from various sources. It is also indexed and has a detailed five-page bibliography. Teaching Botany to Children Any discussion of botanical juvenilia would be incomplete without mention of books for teaching science to juveniles. The latest is Botany for all ages: Learning about nature through activities using plants ["Discovering nature . ." on cover], by Jorie Hunken and The New England Wild Flower Society (Globe Pequot Press, Chester, Connecticut, 1989, xviii, 157, [1] pp., B&amp;W illus. exc. color cover, ISBN 0-87106-616-5, paperbound, $11.95). This fine, and lucidly written effort has a 24-part introduction on "teaching with plants" and 102 "activities for learning about plants," that is, exper- iments or exercises involving morphology, physiology, and ecology (e.g., nectar guides), with concluding appendix on activities for different age levels, plus glossary, bibliography, and index. An earlier, still useful contribution is Selsam and Wexler's Play with plants (1978 rev. ed.) mentioned above. General Observations on Botanical Juvenilia From my viewpoint as a professional botanist, the best of biological juvenilia are indexed, perhaps have a glossary, use both scientific and common names of organisms, the former at least in the index or in an appendix, have accurate scientific text that has been checked by competent authority, and have a minimum of anthropocentrism and especially anthropomorphism, that is, no cute plants with faces. These traits certainly characterize nearly all of Dowden's works, many of Lerner's more recent contributions, and some of the documentary "artless juvenilia" discussed above. As with recordings of classical music, there are certain warhorse or chestnut topics in botanical juvenilia, for example, mushrooms, dandelions, cacti (especially saguaro, Carnegiea gigantea), apple trees, weeds, vegetables, flowers, pollination, fruits, seeds, seed dispersal, and, naturally, carnivorous plants. Inspection of the aforenoted titles reveals this phenomenon, but this is only the tip of the iceberg compared to what one finds on the library shelf. With biological juvenilia, as in other media, there is much emphasis on familiar, safe topics. While some of the examples ofjuvenilia discussed above are at a very elementary level (see "grade" notations above), most are at an appreciably higher, even "young adult" level. Several, for instance Lerner's Plant families and Pitcher plants and Selsam's Tree flowers illustrated by Lerner, would not be out of place in a college taxonomy class to depict the 22 families treated. Johnson's Mosses and Mushrooms and Overbeck's Carnivorous plants could be used similarly. Because of its excellent photography showing the growth of a mushroom, I also use Watts's Mushroom book in my biology class for non-majors, with an aside to the students not to be offended by the elementary text. And certainly none of Dowden's works would be an embarrassment in a taxonomy or morphology class. The advantage of using juvenilia in teaching is that such works are very visual--long on pictures and short on words, the reverse of treatments in adult and technical works. Incidentally, juvenilia as well as college biology textbooks nowadays are mostly very slick produc- tions, the inevitable result of the pervasive influences of living in this television and visual-medium age. Perusing various books on a library shelf is very instructive to see the many changes over the years, for instance, works now being mostly or entirely in color compared to ones being mostly or entirely in black-and-white just a decade or two ago. Moreover, the in-print life of biological juvenilia is very short, although the art works such as Lerer's and Dowden's remain much longer in print. Although this discussion has focused on American juvenilia, I presume the situation regarding non- English language juvenilia is similar. Indeed, one Russian work (Romanova's), one Swiss work (Schnie- per's), three Swedish works (Bj6rk's, Steele's), and 11 Japanese works (the Lerner Natural Science Book series) were specially adapted for the American market. Interestingly, one can see in some of these their foreign origin, for instance, apples priced in Swiss francs or picked by Japanese workers. Biology books for juveniles naturally receive regular notice or review in journals of library science (e.g., Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, The Horn Book Magazine, School Library Journal), newspapers, and popular magazines, but get extremely little attention in professional journals for biologists. The main exception is Quarterly Review of Biology, which has a "For tyros &amp; laics" section; Natural History Book Reviews sometimes also treats such literature. Botanical juvenilia can also be found in public libraries, in the Dewey Decimal System filed under the J570's for general life sciences, J580's for botanical sciences, J590's for zoological sciences, J630's for agriculture, and J220's and J390's for biblical and folklore plants. Works such as the aforelisted, both the art book category consisting of contributions such as Lerner's and Dowden's, and the more documentary category 90</page><page sequence="11">FEBRUARY 1990 consisting of works such as Selsam-Wexler's or the Stopwatch Books and Lerner Natural Science Books series, certainly should be in the library of any botanical garden or herbarium that has a public education program. And biologists may even care to purchase books like these to spread the botanical word to young friends and relatives.

Hist. Educ. Soc. Bull. 18: 6-34. (2) I have now seen Louis Untermeyer's Roses (Golden Press, New York, 1970, [27] pp.). This reproduces many of Dowden's beautiful paintings from her and Thomson's Roses, has a five-page introduction by Untermeyer, and offers 12 poetry selections from Robert Burs, Edmund Spenser, and eight other poets. Interestingly, both books comment on Gertrude Stein's famous "rose is a rose is a rose is a rose" (1913). Poet Untermeyer states that this "statement is not as flat or inaccurate as it seems" (p. [8]), whereas botanical artist Dowden considers this "a phrase as inaccurate as it is arresting" (p. 7). The Dowden-Thomson Roses, incidentally, has seven pages dealing with other mem- bers of Rosaceae, uses scientific names, and has an index. Both this and Dowden's related-format The secret life of the flowers are variously classified as a children's book or an adult book. (3) The following reference makes some conclusions similar to mine and on page 11 lists additional sources for reviews of scientific juvenilia: Carr, J. 1982. Clarity in science writing. Appraisal: Children's Sci. Books 15(1): 4-13. [On juvenilia.] (4) Relevant to the last paragraph of the text, I have found Appraisal: Science Books for Young People [1967-date, title as Appraisal: Children's Science Books for vols. 1-13, 1967-1980, 15(1), 1982] by far the best of the library journals devoted to this topic. Appraisal has dual reviews of a book from the viewpoints of a librarian and a specialist, who each rate the work from "unacceptable" to "ex- cellent." 92</page></plain_text>
