<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW DECEMBER 1950 NOTES AND NEWS THE triennial Joint Meeting of the Clas- sical Association, the Hellenic Society, and the Roman Society will be held in Cambridge from 9 to 16 August 1951. The first International Congress of Classical Studies, organized by the Feddration Internationale des Associa- tions d'EItudes Classiques, was held in Paris, contemporaneously with the ninth Congress of Historical Studies, in the week beginning 28 August. A very full programme (too full, some thought) had been arranged on the lines indi- cated in an earlier note (lxiv. i): a series of rapports surveyed progress and possibilities in selected fields of scholar- ship, and these were followed by shorter communications dealing with particular problems and enterprises within them. A printed report of the proceedings will be published in due course. British representation, among the speakers-and among the hearers, was regrettably small. It is intended that the next Congress should be held in 1954 in Copenhagen. One function of the Feddration Inter- nationale des Associations d'I'tudes Classiques, to whose meetings representa- tives are sent by the constituent societies, is the making of recommendations to Unesco for the use of the funds (un- fortunately very limited) which are at its disposal for the subvention of works of scholarship. Among the publications which have received subsidies by this channel are the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae, L' Anne'e Philologique, Fasti Archaeologici, the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, and the J.H.S. The Archiv fiir griechische Lexiko- graphie, directed by Professor Bruno Snell of Hamburg, which was men- tioned in C.R. lxii. 98, has changed its title to Thesaurus Linguae Graecae. Its collections will not be printed as a whole, but will be maintained in slip form for consultation by scholars and used for the publication of lexica for particular authors. The publishing house of Teubner has agreed to provide at cost price ioo or 120 sets of sheets of all the Greek texts which it prints or reprints. The promoters of the The- saurus would be grateful if other pub- lishers of Greek texts would extend the same favour, which will save both time and expense in the production of this instrument of scholarship. Preliminary work for the Homer Lexicon is already well advanced. 'Rechtlinien und Probeartikel fiir ein Lexikon zu Homer, Hesiod und dem alteren Epos' has been prepared for the guidance of collaborators, and the material is ready to be sent to them. Further offers of assistance will be wel- come, and scholars who are interested and willing to collaborate in this work, or in the Lexicon to Hippocrates which is to follow it, are invited to communi- cate with Professor Snell (Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, Seminar fiir klassische Philologie, Bornplatz 2", Hamburg 13). On 30 September 1949 Mr. E. Lobel communicated to the British Academy a paper entitled 'A Greek Historical Drama', dealing with some previously unpublished papyrus fragments. This paper, containing the text of the frag- ments and a short introduction, has now been separately published by the Oxford University Press. The fragments raise interesting problems ; for, meagre as they are, they make it clear that the play had for its theme the usurpation by Gyges of the throne of Lydia, and met- rical and linguistic considerations both suggest that it was pre-Sophoclean, and probably pre-Aeschylean. Some modi- fications may be needed in accepted ideas about the scope of Attic drama. A correspondent writes: 'This year marks the centenary of the birth of 4598.33</page><page sequence="2">82 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW Dr. Jane Harrison, one of the most famous of women Hellenists, and it is hoped to celebrate the occasion by some volume dedicated to her memory. She was a discoverer, a real pioneer. Her Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion were exactly what they set out to be. They gave to the student about to embark on the subject of Greek Religion just the guidance without which he would be sure to go astray. Almost all previous books on Greek Religion had been misled by the over- poweringly strong influence of the purely literary classic tradition, with its clear- cut anthropomorphic Olympians and its immense array of poets. Miss Harri- son based herself on the evidence of archaeology and the records of ancient cults, all of which she interpreted with sympathetic historical imagination. Her second book, Themis, brought in fresh light from anthropological parallels to illustrate the movements of the simple tribal mind on which the foundations of Greek religion were laid, and to explain such ideas as O4c'Ls, 1K'?, votOS, dyo, and the like. She was a most inspiring teacher and colleague, and many scholars, among them F. M. Cornford and Gilbert Murray, have testified to the immense debt they owed to her." We are asked to announce that it is proposed to commemorate the work of G. M. Columba (1840-1947), Professor of Ancient History in the University of Palermo, and that a committee has been formed in Sicily for that purpose and has published a memoir of Columba by Professor Biagio Pace of the University of Rome, with a bibliography of Col- umba's writings. It is intended that the memorial should take the form of the republication of some of the rarer works of scholarship on the history of Ancient Sicily. Subscriptions are being received by Professor Bruno Lavagnini of the University of Palermo. A new quarterly journal of Ancient History, Historia, has made its appear- ance, published in Baden-Baden under the direction of an international com- mittee and the editorship of Dr. Gerold Walser and Dr. Karl Stroheker. The annual subscription is DM. 40. The first number contains articles on 'The Re- form of the Roman Constitution in 367/6 B.C.' (K. von Fritz), 'The Date and Meaning of the Vettius Affair' (L. R. Taylor), and 'Christliche Geschichts- apologetik in der Krisis des r6mischen Reiches' (J. Straub), and reports on ' Etat actuel de la question constan- tinienne, 1939/49' (A. Piganiol), 'Neue Ausgrabungen in Russland' (A. Mon- heim), and 'Die neue Germanicus- Inschrift von Magliano ' (H. Nesselhauf) : there are also reviews and notes. Sub- scribers will receive as a Sonderheft a classified bibliography of work on Ancient History published in the years 1940-9. We have received the first number of the Philosophical Quarterly, the new journal, edited by Professor T. M. Knox of St. Andrews, which the Scots Philo- sophical Club has inaugurated in its jubilee year: the annual subscription price is ?i. The policy of the journal is to publish work of high academic stand- ard, contributed from any part of the world, in any branch of philosophy; the present composition of the editorial committee, the Professors of Philosophy in the four Scottish Universities, is a guarantee that Ancient Philosophy will not receive less than its proper place. Two items in the first issue are of parti- cular interest to classical readers-an article on 'The Platonic Choice of Lives', by Professor A. S. Ferguson, and the first part of a survey, by Mr. D. J. Allan, of work on Greek Philo- sophy (from Thales to Cicero) published in the years 1945-9.</page></plain_text>
