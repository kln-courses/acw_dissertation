<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROCK-PAINTING ANALYSIS PATRICIA VINNICOMBE INTRODUCTION In an interim report on the recording of rock- paintings from a limited area of the Drakensberg (Vinnicombe, 1967), reference was made to an analyti- cal classification of the paintings at present being undertaken. The system employed for this analysis is the result of discussions with many people, but owes its origin to Dr. C. A. Schoute-Vanneck, now of the Department of Physics and Chemistry at Natal University, Durban. His precise and methodical field-work set a worthy example, and the attributes he suggested for a pro- jected analysis of the paintings recorded in 1958 form the basis of the present scheme. Mr. B. D. Malan, then of the Archaeological Survey, Johannesburg, later drew attention to the work of F. D. McCarthy on Aboriginal art in Arnhem Land (McCarthy, 1960) and encouraged an analysis on a similar basis. Further refinement and elaboration were suggested by Mr. P. Ozanne of the Department of Archaeology, University of Ghana, who outlined the application of statistical methods (Spaulding, 1960), made valuable suggestions for the objective assessment of such criteria as action or movement, and elucidated the intricacies of the punch-card system. Dr. N. D. Jago, Department of Zoology, University of Ghana, patiently explained, to a mind not familiar with any of the disciplines involved, the principles of numerical taxonomy (Sneath &amp; Sokal, 1962) while more recently, Mr. J. Yellen, of Harvard University, U.S.A., has discussed other applicable trends and techniques in the field of analysis by seriation (Rowe, 1961; Gardin, 1958). In order that other workers in the field of rock-art analysis might build upon whatever is worthy in this system, and avoid repeating the mistakes, the methods adopted are here set out in detail. In each instance, the criteria are defined as objectively as possible, and time- and labour-saving devices for assessing the attributes are introduced wherever practicable. METHOD Each painting is recorded on a separate card unless there is repetition of the same subject displaying the same features within a given group, in which case, the number of repetitions is clearly noted. Each card is labelled with the valley symbol (A-Z), followed by the number of the site within that valley (1). In addition, each tracing sheet or photograph, as well as each individual figure recorded, is numbered and listed. For example, A2/1 (1) records valley name and site number/sheet or photograph number (painting number). The attributes of the paintings are then divided under twenty-three main headings, each of which is discussed below. I. Subject Initially, the paintings are separated into three principal subjects, human,-animal and miscellaneous, and for easy identification are recorded on differently coloured cards. Anthropomorphic figures are related to whichever subject is predominant, usually to human if the figures are vertical, and animal if they are horizontal, but are later distinguished from these by the application of additional criteria. The miscel- laneous category includes all inanimate objects not directly associated with humans or animals, as well as non-representational art, or signs and symbols the meaning of which is obscure. The attributes are then divided into those which may generally be applied to all three subjects (II-XV), and those which apply specifically to human (XVI-XX), to animal (XXI-XXII), and to miscel- laneous (XXIII). II. Sex Only when genital organs or mammary glands are clearly depicted, are the figures indexed as male or female, the remainder falling under the heading indeterminate. Special note is made in all instances where the male organ is infibulated. The sexes may later be further differentiated by the association of additional attributes, for example, bows, arrows, spears and shields are usually attributed to males, while digging sticks or the presence of young, either carried or suckled, implies females. m. Size The sizes of the paintings are arbitrarily divided into six groups of measurements in centimetres; under 5, 5-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-100, and over 100 centimetres. In each instance, the greatest length of the painting, irrespective of the direction of the axis, is measured. A useful time-saver is a specially prepared ruler marked with the above divisions, and numbered 1-6. The painting is then simply listed according to the group within which it falls, for example, size 1 is a painting less than 5 centimetres long, size 2 is between 5-20 centimetres, etc. IV. Style The vexatious term 'style', impossible to reduce to objective terms, is, for the purposes of the analysis, used to denote whether the painting is monochrome, bichrome, polychrome, or shaded polychrome (Willcox, 1956; Willcox, 1963). Correctly, this should be a subdivision of colour. Shaded polychrome is defined as the intermingling of two or more adjacent colours to produce three or more colours, for example, red and white mixed to become pink. 129 S. Afr. Archaeol. Bull. 22: 129-41.</page><page sequence="2">V. Colour For simplification, the colours have been reduced to five basic hues, white, black, red with its many variations, orange which includes the yellow-red series, and yellow. The colour chart previously described (Vinnicombe, 1960), although still the standard used, has now been related to the Munsell Soil Colour Chart (Munsell, 1954). The principal colours found in the field are covered by hue cards 5 R, 7-5 R, 10 R, 2-5 YR, 5 YR, and 10 YR. The addition of 7-5 YR and 2-5 Y provides refinements of the yellow hues, but since these colours are not common in the area of the present survey, 10 YR sufficed to cover the yellow range. White. On each card, the hues which include the values 6-10/and the chroma /0-5, i.e. the hues in which white predominates, are, for simplification, all designated white, even though they are in fact pale pinkish, pale brownish, or pale yellowish. Pure white hardly exists in the field, and among shaded polychrome paintings in which these high value/low chroma hues mostly occur, clean white pigments are especially difficult to retain. Black. The near-black colours falling within the range 0-1/0-1, are all designated black. Red. The colours on hue cards 5R and 7-5R 2-4/2-8, as also the dark dusky or brownish colours on 10 R 2/2-8, 2-5 YR 2/2-5 and 10 YR 2/2-5, are designated red. Orange. The colours on cards 10 R and 2 5 YR 3-5/6-8, and 5 YR 4-6/6-8, are orange. Yellow. Hue card 10 YR with the values 4-7/and the chroma/6-8, are designated yellow. While there are exceptional outlying colours, the great majority are found to fall within these blocks. The dividing line between red and orange in the marginal cases is not easy to determine, but it is important to draw the distinction because, for instance, the analysis to date reveals that red, to the exclusion of orange, is used to depict figures wearing long karosses, while orange, to the exclusion of red, is used for recent subjects such as horses. VI. Paint The properties of the paint used, as observed on the rock face, fall into three main categories, stain, film and powdery. The first appears as a stain on the rock, that is, no actual film of paint can be detected, and the under- lying rock granulations, though a different colour, have precisely the same texture as the surrounding unpainted rock face. The white paint in this category, often appearing only as a bleach on the rock, dis- appears when dampened. In the second, a film or coating of paint actually covers over the rock granulations, producing a different surface texture from the surrounding unpainted rock face. In some instances, the paint is applied so thickly that actual brush strokes can be discerned, or even felt. The film of paint may occa- sionally be finely cracked, and in some instances apparently peels off in flakes of pure paint not necessarily associated with exfoliation of the rock. The white paint of this category does not disappear when dampened. The third type of paint has a more powdery or chalky texture, and wears badly. It is often seen as a deposit only in the depressions of the rock grain, apparently having worn off the most exposed surfaces. Paintings of horses and cattle are often executed in this medium of paint, and the white pigment dis- appears when dampened. Another feature noted is that pigments which appear predominantly white, but with a greyish tinge when dry, become black when dampened. In my own research, the importance of these details, particularly with regard to superpositions, did not become clear until much of the field-work had already been completed. I therefore mention these properties in some detail with the hope that future observations might clarify, for instance, whether or not the stain type of paint is no more than a residue of the film type after the latter has worn off the rock face (Willcox, 1956: 66). If this is the case, the properties of paint may prove to be some indica- tion of the relative ages of paintings in examples where direct superposition is absent. VII. Execution The paintings are broadly divided into those executed with instruments which are fine, medium or thick. A fine instrument is defined as one which produces lines or details less than 1 millimetres wide, and a thick instrument as one which produces no line or detail less than 5 millimetres wide. A medium instru- ment is therefore one which executes lines of a width between 11 and 5 millimetres. This attribute was initially introduced in an effort to be objective about such subjective assessments as 'delicate' or 'crude'. Since it is possible, however, to produce a crude drawing with a fine instrument, or a sensitive drawing with a coarse one, the criteria are not valid in this respect, and may well be elimi- nated from future classifications. VIII. Condition The condition of the paintings is divided into three main categories, good, fair and poor. The good paintings are those which show all outlines and details complete, even if the colour is somewhat faded. The fair paintings are those which are more or less complete, and, even if fragments are missing or the paint faded, the complete outline can be projected with reasonable accuracy. For example, even if a portion of a leg is missing, it can be seen that the figure is walking, or if a chip of paint is missing from the body, it can be seen that the figure is bending over. The poor paintings are those which 130</page><page sequence="3">are so faded or fragmentary that it is impossible to be sure of the complete appearance or position of the figure. Depictions which are obscured by super- positions are also included in this category. Paintings which have deteriorated to such an extent that it is impossible to deduce whether the subject is human, animal or miscellaneous or from which no useful information can be gained, i.e. to which less than five criteria can be applied, are eliminated from the analysis. Their presence, however, is recorded on an additional sheet. IX. Elevation It is recorded whether the figure is depicted in the lateral view (facing left or right), from the front or back, or as seen from above. Further note is made if the head is turned away from the plane of the body, e.g. a figure walking to the right with the head turned over the shoulder and looking left, or an animal viewed in the lateral posi- tion, with the head turned round to face the onlooker. Instances of twisted perspective are also recorded, for example, if the shoulders of human figures in the lateral view are painted as though seen from the front or back. X. Action The action depicted is divided into two sections, body position, and leg position. Humans and animals are measured according to different standards for which separate templates are prepared. For simplifi- cation, arm positions have been eliminated from the human measurements in this analysis, but should be included if a more precise evaluation of action is required. (i) Human body position This is subdivided broadly into upright, leaning forward, bending over, bending double, bending back- wards, lying down, and upside down. A scale of measurements based on degrees of a circle as shown in figure 1, is drawn on to substantial transparent paper or perspex. This template is laid on top of the figure to be measured, with the centre of the circle in the centre of the buttocks or pubic region in the case of naked figures, and a central point midway along the overall length of clad figures, i.e. halfway across the width of the body, and halfway along a line from the top of the head to the bottom of the lowest heel (fig. 1 A). The datum line 0-180? must be vertical, with O at the top, and 900 to the right for figures facing right, and left for figures facing left. This is achieved by simply reversing the template to suit the direction required. The angle of the body is read at the central point of the neck where this emerges from the shoulders. Positions falling within 10? on either side of 00 are designated A, or upright. Position B, leaning forward (or falling forward), lies between 10? and 500; position C, bending over (or falling over) between 50? and 90?; and position D, bending double, between 90? and 1800. Position E, bending backwards (or falling backwards), is between 270? and 3500. For a figure to be designated position F, lying down, the body (or feet) must lie within the shaded area 50-130' on one side of the vertical, and the feet (or body) within the shaded area 230-310? on the other side of the vertical. The figure may be in the prone or supine position. In position G, upside down, the head falls within the unshaded area 130-230?, with the feet within the unshaded area 310-50?. The legs of figures designated F, lying down, or G, upside down, are not measured again for leg position. (ii) Human leg positions These are subdivided into standing, walking, running, false action, squatting, sitting and kneeling, the three latter measured according to different standards from the former. To estimate standing, walking, running and false action positions, a template is prepared on which 10, 70, 120 and 180? of a circle are marked (fig. 2). Placing the centre of the circle at the centre of the buttock in naked figures, or a central point midway along the total length of clad figures (fig. 2A), the number of degrees between the back of one heel to the back of the next is measured. This gives the length of pace in proportion to the length of leg, and is measured without reference to a vertical line. Where the heels (or in the absence of these, the back of the lowest part of the legs), fall within 10? of the circle, the position is designated A, or standing. Position B, walking, is 700 of the circle; C, running, is 1200; and more than 1200 is designated D, or false action. False action is an extended position of the legs impossible for the human to achieve under normal circumstances (fig. 2 A, B, C, D). The divisions between the various actions depicted are based partly on visual impression (a series of tests was run on ten subjects who were shown stick figures in various positions), and partly on arbitrary decision. An attempt to relate the divisions to actual human action proved unsatisfactory. Measurements based on the maximum paces of ten volunteers, on photo- graphs of athletes in sporting magazines, and on illustrations in Muybridge (Muybridge, 1901) proved that a stride greater than one and a half times the length of the leg, or 750 of a circle, is impossible for the average human body to achieve. Reckoned on actual action, therefore, the human is incapable of taking a stride but 50 greater than the reading given for walking in the above definition, and the greater portion of the readings for running should, strictly speaking, fall under the heading, false action. Clearly, actual movement and visual impression of movement bear little relationship to one another, and since paintings are essentially visual impressions, it was thought misleading to base the subdivisions for this analysis on realistic action (fig. 2 X &amp; Y). For the definition of squatting, sitting and kneeling, positions E, F and G, a circular template is prepared with the line 0-180? as the perpendicular. Half the 131</page><page sequence="4">270 9 180 Fig. 1. Template for measuring human body position, with examples of the action depicted. A = Upright. B = Leaning forward. C = Bending over. D = Bending double. E = Bending backwards. F = Lying down. G = Upside down. circle is divided as in a standard protractor, and the other half a mirror image of this. Readings are taken with the centre of the template held at the centre of the buttocks or pubic region. Where both thighs (i.e. the leg above the knee) fall above the horizontal line 90-90?, the position is E, or squatting (fig. 2 E). Where both thighs fall within the angle 0-1300, the position is F, or sitting (fig. 2 F i), i.e. at least one thigh must lie between 900 and 130? (fig. 2 F ii), otherwise the position would be squatting. Figures in the lateral position in which the hindmost leg is extended, i.e. not bent at the knee, and in which the hindmost thigh falls within the angle 130-1700, are Fig. 2.

Figures seated on horseback are noted separately. Position G, kneeling, is applied to figures in the lateral position only. Both thighs must fall on the same side of the vertical line O-180, with the knee of the hindmost leg bent at an angle of 0-90, i.e. the hindmost leg below the knee must be at more than a right angle to the thigh (fig. 2 G). Leg positions which are not covered by any of the above categories are listed separately. (iii) Animal body position These are subdivided into horizontal, heading upwards, heading downwards, hanging up or down, and upside down. A template is prepared as in figure 3, each quarter circle being a mirror image of the other. Animals facing to the left or to the right are measured with different halves of the same template. The horizontal axis O-O' is the datum from which measurements are made. The centre of the circle is placed on a point mid-way down the rump of the animal, and the angle measured is a line projected from this point to a point mid-way between the top of the shoulders and the bottom of the chest. If this line falls within 100 on either side of the horizontal, the body position is designated A, or horizontal. If it falls between 100 and 80? above the horizontal it is designated B, or heading upwards, while if it falls between 100 and 80? below the horizontal, it is C, or heading downwards. If the line of the body falls within 10? on either side of the vertical line, the posi- 8 0 8 0 x~i ii B~~~ Fig. 3. Template for measuring animal body position. A = Horizontal. B = Heading upwards. C Heading downwards. D = Hanging up or down. E = Upside down. 134</page><page sequence="7">tion is designated D, or hanging up or down. If the body position is A, B or C, but the legs are shown above the body line and not below, the position is designated E, or upside down. (iv) Animal leg positions These are subdivided into standing, walking, running, false action, four-legs-together action, and lying down. Since each species of animal has a different action when in motion, it was decided to limit the deter- mination of animal action to eland and horses only. Photographs in Muybridge (Muybridge, 1899) and horse-racing news items provided material for a series of comparative measurements. The most practicable guide to the action portrayed was found to be the ratio between length of body and length of stride, although in artistic portrayals exaggeration of body-leg proportions affects this ratio. In estimating the length of stride, the distance between the two outside legs is taken, from the back of the hoof of the hindmost leg to the back of the hoof of the foremost leg. The length of body is measured from the rear of the rump excluding the tail to the centre of the shoulder. For each single body unit, the length of stride of a standing animal (A) is taken not to exceed 1-1, for walking (B) 13, and running (C) up to 1-8. It was not found practicable to differentiate between trotting, cantering and galloping. Strides X iv. standhing AXX v -* 11 E I I- 13 running C 1 3-1 8 I Us -sI g false D.

Measurements of the body and stride relationships are progressively increased in a constant ratio. The length of body is represented by the central squared block (10, 20, 30, etc.), and the maximum stride for standing, A, by the space between the body block and the flanking rectangles (11, 22, 33, etc.). The dependent rectangles represent the length of stride for walking, B, (13, 26, 39, etc.), while the maximum stride for running, C, (18, 36, 54, etc.) is represented by the termination of the line. False action, D, is any stride which extends beyond this point. C and D are examples of the unrealistic 'flying gallop' position. E = Four-legs-together action. F = Lying down, four legs gathered under body. G = Lying down, three legs gathered under body. 135</page><page sequence="8">of more than 1-8 times the body length are designated false action (D). A template of measurements in the ratio of 10, 11, 13, 18, progressively increasing to 20, 22, 26, 36, etc., is used as a sliding scale for determining the relative proportions between body and stride. The length of body of the painted animal is matched against the relevant body length of the template and the position of the legs is read against the corresponding stride ratio (fig. 4). An additional note is made when both front legs and both hind legs are extended beyond the limits of the body, a position which has been described as the 'flying gallop' (fig. 4 C &amp; D). In nature, this is an unbalanced and abnormal attitude for a heavy animal to adopt, yet it is widely accepted as a visual impres- sion of animal movement (Muybridge, 1899; Kroeber, 1948; Lhote, 1959). Where both fore and hind legs incline towards the centre of the body, with the knee angle of at least two legs between 900 and 1800 (i.e. not acutely bent), the position is designated E, or four-legs-together action. Though rarely depicted in the rock-paintings, this may represent cantering, galloping or leaping. Animals shown lying down are divided into two categories, F and G. In position F, all four legs are bent towards the under side of the body, with the knees acutely bent at an angle between 0? and 90?. In position G, only three legs with knee angles between 0? and 900 are bent towards the under side of the body, while the fourth may extend away from the body. Any action which does not fall within the definitions outlined above is listed under a separate category, and an additional note is made where animals in profile are depicted with two legs only, one front, and one rear. When the method for recording animal leg positions outlined above was tested on five subjects to ascertain whether or not uniform results would be obtained, some overlapping between the categories occurred in marginal examples. This was due to small differences in determining the length of body. The system does, therefore, require refinement. XI. Proportion Human and animal proportions are measured according to different standards, and each is divided into two sections, body and head. (i) Human body: leg proportions These are subdivided into long body (short legs), short body (long legs) and normal. In determining the relative proportion between body length and leg length, only vertical unclad figures in standing, walking and running positions are measured. It is too time-consuming to estimate the length of leg of sitting, squatting and kneeling figures, and the dividing line between body and leg cannot be seen in figures which are clad. The body length is measured from the top of the head to the centre of the buttocks or pubic region, while the leg length is measured from the centre of the buttocks or pubis to the bottom of the heel of the lowest leg. For the average adult human, the normal propor- tion between body and leg length is approximately 2t 20 BC A X Iii.0 Fig. 5. Template for measuring human body: leg proportions (A, B) and head: height pro- portions (C, D). A = Long body, short legs. B = Short body, long legs. C = Small head. D = Normal head. 136</page><page sequence="9">equal. However, to allow for minor abnormalities, and a certain amount of artistic licence on the part of the painters, the range of proportions accepted as normal for the purposes of the analysis is increased. A body is designated long only if it is 0 1 or more as long again as the legs, and short if it is 01 or more shorter than the legs. All measurements falling between the above are recorded as normal. By this reckoning, bodies designated long or short are unquestionably disproportionate (fig. 5). (ii) Human head: height proportions These are subdivided into small, large and normal heads. In determining the relative proportion between the length of head and the overall length of the figure, only upright or leaning forward, standing, walking and running figures are analysed. The action of the remainder distorts the body too greatly for any accurate estimation of height to be made. The length of head is taken to be the vertical distance between the top of the crown to the bottom of the chin, while the total height of the figure is measured from the top of the crown to the bottom of whichever heel is the greatest distance from the above point. The average proportion of the adult human head to total height is 1: 7 5. For the purposes of the analysis, however, heads which bear the relationship 1:10 are designated small, 1:5 are large, and all measurements between are accepted as normal. According to this classification, only the heads which are highly dis- proportionate fall within the categories small or large. A single template for human proportions suffices to measure both the relative length between body and legs, and between head and height. The scale is prepared in the ratio of head I : body 10, with a subdivision at 5, and the area between 4 5 and 5*5 shaded, progressively increasing to head 2: body 20, with a subdivision at 10, and the area between 9 and 11 shaded, etc. (fig. 5). To obtain the body: leg relationship, the total height of the figure illustrated is matched against the appro- priate height on the template. If the midpoint of the buttock or pubis lies below the shaded area, the body is designated long, or conversely, the legs short (fig. SA). If the midpoint lies above the shaded area, the body is designated short, or conversely, the legs long (fig. SB). Midpoints lying within the shaded area fall into the category for normal body: leg proportions. To obtain the head: height relationship, the length of the head illustrated is matched against the relevant head length on the template. If the total height of the painted figure is less than the half mark (5, 10, etc.), the head is designated large. If the total height of the figure exceeds the height marked on the template (10, 20, etc.), the head is designated small (fig. 5 C). Where the height of the figure falls between the half mark and the total height marked on the template, the head length is designated normal (fig. 5 D). In the estimation of human proportions in this analysis, no account has been taken of length of neck or of width of body (fatness and thinness), which should be included if a more detailed study is required. (iii) Animal length : height proportions These are subdivided into elongated, short and normal body proportions. The relative height of an animal to its length varies with each individual species. For the purpose of this analysis, a scale of measurements was prepared for adult eland (Taurotragus oryx), horses and cattle. To date, however, the proportions of only eland have been analysed. The average proportions for actual adult eland were obtained from photographs in Muybridge (Muybridge, 1899), and from records in the Zoo- logical Society mammal photograph album (685-763), in Regents Park, London. These measurements were checked against mounted specimens of eland in the Natural History Museum, London, and in the Natal Museum, Pietermaritzburg. Additional information was obtained from measurements published by Meinertzhagen (Meinertzhagen, 1938) and Roberts (Roberts, 1951). Excluding the head and neck, and measuring the bulk of the body only, it is surprising to find that actual eland proportions, in contradistinction to the great majority of paintings, show the height at the shoulder to be slightly greater than the body length, 1 :11. However, because of the difficulty in objec- tively and precisely estimating the length of the body in animal paintings (see animal leg positions, X iv), it was decided to compare the height at the shoulder with the overall length. Exceptional paintings showing the eland with the head held very high, very low, or with the head turned back over the shoulder, are therefore eliminated from this set of attributes, as also eland in lying down positions. The overall length is estimated from the tip of the nose to the rear of the rump, excluding the tail, while the height is estimated from the top of the withers to the bottom of the hoof of the longest front leg. Actual eland measurements gave an average length: height ratio of 1-6 :1. For the purposes of the analysis, however, the normal ratio is extended to include 4 points on either side of 1 6. Only if the length is greater than twice the height, 2 :1, is the body designated long, and if the proportion is 1*2: 1, it is designated short. All measurements falling between the above are normal. In practice, it has been found that short bodies are never depicted, therefore a separate category for these is superfluous. (iv) Animal head: length proportions These are subdivided into small, large and normal heads. The relative proportion between length of head and length of body varies with each animal species. A scale of measurements was prepared for adult eland, horses and cattle, but to date only those for eland have been put into effect. 137</page><page sequence="10">The average ratio between head length and total body length in adult eland was estimated to be 1: 5, the length of head being measured from the tip of the nose to the crown, and the body length from the tip of the nose to the rear of the rump excluding the tail. For the purposes of the analysis, however, the normal ratio is extended to include two factors on either side of this figure. The head is designated small if the ratio is 1: 7 or greater, and large if the ratio is 1: 3 or less. Ratios between 1: 3 and 1: 7 fall within the normal category, which includes all but the highly disproportionate heads. In practice, large heads are never depicted, therefore a separate category for these is unnecessary. One template suffices to estimate both the length: height and head : length proportions. The scale is subdivided in the ratio of head I : height 3-5 : total length 7, progressively increasing to head 5 : height 175 : total length 35, etc. The head portion is shaded for easy differentiation (fig. 6). To estimate the length : height proportion, the total length of painted eland is matched against the relevant length on the template. The template is then swung round from the horizontal to the vertical &lt; ~~~~~~~~~~A 1111111111 It 5 ', 17 5 35 LI I IIIIII~II il-- , 6 ' 21 42 Fig. 6. Template for measuring eland proportions.

The bottom of this is placed in line with the bottom of the lowest front hoof, and extended vertically towards the withers. If the top of the withers falls below the half mark, the body is long (fig. 6B). If it falls above the half mark, the body is normal (fig. 6A). To estimate the head: length proportion, the length of the painted eland head is measured against the relevant head length on the template. The template is then swivelled round with the point of the nose as the pivot, so that the body line of the template follows the length of the painted body. If the rear of the rump extends beyond the body length marked on the template, the head is small, while if it falls within the template measurement, the head is normal. Conversely, if the head of the painted eland is shorter than the head length on the template for the corre- sponding body length, the head is short (fig. 6B). If it is greater than the head length on the template, it is normal (fig. 6A). When the system for measuring head: length proportions for eland was tested on five subjects for consistency, some variation resulted in marginal examples. This was due to difficulty in estimating the length of head, as the crown is not always clearly depicted in paintings, being partly obscured by the presence of ears or horns. This system of measuring therefore requires some refinement before it can be accepted as truly objective. In estimating eland proportions in this analysis, the relationship between length of leg to length of body, and of length of neck to length of body, has not been taken into account, but should be included if a more precise study of relative proportions is required. XII. Weapons and Equipment The weapons and equipment most commonly depicted in the paintings are listed separately, together with any specific details relevant to each item, for example, whether arrows are hafted or barbed, or bows simple or compound etc. Hunting equipment includes bows, arrows, quivers or hunting bags, and spears or harpoons. Other items listed are sticks (plain, knobbed, weighted or forked), shields, skin bags, fly-switches, wagons, boats, guns and powder-horns. Less commonly illustrated are a type of hatchet or 'flag', a whip or leash, and a rope- like line sometimes decorated with dots. It has also been found convenient to note under this heading, though not strictly applicable, the presence of young, either carried or suckled. Sundry items not listed among the above are included in a miscellaneous category, while those which cannot be specifically identified are listed under a heading unknown, or uncertain. XIII. Composition The composition of the paintings is divided into five basic groups. These may be scattered figures which show no particular cohesion, or long processions of five or more figures in a line. They may be small compositions involving only two to four figures, or large compositions involving five or more figures. Superimposed friezes are itemized in a category of their own. XIV. Scene Description Paintings may depict hunting, fighting, and domestic activities, dancing or acrobatics, and ceremonial, ritual or mythical scenes. Where the precise object in view is not clear, for instance, a group of buck not being actively hunted, or armed hunters not actually pursuing a particular animal, the scene is listed under a heading significance obscure. XV. Superposition Careful note is made of all direct examples of superposition, and the sequence is recorded. XVI. Heads- Human In describing the general contour of the head, round and oval shapes are classed together, with triangular and concave forming separated categories. In the latter, the impression is given of a prominent forehead and prognathous jaw, with an intervening depression. Exaggeration of this feature produces the hook head, which may or may not be filled in with a light-coloured pigment. Animal-headed figures form another class, and any head shapes not included in these descriptions are itemized separately (fig. 7, XVI). XVII. Hairstyles or Headgear-Human Knobs on the head, caps of hair or skin, brimmed hats, and feathers or horns constitute separate categories. Hair, thongs or flaps hanging down from the head, and hair or prongs radiating outwards from the head are also noted. Any object on or protruding from the head not covered by these categories is listed separately (fig. 7, XVII). XVIII. Dress- Human The types of dress most commonly depicted are aprons or gee-strings, short capes which reveal the buttocks, short cloaks or karosses which cover the buttocks but reveal the thigh, and long cloaks or karosses reaching to the knee or below. Trousers, jackets, boots, etc., are listed together as European clothing. Any article of dress not included in these categories is itemized separately, and apparently naked figures are noted as such (fig. 7, XVIII). XIX. Decorations- Human Decorations may include beads or bands on head, neck, body, arms or legs. There may also be flaps of skin attached to arms or more frequently legs, tassels or thongs suspended from any part of the body, and the body itself may be decorated with spots, stripes or patterns. Decorations not covered by these categories are itemized separately. 139</page><page sequence="12">11)1k 1 n.115VW 1 2 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~3 4 5 2 345 XVIII 1 ~ ~ ~~2 3 4 5 6 Fig. 7. XVI. Heads. 1.

Physical Details-Human Physical details include the presence of steatopygia or steatomeria, fingers or toes, and facial features such as eyes, nose and mouth. Animal characteristics, for example wings, tail, or hooves are noted, as also any exudate from the body-urine, faeces, blood or sweat. Details not included in the above categories are itemized separately. XXI. Species-Animal The most commonly depicted buck such as eland, rhebuck and haartebeest, are listed individually, while those less frequently represented like wildebeest or roan antelope, are included in an uncommon class. Buck which cannot be specifically identified are listed as unidentifiable. Other species which occur among the paintings are baboons, felines, warthog or bushpig, elephant, rhinoceros and hippopotamus. Domestic animals include dogs, sheep, cattle and horses, and an addi- tional note is made when the latter are mounted. Fish, snakes, birds and mythical or anthropomor- phic figures are itemized separately, while animals which cannot be identified at all come under a heading unknown. XXII. Physical Details-Animal Features like horns or tusks, eyes, mouth or nostrils are listed, and less significant details may include such items as hooves or claws, mane or hair, tail-tufts and back-stripes. Particular note is made when the neck of an animal is painted in a different colour from the body. Spots or stripes, blood or sweat, urine or faeces, and other details such as spoor, are documented separately. In connexion with domestic animals, the presence of harness, leash or lead, bridle, rein, saddle, girth or stirrup, is also recorded. XXIII. Miscellaneous Miscellaneous and non-representational objects are itemized under categories such as traps, skerms or enclosures, parallel lines, dots, patterns, finger smears, meandering lines, etc. It is a very small group com- pared with human or animal, as the majority of objects are listed under the heading weapons and equipment. PUNCH CARDS In the analysis at present being undertaken, the presence of attributes is notched on punch cards which are then hand-sorted. The punch-card system is not, however, a necessary adjunct of the analysis. It was selected because of the ease with which recurrent attributes can be assessed, attribute clusters detected, and cross-comparisons made. To take an example, all animal-headed figures from a given area are easily abstracted and their frequency of occurrence calculated as a percentage of the whole. It is then relatively simple to estimate what types of 140</page><page sequence="13">equipment, clothing and decorations are most frequently associated with animal-headed representa- tions, and whether there is any consistency in colour, size, superposition, etc. Animal-headed figures from one site or area may readily be compared with those from another, and consistencies or differences in detail quantitatively expressed. LIMITATIONS AND SCOPE The limitations of this type of analysis are self- evident, not the least of which is that it is a laborious and time-consuming task, which in the end gives a wholly inadequate impression of what the paintings are really like. It is difficult indeed to reduce art to a list of objective attributes (Willcox, 1957). If, how- ever, the study of rock-art is to make a meaningful contribution to the field of archaeology where quantitative and statistical methods are becoming increasingly important, an analytical approach is essential. The scope is far-reaching. Within defined areas or even single painting-sites, a quantitative analysis can indicate the bias or preference of the artists for certain subject-matter (Maggs, 1967), and the fre- quency of various attribute clusters may prove significant (Leroi-Gourhan, 1965). The greatest value, however, will lie not so much in correlating information from a circumscribed area such as that covered by the present survey, but in comparing one area with another on an objective basis. Valid statistical similarities could suggest cultural homogeneity, while differences might indicate separate clan areas. A distribution map based on a large enough sample from a wide enough area may reflect the ecological zones formerly occupied by specific animals or peoples, and could reveal possible migration routes or areas of contact (Cooke, 1964 &amp; 1965). Even more pertinent, however, will be the final marshalling of relevant data, when a beginning can be made on reconstructing the behaviour of the people responsible for the paintings (Spaulding, 1960; Sandle, 1967). Without this understanding, the full significance of rock-art will for ever remain obscure. It would be of inestimable value, therefore, if similar analyses could be undertaken in other areas. While some of the attributes will doubtless have to be modified or expanded to fit the needs of different regions, the general principles outlined in this system should be widely applicable.
