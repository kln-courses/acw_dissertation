Septarium from the Cantabrian coast Assemblage 18 ? 1992 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Analogy implies an effect of Nature: it constitutes the 'natural' as a source of truth; and what adds to the curse of analogy is the fact that it is irrepressible: no sooner is a form seen, than it must re- semble something: humanity seems doomed to Analogy, that is, in the long run to Nature.' A correspondence between body and building has been op- erative in the discourse of architecture ever since Alberti's claim that a building is a form of body.2 Anthropomorphic analogies have hence consistently been constructed out of bodily resemblances and metaphors. Words such as circula- tion, blood, arteries as well as head, navel, and feet are often used to qualify the morphology of the built. This body/build- ing analogy, however, has been restricted to geometries of anatomy and physiology wherein a body is persistently ideal- ized in a state of normalcy that requires permanent monitor- ing. Urban discourse, for instance, opposes two images: one negative, which detects the city's abnormality as pathologi- cal; the other positive, which analogizes an ideal body in its attempts to rectify the urban form. From such a discourse results a thematic of dependency on a geometrico-biological body as well as a necessity to diagnose and cure its potential defects. One might, in fact, regard this analogical bias as panopticist since it confines the human body to a singular biological framework, while excluding its other attributes, its "affects." Analogy, in architecture, incarcerates the body in a single cell, objectifying and scrutinizing its flesh by obliterat- ing its desires. At best, the built domain has been regarded as the stage of heightened emotions; affects, however, seem never to qualify or construct architecture. 7</page><page sequence="2">'0i 4Wi ~"</page><page sequence="3">assemblage 18 The following pages describe (amorously analyze) a folie designed by Rodolfo Machado and Jorge Silvetti; they also belong to a larger research devoted to architecture's "amo- rous discourse" that, despite analogy, might homologize an affective body, gendered, languid, in love, in pain. For if it seems ordinary to pronounce the word face in faqade, one has yet to locate in this metaphor such things as melancho- lia, ravishment, or languor. Affects are revealed so that the body may not merely be reduced to fields of biology or geometry and so that architecture's anthropomorphic allusions might be liberated from perfidious Analogy.3 From all this results an attempt to recognize in architec- ture une dimension amoureuse: a Barthesian view of the built domain in whose philia a body is so often plural, always atopic, affective. For amatory desires, no doubt, participate in the construction of architecture. The tableau consecrates the object I am about to love.4 Jorge Silvetti and Rodolfo Machado describe their Folly in a series of rubrics published in an exhibition catalogue entitled Follies: Architecture for the Late-Twentieth-Cen- tury Landscape.' Function, interpretation, construction, signification, vision, and images are the terms provided for the viewer/reader who might wish to enter this little build- ing, this folie whose function the architects/authors detail as follows: It is a pool house and a bathing pool in a garden, a large garden. The former has a small but well-equipped kitchen and an equally small toilet room, on top of which there are two stretched canvas beds for sunbathing accessible by means of two ladders. In the pool house there is a fireplace with a mirror, a practical cooling fountain and a true picture window that frames a view of the garden outside. There is a bench, a table and chairs, and four sconces, with a dimmer. By the pool, there is a tall chair to sit on to look out - or down - a pair of tiled benches and 'side tables' to sit underwater and read or chat, and there is a copy of a classi- cal statue, submerged most of the time. Underwater, too, there are four sconces, with a dimmer. Besides the two major rooms, there is a small space for filters and pumps and a similar one for the con- venient storage of garden furniture.6 Along with the Folly's explicit function, one is also guided by the authors' own interpretation that enumerates the possible meanings from which the reader/viewer might infer what this pool house resembles: 2. Silvetti/Machado, Folly, axonometric Taberna: It is like a found temporary house, like a tabernacle, or like an oracular hut where truths are half-revealed: a retreat where deities might dwell and give to their pleasures. Oracles inhabit the building and the building is oracles. Ancipitis Formae: It is a bi-headed, bi-frontal, double-faced con- struction; it is a janiform 'unity' without either the serenity of the classical rendition of Janus - where both profiles equidist from an axial internal vertical plane - or the unambiguous detachment of the heads of imperial eagles. .... Here instead both cephalic pieces rotate, anguishedly pulling apart - a tug-of-war, of sorts - with- out succeeding at establishing an 'orderly architectural accommoda- tion' or a formal division, thus questioning preconceived ideas about unity and doubles. It is, then, a bicephalic colossal edifice barely unearthed, a pair of monstrous cranial siameses or a set of gigantic craniums where the lifting of the parietal reveals most inner matters: two perfect cubes 8</page><page sequence="4">el-Dahdah ? .. / ? . i Y I K __~~ ~ -) - c71_._ -&lt; u, ! - i.....07.,If!:, ' -::,?j :i':- - 1 " "'---:-.,, . , - `'s 3.

Besides, pairs of oppositions of various types structure this assemblage; for instance: one-point perspective/two-point perspective, frontality/diagonality, con- scious/unconscious, one eye/two eyes, mask/face ... and gestures or the colors of the eyes. Oracles inhabit the building and the building is oracles: this sentence seems enigmatic in its reference to a space at once fit for some sort of conjuring and itself that which is conjured. Silvetti/Machado's Folly, one is told, is not only an oracular hut - a place for revealing half-truths - but itself a half-truth. It is oracles in its veiling of what it "half- truthfully" seeks to represent or become: a retreat where one gives in to something "other" while, as its text sug- gests, the Folly is that other. This unreasonable architec- ture expresses an inexpressible topos; it stages within its walls, essentially and semantically, the place of our meeting the 'other.'7 When considering the architectural folly as a space of alterity (like an oracular hut), one need only expose its eighteenth-century origin to maintain that a folie is simply a retreat [for the practice of something 'else'] where deities [and others] might dwell and give to their pleasures. Much like its ancestors, S/M's Folly could, therefore, exhibit the dimen- sions of play. In fact, many follies were designed not only as the emblems of eroticism but also as its site, the retreat of lovers, allegorized as fauns, cupids and nymphs, but nevertheless real.8 Described as the site of erotic play or as the retreat for lovers, this Folly acquires the status of the innocent bystander, a silent object that houses a great deal of libertinage; moreover, it implies a proper place for the "polite" outside its walls.9 A dyadic model of eighteenth-century thought can thus be understood to distinguish the libertine as belonging to the Folly from the otherwise polite as pertaining to the civility of architecture. Hence the analogy of the tabernacle: a space fit for conjuring in contradistinction to the space of the quotid- ian. This model, however, fails to account for the building being itself of what is conjured. Follies are "lightened" (as "mad" places) only to site sobriety in the civil project of the architectural discipline. And this classification serves to cir- cumscribe (and restrict) places of pleasure in order to codify other spaces as sacred, just, disciplinary, or domestic; as if to suggest that a church, a courthouse, a prison, or a house are exempt from madness. The Folly's authors themselves rely on the ideological distinction between "our times" and "times long gone," times in which construction was suppos- edly a serious matter, when it is now (in 1983) considered "folly": In times such as ours, when the building of architecture is more of- ten than not poorly accomplished (or, which is worse, when the fact is seen as either irrelevant or 'clever'), construction of good quality has become as rare and as 'superfluous' as a folly. Let then our choice of materials - the masonry of Rome, the steel of Mies van der Rohe - be a reminder of what it should be. In the Age of Simulation, in opposition to that of Reason, the orderly architectural accommodation sought by the "an- guished" rotation of both cubes may, indeed, prove im- possible. The production of an "orderly architecture" is a socio-constructed notion that hopes to immunize the disci- pline of architecture from mere building or frivolous kitsch and thereby conceal that it may never have had claim to such immunity. The S/M Folly is not simply an innocent edifice 10</page><page sequence="6">el-Dahdah occupied only by one side of the libertine/polite dyad, nor is it simply a retreat of lovers, an object that merely sites the quest for the Other. Instead, this Folly is the Other, since it is oracles, and can thus become an object of desire apprehended through intimacy; or better, a quasi-subject that designates the specialty of my desire'" and for whom my attempt to interpret it merely masks a lover's discourse. This small building's role is not only to stage an encounter between two lovers but as well to play a third, and equal, part in the scenario of their seduction. If, indeed, the Folly of S/M is a not-so-innocent retreat for lovers or receptacle of libertinage, seduction needs also to be reevaluated relative to its eighteenth-century filiation and to its manifestation in this contemporary tabernacle of Eros. The same model that has restricted follies to the libertine has always insisted on a binary and victimizing seduction mea- sured by the subject's performances while ignoring the object. The seducer is closely monitored; the seduced is a mere num- ber in a list of thousands of victims. In such a model, seduc- tion is studied much as Leporello treats it in Mozart's opera: He counts and keeps account of, while his master, Don Gio- vanni, sings. The victim, meanwhile, is banalized for having lost its 'self (the defeat of resistance) and thus falls in the tear- ful domain of deserved suffering." Such a theoretical posture clearly insists on dyadic models where one side remains ever- sovereign and the other is ignored as a disdainable subaltern. In this case, jouissance belongs no longer to the 'other' but to itself, caught in a vicious narcissistic circle, never shared, al- ways in the camp of the winner. And, in the end, a model such as this one will persistently reestablish phallic law and recompose the virile imaginary.12 Should the S/M Folly still be regarded as the site for something "else" coveted by seduc- tion, it is one that avoids being trapped in a biased dyad so that it may question preconceived ideas about unity and doubles - those preconceived ideas of seduction, for instance, in which there must be only one winner and many losers. The seduction that occurs in the S/M Folly is divested of its vic- timizing dimension in order to transgress a model that insists on the triumph of the seducer and the fall of the seduced. Unlike other silent follies, this little pavilion anticipates the seduction its walls have staged, a plot perhaps allegorized from a scene in Jean Cocteau's Livre blanc, where the narrator 5. Jean Cocteau, illustration for Le Livre blanc, 1930 11</page><page sequence="7">assemblage 18 recalls a bathhouse of similar configuration, two rooms sepa- rated by a picture frame: One of my only regrets was the transparent mirror. Inside a dark booth, you would pull back a panel; this panel revealed one side of the tain through which the eye could embrace a small bathroom. The other side was so reflective and so polished that it was impossible to imagine its being filled with gazes. Depending on my finances, I would spend my Sundays there. Of all the twelve looking glasses of all the twelve bathrooms, it was the only one of that sort. The owner paid a great deal for it and had it sent from Germany. His staff did not know of this observatory. Young workmen provided the spectacle. They all followed the same routine. They would undress and care- fully hang up their new suits. Out of their Sunday best, their charm- ing vocational deformations disclosed the nature of their craft. Standing in the bathtub, they would look at themselves (at me) with a grin baring teeth and gums. Then they would rub a shoulder, pick up a bar of soap and make it lather. Soaping turned into caress. Their eyes would suddenly leave the world, their heads would lean back, and their bodies would spit like a furious beast's. Exhausted, some of them would let themselves melt in the steaming water, others would do it all over again; the younger ones could be recognized by their straddling over the bathtub rim and, farther away, would wipe from the tiles the sap their blind stalks had giddily thrown toward love. One day a Narcissus, admiring himself, brought his mouth to the looking glass and, kissing it, pushed to the extreme his contempla- tion. Invisible as the Greek gods, I pressed my lips against his and imitated his actions. He never knew that instead of reflecting, the mirror had reacted; that it was alive and had loved him." An unprecedented homology can therefore be made between Cocteau's double room and the Ancipitis formae - that bi- headed, bi-frontal, double-faced construction where both pro- files equidist from an axial internal vertical plane. In other words, two heads, two rooms, two bodies, two lovers are sepa- rated by a vertical plane illustrated in Le Livre blanc and alle- gorized through the mirror that could react, was alive, and could love. Cocteau's looking glass participates in the space of an amatory discourse as a subject, not as an innocently trans- lucent object; it adopts a role of agency as it constructs an apparatus of desire. Concealed, therefore, is a half-truth, an unknown presence, invisible as the Greek gods, hidden as the classical statue a swimmer might encounter underwater. Whatever it may be, this "presence" is registered on the verti- 6. Folly, sketch 7.

Folly, interior perspectives cal plane that causes the cephalic pieces [to] rotate, anguishedly pulling apart [in] a tug-of-war, of sorts; it is a Janusean presence that might very well engender the reverse, in an amorous war, of sorts.'4 This ocularly orchestrated phenomenon is manifest between the exhibitionism of the occupant who bathes in the pool (as manipulator of the gaze) and the voyeurism of the one who reclines on the daybed (as owner of the gaze). For both subjects, the distance separating them will be gauged by seduc- tion: a distance registered on the vertical plane that separates the two cubes, whereby one side absorbs the voyeur's gaze through a one-point perspective only for it to be transformed on the exhibitionist's side into a two-point perspective. Like Cocteau's mirror, this plane is no longer one of reflection but a surface of absorption."5 Hence this "mad" space of seduction, perspectivally con- structed out of reversible dimensions found in Cocteau's story when the narrator lends the reader his spectatorship as it is manipulated by the Narcissus on the other side of the mirror.16 In Le Livre blanc, consequently, both narrator and reader see without being seen, but bearing no position of ordonnance can only indulge themselves and the mirror by "accompanying" (to use Pierre Saint-Amand's term) the action of the Narcissus: I propose the word conduction (cum-ducere). One should no longer seduce, but conduce, or accompany."'7 The Narcissus, too, indulges the mirror; he looks at himself when, in fact, he is looking at the narrator (the reader/viewer) and as he pushes his contemplation to an extreme, he is unaware of the mirror's role/ soul. The manipulator is thus manipulated in seeking to ma- nipulate his own reflection. In the end, everyone is absorbed by the mirror (the vertical plane) in whose "depth" a space can be measured only by seduction and calibrated only by perspective. The mirror arbitrates scopophilic reversals in a space that will, nevertheless, remain directional as the mirror's tain, for in- stance, is polished on one side alone; just as the Folly's vertical plane is depicted as a tableau on the side of the viewer. This 13</page><page sequence="9">assemblage 18 9. Folly, sketches Folly, however, does not succumb to a total reversal. It is made conscious of its power to participate in a visual field/ space independent of the subjects' ability to participate in it. The lover who reclines on the bench and looks toward the pool may, in one sense, occupy the space of masterly overview and find himself at the center of vision with every line of flight across the cornices ... traveling [toward his spectatorship]. But in another sense, the architecture [the Folly] ... turns towards a place where the viewer does not and cannot exist. The moment the viewer appears and takes up position at the viewpoint, he ... comes face to face with another term that is the negative coun- terpart to the viewing position: the vanishing point, the site for the Other.'" Such a position is witnessed from behind by an outside voyeur for whom a pedestal has been provided. The observer, now observed, can be seen from a small window equipped with a diaphragm, which the Folly can contract to restrict the intruder's gaze. Even the faqade, for instance, raises an eyebrow, a brick arch, and reveals that it, too, has an eye whose pupil can be delineated by a man's face submerged in the pool behind. The visual experience is shared by object and subject alike and is never centered on one distinguished subject. The gaze of the seducer can thus no longer scopto- mize its object from a position of command since many other such positions can be accessed by either another subject or another object; in this case, the other lover, the voyeur (look- ing from outside), the Folly itself, or me. A second scopophilic scenario is revealed should the lover seated on the bench decide otherwise to sit in the tall poolside chair. He walks across a carpet made of grass and enters the tableau. As he climbs the ladder to the chair, his hand leans on a railing made of doorknobs that can simulta- neously satisfy the equilibrium of his climb and estrange that intimate moment when a hand touches a building. The hand seeks a railing yet holds a doorknob instead, and thus a hesi- tation is induced only to reveal the tactile intimacy of this moment. While inaccessible to the swimmer below, his seigniorial gaze overlooking the large garden is subjected to an altogether different scene. From outside, the chair appears to saddle the Folly's back and sitting in it transforms the occupant's silhouette into a figure riding a colossal beast. From inside, however, the man's voyeuristic posture (as he watches the man below swim in the pool's veined marble 14</page><page sequence="10">el-Dahdah REAR SIDE FRONT SIDE REAR REAR FRONT REAR 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10.

Folly, exterior detail of model 16</page><page sequence="12">el-Dahdah 14. Folly, rear facade walls) transforms him into a subculturally coded object of desire: the lifeguard. The Folly's anthropomorphic physiognomy, alluded to by its authors, acquires the carnality of an aberrant beast that may well be coveted. Figuratively, the double-cube configuration, the two heads, or both physiognomies are drawn, as it were, in brick: opus reticulatum becomes, in one, hair and in the other, the skin of the cheeks; opus testaceum becomes eyelids, eye- brows, a supercilious gesture and ears and the little orifice of the ears; opus mixtum makes the scruff of the neck, delineates a nape. The T-beam frame edges the mask worn by the one-eyed Cyclopean character. A first reading of the brick elevations in fact reveals many faces with hair, noses, eyes, and raised eye- brows. Other faces are evoked by the architects' written im- ages. On one of the faqades, for instance, where the opus reticulatum represents hair, a plant has been placed above what could be an ear's volute, creating the face of a boy with jasmine tucked behind his ear. I remember that summer morn- ing, at dawn, walking towards the pool - bronze ears blurred with dew and drops in the jasmine above: this image alludes to a specific face found in a Von Gloeden photograph or a Caravaggio painting - a Boy Bitten by a Lizard that might have crept out from a crack in the bricks. If this elevation does indeed represent a face, the other side remains ambiguous in its representation. One is told that the entrance faqade is a Cyclopean face whose entire brick pattern consists of the opus mixtum coded by the architects as being both hair and skin. But this wall with only one window, this skin with only one hole, alludes less to an eye and more to the beast's anus: a surface with a single orifice muscularly able to contract and dilate, causing the skin to wrinkle at the opus testaceum. The S/M Folly seems to corroborate what its authors question, those preconceived notions of unity and doubles: two heads or one beast? It is an ambiguity that arises from the text's refer- ence to a Janusean head one of whose faces has now been turned inward. The Cyclopean front, the faqade with one hole, becomes what might be regarded as the back of one beast or 17</page><page sequence="13">assemblage 18 +st 15. Cocteau, illustrations for Le Livre blanc, 1930 18</page><page sequence="14">el-Dahdah the back of one cube in a set of two. This confusion, which suggests a certain conflation of the singular and the doubled, can, once again, be illustrated in Cocteau's writing, in the poem "A Friend Sleeps": You lived inside an other yourself And of your body so well abstract, That you seemed made of stone. It is hard, when in love, To have but a portrait. We look so much like that eagle with two heads, That double-faced Janus, Those Siamese twins shown in fairs, Those books stitched with one thread. Love turns lovers into a single beast of bliss, Bristling with shrieks and mane, And this beast, elated with being its own prey, Devours itself with four hands."' So does the Folly of S/M live inside an other itself; it is com- posed of the same repeated twice; one gender doubled; the body of one lover conflated with his Other, his own reflec- tion. Hence a Folly that can be conjured as if it were a mythic figure, a Narcissus or an Imperial Eagle. Both tertiary animis- tic presences found in a ritual of seduction, registered in a threshold that separates the two cubes. Much like Cocteau's one-sided mirror or Proust's vasistas, placed between two rooms as an agent (a tableau) of seduction. Notes 1.
