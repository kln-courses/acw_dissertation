      <p>In act 4, scene 2, of Shakespeare and Middleton’s <italic>Timon of Athens</italic>, a group of servants gather outside their erstwhile master’s, the great Athenian lord Timon’s, house to lament his financial downfall, which has resulted in their own expulsion from service. Briefly, in this scene, the play turns away from its exposition of the failure of Timon’s fantasy of Athens as a patrician brotherhood of city fathers “commanding one another’s fortunes” to explore another kind of fraternity, which coalesces at the other end of the social spectrum through the prospect of utter destitution (1.2.103). In this context, the unconditional fidelity of the anonymous Third Servant who, faced with an adversity that is substantially his master’s doing, can still declare—“Yet do our hearts wear Timon’s livery”—is, at least to our modern ears, both moving and discomfiting. It is moving because the servant’s evocation of a community of “fellows” joined “alike in sorrow” offers a welcome reprieve—crucial to the generation of tragic affect—from the play’s relentless indictment of the self-serving individualism of Athens’s ruling class and their “glass-faced” minions (1.1.60). It is discomfiting because the servant, speaking for his companions, yokes that sense of fellowship to a notion of service that, at this juncture in the play, seems hopelessly utopian and even delusional, since the object of the servants’ fidelity, their master, remains oblivious to the plight of those left destitute by his lack of care.</p>
      <p>In light of <italic>Timon</italic>’s much-noted pessimism and the anomalous, even naive sentimentality that this scene seemingly conveys, it is tempting to conclude, as many critics have, that the servants’ fidelity represents little more than the pyrrhic victory of an ethical idealism tethered to a regressive social vision—a belated attempt on the playwrights’ part to reinforce from below moral imperatives that have been hollowed out from above.<sup>2</sup> Yet it is also possible to argue that the servants’ singular attachment to their master serves as a more telling indictment of the ways in which he, and the system he stands for, fails them than any degree of explicit resentment on their part could. Indeed, as David Schalkwyk has suggested, the servants function as the play’s primary agents of “moral rectitude and selfless devotion within a landscape of ruling-class cupidity and hypocrisy.” And as such, they mediate a vision of service that, even as it underscores the major precepts of the early modern ideology of service, “turns out to be radical insofar as it draws out the ethical implications of such conservative precepts.”<sup>3</sup> Drawing on and developing Schalkwyk’s insight into the radical potential of the ethic of service, this essay explores the connection between the play’s depiction of the servants’ ethical agency and its broader examination of the founding principles of political community, especially since the tragic crisis at the heart of <italic>Timon of Athens</italic> pertains as much to the Athenian polity as to its protagonist’s aristocratic household.<sup>4</sup> I argue that <italic>Timon</italic>’s servants model a form of heteronomous subjectivity that is crucial to the play’s examination of service as a potential vehicle for civic restoration. By juxtaposing Timon’s nihilism with his servants’ fidelity, the play pits tragedy’s iconoclastic, demystificatory bent against its idealizing and recuperative function and so undertakes a particularly nuanced and complex exploration of service as a social and political ethic. Although they are minor characters, the servants’ tragic fidelity to their master not only calls into question the protagonist’s misanthropic response to his betrayal by Athens’s self-serving plutocracy; in the process, the servants also embody a different kind of ethical subjectivity from Timon’s, one founded not in the autonomy from social bonds that Timon comes to desperately desire, but in an acute awareness of the self’s dependence on things (and persons) beyond itself.</p>
      <p>Scholarship on early modern service has been centrally concerned, from its inception, with the vexed question of the degree of autonomy available to servants in an institution designed to restrict subordinates’ ability to freely express and act upon their desires.<sup>5</sup> According to Michael Neill, the sacralization of service in Christian discourse allowed early modern English commentators to distinguish the freeborn Christian’s voluntary service from involuntary slavery, a distinction achieved through a complex, theologically charged linkage of freedom and bondage that, in Shakespeare’s <italic>The Tempest</italic>, for instance, culminates in the notion that “far from being inimical to freedom, service turns out to be the route to its attainment.”<sup>6</sup> But what is the nature of this “freedom” attained through service? Examining the seemingly debilitating relation between service and dependency in Shakespearean drama, Judith Weil suggests that dependency itself could “empower” servants when, going beyond customary acquiescence to authority, they found creative ways to “resist or transform the purposes which try to turn them into instruments or things.”<sup>7</sup> David Evett has argued that, for all their seeming passivity, the many faithful servant figures in Shakespearean drama could nonetheless wrest some autonomy out of their necessary subordination by exercising their “volitional primacy.” By “treating constraints and inhibitions as though they were freely chosen,” servants could realize that central Christian dictum, “in service is perfect freedom,” such that the external conditions to which they were bound could paradoxically become the means for expressing their personal agency and freedom.<sup>8</sup> For Evett, as for Weil, then, a creative adjustment of the self to material conditions beyond its control was crucial to Shakespeare’s conception of servant subjectivity and the means whereby his servants turned constraint into opportunity.<sup>9</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Recent work on service such as that outlined above suggests that, for many early modern writers, the concept of freedom in service points to something other than unbridled autonomy; as Evett has shown, a certain kind of agency becomes visible in precisely those moments when servants willingly embrace ties of dependence and subordination to render meaningful their sense of self and their place in the world. To think of service in this way also implies a shift of focus from autonomy to responsibility; indeed, as an ethical concept, service makes it impossible for us to think about freedom without responsibility, insofar as the question of responsibility lies at the heart of any ethical consideration of servant subjectivity. But this reconceptualization of service entails approaching it not simply as an institution of oppression and bondage (which it undoubtedly was for many) but also as a means, for early modern writers, of thinking about ethical relations in a society characterized by pervasive ties of dependence and subordination.<sup>10</sup> Arguably, it was precisely the widespread, multivalent currency of the discourse of service in early modern culture that prompted Shakespeare and his contemporaries to use service (and servant figures) to think through the question of what it means to <italic>be</italic> in society. From an ethical standpoint, to be a servant is to be bound to respond to another, to be subject to the address of another, and to understand subjectivity itself as constituted by this address.<sup>11</sup> It is the political implication of this hypothesis concerning servant subjectivity that <italic>Timon</italic> seeks to trace by linking the ethical agency of its servant figures to its tragic exploration of the foundations of an ethical polity.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Timon</italic>, ideal service describes an ethic of responsiveness and responsibility rather than of autonomy, invoking a self that is doubly objective—what Margreta de Grazia and colleagues construe as “a being in need of outside objects and in need of being an outside object to another.”<sup>12</sup> Marked by this “double objectivity,” servant consciousness in <italic>Timon</italic> approaches the philosopher Simon Critchley’s definition (after Emmanuel Levinas) of ethical experience as “heteronomous” because “my autonomy is called into question by the fact of the other’s demand, by the appeal that comes from their face and lays me under an obligation that is not of my choosing.” Moreover, this heteronomity at the core of the self is also what marks service as an ethicopolitical experience, for, as Critchley suggests, an “ethical politics flows from our constitutive powerlessness in the face of the other.”<sup>13</sup> Critchley’s theorization of “ethical politics” draws on Levinas’s contention that the crucial question underlying human sociopolitical arrangements is an ethical one: “It is important to know whether the state, society, law, and power are necessary because man is a beast to his neighbor (<italic>homo homini lupus</italic>) or because I am responsible for my fellow. It is very important to know whether the political order defines man’s responsibility or merely restricts his bestiality.”<sup>14</sup> Levinas here articulates a dilemma central to Shakespeare and Middleton’s early modern play, composed at a time when the lineaments of the modern political state whose ethical status so preoccupies Levinas were barely emerging. Levinas’s invocation of the Hobbesian formula is adumbrated in <italic>Timon</italic>’s stark philosophical meditation on the relation between the polis and the “bond in men” (1.1.148). Is human society merely a “forest of beasts” (4.3.347), as the cynic Apemantus puts it, barely held together by the sanctioned violence of the law, or is it possible for service, interpreted (in a Levinasian sense) as responsibility for “my fellow,” to constitute the ethical foundation of political life?</p>
      <p>Whether the experience of heteronomity can indeed be a source of a more ethical politics, grounded in an ethic of responsibility rather than the freedom promised by autonomous subjectivity, is a question central to <italic>Timon</italic>’s exploration of the imperatives underlying the making, and unmaking, of civic life. That exploration is furthermore crucially marked by what Terry Eagleton calls the “skeptical faith” peculiar to tragic form. For Eagleton, tragedy, as a transitional form mediating between an idealized past and a seemingly “predatory, degenerate present,” manifests a dual orientation toward “demystification, denunciation, and violent unmasking” and “a more tortuous … experience of clinging to one’s delusions” so as to “preserve, in however mystified a guise, a few shriveled seeds of truth.”<sup>15</sup> Timon’s misanthropic truth telling in the play’s latter half attests to tragedy’s iconoclastic bent, while his servants’ fidelity vectors a tragic experience of a “more tortuous” kind. In what follows, I first explore the divergent forms of subjective orientation modeled by Timon and his servants to the world of “objects” and then consider the broader sociopolitical implications of the affective agency embodied by the play’s servant figures. At once target of iconoclastic demystification and tragic faith, the possibility of a polity founded on an ethic of service as loving fellowship is in <italic>Timon</italic> an undoubtedly fragile prospect. But that fragility is less a product of the play’s cynicism or pessimism, as is often argued, than of its measured, complex awareness of the limits and possibilities of service as a social and political ideal.</p>
      <sec id="sc1">
         <title>Swear against Objects</title>
         <p>The servants’ refusal to engage, in 4.2, in the kind of bitter invective that famously consumes Timon in the latter part of the play not only underscores the pathos of his situation better than he himself can. Their exemplary selflessness also momentarily displaces Timon from the tragic focus to bring into view their own tragic experience. That experience is rooted in the servants’ awareness of the material and social costs of their fidelity, an awareness that rescues the scene from merely being a sentimental valorization of below-stairs virtue. The Third Servant’s poignant metaphor of shipwreck, likening his fellows to shipmates trapped on the “dying deck” of some “leaked bark,” acknowledges their self-sacrificing loyalty to stress not heroic agency but the precarity of men rendered masterless, houseless, and social outcasts in one fatal blow: “we must all part / Into this sea of air” (4.2.21–22). The servants’ fidelity thus establishes a dialectic between idealistic action and its material consequences, tying the tragic romance of uncompromising, high-minded idealism to the much less exalted, yet equally tragic experience of destitution. This sense of destitution, felt most acutely as the loss of one’s place in the world, governs the servants’ understanding of their master’s plight as well. Characterizing their master first as a dead companion “thrown into his grave” and instantly forgotten, and then as a “dedicated beggar to the air” who “With his disease of all-shunned poverty, / Walks, like contempt, alone” (4.2.9, 13–15), one servant casts Timon’s story not in terms of his heroic singularity but with reference to the quotidian, social roots of tragic experience. This attentiveness to the material dimension of tragic experience is crucial to the way the play configures the servants’ ethical subjectivity—a configuration that insists on the heteronomity of the ethical impulse as an alien or foreign affective presence within the self, even as it foregrounds that self’s rootedness in an exterior world of objects.</p>
         <p>Opting for fidelity rather than self-preservation, Timon’s servants might be said to evince a “sense of <italic>choice</italic>, and behind choice, of <italic>will</italic>,” as Evett parses his powerful concept of “volitional primacy.” Evett links this sense of choice animating servants who willingly embrace the “existential conditions of their life” to the emergence, in the early modern era, of the “more or less modern conception of the individual self, and of the centrality in that period’s dominant psychological theory of the active, assertive will.”<sup>16</sup> But the experience of service—for Timon’s servants at least—seems to be constituted less by an inward psychological freedom pressing through and shaping their response to obdurate external conditions than by a sense of attachment that is produced through those conditions and is experientially inseparable from them. That is to say, the servants’ subjectivity is not autonomous but heteronomous, forged within and through rather than against the external world of objects. Indeed, it is through the servants that the play explicates what it means to be an object among objects—“broken implements of a ruined house” (4.2.16), as Timon’s steward, Flavius, calls them. Flavius’s own characterization of his grief at the depletion of his master’s substance earlier in the play likewise describes a subjectivity shaped by its continuity with the material world of objects: “When our vaults have wept / With drunken spilth of wine,” he laments, “I have retired me to a wasteful cock / And set mine eyes at flow” (2.2.159–60, 162–63). Vaults weep into the steward’s flowing eyes such that the division between subject and object is momentarily disrupted in this remarkable image of prosopopoeic sympathy: Flavius does not so much weep <italic>for</italic> as <italic>with</italic> his master’s vaults.<sup>17</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Returning in this context to 4.2, the Third Servant’s seemingly straightforward declaration of absolute fidelity—“Yet do our hearts wear Timon’s livery— / That see I by our faces”—also appears as something other than a declaration of autonomous subjectivity. Livery is, after all, not the heart’s attire but the body’s, where it can be cast on or off at will. Worn on the heart—or rather, by the heart—“Timon’s livery” elicits fidelity not so much as a choice “among competing options” but as an imperative from beyond the domain of personal choice.<sup>18</sup> That imperative is doubtless socially conditioned. From a strictly materialist perspective, these are men who have internalized the service ethic such that they cannot imagine themselves in any other capacity. But, phrased as it is, the play also suggests that the call to serve—“our hearts wear Timon’s livery”—is located neither solely in the individual will nor only in socially enforced doctrine, but in some liminal zone between will and world, between self and other, between subject and object. As the foreign presence of the other within the self, fidelity emerges out of this intersection of utterly heteronomous objects—livery and heart, both subject to and shaped by compulsions from without.</p>
         <p>How best to respond to such compulsions? The servants’ story traces one path for negotiating the relations between subjects and objects, self and other; Timon’s antimaterialist idealism maps another, more oppositional route. As misanthrope, he seeks to secure his autonomous subjectivity by setting his face against the power of “objects,” where objects come to designate not only material things but also persons and the affective and ethical stirrings they provoke. “Swear against objects,” he urges the banished Athenian general, Alcibiades, while showering him with gold to expedite the destruction of Athens:<disp-quote>

            </disp-quote>“Objects” merits scrutiny for the way it departs from our common modern understanding of the term, “a material thing that can be seen and touched,” which presupposes a firm distinction, and an implicit power differential, between the subject who sees and touches and the “thing” seen and touched.<sup>19</sup> As used here, however, “object” means “<italic>some thing or person</italic> that presents itself to the eye or the other senses, provoking pity.”<sup>20</sup> Used in this extended sense, “objects” break down the division between passive material objects and perceptive human subjects, rendering permeable the boundary between them. To put armor on one’s eyes and ears is, in effect, to stop the pores whereby the world impinges on and attaches itself to human consciousness.<sup>21</sup> For Timon, the dangerous power of the human objects he invokes—a weeping mother, a crying baby, a bleeding priest—lies in their ability to elicit affective engagement at a visceral level, at a level beyond—or even prior to—moral calculus: the woman may be a bawd, the babe a future parricide, the priest a fraud, but their present abjection trumps and renders irrelevant any attempt at moral scrutiny.</p>
         <p>While Timon’s misanthropic turn in the latter part of the play apparently enacts a volte-face from his earlier philanthropic idealism, there is actually a fundamental continuity in the two phases of his career. The desire for autonomy from the grip of objects, manifested in the misanthrope’s fiercely iconoclastic rejection of the material world and its associated affects, is also what leads Timon, in the play’s first half, to treat the material dimension of his bounty as a “mere trifle of our love” (1.2.211). Yet Timon’s bounty has a profound impact on the polis of which he is the center—both as its most desired object and as its—seemingly—one autonomous subject. In the play’s opening allegorical vignette depicting Timon as Fortune’s minion, the Poet remarks that Timon’s generosity, made possible by Fortune’s extraordinary favor, has turned all Athenians into slaves who abjectly “Follow his strides … Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear, / Make sacred even his stirrup and through him / Drink the free air” (1.1.72, 82–85). What the Poet—himself one of the false “spirits” conjured by the “magic” of Timon’s bounty (1.1.6–7)—presents as a cynical manipulation of power by self-serving dependents, the play reveals, through the inset dark parody of religious worship, to be the servile idolatry of a community bereft of ethical moorings. As the subsequent action makes clear, Timon himself is complicit in his deification, which leads him to misrecognize as testimonials to his “nobility” the flattery of the avaricious Athenians he befriends and on whose false expressions of love and loyalty he stakes the fortune of his house: “Methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends,” he declares at one point (1.2.225). Hubristically emulating the autonomy implicit in divine largesse, he fails to recognize his own dependent, object status as the conduit for a bounty whose motions and meanings he cannot fully control.</p>
         <p>The play’s ironic invocation of the Eucharist in its depiction of the two banquets bookending Timon’s career as Athens’s foremost philanthrope underscores the protagonist’s disregard for material means as a prime cause of the tragic crisis in the main plot. As Regina Schwartz describes it, the Eucharist, at least in its pre-Reformation context, “offered the communicant participation in the sacrifice of Christ, with all its benefits,” such that the participant “was no longer an exile from God, for he could enjoy a share of his divinity. He was no longer in exile from the created world, for he was now materially joined to it through the body of God.”<sup>22</sup> In the ideal Eucharistic setting, the humble fare of bread and wine carves out a pathway to communion between the divine and the creaturely in the shared space of communal service, signaling a harmonious union of matter and spirit. By contrast, in Timon’s house, matter does not “transubstantiate” into spirit. It merely disintegrates into “prodigal bits of meat” and “drunken spilth of wine” (2.2.165, 160). As the cynic Apemantus observes caustically, Timon’s generosity in the first banquet scene only encourages the moral depravity of the men who gather at his table to “dip their meat in one man’s blood, and all the madness is, he cheers them too” (1.2.41). Directed at Timon, Apemantus’s cannibalistic metaphor fixes him as an embodiment of the prodigal dupe of Jacobean satiric comedy, seduced to his destruction by self-serving flatterers who treat him like a demigod. But directed at the parasites feeding on Timon’s meat, the metaphor draws on the tragic resonance of the Last Supper—“He that dippeth his hand with me in this dish, the same shall betray me” (Matt. 26:23)—to implicitly denounce the impending betrayal of the lord by his followers. The Eucharistic reference does not, however, posit a simple equivalence between Timon and Christ. Like Christ, Timon may be an iconic victim of the ills of his society, but unlike Christ, who assumes the communal burden of guilt despite his subjective innocence, Timon is complicit, in ways he himself does not fully recognize, in his community’s moral failings.</p>
         <p>Timon’s elaborate first banquet intimates the imminent breakdown of Athenian community by ironically recalling the Eucharistic communion it is not. His last supper, which A. D. Nuttall calls his “dyscharist,” explosively announces his misanthropic turn away from the very possibility of communion as he serves his false friends not with a spiritually transformative fare of bread and wine but with “Smoke and lukewarm water” (3.7.88).<sup>23</sup> Moreover, the anthropomorphic structure of Timon’s misanthropy disallows any possibility of his deriving succor from the wilderness to which he flees with the hope of finding “Th’unkindest beast more kinder than mankind” (4.1.36). Instead he comes to see the cosmic body itself as an extension of the corrupt human polity he has left behind, with each element in the chain of being preying on, rather than aiding, its neighbor in a parodic inversion of Eucharistic sharing:<disp-quote>

            </disp-quote>Not only are human relations and institutions diabolically deceptive but the very cosmic order, traditionally considered to be the ideal pattern for human sociability, is founded on parasitism and mutual thievery. Considered in the light of this pervasive antimaterialism, Timon’s denunciation of gold in the play’s latter half, too, can be seen as an indictment not only of the corrupt, money-mad Athenian political economy but of the fundamental materiality of being itself. Indeed, gold’s origin in the “damned earth” (4.3.42) testifies to the infinite corruptibility of the creaturely world, which originates from the same “Common mother” whose womb “Teems and feeds all” by a “composture stol’n / From general excrement” (4.3.176–78, 436–37). In place of a “vision of a transubstantiating universe,” such as the one celebrated by Milton’s Raphael in <italic>Paradise Lost</italic>, Timon thus substitutes a cosmic body held together by cannibalistic thievery.<sup>24</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The misanthropic bid for autonomy from such a vicious cosmic economy of “universal thievery” manifests itself in Timon’s implacable injunction to Alcibiades: “Swear against objects.” The protagonist’s misanthropic turn thus enacts to precision Eagleton’s “tragedy of demystification, denunciation, violent unmasking,” a tragedy that considers the split between the world as it should be and the world as it is to be unbridgeable.<sup>25</sup> 
            <italic>Timon</italic> criticism has frequently tended to gather around the extended movement of misanthropoesis in the play’s latter half, as one which effectively secures Timon’s position as the play’s tragic-heroic center. Arguably, however, Timon takes the passionate attachment to absolute ends characteristic of a certain kind of tragic heroism to its very limit—so much so that the character of the protagonist comes to constitute an ironic scrutiny, on the play’s part, of that formal impulse which has sometimes earned for tragedy a reputation of elitist disconnection from quotidian experience and made of the tragic hero a cult figure and fetish object. As it turns out, the desire for autonomy implicit in Timon’s heroic stance of ethical absolutism carries the seeds of its own undoing. Not only does Timon’s misanthropy rob him of the capacity for positive ethical action, it also fosters a quasi-idolatrous fascination with the very objects of his hatred. In this respect, Shakespeare’s Timon mirrors Montaigne’s elegant summary of the legendary figure: “For looke what a man hateth, the same thing he taketh to hart.”<sup>26</sup> Moreover, even as Timon’s nihilism undoes itself by falling prey to a negative version of the very attachments it decries, the play further counters it with the nodal figures of his servants, whose seemingly naive, even delusional cleaving to their master offers an alternative response to Levinas’s query—what is man to man? It is to their place in <italic>Timon</italic>’s story that we will now return.</p>

         <title>Merely Love</title>
         <p>By 4.2, when Flavius first comes into his own as an agent of the dramatic action, the language of love appears to have been damaged beyond repair, corrupted at one end of the play’s ethical spectrum into the empty platitudes mouthed by Timon’s false friends and decimated at the other end by the misanthrope’s verbal denunciations. As Schalkwyk has observed, it becomes Flavius’s task, in this scene and later, to recuperate some of the ethical and affective significance of that language, but crucially, he does so not by underestimating or belittling the material conditions that inevitably shape love’s agency.<sup>27</sup> Indeed, Flavius’s power to do (rather than just be) good in the latter half of the play emerges directly out of his economic means. In 4.2 and later, his carefully husbanded savings allow him to finally exercise the agency that had eluded him earlier and distinguishes him from the play’s other, equally exemplary servants.<sup>28</sup> It also distinguishes him from Timon for whom gold-money functions as the archetypal bad “object,” the consummate icon of human perfidy: a “yellow slave” whose very pliability to the wills of its human masters turns it into a “visible god” that “speak’st with every tongue / To every purpose” (4.3.34, 382, 384–85). While gold emblematizes for Timon the triumph of material appetite over moral rectitude, the uses Flavius finds for his gold show that the material imperatives of human existence do not necessarily negate the call of ethics. Unlike Timon (and unlike the play’s plutocrats and fortune hunters), Flavius might be said to confront the seemingly toxic combination of money’s moral neutrality and pragmatic indispensability as a spur to ethical action rather than as an index of the irrelevance of moral values in <italic>l’age d’or</italic>.</p>
         <p>The precise nature of Flavius’s ethical agency is perhaps best illuminated by his dramatic function as Timon’s steward. In A. D. Nuttall’s view, Flavius is entirely driven by the logic of his role as steward: “The Steward, even amid the ruin of his house, must go on dispensing money because his identity is invested in his office: his <italic>esse</italic> is to dispense. It is as if, were he to cease to have gold, he would not only be Timon’s Steward no longer, he would cease to exist.”<sup>29</sup> But Flavius’s seemingly mechanistic investment in his role might also originate from the fact that the designation, “steward,” names an ethical condition of being—and acting—for another particularly familiar to early modern moral commentators, who enjoined those with means to enact Christian fellowship by recognizing their social responsibilities as stewards rather than absolute “possessioners” of a wealth that is ultimately God’s.<sup>30</sup> Indeed, the stewardship that Flavius enacts from below points to a responsiveness to the plight of others that potentially disturbs the hierarchical structure of duties and responsibilities informing moral-economic commentaries of the period that were, after all, primarily concerned to remind the ruling classes of their responsibilities while enjoining those below to passively accept their lot as God’s will.</p>
         <p>Flavius’s identity as a steward is critical to the play’s attempt to reimagine giving as a form of service from below, rather than an exercise, from above, of benevolent paternalism. The focal event of 4.2 is his offer to share his savings with his destitute fellow servants:<disp-quote>

            </disp-quote>Recognizing both the servants’ material need and their shared affective history as “fellows” serving a common master, Flavius’s offer seems meant to at once recall and fulfill the promise of Timon’s failed Eucharists earlier in the play. Flavius’s gift realizes his master’s unfulfilled fantasy of fellowship in the first banquet scene—of friends “like brothers commanding one another’s fortunes”—but it does so by radically altering the terms of Timon’s bounty. Flavius’s recognition of the servants’ need does not blind him to his own—he “shares” rather than gives his all, keeping something back to give elsewhere and, presumably, to nourish himself as well. Furthermore, in making the gift in the name of an absent third, “our master,” Flavius presents himself as a conduit for rather than source of generosity and is thereby able to confirm fellowship without recreating the servile dependency that Timon’s bounty fostered.</p>
         <p>Configured thus, this fellowship of the destitute in 4.2 does not only nostalgically commemorate a community on the verge of disintegration; it also approaches the more enduring, albeit equally precarious fellowship of the biblical remnant, that embattled group of the faithful who repeatedly, in various episodes of the Old Testament (as well as in the writings of the prophets), survive catastrophe to form “the nucleus for the possible future rebuilding of the community,” a community that, in <italic>Timon</italic>, is evoked in primarily ethical rather than theological terms.<sup>31</sup> Indeed, in Flavius’s encounter with Timon in the next scene, the ethical force of the remnant surfaces in the form of a powerful need, embodied in the person of the disconsolate steward, to acknowledge the other. Flavius’s stewardship thus comes to describe a form of subjectivity that is constituted through an ethical and affective attachment to an other without whom the “I” cannot exist.</p>
         <p>Exploring the poetics of intersubjective acknowledgment in the encounter between Flavius and Timon, Schalkwyk has called attention to the steward’s hope-filled declaration on seeing his master—“He’s caught me in his eye” (4.3.464)—as the seminal moment of the encounter between master and man. While Flavius “seeks above all … to be ‘caught in the eye’—to be acknowledged fully in the master’s gaze,” Timon too may be rescued “through the recognition (as both subject and object) of his servant.” Drawing on Stanley Cavell’s analysis of the ethics of acknowledgment in Shakespearean drama, Schalkwyk argues that Flavius’s willing offer of service to his master constitutes a declaration of love that, if acknowledged, would allow Timon to redeem himself through a recognition of “the human dynamics of service as love and love as service.”<sup>32</sup> Such recognition would allow Timon to acknowledge not only the humanity he shares with his servant, as Schalkwyk suggests, but also that this humanity is grounded in their mutual object status, their shared abjection to the eye of another. “He’s caught me in his eye” is at once a declaration of vulnerability in the face of the other, as the object of the other’s gaze, and an acknowledgment of the (potential) vulnerability of the other to the aspect one presents. What Timon will see, Flavius hopes, is his “honest grief” at the pitiful object before him—“O you gods! / Is yon despised and ruinous man my lord, / Full of decay and failing?” (lines 453–55)—which may allow the all-doubting misanthrope to make <italic>himself</italic> vulnerable enough to “accept” that grief. That, having forsworn “objects,” he might yet prove unequal to their affective power.</p>
         <p>The drama of intersubjective acknowledgment that the play stages through this encounter between Flavius and Timon invites further reflection in terms of Levinas’s account of the ethical valence of the face. For Levinas, the encounter with the other produces a dilemma that fundamentally conditions the emergence of the ethical subject and that resonates deeply with the dilemma that the tearful face of his steward poses for Timon. Levinas writes: “The face of the other in its precariousness and defenselessness, is for me at once the temptation to kill and the call to peace, the ‘You shall not kill.’”<sup>33</sup> The precariousness of the other produces an ethical struggle—to kill or not to kill—that pits responsibility for another against the will for self-preservation. Parsing this moment in Levinas, Judith Butler traces the enigmatic temptation to kill elicited by the face of the other to the “violence” implicit “in being addressed, given a name, subject to a set of impositions, compelled to respond to an exacting alterity,” because “[no one] controls the terms by which one is addressed.”<sup>34</sup> The encounter with the other stages a double vulnerability: in being exposed to and addressed by the vulnerability of the other, one is rendered vulnerable to that address in ways beyond one’s control or choosing. One may then accept that vulnerability to the other’s address as the grounding condition of engagement with the other, as Flavius will urge his master to do, or one may reject it, and so yield to the temptation to annihilate the other by refusing to acknowledge the address in the name of preserving one’s autonomy—which is the path Timon takes when he makes “Swear against objects” his war cry.</p>
         <p>Flavius’s final encounter with Timon in 4.3, then, becomes the play’s way of testing Timon’s conviction that the murderous solitude of all against all is the true human condition. When Timon, who “must ever doubt, though ne’er so sure,” wonders aloud if his steward’s kindness is merely a “usuring kindness, and as rich men deal gifts, / Expecting in return twenty for one?” (lines 504–5), Flavius responds:<disp-quote>

                  <verse-line>For this one wish: that you had power and wealth</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>To requite me by making rich yourself.</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>(Lines 510–17)</verse-line>
               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote>Flavius’s closing wish, that Timon (of whose newfound wealth he presumably has not heard) could requite him by “making rich yourself,” is at one level an entirely pragmatic and conservative one: it expresses, in short, a desire to return to the status quo that prevailed before Timon’s ruin. As such, Flavius’s wish suggests the degree to which his own sense of well-being is bound up with his master’s and marks his recognition—in keeping with the office of steward—of the material underpinnings of that well-being.<sup>35</sup> But, even so, Flavius’s passionate self-defense, considered in the context of the broader trajectory of his actions in the play’s second half, also suggests that his “love” cannot be reduced to the self-centered profit motive that Timon suspects—and even, in some perverse way, hopes—has moved his steward to seek him out.</p>
         <p>In an essay tracing the biblical resonances of Timon’s misanthropy, Ken Jackson has argued that Flavius’s “passionate wish” articulates “a pure obligation or ethics towards the other, one not grounded in any economy of exchange,” and as such, represents what Timon’s world-negating, Abrahamic misanthropy has been seeking all along: “The one thing Flavius will exchange is impossible. He cannot exchange his ‘gift’ for wealth for Timon because Timon already has wealth. … Timon, who has been seeking the wholly other all along, finds it here in the figure of Flavius’s ‘impossible’ gesture.”<sup>36</sup> But, while Flavius’s “wish” does exceed—without entirely negating—the economy of exchange, and while this may be what Timon has been seeking all along, it also jeopardizes his world-negating misanthropy. If, as Jackson suggests, this exchange recalls Abraham, it is perhaps less to suggest an affinity between Timon and the Abraham who denies Isaac while cleaving absolutely to God, the “wholly other,” than to contrast Timon with the more sociable Abraham who intercedes on behalf of Sodom and Gomorrah upon learning of God’s intention to destroy the cities, securing from God the promise that even if he finds “ten righteous” in the two cities, he will not destroy them for the “ten’s sake” (Gen. 18:22–33). These “ten righteous,” designated as the faithful remnant in the biblical discourse, here assume the guise of the faithful servant whose tearful visage threatens to undo Timon’s visceral aversion to the “eyes of man” (4.3.40): “Ne’er did poor steward wear a truer grief / For his undone lord,” Flavius pleads, “than mine eyes for you” (4.3.473–74).</p>
         <p>It is a testimony to the power of his love that Flavius comes as close as he does to breaking his master’s resolve, forcing upon him the problem of “one honest man” (4.3.492) that tests the security of his stance of universal hatred in a manner reminiscent of Abraham’s challenge to God. Faced with a love as implacable, for all its meekness, as his own hatred, Timon cannot but acknowledge its force: “How fain would I have hated all mankind / And thou redeem’st thyself” (4.3.494–95). What Timon cannot, however, bring himself to acknowledge are the broader, societal implications of Flavius’s appeal. Hence his insistence on Flavius’s uniqueness as “Thou singly honest man” (4.3.518), as the one exception to the rule of universal villainy—as, in fact, the exception that proves that rule. By emphasizing Flavius’s uniqueness, Timon can hold on to his belief that the only honest society is one that eschews attachments, an antisociety founded on autonomous isolation. “Go, live rich and happy,” he tells Flavius, pressing gold on him:<disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>But thus conditioned: thou shalt build from men.</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>But let the famished flesh slide from the bone</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Ere thou relieve the beggar.</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>(4.3.520–24)</verse-line>
               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote>Where wealth for Flavius serves as a means of engaging more fruitfully with the world (which might explain why he does not explicitly refuse Timon’s offer), for Timon its best use is to secure disengagement from the world and its objects. Thus, his condition for showering Flavius with gold—“let famished flesh slide from the bone / Ere thou relieve the beggar”—rearticulates in the context of civic life his injunction to Alcibiades to spare none in his war on Athens. What he will not—indeed cannot—do, is what Flavius wants most. He cannot acknowledge his own object status by accepting his dependent’s offer of comfort and service, by becoming, in effect, his dependent’s dependent. To do so, as Timon understands well enough, is tantamount to reentering society.</p>
         <p>But even as Flavius, the play’s steward of the “bond in men,” fails in his particular attempt to restore his bond with his master, the play subtly affirms the ubiquity of this desire in the unlikeliest of ways, in the unlikeliest of places. The ethos of service may be the ideal fruition of this desire for social attachment, but even where service fails, and social bonds seem utterly disrupted, they nonetheless continue to exert an inescapable power on <italic>Timon</italic>’s characters. Thus, physically splintered and morally corrupt as it is, Athenian society seems incapable of the solitude to which Timon condemns it. Barring Apemantus, Timon’s rival misanthrope (and interestingly, Flavius himself), none of the characters who visit Timon in the play’s second half appear alone. The bandits rove in a group; we meet the prostitutes, Timandra and Phrynia, as a pair, accompanying Alcibiades. And even that unholy nexus of false service, the hypocritical Poet and Painter, archrivals though they are, never appear but in each other’s company—as though even the worst of mankind cannot exist by themselves but must seek out like-minded company, however perverse that association may be.</p>
         <p>But what do such associations mean for <italic>Timon</italic>’s fractured civic community? For Timon, the bandits, prostitutes, and warmongers who appear before him in the wilderness emblematize the deceptive, corrupt society that has bred them: plying their trades more honestly than their social betters, they serve merely to demystify the laws and norms holding together the sociopolitical order as empty fictions masking man’s essential bestiality. But it is not at all clear that the play shares this perspective. In fact, the perverse social groupings in the play’s second half point not only to the fragility of the “bond in men” but also to its powerful hold on even the most self-centered of characters. Admittedly, that hold is not always—perhaps even hardly ever—ethical in any absolute sense. Indeed, even when asserted in ethical terms, such bonds can be merely delusional imaginings, as in Timon’s fantasy of the Athenian plutocracy as a band of friends “like brothers commanding one another’s fortunes.” And conversely, even when bespeaking genuine attachment, such bonds can be all too fragile, like the already distant memory of “better times” with which Flavius seeks to seal the remnant community of servants at the moment of their dispersal into an uncertain future. Yet, with all these caveats in place, the play also acknowledges that such fragile affirmations of fellowship can at times acquire the potential to override the mutual hostility, faithlessness, and internecine rivalry that has come to define the Athenian polis. An exemplary instance is offered by the anonymous messenger who, late in the play, brings the Athenian Senate word of Alcibiades’s impending alliance with Timon:<disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>I met a courier, one mine ancient friend,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Whom, though in general part we were opposed,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Yet our old love made a particular force</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>And made us speak like friends.</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>(5.3.6–9)</verse-line>
               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote>Even as the message he bears augers the chaos of civil war, the means whereby the messenger has obtained it belies the ubiquitous disintegration of social bonds that civil war portends. As with the fidelity of the servants who wear Timon’s livery on their hearts, love too here acquires an agency of its own—it is presented as something beyond the will or choice of these two servant messengers, who find themselves on opposite sides of the brewing political conflict but who cannot help but succumb to a remembered affection that supersedes their immediate political loyalties. Against the autonomous subjectivity of <italic>homo homini lupus</italic>, whose culmination is civil war, the play, then, sets the “particular force” of an “old love” as an acknowledgment, however muted, of the “bond in men.” But what significance—if any—does such love bear for the scene of political rapprochement that follows?</p>

            <italic>Timon</italic>’s closing scenes take us to an Athens seemingly chastened by the fury it has unleashed and which barely averts the further catastrophe of outright civil war through an eleventh-hour reconciliation between the Senate and Alcibiades. While some scholars have argued for that reconciliation’s redemptive potential, the dominant critical consensus has been more skeptically inclined, viewing it as a gold-soiled compromise between warring elites, whose redemptive elements, if present at all, are severely undercut by the moral ambiguity surrounding the principal actors, Alcibiades and the Athenian Senate.<sup>37</sup> In view of these and other uncertainties, <italic>Timon</italic>’s concluding scenes seem to powerfully elicit, without clearly answering, Levinas’s question: is the turn to the polis, to the language of law and order and the responsibilities of power, an act of fear or of faith? Does Athens, as it is reimagined in the closing scene, emerge out of a quasi-Hobbesian fear at societal disarray or out of the “particular force” of the loving service and fellowship that motivates the play’s frequently anonymous, subordinate characters? Do these characters prepare the conditions for the reestablishment of civic order at the play’s end or do they haunt its edges in silent rebuke of its hollowness?</p>
         <p>Ultimately, in <italic>Timon</italic>, the place of service and fellowship in society is perhaps best seen as the subject of what Eagleton calls tragedy’s “skeptical faith.” Seen in this light, the seeming attenuation of civic idealism in the play may well stem from the play’s awareness of its fragility rather than constituting a testimony to its hollowness. The fragility of that ideal is perhaps best captured by the play’s repeated evocations of embattled remnant communities existing as dispersed pockets of virtue in the interstices of a rotting state apparatus. The ethical claim of the remnant is evoked one last time in the play’s final scene when the Senators, responding to Alcibiades’s belligerent approach, make their case for clemency in terms recalling the Abrahamic challenge that Flavius embodied for Timon. “These walls of ours / Were not erected by their hands from whom / You have received your griefs,” says one Senator, while another adds:<disp-quote>
               <verse-group>

               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote>The affective “objects” Timon had once exhorted Alcibiades to resist—weeping mothers, crying babies, wailing priests—here reappear as the civic remnant in whose name the Senators make their appeal for clemency. Evoked not as a distinct and distinguishable political entity but an assemblage of disparate agencies and affects (“hands,” “cradle,” “kin”), they nonetheless constitutes a powerful (and politically significant) reminder of the complex network of dependencies and ethical responsibilities that make up the heteronomous fabric of social life.</p>
         <p>In the end, the Senators do succeed in placating Alcibiades by appealing to his affective investment in, and responsibility to, his native “Athenian cradle” over and against his commitment to a feudal aristocratic military ethos—an ethos that had once led him to declare “’Tis honour with most lands to be at odds / Soldiers should brook as little wrong as gods” (5.5.38, 3.6.115). By appealing to Alcibiades not as a martial hero but as one “countryman” alongside others, the Senators tentatively reconstitute the native community of the polis, rather than the individual lord or warrior clan, as the ideal object of service. Evoked in the sparest possible terms, as the repository of past glory (walls, trophies, towers, schools) and future possibility (“Athenian cradle”), a barely outlined conglomeration of things, people, and affects, Athens acquires an iconic aura: its visible markers point beyond themselves to an idea that escapes full embodiment and is all the more powerful for that reason.</p>
         <p>Yet this implicit iconization of Athens is not without ambivalence. For one thing, if Athens is to supplant Timon in the play’s idiom as the focus of communal worship, as the fulcrum around which the civic community may be rebuilt, the rhetoric of patriotism that underpins this translocation of service from the noble household to the polis remains vulnerable to the idolatrous impulse that proved so ethically disastrous for the Athenian public body earlier in the play. Tellingly, the Senators’ iconization of Athens evades the more difficult question of structural reformation: by suggesting that it is “private faults” that need culling, not the “great towers, trophies, and schools” of Athens, they troublingly bypass the culpability of those iconic institutions and monuments under whose powerful shadow such faults find occasion to grow (5.5.23–26). The city’s storied walls, trophies, and schools may embody the concerted activity of civic service, undertaken by the many for the many, in pursuit of an ideal of community, of the “bond in men.” But, as both Timon and Alcibiades learnt, they can also shelter abuse of power and avoidance of responsibility under the cover of the very “public laws” (5.5.62) to which Alcibiades now cedes control as he capitulates to the Senators’ plea. Thus, if the mythmaking that the Senators engage in here is essential to social cohesion, alerting us to that “remembered sense of value” without which civic life is impossible,<sup>38</sup> it cannot fully offset the violence at the heart of the civilizing project—a violence that surfaces in their awkwardly pastoral image of Alcibiades as a blood-besmirched shepherd, one whose stewardship, unlike Flavius’s, requires him to “cull” and “kill” as much as protect his flock (5.5.42–44).</p>
         <p>Flavius’s appearance at the Senators’ side in 5.2, where they try (in vain) to persuade Timon to lead them out of their present danger, further highlights the ethical ambiguity underlying the project of civic reformation. Flavius’s final appearance is crucial to the play’s translocation of the ethic of service from the household to the polis: in dramatic terms, he serves here as a hinge character, connecting the play’s parallel plots of domestic ruination (centered on Timon) and civic disorder (centered on Alcibiades). But his presence in the scene carries a symbolic charge that goes beyond mere dramatic functionality. Sometimes read as a sign that he has at last abandoned his master, Flavius’s appearance alongside the Athenian delegation may also, however, signal the possibility of an ethical community more broadly conceived than the fragmented coalitions of the good in an otherwise malevolent universe of all against all that we witness in the play’s latter half. As the play’s iconic representative of loving service, Flavius arguably bolsters the senate’s legitimacy by lending its mission the moral authority of his presence, but his presence also complicates our reception of their appeal. If Timon accedes to their plea, the Senators report, the repentant Athenian “public body” is prepared to shower on him “even such heaps and sums of love and wealth, / As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs, / And write in thee the figures of their love, / Ever to read them thine” (5.2.37–40). Their appeal is at one level commensurate with the sense that we gain from Flavius’s gifts in the prior act that the two languages of love and money are not necessarily opposed, that material means can, in fact, be steered toward loving ends. But the question remains: which is the means here, and which the end? It is not clear if the Athenians, or the Senators who represent them here, understand the importance of making that distinction, even as Flavius’s near-silent presence on the edge of the scene reminds us of its salience to any project of remaking the civic body.</p>
         <p>But the greatest impediment to that project of civic renewal is posed by Timon himself, whose implacable hostility to the world casts its last, long shadow on the play in the form of his epitaph, dutifully brought to Alcibiades by a conscientious soldier who, ignorant of the script, has impressed it on a tablet of wax for his master to decipher:<disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Here lies a wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Seek not my name. A plague consume you, wicked caitiffs left!</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Here lie I, Timon, who, alive, all living men did hate.</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay not here thy gait.</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>(5.4.70–74)<sup>39</sup>
                  </verse-line>
               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote>Read at precisely the moment when Alcibiades accedes to the Senators’ plea, the epitaph calls attention to the ethical ambiguity of the scene of political rapprochement that we have just witnessed. But the incoherent, even self-cancelling structure of the epitaph’s contradictory couplets also reproduces the fundamental instability of the misanthrope’s world denial. Addressed to passers-by who might pause to read the stone inscription, the epitaph’s two successive couplets split the misanthrope into cursing subject—“Seek not my name. A plague consume you, wicked caitiffs left”—and accursed object—“Pass by and curse thy fill.” As such, the epitaph also confirms, however perversely, the need for dialogic engagement that persists at the heart of even the most absolute form of world denial. The double epitaph thus testifies to the need to address another, to be both subject and object of an address—that persists in, and even constitutes what appears here, finally, as the irreducibly heteronomic core of the misanthropic self.</p>
         <p>Alcibiades’s interpretation of Timon’s epitaph brings to the foreground the affective engagement with others’ lives that has thus far characterized the play’s representations of servant subjectivity. What Timon seemingly intends as a mocking laugh directed from the freedom of the grave at the misery of lives lived in a “false world” (4.3.371), Alcibiades reinterprets, in light perhaps of his own recent softening, as a final admission of grief’s affective pull:<disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Though thou abhorred’st in us our human griefs,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Scorned’st our brains’ flow and those our droplets which</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye</verse-line>

                  <verse-line>Hereafter more.</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>(5.5.73–79)</verse-line>
               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote>Timon’s sea grave enables Alcibiades to locate a “rich conceit” in the epitaph’s flinty heart. That “rich conceit” is the possibility that “others’ lives” will invite not only the misanthrope’s abhorrence of human villainy or scorn at the weak “droplets / Which from niggard nature fall” but tears of mourning from which the misanthrope himself will not be excluded. The tears of Flavius and of the grieving fellowship of disbanded servants he commemorates in 4.2 thus find their way back into the play’s end, even as misanthropic disengagement must finally give way, in the “rich conceit” Alcibiades attributes to Timon, to the desire to be mourned and thereby acknowledged as an object of another’s grieving. Coming as it does from Alcibiades, and at this particular moment in the play, this acknowledgment of grief’s potency, its capacity to undo even the most obdurate of beings, creates an opening through which the ethic of service—allied as it is, in this play, with the affects of grief, love, and vulnerability as modes of engagement with the other—might enter political life.<sup>40</sup>

         <p>Yet Alcibiades’s own last words, appended to his tribute to Timon and functioning as an epilogue to the play, register a persistent ambiguity about the degree to which this affective engagement with the other will inform the work of civic rebuilding when he, once renegade servant of the state, assumes his new role as Athens’s savior:<disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Bring me into your city,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>And I will use the olive with my sword,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Prescribe to other, as the other’s leech.</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>(5.5.80–82)</verse-line>
               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote>Having momentarily laid to rest Timon’s unruly “memory,” Alcibiades’s closing vision revivifies it in this admission that violence and disintegration are as endemic to civic order as the desire for peace and fellowship. Alcibiades’s epilogue does not unequivocally answer Levinas’s question, suggesting rather that this question cannot be answered once and for all—that the founding imperatives of civic life are a matter of ongoing ethical struggle between the contending possibilities of peace and war, between the contrary pulls of self-preservation and responsibility for “my fellow.” The play also leaves unclear what Alcibiades’s role will be in managing this societal flux. He certainly does not eschew the use of his sword, however tempered by “the olive,” and his concluding desire to “make war breed peace” sounds too close for comfort to justifications of war in our own—and other—times. Yet, if the “I,” presented as the governing subject of the last sentence in the above quotation, projects the autonomy of a despot in the making, the penultimate line, with its awkward, repeated stress on “make” suggests the struggle with historical and material conditions which limit that autonomy, even as they define the scope of the responsibility that Alcibiades is now about to assume as his city’s physic.</p>
         <p>The manifold ethical ambiguities that reverberate through the closing scene’s depiction of Alcibiades’s uneasy reincorporation into the Athenian polity doubtless condition the discomfort many critics have experienced in accepting the terms of that reconciliation at face value, as a straightforward assertion of the virtues of patriotic service in the face of anarchy. Certainly, the degree to which the ethical values of service may come to inform or shape political life remains unclear at the play’s end. However, what the play’s end does affirm—precisely through the ambivalences that mark the rapprochement between Alcibiades and the Senate—is the enduring political significance of the ethic of responsiveness to (and responsibility for) other lives, an ethic embodied most fully by the play’s subordinate, servant figures. From this perspective, we might see the play’s closing juxtaposition of Alcibiades’s elegy for Timon with his own final assumption of authority over the fate of the polis as constituting something of a double ending, pointing to two contrary visions of life in the polis. Alcibiades’s intention to “use the olive with my sword” and to make “war breed peace” conceives of civic life as comprising an unending struggle between the oppositional impulses of self-preservation and responsibility for one’s fellows. But his prior acknowledgment of grief’s power to undo the most strident declarations of autonomy points to an alternative ethical framework for rebuilding the polity—on the basis of a shared apprehension of loss, vulnerability, and interdependence that cuts across the polarities of self and other, servant and master, war and peace. To secrete such a vision into a play widely acknowledged to be one of Shakespeare’s darkest may well be nothing more than a “rich conceit.” But it is paradoxically only out of the heart of such darkness as <italic>Timon</italic> exposes us to that it becomes possible—even necessary—to articulate such a vision.</p>
