<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIEWS &amp; REVIEWS "Their behaviour generates lifelong health anxiety" Des Spence on the parents of priviledged children, p 910 Robots don't perform surgery, surgeons do PERSONAL VIEW DavidMLloyd Over the past five years we have seen a huge rise in the number of robotically performed operations worldwide. Most patients who undergo radical prostatectomy in the United States, for example, now have "robotic surgery" or "robotically assisted surgery." This trend is likely to continue despite the lack of evidence from multicentred randomised controlled trials to prove that it is safer than conventional surgery. Sceptics think that this development may be industry driven, because robotic surgery is now part of a billion dollar market in the United States. Attractive as they may appear, surgical robotic machines are very expensive. They cost between Elm (€1.2m, $1.6m) and £3m, have annual servicing fees of about £200 000, and have additional disposable costs of at least £1000 a procedure. In addition to the risks, costs, and need for training, a fundamental problem remains with the definition of robotic surgery, because robots themselves do not perform any Clinicians should continue to educate the public that pure robotic surgery belongs to the realm of science fiction procedure independently. We are, therefore, misleading ourselves as clinicians in thinking that any surgery is performed by robots; more importantly, we are misleading the public, because many patients assume that a robot may actually perform part of a complex operation. Patients are being seduced into having "robotic" surgery because they perceive it to be safer and more precise than surgery performed by a surgeon alone. Contrary to popular belief, robots do not perform surgery; they never have, and probably never will. Aristotle, in 322BC, suggested that some tools could replace slaves, and Leonardo Da Vinci in 1495 designed a mechanical device that looked like an automated knight. These are perhaps the first references to what we now understand as robots. However, it was not until 1921 that the word "robot" was introduced by Karel Capek in his Czech play entitled Rossuum's Universal Robots. Technophiles may be disappointed to learn that the word robot is not an acronym but merely a Czech translation for "compulsory labour." Science fiction writers, including Isaac Azimov, have used the term robot extensively, and we as clinicians should continue to educate the public that pure robotic surgery also belongs to the realm of science fiction. To most of us, robotic behaviour implies the use of automation without consideration of ethical values, moral judgment, or human influence. Robots can spray paint cars, clean sitting rooms, and mow lawns to perfection while workers pursue other duties. By contrast, surgeons manipulating the mechanical arms of a Da Vinci robot cannot leave the control panel because they have to perform the surgery themselves, albeit remotely. Leading centres, such as the Carnegie Mellon Robotic Institute in Pittsburgh, have built amazing machines that are capable of complex automated behaviour. HERB (the home exploring robotic butler) can serve coffee, clean tables, and navigate through the most cluttered of environments using planning, grasp, and manipulation, with added "torque constraint." However, HERB cannot remove an appendix, let alone perform complex surgery. Asimo (Honda's "advanced step in innovative mobility"), an anthropomorphic robot, astounded crowds at Expo 2005 by demonstrating human-like movements, and Topio (the Tosy company's ping pong playing robot), another humanoid robot, played table tennis at the Tokyo International Robotic Exhibition in 2009. Yet despite these wonderful technological breakthroughs, robots cannot perform the smallest of surgical tasks independently. We may accept that they can help surgeons perform more precise surgery with the use of mechanically assisted arms, but it is the surgeon who ultimately controls all the movements. More importantly, it is the surgeon who makes the decisions as to what, when, and where to cut. Although there is a perception that robotic surgery is safer, and this may prove a reality in the fullness of time, the first lawsuit for medical negligence involving a robot was issued in Boston in 2010. We await the outcomes of other lawsuits for "robotically damaged" patients, but must remember that it will be the surgeon who is ultimately liable and not the robot. Perhaps the term robotic surgery should be abandoned completely and phrases such as "remote access surgery" should be used. Patients may understand the terminology better and may not be as misled if they were to consent to "mechanically assisted surgery" performed by a surgeon as opposed to an operation performed by a robot. "Remote access mechanically assisted surgery" (RAMAS) is perhaps an acronym that represents a more honest description of what occurs during "robotic" surgery. The terminology may be less misleading and more acceptable, particularly to our technophile patients, who may understand that "ramasic surgery" would involve a surgeon using technology to make the surgery more precise and possibly safer. Remarkable as they are, robots remain our ever ready surgical assistants and not our surgical replacements.
