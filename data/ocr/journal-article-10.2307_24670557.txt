Though the dominant scholarly posi tion regards the Shema as a liturgical affirmation of key doctrinal commitments, this article demonstrates that performance of these rituals was also a means of internalizing the biblical text. As such, these rituals had much in common with TorahTorah study, which was also a means of internalizing the biblical text. The article makes this argument by examining Second Temple sources which cite, paraphrase, or allude to the Shema verses. Where Second Temple sources engage the verses of ritual instruction, they regard the rituals as a means of internalizing various com mitments (justice, the nature of God, divine beneficence). Against this backdrop, it becomes clear that for the rabbis too these rituals were a means of internalizing something: biblical scripture.

Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 Introduction Μ.Μ.Μ. Berakhot 3:3 provides a short catalogue of women's exemptions and obligations vis-a-vis various liturgical and textual practices: Women, slaves and minors are exempt from the recitation of Shema and from tefillin,tefillin, and obligated with regard to the Prayer, the mezuzah and Grace after Meals. Here we learn that women are exempt from reciting the Shema and wear ing tefillin, but obligated to pray the Amidah, recite the Grace after Meals and post a mezuzah on their doorposts. Unfortunately, in classic fashion the Mishnah states these legal conclusions without providing a rationale for them.2 Women's exemption from reciting the Shema, in particular, pro vokes curiosity since the Shema is a liturgical affirmation of the key doctri nal commitments underlying rabbinic Judaism (belief in one God and dedication to God through performance of the commandments). What is it about the recitation of Shema and wearing tefillin that makes it inap propriate to require women to perform these rituals? What distinguishes Shema and tefillin from the other liturgical and textual practices listed in m.m. Ber. 3:3? This article seeks to answer this question by highlighting the fact that the rabbis regarded recitation of Shema and the wearing of tefillin as forms of Torah study. Since the rabbis claimed to know from elsewhere that women are exempt from Torah study, they concluded that women are also exempt from these rituals which are the functional equivalent of Torah study. The bulk of this article offers a reception history of the bibli cal verses that eventually constituted the Shema liturgy in an effort to reveal how the rabbis came to regard Shema and tefillin practices as forms of Torah study. By the time the Mishnah was recorded in 200 C.E., the rabbis took for granted the existence of a liturgical practice which consisted of reciting three biblical passages (Deut 6:4-9; 11:13-21; Num 15:37-41) twice daily, framed on either end with a set of blessings. The fact that such a practice was standardized and considered of ancient origin by tannaitic times, how 21 According to David Weiss Halivni the Mishnah is exceptional within the Jewish legal corpus in its tendency to state laws apodictically, i.e., without justification. See David Weiss Halivni, Midrash, Mishnah, and Gemara: The Jewish Predilection for Justified Law (Cam bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1986), 38-65.</page><page sequence="3">Ε. S. Alexander /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 531-579 533 ever, does not negate the fact that certain interpretive moves had to be made in order for the Shema verses to be understood as a liturgical unit subject to daily recitation. The rabbinic practices of reciting Shema and wearing tefillin derive from a particular reading of Deut 6:7-8 (see also 11:18-20): "You shall repeat [these words which I command you this day] to your children and you shall speak of them when you sit in your house and when you go on your way, and when you lie down and when you rise up. And you shall bind them as a sign upon your hand and they shall be a frontlet between your eyes." The rabbinic interpretation of these verses assumes that "the words" to be recited in the evening and morning ("when you lie down" and "rise up") and "the words" to be worn as frontlets and on the arm are the full text of the paragraph containing these verses, that is Deut 6:4-9. In other words, the rabbis understand the term "these words" to be self-referential.3 Reviewing the process by which this interpretation came about reveals how and why the rabbis came to regard the recitation and binding of "these words" as forms ofTorah study. During the latter half of the Second Temple period the biblical verses that make up the rabbinic Shema were attracting attention because of their doctrinal centrality and the fact that they prescribe a concrete set of embod ied rituals. Though a variety of sources attest to the importance of the Shema verses during the Second Temple period, the sources differ widely on their reasons for engaging the Shema verses. A survey of the Second Temple sources that allude to, discuss or cite the Shema verses reveals the range of meanings that these verses carried in the period before the rabbis were active. Examining these sources highlights the distinctive meanings the Shema and its attendant rituals had for the rabbis, among them the idea that recitation of the Shema and wearing tefillin were forms ofTorah 31 Following an established trend in scholarship Cohn characterizes this interpretation as "literalist" as opposed to "figurative." See Yehudah B. Cohn, Tangled up in Text: Tefillin and the the Ancient World (Providence, R.I.: Brown Judaic Studies, 2008), 87-88, 92, 100 and elsewhere. His characterization focuses on the interpretation of the scriptural words "recite" and "bind": is one to recite and bind the words literally or is this a mere figure of speech indicating one should "internalize" the words? Within the "literalist" interpretation one can further distinguish between different ways of interpreting the term "these words" which are the subject of the ritual: does the term "these words" refer to the instructional verses (i.e., is the text self-referential?) or does it refer to some other entity (like justice, law, or Torah generally)? The self-referential interpretation might be referred to as "doubly literalist" since it requires a literal reading of the terms "recite'V'bind" and a literalist reading of the term "these words."</page><page sequence="4">534 Ε. S. Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 study. Before turning to the Second Temple sources, however, it will be helpful to review the contents of the three biblical passages that eventually came to be the rabbinic Shema. 1. The Rabbinic Shema The rabbinic Shema consists of three biblical passages (Deut 6:4-9; 11:13־ 21 21; Num 15:37-41) framed by a set of two blessings preceding the biblical passages and one or two blessings following them.4 The order and the con tent of the biblical passages are attested in several tannaitic sources.5 Con ventional scholarly wisdom sees the Shema liturgy as a ritual re-enactment of Israel's covenantal dedication to God.6 When performed liturgically, 41 Kimelman discusses the theological framing provided by the framing blessings. He argues that the emet veyatziv blessing is quite early and it, alongside the biblical passages, formed the earliest core of the Shema liturgy. He further argues that in its earliest form, the ritual functioned as a re-enactment of the covenant. The first and last blessings were added at a later stage and form an envelope structure around the covenantal re-enactment material lending it a new set of meanings. In its new configuration the Shema liturgy functions as a coronation of God as King/Master of the Universe. See Reuven Kimelman, "The Shema Liturgy: From Covenant Ceremony to Coronation," in Kenishta: Studies of the Synagogue World World vol. 1 (ed. Joseph Tabory; Ramat Can: Bar-llan University Press, 2001), 9-105 [Hebrew], ,י See m. Ber. 2:2, Si ρ re Deut. 34-35 and Sipre Num. 115. M. Tarn. 5:1 refers to a Shema liturgy that was recited by the priests as part of the morning sacrificial rites. In this source, three paragraphs of the rabbinic Shema are preceded by a recitation of the Ten Command ments. On the reliability of m. Tam. 5:1 as an description of Second Temple practice, see Ε. E. Urbach, "The Role of the Ten Commandments in Jewish Worship," in The Ten Com mandmentsmandments in History and Tradition (ed. Ben-Zion Segal and Gershon Levi; Jerusalem: Magnes, 1985), 161-89 [Hebrew]; Kimelman, "From Covenant to Coronation," 13, n. 13, 68-80; Joseph Tabory, "Prayers and Berakhot," in Literature of the Sages, Part. 2 (ed.

Levenson, Sinai and Zion: An Entry Into the Jewish Bible (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1987), 81-86; Moshe Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11: A New Translation with Introduction Introduction and Commentary (AB 5; New York: Doubleday, 1991), 349-54; Kimelman, "From Covenant to Coronation," 77; Lawrence Schiffman, Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1994), 293; Tabory, "Prayers and Berakhot," 292. Levenson, Sinai and Zion, 86, for example, writes: "The recitation of the Shma is the rabbbinic covenantal renewal ceremony." Another popular view is that recitation of the Shema functions as an affirmation of faith. See Albert Baumgarten, "Invented Traditions of the Maccabean Era," in Geschichte—Tradition—Reflexion (ed.

Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 535 these verses were understood to speak not only to a historic set of relation ships, but also to a relationship which endures in all its vitality in the pres ent context.7 Rabbinic sources provide a title for each of the three paragraphs; the titles correspond to the first word or several words of each paragraph.8 The first word of the first paragraph is shema (lit. "hear" or "listen") and the whole liturgical cycle takes its name from this paragraph. The first paragraph of the Shema is drawn from Deut 6 and reads as follows (all biblical translations are taken from NJPS): [DOCTRINAL PROLOGUE:] (4) Hear, Ο Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord alone. (5) You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. [TRANSITIONAL VERSE:] (6) Take to heart these instructions (devarim) with which I charge you this day. [RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS:] (7) Impress them upon your children. Recite them when you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you get up. (8) Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them serve as a symbol on your forehead; (9) Inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. As As understood by the rabbis, this passage contains two key elements. The first two verses of the paragraph (6:4-5) offer a doctrinal affirmation.9 Israel is called upon to acknowledge the one-ness of God.10 Acknowledgement of God's unity leads to the next verse which commands Israel to love God. Biblical scholars generally assume that the love requested here is a concrete sign of loyalty—i.e. obedience to God's law." The first two verses, then, proclaim the uniqueness of God and ask Israel to love and obey God as the appropriate expression of their recognition. The next verse (6:6) is transi tional, and it sets the stage for all that follows. The transitional verse states that one should place upon one's heart these instructions (devarim, 71 Levenson writes: "To recite the Shma... is... to become a citizen of the kingdom of God... in the historical present." See Levenson, Sinai and Zion, 85. 81 "This is the same method by which the rabbis name the books of the Pentateuch and chapters of the Mishnah. " Weinfeld observes: "Verses 4 and 5 form... a unit." See Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11, 351. """" Weinfeld discusses the range of ways the term "one" can be understood. See Weinfeld, Deuteronomy Deuteronomy 1-11, 337-38, 349-50. See ibid., 338,351.</page><page sequence="6">536 Ε. S. Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 lit. "words"). In other words, one should internalize them. The biblical text is unclear as to what the "instructions" or "words" to be internalized are.12 The rabbis assumed the term "these words" referred to the very words of this passage (Deut 6:4-9), but as we will see later on, this interpretation is not reflected in the Second Temple sources. As Weinfeld notes, the term may refer to "the general paraenetic discourse of Deuteronomy."" It could also refer to the Decalogue, which is the chapter that immediately precedes this passage and which is named in the biblical text as "these words".14 Alternatively, the term may refer to the first two verses of the paragraph (Deut 6:4-5).15 In any event, the rhetorical function of the transitional verse is to introduce the second section of the paragraph (6:7-9), which alludes to a series of concrete acts by which the covenantal relationship with God is affirmed in one's daily life and transmitted to the next genera tion. One is to (1) teach these words to one's children; (2) recite them; (3) bind them on one's hand or arm16 and on one's forehead; and (4) inscribe them on the doorposts and on one's gates. The second paragraph of the Shema has a similar structure. It too begins with a doctrinally oriented prologue, has a transitional verse, and con eludes with a list of concrete ritual instructions. This paragraph is called "if, then, you obey" (vehayah 'im shamoa) according to the first few words of the passage. Like the first paragraph, the second paragraph is also drawn from Deuteronomy, this time ch. 11, and it reads as follows: [DOCTRINAL PROLOGUE:] (13) If, then, you obey (shamoa tishmeu) the commandments that I enjoin upon you this day, loving the Lord and serv 121 For a range of interpretations of the term "devarim" see ibid., 340; Cohn, Tangled up in Text,Text, 42. 111 See Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11, 340. ,יי This interpretation receives support from the fact that the term "devarim" is used to describe the Decalogue in Deut. 5:22. See discussion in Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11, 340, Cohn, Tangled up in Text, 42, and David Nakman, "The Contents and Order of the Biblical Sections in the Tefillin from Qumran and Rabbinic Halakhah," Cathedra 112 (2004): 19-44 at 23 [Hebrew].

Cohn also argues that the term was understood at Qumran as refer ring to Deut 32 (Song of Moses), which in Deut 32:42 is called "these words" (hadevarim ha'eleh).ha'eleh).

Alexander / Journal for the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 531-579 537 ing him with all your heart and soul, (14) I will grant the rain for your land in season, the early rain and the late. You shall gather in your new grain and wine and oil—(15) I will also provide grass in the fields for your cattle—and thus you shall eat your fill. (16) Take care not to be lured away to serve other gods and bow to them. (17) For the Lord's anger will flare up against you, and He will shut up the skies so that there will be no rain and the ground will not yield its produce, and you will soon perish from the good land that the Lord is assigning to you. [TRANSITIONAL VERSE:] (18) Therefore impress these My words (deva rai)rai) upon your very heart: [RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS:] (18 cont'd) Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them serve as a symbol on your forehead, (19) teach them to your children—reciting them when you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you get up, (20) and inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates—(21) to the end that you and your children may endure, in the land chat the Lord swore to your fathers to assign to them, as long as there is a heaven over the earth. The doctrinal prologue to the second paragraph (Deut 11:13-17) shares a number of linguistic features with that of thse first paragraph. Like the first paragraph, the second paragraph calls upon Israel to "hear" or "obey" (both rendering the root shamd). The object of the call is different, however. In the second paragraph, Israel is called to heed the commandments, rather than to affirm the unity of God. On the basis of this difference, the rabbis read the first paragraph as being about "the acceptance of the yoke of the kingship of heaven" and they read the second paragraph as being about "the acceptance of the yoke of the commandments."17 As in the first para graph (Deut 6:5), Israel is commanded to love God and serve him with all the heart and soul (Deut 11:13). Deut 11:14-17 introduces a new theme. Here we see the trope of reward and punishment commonly associated with Deuteronomy: If Israel hearkens to Gods word, they will receive abundant blessings; if not, the heavens will close up so that no rains fall and the earth yields no produce. The first half of Deut 11:18 is transitional, moving from the doctrinal framework to the concrete domain of action. The transitional verse shares many features with the transitional verse in the first paragraph. Both speak of placing "words" (devarim, earlier translated as "instructions") upon the 171 See m. Ber. 2:2, Sipre Deut. 34 and 35, and Sipre Num. 115 for this language.</page><page sequence="8">538 £ S. Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 heart. As above, the term "words" (devarim) has an unclear referent. The term could refer to deuteronomic instruction generally,18 to the chapter immediately preceding (Deut 10)," to the verses immediately preceding (Deut 11:13-17),20 or as the rabbis understood it, to the full text of this paragraph (Deut 11:13-21). Like the first paragraph of the Shema, the second paragraph concludes with a list of the ritual instructions by which one is to affirm the covenantal devotion to God. The only difference in the concluding sections of the first and second paragraphs is the order in which the rituals are listed. In the second paragraph, one is instructed to (1) bind these words on one's hand or arm and place them on one's forehead; (2) teach these words to one's children; (3) recite them; and (4) inscribe them on the doorposts and on one's gates. The instruction to bind the words on one's hand and place them on one's forehead has been moved, from third place (where it appears in Deut 6) to first place (where it appears here). Finally, the paragraph ends with the blessing that Israel will endure on the land into perpetuity when they follow these instructions. The third paragraph of the rabbinic Shema is taken from the book of Numbers. Unlike the first two paragraphs, the order in which it appears as part of the liturgical text does not conform to the order in which the para graph appears in the canonical biblical text. Some scholars think that the third paragraph was added to the liturgy after the first two paragraphs had already been used together as a liturgical unit.21 The third paragraph, from Num 15, reads as follows: [RITUAL INSTRUCTIONS:] (37) The Lord said to Moses as follows: (38) Speak to the Israelite people and instruct them to make for themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout the ages; let them attach a cord of blue to the fringe at the corner. (39) That shall be your fringe; look "" See Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11, 340 and Cohn, Tangled up in Text, 43. 1,1 Nakman explains that Deut 10 conveys the content of Moses speech and therefore can appropriately be understood as "these words." See Nakman, "The Contents and Order," 23. 2111 See Keel, "Zeichen der Verbundenheit," 165-66. SeeTabory, "Prayers and Berakhot," 291-92; Ismar Elbogen ,Jewish Liturgy: A Compre hensivehensive History (trans. Raymond P. Scheindlin; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1993), 23; Naomi G. Cohen, Philo Judaeus: His Universe of Discourse (Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang, 1995), 108, 167-76. My work takes these researchers' conclusions as a starting point and assumes that the third paragraph was added to the Shema as a secondary develop ment. In light of this assessment, I seek to understand the impetus for reciting only the first two paragraphs of the Shema.</page><page sequence="9">Ε. S. Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 539 at it and recall all the commandments of the Lord and observe them, so that you do not follow your heart and eyes in your lustful urge. [REITERATION OF HISTORICAL BASIS FOR COVENANT:] (40) Thus shall you be reminded to observe all My commandments and to be holy to your God. (41)1 the Lord am your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I, the Lord, your God. The central feature of the third paragraph is the command to perform a ritual act: one is to attach fringes to the corners of one's garment. The ritual function of the fringes is to serve as a reminder: one will look at the fringes and recall God's commandments. Looking at the fringes keeps Israel from lusting after other gods and reminds them of their connection to God. The paragraph ends with a recollection of God's great historical act on behalf of Israel (the Exodus from Egypt); it is this act which serves as the founda tion for the covenantal relationship between Israel and God that endures throughout the ages. Many scholars assume this paragraph was included in the Shema because the Exodus supplies the grounds for Israels cove nantal fealty to God, the relationship which is at the heart of the Shema's proclamation.22 2. Iterations of the Shema Verses in the Second Temple Period There is no doubt that the verses in what later came to be the rabbinic Shema liturgy attracted attention among Jews of the Second Temple period. What is less clear is that these verses were understood as a coherent and fixed liturgical unit in the manner in which the later rabbis took them to be. Based on the patterns of citation, paraphrase and allusion, it appears that Second Temple Jews were drawn to reflect on two different subsets within these verses for two distinct reasons. In one trend, we find Second Temple Jews citing, alluding to or paraphrasing the first two verses of the first paragraph (Deut 6:4-5) because these verses call on Israel to reaffirm their covenantal commitment to God as they did at Sinai when they ί2) See Levenson, Sinai and Zion, 83-84. See also Elbogen, Jewish Liturgy, 23; Nahum Sarna, Exodus (The JPS Torah Commentary; Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 1991), 271. M. Ber. 1:5 refers to this paragraph as "the going forth from Egypt," thereby highlighting its function as affirmation of the covenant. Kimelman offers an interesting review of answers to the question of how the third paragraph is connected with the first two paragraphs. See Kimelman, "From Covenant to Coronation," 16-25.</page><page sequence="10">540 Ε. S. Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 accepted all of God's commandments. In an altogether different trend, we find Second Temple Jews citing, alluding to or paraphrasing the verses that prescribe concrete ritual practices [i.e. the second part of first and second paragraphs (Deut 6:7-9 and Deut 11:18-21) and the verses in the third paragraph about placing fringes on the corner of one's garments, Num 15:38-39)]. It is interesting to note that Second Temple sources generally engage the Shema verses with either one or the other of these interests in mind, but not usually with both at the same time. I argue that the different patterns of citation attest to two distinct sets of interest in the Shema verses. While both of these ways of engaging the Shema verses contribute to the eventual recitation of these verses as a litur gical unit, they suggest that two distinct cultural trends converged and reinforced each other in the creation of the Shema verses as liturgy. On one hand, the sources that cite, allude to or paraphrase the doctrinal prologue of of the first paragraph (Deut 6:4-5) suggest that the Shema liturgy devel oped because ritual repetition of these verses was a way to reaffirm the covenantal pact made at Sinai in which Israel affirmed God's uniqueness and dedicated themselves to performance of God's commandments. Ritual repetition of these verses affirmed that the covenantal relationship was not an artifact of history, but a vital relationship in the on-going present.23 On the other hand, the sources that cite, allude to or paraphrase the verses of ritual instruction suggest that these three paragraphs became linked in the ancient imagination because each refers to concrete ritual practices (tefil lin, mezuzah and tzitzit) that mark one's Jewish commitments on one's body. Eventually the understanding emerged that the rituals should be fulfilled by means of the very text that was assumed to prescribe them. This understanding of the rituals opened up the possibility for a new interpreta tion of the instruction to "repeat [these words] to your children, speaking of them when..." Though earlier interpreters took this verse to require meditation on God generally, the rabbis understood this verse to require that the Shema verses themselves be recited as liturgy. Whereas others had understood the Shema rituals to be a means of internalizing basic Jew ish commitments, the rabbis took them to be a means of internalizing biblical text. 2,1 This is a classic example of the process that Yerushalmi describes whereby memory is cultivated through liturgy and ritual. See Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, Zakhor: Jewish History and Jewish Memory (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1982), 1-26.</page><page sequence="11">Ε. S. Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 541 The impulse to recite the Shema verses as liturgy, then, seems to have arisen as the result of two distinct understandings of what could be ritually accomplished thereby. On the one hand, recitation of the Shema verses was a ritual means of reenacting the covenantal commitments of Sinai. We learn of this ritual sensibility from the sources that engage the doctrinal prologue of the first paragraph. On the other hand, recitation of the Shema verses served as a ritual mechanism by which the practitioner could incor porate biblical text into the self, just as one incorporated biblical text onto the body when one wore tefillin. We learn of this ritual sensibility from the sources that discuss the Shema rituals. Undoubtedly, for the rabbis, these two meanings of the Shema ritual were integrally connected and mutually compatible. Contemporary scholarship, however, has tended to emphasize that aspect of the Shema ritual which functions as covenantal reenactment while neglecting that aspect of Shema ritual which seeks to incorporate the biblical text into the self.24 This article seeks to recover the full range of ritual meanings associated with the rabbinic Shema. When we recognize that recitation of the Shema also functioned as a ritual means of incorpo rating biblical text into the self, we are alerted to the fact that this ritual has much in common with Torah study, which for the rabbis was the premiere ritual by which one engaged the divinity of scripture.25 I argue that the rabbinic exemption of women from Shema (and tefillin) makes most sense when understood in the context of the second ritual sensibility underlying Shema practice, a sensibility which scholars have tended to neglect. This article's attention to rabbinic conceptions of gender stands to illuminate 241241 Exemplars of this scholarly trend are Kimelman, "From Covenant to Coronation"; Schiffman, Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls, 293; Levenson, Sinai and Zion, 80-86; Moshe Weinfeld, The Decalogue and the Recitation of'Shema": The Development of the Confessions (Tel Aviv; Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 2001), 144-62 [Hebrew]; Elbogen, Jewish Liturgy, 22-23; Alan Segal, "Covenant in Rabbinic Writings," Studies in Religion 14 (1985): 53-62 at 60-62. An important exception to this trend is Marc Hirschman, who in his recent book argues that there were some rabbis who saw both the first and second paragraphs of the Shema as forms ofTorah study. See Marc Hirshman, The Stabilization of Rabbinic Culture, 100100 C.E.-350 C.E.: Texts on Education and Their Late Antique Context (Oxford; Oxford University Press, 2009), 32-39. See also Moshe Benovitz, "Shinun: Recitation of the Shema in the Teaching of R. Shimon Bar Yohai," Sidra 20 (2005); 25-56 [Hebrew], 251 For example, Hirshman, The Stabilization of Rabbinic Culture, 30, writes: "For at least some of the Jewish sages, the words ofTorah were essentially divine. God s words were part and parcel of God's essence... The goal of the sage is to attach one s self and to cleave to these divine words, the Torah."</page><page sequence="12">542 £ S. Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 broader trends within rabbinic Judaism generally, trends that have been hitherto ignored. 3. Recognizing the Unity of God and the Command to Love God The doctrinal prologue to the first paragraph of the Shema (Deut 6:4-5) calls on Israel to recognize the unity of God and commands Israel to love God. When Second Temple sources invoke these verses, they connect them with Sinaitic revelation and the Decalogue. In what follows, I will argue that this pattern of citing, alluding to or paraphrasing the Shema verses follows from the status of these verses as a pseudo-commandment and the fact that repeating them recalled the original sealing of the covenant at Sinai when the Ten Commandments were first articulated. Second Temple sources do not appear to respond to the instructions to "speak of [these words] when you lie down and when you rise up"—or at least, they don't invoke the instruction verses—when citing, alluding to or paraphrasing the doctrinal prologue. One important context in which these verses were invoked was rituals that re-enact the covenantal dedication of Israel to YHWH at Sinai. Dur ing the Second Temple period, the event of Sinaitic revelation was increas ingly seen not as a one-time event in the past, but as an event that was to be ritually re-performed on a regular basis to affirm the on-going character of the covenantal relationship that it created.26 Several scholars argue that Pss 81 and 50 were written against the backdrop of a covenantal re-enactment ceremony which took place on either Shavuot (the holiday which com memorates the giving of the law at Sinai)27 or Rosh Hashanah (the holiday of the New Year).28 A central feature of the ceremony of covenantal re enactment was affirming the importance of the Decalogue, which was understood to be the central content of the Sinaitic revelation.

Psalm 81 invokes the first two commandments in its recalling of the Sinaitic event: "You shall have no foreign god, you shall not bow to an alien god. I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of the Egypt" (Ps 82:10-11). In a more condensed form, Ps 50 alludes to only the first commandment:29 "I am God, your God" (Ps 50:7). In addition to recalling the revelation at Sinai, these two psalms also call Israel by name, asking her to "hear" (shema)(shema) or obey God: "Hear, My people and I will admonish you; Ο Israel, if you would but listen to Me!" (Ps 81:9) and "Hear, My people and I will speak, Ο Israel, and I will arraign you" (Ps 50: 7). These verses from Pss 81 and 50 do not employ the same syntactical structure that the first para graph of the Shema does ("Hear, Ο Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord alone"), but they do reflect a common tradition in that they use the verb "hear" (shema) to call Israel to show loyalty to God alone.30 Though not quoting the Shema verses in tandem with the first two commandments, they attest to a tradition that associated the first two verses of the Shema with the first one or two commandments in the Decalogue. The community at Qumran had an elaborate initiation process that members had to undergo in order to formalize their membership in the sectarian community. Like the ceremonies re-enacting the covenant, for mal entrance into the sectarian community was a ritual way to affirm the endurance of the God's covenantal act at Sinai. The sectarians thought they alone remained God's covenantal partners. Two different documents from Qumran (both ca. 100 B.C.E.) suggest that the sectarians understood the dedication symbolized by their entry into the sect through the language of the second verse of doctrinal prologue to the first paragraph of the Shema (Deut 6:5: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might.").31 Weinfeld argues that the sectarians understood the first clause in this tripartite dedication ("love God with all your heart) to require commitment of one's mind to God. The second clause ("with all your soul") required dedication of one's power or strength and the third clause ("with all your might") required dedication of one's 2,1 For a precise definition of biblical allusion and other strategies of invoking earlier scrip tural texts see Benjamin D.

Alexander / Journal for the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 531-579 wealth or possessions.'2 Echoing the tripartite structure of Deut 6:5, a pas sage in the Rule of the Community reads, "All those who freely devote them selves to His truth shall bring all their knowledge, " powers and possessions into the Community of God" (1QS 1:12). Those who enter the sectarian covenantal community are understood to be fulfilling the requirements of Deut 6:5· Weinfeld observes similar demands made on the entrant to the sect in the Damascus Document (CD 13:11). There the new member is examined with respect to (1) "his works and intelligence" (to affirm that he dedicates himself with "all [his] heart"); (2) "his strength and power" (to affirm that he dedicates himself with "all [his] soul");34 and (3) "his wealth" (to affirm that he dedicates himself with "all [his] might").35 In both of these documents (Rule of the Community and Damascus Document), entrance into the sectarian community involves a tripartite dedication similar to that demanded by the Shema verses. Qumran documents, then, suggest that the second verse of the first paragraph of the Shema was linked to contemporary affirmations of the covenantal relationship. Whether linking Deut 6:4-5 to the first two commandments of the Decalogue or to entrance into the sectarian community, Second Temple Jews were seeing these two Shema verses as reflecting the occasion of covenantal re-enactment. Like the passage in the Rule of the Community, Ben Sira (ca. 180 B.C.E.) draws on the language of Deut 6:5 to describe what it means to dedicate oneself to God. For Ben Sira dedication to God does not find its fullest expression in joining the sectarian community, but in giving appropriate honor to God's agents in one's midst. Sirach 7 renders the biblical com mand to love God in three different ways as follows: (27) With all your heart honor your father, And the mother who bore you, do not forger. (28) Remember that from them you came into being; How can you repay them according to what they have done for you? ,י־ One of the requirements of entry into the sect's communal life involved renunciation of personal property to the sect. The rabbis similarly understand the clause requiring love of God "with all your might'' as indicating a dedication of one's wealth. See discussion in Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11, 339. ·'·" ·'·" Weinfeld documents an ancient Jewish interpretation of "heart" as "mind." .See Wein feld, Deuteronomy 1-11, 338. w In its paraphrase of Deut 6:5, Mark 12:30 also adds a fourth element to the biblical triplet demanding dedication of heart, soul and might.

(30) With all your might, love your maker, Do not leave his ministers without support.36 According to Ben Sira, each of the three biblical phrases—׳"love God with all (1) your heart; (2) soul; and (3) might"—compels dedication to a dif ferent one of Gods representatives or agents on earth. The first phrase requires love for one's parents, the second respect for God's priests and the third attention to God's servants.37 For Ben Sira, loving God according to the three-fold formula of Deut 6:5 means acting appropriately to God's earthly representatives. It is interesting to note that Ben Sira connects Deut 6:5 with the Decalogue in that he refers to the obligation to honor one's father and mother. But he also connects Deut 6:5 with other obliga tions not mentioned in the Decalogue (treating priests as sacred, providing God's ministers with support). Though Ben Sira does not connect Deut 6:5 with the event of Sinaitic revelation, he does connect the verse with one of the commandments in the Decalogue. His testimony enriches our picture of the manifold ways in which Jews of the Second Temple period were linking Deut 6:4-5 with the Decalogue and thinking about these verses as a commandment. The synoptic gospels (ca. 65-90 C.E.) provide additional evidence that Second Temple Jews regarded Deut 6:4-5 as a commandment. Mark 12 relates the following encounter between Jesus and a scribe: (28) One of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, he asked them, "Which command ment is the first of all?" (29) Jesus answered, "The first is: Hear ο Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One; (30) and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength. (31) The second is this: You must love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these."3" (see also parallels in Matt 22:34-40 and Luke 10:25-28) 3,'י Translation of this phrase is drawn from Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11, 339. 371 Weinfeld understands this phrase to require financial support of God's ministers. See ibid. 31,1 Translation from NRSV.</page><page sequence="16">546 £. S. Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 In Mark (and Matthew), Deut 6:4-5 is explicitly described as a command ment, indeed the greatest of all commandments. It is especially interesting to note that Mark reads Deut 6:4-5 as a commandment without linking these verses to the Decalogue. Instead, the New Testament connects Deut 6:4-5 with Lev 19:18, the commandment to love one's neighbor as oneself.39 Mark's connecting the command to love God with the command to love one's neighbor echoes Ben Sira, who likewise believes that the com mand to love God is best accomplished by loving God's human representa tives on earth and alludes to commandments beyond those included in the Decalogue. Whereas Ben Sira suggests that God's presence is most imme diately manifest in particular segments of the human community (parents, priests and God's servants), Mark emphasizes that God is manifest in the entire human community (your neighbor). In both sources, love of God is linked to love of members of the human community.40 The synoptic gos pels, then, provide additional evidence that Jews in the Second Temple period read Deut 6:4-5 as a commandment. In sum, the view that Deut 6:4-5 should be understood through the conceptual rubric of "commandment" was expressed in a variety of ways. Deut 6:4-5 was linked (1) with ceremonies of covenantal re-enactment which featured the first two commandments; (2) with the commandment to honor one's parents; and (3) with the commandment to love one's neighbor as oneself. Though each of the sources discussed connects Deut 6:4-5 with commandments, each establishes this interpretative claim by different means. While Pss 81 and 51 and the Qumran documents link Deut 6:4-5 with Sinaitic revelation by invoking these verses in the context of covenantal re-enactment, Ben Sira and the synoptic gospels associate Deut 6:4-5 with specific commandments, some of which are not even included in the Decalogue. While the synoptic gospels explicitly describe Deut 6:4-5 as a commandment, the other sources relate Deut 6:4-5 to the Decalogue by association, either by alluding to Sinaitic revelation as an event (as in Pss 50 and 81) or by citing specific commandments (like honor M See also Luke 10:25-28 where a similar incident is related in abbreviated form. In Luke, Deut 6:4-5 is not described as a commandment. The question posed to Jesus is: "What is written in the Law?" The command to love God (Deut 6:5) and the command to love one's neighbor (Lev 19:18) are represented as the essence of the "law" (nomos). 4"' A passage by Paul, 1 Cor 8:6, is often taken to reflect early Christian interpretation of the command to love God.

Thiselton, The First Epistle to the Corinthians:Corinthians: A Commentary on the Greek Text (N1GTC; Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 2000), 636-37.</page><page sequence="17">Ε. S. Alexander / Journal for the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 531-579 547 your mother and father, as in Ben Sira). What each of these sources has in common is the linking of Deut 6:4-5 with the Sinaitic revelation and the Decalogue as a symbol of Israels covenantal commitment to God at Sinai. It is important to recognize that this trend of engaging the doctrinal pro logue to the first paragraph of the Shema occurs without reference to the later verses in the first paragraph which the rabbis understood to require recitation of the Shema verses as liturgy. The doctrinal prologue appears to have received attention on the basis of its status as pseudo-commandment that recalled Sinaitic revelation, and not because verses later in the para graph called for its recitation. 4. Rabbinic Corroboration for Trend #1 The endurance of this conceptual framing of Deut 6:4-5 is attested in sev eral tannaitic sources (ca. 200-300 C.E.). When explaining the order of the Shema's three paragraphs, Sipre Num. 115 and m. Ber. 2:2 have occa sion to reflect on the essential message of the first paragraph. Both sources assume that the first paragraph (with its doctrinal prologue) articulates an individual's "acceptance of the yoke of the kingship of heaven." In the view of these sources, reciting the first paragraph of the Shema signals one's acceptance of God's claim to covenantal loyalty. Like a number of the Sec ondond Temple sources discussed above, the tannaitic sources identify the sig nificance of the first two verses of the first paragraph in their affirmation of Israel's commitment to God within the context of the covenant. Sipre Num.Num. 115 additionally points outs that the first paragraph expresses one's refutation of the worship of other gods (vemi'et bah avodah zarah·, lit. "it excludes [the possibility of] alien worship"), thereby establishing a connec tion between the first two verses of the Shema and the second command ment. Here we hear echoes of Ps 81:9-11 which also attests to a traditional linkage between the first two verses of the Shema and the second com mandment not to worship other gods.41 Μ.M. Tamid offers another example of a tannaitic text that links the Shema with the Decalogue. The passage, m. Tamid 4:3-5:1 describes the daily order of morning sacrificial rites and includes a reference to the priestly practice of reciting the Shema. 40 Kimelman notes the similarities between Sipre Num. 115 and Ps 81:9-11. See Reuven Kimelman, "The Shema and the Amidah: Rabbinic Prayer," in Prayer from Alexander to Corutantine (ed. Mark Kiley; London: Routledge, 1997), 108-20 at 110 and 118, n. 10.</page><page sequence="18">548 Ε. S.

Then they went down to the Chamber of Hewn Stone to recite the Shema. (3:1) The officer said to them: Recite (barkhu) the blessing! They blessed [accordingly] and they recited the Ten Commandments, the "shema" [the first paragraph], the "vehayah im shamoa" [the second paragraph], and the "veyomer""veyomer" [the third paragraph]. This mishnaic tradition describes a priestly liturgical practice of reciting the three paragraphs of the rabbinic Shema preceded by the Decalogue shortly after dawn. Historians debate the extent to which this tradition accurately reflects liturgical practices during the Second Temple period, whether among the priests or laity.42 Did the priests and/or Israelite laity recite these four biblical passages in this order as part of a regular daily liturgy? Several factors militate against accepting the evidence of the Mish nah at face value. First, the Mishnah assigns a name to the liturgical unit that makes sense to a rabbinic audience, but would not have made sense to Second Temple practitioners of the described practice. The mishnah says "they went down... to recite the Shema," but as Joseph Tabory notes that it is not logical for a liturgical practice that has the Decalogue as its first element to be named according to the first word of its second paragraph.4 ' It is more likely that the Mishnah anachronistically describes what it imag ines to have been Second Temple practice in light of the contemporary rabbinic ritual practice.44 Second, scholars have noted that while other 421 Tabory, "Prayers and Berakhot," 290-92, is skeptical about many aspects of this source. Kimelman, "From Covenant to Coronation," 68-80, 84-91, is inclined to accept the account as historically reliable and uses the source to demonstrate differences between the Shema ritual in its Second Temple and rabbinic manifestations. Baumgarten, "Invented Traditions," 203, compares this passage with a description ofTemple practices in Sir 50:1 21 (which make no reference to the Shema) and concludes that the Shema was not recited in in the Temple as late as 170 B.C.F.. He argues that the Shema was introduced into the Temple rites during the Maccabean era. י" See Tabory, "Prayers and Berakhot," 290. 441441 A number of recent studies suggest that tannaitic descriptions ofTemple ritual are often generated by the imagination in the rabbinic study house, rather than by accurate historical memory regarding Second Temple practice.

Tamid 5:1.46 There are several reasons, then, to be skeptical about the accuracy of the Mish nah's ascription of a liturgical practice very similar to its own to the Second Temple period. Whether or not we accept the picture of Second Temple liturgical practice depicted by m. Tamid, however, is immaterial for the argument here. These mishnayot, like a number of the Second Temple sources discussed above, attest to a tradition of linking the Shema verses with the Decalogue. 5. The Qurnran Tefillin and the Nash Papyrus A number of tefillin slips and casings were found at Qumran and they provide some of our earliest evidence for the fact that Jews in antiquity understood verses from the Shema (Deut 6:8, 11:18 "And you shall bind [these words] as a sign upon your hand, and as frontlets between your eyes") as requiring the binding of encased textual inscriptions onto the body.47 Though later rabbinic practice requires binding four discrete para graphs48 containing reference to tefillin practice, the tefillin slips found at This body of research may be less relevant to the current case because m. Tumid is conven tionally assumed to constitute a relatively old stratum of the Mishnah. In any event, for the purposes of the current argument, I need not resolve the question of the accuracy of this tradition. 451 See Tabory, "Prayers and Berakhot," 290-92. 461 See ibid., 292. For the view that the third paragraph of the Shema was added to the liturgical cycle after the first two paragraphs were already fixed as a liturgical unit, see Elbo gen, Jewish Liturgy,gen, Jewish Liturgy, 23 and Cohen, Philo Judacus, 108, 167-76. 471 The bulk of tefillin slips and casings were published by Milik and Yadin. See J. T. Milik, "Tefillin, Mezuzot et Targums," in Discoveries in the Judaean Desert, Vol. 6 (Oxford: Claren don, 1977), 33-85; Yigael Yadin, Tefillin from Qumran (XQPhyl 1-4) (Jerusalem: The Israel Exploration Society, 1970).

For the moment, I wish merely to observe that a number of the sets of tefillin slips that were assumed to originate in a single tefillin contain both the Decalogue and the Shema verses. To take just one example, 4QPhyl G, Η and I are identified as coming from a single set of slips and they include the entire chapter of Deut 5 (which contains the Decalogue) along with the Shema verses from Deut 6 and Deut ll.50 The Qumran tefillin, then, provide additional evidence that Second Temple Jews linked the Shema verses with the Decalogue. It is also interesting to observe that four of the Qumran tefillin which include the Decalogue stop short of citing the full paragraph of the She ma." They either cite Deut 5 (which includes the Decalogue) and con tinue in Deut 6 up to verse 3, the verse immediately preceding the first (13:9 alludes to tefillin practice), Exod 13:11-16 (13:16 alludes to tefillin practice), Deut 6:4-9 (6:8 alludes to tefillin practice) and Deut 11:13-21 (11:18 alludes to tefillin practice). The last two paragraphs correspond to the first two paragraphs of the rabbinic Shema. Rab binic practice dictates that the four passages be written on a single parchment and placed in a single cell in the arm-tefillin. The same passages are written on four separate parch ments and placed in four separate cells in the head-tefillin. יי"יי"wl Milik, "Tefillin, Mezuzot et Targums," 34-37, was the first to establish that 4QPhyl Ν (which contains Deut 32) was a tefillin slip. Contra Milik, Nakman, "The Contents and Order," 35-37, argues that 4QPhyl Ν was not a tefillin slip. Cohn, Tangled up in Text, 67, 76, argues that 4QDeut\ 4QDeutkl and 4QDeut" were probably tefillin slips also based on the visibility of folds and the small size of the parchment and handwriting on these frag ments.

In both cases, it is notable that the tefillin link the Shema verses with the Decalogue without direct recourse to the instruction verses. This evidence corroborates the trend noted above that the link between the Decalogue and the Shema verses was established with the doctrinal prologue of the first paragraph of the Shema, rather than with the instruction verses. The evidence of the Qumran tefillin complicate the matter somewhat, however, since many of them do include the verses of ritual instruction. The Nash Papyrus (ca. 165-100 B.C.E.)52 was found in Egypt about 50 years before the Qumran tefillin were found. Like some of the Qumran tefillin slips, the Nash Papyrus contains the Decalogue and the doctrinal prologue from the first paragraph of the Shema. In addition, the Nash Papyrus adds a short introduction to the Shema verses (also found in the Septuagint) between the Decalogue and the Shema verses. Like the Qum ran tefillin slips, the Nash Papyrus was folded a number of times. Initially scholars assumed the Nash Papyrus was a text that had been used in a liturgical setting.53 The discovery of the Qumran tefillin slips with similar folds found in tefillin casings led scholars to reconsider how the Nash Papyrus was used. Scholars now believe that the Nash Papyrus was used in a manner similar to the tefillin slips found at Qumran: as a slip in tefillin.54 What is particularly interesting for the purposes of this research project is that only the first two verses of the first paragraph of the Shema (Deut 6:4-5) are included in the Nash Papyrus. This feature of the Nash Papyrus pro vides one more piece of evidence that the first paragraph of the Shema attracted attention in the Second Temple period because of a link that was perceived between the Deut 6:4-5 and the Decalogue. As in the Second Temple sources cited above, the latter verses of the first paragraph of the Shema (i.e. the instruction verses) do not figure in this associative forma tion.55 The Decalogue's link to the Shema verses arises when one focuses specifically on the doctrinal prologue to the first paragraph. 521 For this dating, see W. F. Albright, "A Biblical Fragment from the Maccabaean Age: The Nash Papyrus," JBL 56 (1937): 145-76, esp. 149. 531 See Moshe Greenberg, "Nash Papyrus," in Encjud 12:833. 541 See Baumgarten, "Invented Traditions," 206-7, n. 38; Cohn, Tangled up in Text, 67-68; Colette Sirat, Lespapyrus en caracteres hebra'iques trouves en Egypte (Paris: Centre national de la recherche scientifique, 1985), 29, n. 30; Ezra Fleischer, Eretz-Israel Prayers and Prayer Rituals Rituals as Portrayed in the Geniza Documents (Jerusalem, 1988), 259, η. 1 [Hebrew]. 551 It is notable that four of the Qumran tefillin slips follow the pattern of the Nash Papyrus</page><page sequence="22">552 Ε.

Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 The Nash Papyrus and the Qumran tefillin, then, additionally attest to a perceived connection between the Decalogue and the doctrinal prologue of the first paragraph of the Shema. 6. A Cluster of Concrete Ritual Acts A second set of Second Temple sources suggest that the Shema verses were simultaneously attracting attention for an altogether different reason. A number of sources cite, allude to or paraphrase the Shema verses that pre scribe concrete ritual acts. Notably, these sources do not invoke the doctri nal prologue. This fact suggests that the rituals were understood to function in a manner other than as an affirmation of the doctrinal prologue to the first paragraph. I will argue that this second set of Second Temple sources reveals that the Shema verses were attracting attention because they were seen as the source for a group of concrete ritual acts which expressed com mitment to various fundamental principles. The rabbis eventually derived six distinct rituals from the Shema verses: (1) Tefillin of the arm fulfills the instruction to "bind them as a sign upon your hand" (Deut 6:8, 11:18); (2) tefillin of the head fulfills the instruc tion to "have them as a frontlet between your eyes" (Deut 6:8, 11:18); (3) mezuzah fulfills the instruction to "inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates" (Deut 6:9, 11:19); (4) diurnal prayer con sisting of recitation of the Shema verses fulfills the instruction to "impress them upon your children, speaking of them... when you lie down and when you get up" (Deut 6:7; 11:19);56 (5) Torah study fulfills the instruction in this regard. They do include Deut 5 (which includes the Decalogue), but do not include the verses from Deut 6 that were later assumed to provide the ritual instructions for tefillin.

Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 553 to "impress them upon your children" (Deut 6:7, 11:19); and (6) tzitzit fulfills the instruction to "make fringes for themselves on the corners of their garments" (Num 15:38). It is clear from Second Temple sources that these rituals were attracting attention and were connected with each other, though no Second Temple source attends to all of these rituals in a single discussion. What is less clear, however, is whether the conceptual clustering of these rituals resulted from an encounter with text of the Shema in liturgical form. It is also not clear that the rituals were understood to be a means of affirming the content of the doctrinal prologues. The available evidence suggests that a variety of conceptual conceptual principles governed how Second Temple Jews thought about the Shema rituals as a collectivity. 7· The Shema Rituals as Embodied Performance of Jewish Commitments The Letter of Aristeas (ca. 170 B.C.E.) discusses the Shema rituals as part of an allegorical interpretation of the dietary laws. According to Aristeas, Jews are allowed to eat ruminants because they serve as a paradigm for recollec don {Let. Aris. 154). Ruminants naturally bring back up what has already been consumed and Jews too are "exhorted through scripture to... 'remem ber the Lord who did great and wonderful deeds through you" (155).57 The dietary laws are one ritual means of recollection. The body, however, has multiple points of sensory input (156) and therefore God "has ordained" a variety of rituals that can serve in "every time and place for a continual reminder of the supreme God and upholder [of all]" (157). (veshinantam).(veshinantam). The verb shinnen here is not understood as an action directed towards one's children. Rather, it is an action one performs with one's own self-transformation as the telos. This interpretation of "you shall teach them diligently" (veshinantam), however, has the obvious difficulty of requiring that one ignore the verb's direct object. In its native literary context, the verb is directed towards children/sons (banekha). Maimonides resolves this exegetical difficulty by rooting the obligation to say Shema in a different phrase: "speaking of them" (vedibarta bam). See Moses Maimonides, Sefer Ha-Mitsvot (trans. Joseph Kapach; Jerusalem, 1930-31), 64-65. See discussion in Benovitz, "Shinun: Recitation of the Shema," 25-28 [Hebrew]. 571 According to Hadas, the scriptural reference here is to a combination of LXX Deut 7:17 and 10:21. The term "through you" refers to the human body. See Moses Hadas, ed. and trans., Aristeas to Philocrates (Letter of Aristeas) (New York: Ktav, 1973), 161.</page><page sequence="24">554 Ε. S.

Accordingly, in the matter of meats and drinks, He commands men to offer first fruits and to consume them there and then, straightaway. 158b. Furthermore, in our clothes He has given us a distinguishing mark as a reminder (= reference to tzitzit), 158c. and similarly on our gates and doors he has commanded us to set up the "words," so as to be a reminder of God (= reference to mezuzah). 159. He also strictly commands that the sign shall be worn on our hands, clearly indicating that it is our duty to fulfill every activity with justice, having in mind our own condition, and above all the fear of God (= reference to hand/arm tefillin). 160. He also commands that "on going to bed and rising" men should medi tate on the devisings of God, observing not only in word but in understand ing the movement and impression which they have when they go to sleep, and waking too, what a divine change there is between them—quite beyond understanding (= reference to diurnal prayer/meditation on God's devisings).5" Aristeas discusses the Shema rituals insofar as they are types of reminders, which he has been brought to consider through his discussion of the dietary laws. First, it is important to note that the Shema rituals are not conceived as a discrete unit unto themselves. The laws of first fruits (158) are part of the conceptual unit into which the Shema rituals are introduced. They too are regarded as a ritual means of recollection that engages the diverse senses "in every time and every place." Second, Aristeas' discussion is generated by a concern for the rituals as diverse types of reminders. He mentions tzitzit first among the Shema rituals (158b), even though they appear in the third paragraph of the Shema, presumably because the biblical text explicitly states that they function as vehicle of recollection.59 Aristeas next discusses the ritual of mezuzah (158c), even though it is the last of the rituals mentioned in the first and second paragraphs of the Shema. It too can easily be assimilated into the conceptual rubric of reminders. Finally, Aristeas discusses the other rituals that—in his view—less obviously serve י"' Translation (with minor alteration) from R. J. H. Shutt, "Letter of Aristeas," in OTP 2:7-34 at 23. יי" See Num 15:39 from the third paragraph of the Shema: "That shall be your fringe; look at it and recall all the commandments of the Lord and observe them, so that you do not follow your heart and eyes in your lustful urge" (emphasis added).</page><page sequence="25">Ε. S. Alexander /Journalfor the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 555 as reminders [tefillin (159) and diurnal prayer/meditation (160)]. We see Aristeas' hesitation about characterizing them as reminders in that he men tions other functions of these last rituals before noting that they serve as reminders of God. Aristeas does not mention tefillin worn on the head when he discusses the arm/hand tefillin in 159. Perhaps he knew only of the ritual of wearing tefillin on the arm/hand? Perhaps the head tefillin ritual with which he was familiar could not be easily amalgamated in the rubric of reminders? What ever the reason, it is an interesting fact that Aristeas does not discuss all the rituals that the rabbis eventually derived from the Shema verses. The verses which the rabbis read as dictating the recitation of the Shema are read by Aristeas as requiring one to "meditate on the devisings of God." Though this meditation is presumably done twice daily ["upon going to bed and rising" (160)], there is no clear indication that the con tent of this meditation is a liturgical text consisting of the Shema verses. Rather the subject of meditation is "the devisings of God" and the miracu lous transition effected when one moves from sleep to wakefulness and vice versa.60 Aristeas also does not exhibit a uniform understanding of the term "these words" by which the rituals are fulfilled. According to the biblical instructions (Deut 6:7-9), one is to recite the same "words" that one attaches to the doorpost and binds to one's arm/hand. In Aristeas, one mediates on "the devisings of God"61 (τάς του θεοΰ κατασκευάς) and the miracle of moving from sleep to wakefulness and vice versa. By way of contrast, the ritual of mezuzah is fulfilled by means of the ambiguous "these words" (τά λόγια), which also appears to be the case with tefillin. In the case of hand tefillin, the reminder works in an interesting way. Since 6"י Aristeas' manner of understanding the ritual reflects a particular interpretation of the verse which states "you shall teach them to your children, speaking of them... when you lie down and when you rise up." Aristeas assumes that the time at which the ritual is to be performed ("when you lie down and when you rise up") indicates something about the content content and purpose of the ritual (it involves meditation on the transition from sleep to wak ing and vice versa). A similar interpretive move is reflected in the first blessing which the rabbis add to the Shema liturgical cycle. In the morning one praises God for bringing light into the world and in the evening one praises God for bringing darkness. Here too one reflects on the miracles that are wrought at the time of sleeping and waking. See Kimelman, "From Covenant to Coronation," 29-40, where he discusses the morning and evening blessings that precede the Shema in the rabbinic liturgy.

Alexander / Journal for the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 531-579 the hand is an instrument for affecting justice (159), we must mark the hand with a sign to use it well. Tefillin are a sort of ritual mnemonic that prompts us to use the hands appropriately.62 The only consistency behind the different rituals is that each aims to instill consciousness of God in the practitioner. Aristeas clearly sees connections amongst the Shema rituals and thinks of them as a unit to be discussed in a single context, even though not all function obviously as reminders. What is less clear is whether the connec tion is generated for him by a familiarity with the Shema verses as a liturgi cal text. My sense is that the trope of embodied ritual as a means of remembering God plays a stronger role in shaping Aristeas' discussion of the rituals than does a daily encounter with a liturgical text consisting of the Shema verses. First, when discussing embodied ritual Aristeas cer tainly focuses on the Shema-derived rituals, but not to the exclusion of other rituals. He refers to the laws of first fruits (158a) alongside the Shema-derived rituals in his allegorical treatment of the dietary laws. Sec ond, he treats the rituals in an order that ignores their layout in the (even tual) liturgical text. Third, Aristeas' interpretation of Deut 6:7-9 does not imply a consistent reading of "these words," which one would expect to result from the intimate familiarity engendered by repeated repetition of the Shema verses as a discrete textual unit. Finally, to the extent that Aristeas does know of a ritual way to enact the instructions "to recite [these words]... when you lie down and when you rise up," he assumes this phrase to require meditation on "God's devisings" and the miracle of the transition from sleep to wakefulness. Aristeas certainly recognizes that the rituals have roots in scripture.6■' Aristeas' encounter with the biblical verses, however, is not filtered through an experience of them as a liturgical unit. Central to my argument is the recognition that the decision to excerpt a passage of biblical text to be performed as liturgy both rests upon and engenders new ways of interacting with the biblical text. Aristeas' discus sion of the Shema rituals, while acknowledging their rootedness in scrip ture, does not respond to aspects of the text that are highlighted once the verses are regarded as a liturgical unit. 621 Philo also attests an interpretation in which the hand/arm tefillin calls the wearer to use the hands for the purpose of executing justice (Spec. Laws 4:138). W) Hadas notes that the use of ή γραφή in 155 to indicate biblical scripture may be the earliest attested usage with this sense. See Hadas, Aristeas to Philocrates (Letter ofAristeas), 161.</page><page sequence="27">Ε. S. Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 557 The synoptic gospels (ca. 70-90) provide additional evidence that the Shema-derived rituals were conceptually clustered together and perceived as a means of marking one's body with one's Jewish commitments. Whereas for for Aristeas one marks one body to initiate an internal process (remember ing), Matthew suggests that the Shema-derived rituals mark the body for on-lookers. In remarking on how the Pharisees stand out from other Jews, Matthew calls attention to their tefillin and tzitzit: "They do all their deeds to be seen by others; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long." (Matt 23:5). Here tefillin and tzitzit serve as reminders not for the person wearing them, but for the on-looker in the public arena. The Shema rituals mark one's Jewish commitments, in this case a specific brand of Jewish commitments (i.e. the Pharisaic kind), by reminding others of the degree of the wearers piety.64 We find further corroboration for the idea that these rituals were linked to each other because of how they marked the body with one's Jewish com mitments in early rabbinic texts. Sipre Deut. 36 (ca. 250-300 C.E.) dis cusses the Shema rituals in its final comment on the last phrase of the first paragraph of the Shema. 1. 1. Precious is Israel [to God], for Scripture (hakatuv) surrounded them with commandments: Tefillin on their heads, tefillin on their arms, mezuzah on their doors, tzitzit on their clothes. About them David said, "Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous ordinances" (Ps 119:164). 2. He went into the bathhouse, and saw himself naked, and said "Woe to me that I am naked of the commandments." Then he looked at his circumci sion and began to sing praises for it, "For the leader, on the eighth [day], a Psalm of David" (Ps 21:1). As in Aristeas and Matthew, the Shema-derived rituals are clustered together because they play a central role in marking the body of the (male) Jew. In the Sipre, an anthropomorphic "Scripture"65 physically surrounds 641 Justin Martyr, in his Dialogue with Trypho, also refers to tzitzit and tefillin as distinctive practices that visibly mark the wearer. See A. Lukyn Williams, trans., Justin Martyr, the Dialogue Dialogue with Trypho (New York: Macmillan, 1930), 46:5· f'5) Azzan Yadin observes that Hakatuv (as opposed to Torah) functions as an active agent in directing the reader towards interpretation. Though the use of hakatuv here does not fea ture scripture directing interpretation, scripture does function as an active agent as in Yadin's description. See Azzan Yadin, Scripture as Logos: Rabbi Ishmael and the Origins of Midrash, Divinations (Philadelphia, Pa.: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004), 11-33.</page><page sequence="28">558 Ε. S. Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 and encompasses the body in rituals that have a spatial component. Tefillin are on the head and hands, mezuzah enfolds them when they sit in their homes and tzitzit grace their garments. Perhaps because Sipre Deuteronomy is considering the rituals in their physical aspect, no mention is made of the intellectual and verbal Shema rituals (recitation of Shema and Torah study). Notably, here the rituals are discussed in the order in which they appear in the liturgical text (with the slight exception that the head and hand tefillin are mentioned in reverse order). This fact may indicate that the rabbis do encounter the rituals in the liturgical text of the Shema verses. Finally, it is interesting to observe that, as in the Letter of Aristeas, we find mention of an additional ritual beyond those derived from the Shema. Aristeas mentions first fruits because it can be practiced in "all places and times." Sipre Deuteronomy mentions circumcision because it marks the body in the most private ways, even when the body is deprived of all other signs of socialization and protection. Collectively, these sources (Letter of Aristeas,Aristeas, Matthew and Sipre Deuteronomy) suggest a second reason why the Shema verses were attracting attention during the Second Temple period. Though the doctrinal prologue of the first paragraph drew notice because of its status as a pseudo-commandment, the verses of ritual instruction generated interest because they prescribe a cluster of ritual actions that were understood to express and perform Jewish commitments in and on the body. 8. Philo: "These Words" Equals "Justice" In On the Special Laws, Philo (d. 50 C.E.) also engages the Shema verses of ritual instruction because they testify to a central corpus of ritual acts. Philo treats the Shema verses in his discussion of justice in accordance with his belief that the rituals steer the mind and body towards just behavior. Philo's discussion follows the biblical text closely, as he provides a para phrastic rendering of each phrase in the second paragraph of the Shema.66 In order to highlight the interpretive aspect of Philo's discussion, I present the biblical text alongside Philo's rendering of it. I cite selectively from Philo, as he comments on the verses at great length. "יי Naomi Cohen likewise observes that Philo comments on the second, not the first, para graph of the Shema.

See discussion in Cohen, Philo Judaeus, 145-46; Cohn, Tangled up in Text, 84. Much scholarly discussion of Philos interpretation of the LXX here revolves around the question of whether Philo was describing a concrete practice of wearing tefillin, albeit one which differs greatly from the rabbinic practice. This question will not detain us here. 9יז) Most LXX manuscripts translate totafot in Exod 13:16, Deut 6:8 and 11:18 as "unmov ing" or "immovable" (άσάλευτον). Some LXX manuscripts have "moving" (σάλευτον), which appears to be the version upon which Philo comments. See discussion of this issue in Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11, 333-35, 341; Cohen, Philo Judaeus, 144-47; Cohn, Tan gledgled up in Text, 79-80.

The rabbis are emphatic in their understanding of the term in both paragraphs of the Shema as indicating "sons, and not daughters." Sipre Deut. 46 offers a gender specific interpretation of the term benekhembenekhem as "sons, and not daughters." M. Ber. 3:3, which states that women do not recite the Shema, offers an implicit interpretation of banekha in Deut 6:7 as indicating "sons and not daughters. The fact that LXX does not translate the term consistently suggests that it was not familiar with a liturgical text of the Shema consisting of both of these paragraphs.

Alexander /Journalfor the Study of fudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 561 Unlike the sources discussed thus far, Philo's discussion of the Shema derived rituals is generated by direct engagement with the biblical text. We see this in the fact that he treats the rituals in the exact order in which they appear in the biblical text. He even offers an explicit interpretation of the "transitional verse" which introduces the term "these words" (Deut 11:18a), even though it prescribes no concrete ritual. In 137 Philo paraphrastically renders the "transitional verse" as "The law tells us we must set the rules of justice justice in the heart." Here he introduces the interpretation that he will pursue consistently throughout the passage: The "words" or "things" that are subject to various rituals are the rules of justice (τά δίκαια).72 Philo explains that "the law bids us fasten the rules of justice" to the hand (138) by way of accounting for what it means to "bind these words upon your arm." In reference to the head tefillin in which "these words" are placed between the eyes, Philo states "always and everywhere we must have a vision of them [the principles of justice] as it were close to the eyes" (139). At 141, the initiate is to instruct others in the "rules of justice," that they may be "gladdened by visions of the just. For there is no sweeter delight than that the soul be charged through and through with justice." And in 142, Philo implicitly suggests that the mezuzah too aims to inculcate hab its of just behavior by keeping in "perpetual memory what they should say and do." Unlike Aristeas, Philo offers a uniform reading of "the words" employed in the various rituals in the instruction verses.73 It will be recalled that Aristeas notes a connection between tefillin of the arm and the arm as an agent of justice. It is not surprising that Philo, com ing from the same Alexandrian milieu, should know of the same tradition. What is noteworthy, however, is that Philo takes a trope (justice) that was associated with just one of the many Shema-related rituals (arm/hand tefil lin), and assumes it offers the key to understanding all the rituals. As a reader of the biblical text, Philo feels the need to render the passage in a coherent manner and he reads each and every appearance of "these words" as a reference to justice. As can be seen from the order in which Philo treats the different rituals, Philo's discussion focuses on the second, rather than the first, paragraph of 721 Naomi Cohen offers an extended discussion of semantic range of the term "justice" (δικαιοσύνη) and its meaning in Philo's Jewish-Greek specifically. See Cohen, Philo Judaeus,Judaeus, 106-28. She argues the term refers to observance ofTorah commandments, both ritual and ethical. The term refers to commandments between man and man and is often paired with ευσέβεια, which indicates commandments between man and God (128). 731 See discussion above, where I note Aristeas' inconsistent reading of "these words."</page><page sequence="32">562 £. S. Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 the Shema.74 This fact is of interest because it demonstrates that the doc trinal prologue to first paragraph was not responsible for the attention that the verses of ritual instruction received from Philo. The verses of ritual instruction generated interest because of the rituals in and of themselves, and not because they were appended to the doctrinal prologue of the first paragraph. Evidence already reviewed from the Letter of Aristeas, Matthew and Sipre Deuteronomy suggests that the rituals were attracting attention because they were an embodied means of performing Jewish commit ments. For Philo, the rituals embody one's commitments to justice. Finally, it is important to observe that Philo does not seem to know of a Shema-derived requirement to pray twice daily. Philo reads the latter part of the phrase "teach them to your children, reciting them when you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you get up" as an idiomatic expression which means at all times and in all places. By way of contrast, the rabbis understand the adverbial clause "when you lie down and when you get up" as indicating specific times when or specific positions in which recitation should be performed. Though the rabbis later understand the verb "speak" to mean "recite as liturgy," Philo takes the term to mean "recite in the context of study." Thus the initiate must instruct his friends, family and young men "so that in every place... they may be gladdened by visions of the just." As we found in the Letter of Aristeas,Aristeas, Philo does not appear to be familiar with an interpretation of these verses that requires diurnal recitation of the Shema verses themselves. 9. Diurnal Prayer and the Shema verses in Josephus and the Rule of of the Community In his Jewish Antiquities (ca. 95 C.E.), Josephus has occasion to mention the rituals of the Shema when he discusses the government established by Moses. Amidst various political and cultic arrangements, Josephus dis cusses several mechanisms Moses put in place to fashion the people into responsible citizens who will uphold the laws. Every seven years on the holiday of Shavuot all men, women and children are to gather to hear the high priest read the laws "for it is a good thing that those laws should 741 It will be recalled that the rituals are discussed in a different order in the first paragraph than in the second paragraph. See discussion on p. 538. See also Cohen, Philo Judaeus, 108 who likewise observes that Philo paraphrases the second, not the first, paragraph of the Shema here.</page><page sequence="33">Ε. S.

This last stipulation may represent an interpretation of the Shema verses which require instruction of the children ["impress [these words] upon your children" (Deut 6:7); "teach [these words] to your chil dren" (Deut 11:19)]. If Josephus is indeed paraphrasing the Shema verses here, he offers yet another interpretation of "these words." Children are to be taught "the laws," just as the entire nation hears the law once every seven years. On this reading, "these words" are understood to be the law. Since a public review of the law once every seven years is not sufficient to inculcate citizens with the necessary degree of internal responsibility, Moses also stipulates a daily ritual to reinforce fealty to the law: "Let every one commemorate before God the benefits which he bestowed upon them at their deliverance out of the land of Egypt, and this twice every day, both when the day begins and when the hour of sleep comes, gratitude being in its own nature a just thing, and serving not only by way of a return for the past, but also by way of invitation of future favors" (Ant. 4.212). The broader context suggests that this daily ritual, like the ritual reading of the law every seven years and instruction of children, works to make citi zens more cognizant of the obligations that the law places upon them. An additional reason for the ritual of diurnal prayer is stated explicitly. It is appropriate to be grateful for favors already given, especially since appre ciation can inspire additional benefaction. The question that has vexed scholars is this: What is the verbal content of the diurnal prayer with which Josephus is familiar? Did such prayer involve the recitation of the Shema verses as liturgy? Several elements of Josephus' discussion support the conclusion that Josephus refers here to the recitation of the Shema verses. After discussing the obligation to acknowledge God's generosity twice daily, he suggests that the rituals of 75י Translation of this and the following citations of Josephus from Josephus, Complete Works (trans.

Scholars conclude from the fact that Josephus' discussion of diurnal prayer is set within a broader discussion of Shema-derived rituals that the diurnal prayer is also Shema-derived and therefore consists of recitation of the Shema verses.76 Additionally, Josephus specifies that the prayer is to be said "when the day begins and when the hour of sleep comes on," which echoes the Shema's stipulation to "recite [these words]... when you lie down and when you rise up," albeit it in reverse order. In spite of this evidence, Shlomo Naeh and Aharon Shemesh argue that Josephus' diurnal prayer did not consist of recitation of the Shema verses.77 They observe that Josephus requires the supplicant to recount "the benefits which [God] bestowed them at their deliverance out of the land of Egypt." Though it is possible that this phrase alludes to God's kindness generally in taking Israel out of Egypt (a subject which the Shema verses could plausi bly be stretched to include), Naeh and Shemesh argue that the term "ben efits" should be understood quite specifically as a reference to the miraculous provisions that God provided Israel in their trials during their desert wan derings: the pillar of cloud, morning manna, evening quail and the magi cally appearing well.78 In their view, Josephus' diurnal prayer acknowledges 761 See Ezra Fleischer, "On the Beginnings of Obligatory Jewish Prayer," Tarbiz 59 (1989־ 90): 397-441 at 417-18 [Hebrew]; Emil Schiirer, The History of the Jewish People in the Age ofjesus Christ (175 B.C.-A.D. 135) (rev. and ed.

Kimelman is more cautious, leaving the relationship between this passage in Josephus and the Shema unresolved. See Kimelman, "From Covenant to Coronation," 13. Tabory follows Naeh and Shemesh (see discussion below) and expresses skepticism that Josephus refers here to the Shema. See Tabory, "Prayers and Berakhot," 289-90. 771 See Shlomo Naeh and Aharon Shemesh, "The Manna Story and the Time of Morning Prayer," Tarbiz 64 (1995): 335-40 [Hebrew]. 7י" For further ancient reflections on these miracles, see t.

Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 565 specific generous provisions by God: the manna and quail. They note that the Bible states that God provided manna in order to give the people an opportunity to reflect on God's providential role in their lives.79 In Naeh and Shemesh's reconstructed prayer, the people acknowledge the "benefits" conferred by God at the very times when they historically appeared (manna in the morning, quail in the evening). This derivation could account for the fact that Josephus mentions the morning prayer before the evening prayer: the obligation to recall God's beneficence is rooted in an interpreta tion of the manna verses. Since manna was received in the morning,80 the prayer would have initially been said in the morning. Only secondarily (according to Naeh and Shemesh) was a prayer added in the evening to commemorate the quail.81 Naeh and Shemesh offer a compelling interpretation, as they account for several distinctive features of Josephus' description of diurnal prayer. If they are correct that Josephus refers to a prayer that acknowledges the miracles of God's desert provisions,82 then this passage provides additional evidence that the Shema-derived rituals were clustered associatively with rituals that derive from other biblical passages. In a single context, Jose phus discusses the Shema-derived rituals of mezuzah, arm/hand tefillin and head tefillin and the instruction of children, but also the unrelated rituals of the public reading of the law every seven years and diurnal prayer. As we found in the Letter of Aristeas, the discussion is structured by an overarching concept (desire to instill conscientiousness towards the law and gratitude to God) and not by attention to the Shema verses as a liturgi cal text. Even if Naeh and Shemesh's conclusions are rejected, several other fac tors mitigate against concluding that Josephus' diurnal prayer consisted of a recitation of the Shema verses themselves. First, Josephus does not offer a consistent reading of the terms "these words" by which the various rituals are performed. He explains that children should be instructed in "the law," one should recite "the benefits conferred by God" and one should inscribe "the principal blessings they have received upon their doors, and show the 791 See Deut 8:3, discussed in Naeh and Shemesh, "The Manna Story," 337. "0) See Exod 11:12, 14. 811 Naeh and Shemesh cite Wisdom of Solomon as the earliest source which requires prayer at the time of the morning manna. Josephus appears to be the first to require prayer in the evening also, which Naeh and Shemesh speculate arises as a response to the evening miracle of quail. See Naeh and Shemesh, "The Manna Story," 336-37, 339. 82' Tabory regards their argument favorably. See Tabory, "Prayers and Berakhot," 289-90.</page><page sequence="36">566 Ε. S.

The term "these words" is variously interpreted as "the law," "benefits conferred by God," "principal blessings" and "wonders which declare the power of God." It is counterintuitive to conclude that Josephus would read the term "these words" in each of these various ways when discussing mezuzah, tefillin, and instruction of children, but read the term as referring to the Shema verses when discussing diurnal prayer. Finally, it should be observed that Josephus mentions morning prayer before he mentions evening prayer (they should bless "both when the day begins and when the hour of sleep comes on"). The Shema verses notably require one to "recite [these words]... when you lie down and when you rise up," which when interpreted according to the house of Hillel83 requires praying at the time of lying down (evening) and at the time of rising up (morning). If Josephus understands the Shema verses to dictate diurnal prayer, he does not feel the need to describe the prayer in the terms pro vided by the biblical text, nor does he feel the need to mention the prayers in the order provided by the biblical text. This observation is central because I believe that certain interpretive stances with regard to the Shema verses (which Josephus does not exhibit) need to be in place before the instructions to "recite [these words]" can be understood self-referentially as requiring recitation of the Shema verses themselves. If one encounters the biblical text and understands it to require recitation of the Shema verses, one must have a hyper-literal 1st interpretation of the text. Such an inter pretive stance enables the term "these words" to be read as referring to the text of the Shema verses themselves, but it also requires reading other fea tures of the text hyper-literally. I am inclined to believe that someone who read the Shema verses as requiring their recitation as liturgy would also be attentive to the fact that evening prayer is mentioned before morning prayer and would reflect this attention in his or her explication of the rit ual, as the house of Hillel does. We find no indications that Josephus inter acted with the Shema verses in this hyper-literal manner. The Rule of the Community from the Dead Sea Scrolls also contains an allusion to prayer that many scholars have taken to be a reference to the recitation of the Shema verses. Towards the end of the scroll, the text pre scribes a daily, weekly and yearly regimen of prayer. In that context we find the following instructions: "״ See m. Ber. 1:3·</page><page sequence="37">Ε.

Notably, the words used by the Rule Rule of the Community to describe the ritual are not identical to the terms used in the Shema verses. Where the Rule of the Community speaks of "day and night entering" {'im mavo yom velaylah) and "evening and morning departing" (veim motze ere ν uvoker), the Shema verses suggest recitation is to be done "when you lie down and when you rise up."86 Where the Rule of the of the Community understands the ritual to consist of "reciting/saying His statutes" pernor hukav), the Shema verses ask one to "speak of [these words]" (vedibarta bam). Nonetheless, the idea that one reenacts the cov enant twice daily through a ritual recitation does have striking similarities to the significance attributed to the Shema liturgy by the rabbis.87 Even more striking is the fact that one should "cry for joy" in a range of different positions and places: "when I go out and come in, sit and stand, and when laid on my couch" (lines 13 and 14). The plurality of circumstances which elicit prayer recalls the language of Deut 6:7: "Speak of them when you are 84י Text cited according to Elisha Qimron and James H.

Charlesworth et al.; Tubingen: Mohr, 1994), 1-52 at 45. 851 Talmon argues that the daily affirmations were recited six times, rather than twice, daily. See S. Talmon, "The 'Manual of Benedictions' of the Sect of the Judaean Desert," RevQ 2/8 (1960): 475-500 at 481-83. For a refutation of this view, see Schiffman, Reclaiming the Dead Dead Sea Scrolls, 292; Esther Glickler Chazon, "When Did They Pray? Times for Prayer in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Associated Literature," in For a Later Generation: The Transforma tiontion of Tradition in Israel, Early Judaism, and Early Christianity (ed. Randal A.

Werline; Harrisburg, Pa.: Trinity Press International, 2000), 42-51 at 44; Baumgarten, "Invented Traditions," 205. 861 Esther Chazon suggests that the sectarian regimen of prayer in the morning and evening derives from their interest in heavenly cycles and is connected to their widely observed commitments to a solar calendar. See Chazon, "When Did They Pray?" 43-47. 87, Baumgarten argues that this is a reference to the Shema. According to Baumgarten, the Shema liturgy was instituted at the Temple as part of the larger Hasmonean program to bolster their authority. In this view, the sectarians continued the new tradition of reciting the Shema, but adapted the liturgy so that it served as a repudiation of the version recited at the Temple in Jerusalem.

The Rule of the Community, however, switches the order of the situations that elicit prayer/recitation. Where the biblical verses speak of (1) sitting; (2) walking; (3) lying; and (4) rising, the Rule of the the Community offers them in the following order: (1) going out (=walk ing?); (2) coming in (=?); (3) sitting; (4) rising; and (5) lying [on your couch]. If the Rule of the Community's description of prayer is informed by the language of the Shema verses, it is only loosely so.88 Once again, I would argue the Rule of the Community does not reflect the hyper-literal conception of the Shema verses necessary to read the term "these words" self-referentially. In conclusion, though both Josephus and the Rule of the Community know of prayer practices that are associated with the Shema verses, neither source offers conclusive proof that the hyper-literal conception of the verses that is necessary if one is to read the instruction to "recite [these words]" as a reference to the Shema verses is in evidence during the Second Temple period. If anything, in their allusive strategies towards the Shema verses, Josephus and the Rule of the Community reflect a mode of engaging the biblical text which is not focused on fine textual details. When and where, then, do we find the hyper-literal way of engaging the Shema verses that makes possible the recitation of the Shema verses as liturgy? 10. From Qumran Tefillin to the Bar Kokhba Tefillin The tefillin slips found at Qumran date to the second and first century BCE and constitute another piece of evidence as to how the term "these words" were interpreted in the Second Temple Period. As suggested earlier, the tefillin slips contain a variety of different biblical passages in addition to those contained in standard rabbinic tefillin.89 Yehudah Cohn's research suggests that biblical passages were included in Qumran tefillin for three Qimron and Charlesworth remain non-committal regarding the question of whether this language alludes to the Shema and Deut 6:4-7. See Qimron and Charlesworth, "Rule of the Community (1QS)," 45. Chazon also adopts a cautious approach. See Esther Click ler Chazon, "Prayers from Qumran and Their Historical Implications," DSD 1 (1994): 265-84, esp. 276. By way of contrast, Talmon and Schiffman confidently assume that this passage refers to the Shema. See Talmon, "The 'Manual of Benedictions' of the Sect of the Judaean Desert," 489, and Schiffman, Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls, 293.

Cohn argues that the practice of tefillin emerged as an attempt to "juda ize" pagan amulet practice.90 Where pagans placed significant texts from their tradition into amulets intended to provide protection, Jews turned to their central text (the Bible) to substantiate a similar practice. Cohn suggests that the promise of long life in Deut 11:21 combined with the instruction in adjacent verses to "bind [these words] on your arms/hand and place them as frontlet between your eyes" led to the initial inclusion of the second paragraph of the Shema (Deut 11:13-21) in tefillin.91 Cohn assumes that the verses instructing one to "bind these words" were read figuratively in early Second Temple times.92 From the focus on Deut 11:13-21 three bases for including biblical passages in the amulets emerged. First, it was helpful if the passage offered a promise of long life and divine protection. On this basis, Cohn suggests that Deut 32 was sometimes the biblical passage of choice.93 Cohn speculates that 4QDeutn and 4QDeut', which contain Deut 8:5-10, were also tefillin slips. Deut 8:5-10 promises bountiful life on the land as a reward for loyal per formance of God's commandments. If these scrolls are indeed tefillin slips, then they provide evidence of another passage that was placed in tefillin because it offered divine blessing.94 Second, since the instruction verses were understood to require placing "these words" in the amulet, it was also helpful if the passage was characterized in the biblical text as "words" or as "יי See Cohn, Tangled up in Text, 55-102, esp. 89-91. Though rabbinic tefillin and most Qumran tefillin slips (with the notable exception of 4QPhyl N) contain the four biblical verses that are understood to be instructions for tefillin practice, Cohn speculates that the practice first arose in connection with interpretation of Deut 11:21 alone. He argues that the association of tefillin with verses from Exodus was a secondary development. See Cohn, Tangled up in Text, 69, 95. See figurative use of similar language in Prov 1:8-9; 3:3, 22; 6:20-22; 7:3. See discussion in Cohn, Tangled up in Text, 46-48. lJ3) See 4QPhyl Ν which includes Deut 32:(9-13), 14-20 (21-31), 32-33.

Cohn discusses the ratio nale for including Deut 32 in tefillin at Cohn, Tangled up in Text, 93-94. Contra Milik who was the initial editor of the Qumran tefillin, Nakman argues that 4QPhyl Ν is not a tefillin slip.

Alexander / Journal for the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 531-579 "these words."95 On this basis, Deut 32 (Song of Moses) and Deut 5 (the Decalogue) were included, since Moses describes them as "words" or "these words." Finally, since the instruction verses from the second paragraph of the Shema (Deut 11:18) were initially included by virtue of their proxim ity to the promise for long-life, there developed a sense that the instruction verses should also be included in tefillin. Most of the Qumran tefillin con tain the instruction verses from the first and second paragraphs of the Shema (Deut 6 and 11), in addition to a substantial amount of the pas sages preceding the instruction verses (Deut 5 and 10). The Qumran tefil lin also contain passages from Exod 13 which require one to make a "sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead." (Cohn argues that these verses were understood metaphorically during the early part of the Second Temple period).96 In many instances when the instruction verses are included in the Qum ran tefillin slips, they are "padded" with substantial sections of the preced ing passages. For example, even though no mention of tefillin practice is made until Exod 13:11, XQPhyl 1 includes Exod 12:43-13:10 (XQPhyl 3 from the same set and found in the same housing contains the instruction verses, Exod 13:11-16). We find here a pattern that is repeated in many places: the passages that precede the instruction verses are cited at great length. This practice suggests one additional way of reading the term "these words": "the words" to be included in the tefillin are the text immediately preceding the instruction verses.97 In conclusion, biblical passages were included in the Qumran tefillin for a variety of reasons. Passages were included because (1) they were thought to invoke divine protection (Deut 11:21, Deut 32, Deut 8:5-10); (2) they were named in the biblical text as "words," which seemed an appropriate way to fulfill the instructions regarding "these words" (Deut 5, Deut 32); (3) they included the instructions for the ritual (Deut 6, Deut 11, Exod 13); and (4) they immediately preceded the instruction verses (Deut 5, Deut 10 and Exod 12). In point of fact, the content of most tefillin slips can be accounted for by more than one of these principles. Cohn empha sizes that reading the instruction verses as ritual instructions constituted a ',5י The Decalogue is called "these words" at Deut 5:19 and Exod 20:1. The Song of Moses (Deut 32) is called "these words" at Deut 32:45. %l See Cohn, Tangled up in Text, 39-41, 45-53. 971 Nakman explains this practice resulted from an interpretation of "these words" as a reference to the speech Moses had given prior to giving the instruction verses.

It is very striking that these tefillin include only those passages which the rabbis include in their tefillin (Exod 13:1-16, Deut 6:4-9, Deut 11:13-21). The Bar Kokhba tefillin are more narrowly focused on the instruction verses and the verses immediately preceding them. Apparently between the first century B.C.E. and second century C.E. a shift occurred.100 Whereas earlier tefillin were understood to function as the fulfillment of several different principles, by the Bar Kokhba period the practice was understood to be a means of fulfilling the instruction verses.101 Here in the Bar Kokhba tefillin we finally find an interpretation of the term "these words" that makes possible the recitation of the Shema verses as liturgy. The "words" that are included in the Bar Kokhba tefillin are what later come to be known as the first and second paragraphs of the Shema (Deut 6:4-9 and Deut 11:13-21).102 I would like to argue that the rabbis engaged in an interpretive strategy very similar to the one exhibited by Philo. Earlier I suggested that Philo was familiar with the Alexandrian trope (attested in the Letter ofAristeas) of associating the hand with justice. Philo took a motif associated with a single one of the rituals discussed in the instruction verses (hand/arm n) See Cohn, Tangled up in Text, 89-92, 129.

Where the Letter ofAristeasofAristeas had said that only hand/arm tefillin promote the performance of justice, Philo understood all the Shema rituals to be a means of instilling principles of justice. Philo was unique among Second Temple sources in his desire to impose uniformity on the passage. Neither the Letter of Aristeas nor Josephus offers a consistent read of the term "these words" by which the rituals are fulfilled. I have suggested that the general reticence to read ing the term consistently throughout the passage results from the fact that Josephus and Aristeas attend to the verses insofar as they describe embod ied practice. They are not primarily engaging the verses as text. Philo, by way of contrast, does engage the verses as a text, as he makes clear in the fact that he follows the biblical text so closely. His exegetical orientation leads him to impose uniformity on the passage so that the term "these words" has a consistent meaning throughout. I speculate that the rabbinic practice of reciting the Shema verses as lit urgy flows from a similar exegetical move. The Bar Kokhba tefillin attest to a reading of the term "these words" as the instruction verses themselves. It makes sense that Judean interpreters wanted, like Philo in Alexandria, to read the paragraph in a uniform manner. They read the instruction to "recite [these words]" as requiring the recitation of the very same verses included in tefillin, namely the Shema verses.10-' 11.

On the difference between the "developmental model" and the "reflective model" in considering the relationship between Qumran and rabbinic halakah, see Aharon Shemesh, Halakhah in the Making: The Develop mentment ofJewish Law from Qumran to the Rabbis (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009), 3-7.

The first and most important development in the tannaitic period is that the term "these words" is understood in a new way. The "words" by which one performs the rituals are not God's ordi nances generally (as in the Letter of Aristeas). They are not the Decalogue or other texts assumed to have protective powers (as in the Qumran tefil lin). They are not the principles of justice (as in Philo). For the rabbis, "the words" subject to ritualization are the very biblical texts that are presumed to prescribe the rituals. Thus we read in Sip re Deut. 35: "And you shall bind them (Deut 6:8). These [and not other verses] are for binding." I call this development the textualization of ritual because a ritual that formerly could be fulfilled through a variety of principles and passages was now fulfilled by means of the very text that was taken to prescribe the ritual.105 The new way of practicing tefillin rested on—and helped reinforce—a conception of the biblical text as deserving attention.106 In a world of increasingly potent biblical scriptural texts, the practice of tefillin galva nized the power of biblical scripture by incorporating it onto the body. The 11141 It is important to note that my hypothesis regarding the process by which the Shema verses came to be recited as liturgy does not account for how the third paragraph (Num 15:37-41) came to be included in the liturgical cycle. In seeing the initial impetus for the Shema's recitation as coming from the first two paragraphs I follow Elbogen ,Jewish Liturgy,Liturgy, 23;Tabory, "Prayers and Berakhot," 291-92; Cohen, Philo Judaeus, 108, 167-76. My analysis does, however, suggest a reason for the eventual inclusion of the third para graph: It, like the first two paragraphs, refers to a concrete ritual practice by which Jewish identity is marked and performed on the body. "15) Cohn discusses a common ancient practice in which the instructions for or the mythi cal origins of a ritual become part and parcel of the ritual. See Cohn, Tangled up in Text, 95-96, esp. n. 152. 106, In his many writings Kugel documents the attentions that the biblical text received during the late Second Temple period. See esp. James L.

Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 textualization of ritual that we find with tefillin was one part of a broader cultural process taking place during the latter part of the Second Temple period. During this period, biblical scripture began to assume a new sig nificance as a locus of divine presence. The biblical text was more and more attracting attention, more and more assumed to be worthy of intense scru tiny, and significant in all of its details. In this cultural context, recitation, performance and interpretation of scripture became new pious practices.107 These other related developments contributed to a new framing of tefillin. What had formerly been a protective amulet was now a ritual means of incorporating biblical text onto the body.108 We can detect early signs of the "textualization of ritual" in Philo. On one hand, Philo discusses the rituals because they offer an embodied way to internalize a foundational principle of Judaism, justice. (We saw the same tendency exhibited by the Letter of Aristeas, Josephus and Matt 23). Unlike these other writers, however, Philo ties the rituals back to the bibli cal text from which they were assumed to derive. We see this in the fact that he frames his discussion as a paraphrastic rendering of the relevant verses and in the fact that he offers a consistent reading of "these words."

Alexander / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 531-579 575 I further argue that the interpretation of "these words" exhibited by the Bar Kokhba tefillin supports the possibility of a new ritual practice. Once the first and second paragraphs of the Shema came to be thought of as the "words" by which rituals (tefillin and mezuzah) are performed, it became possible to understand in a new way what it means to "repeat [these words] to your children, and speak of them, when you are at home and when you are away, when you go lie down and when you rise up" (Deut 6:7-8). While Philo derives from this phrase the imperative to instruct disciples and friends in justice and the Letter ofAristeas sees in it the obligation to meditate on God's devisings and the miraculous transition from sleep to waking, the rabbis take it to require recitation of the Shema verses them selves as liturgy. Thus we read in Sipre Deut. 34: "Andyou shall repeat them to your to your children (Deut 6:7). These [and not other verses] shall you repeat." The fact that the rituals alluded to in these verses had been textualized brought renewed attention to the verses as a source of ritual. Recitation of the Shema verses emerges for the rabbis as a new kind of ritual.109 The Shema verses were recited as liturgy because Judaean Jews (maybe only the rabbis, maybe others as well?) sensed that these verses were a text that demanded to be internalized through ritual. What better way to internal ize the text of these verses in ritual than by reciting them? I call this second stage in the process by which the Shema verses came to be recited as liturgy the "ritualization of text." A text that was not formerly subject to liturgical recitation became so by virtue of the text's association with other rituals. As I have shown, these rituals had recently come to be seen as a means of internalizing and embodying the text of the instruction verses. One interesting consequence of understanding the term "these words" to refer to the full paragraphs of the Shema is that the doctrinal prologues were now linked to the rituals. The textual rituals (Shema, tefillin and mezuzah) now became, in part, about affirming the covenantal relation ship between Israel and God (as expressed in the doctrinal prologues). The textual rituals, however, had another meaning that was equally as central to them in their rabbinic iteration. These rituals engaged the Shema verses as scriptural text to be embodied and internalized. The rabbinic position was one among several about what the rituals aim to accomplish. For Philo, the rituals point the practitioner towards justice; for the Letter ofAristeas, "w) Cohn speculatively proposes such a link between tefillin and Shema recitation.

Alexander I Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 they remind one of God; for Josephus, they cultivate consciousness of God's beneficence. For the rabbis, the rituals were a means of internalizing the biblical text. In this regard, they were understood to be a form ofTorah study."0 Insofar as these rituals incorporated the text of the Bible into the body, they functioned like Torah study, which was the premiere ritual by which the rabbis internalized scriptural verses. Thus we read in the Mekilta: They They They shall be a memorial between your eyes in order that the Torah of God shall be be in your mouth (Exod 13:9). From here they said: Anyone who wears tefillintefillin is like one who reads Torah, and whoever reads Torah is exempt from wearing tefillin" (Mek. Bo 17, ed. H-R68).1" In this midrashic tradi tion, the practice of tefillin is taken to be redundant with respect to the practice ofTorah study. The two practices are so much of a piece that one who is already engaged in Torah study does not need to perform the dis tinct ritual of wearing tefillin. Wearing tefillin, like studying Torah, is a way of integrating Torah into the self. Several tannaitic sources draw a similar connection between Torah study and recitation of the Shema."2 The most explicit linking of the two prac tices, however, is found in an early amoraic statement recorded in Bavli. There the sages consider the question of how one is to fulfill properly the requirement of Josh 1:8 that the "book ofTorah should not depart from your mouth." Does one need to study Torah all hours of the day and night? R. Ammi proposes that it is enough to study just one chapter in the morn ing and one chapter in the evening. Just as people use the expression "A to Z" to refer to all that comes in between, so one may study a bit in the morning and in the evening and thereby infuse all that comes in between with the flavor ofTorah. R. Yohanan in the name of the tanna R. Shimon ״" י Moshe Benovitz, ״Shinun■. Recitation of the Shema," attributes the view that recitation of the Shema is a form ofTorah study to R. Shimon b. Yohai. Hirschman, The Stabilization of of Rabbinic Culture, 32-39, extends Benovitz's thesis to include recitation of the second paragraph of the Shema. He argues that this paragraph also was viewed as Torah study. Hirschman follows Benovitz in attributing this view to R. Shimon b. Yohai. "" See also t. San. 4:7: [When the king] goes out to war, [his personal Torah scroll] is with him... R. Yehudah says: A Torah scroll on his right [hand/arm] and tefillin on his left." Text according to Vienna MS and editio princeps. "2' The most explicit is m. Ber. 2:1 which regards recitation of Shema as a subset of the larger category ofTorah study. As long as one intends it, one's Torah study of Deut 6:4-9 may do double duty as liturgical recitation of Shema. See also t. Ber. 2:12-13 which appears to consider the recitation of Shema and Torah study as parallel phenomena insofar as a ba'al qeriqeri is either not restricted (or only minimally restricted) in his ability to do these activities. By way of contrast, a ba'al qeri may not engage in the study of Oral Torah.</page><page sequence="47">Ε. S. Alexander / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 577 b. Yohai offers a slight variation of this tradition, making it even easier to fulfill the requirement to study Torah always: "Even if a man only recites Shema in the morning and the evening he has fulfilled the commandment of'the book of Torah shall not depart from your mouth'" (b. Men. 99b).113 In its essence, the ritual of reciting the Shema verses is the same thing as the ritual of studying Torah. Therefore, one fulfills the obligation to study Torah when one recites the Shema. This is because recitation of the Shema is essentially constituted by recitation of scriptural verses that are explicitly marked as verses to be internalized through ritual. 12. Exempting Women from the Shema and Tefillin I argue that the rabbis exempt women from the Shema and tefillin because they know from elsewhere that women are exempt from Torah study. The fact that in their essence wearing tefillin and reciting the Shema are a form of Torah study means that women are exempt from these rituals also. The rabbis make explicit that women are exempt from tefillin because of the ritual's link to Torah study. "Can it be that women are obligated like men regarding tefillin? Scripture states, In order that the Torah of God be in your your mouth. I said [tefillin] only regarding those who are [also] obligated with respect to Torah study" {Mek. Bo, 17, ed. H-R 68).114 Here women's exemption from tefillin is explicitly linked to their exemption from Torah study. Since tefillin are in their essence a form ofTorah study, anyone who is exempt from Torah study is also is exempt from tefillin. On this basis, women are exempt from wearing tefillin. The rabbis do not articulate their reasons for exempting women from the obligation to recite the Shema. M. Ber. 3:3 simply states that women are exempt from reciting the Shema and wearing tefillin, but obligated to perform other rituals involving texts (they are obligated to recite the "3י Hirschman notes a parallel in the Yerushalmi and speculates that this statement in the Bavli has authentic tannaitic roots and can genuinely be attributed to R. Shimon b. Yohai. See See Hirshman, The Stabilization of Rabbinic Culture, 39. On the issue of Shema as a form ofTorah study, see also Midrash Tehillim, 1:17 (ed. Buber, 15) and discussion in Shevah Yalon, " 'Women Are Exempted from All Positive Ordinances That Are Bound up with a Stated Time': A Study in Tannaic and Amoraic Sources" (Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan University, 1989), 30-31 [Hebrew]. IUI This rationale for women's exemption from tefillin is also attested in b. Kid. 30a. See discussion of this exegesis in Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, "From Whence the Phrase 'Time bound Positive Commandments'?" JQR 97/3 (2007): 317-46 at 335-39, 343.</page><page sequence="48">578 Ε. S.

Both rituals (as rabbinically conceived) were practiced according to a particular understanding of the meaning of the term "these words" in the first and second paragraphs of the Shema. Both rituals engaged the Shema verses as exemplars of scripture to be embodied and internalized. Both rituals incorporated the biblical text onto and into the body in a manner similar toTorah study."71 would argue that the rabbis exempted women from reciting the Shema for the same reason that they exempted women from wearing tefillin: because in its essence it was a form ofTorah study, and the rabbis knew from elsewhere that women were exempt from Torah study.118 Were we to ask how the rabbis know that women are exempt from Torah study, we might see that the matter was not as self-evident as they represent it in the discussion cited here. For the "י' One important question concerns the motivation for the rabbis obligating women in mezuzah. Why are women exempt from Shema and tefillin, on one hand, but obligated with regard to mezuzah, on the other? My gut instinct is that there was a long-standing tradition from the second temple period that women were obligated with respect to mezu zah and that rabbinic sources reflect this received tradition. See Philo, Spec. Laws 4:142: "He bids them also write and set them forth in front of the doorposts of each house and the gates in their walls, so that those who leave or remain at home, citizens and strangers alike, may read the inscriptions engraved on the face of the gates and keep in perpetual memory what they should say and do, careful alike to do and to allow no injustice, and when they enter their houses and again when they go forth men and women and children and servants alike alike may act as is due and fitting both for others and for themselves" (Emphasis added). Two points are noteworthy in Philo's discussion of the ritual of mezuzah. First, he interprets the ritual as a means of instilling justice. Second, Philo assumes that the practice of mezu zah has an implication for all people who pass by it: men and women, young and old, free and slave, citizen and stranger. Philo thus provides evidence of a pre-rabbinic tradition that mezuzah was relevant for a broad range of the Jewish (and human) community. I speculate that when the rabbis obligate women, slaves and minors in mezuzah they draw on an inher ited tradition similar to the one that stands behind Philo. "'יי See David Weiss Halivni on the Mishnah's reticence to provide reasons (justifications) for its prescriptions. See Halivni, Midrash, Mishnah, and Gemara: The Jewish Predilection for Justified Justified Law, 38-65. 1171 Their parallelism is also manifest in Sipre Deut. 258, which prohibits reciting Shema and wearing tefillin in "dirty" places (launderer's vat, in a bathhouse or tannery). One important difference between Shema and tefillin is that the Shema may be recited in any language (m. Sotah 3:1), but tefillin may only be written in Hebrew letters (m. Meg. 1:8). See Yalon, "'Women Are Exempted'," 30-31, and 41, η. 1.</page><page sequence="49">Ε. S. Alexander I Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 531-579 579 moment, however, I want to grant the rabbis their claim. Herein we see the logic behind exempting women from the most central doctrinal affirma tion that exists in Judaism. The latest redactional layer of the Bavli (450 600 C.E.) recognizes that it is counterintuitive to exempt women from reciting the Shema: "You might say that [women should be obligated] because the Shema affirms the kingship of heaven" (b. Ber. 20b). I would argue that though it is compelling to think that women should be obli gated because of the doctrinal centrality of the Shema verses, the deepest significance of the ritual recitation of the Shema lay in the way that it ritu alized text study. By turning textual recitation into a daily liturgical ritual, the rabbis made it possible for (male) Jews of all stripes to be engaged with the most central of rabbinic pious practices, Torah study. As a form of Torah study, however, the Shema was also a ritual from which the rabbis had no choice but to exempt women. Or at least, that was how they saw the matter.</page></plain_text>
