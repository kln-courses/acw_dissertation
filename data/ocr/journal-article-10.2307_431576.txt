Euoi! -The Bacchantes My, my, my, my ... -Mick Jagger The Phrygians settled in ancient Anatolia (now Turkey) in the second millennium B.C. E., prob- ably from Macedonia and Thrace, and domi- nated Asia Minor from the thirteenth to the seventh century B.C.E., when they were de- feated by the Cimmerians. Phrygians left mag- nificent tombs and shrines. They were highly proficient at building and fortification tech- niques, at wood and ivory carving, at bronze work and metallurgy. It is said that the Phrygians invented the clasp and the art of embroidery. They were weavers of mohair, hemp, linen and tapestry, and wove the antecedents of our Per- sian carpets. Their pottery is decorated with animals and birds, geometric patterns, swas- tikas, mazes and lozenges. Their clothing was colorful and highly decorated with patterns and tassels. They were considered to be exceptional musicians, and were believed by the Greeks to be the inventors of the flute, the cymbals, the triangle and the syrinx. Because they were con- sidered to be refined and artistic, they were favored by the Greeks and Romans as slaves. But the Phrygian cap, a soft, fitted cap with a pointed crown that curls forward, became a symbol of resistance, and was worn by emanci- pated slaves in Greece and Rome.' (Later, the Phrygian cap became a symbol of emancipation in the French Revolution.) Spinning, weaving, metallurgy, music and dancing were all associated with the principal deity of Phrygia, the Great Goddess Kubile, Kubaba or Matar Kubile, Mother of all deities, humans and beasts, Goddess of life, death and regeneration. Kubile was called Cybele or Cy- bebe by the Greeks, Kybele by the Lydians, Mater Deum Magna Ideae by the Romans, and was also worshipped in Lycia, Thrace, Syria, Phoenecia, North Africa, Spain, Gaul, Britain, and Germany. (In Rome, Cybele was also known as the Berecynthian Mother, Augusta the Great One, Alma the Nourishing One, Sanctissima the Most Holy One, and as Rhea Lobrine, Goddess of sacred caves. The Goddess is both one and many; the names of the Goddess in her various manifestations of Maiden, Mother or Crone in- clude Britomartis, Dictynna, Ma, Dindymene, Hecate, Gaia, Pheraia, Artemis, Baubo, Aphaia, Ortheia, Nemesis, Demeter, Persephone, Se- lene, Medusa, Eleuthera, Leto, Hera, Aphro- dite, Bendis, Hathor, Taeit and Isis.2 In some manifestations the Goddess is the earth or the universe itself, space and time and all within it, and is beyond male and female, beyond all du- alities.) Kubile is a Mountain Mother or God- dess, and sometimes takes the form of a moun- tain. Anthropomorphic sculptures and wall carvings of Kubile show her flanked by lions or leopards, or holding a lion in her lap. (Represen- tations of the Great Goddess flanked by lions or leopards in Anatolia date back to the sixth mil- lennium B.C.E. The Goddess is also seen and associated with birds, serpents or the moon. Later, the Goddess in her bird form is trans- formed into a siren or a harpie; the serpent, also associated with Dionysus and Attis, becomes a symbol of evil; and the moon is thought to give rise to insanity, especially in women.) The God- dess and music is "an ever-recurring combina- tion." Kubile or her attendants are often de- picted with drums, double aulos, lyre, flute, syrinx, castanets, and especially cymbals and tambourine. Her attendant Maenads (mad ones) are often dancing, and it was said that the dance Kubile taught the Corybantes could cure mental illness. (In the worship of the Goddess, spir- ituality, healing and the erotic are all associated with music and dance.) The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 48:4 Fall 1990</page><page sequence="2">396 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism The Phrygians also worshipped Dionysus, a consort of the Goddess thought to have origi- nated in Phrygia or Thrace. Dionysus, a nature god of vegetation and especially wine and ec- stasy, is the son of Semele, a Phrygian earth goddess. (In one his oldest forms Dionysus is the horned Dionysus Melanaigis, Dionysus of the Black Goatskin.) Dionysus had many converts among women, who were said to abandon their families to join his worshippers. Among these worshippers were Maenads or (Roman) Bac- chantes, a group of women who had occult powers, could charm snakes and suckle animals, and had great physical strength. (Bacchantes were sometimes referred to as "mothers." The Greeks and Romans claimed that the Bacchantes would tear to pieces any man who dared witness their ritual.) Wearing faun skins and crowns of ivy, they danced by torchlight to the rhythm of the flute and drum, crying "Euoi! Euoi! " Their dance was enhanced by the consumption of spot- ted toadstools that induced altered states of con- sciousness and qualities associated with Diony- sus and the Goddess herself: great strength, erotic power, visions, the gift of prophecy, the power of healing, and collectivity. (Much later in the Renaissance, women were burned as witches because their visions and "divinations" threat- ened the Clerics, their midwifery and healing with herbs threatened the Physicians, and their dancing, nakedness, sexuality and autonomy threatened the patriarchy in general.) When the Ionians, Acheans and Dorians in- vaded Mycenea (Greece) from c. 2500 to c. 1000 B.C. E., they brought with them worship of the thunderbolt god Zeus and a patriarchal or- der. (The name "Zeus" derives from a word meaning "sky" or "heaven." An earlier Zeus of Crete is a young consort of the Goddess.) Un- able to eradicate worship of the various aspects of the Great Goddess, they instead appropriated and subordinated them. Zeus rapes them, fathers them, marries them. The powerful Great God- dess Hera, worshipped long before Zeus, be- comes his petty and jealous wife. (Jane Ellen Harrison tells us that Hera represents a matri- linear system, and that Zeus and Hera's marital difficulties show that she was "coerced, but never really subdued by an alien conqueror. ")3 The moon and snake Goddess Athena, peaceful protectress of the home, the town, patroness of wisdom, arts and skills, becomes martial and motherless, springing fully armored from the head of Zeus, representing cool reason, and siding with the gods against women. (Athena was the special protectress of spinners and weav- ers, but when Arachne weaves a tapestry supe- rior to that of Athena, a tapestry with scenes critical of the gods, Athena tears it to shreds and turns Arachne into a spider.) Aphrodite, a Great Mother associated with powerful procreative energy, now the daughter of Zeus and Dionne, is married to the vulgar fire god Hephaestus, and becomes temptress, seductress. The many- breasted Artemis, Goddess of fertile mother- hood, becomes the embodiment of chastity. Pan- dora, the Maiden aspect of the Goddess who is giver of all gifts and abundance, becomes bringer of disease, pain, death. Zeus seduces Semele, no longer a goddess but a mortal, and becomes the father of the once fatherless Vine- Dionysus. (When Semele asks to see Zeus in his god-form, she is killed by the magnitude of his presence, and fetus Dionysus is transferred to and gestates in Zeus's thigh.)4 And Zeus rapes Kubile, and she gives birth to a hermaphroditic being named Agdistis, a being later castrated by Dionysus. Agdistis comes to love Attis, consort of Kubile. (Although Kubile is often presented as independent of any male demiurge, in some traditions she is accompanied by Attis, her son or lover. Like Dionysus, Ado- nis, Linus and Osiris, Attis is a vegetation god who is resurrected after his death.5 In sculpture and carvings, Attis is almost always much smaller than the Goddess, is feminine in appearance, and is often playing instruments or dancing for her or by himself. He sometimes wears a crown of pop- pies, pine cones, flowers and corn ears.) When Attis becomes involved with another woman, he is driven mad by the wrath of Agdistis and cas- trates himself under a pine tree. (After the image and sacred stone of Kubile were transported to Rome in 204 B.C.E. from Pessinus, Agdistis is equated with Kubile/Cybele, and the Goddess's high priests, called galli or "cocks," castrated themselves in the frenzy of their worship. There is no mention of such practices in the descriptions of the rites of the Goddess in Phrygia.6) The Dorian invasion was followed by a cul- tural dark age. The Spartan Dorians, who gave first priority to their military, attempted to eradi- cate music, dancing and poetry on the grounds</page><page sequence="3">Cox History of Music 397 that they gave rise to effeminacy. But gradually the Dorians advanced the worship of Apollo, and were early influences on the development of Classical Greek art. (Originally, Apollo was the son of the Moon Goddess Artemis; later he became her twin, appropriated her lyre, and laid claim to her powers of prophecy, music, poetry, magic and healing. Apollo also adopted the Muses and the Graces as his own, and slew the Serpent who guarded the shrine at Delphi, the shrine that belonged to the earth Goddess Gaia or Rhea, and confiscated the shrine's oracle for himself. Nietzsche tells us that Apollo repre- sents light, measure, restraint, individuation. Apollonian art draws an aesthetic veil over real- ity, creating an ideal world of form and beauty. The Apollonian tendency is best manifested in the plastic arts, and is timeless and eternal. Dionysus, in contrast, represents the process of life, breaking down barriers and ignoring re- straints, becoming one with Primordial Unity. Dionysian art embraces existence in all its dark- ness and horror. It is constantly changing, and takes the form of music and tragedy. Nietzsche does not mention that Dionysus was a consort of the Goddess.)7 Even in the late archaic age, an age of Zeus and Apollo, women continued to worship the Goddess and lament the dying god with music, lyric and dance. Among these are Phantasia of Memphis, Megolastrata of Sparta, Telesilla of Argos, Corinna of Boetia, Praxilla of Sicyon, and Sappho and Erinna of Lesbos in Asia Minor. Sappho (sixth century B.C.E.) was admired for her vernacular, personal songs about love ("Love shook my heart, like a wind falling on oaks on the mountain"), her intimate appeals to Aphrodite, her songs of the moon.8 She accom- panied herself with the lyre, flute and pectis, is said to have developed the mixolydian mode, and used the "woman's hexameter" (reportedly developed by Phantasia and Themis) or freer meters of her own devising. There were many women's choirs in this age, women sang, played instruments and danced in religious festivals and dramas, and working women had songs for win- nowing, reaping, baking, water-gathering and the mill. But gradually men took over the women's choirs and religious rituals, and women were barred from the choral dramas. (The great trag- edies or "goat songs" of the Classical age were associated with Dionysus, but the female char- acters were sung and enacted by men. In one of these dramas, Euripedes gives voice to the Bac- chantes: When will I dance once more with bare feet the all-night dances tossing my head for joy in the damp air, in the dew as a running fawn might frisk for the green joy of the wide fields ... to dance for joy in the forest, to dance where the darkness is deepest, where no man is.)9 Socrates tells us that the Mixolydian and "in- tense Lydian" mode, and others similar, should be done away with; for "they are useless even to women who are to make the best of themselves, let alone to men." Their soft harmonies, he believes, give rise to drunkenness, softness and sloth. He prefers a harmony that "would fit- tingly imitate the utterances and the accents of a brave man who is engaged in warfare or in any enforced business." (The Lydians were neigh- bors of the Phrygians and worshipped the God- dess. Socrates says he does not know the Phry- gian mode.) Socrates prefers the instruments of Apollo to those of Marsyas, a Phrygian satyr said to have invented the syrinx, who was slain when he lost a music contest with Apollo. (And Socrates also says that the love of Aphrodite is insanity, madness, licentiousness. The right love is a sober and harmonious love of the orderly and beautiful.) Aristotle tells us that professional musicians are vulgar, that performing music is unmanly, except when drunk or for fun. And he believes the Phrygian mode should not be allowed, for the Phrygian harmony has the same effect among harmonies as the aulos among instruments-both are violently exciting and emotional. This is shown by poetry; for all Bacchic versification and all movement of that sort belong particularly to the aulos among the instruments, and these metres find their suitable accompaniment in melodies in the Phrygian harmony. And all agree, Aristotle continues, "that the Dorian harmony is more sedate and of a spe- cially manly character." Atheneus (c. 200 C.E.) tells us that the</page><page sequence="4">398 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism Phrygians sang "in honor of the Mountain Moth- er, amid the auloi," and that storax, burned as incense at the festivals of Dionysus, produces a "Phrygian odor" to those who smell it. Clement of Alexandria (c. 200 C.E.) says of tragedians and poets, "who are altogether like drunken men, let us wreathe them, if you like, with ivy, while they are performing the mad revels of the Bacchic rite, and shut them up, satyrs and fren- zied rout and all." Clement derides a Scythian for "beating upon a typanum and like some priest of Cybele sounding a cymbal which hung from his neck," for "he had become unmanly among the Greeks and a teacher of the disease of effeminacy." Basil the Great of Asia Minor (330-379) recounts that Pythagoras sobered some drunken revellers by having an aulete play for them in the Dorian mode. And Boethius (c. 600 C.E.) tells us that the ancient Timotheus angered the Spartans by playing complex rhythms and harmonies, by using the chromatic genus "which is more effeminate," and by sing- ing of the myth of the pangs of Semele. And he tells of a youth excited by the Phrygian mode who had locked himself in a room with a harlot with plans to burn down the house, and he tells how this youth's fury was reduced to a perfect state of calm when Pythagoras played a melody in an orderly, spondaic rhythm. 10 The Fathers of the early Catholic Church re- vered spirit, reason and heaven, disdained body, fleshly passion and earth. And they associated body with woman. Philo, the first century Jew- ish philosopher, was influential in identifying the female with the material, passive, corporeal and sense-perceptible, the male with the active, rational and incorporeal." For St. Augustine (354-430), both Adam and Eve were a com- pound of spirit and corporeality, and both were capable of reason. But spirit is male and cor- poreality female, and Eve represents body rela- tive to Adam. Because the body must be subju- gated by the spirit, woman should be subjugated by man, and man must "hate in her the corrupti- ble and mortal conjugal connection, sexual in- tercourse and all that pertains to her as a wife." 12 (Augustine thought the best representative of bodily sense was the serpent. And he called Cybele a harlot mother, a mother of demons.)l3 For Leander of Seville, woman could be freed from the curse of Eve only through virginity; for the virgin "lives in manly vigor and has used virtue to give strength to her weak sex, nor has she become a slave to her body, which, by natu- ral law, should have been subservient to a man." St. Jerome (341-420) believed that "as long as woman is for birth and children, she is different from man as body is from soul. But when she wishes to serve Christ more than the world, then she will cease to be a woman and will be called a man." He counseled young women to remain virgins, and to be trained in the "angelic life" which "while in the body lives as though it were without flesh." Monks were warned in the fourth and fifth centuries that "the flesh of all women is fire," and to avoid the touch, the sight, the sound of women.14 (Caroline Walker Bynum suggests that the spiritual expressions of male and female medieval mystics were different, and this difference has something to do with the body. Women were more apt to somatize religious experi- ence and to write in intense bodily metaphors; women mystics were more likely than men to receive graphi- cally physical visions of God; both men and women were inclined to attribute to women and encourage in them intense asceticisms and ecstasies.)15 The early Church fathers advocated the sing- ing of psalms, later called plainchant. St. Basil (c. 330-379) counsels that "if somewhere one who rages like a wild beast from excessive anger falls under the spell of the psalm, he straightway departs, with the fierceness of his soul calmed by the melody. ... A psalm is the work of the angels, the ordinance of Heaven, the incense of the Spirit." And Basil recommends the psaltery (a plucked string instrument) among instruments, which "has the origins of its harmonious rhythms above, in order that we may study to seek for those things which are on high and not be drawn down by the pleasantness of the melody to the passions of the flesh." St. John Chrysostom (c. 337-407) tells us that "women, travelers, peasants and sailors" strive to lighten with a chant the labor endured in working. Much as this kind of pleasure is thoroughly innate to our mind, and lest demons introducing lascivious songs should overthrow everything, God established the psalms. ... And as swine flock together where there is a mire, but where there is aroma and incense there bees abide, so demons congregate where there</page><page sequence="5">Cox History of Music 399 are licentious chants, but where there are spiritual ones there the grace of the Spirit descends, sanctify- ing mouth and mind. John cautions that there is no need for cithara or any other instrument to accompany the psalms; "but, if you like, you may yourself become a cithara, mortifying the members of the flesh.... For when the flesh no longer lusts against the Spirit, but has submitted to its orders ... then will you create a spiritual melody." Gregory of Nyssa (c. 330-c. 395) suggests that the psalms can transport us to the stable, "pure" time of the Garden, and away from the "treadmill" of earth time since the Fall. (Plainchant is generally sung without meter, and was to be sung, according to Augustine, with a "fluent voice." Plainchant is music of the spirit. Plainchant offers a glimpse of "angelic life," enables us briefly to forget we live on the earth, that we have bodies, that we are of the flesh. Yet Augustine expressed concern that even plainchant offers sensuous pleasure, and cautions worshippers to focus on the mes- sage and not the music.) '6 Psalm singing by women was common in the early centuries of the Christian era and was praised by St. Jerome, St. Augustine, St. Zen- obi, St. Gregory of Naziana and St. Ambrose. But gradually it was determined that such prac- tices were inappropriate for public worship. Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 315-386) writes that women should recite psalms quietly, "so that their lips move, but the ears of others do not hear." Je- rome recommends that women "sing the psalms in their chambers, away from the company of men and the crowded assembly." And Isidore of Pelusium (d. c. 435) determines that: The apostles of the Lord, who wanted to put an end to idle talk in the Churches, and who were our instruc- tors in good behavior, wisely permitted women to sing psalms there. But as every divine teaching has been turned into its opposite, so this, too, has become an occasion of sin and laxity for the majority of the people. They do not feel compunction in hearing the divine hymn, but rather misuse the sweetness of melody to arouse passion ... Thus it is necessary ... that we stop these women both from singing in church, and also from loitering in the city as if they were innkeepers to Christ. 17 (Later in the twelfth century, beautiful and inno- vative plainchants were composed by the vision- ary abbess Hildegard of Bingen, who believed that "divinity is to humanity as male is to fe- male," and once wrote "I am wretched and more than wretched in my existence as a woman."9)18 Religious dances comparable to pagan rituals were performed in the first three centuries of the Church by the Theraputae, the Kollyridians, the Marianites and the Gnostics. All of these sects were influenced by the Goddess traditions, and their religious dancing was associated mainly with women. (St. John Chrysostom: "If neither girls nor married women may dance, then who will dance? No one. ")19 Negative reaction by the Church Fathers was strong. Thus St. Basil complains that women defile the shrines of mar- tyrs at the Easter vigil: These licentious women ... having cast the veils of modesty from their heads, showing contempt for God and for his angels, shamelessly in the sight of every man, shake their hair, as with wanton eye and exces- sive laughter they are driven madly to dance ... they fonn a dancing troop in the martyr's shrines before the city, making of these holy places a workshop of their characteristic indecency; they defile the air with their harlot's songs, they defile the ground with their unclean feet. There was particular concern expressed about singing, dancing and instrument-playing outside the Church, all of which was regularly deemed lascivious, pernicious and effeminate. In a sec- ond century description of Church ritual, Chris- tians are distinguished from pagans in that they "pour no blood on altars in sacrificial libations/ The tympanum sounds not nor does the cymbal,/ Nor does the much pierced aulos with its fren- zied voice,/ Nor the syrinx, bearing the likeness of a crooked serpent." Clement of Alexandria complains of "maenads who perform the unholy initiatory rite of the division of the flesh," of those "defiling themselves with dancing, drunk- enness and every sort of trash," of chromatic, pliant harmonies and the "erotic wailing of the aulos." Arnobius (d. c. 330) laments that "lasciv- ious souls abandon themselves to bizarre move- ments of the body, dancing and singing, forming rings of dancers, and ultimately raising their buttocks and hips to sway with the rippling motion of their loins." Gregory of Nazianzus (c. 329-389) offers a list of questions to ask one's</page><page sequence="6">400 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism soul, including "Do you desire the striking of hands upon barbitons and the way it excites? Do you want the breaking voices of pretty boys moving effeminately? And the indecent con- volutions of naked maidens?" St. Basil com- plains that "the more people hear lascivious and pernicious songs, which raise in their souls im- pure and voluptuous desires, the more they want to hear." The Fathers were especially disturbed by women singers and dancers, outside the Church, and it was warned that "those who delight their eyes and ears on such spectacles commit adultery." Basil tells us that a woman who plays the lyre rather than weaving "is a sorry sight for sober eyes, " and a Canon of Lao- dicea (fourth century) declares that a "woman who dances in a tavern and who entices people through pretty singing and sweet sound, which is deceitful and full of seduction, shall, if she gives up this profession, wait forty days before she communicates; then she may receive the mysteries."20 (Little is known of this music before the tenth century: songs were transmitted orally, and medieval scholars wrote little about the music itself. There are numerous reports of women singing and dancing in the late middle ages, and regular protests by the Church con- tinue. 21 The dance songs of the male and female jongleurs and troubadours are notable for their woman's voice, a voice offering invitations to love, enjoy life, and resist jealous husbands: "Ha! ha! here doth come the king! eya! What a temper he doth bring! eya! Bids us dancers break our ring! eya! Lest his lady have her fling ... Jealousy, Haaie begone/ Go we now, go we now a dancing our own way, our own way."22 Other songs of the goliards, jongleurs, trou- badours and trouveres, songs inscribed pre- dominantly by males, were of spring, nature, gambling, drinking and feasting, of morality, re- ligion and politics, but mainly of love: sensual desires, lovesickness and rejection, a lady's power. Some of these songs were misogynist, some were sexually explicit, some were respect- ful of a lady of high virtue, some idealized woman or the Virgin.23 Clerics were sometimes entertained by secular musicians; and in music as in general, it is often difficult to distinguish sacred and secular in the medieval era. Yet sec- ular music was repeatedly denounced by the Church. For the music was disturbing and excit- ing, likely to engage the body and stimulate the bodily passions. It was rhythmic, somewhat im- provisatory, moving from the Church modes toward major and minor, and often accompanied by instruments and associated with dancing.24 And the lyrics were most likely to deal with woman: woman and love, woman and sensual- ity, woman and the body.) Johann Josef Schikaneder's libretto to Mozart's Die Zauberflote is based on a "Turkish" fairy tale entitled Lulu, or The Magic Flute. In Lulu, young prince Lulu is given a magic flute by a good fairy whose daughter has been kidnapped by an evil wizard. Lulu enchants the wizard with the flute and escapes with the daughter, and the fairy then plays the flute over the wizard's castle and reduces it to nothingness. But Schikaneder and Mozart were both familiar with Classical mythology and were both loyal Freemasons, and they transformed the tale to suit their philoso- phies. (A prominent Mason once inscribed Mo- zart's autograph book with a prayer to Apollo.) The good fairy becomes the dark, evil Queen of the Night, associated with the earth and the moon, a matriarch who lives in a mountain. Her terrain is rocky and wild, and she enters from and descends into the earth accompanied by thunder and lightening. She was once married to the Priest of the Sun, and she expected that her sovereignty would descend matrilineally to their daughter Pamina. But the Priest rebels by giving the Sevenfold Circle of the Sun to Sarastro, depriving the moon-Queen of her sun, and rob- bing her of her power. (Before he dies, the Priest tells the Queen that matters of the Sun "are not accessible to your woman's spirit. Your duty is to submit yourself completely, and your daughter also, to the direction of the Wise Men.") It is Sarastro who has Pamina abducted, but he is now no evil wizard but good, wise and noble. (The "abduction is placed in the month of springtime blossoming, of the powerful renas- cence under the sign of Apollo, the solar god, and under the name of Maia [Cybele], goddess of creative nature. ") He takes Pamina in order to mate her with an initiate of the Sun Temple, and thus establish a patrilineal and patriarchal base for the integration of night and day. (In Masonic symbolism, day and night, sun and moon are symbols of the masculine and feminine respec- tively. Other Masonic dualities associated with the masculine and feminine respectively are the</page><page sequence="7">Cox History of Music 401 Egyptian deities Osiris and Isis, fire and water, gold and silver, active and passive, red and black, elucidation and discourse, bull and twins, 3 and 5. Jacques Chailly tells us that 5 is the number of the goddess Aphrodite, and repre- sents the union of the "schizogenetic" female number 2 and the "complete" male number 3.)25 This initiate is Tamino, whom we first see near the Queen's circular castle battling a ser- pent. (In the Oriental fairy tale there were lions to battle, but Schikaneder wanted lions associ- ated with Sarastro.) The serpent is subdued and cut into three pieces by three ladies armed with silver javelins, servants of the Queen. The Queen sings plaintively to Tamino of Pamina's abduc- tion, and vows that if he rescues her Pamina will be his. To aid him in his search, Tamino is given a magic flute that can charm and enchant ani- mals and people, and three boys (genii) who carry the T-square, the ruler and the compass, and represent Strength, Beauty and Wisdom. (Later we learn that the boys are allied with the Kingdom of the Sun. Some scholars have sug- gested it is incongruous for the Queen and her servants to give Tamino a magic flute whose power will later be used to defeat them. But it is fitting that the healing power of music would be associated with the powers of darkness.) Tam- ino's comic sidekick Papageno, who ordinarily plays panpipes (Waldfloten or faunenfloten) is given some magic bells which are later used to enchant Monostatos, whom Sarastro employs to kidnap Pamina. (Monostatos, a moor with "a soul as black as his face," thinks only of sex, believes "white is beautiful" and wants to rape the white woman Pamina, and is later cast into darkness with the Queen. Monostatos and Papa- geno, the two men associated with the Queen, are weak, pathetic, easily frightened. When Pa- pageno is told by Tamino to act like a man, he says he would rather be a girl.) When Tamino enters Sarastro's realm, he and Pamina undergo initiation trials. (It has been suggested that these trials are not real but are trials of the inner being. The concrete realm of the Queen would thus be opposed by the spir- itual realm of the Sun.) Tamino and Pamina are taken to a point between two mountains. One contains a red, fiery furnace, the other a water- fall surrounded by black clouds, thus uniting Masonic symbols of the masculine and femi- nine. But the feminine is maligned in various ways throughout the trials and throughout the opera. Tamino is told by Sarastro's priests not to trust women and their idle chatter, and again later to beware of woman's falsehoods and de- ceptions. Tamino then counsels Papageno that no credence is due women's babbling talk. Pam- ina is told that it is man who must guide her heart to reason, and that without his guidance woman will overstep her bounds and end in folly. A quintet consisting of Tamino, Papageno, and the three ladies sing that (unlike women), men are firm of purpose, and think before they speak. The ladies are then banished for profaning the sacred precincts of the Sun with their presence. (A Masonic constitution of 1723 limits admis- sion to "men of good reputation" and excludes "slaves, women, and immoral or disgraced men." And the padlock Papageno wears on his mouth to help him learn not to babble like women is representative of an initiation rite for female companions in which their mouths were sealed with trowels to place them on guard against the idle chatter native to their sex.)26 Although Pam- ina is initiated along with Tamino and the two will rule the Kingdom of the Sun together, the sacred marriage of sun and moon, day and night, is not a marriage of equals. It is more like the marriage of Zeus and Hera, except that unlike Hera, Pamina is "subdued by an alien conqueror." The Queen is destroyed, and Pam- ina and the powers of the night are appropriated and subordinated.27 These dynamics are powerfully enhanced by Mozart's music. The opera begins and ends in E flat major, with the three flats of E flat symboliz- ing the male principle in Masonry. The Queen sings predominantly in the minor mode, and often chromatically. Her phrases tend to be ir- regular, relatively long and complex, and her vocal lines are ornate and dramatic. Her music has a strong forward thrust rhythmically, and the full orchestral accompaniment is marked by tremolos, sfortzandos, forte-pianos, crescendos and diminuendos, and dissonant, diminished tri- ads and seventh chords. All of this makes the music brilliant and exciting, but unsettling; es- pecially in her second, D minor aria (no. 14) there is a rhythmic, harmonic and melodic insta- bility that leads us to seek resolution. The sta- bility and resolution we crave is best found in the music of Sarastro and his priests, who sing</page><page sequence="8">402 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism predominantly in C and F major. (Rita Steblin tells us that in Die Zauberflote, as in Haydn's Creation, C major is the key of light, understand- ing and intellectual enlightenment.)28 Sarastro and his priests sing diatonically, often with per- fect four bar phrases, a predominance of winds, conventional chord progressions, simple melo- dies and accompaniments and regular rhythms. There is little or no rhythmic or harmonic thrust, giving the music a static quality, and a sense of peace, balance, order and control. (Bruno Nettl describes Sarastro's music, with its "lofty arches of melody, large intervals, serious song-like melodies reminiscent of the old choral music, quiet simple rhythms" as "humanist. ")29 Tamino's first aria, in E flat major, is chro- matic and ornate when he sings of love. But as he learns the principles of the Kingdom of the Sun, his music becomes diatonic, stately, reg- ular. This tendency to conform musically, to move musically from instability and darkness to clarity and light, is also evident in the music of Pamina. In the one aria Pamina sings alone (in G minor, the original key of the Queen) her music is minor, chromatic, dissonant, florid, and rhyth- mically complex. (The postlude to this aria, an aria in which Pamina expresses her fear that she has lost Tamino, mixes sextuple and triple meters, probably representing Pamina's frustra- tion and confusion.) When she sings with men, in contrast, and especially when her initiation is complete, her music is major and diatonic, with regular phrases and rhythms. Pamina's conver- sion is best illustrated in the music for her initia- tion. Weak-willed and fearful, her music is ini- tially highly chromatic, predominantly in G minor, and with long complex phrases, wide leaps and dissonances. Yet as she is advised and reassured by the three boys and gradually comes to see the light, the music moves to a simple, diatonic E flat major. (The move from darkness to light in the opera is captured in a microcosm in the Overture. After the three opening chords in E flat major, the Adagio is characterized by tonal instability and a Sturm und Drang style, while the ensuing Allegro is clear, square and pre- dominantly diatonic.) The ultimate resolution of the opera comes when the Queen and her attendants are banished once and for all into the night. Accompanied by forte diminished seventh chords in the orchestra and thunder and lightning on stage, the forces of darkness cry out "Destroyed forever is our power" to the consecutive tones of a diminished seventh, and disappear into the earth. The music gradually moves to B flat major and then to E flat major for the final hymn of thanks and praise to Isis and Osiris. The stage, says Schikaneder's directions, is transformed into a sun. And rapt listeners and spectators have been provided with the dramatic and musical resolution they have wanted, consciously or unconsciously, ever since the first appearance of the Queen. Women are life's music. -Richard Wagner30 Wagner's Tannhauser was based principally on the sixteenth century legend of the medieval minnesinger Tanhauser or Danhduser, and on the legend of the song contest of minnesingers at the Wartburg. Wagner knew the Renaissance legend and various nineteenth century versions of Tann- hauser, in which the medieval knight Tannhauser seeks redemption from the Pope after having partaken of the sensual delights of Venus (Aph- rodite), the goddess of love.31 The Pope tells Tannhauser that he will not be forgiven unless the dry twig or staff he holds in his hand sprouts green leaves; later the twig actually sprouts, but Tannhauser has returned to Venus's mountain and cannot be found. (In the legend and in Wagner's opera, Venus lives in a mountain.) The Wartburg legend, which contains no mention of Tannhduser, includes the story of the virtuous Elizabeth, daughter of the King of Hungary, who performed miracles and became a saint. Combining the two legends, Wagner's opera focuses on the tension Tannhduser feels between his desire for Venus and his love for the chaste maiden Elizabeth. (Wagner's character of Eliz- abeth was also inspired by Carlo Dolci's "Ma- donna," which he saw at the Aussig parish church.) Though Tannhauser is based mainly on German legend, however, it also reflects Wag- ner's avid interest and thorough knowledge of Greek mythology. (Wagner writes at the time that "after it had overcome the raw religion of its Asiatic birth-place, built upon the nature- forces of the earth ... the Grecian spirit, at the flowering time of its art and polity, found its fullest expression in the god Apollo, the head and national deity of the Hellenic race. It was</page><page sequence="9">Cox History of Music 403 Apollo,-he who had slain the Python, the drag on of chaos; ... it was this Apollo who was the fulfiller of the will of Zeus upon the Grecian earth." And Wagner tells us that the story of Lohengrin, in which Elsa loses Lohengrin by asking him to reveal his identity, is based on the myth of Zeus and Semele.)32 Wagner's Tannhauser begins in a womb-like cavern inside the Venusberg. (Wagner originally planned to title the opera Der Venusberg. Wag- ner's conception of Venus's mountain was loosely based on the German legend of the HMrselberg, where the devil and his witches live amid flames and howls of the damned.) The Venusberg is ruled by the goddess of love, and is rife with sirens, Bacchantes, naiads, nymphs, satyrs, fauns, cupids, graces and youths. The light is dim and rosy and the air is permeated by a blue vapor. Naiads are bathing in a lake, sirens are reclining on its banks. Venus is reclining on a couch, surrounded by cupids, and Tannhauser kneels before her, his harp in his hand and his head on her lap. Nymphs, Bacchantes, satyrs and fauns dance a wild dance which escalates into frenzy, and induces Tannhauser and Venus to embrace passionately. But Tannhauser sud- denly awakens as if from a dream, and sings that he is weary of continuous pleasure, misses the sunlight, longs to return to the sufferings and joys of the world of men. Venus expresses anger, then uses all of her wiles to keep Tannhauser with her; she reminds him that with her, he is part of the divine. Yet Tannhauser is relentless, and with condemnations and warnings, is at last allowed to leave. Without changing his position, Tannhauser suddenly finds himself in the bright light of day, and is touched by the sight of a shrine to the Virgin and by the song of a young shepherd. Tannhiuser's fellow minnesingers are happy to see him again, and invite him to participate in a song contest. The chaste maiden Elizabeth, whom all of the minnesingers worship from afar, is overoyed to see him. In Tannhiuser's absence her heart was closed to joy and song, but now she looks forward to hearing Tannhauser per- form. Unfortunately for Tannhduser, the contest songs are minnesongs, songs of love, and he cannot resist singing that none of the other min- nesingers could possibly know what love is un- less they have experienced the delights of Venus. The assembly reacts to this revelation with revul- sion, and swords are drawn to punish Tannhau- ser for his sins. But Elizabeth, though crushed, loves Tannhauser and shields him with her body. This action by such a pure maiden is taken as a sign from heaven, and it is decided that Tann- hauser should be taken to Rome to seek for- giveness from the Pope. The Pope tells Tann- hauser forgiveness will come only when his staff sprouts, and the wretched Tannhduser plans to return to the Venusberg. He beckons Venus with his song, and is about to melt into her arms when one of Tannhduser's fellow minnesingers cries out the name of Elizabeth. On the very mention of Elizabeth's name, Venus and her attendants are defeated and disappear. For Elizabeth is now an angel, has prayed herself to death, has died praying to the Virgin for Tannhduser's redemp- tion. Tannhauser praises Elizabeth, and amidst songs of pilgrims, dies himself; and because of Elizabeth's prayers, because of Elizabeth's death, he enters eternal bliss, not the cyclical sexual bliss of Venus but the pure, stable bliss of heaven. 33 (In an earlier opera, the Flying Dutch- man is also redeemed through the death of a loving and faithful woman. And Wagner writes of "a Woman who, of very love, shall sacrifice herself' for man. She is "the longed-for, the dreamt-of, the infinitely womanly Woman-let me out with it in one word: the Woman of the Future. ")34 The music of Venus and the Venusburg is highly chromatic. (Catherine Clement has pointed out that in Wagner, chromaticism is associated with pain, anguish and death, but also with feminine sexuality. And because feminine sexuality is regarded as both highly attractive and odorous, wonderful and stinking, chromaticism is excit- ing yet stinking, suggestive of a feminine stink. 35 And I remember that Boethius considered chro- maticism to be effeminate, and that chromat- icism was associated with love, pain and death in the Italian madrigals of the late sixteenth cen- tury.) The music is beautiful, often square and in the major mode, sometimes diatonic. But melody and harmony are entangled, rhythms are irregular, and the music is spiced and intensified with diminished triads and sevenths, disso- nances, deceptive cadences, tonal ambiguity, and chromatic melody and harmony.36 (This tonal instability is also suggested in the opening music of the sirens, who first sing a sweet, radiant triad, but move to a harsh dissonance and then to</page><page sequence="10">404 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism a diminished seventh chord that never seems to resolve.) The music is further intensified by a predominance of third relations, moves to har- monies a third away rather than regular, stable, I-II/IV-V-I progressions. And although the music is beautiful, it seems never to achieve closure, never to rest. (Tannhauser describes this quality of continuous beauty, continuous unrest in his song of praise to Venus in the song contest, sings of a fountain of love that rekindles desire as soon as it quenches it, that provides eternal longing and eternal bliss. And in the opening scene on the Venusberg, it is only in Tannhauser's songs of praise that the music achieves any stability or resolution. Venus is a musical nymphomaniac, and only Tannhauser can satisfy her desire.) Although the music of Tannhauser himself on the Venusberg is more regular and more likely to satisfy expectations, complete resolution is found only when he leaves the Venusberg, leaves cry- ing "Goddess of all delights, not with thee shall my soul find its peace! My salvation lies in Mary!" The word "Mary" is accompanied by a major triad, fortissimo in the full orchestra, upon which Venus and her attendants disappear. The music of Elizabeth, in contrast to that of Venus, is clean, square, diatonic. When Eliz- abeth's name is first mentioned, what has been chromatic, dissonant music suddenly resolves to a second inversion major triad, with sustained winds and harp. Her music is best exemplified by her prayer to the Virgin, a predominantly diatonic prayer in perfect four bar phrases, with regular progressions, and accompanied by winds and brasses only (no lush strings) playing pure, clear triads. Only when Elizabeth sings of earthly longing does the melody line become predomi- nantly chromatic: "O take me from this earth! Let me enter pure and spotless, into thy blessed kingdom! ... if ever a sinful desire or earthly longing rose within me, I strove with untold anguish to stifle it in my heart!"37 (Elizabeth longs to become pure spirit, and she is close to pure spirit even when on earth. Elizabeth seems only barely to have a body, has no feminine stink, no Phrygian odor. Wagner writes that "In Tannhauser I had yearned to flee a world of frivolous and repellent sensuousness ... my im- pulse lay towards the unknown land of pure and chaste virginity." He writes at about the same time that "the most perfect human body" is "that of the male. ")38 The final resolution of the opera comes after Venus and her Bacchantes return to reclaim Tann- hauser. Venus is calling for her lover to return to her, dancing figures are whirling around her, Tannhauser is about to give in, and his friend Wolfram is horrified, urging Tannhauser not to submit. At the point of greatest intensity, when Venus is singing "Come, oh come" on a dimin- ished chord, Wolfram suddenly invokes the name of Elizabeth. Once again the name of a virgin is accompanied by a second inversion triad, for- tissimo, in the full orchestra, and once again Venus is defeated and is swallowed up by the earth. Venus's blue vapors dissolve and morning dawns. 39 (This long awaited resolution is similar to the ones when the Queen is destroyed in the Magic Flute and the stage is bathed in light, and when Senta dies in The Flying Dutchman and the stage is bathed in light, and when the highly sexual and highly chromatic Isolde dies in Tris- tan and Isolde, and when the highly sexual and highly chromatic Kundry dies in Parsifal, and the highly sexual, highly chromatic Carmen dies in Carmen, and when the highly sexual, highly chromatic Delilah and her people are destroyed in Samson and Delilah. And I know that these moments of resolution bring a profound release, are the most compelling moments in the operas.) I believe that Wagner found the feminine to be very attractive, and this is why he treats it with some of his most beautiful and exciting music, but at the same time that he found female power and female sexuality terrifying, unsettling, and that this is why the beautiful and exciting music is also disturbing. Nietzsche once described his feelings for women as Hass-Liebe, a term that refers to loving and hating a woman at the same time.40 Wagner clearly had feelings of Hass- Liebe for women as well, feelings that are evident not only in his libretti but that are reinforced by his music.41 And this musical reinforcement is particularly powerful expressly because we are not likely to be fully conscious of it. I am dis- turbed (and seduced) by the sexual or powerful woman because I am disturbed (and seduced) by her sexual or powerful music. And because I want her disturbing music to be resolved, I am likely, on some level, to want the woman to be appropriated, to be defeated, to die.42 Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones ("the great- est rock &amp; roll band in history") can combine</page><page sequence="11">Cox History of Music 405 music and lyrics of mastery with a persona that is curiously passive. Slight and feminine in ap- pearance, wearing flowers in his hair and sing- ing of "Crushed Flowers" (poppies), prone to dancing and orgasmic and ecstatic experiences, Jagger can recall the ancient vegetation god. Yet his message in songs such as "Some Girls," "Stupid Girl," and "Under My Thumb," is decidedly patriarchal, exudes Hass-Liebe, ex- udes Hass. In "Under My Thumb," Jagger re- counts his conquest of a once dominant woman: Under my thumb/ The girl who once had me down/ Under my thumb/ The girl who once pushed me around ... Under my thumb/ She's a squirming dog who's just had her day ... Under my thumb/ She's a Siamese cat of a girl/ Under my thumb/ She's the sweetest pet in the world ... Under my thumb/ Her eyes are just kept to herself/ Under my thumb/ Well, I can still look at someone else ... The change has come she's under my thumb. (The song ends with short, stabbing breaths that sound like quick thrusts and Mick saying "Easy, baby, take it easy baby." According to Simon Frith and Angela McRobbie, rock music groups such as the Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart, Bruce Springsteen, and especially heavy metal groups such as Iron Maiden, Motley Crue and Twisted Sister, are all examples of "cock rock." Cock rock performers tend to be "aggressive, dominat- ing, boastful, and constantly seeking to remind their audience of their powers, their control." At the same time, cock rock often expresses a deep, even pathological fear of women, carrying "mes- sages of male self-doubt and self-pity to accom- pany its confidence and aggression. ")43 Yet many young women love this music, and they idolize Jagger, and while developing a course in rock music I become attracted to some of the cock music myself. Songs I particularly like by the Stones are "Let's Spend the Night To- gether," and "Paint It Black" and "She Was Hot." All of these songs seem about to burst with energy, and they engage the body, give rise to movement and the dance. (Robert Palmer tells us that "The Stones's backbeat has long been the most resilient in rock. It makes some people shiver, but others [like the more than two million paying fans on the band's 1981 American tour alone] hear it and dance for joy. In Africa and in the African-derived cultures of the Americas, the same rhythms that Christians fear as voodoo, the Devil's work, are used by priests and sha- mans to heal wounds and cure sickness, to bring light and balance to diseased minds and peace and prosperity to entire communities. ")44 "Paint It Black" is about darkness and death, and has a quick, exciting beat but is in the minor mode and includes the exotic sound of the sitar. And what I like about "She Was Hot" are the chord progres- sions in the chorus, But she was hot as she kissed my mouth/ She was hot as I wiped her brow/ She was hot, she pinned me to the ground/ She was quick, she knew her way around/ She was hot and tore my clothes/ She was hot, she had no place to go/ She was hot on a cold and rainy night. The song is in G major, but the chorus begins on a C major triad, then moves to and lingers on an E minor triad, then to a D major chord, the dominant of G, but instead of moving to G it moves to an A minor triad, then back to C for a repeat of the progression. And I realize that I love the third relations, the moves from C to E, from A to C. (And I remember how I love the third relations in Wagner's love music, and in the love songs of Richard Strauss.) And I especially like "Let's Spend the Night Together," a song that is an aggressive seduction, a subtle rape. And as the woman is seduced (My my my my/ Don't you worry 'bout what's on your mind, oh my/ I'm in no hurry I can take my time, oh my/ I'm growing red and my tongues getting tired ... I feel so strong that I can't disguise oh my/ But I just can't apologize, oh my/ Don't hang me up and let me down/ We could have fun just fooling around ... you need some guidance baby/ I can provide it here and now ... I'll satisfy your every need/ And now I know you will satisfy me/ Let's Spend the Night Together/ Now I need you more than ever/ Let's Spend the Night Together now oh my my my my my), melody and phrase seem never to rest, and a progression is played over and over that begins on the subdominant (G major), moves to the submediant (B minor) and then to the tonic (D major). Yet the tonic doesn't feel like the tonic, it feels like the dominant of G, and the progres- sion seems never to resolve. And I am reminded that music that is nonlinear and nongoal-directed and continuous has been associated with feminine</page><page sequence="12">406 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism sexuality, a sexuality that can be regarded as both attractive and dangerous. But here the lack of resolution is especially reflective of mascu- line desire and frustration. And this suggests that the dominant-tonic "masculine" cadence is an iconic sign of the masculine climax, of mas- culine mastery. For there is no lack of closure in "Under My Thumb;" the song ends, with its quick breaths and its "Take it Easy, Baby," with a clear, strong resolution in the tonic, and holds the tonic chord for several measures.45 I came to realize that these musical messages are ubiquitous and continuous, and cannot be avoided completely. And yet I don't want to stop listening to Gregorian chant, to Mozart, to Wag- ner. One reason I continue to listen is that I don't want to be deprived of the great beauty. But I also continue to listen because I want to make conscious what the music has been whispering to me, I want to expose the music's hidden implications to light and air. (And in wanting to shed light I do not mean to demean darkness; for Starhawk tells us the dark is "the power of the unseen, the power that comes from within, the power of the immanent Goddess who lies coiled in the heart of every cell of every living thing, who is the spark of every nerve and the life of every breath." But when darkness is used against us, we must confront, enter and trans- form it.)46 For though I still love music that denigrates women, though I am still inclined to dance to misogynist music of popular culture, I hope to heal my fractured self, this self that loves songs that hurt me, and to dance to the music of women, music that will help me feel good about my body and my emotions, and to dance like a Maenad, like a Bacchante. I'm just beginning to think about these things, not having discussed them with my students, when one of my graduate students approaches me after class, a demurely dressed young woman with curly brown hair pulled back in barrettes, a young woman who has said on the first day of class that the most important thing in her life is Jesus, and she wants to know if there's been any research done on the effects of the minor mode on sexuality. She says the minor mode turns her on. RENEE COX Department of Music 308 Fine Arts Center University of Tennessee Chattanooga, TN 37403 1.

The Maiden represents potential, is independent and woman-centered; the Mother represents abundance, is giv- ing and nurturing; the Crone represents the destruction which enables the cycle to begin again, and is wise and powerful.

Jane Ellen Harrison, Mythology (New York: Cooper Square, 1963), p. 95. 4. According to W.K.C. Guthrie, the names of the vari- ous Cretan goddesses may once have been names for various aspects of a single Great Goddess: The names of the Cretan heroines or nymphs Pasiphae ('all-shin- ing'), Ariadne ('very holy' or 'very visible'), Phaedra ('bright'), Dictynna ('she of Mount Dicte'), Britomartis (... 'good' or 'sweet maiden' in the Cretan tongue) ... are all adjectives, and suggest that the Greeks, with their genius for concreteness and personification, may have made separate personalities out of invocations to a single great Cretan goddess or god in different capacities. (As in Phrygia, the principal deity in Crete was a Goddess.) See Guthrie, "The Religion and Mythology of the Greeks" in The Cambridge Ancient History, 3rd ed., eds. I.E.S. Edwards, C.J. Gadd, N.G.L. Hammond and E. Sollberger (Cambridge University Press, 1975), vol. II, pt. 2, p. 884. The following revelation of Isis from the Metamorphoses of Apuleius (second century C.E.) also suggests that various Great Goddesses are One: The Phrygians, first born of men, call me the Mother of the Gods, goddess of Pessinus; the inhabitants of Attica, Minerva of Cecrops's city [=Athens]; the Cypriots living amid the seas, Venus of Paphos; the arrow-bearing Cretans, Diana of Dictynna; the triple tongued Sicilians, Proserpina of the Styx; the original Eleusinians, Ceres of Attica, some [call me] Juno, others Bellona, some Hecate, others the One from Rhamnus. Note that the list includes Goddess as Maiden (Proserpina, Diana), Mother (Venus, Ceres, Juno), and Crone (Hecate). Quoted in M.J.

Quoted in The Music of the Troubadours, p. 145. The lady in the more respectful songs is sometimes more ideal than real; because she is often not identified by name, and because many songs explicitly praise the Virgin Mary, it has been suggested that some of this music may fuse worship of the Virgin with expressions of sensual desire. (This eroticization of the Virgin also appears in writings of some clerics. The treatment of the Virgin and the lady in the German minnesong is more mystical, less sensual.) Rose- mary Radford Ruether tells us that Mariology began to emerge in the fourth century C.E. "This new praise of Mary, as the epitome all of these images of spiritual wom- anhood, soon succeeded in restoring to Mary the ancient titles of Queen of Heaven and Mother of God of the ancient Mediterranean Earth Goddess, crowning her with the moon and the stars of Isis, the turret crown of Magna Mater [Cybele], ... rededicating ancient temples of these Earth goddesses to Mary, and finally escorting her to the very Throne of God to take her seat beside the Jewish Ancient of Days and his son Messiah." Unlike that of the Goddess, however, Mary's body was pure and unrelated to earthly femaleness, and her idealization probably served to intensify the carnality of ordinary women. See Ruether, Religion and Sexism, p. 179. 24. Secular monophony is often performed in modal rhythm, with a regular beat pattern; many contemporary scholars believe the rhythms were more lax, conditioned by the texts, and varied from performance to performance.

After printing a letter from Wagner to his new young housekeeper (known only as "Mariechen") in which Wagner specifies that she should have her "pink panties" ready for his return home, Sabor points out that the letter was written a week after Wagner and future wife Cosima had "vowed to belong to none but one another." But Sabor cautions that "this is not a matter of fidelity or infidelity, but of needs which are nor- mally disavowed but which Wagner blithely acknowledges.

Wagner also tells us that his ideas about "the whole significance of the drama and of the theatre" were moulded by the Orestia of Aeschylus, a drama that juxtaposes the light of Dike (Justice), represented by Zeus's thunderbolt, with the "tragic nightmare" of Argos, Clytemnestra's city-state. See Ray- mond Prior, "Language and the Credibility of Space: Wag- ner's Symbolic Dependence on Aeschylus" in Wagner In Retrospect, eds. Leroy R. Shaw, Nancy R. Cirillo, and Marion S. Miller (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1987), pp. 19-2 1. Thomas Mann has suggested, however, that in the later music drama Tristan und Isolde, Wagner celebrates the cult of the night: The pronounced ascendancy of the day's "more lovely half," the night, is achetypally, quintessentially Romantic; in this, Romanticism is closely allied to the whole mythical complex of mother-moon cults, which have always been contrasted, since the beginnings of civiliza- tion, with sun worship, the religion of light as the male-paternal element; and it is within the general orbit of this world that Wagner's Tristan is firmly located. See Mann, Pro and Contra Wagner, pp. 126-127. 33. It has been suggested that Venus and Elizabeth should be played by the same woman, that together they make the complete woman. And it has been suggested that in the character of Brunhilde, the sensual and spiritual woman are integrated. But in Wagner's swansong Parsifal, woman and sexual love are renounced, agape replaces eros, and agape is only for men. For woman, now Kundry, is pure sensuality: not the golden sensuality of Venus, but the sensuality of shame. Kundry's "garment is wild and looped up high; she wears a girdle of snakeskins the long ends of which hang down: her hair is black and falls in loose locks: her complex- ion is a deep reddish brown: her eyes are black and piercing, sometimes flashing wildly, but more often fixed in a stare like that of the dead." On Kundry, see Ernest Newman, The Wagner Operas, p. 676. 34. Richard Wagner's Prose Works vol. I, p. 308. On Tannhauser, see Newman, The Wagner Operas; Barry Mil- lington, Wagner (London: J.M.

The Venusberg music was revised for the Paris Opera during Wagner's Tristan period. Ernst Bloch called the Ven- usberg music a "masterpiece of lust." See Martin Gregor- Dellin, Richard Wagner, trans. J. Maxwell Brownjohn (San Diego: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1983), p. 301. 37. Adorno and others believe, nevertheless, that Eliz- abeth has some sympathy with Tannhiuser's hedonism. See Theodor Adorno, In Search of Wagner, trans. Rodney Liv- ingstone (London: NLB, 1981), p. 14. 38. Richard Wagner's Prose Works vol. I, pp. 339 and 167. Adorno points out that for Wagner, sensual pleasure and desire are confounded with sickness, and that the "har- mony" achieved in his mature work between the two main tendencies of the Tannhauser period-"unrestrained sexu- ality and the ideal of asceticism"-is a harmony that inevita- bly leads to death. See Adorno, In Search of Wagner, pp. 14, 92-94. 39. The unacceptable woman is now destroyed through the actions of a good woman rather than the actions of men. (And today, among those most disapproving of "whores" or other unacceptable women are the nice women, the ladies. And I read in the Oxford English Dictionary that "nice" is from the Latin "nescius," "to be ignorant.") 40. See H.G. Schenk, The Mind of the European Roman- tics (New York: Anchor Books, 1969), p. 240. Psychologists tell us that male ambivalence about women, and women's ambivalence about themselves, begins early in life. For the mother, in offering her breast and the warmth of her body and the music of her voice, offers the first sensual delights. And yet the mother has great power and can take the breast away or withhold the breast or leave the child alone or seem to prefer the father. And these dynamics are particularly powerful for little boys, for they, in having to develop a different gender identity than the mother, must sever their connection with her sooner and more completely than little girls. Because they want her but can no longer be part of her, they seek to possess her, to have her warmth and comfort and sensual delights for themselves alone. And because female sexuality and female power must be kept in check in order for the female to be possessed, men come to dominate and objectify women.

Wagner's feelings for his own mother (see above, note 40) were deeply ambivalent. He once wrote to her that he was so overwhelmed by your feelings of gratitude for your glorious love for your child, which you lately showed again with such warmth and affection, that I should dearly like to write and talk of it to you in the fondest tones of a lover to his beloved. Ah, but far more than that, for is not the love of one's mother far more-far more unsullied than any other? Elsewhere Wagner complained of his mother's "unprin- cipled behavior," her "propensity for distortion, misrepre- sentation and gossip," her stinginess, selfishness and malice. See Gregor-Dellin, Richard Wagner, pp. 23-24, 115-116. 42. Along these same lines, see McClary, "Sexual Pol- itics in Classical Music." I am indebted to McClary for sending me this manuscript. The musical dynamics described in these operas are still with us in contemporary film. In Adrian Lyne's film Fatal Attraction (Paramount, 1987), Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) has an affair with flashy, sexy, independent and successful Alex Rogers (Glenn Close), an affair which threatens his relationships with his loving and stable wife Beth (Anne Archer) and young daughter Ellen (Ellen Har- rison). When Dan rejects Alex, she is disturbed, begins harassing Dan and his family, and eventually becomes homi- cidal, attempting to kill Beth and Dan. The music associated with wife, daughter and home is peaceful, lyrical and con- ventional, using traditional modes of melody, harmony and structure. Alex's music, in contrast, is almost totally unsta- ble: there is no melody, harmony, phrase or structure to ground the listener, only a low, dull roar, usually synthesized and initially barely audible, which increases in intensity as Alex becomes more agitated. Alex's music does not lend itself to conscious awareness, but it is nonetheless unset- tling, and by the end of the movie when she attempts to stab Beth, it is extremely disturbing. The musical tension is resolved only after Alex is shot and killed by Beth, and we hear the "home and family" music as Dan is reunited with Beth and Ellen. Essentially the same musical dynamics are presented in Walt Disney films targeted at girls and young women. In Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, and most recently The Little Mermaid, a sweet and passive heroine (who is neither responsible for the trouble she's in nor capable of getting herself out of it) is pitted against an antagonist who is dark, powerful, usually attractive and sexy, and always female. In stark contrast to the music associated with the heroine and her Prince, the music of the femme fatale antag- onist is minor, dissonant and unstable, and resolves only when the Prince kills or destroys her, enabling the heroine to enter the world of men. (We want the antagonist to die because she is a witch, because she uses her great and often magical power destructively. But I notice that the antagonists usually feel alienated, excluded, or afraid of abandonment. And I remember that Alex becomes destructive when she is rejected, that the Queen of the Night becomes destructive when her power is taken from her, that Kubile becomes a castrator when she is appropriated by the patriarchy, that the wise and powerful Lilith becomes destructive when she is cast out of the Garden, that the isolation of the wise and powerful Erinyes fuels their vengeance, that the wise and powerful Crone aspect of the Goddess can become self- destructive when separated from the Mother and Maiden. And I want to respect and include the Crone in others, and to integrate the Crone, Mother and Maiden within myself.) 43.

In the two most well-known Stones songs about frus- tration, "Satisfaction" and "You Can't Always Get What You Want," the subdominant is regularly alternated with the tonic, denying the dominant-tonic cadence needed for com- plete resolution. "Let's Spend the Night Together" is from the album Flowers (London Records); "Paint It Black," "Stupid Girl" and "Under My Thumb" from Aftermath (RCA); and "She Was Hot" from Under Cover (Rolling Stones Records). Cock rock is most characteristic of Stew- art's, Springsteen's and Jagger's work in the 1960s and 1970s. The recent "Blinded By Love" from Steel Wheels (Rolling Stones Records), however, shows that misogyny is still alive and well in the Stones.
