Some animals that survive reappear in subsequent stories. This is a children's book, asserted for grades 7 through 9. By empirical in- vestigation, I found that, read aloud, it is a little old for a bright four-year old, and about right for a bright seven-year old (forgive parental vaunting). The stories are well written with occasional spurts of really fine prose. The emphasis is on the food chain of the bayou, and since this eats that continually it is not a book for children reared on the insipid anthropomorphism of Walt Disney animal stories. The stories are amazingly factual, and give a good portrait of animal mor- phology, behavior and ecology. The illustrations are generally quite excellent, but there is one bad mistake. On pages 82-83 the painting ostensibly depicts the female spadefoot coming to mate with the calling male of her species, but someone gave the artist the wrong photograph to copy for the male. Instead of being a spadefoot, with a vertical pupil (which the text correctly says characterizes these amphibians from all other American anurans), the male is in fact a Bufo toad, complete with horizontal pupils, parotid glands, warty skin and brown coloration! My only real complaint is the tremendous overemphasis on predator-prey relations in this excellent volume. Emphasis might have been spread among courtship, feeding by herbivores, protection from the elements, reproduction, growing up of the young and such things. On the whole, though, this is a book the likes of which we need more of.-Jack P. Hailman. BOOKS AND MONOGRAPHS 53. Peregrine Falcon Populations: Their Biology and Decline. Joseph J. Hickey (editor). 1969. Univ. of Wisc. Press, Madison. 596 pp. $10.00 - Once in a great while some ornithological volume becomes a classic even before we can review it. This book is an example. A conference was organized in mnid- 1965 to assess the status of Falco peregrinus; in a moment the results of that conference. Nearly every corner of the globe once had as either a breeding or winter resident one or another of the forms of the peregrine (the specific status of some forms is still under study). Not only is it world-wide, but also as handsome a bird as one could ask for. It may also be the fastest flier in the world. And now it has become the very symbol of man's destruction of his environment and the beauty it holds. I remember the first peregrine I ever saw: he was sitting on the now defunct Willard Hotel, two blocks from the White House in Washington, D. C. I suppose he did his share of cropping the pigeons and starlings that so plague the nation's capital. My elder son has seen a peregrine, but the younger one may never. This book documents why. There are five principal parts, following an introduction by Hickey and Anderson: status and trends of the populations, population trends in other reptors, behavior and ecology of raptors, population ecology, and a roundtable summing up and discussion of the results and problems. Although every effort was made to dissect out the entire complex of causes contributing to the pere- grine's decline, the blame clearly rests primarily with biocides. This book is not just an ecological horror story, albeit it is that in part. It is also one of the finest studies of a species of any kind of living organism. It is also a photographic study of beauty, which includes Arthur Allen's famous picture of a peregrine at Taughannock Falls, N. Y. - which perhaps rates as one of the finest photographs ever taken of a bird. And it is a book about basic and applied science. The transcript of discussions demonstrates the inquiring, probing nature of scientific minds interacting in a way that no summary could ever convey. Hickey opens the volume with; several quotes, among them this from Matthew Stevenson (1660): ". . . I confesse them somewhat out of my Road, but I assure you to pleasure you and satisfie myself, I have consulted the most approved Authors and given you here the creame and marrow of their severall experiences in their own expresse characters."-Jack P. Hailman. 54. A Paddling of Ducks. S. Dillon Ripley. 1969. Smithsonian Institu- tion Press, Washington, D. C. 256 pp. $5.95. - We note briefly the reprinting of</page><page sequence="2">334] Recent Literature Bird-Banding the 1957 book published by Harcourt-Brace, in the event that you missed it the first time around. It is a personal account of Ripley's quest to learn about and conserve the world's waterfowl. It includes accounts of his travels and the build- ing of his famous collection of waterfowl in Connecticut. Of special interest to me was the recalling of his development of interest in birds, and participation in the successful effort to restore the Wood Duck as a regular member of the avifauna. The many drawings by Francis Lee Jaques are of the usual excellent quality. The volume was penned well prior to Ripley's becomning Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and one hopes that he will upon retirement give us an equally personal and informnative account of world conservation efforts from the viewpoint of one in great authority.-Jack P. Hailman. 55. How to Attract, House &amp; Feed Birds. Walter E. Schutz. 1970. Bruce Publishing Co., N. Y. 196 pp. $7.95.- When getting this book first re- move and dispose of the dust jacket and then tear out the first 40 pages. What remains is well worth owning. The dust cover is a photograph of a chickadee so washed with red that his cap is maroon. The typography in this book gives the impression of 1940 vintage, which wasn't a particularly good year, and the photo- graphs throughout are nearly uniformly lousy. Th:e first 40 pages are essentially fill-material about bird watching as a hobby. Do not mistake me, I object not to the subject matter, but to the execution. Such matter can be either enchanting or informative (rarely both); here it is neither. A table about the food of birds is credited to the Agriculture Department in the text and to the Interior Depart- ment in the title, but in neither place can one get the exact source. Most of the photographs look as if they might have been taken by Matthew Brady, and I'm convinced the one of wild turkeys is a fraud, though I can't prove the birds are stuffed. The section on "equipment needed" spends eight lines telling you nothing about binoculars, when it could briefly recommend center focus, coated optics and about seven power as a starter for bird watching. The sketches of species (pp 23-30) add a humerous touch: ever see a peewee with a spike-like upturned bill, or a junco with a tail longer than body plus head? Not convinced? How about evidence of the hasty paste job? On page 14 the author asserts "In another part of this book I pointed out the difference between Ornithology and Bird Watching" (caps his). That "other part" is page 13 (bot- tom) and the previous paragraphs on page 14. Or how about the last page of text (p. 194): "TG help you in identifying birds by their song, as suggested on page 000, you can .. ."? On page 38 the author talks about leaving town for several weeks and finding the birds were no longer coming to his empty feeder when he returned. (They were probably dead.) And counting seems to be a problem: '. . . use the six-syllable word and name yourself an 'ornithology' society." (p. 39). So save yourself confusion and agony by beginning on page 41. The first section of meat is plantings that attract birds: trees, shrubs, vines and ground cover. The next is on food and how to prepare it, with many excellent tidbits. Then comes building of bird feeders, and the author is really in his element. The feeders are attractive, and each is explained by a blueprint, photograph, bill of materials and a text. How to provide water follows (including a section on dust for dust bathing!) Lastly comnes housing, as clever and clear as the section on feeders. The pictures and text tell you how to take apart an orange crate to use the wood (It's not as easy as some th;ink), how to saw correctly, etc. At the end there are some lists: wildlife conservation organizations (called "agencies" al- though none is governmental), references (in which only the last name of the senior author plus an abbreviated title is given, which may create problems) and lastly a list of periodicals (yes, Bird-Banding is there). If this book sounds vaguely familiar, it may be because you read the first edition, entitled How to Build Birdhouses and Feeders (1955). Or perhaps you saw the second edition, called Bird Watching, Housing and Feeding (1963). (The word "and" was spelled out in previous titles.) Any guesses as to the title for the next edition? - Jack P. Hailman. 56. The Birds of Tikal. (Las Aves de Tikal). Frank B. Smiithe. 1969. Asociacion Tikal, Guatemala City, Guatemala. 376 pp. paperback. $3.00 (In Spanish) - This is a Spanish edition of a 1966 book (not seen). It is a pocket- sized field guide, in th;e "Peterson-style" with arrows pointing out key identifica- tion features on the color plates of birds that live in an area of central Guatemala.</page></plain_text>
