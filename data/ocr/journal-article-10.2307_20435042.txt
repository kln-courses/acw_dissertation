Tf Bams 73 A 36ritz,3J5 4ltaeiratl Iatiofl 3tetrturt ON MINOR ENDOCRINE DISTURBANCES AND THEIR MIETABOLIC AND PSYCHlCAL EFJE GTS.* BY W. LANGDON BROWN, M.A., M.D.CANTAB., F.R.C.P., PHYSICIAN, ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S HOSPITAL. THE last decade of the nineteenth century added greatly to ouir knowledge of the physiology of the ductless glanids, while in 1902 Bayliss and Starling's discovery of secretin opened out the vista of a chemical control of the body, in which the nervous system merely acted as a trigger, firing off a series of reactions. This conception was elaborated until it bade fair to dethrone the nervous system from its supreme position, although Langley had already provided the antidote by his generalization that the action of adrena line on any part was the same as that obtained by stimu lating the sympathetic. But the far-reaching significance of that generalization was not yet appreciated. " The key to evolution lies in the continuous development of the 'nervous system," said Gaskell. Or, as Elliot Smith put it: "Man has developed and become the greatest of the primates because of his faithful dependence upon the de velopment of the brain." Considering the struggle the central nervous system has had to obtain control, it is not likely that it would abdicate its suzerainty in favour of the more ancient dynasty of chemotropism. We ordinarily think of the evolution of the nervous system as peacefully accomplished. A struggle for supremacy between two animals or between two species we recognize. But it would appear that a similar struggle accompanies the integration of the multicellular ifidividual. Many apparently peaceful events in nature prove on closer analvsis to involve a concealed struggle. Man is a gre garious animal, but he has not found it an easy task to adjust the desires of the individual to the needs of the community. Philosophers may lament this, theologians may attribute it to original sin, but it should lead the biologist to inquire whether the cells of which he is composed have always found it easy to sink their individuality in that of the organism. The thesis of a hostile symbiosis between the tissues of the body has been skilfully upheld by Morley Roberts. A strong central government is needed to keep order, and no high degree of differentiation is possible in the animal body without the control of a centralized niervous system, which has gradually acquired an increasing predominance. It is not too much to say that this control, though for the benefit of the body as a whole, may be resented by the individual tissues. Wilfred Trotter de veloped the argument of a hostility between nervous and somatic tissues, which is expressed in the way the former insulates itself. Without defensive mechanisms no animal can survive in the struggle for existence, and no method of defence remains impenetrable, for, if it were, the species possessing it wouild multiply to the exclusion of others. As evolution proceeds the apparatus for defence comes under the control of a central nervous system. Some defenwive mechanisms, such as nettle cells, never become so controlled, but are replaced by other methods as the nervous system evolves. Certain primitive motor apparatus, such as cilia, also never come under such control, though they persist even in the hiighest animals. In general terms, a central nervous system enables very rapid reactions to occur, and the n-eed for suCh rapidity of response will first be experienced in the struggle for existence, when its advantage is at once manifest. G. H. Parker, in his book on The Elementary Nervouls SyJstem, has brought new observations inltO re latlionlship with previously known facts, and has impressed upon us afresh that a nervous system starts as a series of independent receptors and effectors in the deeper layers of the skin, the cells of whiclh sink in deeper and deeper, until they become concentrated inito a central nervous system. Between the receptor and effector an adjustor mechanism develops, which is the germ of the whole associative appa ratus. In the vertebrates these internuncial adjustor neurons compose the chief mass of the" central organs. It is not too fanciful-to compare the origin of the lnervous system to a group of settlers oni the coast, who gradually invade the interior, first singly and then in an organized army, as in the nervous system of vertebrates which arises as a tubular invagination from the surface. Once estab lished the invader assumes 'control over the indigenous in habitants, fortifying itself as it goes and maintaining its protectorate by a system of rapid communication through out the invaded areas. The biological and sociological parallel is remarkably 'complete. - A wise military occupation utilizes existing institutionis, and the, lowest level of the nervous' system-that is, the autonomic or vegetative portion-enteis into a close associa tion with the older chemicial methods of control. In nmv former lectures1 2 I have emphasized the fact that the endocrines which represent the specialization of these older chemical methods reveal their antiquity in the way they cling to vestigial structures. Indeed, with the exception of the pineal, these structuires 'would appear to be homo logous, and can all be traced 'to modified nephridia.3 In the course of evolution structuril alterations have made thel useless for their primitive exeretory function and they have taken on a new function of internal secretion. Circum stances alter function. Thus we have hand in hand (1) an increasing concentration of the government in the hands of the central nervous system; (2) an increasing concentra tion of endocrine functions in glands -which can no longer discharge their primitive functionis. I have also recalled the fact that the autonomic, vege tative, or visceral nervous system consists of two great divisions-the sympathetic and the parasympathetic or extended vagus. The former is katabolic, eonverting potemi tial energy into kinetic and facilitating outfWard manifesta tions of that energy, while the latter is anabolic, directing energy inwards, where it is stored up. Whebn these two are distributed to the same structure their aetion is always antagonistic, and when one is stimulated 'the other is inhibited. Each of 'tliese great divisions cooperates with a group of, endoc ine 'glands-the sympathptic with the adrenals, thyroid, and pituitary; the parasymi'pathetic witlh the glands of' the digestive organs and annexes. This is explicable 'since tlhe former group are largely defensive, while the iatteI 'are concerned with obtaining energy from the food. The sympathetic' is defensive not only against the external foe, but also against internal invasion by bacteria. Fever is 'a defensive mechanism largely colitrolled by the sympathetic through the ductless glands associated with it. This explains why (1) patients with endocrine defects stand infections badly; (2) inifections may lead to endocrine exhaustion. The endocrines are important regulators of metabo'ism. If metabolism is quickened up, hyperglycaemia usually re sults. This excess of sugar in the blood is normally used either to supply energy to the muscles or as a source of heat for tlhe febrile reaction. Glycosuria does not neces sarily result, for there are two factors concerned in this -the amount of sugar in the blood and the threshold of the kidney. In fever this threshold is raised, so that the sugar poured into the blood by the thyroid, pituitary, and adrenals is prevented from escapiing before it can be utilized. This is not only the case in fever, but whenever activity of the endocrine glands associated with the sympathetic is exaggerated. Thus in hyperthyroidism I have always found a hligher percentage of sugar in time blood even if 'there is no glycosuria, and it is well known that the basal metabolism-that is, the metabolism per unit sulface of the resting, fasting body-is increased. - ~~OBESITY. If metabolism is slowed dow-n fat and muncinoid matersial is deposited. Obesity is due to alterationl in time balanlce between anabolism and katabolism. TIme commonest cause is taking more food or less exercise than the body requires, [3284] *A British Medical Association Lecture (with revisions) delivered before the South Essex Division of the Association at Southend-on-Sea on Friday, November 10th, 1922. |</page><page sequence="2">!074 Dua.-8, I923] MINOR -NDOCRINE- DISTURBANCES. 1074DEa 8 -1921 Rua"JvW_ but this is not the whole story. Recent studies in basal metabolism show that it is lower in adults than in children, and in women than in men. It gradually diminishes with each decade. It is profoundly influenced by the endocrine glands, particularly the thyioid. A slowing down of basal metabolism means an increase of weight even though the intake of food is by no means excessive. It was clear during the food rationing of the war that a certain number of stout people did not lose weight as others did. In thyroid obesity the increase in weight is not all due to fat. The heavy folds runninig from the nose to the cheeks, the bags under the eyes, and the supraclavicular pads are all very characteristic. The condition is really a minor degree of myxoedema, and presents a similar harsh dry skin with a malar flush. The mental lethargy is as marked as the physical. In pituitary obesity the whole face is rounded, with a smooth, soft skin, while the colour is usually fresh or unduly high. I called it the " Dutch doll " type, and then found Fearnside had previously referred to it as the "pudding face." The amount of hair on the face and body is much reduced. Fat is specially deposited on the shoulders, breasts, hips, and thighs, giving the latter a "plus fours" appearance. The skin over the posterior borders of the upper arms and on the legs below the knees is a mottled red. The way this mottling stops abruptly just above the olecranon is very characteristic. These people bruise very easily and there is some polycythaemia. In women there is often amenorrhoea; but that is not the cause of the polycythaemia, as I found it in a typical case in a boy 'of 16. The mental -outlook is often bright, active, and cheerful. In Dercum's disease there are localized deposits of fat which are painful-they are particularly likely to occur on the posterior borders of the arms and the flexor aspects of the thighs. Here the mental condition is usually one of great depression, which is not merely due to the pain of the lumps, although this may be considerable. In some cases of pituitary tumour there is both an Insatiable appetite and great sleepiness; the patient awakes to eat, and having eaten falls asleep- again. It is not easy to be sure what determines the bright alertness of -one group of fat hypopituitarism and the profound somno lence of the other, but I suspect it depends on whether there is increased intracranial pressure or not. -The fat boy in Pickwick-" Drat that boy, he's asleep again ! " is usually quoted as a classical example. A few years ago a very fat Jew, weighing 20 it., turned up at St. Bar tholomew's Hospital at 11 p.m. complaining that he felt very sleepy. Fortunately he had a doctor's card with him, otherwise I cannot help thinking that a fat Jew complain ing of sleepiness at 11 o'clock at night might have received more advice than treatment. It was a-good thing he was admitted, for he had a syncopal attack soon afterwards. X-ray examination showed enlargement of his pituitary fossa. Under injections of 1/2 c.cm. of pituitrin three times a day he lost 2 st. in ten days and his general con dition improved remarkably. Quite recently I advised two daily doses' of 1/2 c.cm. in a similar case, with the result that 171 lb. were lost in twelve days. Thymic Obesity.-The thymus is an infantile organ; if it persists after it should- have vanished we find it is antagon istic to the development of the gonads, and hence indirectly leads to the deposit of fat. The thymic type tends to have rather a long face, with clear skin and good features, marred by the precocious development of a double chin. It constitutes the lymphatic type of the older physicians, or status lymphaticus- as we prefer to call it to-day. Such patients are liable to paroxysmal dyspnoea, the so-called thymic asthma, and they respond to infections badly. Gonadal Obesity.-Recently I saw a girl of 22 who was very stout, and who presented some features of the pitui tary and thymic type, and even some signs of thyroid deficiency. I noted that her upper lateral incisors were very small. 'She was surprised when I guessed that her periods began late. The guess was correct, for they did not start until she wvas 16k. One or bothi undevelopod upper lateral incisors are often associated with gonadal deficiency, and, her obesity showing signs of several endocrine glands being implicated, it appeared to me probable that this was due to some common factor rather than to disease of each of these glands, of which, indeed, -there was no other evidence. Now the ,gonads stimulate the thyroid and pituitary while antagonizing the thymus, so that it seemed to me- the probable starting point of the -obesity was gonadal de ficiency. Indeed, I think that pathological obesity in early life, showing mixed endocrine symptoms, is very often due to delay in gonadal development. It may subside quite rapidly when adolescence is complete. To hark back for a moment to the undeveloped lateral incisors. If you see a girl with more than the usual enlargement of the thyroid at puberty together with this condition of the teeth, you are, in my opinion, justified in regarding the enlargement as probably compensatory and not of evil import. Her periods may establish themselves with difficulty, but the enlargement of the thyroid is likely to subside when this has been done. The process may be hastened by small doses of -thyroid extract. Curiously enough, this association be tween the teeth and gonads appears to be a crossed one. Thus -with an undescended right testis it will be the left lateral incisor which is small, twisted, or displaced. THE ADRENALS. Having considered, some of the effects of the endocrine glands on general metabolism, I will turn to some other results of minor disturbances of these glands, with some reference to the psychical aspects. it is clearly recognized that the medulla of the adrenals really represents the post-ganglionic element of the sympa thetic nervous system, which explains Langley's generaliza tion,- to which I have already. referred. The chromaffin cell and the sympathetio cell migrated out of the central nervous system together, and the chromaffin elements were originally much more widely distributed. The cortex, on the other hand, represents a group of nephridia, and still arises from the Wolffian body. It is very significant that.it has the same origin as the interstitial cells of the gonads. To this we may trace the extraordinary effect that cortical tumours or overgrowth have in producing premature sexual development. In whichever sex they occur they tend to virilism. We shall see that each of the different endocrines has its own tendency to tip the balance towards virilism or feminism. What the advantage may be of this close association of two structures of such widely different origin we cannot say, but the persistence of the association in all animals above the level of fishes suggests that it is of great importance. Apparently, if this association fails to occur in foetal life the brain remains at the fish stage, the neopallium does not develop, and. an. anencephalic. monster results. Since adrenaline can raise blood pressure and excite glycosuria, it is tempting to assume. that these combiaed symptoms occurring in later life are due to overactiol of the: adrenal medulla, . produced by nervous strain of an emotional sort. But proof of this is lacking., The classical picture of underaction of the adrenal medulla is seen in Addison's disease, and.it is possible that adrenal exhaustion may play a part in. war neuroses and other functional states characterized by myasthenia, vasomotor instability, and low blood pressure. I should like to say a few words on the psychical aspect of adrenal -disturbances. Fear is really a perversion of a defensive mechanism. It is the intensification of the instino tive process called into activity by danger. But just as wO cannot conceive that all the primitive sensations of a lower animal have the affective intensity of pain as we experienoa it, so we must not regard the emotional response of an animal to danger as having the affect of what we mean by fear. To do so would be to fall into the common error, as Parker says, of interpreting the activities of the simpler animals as though they were miniature human beings. The much scantier associative mechanisms in the nervous system of lower animals precludes such an idea. An imaginative writer, A. C. Benso n, says: " It is strange- to note the perpetual instinctive consciousness of danger which besets birds in the open; they must live in a tension of nervous watchfulness which would depress a humanl</page><page sequence="3">DEc. 8, xg23 MINOR ENDOCRINE DISTURBANCES. - r TMDBJr 1075 being into melancholia ... Do we realize what it must be to live, as even sheltered birds do, in a quiet garden, with the fear of attack and death hanging over them from morning to night? The best answer to this anthropomorphic view is that the behaviour of birds gives no suggestion of their being depressed into melancholia. Doubtless when the appropriate miotor response is prevented the lower animal can feel both pain and fear; but that all its sensations and emotions are thus coloured is most improbable when we consider the much simpler structure of its nervous system. It might be argued, on the other hand, that as sensations of fear at once arise when the inhibiting mechanism is in abeyance as in night terrors, in the induction of anaesthesia, or in exhaustion states-fear must be a primitive emotion of great strength and universally present in lower forms of life. But I would urge that it is only in the stage when the associative mechanisms have been evolved, and before these liave been controlled by the higher levels, that this is the case; or as Carpenter puts it, " Fear only became a mental stimulus at the time of, or after the evolution of, self consciousness." The behaviour of savages supports this view. Fear-whether of evil spirits, of magic, of the dark -panic fear dominated primitive man, and whenever our resistance is lowered by disease, by shock, or by psychic conflict, we betray our ancestry. That strange primitive being which lurks in the unconscious mind of us all peeps out. Elaboration of ceremonial and ritual is the first step taken by primitive man to counteract this; all religions pass through the " God-fearing " stage. Then with the hiigher development of the mind, and the recognition of the reality principle, comes release from such obsessions of fear. In the disintegrative process of disease this higher control fails and phobias develop which cannot be effec tually exorcised by the ritual of a compulsion neurosis. The adrenal medulla from its activating effect on the sympathetic is a fighting gland. And as the adrenal cortex tends to virilism, the owner of a well developed pair of adrenals is pugnacious and masculine in type, with plenty of drive, not to say aggression. If the adrenals are in defect we see a weakening of all these characteristics, with a tendency for the vagus to get the upper hand, which may precipitate such things as asthma. If the adrenals are in excess we find a liability to anxiety neurosis, and to phobias of all kinds. In such an individual the dominant emotion is fear. Tim PITUITARY. That overaction of the anterior lobe produces acromegaly in adults is well known. It is also generally recognized that some lesion of this lobe plays a large part in the osteitis deformans of later life. Overaction of this lobe in early life,when general growth is still possible produces gigantism. Miujor degrees of increased action of the anterior lobe results in a tall hairy man, long in tooth and big in jaw, With large broad hands. He often has a good intellect, with an imaginative force which can be controlled and brought to the service of his active brain; he is often miiusical-in short, a practical visionary. Unfortunately the effect of an overactive anterior lobe is not always so balanced as to produce such a happy result. Thus in the following case the. amount of pituitary disturbance was not great, though the effect on character was disastrous. A young man of 23 was brought to see me who had been very late m learning to walk and talk. He showed me two photographs of himself taken at the age of 4 or 5; one of these looked like a normal child, while the other looked degenerate. By the age of 6i he had developed the habit of lying. He grew rapidly to the height of 6 ft. 5 in. His palatal arch was very high, and his knuckles were very large. He was a confirmed liar and thief, and was suspected of deliberate and wilful arson. Gigantism due to overaction of the anterior lobe before, the epiphyses are united may be followed by degeneration of the gland. The fossa becoming too small for the gland the patient is apt to develop moral and intellectual inferiority, to suffer from compulsions and obsessions, and to lack inhibitions. As Berman puts it, such individuals are "pathological liars with little or no initiative or con science. . .. As children they lie and steal, have enuresis, have poor control over themselves and a low lear ning capacity." This patient showed all these.points. But it is a little difficult to explain wvhy even while the pituitary was actively stimulating growth there was a failure of the moral sense and intellect to develop. In the present state of our knowledge we can only say that there may have been a diversion of the pituitary action in one direction at the expense of others. Dr. Crichton Miller has suggested to me that it is rather due to failure on the part of other endocrine glands. In connexion with Berman's view that the posterior lobe is concerned with the affections, it is interesting to note that this youth had never shown the slightest affection for anyone. It had been suggested that he should be certified as of unsound mind. On that I wrote to his doctor as follows-and it happened to be just a fort.. night before Ronald True's case: "We are up against the difficulty which always arises between the medical and legal view of responsibility. I think that in spite of his plausible manner with strangers he has a criminal type of countenance; and I should never be surprised at his doing something to justify that harsh saying. But the law which gives the dog one free bite would certamly not allow him to be deprived of his liberty." The sufferer from pituitary disturbances seems to com pensate for his feeling of inferiority by craving for the limelight. The craving of the " fat boy in Pickwickl" was to make peoples " flesh creep." The pars intermedia of the pituitary, which is develop mentally part of the anterior-lobe, is concerned with carbo hydrate metabolism. If it overacts there is excess of sugar in the blood and sometimes frank glycosuria; if it under acts the blood sugar is low and carbohydrate tolerance is high-no doubt this plays a part in the obesity of hypo pituitarism. When the anterior lobe with the pars intermedia is in defect we have Frihlich's syndrome-an abnormally fat patient, with little hair, smooth skin, and undeveloped sexually; in fact, an extreme degree of the type of pituitary obesity I have already described. It has been said that the anterior lobe tends to produce virile characters, and the posterior lobe feminine charac ters. The flat-chested, long-toothed, large-jawed, clumsy handed woman, fondly believed by the French caricaturists to be typically English, is certainly suggestive of an exag gerated anterior pituitary, and she is not remarkable for feminine characteristics. A little side issue of some interest occurs to me here: you are all familiar with the inseparable couple of women friends; one of the two usually adopts a somewhat masculine role, and I have.been struck on several occasions to note the number of signs she presents of over active anterior pituitary. Be that as it may, I am sure the pituitary plays some part in differentiating the secondary sexual characters. We are on safer ground in asserting that the secretion of the posterior lobe stimulates plain muscle and is often found to be an excellent stimulant in a certain type of atonic constipation. I am convinced, too, that diabetes insipidus is generally due to defective action of the posterior lobe. Clinical and pathological evidence strongly supports this view, and injections of pituitrin will control polyuria. Apparently this-is due to direct action on the kidney; but I must not stop to discuss this point. Several recent observations have thrown considerable light on the influence of the pituitary on carbohydrate meta bolism. Thus, Mackenzie Wallis' has found the blood sugar curve to be the sanme in ,pituitary glycosuria and the glycosuria of pregnancy; Dixon has shown that ovarian extract increases the secretion of pituitrin into the cerebro spinal fluid$; while J. H. Burn has found that pituitary extract will inhibit the action of insulin in reducing the blood sugar. Therefore, in the glycosuria of pregnancy the gonads apparently stimulate the pituitary, which in turn inhibits the pancreas. THE THRonD. The thyroid is essentially a feminine gland, and it is developed from the uterus of the paleostracan anlcestor. Its enlargement at puberty, marriage, and pregnancy, and' its tendency to involution at the menopause, all point that way. It has been called the gland-of creation. Some time ago Crichton M{iller asked if anyone had ever heard of 'a</page><page sequence="4">1o76 DEC. 8, I923] MINOR ENDOCRINE DISTURBANCK86 myxoedematous artist. Tredgold replied by citing a cretin in Zurich in the eighteenth century who whs an artist of some repute. But possibly he was really only an achoudro plasic. Crichton Miller has returned to his point, and asks for ca-ses of subthyroidic creators-be it of works of art or of children. It is, of course, true that a subthyroidic woman may have children after she has had thyroid treat ment. Crichton Miller further maintains that child-bearing and.artistic creation are mutually exclusive, the storehouse of creative energy being unable to cope with both kinds of creation; and I think that though we can find apparent exceptions to this rule, it is very rare for both kinds of creation to be possible simultaneously. I went so fully into the question of the factors in hyperthyroidism in a previous lecture that I need only recall them briefly now. Various toxic influences may excite a reaction in the thyroid gland; of these, tonsillar and intestinal sepsis seem to be the most important, though others may play a part. Thus in a recent case the hyperthyroidism was much ameliorated by removal of septic teeth, but septic tonsils were apparently responsible for an intermittent auricular fibrillation which came on soon after this, and which could not be controlled by quinidine. But more and more I am imn pressed with the influence of emotion in eausing Graves's disease, which is readily comprehensible in view of the sympathetic.innervation of the gland. This is particularly likely to happen if the distressing emotion has a matrti monial origin, while it naturally adds considerably to the difficulty in detecting the cause, as this is not usually a matter of advertisement. I had the opportunity of wa:tel ing the case of an unmarried lady who was entrusted with the care of her nieoe between the ages of 4 and 17. Thle girl's parents were Anglo-Indiails7 and when she grew up they sent for lher to go back to Iiidia. The aunt was greatly distressed; her wlhole emotionial life appeared to cenitr e round the girl, and witlhin six weeks of ler departure the aunt, who had reached an age which precluded her from having children of her own, developed marked Gravess' disease. Fear is another emotion which has a milarke'd in fluence in exciting hypelrtllyroidism, as was well slso1Vn during the air raids on London. The air raids were almo.st an " acid test " of race. An uncontrollable iimipulse to flight from London or into the tubes was almost diagnostic of Semitic origin. More self-co-ntrolled people, wlho never theless suffered acutely, repressed their impulses from tlho motor to the vegetative level, and received their reward in hyperthyroidism, amounting in some cases to Graves's disease. That stimuldtion of tlhe thyioid should normli;ally be followed by vigorous action is slhown by the way it pro duces excess of sugar in the blood, even though there iiiay be no glycosuria. I have nothing fresh to say about minor degrees of hypo thyroidism, but I should like to reiterate my belief in the importance of the disappearance of the outer half of the eyebrows as an indication of this condition and of the fre quency with which "'rheumatic" pains are experienced by sufferers from it. Once' the suspicion of hypothyroidism is aroused its detection and treatment are not difficult. The following case presents points of more intelest: A boy, the only child -of a widow, lhad an attack of subacuto rheumatism. Following this he grew very fat and completely paraplegic., He had been in this state for a year when I saw bin. His appearance suggested hypopituitarism, but though not quite 14 signs of puberty were well' developed. A skiagra n showed a normal pituitary fossa. There wero no signs of organic nervous disease. I came to the conclusion that the rheumatic poison had damaged his thyroid gland, and that while, pain had for a time made movement difficult,' the existing paraplegia was functional. Separation from his mother, adminisitration of thiyroid, massage, and re-educaticn exercises led to a complete cure- with loss of hlis obesity. The psychic effect of hypotliyroidism is interesting be cause it is by no means uniform. The commnonest re.sult is a stato which has been called " resigned melanclolv," buit sometimes the mental attitude is one of suspicioni, whliel may result in delusions, and occasionally leads to acute mania. This iS surprising in a- disease usually chlaracterized by lethargy. My experiencee is that mania in myxoedemla should not deter us from giving thlyroid extract. THE PARATHYROIDS. Most observers are now agreed that the parathyroids have separate functions from the thyroid. Their two recog nized actions are (1) to destroy guanidine, a purin body which otherwise accumulates in the muscles, where it ip believed to cause tetany; (2) to increase the ionizable calcium content of the blood. The first effect has beeli riecently used by Vines to estimate the activity of pre parations claimed to contain parathyroid secretion, an'd the second has been proved by the same obsFerver by direct estimation of the calcium in the blood. Applying these facts to clinical observation Grove and Vines0 found in the case of lesions which could be watched, such as a varicose ulcer on the leg, that calcium was an important factor in their healing, that parathyroid extract was capable of influencing calcium metabolism, raising a defi ciency in it to normal, and that with a normal calcium content healing speedily occurred. They then applied this method to internal lesions such as gastric or duodenal ulcer, with similar results. They believe that calcium deficiency is an index of the absorption of a toxin', anid that in all the various diseases improved by parathyroid therapy the common factor is sepsis. It is suggested that tho benefit is derived from a stimulation of the leucocytes, since the pol"morph count rises, probably from an indirect effect of calcium on the blood plasma. THE THYMUS. As already stated, the activity of this gland is normallv limited to the infantile period. It appears to act as a brake on the development of sexual maturity, presumablv in the initerests of somatic development. Since no internal secretion has been obtained from the thymus it is not easv to see at present how it antagonizes the gonads. Possibly this is achieved through its influence on the structure of the blood, for the appearance -of the adult blood pictule and the disappearance of the thymus are usually simul taneous. While the thymus exists the characteristic blood reaction is lymphocytosis, and it is only during this perio(l that we meet with the condition known as pseudo leukaemia, oir " splenic anlaemia of children," whicl is probably merely the reaction of infantile blood to various severe toxaemias. In status lymphaticus the enlargement of the thymus is simply a part of a general adenoid enlargement. It may be that this is a sign of an abnormal sensitivity to foreign proteins, which is a characteristic of those whose vagul response is exaggerated. This would account for the liability to dyspnoea, syncope, and anaphylactic shock associated with status lymphaticus. When the adult blood picture is reached this lymphocytic reaction is replaced by a leucopenia in anapliylactic shock. THE PANCREAS. Both the external and internal secretions of this glanA are anabolic in their effect, The external one prepares all the foodstuffs for absorption; the internal one is niow proved to lead to the utilization of sugar by the tissues. It is the special merit of Banting's work that he has beeni able to isolate the active principle of this long-suspected and long-sought-for inlternal secretioni. It would appear to act by changing glucose into another form, y glucose, in whiclh it can be used. When it is absent or diminished, more or less of the sugar in the blood remains in a nion assimiiilable form and is bounid sooner or later to be excreted into the urine. How soon it appeals will depend oni tho response of the kidney, which tenids to raise its threshold when there is excess of sugar in the blood, thus allowingz a loniger time foir the diminished pancreatic internal secre tion to act. This internal secretion, insulin, is not con fined to the pancreas. It is probably widely spread, anid certainly appears to be present in yeast at a particular phase of its life cycle (Winter and Smith). This is nlot the place to discuss the therapeutic use of insulin, but it is already- cleal that it lowers blood sugar, diminishes ksetosis, and raises the respiratory quotient. All these are3 differ ent aspects of the same actionl. By conlver ting glucose illtO a form- in which it canl be used it naturally p erevents its accumulation inl the blood. It is of gr eati</page><page sequence="5">DEC. 8, 19231 IIINTS FROM THE OLD PHYSICIANS. M Tcz BBJomxwi 1077 interest to observe that the avidity of the tissues for this form of glucose is so pronounced that an overdose of insulin leaves insufficient sugar in the blood for immediate needs. Too little blood sugar is more disastrous than too much; the former immediately produces acute symptoms; the latter is compatible with fair liealth for years. The effect of insulini on ketosis is very marked, for even on a rigi(l protein and fat diet the diabetic may show no reactioni for diacetic acid in the urine-aiiotlher evidence of the oxidizing power of y glucose. The rise in the respiratory quotient inevitably follows the more comiiplete utilizationi of carbolhydrate. I may r emark that while tlle discovery of insulin conm pletely proves that the cell-islets of the panlcreas form an initernal secretion which promotes the assimilation of sugar, it does not prove that all diabetes is due to a palnereatic lesion. The fact that pituitary extract caii anitagoniize iinsulin provides new support for the view that diabetes imiay be due to a more profound and suibtle distulrbance of metabolism than a lesion of one glanid. Swale Vincent has reminided us that organotller-apy is ofteni employed without any rational sanction. As he says, it would be difficult to mentioni a drug wlhich is clearly anid beyond doubt of value in the treatment of disease and Yet wlhiclh possesses no known pharmaco-dylnamical effects. Yet many of the extracts in common use have niot been slhowni to have any such action. Even some of those which do, caninot be satisfactorily used in substitu-tion therapy. The early triumphs of thyroid medication tended to blind us to the difficulties surrounding the use of other glandular extracts in therapeutics. Yet the thyroid is exceptional in containing a definite reservoir of secretion and, by virtue of its duct originally opening inito the alimentary canal, retaining the power of having its secretion absorbed by that route. It is perhaps fortuniiate that miiany of the preparations inl use are inert, for otlierwise damiiage miglit be done. Thus the inijection of secretiin by liberating an active pancreatic secretioni may produce digestioln of the initestinie. It is just as well, therefore, that organo tlherapy lags behind endocrinology. But I feel sure that Swale Viiicent, wlhile rightly demandinig molre exact experi mental methods in or-ganotherapy, ri-eaches too agnostic a position witlh regard to endocriniology. Her e the careful stuidy aind compar-ison of abnormnal types by clinical metlhods itiay- be of con)siderable lhelp. To that stuidy I lhope somrle of the foregoing observationis may contribuLte.
