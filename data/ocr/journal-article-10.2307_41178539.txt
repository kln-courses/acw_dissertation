A Disposable Crotchet or Two Tt is common knowledge, and it may be the case, that the post-modern theological age has dawned. Does this mean that liberalism and the great reactions to it have been super- seded? If so, by what? I do not intend here to deal with such questions in their generality. Rather, I wish to peck away at one or two particularities. And the first of these is the fate of History once posited and glorified as the paramount reality for theology. Thus History became the exclusively valid medium of divine revelation. This was as true for the critics of liber- alism, such as the Niebuhrs and Barth, as for the liberal theologians. The theological supremacy of History in liberalism was partly an effect of the powerful assault of Enlightenment thinkers on natural theology. But the hegemony of History was immensely reinforced by Hegel's apotheosis of it whereby it is infinitely more than the medium of revelation: History is the self-media- tion of Divine Reality. Some factions of liberals did not suc- cumb to this metaphysical magnificence. The Personalists, for Julian N. Hartt is William Kenan Professor Emeritus of Religious Studies at the University of Virginia. His publication include Theological Method and Im- agination (1978), The Critique of Modernity (editor and contributor, 1986), and "The Church and Changing American Values" in American Values Projected Abroad (1983).

But no more than the Hegelians were they inclined to endow Nature with rights equal to those of History. Indeed on this matter the Hegelians had something of an advantage inso- far as they endowed Nature with an inherently important place in the fascinating endeavor of Spirit to realize itself, coming, of course, first to its senses. What happened in the great critiques of liberalism to unseat History as the prime subject/substance of theology? Nothing at all. Heilsgeschichte reinforced the grip of History upon the theological imagination. The turn to historical relativism, as in H. Richard Niebuhr, had a similar effect. Furthermore, the post-liberal assault upon the idea of Pro- gress did not threaten the dominance of History. Naive histori- cal optimism was of course shattered by world wars and the Holocaust. But the Weltschmerz virus was a lively presence in British and Continental culture before the advent of the "cen- tury of total war" (Aron). Moreover the hope for Progress in- spired by the popularity of Spencer's philosophy could not be coherently connected with Darwinism. Peter Bowler, historian of science, says: . . . Darwin's attempt to reconcile his theory with progressionism must count as a betrayal of his most important insights. He had pioneered an idea that had the potential to undermine the popu- lar faith in progress, but he was unable to sustain its implications when discussing the more emotional topic of human evolution. {The Non-Darwinian Revolution, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988, 144). In more general terms Bowler says: Western culture as a whole seems to have reached a crossroads at the beginning of the twentieth century. Americans and Europeans alike suddenly found themselves doubting the moral foundations they had used to support their domination of both the physical world and the rest of the human species. They could no longer be sure that nature intended them to rule the world, nor could they trust the rational thought-processes that had once seemed to guarantee their superiority. (187) So the World was not waiting for theologians to produce a negative evaluation of Progress or proffer decisive discredita- tions of the liberal worldview. But I wonder whether post-lib- eral and now post-modern theologians have taken seriously the weighty role of science in the devaluation of liberalism's cur-</page><page sequence="3">Concerning God and Man 669 rency. We have to recognize that liberalism was kindly dis- posed towards science. It had invested enormous intellectual- emotional capital in reconciling scientific advances, such as Evolution, with Christian theism and the kernel of culture-tran- scending truth found in the New Testament and in Old Testa- ment prophecy. Moreover, liberal theologians had proved their oneness with the spirit of modernity in rejecting supernat- uralistic-dualistic doctrines of man's transcendence of nature. But on the other hand liberalism banked heavily on a philo- sophical anthropology in which man emerges as the historical subject (agent) for whom nature is hardly more than an envi- ronment handsomely attuned to his use and enjoyment. Sci- ence undermined this illusory concord by producing a systematic situating of human being in a nature stripped of every teleological overlay. True, science left an element of pre- cious singularity in human beings: man's special place in "the scheme of things entire" is as scientist High culture honors other vocations as well, notably that of the artist, the creator of imaginational "worlds": forms and textures whose values do not spring from verifiable match-ups with the real world. The scientist has no reason for denying that the Beautiful and the Good are immensely important idealities for the enhancement of human life. And that is their function, that is their "reality." But isn't there something wrong-headed, perhaps perverse, in trying to use these idealities to decipher nature's signals? That question is hardly decipherable for liberalism. Astounding technological spin-offs of science have over- whelmingly confirmed the naturalistic-naturalizing thrust of scientific thought. The technological revolution has made it nearly inevitable for us to believe that for every real problem there is a technical-technological solution. In the marketplace of the real world know-how brings much fatter rewards than the employment of wisdom, whatever that was. One can hardly minimize the strains and traumas inflicted on psyche and society by these developments. We expect that sci- entific-rational solutions to existential problems and moral di- lemmas will ride roughshod over traditional moral sensibilities. We expect that the cost-benefit analysis of social policy will dis- miss as subjective every principle except economic ones: what else does "cost" mean? Ah, yes, moral tradition insists that a</page><page sequence="4">670 SOUNDINGS Julian N Hartt dollar value cannot be put on human life. Public policy engi- neers insist that they have no rational alternative to that. Thus the cost-benefit implementation of the Social Contract licenses 'hit men' just as surely as the Mafia. The important difference is that the victims of the former are picked at random. What are theologians to make of a situation in which scien- tific representations of nature and their practico-technological derivatives constitute the dominant cultural reality? Turning again to metaphysics is not a wildly attractive option even though the Process theologians are still in the trenches when they are not out in No Man's Land. Hauerwas and Maclntyre focus on the interconnections of Story and Community, claim- ing that the salvation of theology is in there somewhere. As for that development it might not be too wide of the mark to note that while the Red Sea plays a role in the Exodus, the founda- tional story of Israel, it neither evinces nor inspires an interest in hydrography. Rather more seriously, how are our own reli- gious narratives supposed to relate to scientific explanations of human being? It seems only yesterday that liberals and their critics alike were looking for salvation to the philosophy of sym- bolic forms, hoping therein to learn what (low) rank order to assign to Science as a symbol-system. Now while Deconstruc- tion promises to dissolve reality into language, the sciences make successful forays into remote parts of the galaxy we call home, and come ever closer to cracking the genetic (= bio- chemical) code of all life, including human. Thereafter the step into full-scale genetic engineering of/for human life will be a short one, if the story of science and technology in the modern world provides any clues to the future. A marriage of genetics and astrophysics, each implemented with the requisite technol- ogies, leaves us with the question whether the colonizers of other planets in this galaxy will be creatures we should be proud and pleased to call our descendants. That such a mar- riage will occur seems at the moment inevitable. Can we count on post-modern theologians to tell us on which side of the aisle we ought to sit? That is, if we are invited to the wedding. So it is not too hard to understand why we should be hearing now and then that theologians must get to work on Nature, at long last. But how and where to start? Perhaps with Creation. Isn't there an opening wedge in, say, the Big Bang hypothesis?</page><page sequence="5">Concerning God and Man 671 James Gustafson stands out in this picture as a unique and powerful figure. He does not lament the passing of History from the theological center-stage; History does not have a sin- gly entry in the index of either volume of Ethics from a Theocentric Perspective. He does not turn to Nature to find there a second- best, an afterthought. It is too soon to say that on his terms we either ascend to God via Nature or we fail to apprehend au- thentic Deity. Gustafson's stress on the cognitional primacy of experience does not at all prejudice a fair acknowledgment of science (the sciences) as the imperial model of veridical knowledge of na- ture and of human being. The methods and the employment of conceptual schematisms and the canons of verifiability in the sciences have transformed every intelligible map of reality. So the time has come for religious thinkers and moralists to ac- knowledge in good faith this immense achievement. In Gustaf- son's view, to do so does not entail jettisoning the traditional stories and symbols of religious communities. If I may put the contention in terms he doesn't use, what religious life in the scientific-technological age must do is accept verisimilitude as the arch-canon in the truth-appraisal of its stories and symbols. Do they "ring true" in and for the history and ongoing life of the community? Are they efficacious media for the transmutation of "private" and so far ineffable feelings into "public" emo- tions expressing and consolidating the unitive life of the com- munity? The canon of verisimilitude clearly draws far more heavily on the affectional dimensions of experience than scien- tific canons and processes of truth-making. In this way and to this extent the life of the creative spirit, its poetic enterprise, is incomparably more concrete than the deliverances of science. For Gustafson, this means that more than an intersubjective verification of religious meaning is required. Given that the di- vine intention or cosmic drift is towards diversification-in-unity, then religious belief and story and symbol are false if they cre- ate and apotheosize divisions in the body of mankind and reify distinctions that do not exist in the real (natural) order. Or if in their symbols and codes and credos religious communities claim absolute (God-given) rights to impose parochial systems of order (unity) upon the whole body of humankind.</page><page sequence="6">672 SOUNDINGS Julian N Hartt Thus for Gustafson universalization is an important ethical- religious principle; but it must be rightly used. Religious affec- tions and moral sensibilities ought to relate us affirmatively and creatively to universals in human experience and to universals in the entire kingdom of life. Ideally there is nothing hege- monic or imperialistic in religious affection or moral sensibility. The actual history of both is a grim story, a violent contradic- tion of the ideal. So the question concerning the historical reli- gious communities is whether they can learn to transcend their histories. Specifically addressed to Christian theologians: What can you do to relate the Christ of cult and Christendom to the Johannine Christ who says "I have other sheep that are not of this fold" (John 10:16, RSV); and who is intimately in- volved in the coming-to-be of the world (cosmos), "and the world was made through him" (1:10). For Gustafson the appropriate resolution of such questions requires a reconstitution of nature as a major theological-ethi- cal concern. But such a conceptual-intellectual adjustment is hardly the dominant religious end. That must be reformation of practical piety. I venture to put it this way: The particulari- ties of traditional piety must be disciplined by natural piety, that is by images and affections and aspirations relating us to God's presence and activity in the great world disclosed by the sciences. So it comes to this: Christianity must be saved from its an- thropocentric soteriological history. Or else? Or else its long descent into desuetude, interrupted occasionally by a spasm or tic simulating vitality, will accelerate as chemists continue to concoct "uppers" and "downers" far more likely to fulfill ad- vertised promises than the nostrums of conventional religiosity. B. Nothing perverse or prejudicial is intended by the title bor- rowed from Spinoza for this paper or by employing the "God- demented" philosopher elsewhere in it. As I have thought about Gustafson's extraordinarily fertile work, I have found it useful, nearly inevitable in fact, to use Spinoza as a foil in inter- preting it. I do not argue that there is an equivalency to be</page><page sequence="7">Concerning God and Man 673 made out. I sense affinities linking Gustafson and Spinoza; equivalency is a different issue and I do not pursue it. There is a striking affinity between Gustafson's critique of traditional Christianity and Spinoza's. Both reject supernatu- ralism both as theology and as piety. Both are severe critics of Christian anthropocentrism: God does not have an obsessive particularizing concern for the wellbeing of humankind. Therefore a religion constitutionally as well as historically ad- dicted to soteriological overload is unacceptable both as theol- ogy and as practical piety. I think it is faithful to the spirit of this critique of traditional Christianity to say that it offers illu- sory assurance of the infinite value of the private ego and pro- vides theological rationalizations for destructive class dominations. In his critique of religion Gustafson goes further than Spinoza in appraising its social dimensions. My intention in drawing such a distinction is neither to beg questions nor to file a premature or ex parte judgment. Hence what is intended is simply this: A pos tula tional theocentrism is a doctrine or viewpoint employed to account for or to illumi- nate an historical-cultural situation. At first glance Gustafson's theocentrism can be construed this way. He surveys the mis- chief wrought by anthropocentric and imperialistic Christianity, the incalculable damage to the natural world as well as to other religious cultures. What could serve to enlarge perception and moral sensitivity? What would humble religious and cultural megalomania? What but learning to see ourselves and all things around as all would be seen and evaluated by One whose intelligence and power and wisdom are infinite? This God would have no pets, no favorites (Acts 10:34). This God would treat the just and unjust without regard for our moral preferences (Mt 5:45). This God would not think as we think. I think Gustafson's viewpoint is not distorted by this con- strual. I would add to it a view of validation of a postulational theocentrism consistent with this preliminary interpretation. The validation of such a theocentrism would be neither a set of rational "proofs" nor a dazzling theophany. The proving would be a recovery of sobriety and an enlargement of percep- tion and a deepening of discernment. Which is to say the vali- dation would be a marked improvement in the human condition. It would be an "optimizing" of the human possibil-</page><page sequence="8">674 SOUNDINGS Julian N Hartt ity and a new lease on life for other members of the realm of nature battered and betrayed by human recklessness and arrogance. There is not yet before us a sufficient basis for placing Gus- tafson's theocentrism in the postulational camp. Before en- larging that basis we ought to factor in the other main form of an ontologically mandated doctrine concerning God, nature and man. This one is far more familiar and initially in our theo- logical world far more plausible than Spinoza's. This is the claim that God himself has authentically and absolutely re- vealed his deity. "I am God, and there is no other. I am God and there is none like me" (Isa 46:9 RSV). In the Barthian view what this God reveals is infinitely more than divine initiative in man's knowledge of God. The Word is God; the substance, so to speak, of revelation is God. Is it not odd to call this an "ontologically mandated" doc- trine? Only if "ontologically" is burdened with a theory about being and its modes. The point is that revelation does not come as an option submitted to the aesthetic mode, as a possi- bility to be realized by subjective resolution. The two types of ontologically mandated theocentrism are generally regarded as mutually antipathetic. They do not ex- haust the possibilities, to be sure, but Gustafson does not ride with either of them. Is he therefore obligated to embrace a postulational option, a theological equivalent of the philosophy of Als Ob? A fair answer to that question requires us to consider what he has in mind in contending for the primacy of experience. In appraising claims similar to the two types of ontologically mandated theocentrism, Gustafson says, revelation and reason are human reflections on human exper- iences. (I, 148) Not only are natural theology and revealed the- ology both grounded in human experiences; both necessarily refer to human mediations of the meaning and significance of aspects of nature and human experience through experience it- self. (I, 149) What does "grounded in" mean? Perhaps something truis- tic: revelations happen to people, not to subhuman beings; human minds make out rational structures ("make up" begs the question). But perhaps "grounded in" tracks into "neces-</page><page sequence="9">Concerning God and Man 675 sarily refer to" in the quotation above. If so, then is Gustafson denying or at least doubting that the claims both of revelational and rational theocentrism refer to anything or any order of be- ing except experience? Or is he saying that theological claims require mediation through or by scientifically grounded knowledge? I think the answer to that question is clear and emphatic: The substantial content of theology, if it is not in perfect har- mony with scientific knowledge, cannot be in sharp incongruity with it, and what we say about God must be congruent in some way with what we know about human experience and its objects through the sciences. (I, 251-52) And again: I believe it is proper and necessary to test what is said theologi- cally in the light of relevant sciences, and to use indicators from the sciences in what one says substantively about God. (I, 258) Thus the sciences have or seem to have an access to the actual and the possible unavailable to theological thinking. But per- haps religious experience is more favorably placed than theol- ogy in transactions with reality. Especially if one allows full play to the religious affections in understanding experience. Gustafson strongly emphasizes the modes of affectivity in any presumptively valid religious construal of reality, human and natural and divine. This does not clearly mean, however, that he endows feeling with cognitional transitivity, à la Charles Hartshorne. A feeling - "absolute" or otherwise- of depen- dence upon God specifies nothing about Deity, unless "Deity" turns out to refer to (= express?) that feeling. (A subjectivised version of the cosmological argument as to the cause of that feeling, which Schleiermacher may or may not make.) Gustaf- son does not take that route in any case. He does not claim that readiness to trust all things to God entails a certainty ob- jectively grounded that God is worthy of that commitment or that he takes human attitudes and dispositions into account. True, a person might be better off - more at peace, more sym- pathetic to others, etc. - for having such feelings and attitudes. But is calculation of such effects and affects theological business? If then it is necessary to ascend to God through nature, so far as strong cognitivity is concerned, what sort of reality is nature, and what does God have to do with it?</page><page sequence="10">676 SOUNDINGS Julian N Hartt Much that Gustafson wants to say about nature as a system emerges in whole-part terminology. Does this mean that na- ture is best understood as an all-comprehending reality not radically different from Spinoza's substance, Deus sive Naturai Several considerations bear on these issues. (1) Gustafson has grave doubts about teleological descriptions and explana- tions of nature. The presence of order and ordering does not warrant the confir- mation of a final purposiveness in nature ... Its presence, how- ever, evokes awe and respect, natural piety, towards nature. And it warrants the affirmation within piety that the powers and the ultimate power are ordering; they are not purely contingent or chaotic. (I, 262) Spinoza had no doubts about teleological explanation: he rejected it (see Appendix, Pt 1, Ethics). But he had no doubt that nature is order and ordering. The question then for Spi- noza and Gustafson is, What kind of order? What about the classical options? (a) Mechanical system: the parts of the cosmic "machine" are organized by purely ex- ternal relations. Nothing is determined from or by the "in- sides" of any entity, (b) Rational-mental order: the constituents of nature are essentially mental phenomena com- prehended by and as Mind, (c) Mind-matter parallelism: ra- tional (mental) and mechanical systems perfectly interlocked, neither determining any event in the sequences of the other. All that is metaphysics. I do not claim that Gustafson has to play a hand in that ancient game; it is pretty clear that he does not intend to do that. Is it then some admixture of science and common sense that assures us that Chaos is not nature's God or is not God's arch-enemy? What is our rational assurance that something lords it over contingency in nature and history? Gustafson is confident that the nisus (not his word for it) of nature can be made out. The right identification of this cosmic drift has large import for theology and ethics. Nature (natura naturans) is and makes for increasing depth and complexity of inter-relationships. Ethnicians tend to give top priority to au- tonomy of the moral agent. Nature places incomparably greater weight on the interdependence of all entities and all subsystems. Suppose we were to say with Sartre that the ego- will in us posits being-in-and-for itself as the quintessential</page><page sequence="11">Concerning God and Man 677 good, the joy of natural desiring. If Gustafson is right this lay- ing-hold of aseity would place man at punishing cross-purposes with nature, whether or not God would thus be deprived of an attribute Christian theologians have long awarded to God alone. But does nature have this attribute after all, on Gustafson's reckoning? He makes no investment in the concept of aseity (see I, 195). Perhaps this expresses an unwillingness to specu- late about God-in-himself, Deity in se, a se. But now we are ask- ing about nature, a se. Is nature as the order of orders, as the inclusive whole, itself and as such Deity? Gustafson insists that all natural entities are constituted by their relationships; whatever any of them has of integral actuality is a node in a pattern of relations. Is then nature as such a self-constituting absolute whole and thus God? Alas, with such questions we trench again on metaphysics. Perhaps different and better clues can be gathered from the human situation. (2) Where does man stand in relation to the system of nature and nature's drift? It follows, I believe, from the theological interpretation of the world I have been developing that human life is to be construed in continuity with "nature" as much as in distinction from it. (I, 282) What weight does Gustafson want us to give to continuity} Surely not primarily taxonomical similarities, man "the naked ape" and so on. Rather, I suppose, continuity has to do with temporal-historical sequences. Every individual (waiving the question how far down and back real individuality appears in nature) is a product of time-bound processes. But suppose con- tinuity also concerns both causal interconnectedness and invio- lable asymmetry linking causes and effects. Suppose further that "inviolable asymmetry" comes out this way: If a is the cause of b then the causal "flow" cannot be reversed, making b the cause of a. Even if a is only one causal factor in the occur- rence or modification of b it is still the case that b is not and cannot be a causal factor in the occurrence or modification of a. And even if there might be a world in which A's caused a 's it is unthinkable that even there the "flow" could be reversed. Sci- ence as we have it in this world is committed to the rule: Given</page><page sequence="12">678 SOUNDINGS Julian N Hartt a then b, so far as b manifests an a determinant. And this rule strikes us as so eminently sane that it encourages us to see na- ture as being the antithesis of chaos and pure contingency. Asymmetrical causality is only secondarily a function of time, unless we are in a metaphysics in which time itself is a causal agent. Metaphysics (Process or other) aside, we need now to see what Gustafson does with agency, for this has a good deal to do with his reading of man's place in nature. In Gustafson's view real entities are causes and effects. In abstract terms activity-passivity is a dual ontological principle, a polarity at the heart of the system of nature. (Mechanistic ma- terialism, as Marx saw, cannot allow this). This ontological principle fully applies to man: he is both agent and patient. As agent man has a limited but important power both of self-de- termination and of intervention in the processes and orders of nature. Thus we do some things because we intend to do them. These intendings operate in a nexus of social and bio- logical and physical factors, a world the agent has not made and which in ever so many ways is the necessary presupposition of even the highest reaches of his "free" spirit. Nevertheless the given antecedent pattern does not determine (= necessi- tate) the outcome of intentional action. The intelligibility of the outcome presupposes the causal nexus. The evaluation of the outcome presupposes access to the good, the order of Ideality. Is Ideality an aspect or an order of nature? Or of God? Gus- tafson does not say. I do not pursue that issue here but turn to a related one, human creativity. As I read Gustafson, he in- tends to endow the human with a significant measure of crea- tivity. This endowment is not the same as being able to make a difference. Any moment (state) in the cosmic system is differ- ent from the immediately antecedent one, if the system is dy- namic. Creativity has to do with the infusion of novelty into some detail of the system, novelty not simply of affect but of 'substance,' that is of order and energy and vector. Granted creativity, whence comes it? Is it from God? If fi- nite (human, in this case) creativity comes from God, is its pres- ence in us a clue to the nature of Deity? Here we must keep in mind that Gustafson does not credit Deity with personal attributes:</page><page sequence="13">Concerning God and Man 679 It is my conviction that if we choose to use the analogy of agency for construing the Deity, it must be developed with great circum- spection. Insofar as the analogy leads us to assert that God has intelligence, like but superior to our own, and that God has a will, a capacity to control events comparable to the more radical claims made for human beings, the claims are excessive. (I, 270) He goes on to say: My argument radically qualifies the traditional Christian claim that the ultimate power seeks the human good as its central fo- cus of activity. (1,271) If I correctly understand Gustafson here, then "radically quali- fies" can be translated as denying that traditional doctrine. But is it denied simply because of its anthropomorphic fixation or because the attribution of "personal" attributes to Deity is unintelligible; and is unintelligible, say, because science pro- vides not even the slenderest scintilla of evidence for the pres- ence of super-intelligence in the cosmos? I do not understand why we should expect science to speak to the question whether God, understood to be the ultimate power of being, is ration- ally and knowingly in the good-making business at all. So does Gustafson intend to leave to religious piety the mat- ter of God's creativity as the necessary and sufficient condition of its presence in us? If so then the theologians in the believing community must find the constraints of circumspection acutely limiting as they wrestle with the question of truth in this matter. Suppose, though, that the "good-making" enterprise is cos- mos-wide; and that every integral being (= one that is not a quality or mode of another) is governed by a drive (conatus) to preserve its being. ("Everything has in itself a striving to pre- serve its condition, and to improve itself." Spinoza, God, Man . . . , Chap. V; see also Ethics, III, Prop. VII.) And suppose we say this is a natural fact underivative from and thus inexplicable by reference to any ontologically higher principle. And now suppose we infer from this that the perfection of the whole sys- tem is the business of every part or element; so that God is immanent in that enterprise; indeed really is that enterprise. The spirit of Spinoza wafts through these suppositions. Of course he does not embrace an anthropomorphic doctrine of God. But in his view God is rational altogether and in every part, so to speak. So God did not first excogitate a world and then go about to actualize it as a very worthwhile thing if not</page><page sequence="14">680 SOUNDINGS Julian N Hartt the very best in the world line. That, for Spinoza, is picture- book piety. Rather, the world is the perfect actualization across time and space of divine perfection. I think there can be very little doubt that such a doctrine is very far from Gustafson's intentions. He does not say what the best model or analogy of pattern in nature is. Perhaps he would agree that in the beginning and everywhere the pattern is logos (note the lower-case "1"), order intelligible a se. Is then logos self-subsistent and self-explanatory? Is logos God, is it God's mind? Pursuit of such questions would have carried Gustafson far afield from his main goal. I do not want to saddle him with them, but I find them hard to cast aside as I ponder the options in accounting for human creativity. There is one more of those I wish to sketch in. Suppose that finite creativity is one possibility in a cosmic sit- uation in which all things are possible. In that (unimaginable?) primordial situation there are no loaded dice, there are no fa- vorites. Then inexplicably (no Creator) a world, a system of actualities, appears. This system replicates itself so far as possi- ble; such is the conatus of aggregates become systems. But no system can replicate itself perfectly. It cannot extirpate ran- domness, it cannot rule out chance events. Hence the concate- nation of causal factors in the system is never perfect. Moreover the closer the system comes to producing homo sapi- ens the greater the risks to the self-replication of the system, because man will be in some small but real way causa sui. In this he will be god-like. He will have the capability of intervening in natural processes, in some cases preventing their ordained ef- fects from occurring, in other cases immensely enhancing ef- fects. This singular creature has succeeded in eliminating some species from the animal kingdom. He has immensely aug- mented the power of others, not always on purpose, e.g., the potato fungus. Are we to suppose that this willful hell-raising heaven-aspir- ing creature is purely ( = essentially) situated in nature? If so what does this do, properly, to our understanding and image of nature? Suppose we were to say that the human is the point at which nature comes to self-consciousness. Science, thus, would be nature's self-understanding, science now as any and</page><page sequence="15">Concerning God and Man 681 all veridical cognition. Let us agree that it is only by specula- tion we can make out such a telos in this strange development. So we posit a practical telos in nature's self-production of truth (humankind). That is to say, intelligence is an instrument for the optimizing of causal efficacy. The appearance and exercise of this instrument posit a measure of transcendence in it since it is charged (so to speak) with monitoring myriad other processes with a view to their enrichment. For transcendence is presup- posed in any efficacious and lucid discernment of ends-and- means. Thinking-out that relationship in any concrete situa- tion, that is, one in which action is required, assumes at least momentary detachment from it. The mind needs its own time and space to envisage its objective options and 'taste' the con- sequences of each. It little matters that this peculiar process may not have devel- oped until very recently in the life-span of the cosmos. The cosmos has no history until it has happened. Indeed given this awkward and far-fetched hypothesis the cosmos is barren of knowing as such until homo sapiens appears on the scene. Feeling has been around a great deal longer in and as animate being. So also appetition (conatus). But a trice ago, in cosmic compu- tation, feeling and perception and appetition became self-re- flexive and consciousness became self-consciousness, and the distinction and correlation of self-and-other became, is still be- coming, a master pattern in nature. This pattern, this clue to system, has the capability of overriding the primordial pattern, activity-passivity. The human self, as noted, can impose its power upon other agents both in human society and in the wider environment. The human self is in a real sense both causa sui and a prime mover in the cosmos. So if humankind is to be seen as wholly situated in nature, we ought to expect radical things to happen to our understanding of nature and of reality as such. Spinoza was well prepared for this. In his view every element of the cosmic system is indispensable for its perfection. Thus the leit-motiv is necessity; there is no place for a counterpoint named possibility. Every element (mode) is both cause and ef- fect. Hence man's well-being consists of clear and full-hearted recognition of the perfection of the whole and of his place in it. This is "the intellectual love of God":</page><page sequence="16">682 SOUNDINGS Julian N Hartt The intellectual love of the mind towards God is the very love with which He Loves Himself. (Ethics, Part V, Prop, xxxvi) I find in Part V, prop, xix of the Ethics a helpful transition to the last part of this paper. There Spinoza says: He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return. Spinoza has prepared for this in Prop, xvii: "God is free from passions." And in the Corollary: "Properly speaking, God loves no one and hates no one." Spinoza's instinct here is quite different from Gustafson's. Spinoza's ontological bias is unmistakably towards activity and actuality. The more perfect a being is the less it is enmeshed in passivity; it is better to act than to be acted upon. This bias is a clear and powerful echo of Aristotelian and Thomist views. The great difference is that for Spinoza God, the true and abso- lute principle of activity, is the immanent cause of all things. II. The Proper Service of God "He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return." For Gustafson, too, one ought not to expect God to respond person to person to our needs and desires. Since in his view God does not have personal attributes (that is, there are no clear and compelling warrants in experience for such attributions), we speak figuratively in our piety when we say God "hears" our prayers and one way or another "answers" them. How then in Gustafson's view does God relate to us and to all finite beings? (Gustafson does not pursue the question of how God relates to himself.) We must begin farther back: What being or beings does "God" designate? God is the ulti- mate power that brings all things into being; sustaining, order- ing, and bearing down upon them; and creating the conditions for possibility of change and development in them. God is the determiner of the ultimate destiny of all things. (II, 293) And again: God orders the life of the world through the patterns and processes of interdependence in which human persons, institu- tions, communities, and the species participate. (II, 298) Thus in a dynamic universe God is the dominant, indeed the ultimate dynamic being. I take it this means that God implants</page><page sequence="17">Concerning God and Man 683 order and energizes the entire system and directs its life. Can anything further be said about the direction God "intends"? We have noted Gustafson's demurrer about teleological ex- planation exalted to cosmological and theological ranges. Yet perhaps it would be allowable to propose that the divine "pur- pose" can be adduced from the actuality of the cosmic system, the goal or "the end of creation" from a cross-sectioning of the cosmic process. This would be congruent with Gustafson's in- sistence on the dynamics of ordering as outranking achieved (re- alized) order. "God is ordering all things; God has not established an immutable order of all things." (II, 293; empha- sis Gustafson's.) I do not suppose this means that God's highest priority is change for change's sake; surely the divinely-intended pay-off of creation and creativity isn't sheer bustle. But it seems to me that Gustafson's use of "creating," "sustaining," "bearing down upon" strongly suggests end-directed if not end-con- trolled processes. They add up to a drive (nisus) for the enrich- ment of the system of nature, the whole of creation, in every part; and without irrational favoritism for any part or member of the system. For none is enhanced unless all enjoy an enrich- ment of being. Such is the rationale of a nature in which inter- dependence is among the highest priorities. And such is the demand of nature's God. The singular creature, the human being, stands forth in this picture as a special event of the divine creative process. That is its singularity. ("Special agent" is my term, but I think it is ap- propriate.) Whether or not we think Gustafson ought to see the human as the point at which nature becomes self-conscious and rationally (more or less) self-determining, Gustafson does clearly mark out for the human a unique role. Here is the crea- ture, the only one so far known to us, able consciously and de- liberately to relate to other beings as they are related to God. And from this endowment springs a divine imperative: so to do is the proper service of God. In so doing God is "glorified." Man the special agent must cope with a double-edged man- date: it has a negative and a positive aspect. Gustafson does not say so, but this mandate can be expressed in two comple- mentary ethical principles, non-maleficence and beneficence. Thou shalt not do evil; Thou shalt do good. God is that which</page><page sequence="18">684 SOUNDINGS Julian N Hartt enhances (Spinoza: "increases") being. Evil is that which di- minishes being. This mandate is more than a human-regarding imperative. It is cosmological. The entire order of beings is precious in the sight of God, if a lapse into piety is excusable. God has no fa- vorites, but this does not mean that God is indifferent to the interests of his creatures. This mandate has further complications. As special agents in and for the kingdom of nature we must act, as we must live, in ambiguity. On this redoubtable theme Gustafson has things to say that go well beyond well- trod theological paths; notably beyond the trails of Niebuhr and Barth. For Gustafson the constitutive am- biguity of the moral life says as much about the objective situa- tion as it does about the inescapable complexity of motive-and- intention in the moral agent. Whatever is to be said about the impurity of the springs of human action, on Biblical grounds and otherwise, the inherent difficulties in making out "the will of God" in concrete situations are immense. As we have seen, on the high theological front Gustafson does not ascribe a "will" to God. For ethical purposes that is hardly the weighti- est consideration: The human capacity to be participants in the patterns and processes of interdependence of life grounds our vocation to discern what God is enabling and requiring us to be and to do. The task of ethics is to use knowledge and intelligence to dis- cern, under the inexorable conditions of finitude, how we are to relate ourselves and all things in a manner appropriate to our and their relations to God. It is to seek how to participate in nature and society, in history and culture, and in the ordering of ourselves so that human life is in the service of God . . . We are fated never to have the certainty we desire in the human venture. (II, 321-22) So ambiguity is best construed as uncertainty, uncertainty as an objective correlate of finitude, not as a synonyn for finitude. We come thus to the determinate and the interdeterminate as these are related to God. Ought we to say that from God's perspective there is no real difference between the determinate (the actual) and the indeterminate (the possible); so that the indeterminate is simply inchoate or emerging actuality (the de- terminate)? If we held that to be the case, we would not have</page><page sequence="19">Concerning God and Man 685 to agree with Aristotle that possibility is human ignorance of proper cause. But it would follow that there is no slack or free play in the order/ordering of possibility. We wouldn't know what God was doing, but there would be no happenchance in its occurrence. I do not believe this schematism works for Gustafson. It does not allow for God's accent on human intervention in natu- ral order and process as a human capability. It would work for a rigid Calvinism according to which human agents are predestined instruments of God's sovereign will. Gustafson does not accept that. William James offers a radically different alternative: human- kind is called to be a junior partner in the divine moral trans- formation of the world. As James sees it, this high calling presupposes not only a pluralistic universe but an open one, a nature and history whose shape and texture are yet to be deter- mined. Construing James loosely, we might say that what-is-to- be necessarily has strong connections with what-is. And one of these strong connections is human perception of faults in what- is that sprung from bad human choices. Some evils thus done are not specifically remediable. They may be forgiven, but they become, even as forgiven, part of the infinitely complex pattern of reality. But some evils are remediable. The cost of that re- demption is often very great. If the instincts of the Christian gospel are sound, that redemptive activity is literally divine. If Gustafson's instincts are sound, the proper service of God re- quires a full-hearted participation in the process of redemp- tion, not just as beneficiaries but as resolute agents in and for the cause. And this accent is hard to find in traditional doc- trine. It is easier to find in popular versions of soul-saving as a human and divine enterprise. But that is a view of salvation very different from Gustafson's. His instincts and his program carry far beyond such notions of salvation as a joint venture of God and man, and beyond the reaches of Christian orthodoxy. I think he believes that orthodoxy makes too much of restora- tion of an antecedent state of affairs as God's purpose and achievement in salvation. Perhaps it says more than Gustafson intends, but I think for him creativity ought to be the dominant note, that is, a systematic infusion of novelty into antecedent patterns; envisionment of novel patterns. (Every master</page><page sequence="20">686 SOUNDINGS Julian N Hartt painter begins as a disciple of a master; failure of vision or of courage, rather than defect of skill, is the fate of epigones). So understood, Jesus Christ does not lead us back to God. As the "pioneer" of faith he leads us forward to God through un- charted wilderness. ("Pioneer": RSV's imaginative rendering ofarchegos at Heb. 12:2). III. Conclusion Spinoza says, "the love of God towards men and the intellec- tual love of the mind towards God are one and the same thing." (Part V, Cor. prop, xxxvi). From this he draws his magisterial conclusion concerning the moral life: "Blessedness is not the reward of virtue, but is virtue itself." (Prop xlii, Pt. V.). Gustafson concludes his work with an invocation of meta- physical-religious piety that does not suffer in conjunction with Spinoza's: God does not exist simply for the service of human beings. Human beings exist for the service of God. God will not be manipulated. God will not be ignored or denied. God will be God. (II, 322) I am not sure why we ought to say that God does not exist simply for us. Here I confess to an antique bias, that in himself God does not exist for any being other than himself. But not because of self-absorption. Rather, because the Being in whom all exists that do exist, and before whom all things rise and pass away, is causa sui: nothing accounts for God - except God. It follows that our "consent" to the being of others, and a dispo- sition in us to increase their being, so far as it lies in us to do so, is the only truly divinely ordained love for God; whether or not it "is the same as God's love of Himself." Perhaps the sev- eral pieties and moralities of traditional religion would find it difficult to prosper or even to live on so straitened a budget of holy affections. But Gustafson's austere vision can be corrobo- rated from Scripture: Whom God loves he straitens (Heb. 12:6, more or less). And there is the word from Jesus: The gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few. (Mt. 7:14 RSV)</page><page sequence="21">Concerning God and Man 687 That last clause has an undemocratic-elitist ring to it. But I suppose little in conventional Christianity prepares us to credit, let alone cherish, the other clauses either. Enough, surely, of my suppositions and crotchets. Here again is Gustafson's last word: "God will be God." In this I do not understand Gustafson to be echoing the theological plea, "Let God be God!" He says God will be God. God is not elected to the office. God does not come to be because we need him or because our "consent" pulls him across the line into actuality. But we are summoned to an election: we can elect to love and serve him in the only way as God he credits.</page><page sequence="22">RESPONSE TO HARTT James M. Gustafson ^f ira his great learning and superior intelligence, Hartt has done what I hoped someone would do, i.e. set my work in the context of Spinoza. Indeed, if I had been more in com- mand of Spinoza, I would have made his work one of the benchmarks for delineating the distinctive features of my theo- logical ethics. Among published responses so far only Mary Midgley mentions Spinoza and then in a different context from Hartt's. Two colleagues, a philosopher and an intellectual his- torian, orally related my work to Spinoza after at least a cursory reading of Volume One. More than I did, Hartt, in one of his disposable crotchets, lines out briefly aspects of modern theology to which he sees my work as a response. And he accurately indicates both my concerns and how I have moved toward developing them. Although I did not state it in the same terms, Hartt is correct to indicate that I see "scientific representations of nature and their practico- technological derivatives" as dominating our his- torical and cultural reality. Whether theologians intend to re- spond to that reality or not, one can infer how their work relates to it. Hartt indicates some of the possibilities. Process theology takes them seriously and develops a metaphysics that accords with certain general lines of scientific accounts of the world. How it relates to biblical and historic Christian themes is worked out differently by different persons. Others have taken James M. Gustafson is Henry R. Luce Professor of Humanities and Compara- tive Studies at Emory University. Recent publications include Ethics from A Theocentric Perspective, 2 vols. (1981 and 1984) and The U.S. Business Corporation: An Institution in Transition (with John R. Meyer, eds., 1988). The relations be- tween theological and moral anthropology and recent work in the human sci- ences is a major on-going research interest. Soundings 73.4 (Winter 1990). ISSN 0038-1861.</page><page sequence="23">690 SOUNDINGS James M. Gustafson the narrative line, developing a view of how historical narra- tives form communities, presumably the characters of their members, and ways of viewing the world. Theology has to be faithful to the narrative, or as George Lindbeck counsels, it must "renew in a posttraditional and postliberal mode the an- cient practice of absorbing the universe into the biblical world." (The Nature of Doctrine, 138). Others take a different hermeneutical tack, relating religious experience to texts. One reads books in which Nietzsche, Freud and Marx are viewed as the shapers of the modern world, books in which there is no reference to Darwin, Einstein, and the developers of the infor- mation revolution and artificial intelligence. Some theologians join those who view science as the religious mythology of the twentieth century, and in part the charge is correct. But that "mythology" worked out in many particular investigations pro- vides grounds for interventions into life whose outcomes often have a high degree of predictability. If I were not persuaded that various sciences provide impor- tant explanations of nature (including human nature), society and culture, I could blithely pass by the implications of these sciences for ethics and for theology. I have stated over and over that theology and ethics have to come to grips with vari- ous sciences, and not only Science. I fail to see how the uni- verse as it is understood scientifically can be absorbed into the biblical world without very critical reconsiderations of that world and of the religious tradition it has informed. If theology and ethics are finally more than sets of concepts and myths which provide useful meaning and order to life, i.e. if they fi- nally have to relate to reality, then theology and ethics have to be developed in relation to those sciences which provide data, explanations and interpretations of aspects of it. And as Hartt puts it, natural piety has to discipline Christian piety. Also, the orderings of life in the world, the patterns and processes of in- terdependence, offer us clues about the ultimate power and or- der of life, i.e. about the presence of the Deity. Theology can ignore these things; it can argue for their irrelevance to theol- ogy; or it can take them into consideration in formulating a comprehensive and coherent presentation. Each of these options requires the theologian to deal with the historic religious tradition of which she or he is a part in</page><page sequence="24">Response to Hartt 691 some way. For me, the constructive effort rests on three pillars: the historic tradition of Christian faith and theology, human ex- perience and particularly what I call natural piety, and scientific accounts. Hartt grasps my fundamental interests and inten- tions as accurately as any commentator on my work and more accurately than most of them. Hartt goes on to show that there are affinities but not equivalencies between my work and Spinoza's. He is correct about a similar response to traditional religion, namely to its penchant for anthropocentrism, and particularly for its focus of concern on the well-being of humankind. Spinoza's response in the Ethics is deeply sublimated in the abstractions of his argu- ment, but the impulse is certainly prophetic and radical; it is a critique of fundamental beliefs that have falsely issued in exclu- sively human-centered values. There are also some affinities between my work and biblical prophetic books, and those twen- tieth-century theocentrisms found in such diverse theologians as Barth in Romans, Henry Nelson Wieman and Charles Harts- horne, and H. Richard Niebuhr. I have not developed a philosophical theology in the way that Spinoza has; Hartt is correct that if I did it would not focus on substance. Herein lies a gnawing uncertainty about my work. Does a theologian have an obligation to develop philosoph- ically what is imbedded in her theology? Is one being "incon- sistent" if one does not spell out in non-religious language the relations of God to all things that are implied in what one writes in more distinctively religious language? Certainly many formative theologians in the Protestant tradition have not done that. Theological ethics as I have developed it is grounded in Cre- ation, in the first article of the creed. I have what Edward Far- ley has called a "common sense ontology" in my account of the patterns and processes of interdependence of life in the world in which humans participate. That ontology is derived from re- flections on the possibilities and constraints present in human experience, and from various sources in contemporary sciences that interpret them. My understanding of life in relation to God falls under Calvin's sensus divinitatis and its functional equivalents in other Christian theologies - a basis that falls short of his, and most others' true knowledge of God. Indeed</page><page sequence="25">692 SOUNDINGS James M. Gustafson for Calvin and others my position would be idolatrous. That ontology also describes human beings as participants in these patterns and processes. While the ultimate destiny of all that is cannot be controlled by human activity, and thus will be deter- mined by the ultimate power, humans are accountable for their purposive interventions in these patterns and processes. As a result I end up commending humanity to be in the service of God, and not to have an intellectual love of God. Hartt is correct that I want to preserve the Christian story. His claim on my behalf in this regard, however, is stronger than what I state in my book. I have not claimed that it is "the his- torical absolute" of the community of moral discourse. I do affirm that in biblical accounts, including the Christian story, we have a quite trustworthy record of what we humans are to be and to do that is grounded in the community's life under God. Hartt is correct that I reject efforts to make Jesus Christ "into a religious and cultural Imperator." I chose my words about Jesus Christ and the tradition with great deliberation; if I were to be overinterpreted, I want that excess to err on the side of minimal claims about the authority of the Christian story. I feared that some of the force of my position could be mitigated by readers who would find too easy equivalence with more or- thodox statements. The rhetoric on this point, as in much of both volumes, was intended to evoke the readers' own reflec- tions on the viability of their Christian convictions. Hartt is correct to see my intention to be a reform of Christian piety and, I would add, Christian morality as these exist in the con- temporary Church. "Deus et (siveî) Natura." In this section of his paper Hartt em- ploys distinctions I did not consider - between postulational and ontological theocentrism, and a further distinction be- tween two forms of the latter: rationalistic and revelational. "A postulational theocentrism is a doctrine . . . employed to account for or to illuminate a historical-cultural situation." This seems to be applicable to such books as Gordon Kauf- man's Theology for a Nuclear Age and Sallie McFague's Models of God. In these books the authors analyze accurately profound threats to humanity, and then postulate God or models of God which, if believed and acted upon, would impede the destruc- tive and repressive forces that threaten us. One could argue</page><page sequence="26">Response to Hartt 693 that both of these authors make the Deity a postulate of pure practical reason. Hartt's distinctions have heuristic value in understanding my work as well. The key word from the quotation above, for me, is "employed." I think my work does illuminate our historical- cultural situation; it is postulational in this regard, as Hartt notes. But it is also "ontological" in the sense that the view- point from which culture is critically analyzed is tested in the light of material from the sciences and a range of human exper- iences. God, or a model of God, is not merely symbolic; its adequacy is judged not simply by how it might affect our ac- tions for the sake of the well-being of humanity or the creation. Hartt gives two options for ontological theocentrism, rational- istic or revelational. Mine is clearly not revelational in the sense of Karl Barth's, nor is it rationalistic in the sense of Spinoza's. What is problematic about my position is that theological symbols from the tradition and evidences from the sciences and experience are used to interpret each other. What I find satis- fying enough to commend to others appears to critics to be in- decision, especially to those who work with binary distinctions not as heuristic devices but as rubrics of classification. If my construal of the cultural situation is illuminative, I would like to believe that is because it is in some accord with Reality - Real- ity that threatens as well as sustains and enhances the human good and the good of the creation. Hartt accurately tracks the use I make of sciences in coming to an interpretation of God and God's relation to all things. Theological claims require mediation through scientifically grounded knowledge. This leads to his analysis of the relation of God to nature in my work. None of my critics, nor I, am satisfied with my construal of the issues in this problematic, nor of my resolution. No other commentator has provided as pre- cise and subtle an account of what I say in this regard, how I say it, and various implications of what is said, and how. Some the- ological critics have called me a "confessionalist" or a "fideist"; others press for what they perceive to be an implied general metaphysics. Hartt is correct to point out the importance of the part- whole language. I was plagued with logical problems in thinking that</page><page sequence="27">694 SOUNDINGS James M. Gustafson through and certainly know the limitations of the language I use in this regard. Three classical options are offered by Hartt about the kind of order or ordering one can have: a mechanical system, a ra- tional-mental order, and a mind-matter parallelism. If the term interaction were used in the third case rather than parallelism, I believe it would be close to what I attempt to argue. His ques- tion, "What is our rational assurance that something lords it over contingency in nature and history?" deserves some an- swer. As elsewhere in his article Hartt here raises questions I did not consciously address, though perhaps I ought to have. The choice, in my judgment, is not between chaos and some predetermined immutable order. In nature and history there are conditions of possibility which have limits but which (as possibility implies) are affected by interactions with environ- ments and by human interventions. In biology, for example, Ernst Mayr and others have long distinguished between essen- tialism and probability. I understand physical theory to be making a similar point. (What "chaos" theory implies I think it is too early to judge; it may signify more complex possibilities and order, rather than more randomness.) Biblical and Reformed tradition both inform the piety I de- scribe and the claim that God is not exhausted by nature. The significance of this for ethics when coupled with the mediating importance of the sciences for interpreting God is twofold. The "common sense ontology" of mutual interdependence and ordering provides a naturalistic basis for ethics, and thus one that is available to non-theologians (e.g., it is shared by Mary Midgley and many others). The piety of the monotheistic believer focuses the affections and the "senses" I have articu- lated, and thus intensifies the sense of obligation and opportu- nity. The experience and conviction of a God who is not exhausted by nature impregnates the dispositions and attitudes of moral agents; "nature" is a basis for determining proper or- dering activity by humans. Hartt moves his scalpel to my views about the relation of hu- manity to nature. (Whether he is using it on a living organism or a cadaver is a matter on which my readers differ!) He cor- rectly shows that I view human life in continuity with nature as much as in distinction from it. He asks what the weight of this</page><page sequence="28">Response to Hartt 695 is. Here I respond more with a query than a direct answer. Does "causal mterconnectedness" necessarily entail "inviolable asymmetry" in the way Hartt expounds this? Of course present events cannot "cause" past events; the flow cannot be tempo- rally reversed. But in a given sequence the mutual effects can be stated in non-mechanistic ways. Does the brain cause thought as a causes b, or can b (thoughts) have a causal effect on a (brain)? Is such a case describable in more intricate inter- actional terms? Agency is the capacity to be a determinant, one of at least several, in the sequence of interdependent processes. Hartt correctly indicates that the intelligibility of the out- come of these interactions presupposes a causal nexus, but the evaluation of it presupposes access to the good, what he calls "the order of Ideality." "Is Ideality an aspect or an order of nature? Or of God? Gustafson does not say." The reason he did not say is that he never thought to pose the question in that way. How I would answer that is dependent upon how the pre- vious issue of the relation of God to nature is settled. I cannot undertake further exploration of that at this point in time. I do believe that creativity "is from God." It is present in the ordering of nature, including human nature as conditions of possibility. Elements of contingency in nature make possible new and unpredictable outcomes in sequences of events. Na- ture, society, and history afford a variety of possibilities and outcomes depending upon both human interventions and natu- ral processes. In our species the capacities for innovation, par- ticularly through the technological extensions of human actions, are obviously different from other aspects of nature by large orders of magnitude. Does this give us a clue to the nature of the Deity? Hartt's quotations from 1: 270 and 1: 271 have the outcome that he straightforwardly states - a denial of traditional doctrine. What is denied is that the central focus of the divine activity is the human good. What is still affirmed is that, to use Hartt's words, God is "knowingly in the good-making business." I can begin a brief defense with a traditional biblical and Christian assertion that all the creation is good. But I ask im- mediately, "Good for what?" or "Good for whom?" In the in- terdependencies of life in the world - the natural and the historical - the realization of what is good for some is necessar-</page><page sequence="29">696 SOUNDINGS James M. Gusta/son ily at the cost of what is good for some others. To spell this out one has to talk about goods, in the plural, and not the good. To revise a sentence of Hartt's, the concatenation of causal factors requires often the elimination of some entity's "good" for the sake of others. I find little to disagree with as Hartt expounds in his inimitable way the place of the human as a "hell-raising" and "heaven-aspiring" creature in this complex nexus of order and contingency in nature and in human affairs, including our participation in nature. I eschew any use of the word perfec- tion because I do not know what the criteria of it are. As I indicate in the book, I find it plausible to say with Thomas Aquinas and Edwards that man's final and ultimate end is to glorify God. I certainly have not developed a good argument for that, but it is the alternative that best fits what I have written. Some words of Hartt's that have long caused me to ponder are not far from my own position, though he arrives at them by different paths. "The Christian life is a resolute pursuit of ways in which to glorify God. For that, faith furnishes clues - not, certainly, a detailed map. Intuitive certainty is properly lodged in that moment of faith in which one says, 'I know that I must start from x.' Thereby, the projectile called Christian existence is aimed and launched. But its trajectory is not predetermined. The determination of that is a function of a complex series of contingent choices." (Theological Method and Imagination [New York; Seabury Press, 1977] 107.) Hartt points out in his review here that the leit-motiv for Spinoza is necessity: "there is not place for a counterpoint named possibility." Neither of us is in Spinoza's camp. Hartt's x is different from mine. Among the reflections his essay evokes which I should de- velop more rigorously or further are two. First, I take recourse to the tradition and to piety to affirm an Orderer of the order- ing, but I reject those sources with reference to giving us se- cure knowledge of the Divine intentions. The instability of my raft, as John Reeder called my work, occurs because the three weightiest parts of it, the Christian tradition, human experi- ence, and the sciences, seem not to have a center of gravity to keep the raft afloat. Which of them, Hartt might be asking me (as others have), authorizes the use of the other two and deter- mines their relationships? Have I used each one with the same</page><page sequence="30">Response to Hartt 697 grade of authority throughout, or has their function in my work altered depending on what I am addressing? Am I in trouble if they have altered? Second, his concern for the emergence of human intelligence and creativity suggests that I could move on to develop more fully a theology of culture. In so doing I could well return to an article of Hartt's that I have never forgotten on five types of theology of culture (Review of Metaphysics 6 (1952-53):501-09). The theme that has to be developed more is human innovative- ness in nature and culture. I would focus in culture on both the arts and technologies. With reference to the latter my focus would be on the abiding power of nature to render its "wrath" on technological activities that are not kept within limits, i.e. on the adverse consequences to life, including human life, from failing to formulate principles of limitation in the control by humans over nature. My development would have a considera- ble similarity to Hans Jonas, The Imperative of Responsibility. "Proper Service of God." In this section Hartt continues to probe and develop issues raised previously. He aptly chooses quotations from 2: 293 and 2: 298, summarizes them in his own words, and asks, "Can anything further be said about the direc- tion God 'intends'?" I avoided writing about a divine purpose, and wrote instead about purposes. These purposes can be inferred from the or- dering of life and even the cosmos. Hartt is correct to point out that "creating," etc., strongly suggest end-directed process. Again, I prefer the plural, ends. If his sentence, "For none is enhanced unless all enjoy the enrichment of being" is meant to indicate what I argue, it is not accurate. Nor does it agree with what is clearly attributed to me a bit later: "the constitutive ambiguity of the moral life says as much about the objective situation as it does about the inescapable motive-and-intention of the moral agent." If consciousness could be attributed to plants and animals, they would have a sense of the tragedy of existence; some must die and be destroyed for others to live. God, unfortunately, did not create and does not order all things so that the good of each is in harmony with the good of every other, and even the good of the whole. This can be said to be the central theme of my four chapters of examples: mar- riage and family, suicide, population and nutrition, and the al-</page><page sequence="31">698 SOUNDINGS James M. Gustafson location of biomedicai research funding. Cosmological theories about the finis of our planet cannot be securely de- fended, but they are convincing enough to be taken seriously. In the long, long distant future life as we know it and our spe- cies as we know it will be destroyed, if not destroyed earlier by human folly. (Theologians seem to be quite willing to account for the sci- entific interpretations of the beginnings of things as we know them, but are reluctant to take account of worthy proposals by geophysicists and other about the ends, both telos and finis, of all things.) Hartt's statement in terms other than mine about the man- date of "special agents" is basically correct. But for me the in- exorable commingling of "good for" and "evil for" make a binary choice too simple. (I have asked my Roman Catholic colleagues for years why we are giving only a principle of double effect. Why not at least fourteen effects?) In any family the provision of resources necessary to provide opportunities for one child often requires deprivation of resources to an- other. The deprivation is not intentionally evil, but the dimin- ishment is not good for the deprived one. Such common sense observations are important for me. God is the source of human good but not its guarantor. Ambiguity is construed as uncertainty in "special agents" but it is the correlate of finitude, objectively. (I believe my inter- pretation of the moral situation has significant similarities to that developed by Martha Nussbaum's The Fragility of Goodness.) Our capacities as special agents is only one locus of the ele- ment of indeterminacy within the constraints of probabilities in the world. Hartt's language is not my own; his redescription of my work locates issues in places and ways I did not. I can only attempt to state what I wrote in terms that Hartt provides. The actual provides the conditions for the possible, but also the lim- itations. What issues in events, both "natural" and "human," is grounded in these conditions. The possibilities are not sim- ply ignorance of proper cause; prospectively (at least) there are recombinations of what is actual. It is not "determined" that an organism expands into an ecological niche by some overall purpose or even by causal necessity; it happens and various outcomes ensue. In the sphere of special agents, our capacities</page><page sequence="32">Response to Hartt 699 enable us to be conscious of exercising various powers to direct the outcomes of such recombinations as they proceed to de- velop. Human agents are not predestined instruments of a Di- vine will and power. Whether my restatement of a problem in the terms Hartt poses it in the end agrees with Hartt's conclu- sion about what I have done, I am not certain. Hartt moves on to provide a Jamesian alternative. He is cor- rect that in my view proper service of God requires participa- tion in the process of ordering and even "redeeming" life in the world. But that participation needs often to take the form of intentional non-participation, of forbearance. Life is a joint- venture not only of God and humans but also of plants and animals. Why have I not affirmed creativity more than I did? We would have to specify various creative ventures by special agents. Creative technology, for example, sustains human or- ganisms that ought to be permitted to expire. The creativity of symbol manipulators through the mass media shapes valua- tions by humans that destroy or distort what I would argue are proper human aspirations and relationships. Creativity, with- out due consideration of many other things, is as ambiguous as is resignation to actuality. I say these "downside" things while affirming what Hartt wrote about envisioning new environs. Writings by Hans Jonas, Melvin Lasky and others on the perils of Utopian visions are one source of my convictions about re- straints on creativity. The limits of control, the unintended consequences of cumulative events - these make me ponder. I am not certain that I have fully grasped all the subtleties of Hartt's paper, and know that I have not satisfactorily re- sponded to many I am sure I have grasped. Two deep convic- tions motivated my book. A religious conviction is that, as Calvin said about the Christian, it is with God we have to deal in every aspect of life. This is a matter of lived experience for some, maybe odd, human beings. A disciplinary conviction is this: theological ethics ought to be grounded in an interpreta- tion of God and God's relations to all things. The great his- toric figures in the Christian tradition have always done this; indeed, the separation of "Christian ethics" from theology in a strict sense is historically rather novel, but fortunately it has not completely won the day.</page><page sequence="33">700 SOUNDINGS James M. Gustafson Hartt's paper takes both of these convictions seriously, and focuses particularly on the cognitive issues. It is not up to Hartt or any of my critics to resolve the difficulties in my work. By using Spinoza as a kind of foil, he has penetrated issues in ways different from other critics.</page></plain_text>
