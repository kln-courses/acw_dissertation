<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE YAHWIST ON THE FLOOD by DAVID L. PETERSEN Urbana, Illinois The Yahwistic epic has long been held in high esteem as the most artful narrative presentation of early Israelite traditions.l) The stories evince an excellence comparable to the best in ancient literature, an excellence tacitly admitted even by those who wished to supple- ment the Yahwistic accounts. Even though the priestly redactor placed his account of creation at the beginning of Genesis, he allowed the Yahwistic creation story to follow in all its anthropomorphic splendor. The Yahwist's ability to describe the ambiguity and complexity of the human situation continues in the narratives about Cain, Lamech, the vineyard, and the tower, and in each of these units the Yahwist's picture was allowed to stand as an integral whole. Only in one major narrative block did a redactor splice the priestly narrative with the Yahwistic account, the deluge tradition.2) Further- more, when the Yahwistic portions of the flood story are isolated, we discover not a vibrant description of violence, storm, and sea- manship, but a lifeless, chronological skeleton of the flood traditions.3) It is of course possible that some of the J account has been lost or omitted because of duplication with P. Nevertheless, I contend that, in the preserved material, the Yahwist is not plying his narrative skills as best he is able. Hence two obvious questions arise: what was it about the Yahwistic flood narrative that caused the Priestly redactor to interweave his own account into it; and why did the Yahwist narrate the flood account less masterfully than was his custom? This brief study will attempt to answer these literary and redaction-critical 1) See the standard commentaries as well as P. Ellis, The Yahwist (Notre Dame, Ind. 1968). 2) That such splicing is unusual and uncharacteristic has also been observed by M. Noth, Uberlieferungsgeschichte des Pentateuch (Stuttgart, 1948), pp. 268-70 (E. Tr. History of Pentateuchal Traditions, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1972, pp. 249-50), and n. 648. 3) Contrast here the Gilgamesh epic's (XI 43-47) delight in providing Noah with an ironic and foreshadowing explanation to his fellow townspeople.

Hence he decreed a plague to diminish the volume of the noise made by man. Fortunately, Atra-hasis learned of this decree from Ea/Enki who forthwith revealed the proper propitiatory ritual, an offering to Namtara, goddess of death and the underworld and apparently in charge of the plague, whereby the plague was lifted. Enlil, still unable to sleep, then decided upon a drought and famine to limit humanity's noise. Again Ea/Enki revealed another ritual, this time an offering to Adad, god of the thunderstorm, and the drought was lifted. After considerable debate in the divine council, the gods, apparently including Enki, agreed with Enlil to send a flood in order to accomplish Enlil's original purpose. But, as before, Ea disclosed the plan to Atra-hasis (this time surreptitiously since he had sworn to abide by the council's decision) so that Atra-hasis built the ark and survived the deluge. The narrative ends with a post-flood sacrifice scene at which Enlil angrily complains that Enki has again foiled his plan to create "total destruction," though, implicitly, the plan in part succeeded: there must have been less noise. This scene is however not the end of the text. The writer continues with an account of the institution of certain death-dealing classes in society, women and demons, classes which probably symbolize some sort of archaic population control.5) Hence this text presents the flood episode as a narrative about struggle: Enlil versus 4) For a brief synopsis of the deluge accounts from a history of religions perspective, see R. Simoons-Vermeer, "Mesopotamian Floodstories; a com- parison and interpretation," Numen 21 (1974), pp. 17-34. As for study of the theological significance of the flood and the saving of one individual, I can only agree with Westermann when he said, ,,Hier steht die Forschung erst am Anfang." C. Westermann, Genesis 1-11 (Ertrdge der Forschung 7) (Darmstadt, 1972), p. 84. 5) So G. Kirk, Myth. Its Meaning and Functions in Ancient and Other Cultures (Cambridge, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1971), pp. 90-103, understands unlimited fertility to be a problem which Sumerian myths addressed as well.

PETERSEN Enki, unlimited fertility and growth versus a limited human popu- lation. In Tablet XI of the Gilgamesh epic, the writer is much less clear about the motivation for the flood, "When their heart led the great gods to produce the flood..."6) Just as in the Atra-hasis epic, Ea/Enki reveals Enlil's plan to man (now Utnapishtim) with the result that an ark is built and humanity survives the flood. At the post-flood sacrifice, Enlil and Enki quarrel, with Enki issuing the following retort: How could you, unreasoning, bring on the deluge? On the sinner impose his sin, on the transgressor impose his transgression (XI 179-181). Such a response implies that the flood was designed to punish man for his errant ways. Enlil, apparently resigned to man's having survived his attacks after Enki's upbraiding, stipulated that Utnapish- tim and his wife were to become like gods, i.e. they were, unlike other men, to have an unlimited life span. And it is this theme, death versus immortal life, a Leitmotiv which unifies the Gilgamesh poems, which serves as a reason for including the flood story in the larger Gilgamesh collection, since Gilgamesh could not escape death as had Utnapishtim before him.7) Both Mesopotamian flood accounts therefore present traditions about a flood designed to rid gods of the noise or sin of mankind.8) Nevertheless, mankind survives by dint of one god's (Enki's) contra- vening the order of another (Enlil). Furthermore, both epic authors have designed the flood episodes to fit their own purposes, in the one, to reflect on the limitation of population, and in the other, to consider the finitude of man. II The longer of the Biblical accounts, the Priestly version, holds that, not just man, but the entire cosmos was corrupt and evil. Hence not simply a violent thunderstorm (so J), but a destruction by means of cosmic waters was required to right matters (Gen. vii 11). Further- 6) ANET2, p. 93, 1. 14. 7) Cf. Kirk, pp. 132-52, on the theme of culture versus nature as the central issue in the Gilgamesh epic. 8) I do not accept Pettinato's contention that rigmu, "noise," in the Atra-hasis epic, signifies a human challenge to the gods.

For P, the flood is a return to the pre-creation state described in Gen. i; hence with the end of the flood, P recommissions Noah using the same language as that in Gen. i, "Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth." The post- flood state is therefore a new creation, the cosmic waters have been tamed again; and consonant with this new beginning, man is given a dietary supplement, the provision of flesh, and a legal principle of individual retribution is propounded. The focus of P is on a new beginning guaranteed by a divinely-initiated covenant; the flood is, thereby, a terribly important episode for P. Nevertheless, it is with the Yahwist's version that we are directly concerned, and here the key to our questions lies in the prologue and epilogue to the deluge account.9) In Gen. vi 5-8, the Yahwist depicts a scene of utter wickedness; every part of man's plans was evil. Yahweh decided that the flood was necessary to destroy men and all non-aquatic life because of rampant violence. Only Noah was fortu- nate to have been chosen by Yahweh.10) Moving to the epilogue, we face both an exegetical and a conceptual problem. Yahweh is described as reacting to man's sacrifice and explaining to himself why he will never again curse the ground and destroy all life. Strikingly, the reason given for no future total destruction is virtually the same as the reason given for the flood in Gen. vi 5. Gen. vi 5 wekolygser mahiebot libbo raq ra' kol hayyom "every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually." Gen. viii 21 ye ser leb had ddm ra c minne'urdyw "the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth." 9) Wolff has argued that Gen. vi 5-8 and viii 20-22, so-called "bridge-passages," are crucial for discerning the Yahwist's purposes. H. Wolff, "The Kerygma of the Yahwist," Interp 20 (1966), p. 136. Westermann, too, understands these texts as Yahwistic expansions upon an earlier narrative core. C. Westermann, Genesi. 1 (Neukirchen-Vluyn, 1974), pp. 546 if. Cf. R. MacKenzie, "The Divine Soliloquies in Genesis," CBQ 17 (1955), pp. 157-166, on the nature of Yahweh's vocal ruminations. 10) In the Tetrateuch, the idiom "to find favor," mdsd' hen becne' PN/DN rarely if ever denotes a moral quality on the part of the person who is designated as having found favor.

PETERSEN The reason for an end to punishment is the same as the reason for punishment in the first place. R. Rendtorff does not accept this interpretation of Gen. viii 21; he contends that the just-cited clause refers back to Yahweh's decision to impose the flood and does not refer to Yahweh's post-flood assessment of mankind. Since Rendtorff's translation and analysis of Gen. viii 21 differs radically from that proposed here, I propose to treat several detailed issues in dialogue with his position. (1) He translates the crucial clause as follows, "I will no longer designate the earth as accursed (leqallel) [as I have done before] on account of mankind because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth and I will never again destroy every living thing as I have done." 11) This translation depends upon a distinction Rendtorff wishes to make between the meaning of the roots, qll and 'rr; lo' 'osip leqallel is not translated "I will never again curse." 12) To be sure, qll (piel) is often used to mean "view as accursed," "insult," or "revile," whereas 'rr is more strictly limited to mean "curse," especially when Yahweh is the subject of the verb. Nevertheless, both roots are used to describe Balaam's "cursing," (Josh. xxiv 9; cf. Gen. xii 3). Furthermore, in Dt. xxviii 15, 45, the nominal form, qeldldh is used to summarize the covenant curses as they follow in the standard 'drur formula. Finally, both the verbal and non-verbal forms of qll may be used in parallel with brk, which is also the case for 'rr. Hence, for Rendtorff to argue that qll may not signify a curse is stretching the point.13) (2) Whether or not a firm distinction may be made between 'rr and qll, Rendtorff has overlooked an important nuance in Hebrew syntax, the ysp + infinitive clause.14) This construction, which designates repeated activity, may denote either continuous or discontinuous 11) R. Rendtorff, "Genesis 8:21 und die Urgeschichte des Jahwisten," Kerygma und Dogma 7 (1961), p. 69, and M. Clark, "The Flood and the Structure of the Pre-patriarchal History," ZAI 83 (1971), pp. 204-209, who accepts many of Rendtorff's arguments. 12) On the use of qll and 'rr, see J. Scharbert, "'rr," in G. J. Botterweck and H. Ringgren (ed.), TWAT, cols. 446-447, and H. Brichto, The Problem of "Curse" in the Hebrew Bible (SBLMS 13) (Philadelphia, 1963). 13) Cf. Clark, "The Flood and the Structure of the Pre-patriarchal History," p. 207, n. 97, and W. Schottroff, Der altisraelitische Fluchsprucb (WMANT 30) (Neukirchen-Vluyn, 1969), pp. 29-30. 14) On the idiom, see Joiion ? 177b, and 0.

Wolff (Munich, 1971), p. 529, n. 14. 442</page><page sequence="6">THE YAHWIST ON THE FLOOD repeated activity. Because of his interpretation of qll, Rendtorff assumes that the construction in Gen. viii 21 means the former, a continuous viewing of the earth as accursed. However, such a decision must rest on the presence or absence of '6d in the idiom. jsp + infinitive may indicate either continuous or discontinuous action whereas ysp + infinitive + ''d regularly denotes repeated and yet discontinuous activity, cf. BDB, 729b, e.g. Gen. xviii 29 wayyjsep 'od ledabber "he spoke aga'n," whereas Gen. vi 12 lo' tosep tgt "it shall no longer yield." Therefore, Rendtorff's translation of this idiom including ''d as meaning a continuous action of Yahweh is highly unlikely. Rather the more traditional "I will never curse again...." is to be preferred. (3) Rendtorff rather prejudices the discussion when he designates the clause, "for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth," as an afterthought (NachsatZ) to the main clause.15) Rendtorff contends that this clause is parallel with the clause, "as I have done," and therefore must be interpreted as referring to Yahweh's past action. Hence, the clause "for the imagination..." must also refer to the past and not to a present motive for prohibiting more destruction; i.e. one should understand the first clause to read "as I have done because of man." One may only respond to Rendtorff by stating, the parallel- ism asserted in Rendtorff's reconstruction of the Nachsdite (or B:B' in Clark's terminology) 16) is simply not as synonymous as the parallelism in the main clauses. The perfect verb ('adjft) in B' suggests completed action, i.e. the flood, whereas the nominal clause (ki... minne'urayw) implies a continuing condition, the reason for no future flood.17) Yahweh is depicted as giving the reason for no future flood and then more fully depicting what the flood was, a violent destruction of all life because of men. (4) Rendtorff is quite correct in observing that just as Gen. viii 21 echoes vi 5, so also viii 21 picks up, with the exception of qll for 'rr, the language of Gen. iii 17: Gen. iii 17 'arzrah ha'adamah bacabrekd Cursed is the ground because of you Gen. viii 21 loz 'osip leqallel 'cd et ha'admiah ba'abzr haadaim I will never again curse the ground because of man. 15) Rendtorff, p. 73. 16) Clark, p. 206. 17) For a further critique of Rendtorff's position, see Steck, pp. 527-531. 443</page><page sequence="7">DAVID L. PETERSEN It appears as if the Yahwist is, in Gen. viii 21, using the language of the curse on Adam to describe the flood, because, to use Rendtorff's logic, the second colon which refers to the destruction of all life, a clear reference to the flood, must be used to interpret the first colon. To see the flood itself as a natural result of cursing the land is not really to move beyond the Yahwist's intent.18) For the reasons given above, I reject Rendtorff's contention, ,,Das Urteil uiber den Menschen wird nicht revidiert; aber die Aussage hat an dieser Stelle kein eigenes Gewicht." 19) Yahweh's negative assessment of mankind is in fact reiterated and for a reason. If, therefore, Gen. viii 21 repeats the motive given in Gen. vi 5, what does this synonymity of motive for two conflicting actions mean? I suggest the Yahwistic narrator realized that the flood had not functioned as Yahweh had intended it. It had neither wiped out man or animals nor had it rid mankind of his propensity for evil.20) The Mesopotamian accounts could explain an ineffective flood by depicting two divinities in conflict, one subverting the plan of another. The Yahwist however did not have this conceptual apparatus available, nor did he follow the priestly ploy of making the flood into a cosmic episode.21) Hence the Yahwist struck out on a path different from the other versions. For the Mesopotamian and priestly accounts, man and his condition had somehow changed radically after the flood, i.e. either the survivor had gained immortality, or Yahweh had made a covenant with him. For the Yahwist, post-flood man was the same as pre-flood man, evil from the day of his youth. The flood was therefore, in the Yahwist's eyes, an ineffectual ploy, a 18) Cf. similarly, Steck, p. 529. 19) Rendtorff, p. 74. 20) Cf. Noth's comments, Uberlieferungsgeschichte des Pentateuch, p. 257 (E. Tr., p. 237). 21) Westermann also recognizes the problem facing the Yahwist: "Hier wie dort steht dahinter die Frage nach dem unbegreiflichen Gegensatz im Handeln des Gottes, der die Menschen schuf, und des Gottes, der die Menschen vernichtete; aber an die Stelle der polytheistische-mythische tritt bei J die das Einssein Gottes voraussetzende Antwort: der Zwiespalt zwischen den Gottern wird zu einem Zwiespalt in Gott" (Genesis, p. 549). Such internal discord is, according to Westermann, typical for a person, and the Yahwist describes Yahweh as if he were a person (p. 548). This ploy allows Westermann to make sense of Gen. vi 6. Yahweh was sorry that he had made man. Yahweh is like Enlil. But Westermann cannot so easily explain Yahweh's immediately taking on the character of Ea-Enki, the god who acts to protect mankind. If as Westermann contends, the Yahwist uses a kind of anthropomorphism to depict God, the Yahwist depicts a schizoid god; there is little evidence of oneness. 444</page><page sequence="8">THE YAHWIST ON THE FLOOD segment of the primeval history which had to be narrated because it was authoritative tradition,22) but not one which was to be built on a major scale as the priestly writer had done. The cosmic guarantee in the priestly version (Gen. ix 1-17) is integral to this version of the flood story, whereas the Yahwist's poetic guarantee, Gen. viii 22, is more a Gezer-calendar-like appendage.23) In the very next Yahwistic episode, Noah is depicted as drunk, lying naked in his tent, and as a father who curses his progeny. I find this picture more important than the putative easing of the curse on the land, Noah's ability to till the ground and receive of its fruit. For the Yahwist, the human propensity for the wrong act continues.24) Does this apparent criticism of Yahweh's action make sense? May one expect an ancient Israelite writer to have leveled such an indict- ment at his God? Criticism of divine activity was not foreign to Israel's neighbors,25) hence we should expect to find similar attitudes in Israelite society as well, a society in which the Yahwist's realism was a likely source for such a critique. To expect a flood to cleanse man was unrealistic, to assume that man could be anything other than sinful from his youth was unrealistic. That is to say the Yahwist understood Yahweh's plan, either utterly to rid the universe of man or to create a sinless man, as unrealistic or incongruous with the universe as he understood it. This incongruity between what one might expect from Yahweh and man and what actually happened allows us to understand the Yahwist's style. Such incongruity is the hallmark of irony, here tragic irony. As E. Good puts it, "... irony 22) As Westermann observes, the Yahwist usually sticks very close to his sources, (p. 786). 23) I find Rendtorff's and Clark's interpretation of this verse as a radical anti- fertility cult piece or as expressing the idea of new creation unconvincing. Follow- ing Steck (p. 530), Gen. viii 22 is not, form-critically, a blessing. The guarantee of continuity as long as the earth lasts is simply a guarantee against future flood-like destruction, during the flood there was, presumably, no seedtime nor harvest, no cold nor heat, no summer nor winter, no day nor night. Yahwistic blessings may be seen in Gen. xii 1-3. 24) So similarly, G. von Rad, Das erste Buch Mose. Genesis (5th edn., Gottingen, pp. 1958) 127-9 (E. Tr. Genesis, Philadelphia, 1961, pp. 148-50), and Steck, on the constancy of human error in the primeval history. 25) Criticism of the gods may, as well, be implicit in both the Atra-hasis epic (Moran, "Atrahasis: the Babylonian Story of the Flood," p. 60) and in the Gil- gamesh epic (B. Landsberger, City Invincible, ed. C. Kraeling and R. Adams, Chicago, 1960, p. 98). Landsberger's comments are particularly interesting since he postulates an academic atmosphere as the setting for such a critique, a setting which has also been postulated for the Yahwist. Cf. E. Fisher, "Gilgamesh and Genesis: The Flood Story in Context," CBQ 32 (1970), pp. 392-403. 445</page><page sequence="9">PETERSEN, THE YAHWIST ON THE FLOOD is criticism, implicit or explicit, which perceives in things as they are an incongruity." 26) The Yahwist perceived such an incongruity between the flood story and his understanding of the human situation and of God and thus was unwilling to treat the flood episode as an important part of the Israelite epic. Because he viewed one god as responsible for both flood and rescue, an attempt to narrate the ancient Near Eastern flood traditions fron the Israelite perspective, was problematic and the Yahwist treated this attempt with ironic detachment. III If this assessment of the Yahwist's perspective on the flood is correct, we are now in a position to answer the two questions raised earlier. Why did the Yahwist fail to do justice to the flood story?- -because he thought it to be a divinely ineffectual ploy. The flood had solved nothing; it neither blotted out humanity nor washed them of persistent evil. Why were the P and J accounts interwoven?-be- cause the J -account was a lifeless narrative, and by itself, a radical challenge to the great purpose which the P writer attributed to the flood. P synthesized J with his own account, a version of the flood which had a definite goal: recreation and the establishment of the covenant. MacKenzie may be correct in arguing that, in these solilo- quies, the Yahwist "convey the essence of his own lofty theological doctrines," 27) but his was a doctrine at loggerheads with not only the Mesopotamian flood accounts but with the Priestly version as well. 26) E.
