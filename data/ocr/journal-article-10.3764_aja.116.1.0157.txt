[AJA 116 the elites of Umm el-Marra inscribed their ideology  on the landscape of the community by establishing a  monumental funerary complex on a high point in the  middle of the settlement.6 Veneration of high-ranking  ancestors allowed for the strengthening and natural- izing of the authority of living persons of high social  status, who used the past as an instrument of power.  The importance of elite ancestor veneration implied  by the intramural aboveground tomb complexes at  Umm el-Marra and other sites in western Syria sug- gests the centrality of kin relations in the structuring  of local complex societies in that region.7 In the 2006 and 2008 field seasons, expanded exca- vations in the Umm el-Marra Acropolis Center collect- ed further evidence on the uses of the past and social  memory.

Preliminary analysis indicates that the tomb contained  at least two adults.12  Under the collapsed mudbricks inside the tomb  were disarticulated human bones, smashed pottery,  and large stone boulders strewn haphazardly, some  with human bones resting on top.

This  pattern involved two diagonal lines crossing each oth- er, extending from the shoulders to the widest point  on the hips. A necklace at the figure’s throat formed  a horizontal element above, while often a horizon- tal line at the hips marked the pubic triangle below.

Kirkbride suggests convincingly that the vertical lines  ending in hooks in this picture were stakes to which  a net was attached to trap the onagers, which would  have been chased toward it by the hunters.64 That the  same or a very similar technique was still used in the  third millennium B.C.E. can perhaps be inferred from  a text from Sargonic Umma that mentions 201 “ropes  of (=for?) onagers (?)” received by a fowler.65 Since  a fowler catches birds, which are not easily captured  with ropes, perhaps these so-called ropes were really  nets. A pertinent glyptic comparison can be made with  two sealed bullae found in an Akkadian context at Tell  Brak bearing inscriptions recording the delivery of  kungas by an official named Rabi-il.66 Both have a seal  impression showing five horizontal guilloche bands,  a design that Matthews assigns to the so-called Brak  Style.67 Although this is not the “lattice” (or “net”) pat- Fig. 15.

Perhaps the artists who produced the designs  attested at Umm el-Marra were familiar with such styles  through an intermediary channel such as the large  centers of Tell Brak and Tell Chuera, both of which  have extensive evidence of glyptic art influenced by  southern Mesopotamian models.

The shepherd  is often represented with one (or both) arms raised;  frequently, a weapon, a lion, and one or two animals  indicate the flock.74 This is exactly the subject depicted  on the EB III sealing UMM04 G-001 (fig. 17).75 A man  at the right raises both arms; left of him are a spear- head and a dagger, and to the left of those is a lion with  its body oriented vertically and its four legs extended  horizontally to the left, where there are traces of an  additional figure, presumably an animal that the lion  attacks. This “defense of the flock” scene continues  into EB IVB, where it occurs on impressions on sherds  and tags and on seals at Umm el-Marra, Tell Chuera,  and Selenkahiye.76 In the impressions on sherds from  Umm el-Marra and Selenkahiye is a mixture of Syrian  elements (the man with the raised arms, the weapon)  and Mesopotamian elements (animals that rear up  on their hind legs or are upended onto their forelegs  by an attacking lion). These animals ultimately derive  from animal contest scenes on Early Dynastic seals in Fig. 17. Seal impression on sherd from EB III context (draw- southern Mesopotamia.

To the right of the lion are the  hind quarters of another hoofed quadruped, which  are oriented upside down in relation to the lion.79 Al- though the impression is quite worn, the head, fore,  and hindquarters of the goat are clear. The lion is also  discernible and seems to have a thick head and neck  and a squarish muzzle. The details and stances of the  lion and goat have their closest comparisons on sev- eral seal impressions from Tell Chuera. On these, the  lion and goat have their heads in profile. The lion’s  head is rather square, and his mane is sometimes not  suggested at all or suggested just by the thickening of  his neck.80 Two examples show a lion and a goat cross- ing at approximately the same angle, as on UMM08  G-006.81 Four of these impressions date to near the end  of the EB IVA period.82 The motif of two quadrupeds  whose bodies cross derives ultimately from southern  Mesopotamia, where it is very frequent in the so-called  Crossed Style of the later Early Dynastic II and Early  Dynastic III periods.83 As on the Chuera impressions,  the crossing animals rear at about a 45° angle, and  their heads are in profile. Sometimes a lion is crossed  with an herbivore and sometimes with another lion.  But the Chuera impressions differ from the southern  ones in several ways: the lions have square muzzles,  short forelegs, and no manes, and the compositions  are less crowded. These details suggest that the Chuera  seals may represent a local tradition or “school” of seal  carving, and it was probably this local tradition that Fig. 18.

Current analysis reveals that centers in drier environ- mental zones (e.g., Chuera, Rawda, Banat) were more  seriously affected than others, and Umm el-Marra may  take its place in that group.146 The subsequent regen- eration of urban life at Umm el-Marra included at least  two large-scale construction projects at its inception— the acropolis enclosure wall and Monument 1 inside  it—indicating that the reoccupation of the site was a  substantial affair that may have taken place under di- rection from central authorities. Since the polities of  Middle Bronze Age Syro-Mesopotamia were generally  ruled by individuals of Amorite ethnicity and/or with  personal names in the Amorite language, it is likely  that Amorites were also influential or dominant at  Umm el-Marra.147 The construction of Monument 1 directly above  the elite tombs of the third millennium may imply an  invocation of social memory by Middle Bronze Age  authorities, harking back to their predecessors in a  distant but hallowed past. Alternatively, the construc- tion of the monument could have functioned to seal  off evidence of that past to emphasize the novelty of Fig. 28.

These statuettes  can be simplified to the point of being only a plain  head and a square body, and they vary considerably  from site to site, suggesting that they are products of  local craftsmen.160  UMM08 G-007 (fig. 29) is a fragment of an unbaked  clay bulla that has part of a seal impression on its  outer, convex side and an impression of two crossing  strings on its inner, concave surface, suggesting that  the bulla was sealing a knot of a container secured  by string.161 As preserved, the impression shows two  scenes. To the left are two couchant goats that turn  their heads back toward one another. Their hind ends  merge with a standard that has two wings with vertical  parallel hatching to depict feathers. Above the top of  the standard can be seen the bottom of a supine quad- ruped facing left. To the right of this scene are two  antithetical suppliant goddesses162 with an “inverted  pine tree”163 between them.
