Mortality due to leukemia among 4483 women treated with radiation to control uterine bleeding between 1925 and 1965 was twice as high as expected based on U.S. population rates (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 2.0; 95% confidence in- terval (CI): 1.4 to 2.8). Women were followed for an average of 26.4 years. Relative risk was highest 2 to 5 years after treatment (SMR = 8.1) and among women over 55 years at irradiation (SMR = 5.8). The usual method of treatment was intrauterine radium. Average radiation dose to active bone marrow was esti- mated on the basis of original radiotherapy records (median, 53 cGy). A linear dose-response model provided an adequate fit to the data. The average excess relative risk was 1.9% per cGy (95% CI: 0.8 to 3.2), and the average absolute risk was 2.6 excess leu- kemia deaths per million women per year per cGy (95% CI: 0.9 to 4.8). Chronic myeloid leukemia predominated during the first 15 years following exposure, whereas acute leukemias and chronic lymphatic leukemia were most common thereafter. The radiation doses experienced during treatment of benign gyneco- logic disease appear to result in greater leukemia risk per cGy average marrow dose than the considerably higher doses used to treat malignant disease, perhaps because of a decreased likeli- hood of killing potentially leukemic cells. ? 1990 Academic Press, Inc. tors such as age at exposure, and possible differences among subtypes of leukemia. A recent study of women irradiated for cervical cancer (2) substantiates the view that risk of leukemia is an increasing function of radiation dose to active (red) bone marrow up to a certain level, but that risk declines at higher doses, perhaps because of the killing of potentially leukemic cells (3-7). Consistent with this view is the finding of greater leukemia risk among women given lower dose pelvic radiotherapy for benign gynecologic disorders (BGD)3 (7-9) than among women treated with higher dose radiation for cervical can- cer. These previous studies of BGD patients, however, were too small to be informative about dose-response relation- ships or the modifying effects of age and time since expo- sure. To evaluate further the leukemia risks associated with relatively low average marrow doses, we extended the fol- low-up of a previously studied cohort from Massachusetts4 (7) and enrolled a new group of BGD patients from Rhode Island. METHODS Study Population and Sources of Information Women of known age were irradiated at specified hospitals (Appendix A) for benign pelvic disease between 1925 and 1965, resided in Massachu- setts or Rhode Island at the time of treatment, and were not known to have had a cancer of the genital tract diagnosed prior to radiotherapy for BGD. INTRODUCTION Epidemiologic studies of irradiated populations have largely moved beyond the question of whether ionizing ra- diation causes leukemia and now seek to examine the oc- currence relation in greater detail (1). Specific topics of in- terest include the shape of the dose-response relationship, the magnitude of risks at low doses, the influence of dose fractionation on radiation risks, the modifying effects of fac- ' Current address: Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Executive Plaza North, Suite 408, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892. 2 Private consultant; Route 1, Box 148D, Huddleston, VA 24104. 3 Abbreviations used: AL, acute leukemia; ALL, acute lymphatic leuke- mia; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; ATB, at time of bombing; BGD, be- nign gynecologic disorders; BSF, backscatter factor; CI, confidence inter- val; CLL, chronic lymphatic leukemia; CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; E, expected number of deaths; FS, field size; HVL, half-value layer; ICDA8, eighth revision of the International Classification of Diseases, adapted for use in the United States; kVp, peak kilovoltage; LL, lymphatic leukemia; mg-h, milligram-hours; ML, myeloid leukemia; NOS, not other- wise specified; 0, observed number of deaths; P(I) and P(2), one- and two- sided P-values, respectively; PY, person-years of observation; RR, relative risk. 4 J.

Searches of surgical, radiotherapy, and medical records yielded a total of 4483 eligible BGD patients. An earlier paper (7) documented the pre- 1967 mortality experience of 1802 of these women. Their follow-up is extended through 1984 in the present analysis. The experience of the other 2681 women is reported here for the first time. The present study popula- tion includes only the Massachusetts subgroup from the earlier study; it does not include the cohort of women who were irradiated in Connecticut. Attempts were made to locate hospital medical records to obtain infor- mation on BGD diagnoses and treatments, medical history, demographic data, and personal identifiers. Charts were examined for 3222 women (72%). For 559 women, only copies of the medical record abstracts from the prior study were available. Five hundred-fifteen women from the ear- lier study could not be reidentified by name, because old study records were destroyed by a flood. This group was known only from a computer listing that included each patient's first and last name initials, date of birth, date and type of radiotherapy, last known vital status, date of last known vital status, and cause of death. The only source of baseline information for 187 of the newly studied women was their radiotherapy record. Dosimetry Typical radium treatment plans called for the deployment of 25- or 50- mg radium capsules, in some combination usually totalling 50 to 100 mg, in the uterine cavity or cervical canal. Radium needles (2 or 3 mg each) were used occasionally. Capsules typically were filtered by 0.5 mm silver and 1 mm brass during early years (circa 1930) and, later, by 1 mm plati- num (10). Radium needles were filtered by 0.5 mm platinum (11). Treat- ment times varied from 2 to 144 h, but 71% of the implants were for be- tween 12 and 24 h. Radium treatments ranged from 28 to 6900 mg-h, with 76% between 1000 and 2400 mg-h. The median radium treatment overall was 1500 mg-h. Most of the X-ray treatments were given according to one of two treat- ment plans, which were described by Wagoner:4 "The first treatment plan consisted of an incident dose of between 600 and 1200 rad to each of two parallel opposing fields, one anterior and one posterior, each measuring 15 X 15 cm. The second plan called for an incident dose of between 500 and 800 rad to each of 4 pelvic fields, two adjacent anterior and two adjacent posterior, each field measuring 13 X 20 cm. The entire course of radiother- apy was administered in two or three fractions at 200 or 250 kVp." Larger field sizes (20 X 20 cm) were sometimes used. Data on BGD radiation treatments were photocopied from medical rec- ords or records from the prior study and sent to collaborating medical phys- icists at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Active bone marrow doses were estimated using the same procedures as were used for a large international study of cervical cancer patients (2, 12). Treatment data were converted to organ dose estimates for individual pa- tients on the basis of experimental measurements using anthropomorphic phantoms. Phantoms consisted of human skeletons and artificial soft tissue designed to simulate radiation absorption of lungs and muscle. Thermolu- minescent dosimeters were placed throughout the skeleton. Doses were estimated for 14 active bone marrow compartments, and mean marrow dose was calculated as a weighted average of these site-specific doses. Each anatomic compartment was weighted in proportion to its presumed contri- bution to total active bone marrow, using the distribution of active bone marrow given by Cristy (13). Estimated marrow doses do not include doses from radiotherapy for can- cer or other non-BGD medical exposures. One hundred forty-one women were known to have been irradiated for other conditions in addition to their radiotherapy for BGD; of these, 117 were treated for cancer. None of the women whose deaths were attributed to leukemia was known to have had a prior cancer or to have received radiotherapy for any condition other than BGD. Follow-up Close of follow-up was January 1, 1985, except for the 515 women whose records had been destroyed and for whom no additional tracing was possi- ble; close of follow-up for these women was January 1, 1967. Tracing meth- ods4'5 included searches of state and national death records, birth and di- vorce records, municipal directories and driver license records, and link- ages with credit bureau files and Health Care Financing Administration files of past and present Medicare recipients (1967-1988). The U.S. Post Office address correction service also was used. Cause of Death Coding Death certificates were coded by trained nosologists. Cause of death was assigned according to rules prevailing at the time of death and recoded to the eighth revision of the International Classification of Diseases, Adapted for Use in the United States (ICDA8) (14). For 213 deaths known only from the computer listing for the previous study, the cause of death code given on the listing was recoded to ICDA8. Hematology Review Histologic confirmation was sought for all hematologic cancers (ICDA8 200-209) reported on death certificates. Medical record data pertinent to these cancers, including copies of pathology, hematology, or autopsy re- ports and relevant clinical notes, were reviewed by a consulting hematolo- gist (William C. Moloney, M.D.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) to evaluate possible misclassification among diagnostic categories and to classify more exactly cancers that were described imprecisely on death certificates. Hematology slides were not obtained. Analysis Years at risk were counted for each woman from the date of index radio- therapy (earliest treatment by which the patient was eligible to be ascer- tained) until the earliest of the following dates: close of follow-up (January 1, 1985 or January 1, 1967), date of death, date lost to follow-up, or nineti- eth birthday. If a woman died, was lost to follow-up, or turned 90 within a given year, with the exact date unknown, a midyear date was assigned. If a woman had been treated with radiation for BGD prior to the index treat- ment, the earlier treatment was used to mark the time and age at first treat- ment, but accrual of years at risk began as of the index irradiation. Years at risk for individual women were pooled in order to evaluate the group experience, measured in person-years (PY). Person-years were separated by race (white or nonwhite) and distributed over 5-year age and calendar year of observation intervals for age groups 10-14, 15-19, .... 80-84 and years 1925-29, 1930-34, ..., 1980-84. Women of unknown race were assumed to have been white. Expected numbers of deaths (E) for different causes were computed by multiplying the cause-specific death rate for the U.S. general population for each race x age X calendar year stratum by the observed number of PY for that stratum and then cumulat- ing the expected values over all strata. Mortality rates for subtypes of leuke- mia were available only for years after 1956; average rates for 1957 to 1959 were used for years prior to 1957 for these categories. Standardized mortal- ity ratio (SMR) was defined as the ratio of the number of deaths among patients "observed" (0) to the expected number of deaths, E. 0 was treated as a Poisson random variable, and E was assumed to be known without error. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for SMRs were computed according to a method described by Liddell (15). Standardized mortality rate difference (SMD) was defined as the difference between 0 and E, di- vided by the number of PY. Arithmetic was done with the aid of a modified 5 P. D.

All analyses that com- pared the mortality experience of these women with that of the U.S. popu- lation used the cause of death codes that were assigned by study nosologists solely on the basis of death certificate information. Codes were not amended on the basis of results of the hematology review. Poisson regression models (I 7, 18) were used to estimate radiogenic leu- kemia risks for women treated by intrauterine radium. It was assumed that radiation could not be the cause of any leukemia death that occurred within 2 years of exposure. Therefore, regression analysis was restricted to experience occurring 2 or more years following the first radiation treat- ment. Women who had BGD radiation treatments in more than 1 year or had radiotherapy for cancer subsequent to their BGD treatment were included in analyses for 2 years following the second treatment, unless death or loss to follow-up intervened, and all of their years at risk were assigned to the dose from the initial treatment. The risk of death due to leukemia was assumed to depend on attained age, calendar time, BGD radiation dose to the active bone marrow, and possible dose effect modifi- ers, such as age at irradiation and time since irradiation. Numbers of leuke- mia deaths in each stratum of a cross-classification defined by these vari- ables6 were assumed to be independent Poisson random variables, with expected values equal to the product of the stratum-specific mortality rates and the corresponding observed numbers of PY. Observed numbers of PY were treated as known constants. Models were fitted in which the radio- genic risk was assumed to act either multiplicatively or additively with the background risk. Background hazards were assumed to be given by age- and calendar time-specific U.S. mortality rates, which were assumed to be known without error. Maximum likelihood methods were used to fit the models. The tabulation of PY and fitting of models was done with the aid of the programs PYTAB and AMFIT (17). The deviance, a measure of unexplained variation (18), was used to assess the relative goodness-of-fit of different models. The difference between deviances for two nested models is distributed, asymptotically, as a chi-square variate with degrees of freedom equal to the difference between the numbers of estimated pa- rameters in the two models. Likelihood-based 95% confidence intervals were calculated for parameters in the regression equations that were used to estimate excess relative and additive risks. RESULTS Study Population Most of the women in the study population were white and between the ages of 40 and 59 at the time of BGD irradi- ation (Table I). Nearly 85% of the radiation treatments oc- curred between 1930 and 1949. Most women were pre- menopausal, and a majority were experiencing some form of abnormal uterine bleeding, such as menorrhagia, metror- rhagia, or postmenopausal bleeding. It is likely that the ir- regular bleeding for some of the premenopausal women was symptomatic of an impending menopause. Common BGD diagnoses included hyperplasia or dysplasia of the endome- trium, proliferative endometrium, secretory endometrium, endometritis, chronic cervicitis, cervical or endometrial polyp, and uterine fibroid(s). The usual modality of radio- 6 The following categories were used.

Dosimetry Estimated average doses to different parts of the active bone marrow for a woman of average size are shown in Ta- ble II for representative radium and X-ray treatment plans. Dose was relatively high to marrow in the pelvis, the upper legs, and lumbar vertebrae and much lower to marrow in the chest, head, neck, arms, and lower legs. Dose was non- uniform even within the pelvis, especially dose from radium treatments. External-beam X-ray therapy generally yielded higher doses than did radium implants. Radium doses were due to y rays; a and A particles would have been absorbed by the source filters and applicators. The median average total marrow dose was 53 cGy.

The average interval of follow-up was 26.4 years, yielding a total of 1 18,289 PY of observation. Patterns of Mortality Sixty-one deaths were attributed to cancers of hemato- poietic or lymphatic tissue, of which 34 were leukemias (Ta- ble III). This is twice the number of leukemias that would have been expected based on U.S. mortality rates. Data are reasonably consistent with relative excesses as small as 40% or as large as 180%, on the basis of the 95% CI. The observed number of deaths due to all causes nearly equaled the corre- sponding expected number. Deaths attributed to cancer, however, were in excess by 30%. Leukemia accounted for 1 1% (17/155) of this excess. Under the extreme assumption that all women lost to follow-up survived until the end of the predefined risk period (close of follow-up or ninetieth birthday), the SMR for leukemia dropped to 1.7 (95% CI: 1.2 to 2.4). Two women had been diagnosed with leukemia prior to their BGD radiation treatments. The diagnosis on the death certificate of both patients was leukemia; one died due to lymphatic leukemia (LL) 3.9 years following irradiation and the other died due to myeloid leukemia (ML) 4.1 years after the BGD treatment. Review diagnoses were chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), respectively. These women were included in the analysis so that direct comparisons with U.S. mortality rates could be made. Overall results were similar for newly studied patients and patients from the previous study. Seventeen leukemia deaths were observed during the total period of follow-up of the present study among women identified previously, versus 8.8 expected (SMR = 1.9). The corresponding num- bers for the newly studied patients were nearly identical to these (O = 17, E = 8.4, SMR = 2.0). Among radium-treated patients, the SMR for leukemia generally increased with increasing dose to active bone mar- row (Table IV). Standardized mortality rate difference (SMD) estimates increased regularly over the first four of five levels of dose among women treated with radium only, but fell slightly for the highest dose category (Table IV). Es- timates of the excess risk per cGy in the different dose cate- gories fluctuated around 2.9 deaths per 106 PY-cGy and were consistent with a constant risk per cGy. The SMR for leukemia was highest during years 2 to 5 after irradiation (P(j) for years 2 to 5 versus years 5+ &lt; 0.01), but an excess was still apparent more than 30 years after irradiation (Table V). Exclusion of the two women whose leukemias were diagnosed prior to their BGD radiotherapy lowers the SMR for the second interval (years 2 to 5) to 4.8 (95% CI: 1.0 to 14.1). The other four deaths that occurred within the first 5 years occurred 1.4, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1 years after irradiation. The SMR for leukemia increased from 0 for women who were 13 to 34 years old at the time of irradiation to 5.8 for women age 55 or older when treated (Table V). The in- crease was progressive across categories of age at exposure. Age at exposure was inversely associated with time under observation (equivalent to time since irradiation) and posi- tively associated with mean bone marrow dose.

The increases were accompanied by an increasing secular trend in mean marrow dose from radiotherapy and in the average age at irradiation. The excess of leukemia deaths was not seen at age at ob- servation under 50 but otherwise was not restricted to women in a particular age or calendar time at observation interval (Table V). The only strong suggestion of a depar- ture from uniformity of the SMR was for the earliest inter- val of calendar time (1925-1939). The large SMR (8.3) is based on only three cases. None of the three women was diagnosed with leukemia prior to irradiation. By definition, this interval included primarily early postirradiation experi- ence; this was when the first women were being irradiated, and a maximum of 15 years since irradiation could have elapsed. Specific histopathologic types of leukemia were reported on 21 of the 34 death certificates. Of these, 7 were AML, 6 were CML, 2 were ALL, and 6 were CLL. In addition, there were four cases of acute leukemia, not otherwise specified. (NOS). SMRs were elevated for each of four subcategories of leukemia (Table VI). All deaths attributed to CML oc- curred within the first 15 years following irradiation, and most of the early excess leukemia mortality was due to CML. Deaths certified to AL and CLL + LL occurred more frequently during the later postirradiation intervals. Varia- tion in SMR with time following irradiation was similar for AL and CLL + LL. A high SMR among women age 55 or older when irradiated was seen for the category AL + CML + ML (O/E = 4/0.89 = 4.5) and also for CLL + LL (O/E = 3/0.47 = 6.4). Figure 1 shows the relationship between the SMR and average marrow dose for radium-treated pa- tients, separately for subcategories of leukemia and for all leukemias combined. Data are too sparse to identify differ- ences in pattern between subtypes. The nine deaths attrib- uted to CLL or LL occurred among women with average marrow doses greater than 50 cGy. Other studies have not shown CLL to be increased following radiation exposure. Unfortunately, mortality rates are not available to separate CLL from LL in our analyses. We note, however, that the observed number for CLL alone exceeds the expected num- ber for CLL plus LL, and that CLL generally is more com- mon than ALL in the age range involved in this study. Hematology Review Adequate medical records for a hematology review were obtained for 43 of the 61 hematologic cancers and for 21 of 34 leukemias. Of the 21 leukemia cases with adequate materials for review, 9 were assigned a different diagnosis. In 6 cases, the change was simply to a more precise classifi- cation: from leukemia of unknown type to CLL (n = 2), from LL to CLL (n = 1), from AL to AML (n = 2), and from ML to CML (n = 1).

The crude estimate of the excess RR was 1.9% per cGy (95% CI: 0.8 to 3.2), which translates into an estimated RR at 100 cGy of 2.9. The additional models addressed factors that might have influenced a dose-response relationship. Models that in- cluded age at irradiation and time since irradiation as dose effect modifiers (models 9-1 1) improved the fit of the linear dose-response model. The improvement due to adding a term for time since irradiation to the model that already included age at irradiation was marginal (P(I) = 0.07), but time was included in the final model because of a prior be- lief that the RR for leukemia decreases with time following irradiation after the first 5 years. Calendar year of irradia- tion was associated with the SMR (Table V), but inclusion of this modifier did not improve the fit of models that in- cluded a dose term. Terms for age and calendar year of ob- servation also failed to improve the fit, as would be expected given the absence of associations with the SMR in the crude data (Table V). Regression coefficients for time since expo- sure (P(l) = 0.35) and age at exposure (P(2) = 0.28) terms were not significantly different from zero when the analysis was restricted to periods 5 or more years following irradia- tion, but an age at exposure by time since exposure interac- tion could not be identified in these data.

Analysis was restricted to the 4060 radium-treated women for whom marrow doses could be estimated and excluded the first 2 years following irradiation. a Comparison of deviances for models 2 to 4 indicates the presence of an association between excess relative risk and average marrow dose and also suggests that U.S. mortality rates adequately represent the back- ground hazards for these BGD patients. h Based on comparisons of deviances for models 5 to 8, these data pro- vide no evidence of positive or negative curvature in the dose-response relationship. cComparison of deviances for models 9 to 11 and model 5 shows that inclusion of age at exposure and time since exposure as dose effect modi- fiers improves the fit of a linear dose-response model. d Excess RR = (b* DOSE)*exp[b*(AGERX-45)]*exp[b*ln(TIME/ 10)]; parameter estimates (with 95% CI): dose (cGy): b1 = 0.01818 cGy-t (0.00476, 0.04046); age at irradiation (years): b2 = 0.06117 year-' (-0.00194, 0.1291); time since irradiation (years) b3 = -0.7051 (-1.766, 0.3234). coefficients 5 years following irradiation for women ages 35, 45, and 55 years at exposure were 1.6, 3.0, and 5.5% per cGy, respectively. The corresponding coefficients at 10 years postirradiation were 1.0, 1.8, and 3.4% per cGy. An excess additive risk model also was fitted for the radi- um-treated women. The crude estimate of the linear dose coefficient was 2.6 excess leukemia deaths per million women per year per cGy (95% CI: 0.9 to 4.8). The final model included a product term for mean marrow dose and age at exposure. With these two variables in the model, time since irradiation added little additional descriptive power. Fitted excess additive risks for women ages 35, 45, and 55 years at irradiation were 0.5, 1.6, and 5.2 deaths per 106 PY- cGy, respectively. When analysis was restricted to acute, myeloid, and monocytic leukemias and based on models that did not constrain the SMR to be 1.0 at zero dose, the crude estimate for the excess RR was 1.2% per cGy (95% CI: -4.1 to 6.5), and the average excess additive risk was 1.2 deaths per 106 PY-cGy (95% CI: -1.3 to 3.6). DISCUSSION Women treated with radiation to control uterine bleeding were found to be at a twofold risk of dying from leukemia relative to women in the general U.S. population. Patterns of variation in risk with respect to time since irradiation and radiation dose implicate the radiation exposure as a con- tributory cause. Although it is possible that women who suffer from dysfunctional bleeding are at an increased risk of leukemia independent of their radiation treatments, the regression analysis suggested that U.S. mortality rates ade- quately represented the background hazards for this popu- lation, and our estimates of excess relative and absolute risk are consistent with those found in other studies. Still, the unanticipated excess of deaths certified to CLL + LL, plus the small numbers of leukemia deaths in the various sub- groups examined, give reason for caution in the interpreta- tion of our results. The following discussion considers these issues in greater detail, and compares and contrasts our findings with those for other irradiated populations. Time since Exposure The pattern of variation in the SMR for leukemia with time following irradiation resembled that for the odds ratio (incidence of AL plus CML) among irradiated cervical can- cer patients (2) and for the SMR due to all leukemias among irradiated ankylosing spondylitis patients (19). In each case, the estimate of the rate ratio was highest during the first 5 years following irradiation and markedly lower in later in- tervals. The observed rate ratio among the cervical cancer patients dropped abruptly, to 1.1, after 5 years and re- mained low thereafter, though the data were reasonably consistent with an RR as high as 3.0 for the second 5 years. The SMR declined more gradually among the spondylitis patients and appeared to stabilize at an elevated level after 12 to 15 years. The SMR 15 or more years after irradiation was 1.9 (O/E = 14/7.5). The possible contribution of drug therapy to the excess could not be excluded. Among the atomic bomb survivors, the temporal distribution of excess risk for AL and CML depended on age at time of bombing (20). Excess risk appeared later and lasted longer the older the people were ATB. For people 45 years or older at the time of exposure, risk increased after about 10 years and remained elevated even 20 to 25 years after exposure. The excess for CML preceded that for AL for most age at expo- sure groups. For the BGD patients, the observed SMR dropped sig- nificantly after the first 5 years but was still elevated after 30 114</page><page sequence="9">LEUKEMIA AFTER PELVIC RADIOTHERAPY to 40 years of follow-up. In fact, half of the excess leukemia deaths occurred more than 15 years following irradiation. There was a qualitative change in type of leukemia over time, from CML to AL and CLL. The shifting predomi- nance from CML to AL is consistent with results for the atomic bomb survivors, but the CLL results are not. Age at Exposure The increasing trend in the SMR with age at exposure, which was apparent even after adjusting for dose and time since exposure, is opposite to the trend observed among cer- vical cancer patients (2). Those data showed higher odds ratios among women younger than 55 years when irradi- ated than among women 55 or older. However, the esti- mates of risk for cervical cancer patients were based on small numbers of nonirradiated leukemia cases and are im- precise. Among the spondylitis patients (19), the SMR in- creased with increasing age at irradiation for acute myeloid leukemia, but not for all leukemias combined. Among the atomic bomb survivors, for whom follow-up began in 1950, the most striking finding for age at irradiation was the high RR among children (21, 22). There was a suggestion of an increase in RR with increasing age at exposure between the ages 40 and 60 years, but the association was not well de- fined. Absolute risk, however, did increase with increasing age at irradiation. The association between the SMR and age at irradiation in the present study was strongest during the first few years following irradiation and also was based on small numbers. Radiation Dose, Risk Estimates The possible effects of radiation dose and modality were not separable in this study; most of the high-dose patients were irradiated with X rays. X-ray treatments involved frac- tionated doses, delivered over a period of several days or, sometimes, weeks. Dose from radium treatments usually was accumulated within a 12- to 24-h period and at a con- stant dose rate. Also, the anatomic distribution of dose to different parts of the active bone marrow and lymphatic tis- sue differed between radium and X-ray treatments. The dose-response relationship for leukemia might depend on modality of treatment. Risk estimates from studies of irradiated BGD patients are summarized in Table VIII. These populations differed in the usual method of radiotherapy, average marrow dose, and length of follow-up. Average marrow doses were higher for women irradiated by external-beam therapy than by in- tracavitary radium. However, excess relative and absolute risk estimates, expressed per cGy, were higher among women irradiated by radium (approximate P(2) for excess RR = 0.03). Results from any one study are too unstable to demonstrate clearly the shape of the dose-response rela- tionship or to define the relative effect of treatment by ra- dium versus external-beam X rays. Efforts are underway to combine results from different studies of BGD patients (23) and do a more powerful analysis. Women who were irradiated for cervical cancer were twice as likely as nonirradiated patients to develop AL or CML (2). This excess was associated with an average active bone marrow dose of 720 cGy (excess RR = 0.1% per cGy average marrow dose; 90% CI: 0.0 to 0.4). Among cervical cancer patients irradiated only by radium (average dose 270 cGy), the excess RR was 0.4% per cGy (90% CI: 0.0 to 1.4). When Boice et al. (2) modeled risk in terms of dose to bone marrow compartments, thus accounting for the heterogene- ity of bone marrow dose and allowing for competing effects of leukemia induction and cell killing, they obtained higher estimates of the RR at low doses. The coefficient for the linear induction term in a dose-response model that in- cluded a linear term and an exponential term (to account for cell killing) in dose was 0.9% per cGy. Unlike the esti- mates in terms of average marrow dose given above, this estimate is for uniformly irradiated marrow. At low doses, where little cell killing occurs, this parameter approximately equals the excess RR. On the basis of the fitted model for cervical cancer patients, the effect of cell killing appeared to be small for pelvic exposures delivering mean marrow doses of 100 cGy or less. Most women who were treated with ra- dium for BGD received average marrow doses well under 100 cGy. Our point estimate of the excess RR for death due to AL + CML + ML (1.2% per cGy), unstable though it is, is similar to the estimate of 0.9% per cGy reported by Boice et al. for leukemia incidence among cervical cancer pa- tients. The risk of radiogenic leukemia per unit average marrow dose indeed appears to be higher among women irradiated for benign gynecologic disorders than among women treated with much higher doses for cervical cancer. The hy- pothesis that this difference is attributable to less killing of potentially leukemic cells in the BGD patients than in the cancer patients offers a plausible explanation (2, 4, 6, 7). Differences between risk coefficients for BGD patients irra- diated by radium and those treated by external-beam X rays, if real, might be attributable to more cell killing among the X-ray patients, who received substantially higher mar- row doses. The excess RR estimates (death due to all leukemias) for radium-treated BGD patients are similar to corresponding risk estimates for the atomic bomb survivors (Fig. 2), for whom radiation exposures were nearly instantaneous, and dose to different parts of the active bone marrow was ap- proximately uniform. Preston et al. (22) estimated the ex- cess RR for atomic bomb survivors who were age 20 years or older at the time of the explosion to be 2.3% per cGy, 115</page><page sequence="10">116 INSKIP ET AL.

Even if radium treatments of patients with BGD killed relatively few marrow cells, one might expect radiation from the atomic bombs to have been more effective at inducing leukemia, per cGy average mar- row dose, because of the much higher dose rate. However, the high dose rate might also have made the A-bomb expo- sure more effective at cell killing, which would tend to lower the leukemogenic effect. Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia A nearly universal finding in other studies of leukemia occurrence in relation to radiation exposure is the absence of an excess of CLL (1). This type of leukemia is not thought to be caused by ionizing radiation. For example, in the spondylitis series, death certificate diagnoses included only two cases of CLL among 36 fatal leukemias (E = 2.38) (19). Similarly, CLL was not excessive among survivors of the atomic bomb explosions in Japan, where the disease is rare (25). Boice et al. (2) reported 52 cases of CLL among irradi- ated cervical cancer patients, but no association with radia- tion was found. In the present study, most of the excess of leukemia deaths was among the types of leukemias that are thought to be caused by radiation, namely, the acute and nonlymphocytic leukemias. However, an excess of 4 to 5 deaths certified to CLL + LL also was observed. This might have occurred by chance. It also is possible that women who sought care for BGD were under closer medical surveillance than the U.S. population as a whole, and that CLL, an indo- lent malignancy, was detected more frequently. Alterna- tively, CLL and LL might have been differentially overdiag- nosed among these BGD patients. Hematology review of 21 of the 34 deaths certified to leukemia indicated that some of the deaths may have been mistakenly attributed to leuke- mia. Review diagnoses did not conflict with death certifi- cate diagnoses for any of the acute or myeloid leukemias (AML, ALL, AL, CML, ML), but did disagree for CLL and for LL. In view of the low case fatality rate of CLL relative to other leukemias (26) and the fact that it is predominantly a disease of old age, there clearly is room for differential classification error to have occurred. Uterine Bleeding Disorders and Leukemia Risk The possible significance of the presenting bleeding disor- ders also should be considered. Profuse blood loss might alter the proliferative kinetics of marrow stem cells in a way that renders them particularly susceptible to radiation leu- kemogenesis or leukemogenesis in general. This was sug- gested, on the basis of animal studies (27, 28), but later ex- periments failed to confirm those results (29). Abnormal uterine bleeding in some patients might be indicative of an underlying hematologic disorder (30), rather than, or in ad- dition to, an endocrine dysfunction, and the hematologic disturbance might also place women at increased risk of leu- kemia. A related possibility is that leukemic or preleukemic conditions present at baseline were actually causing the bleeding (31). Progression of preexisting cancers might have contributed to the large relative excess of leukemia deaths during the first few years following irradiation. Of the six women who died with death due to leukemia within 5 years of irradiation, we have baseline hematology data only for the two who were known to have had leukemia at the time of irradiation. Except for indolent forms of CLL, and before any recent therapeutic advances, the clinical phases of most leukemias were quite short, usually less than 5 years (26). Unless one or more of these diseases has a much longer preclinical phase, it seems unlikely that leukemias resulting in death 10 or more years following irradiation for BGD were pres- ent prior to the radiotherapy. Myeloproliferative or lym- phoproliferative disorders, including possible preleukemic conditions (32), were known to have been diagnosed prior to the radiotherapy for only one woman in the study, and her death was attributed to colon cancer. In summary, concerns about internal validity in this study relate primarily to the absence of a nonirradiated comparison group of BGD patients. We cannot determine the extent to which confounding associated with the pre- senting gynecologic disorders or noncomparability in the ascertainment of outcome have biased the results. The slight excess of deaths certified to CLL + LL raises concern about a possible upward bias in our risk estimates. Data in- terpretation, and the credence one attaches to risk esti- mates, should allow for this uncertainty. However, interpre- tation also should consider the patterns within the data and relevant results from other studies. Given that the temporal distribution of excess risk resembled that for other irradi- ated populations, that a dose-response relationship was suggested by the present data, and that similar risk estimates (by modality of radiotherapy) were observed in other stud- ies of irradiated BGD populations from different geographic areas, including mortality studies in Scotland (9) and En- gland (8), and an incidence study in Connecticut (7), hypo- thetical explanations for the data solely in terms of these putative biases become more convoluted. If the association is due to bias, it is a recurring bias, one that is closely cou- pled to having, seeking care for, or being irradiated for these gynecologic disorders, and somehow associated with dose. A more parsimonious explanation is that a considerable part of the excess leukemia mortality is attributable to the radiation treatments. 117</page><page sequence="12">INSKIP ET AL.
