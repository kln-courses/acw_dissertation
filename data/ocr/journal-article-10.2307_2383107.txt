<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Japanese legacy THE JAPANESE UNIVERSITY STUDENT CONFRONTS RELIGION PART Il by ALPHONSE M. NEBREDA I F we wish to understand both the areligious and antireligious attitude of Japanese youth, it is absolutely essential to penetrate the surface of the culture to which they are heirs. The students themselves have shown us the road to follow by virtue of the many references made to tradition in their writings. It has been said many times that atheism inJapan today is the result of the legacy left by the impact of the West when it opened the eyes oftheJapanese people and made them gaze with astonishment and curiosity upon the modern age of the mid-nineteenth century.1 What has already been explained in the preceding two articles is quite sufficient, I believe, to indicate how much truth there is in this statement. From the time the last European landed on Japanese shores until the historic appearance of Commodore Perry's 'black ships' in the Bay of Urawa, an immense secularization process had come about in the West. However, in the 250 years of complete isolation, Japan, for her part, had experienced a parallel process, although independently from Europe-in fact, it was an even more radical secularization than that which had taken place in the West. This in itself accounts for both the ease and the rapidity with which the forgers of the new Japan understood intuitively and assimilated the spiritual climate of twentieth-century Europe in its wave of optimistic advancement. As a matter of fact: The builders ofthe modernJapanese State-politicians and educators such as It6, Okubo, Itagaki, Okuma and Fukuzawa-were typical representatives of a coolly pragmatic and thoroughly secularized reason. They brought down the Toku- gawa regime and its semi-feudalistic order, but they did so in the name of the rationalistic principles and the practical discipline they had learned in the hard samurai schooling of the same regime. They instinctively understood the mood 4 THE AUTHOR is Professor of Religion at Sophia University. He studied at the Gregorian Univer- sity in Rome (D.D. I96I), where he also taught.

For Europe too, since its last appearance on the shores of Japan, had undergone a process of secularization. It had perhaps not been as thorough as that ofJapan, but it was sufficiently advanced to create a fapade behind which to conceal many of the still-alive spiritual values of the West. Yet more decisive for subsequent developments than too abrupt and too large a dose of the nine- teenth-century brand of Western materialism have been the secularistic and progressivist prejudices of the Japanese themselves. Ever since Meiji, the Japanese have extended the distrust of their own past to the spiritual traditions of Europe and thus, while roaming the Western world in search of the new, have usually overlooked what, even if old, is equally needed to overcome a crisis which, in its essentials, the West shares with the East.2 Once the pattern had been set, subsequent generations followed it closely. Speaking of the men who, after the First World War, went to various Western countries for further education, and who were responsible for the formation of present-day Japan, Dr. Tanaka Kotaro has expertly drawn a picture of an atmosphere which influences Japanese intel- lectuals to this day. They were nurtured in an atmosphere of positivism; their method of study was far too confined, analytical and exclusive to permit them to think about the theme of their studies in relation to external circumstances, and their position in connection with an integral picture of the material and spiritual world. They became relativists or sceptics in their studies of morality; they became analytic and antimetaphysical in their study of the law; in the political field their attitude was completely empirical, materialistic and amoral. For them, critical spirit meant nothing more than antireligious spirit. The popularity of the neo-Kantian phi- losophy for a few years after the First World War can be attributed to the fact that this way of thinking satisfied the young Japanese. They wanted a vaporous sort ofideology, a philosophy based on abstracts, coupled with a desire for a scientific method; that is to say, a positivistic and materialistic philosophy.3 Such a change from traditional religious and moral ideals to the state of emptiness which characterizes modern Japan and constitutes its tragedy4 came about with hardly any resistance at all, due to the fact that this systematic and rigorous secularization process had sapped all the strength from the roots of former ideals. 2 Joseph Roggendorf, 'The Place of Religion in Modern Japan,' 7apan Quarterly, I958, v, pp. 27-28. 3 K6tar6 Tanaka, 'Lo sfondo spirituale della cultura giapponese moderna,' in Walter Gardini, ed., Asia per Cristo.

'The Japanese legacy' 33 Professor Roggendorf has on many occasions given us a brilliant description of this secularization process5 that had come to a full circle in Japan by the middle of the nine- teenth century. I have already mentioned that, in general, various Japanese thinkers who had taken it upon themselves to answer him in the magazine Kokoro were in agree- ment with the exactitude of his diagnosis. Therefore, we cannot do better than give the complete summary which he has made of his own analysis. The quotation is somewhat lengthy but it makes very worthwhile reading. Religion has always sat lightly with the Japanese. Sir George Sansom has said of the early centuries, when theJapanese were absorbing the first powerful religious influences from abroad, that 'the terms of Indian metaphysics became a kind of fashionable jargon, Buddhist rites a spectacle, Chinese poetry an intellectual game.' Even the genuine zeal generated by the religious revivals ofthe thirteenth century did not pervade national life for long. The new sects fell out with each other, as had the earlier denominations since the Nara period, and only con- tributed to the pluralistic chaos. Both Mahayana Buddhism and the native Shamanism which it encountered were extremely accommodating world- views, and the ease with which they interpenetrated each other must early have fostered the idea that religious commitment was a matter of subjective choice if not of unpredictable chance. Nevertheless, as one contemplates the masterpieces of ancient and medieval religious art, one is deeply moved by the obvious faith which must have animated culture centuries ago, and one asks oneself why this inspiration should have ceased so completely and at a date so much earlier than in Europe. I have neither expert knowledge nor definite views on the subject, but I suspect that the emphasis of Buddhism, at any rate ofJapanese Buddhism, on the epistemological character of salvation, the insistence on the demasking of an illusory world as the way to deliverance, has something to do with it. This preoc- cupation leads to a variety of speculative systems that may be fascinating and even spiritually elevating but cannot, it would seem, satisfy the profound re- ligious urge of ordinary individuals. A distinction is then established between religious truth as valid for the ordinary populace and that for the elect and the characteristic dichotomy is, as it were, legalized. With almost iconoclastic fervor, Japanese Zen rejected all sutras, images and systems. But Zen, I think, contributed its own peculiar share to the secularization of the Japanese mind, 5 'La crise de la civilization japonaise,' Le Bulletin des Missions, I949, XXIII, pp. 234ff.; 'Die Kirche in Japan.

I cannot help thinking that Zen, ever since the time of the Golden Pavilion, has moved in this direction and I wonder whether the remark of Professor Kitamori Kaza, that the poetry of Bash6, usually considered Zen- inspired, is in effect 'sentimentalized aestheticism' and as such 'not religion but a substitute for it', does not also apply to other Zen creations. Nor is it surprising that the cultural policy of the Tokugawa regime, which has left such indelible traces on the national character, should also have in- fluenced Japanese concepts of religion. The shogunate ruthlessly suppressed Christianity and the Ikko confraternities and emasculated the Buddhist sects by strictly regimenting their status and their activities. The Tokugawa court philosophy was the positivistic and pragmatist Shushi version of Confucianism. It provided the common people with a practical code of behavior, although it hardly affected their beliefs and, in the long run, was unable to check the dif- ferent set of moral standards which the rising merchant class evolved on its own. But Shushi Confucianism did largely fashion the thinking of the intellectuals. If one reads the records of the interrogation of Padre Sidotti-who landed in Japan during the Seclusion and later died in prison-by the scholar and Toku- gawa official Arai Hakuseki, one is in the presence of a rationalist agnostic who finds it incredible that his obviously learned protagonist should sincerely believe in such absurdities as the Creation or the Fall. The intellectuals who prepared the Meiji Restoration were of this mind, and there seems to have been little differen- tiation in secularistic outlook between the adherents of the conservative Na- tional School CKokugaku9 and the progressives of the Dutch School CRangaku9. From the encounter of these men with the West the new Japan was born.6 If we study the testimonies given in the preceding articles, beneath them and merging with them we can feel the presence of harmonics which remind us of the tonal atmosphere of eighteenth and nineteenth-century Europe. Now we must press our analysis deeper and point out that running beneath everything, at least to the ear familiar with tradi- tional Japanese themes, there is always an unmistakable bass chord, often muted, which indicates the key. This key is purely Japanese. Therefore, we can understand how each of the themes introduced into Japan from the Meiji era had already been prepared by some characteristic features ofJapanese cultural history. In the pages that follow, we shall proceed from i) the confusion in religious matters which shows itself time and again in the testimonies of our students and also in the idea which the average Japanese has of religion in general, to analyze, within a framework 6 1X1 *. Roggendorf, 'The Place of Religion in Modern Japan,' pp. 26-27.</page><page sequence="5">N E B R E D A. 'The Japanese legacy' 3 5 suggested by Doi Masatoshi7 the various components which in this regard are inter- mingled in the Japanese mind. Thus we shall see 2) the lack of any concept of the Absolute, which we intend to study in conjunction with the lack ofmetaphysical ideology and agnosticism which appear systematically to cut off any attempt to reach that Absolute. Then we shall seek out 3) the consequences of this relativism in the Japanese religious outlook: relativism, pragmatism, an immanent conception of religion;pluralism merging into a unique tradition of syncretism; tolerance and compromise; the living remains of animism fostered by a resurgence of superstitious beliefs. All these elements are dammed up in 4) a typically irrational attitude which is the well-known Japanese sentimentalism Ckimochi9. In this context it will be fitting to say one or two words concerning the Japanese logic which is impregnated with such a sentimentalism. (I A CHRONIC STATE OF CONFUSION THE READER will have observed this state of confusion from reading the numerous testimonies previously set down. If 3000 expressly say that they do not have a clear view of religion, it is no exaggeration to say that practically all the young people in their writings reveal traces of this chronic state of confusion that characterizes the Japanese religious scene. Wherever we examine the situation in Japan, we find the same state of confusion. Many examples have been quoted already so that only a few more pertinent examples here will suffice to stress the point. For instance, in the questionnaire of the Catholic Committee the following question was asked: Ifyou believe in the existence of God, what sort ofperson do you think he is ?8 Creator of heaven and earth 27.3% A man of impeccable conduct 9.4% COkonai no tadashii hito)8 Don't know I5.9% Never thought about it 7.7% No reply 39.7% I think this example reveals just how thick the mist is which surrounds the minds of these young people. If we look at the percentages in the sections of 'No reply', 'Don't know', and 'Never thought about it', a Westerner would be tempted to ask this ma- jority-who were not able to give the most elementary explanation as to what they 7 Doi Masatoshi, 'Nihon ni okeru fukuin to shoshuiky6 to no sesshoku.

But it would be too much to ask any Japanese born and raised in an atmosphere of complete confusion to answer this question.9 It is enough to read the chapter dedicated to the concept of God in an interesting collection of articles that have appeared in the daily Asahi shimbun: Aimai na kotoba (Ambiguous Words)10 to see that this confusion has deep roots in the cultural history ofJapan. The continuous pressure brought to bear on religious belief by the Tokugawa regime that lasted for 250 years is a most important factor.11 Bellah, in his thesis on religion during the Tokugawa period, has examined the situation very deeply and shows how this regime was responsible for the thorough secularization process which came about in Japan.12 Let us quote a few of the most pertinent passages: Religion supplied a context of ultimate meaning to the central value system through the fact that the primary collectivities in the society-the nation and the family-were conceived of as religious as well as secular bodies. Loyalty to these collectivities and their heads had not only a mundane significance, but also an ultimate meaning; fulfillment of obligation to them was in one sense a re- ligious duty... 13 As a measure to combat Christianity the Tokugawa government required all 9 The late missiologist, Thomas Ohm, in A4sia Looks at Western Christianity, Freiburg, I959, p. 75, has a very pertinent comment on this point: It is not then surprising that the precision of Catholic concepts and the definite and clear character of our doctrines meet with dis- approval. A Catholic Japanese wrote that 'in the East'-and that includes Japan-'ideas are not so precise. Consequently we find it almost embarrassing to have to express things well known to us in terms of Western concepts.' They imply a loss in breadth, depth and free- dom, nor are they applicable to matters alien to us. A European writer was told by Japanese: 'What you intend to write is not exactly wrong, but it is much too rational, much too limpid, much too intellectual, in one word-much too European.' It would indeed be naive to think that this does not hold true any more of modern Japan. In fact Prof. Masutani Fumio i -6Xzt* , in his answer to Roggendorf's article in Kokoro, fully agrees with theJesuit scholar on his stressing of the irrational character of Japanese religion. He goes even fur- tlier to state that the irrational, emotional charac- ter-'as if wrapped up in the ambiguity of mist'- is a distinguishing feature not only of religion but of all the aspects of Japanese culture as well.

'TheJapanese legacy' 37 Japanese to be registered members of some recognized Buddhist sect. This im- plicated a large part of the Buddhist clergy in the social control structure of the Tokugawa state, and made membership in a sect a matter of political obligation rather than religious conviction. This fact has been cited to explain the general lethargy and uncreativeness of Buddhism in the Tokugawa period, though Buddhism had been at low ebb even before i6oo. In any case, it is a fact that the vital religious movements of the age did not emerge from the Buddhists. For most people, apparently, the temple to which they belonged was only visited but rarely on special ceremonial occasions and the major function of the priests was to act as undertakers.14 Subordination of all other elements to politics in Japan during the Tokugawa period included not only science itselfCgakumon), which was considered despicable and incapable of finding an end in itself, but religion as well. It is, of course, impossible to deprive religion entirely of the character of being an end in itself, but there is a tendency in this direction. Or else there is a tendency to fuse the religious end and the secular end, religious values and the secular goal-attainment values.15 One could go on quoting indefinitely. However, it is very clear that the systematic interference of politics in religion not only contributed to a radical secularization in Japan but also to a fundamental confusion in religious matters. It is also significant to note here that there was a tendency to confuse philosophy with religion,16 which accounts for the fact that in the modern Japanese decimal classification for library books, religion is recorded as a subdivision under philosophy. The consequences of this can be seen easily by glancing at the textbooks used in the religion courses in the universities, which are in conformity with instructions given by the Ministry of Educa- tion, and about which we have spoken previously: Begrif' der A4ngst by Kierkegaard, Vom WYesen der TWahrheit by Heidegger, Phdnomenologie des Geistes by Hegel, The Way to Christ by Jakob Bohme, Reden Uber Die Religion by Schleiermacher, Religion and Science by Bertrand Russell, Grundprobleme der Ethik by E. Brunner, Der Philosophische Glaube by K. Jaspers, etc.17 It is not to be wondered at that the students resent this atmosphere of confusion. Let us see how one of them describes the situation which he sees around him and how his point of view coincides almost literally with the article written on Kami (God), in Alimai na kotoba. 14 Ibid., p. 5I. 15 * P. Ibid., p. I6. 16 This can be seen, for example, in the chapter devoted to religion in Hugh Borton, ed., 7apan, Ithaka, ig5i, as W. Schiffer pointedly showed in his review of the book, Monumenta Nipponica, I952, VIII, p. 439. 17 F.

Everything is mixed up: Buddhism, Christianity, myriads of gods Cyorozu no kami-the Shinto pantheon), good and evil spirits ... in fact a complete potpourri. Gods of poverty, gods of ill health appear, etc. etc.... People try to placate them by exorcisms Co-haraiD and supplications (norito).

Thus, the Japanese do not have a correct image of God. They are completely wrapped up in things of this world and do not spare a thought for the next. Today, intellectuals as well as ordinary people are atheists when they feel strong (Jishin ga aru to), but when they feel weak Cki gayomaku naru to make supplications. They are followers of the well- known proverb Kurushii toki no kamidanomi (Go to God when trouble strikes).18 This testimony is doubly valuable, since, apart from describing in most interesting terms the situation which we are studying, it also refers to all the facets which we are trying to discuss in this chapter. However, the central theme is 'lack of a true image of God', whom one cannot treat as a molesting animal (for such are the undertones of the phrase o-inori suru kara itte kure; this expression can only be used inJapanese when referring to an inferior being). Once the idea of God as Absolute is not present, it is logical that everything centers around a pragmatic view such as the lines quoted above eloquently describe. The last phrase, 'today, intellectuals as well as ordinary people' gives us a little more insight into the barrier ofconfusion surrounding religion. It can be said thatJapanese intellectuals are not more enlightened than ordinary people. Someone as intelligent and sincere as Professor Oshima Yasumasa gives in his most interesting article on 7apanese Intellectuals and Faith19 a truly penetrating and honest confirmatory view of the web of contradictions through which the Japanese intellectual has to battle. The whole article should be quoted here so that the reader can really appreciate how deeply these roots of confusion have penetrated, causing the Japanese to hoard up extremes of contradiction in his heart and mind, and forcing him to sally forth without dedicating himself to re- sponsibility in its entirety. The writer begins the article by describing his own particular case; his perplexity on receiving a note telling him that this year was the thirty-third anniversary of his father's death, and that he would be expected to attend the family vault for customary funeral rites, presided over by the Buddhist priests of the temple.... t&lt;40 i; 6t t a+a) t24 Morimoto Tetsuro, op. cit., pp. 270ff. 19 - ih .

'The Japanese legacy' 39 'But,' says the writer, 'I am not going to ask the priests to come and pray, nor invite re- latives and friends to my house for the ceremony, to have them then eat and drink their fill.'20 The writer, having considered seriously his own conflicting views in regard to religion as a result of the incident described, makes a pathetic confession which stresses yet again what we have discussed in previous chapters. I have been thinking what I would leave my sons should I die at this very moment. Apart from a few books and articles, they would find nothing. My writings, even, are only an infantile, insignificant confession of my respect and love for Christ, a proof of my interest in Christianity and of my doubts-that is to say an expression of my inability to believe and yet a feeling of strong at- traction towards Christianity, as well as towards the atheism professed by Nietzsche.21 The author, besides showing most clearly his own religious feelings and intimate experiences, has reflected yet again the confusion and contradiction which characterizes the religious thinking of the 'intellectual' Japanese. His thoughts concerning 'atheism' and the intellectuals are interesting. After having affirmed that 'It is a fact that the majori- ty of so-called "intellectuals" are looking in an anti-religious direction-and I use the word "intellectuals" in its widest sense, so that it embraces students, employees, doctors, technicians etc.,' he states that true atheists do not exist in Japan-apart from a Marxist group with strong convictions. People are obliged to adopt an anti-religious viewpoint because they live in a scientific age and also because they are surrounded by an atmosphere of utter confusion.22 One can see how much truth lies in Professor Oshima's analysis by comparing his views with those of members of the noblest and most spiritual group in Japan. This group produced a most inspired ideology during the Showa period and still holds an honoured place in the Japanese intellectual world today, thanks to its magazine Kokoro, which appeared after I948. We are speaking of the Shirakaba school, so named from the first magazine that was its organ.23 The ideals of this group are defined as follows: In their epistemology they tend to place great importance on meditation and 20 Goedertier, loc. cit., p. 584. 21 Ibid.) p. 5 85. 22 Ibid. 23 In the article on Japanese idealism (Nihon no kannenron E1j*4fot &amp;1I'r) by Kuno Osamu k f45 and Tsurumi Shunsuke JWQftI, Gen- dai Nihon no shiso Qt o). ;t 49 (Modern Japanese Thought), Tokyo, I956, pp. I-28, the Shirakaba-ha X , (Shirakaba School), is singled out as the most outstanding representative of the idealist trends.

Nor does anyone believe in the teachings CkyJriD ofany defined religion. Even Nagayo Yoshio, who has written a kind of religious novel called Takezawa sensei to iu hito (I952), speaks of both Christianity and Buddhism, but strictly speaking he believes in neither. Rather than a belief in religion, his is a belief in the religious belief: shukyJ o shinjiru koto ni taisuru shinki. It is an approach towards religion without becoming fired by any one. Suffice it to say that this is based on a purely sentimental plane, just as popular faith in Japan mixes together 'kami' and 'hotoke' (Buddhist and Shinto divinities) believing in the existence and efficacity of both. We can say that it is another syncretism recast in a different mold for use by the intellectuals (chishikijin muki ni honyaku shinaoshita shinkurechi- zumu9.25 As can be easily appreciated, this is an absolute confirmation of the views expressed by Professor Oshima. It is interesting to stress the importance given by the intellectuals to this syncretism, which is yet another manifestation of the absence of a definite idea of the truth in regard to religion. In his book on religion during the Tokugawa period, Robert Bellah uses as his point of departure Paul Tillich's conception of religion and defines it as follows: By religion I mean ... man's attitudes and actions with respect to his ultimate concern. This ultimate concern has to do with what is ultimately valuable and meaningful, what we might call ultimate value; and with the ultimate threats to value and meaning, what we might call ultimate frustration. It is one of the social functions of religion to provide a meaningful set of ultimate values on which the morality of a society can be based. Such values when institutionalized can be spoken of as the central values of society.26 On this basis, when he comes to describe religion as it appeared in the Tokugawva Period in Japan, the author distinguishes two basic concepts of what is termed divine. One is a 'Superordinate entity who dispenses nurturance, care and love.'27 This is inter- 24 -g - a 4 c D5Ay.

'The Japanese legacy' 4I preted as heaven and earth in Confucianism, Amida and other Buddhas in Buddhism, and kami in Shintoism. This conception is extended to political superiors and parents who are recognized as sacred beings. The corresponding religious attitude is respect and gratitude for favors received and an attempt to respond to these blessings. The other, which is more difficult to explain, is 'the ground of being or the inner essence of reality'. Examples are the Chinese tao Cmicbih, the neo-Confucian li Cri) which is often translated as 'reason'; the hsin Qshin9, meaning heart or mind when it is identified with li; the Buddhist concept of the Buddha-nature; the Shintoist kami in its most philosophical sense. The religious attitude corresponding to this concept is that of reaching a unity or an identification with this ground of being. According to the writer, these two concepts are not to be considered separately but are found to be intermingled everywhere. The tension is solved by the theory of the two levels of truth, the second concept being more profound than the first. Only the most radical exponents of the Zen sect preclude this first concept, while the J5do sect base their faith on it almost exclusively, leaving the door always ajar to take in metaphysical explanations of the second type. Between these two extremes, there exists an infinitely variable gamut.28 In this way, Bellah explains the Japanese concept of nature and of man himself. Nature is something which is included in the two kinds of ultimate religious concern already described. It is like a bridge which connects man and the divine. Man, for his part, is a humble recipient of the favors of divinity, of nature and of his superiors. At the same time, he is also 'divine' and 'natural'-a microcosm of the macrocosms (divinity and nature). He has in himself the Buddha-nature of things, the tao, the li, his conscience being the li. Here we see the fundamental optimism of the Mencius concept.29 The author, following a suggestion ofJohn Pelzel, tells us that we are not to take the unity between man, nature and divinity as something static but as 'harmony in tension'. This is the way religion influenced the Japanese of this period: The gratitude one owes to superordinate benevolent entities is not an easy obligation but may involve the instant sacrifice of one's deepest interests or even of one's life. Union with the ground of being is not attained in a state of coma but very often as the result of some sudden shock in daily living. Something unex- pected, some seeming disharmony, is more apt to reveal the truth than anyformal orderly teaching. Japanese art and esthetic attitude toward nature are also concerned with the unexpected, with the object in all its particularity. Sym- metry is abhorred.

The second concept, however, seems to justify the remark of Roggendorf: This preoccupation leads to a variety of speculative systems that may be fascinat- ing and even spiritually elevating but cannot, it would seem, satisfy the profound religious urge of ordinary individuals.32 There is only one step between this and esoterism, and from esoterism to seculariza- tion. The Tokugawa period has shown just how easy it is to achieve this secularization- a process hardly equalled in any other period of history. The first concept about which Bellah speaks raises once more the question referred to previously-are we dealing with religion or is it rather a Japanese projection of the Con- fucian moral system? Our suspicions are certainly not unjustified. Even Saigusa Hiroto points out that in Japan not even the characteristic love for nature was able to lead the Japanese to a deeper philosophical reflection which in turn might have paved the way towards a concept of true religion. In Europe religion penetrated deeply into society, but in Japan it did not. Men such as Hayashi Razan, Nakae Toju, Yamaga Soka, etc., did not really begin to touch on the theme nor produce anything similar to a commentary on religion. The best that they achieved, according to Saigusa, was to elaborate on morality.33 We are thus left with the confusion brought about by fusion of the divine, nature, and man himself. Let us now quote a little more from Professor Saigusa. According to him, it is difficult to find any serious response to the question, 'What is religion?', before the Meiji period in Japan.34 31 Op. cit., pp. 6ff. In fact one wonders what the distinction would be between such 'religion' and philosophy. What the author has to say when speaking of Confucianism (cf. p. 54), far from dispelling our misgivings, seems to confirm them. 32 Roggendorf, 'The Place of Religion in Modern Japan,' p. 27. 33 #,,; J4, 1 ;-T- 4M0 dt] -4T .

'The Japanese legacy' 43 He states further: Religion, whatever its etymology may be, is a word based on the idea of some- thing superior to mankind. The primitiveJapanese have nothing which, estab- lishing a clear distinction between man and super-man (ch&amp;-ningen), somehow relates these two concepts speculatively Qshisaku teki ni.35 As we go through the Tokugawa period, many personalities of great stature appear on the scene, and although they offer many interesting elements towards the develop- ment of a religious concept,36 even of men such as Dazai, Saigusa has to comment: It is impossible to find in Dazai Jun, in any sense, a religion such as that which dominated (senry&amp; shite ita) the hearts of Europeans.37 We shall close this particular topic by giving here what seems a most illuminating quota- tion. This describes what we have already been discussing in this section and also acts as a backdrop before which we can observe the builders of modern Japan as they first looked upon Europe in the middle of the nineteenth century. During the Edo period, right through to modern Japan, there were many men profoundly influenced by Confucian ideology. Although this seems strange it is still to be found among Japanese intellectuals. It is not surprising, therefore, that to such men the religious feeling of Europeans appears as a world apart (mattaku no bekko no sekai?.38 If we now return to the words of Masutani Fumio in answer to Roggendorf: 'The Japanese do not know and cannot believe that there exists a God above the universe,'39 we shall understand better how this state of affairs has come about as the result of centuries of tradition. But this leads us into the next section of our study. (II METAPHYSICAL GAP; AGNOSTICISM SOME reflections of Saigusa reveal the problem most clearly: We have already stated that religion stems from a keen awareness of the relation- ship between God and man. But the problem here is why society inJapan was not *that even in Europe 'religion' was not an old thing, since it appears for the first time in Bacon's Organum between scientia and ars (pp. 3-4)! 35 As /&lt; M X ,' ;t J,-6 t ~:.

In this connection, nowhere else in the history of hu- manity can there be found a people except the Japanese who have been able to do without such a relationship with God (nakute sumeru). To contrast man with God, first of all man had to be established as a correlative notion. Without fixing the concept 'man' it was impossible to fix the concept 'God'. Here lies a big problem. The Japanese had a thousand occasions to ela- borate the concept of 'man', but those occasions were wasted.40 Those last phrases clearly disclose one of the most serious gaps in the cultural heritage of Japan. I refer to the absence of any sound metaphysical notion in regard to the two essential poles in any religious conception: God and man. For this reason, we said at the beginning of this article that Doi had made a most per- tinent remark when he presented the problem ofJapanese tradition in the face of religion from the viewpoint of a lack of consciousness of the Absolute Ckyikyjku ishiki no ketsubj).41 From this stem nearly all other characteristics of the Japanese mentality in regard to religion. Here we are especially interested in the repercussions from this vacuum in regard to the Absolute, to man and morality. Doi sums up the situation thus: The early Japanese were a gay people who were so happy in their day-to-day life that they did not even begin to evaluate or examine the present in the light of a critical view which would take account of the thousand contradictions found in everyday existence. Their extremely vague, far-off vision of things must cer- tainly stem from this time. They did indeed believe in yomi (Hades) or yomot- sukuni (the country of shadows), but these were ideas associated with the tomb, which was a dismal, vaporous, shadowy place where the dead spent a certain length of time. This concept of a vague, far-off place is typical of Shin- toism right up to modern times, including such modern Shintoist affiliations as konkjkyj, etc.42 The consequences for the concept of morality are worthy of note: In recent times, it has often been said that the Japanese do not have any idea of tsumi (sin) although they do have a concept of haji (shame). This point can also be explained by taking into account their lack of consciousness of the Absolute: that is to say, according to the traditional way of thinking inJapan, if one did not 40 i; &lt; C Ib Z .

This would be thought shameful but certainly not in the same way as in Christianity where the will of the Absolute gives universality to moral law, and surpasses social morality. To go against this law means that the individual is responsible to himself and to the Absolute for his conduct.43 Only when Buddhism makes its mark on Japan does there emerge a more profound view of sin. Even then, sin is thought of more as 'ignorance' Cmumei) and is a far cry from the idea of a sense of responsibility before God.44 Let us quote the writer's views in rela- tion to the human being, for it is an analysis that in general is shared by many others con- cerned with the problem: Also, the lack of consciousness of the dignity of the individual can be understood in this way. Originally, the consciousness of the dignity of a person is a cor- relative notion springing from the consciousness of the Absolute. In other words, the concept of the dignity of the individual has its origin in the concept of the Absolute. By the same token, if there is no concept of the Absolute, there cannot be a concept of the individual as something having an ultimate meaning. For the Japanese the ego is objectified and it is not perceived except, mainly, as the function of an individual belonging to a community encircled by a social morality or as a member of a family having blood ties.45 Thomas Y. Tomon provides us with further insight into the relation between the me- taphysical vacuum and the awareness of human dignity: The history of Japanese culture has developed on two basic elements: lack of metaphysics, and ofthe true notion ofthe dignity ofthe human person. Primitive Japan possessed these two things far more than the Japan of today; but little by little the development of the language killed metaphysics, while the idea of the person was lost in nationalism. These failings presupposed, the Japanese 43 Ibid., p. 8. The author is referring to the well- known controversy around the explanation of tsumi 1 and baji JF, given by Ruth Benedict.

Intuition was honoured, art flourished, manners were refined. By divinizing the emperor the Japanese sought to satisfy their desire to have a living god to guide their lives. But the failings remained, and in spite of many attractive details which can excite the admiration even of Christians, they were disas- trous.46 The Rev. Sawada, following the classical studies of Nakamura Hajime on the oriental mentality, particularly that of the Japanese, has stressed this same aspect in a profound article. Let us pick out a single paragraph: Even though the Japanese possess a great ethic sense, they have been pretty areligious. They show great interest in their religare with its sense of unity between men in a community; but the extent of their interest in this religare in regard to the question of the ultimate reason for human existence in com- parison with day-to-day existence is very scanty indeed. The Japanese word for God is kami, which means 'what is above' (superior). This can mean anything out of the ordinary run of things-something which exceeds the imaginative powers of an ordinary man....47 The gap is too glaring to need further elaboration. It explains why the makers of modern Japan assimilated so deeply and so quickly the anti-metaphysical tendencies of nine- teenth-century Europe.48 One can also understand why Rev. Sauveur Candau, a man of great perspicacity and ever concerned with the destiny of the Japanese people, thus sum- med up his great hope for the future of Japan after the tragic hecatomb of the last war: Let us hope that the dreadful experiences which Japan has suffered may lead her to gain enough strength to assimilate the great metaphysical truths which alone can revivify and benefit the static deposit of crystallised oriental thinking.49 Candau here describes expertly the most serious of all the ills from whichJapan suffered. In order to grasp the situation more clearly, it will be worthwhile to ask why such a state of affairs has been possible in Japan. The first professor to take part in the discussion on the word kami in the book already mentioned, Aimai na kotoba, explains the problem as follows: Why do the Japanese lack the ability to believe in the afterlife? I think it is be- 46 Thomas Y. T6mon, 'The Church and Japa- nese Culture,' in A. Hastings, ed., The Cburcb and the Nations, London and New York, I959, pp. i6i- 62. See also pp. I52, i6o. 47 f Jt .

'The Japanese legacy' 47 cause life in this world was too arduous for them. This life is filled with illness, poverty ... grief, so they had no time to think about such a thing. To be able to consider such things requires money and time. TheJapanese kami was something of this world and the afterlife was left to imported Buddhism.50 This is something which we have already discussed in our first article when referring to economic pressure as a great cause of indifference towards religion amongst young people.51 However, when we apply this cause to an entire people and to their whole cultural history, it is too naive. The reason put forward by the author holds true in many other parts of the world too. T6mon's explanation goes deeper, and through it we can come to grasp many things about the most intimate reactions of the Japanese soul: Japanese is a language which expresses the refinements of the heart rather than those of the reason, and the use of Chinese characters could not change such a characteristic. Faced with Chinese reasoning, whose qualities were not found sufficient to express the heart oftheJapanese people, theJapanese language itself always insisted more on its capacity to express sentiment-heart-knowledge. But we may apply here Pascal's remark about the heart's having reasons of its own; as a human language Japanese could not entirely lack a capacity of reason- ing. However, due to the situation explained above, theJapanese way of reason- ing has always laid the greatest stress on the logic of the heart; consent through the integral intuition of things, rather than on the formal logic of the intellect. This separation of reason and heart has had a great influence on culture, especial- ly on its more spiritual aspect. On the one hand, the Japanese felt intuitively a certain weakness in Chinese culture, that is to say a 'nihilist' neglect of per- sonality, while they rightly knew that it is only the individual person who exists, lives, feels. To preserve the language of personal sentiment meant, in a certain way, to preserve personality itself. Both in the artistic and in the intel- lectual fields, theJapanese wished to maintain their 'personalist' outlook, and in religion it is the person who counts. It is symptomatic of this that Shintoism, which has always remained the spiritual foundation of the people, has never- even to the present day-made use of Chinese terminology in its ceremonies. On the other hand, because the use of Chinese characters has helped to separate the reason from the heart, Japanese people, when considering the world of sentiment, passion and intuition, do not envisage the possibility of a rational explanation or of the direction of passion and the practical judgment by a higher principle. The Japanese are as good as anyone in reasoning 'horizontally', from point to point; what we lack is that reasoning which concerns the hierarchy of 50Morimoto, Aimai na kotoba, p. 272. 51 Monumenta Ni.pponica, i965, XX, pp. 25-27.</page><page sequence="18">48 Monumenta N;ipponica, XXIII, I-2 values. There has been no whole view of things. In practice, the dominant characteristic ofJapanese history has been the triumph of passion, though the manifestation ofthis has been quite different from anything in theWestern world. Art has been well developed, but it has lacked synthesis, as also a sufficient intellectual basis. Another consequence of all this is that philosophy has never found a fruitful home in Japan. I don't deny that Confucianism was accepted by the Japanese intellectuals, but it only spread with the greatest difficulty among the people, and that only after the sixteenth century. Moreover, Confucianism was unable to solve the problem of the relation of mind and heart, and the Japanese did not come, after its spread, to place the Confucian moral values above the force of passion, though also not beneath. Many a time this clash of values has been resolved in death alone.52 I believe that this description reveals a profound truth. In the last section of this article, when discussing sentimentalism, we shall say a few more words about the prob- lem ofJapanese logic, for it is pregnant with sentiment. On this basis, we can now well understand a few of the opinions given by our students which represent the most recent expression of a way of thinking submerged in tradi- tional culture. At that time, my ears were filled with words such as 'materialism', so much so that I became convinced that God was just a story. Soon after, university entrance examinations came round and I noticed, with astonishment, that the word 'God' came to my lips more and more. I cannot explain this even today. It was really 'kurushii toki no kamidanomi' (going to God when trouble threatens) and I cannot find another solution to this mystery. About that time I read that there were scientists who actually believed. I am still astonished. Can scientists and, even more so, doctors really believe? IfGod cures a sick man, why is a doctor necessary at all ... ? Here we have a curious example of confused thinking such as may be hard to find any- where outside Japan. Let us quote another opinion which is even more typical of the difficulties which beset the young Japanese when he begins to realize that the religious problem can be taken seriously. The student earlier had admitted to a belief in God after six months of classes and now explains why he changed his attitude: To me it seems highly questionable whether God, the beginning and end of the world, is the God of religion. The God of religion seems to be fashioned too much in the image of man, as if he were brought in to explain what man is 52 Tomon, op. Cit., pp. I38-39.</page><page sequence="19">NEBREDA. 'The Japanese legacy' 49 incapable of explaining to himself. There are so many things-as we now begin to realize-which are far from the grasp of man! If God controls all things, why does man have to believe in him anyway? And why is there such a distinction on the part of God between those who believe and those who do not? This is a strange way of reasoning which may shock and disturb us but it is inevitable that such thinking should occur in someone who has been born and raised in such a metaphysical vacuum as exists in Japan. Let us examine how another of the students carries the same idea even further: God-or if you prefer it, the Creator of the Universe-exists. Without this premise, it is impossible to think. Now what relationship is there between God and religion? I have my doubts about this. God exists. No, rather, God existed. Without the existence of this God, it is impossible to understand how the world came into being. But must man look up to this God as the object of his faith? To study this God closely, as an object of investigation, is a necessity. Science and philosophy must be employed to this end. But is it necessary for man to love God? Is this possible even? I can only admit to the premise of the existence of God but this feeling is diminished when I consider the world. God is only necessary for having created the universe-that is to say, the nucleus which in time became the universe and the basic laws which governed its evolution. I believe that all other things can be perfectly well explained by natural laws. Even the origin of life itselfis shortly to be revealed to us by science. Therefore, science can explain all things which have occurred in creation. It is unthinkable that God is still working in the universe. Natural laws govern the universe. It is true ofcourse that God created this natural law. There is no more intimate re- lationship between God and the universe than there is between a great-great- grand daughter and a great-great-grandfather. Things are too inconsistent to believe that the will of God is still strong and that everything moves according to this will. If God were still working in these things, then everything would be much better than it is, as it would be guided towards its end in the correct way. It is doubtful whether God created man.... (He goes on to give known theories on evolution and, relating them with the problem of evil in the world, he adds that it was inconceivable that God, the Creator, was not able to carry things through to the end. He finishes by saying:) The real creator of the universe must have been impersonal, just some concentration of energy, which cannot hear men's prayers and therefore cannot be the object of religion. Although lengthy, I believe this quotation is of great value in understanding the mentality of our students. Even though much confusion is apparent and the metaphysical sense is still to be developed, this quotation reveals a series of positive elements which</page><page sequence="20">S? Monumenta Nipponica, XXIII, I-2 should be purified by an intelligent approach. It is obvious that the idea of God must be purified of certain accretions which in the minds of young people have become necessary elements in the definition of God. It would be very dangerous to speak of God in a way which would shock them, out of a regard for their upbringing in a scientific atmosphere. Briefly, it is essential not to present God as if he stood on the same level as secondary causes. Reading these last three impressions as well as those of the 45% who fall into the category of agnostics by virtue of similar objections or problems, one is amazed to see just how many traditional historical viewpoints are reproduced so exactly without the students really realizing that they are doing so. In the introduction to this article, we presented Prof. Roggendorf's account of the rational agnosticism which prevailed among the Confucians of the Tokugawa period and which was also revealed in the conversations between Arai Hakuseki (i675-I725) and the Rev. Giovanni Battista Sidotti (i688-I715). We could have chosen any other personality of the same school to show exactly the same viewpoint. There is no doubt, however, that the famous Confucian sage Arai is a good example of a cold, rational and agnostic mind.53 His relationship with Sidotti, the last Catholic missionary to arrive in Japan, whom he judged as an official of the bakufu government, is set out in his book SeiyJ-kibun (News from the West).54 In a balanced and penetrating article, the specialist on the history of early Christianity in Japan, Uchiyama Zen'ichi, has stressed the importance of the dialogue between the Catholic priest and the Confucian scholar, in which he shows how Arai's objections and difficulties in understanding are common even in Japan today.55 In particular, Arai's incapacity to grasp the idea of creation is outstanding in that he believes Sidotti and Westerners in general to be lacking in metaphysical sense (!), as he feels Sidotti thinks in an excessively anthropomorphic way; that is to say, that the creation of the world is looked upon rather like the work of a craftsman manipulating his tools. Uchiyama has summed up Arai's convictions as follows: Arai has not departed one step from the Neo-Confucianism which he learned. He absolutizes the temporal lord and will not admit to anything superior to him. 53 It is indeed symptomatic that Saigusa, in his introduction to Vol. v of the previously quoted Encyclopedia, presents Arai as a forerunner of materialism, precisely on account of his rational- istic outlook; cf.

'The Japanese legacy' S He believes in spirits Ckishin9 but the only ones worthy of respect are those of his ancestors. RegardingJapanese mythology, he does not reject it as mere supersti- tion but believes it to be mere supernatural legend of true history attached to the Japanese Imperial Household. He considers the Buddhist theory of transmi- gration and the idea ofanother world as pure superstition and for him ten (heaven) is ri (reason). Nor does he believe in Taoism and their idea of tentei (providence) where a kind of divine-human beings live in heaven and from time to time appear to men, bringing them fortune or misfortune. It was natural that having this monistic and atheistic philosophy, he was convinced that the idea of a personal creative God was just a parallel ofTaoist teaching and rejected it as anti- philosophic (non-metaphysical) and likened miracles and retribution in the next world as Buddhist teaching. He even believed that Christianity was really Buddhism which, in its passage from India to the West, had suffered some transformation.56 Here is the Confucian judge's own view on Christianity: They say that heaven and earth and all that is contained therein could not have been created independently and therefore required a creator. But if this is so, who made Deus-the creator-so that he could exist before the creation of heaven and earth? If Deus can exist on his own account, why cannot the same thing be admit- ted for both heaven and earth? According to Christian doctrine, before the crea- tion of heaven and earth, a heavenly house was prepared for the good people. But surely it is impossible to distinguish between good and bad before the existence of heaven and earth. It is obvious that Christian ideas on paradise and hell, as well as other dogmas, were borrowed from Buddhism. For example, what Christianity teaches about paradise can be seen already in the Buddhist faith. In the beginning, the wind blew, the waters were confined and a form appeared which transformed itself into a celestial palace. The story of the fall of man is similar to the Buddhist doctrine which states that man ate earthly food which made his body heavy and so confined his being to the earth. The difference be- tween the sexes came about from having eaten a certain type of rice. Any humane government can forgive criminals. Why cannot the creator do the same? Why did he have to be crucified to expiate the sins of man? The country where Christiani- ty first began is not far from India and Buddhism has spread from there to all neighbouring countries. Therefore, it is not to be wondered at that Christians have images, baptism, rosaries, transmigration of souls-doctrines and familiar nraicties associaited with iiAkbdism_57 56 AL, ,. . k' ! i.

I admit-after all that the teacher explained to us-that this world which is full of mysteries and complications cannot be explained unless it had been planned and brought into existence by someone. But that this planner Ckikakusha&gt;8 was God, is something that I cannot understand at all. If this planner is considered to be God, then where did God come from? It is inconceivable that such a God who is all-powerful and omnipotent, could have come into existence by a natural process (shizen ni umareta3.59 The same thinking is expressed in another opinion, as follows: One of the proofs of the existence of God is that of the order of things. It is obvious that a being cannot come from nothing (mu karayii3.60 It is impossible to conceive of the existence of anything-a book, a man, above all such a complicat- ed and ordered world-without a creator filled with intelligence to explain such happenings. I believe this. It is too obvious not to admit of such a thing. Now, it is another matter to say that this creator is God and that he is all-powerful. I can- not be convinced of this. Apart from man himself, do there exist beings like him who are able to invent and construct artificial satellites, etc., which primitive man could never even have dreamed of? I think not. A God who created such a man would have to have a force and intelligence which we could not even begin to imagine. Thus, following this reasoning, why cannot one think of a force and intelligence superior to God, capable of making God himself. If I follow this argument, I don't know where I would get to. As far as I am concerned an omni- potent God seems contrary to reason and I am preoccupied and feel deceived. All things have their beginning and their end. And can one conceive of existence throughout all eternity? Can this be reconciled through reasoning? I do not think we should spend more time in illustrating the parallel between young people of the twentieth century and the Confucian sages of the eighteenth century, iSo years before Japan was opened to the West. However, we can now appreciate what Rog- gendorf is telling us when he says that men educated in Tokugawa Japan were estab- lished as rational agnostics on their own account, and, because of this, were able to feel at home so quickly and so comfortably with the ideals of the European Enlightenment. (III CONSEQUENCES OF THE ABSENCE OF THE ABSOLUTE USING as point of departure this deep abyss in Japanese culture created by a lack of a sense of the absolute, a lack which we have just attempted to analyze in depth, Doi 58 /,., 59 ' ,k 1_ i 60 A - ;</page><page sequence="23">NEBREDA. 'The Japanese legacy' 53 believes he can trace and explain all the other aspects of the Japanese attitude towards religion.61 Accordingly, we too shall not hesitate to devote a few paragraphs now to a) relativism and pragmatism with 'genseishugi' (a vision of life centered on this world); b) religious pluralism with its extreme manifestations of syncretism; c) tolerance with an innate tendency towards compromise; and d) the remains of a compensating animism, in which superstition is transformed into an ersatz form of religion. In discussing these four aspects, we shall just attempt to bring to light the deep traditional roots from which they stem. A RELATIVISM AND PRAGMATISM We have discussed this question at length in an earlier section.62 Here we will examine its relationship with Japanese tradition. Doi maintains that relativism has become something absolute in Japanese tradition.63 To the Japanese, relativism is so evident an assumption that it is itself taken not as rela- tively but as absolutely true.64 After what we have discussed in the previous section, I do not think we can have any doubts but that theJapanese are consistent in this; as they have no concept of an absolute power, it is logical that everything is relative. The entire history ofJapanese culture shows the continuity of this characteristic, one which it shares with other Eastern peoples.65 But the problem is shown in a new light if we study the discussions between Prof. Rog- gendorfandJapanese experts on the religious attitude inJapan. Briefly, Roggendorf stated categorically in his article that relativism is basic in the Japanese mentality towards religion. Such relativism leads the Japanese to connect the idea of religion with any sort of values except that of truth; it allows him to harbor both faith and doubt in his heart at the same time without any sense of contradiction. Roggendorf searches out the roots of this relativism in Japanese cultural history and illustates the most pertinent of these.66 As we have already given a summary of this process at the beginning of the present article, we shall not go into more detail at this juncture. It is much more interesting for our purpose to study the confirmation of the Jesuit scholar's views by two leading members oftheJapanese intelligentsia. Watsuji Tetsura, the late patriarch of historians ofJapanese culture, thinks that Roggendorf's views in general 'do not stray from the right path nor are they exaggerated'. He insists, however, that even though the Japanese admit to the description of their religious attitude as being relative, pluralistic and frivolous, 'yet they have no wish to be converted'. He adds: 'Although I admit quite frankly that Christianity 61 Doi, op. cit., pp. 9ff. 62 Monumenta Nipponica, I965, XX, pp. 30I-307. 63 Doi, op. cit., p.

Watsuji is of the opinion that: Scientific truth and religious truth are by nature diverse. Scientific truth is not applied to any cultural problem which is closely allied to historical tradition. To bring to a conclusion some determined piece of history, means the acceptance of defined limits which are impossible to change.68 To illustrate this thought, he turns to the Japanese system of writing. In theory, it would be preferable to abandon the cumbersome combination of Chinese characters and Japanese syllabaries in favour of a modern type of alphabet. But the system which is at present in operation is the result of a long historical evolution and therefore cannot be changed. Though it has many deficiencies, it also has advantages, and the Roman alphabet, although superior, also has its inconveniences. Therefore, to put up with the inconveni- ences of the present system is less complicated than a complete change to a new system, even though the latter may be preferable in theory. He then continues: It could be said that this is another example which confirms theJapanese attitude offrivolousness towards religion.... But in my opinion, religion is no exception to the rule that all traditional culture has its destiny. Organized religions are a product of history. Even though they may be superior, they are not without their faults; even though inferior, they do not fail to fill their mission as religions. The difference is but relative. Naturally, all believers are convinced that their religion is absolutely true, and their point of view must be taken into account by an impartial observer. However, if one is going to take seriously one by one the pretensions of so many believers in their various doctrines, then one must perforce adopt some sort of relativism. It is impossible to remain impartial when considering all religions without becoming a relativist. The believer will not appreciate this type ofimpartiality. But ifwe consider that all historical religions are, in their own particular fashion, a way of grasping the Absolute; from this, it does not follow that there are various kinds of Absolute. There are just various ways of adhering to the Absolute; and when one takes into account the fact that man is limited, it is evident that these ways of adherence cannot be absolute in themselves.69 67 Watsuji Tetsuro ifti Z 1, 'Nihonjin no shuikyashin ni tsuite,' Kokoro, August I957, pp. I2- I3. 68 Ibid., p.

'The Japanese legacy' 55 There can be no clearer way than this to re-state what has been imbedded in the Japanese soul for well over a thousand years. Any youth in Japan may tell you: 'Maybe there is only one God, just as there is only one Mount Fuji. But one can come to God by a thousand ways, through a thousand religions, just as one can climb mount Fuji by dif- ferent paths.'70 It is interesting to note an observation made about similar affirmations by Saigusa, in regard to the relationship between religion and culture. It must be emphasized that religion is not simply a phenomenon of culture, but a phenomenon of the human race as such, and concentrates therefore on man as such. The reason why it is necessary to emphasize this strongly is that today many people everywhere, particularly in the East, are inclined to look upon reli- gion as a cultural phenomenon on the same level with art, sports, science, etc. This attitude leads them to be tolerant, not to say indifferent, in matters of religion. It implies that religion has an immanent necessity for those who rely on it, who find it useful, while for others it has no appeal, no usefulness, and they can easily dispense with it. It implies, furthermore, that if religion is merely a cultural phenomenon, then there will be no universal religion-no more than there will be a universal culture.71 Prof. Masutani's response to Roggendorf is, as expected, an echo of the liberal, ra- tionalistic view oftheJapanese intellectual. Roggendorf's views on the relativistic concept of religion which characterizes modern Japan must have impressed Masutani as a revela- tion ofthe insurpassable abyss which separates religious throught between East and West. The following paragraph is worthy of note: Some time ago, in the literary section of a certain newspaper, a discussion between a European Catholic priest and a Japanese said that religion exists for man and that it is an attitude towards the way one's life should be led. The priest, for his part, insisted that religion exists for God and that man sould live for his glory. I imagine that if this last view is absolute, then the first must be relative.72 Having expressed his views, he finished by saying that if relativism means the dilution of the substance of religion itself and thus a diminution of its importance in life, then: We see nothing bad in this relativism or in the fact that religion penetrates so much into daily life that it becomes completely diluted. We think that the ideal 70 Roggendorf, 'Notes and Comments,' Mis- sionary Bulletin, Autumn I949, III, No. 3, pp. 29-30. 71 Maurus Heinrichs, in a note to the resume by Aschoff, 'Religion and the Term shbgky6,' Yapan Missionary Bulletin, i959, Xiii, pp. 567-68. 72 Masutani Fumio, 'Nihonjin no shiikyoshin,' VA oz 'ir4 X; (The Japanese Religious Men- tality), Kokoro, August I957, pp. 2I-22.</page><page sequence="26">56 Monumenta Nipponica, XXIII, I-2 state ofreligion is that ofcomplete amalgamation into daily life so thateventually it takes no part at all in it.73 I do not think that one can quote anything better than this to illustrate Japanese relativism at its most extreme. The consequences which follow logically from such a state of relativism are simple to predict. The first is, without doubt, pragmatism. We have already quoted Watsuji's recourse to the Japanese writing system to illustrate that everything in religion, as in other aspects of culture, has its good and its bad sides. We find ample proof of this attitude in the book Aimai na kotoba, especially in its ex- planation of kami, and above all in the paragraph which deals with the religious attitude of the common people as distinguished from that of the intellectuals. After unanimous agreement on the earthly character ofJapanese religion, the problem is posed as to whether there is any difference between the ordinary people and the intellectuals. The first reply is: Yes, there is a lot. When I saw a woman of the neighborhood praying with all her might, I asked her to which God she was sending up a prayer. She answered me: 'It doesn't matter which.' However, illustrious Gods would not be of much help to this woman, contrary to what one would have expected. But the not-so- important (yasuppoi: cheap) Gods are nearer to one (and therefore are more helpful). That is to say, the God this woman was thinking of, is not a difficult, abstract one such as the intellectuals imagine him to be.74 However, after closer examination, the fifth speaker claims that there is not much difference between ordinary people and intellectuals. For them, 'God is the refuge of the heart.' As the roots with the past were severed by the new wave of culture imported from Europe, the intellectuals did not know which way to turn. Buddhism and Chris- tianity are too exigent, so they tend 'to think of a vague sort of God as the object of their yearnings. This is ambiguous. If a refuge can be found which takes the place of God, then they always end by abandoning God.'75 Why should we be surprised then if 35% of the opinions of our students claim that religion is a refuge for the heart? Or indeed, that opinions like the following are constantly voiced: What is the object of religion? It doesn't really matter too much. It should be something that one can lean on (for the Buddhist it will be Shaka, and for the Christian, Christ, etc.).... Man, who is weak, requires a firm prop (zettaiteki na tayorij.76 Isn't God precisely this? Man is weak and is completely immersed in a world full of worries and problems. 73 Ibid., p. 22. 74 - , t '? 48.

It doesn't matter whether Christianity, Buddhism or Mohammedanism serve this purpose. The important thing is that a religion is useful in this respect, and acts as a prop to man in his weakness. I think that any sort of god will serve the purpose of comforting the pains of the heart. Kurushii toki no kamidanomi (going to God when in trouble) never lets a man down. We are now touching on the roots of this negative religious attitude which we have been analyzing from the beginning of our study. Religion just forms part of an existence whose horizons are hermetically sealed on themselves; it is the famous genseishugi of Japanese religious tradition.77 If we wish to know the terrible consequences which such an attitude brings with it, we must quote the final paragraphs of this article on kami in Aimai na kotoba: What are the consequences ofthe ambiguous word kami ?We certainly should not grieve over this. Why? Because this ambiguity is necessary in the world today. Tolerance means that at last men have the right to do what they want on their own account without God interfering. If we look at the immanent pragmatic and optimistic characteristics of the Japanese, they are not bad qualities at all. The fact that there are many 'ambiguous gods' is a good thing as it shows that here God is close to man. Not only are theJapanese able to 'free themselves from God'-something that Europeans only achieve after laborious effort-but they (the Japanese) live in friendship with the gods. Of course there are the negative type of gods (minus) who bring down curses CtatariD but these can be exorcised quite easily by using a cheap talisman. 'Japan, fatherland of the Gods' has be- come 'Japan, fatherland of men.'78 Paragraphs such as these, which have appeared in the most revered daily paper in Japan, the Asahi shimbun, reveal the attitude ofJapanese university students as well as of their fellow-citizens toward religion. Let us note in passing, that this relativism-pragmatism is always accompanied by tolerance, an attitude close to theJapanese heart. We shall go into this aspect more deeply a little later on; first we shall deal with another characteristic of the Japanese religious mentality which also stems from the lack of consciousness of the absolute. 77 IA,-t- -.

MN: XXIII, I-2 D</page><page sequence="28">58 Monumenta Nipponica, XXIII, I-2 B SYNCRETISM The reader has already seen for himself how many times and how strikingly this ele- ment stands out in the above quotations. A syncretistic spirit is so strong that the or- dinary man sees nothing strange in the emblem ofthe Seichono ie,79 one ofthe new religions, which combines the cross, the swastika, the star of David and the half-moon! Japan is one ofthe very few countries where the people have such an outstanding history ofsyncretism. Roggendorf has vividly shown the effect of this pluralistic syncretism on Japanese tradition; inJapan, there not only exists an external-so to say, geographical-syncretism which has absorbed all cults and sects which have penetrated the islands of the Rising Sun; in addition, syncretism has entered the heart of each Japanese so that he has no dif- ficulty at all in accepting two or more religions in peaceful co-existence.80 As we have seen,81 in Japan there are I30 million 'believers' out of a population of only one hundred million. Moreover, one has to deduct the twenty-five million or so who do not profess any religion at all. Therefore, on the average each Japanese apparently simul- taneously professes two religions! Who, however, can really be surprised at this? From the days of prince Shatoku (573-62I) until the present, each page of Japanese cultural history stresses the point. The extreme syncretism which is characteristic of the New Religions is just a continuation of the uninterrupted pattern, and modern intellectuals are far from escaping this tradition.82 Roggendorf aptly described this phenomenon when he wrote in I949: One of the principal builders of the Meiji Restoration, Count Okuma, speaks in his memoirs of the religious concepts of his friend, the famous Professor Kume: 'I always seek the assistance of the Shinto priest for public ceremonies; whereas the Buddhist priest takes care of funerals in my family. My conduct is based on Confucian maxims and the ethics of Christ. I do not worry about external forms of religion and ask myself whether, in the eyes of the Gods, there is really any significant difference in the diverse religions of the civilized world.' These words are typical eren today of the convictions of the great majority of 7apanese people.83 Masutani has asserted that Japan presents 'a true museum of living religions.'84 It is interesting to note his explanation of this phenomenon. He attributes it to the fact that the Japanese have a tendency to 'hide in an emotional mist' without being able to carry an argument through to its finality.85 79 L z 80 Roggendorf, 'Nihonjin no shiiky6shin ni tsuite,' p. 7. 81 Monumenta Nipponica, I965, XX, p.

This tendency toward compromise is conditioned by the sentimentality inherent in the Japanese character. The latter trait will be the subject of the final section of our study; at this point we shall examine this root of syncretism. C TOLERANCE AND COMPROMISE Our studies have already provided their impressions on tolerance and compromise in the previous article.86 Therefore it is not necessary to go into too much detail here. However, some quotations from the articles by Prof. Roggendorf on theJapanese religious attitude are worthy of note at this point. The mention of religious truth in an absolute, as opposed to a relative sense is, therefore, usually mistaken for intolerance. When Professor Suzuki Daisetsu returned from Europe a few years ago, he reported in glowing terms on the signs of religious earnestness he had witnessed. But he also spoke of his amaze- ment at discovering so many 'educated people who still believed in the historical revelation of Christ'. He was shocked not only because of the 'unscientific' nature of such views, but of the 'intolerance' they implied.87 In one page, he explains in detail the radical illogicality of the prejudice, so common among Japanese intellectuals, by which they absolutize their relativism and become thoroughly intolerant toward what they term intolerance on the part of those who believe in only one God.88 We have seen how Watsuji believes all religions have their good and their bad points. In speaking of Christianity and Buddhism, he categorically mentions as a positive charac- teristic of the latter its tolerance, since: (Buddhism) has hardly ever discounted an ideological or even heretical system (with the exception of the first Japanese Christians, the Kirishitan). This is what is called Buddhist tolerance. It neither rejects a superior system as incompatible to its doctrine, nor does it reject an inferior system, however superstitious it may seem.89 On the other hand, Christianity: (B)ecause of its intolerance, pretended to purport exclusive truth and therefore managed to preserve the purity of its doctrine, but it also prevented the liberty of free thinking and hung, like a pall, over the heads of men throughout the Middle Ages.90 86 Monumenta Nipponica, I965, XX, pp. 309-IO. 87 *gigk 4.

This attitude Sansom sums up as follows: TheJapanese as a people have displayed in matters of beliefa tolerance, amount- ing almost to indifferentism, which has been rare in Europe.91 D SUPERSTITION Religion which is consciously rejected persists in some form of compensation, the most outstanding example of which is superstition. Psychologists have stressed this point many times.92 Watanabe, in his study of the success of the New Religions, observed that one of the major attractions, or better, fascinations which they exerted over the Japanese man-in- the-street-even more than the so-called revelations ofthe founders of the various sects- was the mere fact that these revelations showed that the gulf which separates the material from the spiritual world has been crossed by these same spirits.93 The book Aimai na kotoba, enumerating popular ideas about conscience, reveals interest- ing information which substantiates the fact that the people were deeply influenced by superstition.94 The replies to Question I3 in Section A of the Catholic Committee's questionnaire. 'Do you believe in the use of talismans and in superstitions ?', were as follows: Yes 8.4% No 87.8% No reply 3.8% These answers seem to us open to question and, as Spae himself suggested, indicate that they came about because of the way the question was phrased.95 The information which Doi gives, taken from various official questionnaires drawn up by the Ministry of Education through the Meishin chosa kyjgikai (Association for the Investigation of Superstition) is fundamentally different and shows a much greater per- centage in favor of superstition in its milder forms; a 6i% average in some cases, 73% and 68% in others. Although these statistics were drawn up in I947, Doi is right in saying that the proportions will not have dropped radically in the past thirteen years. Such practices are not confined to the population as a whole, but the same statistics give 43%, 4I% and 53% respectively for people with university training.96 91 G. B.

But, as the author pointedly stresses, all depends on what is understood by superstition, for there are few who do not have recourse to superstition at some time or another (Ibid., p. 543).

'The Japanese legacy' 6I This was already well known to us from other sources. Enrique Rivero tells the strange story of a director of public works of a well-known city in Japan who, when told that a certain house was bewitched, asked, 'Is it not the spirit of the lake (which used to exist there) asking for water?'97 The story which the famous writer Sato Haruo tells is also interesting in this respect. On the basis of a series of mysterious happenings which he experienced in dreams or while awake, he writes in such a way as to impress the Japanese man in the street: The theory of the immortality of the soul exists. I don't believe in it. However, I have the impression that the world of the dead and our world are neighboring and, moreover, intermingle.98 The reader is asked to note this typical case of wavering irrationalism which we will study in more detail in the next section. The following quotation from one ofour students reveals just how strong this attitude can be today. Does the spiritual world Creikonkai) exist or not? I think this goes hand in hand with the question 'Does God exist or not?' For my part, I don't know whether to answer yes or no. The majority of young people in Japan today would say no. But I have had the following experience. We live in a village near mountains. One day when I was returning home from school in my second year of senior high- school, as I got near home, I suddenly came upon an enormous snake at least four centimeters in diameter; it was sleeping, stretched out full length. When I got close to it, it lifted its head and I saw its red tongue flicking in front of me. It gave me a dreadful shock. It was as if I had seen the very soul of the snake. From that time on, I have stopped saying that the spiritual world does not exist. Of course, from this happening, it would not be possible to prove that it did exist; there is something within me which denies its existence. So, here I am unable to make up my mind one way or the other. 4EIV SENTIMENTALITY Doi SEES this aspect, perhaps one of the most characteristic of the Japanese mentality, as closely related to the lack of consciousness of the absolute.99 It is natural that, having neither an absolute faith to profess nor a notion of the absolute by virtue of which one can make positive criticism, everything merges into a blurred compromise of sentimenta- 97 Enrique Rivero, 'Japanese Feelings Toward Nature,' 7apan Missionary Bulletin., I959, XiII, p. 65o. 98 Sat6 Haruo 1&amp;4 ,&amp; 'Yumei sakai nashi' A H * L , Gunzi f4f#1, K6dansha =4-Al, March I960.

Whatever one likes to make of such an explanation, there remains the undeniable fact that the Japanese, from time immemorial, have been dominated in their development by this characteristic of sentimentality with which their cultural history is saturated. The well-known authority on Buddhism and Oriental philosophy, Nakamura Hajime has shown most vividly how far the roots of this sentimentality reach. 100 We noted above how Rev. Sawada sums up Nakamura's teachings on the Japanese mentality when he says it is 'personalized, irrational and realistic.'0l1 This last characteristic has much to do with what we have already said about a metaphysical gap and the consequent tendency toward pragmatism, etc. One the other hand, irrationalism and personalism are the two coordinating factors which place the Japanese in a position where the only force which appears to maintain its strength is that of sentiment. In fact, it is enough to observe the profound changes undergone by the various sects and religions in order to become acceptable in Japan, to understand that here we are confronted with a definite trait ofJapanese tradition. Nakamura has given a wealth of information in his studies. He writes, for example: The beliefs of India and China are in general contemplative and are centered in a vision of the truth. Faith is nothing more than a step which the individual takes in order to penetrate the depths of religion. This step is a simple and preparatory one. But when these same beliefs wereintroduced intoJapan, faith became recog- nized as the essence of religion. This explains why Japanese Buddhism is con- centrated entirely on faith. There are two types of this faith: i) faith in a definite, real personality (such as a teacher or founder, etc.); 2) faith in a personality who is taken as an ideal (such as a certain Bodhisattva). In reality, these two types become intermingled and it is difficult to make any clear distinction between them.102 Yet it is a faith in which the idea of truth or its content dissolves into a surrender-or complete devotion-to some concrete being. It is a blind faith such as Shinran is proud of having toward his teacher Hanen. As far as I am concerned, the only reason that I recite the nembutsu is as a result of the lessons given to me by my teacher, who made me realize that nembutsu is the only ideal following. I do not know whether nembutsu is the true cause of a new awakening in the Pure Land. Maybe it leads one to hell. But I should not worry if one day I found myself there, as long as I had been deceived by Hanen Sh6nin.103 100 His The WVays of Thinking of Eastern Peoples, pp. 355-77. Even more to the point for our present concern is his article 'Une caracteristique de la pensee japonaise.

'The Japanese legacy' 63 One finds sects such as Zen, which in China denounces traditional teaching, but in Japan becomes 'transformed into a doctrine of authority for authority's sake'.104 So much so, that the traditional formula of kyJge-betsu-den, which means that religious truth cannot be translated into the spoken or written word, is transformed in Japan into meaning that it cannot be transmitted to men except by written or oral teaching.105 Thus what was considered to be a negation of authority in China was observed without question in Japan. As a result, the rationalistic spirit of Chinese Zen Buddhism was completely re- jected. We would have to translate Nakamura's entire article in order to appreciate fully this characteristic of Japanese thinking. I shall, therefore, limit myself to a short transcription of Prof. Inabe Enja's writings in order to illustrate the differences between Chinese and Japanese Buddhism: The defect of Chinese Buddhist thinking is the separation of abstract law (which represents truth) from the concrete person and to have made this law the only motivating power of religion. Buddhism cannot be centered in the pure law of truth, if it is to bring life and strength to men. Only by expressing itself through man with blood and tears can this law appeal to mankind.... It is ridiculous to suppose that a religion can transmit fervor if it is centered in pure law. Man is able to experience the true joy of surrendering himselfwith reverence and sup- plication from the bottom of his soul, only if one commits himself wholly to a person.106 This fact is far too important to have gone unnoticed by Japanese missionaries. This desire for personalization in religion, they felt, is a magnificent preparatory step in getting over the Message.107 However, we must not overlook the criticism which Nakamura himself makes of this extreme irrational sentimentality which often borders on a 'credo quia absurdum'. When an ascetic decides that someone is an 'eminent teacher', is it not a fact that the ascetic himselfis looking for a way to follow? In this case, what influences his judgment is the consciousness or experience of universal law present in that ascetic. This decision is arrived at as a result of subjective rational consideration. If we analyse therefore the pretensions of D6gen to follow a 'good teacher' put- ting aside all personal considerations, we find ourselves in a vicious circle. D6gen, however, has never concerned himself with such a problem and advises surrendering oneself to a venerated person.108 104 Ibid., p. ii6. 105 z,Akh4i.

Are, then, the Yapanese illogical? There is no doubt that the Japanese have their own logic, a fact which must be admitted when we consider what a living miracle modern Japan is and how quickly it has developed. Such an ultra-civilized society could not be built up without a certain well-defined logic. It is true that well-known personalities among theJapanese themselves112 have raised their voices in an attempt to foster a more rational viewpoint toward life. Yet if these people speak in this way, then they obviously believe that the Japanese are capable of acting logically. Again, we have only to think of the numerous expressions which the Japanese language has to show disapproval of absurdity (tondemo nai, tsujitsuma no awanai koto, matohazure da, etc., etc.),113 or to agree with something which is considered reasonable, something which goes without saying (gomottomo desu, atarimae desu, dori ni kanau mon da, etc., etc.).114 The Japanese believe man to be a reasoning animal. There is more. As we have indicated in the previous article, the younger generation is passionately concerned with being able to justify its actions and decisions in the most logical way possible. TheJapanese youngster-as a recent observer stressed correctly'15- takes a clear liking to affirm himself logical, objective, scientific, to be truly 'tough'. Hence his predilection for the word warikiru16-etymologically 'to cut', 'to divide', but now suggesting the idea of bluntly facing a problem and solving it by a clear-cut stand. Hence his open scorn for what he calls sweet (amai) in the attitude of those who cherish illusions instead of being realistic (genjitsuteki) or who indulge in pure idealistic (kannenteki) the- ories without keeping their feet on the ground. The most severe word he uses to condemn something is nansensu (nonsense)."17 For him, those who yield to undesirable irrational tendencies are botchan (sonny boy), 'puchi-buru' (Japanization of petit bourgeois) or simply sarariman (salary man),118 that bete noire ofJapanese youth which symbolizes the modern Japanese robot without self, without head, without morals, whose thinking and life is 109 Baiyui Watanabe, op. cit., (footnote 93), p. I62. For him the emotional attachment of the adherents to their founders is the main reason for the success of these new sects. He concludes his article by stating that the history of religion in Japan is the history of such leaders who make religion a living thing. 110 Doi, op.

'The Japanese legacy' 65 utterly deprived of'logic'-and into whose ranks the majority of theJapanese youngsters themselves will eventually enter. And yet, the same observer goes on, side by side with these ideals there is in theJapanese youth an innate predilection for non-rational, aesthetic answers. Youngsters wholly devoted to politics confess that they got their decisive inspiration from the heroes of the novels of Gorki, Rolland, Malraux and others. This is why one must see concretely what they understand as 'logic' and how they live it out. For, bogged down by the metaphysical gap we discussed earlier, all the efforts they make to be 'logical' are often wasted in a sort of fireworks without consistency or true logical validity.119 Their whims or their un- fettered freedom easily become their logic.120 CONCLUSION As Lifton has observed, to understand the psychology of contemporary Japanese youth, one has to consider together the traditional elements of their inherited patrimony (which serve as a brake) and the powerful dynamics of the new changes imposed by the irrepres- sible movement of history. The bewilderingly swift changes in today's Japan should not blind us to the underlying, subconscious, yet powerful effect of their traditional inheritance. It is in that tension between inertia and flux where we have to watch for the struggle of the present Japanese young generation in search of self-identity. 119 Minami Hiroshi A4, Nihonjin no shinri E *,k 0 ,A (The psychology of the Japanese), Iwanami shoten t A-4,J$, Tokyo, I957, has ex- plained this accurately in Chapter IV; 'Nihonjin no higorishugi to gorishugi' E* ol A-5 0) h X, e vgiM:s (Irrationalism and Rationalism of the Japanese), Ibid., pp. i i-SS5 of which J.

If logic is understood to mean Aristotelian, rectilinear, discursive logic, then I would have no quarrel with the title which Lily Abegg has given to Chapter II of her book: 'Denken Ohne Logik' (Thinking Without Logic). I find especially enlightening the sketches sym- bolizing the Western unilinear way of reasoning and the Eastern concentric approach. The former runs the risk of either tangentially bypassing the object or never reaching it on account of inter- cepting obstacles. The latter, approaching its object in ever-converging arrows, leaves it always in the mist of the 'ungefahr' (more or less), but is perhaps far more total and comprehensive than the Western reasoning, particularly when the object is not a thing but a person.</page></plain_text>
