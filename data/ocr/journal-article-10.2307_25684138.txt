<plain_text><page sequence="1">Concepts of "Demons" in Ancient Israel Henrike Frey-Anthes There is no equivalent expression for the word "demon" in the Semitic languages and furthermore, in the Old Testament no conjuration ritual is mentioned. That leads to a diverse and divergent use of the term "demon" in scholarly literature. The author suggests we avoid the use of the word "demon" for the interpretation of Old Testament texts and Syro-Palestinian iconography. It seems to be more helpful to interpret the texts and pictures individually and to analyze the functions of the so-called "demons" in their own special context. In Old-Testament Israel and its surrounding cultures people experienced certain life-threatening entities which today are often covered by the term "demons".1 The usage of this term, however, suggests a universal concept of the sources for which even close scrutiny cannot produce any evidence. This means that the term "demon" in scholarly literature refers to diverse and divergent phenomena and terms.2 In glyptic iconography the term refers to threatening hybrid creatures. In the texts the word "demon" refers to illnesses ("Oil; ntfj?) as well as to once mighty gods de-possessed of their power (Resep; DH^) or animals and entities taken from the boundary of civilisation of the surrounding cultures of Israel, bound ary-crossing entities, such as Satan or Asmodai. Ghost-like border-crossing entities between the human and the numinous world are called "demons" as well as chaotic powers like Leviathan, Behemot and Rahab. "Demons" are placed at border-situations of life and they are fought against by apotropaic rituals (Gen 4,7 [n'l]3; Gen 32,23-334; Ex 4,24-265; Ex 12 [rrntfto]). 1 This essay is based on my doctoral thesis: H. Frey-Anthes, Unheilsmachte und Schutz genien, Antiwesen und Grenzganger. Vorstellungen von ?Damonen" im alten Israel, OBO 227, Fribourg/Gottingen 2007. 2 The problem is obvious e.g. in the Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible (Leiden 21999), in which the English translation of some headwords shows a certain evaluation and definition. 3 For the question of the identification of the term f 3 1 as used in Gen 4,7 with the Mesopo tamian rabisu see: B.

The second reason is that there is no equivalent expression for the word "demon" in the Semitic languages.6 The word originates in Greek Philosophy and from this source it found its way into Judaism and Christianity. It was only later that the Rabbinic Judaism use of the word sd was equivalently to the Christian use of the word "demon". This means we have to ask two questions: Can we transfer the impact of the Greek term 6oa|ia)v and its integration into the Jewish-Christian ideas of "demons" to the Old Testament texts and the Syro-Palestinian iconography? Is this helpful for a better understanding of the texts and the pictures? 1. Hybrid creatures as "demons" in the Syro-Palestinian glyptic? Iconographical studies deal with depictions of "demons", understood as threatening entities formed out of a combination of human and animal ele ments. The main sources are amulets which were normally used as seals. When interpreting these depictions we must pay special attention to the func tion of the hybrid creatures. The function of the amulets is to protect the wearer. This protection against mischief can be granted in two different ways. On the one hand, positive powers are activated reinforcing the wearers' own power. The positive protecting power of the seals is shown by good wishes for the wearers as well as by images of creatures with protecting attributes. On the other hand, evil powers are warded off by confrontation with other or with the same evil forces. There are many mixed entities on Syro-Palestinian seals, almost all of them have wings. Gods as well as animals and hybrid figures including sphinxes and gryphons can have wings. In Mesopotamia wings signify the ability to fly as well as a relationship of the winged creatures to wind and to heaven. There does not seem to be a special protecting power of wings in general, which 4 On the narratological motives of the text and its problems concerning literary criticism, see: M. Kockert, War Jakobs Gegner in Gen 32,23-33 ein Damon?, in: A. Lange/H. Lichtenberger/ K.F.D. Romheld (ed.), Die Damonen.

The protective symbolism of wings, however, seems to be an element of Egyptian mythology. The uranian as well as the protecting power of wings can also be found in the Syro-Palestinian glyptic. The multitude of depictions of positive protective (winged) hybrid figures on Syro-Palestinian stamp-seals and amu lets shows implicitly that the environment and life itself was experienced as being dangerous. Depictions of fights, in which a dangerous power - mostly represented by a sphinx or a gryphon - is defeated, show the need for protec tion and indirectly the threatening nature of the attacking creatures.7 The pictures do not show threateningly acting hybrid creatures who act on their own but only unspecific fighting-scenes. Thus, we cannot find out pre cisely which dangers people feared, respectively how they named the dangers. This means we can speak of the existence of protective entities in Syro Palestinian iconography, but not of "demons" which could be named in incan tations. The reason may be that the negative powers, when depicted, assume a certain amount of realism which people would prefer they did not have. By relying on positive protecting powers, however, a sphere of safety is estab lished. The depictions of the Syro-Palestinian glyptic are unusual, as it contra dicts the findings for Mesopotamia, where amulets e.g. with pictures of the - especially for women and children - dangerous Lamastu were widely dis tributed.8 7 An extraordinary motif is shown on a seal from the late or middle Bronze Age from Tell el 'Agul [fig. 1]: The seal shows a human lying on his back, in front of him stands an anthropomor phic creature with a long curl (Baal-Seth?), wearing a short loincloth and holding a lion by its tail. The anthropomorphic god, whose arm is going upwards in a slight angle, holds an antlered animal which jumps over the human. Behind the lying human a winged creature resembling a man with horns and a tail can be seen, reaching out with his hands. This winged creature is identified by Keel as a "winged demon", which threatens the human lying on the floor (O. Keel/C. Uehlinger, Gottinnen, Gotter und Gottessymbole. Neue Erkenntnisse zur Religionsgeschichte Kanaans und Israels aufgrund bislang unerschlossener ikonographischer Quellen, QD 134, Freiburg i.B./Basel/ Wien, 52001, 88f.). However, this scene is unusual: Similar fighting scenes almost always depict three characters, one aggressor attacks another animal over a small animal or a young one lying on the ground (O. Keel, Schwache alttestamentliche Ansatze zur Konstruktion einer stark dualistisch getonten Welt, in: A. Lange/H. Lichtenberger/K.F.D. Romheld (ed.), Die Damonen. Die Damono logie der israelitisch-jiidischen und friihchristlichen Literatur im Kontext ihrer Umwelt - Demons. The demonology of Israelite-Jewish and early Christian literature in context of their environment, Tubingen 2003, 211-236.224-226). Another Mesopotamian cylinder-seal shows a four-winged (?) creature with a curl (?) seemingly protecting a ram or a moufflon lying on the ground, which is attacked by a lion. On the seal in question the hands of the winged creature are not raised to attack, they might also try to hold the falling human to help him. Although a hybrid creature is shown, it cannot be proved that it really attacking. Normally anthropomorphic winged creatures are not threatening, but rather protective. That means that this scene would be unique to Palestine. It may be possible the lion held by the anthropomorphic creature is the attacking animal which is held at bay by the winged creature, as in other similar scenes covering three actors the lion very often is the attacker. So it remains uncertain whether the figure in question can really be called a "demon". 8 The Sphinx shown on an amulet from Arslan-Tas (KAI 27; TUAT II 436f.) from the 7th century with a pointed helmet and a scorpion-tail is often seen as Lilith [fig. 2]. The inscription calls the sphinx "She who Shatters" or "She who breaks (the Bones)", "She who flies in the Darkness of the Underworld" (TUAT II 436; KAI II 46). If line 20 has to be read '"pW it could</page><page sequence="4">Concepts of "Demons" in Ancient Israel 41 2. "Demons" in the Old Testament? (1) Personalized Negative Powers The Israelite-Palestinian sources contain no conjuration incantations for demons There are attempts to define remaining elements of incantations in certain Psalms, but as we do not have any ritual agendas for the biblical Psalms, the attempt must remain hypothetical. The two words for illnesses, lyj ("illness/black death") and nui? "epidemic thorn" (?) as used in Ps 91,5f. - a Psalm which later was used as an incantation - are often understood as depos sessed gods taken from the environment of Israel.9 However, there are no safe sources identifying either "Q} or npj? as ancient Oriental gods. Although these negative powers do have a personal character in Old Testament texts there is no evidence that they were seen as demons that could be conjured up by incantations in case of need. This means we rather have to look for formal similarities between Psalms and Akkadian individual prayers. The biblical Psalms, on the one hand, and the Mesopotamian ritual prayers of mourning, on the other show parallels in the attitude of getting protection from mischief from the personal respectively the highest god. The Akkadian prayers ask the gods to help in times of need instead of addressing the powers which are responsible for the mischief. These are for the most part - but not always - identified as the root cause of the mischief. This is a simi larity between the Akkadian ritual prayers and the Psalms, which also do not be a reference to Lilith (G.R. Driver, Lilith. Heb. n^1? "goat-sucker, night-jar" [Is. XXXiV, 14], in: PEQ 91, 1959, 55-57.55). The name "Lilith" then would have to be understood as a second name for "She who Flies". There are, however, various uncertainties as to whether the inscription really is to be interpreted as ""pW, so that another possibility can well be taken into account: The incantation might also be translated as: "Oh You, who flies in the dark of the Underworld, please always pass us by, by night and day\" (TUAT II 437). This would correspond with lines 26-29, an incantation to the god Sasam, to go away with the sunrise. Here, too, the incantation ends with mentioning a certain time, the beginning of the day. So it seems to be rather unlikely that Lilith is really mentioned, at least the question remains open. It is uncertain, too, if we can identify the wolf, with two legs sticking out of her jaws, with Lamastu ("She who strangles the lamb"). The name of Lamastu, however, is not mentioned explicitly on the amulet. That means such an identification can only be carried out because of the image of a devouring (she-?)wolf, a name given to Lamastu in an incantation (B.R. Foster, Before the muses. An anthology of Akkadian literature, Ann Arbor 1993, 864) - and because of the two other signs, the ears and the scorpion tail (W. Rollig, Begegnungen mit Gottern und Damonen der Levante, in: T. Holscher [ed.], Ge genwelten zu den Kulturen Griechenlands und Roms in der Antike, Miinchen/Leipzig 2000, 47 66.58f). Also the inscription on the wolf ("Leave this house, You, who shatters") is not specific for Lamastu, it might refer to various negative powers. So it remains at least questionable, if the wolf really is an image of the Lamastu. 9 However, in Qumran and in Rabbinic and early Christian literature only 3?)j? is called a "demon" (7$) (bBerachot 5a; bPesachim 111b; Midrasch Tehillim of Ps 91). The term "137. occurs in the Old Testament approximately fifty times, always in connection with warfare. Some authors think that Hab 3,5 (beside Resep), Ps 91,(3.)6 and Hos 13,14 (beside 3U?) ^ refers to a demon. In Ps 91,6 as well as in Hab 3,5, 137 is the subject to the verb ~f?n. The word 3tfj? occurs only four times (Ps 91,3-6; Hos 13,14; Deut 32,24 beside Resep and asn "hunger"; Isa 28,2 beside 713 "hail").</page><page sequence="5">42 Henrike Frey-Anthes address the opponent. The addressee in the Psalm is entirely God, who is expected to help. In the Old Testament Israel as well as in Mesopotamia illnesses were experienced as powers, which influenced life in an uncontrolla ble way. Concrete names of demons of illness or of the weather, who act independently, are not to be found in the Old Testament to be sure. (2) Gods Depossessed of their Power Resep Depossessing foreign gods in Old Testament times was a means to stress the sole sovereignty of Yahweh. This is obvious when looking at the god Resep with his insignia arrow and shield and the gazelle. This god of war, of illness and healing was widely spread across the ancient Orient for some time. Bibli cal texts mention the word in Hab 3,5; Deut 32,34; Ps 76,4; Ps 78,48; Sol 8,6; Job 5,7 and Sir 43,17. Psalm 91 may refer to Resep, as the Qumran ver sion interprets Resep as a demon.10 Depossessing Resep of his power is carried out by the biblical texts as a process of increasing depersonalisation. His godlike character is not mentioned at all. The texts do exclude the godlike elements, so that the word ntj^ loses its god-defining meaning, but they still include the nuances of the meaning "arrow" and "lightning".11 The positive (healing-)powers of Reseps are transferred to Yahweh. At the same time Yahweh can become the source of threat and mischief by adopting and using the abilities of the former god. Sedim Another way of depossessing gods is not to deny the actual worshipping of foreign gods but to speak of them in an attitude that not only denies the godlike character of foreign gods but that makes it almost impossible to reconstruct their religious function historically. The word Wiy} turns to a keyword for "demons" in in Qumran as well as in the Syrian New Testament and Rabbinic Judaism. We are still unable to explain the origin of CP7# as far as the historical aspect of religion is concerned. Attempts to explain the origin of the term from both the Balaam-inscription of Tell Der- 'Alia and from Ugaritic texts are not only difficult for linguistic reasons, but also because the texts have been poorly conserved and are hard to read. The most probable solution seems to be relat ing it to akk. DINGIR seduim) (DINGIR alad/udug). Still, there is the problem that the WIV in the Old Testament have got a completely different function than the DINGIR sedu(m) in Mesopotamia. Although the word is widely used in Mesopotamia, there is no evidence for sacrifices to the DINGIR 10 DJD23,200. 11 This process is going on during the reception of the texts, which point out two basic ideas of interpretation of the lexeme, namely as "Bird" or as "Fire" or "Flame".</page><page sequence="6">Concepts of "Demons" in Ancient Israel 43 sedu{m). Nevertheless, this is the main reproach of the Hebrew Bible concern ing an#. In the Old Testament the DHttf are only mentioned in Deut 32,17f and Ps 106,37f Both Deut 32 and Ps 106 condemn worshipping foreign gods. There is no information concerning the character of these gods in Deut 32,17, the verse is only concerned with polemic against gods that are said to have been worshipped in the history of Israel. Ps 106,37 refers to Deut 32,17 and gives a creative interpretation of the missing information: The Q^ltf are blood thirsty creatures that demand the sacrifice of children. According to the pre vailing historical position, the setting is in Canaan and thus the worshipping of the 0*7$ is defined as archaic. So the word gets an individual threatening evil character. The are turned into "demons" only by the specific attitude towards foreign gods taken up by the LXX, which translates the word CP7# with 8ai|n6viov. (3) Representatives of Counterworlds: Ghosts of the Desert, Lilith, Goat-Spirits and Azazel Ghosts of the Desert The concept of a subdivided world which is present in the Old Testament texts leads to the idea of animals and not clearly definable creatures, who are the inhabitants of a counterworld to human civilisation. Included among the eerie and dangerous animals who haunt deserted places are the Jackal (D^ri) and the Ostrich (rn$r nil?). Other creatures are mentioned, however, they cannot be identified clearly from the texts. The following are mostly called "desert-demons": Those who live in the ruins cr9? (&gt; "S*; ^ "dry landscapes/ dry" [only pi.]; Isa 13,21; Isa 34,14; Jer 50,39; cf. for humans Isa 23,13; Ps 72,9; Ps 74,14) as well as the "N (only pi.; &gt; ^ III "beach-demon/kobold"; cf. Egypt, jw/jwjw "dog"; ^ "Woe!" [cf. Ecc 10,16]; Isa 13,22; Isa 34,14; Jer 50,39). As the name of the D^x explains where they dwell ("those who belong to the dry landscape/desert dwellers"), the expression o x has rather got an onomatopoeic nature, it defines a howling creature ("howler"). The translation of the Hapax Legomenon trn'x (Isa 13,21) varies between "jackal", "owl" and "demon". The word is possibly reflecting a sound, it is connected to the inter jection nx (cf. Ez 6,11) and it may be used as a collective name for the animals mentioned. The pair "N and D X belongs to the description of a destroyed city in Isa 13,21f; Isa 34,14 and Jer 50,39. The D x represent destruction, while the "N as well as the DTf N represent howling and mourning. The texts, however, speak of ghosts living at the periphery but they avoid a clear identification, which would be needed for an incantation, to identify the evil forces it wants to drive away. The creatures are described ambiguously in order to underline the vagueness of the peripheral counterworld. Ex 12,21b?23 is about an apotropaic ritual, warding off harm by brushing the threshold with blood. The harm is defined by the determined participle rrntften ("destroyer"). Most often Ex 12,21b?23 is understood as the centre of</page><page sequence="7">44 Henrike Frey-Anthes the Passover-Liturgy and as a very old tradition. Thus the destroyer is seen as an old demon of malady12, as a "strangling-angel", a "night-demon"13 or as a "desert-demon"14 respectively as a demon representing the hot desert-wind in spring15, which the nomads on their journey had to give a sacrifice.16 But modern findings concerning nomadism do not agree with at least Rost's theory. Furthermore Ex 12,21b?23 does not speak of a nomadic travelling between pastures and there are no definite hints of a nomadic background of the text. The question arises why a nomadic destroyer should be mentioned here as the text in general describes the situation of the Israelite families' Egyptian habitat. So it is highly uncertain that the destroyer really is a "desert demon". The fact that the destroyer "beats" during the night rather reminds us of the nightly activities of the Mesopotamian Lil-Ghosts or the Lilith in Rab binic literature. It is also reminiscent of the Mesopotamian incantations against the evil demons Udug and Ala, which are to prevent them from crossing the threshold of a house and to send them back into the mountains or the steppe.17 The Mesopotamian ritual series of incantations utukki lemnuti Z. 25-35 reveal that the evil ghosts cannot be stopped neither by door nor bolt to haunt a house. Another ritual of the Mesopotamian ritual series Namburbi ("Ritual of Release") resembles Ex 12: At the entrance of a tavern - an area where people were endangered to get contaminated by many impurities - impure matter was deposited. To annihilate the contamination of the tavern brought about by this process the doorposts were brushed with an apotropaic paste as a sacrifice to Istar, who is, among others, also the goddess of the taverns. One of the most important textual witnesses for this ritual, which was carried out on the last but one day of the year, is an amulet which was placed in the entrance area of the tavern and which gave protection against harm and contamination perma nently.18 Possibly alike the Namburbi-Ritual the Passover Ritual first of all is meant to guard the thresholds by a nightly apotropaic blood application ritual, banning a danger lurking outside the house. In the general context of Ex 12 the blood-application-ritual changes into a ritual of passage, pointing out the danger of leaving the house and going into the desert, which is called rpntfto. In the biblical context, the destroyer has the role to disburden Yahweh, who can 12 H. Duhm, Die bosen Geister im Alten Testament, Tubingen/Leipzig 1904, 15; S.A. Meier, Samuel, Art.

Theologically this is in accor dance with a tendency during the latter phases of the Old Testament. A de monology was developed to solve the problem of Theodizee, which occurred with monotheism.19 Lilith The "wind-demoness" Lilith, who can already be found in the Sumerian Epos "Gilgames, Enkidu and the Underworld" does not seem to have had any special importance outside Mesopotamia.20 Interpretations of supposed find ings from Ugarit and Phoenicia are very uncertain. It is astonishing, however, that, according to Isa 34,14, Lilith belongs to the inhabitants of the counter world together with owls and other birds of prey, ostrich, jackals, snakes, desert dwellers, howlers and he-goats. The description of the ruins of Edom in Isa 34,11-15 is a subtly composed literary text with close connections to Isa 13,2If and Jer 50,39, which are similar descriptions of the deserted Babylon. Isa 34,11-15 intensifies the descriptions of Isa 13,21f. and Jer 50,39 by listing the inhabitants of the periphery in a detailed way and by introducing Lilith. However, Lilith, like the other creatures, is only mentioned as an inhabitant of the human counterworld. She does not get a personal position beyond this. It is Yahweh who destroys Edom. The fact that Lilith and the animals start dwell ing in the ruins is a result of Yahwes actions. The danger arising from Lilith is only mentioned implicitly, on the one hand by the birds (owls) related to the underworld and animals who symbolise destruction and mourning (ostrich and jackal), on the other hand by naming other eerie creatures belonging to the realm of destruction ( "?, ct9n, he-goat). The character of Lilith (being poisonous and gripping things quickly) is furthermore indicated by the actions of serpent (Ti9p) and birds of prey (rp? [pi.]). Encountering Lilith could be deadly. There is almost no reasonable explanation why Lilith is mentioned in Isa 34 or how her name got into the text at all. One possible relation to Isa 34 19 See also Kockert, Gegner, 2003, 179. 20 The so-called Burney-Relief shows a Sumerian (?) goddess, which is often identified as the demoness Lilitu respectively Lilith [fig. 3]. The relief shows a beautiful naked young woman, wearing a crown with four horns, which identifies her as a goddess. Instead of feet she has birds' claws and -wings. The goddess holds a ring and staff, insignia of power and she wears jewellery. She stands on two lying lions with an owl on either side. Traces of colours show that the goddess originally had a red body, while the wings and the manes of the lions were black, and the wings of the owls were red and black. In the background there are two rows of scales, probably an image for mountains which symbolise the Underworld. The picture is not at all sinister, in contrast to the images of the Lamastu. It is difficult to interpret the relief, as there is no inscription. It remains open to interpretation, as to whether it really is an image of the lilitu respectively ardat-lili (W. Farber, Art. Lilu, Lilitu, Ardat lili. A. Philologisch, RLA 7, 1987-1990, 23-24; E. Porada, B. Archaologisch, RLA 7, 1987-1990, 24-25) or of Istar herself (J. Black/A.

West, Cults, 127f.).</page><page sequence="9">46 Henrike Frey-Anthes how her name got into the text at all. One possible relation to Isa 34 could be the Mesopotamian Lil-Ghost dwelling in ruins. The connection to Babylon is given by the literary reception of Isa 13 and Jer 59. But Isa 34,14 does not mention the definitely (sexual) character of the Lil-Ghosts in Mesopotamia which constantly appear in later concepts of Lilith in Rabbinic, Cabbalistic or mediaeval Christian texts - and still does in modern times. Like the other creatures living in the ruins Lilith only acts at the fringe of civilisation and makes the ruins uninhabitable for humans. Goat-Demons? Another dweller of the periphery and a symbol of the uninhabitable anti civilisation is the Tyfr (lit. "the hairy/he-goat") respectively Drvyi{/.21 Com bining all findings for the lexeme ETTyty leads to the assumption that wild goat-spirits were worshipped in Israel (Isa 13,21; Isa 34,11), which had their own cult, possibly functioning as (fertility [Deut 32,2]) gods (Lev 17,7; 2Chr 11,15). Adding the scapegoat for Azazel and the topological image of horned goat-like animals at the tree of life, they turn into symbols of "demonic power of life" who are commonly called "ghosts of the fields" or "goat-demons" (cf. the Greek Satyrs).22 However, when we analyse texts and archaeology indi vidually, the picture changes. The Syro-Palestinian iconography depicts goat like animals in an ambivalent way. On the one hand they are animals, who have to be tamed [fig. 4], and on the other hand they belong to the sphere of the goddess and are closely related to fertility, vitality and the power of healing [fig. 5]. The second aspect especially is widely spread across the whole ancient Orient over a long period of time. Old Testament texts use the term in two different ways: According to Lev 17,7 and 2Chr 11,15 the negative characteristics of the ,'T?ty consist of contradicting the exclusiveness of worshipping Yahweh. There is no indication in these two texts, however, that the vryty were feared by their worshippers. The polemics used here associate the "'Tyty with the opposite to the holy and pure, thus with the sphere of death. This resembles the DHtf in Deut 32,17f and Ps 106,37f, who also denominate foreign gods. There are different reasons given for the anti-godlike character of the foreign gods: In 2Chr 11 (tTTyty) and in Ps 106 (Wltf) it is for cultic, in Lev 17 (ZTTyty) it is for topographical and in Deut 32 (Q^t?) it is for historical reasons. However, in Isa 13,21f. and Isa 34,14 the wyvty respectively the TtftP occur as intimidating animals. Here the wyvty belong to the topos of the anti human world, cut off from civilisation. As dwellers of deserted places they are always together with other peripheral and thus eerie creatures. These findings 21 In the Bible the word Tyty ("he-goat") occurs over fifty times. The plural wyyty which is often interpreted as "goat-demons" is only found four times: Lev 17,7; Deut 32,2; Isa 13,21; 2Chr 11,15. The important reference for the translation as "goat-demon" in Isa 34,11, however, has the singular Tyfr. 22 See e.g. T.

There are no "goat-demons" in the Old Testament, whatsoever. The term rvyvty defines he-goats, who belong, according to Isa 13,2If. and Isa 34,14, to those creatures dwelling in ruins. According to Lev 17,7 and 2Chr 11,15 they define foreign gods, with hardly any possibility to describe their character. Perhaps the polemics refer to the close connection of goat-like animals to the goddess, whose worshipping the biblical texts treat with so much contempt. Azazel In the Hebrew Bible the term *?TXTJ? appears only four times in three verses - Lev 16,8.10(2x).26 - and it only occurs together with the particle Id. In general ^TXTJjft) is understood as the name of a place23, of a ritual24 or a (demonic) figure25. A satisfactory explanation of the origin of the lexeme ^TXTJ? has yet to be found. Analysing the ritual context, in which the lexeme turns up, seems to be more promising in understanding the importance of Azazel. The Azazel-Ritual in Lev 16,5.7-10.20b-22.26 consists of the following phases: a) The first (and oldest?) part of the ritual is the scapegoat-ritual with the living he-goat. This is a ritual of elimination for the atonement of the High Priest and the people as well as for purifying the temple and the altar (vv20b-22). There is not yet any reference to Azazel. b) The introduction of a second goat for the nstpn-sacrifice necessitates a second ritual to lead both he-goats towards their destination. A ritual of drawing lots is performed which has got a terminological consequence: As the one lot "dedicates the one he-goat to Yahweh", the other he goat has to get a dedication, too, and so it is "dedicated to Azazel" (vv5.7-10ba). The lexeme ^TNTg1? seems to have originally been connected with the ritual of drawing lots and not with the elimination rite. The Azazel-Goat has to go through the ritual alive, and, furthermore, it is semantically connected with the desert because of the scapegoat ritual. 23 A.

Another person is introduced, who is responsible for sending the he-goat away, as it becomes impure the moment the sins are transferred to it and the High Priest must not touch it (vlObp.26). Washing the as sistant means cleaning him from the impurity of the he-goat. The two he-goats in Lev 16 stand for two contradictionary concepts: While the sacrificed "Yahwe-Goat" (for purifying the holy tent respectively the temple and the altar) represents purity and holiness, the living "Azazel-Goat" (for the elimination) embodies sins and impurity. The "dedication to Azazel" defines Azazel in another sense as a representative of the anti-world, namely as a creature of reference for the counterworld of the cult and of purity. Azazel represents everything Yahweh is not, namely impurity and the place which is cut off from the cult, that means the anti-godlike and anti-cultic world. Yah weh, contrary to Azazel, is furnished with positive aspects. He is the god of the cult, of purity, who receives the sacrifices, who is worshipped in the holy district. Only due to the literary combination (vl0b(3.26) of the elimination-rite (w20b-22), carried out by sending the he-goat into the desert alive, and the rite of drawing lots (vv5.7-10), Azazel turns into a creature dwelling in the desert. Yet, we still do not get any further information concerning Azazel other than the he-goat loaded with sins is sent to him alive. There is no power to act nor a personal character of Azazel to be found in Lev 16. So it would not agree with the intention of Lev 16 to call him a "demon". (4) Bordercrossing Entities and Intermediaries: Satan and Asmodai Satan The figure of Satan appears in the Old Testament as a member of the heav enly court (Job If; Zech 3,1-7) as well as on earth (IChr 21,1 par. 2Sam 24,1; Num 22,22f). The figure acts in quite different roles.26 There are similarities between Job If. and Zech 3,1-7, both place the Satan (always with article) among the Sons of God respectively as a member of the heavenly court of Yahweh. The setting of Zech 3 is a judgment-assembly of the heavenly court. As a member of this assembly the Satan represents the traditional thinking of the "deed-consequence nexus", which now is being dismissed as the chaotic antipower of ancient times. The Satan acts as the negative counter-balance to the positive power of Yahweh, who forgives and chooses. For the guilty this means, that God is tempering justice with mercy, not putting the law before the mercy. In Job If. the Satan acts as a real border crossing entity, crossing the borders between heaven and earth. However, in Job If. the Satan actually does not act as a negative power of his own, tempting someone to do something, but 26 Where human conflicts are concerned the noun defines political opponents or potential deserters at war (IKi 5,18; IKi 11,14.23.25). The sons of Zeruiah act as misleading advisors (2Sam 19,23).</page><page sequence="12">Concepts of "Demons" in Ancient Israel 49 only as a stimulus for the highly problematic decision of Yahweh to test Job by delivering him to the arbitrariness of illness and distress. In the narrative of Job the Satan embodies the dilemma whether man can remain true to God without experiencing God positively. In Zech 3 as well as in Job If. the role of the Satan is to alleviate Yahweh from negative features. However, this is not fully achieved: In Zech 3,1-7 the guilty Joshua is relieved as God tempers justice with mercy, although in Job If. Yahweh allows the innocent Job to be subject to consequences without being responsible for their reasons. In IChr 21, however, the role of Satan (used without article) is different: He replaces Yahweh literally, acts as an instigator to evil deeds and embodies aspects from Job If. and Zech 3, to disburden Yahweh and his relationship towards David. The messenger of God in Num 22 who acts "as a Satan" and blocks Balaam's way, is also crossing borders. Thus, the border crossing figure in Num 22 is not Satan but an angel, who appears between Heaven and Earth (cf. IChr 21,16). In any case, the texts analysed do not provide any coherent concept of Satan. Asmodai In the Book of Tobit the 5ai|icov Asmodai (aesma daeuua "Demon of Wrath") allows us to catch a glimpse of the beginnings of the development of a demonology, in which the demons act as independent opponents of God respectively of the angels in order to relieve the monotheistic God from threat ening-evil features on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to transfer him from his transcendental world into the world of man. Yet this attempt can only remain fragmentary: Not God himself operates in the world of man but a messenger of his, the Angel Rafael. Asmodai embodies an entity with a mighty power of his own, but when Rafael the Messenger appears with the knowledge from Heaven on how to ban the demon, Asmodai loses his power. He is depossessed at the end of the narrative from a border crossing entity to a peripheral spirit, who can no longer cross the threshold of his prison in Upper Egypt. The transcultural description of demons as border crossing entities and intermediaries which is widely accepted in scientific religious literature, however, can only be applied to the Old Testament texts to a very limited extent. In the narrative of Tobit the Angel Raffael, on the one hand, acts as a border crossing entity and in this aspect he is closer to the role of Satan in Zech and Job than the demon Asmodai, on the other hand, Rafael acts, differ ently to Satan, as a positive guarantor for the "deed-consequence nexus".</page><page sequence="13">50 Henrike Frey-Anthes 3. Theology instead of Demonology By scrutinizing Old Testament texts and the Syro-Palestinian Iconography, we understand that it is problematic trying to subsume different religious and cultural phenomena under the same category "demon". The common feature of the Old Testament texts is only that they use the figures and powers mentioned as a negative opposition to Yahweh respectively to human civilisation within which worshipping Yahweh is possible. Looking at the history of scientific religious research this corresponds with findings of early Old Testament studies, which were, however, carried out under different hermeneutic prem ises27: There is almost no way to find any safe evidence for a definite belief in (negative-)numinous powers next to Yahweh. It is true that ancient Israel integrates phenomena from its environment into its own religion, but this is carried out by exploiting these phenomena theologically. In every case we analysed, the entities mentioned in the texts are used as an opposition to Yahweh, so they are much more the basis for a Theology than for a Demonol ogy. This is confirmed by the findings of the iconographic analysis: There is no way to find a direct terminological connection between the so-called "de mons" in the Old Testament and the Syro-Palestinian glyptic. As far as this aspect is concerned, texts and pictures are unrelated. Then again both texts and pictures serve the same function: They are careful when describing negative powers and they do concentrate on the idea of protection. Of course, we cannot deny that a belief in negative ghosts of mischief existed in Old Testament Israel. However, we do not obtain any concrete information about these con cepts. It is doubtful whether the only reason for this result could be the fact that demonological texts were not canonized. Even if such a revision of the Bible had really taken place there would have to be obvious and concrete traces of it. Furthermore if this was indeed the case the question remains, why have incantations not been passed down? This is a profound difference be tween ancient Israel and the other cultures of that time, in which incantations 27 J. Weiss was ahead of his time with his theory of an editorial revision of the Bible which eliminated the belief in demons. He stated that this revision put away the popular belief by introducing monotheism (Art. ?Damonen"/Art. ?Damonische", in: RE 4, 31898, 408-419). His contemporaries were of the opinion that the healthy character of the Israelites was the reason for the absence of a demonology. R. Smend stated that the Israelite way of thinking was flexible and vivid. Therefore they took over foreign ideas only up to a very limited degree (Lehrbuch der alttestamentlichen Religionsgeschichte, SthL [Alttestamentliche Theologie], Freiburg i.B. 1893, 119). A. Bertholet, too, states that the Israelites did not believe in demons because of their healthy and level-headed character (Art. ?Geister, Engel, Damonen im AT, Judentum und NT", in: RGG 2, 1910, 1217-1224.1217f). Duhm, Geister, 31, argues, that the missing of any demonology is due to fact that the people in ancient Israel were farmers without artificial and literary fantasy. They worked too hard to be afraid of any demons. The following statement speaks for itself: F. Hitzig thinks that in contrast to the Arabs who were "boasters and liars" and the Moabites, who were "people without thinking", in Israel a healthy sense of truth stayed alive and thus provided no room for superstition (Geschichte des Volkes Israel. Von Anbeginn bis zur Eroberung Masada's im Jahre 72 nach Christus, in zwei Theilen, Leipzig 1869, 83).</page><page sequence="14">Concepts of "Demons" in Ancient Israel 51 and pictures of negative powers were part of the official cult as well as of the private belief. In Egypt the negative powers dwell mainly in the world of the dead, in Mesopotamia they dwell in the world of the living. So let me state three attempts to explain the findings at the end of this paper: First, there may be cultic reasons: The iconography includes the conviction that the less negative powers are presented, the less power do they have in reality. This goes vice versa for the protecting powers next to Yahweh. Point ing out the power of Yahweh means reducing the power of all other powers beside him, also in literary texts. This is exactly what the texts want to achieve, they follow the official theology by granting no influence to the powers beside Yahweh. Secondly, there may be a political reason: The development of a structurally detailed feudal system in Israel and in Juda was limited because both states were vassal states and dependent on the "super-powers" in Egypt and Mesopo tamia time and again. Yet a complicated system of civil servants responsible for incantations and healing requires a large and rich court and a subtle ad ministration. It may have been that this was beyond the means of the Kings of ancient Israel and Juda - or that they did not want to have such a system in a kind of opposition to the mighty rulers of their time. This means there are political and economic aspects to the fact that Yahweh acts as healer and that he includes negative as well as positive elements into his power. On the other hand, both the prophetic literature as well as the priestly texts are definitely at a distance to the state and they criticise it implicitly and explicitly, so that this may be the reason that they did not pass any literature of official incantations - if indeed there really were any at all. Thirdly, both the cultural as well as the political-economic aspects do have a theological dimension: Yahweh is not only the omnipotent healer but also the omnipotent ruler whose power is higher than those of all other powers. So the fact that Yahweh as a ruler has positive and negative aspects seems to be the reason, theologically, for the absence of individual negative powers. Though just the concept of the omnipotence of Yahweh changes during the further theological development which is characterised by a kind of individualisation and democratisation of the demonological concept. Only after monotheism was established in a way that mentioning demons was no danger any more, a concrete demonology develops under Greek and Persian influence. An ethical orientated monotheistic "deed-consequence nexus", which is at a distance to the state, does not prevent the power of demons, but it can rather help intro ducing a dualistic level below Yahweh. This is shown in the book of Tobit. As a result of this, a concept of demons develops, which plays an important role in Judaism and Christianity, theologically and dogmatically. Believers sought to free God from his more negative and sinister features. As a result, the concept of Yahweh as the sole cause and origin of anything lost its full impact, being expanded by the notion of a hierarchical structure of angels and "demons". While on the one hand this brought some relief to the concept of God; on the other hand, it allowed a hidden polytheism to subsist within the framework of monotheistic religions.</page><page sequence="15">52 Henrike Frey-Anthes Figures Fig. 1: Tell el- 'Agul\ Middle Bronze Age/ Late Bronze Age from: Keel/Uehlinger, Gotter, 89 (fig. 90a) Fig. 3: Burney-Relief from: D.
