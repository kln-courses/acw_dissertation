<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVERDAY MIRACLE, Gustav Eckstein, 146 pp., $3.50, Harper and Row, New York, 1965. Everyday Miracle is a selection of chapters from two earlier books, Lives and Everyday Miracle by Gustav Eckstein and is illustrated by Kevin McIntyre. It is a very interesting and provocative series of stories about a variety of animals including birds, cats, dogs, and an ape. Dr. Eckstein, a physiologist, reports in a clear narrative style his observations of the behavior of a number of animals which resided in his laboratory at the University of Cincinnati. While animal behavior is frequently interpreted in anthropomorphic terms, the ideas are intriguing and should encourage youngsters to look at their pets and other animals with greater compassion and understanding as well as stimulate a few to do more serious observations. The book would seem to lend itself well for use as enrichment material in the areas of either science or reading. The narrative style is appeal- ing, the vocabulary challenging, and the ideas should provoke thoughtful discussion and debate. For the Non-Science Major LABORATORY EXERCISES FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE By 0. Williams, Ph.D., E. K. Bonde, Ph.D. and N. Younggren, Ph.D., 189 Pages, Wirebound. $3.5O This series of carefully developed exercises is designed especially for the use of living or freshly killed material such as bean plants, pea plants, frogs, fruit flies and locally obtainable pond organisms. Where such specimens are unobtainable or too difficult for students to handle, the authors present exercises using pre- pared slides for study of the woody stem, and preserved specimens for dissection of the fetal pig, sheep's brain and eye, and inner ear of the shark. Included are vertebrate reproduction; plant and animal genetics; diversity of organi- zation, maintenance and reproduction in major plant and animal groups; and a consideration of the relationship of organisms to their envi- ronment.
