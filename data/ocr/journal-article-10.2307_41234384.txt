After the loss of their champions, the two armies are locked in a stalemate that will be broken only by Atalanta's son, Parthenopaeus, when he is granted an àQiaxeia by Diana. At line 674 all modern editors agree in printing corpora with P and ô, but editions that appeared before Kohlmann's Teubner of 1884 regularly printed pectora, a reading broadly supported by the manuscript tradition. That this issue of text is not discussed by M. Dewar in his important edition of Book 92 might suggest that the question is settled, but Hill (ad loc.) raises the possibility that pectora may be right, and it seems to me that there are some positive considerations in favour of that read- ing. The manuscript evidence is not decisive. Although the Puteanus has long been recognized as the earliest and most reliable witness for the text of Statius' epic, readings found in the co MSS are not without value and on occasion are clearly superior to those of P3. As Hill notes (Appendix to 3.137), variation between pec- 1) The text follows D. E. Hill, P.

Brown tore/pectora and corpore/ corpora is common in the MSS, and it conforms to no pattern. In addition to the passage under dis- cussion, Hill prints a form of corpus at 2.484, 6.840, 7.314, 531, 11.631, 12.318, while pectore or pectora is accepted at 2.327, 6.886, and 12.108. Under these circumstances it is dif- ficult to consider the reading of P at 9.674 more likely. Simi- larly, we may note that pectora ferro is a common kind of line-ending (ferro /pectora in some cases)4. Accordingly, it may be that the text of co at 9.674 merely represents an assimilation of corpora ferro to a common pattern5, but it may also be possible that corpora ferro is a corruption of the more familiar line-ending6. In any case, the common confusion of pectora and corpora makes it hazardous to pronounce corpora ferro the lectio difficilior. The issue must be decided on grounds of sense, and here pectora can be judged to be preferable. The noun corpus occurs numerous times in the Thebaid, and in the singular it occupies a wide semantic range. In the plural, however, its usage seems to be more restricted when applied to human beings: in the majority of instances corpora is used of dead bodies (1.608, 2.592, 2.713, 3.128, 3.137, 3.194, 4.508, 5.254, 7.206, 7.607, 7.761, 8.700, 9.158, 9.264, 9.370, 10.284, 11.599, 11.631, 12.24, 12.69, 12.96, 12.103, 12.137, 12.151, 12.289, 12.717, 12.796). Related to this are those passages in which corpora is used of passive bodies, often at the point of death (5.383 f. inertia ... I corpora-, 8.419f. in corpora ferrum I omne cadit; 10.450 cap- tiuaque corpora; cf. 12.68 f. captiua ... I corpora). This seems to constitute a general pattern, to which there are but a few exceptions. At 10.392 Amphion sees through the darkness bodies moving, but these seem to be indistinct forms (procul . . . I nescio quid uisu dubium incertumque moueri I corporaque ire uidet). The Theban warriors who seek to ambush Tydeus J.B.Hall, Notes on Statius' Thebaid Book I and II, ICS 14 (1989) 227-241, at 22 7 f., contends that the text of the Thebaid printed in modern editions is still far from sound. 4) E.g. 2.567, 5.160f., 5.214, 7.311, 9.309, 11.506; cf. Verg. Aen. 1.355; Ov. Fast. 2.831, Met. 9.614, Pont. 4.12.31, Rem. 19; Luc. 7.323, 7.528, 8.663; Sil. 6.87, 6.480f.; Val. Fi. 6.110, 6.575; see P. Venini on Stat. Theb. 11.506 (Thebaidos liber undecimus, Firenze 1970). 5) It is noteworthy that pectora telo at 2.637 is reported by 2 3.152 as pectora ferro. 6) corpora ferro also occurs elsewhere as a line-ending: Ov. Her. 3.145, Met. 12.490; Luc. 3.463, 7.582.</page><page sequence="3">Where Armies Clash: Statius, Thebaid 9.674 323 are described as lectissima bello I corpora (2.483 f.), but this is one of the passages in which pectora is a variant and so the text is uncertain7. It would be going too far to claim that Statian usage excludes corpora at 9.6748, and there are earlier passages that support this text. A particularly good parallel is Verg. Georg. 4.217-218, in which worker bees are described in language recalling human war- riors: et corpora bello I obiectant pulchramque petunt per uulnera mortem. Here again, however, the paradosis is not unanimous; the early Palatine MS (P) reads pectora, thus presenting us with a familiar choice of variants9. In this case, however, corpora seems preferable: not only does it have better manuscript authority, but the less obviously anthropomorphic corpora seems more appropri- ate to bees, and, moreover, bello evokes the dangers of battle more generally than the pointed ferro of the Statian passage. In Thebaid 9, on the other hand, there is a more precise picture. Dewar (ad loc.) sees in Statius' praebent obnixi corpora ferro an echo of Vergil's description of tne death of Cupencus, dedit obuia ferro /pectora (Aen. 12.540 f.). The language is indeed simi- lar, and the presence of pectora here may give support to that reading in Statius, but the narrative context is different. Rather than the death of an individual warrior, Statius is describing two armies locked in equipoise, and, consequently, a more telling Ver- gilian passage is Aeneid 10.354-361: 7) Statius' description may have been inspired by passages such as Verg. Aen. 8.606 bello lecta iuuentus, and 9.272 f. lectissima matrum I corpora; cf. Cattili. 64.4 ledi iuuenes (perhaps also 68.101, (lecta) . . . pubes, if Eldik's supplement is correct); Val. FI. 6.559 (of cattle) lecta . . . corpora. None of these passages, how- ever, can be used to establish Statius' text with certainty. 8) This is not the place to engage in a detailed investigation of the usage or corpus in Latin poetry, but it may be pertinent to observe that there seems to have been some narrowing of the poetic usage of the word, at least in the plural. An interesting example is the technical expression corpora curare, regularly used in prose of refreshing troops (Liv. 3.2.10 corpora cibo somnoque curant; 9.37.7, 25.38.22, 34.16.5; cf. TLL s.v. corpus 1012. 57f.), which Vergil adapts to epic narra- tive (Georg. 4.187 corpora curant; Aen. 3.510f. passimque in litore sicco I corpora curamus; 8.607 fessique et equos et corpora curant; cf. Enn. Ann. 367 Skutsch). Neither Statius nor his contemporary Silius Italicus takes over this phrase, although both poets are much under the influence of Vergil and wrote epics with numerous battle scenes. The phrase, however, continued to be used by historians (Curt. 3.8.22), and so may have been judged inappropriate to poetry. 9) Geymonat (P. Vergili Maronis opera, 1 orino 197 j, ad loc.) seems to suggest the influence of Georg. 4.83 {angusto in pectore) and Aen. 8.29 {tristi turbatus pectora bello), although the sense is different.</page><page sequence="4">324 Christopher G.

Although properly descriptive of the details of the simile, stant obnixa omnia contra (359) provides a succinct summation of the situation on the battlefield as the armies face each other. Statius' use of obnixi recalls the Vergilian passage, as does the general context: two armies stand in a deadlock that will only be broken by the aQioxeia of a 'Heldenknabe' with a tragic future. In the Aeneid that young warrior will be Pallas, in Statius he will be the similarly tragic Parthenopaeus10. With the carefully balanced chiasmus of line 360 and the polyptoton of the following line Vergil evokes and develops a tradition of martial narrative that goes back to the Iliad11. Statius has already exploited this tojioç earlier in the poem12, and so de- scribes a similar narrative moment in Book 9 through a different poetic strategy, viz. by developing an antithesis between front and back. Statius' description ends with bostique cruento I dant animas et terga negant (676 f.). This latter phrase, as Dewar notes (ad loc. and on 470), is an ingenious adaptation of an expression like terga dant. Showing one's back to the enemy was for the Roman a clear sign of cowardice13. The chest, in sharp contrast, was commonly 10) As is frequently noted, Parthenopaeus owes much to Vergil's Camilla (cf. D. Vessey, Statius and the Thebaid [Cambridge 1973] 71; Dewar, pp. xxx-xxxi), but Pallas was also an important model: see L. Legras, Étude sur la Thebaide de Stace (Paris 1905) 112, 218-219; W.Schetter, Untersuchungen zur epischen Kunst des Statius (Wiesbaden 1960) 43-48. 11) See the passages collected by Skutsch on Enn. Ann. 584; cf. also Harri- son on Verg. Aen. 10.360-361. To the texts assembled by these commentators, add Quint. Smyrn. 8.74-75 œç oï y' àXkr'Koiow èjiéxQciov syxzi ô' £YX°Ç / ov'uç&gt;éQBx' àojuôi ô' àojiiç, èjt' àvépa ô' fiiev àvf|p. 12) Theb. 8.398-401 iam clipeus clipeis, umbone repellitur umbo, I ense minax ensis, pede pes et cuspide cuspis: I sic obnixa acies pariter suspiria fumant, I admotaeque nitent aliena in casside aristae. As at Verg. Aen. 10.359 and Theb. 9.674, the tense opposition between troops is expressed by obnixa^ and Statius further clarifies the situation by the striking image of the plume reflected in the helmet of the soldier opposite. 13) A clear example is anon. fr. 28.4f.

Ovid contrasts the Roman style of fighting with that of the Parthians, expressing the opposition of front and back in an effective chiasmus: tergaque Parthorum Romanaque pectora (Ars 1.209). Lucan also exploits this anti- thesis in passages that depict confused battle (an important motif in a poem that deals with civil war and its concomitant blurring of categories). At 4.467f. Vulteius, surrounded by the enemy and despairing of victory, . . . posât spe proelia nulla I incertus qua terga daret, qua pectora bello. Similarly, Pompey is attacked on all sides by his assassins: cum terga sortent et pectora ferro (8.663). Statius' account of the deadlocked forces at Theb. 9.670 ff. is built around the same contrast. With lines 676 f. he rounds off the description begun at 674 by restating in general terms the tense situation described in detail in the intervening lines. In this light, we seem to have an example of ring-composition: terga negant would stand as the natural counterpart to a phrase like praebent . . . pectora ferro, which sets out the specific op- position of the passage. The reading adopted by modern editors, praebent . . . corpora ferro, fails to establish the essen- tial point that the troops face each other in the heat of battle, a detail which colours the description that follows15. Recent translators, it seems, have sensed the inadequacy of the familiar text. Although he prints praebent obnixi corpora ferro in the recent Bude edition (Paris 1991-1993), R. Lesueur appears to translate pectora ("ils exposent obstinément leur poitrine au description of Diomedes' àoioreia): pauidi tergaque dantes I petierunt trepidae moenia Troiae. 14; ci. catuil. t&gt;&lt;*.Jjy ^or remues; nosuuus naua tergo, sea jorii peciore notus; Sen.

In view of the symbolic charge borne by pectus, it would be pointless to object that pectora in the Statian passage would imply that the opposing forces had dropped their shields. 15) Ine situation is expressed succinctly by nee se uestigia mutant: I stat cuneo defixa acies (676 f.). Dewar understands cuneus as 'phalanx', but that meaning seems inappropriate here. It is probable that cuneus brings a Roman colouring to a description of Greek battle, suggesting the block-like formation of the cobors, a term used by Statius at 674. For cuneus in this sense, see OLD s.v.</page><page sequence="6">326 Christopher G.
