"Feminist Studies in Religion and Literature: A Methodological Reflection," JAAR, 44 (June 1976), 317-325. Christ proceeds "from the concrete case of Iher] own feminist studies in religion and literature," commenting on four methodological deci sions she has made about the relation between women's experience, religion, and literature in the works she studies. (1) She assumes a relation between literature and life, judging a work by "the ade quacy of its representation of women's experience," in order "to discover paths to her own future" as a woman. (2) She assumes that literature has a religious dimension. (3) She assumes, "In develop ing an approach to the spiritual quest in modern women's writing," that the most useful approach is neither the "Romantic" emphasis on the poet as a religious genius and the art work as a revelation of Being (Stanley Romaine Hopper), nor the formalist or autonomist view of literature (Nathan Scott, Sallie TeSelle), but a combination of the representational view that shows literature "mediating a form of otherness" (Giles Gunn) and the story and religion approach (Stephen Crites, Michael Novak). (4) She assumes a sex-differentiated, rather than a sex-neutral, approach "in recognition of the fact that cultural conditioning, and perhaps biology, have encouraged propensities in perception and action which are different for women and men." [RD] 3902 Mclntire, C. T. The Ongoing Task of Christian Historiography. Toronto: Institute for Christian Studies, 1974. Mclntire calls for "a historiography which itself examines the history of peoples, societal structures and institutions, ideas, things, mores and pat terns of life, according to the sort of insights and values provided by a Christian view of man, society, norms, history, the world and the whole of created reality." However secularized they have become, the legacy of Christian assumptions within historiography includes the following: historical time, periodization, the process character of history, the universality of history, historical contextuality, human beings as the makers and creators of history, and the coherence and meaningfulness of reality. The ongoing task is (1) to make func tional certain primary biblical insights into the nature of human beings, the meaning of justice and love, etc. (2) to study the role of religion in the making of culture—remembering that secularization is the relocation rather than the disappearance of religion (3) to study what historical judgments to make and what norms to use in making them (4) to engage in extensive historical revision, "rework ing the framework within which we view the history of western civiliza tion and other civilizations." 3903 Seerveld, Calvin G. A Turnabout in Aesthetics to Understanding. Toronto: Institute -for Christian Studies, 1974. T. S. Eliot Bibliography / 56</page><page sequence="3">wrote that "In a world of fugi.ti.ves/ the person taking the opposite direction/ will appear to be running away." Seerveld, in his 1972 inaugural address as a Senior Member of the Institute for Christian Studies, issues a timely and timeless challenge to Christian aesthe ticians to go against the mainstream of secularism and insist upon a turnabout. Seerveld's term is "doxological aesthetics": art not for art's sake, but art for God's sake, combining theory and practice in a fashion which helps to lead God's weak little people In develop ing a biblically reforming, wide-open Christian culture, a minority culture in our post-christian age." IVRM] 3904 Smith, Robert W. , ed. Christ &amp; the Modern Mind. Downers Grove, 111.: InterVarsity Press, 1972. viii + 312 pp. This survey by 23 Christian scholars of various disciplines in the arts and sciences is designed "to provide undergraduates with handles for better grasping college course work." Each writer points out aspects of and issues within his discipline that have especial relevance to Christian belief and practice. Articles of particular interest to C&amp;L readers are listed below. Whitlock, Baird W. "The Humanities," pp. 3-17. The human ities form an essential part of the Christian's education. Studies in philosophy and religion enable him to examine and understand beliefs. Awareness of the nature of language and of literary forms is essential to valid reading of the Scriptures. Art and music reflect the spirit of their age, be it Christian or secular. Art forms such as drama can contribute greatly to communicating the Gospel. The Chris tian student encountering problems in the humanities should face them with hope, openness, and commitment. Grabill, Virginia Lowell. "English Literature," pp. 19-27. "English is not commas and term papers but the cultivation of vivid sensation, logical thought, and honest evaluation— all matters essential to the Christian and other men who desire abundant life." Literature challenges the student to confront the basic issues of life. Knowledge of the Bible and of Christian doctrine often helps in understanding it, and often literature presents Christian truths covertly. King Lear, Macbeth, and Othello provide illustrations of these points. Contemporary literature includes the work of a number of excellent Christian authors. A Christian student trying to think through the problem of "dirty" language should appreciate the complexity of the questions involved. Feaver, Douglas D. "Classical Languages," pp. 29-36. Rott, Dale D. "Drama," pp. 41-46. Smith, Robert W. "Speech," pp. 47-58. (Deals largely with ethical implications of the public speaker's activity.) Pike, Kenneth L. "Language," pp. 59-68. 3905 Zuck, John E. "Tales of Wonder: Biblical Narrative, Myth and Fairy Stories," JAAR, 44 (June 1976), 299-308. Argues against Bibliography / 57</page><page sequence="4">Hans W. Frei (The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative, New Haven; Yale U. P., 1974) that the primary quality of biblical narrative is realism and that myth should be dismissed as a literary category for categor izing it. Instead, as M. Eliade suggests, biblical stories, though set in identifiable historical time, narrate extraordinary events and cannot systematically be distinguished from fairy stories. The primary distinction that can be made is "in terms of experienced re ligious significance": as Tolkien says, "The Gospels contain a fairy story, or a story of a larger kind which embraces all the essence of fairy-stories." In fact, "mythopoeie" fiction can reawaken religious awareness, as the works of Tolkien and C. S. Lewis have demonstrated. [RD] SIXTEENTH CENTURY 3906 Traci, Philip. "Religious Controversy in Romeo and Juliet: The Play and its Historical Context," Mich A, 8 (Winter 1976), 319-325. The play focuses on "the conflict inherent in a religiously mixed marriage." Juliet is interpreted as being a pun on "Jew," and Romeo is seen as a Roman Catholic. This view is further substantiated by similar explanations of other character names and roles. [MHM] SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 3907 Arnold, Marilyn. "Milton's Accessible God: The Role of the Son in Paradise Lost," MiltonQ, 7 (1973), 65-72. The Father in PL is inaccessible. The Son spans the gap between God and man—in fact, dramatically the Son is the God of the earth, who speaks for man, becomes man, and dies to redeem man. As the poem develops, the Son's role as God of love expands. He begins his missions wearing the armor and might of the Father, but he ends giving his life that man might be redeemed. 3908 Asals, Heather. "The Tetragrammaton in The Temple," SCN, 31 (1973), 48-50. One sees at work in The Temple Herbert's know ledge of the various forms of the Name of God as an expression of God's essence and all essence ("I AM"), as the "Lord" who is Christ reborn in man as his ruler, and the "Almighty God" who claims as his own all the "might" of the Poet. In its most fully realized form in The Temple, the Name is an indication of God's promise and of the ultimate unity of past, present, and future in the I AM of his nature. 3909 Blackburn, Thomas H. "Paradise Lost and Found: The Meaning and Function of the 'Paradise Within' in Paradise Lost," MiltonS, 5 (1973), 191-211. The "Paradise Within" is promised by Michael in Bk. XII. It differs both from the irrecoverably lost Paradise of Eden, and from the "perfect glorification" of the faithful in an ac tual eternal paradise at the end of the world. To partake of the blessedness of the present "Paradise within" one must participate in the divine vision of time as a single moment. For Adam, Michael in the last two books of PL makes possible such participation. The reader, too, may participate in it because the style and structure of the epic encompasses in a single poetic unity both the temporal real ity of loss and the eternal actuality of God's glorification of the faithful. Bibliography / 58</page><page sequence="5">3910 Canfield, J. Douglas. "Blessed Are the Merciful: The Under standing of the Promise in Paradise Lost," MiltonQ, 7 (1973), 43-46. Why is it "judg'd as then best" by Milton's Messiah to give Adam and Eve the promise of redemption in "mysterious terms"? Because like Satan, Adam and Eve understand only justice and not mercy, which they must earn the right to understand in their second, more crucial trial, the temptation to despaix, by first Being merciful to each other. 3911 Chanoff, David Ross. "The Conversion of John Donne," DA, 35 (August 1974), 1041-A (Brandeis). This "spiritual biography" charts the major phases of Donne's conversion from Catholicism to Anglicanism: Donne's initial desire to keep separate his public and private religious identities and, thus, an adversion to a Church career of any kind; an interior conversion experienced sometime be tween 1610 and 1613 when Donne moved from the despair revealed in the "Holy Sonnets" to the hope and tranquility dominant in Essays in Divinity ; a search to replace the "loss of membership in a corporate spiritual body" attendent upon his rejection of Catholicism; a will ingness to accept the Anglican Church as the only church able to provide the tranquil atmosphere in which to pursue the inner commun ion with Christ which Donne sought; and, finally, a mature spiritual commitment to Anglicanism. [SPM] 3912 Clements, A. L. "Theme, Tone, and Tradition in George Herbert's Poetry." ELR, 3 (1973), 264-83. The division of critics on Herbert's mysticism necessitates a re-examination of meditative and contemplative elements and traditions in his poetry. 3913 Coffin, Lawrence. "'Liquefaction' in Herrick's 'Upon Julia's Clothing'," CP, 6 (1973), 56-59. Essentially "liquefaction means "the melting of the soul." Although the.subject is secular love, Herrick compares the speaker's response to Julia and her finery to religious love, suggesting that as religious "liquefaction" results in incorporation of the worshiper's soul in God so this instance of secular love results in the incorporation of the speaker's soul in Juiia. 3914 Collins, Dan S. "The Buoyant Mind in Milton's Eden," MiltonS, (1973), 229-48. In their prelapsarian state Adam and Eve rise further toward angelic perfection by maintaining a willing dependence on God. Eve's dream, Adam's comments on astronomy and the birth of his own consciousness, his search for a helpmeet, and his experience of sexual attraction—all these do not anticipate the fall. The eventual reversal of this upward movement occurs at the apex of a spiritual ascent and only after the intellectual sufficiency of man kind to prosper in Eden has been established. 3915 Cragg, Gerald R. Freedom and Authority: A Study of English Thought in the Early Seventeenth Century. Philadelphia : The Westminster Press, 1975. 334 pp., $15.00. Based on study of more than 600 primary sources, most of them in seventèenth-century editions, this is a book which brings history to vivid life. Cragg (recently deceased), who taught Ecclesiastical History at Andover Newton, Bibliography / 59</page><page sequence="6">obviously enjoyed both, the excesses and the insights of seventeenth century religious and political disputations, and he is able to transmit his own fascination to the reader. His thesis is thoroughly substantiated: that although the tension hetween freedom and author ity does not exhaust the intellectual concerns of the period from 1600 to 1640, it certainly embraces a large proportion of them. Free dom and Authority belongs in the library of every Christian college because of its insights into recurrent themes and techniques of religious debate; and it belongs on the reading list of every in-depth course in the literature of the seventeenth century. IVRM] 3916 Doob, Penelope B. R. "A Reading of The Changeling," ELR, 3 (1973), 183-206. Renaissance psychology believed that sin, which involves the overthrow of reason and the loss of the image of God, was best symbolized by madness, bestiality, and deformity, concepts of importance in Middleton's play. The results of unreason in the fallen world are seen By linking the Fall of Man, initial cause of sin and madness, to Beatrice's fall and ascendancy. Alse mero's search for ideal love becomes an ill-fated attempt to regain paradise. In the subplot the madness of sin is imaged in the asylum. The diamond ring,important visually and metaphorically throughout the play, ironically unites the themes of lust, pretense, and the madness of sin. 3917 Eaker, J. Gordon. "The Spirit of Seventeenth-Century Angeli canism," SCB, 33 (1973), 194-96. Hooker, Donne and Herrick, Herbert, Jeremy Taylor, the Cambridge Platonists—each in his own way found God or spiritual satisfaction in the context of this world. 3918 Egan, James. "Public Truth and Personal Witness in Milton's Last Tracts," ELH, 20 0-973)&gt; 231-248. A stylistic duality characterizes the last tracts. Their precision, directness, and lucidity anticipate the plain prose of the Restoration. But his polemical outbursts and voice of witness merit a style whose involu ted syntax and satiric imagery are the antithesis of plainness. Although the passionate, personal dimensions of this style liken it to the slashing invective of his earliest tracts, Milton's rhetorical objectives are far different in 1959-60. The voice of witness utters profound Christian truths which must be spoken regardless of their persuasive force. 3919 Fortin, Rene E. "The Climactic Similes of Paradise Regained : 'True Wisdom' or 'False Resemblance'?" MlltonQ, 7 (1973), 39-43. What we have in the strangely equivocal similes of Hercules and Antaeus, and of Oedipus and the Sphinx, is an apparently deliberate evocation of the anti-Christian values embodied in their traditions. The overt significance of the similes survives, but the latent ironies subtly remind Milton's "fit audience" of the inadequacy of classical culture. 3920 Friedman, Donald M. "Memory and the Art of Salvation in Donne's Good Friday Poem," ELR, 3 (1973), 418-42. The rejection of the analogy between spiritual progress and the motions of the heavenly bodies, suggested first byA.B. Chambers, is part of the dramatic process traced throughout the poem. The initial conceit represents Bibliography / 60</page><page sequence="7">the poet's habit of devising verbal structures as a means to cate gorize and explain moral experience. The poem's structure is based on a series of conflicts between the rationalizing rhetoric of the conceit and the speaker's reluctant acknowledgment of his own sin fulness. The defenses of the intellect surrender gradually to the meaning of Christ's sacrifice, and the speaker undergoes an inner resurrection of spirit as his memory recovers what he has always known to be true. 3921 Gallagher, Edward J. "The Wonder Working Providence as Spiri tual Biography," EAL, 10 (Spring 1975), 75-87. The history of New England (up to 1652) is presented in three books which corres pond with the three stages of man's conversion. Similarly the poems in the work are spiritual biographies in which the individuals are soldiers of Christ fighting on a battleground of good and evil (New England). [MHM] 3922 Gardiner, Judith K. "'To Heaver.,'" CP, 6 (1973), 26-36. Ben Jonson's poem focuses on how one can know true from false reli gious feeling in oneself. It is a portrait of religious melancholy, a prayer for its cessation, and a partial demonstration of its cure through faith. 3923 Goldberg, Jonathan. "Virga Iesse: Analogy, Typology, and Analogy in Miltonic Simile," MiltonS, 5 (1973), 177-190. The tree that Raphael uses in Milton's PL (V.469-503) has been understood as a cosmic tree suggesting the Great Chain of Being. But this inter pretation needs to be modified to account for the temporal aspects of the tree's growth. Once viewed as a spatial analogy for a temporal process, the tree can be said to function not only as an analogy but as a typological metaphor. 3924 Goodfellow, William S. "Adam's Encounter with God in Paradise Lost," MiltönQ, 7 (1973), 103-107. Milton is deliberately vague as to the identity of "God"—whether he is the Father or the Son—in Adam's first interview with the deity. 3925 Gray, J. C. "Emptiness and Fulfillment as Structural Pattern in Paradise Lost," PR, 53 (1973), 78-91. Throughout PL meta phors of filling or emptying containers are a key to the spiritual condition of characters and locales. The metaphors are repeated enough that a pattern is described, the full impact of which is real ized when the Word of God is presented as a self-defined container paradoxically emptying itself in order to fulfill itself. The poem begins with the partial emptying of Heaven and the ironic filling of Hell. The poem ends looking forward to the time when Hell's numbers will be full, when the process of filling and emptying will cease. 3926 Gray, J. C. "Paradox in Paradise Lost," MiltonQ, 7 (1973), 76-82. With one exception the contradictions in the paradoxes spoken by Satan are real and irresolvable. God's paradoxes express ineffable religious mysteries. The narrator's paradoxes used in describing Eden and the perfect innocence of Adam and Eve are only superficially con tradictory. Unfällen Adam and Eve do not speak paradoxes, but it is through the paradoxical statements spoken to him by Michael in Book Bibliography / 61</page><page sequence="8">XII that Adam suddenly comprehends God's scheme of salvation. 3927 Hageman, Elizabeth. H. "Recent Studies in Herrick," ELR, 3 (1973), 462-71. Herrick can no longer be dismissed as a triv ial, slightly immoral poet. He not only has vitality and wit, but a Christian, sacramental view of the world. Examination of Herrick's use of the Church Calendar would be useful. 3928 Harada, Jun. "Self and Language in the Fall," MiltonS, 5 (1973), 213-228. By beguiling the speaker into a selfhood which is nothing but a Satanic appetence, the form of soliloquy be trays itself as the form of self-tempting in Eve's soliloquy and in its echo by Adam at the Fall. 3929 Hedges, James L. "Thomas Adams, Robert Burton, and Herbert's 'Rope of Sand'," SCN, 31 (1973), 47-48. A discussion of the "Rope of Sand" image in Herbert's poem "The Collar" as it appears in Tilley's Dictionary of Proverbs, Burton's Anatomy (1624 edition), and in Thomas Adams. 3930 Hovey, Kenneth A. "The Theology of History in Of Plymouth Plan tation and its Predecessors," EAL, 10 (Spring 19/5), 47-66. Bradford cited three early accounts of Plymouth ("A Brief Relation Of the Discovery and Plantation of New England," "Mourt's Relation," Edward Winslow's record) in his ecclesiastical history of the settle ment. Each of these early accounts contains a theological theme (God's will, providence, means) which are also present in Bradford's account. [MHM] 3931 Irwin, William J. "Allegory and Typology 'Imbrace and Greet': Anne Bradstreet's Contemplations," EAL, 10 (Spring 1975), 30 46. The poem through allegory and typology pictures a Puritan con version experience. Man is closer to God than any part of nature and has the promise of life after death. Bradstreet's view of nature is consistent with her Puritan religious beliefs. [MHM] 3932 Johnson, Lee M. "Milton's Blank Verse Sonnets," MiltonS, 5 (1973), 129-153. At critical points in their destinies, charac ters in Milton's last three poems often speak in blank verse sonnets to pledge their acceptance of one another, of themselves, or of divine purposes. Generally they recall and extend the traditional function of the form as a love-poem. 3933 Keogh, J. G. "Milton's Paradise Lost, II. 552," Expl, 31 (1973)" Item 61. Milton's "Thir song was partial" may be considered both as pun and musical metaphor, thus resolving the differing inter pretations of "biased" and "imperfect." The devil's party is thus compared to the simple but regimented harmony of a part-song, a vulgar and vernacular conceit opposed to the normal seventeenth-century image of "the choirs of heaven, the freer and more complex Latin polyphony. 3934 Knott, John R. , Jr. "Bunyan's Gospel Day: A Reading of The Pilgrim's Progress," ELR, 3 (1973), 443-61. Pilgrim's Progress embraced the figurative language of the Bible as a vehicle of divine Bibliography / 62</page><page sequence="9">truth. Bunyan moves from the "carnal" world in which the urgings of the sense must be resisted, into spiritual landscapes that embody the "fatness" of Canaan. The narrative climaxes in a celebration of the joys of Beulah and the New Jerusalem that insists on the reality of Scriptural bliss and justifies his dramatic use of the figurative reading of human experience, based upon the Exodus, that he learned from the Hebrews. 3935 Labriola, Albert C. "Donne's 'The Canonization': Its Theolog ical Context and It Religious Imagery," HLQ, 36 (327-39. The word "patterne," which appears in the last line of the poem, helps to explain the theological context that is humorously applied to the lovers' relationship. In Donne's sermons the word describes the active and mutual love among Divine Persons; in the poem the lovers embody the "Idea of love" exemplified among the Divine Persons. Images associated with trinitarian unity (the dove, phoenix, and eagle) are applied to the lovers' union. 3936 Lawry, Jon S. " 'The Fairthful Herdman's Art' in Lycidas," SEL, 13 (1973), 111-125. The despair with which the speaker in Lycidas begins the elegy suggests that he has failed in his faith ful herdman's art." Similarly, the past tense of the last eight lines suggests that the song is finished. To avoid being an apostate or a blind mouth to his sheep, the speaker must be "resurrected" by the three divine herdmen—Apollo, Peter, and Michael. 3937 Laymen, B. J. "Tourneur's Artificial Noon: The Design of The Revenger's Tragedy," MLQ, 34 (1973), 20-35. Proponents of a "firm moral scheme" in Tourneur attribute the power of his meta phorical night at noon to the distinctness of the two realms; but what the play enforces instead is that no distinction exists. Vin dice's identification with the skull is total; together they are the sole agent in a world where no effective counteragent, and therefore no authentic dramatic conflict, is allowed to exist. 3938 Maclean, Hugh. "Paradise Lost (1674) V.636-40, and 666," MiltonQ, 7 (1973), 8-11. By Milton's additions here, the actual emergence of evil into the cosmos of the poem ("Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain") occurs at line 666, i.e., at the line bear ing the number given in Revelation xiii as that of the beast with seven heads and ten horns. 3939 McCown, Gary M. "Milton and the Epic Epithalamium," MiltonS, 5, (1973), 39-66. Comparison of Milton's with the classical epithalamium (esp. of Catullus) and with those of the hexameral poets (esp. DuBartas, Andrew Ramsey, and Jacob Cats), with observations on how secular elements have been adapted by Milton. 3940 Mollenkott, Virginia R. "Milton and Women's Liberation: A Note of Teaching Method," MiltonQ, 7 (1973), 99-103. Although Milton's commitment to the seventeenth-century concept of universal hierarchy forced him to view woman as created inferior to man, histor ical, personal, and literary perspectives show him to have liberalized that interpretation. Esp. interesting among the points made: the Bibliography / 63</page><page sequence="10">primary blame for the Fall is placed on Adam's reactions rather than on Eve herself; Eve showed her maturity by initiating the reconcil iation with Adam and God; Truth is feminine (Areopagitica); and in PL there is an androgynous muse which, implies a bisexual nature in God. 3941 Mollenkott, Virginia R. "The Wheat, the Chaff, and the Aborted Duel," CP, 6 (1973), 38-43. God's use of the heavenly scales to deny Gabriel's impulse to duel with Satan symbolizes the necessity for tolerance and suspension of ultimate judgments until God's own time is accomplished. Like Gabriel's obedient conquest of his own ego, authentic Christian warfare is internal. 3942 Mulder, John R. "George Herbert's The Temple: Design and Methodology," SCN, 31 (1973), 37-45. Using capital letters and italics for design, Herbert has contrived a dual authorship for the poems in The Temple: one author is the poet, who records his experi ences from moment to moment; the other is God, who orders those experiences so that the Poet may understand his presumptuous error and may, through the darkness of the understanding, perceive the light of faith. 3943 Onuska, John T., Jr. "The Equation of Action and Passion in Samson Agonistes," PQ, 52 (1973), 69-84. Whether Samson will be God's active champion or patient saint is his dilemma. Samson rejects the passivity which disguises itself as retired ease in the offers of Manoa and Dalila, and he is unsympathetic to the notion of patient endurance. But even the activity which he inclines to is denied him. Only when he submits himself totally to God's purposes does it become clear that the dilemma which has vexed him is non-existent in the eyes of God where all things done in his service are identical. 3944 Patrides, C. A. "An Open Letter on the Yale Edition of De Doctrina Christiana," MiltonQ, 7 (1973), 72-74. The editor of this edition appears not to have taken advantage of developments since publication of his own study of the treatise in 1941: the formidable antecedents in early Fathers like Tertullian and Neoplatonists like Plotinus or the Cambridge Platonists are eschewed in a remarkable display of "gross partisanship." 3945 Pecheux, Mother Mary Christopher, 0. S. U. "Milton's Paradise Lost," Expl, 32 (1973): Item 28. Milton goes beyond the biblical account when he specifies that it was from the left side of Adam that Eve was drawn. This can symbolize both the closeness of their love or (since the left side is the unfavorable side) something sinister. 3946 Pollock, John J. "George Herbert's Enclosure Imagery," SCN, 31 (1973), 55. Herbert uses images of enclosure to structure a num ber of his poems and to emphasize the importance of the Eucharist. In "The Pilgrimage" initial images of unfilled enclosure create a psycho logical tension in the reader that is resolved by the final image of a filled enclosure. Images of interclosure, in which two objects are said to enclose each other simultaneously, occur only when Herbert speaks of the Eucharist (as in "The Priesthood"). \ 3947 Rebhom, Wayne A. "The Humanist Tradition and Milton's Satan: Bibliography / 64</page><page sequence="11">The Conservative as Revolutionary," SEL, 13 (1973), 81-93. For Christian Humanists, one's position depended entirely on merit which was identified with moral and spiritual achievement. In this perspective only the best could rule, and Satan's conservative deri vation of merit from position would be rejected, while his rebellion would be considered a parody of true revoltuion, based on spiritual achievement. PL is compatible with the revolutionary notion Milton developed out of Christian Humanism, the notion of an order based on spiritual achievement, which is exactly the order of heaven. 3948 Rollin, Roger B. "Paradise Lost : 'Tragical—Comical—Histor ical—Pastoral," MiltönS, (1973), 3-37. The Satan plot is tragic and Aristotelian, that of Adam is pastoral tragicomic and the reconciliation with Eve comedic, that of the Son of God is historical drama and trails off into mere narrative in Bks. XI-XII, and that of the narrator begins as epic. However, the question in the last plot is "Can the poet-hero, against great odds, complete his magnum opus?" This remains to be answered by the reader. 3949 Rosenberg, D.M. "Style and Meaning in Milton's Anti-Episcopal Tracts," Criticism, 15 (1973), 43-57. By discovering a more individualistic and active self-expression, Milton resolved the styl istic tension between the pulpit and pamphleteering modes that reflected his conflict between the ideology of Puritan reform and his own evolving concept of individual liberty. 3950 Shawcross, John T. "Two Comments," MiltonQ, 7 (1973), 97-98. [On Book V of PL and the Beast of Revelation; "gumms of gluten ous heat" in Comus. ] Notes in M(£ by Hugh Maclean and James Flosdorf suggest that the significance of the beast of Revelation, 666, is different from that proposed, and that the sexual implications of "glutenous gumms" in Comus are indeed important and justifiable. The latter implications lead to new readings of some of the passages of the masque. 3951 Slights, William W. E. " 'Elder in a Deform'd Church': The Function of Marston's Malcontent," SEL, 13 (1973), 360-373. The malcontent disguise of Altofronto-Malevole is not simply a cunning ploy to regain political sway, but a self-educating experience that results in the spiritual regeneration of major and minor characters. The banished duke extends his function to include the ministerial role of facilitating penitence (confession, contrition, and satisfac tion) in Pietro and Aurelia. Pietro in turn becomes "an excellent elder" in Malevole's "deform'd church" and aids in cleansing the court. 3952 South, Malcolm H. "The 'Vncleane Birds, in Seventy-Seven": The Alchemist," SEL, 13 (1973), 331-43. When Surly appears dis guised as a Spaniard, his attire, particularly his huge ruff, angers Ananias. Ananias compares Surly's ruff to ruffs worn by the vncleane birds, in seuenty-seuen." Although Jonson does not identify them, evidence shows that the "birds" were Catholic priests: men trained on the continent in seminaries and sent to England. 3953 Stanwood, P, G. "The Liveliness of Flesh and Blood: Herbert's 'Prayer I' and 'Love III'," SCN, 31 (1973), 52-53. The two Bibliography / 65</page><page sequence="12">poems complement each other. Both describe the reciprocal movement between the poet and his desire, and both, show him in the process of being received by the object of his affection. In each the poet strives to give sense to his devotion; and by offering himself and his love to God, he anticipates an answer (in "Prayer I") and a re ception (in "Love III"), and so mak.es them both possible. 3954 Stringer, Gary. "Learning 'Hard and Deepe': Biblical Allusion in Donne's 'A Valediction: Of My Name, in the Window,1 " SCB, 33 (1973), 227-231. Here Donne synthesizes an elaborate skein of biblical allusions to create a unified metaphoric vehicle that deter mines the thematic and imaginai structure of the poem. The result is a valedictory poem that imitates the NT archetype of the Ascension. 3955 Swaim, Kathleen M. "Flower, Fruit, and Seed: A Reading of Paradise Lost," MiltonS, 5 (1973), 155-76. The fall marks the initiation into paradox, metaphor, and potentiality. Prelapsarian praise shifts to postlapsarian prayer. Milton's poetry like his fic tion shifts from floral to fruitful, from paradise without to paradise within, from innocence to experience, from praise to prayer, from discursive to intuitive apprehension. 3956 Swaim, Kathleen M. "Lycidas and the Dolphins of Apollo," JEGP, 72 (1973), 340-49. Dolphins appropriately signal the apotheosis of Edward King, for dolphins are Christian symbols of resurrection. More largely, Apollo is the god of order, and King shares his func tions and becomes mythical, a type of Apollo and Christ. In Milton's elegy this poet's apotheosis conveys the Christian mystery of salva tion and the communal and spiritual functions of the poet and poetry. 3957 Tayler, E. W. "Milton's Samson: The Form of Christian Tragedy," ELR, 3 (1973), 306-321. The standard interpretation of Samson, that it is a drama of regeneration, has deflected attention from the way the poet has turned the technique of dramatic irony to new, and distinctively Christian, uses. But by distinguishing between plot, the sequence of events, and "form," the patterns of anticipation and fulfillment, we may arrive at a reading of the drama that reveals how Milton brilliantly surmounted the difficulties inherent in the writing of Christian tragedy. 3958 Tippens, Darryl Lee. "John Milton and St. Paul: A Comparative Study," DA, 35 (August 1974), 1125-A (Louisiana State U.). Mil ton's doctrines of "the old creation" and "the old Adam" prove him a Pauline theologian; his doctrines of "the new creation" and "the new Adam" prove him a Pauline prophet. Thus, a comparative examination of Milton's prose and Paul's epistles suggests that Paulinism is a more accurate term to describe Milton's theological position than those such as Christian, Puritan, biblical, or unorthodox; Milton is more a religious prophet than a dogmatic theologian; and Milton accepts the Pauline view that the Law is fully abrogated and superseded by the internal rule of Charity. [SPM] 3959 Tricomi, Albert H. "The Revised Version of Chapman's Bussy D'Ambois: A Shift in Point of View," SP, 70 (1973), 288-305. Bibliography / 66</page><page sequence="13">The substantiye poetic revisions of the reyised Bussy D'Ambois (1610— 11), as distinct from the original 1603-Q4 version, add up to a Stoic point of view. Specifically, the revisions have the continued effect of demeaning Bussy's heroism, of impugning his motives in undertaking a love-affair with the Contess Tamyra, and of underlying the destruc tive effects of ungoverned passion. We must finally speak of two tragedies of Bussy. 3960 ülreich, John C., Jr. "The Typological Structure of Milton's Imagery," MiltonS, 5 (1973), 67-85. Milton's imagery is not sacramental; neither is it simply abstract, for Milton recreates his own incarnational symbolism by a process of analysis, purification, and re-embodiment. Images function typologically according to the law of Coleridge's secondary Imagination, which first "dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to recreate." The basis of analogy in Milton's poetry is moral and psychological. His images are often difficult to apprehend immediately, because their effect depends largely on a conscious awareness; they are, nonetheless, concretely metaphorical, because they are grounded in the psychic activity of protagonist. 3961 Via, John A. "Milton's Antiprelatical Tracts: The Poet Speaks in Prose," MiltonS, 5 (1973), 87-127. The tracts of 1641-42 are overwhelmingly negative in their thrust, but largely overlooked are their significant positive elements: biblical apocalyptic imagery describes the national Christian regeneracy of England; this apocalyp tic imagery describes individual Englishmen whose responses to God's grace in sum will lead to national regeneracy; in a careful articula tion of his view of the character and function of the divine Christian poet in his personal statements, Milton humbly offers himself as the type for the response of others, as a model for individual regeneracy which leads to national regeneracy. 3962 Viswanathan, S. "Milton and the 'Seasons' Difference'." SEL, 13 (1973), 127-33. It strikes one to note an inconsistency by way of Milton's references to "seasons" in Paradise before the Fall, although he also portrays prelapsarian Paradise as a land of eternal spring and emphasizes that the advent of the changes and rigors of seasons are part of God's curse on fallen man. Behind this self contradiction are Milton's prolonged cogitations on the problem of the inherent goodness or corruption of nature. The stress on the corruption of nature belongs with the later stages in the composition of PL, the last books where the doctrinal gets the better of the poetic communication. 3963 Weinkauf, Mary S. "Dalila: The Worst of All Possible Wives," SEL, 13 (.1973), 135-47. Although important structurally, Dalila in Samson Agonistes cannot be seen as a heroine because she is the antithesis of what a Renaissance wife ought to be. EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 3964 Baldwin, Lewis Morse, II. "Moses and Mannerism: An Aesthetic for the Poetry of Colonial New England," DA, 35 (August 1974), Bibliography / 67</page><page sequence="14">1035-A (Syracuse). A metaphysical aesthetic not merely copied from the English masters but independently derived from Calvin's theories of absolute depravity and predeterminism characterizes the poetry of Anne Bradstreet, Edward Taylor, Michael Wigglesworth, and minor poets of the Puritan period. [SPM] 3965 Barbour, James W. "The Prose Context of Edward Taylor's Anti Stoddard Meditations," EAL, 10 (Fall 1975), 144-157. Taylor's prose is necessary to elucidate his anti-Stoddard meditations, num bers 102-11. (Stoddard held the Lord's Supper to be a converting ordinance). Images such as the wedding garment, the tailor, and the school and doctrinal arguments may be better understood when relevant portions of his prose are considered.[MHM] 3966 Blair, Joel. "Defoe's Art in A Journal of the Plague Year," SAQ, 72 (1973), 243-54. The Journal dramatizes man's confronta tion with inexplicable evil, and the unresolved moral issues—rather than its unity and structure—account for its continuing interest and power. 3967 Davie, Donald. "Edward Taylor and Isaac Watts," YR, 65 (Summer 1976), 498-515, Edward Taylor and Isaac Watts use Canticles as context for poetic expression of their situation as religious emigres ; for the Englishman, it is a social alienation, for the American, an Internal isolation from established Christianity. [R0] 3968 Egan, James. "Crusoe's Monarchy and the Puritan Concept of the Self," SEL, 13 (1973), 451-60. Studies the relationship of Robinson Crusoe to the Puritan homiletic tradition after Crusoe's spiritual rebirth. The convert's social posture reflects the ironic providential transformation of his former spiritual afflictions into the means of his moral advancement. 3969 Gatta, John, Jr. "The Comic Design of Gods Determinations touch ing his Elect," EAL, 10 (Fall 1975), 121-143. Rather than being "a labor of versified doctrine," Gods Determinations is a comedy intended to help the "poor doubting soul" free himself from "scrupu lous melancholy." Throughout the work Taylor uses such techniques as "reverent burlesque," "whimsical anthropomorphism," "optimistic satire,1 and puns to convey his doctrine. [MHM] 3970. Guibbory, Achsah. "Dryden's Views of History," PQ, 52 (1973), 187-204. Dryden's historical perspective combines three views of history. (1) The classical view shapes his use of historical allu sion, example, and parallel in its emphasis on the uniformity of human nature and the cyclical pattern of history. (2) The Christian providential view fosters his concern with universal history and allows him to combine classical parallels with Judaeo-Christian escha tology through typology. (3) He lacks a firmly modern progressionist view, but his limited faith in man's ability to learn from past exam ples causes him to assert the possibility of progress; however, his awareness of human imperfection and increasing political dissatisfac tion lead him to despair of any imminent perfection of the arts in England.

The demands on early American clergymen to produce sermons was extraordinary. To fulfill these demands Edwards often relied on sermons he had already written. He sometimes preached them again verbatim, but he also used techniques to change them—revision, deletion or addition, recasting, or combining parts of sermons [MHM] 3972 Merrett, Robert J. "Religious and Linguistic Sensibility in Augustan Poetry," TSJSNW, Vol. 6 (Calgary, Alberta: Samuel Johnson Society of the Northwest, 1973), pp. 34-44. The view that eighteenth-century poets maintained a restrained and rational stance toward religious experience is based on mistaken assumptions about the nature of poetry and of language. Parnell, Young, and Thompson valued the poetic process as vital to religious awareness. 3973 Rodmell, Graham E. "A Quaker Prisoner in France (1756)," ECS, 7 (1973), 78-92. Shows, in the light of the experiences of the Quaker prisoner William Reckitt during the Seven Yars' War, to what extent the comments of Voltaire on the Quakers (the accuracy of which was immediately challenged on behalf of his sect by Josiah Martin) do in fact represent an accurate picture of the Friends and of French reaction to them in the eighteenth century. 3974 Rogal, Samuel J. "Pope's 'Contribution' to English Hymnody," DDR, 10:1 (1973), 85-97. Pope's outright gifts to hymnody are three poems—the Messiah (1712), "The Dying Christian to His Soul" (1712), and the "Universal Prayer" (1738). More important, John and Charles Wesley leaned heavily on the pronunciation of Pope's day and tended to employ similar expressions and end-rhymes. 3975 Rogers, Donald 0. "Samuel Johnson's Concept of the Imagination," SCB, 33 (1973), 213-18. Johnson recognizes two distinct func tions of the imagination in literature: the "generalizing" function, which images natural order and brings one closer to empirical reality, and the "moral" function, which transcends empirical reality and brings one closer to moral and religious ideals. Both functions are essential, but those who choose their general representations to illus trate moral order, and even more those whose order is synthesized with Christian teachings, are to be more highly valued. 3976 Schäkel, Peter J. "Virgil and the Dean: Christian and Classi cal Allusion in The Legion Club," SP, 70 (1973), 427-38. Allu sions to Christ's cleansing first of the Gadarene demoniac and later of the Temple intensify Swift's attack on the Irish Parliament in this "his finest political satire in verse." These, like the systematic parallels Swift draws between Irish M.P.'s and the damned spirits encountered by Aeneas in Hell, are no mere ornaments but contribute to pattern: of meanings: by either Christian or classical ethical stan dards, the Parliament's campaign against the Irish clergy is the work of men mad or evil (either way, devil-possessed) and damned.

Robert Jenkin's "An Historical Examination of the Authority of General Councils" Bibliography / 69</page><page sequence="16">exercises Dryden for^ turning from the Church of England to Roman Catholicism and commends his use of the heast fable while also criti cizing its unrealistic qualities. 3978 Smith, Nora. "Robert Wallace's 'Of Venery'," TSLL, 15 (1973), 429-44. The Church of Scotland minister, Robert Wallace (1697 1771), is one of the lesser known figures of the Scottish Enlighten ment. He preferred to think he wrote as a philosopher rather than a divine. Marriage reforms were proposed in his unpublished essay of "Of Venery," including renewable contracts, divorce by mutual con sent, and postponement of child sexual education. He also includes a probably autobiographical description of masturbation in the same empirical spirit as he asserts that lust is equally natural to women as to men. 3979 Swearingen, James. "Time and the Character of the Wolf in The Hind and the Panther," CP, 6:2 (1973), 45-52. The difficulty of finding historical or legendary connections among the isolated events in the Wolf's ancestry results from the search being a mis taken line of inquiry. Various positions regarding faith and reason are represented by the beasts and the essence of each determines the esthetic form. Since the Hind is "immortal and unchanged" and hence outside of the temporal order, she cannot be presented as a charac ter that develops in the temporal process. The Panther and Fox are creatures of time and appropriately represented. The Wolf is not grounded in the temporal order, but also he is not grounded outside time—"The Wolfish crew" have no essence at all. 3980 Watts, Emily S. "The Neoplatonic Basis of Jonathan Edwards' 'True Virtue,' " EAL, 10 (Fall, 1975), 179-189. Edwards' The Nature of True Virtue shows the direct influence of Henry More's Enchiridion Ethicum. This is especially evident in Edwards' "defini tion of excellency and the concept of the nature of true virtue." Edwards' attacking Hobbes, his definition of justice, and reversal of Plato's progression of love are further evidences. [MHM] 3981 Wilkinson, Jean. "Three Sets of Religious Poems." HLQ, 36 (1973), 203-226. Herbert's Temple, Smart's Hymns and Spiritual Songs, and Keble's Christian Year are comparable religious sequences, and can be evaluated with respect to their handling of Christian theology and literary conventions. Keble's poetry is manifestly in ferior in coherence, substance, energy, and originality. Smart, whose religious poetry is the radial center of the comparisons upon which the paper is based, must be judged the equal of Herbert. NINETEENTH CENTURY 3982 Curtis, F. B. "The Geddes Bible and the Tent of the Eternals iii The Book of Urizen," BlakeN, 6 (1973), 93-94. On Plate 18 of Blake's The Book of Urizen the Eternals close off Los and Enithar mon from their sight by enclosing them in a tent. Although the biblical image of the tent is a common and traditional one, Blake was probably drawing on a passage in the introduction to the 1792 Geddes Bible. -, Bibliography / 70</page><page sequence="17">3983 Taylor, Gary.

The proverb reveals that there is another kind of .murder as evil as physical murder—the slow murder of human potential when human beings are deprived of full development. The proverb is largely directed at education. 3984 Walsh, Elizabeth. "Gerald Manley Hopkins: A Study of Counter poise," SoR, 12 (Winter 1976), 64-82. Perhaps the sacrifice Hopkins made in his vocation as priest and the anguish and despera tion he suffered were essential to his own individuality and thus to the creation of his poetry [MHM] 3985 Wheeler, Otis B. "Love among the Ruins: Hawthorne's Surro gate Religion," SoR, 10 (Summer 1974), 535-565. Dissatisfied with religious orthodoxy, Hawthorne searched for a " ' new revela tion, ' " an existential rather than doctrinal religion. His fiction dramatizes the effects of science and love as surrogate religions. His examination of the theme that love is "a sacred mystery having redemptive force for a fallen world places his works within the sacramental love tradition; however, by joining the myth of the for tunate fall to the myth of sacramental love, Hawthorne avoids, and comments on, the simplistic view of sacramental love dramatized by the sentimental novelists.

"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: From Abstraction to Humanity," SoR, 10 (Winter 1974), 80-94. With Jim as his religious teacher and spiritual father, Huck Finn develops a moral code determined by human needs and based on the values of love, compassion, and self-sacrifice which emerge from concrete human relationships. He abandons abstract, codified ideals: the sentimental and hypocritical religion of abstract Christianity, preached by the Widow and Hiss Watson; the hedonism of Pap who lacks any sense of human worth; the antiquated aristocratic code of honor practiced by the Grangerfords and dramatized in the Sherburn-Boggs episode; and the romantic ideals of Tom Sawyer. Living rather than merely preach ing morality, Jim and Huck remain isolated from the society governed by abstract codes. [SPM] TWENTIETH CENTURY 3988 Cargas, Harry James.. "Elie Wiesel and the Holocaust," Common weal, CIII (September 10, 1976), 594-596. Modern literature's questions regarding the meaning of life and humanity tend toward despair. But Holocaust Literature (Wiesel, Sach, Celan, etc.) offers a kind of hope by voicing doubts within a context that admits of God's existence. Such writings are acts of faith, questions addressed to God rather than being images of absurdity. [DK] 3989 Cheshire, Ardner Randolph, Jr. "The Theme of Redemption in the Fiction of William Stryon," DA, 35 (August 1974), 1089-A. In Stryon's novels the search for redemption is a search to find a faith Bibliography / 71</page><page sequence="18">which will "justify" a character's existence in a fragmented, absurd universe. Often characters are unable to avoid suicide, insanity, disillusionment, solipsism, or fanaticism in their'attempts to reorder their views of self, the world, and God necessitated by the destruc tion of childhood innocence. Even those characters who succeed in recreating values are subject to further disorientation. Thus, the redemptive pattern in Stryon's novels is cyclical, dependent upon the never-ending redemptive struggle to achieve a non-existent "perfect moral code" and "perfect faith."

"Certain theological trends and certain forms of contemporary narrative are interdependent, so that we cannot experience the one . . . without the other." These include these four theological trends followed by their corresponding narrative motifs, all of which are profusely illustrated by refer ences to the fiction of the late 60's and 70's: CI) the trend to let language speak and the motif of the word made flesh; (2) the trend toward the disappearance of the subject and the motif of the death of the self; (3) the trend toward the evocation of presence (or absence) and the motif of the tension between the kingdom coming and the kingd-om here; (4) the trend toward the shaping of alternate worlds and the motif of the fixing of heavenly space. The first is concerned with the narrator and diction and corresponds with the New Testament concept of proclamation; the second with character and corre sponds with redemption; the third with plot and corresponds with sanctification; the fourth with setting and corresponds with escha tology.

The key to the story is "the renegade's desire to objectify his identity in the eyes of others." He becomes a missionary, but rather than converting the heathen he attempts to become one of them.
