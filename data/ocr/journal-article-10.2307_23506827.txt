<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Letter from Judah Maccabee to Aristobulus Is 2 Maccabees 1:!ob-2:18 Authentic?" BEN ZION WACHOLDER Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, Cincinnati This essay raises anew the question of the authenticity of 2 Macc. 1:10b 2:18, which is or pretends to be a letter the Jews of Jerusalem sent to their coreligionists in Egypt.1 This lengthy letter is a fascinating document. In contrast to the so-called first letter (2 Macc. 1:1-ioa),2 which contains the * I express my profound gratitude to John Kampen who edited and helped in the annotation of this paper.

It allegedly or in fact depicts the mood of expectation soon after the holy city's liberation, hoping that the messianic ingathering of the exiles was imminent.3 The main message of the letter announces the institution of a new festival similar to the one in Esther. The festival has several names: Purification of the Temple (KaSccpiapôç toG iepou). Booths (aKqvoirqyla), and Fire ("rtGp), but not Rededication (£Y־ Kaiviapàç ) or Lights (&lt;J&gt;d&gt;ç), as it has come to be called.4 The letter includes a lengthy history of the appearance of the heavenly fire in the temple in the days of Nehemiah, followed by a claim that Judah Maccabee had emulated Nehemiah in the collection of sacred books.5 The title of the epistle names Judah, apparently Maccabee, one of the authors along with the Gerusia (Council of Elders) in Jerusalem.

The account of the death in the letter is considered false on two grounds. First, the author of the letter pretends to be writing, according to 1:18a and 2:16, shortly before Kislev 25 of 148 of the Seleucid era (s.e.) (December 164 b.c.e.). Secondly, the report of Antiochus I V's death given in this letter corresponds to what pagan historians say of the death of Antiochus III, the Great (223-187 b.c.e.) but not with that of commit himself on the question in his Commentaruber die Bûcher der Makkabaer (Dôrfflingand Franke, Leipzig, 1875), pp. 269 ff.

Herkenne,Die Briefe zu Beginn des zweiten Makkabaer huches huches (Herdersche, Freiburg im Breisgau, 1904), pp. 22-5, advance arguments for the authenticity of the letter. Some scholars have regarded 1:1-2:18 as one authentic letter dated in 188 S.E.: (See note 2 above) Gràtz, Monatschrift, v. 26, pp. 1-16; Torrey,ZAW, v.20, pp. 225-42, and NieseKritik (See note 2, above). The major Catholic scholar also argued in this manner: R.P.C. Lapide, Commentaria in Scripturam Sacram (Ludovicus Vivès, Paris, 1868). His original commentary appeared two centuries earlier, however it was reprinted in various authoritative editions in the 19th century. J.

This false and anachronistic account suffices, according to current consensus, to characterize the entire letter as an interesting but historically devoid document. This study presents arguments against dating the letter in December of 164 164 b.c.e., as is generally assumed. It will be demonstrated that the sum mer or fall of 163 b.c.e seems a more plausible date whether the document is genuine or a pseudograph. However, the removal of this major objec tion to the historicity of the letter necessitates an analysis of the other historically questionable passages. Can it be that the document is after all authentic in spite of the near unanimity that it is not? To facilitate the presentation of the arguments, I divide the letter into segments: 1.

"How," they ask, "could a professing Jew, such as Aristobulus, have served as tutor of a xenophobic and antisemitic royal family?"14 The letter must be a fabrication since the Jews of Jerusalem would have known better than to address Aristobulus by a false title. The counter argument is that too little is known about the social status of Alexandrian Jewry in this period.15 The case of Aristobulus could be an exception even if other Jews had low (9) The major exceptions are Torrey.ZAW, v. 20, pp. 229-34, and Niese,Kritik (p. 16). (10) Major studies include L.C. Valckenaer, Diatribe de Aristobulo Judaeo; Philosopho PeripateticoPeripatetico Alexandrino ( 1845) and Walter, Thoraausleger (see note 1 above). The fragments of Aristobulus are listed in Walter, pp. 264—6. They are collected in German translation by Walter inJiidische Schriften aus hellenistisch-rbmischer Zeit (Gerd Mohn, Gùtersloh, 1975), v. 3, bk. 2, pp. 269-79. F°r the Greek text of Eusebius, see K.

This is attested in Clements, Stromata I, 150, 1 ; V, 97, 7; Anatolius, itepi toG ndcaxoc, in F.usebius, Hut. Eccl. VII, 32, 16; Eusebius, Prep. Evang.Evang. IX, 6, 6a. For a discussion of Ptolemy VI, see Pauly-Wissowa, v. 46, pp. 1702-19. (12) Walter, Ibid., has a thorough analysis and discussion of the arguments advanced against the authenticity of the fragments of Aristobulus on pp. 35-123. (13) Most scholars agree that these two identifications are intended in the work even if it is a forgery: Grimm, Handbuch, pp. 36-7; Keil, Commentar, pp. 270-1; Bunge, Unter suchungen,suchungen, pp. 53-5; Habicht,2. Makkabaerbuch, p. 202; Goldstein,/Maccabees, pp. 545 and 549. Starcky and Abel, Livres, p. 29, suggest the letter may have been written by a priestly contemporary of Judas. Torrey, ZAW, v. 20, pp. 230-4 and Niese, Kritik, pp. 16-9, try to explain away Judas and talk about Antiochus VII Sidetes. (14) On the contrary, Ptolemy VI Philometor seems to have had a favorable attitude to the Jews. Evidence for this can be found injosephus ,Against Apion 2:49 and Jewish Antiquities 12:387-8 and 13:62-73. See also Walter, Thoraausleger, pp. 38-9, J.J. Collins, The Sybilline Oracles of Egyptian Oracles of Egyptian Judaism (Scholars Press, Missoula, 1972), p. 32 and Pauly-Wissowa, v. 46, p. 1712. (15) H. Will rich, und Griechen vor der makkabàischen Erhebung (Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, Gôttingen, 1895), p. 163, advances the case that it would have been impossible for a Jew to achieve this status. The counterargument is stated by Walter, Thoraausleger, pp. 39-40•</page><page sequence="6">94 BEN ZION WACHOLDER [6] standing. Some hold the view that the Jews of Jerusalem may have over stated the honor bestowed upon Aristobulus so as to flatter him, thus invalidating the authenticiy of the title "teacher."16 Presumably, an epithet such as "teacher of King Ptolemy" would have embarrassed Aris tobulus if false, particularly if he was a prominent man in Alexandria; and presumably the officials of Jerusalem were well acquainted with his actual position. Nothing in the address to Aristobulus casts suspicion on the letter's authenticity. Fragments, incontrovertibly authored by Aristobulus, contain direct addresses to the king, apparently Ptolemy VI.17 These writings state that he had responded to Ptolemy's questions concerning the problem of anthropomorphic usages in Scripture.18 Walter says that the attributions of Aristobulus to Ptolemy VI are pretentious since a Ptolemaic King would not stoop to debate such matters with a lowly Jew.19 Nonetheless it would seem that once one grants a) that Aristobulus himself cited the king and b) that he wrote these words during the lifetime of Ptolemy VI, two points even Walter accepts as true,20 the statements attributed to the king cannot be branded as false. Who would have dared to aggrandize himself by quoting a living pharaoh falsely? The fragments attest that Aristobulus probably did in fact serve as some kind of teacher to Ptolemy VI.21 But even if he did not, the authorities in Jerusalem who had read his book were sufficiently impressed to address him as "teacher of King Ptolemy." Thus whether one accepts this title literally or loosely, the claims by Aristobulus tend to offer circumstantial confirmation to the title found in the letter's address, and by extension, give a prima facie genuineness to the letter as a whole. Other aspects of the letter's address have received little consideration as they bear on the problem of authenticity. Aristobulus is addressed as a descendant of the high priestly family. In contrast to Judah, who is placed last in the list of senders, Aristobulus appears first of the addressees, preceding the Jews of Egypt. It is difficult to account for such a formula (16) R. Dor an, "Studies in the Style and Literary Character of 2 Maccabees" (unpub lished Th.D. dissertation, Harvard, 1977), p. 18, makes this suggestion. Walter also states this argument on p. 36 however then goes on to discount it. K.H. Rengstorff suggests that he was given this name because he wrote a work of interpretation of the Pentateuch and dedicated it to the king, suggesting a "teacher" in the rabbinic sense ("&amp;tô&lt;i0K0cX0&lt;;," Theological Theological Dictionary of the New Testament v, 2, p. 151). (17) See note 11 above. The fragments addressed to Ptolemy are found in Eusebius, Prep.Prep. Evang. VIII, 10, 1-17 and XIII, 12, 1-16. (18) Eusebius, Prep. Evang. VIII, 10, 1.

Judah had at that time not yet attained the prestige gained after his victory over Lysias and Nicanor, but was serving as the head of the Gerusia, as the council of elders was then called.23 Aristobulus, on the other hand, had evidently by then achieved the height of his position within the Egyptian Jewish com munity. Such a supposition would account for the fact that Judah's name appears at the end of the senders while that of Aristobulus is the first of the addressees, followed by two flattering epithets. The wording of the caption, therefore, tends to confirm the authenticity of the document. There remains the letter's salutation which, according to Bickerman, did not come into fashion until at least a century after the pretended date of the letter.24 But this argument is based on fragile evidence. The (82) Bunge, Untersuchungen, p. 67. Habicht, 2. Makkabàerbuch, p. 202, rejects this argu ment. (23) Habicht, 2. Makkabàerbuch, pp. 201-2, cites "gerusia" as the strongest evidence for the letter being a forgery. On the basis of II Macc. 11:27, he claims that the gerusia was at this time an instrument of the hellenizers and so Judas could not have been associated with it (see also p. 258). For a full discussion of the letters in II Macc. 11 see C. Habicht, "Royal Documents in Maccabees II," Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, v. 80 (1976), pp. 1-18. This assertion is based on one attestation and we do not know if the same body is being referred to in both references. The status of the gerusia following Judah's conquest of Jerusalem is uncertain. There may have been two gerusias at this time, with Judah as part of the traditional council of elders (זקנים). Pfeiffer, History, note 7 above, p. 509 suggests the authenticity of the letters in ch. 11 may be suspect. Goldstein, / Maccabees (p. 81) argues for their authenticity. Zambelli, Miscellanea, p. 246 (see note 7 above), suggests the official gerusia was not functioning in 164 b.c.e. Bunge, Untersuchungen, notes the reference in our letter is a shift in allegiance for this body, which is identified with the later Sanhédrin (pp. 65-6). (24) Bickermann, ZMW, v. 32, p. 234. His argument is based on the work of F.X.J. Exler, The The Form of the Ancient Greek Letter: A Study in Greek Epistolography (Catholic University, Washington, 1923), who limited his study to Egyptian papyri (p. 11). Exler found this formula, Xatp£1v K0ci ôyiaivetv to be very rare even after 60 b.c.e. (p. 64) and that it had occurred as early as the 4th century b.c.e. in Athens (p. 107 — this letter is printed in a number of collections — e.g. A. Deissmann, Licht vom Osten [Mohr, Tubingen, 1908], pp. 100-1). This formula also appears as part of the salutation in II Macc. 9:19— yaipsiv Kai ûytaiVEiv xai eC *rcpdcTTEiv . Finally, it should be noted that this discussion concerns a very particular formula and that greetings which include both of these words in other forms are to be found earlier than 60 b.c.e. (C.B. Welles, Royal Correspondence in the Hellenistic Period [Bretschneider, Rome, 1966], selections 56-60 date from 163-156 b.c.e). If the letter were a forgery, one would expect the forger to copy a common rather than an obscure form. Even if Bickermann's case could be proved on epistolographic grounds, the argument would not be decisive since a later scribe could quite easily alter a formula to resemble one more common in his own time. Bunge, Untersuchungen (pp. 43-6) also rejects the argument of Bickermann, however his references on p. 44, note 46 are to a different formula.</page><page sequence="8">96 BEN ZION WACHOLDER [8] formulas of salutation from the second century b.c.e. remain largely unknown and too few from Judea are available to use them as a basis for judging the letter's genuineness. Moreover Bickerman's dating of the letter in the Augustan age exceeds the papyrological evidence, since this formula never attained common usage in Egypt. Therefore, there is nothing in either the letter's salutation or address to cast doubt on the epistle's authenticity, and much to confirm it. 2.2.

This interpretation misconstrues the apparent intent of these lines. As neither here nor elsewhere in the letter is there any detail concerning the immense immense Judaean victory, these two passages seem to take it for granted that the Jews of Egypt had been previously informed about the exciting news. These lines emphasize the need to thank God for the salvation, serving as summary statements of the major theme of the letter. It is this theme which underlies the purpose for which the letter was written, the introduction of a new festival as a means of expressing thanks to God for the salvation accomplished in the recent events. In fact, all the verbs in these lines indicate that the purification of the temple had already taken place at the time of writing (actual or pre tended) of the letter: oeooopévoi "we have been saved" (1:11); ocàaocç "saved" (2:17); âÇéjJpccae "drove out" (1:12); ârto&amp;oùç "restored" (2:17). The last reference is of particular significance. It speaks of the inheritance (K^T)povop(a), kingship ( (îaoîXeiov ), priesthood (tepàrsupa) and consecration (dyiaopôç) as having been restored at the time of the letter's writing.28 Genuine or false, the document could not have been composed as if it were written prior to the reintroduction of the sacrificial rite, which took place on Kislev 25 of 148 s.e.29 Moreover, the apparent purpose of relating the restoration was to claim authority for the procla mation of a new festival. How could such a claim have been advanced before the installation of the new altar? The preceding discussion deals only with the actual or presumed dating of the document. But surely one could cite 2:18, which speaks of the hope for the ingathering of the dispersion, as proof of a post destruction date of the letter (after c.e. 70). In fact, the document contains other references to this hope. The prayer in 1:24-29 concludes with a reference to this messianic expectation. 2 Macc. 2:4-8 says that the Mosaic tabernacle and its sacred furnishings, which were hidden by Jeremiah in Moses' cave, will be restored to Jerusalem's temple at the time of the ingathering of the dispersion. By alluding to this messianic redemption, it may be argued, the pseudographer exposed himself as living two and a half centuries after the letter's pretended date. (28) For an interpretation of these references, see Grimm, Handbuch, p. 59; Keil, Commentar,Commentar,Commentar, pp. 301-2; Herkenne,Brie/e, pp. 99-103; Bunge, Untersuchungen, pp. 75-82. See also this paper, pp. 38-40. (29) Momigliano, Classical Philology, v. 70, p. 81, leaves open this possibility while Her kenne, Briefe, pp. 63-4, suggests this is the correct understanding.</page><page sequence="10">98 BEN ZION WACHOLDER [ΙΟ] The references in the letter to the ingathering of the Diaspora do not prove the lateness of the letter. There are documents which can unim peachably be dated prior to the destruction of the second temple, which contain expressions of messianic hope. 1 Macc. 4:36-46 relates that the dismantled altar which had been polluted, was placed in storage until a prophet would reveal what to do with the remaining stones. The scrolls found at Qumran contain numerous descriptions of the sanctuary, in contrast to the current temple, which the writers regard as ephemeral. 2 Macc. 2:17-18 evidently says that although the inheritance, kingship, priesthood, and the sacred place were returned, the ingathering of the dispersion was necessary to provide for the messianic restoration of the sanctuary.30 There is nothing necessarily anachronistic in the letter's messianic allusions, even if written in 164 b.c.e. 4.

I Macc. 4:46 and 14:41 contain references to a future prophet, however that must be to Elijah, the forerunner of the Messiah. In the pseudepigraphic writings as well as in the scrolls found at Qumran,Qumran, this future hope becomes focused more distinctly on the figure of a Messiah, a descendant of David, who will bring about the salvation of Israel. The rabbinic writings also contain abundant evidence for the anticipated hope of a golden age-to-come. For a discus sion of messianism in rabbinic literature, see E.E.

Verses 13-17 form an integral part of the letter, bridging the preced ing section of thanksgiving for God's salvation of Israel (1:11-12) and the proposed celebration of a festival of purification (1:18).31 The author again alludes to this in the summary. The prominence given to this passage indicates that the author composed it (or pretended to) shortly after this unexpected news reached Jerusalem. To a large extent, the argument advanced for the letter's inauthenticity rests on this account of Antiochus IV's death: a) it is anachronistic, and b) it is false. The letter suggests, according to the consensus, that Antiochus IV had died prior to the proclamation of the new feast, which was celebrated first on the 25th of Kislev of 148 s.e. (1 Macc. 4:52).32 This sequence of events appears to diverge from that found in 1 Maccabees, which places the death of the king after the celebration of the feast. What, however, seems to impeach the veracity of the letter is a recently discov ered cuneiform tablet which quotes a report that Antiochus died in the East during the month of Kislev of 148 s.e.33 It is clear that the author(s) of the letter, allegedly writing before Kislev 25 of that year, could not have received this news. It follows that the purported date of the letter is false. In addition to its anachronistic nature, the account of Antiochus IV's death in 2 Macc. 1:13-17 contradicts pagan reports. The king died, according to Polybius, from madness as he traveled in the East.34 The story of the assassination while looting a temple, moreover, fits well with (30 This link is emphasized by the presence of yàp in v. 13.

Such a treatment does not add to the letter's integrity. Neither the charge of anachronism nor the apparent inaccuracy of the report of Antiochus IV's death impeach in any way the credibility of the document. The account of Antiochus IV's death is anachronistic only if its author pretends to be writing prior to the rededication of the altar, i.e. before Kislev 25 of 148 s.e. This supposition rests on a mistaken exegesis of 2 Macc. 1:18a and 2:16, as will be shown in our discussion of segments 4 and 7. Contrary to the consensus, which supposes that the letter's internal date is before Kislev of 148 s.e.,36 its actual date appears to be sometime prior to the first anniversary of the temple's purification, probably in the summer or fall of 149 s.e. (163 b.c.e.). This dating appears to be borne out also in the passage which is under discussion. The report does not claim to relate the news of the king's death, evidently because this was already general knowledge. Neither does the letter say anything about the Judaean victories, apparently because this had been reported in a prior leter. What our letter does wish to impart to the Jews of Egypt is the need to thank God, and that part of this need for gratitude was the disgraceful manner of the king's death. Only the dating of the letter in 163 b.c.e. (149 s.e.) offers a probable explanation for the misinformation on Antiochus IV's mode of death, for the problem of the false report remains even if the letter is a fabrication. Why did the pseudographer, who otherwise seems to have made a major effort to create an impression of verisimilitude, manufacture an account of a monarch's death that differed from what was currently believed? It is generally assumed that the letter's fabricator simply ascribed the mode of assassination of Antiochus III the Great to his son. This, however, is only partly true. Both Antiochus III, according to Diodorus,37 and Antiochus IV, according to our letter, were murdered while attempting to loot an Eastern temple. But 2 Macc. 1:13-17 differs in many significant details from the pagan accounts of Antiochus Ill's demise. The former was (35) Diod. 28, 3; 29, 15; Justin 32, 2, 1-2; Jerome in Dan. 11,19 (FGrH 260, F32, 10; F47); Strabo 16, 1, 18. See also E.

Antiochus IV's alleged pretense to marry the goddess is original with the Maccabean letter. These differences indicate that the author(s) merely concocted a new version of a story while using the theme of Antiochus Ill's mode of death. A pseudographer, who attempted to sell his ware as genuine, would probably not have fabricated a story that contradicted common accounts. The report of Antiochus IV's death, therefore, remains prob lematical even if one supposes the letter to be inauthentic. The account of Antiochus IV's death appears less puzzling if it was written in 163 b.c.e., some months after the event had been announced in Jerusalem. A line in a cuneiform tablet of a Seleucid chronicle probably reproduces an accurate wording of the stunning announcement: "[Year 148], month Kislimu: it was heard that Kfing] Antiochus died."38 This Babylonian chronicle seems to reproduce the indefiniteness of the official account as to how and where the death took place. When this vague report came to Jerusalem, it must have aroused much speculation as to what exactly had happened. It may have been this vagueness which inspired the rumor that Antiochus IV met his fate in a manner similar to his father's, while looting a temple, but that the officials were ashamed to admit to this fact. 2 Macc. 1:13-16 appears to reproduce the details of such a rumor.39 The author of the letter need not have been aware of the unreliable nature of the rumor. In other words, the Jews of Jerusalem may have come to believe their own propaganda. The anecdote of An tiochustiochus IV's attempt to get hold of Nanaea's treasures by pretending to marry the goddess was pure fiction, but the letter's author(s) apparently believed this report as the true cause of the King's death. External evidence seems to lend support to the view that the version of Antiochus IV's death in 2 Macc. goes back to early Maccabean times. The author of 1 Macc. 6:1-4 fails to allude to the temple of Nanaea, giving instead Elymais. But the change from Nanaea to Elymais as the locus of the king's death appears to be an attempt to reconcile the old Jewish version of Antiochus IV's death with the pagan accounts of the death of Antiochus III. At any rate, it had become an accepted Jewish belief that Antiochus IV had met his deserved fate while attempting to loot a sane tuary, a tradition that evidently goes back to the vagueness of the early royal bulletin announcing the monarch's mysterious disappearance.

The implied date of these lines is crucial for the evaluation of the credibility of the document. (4ο) Zeitlin, Second Book, pp. 04 נ and 231. Others also note the difficulty involved in the use of this term rather than Βασιλεύς (B£venot, Makhabaerbiicher p. 172 and Habicht, 2.2. Makkabaerbuch,Makkabaerbuch, p. 202). (41) H.G.

The Hebrew formula is employed elsewhere with a specifically military meaning as is the term שר in other combinations (see Brown, Driver and Briggs, Hebrew Hebrew Lexicon, p. 978). Thus we find the LXX usage of the word often suggests a military leader or commander. Abel, Livres, (p. 290) suggests this is the meaning employed in this epistle (see also Bunge, Untersuchungen, p. 72). That Antiochus IV referred to himself as a military leader can be seen in the letter of II Macc. 9:19 where he refers to himself as Βασιλεύς και στρατηγός . (42) The meaning of the term in this context is to "commemorate." See the following discussion.</page><page sequence="15">[ 15] the letter from judah maccabee to aristobulus 103 Scholars have pointed out that the placement of verse 1:18, following the account of Antiochus' death, indicates that the proposal to celebrate the new feast occurred after that event. Yet, the scholars argue, the whole thrust of both 1:18a and 2:16 appears to indicate that the proposal took place prior to this stunning news in December of 148 s.e.43 If there is any question as to the new festival, it is often pointed out, it is to be found in 1 Macc. 4:52-61, where Kislev 25 of 148 s.e. is given as the time of the temple's purification. Furthermore 1 Macc. 6:1-16 is correct in dating the news of Antiochus' death after the proclamation of the festival. The report of the letter which reverses the sequence of these two events must be false. To be sure 2 Macc. 9, like our letter, mentions Antiochus IV's death before telling of Judah Maccabee's victorious entry into Jerusalem (2 Macc. 10:1-g), but the account of the king's agonizing death and his repentance for the sufferings of the Jews is certainly apocryphal. Is our letter's suggestion then also apocryphal? The conclusion appears inescap able. The author of our letter wrote long after the events had taken place and mixed up the sequence, something which a contemporary would presumably not have done. In defense of the document, the refutation of the charges against the possible authenticity of 1:18a and 2:16 rests on the term ôyetv» a crucial word in these two verses. In the LXX this term usually means to sanctify or dedicate, the equivalent of the Hebrew 44.הקדיש Both the RSV and the NEB render dryetv as "we are about to" or "we shall celebrate" the purification of the temple. Following the accepted septuagint usage of this word, a preferred translation would be "sanctify" or "dedicate" the purifi cation of the temple, in other words "sanctify the day of the purification of the temple."45 (43) F(1r the relevant literature, see notes 30 and 34 above. Goldstein / Maccabees, (pp. 273-82, 545) also argues against the authenticity of the letter on the basis of Daniel 7 which requires that the dedication and death of Antiochus take place in a sabbatical year, which was 164/3 according to his observations. I have dated that sabbatical year in 163/2, see B.Z. Wacholder, "The Calendar of Sabbatical Cycles during the Second Temple and the Early Rabbinic Period,"Ht/CA, v. 44 (1973), pp. 164, 187; reprinted in B.Z. Wacholder,Essays on Jewish Jewish Chronology and Chronography (KTAV, N.Y., 1976), pp. 12, 35. (44) Liddell, Scott and Jones, v. 1, p. 18, lists the meanings "hold, celebrate, keep, observe." In LXX see 1 Esdras 1:1, 17, 19-22; 5:51; 7:10, 14; Esther 9:14, 19-22; I Macc. 4:59; 7:48-9; 13:52; II Macc. 2:12; 6:7-8, 11; 10:8; 12:38; 15:3; III Macc. 6:36.

Lacquer, Untersuchungen,Untersuchungen, pp. 57 ff., and Goldstein, I Maccabees, pp. 545-6 argue the opposite. The Greek of this verse is elliptical and scholars have suggested various reconstructions. Grimm, Handbuch, pp. 42-3, discusses some of the alternatives. Hanhart, Septuaginta, p. 30, suggests</page><page sequence="16">104 BEN ZION WACHOLDER [16] According to the common understanding both the purification and its celebration lay still in the future (real or fictive), i.e. on the 25th of Kislev of 148 s.e. This understanding is surely fallacious. It is inconceivable that the letter's author(s) meant to say, as is now generally assumed, that we are waiting for the 25th of Kislev to purify the sanctuary, a date which we intend to celebrate. Such a construction would have implied that the writer(s) of this letter were satisfied to violate the Mosaic law by refraining from daily sacrifice until the 25th of Kislev. How could they have pre dieted that the purification of the sanctuary would be completed precisely on the assigned day of celebration?46 The term dyeiv here has the meaning of commemoration of the temple's purification which has already taken place. It follows that the planned dfyetv or commemoration of the purification on the 25th of Kislev, which is specifically mentioned in 1:18a and is alluded to in 2:16, could not be identical with the 25th of Kislev of 148 s.e., the day when the temple had been deemed purified. Other passages in the letter, namely 1:1 1:11-12 and 2:17, speak of the salvation as having occurred in the past. 2:18 concludes the epistle with the word "purified" (èKCcG&amp;pioev), leaving no doubt that the cleansing of the sanctuary from the idolatrous pollution was a thing of the past. 1:18a and 2:16 inform the Egyptian coreligionists that the Jews of Jerusalem intend to commemorate the purification of the temple by consecrating the 25th of Kislev as a new feast day. The earliest possible date, therefore, which is implied in 1:18a and 2:16 is not that day in 148 s.e., but a year later in 149 s.e. (163 b.c.e.). As these lines speak of the commemoration as an event that was still in the planning stage, the writing of the letter (in fact or fictive) clearly took place at the earliest in the summer or fall of 149 s.e. The mention of Judah Maccabee in 1:10a and 2:13-15 proves that the latest date implied in the letter is during the summer or fall of 151 s.e. (161 b.c.e ), prior to Judah's death thata0T0V be included as the direct object of &lt;5γειν, basing this on the Syriac text. P. Katz, "The Text of 2 Maccabees Reconsidered," ZNW, vol. 51 (i960), p. 12, suggests possible further additions. Bunge, Untersuchungen, p. 98, suggests the following reconstruction; however it is based on completing the sense of the phrase and is not intended to be a literal reconstruction of the original: tvo καΐ αύτοί δγητε (αύτόν)ώς|(τάς ήμέρας)|τής σκηνοπηγίας . Habicht, 2. Makkabaerbuch, ρ. 203, suggests that τάς ήμέρας can be added on the basis of parallel passages in 1:9, 2:16 and 9:6. Esther g: 17 and 22 could also be cited as parallel passages which support this addition. Doran "Studies" (see note 16 above), p. 23, also supports this reconstruction. Clearly my interpretation of this text is not hindered by these reconstructions and possibly strengthened. (46) Celebrations planned in advance regularly choose dates which are of historical or calendrical significance. See Exodus 40:1 and 17.</page><page sequence="17">[ 17] the letter from judah maccabee to aristobulus 105 early in 160 b.c.e.47 Moreover the account of Antiochus I V's death makes it unlikely that our document, if authentic, was composed later than 149 s.e. when rumors concerning the king's death must have been rampant. Thus whether the letter is a genuine or fabricated document, its implied date is summer or fall of 163 b.c.e. The apparent distinction to be found in our letter between the date of the purification of the temple and the consecration of that day in sub sequent years became obliterated in later standardized accounts of the origins of Hanukkah. The epitomist of Jason of Cyrene reports how Judah and his followers reconquered Jerusalem, tore down the idolatrous altar and built a new one, reinstituted the sacrificial rite, and proclaimed a new festival on the very day upon which two years earlier the temple had been profaned (2 Macc. 10:1-8). To explain the length of this new 8 day festival, the author mentions the feast of Booths, but he seems to be unaware of the real connection between the new feast and the pilgrimage feast. He seems to theorize that the link between the old and the new festival was the recollection of the victorious rebels concerning how they had been hunted down by their enemies during the preceding festival of Booths. They now celebrated by carrying palms and other symbols which are associated with that holiday (2 Macc. 10:7). It is clear that the epitomist linked the purification of the temple with the proclamation of the festival as a single event. The matter is somewhat different in the account of the new festival as reported in 1 Macc. 4:52-59. Unlike the telescoped account of 2 Macc. 10:1-9, the author of 1 Maccabees provides some details concerning the events preceding and following the recovery of the holy city by the pious. But even here the time of the proclamation of the new festival remains unresolved. The report begins with a summary of the events preceding the reintroduction of the sacrificial rite on the 25th of Kislev of 148 s.e. 1 Macc. 4:47-51 relates how Judah and his followers entered the holy city, purified the temple and dismantled the profaned altar, replacing it with a new one which conformed to the requirements of the law. This report makes no mention of any preparations for the introduction of a new festival, as suggested by the letter in 2 Macc. 1:18a and 2:16. Thus it seems surprising that 1 Macc. 4:52-60 does describe the rededication of the temple as if it were part of the proclamation of a new festival:48 (47) E.

This passage, which forms the basis for the setting of the pretended or actual time of 2 Macc 1:18a and 2:16, apparently dates the announcement</page><page sequence="19">[ 19] THE LETTER FROM JUDAH MACCABEE TO ARISTOBULUS X 07 of the new festival as part of the rededication ceremonies on Kislev 25 of 148 s.E. A closer reading, however, does not necessarily support such an interpretation. It should be noted that even if the text actually supports such a reading, its historicity would be questionable. It would be most unusual to proclaim a festival prior to the actual event of victory in the midst of a war or revolution. The account of the proclamation of the feast of Purim, which was set up to commemorate the enemy's debacle, is typical of such national celebrations.49 It is improbable that the rebels, busy with the cleaning of the sanctuary and fearful of the powerful forces of the king, had either the time or inclination to make the elaborate preparations for the celebrations mentioned in our passage. Upon closer reading, this passage suggests that only the restitution of the sacrifical rite which is described in 4:52-53 took place on Kislev 25 of 148 s.E. What follows thereafter (4:54-60) appears to reflect a combination of historical insight and a telescoping of the institution of Hanukkah as a Hasmonean festival. "At the very season and on the very day" (4:54) is probably a note on the date of the 25th of Kislev (4:52).50 Verses 54-58 give the mode of celebration which became customary during the succeeding years.51 The credit attributed in this decree to the brothers of Judah, who are not mentioned in other accounts of the dedication, would lend support to the supposition that we find here presented the official version of the festival of Hanukkah current in the writer's own day, apparently during the last days of the second century b.c.e. This account, which describes the origin and early development of the festival of Hanukkah up to the days of John Hyrcanus ( 135-104 b.c.e.), does not either confirm or deny the statements in the letter that a festival commemorating the purification of the temple was instituted sometime in 163 b.c.e. It would seem that the author of the letter in 2 Macc. 1:18 and 2:16 shows an unawareness of the institution of Hanukkah as it is depicted in 1 Macc. 4:52-60. The anonymous author of 1 Macc. describes a fully devel oped feast, with sacrifices of thanksgiving, recitations of psalms and musical instruments. Although he knows of the significance of the tem pie's purification (4:43) the writer calls it the festival of Dedication or Rededication (èyKaiviopôç), a name that was evidently introduced by the Hasmonean rulers. The author(s) of the letter, however, knows the new festival by the primitive name of Purification (KaSapiopôç) of the (49) Esther 9:16-32. (50) Compare with Esther g:22 where a similar echo "in those days" is to be found. (51) Esther g:27 (see also w. 20 ff.). Here it is clear that Purim is a festival proclaimed after the initial event of celebration.</page><page sequence="20">108108 BEN ZION WACHOLDER [20] Temple (2 Macc. 1:18a; 2:16). For Judah and his contemporaries, the achievement of the pious Jews was not, as is stated in 1 Macc. 4:59, the dedication of the new altar but the cleansing of the sanctuary from pagan worship, which necessitated the placing of the old altar in the genizah and replacing it with a new structure. The nomenclature of the new festival in the letter (1:18a; 2:16) as compared to that of the Maccabean historian (1 Macc. 4:59) indicates that 2 Macc. 1:10b-2:18 antedates the account found in 1 Macc. 4:52-59. The relative antiquity of our letter also becomes evident in a compari son of the new festival's nomenclature as it appears in 2 Macc. 1:18a and 2:16 with that used in the so-called first letter, specifically in 2 Macc. 1:8-9.52 The first letter, dated in 188 s.e. (124 b.c.e.), recalls that in 169 s.e. (143 b.c.e.) the Jews of Jerusalem had written to inform their Egyptian coreligionists of the kindling of lamps and the setting-out of loaves to celebrate the feast (2 Macc. 1:8). The reference to the message of 169 s.e. makes sense if it is supposed that at that time the placing of the loaves was introduced as part of the new festival. In Josephus' time, the festival was known as Lights (A.J. 12:325). 2 Macc. 1:18 and 2:16 however, when describing the new festival, appear to have no inkling of the lighting of lamps or the setting out of loaves on the feast which has become known as Hanukkah, evidently because the second letter (2 Macc. 1:10a-2:18) antedates not only the first letter (2 Macc. 1:1-10a) but also the one written in 169 s.e. Both the letter dated in 188 s.e. and the letter allegedly written in 149 s.e. assert that the new feast was known as Booths. However the respective formulations of this name clearly suggest that 2 Macc. 1:18 and 2:16 antedate 1:8. In 2 Macc. 1:18 the author of the letter calls the new festival Booths apparently because he desires to explain or to account for its unusual length of 8 days. Moreover he does not seem satisfied that he has presented an adequate justification, so he inserts another name, the festival of fire. The writer in 124 b.c.e., however, needs no such explana tion. He uses the name Festival of Booths of Kislev as if it was the accepted designation. It follows that 2 Macc. 1:18 was written before 1:9. 5a.

A number of statements are unhistorical: Verse 1:19 asserts that the Jews had been exiled to Persia, in fact to Babylonia; it was not Nehemiah who rebuilt the temple but Zerubbabel. Scholars have frequently noted that the digression's main point is stated by implication only—when the first burnt offering was placed on the newly constructed altar on Kislev 25 of 148 se., a heavenly fire consumed it.54 Paradoxically, the writer seems (53) See note 45 above tor the difficulties of v. 18.

What needs to be determined for the purpose of this paper is whether this section makes better sense under the supposition that the document is a pseudograph rather than an authentic message or vice versa. What conceivable purpose did the author(s) of this letter mean to serve by inserting into an epistle whose main aim was to urge the observance of a new festival a digression concerning a historical discussion of the heavenly fire? Specifically, the passage consists of three points: a) Nehemiah recov ered fire that had been hidden by preexilic priests, fire from the temple, which had come down from heaven in the days of Moses and Solomon (1:19-23, 36; 2:9-12); b) the prayer of Nehemiah and Jonathan (1:24-32) and c) verification of the facts by the king of Persia (1:33-35). How do these points advance the aim of the author(s)? Before treating the question of this long digression on the history of the heavenly fire we need to consider another problem. 2 Macc. 1:18b at tempts to justify the observance of an 8-day festival on the basis of the two existing models of Sukkoth and Fire. The pilgrimage festival of Booths needs no elaboration, but what is the evidence with regard to the existence of a feast of Fire? Some scholars explain the reference to fire as the kindling of lights which became a feature of Hanukkah.55 The NEB removes the problem with the paraphrase, "so that you also for your part may celebrate a Feast of Tabernacles, in honor of the fire which appeared when Nehemiah offered sacrifices."56 These solutions do not clarify this puzzling reference.57 the middle of v. 18. Habicht, 2. Makkabaerbuch, p. 203, similarly understands the digression to be the discussion of a totally different festival. (55) Starcky and Abel, Livres, p. 28; Oxford Annotated Apocrypha (RSV), p. 264; NEB Oxford Oxford Study Edition (1976), p. 234; Goldstein, I Maccabees, p. 546. Zeitlin, Second Book, pp. 40-3, suggests this refers to בית השואבה which is mentioned in Mishnah Sukkah 5:1-3. Abel, Livres,Livres, p. 292, makes a similar suggestion. This seems highly unlikely. See the following discussion. (56) Bartlett, Books, p. 226, reproduces this reading. Bévenot, Makkabaerbûcher, p. 173, Bunge, Untersuchungen, pp. 48-51, 98-105 and Habicht, 2. Makkabaerbuch, p. 202, suggest a similar interpretation. Bunge, Untersuchungen, bases the reconstruction K0d (itepi) T0C Ttupôç on the Syriac translation. As seen in the above translation, all these interpretations follow follow only if a comma or period is placed after OKqv01tr|yia(; Then Kcd toG Ttupôç begins a new thought and emendations must be added to complete the sentence. Keil, Commentar,Commentar, p. 289, and Herkenne, Briefe, p. 69, note the parallelism of the two genitives and are then unwilling to accept any reconstruction or translation which does not account for this fact. (57) Doran, "Studies" (see note 16 above), p. 23, suggests no work up to the present time has adequately explained the reference to fire.</page><page sequence="25">[25] THE LETTER FROM JUDAH MACCABEE TO ARISTOBULUS 113 Evidence for the existence of such a festival during this period is found in Megillat Tacanit, a pre-mishnaic Aramaic treatise, dating back to the pre-destruction period, which states:58 מן ריש ירחא דניסן ועד תמניא ביה אתוקם תמידא די לא למספד בהון: "From the first to the eighth of Nisan not to fast, for the burnt offering was instituted." Ancient and modern scholars have wondered what precisely this pas sage means. The old rabbinic scholion which identifies the occasion of this feast with a victory of the Pharisees over their Sadducean opponents in matters of sacrificial financing may present here a supplementary rather than a primary reason.59 Some modern scholars tend to assume that this feast celebrates the establishment of the Mosaic tabernacle in the desert.60 This seems unlikely however, since none of the other entries in this Aramaic text mention a feast that relates to Pentateuchal history. The establishment of the daily burnt offering of Megillat Tacanit, therefore, must refer not to the original founding of the sacrificial rite by Moses on Nisan 1 of the second year after the Exodus (Exodus 40:17), but to its reestablishment by the returning exiles after the Babylonian captivity. The post-exilic altar was completed on Adar 23 ( 1 Esdras 7:5) in the sixth year of Darius (516 b.c.e ). But the inauguration of the new altar, accord ing to traditional chronology, did not take place until seven days later, after the priests had sufficient training, on Nisan 1 of the same year. After the completion of the tabernacle, we find recorded in Numbers 7 various dedicatory ceremonies in which the tribal leaders participated. It seems reasonable that the returning exiles, having rebuilt the temple, would have engaged in similar festivities. Megillat Tacanit seems to attest to these celebrations which took place on Nisan 1-8.61 The statement in 2 Macc. 1:18b that the feast of fire dated back to the (58) Hans Lichtenstein, "Die Fastenrolle: eine Untersuchung zur jiidisch hellenistischen Geschichte," HXJCA, v. 8-9 (1931-2), p. 318; S. Zeitlin, Megillat Taanit as a Source for Source for Jewish Chronology and History in the Hellenistic and Roman Periods (Dropsie College, Philadelphia, 1922), p. 65. I have here followed the Zeitlin reading. (59) Lichtenstein, ibid., pp. 290, 323-4; Zeitlin, ibid., p. 72. Yigal Yadin, in his comments on the temple scroll found at Qumran (The Temple Scroll, Jerusalem, 1977, v. 1, p. 110), argues that this semi-festival (see below) was established by the Pharisees to counter the sectarian view that during the first 7 days of Nisan, the tamid offerings were not brought. The temple scroll, column 14, line 11, however seems to contradict this view since it prescribes for the first day of Nisan the tamid as well as the inauguratory offerings. (60) Lichtenstein, ibid., p. 292; Gustaf Dalman, Aramàische Diakktproben (2nd edn., Hinrichs'sche, Leipzig, 1927), p. 41; J. Wellhausen, Die Pharisaer und die Sadducder (Bam berg, Greifswald, 1874), p. 59; R. Leszynsky, Die Sadduzaer, (Berlin, 1912), p. 67.

This anach ronistic mention of Nehemiah, however, is a characteristic of Jewish historiography in general, beginning with Daniel and ending with Seder Olam and the entire talmudic tradition.63 1 Esdras 5:40 in fact names Nehemiah as one of Zerubbabel's associates. The important point here is that the feast of fire mentioned in 2 Macc. 1:18b is not something that was invented by a pseudographer, although a pseudographer might have used it. Indeed the author of the letter needed the feast of fire to justify the eight-day length of the proposed feast, since the festival of Booths also used by the writer did not seem a compelling reason. Why necessarily use the model of Booths whose total length is eight days and not Passover that lasts only seven days? Another possible reason for using this additional precedent may be that the festival of Booths is a feast recorded in the Torah and perhaps could not be duplicated by post-Mosaic authorities. The eight-day feast of fire, however, seemed a perfect model in that it originated in a later time-period and was related to the reinauguration of the daily burnt offerings. Furthermore, there may be a technical aspect to the linking of the newly-proposed festival with Nisan 1-8. In Judaism, there exists a qualitative difference between a Mosaic festival, which prescribes total rest from labor, and the observance of a semi-festival, when only fasting is prohibited. The author of the letter may be stressing two points: a) that this is another feast commemorating the re establishment of the daily sacrificial cult, and b) that it need not be (62) There is some biblical evidence for this festival. In Ezra 6:15, we read that the house of the Lord was finished on the 3rd of Adar. This should read the 23rd as in 1 st Esdras 7:5, which is only 8 days away from the 1st of Nisan. In Exodus 40:17, the tabernacle is inaugurated on the 1st day of the 1st month (Nisan). In Leviticus 8:33-9:1, we read of the ordination procedure which reaches its completion on the 8th day, which should also be on the 1st of Nisan, according to Exodus 40:11-14. Evidence for the existence of this festival is also found in Seder Olam, ch. 7: Sifra 42d-43c (Weiss); temple scroll (see note 59 above). (63) Seder Olam 30; Baba Batra 15a; Sanhédrin 103b. In Sanhédrin 38a and 93b he is identified with Zerubbabel. The rabbinic view reflects a reading of Daniel whose span embraces both Nebuchadnezzar and the Persian Kings. The Book of Ezra, which tradi tionally also embraced Nehemiah and whose authorship was attributed to Ezra, was read by the ancients as if the author as well as Nehemiah witnessed the rebuilding of the temple in the days of Zerubbabel. Note a similar error in 2 Macc. 1:19 where the Persians are said to have led "our fathers" into exile.</page><page sequence="27">[27] the LETTER FfeOM JUDAH MACCABEE TO ARISTOBULUS 115 observed like the pilgrimage feast of booths, but as a semi-feast.84 The evidence that a feast of fire existed does not necessarily prove the historic ity of the document but it does refute the argument that this reference is to a fictive feast.65 The author of the letter was not satisfied with a mere allusion to that feast, but goes on to present legendary episodes of the appearance of the fire in the past. What may have been the motives of Judah and his colleagues if the letter is genuine, or of its manufacturer if a pseudograph, for dealing with such matters at great length? A strong case has been made that this digression represents an independent composition which in the course of time became attached to the document.66 This seems unlikely, however. The word for word repetition in 2 Macc. 2:16 of the call for the new festival in 1:18a clearly demonstrates the epistolographer's (aware ness of his) departure from the subject. Having completed the digression, the epistolographer is resuming his main subject. Presumably, if the excursus belongs to a writer other than Judah Maccabee and his aides, the entire letter does also. Now if it is pseudographic, it is difficult to conceive a reason for the insertion of an extraneous section. Such a hypothesis requires an accounting for the presence of a lengthy section most of which, if not all, seems superfluous to the epistle's crucial message. In fact, it is difficult to explain this section as long as the identity of the supposed fabricator remains unknown. The case is different however, if the docu ment is authentic. Two considerations tend to favor an early date for the account of the appearance of the heavenly fire in post-exilic times (2 Macc. 1:19-36). The first is the doctrine which maintained that the fire on the altar of the burnt offerings could use only fuel that had its origin in a heavenly source, i.e., fire taken from any other source made the sacrifice profane.67 Lev. 6:6 prescribes that "a perpetual fire (אש תמיד) must always burn on the altar." The divine fire appeared, according to Lev. 9:24, in the midst of public shouts. Lev. 10:1-2 relates that the two oldest sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, died because, contrary to orders, they introduced profane fire to kindle the altar that was to be used in the inauguration of the sacrificial (64) In Megillat Tacanit, both the festival of Nisan 1-8 (1a) and Hanukkah on the 25th of Kislev (gd) are listed in the same class, namely it is forbidden to mourn on both of them. (65) It also refutes the argument that του πυρός is a reference to Hanukkah, as well as dealing with the argument of Zeitlin (see note 55 above). (66) Grimm, Handbuch, pp. 24-5; B£venot, Makkabaerbiicher, p. 170; Bunge, Unter suchungen,suchungen, pp. 114-128; Habicht, 2. Makhabaerbuch, p. 200. Starcky and Abel, Livres, p. 27, admit the epistolographer had a source before him, but that he is responsible for the final form in which we find w. 19-36. (67) Leviticus 10:1; Num. 3:4; 26:61.</page><page sequence="28">116 BEN ZION WACHOLDER [28] rite.68 The author of 1 Kings, however, in his account of the Solomonic temple ignored the issue of heavenly fire in the new sanctuary. Not so the Chronicler who describes how, when Solomon finished his prayer and the entire people assembled, the heavenly fire descended and consumed the newly placed offerings (2 Chron. 7:1). What Leviticus ascribes to the Tabernacle and 2 Chron. 7 to the First Temple, 2 Macc. 1:19-36 does for the Second. In post-Maccabean or even in late Maccabean historiography this issue seems sometimes to be ignored again. 1 Macc. 4:36-61 tells that the victors who purified the temple felt the need to build a new altar of burnt offerings, but makes no mention of the source of the fire used to kindle the new altar. 2 Macc. 10:3 asserts that after construction of the new altar, it became necessary to manufacture fire. This author, in con trast to our letter, shows no conern about the employment of profane fire in the temple, thus diverging from the older priestly tradition which required a perpetual heavenly fire in the temple.69 Even the rabbinic tradition70 seems to have been concerned only with the purity of the oil rather than with the sanctity of the fire itself.71 However 2 Macc. 13:8 does seem to reflect the older concern for the sanctity of the fuel employed for sacrificial purposes. In commenting on the death of Menelaus, the author explains his death as retribution for his desecration of the altar "whose fire and ashes were holy." This passage reflects the older view that the focal point of the temple's sanctity lay in the divine fire. Another significant consideration may account for the need felt by the author of the document to incorporate in a letter whose main message was the inauguration of a new festival the legend of the heavenly fire. The people of Judea addressed the letter to Aritobulus, who is called "teacher of King Ptolemy" (2 Macc. 1:10b).72 As was stated above, the letter's heading suggests that Judah felt it crucial to persuade Aristobulus, the leader of Egypt's Jewry, to back him and his rebels who had recently (68) Seder Olam 7. This occurred on Nisan 1 in the second year after the Exodus, according to the rabbis. (69) The lack of fire in the second temple, according to Yoma 21 b, reflects its inferiority compared to the first. The tradition lists other points of inadequacy, with Zerubbabel's temple missing such items as the ark, Shekinah, Holy Spirit, Urim and Thummim, anointing oil, tabernacle and its furnishings, Moses' rod, Aaron's rod, manna and the box which the Philistines used to return the ark (Goldstein, I Maccabees, p. 547, n. 1). The inferiority of the second temple is not peculiar to these passages. The entire rabbinic tradition differs with the spirit of our letter. Unlike our epistle, the author of the temple scroll, and to a lesser extent the rabbis, did not fully recognize the second temple. (70) See B.Z.

The account of the presence of the heavenly fire in the temple of Jerusalem may have been designed to please Aristobulus, for the fragments of Aristobulus reveal that he had a passionate interest in the descent of the heavenly fire to the earth. In fact, Aristobulus says he attempted to convince Ptolemy VI Philometor that such a phenomenon had occurred at Sinai. According to the fragments that are preserved in Eusebius' Preparatio Evangelica Aris tobulus was one of the first, if not the first, of the biblical exegetes to explain anthropomorphic phrases such as "the hand of God" as mere figures of speech which did not affect the strictly spiritual and non corporeal nature of the deity.73 An exception to this non anthropomorphic exegesis of Scripture was Aristobulus' exposition of the divine fire at Mount Sinai as suggested by the following excerpt74 (Book 8, 10, 12-17): . λέγεται δέ καΐ κατάβασις έπΐ It is said too in the book of the Law τό δρος θεία γεγονέναι διά της that there was a descent of God upon γραφής του νόμου, καθ* δν the mountain, at the time when He ένομοθέτειένομοθέτει καιρόν, Ινα ·πάντες was giving the Law, in order that all θεωρήσωσι τήν ένέργειαν του might behold the operation of God: θεοΰ. κατάβασις γάρ αδτη for this is a manifest descent; and so σαφής έστι־ καΐ περί τούτων any one wishing to guard safely the οδν οΰτως δν τις έξηγήσαιτο, doctrine of God would interpret these βουλόμενος συντηρεΐν τόν περί circumstances as follows, θεου λόγον. δηλοΟται γάρ ώς 11 is dedared that the mountain τό δρος έκαίετο πυρί*, καθώς burned with fire, as the Lawgiver says, φησινφησιν ή νομοθεσία, διά τό τόν because God had descended uPon il' θεόν καταβεβηκέναι σαλπίγγων and that there were the voices of י י λ - l trumpets, and the fire blazing so that τε φωνας καΐ τό πυρ φλεγόμενον ' 6 ,, , . ~ י none could withstand it. άνυποστάτως είναι, του γάρ , , , , . , . . .. , For while the whole multitude, not παντός πλήθους μυριάδων ουκ , , . „ less than a thousand thousands, έλαττον έκατόν, χωρίς των , ., , _ __ , " . besides those of unfit age, were άφηλίκων, έκκλησιαζομένων ,. , , , . .

Thus Aristobulus maintained that the heavenly fire did in fact appear at Mount Sinai. The fact that the correspondents of Judaea addressed him as teacher of the king (2 Macc. 1: tob) and they offered to send books if so requested (2 Macc. 2:15) suggests that Judah and his secretaries were quite well acquainted with Aristobulus' exegetical work. In light of Aris tobulus'tobulus' interest in the subject, the lengthy account of the descent of the heavenly fire in the past and present in Second Maccabees (1:18b-2:12) no longer seems out of place. To be sure, Aristobulus speaks of the divine fire which had descended at the time of the giving of the Decalogue</page><page sequence="31">[31 ] THE LETTER FROM JUDAH MACCABEE TO ARISTOBULUS 11Q whereas the letter relates the presence of heavenly fire at the inauguration of the sacrificial rite. One may suppose however, that Aristobulus may have touched on this descent of fire at the altar since it is also clearly recorded in the Pentateuch. Even supposing he had not, the author(s) of the letter may not have differentiated between the divine fire which had appeared at the time when God revealed the Decalogue and the fire when the sacrificial ritual was inaugurated. Interestingly, Aristobulus' description of the descent of the heavenly fire may also illumine that passage of the letter which insists that the contemporary king of Persia verified the miraculous production of fire out of the thick liquid remaining from the matter hidden by the priests going into exile (2 Macc. 1:33-35). Perhaps it is not insignificant that the description of the heavenly fire in Aristobulus' fragment is addressed to Ptolemy whom the Jewish writer attempts to convince of the veracity of the account. Judah and his colleagues appear to be making the strongest possible case under the circumstances for the legend that the fire on the altar of burnt offering had originated in heaven. The claim of verification by a pagan king ends with an allegation that Nehemiah and his compan ions became beneficiaries of the Persian ruler (1:35). This again may have been to draw a parallel between Aristobulus and the post-exilic leaders in that both succeeded in spreading the glory of the Lord among heathen kings. Students of our epistle have heretofore devoted their exclusive atten tiontion to the senders of the letter — the people of Jerusalem and Judaea, the Gerusia, and Judah (Maccabee). They have endrely ignored the letter's addressees — Aristobulus and the Jews of Egypt (1:10b). The scholars who have studied Aristobulus' fragments have concentrated on the let ter's heading (1:10b) without ever raising the question of the apparent relationship between Aristobulus' passionate interest in the descent of the divine fire and the letter's digression into a similar subject.75 However if a similarity does in fact exist, it would account for the presence of a lengthy section in the document (2 Macc. 1:19-2:12) for which no explanation has so far been put forward. More significantly for this study, this explanation of the interest of Aristobulus and the authors of the letter offers evidence for the authenticity of the epistle as a whole. It seems inconceivable to suppose that a pseudographer, writing long after Judah Maccabee and Aristobulus, would have inserted apparently irrelevant passages relating to the descent of sacred fire into a message devoted to the meaning of the festival of Hanukkah. Only people who had previously corresponded (75) Neither Valckenaer, Diatribe, nor Walter, Thoraausleger, mentions this relationship.</page><page sequence="32">120 BEN ZION WACHOLDER [32] with the leader of Egyptian Jewry, as Judah or his secretaries had, could have been aware of such information. Paradoxically, the legendary mate rial used to convince Aristobulus had a degree of historical veracity similar to the veracity of the verses glorifying the Sabbath which Aristobulus attributed to the classical poets such as Homer and Hesiod.76 3b.

Subdivision 5b presents a supplement to the account of Nehemiah's discovery of the remnants of the fire from the first temple, which 2 Macc. 1:19 says had been hidden by pious priests prior to their deportation. Now 2:1 reveals the identity of the concealers—Jeremiah and his assistants. Why the author(s) of this letter chose at first to attribute the saving of the sacred fire to anonymous priests remains problematical. Having di gressed from the subject by mentioning the activity of Jeremiah, the writer could not restrain himself from reporting another activity by the same prophet—Jeremiah's hiding of the Mosaic tent and ark (5c). Both 5b and 5c are distinguished from the main digression by being cited on the authority of written records (2:1; 2:4).78 In fact the document cites no (77) See note 62 above. In Exodus 40:34 ff., Yahweh reveals himself in the manner mentioned in this verse, immediately after the inauguration of the altar. (78) There has been continual debate about the άπογραφή cited in 2:1 and the γραφή of γραφή of 2:4, Grimm ,Handbuch, pp. 50-1, Herkenne, Briefe, pp. 85-6, and Abel, Limes, p. 303 find the use οίάτίογραφήίη v. 1 highly unusual since the apparent sense of the passage is best understood with άναγραφή (v. 13). Keil, Commentar, p. 295, claims the words are similar enough in meaning that either could be utilized in this verse. Grimm, Handbuch, p. 51, rejects an earlier suggestion that the dntOYpai^must refer to the lost canonical writings of this prophet and instead suggests they were pseudepigraphic. However he does suggest that γραφή must be intended to refer to Holy Scripture (p. 23). The source of these verses is more problematical than the wording. Corbishley, Catholic Comm., p. 718, McEleney,Jerome Biblical Biblical Comm., p. 481 and Bunge, Untersuchungen, pp. 105-15 all look to the "memoirs of Nehemiah" of 2:13 for the source of this section as well as for 1:18-36. This possibility is denied by Keil, Commentar, p. 295, and serves only as a suggestion for Bevenot, Makkabaer biicher,biicher, p. 177. Starcky and Abel, Livres, pp. 29-30, say the source is another apocryphal writing while Zeitlin, Second Book, pp. 110-1, claims a document which included the legend was probably also used by the author of Josippon.</page><page sequence="34">122 BEN ZION WACHOLDER [34] support for its startling revelations except for the activities of Jeremiah. This special emphasis on extra-biblical sources which are not named was apparently intended to impress the correspondents. If the identity of these sources could be unraveled, it may serve as an independent indica tion of the date of the document. Several passages in 5c (2 Macc. 2:4-8) suggest the writing (γραφή) cited in 2:4 refers to the work by the Judaeo-Greek historian Eupolemus.79 Eupolemus served as Judah Maccabee's envoy to Rome in 161 b.c.e. (1 Macc. 8:17). He wrote a history of the Jews, of which extensive fragments following the style of the Book of Chronicles remain extant.80 As was noted above the author of the letter (2 Macc. 2:10-12) stresses the miraculous appearance of the heavenly fire at the time of the inaugura tion of the first temple, a view found in 2 Chron. 7:1, but not mentioned in the parallel account of 1 Kings 8:54. The view expressed in 2 Macc. 2:8 that Solomon made special provisions for the housing of the Mosaic tabernacle is mentioned in both Kings and Chronicles. Eupolemus also emphasizes the transport of the desert furnishings into the Solomonic temple. This section of the letter contains several passages that seem to be remarkably similar to those of Eupolemus: 1. 2 Macc. 2:4-8 of the letter bears a strong resemblance to a passage of Fragment 2 of Eupolemus which follows the Judaeo-Greek wirter's account of Solomon's construction of the temple:81 (12) συντελέσαντα δέ τό (ερόν Eusebius, Praep.

Both Eupolemus, who refers to Solomon's action, and 2 Macc. 2:4-8, alluding to that of Solomon and Jeremiah, stress that by an oracular command the tabernacle and its furnishings were safeguarded for post erity. Both accounts contain two lists of sacred items, which are worth comparing: 22 Macc. 2 Praep. Evang. IX, 34 4) tabernacle (σκηνή) 12) tabernacle (σκηνή) ark (κιβωτός) altar (θυσιαστή ptov) vessels (σκεύη) 5) tabernacle (σκηνή) 13) ark (κιβωτός) ark (κιβωτός) altar of gold (βωμός ό χρυσός) altar of incense (θυσιαστήριον lampstand (λυχνία) του του table (τράπεζα) θυμιάματος)θυμιάματος)θυμιάματος) other vessels (άλλα σκεύη) The lists of sacred items in the two accounts are not quite identical but they are similar and are recorded in a corresponding fashion, leading to the presumption that there existed a relationship between them. Particu larly striking is that both Eupolemus and the letter contain two separate listings. The two sources have these items in common: tabernacle, ark, and altar (of incense, Macc; of gold, Eup.). 2. Eupolemus relates that Nebuchadnezzar, heeding the predictions of Jeremiah, conquered Jerusalem and carried all of the precious metals to Babylon — "except the ark and the tablets; these Jeremiah retained."82 Eupolemus and 2 Macc. 2:4-8 are the only ancient sources which record Jeremiah's retention of the furnishings of the Mosaic tabernacle. To be sure, the Mishnaic tradition also mentions a view that the Mosaic ark was hidden prior to the destruction of the Solomonic temple, but this source does not link the hiding with Jeremiah.83 The Vita of Jeremiah does connect the hiding of the ark with the activity of this prophet, but like the rabbinic tradition, emanates from a post-Christian period.84 Taken together 1. and 2. seem to be sufficiently striking to establish a (82) FGrH 723 F5 (Eusebius, Prep.

Of course there always exists the possibility that both the author of the letter and Eupolemus were dependent on a lost source, but there is nothing to substantiate such a hypothesis. The ques tion that remains is whether the Maccabean letter or Eupolemus ought to be regarded as the original source. Two reasons lead to the conclusion that the author(s) of the letter was (were) probably citing the writings of Eupolemus: the fact that Eupolemus' work, fragments of which are ex tant, dealt at length with the history of Solomon and Jeremiah, and the fact that 2 Macc. 2:4 cites as its authority a y poc&lt;f&gt;q. Now the letter's dependence on Eupolemus does not necessarily refute the possibility that the entire document is a fabrication. Someone writing a century or so after the pretended date of the epistle might have made use of Eupolemus' history. But the question of what possible motive inspired the epistolographer to include such episodes in a document can find an answer only if we suppose that it was composed at the time when Eupolemus had just completed his own work. The letter imparts the good news that the Mosaic tabernacle remains hidden and will once again be revealed when God will gather the dispersion of Israel. A fabricator writing long after the seemingly miraculous deliverance of Judaea would have had no such motivation for the incorporation of such material in a message devoted to the origin of Hanukkah. In fact, the apparent interdependence between the fragments of' Eupolemus' history and an otherwise abstruse part of the letter strongly suggests the possibility that Eupolemus himself was one of the assistants to the Gerusia who had composed the document.85 Eupolemus' father John had negotiated the agreement between Jerusalem and Antiochus the Great, who conquered Coele-Syria in 198 bc.e.,86 and Eupolemus himself served as Judah Maccabee's secretary in 161 b.c.e.87 Since Aristobulus was the senior of the addressees, it is not mere idle speculation that he was highly esteemed on account of his authorship (2 Macc. 1:10b). It is a fair supposition that Judah and the Gerusia had entrusted to a fellow writer the composition of an important document to be sent to Aristobulus. These determinations are based on the assumption that it is a genuine document. If it is not, the enigmatic aspects of the entire digression remain as puzzling as ever. Thus we can find the document's sitz-im-leben only if it was a real letter. (85) Wacholder, Eupolemus, pp. 39-40, 237-42. (86) 2 Macc. 4:11; Josephus, Ant. 12:138-153.

"ών οδν έάν χρείαν έχητε, τούς άποκομιοϋντας ύμΐν άποστέλλετε. In this section the letter comes back to business at hand, but the matter presented is quite surprising. It appears to be an attempt to raise the stature of Judah who, although mentioned in the letter's heading (1:10b), is named last. Judah is likened to Nehemiah, who seems to be credited with the canonization of Scripture.89 The fact that Judah's book collecting is used to raise the prestige of the Judaean leader appears to harmonize with the impression from 2 Macc. 1:18b.90 The secretary who had actually composed the document, perhaps Eupolemus, seems to suggest to Aris tobulus that the new Judaean leader, Judah Maccabee, although not a writer himself, was also a bibliophile. It is difficult to conceive a reason why a pseudographer would have been interested in ascribing to Judah an activity that had no apparent, direct connection with the purported aim of the letter. The letter's internal date, suggested by 2:14, is at the earliest 163 b.c.e. and at the latest 160 b.c.e. For on the one hand, the phrase "because of the (88) Zeitlin, Second Book, pp. 113-4, translates this verse in a different manner: "Judah also collected for us all the reports and rumors that had been spread abroad due to the outbreak of the war. We still have them." (89) See Leiman, Canonization (note 5 above), who argues that this passage is a reference to the closing of the hagiographa. Tradition ascribes this activity as well as the reinaugura tion of the altar to Ezra. Here Judah is compared to Nehemiah in both these activities rather than to Ezra. For a discussion of Nehemiah, see p. 26 above. (90) This must have been intended to impress Aristobulus, who apparently engaged in extensive literary activity. See above pp. 5-6, 28-32.</page><page sequence="38">126 BEN ZION WACHOLDER [38] recent war" (2:14)91 indicates that the collecting of the books took place soon after the war and that at least sufficient time had elapsed since the end of the conflict for Judah to have successfully collected the books lost during the time of trouble.92 On the other hand, Judah Maccabee died in the spring of 160 b.c.e. The internal date of this passage cannot be December of 148 s.e., as the consensus assumes on the basis of 2 Macc. 1:18a and 2:16, for this would hardly allow enough time for Judah's pursuit of a purely peaceful activity. Summer of 149 s.e. seems the earliest possible date for the offer of books on Judaism to the Jews of Egypt. 8.8.

Verses 17-18 compress the letter's basic ideas. They begin by acknow !edging that it was God and none of the leaders, perhaps including Judah, (gi) The perfect participle γεγονότα js an indication that the war is completed. (92) Scholars disagree on which books are being referred to in this verse. Grimm, pp. 57-8, suggests the writer had the canon in mind with the "kings" including Samuel and Kings as well as possibly Judges, Ruth and Esther. The writings of David must mean the Psalms, not the entire hagiographa. The "letters of kings about votive offerings" must refer to Ezra 7:12 ff. Keil, Commentar, p. 300, considers the "letters of kings about votive offerings" to be a reference to the canonical Ezra and Nehemiah. Herkenne, Briefe, pp. 95-7, rejects this suggestion, however he defines the "writings of David" as the 5th revision of the Psalms which took place under Nehemiah and which resulted in the final form of that collection. Bevenot,Bevenot, Makkabaerbriefe, p. 177, suggests the "kings" include the 2 books of Kings, and the "prophets" include Samuel and the majority of canonical prophets. However the "letters of kings concerning votive offerings" refers to gifts of Antiochus the Great (Josephus, Ant., 12: 134-144) and Seleucus IV to the Jews (p. 181). Abel, Livres, p. 308, notes that the "letters of kings concerning votive offerings" must refer to letters of the kings of Persia of which we find some in Ezra, however most are lost, so this reference is to a non-canonical source. Zeitlin, Second Book, p. 113, notes that Nehemiah did not canonize the hagiographa.</page><page sequence="39">[39] the letter from judah maccabee to aristobulus 127 who had brought salvation; thereby repeating what was expressed in the letter's beginning (1:11-12).93 This line goes on to answer a question that, though not stated, hovers over the entire document: By what authority do the writers of the letter speak? God gave them the authority, the letter claims, as was evident by the return of the inheritance (KXqpovop(oc)94 to all his people. This no doubt refers to the conquest of Jerusalem and the holy land by the pious. The letter goes on to claim that the kingship (PocoIXeiov), the priesthood (tspdcreupa) and the consecration (àyiaopôç)95 have been returned as well, as God had promised in the law (2:18). The letter then closes with what has become characteristic of Jewish writing ever since the Book of Malachi: the messianic promise. Just as he had saved the people of Judaea so he will soon gather the Jews scattered in the diaspora. The final sentence provides a one line summary of the entire letter: "God has rescued us from great evils and has purified the place." The mention of the restoration of kingship might suggest that the author of the letter employed an anachronistic term as none of the Hasmonean princes claimed the tide of king prior to Aristobulus (104 103 B.c.E.).96 Even thereafter this tide was claimed only in the secular sense, and never as a successor to King David. But there is no reason to assume that the passage means to imply that Judah had assumed the crown, nor does the mention of priesthood mean that Judah took the office of high priest.97 The term kingship seems to mean here the power (93) See segment 2, pp. 8-10 above. (94) The general meaning for this word in Greek is "inheritance." In the LXX both κλήρος (lot) and κληρονομία are used to describe the inheritance when the Israelites took possession of Canaan. These words are often used interchangeably in the conquest material in that both terms are utilized in the translation of נחלה. However in context it seems that κλήρος is used to designate a portion of land which is allotted by God while κληρονομία serves to emphasize that God has given this as a firm and lasting patrimony. Furthermore Israel or Palestine is called Yahweh's נחלה, that portion which Yahweh has allotted for himself forever. This term is then utilized in some of the prophetic writings to designate the future נחלה, an eschatological meaning which is extended to include all of the earth as well as eternal life in the pseudepigrapha (TDNT [1965], v. 3, pp. 759-85)■ (95) These three words are found together in the LXX at Exodus 19:1 and 23:22 (this latter verse appears to insert this material into the text since the whole verse is missing in the Hebrew Bible) along with λαός, which also appears in the same verse of our text. This description of Israel as "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation" is part of the giving of the Torah at Sinai. The promise and the charge of the Exodus verse will have been perceived in messianic terms at the time of our letter, thus here it is referring to the fulfillment of the messianic promise which the writer saw as happening in his own time. (96) Schurer, History (see note 47 above), pp. 216-7. (97) Grimm, Handbuch, p. 59, argues against an earlier view of this verse which inter preted it as the restoration of the land as a private possession and the resumption of a native</page><page sequence="40">128 BEN ZION WACHOLDER [40] in political and military matters just as priesthood alludes to the restora tion of the legitimate ecclesiastical functions. Consecration is less clear but seems to refer to the holy way of life. Leviticus 19:2 prefixes the holiness code, "You shall be holy; for I the Lord your God am holy." By the restoration of the consecration the ancestral Law has been brought back to Israel. The letter announces the termination of the recent suppression of these three under Aniochus: autonomy, the legitimate line of priests, and the ancestral way of life. This harmonizes with the feeling of religious fervor and piety which seems to underlie the entire letter. The very last word of the letter (èKa0âp1a£v),sayingthat theplace"was purified" shows that the author(s) of the letter never meant to suggest that the message had been sent prior to the cleansing of the temple on Kislev 25 of 148 S.E. (164 B.C.E.). Let us now take an overview of the letter instead of the segment by segment analysis pursued so far. If this document is a fabrication, and scholarly consensus maintains that it is, it constitutes a unique type of Jewish Hellenistic forgery. A glance at the variety of Graeco-Jewish forgeries reveals that they have one common characteristic — pagans praising Jews or aspects of Judaism. The Jewish attributions to Homer, Hesiod, Linus, or Euripides, the Letter of Aristeas, the Judaeo-Spartan correspondence, and the suspected documents preserved by Josephus have this common denominator.98 The royal correspondence in 2 Macc. kingship, legitimate priesthood and the temple. Rather, he interprets this as the restoration of scattered Israel to its rightful place, wearing the royal crown when it would rule over the nations in the messianic era, being the priest to the nations, i.e. through observance of the law facilitating the reunion of the nations with God and the consecration of the nations through the re-established temple service. Keil,Commentar, pp. 301-2, argues this is rather a reference to Exodus 1 g:6 which includes the deliverance from the bondage of Egypt and the calling to be a special people which took place at Sinai. Herkenne.Brir/è, pp. 99-101, agrees that the context for this verse is Exodus 19:6, but for him the verse provides the conceptual meaning rather than the historical background of the passage. The priesthood refers to Israel's role as being separated from the nations for the purpose of the maintenance of Yahwism and the kingship refers to the prominence of Israel which follows from this role. The consecration refers to the call to holiness, the call to be separate from the nations. However, on the basis of 2 Macc. 2:4, he does claim that the inheritance and the consecration are related in that the separation of Israel from the nations is signified by and accomplished through a special land. Bévenot, Makkabàerbucher, understands the kingship as that of the Hasmoneans. Zeitlin, Second Book, p. 114, also sees the kingship as a specific reference; however in view of his dating of the book in 41-2 C.E., he suggests it refers to John Hyrcanus (136-105 B.c.E.) or Agrippa I (41-44 C.E.). (98) We could also include the orphie poem found in Eusebius which he cites from Aristobulus (Prep. Evang. 13, 12, 5) as well as other authors found in the pseudojustinian tractates, De Monarchic1 and Cohortatio ad gentiles, and in Clement of Alexandria such as</page><page sequence="41">[41] THE LETTER FROM JUDAH MACCABEE TO ARISTOBULUS 1 2 9 11:16-38 also represents a similar spirit." There exists no ancient docu ment written by and for Jews, however, whose authenticity is suspect. But the preceding sentence is inaccurate if the document in 2 Macc. 1:1 o-2:18 is indeed a pseudograph. Shall the letter from Jerusalem to the Jews of Alexandria announcing the celebration of a new festival be regarded as unique or shall it be classified as an authentic message and no exception to the generalization? If the letter is a pseudograph, it was composed by someone who had devoted himself to the study of early Maccabean history and who wished to propagate his views concerning this period. The document then needs to be studied as a historiographie work. How did its author treat Judah Maccabee? What kind of Judaism of the various sects which flourished in the aftermath of the Maccabean period is reflected in the work?100 When and where did this pseudographer live? Finally, why did he choose the epistological format instead of a straightforward retelling of the story of Hanukkah? An outline of the letter reveals a work that was carefully drafted. Exegetes have as a rule judged the letter to be an incoherent or synthetic composition. The opinion seems to have no justification, although judg ment may depend on whether one regards the letter as genuine or a forgery. Outline Outline of Letter (2 Macc. 1:10-2:18) A.

Thanksgiving for restoration and Messianic hope (2:17-18) The document reveals that its author(s) employed repetition carefully in order to underline the letter's significant point. Otherwise the redun dancy of the main ideas does not make sense. Except for the digressions (D. 1. and D. 2.), the letter's main theme is the expression of gratitude to God for the miraculous salvation from the grave dangers. Not only does the letter begin (1:11-12) and end (2:17-18) with this topic, but the account of Antiochus IV's death (B. 2, verses 1:13-17) is told from this perspective. In fact 2:17 begins with words similar to 1:11; and 1:17 reiterates the theme in the form of a prayer. Verses 1:18a and 2:16 contain almost identical words in urging the consecration of the new feast of the purification of the temple. The last two words of the letter (2:18) mention the purification of the sanctuary for the third time. It is clear, from the amount of space devoted to the respective subjects, that the major theme of the letter is as mentioned above—the indebtedness to God for his miraculous salvation. Another theme reiterated in the letter which has hitherto remained unnoticed is contained in three passages alluding to the ingathering of exiles. Once again, the repetition of this idea in nearly identical words adds to the presumption of the epistle's unity: 1. 1. "Gather together our scattered people, set free those who are slaves among the Gentiles, look upon those who are rejected and despised, and let the Gentiles know that thou art our God. Afflict those who oppress and are insolent with pride. Plant thy people in thy holy place, as Moses said" (1:27-29). 2. When Jeremiah learned of it he rebuked them and declared: "The place shall be unknown until God gathers his people together again and shows his mercy. And then the Lord will disclose these things, and the glory of the Lord and the cloud will appear, as they were shown in the case of Moses, and as Solomon asked that the place should be specially consecrated" (2:7-8). 3.

If, as we presume, these passages form part of a letter from Judah Maccabee to Aristobulus, they may be extremely revealing. They seem to be saying that Judah and his followers perceived the recent events as a beginning only, that the miraculous death of Antiochus and the purifica tion of the sanctuary were but a prelude to the soon-expected redemption of Israel which would reach its completion in the messianic ingathering of the exiles. This point, if present, would have been particularly telling in a letter to the Jews of Egypt. I believe that the thematic emphasis of the letter ought to be an important consideration in the judgment of the document's authenticity. One must decide whether this repetidveness of theme reflects the work of a historian who composed the document to teach a historical lesson of divine mercy or reflects the piety that seems to have permeated the circle of the pious in 163 b.c.e. If the former, the pseudographer ought to be reckoned as one of the greatest ancient Jewish historians. There exist four other ancient accounts of the proclamation of the feast of Hanukkah: 1. the anonymous record of 1 Maccabees (4:52-60), 2. its paraphrase by Josephus (J.A. 12:325), 3. a summary of Justus of Cyrene in 2 Maccabees (10:1-9), 4. scholion to Megillat Tacanit. None of these writers were able to convey the piety of the people as they beheld the apparent miracle which prompted the feeling of gratitude to God. Only our letter does it masterfully. The news of the death of Antiochus IV, evidently from the region of Ispahan in Persia, must have stunned the pious. The savants who argue that the letter is a pseudograph ought to acknowledge the skill of this pseudographer. A more plausible explanation for the ability of the author(s) of the letter to convey the authentic meaning of the origin of the new feast is not a historian's masterly insight into the past, but that the letter was written by or on behalf of Judah Maccabee. There is no need to presume that a historian who acted as a master pseudographer ever existed. A simpler hypothesis seems justified. The letter is a contemporary document, addressed to Aristobulus and the Jews of Egypt in the spring or summer of 163 b.c.e. 101 By mistakenly antedating (loi) The question of how these two letters became prefixed to the Second Book of Maccabees has been frequently discussed in the literature. Jason or the epitomist are frequently said to have authored the letter (Niese, Kritik, p. 11 ; Abel, Livres, p. 310; Zeitlin, Second Second Book, p. 38; Starcky and Abel, Livres, p. 34; Momigliano, Classical Philology, v. 70, pp. 82-3; Goldstein, I Maccabees, pp. 555-6).

The available evidence suggests that 2 Macc. 1:tob-2:18 is with great probability a document written soon after the stunning news of the death of Antiochus IV in Persia reached the holy city. "The Lord has triumphed; let us consecrate eight days to him." Postcript After this paper had been set in print, A. Momigliano raised the. question whether the influence of the Book of Daniel, composed circa 164 b.c.e.b.c.e., may be discernible in the epistle which, if authentic, was written a year later. The answer seems to be positive. Several puzzling features of the letter become more comprehensible if it is presumed that it was written under the impact of this influential book. Two historical figures, a contemporary of Nebuchadnezzar, Jeremiah, and an official in the Per sian palace, Nehemiah, receive special mention in 2 Macc. 1:10-2:18. Aware of the future restoration of the Jerusalem sanctuary, Jeremiah preserved some of the sacred fire which had descended from heaven in the days of Moses and Solomon. Nehemiah used this fire to rekindle the altar for the reinauguration of the sacrificial rites. There is nothing in the book of Jeremiah that even hints at such a prophetic role. Daniel 9 does tell that a line in Jeremiah, if properly understood, is the key to the events that would happen at the end of time. The legend of Jeremiah's role in the concealed sacred fuel in 2 Macc. seems to fit into the contemporary enhancement of the exilic prophet as a man of mysteries. The role of Nehemiah in 2 Macc. 1:18-35 also becomes more under standable if some features of Daniel are subsumed under the figure of Nehemiah. It is not only that like Daniel, Nehemiah performs miraculous feats, but the authenticity of these events is likewise confirmed by Persian kings (2 Macc. 1:33-35). 2 Macc. relates that the Persian king after inves tigating the matter, confirmed Nehemiah's deed. The only other place in the Bible where the story-teller employs the attestation of a miracle by a pagan ruler are the assertions in Daniel, affirming both the salvation of Daniel from the mouths of the lions and the safety of his three compan ions from the furnace. A problem arises, however. If Daniel's influence was so strong, would it not have been more fitting to use Daniel's name rather than that of Nehemiah? The answer is perhaps, as John Kampen Certainly 2 Macc. 2:19 reads as if nothing preceded it. The responsibility for joining the letters to the Second Book of Maccabees apparently belongs to a subsequent scribe (Grimm, Handbuch,Handbuch, p. 25; Keil, Commentar, p. 269; Lacquer, Untersuchungen, pp. 65-6; Kolbe.Beitmge, pp. 120-1; Bunge, Untersuchungen, pp. 155-8).</page><page sequence="45">[45] the letter from judah maccabee to aristobulus 133 suggests, that at the time of writing of the letter, presumably in 163 b.c.e., the book of Daniel had not yet attained the status of an authoritative religious document, as it apparently did shortly thereafter (1 Macc. 2:59-60, Josephus, Ant. 10:267-8). The authors of the letter may have preferred to draw Daniel in the figure of Nehemiah, who was known in the Diaspora. Incidentally, Nehemiah, like Daniel, has companions who participate in these acts of divine intervention (2 Macc. 1:33, 36). Another reason may be that Daniel reputedly lived either in Babylon or Suza but not in Jerusalem. Nehemiah however, likewise a cupbearer in the service of Artaxerxes, rebuilt the walls of the holy city. The feature that characterizes both accounts is the drawing of a contrast between the ancient days during the reign of the Persian kings and those of the more recent Hellenistic rule. Unlike the sad present when so many Judaeans were sinful, Daniel and 2 Macc. relate that there existed in former times men such as Daniel and his companions or Nehemiah and his associates, who held the highest office in the royal palace, yet remained absolutely loyal to Judaism. In fact God considered them so worthy as to perform miracles in their behalf. All this does not preclude the possibility that a forger living long after the publication of Daniel exploited the book's popularity in a fictive composition, however it does make better sense if, at the time of the addressing of the letter, the books which had foretold the events of their own days could be read in freshly written copies on newly-wrought parchment.</page></plain_text>
