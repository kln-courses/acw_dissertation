<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES Daniel J. Lasker AGAINST WHOM DID SAADIA POLEMICIZE IN HIS DISCUSSION CONCERNING ABROGATION OF THE TORAH? In an article published in Daat 25 (pp. 21-51), Eliezer Schlossberg explained Rav Saadia Gaon's discussion of abrogation of the Torah (naskh, in Emunot ve De'ot, 3:7-9) as being directed against Islam. To substantiate this understanding, Schlossberg adduced a number of parallel arguments which can be found in Muslim writings. Many of these parallels, however, are drawn from material which post-dates Saadia. Closer parallels which pre-date Saadia can be found in Christian literature, including the New Testament,, Church Fathers, and Christian literature in Syriac and Arabic. Saadia was familiar with Christianity, as can be seen in his refutations of the doctrines of trinity and incarnation, as well as his rejection of the Christian assertion that the messiah has already come. There were sizable Christian communities in Egypt (where Saadia was born) and in Iraq (where Saadia wrote most of his works). It is, therefore, much more reasonable to assume that Emunot ve-De'ot 3:7-9 is directed primarily against Christianity and not Islam, though Islam may have been a secondary target. Eliezer Schlossberg WHO WAS THE TARGET OF R. SAADIA GAON'S POLEMIC ABOUT THE ABROGATION OF THE TORAH? A RESPONSE TO PROF. DANIEL H. LASKER'S PAPER In his important article published in this issue, Prof. Lasker claims that R. Saadia Gaon's polemic in Emunot ve-De'ot and in his biblical commentaries on</page><page sequence="2">Summaries LXI the abrogation of the Torah (= Naskh) was aimed mainly against the Christians. Though I concede that R. Saadia's debate concerning Naskh included some polemics against the Christians, I do not consider them as its leading target. Since the idea of Naskh is widely accepted in Moslem religion and thought, to the extent of being identified with them, very strong proofs are needed to substantiate the claim that the Gaon's debate targeted on the Christians, rather than on the Moslems. In this short paper I attempt to refute Prof. Lasker's arguments, thereby vindicating the traditional view, according to which the given polemic actually concerned the Moslems. Paul Β. Fenton "THE HEAD BETWEEN THE KNEES" CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY OF A MEDITATIONAL POSTURE IN JEWISH AND MUSLIM MYSTICISM A symbol, amongst other things, of the reintegration into the prenatal state, the meditational posture consisting of placing the head between the knees is attested in both the Jewish and Muslim traditions. The present article diachronical study retracing the phenomenology of this practice as portrayed in mystical sources, in order to demonstrate the continuity of the technique as well as the possibility of mutual influence between the two religious traditions with what concerns its practice. Raphael Jospe THE TORAH AND ASTROLOGY ACCORDING TO ABRAHAM IBN EZRA As a rationalist Bible exegete, Abraham ibn Ezra believed that the Torah should be understood in light of science. Reason is the "anger' linking man and God, and is thus at the core of revelation. Since, for Ibn Ezra (as opposed to Maimonides), there is no sharp demarcation between scientific astronomy and judicial astrology, astrology can provide a scientific explanation of terrestial</page><page sequence="3">LXII Summaries phenomena, including such biblical phenomena as the terafim (Gen. 31:19 and I Samuel 19:13) and saraf (Numbers 21:8). Ibn Ezra's astrology follows from his Neo-Platonic cosmology, in which the terrestial realm is subject to the "higher powers" of the incorruptible celestial spheres, which in turn are subject to the influences of the supreme realm, that of the rational soul (neshamah) and the angels, all of which are subject to God, the "absolute One". The stars, however, possess no independent will or power; their activity is mechanical and automatic. Ibn Ezra therefore rejects both star worship and theurgy. Astral influences, which depend on the physical constitution (toledet) of the receiver (meqabbel) as well as the constellation (ma'arekhet) of the higher power, cannot be changed. In a parable based on an astrological passage in the Arabic "Letters of the Brethren of Purity", Ibn Ezra regards the pre-determined predictability of astral influences as enabling the person who understands them to take the measures necessary to avoid their effect and to be saved from harm. Reason, after all, belongs to the highest realm and thus transcends the intermediate realm of the stars. The Torah, being revealed, also derives from the supreme rational realm; thus it provides the Jewish people with a unique mechanism for escaping astral influences "as long as they observe it". "Every nation has a known star and constellation... But God gave Israel a great superiority by his, rather than a star's, being their guide, for Israel is God's portion" (Commentaiy to Deut. 4:19). Yohanan Silman THE LITERARY ASPECT OF THE KUZARI This paper aims to explore the relationship between the literary genre of The Kuzari and its philosophical contents, thereby shedding a new light on the story of the conversion, as well as on some major trends in Halevi's thought. The paper propose to view the story of the conversion as a symbolic narrative. The life story of the king of the Khazars encapsulates the wider human history, which continuously proceeds toward a closeness with God. The king's paganism stands for the pagan stage in the religious development of man; his dream symbolizes multi-levelled religious experiences, including the Sinai revelation; the various religious spokesmen appearing before him stand for clearly-defined stages in the process of approaching God.</page><page sequence="4">Summaries LXIII At the theoretical level of the book, these reciprocal relationships between form and contents underline the author's historiosophical views concerning the laws governing the process whereby the individual, or the human collective, approaches God. These laws are manifested in the fixed stages of this process and are reinforced by the impact of unique occurrences. Within the story of man's striving toward God, R. Judah Halevi also grapples with the problem of the abjectness of the Jewish people amidst the nations of the world. His views on this issue display a profound affinity between the synchronic and diachronic aspects of the story of the conversion and the total range of his thought. Warren Zev Harvey NURIEL'S METHOD FOR DECIPHERING THE SECRETS OF THE GUIDE In 1964, Abraham Nuriel published an essay on Maimonides' theory of creation which established a new method for deciphering the secrets of the Guide of the Perplexed. He examined the use of the keyword al-b&amp;ri' (Creator) in the Guide. He found it was never used in contexts relating to the Kalamic theory of creation after nonexistence, but always in those coherent with Aristotle's theory of eternity. He concluded that Maimonides' theory of creation was Aristotelian, not Kalamic; and thus presented a compelling solution for one of the more famous puzzles of the Guide. Nuriel used his method again in a 1970 essay on Maimonides' concept of the divine will. He distinguished between two terms: mashfah and iradah. The former is more metaphysical, and denotes the static First Cause; the latter is more psychological, and portrays the divine will as dynamic. In the one place in the Guide (III, 12) where the divine will appears together with the term al-bdri', Maimonides, as expected, uses mashfah. In an essay on Maimonides' views on providence published in 1980, Nuriel distinguished between 'inayah (providence), used to designate the special providence over humans, which is dependent on intellectual attainment, and tadbir (governance), used to designate the general providence in nature, which is present also in a political community governed by divine Law (which imitates nature). Like al-bari' and mashfah, 'inayah refers to the eternal; like iradah, tadbfr refers to the temporal. His distinction between 'inayah and tadbir enabled</page><page sequence="5">LXIV Summaries Nuriel to solve a puzzle in Guide III, 51, concerning Psalms 91:7. In a series of additional essays on the Guide, Nuriel clarified the meanings of other keywords. He has given us an excellent method for deciphering the secrets of the Guide. Hannah Kasher MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED A MASTERPIECE OR HOLY WRIT? It is proper to view Maimonides' Moreh Nevukhim as a masterpiece, a work rigorously and meticulously composed by a great man. Indeed, the discussions of the late Prof. Abraham Νuriel are based on this very assumption. However, a subtle distinction must be made between evaluating this work as a masterpiece and treating it as holy scripture. By overemphasizing this work as superb text that meets the most stringent literary criteria one is likely to reduce its author, the profound exegete, into a mere expositor. Masha Turner THE RELEVANCY OF MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED TO THE PRESENT-DAY JEW As much as Maimonides' philosophical teaching arouses great interest, it is hardly relevant to our days. The doctrine of the negative divine attributes rules out a personal relationship with God by undermining the simplistic and traditional meaning of such concepts as prayer and the observance of the Commandments. Moreover, viewing the Commandments not as ends in themselves, but rather as the means for higher, nobler goals, depletes them of their absolute and imperative value and, thus sabotaging the commitment to them. Besides, the separation between a philosophical religion meant for select "individuals" and a traditional religion targeted on the "masses" is alien to our modern democratic climate and hence practically inapplicable. In addition, Maimonides' exegesis in his Guide does not lend itself to receptive</page><page sequence="6">Summaries LXV adoption because of the author's tendentious attempts to establish harmony between the biblical and talmudic sources and his own philosophical system. In veiw of the above, it is hereby proposed that nowadays the Guide is to be viewed not as guidance toward forming a proper world view, but as a model inspiring a new philosophical doing that tackles contemporary problems. Imposing truth as a supreme value, viewing the Commandments as expressing Jewish particularism, advancing the individual and society toward physical and spiritual perfection, and, finally, recognizing the sense of continuity that runs through Jewish history — all of these principles are easily transferable into modern views, without entailing the incorporation of those specific contents and ideas that are far removed from our contemporaries' perspective. Michael Nehorai 'SHEMESH BE-GIV'ON DOM" (SUN STAND STILL UPON GIVON) This paper dwells on the interpretation of the miracle performed for Joshua in Giv'on(Josh 10:12-13) as suggested by R. Solomon son of R. Judah the Prince. R. Solomon's commentary appears in two texts stored in the Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts at the Jewish National and University Library: MS Cambridge 393/2 and MS Theological Seminary, London 52. R. Solomon, of the fourteenth century, must have fled from Spain or Provence to Ashkenaz, where he served as a teacher of Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed. In his opinion, the sun and the moon did not stand still in Giv'on — no prophet is able to effect a change in the divinely established order of the metaphysical world. What happened in Giv'on was that "the Lord cast down great stones from heaven" (ibid, 10:11). Now, these hailstones produced darkness, as the clouds covered the sun. Finding it difficult to lead the army under these circumstances, Joshua proclaimed: "Shemesh be-Giv'on dom," thus requesting God to uncover the sun and enable its rays to illuminate the battle field in spite of the heavy hail. The paper also clarifies that the given interpretation fits in with, and sheds light on, the saying of the sages concerning three persons — Moses, Joshua, and Nakdimon ben Guriyon — for whose sake "nikdemah lahem hamah"(Ta'anit 20a).</page><page sequence="7">LXVI Summaries Yair Shiffman FALAQUERA AND IBN TIBBON AS TRANSLATORS OF THE GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED Shem Τον Falaquera and Samuel Ibn Tibbon are known as the most prominent translators of Maimonides' 'The Guide of the Perplexed'. Falaquera also composed a special chapter to comment on Ibn Tibbon's translation of the Guide. This article presents this chapter in an annotated edition with my commentary. Most of Falaquera's comments on Ibn Tibbon's translation are correct. He demonstrates a profound knowledge of the Arabic language — as well as a deep erudition of Maimonides' philosophy. Dov Schwartz RATIONALISM AND CONSERVATISM THE PHILOSOPHY OF RABBI SOLOMON BEN ADRETH'S CIRCLE The intellectual history of the Jews in Christian Spain has covered mainly the philosophers and the kabbalists, while overlooking the contribution of the Halakhists. The present article clarifies the crucial role played by the latter in Jewish philosophy. During the fourteenth century, a circle of Halakhists subscribing to a moderate philosophical world view was crystallized around Solomon ben Adreth (= Rashba). The members of this group (a) were all famous Talmudists, the friends or disciples of Asher of Toledo and Rashba. Among them were the author of Sefer ha-Hinukh, Yom Τον Alashvili (Ritva), Menahem ben Zerah, Samuel ben Mesulam and Meir Aldaby; (b) were strongly inclined toward Kabbalistic concepts such as metempsychosis or the circularity of the worlds, within which our world constitutes just one phase; (c) shared moderate, Neoplatonic notions of Creation, the divine attributes, psychology and the world to come, all deriving from a belief in the superiority of revelation over philosophy.</page><page sequence="8">Summaries LXVII Gad Freudenthal "THE AIR BLESSED BE HE AND BLESSED BE HIS NAME" IN SEFER HA-MASKIL BY R. SHLOMO SIMHA OF TROYES Sefer ha-Maskil (The Book of the Perspicacious Sage j was written by R. Shlomo Simha ben Eliezer, at Troyes in 1294. It is extant in a unique manuscript (MS Moscow, State Library, Giinsburg 508) and has gone almost unnoticed by historians, until Prof. Israel Ta-Shma drew attention to it in 1983. Sefer ha-Maskil is a highly personal, even idiosyncratic work, in which theological reflections and empirical observations are webbed into a unitary framework with halakhic, midrashic and mystical elements. Its most significant feature is its unique theology, which has no parallels in Jewish thought. R. Shlomo holds that the Godhead is identical with the posited cosmic Air, extending throughout the world. According to R. Shlomo, the Air is a conscious Being endowed with Reason. During creation, the upper and the lower worlds were formed out of this primeval Air. In the upper world, the Air is an infinite brightness; in fact, the firmament (which will disappear at the End of Days) is a veil separating us from that heavenly Splendor, and the sun is simply a tiny hole in that veil, allowing an infinitesimal portion of the celestial Light to reach us. In the lower world, the primeval Air gave rise to matter. God is thus immanent to His world — He is all-pervading and therefore omniscient, and governs everything. The main upshot of this theology is that it allows R. Shlomo to adduce a very original solution to the problem of anthropomorphism. R. Shlomo is in fact aware of the recent tendencies to deny that God has "form and shape." Yet he abhors the idea of interpreting Scriptures allegorically, a move that, he alleges, undermines the validity of the commandments. R. Shlomo holds that "anthropomorphic" attributes are in fact applied to God and to man in precisely the same meaning. All Scriptures can and must be interpreted literally. From the point of view of the history of ideas, Sefer ha-Maskil is of considerable interest because of the close affinity between Stoic philosophy and R. Shlomo's theology: his theology definitely shares the radicalism of the Stoic materialist immanentism. Although R. Shlomo has no inkling of the details of Stoic physics, he yet maintains, like the Stoics, that the unique cosmic Air (called pneuma by the Stoics), extending throughout the world, in fact sustains it — it holds together the entire world and each and every substance in it. The paper discusses at some length Stoic influence on Jewish thought as instanced in</page><page sequence="9">LXVIII Summaries several Midrashim, in Shabbetai Donolo, and particularly in Saadia Gaon's Commentary on Sefer Yesira. Saadia's works (of which paraphrases were available in Ashkenaz and in Sarfat very early) apparently gave the impulse to the elaboration of a "doctrine of airs" among Hasidey Ashkenaz, a tradition to which Sefer ha-Maskil may be related. The sources of Sefer ha-Maskil and its intellectual context are admittedly still an enigma. The work does not reveal even the faintest acquaintance with science or philosophy; R. Shlomo presumably never even heard of the Guide of the Perplexed. The only sources whose use could be established are the astrological sections of Ibn Gabirol's Keter Malkhut and a passage from a midrash ascribed to R. Moshe ha-Darshan from Narbonne. The second part of the paper consists of a critical edition of some passages of Sefer ha-Maskil bearing mainly on empirical observations, cosmology, hermeneutics, and theology. Moshe Idel THE LOST BOOKS OF SOLOMON Two kabbalistic manuscripts belonging to the 15th century Sefer ha-Meshiv, found in the Mussaioff Library in Jerusalem, contain a sharp critique of philosophy and a proposal for an alternative science, which consists, on its theoretical level, in speculative Kabbalah, and on its practical level, in magical practices. This critique may be significant for Dame F.H. Yates1 thesis concerning the emergence of science out of the Renaissance renascence of occult lores.</page></plain_text>
