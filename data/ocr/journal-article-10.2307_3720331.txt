<plain_text><page sequence="1">'PIRAMUS ET TISBE' If the student of the Old French romances of the early period often feels impelled to explain the changes in the way Ovid was exploited for the benefit of courtly circles, it may be that this in some way reflects the speculation aroused in their own time among people able to appreciate their originality. Attention has been drawn to the archaic character of the conception of love in the Piramus et Tisbe,' a paraphrase in which the French poet is directly dependent on Ovid for his charac- ters and story. Though it is pre-eminently as storyteller and not as psychologist that Ovid appears in this tale, yet the psychology is delicately sketched. It is just these indications that the French poet seizes on, and by amplification he remodels the poem according to his own idea of things. The evolution of the love affair is preceded by a passage which serves to amplify the general idea underlying it. It takes the form of an apostrophe to Amor, who is represented as a person; his dart is described and the nature of its wound. The allegorical figure of the little archer suggests the kind of exercise indicated by Quintilian, who calls it a kind of 'chria'.2 Among other additions the lyrical monologues are the most noticeable feature, then motivation, and psychological characterization; the poet may fill out a scene in detail or render its meaning more explicit. This method has obvious shortcomings on the side of dramatic narrative. The suspense created by the Latin poet is largely destroyed, though the remanieur succeeds in making quite an effective emotional atmosphere out of the lovers' foreboding. These long-drawn monologues seem to be digressions and strangely out of place. The desire to make the characters express their thoughts in words effectively transforms the Ovidian lovers from their mute simplicity: even the dying Piramus is made to put his recognition of his beloved into words. Indeed, during several of the plaints the action comes to a complete standstill. The interest is in what a particular person says or thinks on a particular occasion. During the first monologue Piramus is alone in his room; the theme is his grief and despair for love of Tisbe whom he no longer sees. Round this simple topic, aided by his knowledge of the circumstances, the French poet builds his monologue, and adds the embellishments of a rhetorical style. In the first ten lines alone we find examples of 'interrogatio', 'dissolutio', 'correctio', 'similitudo' and 'excla- matio'. Although the monologue consists mainly of appeals, it has its own movement. It is towards greater clarity, as Piramus gradually realizes that his happiness is not in his own hands, that he is dependent for salvation and peace on a power beyond himself. The corresponding monologue by Tisbe, though the theme is identical, makes a step in the direction of the inner conflict. We are quite conscious of her hesitations, the ebb and flow of thoughts and emotions. The monologue has in it some of the elements of the deliberative speech in rhetoric, with considerations of 'honestum' and 'utile ': nMais quant je plus pens et meins voi En quel guise prendrai conroi, Amis douz, de parler a toi. 1 Ed. by C.

Veulz ta chastee violer En ton lignage vergonder? Non faire! Garde Raison qui t'est contraire ! The particular function of the 'reprise' is an invention of the poet's own, the first foreshadowing of the possibilities of the 'monologue interieur', and a break with the plaint of popular or epic tradition. And again at 277: Par le conseil mon pere avrai Autresi gent ami, bien sai. -Si gent? Mal vueil se Piramus m'entent. It emphasizes the process of 'dedoublement' which has been traced to Ovid,1 in particular to the monologue of Medea in the seventh book of the Metamorphoses. Obviously the fully articulate characters in Ovid would make a direct appeal to a poet of the schools. M. Faral, who discusses the 'reprise' in the Piramus and in Chretien de Troyes, quotes examples from Latin school poetry and suggests the influence of 'un enseignement litteraire traditionnel'.2 At the same time he con- fesses that he has been unable to identify this figure in the rhetorical treatises anterior to the twelfth century.3 It seems to me a figure which would come into play almost naturally in disputation; in the monologue of Medea there is a striking example of a 'reprise' which for a man of the schools would be an instance of perhaps 'con- duplicatio .4 With Tisbe sexual modesty appears on the side of Reason, and against both Pudor and Reason rises the force of passion, itself armed with rhetoric. Finally there is again the recognition of a personal relationship not only to the beloved but also to a God of Love. In the second pair of lyrical monologues the couple are able to converse and they address each other. Piramus begins by comparing himself to the hungry hawk returning at call. The God of Love has linked them together inexorably: again the dual relationship: N e sai cui prier, vous ou lui. Bele, a vous fai je mon refui. Se por vous muir, tant mar i fui. Amie, Mout feriiez grant vilenie Se par vous perdoie la vie, Quant par vous puis avoir aie. There follows an enumeration of his sufferings, how he is bereft of 'dormir, boivre et mengier'; then the merest hint of self-consciousness: Bien ai apris mal a souffrir. The present and the future offer no respite, unless love leaves him: Ja ne garrai se ne me fuit. 1 E.

Amours ne me veut pas guerpir; Pour Amours m'estovra morir. Morrai ? In a return of faith he sees himself as a suppliant before Tisbe who, as by a miracle, can make him whole. Then he continues with an amplification of Ovid's lines in the short speech allowed the lovers by the Latin poet, the apostrophe of the wall. The French poet is less restrained: the wall, the partition, the house, the chink, the plaster are all addressed in turn. In Tisbe's answering plaint the real God is invoked because of something which has happened to one of his creatures. Following the example of Canace and Hero in Ovid, she describes how by day she is in distress, by night she is beguiled by her dreams. Wakening, she believes her lover is still before her, and seeking to grasp the image finds it is unreal. She tells how Piramus has appeared to her in a dream, and represents the young man as speaking to her, inviting her to join him outside the city: by this means the poet motivates the midnight adventure, whereas in Ovid we have the bare fact of the arrangement. This clever device is a new element for a plaint, and binds it to the narrative in something like an organic way. So far the rhetorician that was in Ovid has been strictly under control. In Pyramus's last monologue, before the blood-stained mantle, the glitter of figures appears for a moment, but the poet's interest in what happened, in the story for the story's sake, continues unabated, action and speech knit together, as Pyramus resolves to take his own life. The French poet at this point sets Piramus off on an apostrophe of all the circumstances attendant on his calamity: the night, the mulberry tree, the meadow, the fountain. He addresses the absent Tisbe, whom he believes dead, then reverts to Ovid's speech for material: Ma cure, C'est granz damages que cil dure, Qui de venir vous fist seiire, Sole, en tel lieu, par nuit oscure. Sole! The word forms the transition to another thought suggested by the 'annominatio', a rhetorical cleverness of the kind Ovid himself would have admired: Ha, de l'escommenie gole Qui de vostre char est saole! He, las! Ci voi du sane, ci voi des dras. Lions, tu qui la devoras, Merveil se plus n'en i lessas; Ovid was careful not to allow his hero time for such reflexion: the whole action tended to rapidity. The French Piramus turns to reproach the moon. He pities his own sad plight, then considers how to put an end to his life: Terre, por Dieu, qar m'englotis, Ou tu, lions, qui l'ocei's, Repaire! Je sui tous pres sans nul contraire. Ta volent6 pues de moi faire. Revien, 26</page><page sequence="4">HTETLEN C. R. LAURIE 27 Qui devoras la douce rien. Son sane beiis; or boi le mien! Dolens! Ma douce amie, trop sui lens, Qu'a vostre mort ne fui presens. Morz, que demores? Qar me prens! He, Morz, Por quoi demores? C'est grans torz, Que je ne sui or endroit morz. He ends on another note, the metamorphosis of the mulberry, then pierces himself with the sword. Thisbe returns to the spot, and the monologue she is given by Ovid, delighting in his own ingenuity, appeals to the intellect rather than the emotions of the reader: she addresses the dying Pyramus (Met. iv, 148-53): 'tua te manus' inquit, 'amorque Perdidit infelix! est et mihi fortis in unum Hoc manus, est et amor: dabit his in vulnera vires. Persequar extinctum letique miserrima dicar Causa comesque tui: quique a me morte revelli Heu sola poteras, poteris nec morte revelli....' The medieval Tisbe for her part seizes the sword from the body of the young man and launches forth on a tirade, addressing first the sword, then her lover whom she resolves to follow. Comparison with Ovid's monologue suggests a technique more calculated to appeal to the emotions, and it is possible that in elaborating some topics the French poet had in mind the requirements of the 'commiseratio' or 'conquestio', described in the Ad Herennium and the De Inventione.l Certainly these monologues, with the earlier ones in soliloquy, which hint at a movement of thought and the workings of the moral conscience, imply at least an elementary knowledge of rhetoric. The fact that the lovers are made so thoroughly articulate points, of course, to grammar, 'the science of speaking and writing correctly'.2 It is, we are told by John of Salisbury, the foundation of all knowledge and of all ethical development, and reposes ultimately on the exercise of man's natural birthright: Loqui autem est articulata et literata voce suum interpretari intellectum. Nam quod dicitur: nutu signisque loquuntur, a sermonis proprietate recedit.3 In this study a knowledge of figures is essential, and John recommends these rules to his contemporaries on the authority of a long line of medieval grammarians. In this whole passage he is himself obviously thinking of Quintilian, and he names him as the supreme authority.4 We should see then in the repetitions, exclamations and questions of the monologues the effort of the poet to reproduce the spontaneity of passion, and to give intensity and vehemence and conviction to the discourse. Not all the figures of which he had learnt the theory in Latin could lend themselves to use in the vernacular, which in the preceding centuries had achieved its own basic structure. Nor should we forget in this connexion that the study of words 1 E.g. Cicero, De Inv. i, lv. 2 John of Salisbury, Metalogicon, i, 13 (ed. Webb, p. 31), written in 1159. 3 Ibid. i, 18 (p. 44). 4 Ibid. i, 19 (p. 48).</page><page sequence="5">28 'Piramus et Tisbe' as a preliminary to the study of logic proper constituted a powerful factor in the development of the French language. The Categories, known for some time now through Porphyry and Boethius, was already beginning to be considered elemen- tary--'Longe miche alia mens est', said John, 'nec video quomodo sine isto quis magis possit esse logicus quam sine litteris litteratus'.l His discussions of 'equi- voca', 'univoca', 'denominativa', 'multivoca', and 'diversivoca' offer a new angle from which to view the use in Piramus, for instance, of whole families of words, and the variety of the poet's expression: Piramus est plains de tristour, Plains de souspir et plains de plour, Plains de penser et plains de cure. Demente soi en tel mesure Sovent: 'Las, cheitif, tristes et dolent, Soufferai longues cest tourment?...' Leaning on Ovid, the poet produces passages of objective narrative, of which the 'mesaventure' of the blood-stained mantle is a good example, a sequence such as the rhetorical 'narratio' prescribed. There you can see scholastic habits modifying a natural tendency to subjectivity, just as Tisbe's dream with its new function of motivation is still faintly premonitory, while the omens suggestive of the coming calamity tend to become a piece of decoration. In the outer structure of the poem the poet clings to the older manner of composition, and betrays a habit of mind out of harmony with the intellectual presentation of events and their causes. The symmetrical elaboration of scenes contributed to the general harmony of epic composition and often fulfilled a vital function of suspense. The plaint answering plaint of the Piramus gives no such dramatic tension, and symmetry has lost all meaning as a formal principle. The epic poet had at his disposal the refrain and a system of versification which lent themselves to emotional effects of crisis and dramatic suspense-instruments discarded by the remanieur; and so far, the loss of the ballad note with all it implied is without compensation in new methods of conducting a dramatic action. In one of his attempts to overcome the division of matiere and san, the allegorical conflict is the method he employs to lay bare the secret life of the lovers. They are represented as making a free choice, and their reason is of no avail against the dictates of love: Chascuns en soi meismes songe De bien emprendre sa besonge. Or sont li cuer en esperance, Et nonpourquant sont en balance De co qu'il le facent ou non, Mes volantez oste raison.... I1 ont andui joie et dolour, Mes toutes ores vaint Amour; Sens ne raison nes puet retraire De ce qu'il ont empris a faire. This is not deliberation by rhetorical monologue, but the poet's objective descrip- tion of the workings of the inner life of two fully conscious beings. He has thus found a way of depicting this movement without that dualism of subjective and objective which the plaints make in combination with the objective narrative 1 Metalogicon, iii, 3 (p. 128).</page><page sequence="6">THELT,EN C. R. LAURIE 29 taken over from Ovid. He turns resolutely towards a new kind of art, and he has made a tentative step, perhaps the first in modern literature, in the direction of portrayal of character not in action but in thought and speech. Like the Tristan poet, he would tell of a great love, but for all his amplifications and protestations he does not succeed in moving us as does the stark simplicity of the primitive poet. Love is the great ruling force in the Piramus, but the events which prevent the lovers from attaining perfect happiness are purely external, and love is not a tragic thing in itself, however pitiful the consequences may be in this case. Love is a torment but that is because the lovers are separated. The fact is that the psychology of passion, as a matter of direct immediate experience, comes into narrative literature with the poems refashioned from Ovid. To the new school of poets the passion of love and the problems it raised offered a field for speculation, and they set to work in a much more scientific way than did the earlier humanists, Hildebert, Marbod and Baudri, whose Ovidian imitations we have. 'To fall in love', 'to be in love', are ideas so familiar to us that we might be inclined to think that to describe them was a simple matter. In the 'chria' the poet had a means of explaining immaterial facts which he had imagined or found in his experience: but before trying to explain them he must give them form, and it was in Ovid that he found articulate expression of an experience which he was able to assimilate. The particular passage occurs in one of the Heroides: Ipsa quoque incalui, qualemque audire solebam, Nescioquem sensi corde tepente deum. Fugerat ore color; macies adduxerat artus; Sumebant minimos ora coacta cibos; Nec somni faciles et nox erat annua nobis, Et gemitum nullo laesa dolore dabam. (xi, 25-30) Now the lover (a woman incidentally) adds Nec cur haec facerem poteram mihi reddere causam. (31) The medieval poet is better placed. With the help of his scientific learning he can identify sensation, the cause in a God of Love, the physical symptoms and a kind of wound; and now he satisfies his impulse to understand with the anthropomorphic Amor, the Power behind the facts as agent, the dart as instrument, bringing about sensation in the individual; and he completes his picture with two other elements, imagination and fruition-a scientific analysis of the passions based on ideas such as might be found in Chalcidius' commentary on the Timaeus of Plato, in common use at the time. It looks very much too as if the poet knew the Physica of Aristotle, at least the first and second books, where he discusses the number and character of the first principles, the conditions of change, and the sense in which necessity is present in natural things. Amor's operation is effected by means of the dart, which is of a certain kind-just as the operation of sawing is defined as a certain kind of dividing, which cannot come about unless the saw has teeth of a certain kind; and these cannot be unless it is of iron.1 After the definition comes the demonstration, and it is instructive to watch how the poet handles Ovid's 'primos gradus": gradus': Aingois qu'il eussent set ans Toucha Amours les deus enfans Et navra plus a eel endroit Que lor aez ne requeroit. (13-16) 1 Physica, ii, 9.</page><page sequence="7">'Piramus et Tisbe' It is entirely innocent: Tant con lor aez fu contraire A ce qu'Amours requiert a faire Et il furent dedens dis ans Fu assez lor licence grans D'aler ensamble et de parler, D'esbanoier et de joer. (71-6) First the children are separated by Tisbe's mother, who sees a danger in their playing together; then the fathers' quarrel prevents the consummation of their love in marriage.1 There is a change in the medieval poem which one must believe was intentional. Ovid had later shown the lovers exchanging nods and signs, and added: Quoque magis tegitur, tectus magis aestuat ignis. The verb he emphasizes is brought in now in Piramus, to mean the seclusion of the lovers themselves, with the same effects: Mes ce que l'en les garde plus, Que Tisb6 n'ose issir de l'us Ne Piramus vers li garder, Fet lor amour plus aviver. Their love 'upgroweth with their age': Croist lor amour, croist lor aez Et ja orent quinze ans passez; now they are fully conscious: Et des qu'il vinrent en jouvent Et il choisirent escient Et lor aez s'aert el cours Ou nature conceit amours Lores nes lesse plus garir. Separation means grief and pain: Si pussons joindre compaignie De grant doleur eiisse aie. It is this naturalism of pain and pleasure, sickness and health, that underlies the plaints. The poet's approach in general reminds one of a doctor, or the physicist with an interest in medicine to whom Aristotle sometimes refers. In his description of the process which the fire of love sets up in Piramus and Tisbe as matter he is using the best scientific knowledge available, and his language has a technical flavour: Plorent, giement chascuns en soi, Ne sevent d'aus deus nul conroi, Ne ne pueent trouver remire Ne par mecine ne par mire. Li feux est la dedans enclos Qui ne lor leisse avoir repos, Ainz les travaille jor et nuit Et de mortel ardor les cuit. Cil feux et cele flame sole Retrait les ners et art la mole, Tault la vertu, change biaut6 Et chace tote aliegret6. (133-44) 1 Cf. Physica, 11, 8, 199a: 'Further where a series has a completion all the preceding steps are for the sake of that. Now surely as in intelligent action, so in nature; and as in nature, so it is in each action if nothing interferes....' 30</page><page sequence="8">HELETFN C. R. LAURIE 31 The theory is from Aristotle,1 but the way it is applied suggests that it has already been utilized in the field of medicine. Plant life too offers Piramus material for comparison: Amour la nom? Mes est ardour, Qui einsi vient de jour en jour. Fletrist ma face et ma coulour, Com fait gelee tenre flour. The active qualities 'hot' and 'cold' when in excess have this destructive effect.2 Then, as 'cupiditas', love affects the imagination, which brings us into the field of psychology proper. of psych y . Or aproce le terme brief Que lor amours trairont a chief! Ja li est vis que soit o lui, Que s'entrebaisent ambedui Et parolent de lor amour. He ventures into the domain of the subconscious with Tisbe's description of her dreams: La nuit, Quant je me gis dedenz mon lit Dont cuit que somme m'est delit, Par foi, Einz sui en peine et en effroi: Dont m'est a vis que je vos voi Et que poez touchier a moi. This sense-impression causes a movement: Tressail, Tressu d'angoisse et de travail; she is deceived into action on waking: Dont tent les mains que je vos bail, Et quant vos doi prendre, si fail. The poet is thinking, I imagine, of the experience of Ovid's Narcissus, and he has studied that experience in the light of Aristotle's work on dreams.3 Thus far we are concerned mainly with the senses, and indeed the poet's naturalistic approach emphasizes the helplessness of the lovers in the grip of passion. They are as trapped 1 'Cuit' refers to the process of concoction described in the fourth book of the Meteorology; cf. 379b 13: 'Concoction is due to heat: its species are ripening, boiling, broiling.' In a youthful elegy Ovid analyses the nature of Amor's arrows in this way: Non possunt, licet ipse velis, cessare sagittae: Fervida vicino flamma vapore nocet. (Amores, I, ii, 45-6) Also in Meteorology, iv Aristotle describes the effect of heat on homogeneous bodies, sinew 386b 14, 388a 17; marrow 389b 9. 2 Cf. Meteorol. iv, 381 a 23 on 'broiling'-' Hence if a man were to boil a thing but the change and concoction in it were due not to the heat of the liquid but to that of the fire, the thing will have been broiled and not boiled when the process has been carried to completion: if the process has gone too far we use the word "scorched" to describe it.' These are artificial processes, Aristotle says, but the same kind of thing is found in nature. 3 Metamorphoses, III, 432-5: Credule, quid frustra simulacra fugacia captas? Quod petis est nusquam; quod amas, avertere, perdes! Ista repercussae, quam cernis, imaginis umbra est: Nil habet ista sui; Aristotle, De Somno et Vigilia, 456a 24; De Somniis, 460b, 461a 15 and De Divinatione per Somnum, 461b 8.</page><page sequence="9">'Piramus et Tisbe' animals, they are subjected by force to the 'loi' of the God of Love, who is also thought of as a fisher, with a hook. The sexual impulse is the stronger in the girl, as in the 'jeunes filles' of popular lyric and romance, but Tisbe is a rational animal, and in the first monologue her personality seems to break apart as her love and her reason oppose each other. An analogy was sought in Medea's divided will. The difference is that Medea's 'self' is always the reasonable one, passion is an unnatural state, while Tisbe seems never to be more 'herself' than when she gives lyrical expression to her desire. There is no question of the medieval poet having misunderstood Ovid. He starts from Ovid's Ex aequo captis ardebant mcntibus ambo- the head and the heart are at variance, and in the heart Amor reigns triumphant, as Ovid himself made the discovery in his elegy.1 Piramus is his prey, just as Ovid was, but the idea of a surrender to the God of Love is not yet developed. For Medea, deliberation ends with the flight of love, a solution which Piramus contemplates for a moment, only to reject it as impossible. The key to the medieval version lies in the fact that the poet, even when he is dealing with matter, never loses sight of the end, 'that for the sake of which', health or fruition, which is in itself a good. Hope Piramus finds not in dispute but in prayer. He thinks of a cure as coming from the God of Love, from the beloved herself. We hear too of a temple of Venus, her aid is invoked to keep secret the chink, and Tisbe addresses with the same attitude and in almost the same breath the God of Love and the God of the real religion. It is a curious mixture of pagan and Christian ideas, of fiction and reality. GLASGOW HELEN C. R.
