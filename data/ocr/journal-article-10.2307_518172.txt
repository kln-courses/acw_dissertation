Many articles concern methodological questions within the fields of general linguistics and literary theory. The majority of the contributions, however, investigate specific linguistic problems or deal with specific literary texts. The journal thus covers a wide and diversified field in its attempt to mirror the problems that concern today's researchers in the fields of English, German and Romance studies.
