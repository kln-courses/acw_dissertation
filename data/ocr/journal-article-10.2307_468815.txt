<plain_text><page sequence="1">Psychoanalysis Unbound William Kerrigan W ERE I to heed the letter of Andre Green's injunction that only analysts or analysands should practice psychoanalytic crit- icism, I would have to disbar myself from this endeavor. Still, for somewhat different reasons, I share the dismay behind his pious wish. The current spate of literary psychoanalysis, whether harnessed to the old warhorse among Freud trots, Otto Fenichel, or to the frisky, Freud-liberated ego psychologies of Kohut, Kernberg, Schafer, and Lichtenstein, or to the dauntless anti-ego psychology of the dark-winged Lacan, is largely a criticism of application. The critic comes to his explanatory principles as finished laws to be deployed in elucidating the unfinished business of literature's open questions. Impatient with the density of details, he quickly establishes generali- zations that preinterpret all conceivable evidence. It is not a question of rigid application, but of a defect in application itself: psychoanalysis is conquering everything without being improved in the process. Triv- iality may be defined as the production of the expressly entailed, and much of this criticism, aiming at the universal application of ideas that already contain the assertion of their universal applicability, ulti- mately does not matter. When the critic writes in a dispassionate tone, as he often does in this field, one wonders how, aside from the mas- tery they impart, these ideas matter to him. I miss the sense of a psychoanalysis lived through, its lessons struggled with, its concepts deeply articulated with one another and in the process of being faced with everything else the critic knows-an open psychoanalysis, in short, aware of mysteries within and without its domain. Unfortu- nately, in my view, the school of Bloom is not represented in this issue, for he alone among the contemporary practitioners of psychoanalytic criticism in English seems to have generated an authentic reciprocity between disciplines, rethinking psychoanalysis while he deepens our understanding of specifically literary issues. On occasion the man mystifies, even infuriates, but I foresee a time when the concept of defense in psychoanalysis proper will have been transformed by his typology of troping. To do work of this kind, making psychoanalysis and literature il- luminate each other, one must derive from psychoanalytic texts, not just theory, but theoretical questions, and one must engage these CopyrightÂ© 1980 by New Literary History, The University of Virginia</page><page sequence="2">NEW LITERARY HISTORY questions in life, literature, and learning generally. We all know that criticism may have values that survive the imperfect and refutable theories it seeks to exemplify; Frye, to use the familiar example, re- mains enlightening despite the rickety anthropology and homemade Jungianism underwriting his seasonal cycle of literary forms. But it is a lazy sophistry, the intellectual equivalent of a shrug, to claim that his permanent achievement could not have occurred apart from his vul- nerable theory. How much better Frye would be if he were better able to interpret the meaning of his own work! In this spirit, I will assess the supposed advances in psychoanalytic theory announced by Wolf, Schafer, and Muller, then return briefly to what seems to me the strongest essay in this issue, Andre Green's "The Unbinding Process." I am not concerned with whether or how the theory of literary in- terpretation can absorb the psychoanalytic reading. I am interested in the prior question of a truthful psychoanalysis, this truthfulness being the only reason that the problematic of literary psychoanalysis de- serves to be worried. According to his hagiographer, the seer of Chicago has inaugu- rated the third age of psychoanalysis, transcending the ego psychol- ogy that transcended id psychology, by his shift "away from giving primary attention to parts ... toward attempting to grasp the totality of a whole person." Since the early formation of this wholeness through relationship to self-objects, and the drive to maintain this wholeness through love and work, together constitute the entire scope of Kohut's psychology of the self, it is remarkable that neither he nor his followers have given attention, primary or otherwise, to the sort of wholeness His Majesty the Self may be said to possess. In The Analysis of the Self Kohut distinguished the narcissistic configuration of the "idealized parental imago," which the child feels "part of," from the "grandiose self," which treats the self-object as "part of" its own en- compassing totality-the self as object, the object as self. The self realized in psychic development attains its wholeness by disavowing the idealized and the grandiose, integrating the early configurations into a "realistic self-esteem." One of the reviewers, Hans Loewald, noted that Kohut had succumbed to the "by now common equation of self and self-representation": the self Kohut analyzes is preeminently "a content or structure within the mind."1 As poles of the primitive body-ego, both of his narcissistic configurations imply a conception of unity appropriate to a body in space-a composition of parts, capable of being disjoined or "fragmented." But to whom are these images represented? One assumes that the wholeness of the self and the wholeness of the self-object come into being coincidentally. The syn- thesis of these emergent wholenesses must be performed by a subject who, unable to be an object or a representation, is neither of these 200</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOANALYSIS UNBOUND wholenesses, yet a wholeness nonetheless. The unity of this subject cannot be reduced to the represented image of itself except by its own error. Psychoanalytic theory must not, in the name of empathy, repeat this error. "The unity convertible with being," Aquinas proposed, "does not add anything to being.'2 Every psychology tries to articulate the sim- plicity that people, like all things that are, enjoy. Kohut instructs us by showing how the genesis of the ego involves a mistaken and fateful equation between the unity of a represented image and the threatened persistence of its unrepresentable representer, but he spreads confusion by assuming that this false wholeness remains throughout life the selfhood we have or seek. Kierkegaard, the great prophet of the self, divulged a more complex unity-the unity of a task undertaken, a self "relating itself to its own self and ... willing to be itself."3 As articulated by Heidegger, this self discovers the relation to itself, and thus its unity, in answering the call of conscience. Its wholeness is temporal through and through; its essence lies in voli- tion's grasp on possibility. What has this self to do with Kohut's nar- cissism? Much-but it has to do with more. By attempting to explain the cultural life of a mature person in terms of the primitive repre- sentation of a unified self, Kohut obscures the transformation of wholeness accomplished by the Oedipus complex. The complex does not simply "whittle down" or, as it were, lessen the degree of narcis- sistic esteem. There is a change in kind in the felt structure of self- hood, producing a unity unique to human existence, for which mathematics and linguistics offer no models. We speak of it by mak- ing metaphors of other unities. The boy is simpler. His desire for unrivaled possession of his mother bespeaks his victory over the narcissistic position, in that the mother is sufficiently separate to be united with and sufficiently ab- sent to be yearned for, yet bears a regressive component as well, in that this reunion continues the old themes of grandiosity and idealiza- tion. With respect to the regressive current of oedipal desire, the castration threat acquires a positive aspect: the father sanctions and completes the process of separation from the preoedipal mother; like a clarification, castration cuts at the lingering dependence joining self with self-object. It is a threat, moreover, precisely to the false image of integrity adored by the primitive ego-the self as a divisible body. Accepting this dismemberment, the boy gains a new "image" of self- hood under the eye of the superego, undertaking the active psychic task of creating himself in the image of the father. He regains the lost self-object as a true object in the new and futural dimension of hope. This is the genesis of Dasein-a finite self who must choose an un- chosen situation in order to free his possibilities, the last of which, 201</page><page sequence="4">NEW LITERARY HISTORY foretold by his castration, is death. The complex transforms the nar- cissistic order of "self as self-representation," the idolatry of re- flexivity, into a triangulated selfhood, investing mind with a second- order reflexivity of conscience addressed to the ego-as-will rather than to the ego-as-object. The self cannot realize its unity in an act of knowledge, for by virtue of that very act it is other than the unity known. We "know" the self, we lay hold of the self and direct the self, in the act of willing.4 Unity is lifetime now. Roy Schafer's theory of the narrated self seems immune to many of the confusions and superficialities bedeviling the psychology of Kohut. As agent or as narrator, the self is here a doer, creating itself in time. But the root problem with "action language" can also be traced to a naive conception of psychic unity. The theory emerges from a gradual disillusionment with Freudian metapsychology, especially the role of psychic energy, that has led Schafer from the excellent if conventional Aspects of Internalization (1968) to the radical break of A New Language for Psychoanalysis (1976). The psychic apparatus of Freud, a successor in the realm of science to the self-representations of the primitive ego, reifies mind. But in jet- tisoning this "realism" of the unconscious, Schafer finds that he must still listen to the analysand with all the psychoanalytic expectations the old system intended to integrate-the primal scene, the feces as gift or weapon, the various postures of defense, and so on. It is impossible to see how Schafer's "action language," useful as it might be in the therapeutic work, could itself contribute to this body of explanatory principles: what we witness in Schafer is the absolute closure of psychoanalysis, an innovation that renders further innovation impos- sible. The analyst, we are told, listens for a "second reality" in the letter of the narrative. It is unnecessary to know anything in particular of the mental structures implied by this reality, since its meaning can be immediately inferred from the narrative: "Divorcing language from the concreteness of'the Unconscious' would be fatal to the psy- choanalytic enterprise." That enterprise is already near death, I sub- mit, when the unconscious cannot be written without embarrassed quotation marks. The second reality of the literal sense can only be second in relation to an ontological commitment. For all his appeal to the "rules" con- stituting narrative, to the primacy of "use" in determining the "lan- guage" appropriate to psychoanalysis, Schafer's is not the instrumen- talism of Wittgenstein. He clearly supposes that every narrator, how- ever much his illness may delude him, is a "unitary, fully responsible agent." Meissner wonders about metaphor used as such. I wonder about the true letter of metaphor, for the unitary agent supposed by "action language" is as reified as the mental apparatus this language 202</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOANALYSIS UNBOUND would supplant. Action language falsifies experience. The impulse does overwhelm me, the thought of you does slip away, ideas strike and passions ignite. Ricoeur has suggested that the ambiguous treatment of mental events in Freud's language of psychic energy-things be- having in a physical system and anthropomorphic entities capable of purpose-constitutes a "semantics of force" appropriate, first, to an attempt to conceive of the interface of instinct and mentation, and second, to the conscious experience of the "pressure" of desire.5 In the translation from "The passion overwhelmed me" to the "I de- sired" of action language, it is exactly this pressure that is lost. What- ever its merits as science, Freud's bivalent apparatus keeps in touch with an experiential acuity wholly obliterated in the new language of Schafer. A rudimentary phenomenology reveals to us that no ego experiences its agency as ubiquitous, that there are complex hierar- chical blendings of mineness and otherness felt by an ego-center during any segment of mental life. The "I" in "I walked across the room" is, if taken as the designation of a single unarticulated agent, mere idealization: I will my body to walk somewhere, which it then does, and meanwhile my thoughts about action language, the hardness of the floor, that twinge in my ankle, the urge to sing, an unwilled fantasy, my anticipation of the next room and the coffee I am seeking, are all arrayed about my ego-center in various "regions" of intention- ality. Because we-the responsible ones, holding audience in the court of consciousness-cohabit with the involuntary, many of Schafer's disclaimers in fact lay claim to the poetry of our experience. Action language reduces the unity of volition to a spurious homogeneity. We throw out the apparatus of Freud only to be whizzed through the Cuisinart of Schafer. Few Frenchmen would mount a theory such as this. One cannot but imagine-in action language, I am greatly amused by imagining- Foucault grinding his teeth over Schafer's work, thinking that here indeed is the self utterly devoted to the jealous Lord of Logos, drawn out from the few indeterminacies still permitted by ordinary language to be caught and exhibited as a "unitary, fully responsible agent": Yes it's wonderful but they ought to put it back into the sea where it came from. Blouaugh! Back, then, to the "Blouaugh!" of the apparatus. No one will accuse Lacan of presupposing a superficial unity of the 203</page><page sequence="6">NEW LITERARY HISTORY self, for he has no concept of the self aspiring to replace the concept of the ego, and the question of psychic unity is likely to send his mind to complex algebras and non-Euclidian geometries, a swirl of conceits not unlike his description of mourning in the essay Muller summa- rizes. Often exasperating as a theorist, Lacan exhilarates as a poet regularly able to suggest more than he can-or cares to-substantiate. In the essay at hand, for example, he delineates a brilliant congruence between the rituals of psychoanalysis and the rituals of anthropology: just as the funeral rite of the community ends with the disappearance of the corpse, so the regression of the individual mourner to the prelinguistic order of the Imaginary ends with the abandonment of the image of the absent one, the burial of the dead in language. If we must quarrel with this man, we must first be grateful for the liberal mind that bestows, so quickly, so many vital ideas. In his famous "Seminar on 'The Purloined Letter,"' Lacan pro- duced an extraordinary new model for psychoanalytic criticism by discovering, in the sense of the story itself, a rejection of the stance of an interpreter who, securely "outside" the text and wielding a system in relation to which the text is an illustration, makes inferences about the unconscious of the author. Poe's story rather becomes, as Shoshana Felman has said, "no less than an allegory of psychoanalysis" wherein Dupin occupies the position of both the poet and the analyst: the interpreter is in the story, simultaneously the thief of the letter and the proper recipient of the letter, since to whom but the analyst is the letter of repression addressed?6 Writing on a far greater work of art, however, Lacan reverts to a semblance of the old content-oriented psychoanalysis of literature. Hamlet occasions a summary of preoedi- pal desire-applied Lacan. Furthermore, as everyone will notice long before they arrive at the startling parenthesis in Muller's last para- graph, this reading of Hamlet is marked by a lordly and deliberate imitation of a parapraxis. It is what you say about Hamlet when you have forgotten the point. Lacan enters the play through the mourning of the hero rather than the oedipal injunctions of his father's ghost. The preoedipal child constitutes himself as everything his mother desires and, without him, would lack; since this relationship comes in time to be the phallus of the Oedipus complex-wanting in the mother, desiring in the boy-Lacan refers to it as the imaginary phallus. Bear in mind: "phallus" in Lacan means "the period of narcissism," the spectral life of the preoedipal ego; and the castrating father is understood, not so much as a powerful phallus, as the rules of language encoding the laws of social order, the first and specifically oedipal one being the law of exogamy. The child mourns the phallus at the waning of the com- plex. Every subsequent loss reactivates this primordial loss (in other 204</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOANALYSIS UNBOUND psychoanalytic vocabularies, the loss attendant upon ego differentia- tion), requiring of the mourner a self-castration, a sacrifice of wish reenacting the entire sequence of losses by which the ego comes to be. In Hamlet, Lacan argues, this process stands in conflict with the business of killing Claudius. From the ghost he inherits the role of avenger, becoming an agent of the superego; he must strike at the imaginary phallus. But what is that phallus, Claudius as everything his mother desires, doing in the position once occupied by his father? Where there should be law, there is a phallus, trespassing. Unable to fathom this reversal of the complex-himself as superego, castrator, and deliverer of the law to his father as imaginary phallus-Hamlet proceeds psychotically with the work of mourning, turning against the dependent Ophelia and other symbols of his own narcissism. The argument seems absurd, pure Lacanian formalism. On the crucial matter of the delay, why is the spirit of Hamlet "astounded" to find the imaginary phallus in the position once occupied by his father? It would seem to me that, when the child relinquishes his imaginary phallus, he concedes that the father, not himself, consti- tutes the mother's desire-that the father is, in this sense, the imagi- nary phallus. Again, if the new King is the imaginary phallus, why don't the imperatives born of the loss (to mourn, to castrate) and return (to revenge, to castrate) of the father dovetail in the murder of Claudius? The delay makes no sense to me, nor apparently to Muller, without the identification of the repressed oedipal desire of Hamlet with the real crime of Claudius, "(although Lacan does not state it)" (my italics). This refusal links Lacan to the psychoanalytic heroes of America. "Contrary to Freud," Schafer writes, "the tale of an Ego Ideal or Superego measuring the ego, judging it, and shaming or punishing it, as though it were another forceful person or another person's forceful will-this tale need not be told by a psychoanalyst in his or her theoretical formulations." Lacan, too, will not tell us all this tale. Why? How to account for such a lacuna, the absence of the full story of narcissistic injury, except as a strategy of narcissistic defense? Is Lacan, like Schafer, being Contrary to Freud? Those familiar with the polemics deeply woven into the work of Lacan may remember that Hamlet, an English play, is a territory of literary psychoanalysis ruled by Ernest Jones, the Englishman Freud designated as his heir. In the darkest toils of this essay, I sense, Lacan is staging a revenge play in the theater of psychoanalytic thought, willfully displacing a chain of signifiers that moves from Hamlet and Claudius to Jones to Anna Freud of Hampstead, the International Psycho-Analytical Congress, and the famous wound Lacan suffered in 1953: perhaps Claudius is doubly the signifier of the desire of the Other. Andre Green informs us that literature is in hiding today, effacing 205</page><page sequence="8">NEW LITERARY HISTORY representational narrative partly because psychoanalysts (real ones or critics) stand watch in its audience. Influential modern writers have sought to "unbind" the old unity of image and thought; both halves devolve toward psychosis. Ours is the age of hyper-display and hyper-theory. I have repeatedly asked myself, in preparing this com- mentary, whether the same trend can be discerned in the language of psychoanalysis. Kohut's narcissist is almost all image or self- representation; the analyst has scarcely thematized a thinking subject. Schafer makes psychoanalysis into the interpretation of narrative, but he shatters the representation of the mind to which this interpretation has always been referred; shorn of a conscience that calls or observes, spread evenly across a mental plane where images never appear or disappear of themselves, his unitary agent seems almost all thought, forever denying the spontaneous combustion of fantasy for the sake of perfecting his responsibility. Lacan, surely the superior theorist of the three, makes psychoanalysis, philosophy, linguistics, anthropol- ogy, and literary criticism into an oddly fractured poem, driven by great waves of contempt, whose fundamental rule is to separate its sense as far as possible from common sense. It is not the discourse of someone who simply wants to be understood. From his phallus of narcissism comes a Hamlet for our age, in which the psychotic hero, hyper-displaying and hyper-theorizing, really desires his mother as early mother, not as libidinal object.
