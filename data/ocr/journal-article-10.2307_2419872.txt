<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 231 HEREDITY AND PARENTHOOD. Samuel C. Schmucker. The MacMillan Company. $2.50. Chautauquaesque; an example of how popularizing a sub- ject may lead to superficiality of treatment. The work is anthropomorphic at times, inaccurate at others, and if the largely irrevelant material were omitted, the more valuable information could be condensed to a book half of its size. Why do not present day popularizers take a lesson from Huxley?-N. M. Grier.</page></plain_text>
