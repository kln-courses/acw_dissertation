<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Paul H. Fry. Wordsworth and the Poetry of What We Are. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2008. Pp. 240. $55.00. Some books, especially maiden speeches, proceed from a thesis statement, and approach their materials zealously. At their most dogged, or program matically theoretical, they bludgeon the reader so that by a certain point he can predict what they will have to say when they lay the matters of their analysis reductively upon a Procrustean bed. Other books work deftly and with nuance, refining arguments and looking more at the trees than the forest. It takes the patience, subtlety, and wisdom that come from long ex perience to write a book that begins with a simple, though far from obvi ous, point and then expands upon it with graceful, organic attentiveness. This sort of book proceeds along a path that is far from straight or obvious but reaches a satisfying destination not in spite, but because, of its wander ings by the way. Such a book is Paul Fry's Wordsworth and the Poetry Of What We Are. It is the work of someone who has been thinking, long and hard, about his . sub ject for many years. (In the name of full disclosure I should add that we were nursed upon the selfsame hill, and fed the same flocks, decades back, in graduate school.) Like his colleague David Bromwich's Disowned By Memory (1998), it is a distillation of complicated thoughts and a heuristic reading of the poet's oeuvre. Fry's thesis is that everyone, from Keats and Hazlitt, through Irving Babbitt, and up to the Yale critics, has made the primal mistake of accept ing Wordsworth as an egocentric, or even humanistic poet. In fact, accord ing to Fry, he is not a radically subjective poet. Instead, he belongs to "the monist empirical tradition that passes from Locke through David Hartley" (xi), and Fry stresses "monist" as much as "empirical" in his assessment. The reason? We have underestimated the role of the nonhuman in his po etry and, as a consequence, have misrepresented or overvalued the vision ary and epistemological give-and-take that most critics of the Abrams and Hartman school locate at the heart of his world view. For Wordsworth, Fry says with a slight rhetorical stretching of the diction, it's the what not the who we are that makes the difference. Or rather, in cosmic terms, the non-difference between us and the rest of the world. For Wordsworth, equality is a cosmic, ontological principle SiR, 49 (Spring 2010) 169</page><page sequence="2">170 BOOK REVIEWS more than a political one, and his "poetry discloses the unity constituted by and as the being, apart from meaning and apart even from difference, of all human and nonhuman things" (9). Far from exemplifying the egotistical sublime, Wordsworth's poetry "is an almost monastic discipline aimed at ef facing the ego" (201). Fry developed in his earlier work the idea that lyric poetry in its ontological (or, in his word, "ontic") status has an undeter mined or underdetermined significance, and that it really abjures "mean ing" tout simple. Proceeding from this idea, the analyses in the new book of both individual poems and of Wordsworth's overall cultural significance al low us to limn the poet as neither green (a "nature" poet in the under standing of earlier critics, an "ecological" one in the understanding of Jona than Bate) nor "red" (according to his political readers) but, quite simply, "gray." So Wordsworth's true radicalism comes from his looking at the "ordi nary" in nature (shades of Stanley Cavell here) and at the marginal (in terms of human beings), but not reading nature as a book. In fact, Fry comes curiously close to Angus Fletcher (whom he does not cite), who has recently proposed a new "horizontal" view of poetry, exemplified by Clare, Whitman, and Ashbery, to replace an older, "vertical" or transcen dental view. In spite of his professions that nature can be your teacher, Wordsworth in Fry's view is not really the supreme poet who believes that nature can communicate ethical lessons. Nature is always indifferent, and if we wish to read it as a book, we do so because, like Francis Jeffrey, we have humanist or Deist preconceptions that govern our compulsion to project human qualities upon it, in either its organic or inorganic parts: Fry judiciously suggests that there is a reason for the two-to-one split in the "rocks and stones and trees" of "A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal." Namely, the inorganic always wins out over the organic. Wordsworth was not an anthropomorphic poet or an Enlightenment thinker, no matter how much Geoffrey Hartman wishes him to be. This attitude goes against virtually the entire tradition of Wordsworthian criticism of the past two centuries, but Fry manages to do his job deftly and persuasively. For one thing, he knows all the critical positions and ac knowledges them, often deferentially, even when disagreeing with them. For another, his treatment of the poetry opens us up to new readings, at the micro levels of diction, imagery, and sound, as well as the larger level of trope and theme, which seem both startling and, once you think of them, true. Thus "lightened" in "Tintern Abbey" suggests illumination as well as a release from a burden. "Composed" in the title of the Westminster Bridge sonnet has a double sense. Fry cites and then expands upon the way William Empson put Strunk and White's manual on style in its place, de cades ago, when he observed how Wordsworth took a site of "indiscrimi</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 171 nate joy" in the 1805 Prelude (the poet's recollection of dancing until dawn and then feeling committed to his artistic vocation) and turned it?to his poetic disadvantage?into "an intelligible symbol" (78) by eliminating verbs of being. Fry attends to linguistic nuance with a New Critical sensi tivity. And he shows an equivalent alertness to the importance as well as the msignificance of rhythm in his excellent discussion of Wordsworth as prosodist and prosodie theorist: "meter makes no sense but carries the bur den of sense" (107). The two central chapters, on The Prelude and The Excursion, especially the latter, offer radical assessments of the poet's major long works. Al though he charmingly allows that Wordsworth would not approve of his views of The Excursion, Fry does some startling things with it. He makes new discriminations among the four characters. He reminds us that the Wanderer has no human attachments, and calls the Poet the poem's "figure of unself-consciousness" (157), the one who has never actually had a vi sion. He is the one who expresses Wordsworth's views about "the com munity of human and inhuman things" (148), and, like the Pastor, he speaks "the language of things hidden or obliquely present" (162). The Wanderer, on the other hand, is the only transcendentalist among the four, using the language of the Immortality Ode. In order, after an introduction, the book's chapters are "Wordsworth in the Rime" ("The Ancient Mariner" as a reading of Wordsworth); "Jeffreyism, Byron's Wordsworth, and the Nonhuman in Nature"; "Green to the Very Door? The Natural Wordsworth"; "The Novelty of Words worth's Earliest Poems"; "Hoof After Hoof, Metric Time" ("To perceive the unity of things qua things requires the power of non-cognitive feeling . . . [associated] with meter"; "The Poem to Coleridge"; "The Pastor's Wife and the Wanderer: Spousal Verse or the Mind's Excursive Power"; and "Intimations Revisited: From the Crisis Lyrics to Wordsworth in 1817." A reviewer writing with praise can be forgiven an inevitable cavil or two. I shall limit myself to Fry's ingenious discussion of "Tintern Abbey," interwoven throughout his pages. He does himself and his poet a disservice by misquoting, thrice, the famous lines about "the mighty world / Of eye and ear,?both what they half create, / And what perceive" and makes it into "half create and half perceive." Wordsworth clearly does not want to give equal weight to both parties in this "ennobling interchange" (his phrase from The Prelude). Passive perception always precedes and out weighs imaginative creation. In a book devoted to the unity of the human and nonhuman world, one might have expected a word or two about Wordsworth's indebtedness to Lucretius and his atomic theories (a subject about which I wrote an article decades back), especially because De Rerum</page><page sequence="4">172 BOOK REVIEWS Natura may constitute one kind of origin for the "thingness" in so much of Wordsworth's poetry. "The shadow of [the] Danish boy" is "a thing." Lucy becomes "a thing." And so on. Mental transactions are complex. When "We see into the life of things" (in "Tintern Abbey") we perform an epistemological discovery, as all of Wordsworth's earlier readers have acknowledged. But we also make a tacit acknowledgment that we have performed an act of se//^knowledge. The poem gives additional cause for such an interpretation: right before the lines above Wordsworth refers memorably to "A motion and a spirit that impels / All thinking things, all objects of all thought / And rolls through all things." One word makes the whole world kin. Fry doesn't do enough with this important passage, which neatly encapsulates Wordsworth's de piction of the relationship between human and nonhuman as well as be tween thinkers and their thoughts. Likewise, Fry's sense of the unity ex plicit in "Tintern Abbey" and elsewhere ("green to the very door," etc.) would certainly gain from a mention of what has always struck me as one of Wordsworth's most idiosyncratic and, therefore, paradoxically, typical passages. In the first paragraph of the loco-descriptive poem, he writes that the "steep and lofty cliffs" "impress / Thoughts of more deep seclusion" "on a wild secluded scene" (my emphasis). Another surprise confronts the reader. Surely, thoughts of or in a scene should be "impressed," in a Locke an manner, upon a working human brain. In some kind of misplaced meta phor, or catachresis, Wordsworth suggests the unity of scene and thinker: he gives Fry's thesis an added boost. These small criticisms do little, however, to detract from my admiration of this enlightening summa. Wordsworth studies, and our sense of Words worth himself, will never be quite the same.
