<plain_text><page sequence="1">Spring 1982 725 Comment on Haraway's "In the Beginning Was the Word: The Genesis of Biological Theory" Ruth Bleier I am grateful to Donna Haraway for her critical attention to the writings of some feminist scientists, including mine (Signs 6, no. 3 [Spring 1981]: 469-81). As we who are working scientists raise issues about science and its methodologies, we are bound to confront critical philosophical and historical questions which can only benefit from dialogue with philosopher-historians like Haraway, Elizabeth Fee, and other feminist theoreticians working in other disciplines. I agree that my article con- tains contradictions concerning the nature and use of scientific "evi- dence" that I did not then address. It is not the same article I would write today, three years later. In this commentary, rather than contradict Haraway, I should like to acknowledge and respond to some of the problems that she raises-with, however, one small exception. In my discussion of the traditional use of the term "harem" to describe single- male troops of primates, I cited the observations of Jane Lancaster as contradicting that anthropomorphic assumption about the social re- lationships within such a troop. Whether or not that indicates my accep- tance of a feminist interpretation as "real science," as Haraway suggests, I do believe that there is a qualitative difference between primate studies that impute particular relationships to primates because they look like humans (though a bit hairier) and studies that attempt to perceive what the relationships may be by actually observing interactions among indi- viduals in the troop. Of course, the latter type of studies also have been and will continue to be influenced, perhaps to an immeasurable degree, by what the observer is able (i.e., prefers) to see and not see and how she or he interprets the observations. Haraway makes an important point when she describes a contradic- tion in feminist theory: In attacking the science of biological de- terminists, some of us use other "scientific" observations, but how or why are these more valid? The problem is particularly difficult if at the same time we assert the essential subjectivity of all knowledge, including sci- ence, admitting that the realities we attempt to describe, measure, or interpret are circumscribed by our abilities to perceive them and that those perceptive abilities are limited not only technically but con- ceptually and ideologically. While we recognize that in science, as in any other field, all "knowledge," "evidence," "data," "observations," "facts," "truths" are products of the perceptions, judgments, opinions, methodologies, and language of those who describe them, they are, nonetheless, all that we have as the material objects of our discourse; they are our subject matter when we attempt our deconstructions and Signs</page><page sequence="2">726 Letters/Comments reconstructions of scientific theory. Beyond our language, perceptions, and constructions, things and relationships do exist, and our use of language and existing "knowledge" is the means we have to approach understanding. I wonder if, in this respect, Haraway can be considered to have a privileged (though admittedly no less difficult) position, since her subjects are the words and expressed ideas of the writers she examines rather than the "true nature" of the things they may claim to be signifying: she only (!) has to worry about what writers mean, think they mean, and intend to convey, and why they may do any of these. I think that a valid (feminist) science or epistemology recognizes the subjective-that is, perceived or constructed-nature of "reality." It is more interested in providing approaches that reveal the complexity and ever-changing nature of natural and social relationships than in seeking unicausal theories that attempt to cast some reality in concrete. With such purpose we continue to find new conceptual frameworks, fresh ways of looking at and exploring phenomena, of framing questions, of permitting new perceptions. One consequence, I believe, of the work of feminist scholars in the sciences has been to destroy absolutes and universals, which are simply constructs of ordered minds. What even now distinguishes feminist sci- ence and feminist approaches to knowledge is the very plurality of our voices that reflect the ever-changing nature of the realities we try to examine and of our perceptions of them. For example, as the work of anthropologists like Eleanor Leacock, Naomi Quinn, Michelle Rosaldo, Karen Sacks, Peggy Sanday, Janet Siskind, and others demonstrates, understanding the significance of kinship arrangements or gender re- lationships with respect to economic and political power requires a vari- ety of viewpoints and approaches, each of which permits a particular set of insights. Feminist anthropologists have challenged not only the cherished anthropological assumptions concerning the universality of male dominance and female subordinance but even the concepts them- selves of subordinance and dominance and of universals. Male domi- nance, like female subordinance, has not been unitary or universal. Taking a fresh look at these and other questions, feminist scholars ap- proach them from the point of view of their unique (and stated) interests and disciplines and thus produce different analyses: Their hypotheses can be seen not as competitive but rather as illuminating different facets of extraordinarily complex social phenomena. In marked contrast, today's sociobiologists of the E. O. Wilson school, like yesterday's biological determinists, speak with one voice; for them there is one word, one approach, one reality. They quote only each other and with reverence. Their conceptual framework is the one that has revealed Truth and Reality transcendent. But it is clear not only that such sociobiological theories are unsupportable even by traditional</page><page sequence="3">Spring 1982 727 criteria of scientific methodology, but also that to seek single causes or key explanations for anything, and in particular for social phenomena, is useless. Department of Neurophysiology and the Women's Studies Program University of Wisconsin-Madison Comment on Stetson's Review of The Black Women's Issue, Conditions: 5 Cherrie Moraga Possibly by virtue of the fact that Erlene Stetson is not a Third World Lesbian, she is not in a position to comprehend what a history of virtual dead silence may mean to the Lesbian of color who first lays eyes upon the pages of Conditions: 5 (see Erlene Stetson, review of The Black Women's Issue, coedited by Lorraine Bethel and Barbara Smith, Signs 6, no. 2 [Winter 1980]: 334-36). By calling this a "small beginning," Stetson leaves out of account the huge personal risk involved in overcoming political and material obstacles in order to put together in print feminism, Blackness, and Lesbianism. (Homophobia in Third World communities in the United States and racism in the women's movement are only two examples.) Few find the combination easily digestible. Stetson is no ex- ception. What she sees as "small" has given me and other Third World Lesbians a little more breathing room. And that's no small feat. The overall picture Stetson provides of The Black Women's Issue (which, incidentally, contains works by Lesbian and heterosexual women) is of the Lesbian as narcissistic, self- and sexually absorbed, naive, and diseased. Any strict Freudian analysis of homosexuality could have pro- vided the same details. Stetson refers to most of the works in the collec- tion as "speak-bitterness pieces," describing Black Lesbians' "rage, pain, fear, alienation, disaffection, dissatisfaction, and anger" as the elements of an "endless introspection [that] distorts." This condescending at- titude of "yes, yes, but when will they get beyond their anger" has been worked and reworked against "minority" writers by the hands of the oppressor/literary critic ever since the first brave soul who was not white or male or straight had the guts and the luck to get something in print. Further, the criticism of being too "introspective" is ironic in a women's publication; even the Great White Mothers of Western literature Dickinson, Woolf, et al.-have been accused of being too introspective I capitalize Black and Lesbian because these words-particularly in a mainstream literary/academic context where the discussion of Blacks and Lesbians is usually relegated to second-class status or is nonexistent-are not merely adjectives that modify but political statements of identity. signs</page></plain_text>
