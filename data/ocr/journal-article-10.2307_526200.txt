<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Classis Britannica Bath-house at Beauport Park, East Sussex By GERALD BRODRIBB and HENRY CLEERE THE HISTORY OF THE SITE N 1849 Mark Anthony Lower published a pioneer paper on the ironworks of East Sussex,' but this contained no mention of any ironworking at Beauport Park, near Battle. Ten years later, however, the Rev. S. Arnott, rector of the nearby parish of Hollington, wrote that, although there were no remains of early ironmaking in his parish, 'there is a large cinder-bank in Beauport Park on which grow firs with oak and ash, all planted by the owner, Sir Charles Lamb'.2 Not long after this report was published - and, indeed, possibly as a result of it - the local Highway Surveyor, James Byner, began to remove this cinder systematically for road- making, at a rate of some 2,000-3,000 cubic yards a year, according to Straker. The present track from Stonehouse down to the site (FIG. I) and the bridge over the stream were erected by Byner and do not figure on maps earlier than 1870. This was not Byner's first use of Roman iron slag for road-making in his district: before coming to Beauport Park he had already largely cleared the large heaps at Oaklands Park, Sedlescombe. Byner continued to remove slag from Beauport Park for about ten years, and it is fortunate that James Rock, a local antiquarian, was able to witness his work and to record it fully after a visit made in September I878.' He writes: 'The large mound at Beauport Park was, until opened as a quarry, a wooded knoll, with heavy timber upon it, presenting but little to indicate that it was the handiwork of man. It then covered a space of two acres or more, and at the highest part had an elevation of about 50 feet above the surrounding land. At the present time only one end of the knoll, which was originally of an oblong form, remains. It forms at one side a cliff about 30 feet high, and on the other a grassy slope with a few trees upon it. Seen from below the mound rises higher than the cliff by about io feet. The whole mass now remaining covers about a third of an acre, but as it rests upon the slope of the hill which rises behind it, the quantity of cinders contained in it is probably not as great as it appears. At the time of my visits, men were working very carefully on the face of the "cliff" which crumbled so readily at every stroke of the pick, that they had difficulty in keeping their footing. Occasionally a piece of pottery is found, but rolling down with the cinders is usually broken very small ere it reaches the bottom of the bank.' 'M.A. Lower, Sussex Arch.

Rock's account included a sketch made by his friend Edward Farncomb of Hollington, which represents the state of the cinder-heaps in September 1878 (PL. XIA). The dip in the ground to the left of the sketch would seem to be the line of the present stream, and the tree to the right may possibly show the early stages of the giant turkey oak which stood at the, edge of the bath-house until it was cut down in 1976. After ten years' work by Byner's men, according to Straker,6 'the cinder was exhausted [and] he is locally reputed to have bought and demolished several martello towers for roadmaking.' Although the minute books of the Hastings Highway District Council record the appointment of James Byner as Highway Supervisor in 1872, with regular reports on his excellent work, there is no reference to his taking of material from Beauport Park. Rock's account refers to the finding of several Roman coins, samian and other pottery, but the most interesting find from the Byner 'excavations' was a cast-iron statuette which Charles Dawson claimed that he had acquired from one of the workers on the cinder-heap in 1877.7 This statuette has subsequently been proved to have been a fake, and not of Roman origin, since the art of making cast-iron is not thought to have reached Europe, probably from China, until the Middle Ages. After Byner ceased work, the area reverted to its former heavily wooded state and the site might have been totally forgotten had Herbert Blackman not taken an interest in it. In 6 Straker, op. cit.

Although Blackman had no doubt that 'a great deal of slag still remains under the present site,' he was not moved to carry out an excavation himself. Sir Archibald Lamb showed him several fine specimens of pottery from his own collection at the house and Blackman went to visit Byner, now aged 8o, at his home in Sedlescombe, though he learned little about his work at Beauport Park. Several years later, in October 1924, Blackman again went to Beauport Park with Mr Grinstead, and a photograph in Wealden Iron8 shows them doing some light digging at the upper (south?) end of the gully. Blackman's manuscript notebooks, entitled Notes on Sussex Iron-works, vol ii (now in the library of the Sussex Archaeological Society in Lewes), give a detailed account of the layers present beneath the surface, but unfortunately do not contain a description of the site as a whole. Although he is said to have intended to make further visits, there is no record of these in his notes. Straker paid his only visit to Beauport Park in 1924. In 1927 the site was disturbed when a pipe was laid to bring water from the lake to the house (and this was found during the authors' excavations to be resting on the tops of the walls of the bath-house), but no one apparently recognized the importance of the masonry that must have been revealed by the activity. No further interest was shown in the site until September 1965 when one of the present authors (GB) first visited Beauport Park to look for what was shown on the Ordnance Survey maps as 'Romano-British ironworkings.' As a result of persistent exploration of a heavily overgrown area, aided by the use of divining rods, he identified the site of the bath-house on 30 December 1969. Earlier that year notice had been given that a golf-course was to be created at Beauport Park, one hole of which was to run along the west side of the gully. The chance discovery of the wooden 'tank' (see below) in October 1969 and the subsequent discovery of the bath-house led to a change of plans and, thanks to Mr Frank Pennink, the designer of the golf course, the Roman site was excluded from it. Following preliminary excavations in 1970, full-scale work began in 1971. In November 1971 Department of the Environment officials visited the bath-house and discussions began with the object of taking it into State care. A roof was erected above it, funded by the Beauport Park Excavation Committee, and the floors and walls were protected with sand at DoE expense. It is regrettable that subsequently the proposal for guardianship has been shelved; a study by East Sussex County Council at the initiative of the Planning Committee also came to naught, owing to the heavy financial implications. Since that time the site has been maintained by the authors, who have also carried out minor excavations around the original site to solve specific problems of interpretation. The long-term future of one of the best preserved Roman buildings in Britain remains uncertain, however, as this report is being prepared at the end of 1986. THE LOCATION OF THE SITE A high ridgeway runs inland in a north-westerly direction from the cliffs beyond Hastings, reaching its highest point of 140 m at the end of a 9-25 km stretch (the modern B2o93 and A2IOo roads) between Ore and Battle (see FIG. I). To the north of this high point and Ioo m below it, about I km down the steep slope, lies the Beauport Park ironworking site. It is in ' Straker, op. cit. (note 3), 337.</page><page sequence="4">220 GERALD BRODRIBB AND HENRY CLEERE heavily wooded country, denser than most parks, and has been subject to little, if any, cultivation in historical times. On a line drawn at right-angles to the ridgeway the nearest point to the sea was 5 km away, reached by travelling I km up the slope to the ridge, and then a further 4 km to the south down to what was once a haven, though the sea has subsequently receded a further 2*5 km. On the route to this putative harbour lies the site of another Romano-British ironworks at Crowhurst Park,9 some 2-24 km from the Beauport Park site. This seems to provide the most likely access to the sea, though there is as yet no evidence of a track in the Roman period. However, as one of the present authors has pointed out,10 the transit of iron from the Wealden ironworks in the Roman period may well have been via small ports on the rivers flowing from the High Weald into what is now Romney Marsh; so it is more likely that the Beauport Park site communicated with a hypothetical port on the river Brede at Sedlescombe, less than 3 km away to the north. If the stream running through the site had been navigable for small barges, material could have been transported by water to Spray's Bridge, some 2 km away, where a known Roman road crosses the stream, whence it could be taken by road to the Sedlescombe port. Alternatively, it might have been taken further to the known Classis Britannica port on the river Rother at Bodiam.11 The bath-house lies on the southern extremity of the known ironmaking settlement, partly cut into the steep hill-slope. There is a fall of I in i i in the 50 m between the present path just above the bath-house and the present stream level. The ironworking area lies to the north of the bath-house, which was inserted into an extensive area of dumping of industrial refuse. The area identified as the Romano-British ironworks at Beauport Park is shown on the Geological Survey Sheet 320 as lying on Wadhurst Clay, known to produce the highest- grade iron ore in the Wealden Series.2 EXCAVATION The work on and around the bath-house has concentrated on three sectors, shown in FIG. 2. The first of these is the bath-house proper and its immediate surroundings, the second is the area of the wooden 'tank', and the third is the adjoining section of the site of the slag-bank, largely removed for road-building materials in the 19th century (see above). THE BATH-HOUSE (FIG. 3) [Note The numbering of the rooms relates to the order in which they were excavated.] Room I (caldarium) This room, the first to be discovered and excavated, measures c. 3-5 m square. Pilae were found resting on a sub-floor of opus signinum, regularly spaced in the western half but more unevenly distributed in the eastern half, especially in the area adjoining the praefurnium (VI), where the standard hypocaust tiles of the western rows of pilae were replaced in SH.

General plan of the bath-house area. places by stacks of irregular fragments of tegula or pieces of stone. The floor of the room had been carried on larger tiles, some of which were found in situ or broken up, but the overlying opus signinum had disappeared almost completely. It had disintegrated under the combined influence of heat from the praefurnium and subsequent water penetration from above and below into a reddish, gritty slurry, known to the excavators as 'red porridge', which admirably describes its colour and texture. The original floor level could readily be identified, partly from the height of the pilae and the stone offsets on the western and south-western walls, but principally from one surviving intact segment in the north-western corner. This showed it to have been of conventional form, consisting of some 5 cm of opus signinum laid on large tiles, which were in turn located on the pilae. The hot air from the praefurnium was carried up the walls in close-set columns of hollow flue-tiles, set into the concrete interior facings of the walls. These survived in situ in the north-western corner, in association with the surviving fragment of floor. The cement had in turn been faced with plaster (in this case painted red) and there was a quarter-round fillet at the angle of wall and floor. To the east lies the first surviving praefurnium (VI). As excavated, there was no longer an arch in this wall at sub-floor level. Examination of the masonry of the wall showed that the original arch communicating with the furnace must have collapsed under the influence of prolonged heat, which would have caused the stone to spall and disintegrate.13 The 13 It is somewhat surprising that there is no evidence here of the use of a composite iron bloom of the type</page><page sequence="6">222 GERALD BRODRIBB AND HENRY CLEERE collapsed section of the wall had been rebuilt rather shoddily, a new praefurnium being constructed to the north of the building (XI). During the earlier phase, before Praefurnium VI was built, a tile drain was incorporated at sub-floor level and running through the wall, doubtless to evacuate excess water from the floor of the caldarium. It was constructed of double imbrex sections and ran beneath the level of the stoke-hole itself. In the later phase a drain made of single inverted imbrices was inserted at main floor level. Since the wall of Praefurnium VI is not bonded into the east wall of the caldarium, the former would appear to have been added after the original structure was built. It is suggested that an earlier praefurnium existed outside the north wall of Room IV (qv). When the major reconstruction was carried out (see below), this furnace was demolished and the east wall of the Caldarium I was breached to accommodate the arch of a new praefurnium (VI). The latter appears to have been in use for a relatively short time before it was abandoned, the arch being blocked up and only a small aperture preserved to receive the drain that evacuated surface water from the main floor. Both the piercing of the wall for the arch and the subsequent blocking resulted in disturbance of the floor in this part of the room and of its underlying pilae. When the arch was blocked, a pila was located immediately in front of the pre-existing arch, a feature that would have been avoided at all costs had the praefurnium still been in operation, since it would have been a source of considerable structural weakness. The wall to the south is common with the frigidarium (II) and had a window in its centre, only the sill of which survives. It is arguable that this was probably glazed, so as to increase the light in the caldarium and at the same time conserve its heat. A number of fragments of window-glass certainly came from the filling of this room, though these may, of course, have derived from a clerestory. The filling also contained large quantities of roof tiles (tegulae and imbrices), which indicate that this room had a pitched tile roof. Fragments of 'chimney pot' were found in the fill of this room, suggesting that these may have been placed on the ridge of the roof to evacuate fumes ducted up the walls. In the western wall there is a doorway communicating with the tepidarium (IV). Beneath the large sandstone slab in the doorway there is an arch, allowing heated air to pass into the hypocaust system in that room. The doorway itself exhibits two phases, an earlier when it was centrally located and measured c. 1.6 m across and a secondary phase when it was narrowed to c. 1-2 m with the addition of extra masonry on its south side. The stone slab is central to the later doorway and so must relate to the second phase. There are slots on either side of the slab, which are probably the settings for a timber door frame. A stone voussoir (removed during the excavation by vandals) was found in position on the wall to the north side of the doorway and a number of broken tile voussoirs were found in the filling in the vicinity, suggesting that this doorway was arched in its second phase, the stones and tiles being rendered with cement and plaster, traces of which were found adhering to some of the fragments, and probably painted. To the north Room I communicates through a doorway with a second caldarium (VIII): this doorway is described below, in the section on that room. It is relevant, however, to draw attention here to the rows of laid stones just in front of the doorway, for which there is no apparent function. These probably represent the surviving footings of an earlier wall. associated with bath-houses elsewhere (see J.S. Wacher, Britannia ii (197I), 200-2), given the fact that this bath-house was on a major ironmaking site. It is, however, possible that a composite bloom of this kind may have been used in the second praefurnium (XI).</page><page sequence="7">THE CLASSIS BRITANNICA BATH-HOUSE AT BEAUPORT PARK 223 VII -VIII - xlu L .. .. . 30 D 0 Q - 99CD&amp;DID-i ] I-]1- ] D1 -1E -,,El xi I .El..

Room II (frigidarium) This room is almost identical in size (c. 3-45 m square) with Caldarium I. It is paved with well laid bessalis tiles, 21 cm square, sections of which had been removed in antiquity in the</page><page sequence="8">224 GERALD BRODRIBB AND HENRY CLEERE centre of the room and in the south-west corner. In the front of the cold plunge bath (III) there is a slab of Purbeck stone measuring I"3 x o-7 m, known to the excavators as 'the bath mat,' a justifiable ascription, since its surface would have been less hazardous to wet feet than the smooth tiles. Access to the bath-house was apparently through a door in the south wall of this room. Unfortunately, the wall to the west side of the doorway was badly slighted by the mechanical excavator that first brought the building to light, and so it is not easy to make out the details of the doorway. It appears to have been c. I m wide and to have had above it in its later phase an inscription (see below) relating to the rebuilding of the bath-house. There were two sesquipedalis tiles, 43 cm square, on the floor of the doorway, flanked by standard bessales. The area in the centre of the room where tiles were missing, measuring c. I m x 1.75 m, revealed that two drains (one from the cold plunge Bath III and the other from the tepidarium, V) met here, to discharge to the exterior of the building through a single drain under the main entrance doorway. That from the plunge bath was made of cylindrical hollow tiles and that from the tepidarium was composed of tegulae placed right (ie. flanged) side up and covered with sesquipedales, only one of which was still in situ. The common drain to the outside was of yet another form: it consisted of a square-section channel made of mortared pilae. It discharged below the door into a slag-filled soakaway and down the gully which ran along the south wall of the building, ultimately to the stream down the slope. Examination of the south wall of the building revealed another apparent drain outlet about 20 cm to the east of that discharging from II, but the origin of this drain could not be ascertained without dismantling the wall and the floor of the room. Since this lies within the fabric of one of the original walls of the building, it may be associated with an earlier phase, obliterated during reconstruction. It was initially assumed that the tiles in the centre of the room overlying the junction of the two drains were removed by post-abandonment 'squatters' (see below). However, it is difficult to understand why this should have been done, and in so neat a manner. An attractive alternative explanation may be that an ornamental feature of some kind, perhaps a fountain or a raised basin, stood here, which could be emptied directly into the drain beneath, and which was removed complete for re-use elsewhere when the settlement was abandoned. Four tiles had also been removed in the south-west corner of the room, close to the doorway, and the underlying natural clay had been dug out to a depth of c. 15 cm. The hole was filled with ash and charcoal containing a globular pot with anthropomorphic applied decoration, a shallow dish with applied groove, and a narrow amphora neck; on the surface of the floor adjacent to this hole was found a large cooking pot, which appeared to have been on the floor when silting began and later broke when the roof collapsed. This feature is believed to represent 'squatter' occupation soon after the bath-house and settlement were abandoned but before the building had deteriorated significantly. The walls were concreted and plastered, the plaster being painted. In the south-west corner the lower part of the plaster still intact is painted red (perhaps as a dado), with white above. One segment of painted plaster in the north-west corner, which appears to have slid down from higher up the wall, is basically yellow-painted with red decoration on it. Plaster collected from the fill suggests that the basic design on the upper parts of the walls consisted of white-painted panels outlined in red: the red-on-yellow fragment may represent a panel. There was a quarter-round fillet at the base of all the walls. The roof of this room was pitched and tiled, on the basis of the large amount of broken and whole tegulae and imbrices recovered from its filling. A complete 'chimney pot' (see below) was found lying on the floor, in a 20 cm layer of silt, in the north-west corner. It</page><page sequence="9">THE CLASSIS BRITANNICA BATH-HOUSE AT BEAUPORT PARK 225 seems unlikely that so heavy and fragile an object would have survived a fall from the roof ridge undamaged, and so it is postulated that it had been removed prior to the abandonment of the building for re-use and was for some reason not taken away. Phases I Construction 2 First abandonment 3 Reconstruction: plaster renovated, inscription inserted over entrance door 4 Second abandonment; removal of ?basin 5 Squatter occupation 6 Silting and disintegration of plaster 7 Collapse of roof 8 Burial of building Room III (plunge bath) The cold plunge bath lying to the east of the frigidarium (II) measures 3 m X 1-4 m internally. It is lined with c. 5 cm of good-quality gravelly concrete, heavily iron-stained at its slightly concave base. There is clear evidence of re-lining on at least one occasion and also of patching of the base. External examination of the east wall showed that this had subsided badly at one corner, which would have disturbed the lining of the bath and have been the occasion of at least one relining episode. The west wall consists of a ledge 0-46 m high by 1.8 m long, opening out into Frigidarium I; it is made of stone, capped with a row of tiles (bessales and tegulae) and finished with cement and plaster. A drain, made of double imbrices, discharges from the centre of the bath through the east wall. No trace could be found of a drain on the west side connecting with the tile drain into the centre of Frigidarium II: it may, therefore, be assumed that this was blocked during reconstruction work, the outlet within the bath itself being rendered over with concrete. It would clearly be more practicable to have a short drain that could be cleared easily from outside the building in the event of blockage, rather than a much longer drain lying beneath a substantial paved floor and perhaps joining with another drain at a point that was capped by a monumental feature such as a basin or fountain (see above). When excavated, this under-floor drain was found to have been completely silted up, which lends support to this hypothesis. The walls of the bath, to judge from finds within the fill, were plastered and painted a uniform red. The roof was probably tiled, since there was a deep layer of broken tiles and stone, with some iron holdfasts in it, overlying a primary filling of sticky yellowish silt, containing oyster shell, animal bone, and sherds of coarse pottery, perhaps deriving from a short 'squatter' occupation (see Room II above). The presence of some fragments of window glass suggests that there was a clerestory above the bath. One interesting feature of the filling of this bath was the presence of a number of flat elliptical or round smooth pebbles, which may have been used for toilet purposes similar to the use of pumice as an abrasive. Phases I Construction 2 First abandonment 3 Reconstruction: relined, new drain through east wall, rectification of subsidence of east wall 4 Second abandonment</page><page sequence="10">226 GERALD BRODRIBB AND HENRY CLEERE 5 Squatter occupation (use as rubbish tip?) 6 Silting 7 Collapse of roof 8 Burial of building Room IV (tepidarium) This room was the most difficult to interpret. It measures 2-8 m X 23 m internally, communicating to the east with Caldarium I and to the south with Tepidarium V. In its final phase it was floored with opus signinum, overlying a partial pillar hypocaust (in the centre of the room), exhausting through channels to flues in the south-east, south-west, and north-west corners. The flues in the south-east and south-west corners are made of columns of box-tiles, secured to the walls by iron holdfasts and still standing in the latter case to a height of nearly 2 m, whilst that in the north-west corner is made of imbrices straddling the angle of the walls. Hot air came from Caldarium I through a rectangular- sectioned flue running under the doorway. As in the other rooms, the stone walls were rendered with successive layers of cement and plaster. Two phases of painted plaster were recognized: a primary red phase overlaid by a later white-painted phase. Again, there was a quarter-round fillet moulding running round the whole room at the angle between walls and floor. There are faint indications that there may have been a window opening to the exterior in the northern wall, corresponding with that in Tepidarium V (qv). There were two distinct phases of roof on this room and on that adjoining it (V). The original roof was pitched and tiled, but this seems to have deteriorated badly during the first period of abandonment, to judge from the large amount of broken tegulae and imbrices found lying outside its west wall. When the bath-house was reconstructed, Rooms IV and V were covered with substantial barrel-vaults of stone set in concrete. These were found inside the two rooms, broken into large sections. Since the two rooms adjoined one another, it might have been expected that they would have been roofed with a single barrel-vault covering both rooms and running north-south. The fallen sections, however, showed incontrovertibly that each had its own barrel-vault, running east-west: the keystones, flanked by tiles on edge, are clearly shown in PL. XIB. That this was the case is confirmed by a study of the walls of the two rooms. The wall between them was thickened to take the combined downward thrust from the two barrel-vaults and a buttress was built on the west wall of the doorway between the two rooms for the same reason. At the same time, the north wall of Room IV seems to have been substantially rebuilt, at least on its interior face. The exterior of this wall shows clear evidence of an arch having been blocked up (PL. XIIA). The stones outlining this arch are reddened with heat, suggesting that there may have been a stoke-hole (praefurnium) here in the first phase. Careful excavation, however, revealed no trace of this structure outside the building, and so it is assumed that it must have been obliterated totally by levelling work when the second caldarium (VIII) was built. The northern half of Room IV was, therefore, excavated down to natural. There was no trace of the arch on the inner face of the wall, which implies that this must have been completely replaced when the barrel-vault was constructed. This view is confirmed by the fact that the inner face of this wall is not bonded with the east wall. Nor was there any indication of a channel leading from the site of the inferred praefurnium to the central pillar hypocaust. Careful examination of the clay filling between the hypocaust and the north wall suggested that this was a secondary deposit of clean yellow clay overlying natural clay, from which it is virtually indistinguishable. There were, however, faint traces of what may be the bases of pilae on the original underfloor surface. It is suggested, therefore, that the original</page><page sequence="11">THE CLASSIS BRITANNICA BATH-HOUSE AT BEAUPORT PARK 227 praefurnium of the bath-house, antedating Praefurnium VI (qv) lay outside the north wall of Room IV, which was originally a caldarium with a full pillared hypocaust. Recon- struction of the bath-house after the first abandonment involved removal of the prae- furnium, partial filling of the hypocaust, construction of a barrel-vault, and the building of a new praefurnium outside the east wall of Caldarium I. Room IV is c. io cm lower than Room V, to the south. Drainage of a tepidarium, where a good deal of water is likely to have been splashed about, is assured by a shallow rectangular- section drain under the tiled sill of the doorway between the two rooms (PL. XIIB), which runs, through a drain of inverted tegulae, diagonally across the north-east corner of Room V through Room II (qv) and ultimately to the exterior of the bath-house. Phases I Construction 2 First abandonment 3 Reconstruction: partial rebuild of north wall, reduction of pillar hypocaust, insertion of buttress on west wall, construction of barrel-vault, new floor 4 Second abandonment 5 Silting 6 Collapse of roof 7 Burial of building Room V (tepidarium) This room measures 3-25 mX 2-3 m and communicates with the frigidarium, II, and the tepidarium, IV. It is floored over its southern 6o% with tegulae lying face downwards and over its northern 40% with opus signinum. It is suggested that the work involved in reinforcing the north wall resulted in considerable damage to the tiles on the northern part of the floor, which were removed and replaced with opus signinum (as was the whole floor in the adjoining room, IV). Also like Room IV, it underwent two roofing phases - first a pitched tile roof, succeeded by a barrel-vault of stones set in concrete and averaging 25 cm in thickness, orientated east-west. This necessitated the reinforcement of the wall between it and Room IV with an additional 20 cm of material, reducing the north-south dimension of the room, hitherto the same as Room II, from 3-45 m to 3.25 m. At the same time a buttress 20 cm wide was built up against the west wall in the doorway into Room IV, thereby partly masking the column of box-tiles in the north-west corner. The floor was not excavated, but 'bosing' suggests that it is similar to that in Rooms IV and IX, a central pillar hypocaust chamber with channels running diagonally to flues in three corners of the room. Those in the north-west and south-west corners are of box-tiles, whilst imbrices are used in the south-east corner, all being secured in position with iron holdfasts, cemented over, plastered, and painted. Fragments of red- and white-painted plaster were recovered from the primary fill of the room, and some small sections of red-painted plaster are still in situ just above the quarter-round fillet in parts of the room. The doorway between Rooms IV and V was probably closed by a wooden door. There was a shallow round pivot-hole, with a tile below it, in the north-west corner of the room. A similar pivot-hole was found on the northern side of the doorway connecting with Room IX. This doorway was floored with tiles, flanked by shallow beam slots, analogous to those in the doorway linking Rooms I and IV, and interpreted as the bases for a wooden door frame. There is no clear indication of the nature of this doorway, though a few tile voussoir fragments suggest that it may have been arched, following the line of the barrel-vault. Bosing indicates that a flue ran under this doorway, to carry warm air into Room IX.</page><page sequence="12">228 GERALD BRODRIBB AND HENRY CLEERE The drain from Room IV runs diagonally underneath the opus signinum floor in the north part of the room, through the doorway and into Room II. This may indicate that the drain is a later feature rather than an original one: it is perhaps significant that the regularly laid tile floor of Room II is disrupted in the area overlying the end of the tegula drain. This may have been rendered necessary by a lowering of the level of the floor of Room IV when it was converted from a caldarium to a tepidarium, coupled with a change in function that would result in more water to be disposed of. It should, however, be noted that the floor of Room V is also c. io cm higher than that of Room II, which may imply that it was originally higher than that of the other rooms for some reason that is not readily apparent. An important feature of Room V is the interior-splayed window in the centre of its south wall. The stone still survives, 1-27 m above the floor level. Window sills of comparable type occur in Britain only at Chesters and Ravenglass. The sloping sill and lower course of stones around the window itself were well preserved; these had originally been rendered with cement and, probably, with plaster. No window-glass was found within the fill of the room or outside it, strongly suggesting that the window was carefully dismantled and removed for re-use when the settlement was finally abandoned. Phases I Construction 2 First abandonment 3 Reconstruction: piercing of west wall to communicate with new Room IX, strength- ening of north wall and addition of buttress to support barrel-vault, resurfacing of northern part of floor 4 Second abandonment 5 Silting 6 Collapse of roof 7 Burial of building Room VI (praefurnium) This stoke-hole lies outside the east wall of Caldarium I. It consists of two roughly parallel walls 3-5 m long and c. I m apart. The first 1-5 m nearest the wall is thickly lined with clay, hard-baked on the inner surfaces, which narrows the aperture to c. o0-45 m; the clay lining terminates with large stones. A bronze boiler may have been supported on the stones and clay walls, serving the plunge bath (VII). The walls are not bonded with the east wall of Room I, implying that the praefurnium was a later addition. The only aperture in the wall communicating with Room I is a small one (c. 15 cm), containing a drain of inverted imbrices, at the level of the upper floor (now disappeared) of the caldarium. This is bedded in the deep ash filling of the praefurnium and wedged with yellow clay; it continues for some distance outside the building. Further excavation revealed a second drain, this time cylindrical and made up of two imbrices, at the level of the sub-floor of the caldarium, which it was designed to drain. This drain runs underneath the roughly tiled floor of the outer part of the praefurnium. The wall above the praefurnium had been roughly filled with irregularly laid stones and tile fragments (see Room I above). The reason for the abandonment of this praefurnium, which was superseded by XI (qv), is not immediately apparent. It was probably connected with a demand for a very hot plunge bath, created by the conversion of a warm plunge into a hot bath immediately overlying the entry flue of the new praefurnium (X). It may also be connected with some instability on the eastern (lower) side of the building: the cold plunge bath (III) shows that its outer wall had suffered some subsidence, necessitating the insertion of an additional wedging course at both corners.</page><page sequence="13">THE CLASSIS BRITANNICA BATH-HOUSE AT BEAUPORT PARK 229 There is no evidence, apart from the walls, of the praefurnium having been roofed, though some tile fragments were found in its fill and around it. It seems reasonable to postulate that it would have been covered by a pentice roof of some kind. Phases I Construction 2 Collapse of furnace arch 3 Wall rebuilt, new drain inserted, praefurnium out of use 4 Second abandonment 5 Silting 6 Collapse of roof 7 Burial of building Room VII (plunge bath) This apsidal hot bath, with a radius of C. 1"2 m, adjoins the east wall of the second caldarium (VIII). It is supported on a well-preserved pilae hypocaust and constructed of high-quality opus signinum based on large (43 cm) tiles; there is a continuous quarter-round fillet at the angle of wall and floor. There is a low step on the west side, between the bath and Room VIII, built of stone and hollow flue tiles and rendered with pink opus signinum. Two phases of construction can be identified. In the earlier phase the west side of the bath was gently curved (as shown in PL. XIIIA). This was later rebuilt as a straight wall, of stone and tile (there is no evidence of the material of the earlier wall). The means of emptying this bath is obscure: the only outlet discovered in the excavation was a round-section tile drain passing through this wall and discharging on the sub-floor of Room VIII. No trace could be found of any outlet to the exterior of the building. There was no evidence of silting in the bath itself; instead, building rubble (stone, concrete, and tile) rested directly upon its base. No plaster was found in this filling, suggesting that, unlike the rooms described so far, the bath was not lined with painted plaster. The inference to be drawn is that this part of the bath-house did not disintegrate slowly after abandonment but was demolished, perhaps as a consequence of the removal of certain fixtures. Phases i Construction 2 Redesign: west wall straightened 3 Second abandonment: partial dismantlement 4 [Silting] 5 Collapse of roof 6 Burial of building Room VIII (caldarium) The second hot room measures c. 2-5 m x 3-5 m internally and lies to the north of the first caldarium, I. It has a full pillared hypocaust system, but the pilae are less regularly disposed than those in the western half of Room I. In the latter room, these support sesquipedales upon which the concrete floor was laid, but these large tiles were not used in Room VIII: standard bessales were corbelled upwards to take the concrete floor (as in the case of the adjoining hot bath, VII). The pilae rest on a sub-floor which is tiled only in its western section, the remainder of the floor being of natural clay. As in Room I, the opus signinum floor had disintegrated, to form the same 'red porridge'</page><page sequence="14">230 GERALD BRODRIBB AND HENRY CLEERE resulting from the breakdown of the binder under the combined influence of heat and water seepage: only a small section survived in situ, on the north wall. There are indications that this room, too, had a quarter-round fillet at the angle between wall and floor. None of the internal wall-cladding survived; no plaster was recovered from the fill, suggesting that this room, like the hot bath, was not plastered. Only one flue-tile was found in situ, in the north-west corner. There is no indication of this room having had a barrel-vault of the type found in Rooms IV and V, and it may be assumed that it had a tiled roof. Communication with Caldarium I was through a doorway located slightly to the east of the centre of the dividing wall. The flue from Room VIII to Room I passes underneath the sill of the doorway, formed of concrete. Slots indicate that this door was framed in wood, but there is no trace of a pivot for the door itself on either side of the doorway. The irregular stones just in front of the doorway are not easily explicable. There is a suggestion, however, that the doorway may have been changed from an original form and location and that these stones may represent no more than discarded constructional material. Phases I Construction 2 Redesign of doorway 3 Second abandonment 4 Silting 5 Collapse of roof 6 Burial of building Room IX (?apodyterium) This room, c. 3-5 m square, lies to the west of Room V. It is clearly a later addition, since its north and south walls are not bonded into the walls of Room V and, moreover, the south wall is c. 40 out of alignment with the main south wall bounding Rooms III, II, and V. The upper floor level was made up of coarse opus signinum, containing fragments of tile up to 5 cm cube, which had been much degraded by weathering and water. This overlies a tiled surface, the tiles being of all sizes (bessales, sesquipedales and terrae mammatae laid face down). In view of the resulting irregularity, it seems safe to assume that it was not intended to have been exposed, but merely to have served as the base for the concrete floor, and also to bridge the pillar hypocaust beneath. This system was supplied with heated air by a flue running under the doorway from Room V, from the centre chamber, supported on a motley collection of pilae (standard tile columns, stones, even an upended box-tile); the hot air passed through channels to the south-east and south-west corners, where there were vertical flues of imbrices, and the north-west corner, where standard box-tiles were used. A row of four box-tiles were found lying diagonally across the floor in this area, just as they had fallen. The subfloor in the central chamber consisted of rubble pressed into the natural clay. The whole hypocaust system was filled with fine clay-silt when excavated: since this room is the highest up the slope, it seems likely that this silting would have occurred after abandonment. Two rectangular niches, measuring I m wide by 0-45 m deep, were found on each of the north and south interior walls, and a fifth, semi-circular in plan, in the centre of the west wall and immediately facing the doorway from Room V. All five niches had sills or shelves of tile (reversed tegulae) covered with cement and, in the case of the semi-circular niche, further rendered with plaster. Since these niches were c. I m above floor level it is unlikely that they were used as seats. Those on the flanking walls may have contained wooden</page><page sequence="15">THE CLASSIS BRITANNICA BATH-HOUSE AT BEAUPORT PARK 231 cupboards or 'lockers', which is the accepted interpretation of the similar features in the Chesters bath-house. It is possible that the semi-circular niche had a ritual function: an ox skull was found on the floor immediately in front of it, and nearby lay a dupondius of Lucilla (c. A.D. 170), with mortar adhering to the obverse, implying that the reverse, with its image of Juno, had been displayed. The absence of barrel-vault fragments and the presence of a deposit of broken roof-tiles overlying the thin (5-10 cm) silt layer on the floor suggests that this room had a pitched tile roof which collapsed relatively early after the settlement was abandoned. The angle of the fallen material demonstrates clearly that it had collapsed from the west, i.e. under pressure from up the slope into which the bath-house was built. Examination of the masonry of the east wall shows that the doorway communicating with Room V was broken through when Room IX was added. The masonry of the jambs is relatively rough by comparison with original doorways such as that between Rooms II and V, where large dressed stones formed the jambs. The doorway was cased with wood, as shown by the shallow slots on either side. It is worthy of comment that, with the exception of the later Praefurnium XI, this room is the only part of the bath-house that shows no evidence of reconstruction or repair prior to abandonment. The function of this room is difficult to ascertain. The presence of a channel hypocaust and the fact that it is only accessible through the frigidarium (II) and one of the tepidaria (V) would seem to militate against its being an apodyterium, though the 'lockers' encourage the notion that this room was not in use for a specifically bathing purpose. Phases I Construction 2 Abandonment 3 Silting 4 Collapse of roof 5 Burial of building Room X (hot bath) In its final phase, this was a hot bath measuring c. 3 m x i- I m internally and built of mortared stone, lined with opus signinum with a fine cement slip over it. It is I m deep at its west end and o-50 m deep at its east end; the ends shelve down to the centre, where there is a drain-hole in the south side, discharging to the sub-floor of Room VIII (and thence under the doorway into Room I, to empty to the exterior through the drain in its blocked-up east wall through the earlier praefurnium, VI). The bath is supported by an arch which joins the hypocaust of Room VIII to the later praefurnium, XI. Hot air was exhausted upwards through box-tiles in the north-west and south-west corners (similar flues probably existed in the other two corners, but the bath is in rather more fragmentary condition at its east end). The filling of the bath was almost entirely composed of tile voussoir fragments, which suggests that there was a barrel-vault of some kind over it, heated by air from the updraught flues. There are shallow ledges on the south and east sides, but not on the north or west. Degradation of the bath at the east end permitted a partial examination of what lay beneath. This revealed cemented walls going right down to the sub-floor behind the bath. Investigation elsewhere confirmed that the whole area had been concreted in this way, implying that there had originally been a plunge bath here, comparable with Room III. At some stage this had been converted to a hot bath, heated from below when the later praefurnium (XI) was added. There was also modification of the wall between the bath and</page><page sequence="16">232 GERALD BRODRIBB AND HENRY CLEERE Room VIII, presumably at this time. The original opening was c. 2.2 m wide, almost the whole length of the bath, but this was subsequently reduced to c. 1-5 m or less. The arch, built in stone and rendered with cement, in the north wall of this room, facing the later Praefurnium XI, is difficult to interpret with any certainty. It may be a remanent feature from the earlier cold-bath stage, when it could have constituted a window to the exterior; there would still have been over o05 m depth of bath below it at that time. However, it shows no signs of having been filled in and, since it springs from the floor of the hot bath, doubt can be cast on this explanation. It may be significant that a large portion of the floor of the bath is missing immediately in front of the arch, which suggests that the arch and part of the floor had been filled by another element, such as a testudo, which had been removed in its entirety when the bath-house was dismantled before abandonment. Phases I Construction (cold bath) 2 Reconstruction (hot bath) 3 Abandonment and partial demolition 4 Silting 5 Collapse of roof 6 Burial of building Room XI (praefurnium) The second praefurnium was very similar in general layout to the earlier (III). It had, however, been very badly slighted when the building was partially dismantled. This lends further support to the view (see X above) that the parallel stone walls supported a testudo, the removal of which entailed disturbance to the supporting structure. The construction was less careful than that of the earlier praefurnium, III: there was, for example, no paved area outside the main firebox, nor was the latter so thickly lined with clay. This stoke-hole seems to have been used for a relatively short period, since the clay and stones were not reddened to the same extent as those composing III. There was also a considerably smaller ash deposit, both within the praefurnium and in its immediate vicinity. There is no evidence of the form of the roof over this structure, though the number of tile fragments found in the fill indicate that it was probably a tiled pentice or pitched roof. Phases I Construction 2 Abandonment: removal of testudo? 3 Silting 4 Collapse of roof 5 Burial of building The exterior walls The quality of the building construction is admirable, both inside and out, as PLS. XIIIB and XIVA show. The walls are made of regular courses of roughly dressed local sandstone, with larger quoins at the corners. Excavation of the foundations of the south wall of Room V showed that the wall was built on irregular stone foundations capped with c. io cm of yellow clay, in turn covered with an ash layer. Then came a single course of larger dressed stones, which were offset from the two overlying courses of smaller stones. Next came a layer of tegulae upon which the walls proper were built. All the courses, from the large offset foundation layer upwards, were set in greyish puddled clay. The same technique was used for the</page><page sequence="17">THE CLASSIS BRITANNICA BATH-HOUSE AT BEAUPORT PARK 233 interior walls, also made of rough ashlar. The cavities between the inner and outer faces were filled with rubble, also bedded in puddled clay, to produce strong, solid walls c. o0-75 m thick. The main distinction discernible between the masonry of the earlier- and later-phase walls is the absence on certain walls of the latter of a tile course. A closer examination, however, shows that the earlier work was of superior quality, with smaller and more carefully laid stones. It is, nevertheless, impossible to judge the phase of a wall from the masonry alone; the masonry of the apsidal hot bath, VII, which was incontestably built in the last constructional phase, was an especially fine example of Roman military building. THE AREA OUTSIDE THE BATH-HOUSE As the general plan of the excavation (FIG. 2) shows, a considerable area outside the bath-house was excavated, in order to establish its links with other features, such as the wooden tank and the slag bank, and to ascertain the circumstances of its construction and burial. It is not intended to give full details of this work, which is available in the archive, but simply to give a synthesis of the results. Excavation in the area enclosed by the angle of external walls of Rooms IV and VIII provided evidence that the bath-house had been built into a pre-existing slag- and rubbish-heap. A layer of mixed material, attributable to the sudden and catastrophic collapse of the slag-heap, overlay one of building debris, resulting from the collapse of the building. This in turn overlay a layer of slag and charcoal, very variable in size grading and assumed to be original dumping, an impression confirmed by the layers beneath, one of furnace debris and one of mixed industrial and domestic rubbish. There was a narrow (c. 35 cm) channel between the almost vertical face of this dump and the external walls, filled with a mixture of clay, slag and general rubbish. This makes it rather difficult to interpret the fire-reddened arch on the outside of the north wall of Room IV. There seems not to be enough space for a praefurnium here, as postulated above. It can only be assumed that dumping continued in this area after the demolition of this stoke-hole, thereby obliterating any cleared area that might have existed before. Such a stoke-hole would have been accessible from the west. To the west of Room IV, where the hillside rose steeply, a similar trench was observed, again packed with miscellaneous rubbish, and this trench continued round the north and west walls of Room IX. The ground up the slope to the west above these rooms was covered with clearly stratified rubbish materials (both industrial and domestic), with what appeared to be a roughly metalled track immediately overlying natural. Similarly, the south wall of Rooms IX and V was cut into undisturbed slag-bank material and natural clay. The situation changes when the south wall of Room V is reached. Here the natural clay has been cut back and the wall was obviously open to view along the whole of its length (not surprising, perhaps, in view of the existence of a window on this wall). Thereafter, the south wall of Room II is partly cut into the natural clay and partly raised above it, as the building extends down the natural slope. The whole of the east side of the building is built at natural clay level, but the later praefurnium (XI), the bath (X), and the later caldarium are cut into the earlier slag heap. As already mentioned, access to the building was through a door in the souhp wall of the frigidarium (II). A layer of flat slabs was laid across the shallow gully draining towards the stream and taking surface water from the whole of the west side of the building. Unfortunately, this area was rather badly damaged during the initial mechanical excavation of this area and the features are not easy to interpret. There was, however, evidence of a slag-metalled track running down from the area to the west of Rooms IX and IV.</page><page sequence="18">234 GERALD BRODRIBB AND HENRY CLEERE Two features associated with bath-houses were sought but not found. First, there was no evidence, in the area explored intensively, of a latrine of any kind. It is likely, of course, that this would have been located down the slope from the bath-house rather than above it, for obvious reasons. It is possible, therefore, that the stone building of which traces were found in trial trenches below the bath-house (see below) was the latrine. Secondly, there was no sign of any water supply to the bath-house. Whilst running water was not a prerequisite of Roman baths, it is a feature of many urban and some larger military balnea. The wooden tank (see below) may have served as a reservoir from which the plunge baths and heating tanks of the bath-house could have been filled manually or using a simple pump, but this seems to have gone out of use during the life of the bath-house, or even before it was built, and so there may be another reservoir to be found in the immediate environs of the bath-house. It is possible, of course, that water was supplied from a spring above the bath-house, but no traces of any conduit have been found in the area up the slope. PHASING OF THE BATH-HOUSE Table I shows the relative phasing of the eleven components of the building. Fig. 4 illustrates the phase plans described below. This indicates that it was built originally as a simple four-room structure - frigidarium (II), tepidarium (V), and two caldaria (I, IV), fired from an inferred praefurnium outside Room IV and with a cold bath attached (III).

Reconstruction of bath-house.</page><page sequence="20">236 GERALD BRODRIBB AND HENRY CLEERE After a possible short period of abandonment, for which there is slight evidence, it was reconstructed with the addition of another caldarium (VIII), an apodyterium (IX), a hot bath (VII), a second cold bath (X), and a new praefurnium (VI). The original caldarium (or even sudatorium) of Room IV was converted to a second tepidarium, the original praefurnium being completely removed. The wall between the new praefurnium (VI) and the caldarium (I) collapsed towards the end of this phase. The wall was rebuilt, and a new praefurnium (XI) was constructed beyond the cold bath (X), which was converted at this time to a hot bath. Within a relatively short time the decision was taken to abandon the settlement. Certain fittings were removed (window-glass, lead pipes, bronze water tanks) and the building was left exposed. There was a brief squatter occupation of part of the building (II, III) shortly afterwards. Exposure to the weather resulted first in the loss of plaster from the walls, coupled with some silting, both wind- and water-borne. Next came collapse of the tiled roofs, beginning with that over IX. The final phase was a catastrophic slip of industrial and domestic refuse from the heap into which the bath-house had been set, which resulted in the collapse of the barrel-vaults over IV and V. THE WOODEN 'TANK' Early in October 1969, at a time when the area was Leing prepared for the golf course, an exploratory trench was dug by mechanical excavator at the bottom of the slope, some 25 m from the stream. This cut through 2-5 m of slag and rubbish without any apparent stratification and so the mechanical excavator was withdrawn. Cleaning up the base of the narrow cutting revealed a wooden floor or surface a further 25 cm below. This appeared to consist of substantial tongued-and-grooved oak planks, with a section of tree-trunk lying on it and some rough masonry at one end. The area exposed was I-4 m x i m and it was difficult to interpret the feature with any certainty. In view of the considerable labour likely to be involved in clearing the feature further, it was, therefore, decided to record what had been uncovered and take no further action. It was not until August 1975, when the excavation of the bath-house was virtually complete, that attention turned again to this feature. The upper layer of I m of redeposited refuse was removed mechanically, to reveal a hard, densely packed layer (F-G/4-5, 3), 0-45 m thick, of broken tile, burnt clay, and mortar, the top of which was very compacted, as though it had been regularly trampled. Beneath this was a layer of slag and charcoal (F-G/4-5, 4), varying in thickness between 0-3o and o-90 m, and this in turn overlay a deposit of bluish-grey wet clay, containing brushwood, pieces of worked timber and the wooden sole of a shoe or clog (F-G/4-5, 5), 10-15 cm thick, which lay directly over the wooden structure. The plan of the structure is shown in FIG. 6; time and labour constraints prevented the full excavation of the structure. However, the excavation trench quickly filled with water to a depth of 0-5 m, and so it is believed that the wood is being adequately conserved until a full investigation can be carried out. The section of the structure that was revealed was 2*4 m wide and a length of 2-6 m was exposed. It consisted of six planks, all except one I Roman foot (29.6 cm) wide, lying horizontally and joined by tongues and grooves. They were encased in a frame of timbers measuring 7 cm x 9 cm, the corners being made with halving joints. Upright timbers measuring c. 7 cm x 5 cm fitted into mortices disposed at 50-60 cm intervals around the frame. These originally supported side planks, probably c. 20 cm x 5 cm in section, which fitted into grooves cut into the main frame members; the remains of one of these planks was still in situ. The base planks proved on examination to vary slightly in length, and it appeared that the framework had been made first, the planks being cut to size and dropped in to form a base or floor.</page><page sequence="21">THE CLASSIS BRITANNICA BATtH-HOUSE AT BEAUPORT PARK 237 Ilead S . . .. . .................. Ill S Stone L Tile SWood I'lIT SNails/ 0 50 cm -- , ' f f ",--jib FIG. 6. Plan of wooden structure. Lines of nails were found running the length of the floor, one 5 cm from the frame and the other down the middle of the floor. Some of these stood 3-4 mm proud of the wooden planks, and it was at first assumed that they had been forced upwards by hydrostatic pressure. However, two small patches of sheet lead were found secured by nails in one corner of the structure, and also around a hole c. 4 cm in diameter that had been drilled in the south-eastern corner of the floor. It seems, therefore, that the whole structure had at</page><page sequence="22">238 GERALD BRODRIBB AND HENRY CLEERE one time been lined with lead sheet which had been ripped out when the structure fell out of use, only small fragments remaining, perhaps where patches had been applied in antiquity. The structure has, therefore, been interpreted as a water tank or bath of some kind, which was drained through the hole mentioned above. A large section of tree trunk covered one-third of the area of the tank (2-6 m long X 1-2 m wide X o0-2 m thick). It lay with the curve of the bark downwards. There was a hole measuring 8 cm x 4 cm about o-65 m from its southern end, which seemed to link with a number of grooves at that end of the trunk. Another piece of worked timber measuring o0-4 m x o-6 m with raised flanges lay across the south-west corner of the excavated trench, but there was no apparent linking element between this and the tree trunk. Despite the fact that the downward slope on the tree trunk is now slight and despite the absence of flanges on it, the impression is given of some form of water chute, taking water from further up the slope and discharging it into the stream below, a certain amount being discharged through the hole in the tree trunk to keep the lead-lined water tank topped up with clean rain or spring water. The masonry seen in the original cutting proved to form part of a very crude wall running north-south across the tank floor and covering its south-western corner. This was obviously inserted after the tank had gone out of use, having had its lead stripped out and perhaps its side planking removed for re-use elsewhere. The impression derived from the clay filling containing brushwood and timber offcuts that overlies the tank is that the whole area was levelled up, the brushwood being added to give greater stability in what must have been a somewhat waterlogged area. At the same time the tree trunk may have been partially dismantled and laid flat, to assist the stabilization of the clay base. A number of other pieces of worked and unworked timber occurred in the same layer, in and around the tank, which would have been thrown in for the same reason. It is possible that these may have formed part of the timbersupport for the putative water chute. (Regrettably, these disappeared after having been delivered for examination and timber identification, and only outline drawings exist of them.) Other samples from the same area which were not lost include part of an oak shingle, stakes made of alder, and pieces of willow. Notes made of the missing specimens show that a number of these showed signs of having been cut with saws and axes and trimmed with adzes. Several had holes drilled in them. The general impression was that these were either offcuts from carpentry or broken structural elements. A layer of slag was then laid down over the consolidated clay layer, to provide a hard surface. The rough wall mentioned above seems to have been built as a retaining wall connected with this surface. The presence of post-holes in and below this surface suggests that some structure had been erected upon it. In the complete absence of datable finds from this area, it is difficult to assign it to a period of the bath-house. The indications are', however, that it antedates the construction of the bath-house. It lies down the slope from the bath, o-9 m below the level of its foundations, and so water could only have been supplied to the bath by pump or hand. It is, however, the only water reservoir of any kind that has come to light during the excavations, and the water supply to the bath-house remains in doubt. Trial excavations in the area between the tank and the bath-house, some 12 m away, have indicated that there was a fairly substantial and well built stone wall 4-2 m to the north of the tank. It is interesting to note that the eastern edge of the tank aligns perfectly with the short section of wall found in this area, which in turn is aligned with the eastern wall of the bath-house. This is the obvious area for future excavation. THE SLAG BANK It is difficult to define the exact area and limits of any Roman slag bank, and at Beauport Park this task is doubly difficult, since so much of it has been removed. Nevertheless, it is</page><page sequence="23">THE CLASSIS BRITANNICA BATH-HOUSE AT BEAUPORT PARK 239 limited on its north and east sides by small streams, while both trial excavation and an abrupt change in vegetation have helped to delineate the southern extent; to the west it tails off as it meets the rising slope. The whole, therefore, forms a rough oblong, 127 m long by an average of 49 m wide, giving an area of 6223 m2 which, at 1-54 acres, is not inconsonant with Rock's mention14 of 'two acres or more.' It is impossible to be sure how high the bank originally stood. Rock states that the highest point was '50 feet above the surrounding land,' but he visited it at a time towards the end of Byner's ten-year campaign. It is, however, possible to identify the point towards the south at which Byner stopped quarrying. All along the east side of the gully that he created was piled a high bank of material that had been put through a screen and rejected as too small for road-building. In conversation in 1917 with Herbert Blackman, Mr Grinstead recalled the creation of this bank of sieved material, and trial excavations have confirmed its composition. It now rises some 7-5 m above the stream. It seems likely that the original stream may have come down the centre of the gully, was pushed to the east by Roman dumping from the west, and then pushed even further by Byner's dumping. The base of the gully now exhibits a smooth, level surface resulting from years of shovelling and scraping by Byner's workmen. The area to the north of the present track down the hill from Stonehouse was once part of the slag heap, which ran right up to the edge of the north stream, where dumps can still be seen. On the west side the bank blends into the hillside, and much material still remains, untouched by Byner's operations. One of the present authors has estimated that the original refuse heap left by the Romans contained about ioo,ooo tons of iron slag.15 Farncomb's illustration (PL. XIA) shows considerable layering of the strata in the heap. Whilst there is an element of artistic licence in this depiction, it is soundly based on the cyclical nature of the ironmaking process, producing distinct forms of industrial refuse at different stages of the process.16 Trial excavations in the slag bank have confirmed the existence of such layers, markedly different in colour, texture, and composition. They have also graphically identified the dumps of screened material made by Byner's men: no colour differentiation is discernible in these and none of the constituents is more than about 2 cm in size. On the north side of the slag bank there is an area where the Byner dumps merge with the material resulting from the landslide in antiquity (see above). In colour the two materials are indistinguishable, since both represent a thorough mixing of several distinct types of industrial refuse with domestic rubbish. They can be distinguished only in terms of size grading: the landslide material has a much larger size range than the sieved material. This was observed clearly at the edge of the archaeological excavation trench to the east of the bath-house; for some reason Byner did not extend his operations up the slope to the west; nor, for that matter, did he go down to natural on the west side of the gully. It is not proposed to detail the many trial pits dug into the slag bank in this report; details are available in the archive. They were all dug with the sole intention of establishing the extent of the original slag bank and delineating the operations for road metalling in the nineteenth century. A section cut recently through the slag bank has revealed a thick layer of silt at a depth of 2-5 m, which supports the view that there was originally a stream or shallow pond in the gully below the heap, which was deflected towards the east by refuse dumping. A similar silt layer was found in a trial trench i5 m south of this section and also yielded pieces of wood and leather. 14 J. Rock, op. cit. (note 5). 15 H. Cleere, Bull Inst. Arch.

The role of the Fleet in the ironmaking industry of the Weald has already been discussed at some length by both of the present authors17 and need not be recapitulated here in detail. At the time of the invasion of A.D. 43 there was already ironmaking in progress at several sites in the Battle-Sedlescombe area of East Sussex. This confirms the reference by Caesar to small-scale production of iron in the south-east of Britain at the time of his raids (nascitur ibi. . . in maritimis regionibusferrum: BG.v.I12). It would appear that the whole region was sequestrated as an Imperial estate soon after the invasion, following the usual Roman practice of seizing metal-producing areas for incorporation into the patrimonium. It was administered by the Imperial procurator, possibly operating through a number of local procuratores ferrariarum,18 who would in turn delegate the running of individual works to a vilicus. In the case of the Weald, the western half seems to have been leased out to private ironmakers (coloni), who would have paid annual royalties to the Imperial fiscus. The eastern half, however, remained under direct procuratorial management. The nature of the involvement of the Fleet, attested by the finds of CL BR stamped tiles at several ironmaking establishments,19 is unclear. The most likely interpretation is that the ironworks in this area were dedicated to the provision of the army in the military zones of Britain (and perhaps also on the lower Rhine, in view of the existence of the twin bases of the Classis on either side of the Channel, at Dover and Boulogne) with its requirements of iron, and so the Fleet undertook the handling and distribution of the material, leaving the technology of ironmaking to civilian specialists employed directly by the procurator. Direct Imperial management of the eastern Weald ironworks probably began in the second half of the first century. There is no evidence of an interim period of private management, as was the case in Noricum.20 It is clear, however, that the last quarter of the first century saw a great expansion of iron production in the area, and an extension in the early second century into the High Weald, to sites such as Bardown.21 Production continued at a high rate until some time in the first half of the third century, when the Classis Britannica seems to have been disbanded or dispersed.22 At that time, iron production virtually ceased in the eastern Weald, except at Footlands, where it continued until the end of the fourth century.23 THE BEAUPORT PARK IRONWORKS Fieldwork by one of the authors (GB) over many years has revealed that the Roman site at Beauport Park was a very large one, covering at least 8 ha. It was considerably larger than " G. Brodribb, Sussex Arch. Collect. cvii (1969), IO2-25; H. Cleere, Arch. Journ. cxxxi (1975), 171-99; H. Cleere in D.E.

The volume of slag produced, estimated at some o100,ooo tons, implies that many furnaces would have been operating there simultaneously, which would have required a large body of workers, both skilled and unskilled. This was not a purely military establishment, since the shoes found (see below) belonged to women and children, whilst at least one child's feeding-bottle of glass has been found. As at Bardown,24 there seems to have been clear differentiation between the industrial and the residential areas of the site. Earthmoving work in connexion with the golf course showed that there had been a concentration of smelting furnaces on the west side of the stream by Byner's bridge, and trial trenches in the area between there and the bath-house have produced evidence of ore-roasting having been carried out there. The refuse from industrial operations appears to have been evacuated to the south-west, to form the great slag heap quarried away by Byner. Fieldwalking suggests that the residential part of the settlement lay on the other side of the stream, on higher ground to the north-east, until recently heavily wooded. There is a complete absence of the slag which pervades every other part of the site but substantial indications of habitation in the form of slag-metalled 'service' roads and a considerable amount of pottery, but there was very little tile and no masonry; this suggests that structures in this area were timber-framed and roofed with thatch or wooden shingles. This location would certainly have been more salubrious in some ways, though it does lie downwind of the smelting furnaces, which may have created some pollution problems! There are very few Roman military establishments of any size without bath-houses, and Beauport Park was no exception. Following the common practice, the bath-house, with its dangerous furnaces, was sited outside the main settlement. In this case it was located at the very edge of the settlement, at the far side of the slag-tipping area, which seems over-cautious, especially since the roasting and smelting furnaces, which must have constituted equal fire hazards, appear to have lain much closer to the residential area. The inscription from over the main door of the bath-house leaves no room for doubt as to the organization of the establishment. It was a civilian official, a vilicus, who gave orders for the reconstruction of the bath-house. This term is not a very common one, but it is interesting to note that it occurs in association with a procurator ferrariarum on a series of inscriptions from the Sana valley of northern Yugoslavia on what was almost certainly another Imperial estate.25 The Victoria intaglio (see below) was probably lost by an officer of the Fleet of equestrian rank according to Dr Henig (see below), which raises an interesting query regarding the relative roles of civilian and military control at this establishment. It might be that excavation of the residential area of the settlement would help to resolve this problem and that of the Fleet's involvement in the Wealden ironmaking industry. The existence of a barrack block of undoubted military type at Bardown26 only serves to complicate the problem. THE BATH-HOUSE Excavations in and around the bath-house have shown that some activity was conducted in that part of the site before the bath-house was built. The lead-lined wooden tank is an early feature, almost certainly demolished before the bath-house was erected. It is difficult to be 24 Cleere, op. cit. (note 21). 25 D. Sergejevskii, 'Rimski rudnici 'eljeza u sjeverozapadnoj Bosni,' Glasnik Zemaljskog Muzeja u Sarajevu: Arheologija xviii [n.s.] (1963), 85-IO2; J.J. Wilkes, Dalmatia (London, 1969), 267-8. 26 H. Cleere, unpublished report.</page><page sequence="26">242 GERALD BRODRIBB AND HENRY CLEERE sure of its function. The tank seems to have acted as a reservoir for surface water running down the hillside. In view of the fact that the stream was being polluted daily with industrial refuse, this seems to have been a wise move, providing a source of relatively sweet water. In view of the distance of the tank from the residential part of the site, it seems unlikely that it served as a source of drinking-water. There is no role for water in such quantities or of such purity in the ironmaking process, however, and so the explanation must be sought elsewhere. It is possible that the tank would have acted as a proto-bath-house, allowing the ironworkers to clean up after their long shift working on a very dirty job before going back to their houses or barracks, a form of early 'pithead baths.' This interpretation would seem to be reinforced by the fact that, when the stone bath-house was built, it was located in exactly the same area as the wooden tank. By this time ironmaking had clearly been in progress at Beauport Park for many years, since the bath-house was built into the tail-end of a substantial slag bank on the west bank of the stream. The ground was levelled back into the slope, cutting into both the natural yellow clay and the piled-up slag. It is possible that this levelling was not as arduous as it might seem. The Bardown establishment27 is also on the bank of a stream, and two very large scoops out of the north bank indicate where the outcropping ore was quarried back until either the lens of good-quality ore ran out or the task of removing the overburden became uneconomic in terms of labour. It may be that the Beauport Park bath-house was built into just such an ore-pit, dating from the early years of the settlement, which had later been used as a tip for industrial and other refuse. Although Roman iron slag is heavy to move, it is easier to dispose of than undisturbed Wadhurst Clay. Whatever the beginning, the first, four-room bath-house was set on a level platform of natural clay, flanked on its north and west sides by a mound of slag, furnace debris, and domestic rubbish. This was no doubt battered back to some extent, though the angle of repose of this material is remarkably steep, as excavations on the slag bank at Bardown have proved. After a considerable period of service, evidenced by the repairs and refurbishments in these four rooms, the bath-house appears to have been abandoned or even slighted. It would be idle to speculate on the historical events with which this might be connected, given the absence of dating material. When it was brought back into use by Bass[ian]us on the instructions of his superior, it was enlarged and the functions of certain of the rooms were altered. It seems likely that the roofs over two of the rooms (IV and V) had collapsed, and these were rebuilt as barrel-vaults. It is difficult to understand why this method of roofiing should have been selected for these two rooms, both of which were tepidaria: such a technique would seem to be more appropriate for caldaria. If it had been intended as a protection against a possible slide of material from the looming slag heap, one would expect the new apodyterium to have been roofed in the same way. After a relatively short period (since the last stoke-hole showed signs of much less use than its predecessor and the later rooms show no signs of repair or redecoration), a decision was taken to pull out of the Beauport Park establishment (and, indeed, out of the whole of the eastern Weald) by the Imperial management, whether military or civilian. Accordingly, in characteristic military fashion, the bath-house (and, doubtless, other buildings on the site) was systematically dismantled. Any portable materials that could be used elsewhere, such as lead pipes (none were found on the site), window-glass and fittings, bronze water boilers, the basin or fountain in the frigidarium etc., were carefully removed; in some cases, as in the latest stoke-hole (XI) or the base of the fountain in Room II, this entailed the destruction of much of the supporting structure. 27 Cleere, op. cit. (note 21).</page><page sequence="27">THE CLASSIS BRITANNICA BATH-HOUSE AT BEAUPORT PARK 243 The eastern Weald must have been rather empty in this period. The nearest Roman town to Beauport Park was Rochester, some 55 km as the crow flies to the north-east. It can be shown that no other site in Roman Britain was more remote from a town than these ironworks. Since it was still presumably an Imperial estate, permanent settlement would not have been permitted. It may, however, have been a safe refuge for fugitives and outlaws, as it became in the immediate post-Roman period. The bath-house certainly gave shelter to one group of squatters not long after it was abandoned, but this occupation was short-lived. The elements were then left to penetrate the building, now windowless and probably doorless. The plaster fell from the walls, to mix with the wind- and water-borne silt that began to collect on the floors. The opus signinum floors of the two caldaria, already weakened by heat, disintegrated into a gritty red slurry and fell into the heating chamber below. Roof timbers began to rot and the heavy tile roofs fell down into the rooms below. Within perhaps no more than twenty years the bath-house was a nearly roofless ruin. Had the building been left to the ravages of weather alone, it would have slowly disintegrated, the walls gradually becoming lower and a deep humus layer building up. There is little doubt that it would have proved a fruitful quarry for Dark Age settlers in the area and its stones and tiles would have been widely dispersed in the neighbourhood. However, the slag heap still continued to loom over it and, one day, no doubt after many days of continuous rain, the slag heap suddenly began to slide, rolling down the hillside and demolishing the barrel-vaults and the tops of the walls that still survived. The layers of tip, which were doubtless as striated and varied as those recorded by Farncomb in the nineteenth century, became churned up and commingled as they filled the rooms of the bath-house and rolled on until they met the edge of the main slag heap below, burying the whole building under up to 2 m of rubbish. DATING The coin evidence reported below (p. 256) indicates that the site was occupied between the last quarter of the first century and the second quarter of the third century, and this is supported by the pottery, glass and other finds. That dating, however, applies to the whole settlement and not to the bath-house itself. The absence of securely dated material within the bath-house was almost total: the only safe evidence is perhaps the coin of Lucilla (A.D. 164-182) on the floor of Room IX. This, however, is not as conclusive as it might be, since the coin appears to have been set into the wall of the room for some ritual purpose, and so was not necessarily in current use when it was lost. Let us assume that the site was functioning between A.D. 85 and 235, a period of 150 years. Construction of the bath-house was not initiated until there had been a considerable build-up of slag on the slope, of a volume large enough to have engulfed it when it collapsed catastrophically a couple of centuries later. Without evidence as to the number of smelting furnaces in operation on the site or the sequence of dumping on different parts of the slag bank, it is impossible to estimate how long this took to accumulate. Nevertheless, it would seem reasonable to postulate that the building of the bath-house was not initiated until the second quarter of the second century, when the rebuilding of forts in stone is attested from elsewhere in the province. It is tempting, of course, to link this with the two defensive walls in northern Britain, which would certainly have required very large quantities of iron for constructional purposes. The original building was very well built and a workmanlike structure, adequate for the requirements of, say, a quingenary cohort or its fleet equivalent. It is reminiscent of the</page><page sequence="28">244 GERALD BRODRIBB AND HENRY CLEERE bath-houses at, for example, Gelligaer II, Caerhf^in I, or Holt28 or at Bearsden and Bothwellhaugh29 in size and facilities. All of these establishments originated around the period postulated above for the building of the first phase at Beauport Park. Under the effect of some external stimulus, probably in the late second century, the bath-house fell into disrepair or was damaged, to such an extent that substantial rebuilding was essential. When this work was put into effect, the opportunity was taken to increase its size, again in line with reconstructions at the Welsh forts mentioned above. The bath-house continued in use, on the coin evidence, until at least the reign of Decius (249-251), when final withdrawal took place. This is consistent with the coin evidence from Bardown, where the latest coin is from the reign of Caracalla.30 As to subsequent events, estimates turn into pure speculation, and must be discarded.

Simpson, Central Gaulish potters (1958) Fifteen sherds of mould-decorated samian ware have been recovered from the site of the bath-house. Together they represent fourteen vessels, thirteen of which are Dragendorff Form 37 and one of Dragendorff Form 30. All are from Central Gaul except No. 4, which may be East Gaulish, though made by a potter from Central Gaul who moved his workshop. Most of the sherds indicate that the vessels from which they came had seen considerable use before being discarded. Clearly, then, a residual factor should be considered. None is likely, however, to be earlier than A.D. I30 and none later than about 200. The broad date ranges which have to be allowed for late Antonine workshops, however, mean that even heavily used vessels may not have been deposited outside this period. Most of the vessels could in fact have been supplied within the date range A.D. 145-170. The complete absence of any first-century material or of any of the products of the small, but very distinctive, group of Trajanic Central Gaulish potters is significant here. All sherds are from Dragendorff Form 37, unless otherwise stated. I Central Gaul.

Nor is there space to do more than list the better known types which are present, and to describe and illustrate some of the more significant material (see FIGS. 8-io). The less highly fired vessels (including samian) have been subject to surface loss in the harsh soil conditions. Despite the absence of first-century samian, there is some evidence for first-century, though not necessarily pre-Flavian, occupation, but there is no compelling reason to link this with the bath-house structure; it may be related to previous ironmaking activity. A few sherds of Black Eggshell ware, Chichester (?) micaceous fineware, and Central Gaulish lead-glazed ware should all belong to the later first century, while further 'London ware' imitations of samian bowls and examples of Pompeian Red Ware platters may be of either Flavian or early second-century date. Certain forms of East Sussex ware, however, provide more substantial evidence for the first-century: vessels with stepped necks (Nos. I, 2) and the distinctive 'hollow-knobbed' lids (Nos. 3, 4) are comparable with vessels of mid-first-century date from Herstmonceux, 14 km to the west, and with pottery from the first-century ironmaking site at Sed- lescombe, 8 km to the north.33 It is suggested that the Beauport Park examples are of rather late first-century manufacture, since no 'eyebrow-decorated' pots were noticed among them. Trajanic-Antonine occupation (c. ioo-i8o) is attested by (in addition to the bulk of the samian) many of the grey sandy coarse wares, including BB2, fine grey wares from north Kent, a substantial number of mortaria (probably from minor kilns in south-eastern England) and perhaps some of the 'Cologne' rough-cast beakers, which were imported by the mid second century. In the absence of secure stratigraphy it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify the second-century and later East Sussex wares with any certainty, even though they must account for at least 50% of all the Trajanic-Antonine pottery. A group of poorly made local products, chiefly mortaria (Nos. 14-19), is thought to date to c. 150 or later, perhaps into the third century. It is almost certainly contemporary with the bath-house, since a small quantity of roof tiles was apparently made at the same workshop. A number of interesting vessels may represent a terminal group for the bath-house dating to 200-250. They are relatively well preserved and are fairly widespread in their sources. This material is at present best paralleled by imports in the waterfront groups of A.D. 180-22 found at New Fresh Wharf, City of London.34 It consists of Soller mortaria, jars, and beakers from northern France, Moselkeramik, Cologne colour-coated wares, Dorset BB I, and very possibly both the local products already mentioned and an interesting group of north-east Gaulish handmade grey wares. The group as a whole emphasizes the site's association with the Fleet and with cross-Channel 'trade.' Later material is present but sparse: it consists of Oxfordshire white and red wares and New Forest fine wares. Dorset BBI may also be later than 250. The apparent absence, however, of coarse wares from the Alice Holt and New Forest industries, the allied 'Portchester D' wares, the fourth-century 'Pevensey ware', and locally made grog-tempered wares with widely everted rims points to the virtual desertion of the site in the later third and fourth centuries. 3 C.M.

A mid second- to early third-century import from the Rhineland, commonly found in south-eastern England. Pure white fabric with very few inclusions and black slipped surfaces. Three forms are present: the familiar 'cornice-rimmed' beakers with roughcast clay pellet decoration beneath the slip and fragments of 'hunt beakers', which should date to the end of the second or early third centuries, are present in eIual quantities. The third form, a single very large roughcast beaker, is illustrated here.4 [Not illustrated] 'Moselkeramik'. Fragments of about five of the ill-named 'Rhenish ware' beakers are all from the East Gaulish (Moselle) source; Central Gaulish examples were not identified.45 Indented and folded beakers are present and should date to the late second or early third centuries. [No. 13] Soller mortaria. Sherds from five vessels of the distinctive form manufactured at the important workshop near Bonn. Pure white fabric with moderate amounts of sub-angular to rounded quartz, up to 0-5 mm in diameter, with a few flecks of red-brown iron ores. Grits abundant, of similar quartz ranging up to 2 mm in diameter. Late second to early third centuries.46 [Nos. 14-19] Locally made mortaria and bowl. These vessels clearly originate from a kiln on the Wealden clays at no great distance from the site. The kiln probably also produced a few of the relatively soft, orange-coloured unstamped roof tiles found on the site, since these are identical in fabric to the mortaria, but quite distinct from the white-streaked cherry-red CLBR tiles.47 Some fifteen mortaria were represented, of which five are illustrated, together with a bowl in the same fabric: bright pink, cream-pink, or orange-red, occasionally with a slight grey core, usually very soft and ill-fired. The matrix contains iron ore pellets (often spheroidal, 0.2-I.0 mm) and a very little fine quartz. Added tempering is most distinctive, consisting of a few to many well rounded white or grey quartz grits up to 7 mm in diameter, with some grog (as matrix) of similar size, and sparser crushed iron ores. The quartz grits form the trituration surface of the mortarium, but are present in the fabric of all the vessels and the tiles, and are rather abundant in the bowl [No. 19]. In thin section the fabric differs from that of stamped Wealden CLBR tiles in colour, and in the absence of the distinctive white silt and siltstone described by Peacock. The forms of the rather poorly thrown mortaria suggest a date after A.D. 150, and possibly as late as the early third century. [Not illustrated] Other mortaria.

Red-brown silty matrix, with grey margins and surfaces. Moderate quantities of sub-angular and rounded quartz, some iron ore, possibly flint/chert, and a few limestone inclusions, no larger than I-o mm, are seen in fracture and conspicuously on the surfaces. The hand-made (coiled) construction, easily recognized on the interior, is very distinctive, as is the decoration (on jars) of faintly scored criss-cross combing and single or double lines of square-tooth rouletting just below the rim, Romano-British hand-made 'grey wares' are extremely uncommon, so that this type should be easily recognizable elsewhere.

The remaining 17 were greenish colourless. Fourteen of the pieces had a rolled edge, the total length being 56 cm and the greatest length of an individual piece 9.5 cm. They varied in thickness between 2 mm and 3-5 mm, with the exception of one 5 mm thick example. Window glass of the matt-glossy variety is characteristic of the first to third centuries, although it is often found in later deposits. The double glossy variety belongs especially to the third and fourth centuries,6" and the total absence of this type of window glass would suggest that any glazing programme in this building was not undertaken during the late third or fourth centuries. Discussion This assemblage contains many of the well attested forms and techniques of the late first and second centuries (eg. the mould-blown bottles 8-13, and 23 body fragments, the flasks, 14 and 15 especially), and also a few fragments which immediately predate (the polychrome fragment (i) and the monochrome (2)) or postdate them (the colourless and wheel-incised fragments 3-7). Noticeable by their absence, however, are those forms and metals diagnostic of the late third and fourth centuries, which suggest that there was no glass supply to this site during this period. Of the main body of fragments, a few notable vessel types are worthy of further comment. The polychrome fragment is, sadly, too small and so badly distorted by its contact with fire to permit a more positive identification of its original form. Such metals do, however, normally occur in pre- or early Flavian contexts (eg. at Colchester), but the intrinsic value of such vessels must have been comparatively high, and so their retention may have been possible. The same would apply to the small rim fragment in an emerald-green metal. The bottles (Nos. 8-13) are a regular feature of any assemblage containing glassware of the late first and second centuries, but of interest here is the base fragment (No. I i) of a rectangular-sectioned bottle. Such bottles are by no means as common as the square- sectioned type (only forty among the 14oo bottles of prismatic form catalogued by the present author) and they do not appear to have continued long into the second century, as is the case with the square forms. The base design, that of a diamond with or without an internal circle, is well attested on bottles of this form (eg. Gors-Opleeuw, Abbeville, Boulogne, Rouen, Neris-les-Bains, London, Frankfurt, Bourges, Neuville-le-Pollet, Amiens). The concentration of this form in the Seine/Rhine region especially would suggest that this is the most likely region for its place of manufacture. Sadly, insufficient of the design on the Beauport Park specimen has survived to allow it to be mould-linked with any other example. The flasks (Nos. 14, 15) are another form that comes from the Seine/Rhine region61 and, together with the oil flasks (aryballoi) a form which might be expected to occur in a bath-house; the large number of narrow-necked liquid containers is probably worthy of note. Of these containers, the fragment from a ?feeding-bottle (No. 21) is somewhat exceptional. Such vessels are not common features among glass assemblages, not because they were not produced in large quantities but because broken fragments of them are often 6o D.B. Harden in A.C.C.

The Beauport Park example appears to have been flattened, the mouthpiece protruding from one side. The normal form (Isings62 Form 99) is associated with the later centuries of Roman rule. Finally, there is among the colourless fragments a small piece from the upper part of a beaker or bowl (No. 5) which had incised around the neck a short inscription (usually exhorting the drinker to indulge well and often) but only part of one letter survives here. These vessels are becoming more and more common as glass assemblages are being examined in detail. Their presence at Cologne63 and Trier14 has long been known. At Beauport Park this appears to be a vessel entering the settlement after the main supply, probably during the late second or early third century. Similar in date are the fragments from so-called 'barrel flasks' (Nos. 26-28), also known as 'Frontinus bottles' after the name or abbreviations of this name which appear on the bases. This bottle type is very common on the continent, especially in the Rhineland and northern and central France in third- and, in particular, fourth-century contexts. Although complete examples are rare, fragments of this form are now being identified on a number of late sites in Britain (eg. Frocester Court, Caerwent, Silchester, Shakenoak, Park Street villa). THE COINS Only fifteen coins were found during the excavations, six of which were unidentifiable, and only one (a sestertius of Lucilla) was stratified within the building itself (on the floor of Room IX). In addition, several coins were reported by Rock65 as having been found during Byner's clearance of the slag-heap, and several others were presented to the Hastings Museum in 1922 by Sir Charles Lamb, the owner of the Park (recorded as BB. 198-203, but only three now extant, re-registered as 922.37.1-3), and in 1934 by Matthew Wilkins, a friend of Ernest Straker (934.25). Given the date-range of the coins, it is not altogether surprising that so few were found, since this was a period when coin assemblages tend to be small, in contrast with the later third and fourth centuries. Since the excavation was carried out on a bath-house and most of the finds came from the surrounding slag-heap, moreover, the coin yield would not be expected to be as high as it might have been in a residential part of the settlement. The full list of coins reported or discovered is as follows: Domitian as [Seaby 811 or 813] Lamb as [Seaby 811 or 813] Lamb Trajan sestertius [Seaby 9oo or 908] Byner Hadrian sestertius [Seaby ?995] Excavation (2850) sestertius [Seaby ?1o34] Byner dupondius [Seaby 1027] Wilkins 62 Isings, op. cit.

All three objects were found in the slag-heap in the close vicinity of the bath-house] The silver ring A silver finger-ring, with hoop widening slightly towards the shoulders, which are leaf-shaped. The raised octagonal bezel contains a cornelian intaglio which projects very markedly. External diameter of ring 24 mm, internal diameter 18 mm, width across bezel 8 mm. The ring is comparable with examples from Wittering, Northants,6 and from Eining.67 The intaglio is of truncated cone shape,68 standing 2-75 mm above the bezel with an upper surface 6 mm x 4 mm. It is undamaged apart from a chip on the top edge, and bears the device of a ?hound leaping from a nautilus shell (towards the right on an impression). The subject is paralleled on a sardonyx intaglio from Colchester (with a hare shown below), a nicolo from Wroxeter, and on glass pastes from Lowbury Hill and Chesters.69 The spiral shell symbolizes the womb, and also rebirth,7J while the hound is well known as a chthonic animal.7' The subject not only alludes to a Roman's love of hunting and hare-coursing, but also to his hopes for the afterlife. 66 F.H.

Maaskant-Kleebrink72 comments that the 'bevelled obverse edges' used for flat gems of this style 'may suggest ringstone settings which protruded from the ring bezel' - and that was assuredly true in this case. The Colchester gem cited above is closely comparable in shape and style (though not in material) and is likewise set in a third-century silver ring. The intaglii Intaglio I (PL. XIVB) is a cornelian, reddish-brown in colour and somewhat cloudy. It has been cut to an ovoid shape (16-5 mm x 13.5 mm) and both surfaces are slightly convex. The sides are bevelled away from the upper surface to the lower; it is c. 2 mm thick. The highly polished condition of all unengraved areas suggests that the gem was lost not long after manufacture. The device represented is the goddess Victoria walking towards the right (as described from the impression); an impression of a similar gem on a pottery sherd is known from Vechten.73 The goddess is dressed in a chiton with overfold and her hair is arranged with a 'chignon' on the top of her head. In her left hand she holds a palm, which she also bears over her left shoulder, and in her right hand she clutches a wreath with which she is doubtless about to crown someone. Victory is frequently found on gems. The most interesting parallel to the Beauport Park stone is from Akenham, Suffolk,74 and inscribed with the name of the owner, Rubrius Carinus Orientalis dated to the third century). Similar intaglii, uninscribed, have been found at Colchester75 and Hardknott.76 There are numerous other signets extant showing Victory with wreath and palm, some distinguished (as here) by an attractive use of patterning, which is diagnostic of gems cut in late Antonine and Severan times.77 It is not likely that an ordinary miner or sailor would have been able to afford a signet as well cut as this, nor would the subject have been appropriate to anyone not imbued with an ideal of service to the Roman state. An intaglio from the Lullingstone villa,78 originally set in a gold ring, the mark of members of the ordo equester (though senatorials were presumably also allowed to wear gold rings), showing Victory inscribing a shield, certainly belonged to a member of the governing class. Here it is more appropriate to think of an officer of the Classis Britannica or a senior member of the Imperial procurator's staff. It is worth noting that signet devices were never selected at random,79 and so it would be natural to find a member of the Roman garrison of the province seeking the accolade of an appropriate deity. Intaglio 2 (PL. XIVC) is of plasma, emerald-green with black inclusions. It is oval in shape (i i mm x 9 mm X 2 mm), with a slightly convex upper surface and more markedly convex beneath. It has been published,s" but the dimensions given are rather too great. 72 M.

She wears a mantle which covers her knees but she is in the act of uncovering her body. This is an action associated with hermaphrodites in ancient art,8" but the wing clearly depicted behind the woman seems to invite an alternative explanation. It recalls the swan (ie. Jupiter in disguise) of which Leda became enamoured. Boardman identifies a similar cameo as Leda.82 Unlike Furtwangler and Boardman, I do not think that there was any intention to show the swan as such, but the wing is a convenient device which serves to label the subject. The only other gem from Britain which portrays Leda83 is a different type and later in date. Such plasmas of classicizing style are generally assignable to the first century A.D. The technique of modelling with a fairly thick rounded drill and the somewhat schematic detailing here recall a gem at The Hague,84 in the small groove style, which is dated to the first or early second century. Technically, Intaglio 2 is rather similar to the Victory gem, but is slightly later in date. OBJECTS OF METAL Brooches (by D.F. Mackreth) The two brooches examined are both of copper-alloy. I.

The bow has a rectangular cross-section and has, down the front, two recesses, the outer ones having buried bead-rows, and in the middle one there appears to be a series of circular recesses, each with a deeper central dot, but corrosion accretions hide the full detail. At the base of the bow is a projecting plate, circular in plan, beneath which is a concave bridging section, with a step at top and bottom, to the foot, and both bridge and foot have a median arris. The catch for the pin is an upright tube with a slot down the side. 2. TR.K/7.2. The spring is held like that in Brooch I. The wings are rounded and plain, except for a single step along the top. The bow has chamfered sides, a slot down the centre, and a cross-flute at the top. The bow has a repeat of the plate on Brooch I at its base, and there is a similar bridge beneath, but without steps. The foot has a repeat of the bow section. The catch is again like that of Brooch I, but the slot is slanted to suit a curved pin. The brooch was once tinned or silvered. Both brooches are obviously related; each show in the bow profile, the projecting plate with the concave face beneath, and the style of the foot that they are close to the earliest Crossbow brooches. The chief difference is the presence of a spring-case instead of narrow wings housing the axis bar for a hinged pin. Neither brooch is common in Britain, but it seems that the general type is not ubiquitous on the Continent either.

They form B6hme's Typ 25 and they are dated by her to the late second/early third century. The end of this range would suit the numbers of early Crossbows from these two sites,91 which came to an end around A.D. 260. The precise relationship between B3hme's Typ 25 and these early Crossbows is also not clear. The Beauport Park brooches lack knobs on their heads, and this may also be found on many early Crossbows. A connexion between the two is shown by a brooch from Caerleon, dated to the early third century,92 with a series of knobs along the bow as well as one on the head, but otherwise like the two under discussion. These knobs are repeated on an early Crossbow from Dura-Europos.93 While the writer has not recorded a brooch with knobs on the bow but without one on the head, attention is drawn to a specimen from South Shields equipped with both which has a buried bead row down each side of the bow.94 The same is to be seen on a brooch from Brancaster, which also has a sunken central zone with circular depressions down th- centre like those seemingly present on Beauport Park Brooch I.95 It may be that, rather than serving as decoration in their own right, these hollows once held separately made knobs that were fixed into them. As for plainer examples of B6hme's Typ 25, British dating, like that on the continent, is circumstantial: one was found in the soil sealing the demolished Classis Britannica fort at Dover, which contained little material later than the second quarter of the third century.96 It will not have escaped notice that the British sites mentioned have important Severan activity and, at Brancaster, it is arguable that that was the earliest on the site. The evidence tends to support B6hme's dating of the late second to early third century. BONE PINS (by S.J. Greep) [The types are as Greep, forthcoming] I [2803] Type A2.

INSCRIPTIONS AND GRAFFITI The inscription One of the most important finds from the bath-house was made before excavations proper began. An exploratory trench had been dug carefully with a mechanical excavator on the presumed site of the building identified using divining rods by one of the present authors (GB). As soon as masonry walls were struck, the mechanical digger stopped work and the archaeological excavation began. In clearing up the debris from the mechanical excavator trench, an inscribed stone (FIG. I I) was found, lying some 2 m from the entrance to the building into Room II. The following report, by Mr M.W.C. Hassall, was published in the 'Roman Britain in 1970' section in Britannia ii (197I), 289: 'Part of a sandstone building inscription, 0-28 by 0O23 by O-12 m, found in 1970 lying with other collapsed building material on a roadway, 2 m south of a building connected with the iron-working site. A string moulding and plain raised border survive on the lower edge of the stone only, but the die also appears to be complete in the bottom left-hand corner. The text reads: .. AV] GA[... ...

In either case the position after the main verb is strange. In line 5 the letters are smaller and inset as if forming the end of a word too long to fit completely in the preceding line'. It is now assumed that this inscription records the fact that the vilicus or foreman of the ironworks had given orders for a reconstruction or expansion of the bath-house and that the man in charge of the work was one Bassus or Bassianus. The significance of this inscription is discussed above. Despite painstaking and prolonged searches, the remainder of this inscription, which might yield dating information, has never come to light.

Similar double strips and lobate intersections occur at Billingsgate Buildings.97 Leather: cattle. Length: 115 mm, back seam height: 74 mm. Wood 6 Roman wooden sole, almost complete. Wooden sole for left foot in five major parts and fragments, almost complete, the area of the outside toe, broad tread, waist, and seat. Carved in one piece with a thick heel lift. Two nail-holes with iron corrosion stains are visible on the exterior edge of the sole in the area of the waist spaced c. 52 mm apart, indicating the position of the upper attachment. No other nail-holes are visible, suggesting that these holes had nails present at the time of deposition, the subsequent constriction of the wood obliterating the holes without nails. Width: tread 96 mm, waist 8o mm, seat 76 mm. Heel height: 25-15 mm. Sole thickness: 11-9 mm. The leather shoes The leather from Beauport Park represents three distinct types of shoe construction: the nailed shoe, the stitched shoe, and the one-piece shoe. These shoe types can all be paralleled by finds from Billingsgate Buildings, London,98 a collection thought typical of first- to second-century footwear from the northern Roman provinces;99 the Beauport Park leather is likely to be of similar date. The small quantity and nature of the finds suggests that the shoes were casually discarded after use rather than representing cobbling or leather- working waste. Nailed shoes The bottom unit (3) comprising an insole and sole with Type B nailing, 1"" a fragment of insole (i), and a fragment of insole/middle (2) with Type B nailing come from nailed shoes, the most commonly found Roman shoe type. The insole fragment (I) with Type A nailing has central thonging; however, the bottom unit (3) and the insole/middle fragment (2) have neither central thonging nor tunnel stitching visible, suggesting two differing methods of construction. The insole/middle fragment (2) has three slits present in the seat area on the flesh side which may be from a repair. " M. Rhodes in Jones, op. cit. (note 39)- 98 ibid. 99 ibid., 128. 100 ibid., o105-7.</page><page sequence="49">THE CLASSIS BRITANNICA BATH-HOUSE AT BEAUPORT PARK 265 Stitched shoe The sole of a light, stitched shoe (4), probably for indoor wear, has tunnel stitching around the perimeter where the insole was attached to the flesh side, and the impression of thread from the tunnel stitching of the upper to the underside of the insole. Similar stitched shoes have been found in Britain and on the Continent (eg. London, Bar Hill, Saalburg, Zugmantel).11"" One-piece shoe The fragments from a one-piece shoe (5) have a back seam with edge/flesh stitching and an openwork side with two ankle loops with a double strip border and decorative lobate intersections. Like the stitched shoe, one-piece shoes have been found in Britain and on the Continent (eg. London, Carlisle, Newstead, Vindolanda, Valkenburg, Saalburg, Zug- mantel, and Kleiner Feldberg).102 Shoe sizes Whilst an experiment initiated by J.H. Thornton suggests that leather shrinkage during burial may be estimated at io%, further allowance should be made for differential directional shrinkage during conservation. For this reason estimation of original shoe size is unreliable. Some points may, nevertheless, be made. The bottom unit (3) with Type B nailing appears relatively small, Adult size I (English Shoe-Size Scale) when allowance has been made for io% shrinkage; similarly, the stitched shoe (4) measures an Adult size 3. These shoes would seem to be more likely to have been worn by women or adolescents than adult men. The shoe types agree with this in that both types appear to be more frequently found in children's and women's sizes (eg. at Billingsgate Buildings)."13 The wooden shoe The large wooden shoe sole (6) has been carved from a single piece of alder. It is unusual in having no lift across the forepart, only a broad heel at the seat, giving it the appearance of a clog. Two nail-holes visible in the edge of the sole at the waist suggest that a leather or possibly textile upper was present over the instep, probably in the form of a large strap. The seat and waist area of a child's wooden sole of similar shape, also with a nail-hole in the edge at the waist, is in the Museum of London's collection (MOL Accession no 78.93), but is unfortunately unprovenanced. The Beauport Park sole is large and likely to be for a man's foot. Wooden-soled shoes (sculponeae) were worn to raise the feet from the hot floor of the bath-house, and the Beauport Park example is likely to be associated with the bath-house and to be of that date. Of course, the wooden-soled shoes without thonging may have been used as pattens to raise the wearer above the mud of the streets, as were their medieval and post-medieval counterparts. (The leather was surface-cleaned or freeze-dried as appropriate by Ebenezer Kotei under the supervision of Jacqui Watson at the Ancient Monuments Laboratory, Historical Buildings and Monuments Commission for England. The wooden sole was conserved by Colin Slack by replacing the water with polyethylene glycol. I wish to thank Christine Jones of the Museum of London Roman Department for showing me the two wooden soles in the collection and Jacqui Watson for the AML for the wood identification.)

XVA) Two fragments of clay statuettes were found, one inside the bath-house and the other outside. They were submitted to Dr Frank Jenkins, who kindly provided the following information: I A head which definitely belongs to a figurine of the DEA NUTRIX type, showing a goddess suckling an infant. In Britain similar detached heads have been found at Reculver, Cliffe, and Cirencester. A complete example comes from a grave at Welwyn. Five examples from France can be seen in the Musee National at St-Germain-en-Laye; one comes from Toulon-sur-Allier, where kilns and moulds for such figurines have been found. Another version, with a larger head and twin infants, has been found complete at Canterbury, and there are detached heads from Hassocks and Rawreth.104 2 A domed base showing two feet is evidently part of a statuette of the so-called Pseudo-Venus type. This, too, was manufactured in central Gaul, possibly at Toulon- sur-Allier.105 CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS Brick and tile In 1968, before the bath-house was discovered, a tile bearing the stamp of the Classis Britannica had been found by the stream at Beauport Park, and so, when excavations began, the decision was taken to examine every scrap of tile found on the site and to record the total weight. It was evident from the outset that the bath-house had not been deliberately demolished or robbed subsequently: it had simply collapsed into ruin and had been buried by many tons of slag and other refuse. This considerable survival of constructional material provided a unique opportunity to record the tile in detail. It fulfilled a wish once expressed to one of the authors (HC) by the late Sir Ian Richmond to find such a site and carry out what he described as 'a quantity survey in reverse.' A full report on the tile from Beauport Park has already been published,1 6 and the detailed findings will not be recapitulated here. The total weight of tile was 12-8 tons, made up of 4-4 tons of tegula, 3"6 tons of bricks of all sizes, 1-5 tons of box-flue, I'3 tons of imbrex, o-9 tons of voussoir, and o-9 tons of unidentifiable fragments, all from a building that covers no more than 114 m2. Yet even this great quantity of tile does not account for all that estimated as having originally been used: there must have been some removal of roof tiles at the time the building was abandoned. It is possible to calculate the quantity of tegulae and imbrices represented by all the excavated fragments in several ways: I by weight; 2 by measurement of the side pieces; 3 by counting the corner fragments; 4 by counting the stamps. 104 British Museum Guide to Roman Antiquities (1951), 62 and fig. 30. 1o5 F. Jenkins, Arch. Cant. lxxii (1958), 60-76. 1o6 G. Brodribb, Britannia x (1979), 139-56. The subject is covered exhaustively in G. Brodribb, Roman Brick and Tile (Gloucester, 1987).</page><page sequence="51">THE CLASSIS BRITANNICA BATH-HOUSE AT BEAUPORT PARK 267 Using these four independent criteria, the figures for complete tiles work out at: I 2 3 4 weight sides corners stamps tegulae 748 558 545 454 imbrices 542 566 487 459 + 90 unstamped These totals represent only a minimum figure, since some tile must have disintegrated completely, but it represented an attempt to compare the amount of tile originally used (the number of tegulae has been estimated as 1200) with the surviving remains, an exercise that is rarely possible for a Roman site. Other information that has resulted from this analysis is evidence that there were nail-holes on about one in five of the tegulae examined, suggesting perhaps that only the lowest course was nailed. The 42 undamaged tegulae found (which average 5-8 kg in weight) and the 57 complete imbrices (average 2.45 kg) all provided evidence of types and features. Several box-tiles survived in situ (see above) but only six complete specimens, of two sizes, were found in the debris. A check on the fragments showed that 70% were scored on the face, the remainder being combed in 26 different ways. Weighing suggested that there had been a total of some 260 box-tiles; most of these came from Room I which, if fully jacketed, would have required 178 box-tiles (assuming that the walls were originally 2.3 m high). The filling in and around the later bath (Room X) contained many fragments of hollow voussoirs; the tops and bottoms of these are distinctive and, although only two complete specimens were found, fracture usually took place at the angles, producing many easily countable single parts. Remarkably, analysis showed that there were 246 tops and 242 bottoms, giving a minimum original total. Flat brick is heavy and, since little came from the floors, which for the most part remained intact, the fragments from the filling must have come from arches round internal windows or doorways, or from a possible capping course running round the tops of the walls. The only tile at present visible in the walls is an external course which may represent the floor level. Investigation of some of the intact floors showed that the covering of the junction of the flues was made by a bipedalis tile with its four mammae bedded face-down into the mortar. There are many features on tiles which have long been disregarded. The commonest is the mark, often semicircular, put on the face of tegulae or brick that seems to have been the mark or signature of the maker; 27 different such signatures have been found at Beauport Park. On imbrices there is either a signature or, far more commonly, a stamp. Another feature on tegulae and all forms of brick is what seems to be numbering cut on the edge. Since this may refer to batches or production quantities it is referred to as a tally-mark. Such marks are found on tiles from all the Classis Britannica sites and on some military sites, but they have seldom been mentioned before those from Beauport Park were reported. Over ioo tiles carry all three features (stamp, signature, and tally-mark) and some attempt has been made to correlate these.107 The tile at Beauport Park appears not to have been made locally: samples of clay were taken from various parts of the Park as well as from a brickworks known to have been flourishing there a century ago, but the fabric from these was quite unlike that of the 07 Brodribb, op. cit. (note io6), 155</page><page sequence="52">268 GERALD BRODRIBB AND HENRY CLEERE Roman tiles from the bath-house. It may, therefore, be assumed that this was brought in from some central Fleet depot not yet discovered.1s8 There are also a few pieces of 'imported' brick which have been identified by Peacock as being of Gaulish origin; Gaulish tile has also been found at Lympne and Dover. Stamps Like other authorities, both civil and military, the Classis Britannica usually stamped tile and brick used in its establishments. Ten sites in Britain and Boulogne on the other side of the Channel have produced tiles stamped with the letters CL BR. Most of these are coastal but, because the Fleet had a close connexion with iron production in the Weald, stamped tile also occurs at certain inland ironmaking sites. The whole subject has been fully surveyed'09 and will not be discussed further here. Some 26% of the 16Io stamps recorded at Beauport Park were complete, and 56 different varieties have been recorded. Of these, 27 were single examples, which is not easy to explain. There is a wide range of styles and forms of stamp, though Brodribb's (1969) Type I has been found on seven out of the ten sites so far known, and may be a prototype. The large quantity of stamps from Beauport Park has provided a wealth of information. For example, certain stamps are associated with certain types of tile, and it has proved possible to link a particular stamp with a special type of tegula cut-out. Some stampers always put the stamp in the same location, some put it on twice, and sometimes the stamp has been cut retrograde. Such features make it possible for a personal identity to be established. Impressions on tile The 12-8 tons of tile found at Beauport Park produced many types of impression, including those of animals and birds, human feet and fingers, boots and sandals, textiles, a fernleaf, and raindrops. The 173 examples (excluding the numerous fingerprints) are made up as follows: Animal Dog 90 Cat 22 Sheep/goat 12 Bird 3 Small mammal 3 Horse I Piglet I Unidentified io 142 Human Feet 15 Boots 8 23 Others Textile 3 Raindrops 4 Fernleaf I 8 The analysis of the animal prints was kindly made by S. Bayliss Smith, Warden of Selwyn's Wood, Heathfield, East Sussex. The largest dog print was from an animal not so large as a labrador, some tiles carry impressions of both dog and cat, one sequence of dog prints runs "'1 See Peacock, op. cit. (note 49).

Another shows the prints of a sheep and a lamb side by side. Of the 173 examples only two occur on imbrices, one of a cat and the other a dog's claw mark that has torn away the edge of the tile, suggesting that the dog had to reach up to a tile drying on a raised rack. This is useful evidence about the methods of production: there is only one other example known of similar claw marks, on tile from Silchester. The relative rarity of raindrop impressions suggests that tiles were usually laid out to dry under cover. Of the thirteen examples of human prints, two are complete and eleven partial. Two are clearly made by children, but some of the toe prints are large and deeply impressed. Of the eight impressions of the studs of some form of footwear, one shows a complete boot impression, with an overall length of 28 cm. There is also a unique imprint of a wooden tile comb engraved with the letters CLBR put on beside a normal stamp. IM Fingermarks and fingerprints were too numerous to record, but it was noticeable that they tended to occur at the point of balance in the middle of imbrices and inside the edges of cut-outs on box-tile, made perhaps when the tile was drawn from the form. The underside of one complete bessalis has a very clear impression of what seems to be the leaf of a fern. Four fragments of bessalis, all bearing a Brodribb's (1969) Type 20 stamp, have a number of minute holes within the area of the stamp. These seemed at first to be the result of some objects such as seeds having been impressed into the tile, leaving small cavities when they decayed or were burnt out, but closer inspection shows that they were formed by the bursting of very small bubbles formed during firing. The connexion with the stamp is not easy to explain. Dr J.P. Wild has provided the following notes on the textile impressions. 2599 (from a complete pila tile). Half-basket weave: System (I), singles, c. 8 threads per cm, wide spaced; System (2), doubles, 9-IO pairs per cm. About 3 cm2 can be seen. The spin directions cannot be identified. 3366 (from the inside of a fragment of box-tile). Fine half-basket weave: System (i), singles, Z-spun, 12-13 threads per cm, fine yarn fairly well spaced, maximum length 2-30 cm; System (2), doubles, probably Z-spun, c. Io pairs per cm, possibly the same yarn as in (i), maximum length 2 cm+. 3771 (from the edge of a brick). Perhaps a plain weave, but the details are not clear. Textile impressions have often been noted on fired clay and on tiles in Roman Britain.11" Such impressions are normally the result of an accident, either because a loose scrap of fabric has stuck to the wet clay or someone has touched it with his or her clothing. At Colchester, for example, a potter lining his kiln accidentally leaned against the kiln wall.112 In the Lincolnshire salterns, the briquetage sometimes carries the marks of clothing or sacking.113 Usually the weave recorded from such impressions is plain weave or half-basket weave, but inside a box-tile from the bath-block at Walldilrn on the Upper German limes t Brodribb, op. cit.

It is becoming increasingly clear that half-basket weave was more popular than the evidence suggested ten years ago. A number of unpublished examples may be cited, suggesting that it was more widely employed than full basket weave. The chimney pot The chimney pot (PL. XV B) was found laying on the floor of the frigidarium (Room II), in a layer of silt some 20 cm deep. It had been placed on the floor and had not fallen from the roof, since the roof debris was above the silt layer in which the chimney pot was found. It was virtually complete, lacking only a 30 cm long section of the middle flange; this was subsequently found in the same layer some 3 m away. Details of the chimney pot were supplied to the late A.W.G. Lowther but were omitted from his paper on these objects;15 a short report has been published elsewhere.16 It has two tiers of four triangular cut-outs facing one another and was made of a pale orange tile-like fabric with a slip (though most of the slip has flaked off). There was no sign of soot or smoke blackening in the interior. Three fragments of another chimney pot, similar in form and fabric, were found in the filling of the adjacent caldarium (Room I). Of the chimney pots surveyed by Lowther, that from Leigh Sinton'17 is closest in form to the Beauport Park example. The latter is, however, considerably larger, since it stands 47 cm high, the diameter of the base is 21 cm, and the wall thickness is 3.2 cm. Two other fragmentary cylindrical clay artefacts were also found which may also have been chimney pots, but they lack the cut-outs of the specimens mentioned above. The masonry As soon as it was realized that the sandstone walls of the bath-house still stood to a considerable height, it seemed essential to make a detailed count of all the fallen masonry, in the hope that this would enable the building as a whole to be evaluated. First, a sample section of the wall was fully recorded in order to calculate the size of an 'average' block of dressed sandstone. The section chosen was that to the east of the entrance to the building via Room II, where seven courses stood level and intact above the externally visible tile course. This section was 3-40 m long, 0o-85 m high, and 0-65 m thick. The length was made up of eleven pieces, the thickness of four pieces, and the height of seven courses, making 308 pieces in all. The overall volume was 1.88 m3, but this volume was not entirely accountable as masonry, since there was mortar between the stones averaging 2 cm thick. The average dimensions of the 308 pieces calculated from the block measured were O*29 m ?0 o15 mx o. io m; this was adopted as a standard unit for counting purposes. The make-up of this sample section was as follows: Masonry + Mortar = Wall Height 7 X0 o-1o = 0-70 7 x 0-02-=0O-I4 o-84 m Thickness 4 X o0-15 = o-60 3 X 0-02 = oO6 0o-66 m Length II x? 029 x 3-19 To X 0.02 = 0.20 3-39 m 114 Saalburg-Jahrbuch xxxv (1978), lo6ff. 115 A.W.G.

(note I15), pl. ivb.</page><page sequence="55">THE CLASSIS BRITANNICA BATH-HOUSE AT BEAUPORT PARK 271 The volume of the 308 blocks without mortar is 1.34 m3 and so, as the whole section has a volume of 1.88 m3, the masonry accounts for 71% of the total and the mortar for 29%. From figures based on this sample section it was possible to estimate the volume of the walls of the whole building, excluding the apsidal hot bath (Room VII) and the two stoke-holes, the dimensions of which were irregular. The overall length of walling came to 75 m (82 m less 7 m for the doorways and window spaces) and the width of the wall averaged o-65 m. Now came the unknown quantity, the original internal height of the walls. It seemed that a height of 2.30 m might be a reasonable figure and, if this is assumed, the total volume of walling would be 75 m x o-65 mx 2*30 m = 112 m3, of which, on the basis of the sample section, 71% (80-2 m3) was masonry. In the sample section 1-34 m3 of masonry comprised 308 unit blocks, so every cubic metre would require 230 blocks. Thus the walling above floor level for the whole building would require 8o*2 X 230 = 18,400 units. The bath-house has, however, raised floors to allow space for the hypocaust system in every room except one (II), giving an extra depth of o-65 m and adding another 31-7 m3 to the total volume for the whole building. Only 71% of this is masonry, however, so the figure is reduced to 22-5 m3, made up of 5175 units, which makes a full total of 23,575 units of masonry. A count of the tumbled masonry was made from the very start by weighing several level-filled loads of a particular wheelbarrow. This gave an average load quantity of 8-89 units with an average weight of 74.8 kg (165 lb). It was satisfying to find that the original estimated standard unit proved to be almost exactly the same as that proved for the sample section. By i January 1987 8525 units had been logged, weighing over 70 tons. One point arises: this total includes the debris from the barrel-vaults over Rooms IV and V, each consisting of a single course of masonry. Each room has an area of 10-5 m2, making a combined area of 2I m2. The curvature would increase this by about one-third, bringing the figure up to 28 m2, made up of 83% masonry and 17% mortar. It was calculated that I m2 of roof requires 20 units of masonry, so the two barrel-vaults would have needed 28 X 20 = 56o units, and this figure must be deducted from the total of 81I25 units in any calculation relating to the walls alone. This gives a total of 7565 units of fallen masonry from the walls, equal to 32% of the estimated whole 23,575 units. It is believed that another 1200 units may still remain in unexcavated areas to the north and south-east of the building, giving a total of some 8700oo units of fallen masonry, equivalent to 37% of the whole, which means that 63% of the original walls above floor level are still standing, an impression borne out by a study of the building as excavated. The barrel-vaulted roofs over Rooms IV and V had collapsed into the rooms in large, rounded sections, several of which clearly showed their curvature, whilst other segments had a double tile course made of bessales, which seemed to have filled the role of a keystone. Very few pieces of masonry have been examined with a volume of over 8300oo cm3. The largest measures 53 cm X 25 cm x io cm and still had some mortar attached to it. Mortar is rare, but there are some pieces which show the angles of a joint. Many pieces of masonry seem to have been well shaped and show the marks of the mason's chisel. A few have very smooth prepared faces, one seems to have been hollowed out to make a rough bowl, and others show marks consistent with their having been used to sharpen edge tools (cf. the sides of the water tanks at Corbridge). In front of the entrance a number of large rough flat pieces of sandstone were found, which are interpreted as having formed a walkway up to the door bridging the drainage gully that ran down that side of the building.</page><page sequence="56">272 GERALD BRODRIBB AND HENRY CLEERE Wall plaster Painted wall plaster survives in situ in three rooms - the frigidarium (II), with large patches of maroon plaster, the cold plunge bath (II), which had two phases of painting, one of which covers the original drain exit, and the later tepidarium (IV), where plaster covered part of an infill made to reduce the width of the doorway into the caldarium (I). Fragments of plaster were found in and above the silt layers in several of the rooms and in building debris elsewhere. In no case, unfortunately, had large sections of plaster fallen from the walls and survived face down but intact; the evidence from the silting layers was for slow progressive deterioration and detachment. There was, moreover, no trace of plaster in the rooms added when the bath-house was reconstructed. Every fragment of plaster larger than 2 cm square was measured; the total weight of all the fragments recovered came to 38-6 kg, of which about two-thirds derived from Room II. The area covered by the 73 measured fragments came to only 1-92 m2. Of the single-coloured fragments, 243 were maroon, 117 white, 120 cream (mostly from Room V), and 47 yellow (all from Room II); the last-named were probably associated with a motif of maroon squiggles on a yellow background. The largest fragment measured 28 cm X 12 cm. Another large piece of white plaster was 17 cm square; this tapers off in a curve, suggesting an edge. There were 27 other pieces of edges or mouldings from a dado or frieze, almost all from Room II, and they had a variety of forms. There were 58 examples of stripes superimposed on a white or maroon surface. The most variegated piece had bands of white, maroon, yellow and rose. Two fragments showed bands at right-angles which may have formed panels. Another decoration was formed of a curved band of maroon 4 cm wide, with a series of irregular sweeps of the brush set on a yellow background. One piece of yellow/maroon decoration was found in situ in the north-west corner of Room II, 50 cm above floor level: it seemed to have slipped from above. There were 50 fragments in 15 varieties in which a fresh coat had been put over an earlier one. The new layer tended to be thickly laid in a rough, blotchy texture, and was white or mauve with a ribbed surface. There were seven examples showing spots of paint splashed over the surface; the spots were usually black on a white surface which had been superimposed over a maroon background. Similar spotted decoration to imitate marble has been found elsewhere in Britain.'s Eleven different colours were found, many in Room II. Basic surfaces were cream (Rooms IV and V), a dirty white (Room III, the cold bath), white (Room II), maroon (Rooms II and V), yellow (Room II), and mauve superimposed on white and maroon. A pale green also occurs on some fragments of moulding. Bands of colour painted on a basic surface included yellow, rose, red and black, and there was a single example of a blue band. The general effect of such mostly pastel colours must have been very light and pleasant. THE ANIMAL BONES (by Mary Harman) A total of 350 animal bones were found during the excavations. Most of these came from the area surrounding the building, though some were in the redeposited filling of the bath-house itself. The species identified and numbers of bones counted are shown in Table II. Most of the bones were identifiable, though fragmentary. The preservation was variable, some being very poorly preserved while others were in excellent condition. The quantity 118 J. Liversidge, Britain in the Roman Empire (London, 1968), 87.</page><page sequence="57">THE CLASSIS BRITANNICA BATH-HOUSE AT BEAUPORT PARK 273 was small and little can be concluded from a sample of this size. Most of the bones appeared to be domestic refuse. There were parts of two dog skeletons, one a puppy. The relative proportions of cattle, sheep, pig, and deer were unusual. Cattle predominate in numbers of bone fragments, and pigs appear in greater number than sheep/goats. The number of deer bones is large for such a small group and the total assemblage suggests a wooded environment rather than large areas of pasture. A few of the pig bones were very large and may have come from wild animals rather than domestic ones. The most interesting examples were: i The part skeleton of a puppy dog under one-year-old found among the pilae of the hypocaust in Room I. 2 Numerous parts of antler, some very large, and six tines, indicating a red deer stag of four years or more, killed between September and April, found alongside the later praefurnium (Room XI). 3 A hornless cattle skull, badly broken and eroded but probably originally complete, with adult teeth in wear, over four-years-old, found lying on the floor of the apodyterium (Room IX). There are other examples of ox skulls in buildings, and these may be connected with some form of ritual. They include: Lullingstone,119 'Two ox-skulls were found to have been placed in the heat-channel [of the heated room], one just inside the arch to the right, the other along by the north wall. One was smashed, but the other remained complete, though in both cases the horns had been removed. It is just possible that they formed a rough-and-ready ritualistic deposit; ox-skulls have been found so used elsewhere.' Verulamium.121) 'In the triangular temple in the floor immediately behind the altar, in a cavity roughly lined with roof tiles, was inserted the skull of an ox - doubtless from a dedication sacrifice of the restored temple.
