A discussion of this class of ob- ject leads on to a consideration of broader issues surrounding the nature and extent of Philia settlement. These pendants appear to have played a significant role in pro- claiming and maintaining Philia identity and demonstrate an aspect of bidirectional interaction between Philia and Late Chalcolithic communities. he Philia facies, which constitutes the earli- est form of the Early Cypriot Bronze Age, is a distinctive archaeological entity, character- ized by a number of specific material items (Webb and Frankel 1999). Its beginnings overlap chrono- logically with the final stages of the Cypriot Chalco- lithic in the mid-third millennium B.C.E. and include many of the wide array of new technologies and types that set the Bronze Age apart from the earlier cul- tural system. The relationship between the two "cul- tures" has been the subject of considerable debate for over 50 years, since the pioneering work of Di- kaios and Stewart (Webb 2002a). The development of the Bronze Age is seen variously as the result of internal processes operating independently of or in response to contacts with and influences from Ana- tolia (Stewart 1962: 296; Hennessy 1974; Watkins 1981: 19; Swiny 1986: 33-40; Knapp 1990; 1994; Manning 1993), or as directly reflecting the move- ment of peoples from Anatolia to Cyprus (Dikaios 1946; 1953: 323-24; 1962: 202-3; Catling 1971; Peltenburg 1996: 17-27). Our own view has devel- oped as a result of the first extensive excavation of a Philia phase settlement at Marki Alonia in cen- tral Cyprus (Frankel and Webb 1996a; 1996b; 1997; 1999; 2000; 2001). Elsewhere we have presented detailed arguments for a mid-third millennium fo- cal migration into northwest Cyprus of autonomous groups from western Anatolia (Webb and Frankel 1999; Frankel, Webb, and Eslick 1996; Webb 2002b; Frankel 2000). This has given rise to renewed con- troversy (Knapp 2001), which continues to polarize around opposing models of internal restructuring and migration. The beginning of the Bronze Age coincided with a significant restructuring of preexisting social patterns and involved the establishment of new settlements and resource networks. Philia communities targeted the cupriferous zone of the northwestern Troodos, at the same time establishing villages in agriculturally productive terrain, along transportation routes and at coastal outlets (Webb and Frankel 1999: 40). This new settlement pattern, which owed much to imported tech- nologies, resulted in the first systematic exploitation of the copper resources of the northern Troodos and the opening up of previously marginal areas to plow-based agriculture. While some Philia foundations were short- lived, elsewhere their distinctive stylistic traits de- veloped into those characteristic of the Early Cypriot period. This process is currently visible only in exca- vated data from Marki but may be inferred for the set- tlements associated with known Philia burial grounds at Philia Laksia tou Kasinou, Dhenia Kafkalla, Nico- sia Ayia Paraskevi, and Sotira Kaminoudhia. This article takes as a starting point a carved shell pendant of diagnostic Philia type.' From a discussion 1The pendant was recently identified by Mrs. Eve Stewart and Dr. Kathryn Eriksson. We are grateful to them and to Christopher Davey, Director of the Australian Institute of Archaeology, Mel- bourne, for allowing us to publish it. We also thank Dr. Maria Rosaria Belgiorno for providing information on the unpublished pendant from her excavations at Pyrgos Mavrorakia. The Mylos pendant was drawn and photographed by Wei Ming. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 FRANKEL AND WEBB BASOR 336 of this class of objects, we move on to consider broader issues surrounding the nature and extent of Philia settlement. The pendant was found by Mr. Tryphon Kouler- mos in January 1961 and was exported to Australia by the late James Stewart, along with other excava- tion and survey material, over 40 years ago.2 It was noted in passing by Stewart in his major study on the Early Cypriot Bronze Age as coming from "Mylos on the Kyrenia Pass" (1962: 264)-the main route linking the north coast with the Ovgos River valley and the center of the island. While "Mylos" (mill) is a relatively common topographic name, the locality in question is almost certainly that listed by Good- win (1977: 163) under Bogazi Mylos, about 1 mile northwest of the Kyrenia Pass on the Nicosia-Kyre- nia road "at the sharp bend below Bellapais farm." The pendant was found on the surface but, given its fragility and fine state of preservation, it is unlikely to have been exposed for any length of time. This suggests that a Philia site is located in the vicinity, from which the pendant had eroded or been exposed through looting or recent activity. The shell pendant (figs. 1, 2) is an oval ring 37 x 41 mm in diameter, ending in a slight point at one end and with a small 3 x 4 mm lozenge- or arrow- shaped spur at the other. The ring surrounding the 23 x 25 mm central hole varies from 5 to 7 mm in width and from 2 to 3 mm in thickness. The shell is curved with a naturally smooth inner (concave) surface and a somewhat rougher outer (convex) surface. At the pointed end is a small (1 mm) perforation, drilled from the convex side. A cardboard label attached to the pendant reads "Mylos (East) SSE of Kyrenia" on one side and "'Fish' amulet picked up by Tryphon Koulermos" on the other. The Australian Institute of Archaeology catalog number is IA2.1990. Pendants of this type are variously referred to as "fish amulets" (Stewart 1962: 264, 356; Hennessy, Eriksson, and Kehrberg 1988: 14-15, 17), "anthro- pomorphic figurines (pendants)" (Swiny 2003a: 236), and "spurred annular pendants" (Peltenburg 1998a: 189; Webb and Frankel 1999: 34). They Are one of Fig. 1. Shell pendant from Mylos.

While the majority are carved in picrolite, a fine-grained pale blue stone used extensively during the Chalcolithic period in Cyprus (Xenophontos 1991; Peltenburg 1991), some, like that from Mylos, are of marine shell, others are of bone, and one unpublished ex- ample from Deneia is of copper or bronze. More than 2Koulermos worked for many years as foreman on Stewart's excavations in Cyprus. We are grateful to Dr. Robert Merrillees for information on the date and place of the discovery of the pen- dant, which he recorded in his diary for 9 January 1961. He notes that it was found at "Mylos (West)," while the pendant's accom- panying label identifies the find spot as "Mylos (East)." This may refer to each side of the Nicosia-Kyrenia road or the Kyrenia Pass- Bellapais road, if the find spot is that of Bogazi Mylos.</page><page sequence="3">2004 AN EARLY BRONZE AGE SHELL PENDANT 3 0 2 cm I I Fig. 2. Shell pendant from Mylos. Australian Institute of Archaeology IA2.1990. one species of shell was used, but as yet these have not been identified. These pendants typically take the form of a flat, circular, or oval ring with a small drilled perforation at one extremity and a spurred or arrow-shaped pro- jection at the other (Stewart 1962: 356, Type NIdl, fig. 105.10-11). Although similar, there is some vari- ation in the overall size and shape and in the presence and dimensions of the extremities. Notably, with one exception, pendants from the southern site of Sotira Kaminoudhia differ from those from other sites in having a distinct elongated "head" through which the suspension hole is drilled. These belong to Stewart's variant Type NId2 (1962: 356, fig. 105.12), otherwise represented by only one other example, frorr Nicosia Ayia Paraskevi Tomb 9 (Hennessy, Eriksson, and Kehr- berg 1988: 17, no. 20, fig. 17). This feature, together with a slight swelling on either side of the ring below the head on a shell example, led Swiny to identify the Sotira pendants as anthropomorphic (Swiny 2003a: 236). Most pendants come from cemeteries. This, how- ever, may simply reflect the predominance of exca- vated cemetery over settlement sites. Three picrolite and 17 shell pendants were recovered from Philia Laksia tou Kasinou Tombs 1, 2, and 4 (Dikaios 1962: 174, 176, figs 84:18-24, LII.14). Nicosia Ayia Pa- raskevi Tomb 4, an undisturbed pit grave with a single burial, produced 37 picrolite examples and several pendants of other types, as well as a spindle whorl, 8 copper earrings, a necklace of 596 disk- shaped stone beads, and a bone pin (Hennessy, Eriks- son, and Kehrberg 1988: 14-15, fig. 25). In this instance, the pendants were clearly not worn singly, nor does it appear likely that they were earrings. All 37 are similar in size and may have been compo- nents of the disk-bead or a second necklace. Tomb 9 at Nicosia Ayia Paraskevi produced six smaller spurred annular picrolite pendants associated with an unknown number of disturbed burials (Hennessy, Eriksson, and Kehrberg 1988: 17, fig. 17). At Sotira Kaminoudhia seven picrolite pendants and one of shell were recovered in Tomb 15, where they prob- ably formed part of a necklace together with 132 miniature disk beads (Swiny 2003a: 276, fig. 6.16, pl. 6.4a). With the exception of the shell example, which is somewhat larger, they are also of similar size (12.4-14.6 mm long). The necklace appears to have been associated with an adult of uncertain sex (Schulte Campbell 2003: 429). At Kissonerga Mos- philia, 19 Dentalium beads and a shell spurred an- nular pendant were found with skull fragments of a male juvenile in Late Chalcolithic (Period 4) Grave 529 (Peltenburg 1998a: 190, figs. 4.11, 55, pl. 37.2, 1998b: 237-238). There are four unpublished pen- dants from Deneia, probably from a single Philia tomb (Cyprus Museum 1996 XII-17-14 a, b). Three of these are of shell and one is of copper or bronze. Finds from four settlements demonstrate that these pendants were not intended purely for funerary use. At Marki Alonia eight spurred annular pendants (four of picrolite, two of shell, and two of bone) were found within the settlement (fig. 4) (Frankel and Webb 1999: 105, figs. 10, 13.5; 2000: 87, 92, figs. 12, 16.5; 2001: 35). Three were recovered from Philia levels and two from construction fills of the suc- ceeding Early Cypriot I period. The remaining three, two of which were broken, were present as resi- duals in later deposits. One fragmentary picrolite example, broken through the suspension hole, was recovered with other material on the "bedrock habi- tation surface" in Unit 16 at Sotira Kaminoudhia (Swiny 2003b: 27, fig. 2.8; 2003a: 236, 276, S465, fig. 6.16). Its position between two other picrolite beads/ornaments may indicate that they were strung together. It is possible that they were associated with a burial represented by three long bones found in</page><page sequence="4">4 FRANKEL AND WEBB BASOR 336 losN Philia* Deneia ANicosia Marki otira 0 50 km Fig. 3.

Alterna- tively, its broken state may indicate an older, resid- ual item, unrelated to the use and abandonment of this EC II-III building. Eight examples (six of shell and two of bone) were found in occupation depos- its at Kissonerga Mosphilia (Period 4a) (Peltenburg 1998a: 189, figs. 97.29, 98.1, pl. 36.9; 1998: 234, Type 2.12, table 20.2; Croft 1998: 246). Two of these are manufacturing discards from the Pithos House (B3) and an overlying building (B706), leaving little doubt that pendants of this type were man- ufactured in shell at Late Chalcolithic Kissonerga (Peltenburg 1998a: 190, table 14.7, pl. 36.9, K653, K747). Until clarified by further excavations, the con- text of a small shell pendant and fragments of what might be manufacturing discard at Pyrgos Mavro- rakia remains uncertain (Maria-Rosario Belgiorno, pers. comm.). Eight similar bone pendants, ranging in length from 20 to 50 mm and bearing inscriptions in Phoe- nician and the Cypriot Syllabary, are said to have been found in a tomb near Famagusta (di Cesnola 1882: 81-82, fig. 77; Masson 1961: 315 n. 3, pl. 72.4; Masson and Sznycer 1972: 125-27, fig. 6; Mer- rillees 1993: 12). It is possible that these were origi- nally Philia pendants, recovered and reused during the Iron Age. At 45 mm in total length, the Mylos pendant is larger than almost all other extant examples. It is noticeably curved, as are the shell pendants from Kissonerga, Philia, and Sotira, which are all slightly concave in long section or sharply angled above and below the ring. The Marki shell pendants are similar in shape to Stewart's Type NId1 in picrolite, but dif- fer from most other shell examples in having a flat longitudinal profile. Both their flat profile and rela- tively small size result from the use of a different shell species as raw material. An analysis of the relative size of pendants from different sites is of particular interest (figs. 5, 6). The picrolite pendants from Philia are significantly larger than those from Nicosia, which are in turn larger</page><page sequence="6">6 FRANKEL AND WEBB BASOR 336 60- 50- 40- E E c 30- 20- 10 Philia Nicosia Marki Fig. 6. Box-and-whisker plot of lengths of picrolite pen- dants from three central Cypriot sites. than the examples from Marki. Picrolite comes from sources in the Kouris and Karyotis River valleys, which run south and north from the Troodos Moun- tains, respectively (Xenophontos 1991). Philia is much closer to the Karyotis Valley than the other sites in the central plain. There may therefore be a simple correlation of artifact size and distance from the source (i.e., availability of raw material), sug- gesting a mechanism for transferring raw material from one settlement to the next (fig. 7). While the general homogeneity of Philia material culture sug- gests a close integration of communities within this cultural system (Webb and Frankel 1999), the more specific patterns of interaction may be of closer associations with nearer neighbors, rather than of longer-distance or direct links between more distant locations. This distribution system is similar to that suggested for earlier picrolite transport from Kouris River sources, south of Troodos, where Peltenburg (1991: 117) has shown decreasing quantities of raw material with distance from the source. The size of shell pendants also varies widely (fig. 5). The example from Mylos is among the largest, while those from Marki are similar in size to the rela- tively small picrolite examples. It is possible that this is related to distance from sources of shell on the coast, but it may also show a relationship between items of similar form but different materials in each locality. Most spurred annular pendants come from secure Philia contexts and can be seen as one of the hall- marks of this system. Those associated with later material may have been residual items, heirlooms, or otherwise recycled, showing some continuity of use into later Bronze Age periods. Those at Chalco- lithic Kissonerga Period 4, however, raise important issues of the relationship between the two cultural systems of the mid-third millennium. As noted above, debate over the origins of the Bronze Age in Cyprus encompasses widely divergent opinions, ranging from a specific migration from Anatolia to a purely indigenous development with minimal exter- nal influence and no population movement. Which- ever model is preferred, it is clear that there was considerable chronological overlap, with character- istic Chalcolithic material culture continuing in use simultaneously with the newly introduced technolo- gies that characterize the Bronze Age. The nature of relationships between communities operating under different socioeconomic regimes and associated life- ways is of particular interest (Frankel 2005). From about 2400 B.C.E., Chalcolithic communities began to be affected by the intrusion of Bronze Age inno- vations, including new ways of decorating pottery and the occasional use of items such as clay spindle whorls. In addition, a few trinkets or small tools of copper, as well as symbolic items such as spurred annular pendants, appear to have crossed the perme- able boundary between the two groups. Chalcolithic people took longer to modify other aspects of their basic habitus to accommodate attitudes and technol- ogies introduced by their Philia Bronze Age neigh- bors. Most notably, they retained their traditional architectural system, based on circular structures, with all that this implies in terms of the ordering of space and social interaction. Peltenburg (1991: 118) has argued for a break- down in the infrastructure of picrolite production and exchange in the southwest of the island at the end of the Chalcolithic. It is possible to see, how- ever, in the center of the island at least, similar pat- terns of picrolite distribution during the Philia phase, although these appear to have been part of a new configuration of social relationships. The recovery of picrolite pendants and other items at Philia, Nicosia, Sotira, and Marki show that this material was valued during the Philia period (cf. Stewart 1962: 296). Else- where we have suggested that this movement of picro- lite to the Philia core area may reflect an overlap in the exchange networks of incoming and indigenous communities, coincident with Period 4 at Kissonerga (Webb and Frankel 1999: 41). This suggests that</page><page sequence="7">2004 AN EARLY BRONZE AGE SHELL PENDANT 7 Nicosia Marki . picrolite carriers . suggested distribution route for picrolite 0 50 km Fig. 7. A schematic indication of relative sizes of picrolite pendants and distribution routes of picrolite from the northern source area in the Karyotis River valley. migrant groups appropriated the indigenous use of picrolite as a prestige good at the same time that individual artifacts, modes of behavior, and tech- nologies were moving from migrant to indigenous communities. The subsequent loss of picrolite as a significant exchange item by Early Cypriot I-II may, in turn, be linked with the final demise of the tradi- tional (Chalcolithic) production systems during the Philia facies. Elsewhere we have argued for a largely unin- terrupted development and expansion of individual communities from the Philia facies through the sec- ond half of the third millehnium B.C.E. (Webb and Frankel 2004). The initial phase appears to have been characterized by numerous small, widely scat- tered settlements probably linked to larger regional centers. These dispersed villages were established in previously uninhabited and marginal areas and along- side indigenous Chalcolithic communities. Few are likely to have been internally viable as biological populations or large enough to ensure the vertical transmission of craft skills and more specialized tech- nologies (Shennan 2000). These incursive communi- ties must have been dependent on intersite exchanges of people and goods and the maintenance of hierar- chical relations with larger Philia centers. This appears to have led to a marked homogeneity in material culture across widely dispersed sites and an emphasis on overt signals of identity and alliance. As already noted, Philia sites across the island exhibit a distinc- tive range of artifacts which relate, variously, to sub- sistence, metallurgical and domestic technologies, personal ornament, dress, and food preparation and consumption. The spurred annular pendants, in par- ticular, appear to have played a significant role in proclaiming and perhaps maintaining Philia identity. The manufacture of shell examples in Late Chalcoli- thic Period 4 at Kissonerga suggests some appropria- tion of personal Philia identity markers by indigenous communities at the same time that Philia commu- nities were encroaching upon indigenous picrolite networks. This implies considerable bidirectional interaction and offers an important insight into lo- calized processes of acculturation. Such processes are likely to have led to a rapid "flattening" of asym- metrical relations between the two groups and the de- velopment of significant structural similarities over time.</page><page sequence="8">8 FRANKEL AND WEBB BASOR 336 REFERENCES Catling, H.
