<plain_text><page sequence="1">Heroic Function and Interpretation of Narrative Didier Coste "'It must be very interesting to listen to you, Mr. Nebo,' the Duchess said, amazed at his superior mind" (Curieuse!, p. 8).1 True, some readers (though there were not many) and some critics for sure (though there were not many more) would not join the Duchess of Riazan to compliment the artistic moulder or hardener of souls who had just revealed to her the very key of the "Kelto-pelasgic enigma," that is the superiority of the An- drogynes, heirs to the primitive Elohim. PMadan may not have any grounds to flatter himself using the voice of the character-in-charge, but this wishful thinking is all the more remarkable and significant of the sophisticated and difficult position of the hero in modern literature, that is in literature in general, for all literature is, by definition, modern. Rather than being strong, true, handsome, rich, or touching, the hero must first of all talk; he may do so in company of aristocratic exiles, in the park of a Tuscan castle, under the colonnade of a Greek villa, as well as in an ill- famed tavern or even caught in the solitude of his public confession, his interior monologue, his alcoholic delirium or his dreams. Under any cir- cumstances, he must produce text like a serial writer must produce copy. D'Annunzio has Claudio's favorite daimon2 saying to those who hold the future in their hands: "Voi possedete la suprema scienza e la suprema forza del mondo: il Verbo. Un ordine di parole pu6 vincere d'efficacia micidiale una formula chimica." ("Ye possess the supreme knowledge and the supreme power of the world-the Word. Words may have more mur- derous power than a chemical formula.") Let us not blame our writer's well known verbalism; however great the distrust of words which is supposed to reign in other works, the same conclusion is reached by Cervantes or Beckett: until the book is closed and even afterwards sometimes, words have the last word. This may be a truism, but in a fiction which contains a hero, a principal character, it means that this character can be defined independently of transformations explored by narrative grammar and al- most arithmetically as the anthropomorphic bearer of the largest number MLN Vol. 94 Pp. 1 176-1188 0026-7910/79/0945-1176 $01.00 ? 1979 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">M L N 1177 of words in the text. Of course we shall have to clarify what is meant by bearer but presently we are not trying to offer a philosophical or exclusive definition but a provisional supposition which should allow us to demar- cate efficiently the boundaries of our study. Consequently, we deny the name of hero to non-anthropomorphized 'actants' because they cannot act as bearers of speech, and also to implicit and unnamed actants read into the text by the receiver in order to complete the text and give it meaning; Destiny, which G. Compfre3 calls the Sublime Character in the early plays of Maeterlinck, or the "husband" in La jalousie belong to these categories. Secondly, the study of the function of the hero with which we are concerned here, is largely independent of the two ques- tions which have seemingly been the most popular among theoreticians and analysts of fiction for the greater part of the century, namely the questions of the point of view and the narrative person. Reading an article like "Point of View in Fiction" by Norman Friedman,4 I cannot help feeling that it still abides by the most traditional psychologism in the guise of spatial metaphors. Studies of the pronominal persons seem to result in the same confusion. Jean Rousseto fortunately does not show this weakness, but his title Narcisse romancier displays the trap which has gladly closed upon many studies of 'The Novels of the Self.' Moreover Rousset himself rightly quotes this sentence of Rousseau: "Nul ne peut 6crire la vie d'un homme que lui-meme" ("the life of a man can only be written by himself"). We would like to take this sentence not in the normative sense that was probably intended by Rousseau, but in the tautological sense that it con- ceals, not less provocatively: that the story of someone's life is always told by itself. Then, when Oscar Wilde said to Gide, "In art, you see, there is no such thing as the first person," he was right in the grammatical sense: the hero as the first person can refer to himself as Caesar, but it matters only in so far as the dynamics and the dialectics, the successive movements of the narrative are concerned, not the synchronic status of the hero. The hero could now be redefined, but still provisionally, as the real subject of the largest number of verbs in the narrative. We will differentiate three main functions of the hero as a bearer of text, but the word 'function' is not taken here in the narrow sense of minimal element or atom of signification that narratologists, following Propp's tradition, generally give it-"the action of a character defined from the viewpoint of its significance in the development of the plot." We callfunc- tions the various ways in which the character can be associated with the production of a meaningful text (meaningful, that is read). The first function remains the "action of a character" just mentioned, but broadened in two directions. Firstly, it will cover the structured totality of all the r6les of agent or patient successively played by the character, and secondly it will be considered in its relation with the whole set of actions in the plot and the whole of the narrative discourse, the collection of roles</page><page sequence="3">1178 DIDIER COSTE and the collection of discourses making up the narrative system. We will call this first function of a character, the hero in our context, his dynamic function. The hero changes situations in his role of agent or offers oppor- tunities for situations to be changed in his role of patient: he gets married, he has children, then he loses his wife and children in a car accident; in both cases, he is made responsible by the logic of the narrative for textual events which are, so to speak, called after him. But the positive hero who conquers a kingdom or his own authenticity in an era of chaos and degra- dation, the one who, in the words of Sartre or Maurice Conchis, could never be freer than under German occupation, is very likely to show a dynamic function which will act as an exact counterpoint to that of the represented world and most other characters. On the other hand, a dif- ferent hero, like the captain of an army whose deeds are recounted by the narrative, will be able to sum up in himself and embody without distortion the dynamics of the text as a whole; it is the case of the eponymous and sometimes redundant hero of so many Carolingian or Napoleonic epics. Finally, there is the case, though much less frequent, of a character, a madman for example, who develops his own private plot in the narrative and whose relation to the action or the narrative discourse as a whole is neither positive nor negative but just absent, a missing link-whether such a character could still be called a hero is another question, too complex to be dealt with in this very brief introduction. The second function, which we shall call panoramic function, consists in offering objects of contemplation (donner a voir). Whether he travels or not, the hero always makes us travel. By means of representations that are supposed to occur in his mind or through his mere presence in some place he justifies and provides with a common 'locus,' the non-narrative or less narrative (e.g. descriptive) elements in the narrative discourse. How many heroes have thus climbed up the Capitol, the Palatine, the Parthenon or the Eiffel Tower just for the sake of presenting us with one more vision of Rome, Athens or Paris? How many more have closed their eyes to examine their past and 'rediscover' the house, the village, the society of their child- hood. Geography or history in novelistic form produce heroes just as cer- tainly as real life heroes cause the erection of war memorials, but the panoramic function is not only the feature of one particular genre of narrative: like the dynamic function, it must be fulfilled by every hero and the degree of fulfilment may vary. The third function, which we shall callfocalfunction, belongs to the hero as a leitmotiv-object in the narrative. The hero then is not considered as an agent or a patient of events in the plot, or as the giver of 'pictures' included in the narrative, he is the centre of attention. The hero is himself a more or less permanent show, visual, aural, or even tactile. He requires an audience that makes him so, that puts him in perspective; the audience is composed of his admirers, his detractors, people ostentatiously indifferent to him, embodiments of his conscience, his subordinates, his superiors, his equals, his doubles, his narrator or narrators. Through all the things these other</page><page sequence="4">M L N 1179 characters say or through their emotional reactions, we learn to know the hero, and his interpreters in the narrative thus contribute more or less extensively to give him status or meaning. The hero is for them a text, facing which they behave as decipherers, translators, copyists, critics and co-producers, in short, as readers. They are readers 'incarnate' or in- scribed in the text of the narrative, who can anticipate positively or nega- tively the behaviour and reactions of their own readers, induce the iden- tification of 'real-life' readers with them or prevent it in order to induce an identification with the hero, to make the real-life reader their object pre- cisely when he considers himself in control of them. This third function, like the other two, is of course always present. As a result of the combina- tion of the three, the hero-subject, catalyst and object-is a complete entity by himself in the mechanism of the text, a solid bearer of text. Now, the stress can be put by the text itself or its interpreters on any of the three functions in a variable hierarchy, which can change in the course of one text or according to the narrative genre, the period and the type of hero considered. The dynamic function will be particularly linked (in fact and/or allegorically) with the production and productivity of the text, that is, with authorial delegation, illusion and communication. The panoramic function will be especially linked with the text as Dasein, as an autonomous or vicarious universe. And the focal function, as has already been said, has more to do with readers and their interpretations. We understand thus how the trilogy of heroic functions can inscribe into the text ('truly' or 'falsely') the other obsessive triangle of literarity-producer/text/reader- allowing at the same time all sorts of games and interplay, composing in the process an infinite number of figures. Well, the number of figures is perhaps infinite-like those of the ballet-but only in variations of detail. The incipient theory just outlined would not have any rationale if it was content with explaining the founda- tions of such diversity and did not try to put some order into it, to develop some sort of rational classification which could, by the act of comparison, render the nature of all and every fiction more intelligible. Some of our a priori have to be tested through experiments and analysis. We shall then use the tool just devised of the threefold heroic function on three novels which seem superficially-stylistically-very different, but whose heroes belong to only two very traditional types: the conqueror and the magus. We shall try (a) to enrich the meaning for us of the three novels (b) to measure the validity of traditional types of heroes and (c) to identify their components and their possible position in a narratological, not mytholog- ical, typology of heroes. * * * Nebo, the hero of Curieuse!, is still young and handsome in a weary and austere fashion. He is sufficiently well-off to afford solitude as well as to play a role of socialite; a painter, he has no known family, no love affair</page><page sequence="5">1180 DIDIER COSTE or paintings. While he does the portrait of the ravishing and unruly young Russian princess Paule de Riazan, he proposes to her or rather imposes on her a pact: "I shall be the great doctor who will abort all your evil lusts, who will make passion unpoetic to your eyes and will save you from being spoilt by instinct. Then, once you are dead to banal passions as I am dead to them, we shall march hand in hand towards the absolute!" Nebo is or seems to be dead to wordly temptations: he "keeps the attitude of a diamond on which nothing has a grip," he is endowed with calm and cool strength, knowledgeable and mysterious, which means that he has about everything to be a hit with novelistic women of the time (1886). Paule is the ideal symbolic Beauty and nevertheless an attractive and daring belle; she still shares in social prejudice typical of her caste but without knowing anything either about Reality or the Ideal embodied in her flesh; she is naive and readily available to be exposed to the hard realities of life. For Nebo, her curiosity makes of her an empty container that he must fill up with knowledge and ideas to obtain something perfect, a female (or more female) kind of replica of himself. Nebo's endeavour, with Paule as its medium, is characterized by its double difference from conquest on the one hand and artistic production on the other: "The hero is not always an Achilles, the genius not always a Dante." Nebo's dynamic function is fulfilled in the most uninteresting fashion, by organizing Paule's outings with him and protecting her, by interpreting for her the scenes that she attends under his guidance, and making her enact a r6le superficially similar to Mademoiselle de Maupin but always defined against Maupin: no real participation in adventures, no sexual involve- ment. Nebo presents Paule with all forms of perturbation and contamina- tion by desire but forbids the access to satisfaction; at a later stage he makes her want him as a fatherly figure, the seat of prohibitions, as the analyst, object of transference, keeper of the prohibition and initiator of the de- transference. Nebo, for sure, is resourceful: hypnosis, suggestion and chemicals, poisons in particular, are all used by him in the grand manner, reminiscent of fantastic tales and science-fiction: "I borrow from science the means of my safety . . . The 20th Century hero will extract from his pocket, according to his needs, fire, asphyxiation or explosion ... Science is a screen hiding the Supernatural, so it surely owes us the small compen- sation of playing semi-gods by means of neutral forces." A good anticipa- tion of James Bond; but much more noteworthy is the fact that all the deeds and feats of Nebo tend to change into shows offered not only to Paule but to the whole town: "A bang could suddenly be heard in the night, followed by another almost immediately; then clouds of smoke bil- lowed over Vincennes and flames were rising in the sky: the famous brothel at No. 27 was on fire." The extraordinary hyperdevelopment of the panoramic function of our hero is thus made even more obvious. He is a demonstrator of worlds, the exponent of the drama of life and the adver- tiser of truth: "Nebo, ironically, gave three knocks on the wood of the bed," "Nebo, instead of answering, lit up the magnesium coil." Nebo</page><page sequence="6">M L N 1181 plunges us with Paule in all the downtown perversities of Paris and displays treasures of stupidity, frivolity, vanity, vice, crime, venality, wasted wealth and stupefying poverty concealed by the capital as if they were his personal property. Always in front of Paule, to edify and initiate her, he interferes just enough with these external situations to help them develop as speedily as possible into what is supposed to be their natural outcome. Magic ap- pears to be completely powerless to remedy the Evil which haunts the world. The good at which it aims-and this is magic's only success-is limited to the evocation of what actually is, to a process of consciousness- raising to which those belonging to the dark side are not in the least responsive. When Nebo's hand projects on the wall the summary of his philosophy, by means of a "fluidic ray of light," nobody takes it seriously. His last speech is suddenly interrupted by a row of dots and never re- sumed, the reason being that citizen Pd1adan is sent to a dungeon for evading the draft the year before. Just like the text of the narrative breaks down, to return us to squalid Reality, "unable to complete the unfinished sentence," Paule will never know what lies at the bottom of it all. She will wait unendingly, short of reaching the Supernaturalness proposed by Nebo, just visible at her horizon. The panoranicfunction could not give the fiction but an ironical ending, and the sudden substitution of Pd1adan for Nebo, of the actual reader for Paule the reader-incarnate, causes thefocal function eventually to take over: a direct 'reading' of P6ladan is offered instead of reading a world which Nebo was previously only operating, not creating for us. * * * The hero of The Virgins of the Rocks, Claudio, is also facing a decadent and devious world in which a coarse and corrupt populace holds power, but, unlike Nebo, he is an aristocrat by birth as well as by his intelligence; he aspires to wield actual power and builds up his strength to give to him- self or his descendants the means of regaining it. He is then at least poten- tial conqueror, who invokes the great line of his ancestors, gallant captains second to none. Three sisters, Violante, Maximilla and Anatolia, are wait- ing for him, saddened by their declining fortune, their overgrown park and their fading race. One of them can offer perfection in her grace, beauty and sensuality; the other, perfection in her devotion, admiration and submission; and the third, perfection in her strength, courage and serenity. They wait all three, he imagines, for the Spouse, and their ques- tion is which one will he choose. It is only natural that in such circumstances our hero regrets that he has to make a choice; he would like to marry all three virgins, as he considers himself able to invent for each of them the life, happiness and death appropriate to their individual qualities. Social prohibition preventing Claudio from taking the three sisters determines the possibility conditions of the novel; if this obstacle was solved by some sort of miracle, the story could be easily disposed of in a few more pages with a funny happy end-</page><page sequence="7">1182 DIDIER COSTE ing: they lived happily ever after and begot many, many, many children. If, on the other hand, the hero submitted to the rule and made a choice ratified by his victim, he would cease to be a condottiere in accepting limited power and gratification with which any bourgeois at the head of a spe- cialized enterprise would content himself. The dynamic function of Claudio thus manifests itself essentially, by an apparent paradox, in a dilatory manner; his r6le in the course of the story consists of making the three sisters fall in love with him, so that they can start actualizing the possibilities they contain, rehearsing the characters they would be if pos- sessed, and at the same time, it consists of delaying as much as possible any proposal that would force him to commit himself. If he is to be the generator and bearer of text, the condottiere is bound to be deprived of possession but to discover and glorify constantly the object of his quest. Were the condottiere to fulfil his destiny it would entail the end of his panoramic function, since there are only icons of what is not possessed; nothing else can be displayed, as it is so clearly shown in the book by the tale of Panthea and Umbelino. It is the story of the incestuous love of a brother for his sister: Umbelino draws a neat line between Panthea's soul and her body; so as not to soil the former he decides to kill the latter in order to "reduce Panthea's baneful beauty to an empty shape and insensi- tive remains"; he wants that "the precious soul be able to take her innocent flight towards heaven, leaving between his arms only the covetted flesh." To do so, he bends Panthea towards her own image in the fountain, drowning her, and everybody knows that, against his expectations, it is the soul, the invisible, the elusive that he is left with, terminating the story. In these circumstances, thefocalfunction of the hero is strangely restricted by the reification of the objects of the hero's desire. Except in the final scene with Anatolia at the top of the Corace, when the virgin refuses Claudio's hand, the only time when the three sisters are allowed to speak at length is that part of the prologue when the hero listens to their voices in himself, when they are deprived of the distance needed for them to look at him. Thefocalfunction, as well as the other two, is much more equally shared between the hero and the sisters than between Nebo and Paule. It may be partly to compensate for this loss of status, that a phantasmal character, the favourite daimon of Claudio, is introduced: Alessandro Volturara can con- template the heir of his lineage and talk to him without extraditing him, so to speak, from his inner self into a universe that can only be a spectacle for him or, at the most, his potential possession, but where he cannot live. Could it be a failure of the novel in the first person? Not so: it is another matter altogether, as we shall see in The Magus, by John Fowles." * * * The Magus is a highly complex and a very long novel. Any attempt to sum it up would be disastrous, and any effort to open several of its doors with one key has little chance to succeed. Bearing this in mind we will</page><page sequence="8">M L N 1183 nevertheless use the same tool to try and make some sense of it. As op- posed to the two other novels, The Magus does not immediately yield one single hero, even after an extensive analysis. It is obvious in this case that the first-person narrator cannot be trusted to be the only hero without further examination. In fact if we look at the text a bit more closely, we can make out a whole series of transformations of the pronominal pairs pre- vailing in the narrative (excluding dialogues). In the first part where Nicholas Urfe is constantly in the foreground, we have a combination of 'I'-&gt;'me' ("I was born in 1927," "I grew the habit of . . .," "I considered myself as . . .," etc.), 'I'--'them' and a few 'they'-&gt;'me.' The meeting with Conchis completely upsets the balance; the new characteristic pair is now 'He'- &gt;'me,' hardly counterbalanced by some 'I'-&gt;'him'; then, as the masque develops at an all-embracing scale, we find more 'They'--'me' than 'I'-&gt;'them'; finally, in the third part, we notice a restoration of the initial pair 'I'-&gt;'me,' but underlaid and mediated by a proliferation of all the other pairs. The last chapter opens with these words: "The smallest hope, a bare continuing to exist, is enough for the anti-hero's future." The great find of Fowles is to confront anti-hero and hero, that is, two heroes marked with opposite signs, but each defined in relation to the other, so as to escape the pure boredom of Meursault &amp; Co. and to put to work again the old pair of the good and the bad without supporting it with extra-textual or, at least, extra-literary values. The result is that when we want to analyse in detail the functions of the magus-hero Conchis, we stumble at each step over their paradigmatic relation with the functions of the counter-hero, Nicholas. The dynamic function of Conchis is characterized by an almost exclusive preponderence of r6les of agent over r6les of patient, or to be more pre- cise, we could say that the r6les of agent are manifested by him in an autono- mous fashion, whilst the r6les of patient are attributed to him by Nicholas ("I had a feeling that he wanted . . . " "he looked cross . . . ," etc.) but this is not reciprocal. Conchis always appears as a voluntary agent endowed with initiative, and Nicholas as an involuntary agent. For seventy-seven chap- ters, Nicholas works as an involuntary narrator, as a witness; everything happens as if he had no notion of the absolute power he holds as narrator, over Conchis, having laid down Conchis' unpredictibility as the funda- mental law of his behaviour. But at the start of the seventy-eighth and final chapter, he at last uses this power which had always remained hidden from us, so much does the necessity of any hero's speech impose itself upon us with an uncritical self-evidence. He withdraws Conchis from circulation whereas we are sure of Urfe's survival, even to the date of his narrative: "So, ten more days. But what happened in the following years is silence, is another mystery." He thus announces to us that the bases of the status of the Magus, custodian and diffuser of knowledge, do not belong to him as an attribute but rest upon his spectators, his disciples, his memorialists, his victims; they are delegated. The magus exists only by proxy, he is finally effaced behind the images and events he evokes; like the magician in the</page><page sequence="9">1184 DIDIER COSTE Illusion Comique, he exists only as a purely hypothetical reserve of un- known, of unexplored or implicit territory behind the revealed, the dis- covered and the explicit, as source and as the more and more distant prime mover; Socrates is the adopted son of Plato just as God is the adopted son of man; playing God's game, the godgame, the magus only proves himself through the improbable whose name he is. Then we understand more clearly how his existence is dependent on the hypertrophy of the panoramic function, on the proliferation of phenomena behind which he takes refuge as behind a mask. He is for us what must be, because a mask must by definition cover up something, but it only needs a formula of magical denial to dissipate this underpart, this reverse side, the content of this present absence: "But the maze has no centre." With this reservation: that he who states that the web is without a spider and the mask without a face implies that he has become himself the bearer of appearances, the spider, the face, the magus. Thus we understand at the same time why and how the focal function, while necessarily being developed at one stage or an- other, is deviated or deferred in the stories of magi. The incarnated read- ers in such stories do not read their own reflection in a character who would refer to their production. They read about a world which never ceases to play the same trick on them, of producing guarantees of objectiv- ity, of presenting itself as out of r6le, as 'life' or 'reality'; and they continue indefinitely to ask it for proofs that it is 'life.' * * * In outlining a very brief comparison of the three novels studied, it is time at last to ask ourselves on the one hand what possible rules of the game they can offer our reading, since we hold with Hans Robert Jauss,7 Wolfgang Iser,8 Mircea Marghescou9 and others that a literary text is un- thinkable as such outside of our present interpretation, and, on the other hand, if the functional elements of the hero that we have here held up for consideration allow us to envisage a new classification of narratives that would be of importance precisely concerning this interpretation. None of the three novels studied purely adopts a mode of immediate presentation; all three contain numerous reflective statements, evoke the status of the work of art and discuss it within the framework of a morality. Thus Curieuse! itself contains a theory of the production of the Beautiful: "At last I find you," exclaims Nebo, "I converse with you and immediately fecundated, I give birth to the best sketch in my life and my heart's dream" (p. 15), but as a purely didactic novel, Curieuse! could not reflect too much on the nature of the fable without putting its effectiveness in jeopardy, whereas in The Magus all effectiveness is at the second remote, based upon a very elaborate series of disappointments in the reader's expectation, an expectation different from the simple fictional interest and contained in the identification of possible codes by the reader. Curieuse! announces a single code to which it remains faithful throughout, and the fictional</page><page sequence="10">M L N 1185 interest in it results from the danger of modification inherent in the in- explicable Platonism, regrettable for the concupiscent reader, of the rela- tions between Nebo and Paule, and secondarily from the diverse dangers (physical, social and moral) that they run in the course of their nocturnal escapades. On the contrary, The Magus announces an initial code, that of the psycho-sociological confession, merely in order to denounce it very rapidly as a trap and to declare or give the semblance of declaring inac- ceptable the meanings derived from the corresponding decoding, which explains the words: "This was the first event" (p. 63), at the start of the second part. Certain codes, too crude, such as spiritism, are rejected from the outset to help reassuring our rationalism, and the other sub-genres, like the war novel, the philosophical novel, the psychoanalytical novel, etc., follow one another in such a way that the supposedly deep involvement of the characters in them produces a suspense at the second remote, a sus- pense about the process of our reading rather than about its object. In order to maintain a minimum of consistency, there is also one code, that of the love-story, which is active in almost all the text and never completely contradicted, or rather the denial inflicted to it by the false happy ending of Lily's romance with Nicholas, will be denied in turn. The Virgins of the Rocks is halfway between the two other novels in respect of this complexity. A balance is kept between a more limited number of discourses-the lyrical, the epic and the esthete-of which the three Vir- gins are straightforward allegories. From the viewpoint of temporal dimension, the three novels are ba- sically linear, events being mostly recounted in the order which is supposed to be their chronological order in the represented world. As it can be expected, exceptions to this rule are fewest in Curieuse!, while the largest number can be found in The Magus, and The Virgins of the Rocks offers just enough prospective and retrospective leaps to contain the non-narrative, particularly the rhetorical elements, in the sequential system of the novel, without making the whole thing too intolerably monotonous. We can see that a number of angles of approach and criteria of evaluation would tend either to put all three novels in the same bag or to dissociate Curieuse! from The Magus in the group. But there are other no less important formal characteristics which place Curieuse! close to The Magus and dissociate both from The Virgins. Although the basic code which allows us to give sense to the various episodes is very changing in The Magus and very uniform in Curieuse!, it nevertheless remains true that there is in both cases a succession of episodes lacking a causal link between them; we are always obliged, like Paule, to ask the same question: "Where are we going to-night?" to wait for the 'to-be-continued' sequence of Conchis' fanciful autobiography and to spare his life like Sheherazade's until he has filled an arbitrarily calculated but sufficiently long lapse of our time. This technique of presentation of the world, "miroir promen6 le long du chemin" ("random reflections in the mirror"), places us in an attitude of collectors: "You would have me</page><page sequence="11">1186 DIDIER COSTE believe that one can exhaust the resources of Paris in eleven nights, when my imagination has been ambulating there for years without getting tired of it!" exclaims Paule, indignant, and Nicholas says, disappointed: "I didn't expect the curtain quite so soon." We enter a realm where we are enslaved by, dependent on the sheer need of quantity and not only quality of anec- dotes. Even in Curieuse! there are changes of sub-genres which affect not only superficial thematics but the r6les played by characters and con- sequently, our identification with them and the structure of the plot as we perceive it; Paule will never be quite her same old self again in our eyes once she has killed a man. We could say that these changes occur because the power wielded by the dominant character has the particularity of being identifiable with a knowledge whose requirements are in the nature of things, always immense but pre-existent. The character of the magus has for his role to signify that, whatever happens, it is always justified in ad- vance because there is a container for all principles of development: the reader and the dominated character are not only subordinates, they are always late. Their typical question ("What's going on?") can be opposed to the question asked in novels of desire ("What's going to happen to me") and to the one asked in novels of reminiscence or of the quest of origins, concerned with the past. The dominant character does not share the same tense as the dominated character. This gap is obviously what makes magus stories 'open' works, indeterminate enough to preserve a permanent interest other than archeological. Apart from the historical critique of a certain existentialist rubbish, I think that, in The Magus, obsessively recur- rent statements about the nature of reality must be understood in this way. In the few examples that follow, it is sometimes Nicholas who is comment- ing on his adventures and sometimes Conchis who is speaking. p. 45: [about the "Circe-like quality of Greece"]: "already [Alison] seemed far away, not in distance, not in time, but in some dimension for which there is no name. Reality, perhaps." p. 102: [Conchis:] "I have lived a great deal in other centuries." [Nicholas:] "In literature." [Conchis:] "In reality." p. 134: [Conchis:] "You notice reality is not necessary. Even the oc- topus prefers the ideal." p. 225: "Reality kept rushing through; and yet I could not get out to fully exist in it." p. 287: "That great passive monster, reality, was no longer dead, easy to handle." p. 596: "Since [Alison] was cast as Reality, she had come in her own," etc. Sufficiently determined in the cultural framework of their gnoseology, magus stories are also always stories of masks and palimpsests, the old meanings are crossed out but still legible and active.</page><page sequence="12">M L N 1187 The constraints which apply to stories of conquerors are much greater, as in the case of Claudio who attacks one particular problem, his problem. The magus is the hero of a form of excess whilst the conqueror is the hero of a form of need: he lacks something. Claudio says: "my soul which was already seeking to absorb all the soul enclosed within that stony cloister." There is in the condottiere an essentially passive predisposition which would make the presence of an incarnated reader superfluous at his side; he does not have eleutheria, the unlimited freedom of a Conchis, because he is the prisoner of the object he desires, the only one capable of giving him an identity. The branches of the alternative are then very simple for him: he either conquers and becomes the possessor of an object, himself reified, or a possessor of knowledge and a magus, a constructor; or he does not conquer and ceases to be a hero altogether, because he loses his dynamic function, his responsibility for the events in the plot. * * * It goes without saying that magus or condottiere are never, by definition, pure types, no more than they are the only types of heroes. Moreover it is strictly impossible, in the field of narratology, to establish a purely static or synchronic typology. Stories with a dominant character are always stories of the transformation of the status of such characters. In order to be able to give an account of this transformation we should learn to measure how the three aspects of the heroic function are weighted at any time in the make-up of the hero. We might then realize that Conchis and Nebo are affected by opposite transformations at the end of their respective novels. Nebo as he becomes P6ladan sees his focal function considerably en- hanced, because the substitution of the real-life reader for the character of Paule liberates the attention of the former to concentrate on the dominant character. On the contrary, Conchis seems to retreat into the background while Nicholas henceforth takes upon himself the role of magus, of guardian of mysteries. But, in fact, both transformations are necessary to make narration possible: Nicholas could never talk about Conchis if he had not become a magus himself-Conchis' 'successor'-before the beginning of the story-telling, just as Nebo in the third person had always understood a 'first person' able to refer to him as 'he.' What is really transformed is our naivete changed into wisdom, our ignorance converted into knowledge. A new kinship appears between magus stories and the Bildungsrornan, be- tween Conchis and the narrator of the Recherche whose even greater com- plexity is due to the fact that Marcel is split in two and one of these is his own reader incarnate. For this reason the adjective 'ironical' seems to me relatively the wrong one to apply to The Magus if we take the first part of Jauss' definition of ironical identification: "a level of aesthetic reception upon which an identification that the reader would otherwise have ex- pected is denied him...." But there are other types of heroes, like the gambler, who tend to lose more and more their dynamic function and,</page><page sequence="13">1188 DIDIER COSTE consequently, require that it be assigned by the reader to another charac- ter, God for example, or, if there is no God, demand that the reader take upon himself the function defective in the hero. The world of the text must remain 'complete' because our need for security wants the 'real world' to be so. A radical irony which deprives the hero of his first attribute can lead us to regress to the type of identification thatJauss calls "associa- tive." Luke-Rhinehart10 plays with that in his Dice Man and he writes this potential transformation into the text, which allows him in turn to draw again on the whole scale of levels of identification: when he is written into the text as participant, the reader feels that he is acted and finds himself obliged to build new foundations for his autonomy. Everything happens as if the heroic function in its three aspects was a quantitatively invariable element of the narrative, I mean, a kind of quantity of energy or a limited and pre-determined volume of resources which can only vary in its repar- tition and circulation: between the three aspects within the text, but also by shifting from the neutral ground, the no man's land of the text, to the active zones of the producer and the reader. It seems to me then that the heroic function should be studied seriously under the angles of the theory of information and textual economy as a fundamental vehicle of narrative communication, that is, one which con- veys meaning in a dialectic but incessant journey from poetics to aesthetic reception of the narrative, and from this reception to a more advanced stage of poetics.
