<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CREATION-STORY OF GENESIS I. A SUMERIAN THEOGONY AND COSMOGONY. MYTHS IN THE BIBLE?is a subject which has recently re ceived the greatest attention from Biblical scholars. Pro fessors Gunkel1 and Zimmern2 have investigated the subject in its various aspects, and Dr. Paul Carus3 has discussed it so thoroughly that hardly anything is left which has not been adverted to by them. The following investigation is based upon a direct study of the an cient Babylonian inscriptions, though the results reached by my predecessors and a thorough acquaintance with their method of in vestigation is presupposed here. For the sake of completeness, however, I may be permitted to recapitulate in a few words the chief data brought out by their investigations, confining myself here to the myth of the first chapter of Genesis. The original account of Gen. i. must have contained the so called Jahveh-Tehom myth found in other parts of the Old Testa ment. This myth represents Jahveh as fighting with a dragon, called either Rahab or Leviathan or serpent. Jahveh overcomes this dragon, divides it and forms out of the two halves "the waters that are above the firmament" and "the waters that are below the firmament." The Biblical dragon has been identified with the 1 Sch?pfung und Chaos in Urzeit und Endzeit. G?ttingen, 1895.

Further the fight of Marduk with Ti?mat was recognised as the original of the fight of Jahveh with Tehom : a fight of the light against the darkness. The darkness having been overcome by the light, the creation became possible. The following striking sim ilarities were found to exist between the Biblical and Babylonian myths1 : According to both traditions there was in the beginning noth ing but the chaos under the form of the primeval ocean?it was eternal, not having been created. This ocean, when personified was thought to be a terrible monster. The Babylonian name of that monster was Ti?mat, the Biblical Tehom or Leviathan-Rahab.2 That in Gen. i. this Tehom was considered a mythical being is still evident from the fact that the word is treated as a "proper name" ?it is simply called Tehom and not ha-Tehom. In both myths this Tehom is represented as a dragon or serpent, either with one or several heads, presumably seven as in Revelation, chapters xii. and xiii. Besides the chief monster there appear in both traditions others: its helpers. In the Babylonian creation-story there are opposed to these monsters the "great gods" among whom Marduk takes the first and foremost place. Also in the Biblical account there seem to have been, besides Jahveh, other divine beings, as is still evident from Gen. i. 26: "Let us make man." In the Babylonian account it is Marduk who takes up the fight with Ti?mat; in the Biblical account the same r?le is played by Jahveh. Both are armed with a sword. Marduk kills with his sword Ti?mat, Jahveh Rahab Leviathan-Tehom. The "helpers" of Ti?mat are treated more kindly by Marduk, precisely as is done with the helpers of Rahab by Jahveh. According to both myths the monster is divided?ac cording to the Babylonian account : into the upper waters and into the lower waters. The upper waters are kept back by a kind of 1 See Zimmern, /. c, p. 15. Gunkel, Commentary, p. 85 f. Cams, The Mo nist, April, 1901, p. 428. 2ip lxxxix. 9 ff. Y&gt; lxxiv. 13 ff. Is. li. 9 ff.

According to the Biblical account Jahveh divides the Tehom, the primeval ocean, also into two parts, by putting a firmament be tween them. Thus the Tehom came to be a heavenly and a ter restrial ocean, or as it is said in the Bible, "waters which were above the firmament" and "waters which were below the firm ament." Even the watchmen who are to guard the waters of heaven are still preserved in Job vii. 12 : "Am I a sea or sea-monster that thou settest a watch over me ? " By thus dividing the primeval ocean there is created according to both myths the visible heaven. In the Bible as well as in the Babylonian account this fight with the dragon is closely connected with the creation of the world, in such wise that the former pre cedes the latter. In both accounts we have the following sequence : Tehom?Fight?Division?Heaven ! The above is a r?sum? of what scholars have arrived at in their investigations, and I think their conclusions may be accepted as true. But, far as they have gone, they have by no means as yet exhausted the subject. There are still left certain difficulties in the Biblical as well as in the Babylonian account which are not yet satisfactorily explained. And with these unsolved problems we are concerned here. Before we consider these problems it would seem necessary to say a few words about the structure of Gen. i. The first chapter of Genesis is ascribed by all scholars to the Priestly school (commonly abbreviated P.)?and is hence late. The word DYDN (Elohim) is used throughout for "God" and the account is built up according to a certain formula. This formula runs : ' 'And Elohim said : let there be . . . and there was. . . . And Elohim saw . . . that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning the . . . day." According to this skeleton the creation of the world is described as having taken place within a space of seven days. This system of seven days is not original, it is not found in the Babylonian ac count. It was inserted by P. This follows from the fact that on</page><page sequence="4">THE CREATION-STORY OF GENESIS I. 571 the third and sixth day two tasks were done, and that on the sev enth day, which was intended to be a day of rest, Elohim had to finish the work of the sixth day: nto ItfK irD??to "jrotfn DVO DWK bri1 ?and if he finished it, he had to work on it, it was not at an end, not yet done on the sixth day ! But, as we shall shortly see, there is still another reason why the system of seven days cannot have belonged originally to the account of the creation. Furthermore, I should like to point out here the difficulty which we encounter when trying to translate the word ywn. It is used in three different senses in the first ten verses. In the ex pression, y*ixn riiO D^ttt?n nx, it is used to express our idea of "cos mos," for "heaven and earth" is simply the Hebrew term for our word "cosmos." In the expression, nrrn yixm, of v. 2, y^N stands for the chaotic mass ; it is the cosmos as it existed before the first day. And v. 10 yiN is explained by ntT, "the dry ground" ; here therefore it is the same as that which we should understand by "earth." Bearing this in mind, we ought to translate verses 1?3 as follows : "In the beginning of the Elohim's creating2 heaven and earth (i. e., the cos mos)?the chaotic mass existed,3 namely,4 as a tohu vabohu, and darkness was upon Tehom and the spirit of Elohim HBrnft upon the waters?then Elohim said : " etc. With this translation, of course, falls also the theory of a crea tio ex nihilo. Indeed, a creation out of nothing is not implied in the first chapter of Genesis. Not a single word indicates such a theory?not even the word ?for we have instead of in verses 25, 26, the verb n'TO- It was the chaotic mass coeternal with the Creator out of which everything was created, made, developed, evolutionised. After the primeval ocean has been divided into the waters above and below the firmament, the earth or dry land is made to "appear out of the waters under the firmament": HXIgJ 1 Gen. ii. 2. 2 Or, "In the beginning when Elohim was about to create." 3 nriYi = "existed," not Y^l or "became." 4Sc. at that time, i. e., "in the beginning."</page><page sequence="5">572 THE MONIST. "?tf2M ! Even the birds are developed or take their origin from out of this terrestrial ocean : -pin rrn tv: yii dtoi witi* " Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures and with birds." 1 We see then, that one thing takes its origin out of the other, one is the parent of the other ; there is, so to speak, a continual giving birth of one thing to another,?a genealogy2 Having thus cleared our way, we must now consider the differ ences between the Biblical and the Babylonian account of the crea tion,?differences that are certainly strange and marked. If it be true that Gen. i originally made use of the fight of Jahveh with Tehom, we must be able to account not only for its omission, but also for its differences from the Babylonian Marduk-Ti?mat myth. And just these differences are, for our consideration, of the highest importance ! According to the Babylonian account, the creator Marduk was himself borne by Tiarnat,?he therefore was not coeternal with Ti? mat, he was, so to speak, her child ! The Creator of Gen. i, on the other hand, exists from all eternity like Tohom herself ! The first act of the Babylonian creator is the "division of the Ti?mat," i. e., the creation of "the upper waters" and "the lower waters"! The first act of Elohim of Gen. i is the creation of the nix or light. Now, what is the significance of this *yiN in Gen. i ? It is 1 Gen. i. 20. 2The writer of Psalm civ. 24 ff. was, no doubt, later than P., since for him the eternity of Tehom-Leviathan seemed to have been impossible. Jahveh alone could be eternal,?hence Leviathan had to become a creature, for we read (R. V.): ' ' O Lord, how manifold are thy works ! In wisdom, thou hast made them all : The earth is full of thy creatures. Yonder is the sea, great and wide, Wherein are things creeping innumerable, Both small and great beasts. There go the ships, There is Leviathan, whom thou hast formed to take his pastime therein ! " The original significance of Leviathan is lost here,?he has become a mere creature of Jahveh ! Hence also the succession : creation of the earth with its creatures and the sea with its creatures, among them Leviathan !</page><page sequence="6">the creation-story of genesis i. 573 neither the sun nor the moon nor any of the stars,?for they were all created later : on the fourth day ! And yet it is said in v. 4 that Elohim by thus creating the "light" divided the "light from the darkness"; the former he called "day," the latter he called "night." Now this is in direct contradiction to v. 14 and v. 18, where we are expressly told that Elohim created the "two great luminaries," i. e., the sun and the moon, "to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness" ! According to our daily experience and observation, it is the sun which conditions "the light and the darkness" or "the day and the night." If this be true, then it follows that the statement in v. 4 about the "light" of the first day is wrong. And so it is ! We saw above that the system of seven days does not originally belong to the creation story. The writer of Gen. 1, however, in order to fabricate his nights and days or simply "days" before the sun was created, had to add some such expressions as those found in v. 4 : "to divide the light from the darkness." In doing this, he manufactured the first three days,?the days, namely, which preceded the creation of the sun on the fourth day. And because it was added, it follows that v. 4 and all of v. 5 does not belong to this account. But this con sideration does not yet explain the "light" itself, created by God on the first day. In vain have I looked in the various commentaries for an ex planation,?the explanations given, if they may be called such, do not explain ! Here again the Babylonian account helps us. Accord ing to that account Ti?mat brings forth "the great gods," among whom the god of light, Marduk, was the chief one, and this latter overcomes Ti?mat and thus creates the heavens. In Gen. 1 the monotheistic idea predominates; the conception of divinity that the writer had, did not suffer the Creater himself to be created,? hence what did the writer do ? Well, "the great gods" were elimi nated, the creator Marduk was called Elohim (or Jahveh) and was made coeternal with Ti?mat and placed with her at the beginning, ?but only the name, the nomen proprium of the creator was removed, his attribute was kept: the attribute "light" \ And it was kept because the writer needed it to make out his days ! Hence the</page><page sequence="7">574 THE MONIST. "light" of Gen. i, 4, because it is neither the sun nor the moon nor any of the stars, can be only the attribute of Marduk, as the god of light and the foremost of all gods. The "light " then, must be another, and the most important, mythological element taken from the Babylonian account by the writer of Gen. 1. Marduk, the "god of light," is the "conditio sine qua non" without which the creation would have been impossible,?the writer thought. The name Marduk had to be given up, but his attribute could be kept and was kept and made the first work of Elohim. From these considerations we get the following sequence : {a) Babylonian : Ti?mat?"the great gods," and Marduk, the god of light ?fight?division?heaven. (b) Biblical: Tehom?light?fight?division?heaven. In the Babylonian account the primeval ocean is a monster of double sex: a masculine and a feminine in one person, a kind of androgyn, for we read : "E-nu-ma e-lish la na-bu-u sha-ma-mu shap-lish ma-tum shu-ma la zak-rat aps?-ma r?sh-tu-u za-ru-shu-un mu-um-mu ti-amat mu-al-li-da-at gim-ri-shu-un m?-shu-nu ish-ti-nish i-chi-qu-u-ma." That is : ' ' When above | the heavens were not yet named Below the earth | no name as yet bore When the ocean, the primeval | their begetter Ti?mat, the deep, | the mother of them all Their waters in one | had joined together Then the great gods were created." According to this the primeval waters consisted of the aps?, the begetter, or z?r?,1 and the Ti?mat, the mother or muallidat. As a result of the "joining their waters in one," i. e., of cohabitation, the gods were created. The primeval ocean, then, was considered to be the first parent who brought forth the gods. What does the From the root 1?1T " seed " !</page><page sequence="8">THE CREATION-STORY OF GENESIS I. 575 Bible say to this? The verse which speaks about the primeval waters consists of three clauses?the first clause gives the descrip tion of the primeval waters or chaotic mass and the other two clauses stand in the so-called parallelismus membrorum. It reads (v* 2): voi inn nrrn yiNro aim *etw rfin) d^n *nrbs romfe dvtck nro That is, "the chaotic mass (or primeval waters, ocean see above !) existed as a tohu-vabohu ; it was 'a darkness' upon the Tehom as well as a 1 spirit of god' that nsmfe upon the waters " If the Hebrew Tehom is equal to the Babylonian Ti?mat, then "the waters" must be the "aps?." But if "the waters" are the "aps?," then "the spirit of God" must be it too! This follows from the parallelism. Hence "the spirit of God" of Gen. i. plays exactly the same r?le as the aps? of the Babylonians, i. e., he ncmtt the Tehom. The word nsmtt is declared by the newest com mentators to mean "to brood over"?but I do not think that that translation exhausts its full meaning ; ncmtt means and stands for the same "idea" expressed by the Greek 7rio-/ceva?civ, i. e., "to over shadow." Thus we get here a striking parallel to "the Holy Ghost overshadowing Mary." nsmtt, then, expresses the same thing as does the Babylonian "joining their waters in one."1 If this be true then even in Gen. i. we find the thought expressed that the pri meval waters or ocean are parents, who beget and would bring forth ! Thus here we have another striking similarity?notwithstand ing its great difference?between the Biblical and Babylonian ac counts of the creation ! In both accounts the primeval waters were thought to be a kind of androgyrf, male and female in one person, who thus became the first parents. The writer of Gen. i. who apparently did not believe in an an drogynous monster, retained the Ti?mat or Tehom, but substituted for the aps? "the Spirit of Elohim"2 as the life-giving power of 1 From this it also follows, of course, that the expression has nothing to do with the world-egg theory, which some scholars want to find here. 2The expression " spirit of Elohim" seems to stand in P. for the same idea as</page><page sequence="9">57? THE MONIST. everything. He wanted, it is true, to eliminate the androgynous character of the primeval ocean?the result we know. Again if the Tehom is = Ti?mat, then ?)tfn (the darkness) must be = Ti?mat too. Thus it was rightly said that the fight of Marduk with Ti?mat is nothing more or less than a fight of the light against the darkness. But we have seen above that the god Marduk was called Elo him and made coeternal with Tehom, and that simply his attribute was retained by the writer of Gen. i. in order to help him to fabri cating his days. We also have seen that the functions of the TiN are in contradiction to those of the sun, and thus must be spurious, i, e., -fia does not belong to the original account of Genesis it must be left out, if we would restore Gen. i. to its original text. Bearing this in mind the account of Genesis i. contains a well connected genealogy, which is as follows : Tohu-vabohu * waters "?Tehom " spirit of Elohim"?darkness " waters which are above the firmament " " waters which are below the firmament " "the firmament of heaven " or "heaven" "the dry ground " " the waters " I or " earth " I the two great lights, i. e., "the sun " and " grass," " herbs," " fruit- " swarms of living "the moon" and "the stars" trees," "animals," and creatures," "fowls," "beasts" "fishes" "man " I would draw the reader's attention here to the fact that "the waters above and below the firmament " are said to come from the Tehom, or the darkness,2 a peculiarity which will be explained later on. the ?Oft^f? of the Targums ! It was used in order to avoid as much as possible the "anthropomorphic idea" of God. 1 If it did it ought to be made coeternal with Jahveh-Elohim, as Marduk was. But this would again be fatal?for in that case it would not be the first act of Elo him !</page><page sequence="10">THE CREATION-STORY OF GENESIS I. 577 From the analogy above given it will be seen that "man" or the "creation of man/' if we take our stand on the account of Gen. i., cannot be referred either to one or to the other side, i. e., we do not know whether he was a descendant of the "waters above the firmament" or of "the waters below the firmament," from which latter the "earth" and its "creatures" took their origin. All we learn is this : "man was created in the image and likeness of Elo him "?a %v 8i? 8totv, which tells us that man looks exactly like Elo him.1 The Babylonian account tells us that man was made out of divine blood mixed with earth. The writer of Gen. i. with his monotheistic idea could, of course, never admit that the "blood of another god " was spilt?because there existed no other god. But he apparently accepted the idea that man was in some way or an other connected with the gods, hence he made him to be created in the image and likeness of Elohim. The account given in the second chapter of Genesis has, however, for "image and likeness " the "breathing into man's nostrils the breath of life," which was done by Jahveh. In blood there is life, and life is a breath,?was the faith of the Jahvistic writer. Accordingly he substituted for the blood of God the "breath of God," thus connecting "man" again with his creator. We have seen then that the fight of the light against the dark ness does not belong originally to the account of Gen. i. But, one may rightfully ask, if it does not, how are the apparent indications of such a fight to be found in Gen. i to be explained? To answer this question it will be necessary for us to examine the Babylonian account of the creation and see whether the original form of that account contained the fight of Marduk with Tiarnat or not. That the Babylonian creation story had its development and required time to assume the shape in which we now know it, is of course self-evident. If we are able to trace the different threads in the development of the Hebrew literature by employing critical 1Comp. here Gudea's dream where din^ir Nin-Gir-su is said "to be a man," i, e., where a god is said to look "like a man."?This, no doubt, is the older con ception : gods always look like the men to whose tribe or nation they belong. See below.</page><page sequence="11">578 THE MONIST. methods, I think we ought to be able also to trace the threads,? delicate and flimsy though they are,?which the inscriptions of early Babylonia put into our hands. In the following then I shall try to show that even the Babylonian creation story did not origi nally contain such a myth as the fight of Marduk with Ti?mat. * * We have now to crave the reader's indulgence for a rather technical discussion of a few points which at first sight may seem indifferent; but this course of procedure is indispensable for an analysis of the creation-story of Genesis. Having established the genealogical order of the Babylonian divinities, we shall be better able to understand the kinship between the Hebrew Genesis and the Sumerian cosmogony. Before entering on our investigation, it is necessary to say a few words about the meaning of NIN, EN, LUGAL, and DIN GIR. In the "trilingual list of gods," II R 59, we read in Col I, 1. 48: dinsirMUL DIN-TIR-ki I din*irNIN-DIN-TIR ki | din*irAMAR-UD The dingirAMAR-UD is Marduk. Marduk was the city-god of Baby lon. But?and this is important?he is not called in the "Sume rian " column EN but NIN. This NIN is rightly transcribed in the EME-SAL column by U, i. e., MUL or UMUN = lord. Hence NIN must mean here = b?lu or "lord." This does not prove that Marduk as the city-god of Babylon became a "feminine." He re tained his gender and remained a male deity, for in the same list, Col. II, 1. 17, we read : dingirMUL (fem.!) DIN-TIR-ki | din*irNIN-DIN-TIR-ki | iluBe-lit aluBab-ilu-ki ! NIN, then, in this connection, i. e., when used with the name of a city,1 may stand either for b?lu or b?ltu, i. e., for his lordship, forming with the name of the city a "proper name" as in din^rNin-Gir-su or standing in apposition as in K. B. Ill1, pp. 24, 46. dinsirDumu-zi-zu-ab, nin Ki nu-nir-ki !!</page><page sequence="12">THE CREATION-STORY OF GENESIS I. 579 or her lordship. In most cases we will be able to determine ex actly the gender either from the syllabaries or from the "apposi tion" that may follow such a name, as for instance, dingirNIN-EN LIL-ki is explained in the very same list by "the wife of Ninib." The din*irNIN-GIR-SU is called in the oldest Babylonian in scriptions the ur-sag or ur-sag lig-ga, "the mighty prime minister" of B?i,?hence the city-god of Gir-su must have been a male divin ity. It is indeed strange that male gods, when becoming gods of certain cities, should be called NIN ; we should expect of course for NIN either EN or LUGAL. EN?as far as I know?is never used in this connection, but only LUGAL, see, e. g., the name din*irLUGAL-ERIM-ki. The EME-SAL texts distinguish clearly between the gender by using two different signs, but not so the Sumerian of the lists or bilingual inscriptions,?and also not the old Sumerian. This latter, when intending to make the gender absolutely certain, uses for NIN the word LUGAL. LUGAL then always denotes a male, while NIN may stand either for a male or a female divinity. What may possibly be the reason for the use of this NIN? We know that in Babylonia every city had its special god. As long as the city was in possession of her patron she enjoyed inde pendence. But in case the "god left the city," or "went out of the city," i. e., when the god was carried away captive by a victori ous king, the city lost her independence. The city-god, then, was something which had to be defended and protected, which had to be fostered and cared for, but which could also be "taken," either by force, inclination, or otherwise, which could be chosen, betrayed or given away, which could be sold,?all characteristics of a woman ! Even we are in the habit of personifying our nations as feminine; note, for example: Helvetia, Bavaria, Borussia, Ger mania, Britannia, and Columbia ! From this also follows that a name like dingir Nin-Gir-su is no proper name but a surname or attribute. This is even grammatically indicated in the oldest inscription, for we find very often after the name dingir Nin-Gir-su the double postposition KA-GE. In this re</page><page sequence="13">58o THE MONIST. spect Galet A of Eannatum1 is especially interesting. Compare, e. g., such expressions as these: " Eannatum_?-sum-ma din^ir Nin-Gir-su-ka-ge, i. e., Eannatum_to whom power was given by (ge) the lord of (ka) Girsu." 2 Such surnames or attributes of gods are very common, yes, we may rightly say that all the names of the gods we know are really not proper names at all, but attributes or appellatives. To establish this, I may be allowed to cite a few more ex amples. The name dingir Innanna cannot be a proper name, for we find the double postposition after it. If it were a proper name, only one postposition would be expected. "Eannatum....mu-shag-sa-a din?irInnanna-ka-ge."3 Eannatum_dam ki-ag din*ir Innanna-ka-ge.4" Hence we cannot translate the inscription of Lugaltarsi otherwise than has been done in E. B. H. p. 1253, viz.: For the king of the lands (= B?i) and for Innanna, the mistress of the divine Innanna, etc. Among other names for "gods" which are used with a double postposition may be mentioned: dingirNin-char-sag,0 dingirDumu-zi zu-ab,6 din*ir Pa-sag,7 gal + (ga)lu + diRgir Erim,8 and even dingir En-ki,9 etc., etc. 1 See my Early Babylonian History (afterwards to be referred to as E.

In this passage it is preceded by: Eannatum _ku-li ki-ag dinsir Gal + galu-Erim,?both sentences have to be separated on account of the parallelism. If we do not, then Lugal-Erim would become the dam ki-ag of Innanna. That kings often do call themselves a 1 ' dam " or husband of a certain goddess is evident from E. B.

There are quite a good many " names of gods" composed with NIN, which can signify male gods only. In the composition of these names the NIN seems to mean as much as "possessor of" = Arabic dh?, dh?t. To this class belong, among others, the fol lowing : dingir Nin-?-gal,1 dingir Nin-dar-a lugal-en,2 dingir Nin-gish-zi-da,8 dingirNin-gir,4 Nin-dub lugal-en,5 dingir Nin-sar gir-lal dingir Nin-Gir-su.6 If in this way NIN may stand for b?lu as well as for b?ltu, we have, in order to determine the gender of the gods, whose names are compounded with NIN, to pay great attention to the titles or other attributes which may or may not follow. They will show us in most cases whether the god in question is either a male or a female. The titles or attributes stand almost always in apposition, i. e., they follow1 the name of the god. In these appositions we have to distinguish between : (1) LULAL or EN and NIN on the one hand and; (2) LUGAL and NIN on the other. With regard to (1) as well as (2) the following examples may suffice : Ur-Gur8 dedicates an inscription to dingir En-lil, lugal-kur-kur-ra lugal-a-ni, i. e., to B?i, king of the lands, his king.

Rim-Sin1 dedicates an inscription to dingir Nin-shach en gal-lal .... lugal-a-ni-ir. The "en-gal-lal" expresses that which Nin-shach is by virtue of his being a god, the lugal-a-ni-ir expresses the relation in which he stands to Rim-Sin. From these two observations we may draw the following rule : Every male god when brought into relation to men (kings, or others who dedicate) is always a LUG AL or "king," but by virtue of his being a god, he may be either a "LUGAL or king" or an "EN or lord." Every goddess, however, is by virtue of her being a goddess2 as well as when brought into relation to men always a NIN3 or "mistress." No. (i) expresses the titles of gods as gods. No. (2) expresses the relation of gods to men! If this observation be true we may lay down another rule : NIN when in apposition indicates always a female god, or goddess.4 Thus there ought to correspond, e. g., to a LUGAL-EN a NIN EN. Indeed we find this to be true ! The dingir Nin-dar-a5 is called LUGAL-EN6, while dingirNina has the apposition NIN-EN7 or NIN-EN-NA.8 We have seen above that even the name dingirEN-KI must be composed of two separate names on account of the double post position which it may suffer behind it. The dingirEN-KI is as the EN indicates a male god, hence is followed also by LUGAL9 in 11. R. 3 No. X = K. B. Ill1, p. 94, 3. For a similar case see IV. R. 35 No. 6 = K. B.

The counterpart of dingirEN-KI is dingir NIN-KI, which name is also to be found in the Earliest Babylonian Inscriptions.1 Here, then, we have another peculiarity. We do not find LU GAL-f X for the male god, as we might expect, but always EN. "EN" in such names as dingirEN-KI indicates the masculine, while "NIN" indicates the feminine gender. What maybe the reason for this peculiarity? The answer is : male or masculine gods are LUGAL = king from the standpoint of men to whom kings, of course, also belong, but EN, when compared with their equals, their wives, i. e., "the husband-god" and the "wife-god," are on the same level considered by themselves, but when brought into relation with men the "husband-god" seems to enjoy a greater pre rogative; nay, the kings considered themselves equal to a goddess, hence they sometimes called themselves the "dam" or husband of this or that goddess.2 To the same class with dingirEN-KI belong among others also dingirEN-LIL, dinghEN-ZU,3dingirEN-GUR,4 dingir EN-Ba-u,4 etc., etc. In all these names the "EN" corresponds to our "husband," or "Mr." If NIN were substituted for EN, we should have the "wife" or "Mrs."?hence the real proper name of dingirEN-KI would be dingir KI ; the EN or NIN having been put before the KI in order to distinguish the "husband" from the "wife," or the "Mr." from the "Mrs."5 In course of time these names came to be looked upon as real proper names, and only now and then does their grammatical construction betray to us the true fact, i. e., that *E. B. H. p. 81, note i. 2 See above, p. 580, 4. This fact also probably contributed somewhat to the "divine character" of the kings. 3 Se? E. B. H.

R. 58, 53a. 5 Thus it happened that in course of time the deity was differentiated, i. e., the deity was originally a self-perpetuating being, a kind of androgyn, and later on was separated or thought to exist as "husband " and " wife."

NIN -j- the real name of the god. The last point which we have to discuss is the use of the name DINGIR or "god." The oldest Babylonian inscriptions are always very careful to put the dingir-sign before the name of a god.1 The names for god Anu2 and Gu-la3 are probably the only ones which generally occur without the dingir-sign.4 The negligence in omitting the sign dingir before the names of gods begins at the time of the first dynasty of Babylon. Above we have seen that every city had its god. Not only the cities, how ever, but also the different kings and patesis (priest-kings) had their favored deities whom they termed dingir,?while the others were either LUGAL or NIN. The god of Urukagina was dingir Nin-shul lil,6 that of Eannatum,6 and Entemena :7 dingir jj)un.gur8 or aiso written dingir Dun-gur-an ;9 dingir Nin-?-gal10 is the god of Ur-Ba-u; dingirNin-gish-zi-dau that of Gudea; dingir Lugal-banda12 that of Sin-g?shid, etc., etc. If cities and kings and patesis had their special gods, it is more than probable that also the "lands" and "countries," the "families" and "tribes," in fact, every "person," had his own 1 Except when the name of a god occurs in a name of a city : e. g., EN-LIL-ki = Nippur, for din*ir EN-LIL-ki. But see E. B. H., Index, Gods. 2 In the Old Babylonian inscriptions the god Anu is mostly written AN-NA, but also AN-E (Gudea, Statue B, VIII. 45 = K. B.

The inscriptions so far accessible to scholars do not shed much light upon this question, yet there are at least one or two examples that countries had their special gods : dingir Mar-tu, "the god of the Westland," i. e., of the Ammorites.1 In the old Babylonian inscriptions, Babylonia, when spoken of in its totality, i. e., when South and North Babylonia are meant, is called: Ki-en-gi-ki-Urdu (BUR-BUR). A dingirUrdu (BUR-BUR)-zi occurs in an inscription of Ninkagina2 and in Cyl. B of Gudea.8 The ZI in the name of this god is, no doubt, the same as that in the name ding[r EN-LIL-ZI, which latter name is explained by nu-banda (?) iluB?l (EN-LIL),4 i. e., "the servant of B?i." The dingirUrdu-zi then is the "servant" of "god Urdu," and as dingirEN-LIL is the city-god of Nippur, so probably isdingirUrdu the country-god of Urdu (BUR-BUR), which latter again with "KI" or "place " sign before or after it, signifies the country " Akkad. " In like manner, we might explain Ki-en-gi as the land (KI) of EN-GI?and EN-GI being = "husband" or "Mr." GI?we should have here another god of a country, viz., that of Shumer.5 The results of our investigation so far would be as follows : NIN before or in composition with the names of cities and deified attributes may stand either for a male or female god,?the context or syllabaries or other texts must be taken in to decide the gender of each respective god. LUGAL before or in composition with the names of cities or deified attributes stands always for a male divinity. NIN in apposition or as attribute of a divinity always shows that that divinity is feminine ; if it be masculine the word LUGAL or EN is used. 1E. B. H. p. 411.

Mr. LIL, according to our rules laid down above, would have to be called dingirEN-LIL and Mrs. LIL, dingir NIN-LIL?both occur in the oldest inscriptions.1 dingirEN-LIL is called lugal-kur-kur.2 This attribute has become in course of time even a proper name, to which the sign dingir was prefixed : dingir Lugal-kur-kur.8 If EN LIL was a lugal-kur-kur, then his wife must have been a nin-kur kur ; this would follow from the analogy of the case ! So far I have not yet seen an inscription where NIN-LIL is called nin-kur-kur, but EN-LIL is called also lugal-an-ki,4 and NIN-LIL nin-an-ki.5 Not only NIN-LIL is the "mistress of heaven and earth" but also dingir Nin-char-sag.6 This latter goddess is also called am dingir ri-ne7 and am tur-tur-ne,8 while dingirEn-lil has the title: ab-ba din gir-dingir-ru-ne,9 and is the same as the dingir Lugal-dingir-e-ne.10 Am dingir-ri-ne is also the attribute of dingir Nin-tu.11 dingirSal (var.

LIL, who is expressly called the dam dingir En-lil.1 They represent NIN-LIL in her different capacities and are "deified" attributes of the wife of LIL. Such a "deification" of attributes seems to have been almost endless and began at the very earliest times of Babylonian history. Not only, however, the attributes contributed greatly to the multiplicity of a single god or goddess, but also the places where such a god or goddess might be worshipped. Thus we have a dingirInnanna-edin,2 a dingir Innanna-Erin-ki (=the goddess of Susa), and in later times the Ishtar of Arba-ilu, of Nina, and Kidmuri. There seem to have been even different EN-LILs, as is apparent from such expressions as dingirEn-lil En-lil-ki-a8 "the Nippurian Enlil or B?i" in contradistinction to another B?i. dingirBa-u, an other name4 for dingir Nin-lil, the wife of EN-LIL, is the dumu or sometimes also the dumu-sag of AN-NA, i. e., the "child" or "firstborn child" of AN-NA.6 What was the name of the father of EN-LIL? The old Baby lonian inscriptions do not give an answer to this question, but from Assyrian inscriptions we know that Bel (the Semitic Babylonian for EN-LIL) was called the m?r r?sht? sham?, i. e., "the firstborn child of heaven." The Assyrian sham? translates the Sumerian AN or AN-NA, hence it follows also EN-LIL was the firstborn of AN. This is important : dingir Ba u as well as dingir En-lil are a first born ; both are brother and sister but at the same time husband and wife ! (2) The children of EN-LIL.

In later inscriptions occurs also the writing din*ir Ba-bur. Ba-bi = geni tive, and Ba-bur = dative (sic !) is in Sumerian impossible. Ba-bur is formed in Semitic and Sumerian fashion, as the r (= ra or ru) shows. In good Sumerian the postposition "ra"is shortened to r only after i as in ni, cp : dingir-ra-ni-ir, lugal-a-ni-ir !

EN-KI is called lugal zu-ab.1 This would presuppose a title "nin zu-ab" for NIN-KI ; I have, however, not yet found this latter title for Mrs. KI. And because EN-KI is the lugal zu-ab it is probable that the dingir Dumu-zi-zu-ab,2 also shortened to dingir Dumu-zi,2 was a son of EN-KI. Of the dingir Dumu-zi the later ilu Tammuz is no doubt a.simple contraction.8 To dingir Dumu-zi was dedicated at the time of Sargon I. and later on also at the time of the fourth dy nasty of Ur,.the sixth* month, which was called "the festival of ^Dumu-zi."5 A daughter of EN-KI (hence also a brother of dingir Dumu-zi-zu-ab) was dingir Nina.6 In the old Babylonian texts she is called "a child of NUN-ki,"7 i. e., Eridu.

A second name of the husband of Nina was dingirNin-dub, "the lord of the tablet (writing)," who together with Nin-Gir-su and Nidaba appeared unto Gudea in his dream, and who presented unto Gudea the "plan of the temple E-ninnu."1 In another place2 he is called "lugal-en" and has therefore exactly the same title as dingir Nin-dar-a, and is thus identical with the latter. A third name of Nin-dar-a was dingir Lugal-Erim-ki.8 Ur-Ba-u calls himself the nitagh ki-ag, "the beloved servant" of this god.4 My reason for identifying dingir Lugal-Erim-ki with dingir Nin-dar-a = dingir Nin-dub =dingirUd-m?-Nin?-ki-shurit-ta (see below) is this : La gash or Shirpurla consisted of four suburbs, each suburb being called after the name of a god, or better, being dedicated to a god. These suburbs were : 1. Gir-su-ki, with dingir Nin-Gir-su as its god. 2. Uru-azag-ga with the wife of Nin-Gir-su: dingirBa-u as its patroness. 3. Nina-ki with dingir Nina, and 4. Erim-ki with dingir Lugal-Erim-ki. It seems probable that Nina-ki (dingir Nina) stands in the same relation to Erim-ki (dingir Lugal-Erim-ki) as does Uru-azag-ga (dingir Ba-u) to Gir-su-ki (dingir Nin-Gir-su). In this case, we would have here "two couples," each couple consisting of husband and wife. These couples are also "brothers and sisters"?for dingirNina ex pressly calls dingir Nin-Gir-su my brother.0 If this observation be true, then dingir Lugal-Erim-ki would be (1) the husband of Nina and 1 See Gudea, Cylinder A. col.

He was able to adduce seven "reasons" for his supposition. The very fact that he brought in just seven "reasons" was at once a bad omen. He introduces his seven reasons thus (p. 220): "Da Bel, wie der Eigenname 2E-KUR-dumu2-nunna (d. i., Igur SohnNunna's) beweist, als Sohn des Himmelsoceans von den Babyloniern aufgefasst wurde (vgl. auch noch Ursp., S. 37, Z. 6 v. u. Bel m?r risht? shami), so ist es nach der stereo typen Folge Anu, Bei, Ea, mehr als wahrscheinlich, dass sie auch den Ea als Sohn BeVs betrachteten* und dass in der Reihe Anum (Nun, anna), Bei (Gun lilla), Ea (Gun-kia oder Dugga), Merodach, die ?lteste babylonische G?ttergenea logie vorliegt." His argument about the sonship of Ea, then, is this: "On account of the stereotyped sequence Anu, Bel, Ea, it is more than probable that Ea was the son of Bel!" Upon this pillar of truth, this unquestionable fact of proof, his whole argument is built up. But let us go on. He says: "Anum hat keine Gemahlin... .das Fem. Anatu der lexicalischen Listen (ist) erst eine sp?tere Abstraction, welche in den alten bilinguen Texten wie in den In schriften von Tello noch nirgends vorkommt." This, I suppose, he probably will no longer maintain now, be cause the " An-nat" of Annu-b?nini will be known to him. Annu b?nini lived even before Sargon I., i. e., before 3800 B. C,?hence "An-nat" or the wife of Anu was known as early as that. He then speaks of the wives of Enlil and enumerates the Nin-lilla and the Nin-ghar-sagga and says : "Ein anderer (viz., name of the wives of Enlil) war 4din&amp;irGUR,4 eine ausge sprochene Himmelsoceansg?ttin, welche in den bilinguen Texten als "Mutter des Gottes Ea" {also demnach als Gemahlin des Vaters des Ea, eben des Bei)5 be zeichnet wird (4 R. i. 36 b)." Because Ea was declared on account of the stereotyped sequence : Anu Bel Ea, to be the son of Bel, and because dingirGUR is the 1 ' Die Identit?t der ?ltesten babylonischen und ?gyptischen G?ttergenealogie und der babylonische Ursprung der ?gyptischen Kultur, in Transactions of the International Congress of Orientalists.'''

This argument, then, is again built upon the sequence merely. He goes on : "Als G?ttin aber scheint1 d^GUR1 nicht die Aussprache GUR gehabt zu haben, sondern Ba'u_das geht aus folgenden_Gr?nden hervor : "i. Die G?ttin Ba-u heisst in den Gudea-Inschriften stets 'Tochter des Himmels, ' ist also eine Schwester, resp. (was in der babylonischen Mytho logie oft dasselbe ist) Gemahlin des Gottes Bei, demnach identisch mit der G?ttin Nin-lilla oder der ldin&amp;irGUR,1 welche letztere ja Mutter des Gottes Ea heisst." Ba-u is the wife of Bel, hence the same as Nin-lil or dingir GUR, who is the mother Ea. Hommel wishes to prove that Ba-u = dingir GUR, but takes it for granted that dingirGUR is = Nin-lil, without any arguments of his,?a fair exhibition of Hommel's argumenta tion ! He continues : "2. In einer Zauberformel (4 R. 29, No. 4) ist die ^'^GUR1 die Helferin der Kranken, besonders solcher an Augenweh leidenden... .in einem ?hnlichen _Text, K 2378 + 224, wird sie unmittelbar nach der G?ttin Nin-agha-kuddu (der Schwester Ea's) erw?hnt als 'Herrin der reinen Gew?sser,' nin a-gub-ba i'1-la. Auch die Ba-u wird (in H., K. T. 11. xxvi) gegen Kopf-, Herz-, und Augenweh zu gleich mit Nin-agha-kuddu und Gula angerufen." dingir GUR and Ba-u are invoked in case of sickness ; especially when the eyes are diseased, twice they are coupled together with Nin-agha-kuddu,?hence dingir GUR = Ba-u,?a strong argument, indeed ! For the same reason Hommel might have argued that Gu la, a later name for Ba-u, is = Nin-agha-kuddu = dingir GUR,?for he might have substituted for Ba-u the Gu-la ! By such argumen tations we can prove nothing, absolutely nothing, and everything ! "3. Die 1 dinsir GUR1 tr?gt den Beinamen ' mit reinen (azagga) H?nden ' ; die speciell der Ba-u heilige Stadt ist URU^azagga, d. i., 'reine Stadt' (wol gleich Nipur)." Because the word "azagga, pure," occurs in connection with "hands" in case of dingirGUR and in connection with URU or "city " in case of Ba-u,?hence dingirGUR = Ba-u ! Further com ment is unnecessary. Uru-azagga is not Nippur, but a suburb of Shirpurla. Given in cuneiform signs.</page><page sequence="30">THE CREATION-STORY OF GENESIS I. 597 "4. Das Ideogramm GUR1 wird von den babylonischen Gelehrten aus dr?cklich als Himmel* (ziku = sham?) erkl?rt (2 R. 50, 27), und die Ba-u heisst stets (siehe schon oben unter No. 1) 'Tochter des Himmels." " The sign GUR (notice, not dingirGUR) is = heaven, Ba-u is = daughter of heaven, hence GUR = Ba-u or heaven = daughter of heaven! And I may add dingirGUR = god of heaven = heaven = daughter of heaven, one follows from the other ! The heaven be comes his own daughter ! Splendid argumentation ! "5. Wie es einen Gott1 din^ir EN-GUR1 (=Ea, dann als Sohn der 1 din*ir GUR,1 urspr. aber wol = Bel) gibt (Jens. Kosmol., S. 245), so gab es auch einen Gott ldineirEN1-Ba-u [here Hommel refers to a note : vgl. auch 3 R. 67, 57_^"^"GUR^ra, NIN-1 GUR^ra, woraus zugleich hervorgeht, dass man sp?ter allerdings ldta?irGUR1 Gurra las, was aber nat?rlich f?r die alte Zeit nichts beweist] Urspr., S. 19, Anm. 1). Wie es einen alt babylonischen K?nigsnamen Ur-1 ^'GUR1 gab,_so gab es auch_ einen Ur-dineirl Ba-u." The nonsense that follows is too great to be reproduced here, and has, I suppose, been given up by Hommel himself. His argu ment is this: GUR == Ba-u (which he wants to prove, mark ye !), "Gleiches zu Gleichem zugesetzt giebt Gleiches, und Gleiches von Gleichem abgezogen giebt Gleiches." If we add to GUR and Ba-u a dingirEN we get the same, and if we abstract from dinsir EN-GUR and din&amp;irEN-Ba-u, a din8irEN we get again the same?but this pre supposes that GUR is already = Ba-u, which Hommel wishes to prove by this No. 5 ! 6. 1 dinPr GUR1 ist bei den Aegyptern die Morgend?mmerung (siehe unten) wie bei den Babyloniern die Bau-u (3 R. 55, 49b)." Here Hommel takes something as proven, which he has not yet proved ! "7.

Hommel presupposes or takes for granted without any further argument of his that Ningirsu is = Nirgal. He first must prove this, then we shall want to answer him. Jensen, e. g., takes Nin girsu to be = Ninib, see K. B. Ill1, p. 23, note *f. We do not know as yet who this Ningirsu is ! But see below ! The best, however, follows : "Aus all diesen Anf?hrungen, " says Hommel, "geht hervor,"1 dass2din^ir GUR2 and din*ir2Ba-u reine Synonyma1 sind, ganz dieselbe G?ttin von Haus aus bezeichnen} und dass h?chst wahrscheinlich1 auch die gew?hnliche Aussprache von 2din2irGUR2 Ba'u war, w?hrend die andere Aussprache gur offenbar nur dem unpersonificirten mythologischen Begriff GUR1 (ohne Gottheitsdeterminativ) eig nete. Ich habe dies deshalb so ausf?hrlich und eingehend hier BEWIESEN,1 weil in einem viel citirten Buche die betreffende Identification eine ' auch jeglicher Begr?ndung entbehrende' genannt worden ist (Jensen, Kosmologie, S. 245)." And I have taken this trouble to present to the public the splendid proofs of Professor Hommel, to show what nonsense they are. I do not possess Jensen's Kosmologie, nor is it accessible to me, hence do not know what arguments Jensen adduces to disprove Hommel. But arguments are not necessary at all to disprove the above-given "reasons" ; every man with a little common sense will see instantly that they are nonsensical. To quote Hommel8 again : "Wer so einen Unsinn denken, schreiben und schliesslich drucken lassen kann, der hat ?berhaupt den Anspruch ernst genommen zu werden verwirkt." All seven "reasons" of Hommel are built upon the sequence of Anu, B?i, Ea, which suffices to prove for him that Ea was the son of B?i, and because Ea was also the son of dinsir GUR he fol lows, that diQgirGUR must have been the wife of B?i, and thus the same as din?ir Ba-u ! The only passage in the old Babylonian inscriptions, where the sequence Anu, B?i, Ea may be found is that of Gudea, Statue B. Col. VIII. 45 ff.: An-e dinsirEn-lil-li, din8irNin-char-sag din*iTEN KI. And here Ea or dineirEN-KI is divided from B?i or di?gir En-lil by the wife of the latter !

Auf s?t ze und Abhandlungen, II. p. 140.</page><page sequence="32">the creation-story of genesis i. 599 sequence of the gods seems to be without any special order, as one can easily convince himself, by examining the inscriptions with regard to this point. Furthermore the celebrated trilingual list of gods,1 written in EME-SAL, Sumerian, and Semitic Babylonian, does not give the names of the gods in the sequence An, Bel, Ea? which it would have undoubtedly done, if Ea had been the son of Bel, as Hommel supposes?but in the order Ami,2 Ea, Bel. The same arrangement, viz.: Anu, Ea, Bel is found again in IV. R. i, 6ic ff. Hence, the sequence Anu, Bel, Ea would not prove any thing at all. And if it does not, then is Hommel's statement, to say the least, nonsense, that it is "nach der stereotypen Folge Anu, Bel, Ea, mehr als wahrscheinlich, dass sie (the Babylonians) auch den Ea als Sohn Bel's betrachteten und dass in der Reihe Anum, Bei, Ea, Merodach, die ?lteste babylonische G?ttergenea logie vorliegt." And if the sequence Anu, Bel, Ea does not prove anything, then it also follows that din?irGUR is not proven to be the wife of Bel or == Ba-u ! The other seven arguments or "rea sons" (Gr?nde) of Hommel are so foolish as to require no further refutation. But who then was dinsirGUR? In order to answer this ques tion it is necessary to inquire into the meaning of god AN and god KI ! The sign AN is translated in Semitic Babylonian generally by sham?, i. e., "heaven,'' and the sign KI generally by irtsitu, i. e., "earth." Both signs occur very often together in the attributes of En-lil (lugal-an-ki3) and Nin-char-sag (nin-an-ki3), where they no doubt stand for "heaven and earth." That the original meaning of AN was not so much "heaven" and that of KI not so much "earth" is evident from the following considerations : 1 II. R. 59 (see Hommel, S. L. p. 46). 2 Anu is called in the EME-SAL column = dim-me-ir ; in the Sumerian : AN ; and in the Semitic : i[-lum], i. e., the god icaf ??oxvv. From this it would follow that the writing AN-E might also be read dingir-e, and that of AN-tum = il-tum, and lastly that of NI-NI-tum =?-l?-tum, but in every case it would signify either the " god " or the "goddess" /car' kl-oxw?, i. e., Anu and his wife Annat. 3 See above, p. 586, 4. 5. 6.</page><page sequence="33">6oo THE MONIST. (1) "Heaven" in Sumerian means GISH and in EME-SAL : mu.1 (2) In the expression AN-ta = elish and KI-ta = shaplish, the AN stands simply for "that which is above" and the KI for "that which is below." Thus it happened that Jensen explained the name din*irEN-KI by "Herr, dessen was unten ist" = Ea.2 If this explanation be correct, it would follow from the analogy of the case that the name AN or EN-AN3 would have to be translated by "he who is above" or by "lord of that which is above." This idea of "being above" and "being below" is no doubt the original one, and because "that which is above" was consid ered to be the heaven thus it came in course of time that AN stood for heaven, and KI "being that which is below" came to mean "earth." 3. En-lil, we have seen, was in later inscriptions also called E-KUR-dumu-nunna, i. e., E-KUR,4 the son of Nunna. If this be true, then AN, the father of B?i (see above : B?l m?r r?sht? shame) must also have been, or been called, a NUN ! 4. But di??irEN-KI or Mr. KI was also called NUN as is ap parent from the name of his wife din*ir Dam-gal-nun-na, "the great wife of NUN." What this NUN means we know ; it is the zu-ab or aps?, the ocean. Thus we see instantly that AN was "the upper ocean" and KI the "lower ocean," or "the heavenly ocean" and "the terrestrial ocean," or as the Bible calls it, "the waters above the firmament" and " the waters below the firmament. " This specific meaning of god AN and god KI has been recognised already by other scholars, even by Hommel, although I do not know what arguments he brought in. Having thus established the original meaning of the words AN and KI respectively, we may turn to the relationship of AN and trilingual list of gods, II. R. 59, col. II. 1. 47. 2 K. B. Ill1, p. 21, note \. 3 Comp, the proper name EN-AN-NA-tum and see above, p. 591, 6. 4 E-KUR is originally the name of the temple of En-lil at Nippur.</page><page sequence="34">THE CREATION-STORY OF GENESIS I. 601 KI, i. e., inquire whether god KI was the son of En-lil and thus the grandson of ??d AN, or whether he was something else. In Assyrian we have a word achu which means "brother" and also "side." If this very same word is written ach? (contracted out of ach?iu) it means "enemy." Both words no doubt go back to the same root. But how then could the word achu possibly get the meaning "enemy" and be written ach?? My explanation is this: Ach?, or ach?iu, literally means : "he who or that which belongs to the brother," comp. Nippur? out of Nippur?iu, "he who belongs to Nippur," i. e., "a Nippurian." But "a brother" is in every case "the other," i. e., the "one who is not the ego" "who is in opposition to the ego," "who is opposed to the ego," and the one that is opposed to my ego is "my brother" and "my enemy !" If a person or a god is called "AN," then he who is his achu had to be called "KI" and as such he is "in opposition to" (an ach? !) to the AN. If AN means the "heavenly ocean" and KI the "terres trial ocean," we have here an achu in so far as they are both an ocean, hence also of the same stock or parents, but also an ach? in so far as the KI is opposed to the AN, "the terrestrial ocean" to "the heavenly ocean." Comp, here also AN-SAR and KI-SAR; as SAR they are achu, as AN and KI they are ach? !1 And now, if dineirGUR is called the mother of god Ea or En ki, it follows, because EN-KI is the achu and ach? of god AN, that dingirQURw^/ be the mother of?odAN too. AN and KI being the "heavenly and the terrestrial ocean," din?irGUR can only be the "primeval ocean."

The last two stand for Mr. and Mrs. GUR, i. e., for aps? and ti?mat, for elm and a^, or for and q^X nil respectively. din8irGUR on the other hand signifies only s?d GUR, without laying special emphasis upon the male or female part, or husband and wife. dinsirGUR thus becomes "the primeval ocean, Kar cfo;^," and is as such older than NIN-GUR or EN-GUR. This also proves that we had originally only a god KI,1?and because the heavenly is only a reflex of the earthly, this god KI became a wife : a NIN-KI, "Mrs. KI" ; and in order to distinguish the wife from the husband, or better, in order to avoid misunderstanding, the husband was called EN-KI, Mr. KI ; for din8ir KI alone, if used also of Mr. KI, would leave it doubtful whether s?d KI as a whole?male and female?were meant, or whether it stood for EN-KI only. Furthermore, if din?irGUR (notice not din*irNIN-GUR, as we might expect) is called the mother of EN-KI, we may see in this a striking parallel to the Babylonian creation story as well as to the Biblical,?according to both the heavenly and terrestrial ocean take their origin from the ti?mat or tehom, i. e., the descent was reckoned through the mother2 Tehom and ti?mat even in later times are used for "ocean" without any special reference to a mythological being as con sisting of two genders: the male and female gender; so GUR may have been primarily the ocean and only in later times acquired this mythological conception of being male and female, thus able to generate and perpetuate itself. However this may have been, all suggestions that might be made here are at the very best only guesses. May it suffice therefore to have shown that din&amp;ir GUR was the primeval ocean who brought forth by process of generation ?notice generation?two sons : AN and KI, who later on were to gether with GUR thought to be male and female, and thus able to perpetuate their own lines respectively. Having made this prob able, we can now explain the succession : Anu, B?i, Ea as well as Anu, Ea, Bel. In this latter sequence the two brothers are men 1 See above pp. 580, 9 ; 582 ff. 2 See above p, 576.</page><page sequence="36">THE CREATION-STORY OF GENESIS I. 603 tioned first, then follows B?l as the son of Anu. In the former sequence we have the father Anu together with his son Bel, and Ea is the ' am, the fathersbrother, who plays such an important r?le in old Arabic inscriptions that even the word itself became a god, ?the god 'Am.1 Anu, B?l, Ea, is thus proven to be what the Arabs call a racht, i. e., a community consisting of a head or "abu" = Anu, of an 'am = E a, and of a nephew = Bel,2 who form the first triad in the Babylonian pantheon as well as in the Assyrian, which triad, as we have seen, goes back to the Sumerian concep tion of the theogony and cosmogony. As AN, originally the "heavenly ocean,'' became in later times the sham? or "heaven," thus KI, originally the "terrestrial ocean" became later on the irtsitu or "earth." We would expect that AN and KI became in consequence of this also the "god of heaven" and "the god of earth" respectively. But this is not the case. The "god of heaven and earth " was B?l, for he is repeatedly called the "lugal-an-ki, "the king of heaven and earth." "Heaven and earth" were thus considered to be closely connected, yes, to be one, and what this one thing was called, we shall see, when we come to speak of din8ir En-lil. And if "heaven and earth" were considered to be one, it is, of course, natural, that we should not find a god in this Sumerian theogony who is called LUGAL-KI, shar irtsiti " the king of the earth." Hence, there does not seem to have existed at the time of the Sumerians a so-called "ba'al of the soil," who plays such an important r?le among the Semitic peoples. The god KI had sons and daughters, all of whom we have met already above. It only remains here to explain their names. The sign by which Nina is expressed is composed of ESH or AB = "abode," with inserted CHA or "fish." Signs, when inserted into another sign, may be either an indicator of the pronunciation or an indicator of the sense. The latter I take to be the case here. 1 See Hommel, Die s?darabischen Alterth?mer des Wiener Hofmuseums M?nchen, 1899, p. 28 ff. 2 See also Proksch, Die Blutrache bei den alten Arabern, p. 23, and Winck ler, M. V. A. G., 1901, 4, p. 16.</page><page sequence="37">6o4 THE MONIST. The sign "fish" may either stand for "fish" itself, or for "plenty." Nina then would be either a fishgoddess, or a goddess of- plenty. The goddess Nidaba1 "was the goddess of grain," as even the Ideogranun indicates it.2 din?irDumu-zi because = iluDu-'-u-zu, and because to him was dedicated originally the sixth and in later times the fourth month called SHU-KUL-NA or "month of sowing" must have been "the god of verdure."3 According to the analogy we should expect for Nina's husband also some such signification as "verdure," or "fishes," or "plenty," or "grain ; " this however cannot be made out as yet. It may not be impossible that the name din?ir Nin-dub, because dub means "clay," then "clay tablet," may make that god to have been orig inally "the god of the clayground." However this may have been, the significations of the names of Nina, Dumu-zi, Nidaba, suffice to show us that we have to see in them the gods of either "what the earth produces" or "what the sea produces." If this be true then it follows that the din8irEN-KI, the "terrestrial ocean," was thought to contain the earth also, i. e., he was "the waters which contained the dry ground," or else he could not have produced sons or daughters who are the gods of "the produce of the earth" ! As already said above, the Sumerians do not seem to have had "a god of the dry land or soil "kclt' cfox^v." What may possibly be the reason for this phenomenon? We know from the Gilgamesh epic?and our present investigation con firms it, as we shall see?that Eridu or NUN-ki, the city of Ea or EN-KI was one of the oldest cities of Babylonia, from which prac tically the whole of the specific Babylonian religion took its origin. Eridu, when the Gilgamesh epic was written, was a seaport town on the Persian Gulf, while to-day it is one hundred and thirty miles 1 For references see E. B. H. Index, gods, p. 444, sub.

The former was the festival of the wailing for Tammuz, the latter that of his resurrection.

Here the Sumerians of old saw how new earth or dry land was added year by year to the already existing dry ground. Hence it was quite natural for them to think that "the earth was contained in the terrestrial ocean." But water is also necessary for vegetation ! Hence also, vegetation, verdure of the dry ground, were made to be children of din?irEN-KI. In the ocean are also fishes, etc., and thus Nina the fishgoddess became of necessity his child. Thus we would expect "the ba'al of the soil" to be a son of EN-KI. It may very well be possible that future investigations will shed light upon this question. At the present it will be best not to put too great an emphasis upon this omission, for any of the gods not yet identified may become in future times "a god of the soil."1 The firstborn of EN-LIL or B?i is the god ZU, i. e., dingirEN ZU or also called dinsirUru-ki. This latter is translated into the Semitic-Babylonian by Nannar,2 i. e., "the luminary." The "na-an na-ri shame-e ? irtsitim," or "the luminary of heaven and earth,"8 was god Sin. And "Sin" translates the Sumerian EN-ZU. In the Monolith Inscription of Shalmaneser II.4 we have a god called "ilu Na-nir shame-e irtsi-tim," i. e., "the god the luminary6 of heaven and earth." Hence there can be no doubt that EN-ZU is = Uru-ki = Sin = Nannar = Moon. What the name ZU means we cannot tell. It is explained in the syllabaries by "to know," "to be wise," "to learn," "to understand," etc., etc. It may be probable that Gudea6 of old was obliged to confess of Sin: dinsirEn-zu mu-ni galu-nu-gab-ne : "Sin?his name no man has ever disclosed, understood, explained," because he?Sin? treading his quiet path for all those ages past acquired in course of time a wisdom and knowledge so great that they cannot be *Does perhaps the dineirDun-gur-(an) belong here, who is called the dineirEn temen-[an] (E. B. H. p. 118, note i)? The temen-an, the "foundation of heaven," would be the "earth." But a ba'al of the soil is quite different from a ba'al of the earth. See however below ! ?IV. R. 9f-H? 3V.

This god "who passes our understanding" had two children, UD and dinsir Innanna. The god UD "the bright, or shining one," is called in the oldest inscriptions, "the king filled with splen dor,"1 and is identified in the later inscriptions with the god Sha mash or "the sun." His sister or wife?for that is the same in the oldest inscriptions2?is the "goddess of Innanna." What the In nanna was we cannot tell as yet. She was later on identified with the "evening star" as well as with "the morning star," the former being the precursor of the moon, the latter that of the sun. As "morning star," which leads the king out to battle, she was con sidered in later times to be a male, a god, but retained her feminine name and was called either Ishtar or A-nu-ni-tum b?lit tach?zi.8 This latter title she had already in the oldest inscription, where she is called "nin m?,"4 i. e., mistress of battle?hence feminine! It may not be impossible that even in the oldest time din*ir Innanna was assigned to both functions, viz., to that of "the evening star," thus becoming "the goddess of love," and to that of "the morning star," as such being called the mistress of battle. The Innanna then would express the function common to both : the morning and the evening star. This function in every case must be a double one : the morning star announces the end of the night but also the beginning of the day; the evening star in like manner shows that ^ee, e. g., Gudea, Statue B.

Who is this Nin-Gir-su? Hommel2 identified him with Nergal. Jensen,8 with Ninib, the god of war. In another place4 he reaches the same conclusion by the following consideration : The temple which Ur-Ba-u and Gudea built for Nin-Gir-su was called E-ninn?, i. e., the temple of the number fifty, and ninn? is again = Ninib.5 This E-ninnu was also called E dinsir Im-gig-ghu-bar-bar. From this Jensen concludes (/. c.) : &lt;&lt;dingirj.m_ etc. ist eine Erweiterung des Namens. Die Gruppe ist zu deuten : (des Gottes) welcher den finstern (gig) Himmel (im) erhellen (bar-bar) m?ge (ghu), und spielt auf Ninib als die Fr?h sonne an." This explanation was also accepted by me in my E. B. H6. Thureau-Dangin,7 on the other hand, separated the latter name into din*irIm-gig-ghu and bar-bar, i. e., "the divine bird Im-gig" and "bright," the bird he identified with the eagle, the well-known emblem of Shir-pur-la?Girsu, referring at the same time to M. Heuzey, Origines orientales, p. 41, where an imprint of a seal cylinder is published which is said to contain a representation of Nin-Girsu as described by Gudea in his celebrated dream. On account of the importance of the passage in Gudea's dream it might seem well to examine it more closely. Gudea has a dream8 in which appears to him a "man." The description of this "man" is given in all its details. Gudea does not know this "man" who had commanded him to build the temple 1 See the sign SUCH (= Innanna) V. R. f J, 1. 14. 15, and H. W.

And because the E-ninn? is called the temple of DINGIR Im gig-ghu-bar-bar, it follows that the latter name was also a surname of Nin-Gir-su. From this it also follows that "the flying dark clouds" are or may become sometimes "very bright" ! The UG, which are at the left and the right side of "the man's" feet will and must signify a similar thing. Now, I do not think that Thureau-Dangin is right in translating UG by "lions," although UG may have that meaning. Thureau-Dangin1 himself says: "Il est probable que UG-GAL est identique ? UD-GAL." UD has also the reading UG ! And UD or better UG-GAL is translated by ?mu and means "storm" or "great wind."2 UG alone would mean "wind" or "storm" too.8 The A-NE at the head of this "man" might be taken either as the plural of A, i. e., "rain," "waters," or probably better as A + BIL, i. e., "water and fire." What this fire was we shall see directly. The remaining RI-BA has been translated by Thureau-Dangin in his "Songe de Goud?a" quite correctly. It no doubt means that the man was as large or great as the heavens4 and earth, extended over heaven and earth ; his course5 was so wide and so large that it went all over the heavens and the earth. Thus the description might be interpreted as follows : There appeared a "man" to me who was as regards his size as large and extended as the heavens and earth. Rain and fire were above him! At the sight of which Gudea is completely awe-stricken and is forced to exclaim : Surely it is a god !?such impression this rain and fire made upon him. At his sides were, i. e., he was surrounded by "flying dark clouds" and was carried by a "stormflood," and *Z. A. XV. p. 49. 2 Delitzsch, H. W. B. p. 33. 3Cyl.

H. W. B. p. 159.</page><page sequence="44">the creation-story of genesis i. 6ll at his feet there were two "storms" or "tempests." The only god whom such a description fits is of course Ramm?n. That this Nin Gir-su cannot be any other but Ramm?n is corroborated by the following considerations : 1. Nin-Gir-su has a special servant: the god Nin-sar who is called the gir-lal din?irNin-Gir-su-ka.1 Gir is=birqu, "lightning," "thunderbolt," and lal = nash?, "to lift up, carry," or = shapaku, "to pour out." Nin-Gir-su thus is not only the god of rain and storm, but also the god of lightning, or else he could not have a "thunderbolt carrier," who occasionally may "pour out" the thun derbolts. In old Babylonian times there also existed a dinsir Nin Gir,2 who, no doubt, is the same as the din^ir Nin-sar, for Nin-Gir means the "lord of the Gir or thunderbolts." The GIR or "thun derbolt" is also contained in Nin-GIR-su as well as in GIR-su ! Even the bar-bar of dinsir Im-gig-ghu-bar-bar indicates the bright ness and flashes of the lightning or thunderbolts.8 This is also the reason why I would read for A-NE=A-BIL.4 Nin-Gir-su = Ram m?n appears unto Gudea in rain, storm, and fire, i. e., flashes of lightning. 2. The "dream" itself of Gudea speaks for our interpretation. The opening of Cylinder A describes the terrible drought of Girsu Shirpurla, which can only come to an end by some pious deed of Gudea. And what is more natural for Gudea than to build a temple in honor of just the god of rain, storm, and lightning, that the drought might cease ! And this god is Nin-Gir-su = din*iT Im-gig ghu-bar-bar = Ramm?n, who promises thereupon that the drought shall cease after the temple has been built.6 1Urakagina, D?e. XLIX. = E. B.

Now we also understand the so-called second triad of the Babylonian gods; they are ZU, UD, and X = Nin-Gir-su, or in Semitic : Sin, Shamash, and Ramm?n. This is the common se quence in which they occur. Sin is the head or abu,2 Shamash his son, and Ramm?n is the 'am, the "father's brother." Here then we have the other racht ! If the enumeration be : Sin, Ramm?n, Shamash,3 it would be parallel to Anu, Ea, B?i, i. e., the two brothers mentioned first, and then the son of the former. The two triads of the Babylonian pantheon are two rachts and parallel to each other; they go back to the oldest times of the Babylonian history?another proof for the great age of the Sumer ian civilisation ! dingir Ba-u, the wife of dinsir Nin-Gir-su, had seven sons,4 who were at the same time the "banda" of Nin-Gir-su.6 What these "seven sons" stood for, is hard to tell. Three possibilities might be taken into consideration : (1) They represent the seven planets.6 (2) The seven Igigi, or spirits of heaven. (3) The seven winds or evil spirits, who are closely connected with Ramm?n.7 1 For references see E. B. H., Index, Gods, p. 443 sub I. 2 This fact explains why Sin is called in the celebrated Moon-hymn (IV. R. 9) abu. He is the head, for this means " abu " here, of the racht. The abu = father (of the gods) is En-Hi, as was seen above. See also Winckler, M. V. A. G., 1901, 4, p. 20. In later inscriptions the following gods are called abu il?ni ; B?i, Ashur Anu, Ea and Sin. See H. W. B. sub. abu, p. 3. 3 As e. g. in the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser II. 11. 6, 7. 4 See above, p. 590, note 6. 5Gudea, Cyl. B.

There we have "the sun," "the moon," "the morning star," and "the seven planets." 7 See, e. g., IV. R. 5, 29 ff., Delitzsch, H. W.

C.1 Both would signify the " east wind," as coming from the Persian Gulf. Nin-sar, too, would speak for the winds, storms, lightnings, that accompany Ramm?n. By Urukagina are also mentioned the Za-za-ru2 or first son, the Im-pa-ud-du3 or second son,4 and the Nin-sar. This latter I take to be not only the same as the dinsir Nin-gir but also as the din&amp;ir GHE (or GAN)-gir-nun-na?the one is the gir-lal, "thunderbolt carrier," the other is the "lord of the thunderbolt," and the third has at least something to do with the GIR as the name Ghe (or Gan)-GIR-nun-na indicates.5 The fifth son Ghe (or GAN)-shag ga probably is identical again with the Dun-shag-ga, who, as we have seen, is called "a son of Nin Gir-su."6 Ka-ur-mu, the sixth, and Za-ar-mu, the seventh son, are known to me only from this passage. The din8ir G?l-alim, from whom Gudea receives "dominion and a great scepter,"7 and who, as we have seen, is also a son of Nin Gir-su, I would like to identify with Nin-sar the gir-lal of Nin Gir-su. Gudea, no doubt, wants to say by this, that he has re ceived a scepter like that of Nin-sar, i. e., "a thunderbolt," by means of which he was able to reign and put down, if necessary, his enemies.

Uru-ka-gi-na,1 shows that the whole system of the Babylonian the ogony was fully developed as early as 4500 B. C. This Nin-Gir-su, this god of lightning, thunder, rain, and storm, was "the warrior," or "mighty hero"2 of Bel or En-lil. En-lil has indeed a strong hero ! From this follows, that when ever B?i appears, he is accompanied by Nin-Gir-su, i. e., B?i ap pears in company with lightning, thunder, and clouds. And who does not think instantly of the m.T of the Old Testament who too appears in company of such an "ur-sag lig-ga?" Exod. xiv. 19 ff. we read (R. V.): 14 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them : and the fihar*of cloud removed from before them and stood behind them : and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel : and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night." Can we possibly have a more striking parallel to the dingir Nin Gir-su ur-sag lig-ga din8ir En-lil ? The ur-sag ot "warrior" corre sponds to "the angel" Nin-Gir-su is the ur-sag of En-lil, and here we have the "angel of God," i. e., m?T ! But "the angel" appears here under a cloud. Nin-Gir-su is called din*irIm, i. e., "the cloud." The "cloud removed from before them and stood behind them, dingirNin-Gir-su is called "the flying Im-gig. This cloud was dark ness and light, Nin-gir-su is called dineir Im-gig-ghu-bar-bar, i. e., "dark cloud flying, flashing up, or very bright." Hence there can not be any doubt that "the angel of God" is the ur-sag of m,T and thus a striking parallel to the old dinsir Nin Gir-su. But from this it also follows that nw himself is no storm-god as Stade8 and Winckler4 think, but the storm-god is "the angel" or the ur-sag, i. e., Nin-Gir-su, who accompanies En-lil or ni.T- En-lil or nVP is the B?i, "the Lord" Kar ^o\rjv must therefore necessarily be accom panied by his special "ur-sag" or "angel" and this is "the thun dering and lightning dark cloud," hence ni.T is usually represented 1 Were it not for the fact that the "barrel-cylinder" is broken, we might have found mentioned on it all seven sons. 2 The ur-sag, or ur-sag lig-ga, see above, pp. 590, 579. 8 Geschichte des Volkes Israels, Vol. I., 429 ff. * Geschichte Israels, Vol. I., p. 37 ff.</page><page sequence="48">the creation-story of genesis i. 615 as coming in the company of just such a cloud.1 En-lil as "king of heaven and earth" and "king of the gods" speaks and acts only through his ur-sag, i. e., lit. translated "head-servant," "prime minister,"2 so mrr "the lord of hosts" speaks also through his "head-servant" or "prime minister": the ?and what this "prime minister says or does, that says or does mrr or En-lil.

Then the earth shook and trembled, The foundations also of the mountains moved And were shaken, because he was wroth. 8. There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured : Coals were kindled by it, 9. He bowed the heavens also and came down.* And5 thick darkness* was under him, 10.

Thus m.T is not a "god of storm," but "the lord who is accompanied by the storm,'?a difference ! But what or who is this din8irEn-lil?m.T? Hommel2 takes d*ngirEn-lil to be the "Herr der Luft," because LIL=zaq?qu3 = Sturmwind, wind, and the kur-kur in lugal-kur-kur as signifying "die Berge des Luftreichs, die Wolken." This latter he derives from the signification of dinsir Nin-char-sag and the surname of Bel : KUR-GAL, "the great mountain."4 Against this might be said that a zaq?qu or wind is not yet "air," and that in later (Assyrian) inscriptions the lugal-kur-kur is always translated, not by shar shad?, but always ilub?l m?t?ti.5 On accout of this latter transla tion LIL was taken to signify "the lord of the lands." The main attributes of Enlil were, as we have seen, "the king of heaven and earth," "the king of the lands," "the king of the gods," "the father of the gods." As time went on, these specific attributes of Enlil were applied even to other gods according to the influence they were able to exercise over the inhabitants of early Babylonia. Thus it happens that, e. g., the moon-god Sin had the following arrogant titles : ilu Sin b?l il?ni sha shame-e u irtsi-tim shar il?ni il? (written ilu -f- pl.) sha il?ni a-shi-ib shame-e rab?te.6 4- "Nin-Gir-su guerrier de Bel" 5. de ces noms seront nomm?s. 1 See also Gudea, Cyl.

Yes, when god Marduk occupied the most supreme place in the Babylonian pantheon, Nab?-n?'id does not know how to honor him more than by calling him dingirEN-LIL il?ni ilu Marduk (AMAR-UD),1 which is generally transcribed ilub?l il?ni ?ln Mar duk, and translated "the lord of the gods, Marduk,"?the original, and no doubt intended signification however is : "the EN-LIL of the gods (viz. :) Marduk." By thus terming his supreme god, Nab? n?'id wanted to show that Marduk takes the place of EN-LIL of old. Above we have seen that "heaven and earth" were considered by the old Babylonians to be closely connected, so closely as to require only one god ; and if there was only one god for "heaven and earth," then this latter must have been considered as one. This one thing, this heaven-earth, AN-KI, has, when thus looked upon as one the name LIL. The first triad, when enumerated has mostly the sequence Anu, B?i, Ea, i. e., Bel is mentioned between his father and his 'am "father's-brother." That just this sequence should have become a stereotyped one must have a meaning. The explanation of this sequence no doubt is the following: AN "the heavenly ocean," and KI "the terrestrial ocean" are separated ac cording to the Bible (Gen. i.) by the so-called yp {ragi?) generally translated by "firmament," which latter is there "to keep back the waters of the heavenly ocean." This conception however is only one-sided. For we may very well ask, if the heavenly ocean is kept back by a srpi, by what is the terrestrial ocean kept back ? And when Job2 complains : "Am I a sea or a sea-monster That thou settest a watch over me," he did not think so much of a "heavenly sea or sea-monster" that is to be guarded, but of an earthly sea or sea-monster. Thus we would necessarily expect that there was also a ypl for the terres the "god of the gods." With il? (=pl!) comp, also the fluralis majestaticus DVDK. But the "king of the gods" is an attribute of En-LIL. ^ab?-n?'id, Thoncylinder aus Sippar, A.-W. p. 40, col.

The j^p of the heavenly ocean is called "heaven."1 The "heaven"1 or "the firmament of heaven"2 keeps back the waters above. The D*fc$n ypl itself proves that there must have been also another }rp besides that of heaven?or else the D^ttt?n would, to say the least, be quite unnecessary. Thus, even P. still was under the impression that there existed a D*fc#n S^p and, of course, as we may conclude a ynxn jrpl. As the one ^pp is the "heaven," so the other j^pl is the "earth." This one jrp that stands between the heavenly and terrestrial ocean, and keeps back the waters above the firmament as well as below the firmament is called by the Sumerians : LIL. Thus we understand the succession : AN-LIL-KI or Anu, B?i, Ea it stands for: the heavenly waters?the y*p?the terrestrial ocean, by the y^p they are divided, by it they also are kept back, the heavenly ocean by the y*&gt;pi which is the "heaven" and the ter restrial ocean, by the which is the " earth. " Trius it also hap pened that according to P8 the heaven had to have "windows" (D*fc#n WlX) through which the waters of the heavenly ocean could pour down at the time of the flood, and the "terrestrial ocean"? the HD1 Dinn as he calls it?had likewise to have some exit through which the waters might come, and these exits are the "wells" or fYt?*?2fc. From this is also evident that not only the heavenly ocean was "kept back" but also the terrestrial ocean?the heavenly by the heaven and the terrestrial by the earth : heaven and earth thus form the r^pl or LIL. And EN-LIL standing between the AN and KI, i. e., "the heavenly and terrestrial ocean," becomes thus the yp-), and the latter again under a twofold aspect : the heaven and earth?hence he is "the king of heaven and earth," or of the 2r*p-) that stands between the AN and KI !

H. p. 229.</page><page sequence="54">THE CREATION-STORY OF GENESIS I. 621 If we translate this genealogy and compare it with that of Gen. i. we would get the following result : In the beginning there was a chaos which was thought to be a male and female, perhaps in one person. The Biblical name for this chaos was tohu-vabohu, but as male and female it was called either "waters" and "Tehom," or "Spirit of Elohim " and "darkness." In the Babylonian account the names apsu and ti?mat are used, while in the original Sumerian the chaos was simply called GUR which at one time or another was differentiated and became "Mr. Gur" and "Mrs. Gur," i. e., EN-GUR or NIN-GUR. From these first parents everything in heaven and upon earth took its origin. EN-GUR and NIN-GUR had two sons: AN and KI, i. e., they begot the "heavenly ocean" and the "terrestrial ocean." In the Babylonian-Semitic account the two sons were called AN-SAR and KI-SAR, who again probably correspond to the Lachmu and La chamu. Genesis i., on the other hand, calls them "waters that are above the firmament" and "waters that are below the firmament." According to all three accounts, these waters take their origin from Tehom,1 i. e., the descent is reckoned through the mother. AN, the "heavenly ocean," has a son called LIL, i. e., the jrp or firmament. The Sumerians reckoned, as it seems, to this firmament also the "earth," for it was divided into "heaven" and "earth," which served as barriers for the heavenly and terrestrial ocean. In the Bible, however, the earth or dry ground is born by the terrestrial ocean. This was, no doubt, also the Sumerian con ception, for KI does not signify simply the terrestrial ocean but also the earth. It may not be impossible, however, that LIL was thought to be a son of both :2 of AN and KI,?for both oceans were 1 See above, pp. 602, 576. 2 This probably explains why Marduk, who was, as we have seen, identified with EN-LIL or Bel, is called the aplu r?sht? sha Ea, II. R. ?4d, comp, with 17c. d. and in Damascius : rov ?? "Aov (i. e., Ea) kcll Aclvkti? (i. e., Damkina) vi?? ? Brj?io? (i. e., acoording to later times the Bel naf ??oxyv : Marduk). See also Carus, The Mo?iistt April, 1901, p. 406. That one son should have two fathers is not strange, it merely would presuppose polyandry with descent reckoned through the father. For a classical example see here the Minean inscription Hal. 504 = Hommel, S?d arabische Chrestomathie, p. 94.</page><page sequence="55">622 THE MONIST. thought to be joined together beyond the firmament or ?this being simply the natural observation that the heaven rests upon the earth, and mutatis mutandis : the heavenly ocean upon the ter restrial. Remarkable also is that Ba-u together with LIL, her husband, are said to be "the firstborn" of AN,?surely an evident trace that the differentiation of the sexes was comparatively late. If LIL was the firstborn, then also his wife had to be the firstborn : both are thus husband and wife, and brother and sister. The god LIL, by virtue of his being the jryi or "heaven" and "earth," became the "father" and the "king of the gods of heaven and earth,"?not only of the gods, however, but also of all other creatures, as still may be seen from one of the attributes of his wife: Sal (Nin)-ih-si-na who is called: "the mother of the world, the one who created the creatures of the world."1 And as the attri butes of the wife belong also to the husband, hence god LIL was, according to Sumerian conception, the creator or father of the gods and of the creatures of the world. The gods who are begotten by LIL are ZU or Sin, the moon-god, Ramrnan or Nin-Gir-su, "the thunderer19 or simply ' 'cloud," who again is the 'am of UD or Shamash, the sun-god, and Innanna or Ishtar, the morning or evening star. By Ba-u the wife of Ramrnan again are born the seven winds. Also according to Gen. i. "the two great lights and the stars" belong to the 2Tp-].2 We now understand why P is so awfully afraid of naming these two great lights by name. He knew that they were the sun and the moon. He did not want to mention their names,?for if he did then he would have had to use for "sun" the Hebrew ?fct? (Shemesh), which apparently was too closely related to the Semitic-Babylonian Shamash and might have betrayed a heathenish origin of his (P's) whole cosmogony. The same may be said of Ishtar or int?i? ! Shamash was at the time of P one of the principal gods,?and whatever smelled of heathenism was blotted out by P ! The terrestrial ocean according to the Sumerian cosmogony begets the fishes, the verdure, grain, etc. It ought to be noticed 1 E. B. H. p. 202, note I. 1. 2D^t?n 3&gt;yO Gen. i. 14.</page><page sequence="56">THE CREATION-STORY OF GENESIS I. 623 here that Nina or the fish-goddess is called the sister of Nin-Gir-su, hence stands with him on the same level. According to the gene alogy given above, we would expect, however, that she would have been called the sister of LIL. This, no doubt, is due to the fact that LIL is the son, or was considered to be the son, of both AN and KI, thus standing between the latter two on one side and ZU, Ramm?n, and Nina on the other side. Also according to P the verdure, fishes, etc., etc., derive their origin from "the waters which are below the firmament," i. e. from KI ! Considering these striking similarities between the Biblical account of the creation story according to P and that of the Sume rians,?there can b? no doubt, that the former is derived from the latter. We would have to distinguish, then, in Genesis i. three differ ent sources : 1. The P source. To this belongs the system of seven days, the formula given above and the different changes that were necessary in order to make the whole agree with the notions of P. The P source again was based upon 2. The Semitic-Babylonian Creation Story. This latter was used only in so far as it agreed with the conceptions?theological and otherwise?of P. All that was against P's conception was elimi nated from it. While thus "criticising" the Semitic-Babylonian creation story, P quite unconsciously retained so much of it that he reproduced or came very near to the original 3. Sumerian Source, which source represented the creation not as the result of a fight, but as a natural process of generation and perpetuation. Traces of No. 2 are : the conception of the original chaos as Tehom or darkness unto whom is^opposed "the spirit of Elohim"; the dividing of the Tehom into the waters above and below the fir mament, and last but not least, the ?na or light,?the attribute of Marduk. To No. 3 belongs the toledoth or genealogy of heaven and earth, for the writer expressly says himself that what he has given in chapter one is a yixm D^DETi nV"D?n, a generation and per petuation of heaven and earth. In this sense n*T&gt;in toledoth has to</page><page sequence="57">624 THE MONIST. be understood, and thus we get a further corroboration of our state ment that Gen. i. is not a " ere at io ex nihilo" but a generation and perpetuation, a development out of the primeval chaos,?an evolu tion. Thus the Biblical creation-story of P. is proved to be the re daction of a Sumerian Theogony and Cosmogony. But where is Marduk? We have seen already above, that Marduk is not known in Babylonia before the time of the first dy nasty of Babylon or about 2400 B. C. He then was imported by that dynasty which was of Canaanitish origin. Marduk therefore was probably a Canaanitish god. He was a god of light. The Canaanites seeing that there were in the Sumerian pantheon sev eral gods of light as Sin, Shamash, Ramm?n, Ishtar, etc., made Marduk to be an "attendant " an AMAR of Shamash or UD?call ing him AMAR-UD ! This name expressed on one hand as nearly as possible the "nature" of the god, as well as on the other hand the sound of their own "Marduk." When the Canaanites had in course of time subdued Babylonia and had made Babylon their capital with Marduk as the patron, Marduk became the head of all gods, "the king and father of the gods of heaven and earth," yes, he was called even din?ir EN-LIL,1 thus he not only became identi fied with god LIL, but all attributes belonging to EN-LIL orig inally, were now ascribed to Marduk. EN-LIL was, as we have seen, also the "father of all creatures and their creator"?hence Marduk became the creator too, and he being at the same time the god of light, it happened that the Creation was conceived of in later times to be a fight between Marduk the Creator and the darkr ness or Tehom. Marduk, the god of light, and his fight with Te hom or Ti?mat becomes thus a specific Babylonian-Semitic-Cana anitish production, hence also one of late origin. P. by thus criticising and eliminating the mythical element of this fight of Marduk and Tehom, becomes thus the first higher critic. If he did not succeed in presenting to us the original pure Sumerian Theogony and Cosmogony, this was due to the fact that See above, p. 618.</page><page sequence="58">the creation-story of genesis i. 625 he criticised with a purpose?criticised the Babylonian Semitic ac count to adopt it to his own theory of the Creation in seven days in order to establish for his Sabbath?and thus for all his laws and ordinances connected with the Sabbath?the greatest possible age. But let us be thankful to this first of all higher critics : he has made it possible for us to follow up his account and trace it to its original source. Thus we have another striking example of P.'s late age. He lived in Babylonia, was therefore able to acquaint himself with Babylonian ideas and gave us an account of the Crea tion which together with his "10 antediluvian fathers "may be traced to the very oldest sources at our disposal : to the Sumerian Cosmogony and Theogony.
