<plain_text><page sequence="1">Israel Exploration Journal VOLUME 38 NUMBER 4 1988 Basalt Pillar Figures from the Golan and the Huleh Region* CLAIRE EPSTEIN Department of Antiquities and Museums SINCE the publication more than a decade ago of a group of nine basalt pillar figures from the Golan,1 many more have come to light and today over fifty examples are known. Several of those already published were found in secondary usage in villages located near subsequently identified Chalcolithic sites, where they were presumably found on the surface. By contrast, the great majority of the pillar figures discussed here were either excavated in reliable house contexts or discovered within the limits of a recognized Chalcolithic site.2 Despite differences of opinion regarding their appropriate designation,3 it is generally agreed that they were of cultic significance, and since they were originally placed in houses, there are good grounds for suggesting that they formed part of a domestic cult intended to promote fertility. The horned pillar figures are clearly associated with pastoralism, those sculpted * All illustrations are reproduced by courtesy of the Department of Antiquities and Museums.

The scale drawings were prepared by Michal Ben-Gal, Zivit Noselevitch, Tedy Mazzola, A. Kranz and Nira Kopelov. I am greatly indebted to the latter, not only for the arrangement of the figures and plates, but especially for her painstaking work to achieve a greater degree of uniformity among drawings made over many years by several different hands. The re-arrangement of Fig. 2 was necessitated by the discovery of No. 2B at the end of 1988, after this article had been completed. 1 Claire Epstein: Basalt Pillar Figures from the Golan, IEJ 25 (1975), pp. 193-200. 2 This paper includes most of the pillar figures published over a decade ago (above, n. 1). Not included are several badly broken statues and fragments of others found in excavations or on the surface. Of the 51 figures recorded, 42 come from well-known Chalcolithic sites. Of these, 35 were excavated in house contexts. 3 Pirhiya Beck and S. Yeivin: On C.

On the other hand, pillar figures without horns can be interpreted as associated with the general concept of fertility and abundance, especially in relation to man himself and the crops he cultivated. Attributes of the pillar figures such as horns, a nose or modelled goat's head (PI. 29:E) are also found on different kinds of vessels and may well have been credited with apotropaic powers and used as protective talismans. The circularity basic to all pillar figures may also have had symbolic significance.4 An earlier example of a cult 'image' in the form of a rough stone pillar was found set in a round niche in a Pre-Pottery Neolithic house at Jericho;5 while in several contemporary ossuary burial caves there were stela-like stones, some with rounded tops;6 at Benei Beraq was found a slab of red limestone, probably brought from afar.7 The study of a large number of pillar figures belonging to different types reveals clear stylistic groups, and it may well be that similar examples were fashioned in the same workshop. Although no trace has been found of these, it can be assumed that they did exist, at least in the larger settlements. Be that as it may, it is clear that all the pillar figures were the expression of a common approach and a shared belief in the efficacy of the completed figure ? irrespective of size, whether bi-conical or tapering, horned or bearded, with or without eyes, having a prominent or small nose, pointed or rounded ear-knobs, or even lacking facial features altogether. Made without exception of basalt, all share the essential traits of a circular, pillar-like form and a shallow offering bowl above. Prior to their discovery in diagnostic assemblages, pillar figures were picked up on the surface by local villagers who had, no doubt, found them in fields and pastures at sites where fourth millennium B.C.E. settlements had once been located.8 Several of these figures were eventually discovered in secondary usage as building stones in houses and courtyards, or incorporated in modern fences, stone heaps and the like 4 Claire Epstein: Cult Symbols in Chalcolithic Palestine, Bolletino del Centro di Studi Preistorici 19 (1982), pp. 63-82. 5 Kathleen M.

It is interesting to note that Kaplan interpreted pillars of this kind, so clearly associated with the dead, as having apotropaic significance, like the Golan pillar figures which are manifestly associated with the living. His excavations were carried out more than twenty years before the discovery of the Golan Chalcolithic culture in 1973, when pillar figures came to light in reliable domestic contexts for the first time. 8 In the late 1970s a farmer chasing a runaway cow picked up a pillar figure on the surface within the confines of a subsequently excavated site near the South Daliyyot waterfall (Fig. 6:37).</page><page sequence="3">BASALT PILLAR FIGURES 207 1.

Moreover, over a decade before controlled excavations were carried out in the Golan, a pillar figure was found on the surface at Tel Turmus (Fig. 7:46), situated some 2 km. west of the Golan scarp in the northern Huleh valley (Fig. 1:12). In the course of surveys at the site, the front part of a basalt zoomorphic figure of a ram with an offering bowl on its back also came to light.9 While the full significance of these two pieces was not apparent at the time, they prompted trial excavations which revealed the remains of Chalcolithic 9 Claire Epstein: Laden Animal Figurines from the Chalcolithic Period in Palestine, BASOR 258 (1985), p. 55, Fig. 2a, b.</page><page sequence="4">208 CLAIRE EPSTEIN architecture and a related assemblage.10 It was only after the discovery of pillar figures in houses in the Golan that their true significance was appreciated. One of the most striking features of so many of the excavated examples is an extremely large and prominent, curving nose, often extending to half the height of the statue. Its depiction in this exaggerated manner stresses the importance attached to the nose as a fertility symbol, likewise expressed by its portrayal between horns on fenestrated footed bowls. That the nose had a specific significance in Chalcolithic times is evident from its emphasis whenever a face was depicted, whether in pottery, metal, ivory or stone, and by its use as a prominent feature on different kinds of contemporary artefacts.11 Despite its significance ? or possibly because of its widespread recognition as an accepted symbol ? the merest hint of a nose was at times sufficient to indicate its presence. Thus on some pillar figures the nose is no more than a small excrescence (Fig. 6:33, 34, 36); it is noteworthy that on these examples the base of the head is marked by a raised ridge. Two other figures are sculpted without any nose at all, and have no distinguishing traits other than the basic elements of a pillar-like form and a shallow offering bowl above (Fig. 6:41,42). The former of these two figures is less smoothly worked and has a relatively small oval bowl above and a shallow depression in the base, while No. 42 (PI. 31:D) is carved with greater care. Although these two pillar figures are not typical of the central Golan, where a large nose and well-defined ear-knobs are the rule, they nevertheless incorporate the two essential characteristics which are shared by the genre as a whole. The indications are that farther away from the Golan heartland, to the north-west, it was precisely this simplified form that was recognized and venerated. This can be deduced from evidence accumulated over the years from several sites in the Huleh region. In the course of excavations at Tel Teo, which lay on the western edge of the now-drained Huleh lake (Fig. 1:11), a small pillar figure attributed to a Chalcolithic stratum came to light (Fig. 7:44); a larger one was subsequently found there in a disturbed findspot (Fig. 7:43 and PI. 31:E).12 Both are characterized by a columnar shape and culminate above in an offering bowl; on neither are any additional features ?o Y.

Yet another featureless pillar figure (Fig. 7:45) was found on the surface at the Yardinon Dam site, near Shamir (Fig. 1:13), where Chalcolithic material was collected in the course of surveys.13 At Tel Turmus to the north, two pillar figures were found on the surface (Figs. 7:46 and 47). On the first, there are scarcely discernible ear-knobs placed low down on either side, while No. 47 (PL 31:F), discovered by E. Eisenberg in 1986, is made of naturally pitted basalt and has a second small hollow in its base.14 Both are devoid of any other traits save the customary bowl above. All these five pillar figures come from sites situated on the periphery of the Huleh basin and (with the exception of the ram figure already mentioned), no statue with a large nose, eyes, well-marked ear-knobs, horns, hair, beard or any other distinctive feature has so far come to light in the region. It thus seems that the more elaborate types of pillar figures were in use in the Golan, while below the Golan Heights, to the west, a more schematic form was common, which likewise incorporated the basic elements of circularity and an offering bowl above. Having recognized the existence of a local preference for a specific type of pillar figure, it can be plausibly suggested that other variants were current in other adjacent regions, such as that extending north-east from Quneitra. This region may well have been the origin of a related type of pillar figure which has begun to appear on the international antiquities market during the past few years. Obviously in these cases there is scant information as to provenance. Likewise made of basalt, the three examples described are columnar in form and terminate above in a shallow bowl; they are carved with eyes and a prominent beak-like nose, which differs from the out-curving nose commonly found on the Golan figures. Two of these figures (a. height: 24 cm. and b. height: 20 cm. ? PL 33:A) are markedly bi-conical in shape and are modelled with short horns above;15 neither has ear-knobs of any kind, while on the taller figure a slight ridge runs around the back of the head at the height of the eyes (compare Fig. 4:23). The third figure is considerably larger (c. height: 42.3 cm.), with ear-knobs at mid-height and, in addition, a small lug handle on either side, placed high up between the eyes and the ear-knobs. The most distinctive feature shared by all three is a stylized beard on either side of the lower part of the statue, 13 I am grateful to M.

This manner of depicting a beard is alien to the Golan pillar figures, and is not found either on the horned and bearded statues or on those without horns (Figs. 2:1, 2A and 2B, and 5:30 and 31). That a stylized beard was indeed intended is made abundantly clear by comparison with other figures of this type which have also appeared on the antiquities market.16 In the light of this diffusion pattern, it is becoming more and more evident that pillar figures ? first excavated in the Golan ? were integral to the Chalcolithic tradition and cultic beliefs current in wide regions bordering the Upper Jordan Rift, especially at sites where basalt is present in the local geological formation or is to be 16 Three such figures have recently been donated to the Israel Museum.

The discovery of three pillar figures near Sal17 (Fig. 1:14), with a basalt pocket some 5 km. to the north-east,only goes to substantiate this.18 The pillar figures have been arranged as far as possible according to type and include those from the Golan (Figs. 2-6) and from the Huleh (Fig. 7). Fig. 2 shows the horned pillar figures: some are bearded and all save one are sculpted with eyes. Five tend to a bi-conical shape, and four are wider at the top and taper towards the base. This is one of the smallest groups, comprising no more than nine statues. This may be fortuitous, since pillar figures were not found in every house and not all the houses investigated were completely excavated. The relatively small number of horned statues is indeed surprising, particularly in view of the occurrence of horns and non-functional 'horn-handles' on different kinds of vessels, especially on the upper section of fenestrated footed bowls. Nos. 1, 2A and 2B (PL 29:A, B) were found in different houses at Rasm Harbush and can almost certainly be attributed to the same workshop. Similarly, No. 3 (PL 29:C, not personally examined) falls into place alongside them, not only on account of its general shape and horns, but because of the distinctive pointed ear-knobs (note the similar ear-knobs on Fig. 3:18, from the same site). Although there are no precise details concerning the exact findspot of No. 3 (apart from a general indication of provenance from the Golan), the similarity of execution makes it likely that all four were fashioned by the same hand, and that differences in size and detail were dictated by the shape of the basalt block used for each. No. 4 has no eyes, and in this respect is unique among the horned figures. No. 5 is carved with three globular protuberances on the lower part of the statue, possibly intended to represent a mouth and a divided beard below.19 On No. 6 the hair is indicated in the same manner used for depicting a beard on Nos. 1,2A and 2B, which recalls the ubiquitous use of rope decoration on pottery.20 Only the upper part of No. 7 is extant, but from its dimensions it would appear to have been part of a large statue and may originally have been carved with a beard below. No. 8 has no more than a hint of horns on either side of the nose. 17 J.W. Hanbury-Tenison: The Late Chalcolithic to Early Bronze I Transition in Palestine and Transjordan (British Archaeological Reports, International Series, 311), Oxford, 1986, p. 163. 18 Additional pillar figures, said to have been found in Jordan, have recently come on to the antiquities market. Judging from photographs, they appear to be closer to the Golan types, yet at the same time they exhibit differences of detail and execution which mark them as a regional variant. 19 An alternative interpretation was put forward by J. Perrot, who suggested that the male organ was intended (personal communication). This, however, is quite untypical of the pillar figures, which lack any feature which could be construed as having a sexual connotation. 20 Compare the use of this form of decoration on the lower part of horn-bearing pediments on ossuaries from Ben-Shemen, possibly also intended to represent a beard ?

Tending towards a bi-conical shape, several are wider at the top than at the base, with something of a 'waist' at mid-height. On most there is an emphasized, out-curving nose and well-defined ear-knobs on either side, while sometimes the eyes are also shown. The recurrence of this type of statue enables a plausible restoration to be suggested for Nos. 12 and 15, on which most of one side, including the nose, is no longer extant. The latter figure (found in a fragmented state on the floor of a house), has a deep hollow in its base, and it is possible that having already been broken in Chalcolithic times, it was reused as a mortar. No. 9 (PL 29:D) was found without its nose, which was lying close by, having doubtless broken off when the figure fell. Nos. 10 and 11 were both revealed by tractors. No. 14, of which only the upper part was recovered, was found in fragments; its dimensions point to its having been part of a large pillar figure. When found, No. 17 was upside-down, standing, as it were, on its head, after having probably fallen from above. Fig. 4 includes pillar figures, on some of which the bowl diameter is larger than that of the base, while others tend to a heavy columnar shape. No. 19 (PL 29:F) is equipped with an unusually wide bowl on top, whose diameter is greater than its height. Like No. 17 (see above), it too was found upside down, in another house at the same site. No. 26 (PL 30:A) was found in a similar position in a house elsewhere, where it had fallen next to No. 24 (PL 32:A). The fact that many pillar figures ? though by no means all ? were found close to house walls (PL 32:B) suggests that originally they were placed aloft, possibly on a shelf half-way up the walls. Alternatively, they may have been placed at the foot of the walls and overturned when the buildings crumbled and fell into ruin.21 A word must be added regarding No. 21 (height: 15 cm.), which is a classical example in miniature of the bi-conical form, with a large curved nose and well-defined ear-knobs. In view of its small size it could have served as a fertility talisman, very similar in shape to that clasped under the arm of the Gilat 'churn goddess'.22 No. 23 (PL 30:C) gives an impression of solidity, since the base and bowl are almost identical in width and only slightly less than the total height. Another unusual feature is the tonsure-like groove which runs round the head just above the eyes, while both the nose and ear-knobs are uncharacteristic, the former being far less protuberant and the latter wider than usual. The statue was found in the centre of a house in which there was a second, horned figure (Fig. 2:4) on a shelf at the base of the northern wall. No. 27, which had broken in two, was found slightly above floor 21 In one house at Rasm Harbush there were five pillar figures (Nos. 1, 11, 18, 22 and 27): three were found in a row close to the base of the inner long wall, while the remaining two were lying near the walls in the north-eastern section of the building (PL 32:B). 22 Alon (above, n. 11); Epstein (above, n. 4), pp. 78-79.</page><page sequence="10">214 CLAIRE EPSTEIN b A 1* .'jf' sL 4 136 - , -. 4 0 -014, s - ,. . .. -- lli cr -IL - -: 6. 46. l .k si..'. * -o. *to 12 .- : --Ter ---v -pp- o 1--7 OFr</page><page sequence="11">BASALT PILLAR FIGURES 215 Fig. 3.

This is in marked contrast to the goatee beard on the horned figures (Fig. 2:1, 2A and 2B), and it is possible that on Nos. 30 and 31a human beard was intended. No. 32 is another example of a pillar figure with a wide bowl on top and a small base below (compare Fig. 4:19, 28); it includes an unusual feature ? the extension at the base of the nose, which may indicate the original intention of the sculptor to carve a long outcurving nose (compare Fig. 4:27), the basalt having fractured while the work was in progress. Fig. 6 shows variants of the more commonly found type of Golan pillar figure. All incorporate the basic characteristics of circularity and a shallow bowl above, but only No. 33 is truly bi-conical. It has the tiniest of small noses, and the base of the head is marked by a low ridge, its enlarged extremities replacing the more usual ear-knobs. Nos. 34 and 36 (PI. 31:A) exhibit similar features, though their shape is far from bi-conical, and on the former there are two additional raised ridges on the lower part of the pillar. No. 35 lacks the raised ridge at the base of the head; instead, in addition to the small squat nose in front, there is another smaller one on the right side of the figure's back. Nos. 38 and 39 (PI. 31:B) were found in the same house: the former has a rather short broken nose and well-marked ear-knobs below, while No. 39 has a much larger nose (also broken) and ear-knobs which are placed high up, close to the eyes. No. 40 (PL 31:C) should not, perhaps, be included in the pillar figure class, since for all its circular shape, shallow bowl and minute nose, it is only 12 cm. high and may have been used as a pestle. On the other hand, it could have served as a fertility talisman, such as those used by women (cf. p. 213).26 Nos. 41 and 42 (PL 31:D) 26 See above, . 22.</page><page sequence="16">220 CLAIRE EPSTEIN :'.d'.r-. . t' tt J. c.. to 4F4'4.,rL ~L C % - ai s% {te** . . ~3 35r.* rA k"It &amp; 27 36 - 37 p hr r~ o' 93 '40cm</page><page sequence="17">BASALT PILLAR FIGURES 221 Fig. 6.

Fig. 7 shows the five featureless figures already discussed (above, pp. 208-209). No. 43 (PL 31:E) is unique in that it has an omphalos in the middle of the bowl. It is difficult to guess at its significance, but it may have been connected with the nature of the offering placed in it; alternatively, it may have been intended to represent a circular symbol at the very centre of the bowl, meant to enhance the efficacy of the offering it contained. Circular symbols occur in the form of non-functional pottery discs on the shoulders of storage vessels in the Golan, as well as on a wide range of artefacts from contemporary sites.27 While only scanty information is available as to 27 Epstein (above, . 4), pp. 65-70.</page><page sequence="18">222 CLAIRE EPSTEIN Fig. 7.

Their importance lies in the fact that they all belong to the same category and that they were found at three different sites in the Huleh valley. The identification of this small group provides corroboration for the interpretation of the genre as a whole.</page><page sequence="19">BASALT PILLAR FIGURES 223 In the present state of our knowledge, the Golan appears to be the focal point of this form of Chalcolithic cultic expression. Such an evaluation, however, may not be a true reflection of the relative importance of the different localities, since many more sites dating from this period have been identified and excavated in the Golan than in adjacent regions. With the gradual increase in the body of evidence from other Huleh valley sites, it will be possible to obtain a far more complete picture, not only of the variant forms of pillar figures there, but also of the overall nature of the material culture of which they formed an integral part. As in the case of the architecture and of the ceramic and lithic assemblages, the indications are that the figures share a number of features typical of the better-known Golan Chalcolithic forms, while at the same time exhibiting certain distinctive traits;28 from this it can be deduced that related types existed side by side, especially in the predominantly basaltic areas of the north. 28 Eisenberg (above, . 12).</page><page sequence="20">PLATE 29 modelled goat's head F: No. 19.
