      <p>Philosophers have thought more about the nature of thinking than about anything else. After Plato and Aristotle, philosophers' main concern was to promote good, that is, correct, thinking. Because correct thinking was achieved best in propositional statements, thinking became a matter of logic, and logic became a discipline dealing with the formulation of true predicative sentences.</p>
      <p>In the twentieth century, many philosophers expressed their dissatisfaction with this view. Some, such as Heidegger, have pointed to the ontological presuppositions of a logic that makes truth a matter of correspondence between predicative sentences and the reality of states of affairs. Other philosophers, such as Deleuze, have emphasized that the art of forming interesting philosophical problems cannot be reduced to the formulation of interrogative predicative sentences that can lead to a solution under the form of an affirmative predicative proposition. True philosophical problems will possibly never reach a final solution, and both their formulation and their treatment require more than the correct use of pregiven clear and distinct concepts. Deleuze also stresses that since logically correct propositions can be perfectly trivial and irrelevant, logic provides no guarantee for good philosophical thinking. Even Husserl is convinced that a logic of consequence or noncontradiction is insufficient to account for true knowledge. For him, more is required—namely, a transcendental logic that is less concerned with the formation of correct statements than with intuitive acts of thinking. Bergson, finally, is well known for promoting “intuition” as an alternative to the intellectualism of a conceptual philosophical thinking. His was thereby inspired not only by Plato's theory of Ideas but also by Spinoza's doctrine concerning a “knowledge of the third kind.” For Bergson, intuitive knowledge as a synthetic insight into the unity of organically articulated and dynamically developing multiplicities was meant to form an alternative to Kant's account of knowledge in terms of an analytical conceptual determination of a raw sensory material. The criticism of logical thinking became thus associated with a skepticism concerning the epistemological value not only of predication but also of all conceptual thinking—and especially of dialectics as a speculative logic of concepts.</p>
      <p>Deleuze's description of philosophical thinking must be understood in this historical context. It is an attempt to reconcile Bergson's intuitive knowledge with a new form of conceptual thinking. Using concepts for the sake of forming new philosophical problems can only mean that old philosophical concepts are pushed beyond their logical limits and that new concepts and new conceptual orders are created. This famously led Deleuze to rehabilitate Kant as a thinker of the excess rather than of the fixation of limits—that is, as a philosopher who understands the relevance of illusions. Instead of defending a theory of sensus communis or consensus among the subjective faculties, Kant now appears to be a philosopher who has tried to think how and why each faculty has a natural inclination to transcend its natural and logical limits (Deleuze 1994, 143–46; 2000, 186–91). In Deleuze's own “transcendental empiricism” (1994, 138ff.; 2000, 180ff.), it is the invisible that constitutes the true philosophical problem of perception—just as intensity constitutes the true issue of sensibility, the phantasms and simulacra of imagination, the dissimilar and immemorial of recollection, and what we do not yet think of thinking.</p>
      <p>It will not come as a surprise, then, that in his criticism of a traditional “image of thought” dominated by a logic of representation, and in his characterization of a thinking in search of the unthought, Deleuze frequently crosses the path of Heidegger's (late) philosophy. It is especially striking how such a thinking of the unthought is related for both philosophers to a form of thinking that consists in deciphering signs and in recollecting a past that has never been present. Independently of each other but with remarkable agreement Heidegger (1992, 183ff.) and Deleuze (1994, 140ff.; 2000, 183ff.) both do not spare their praise for Plato's doctrine of reminiscence as a kind of memory that points to a nonrepresentational and nonsubjective form of knowledge and thought. Read through a Deleuzian lens, the later Heidegger, just like Kant, becomes a thinker of transgression as much as of finitude. Such a transgressing of the limits of our habitual way of thinking is, for both Heidegger and Deleuze, not a matter of a subjective choice. It, rather, belongs to the response to a pressing demand or command that has its origin in the event of the encounter with a mystery that remarkably transcends our subjective means of comprehension. Transcendence thus involves a transgression of the limits of what we can think by ourselves, and this transgression is made necessary by the insisting force of a presence that is both excessive and receding. Rather than a subjective act of transgression, it is an event where the oyster of subjective autonomy is forced to open itself.</p>
      <p>With the exception of Husserl and Heidegger, phenomenologists may have thought too little about the nature of thinking. Anxious, as most of them were, to free themselves from neo-Kantianism and speculative intellectualism, they have mainly explored the role of the body in perception, affectivity, and social life. At the same time and inversely, analytic philosophers have devoted most of their efforts to conceptual analysis. Things have changed on the side of analytic philosophy, where perception and other forms of bodily enactments have become popular areas of research. More needs to be done on the side of phenomenology when it comes to the investigation of the nature and the possible limits of conceptual thinking.</p>
      <p>I shall proceed in three steps. I begin with summarizing Heidegger's and Deleuze's objections against making philosophical thinking a matter of a transcendent or transcendental subject re-cognizing, representing to itself, and conceptualizing identical objects. In a second step I explore, especially with the help of Deleuze, the possibility of a form of conceptual philosophical thinking that operates without the metaphysical presuppositions of the traditional image of thought. The last part of the article is then devoted to the examination of forms of philosophical thinking that pretend to dispense with the use of concepts. All this is meant to emphasize the importance of a conceptual analysis of our experience of the real world, to explore new forms of conceptual thinking, and to investigate their inherent and persistent limits. These limits are actually on both sides of conceptual thinking—in what allows for it and in what possibly escapes it.</p>

         <title>What Is Wrong with Representational and Conceptual Thinking?</title>
         <p>Heidegger is well known for having declared, already more than half a century ago, that we do not yet think. He added that since science does not think either, a new beginning of philosophical thinking can learn nothing from science. In a turn most typical for the circular path of many of his reflections, Heidegger also claims that the first task of a new philosophical thinking is to think about our not yet thinking. While not constituting what is most worth thinking (<italic>das Denkwürdigste</italic>), our not yet thinking is at least what is most problematic or thought-provoking (<italic>das Bedenklichste</italic>) (Heidegger 1968, 100, 121, 126; 1984, 40, 85–86). However, our not yet thinking becomes only truly and urgently thought-provoking when we become aware of its fatal consequences. An acute awareness of the shortcomings of our habitual way of thinking is thus needed to open ourselves to another, new mode thinking—to its genesis, necessity, and direction.</p>
         <p>In his account of these shortcomings the early Heidegger, just like Husserl, most of the time refers to the <italic>crisis</italic> in the foundation of modern science. In his later work the criticism of modern technology and of a globalized technoscientific culture becomes more and more prominent. According to the latter version, technology not only stands in the way of a new thinking; it also cannot think its own essence. No wonder, since this essence is not technological but metaphysical. Consequently, for the later Heidegger the tasks of questioning the essence of technology and the essence of metaphysical thinking become essentially linked. Characterizing technoscientific thinking as “one-track thinking” (<italic>eingleisiges Denken</italic>) based on a “one-sided view” (<italic>einseitiges Meinen</italic>) (Heidegger 1968, 34; 1984, 58) or “representative thinking” (<italic>vorstellendes Denken</italic>) is a philosophical statement that already presupposes the openness to another form of thinking. The realization of an extreme danger holds the promise of a salvation. In the end, for Heidegger, only the call of Being can save us by calling us into a new way of thinking that attends to a mode of presence of things that arises from the event of an unconcealment rather than from subjective representation. What the new thinking is about is thus the truth of Being as the event of a reticent self-presencing of Being in its difference from the beingness (<italic>Seiendheit</italic>) of all beings.</p>
         <p>In Heidegger's reading, traditional modern thinking, originating from Galileo and Descartes, is a form of scientific-philosophical thinking where mental representations turn things into ob-jects for a subjective inspection, which provides a secure knowledge founded on self-evident givenness. Criticizing Descartes for his account of representative thinking where objects are made present or are represented by an egological subject in their being present-at-hand (<italic>Vorhandenheit</italic>), Heidegger obviously also has Husserl in mind. In his later texts Heidegger associates this representative mode of thinking more and more with a search for security, control, and domination that cannot be ascribed to an individual subject or cogito. Representative thinking becomes thus an epochal event in the history of Being, the mark of the civilization of Modern Times where technoscience and especially technological calculation are predominant. Technology projects the same metaphysical image of Being on all beings—human beings included. As a consequence, the claim of things to be understood in themselves and according to their particular modes of being is ruled out in favor of turning them into objects-for-us that simply mirror our own cognitive capacities and will to know. For Heidegger, technology as an offspring of modern metaphysics has completely substituted itself for the initial Greek understanding of Being as <italic>Physis</italic>. Technoscience has transformed the presencing dynamism of nature into a static <italic>Weltbild</italic> that, as a human image of the world, is finally nothing else than a <italic>Menschbild</italic>. Representative thinking must thus be understood as an endeavor to picture or map the world in such a way that things become fully present, accessible and transparent for our intelligence, and in such a way that they offer no resistance to our manipulation and industrial production of artificial goods.</p>
         <p>For Heidegger, a certain image of the human subject is an important ingredient of this metaphysical image of the world in which representations (<italic>Vorstellungen</italic>) are the means of a subjective will to know, which is in truth a will to power. The conception of the subject that best serves this global technoscientific-metaphysical enterprise is Descartes's cogito, where perceiving, feeling, and so on are claimed to be a kind of thinking and where thinking is ascribed to a representing mind that is also aware of itself. As Heidegger puts it: <italic>Vorstellen</italic> (representing) becomes a <italic>Sich-Vorstellen</italic> (representing to oneself). He (1968, 85; 1984, 33) also refers to Nietzsche's analysis of <italic>Vorstellen</italic> as a <italic>Nachstellen</italic> (pursuing)—that is, a kind of persecutory examination where everything is torn into the open and where things are stripped of their latency and of their secret.<sup>1</sup> For Heidegger (1968, 73; 1984, 69) this <italic>nachstellende Vorstellen</italic> (pursuing representation) is a <italic>Verstellen</italic> (dissimulation and blocking), a pseudo-understanding of things that creates a false image of the world by reducing the presence of things to how the human mind posits or represents them to itself as flat phenomena.</p>
         <p>The metaphysics associated with representation is thus not only a metaphysics of the will to know but also a metaphysics where the <italic>presence</italic> of things is reduced to what one can presently perceive of them in full self-evidence. Representative thinking belongs to the realm and reign of a metaphysics of presence, where Being means being-present, where being-present means remaining-present, and where the temporal dimensions of the future and the past are always understood as modifications of a stable and static present. Heidegger (1968, 93; 1984, 37) again credits Nietzsche for having shown how this metaphysics of presence that underlies modern representational thinking is actually motivated by the fear of “passing” (<italic>Vergehen</italic>)—specifically a fear of the passing away of presence.</p>
         <p>When accounting for what is wrong with the modern way of thinking and for what is needed for a new thinking, Deleuze comes surprisingly close to Heidegger. Heidegger's opposition between modern, foundational thinking and a thinking looking into the “abyss” (<italic>Abgrund</italic>) of Being finds a most favorable echo in Deleuze's (1994, 272ff.; 2000, 349ff.) assigning philosophy the new task to think what is “profound” (<italic>profond</italic>) or “without ground” (<italic>sans fond</italic>).<sup>2</sup> The same can also be said for Deleuze's (1994, 140; 2000, 183) emphasis on an “essential forgetting” (<italic>oubli essentiel</italic>) that is obliterated by modern thinking. More generally, Deleuze's analysis of how representational thinking builds on a system of metaphysical presuppositions advantageously complements Heidegger's stress on the ontological prejudices of modern subjectivism. In light of these large agreements, their disagreement about whether science thinks or does not think seems to be a matter of mere terminology. Indeed, Deleuze, no less than Heidegger, holds that philosophy must emancipate itself from the way in which modern science thinks. They also both affirm that it is by means of “signs” that we are led from science to a new philosophical thinking. But where Heidegger (1968, 11; 1984, 7) sees in “man” such a sign,<sup>3</sup> Deleuze (1994, 140; 2000, 182) recommends that we take our lead from the encounter with signs that hold no promise of signification—that is, unintelligible sensuous signs. We will also see later that Deleuze only half agrees with Heidegger's claim that what most deserves our thinking is how thinking and Being, despite being essentially different, nevertheless essentially belong together.</p>
         <p>For Deleuze, it is Kant's concept of an identical I accompanying all my representations that forms the anchor point of the metaphysical system of modern representative thinking. This identical I, who thinks, thinks by means of identical concepts and of eternal logical laws. This formal logical thinking becomes true knowledge or experience only when it is properly applied to the material of sensuous perception. What Deleuze (1994, 262ff.; 2000, 337ff.) calls “the four iron collars” (<italic>quadruple carcan</italic>) of representation are the suppositions one makes in order to secure a successful and lasting encounter between the categories of thinking and the manifold of sensory material. They support a thinking that pursues the goal of transforming a chaotic manifold of brute data into a stable intelligible order. Compared with Heidegger, representative thinking has more to do for Deleuze with stabilization than domination, more with territorialization than globalization, more with homogenization than objectivation, more with domestication than universalization. But Deleuze agrees with Heidegger that representative thinking is devoted to order and security, that it seeks to reduce difference to identity, and that it aims at conceptual determination and adequate judgments.</p>
         <p>These are, then, the four presuppositions of the philosophical system of representation (Deleuze 1994, 266ff.; 2000, 341ff.): First, in order to be more easily subsumed under a concept, the intensive qualities of the sensible must be homogeneous. Second, in order for judgments to become the main form of conceptual thinking, the meaning of Being must be analogous. Third, in order to allow logic to rule over thinking, the negativity of what is problematic must be a matter of negation, and difference, a matter of opposition. Fourth, in order to avoid the fragmentation of the thinking I, it must be expelled from the temporal stream of consciousness.</p>
         <p>This system of modern representative thinking deserves to be called an “image of thought” because it changes the unforeseeable movement of the process of thinking into something to be thought as a stable and easily graspable totality. This mirror image or narcissistic image of thought is what thinking becomes in most of modern philosophy. Deleuze's (1994, 129ff.; 2000, 169ff.) eight “postulates” of the image of thought are “presuppositions” modern philosophers make even before they begin to think. The first postulates concern the goodwill of all who think and their spontaneous interest in truth. One also presupposes that the different human faculties cooperate harmoniously and form a commonsensical basis for all philosophical speculation. Accordingly, one also claims that the different subjective faculties are led by the same values in their investigation of identical objects. As a consequence, difference and repetition are reduced to identity, and the negativity of error is said to be profitable for the attainment of truth. Finally, one presupposes that a logic of proposition will be able to guarantee truth and rule over the formulation of all meaningful problems. On the basis of these eight presuppositions there remains no doubt that all problems can be solved and that all learning will result in a stable form of knowledge.</p>
         <p>One can easily guess from Deleuze's criticism of these presuppositions and of the consequences of an image of thought governed by representation what his new way of philosophical thinking must be. It is a thinking inspired by interesting problems rather than by the search for true judgments. For such a thinking it is stupidity rather than error that forms an interesting philosophical problem (Deleuze 1994, 150ff.; 2000, 196ff.). What the unavoidable encounter with stupidity teaches us is that a fruitful and creative philosophical thinking is about what still has no recognizable form, it operates without a priori criteria for relevance, and it lacks the secure ground of all orthodoxy. Unlike representative thinking, it takes qualitative differences and sensible intensities seriously. Freeing itself from the yoke of logic and dialectics, this philosophical thinking leads to a proliferation of newly created concepts and rehabilitates the conceptual meaning of singular events.</p>

         <title>In Defense of Conceptual Thinking</title>
         <p>One can summarize Heidegger's and Deleuze's criticisms of modern thinking by referring to its objectivism, its subjectivism, and its domination by logic. When logic rules over how things are made present from the point of view of an interchangeable egological subject, then truth becomes a matter of correct judgments depending on the correct use of the subjective faculties and on the proper application of pregiven concepts to raw sensuous material. As a consequence, overcoming this way of thinking seems to necessarily entail a departure not only from Cartesianism and Kantianism but also from all <italic>conceptually</italic> mediated knowledge. Before turning to Heidegger's conception of a thinking that is rooted in the truth of Being and Bergson's or Spinoza's idea of an intuitive knowledge, I would like to give conceptual philosophical thinking another chance.</p>
         <p>When one objects to a standardized mode of thinking in which knowledge is a matter of recognition, in which recognition becomes the identification of something familiar, and in which all experience is made dependent on its matching our concepts, then an alternative way of thinking must start with sensuous experience and how it gives raise to concepts. In such a view the meaning of concepts can never be entirely conceptual, because concepts are formed on the basis of an experience, the meaning (or the lack of meaning) of which is not yet conceptual. Such a dependence of concepts on the meaning of preconceptual experience also entails that conceptual thinking cannot any longer be considered a matter of an intellect simply following logical rules and blindly applying or projecting ready-made conceptual forms on a meaningless matter. Under these premises, phenomenology presents itself as a promising starting point.</p>
         <p>For Husserl, a conceptual thinking that is not based on or at least accompanied by an intuitive insight into the matters affirmed is either thoughtless thinking or empty metaphysical speculation. It falls under what the <italic>Logical Investigations</italic> calls “inauthentic thinking,” which comprehends mathematical calculus, thoughtless logical operations, and empty conceptual constructions in philosophy. “Authentic thinking,” on the contrary, comprehends a form of conceptual thinking, the truth-value of which is corroborated by a categorical intuition into the state of affairs asserted by a judgment. This sounds more Kantian than it actually is. Husserl diverges decisively from Kant's view on conceptual knowledge in at least three respects. First, for Husserl conceptual knowledge is founded on a preconceptual (usually perceptual) experience that is already a kind of knowledge. Second, for Husserl the way in which concepts articulate sensible experience is not a matter for a transcendental deduction. Third, for Husserl the validity of conceptual knowledge does not depend on the legitimate use of the faculty of understanding but, rather, on thinking as an intuitive process. For Husserl, authentic thinking is a matter of intuitively fulfilled judgment.</p>
         <p>This being said, Husserl's view on conceptual thinking also has its limits. For many readers, its most striking limit is the dependence on a notion of truth where truth is still a matter of how judgments correspond to real states of affairs—not <italic>in se</italic>, however, but as they present themselves in a categorical intuition. Not only is this said to be a problematic notion of truth, one also questions whether truth can be the final criterion for relevant and creative conceptual thinking. One can, in other words, put forward an alternative notion of truth that rules out pure conceptual thinking, or one can contest that creative conceptual thinking is a matter of truth. Heidegger stands for the first option; Deleuze, for the second.</p>
         <p>Unlike Kant, Husserl also has a strong concern for the <italic>genesis of concepts</italic>. For Husserl, pregiven concepts must have been formed, and the insight into the process of their formation is crucial for the rigorous determination of their meaning and of their use. According to Husserl, concepts must have their origin in inner or outer perception—as one can see already from his first publication on the origin of the concept of “number.”</p>
         <p>Overcoming the psychologism that still weighed on his early account of concept formation also allowed Husserl to refine his theory of outer perception. The most decisive achievement of this phenomenological theory of perception is its liberation from all the presuppositions of representationalism. For Husserl, there is no need for any internal intermediaries or mental screens in the relation between perceiver and perceived. Perception has an immediate grasp on reality—to such an extent that, as Jocelyn Benoist has often claimed,<sup>4</sup> all talk about a perception's “access” to reality or about a “givenness” of reality to the perceiver becomes highly problematic. Husserl's phenomenological theory of perception must also be credited with the insight that perception involves meaning. Not only can a perceiver recognize something for which he has no name or concept, but he can also explore its qualities without making use of linguistic meanings. Merleau-Ponty has aptly called such an explorative perception of the qualitative properties of things a “seeing-as.” Building on Husserl's claim of a “primacy of perception,” Merleau-Ponty has also shown—partially against Husserl himself—that the classical subject–object division fails to grasp the true meaning of the intercourse between perceiver and perceived—even when changes of perspective and symbolic equivalences between different perceptual perspectives are taken into account.</p>
         <p>One must admit, however, that Merleau-Ponty stresses the primacy of perception so much that one finally wonders what concepts and conceptual thinking are still good for. On the other hand, Husserl's claim that concepts are good for scientific reasoning seems insufficiently in tune with the primacy of perception. One is therefore inclined to say that the need for concepts emerges from and in perception—more particularly when the meaning of what one actually perceives becomes problematic, when the continuity of a perception is interrupted by the question: “What is it that I perceive?” This question ordinarily leads not only to a more attentive perception or to a thematization of what one perceives; it also leads to a search for names and categories. The most common origin or genesis of concepts thus lies in their answering needs arising in perception. Once a conceptual answer is given, the further course of experience can then be either perceptual or conceptual. The answer can also be delayed when what one perceives is too strange or when an appropriate concept is not available and must still be created.</p>
         <p>There is no need for us here to go further into the details of how Husserl conceives of the formation of concepts in terms of empirical or categorical perceptions being submitted to an eidetic variation. We can also dispense with making a distinction between empirical and a priori concepts as well as with questioning whether concepts must indeed, as Husserl claims, relate to ideal objects. What we cannot leave unmentioned, however (especially before we turn to Deleuze's views on the creation of concepts), is that Husserl's theory of perception and of how it gives rise to concepts still occasionally falls prey to representationalism or intellectualism.</p>
         <p>While accounting for bodily perception in terms of intentionality seems (especially in Merleau-Ponty's formulations) rather unproblematic, the same cannot be said of Husserl's theory concerning how sensuous perception is subject to a process of intuitive fulfillment. If sensuous perception has an immediate intuitive grasp of the perceived, then it can, strictly speaking, contain no empty intentions or “pretenses” that would need an intuitive fulfillment. Partial perceptions or perceptual anticipations of what in the perceived has not yet become fully visible are something essentially different from empty mental representations or from precipitated statements that for their validation are in need of an intuitive fulfillment. Just as there are no empty intentions in sensuous perception, the manner in which incomplete or sketchy perceptions demand further perceptions is not a matter of confirmation, corroboration, or verification.</p>
         <p>A similar kind of intellectualism also prevails in Husserl's conception of the relation between perception and conceptual knowledge. For Husserl, perception not only provides a knowledge of what is perceived; this knowledge is also already articulated under the form of a preconceptual sense or meaning. Merleau-Ponty has taught us to understand this perceptual sense or meaning as a sensuous and bodily seeing-as. However, he is still inclined to share with Husserl the conviction that this perceptual sense must be understood as the <italic>foundation</italic> of a conceptual meaning—that is, of a conceptually articulated knowledge of the object of perception. Especially for Husserl, the claim of a primacy of perception is thus linked with the <italic>presupposition</italic> that perception must naturally lead to a conceptual knowledge, which consists essentially in nothing more than a categorical articulation or explication of what has previously been sensuously perceived. In such a Husserlian view, where conceptual thought is said to naturally harmonize with a perceptual knowledge that it only makes more explicit, perception loses its truly thought-provoking character, and concepts lose their truly creative contribution to thought.</p>
         <p>It takes Deleuze and Guattari only a few chapters in their short book <italic>What Is Philosophy?</italic> (1991, 1994) to account for the specificity of philosophical concepts, for the basis on which they are created, for the subject who creates them, and for the manner in which philosophical conceptual thinking differs from the forms of thinking that one can find in science or art. Unlike Heidegger, Deleuze and Guattari claim that what divides philosophy from science is not thinking but concepts. Unlike Husserl, they also claim that the value of philosophical conceptual thinking cannot be measured against a notion of truth borrowed from science. For Deleuze and Guattari, creative philosophical thinking is primarily about problems and not, as Husserl would have it, about ideal objects and states of affairs. It is also primarily about the relevance of concepts and not, as Heidegger would have it, about the truth of Being. Focusing on how Deleuze and Guattari account for <italic>philosophical</italic> conceptual thinking leads us into the heart of their interest in a thinking that experiments with new concepts and liberates itself from a traditional “image of thought.”</p>
         <p>For Deleuze and Guattari, philosophical concepts are created when they are needed, and they are needed when the philosopher, in a situation of disorder or “chaos,” formulates a philosophical question. This lack of order is not necessarily related to incongruence in the perceived world, and it is not an uncommon experience that can easily be overcome. For the philosopher, the disorder of the world is, on the contrary, a lasting fact that no conceptual thinking can fully surmount. On the other hand, having an experience of chaos is, of course, not sufficient to become a philosopher; it is not equivalent with the formulation of a philosophical problem by means of the creation of new concepts.</p>
         <p>This experience of a world that is out of joint is usually veiled by a network of <italic>doxai</italic> that is spanned over the abyssal encounter with what is without meaning. Not unlike Heidegger, Deleuze thinks that there are different kinds of doxai and that one should not take for granted that philosophical thinking can start from scratch. Among the doxai that stand in the way of a philosophical thinking, Heidegger and Deleuze both point to the opinions, information, and statements provided by public figures, journalists, and academics in conference papers. Another kind of <italic>doxa</italic> is what Deleuze and Guattari (1991, 38ff.; 1994, 35ff.) call the “plane of immanence,” which underlies all creation and creative use of philosophical concepts.<sup>5</sup> Philosophical questions must not only have a direction and a goal; they also need a plane to get them off the ground. Descartes's investigation of the nature of scientific knowledge presupposes that we agree on what we mean by the words <italic>thinking</italic>, <italic>being</italic>, and <italic>I</italic> and that we share a goodwill for truth. Heidegger's investigation of the meaning or truth of Being presupposes a pre-ontological understanding or familiarity with Being. Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological investigation of how perception relates to the world presupposes that we share a “perceptual faith.”</p>
         <p>For Deleuze and Guattari the relation among problems, concepts, and the plane of immanence of a philosophical thought is a circular one. This is to say that the plane or horizon that sustains or frames the investigation of a philosophical problem does not chronologically precede the positing of the problem, as would be the case with an external condition or cause. It is, rather, the problem itself that unfolds its own field of investigation and that prompts the need for the creation of new concepts. This is why Deleuze and Guattari call this field or horizon a plane <italic>of immanence</italic>. In most cases this immanence results from an internalization and transformation of a pregiven field of experience and of conceptual language through the position of the new philosophical problem. The common experience of self-awareness and the familiar meaning of the words <italic>thinking</italic>, <italic>being</italic>, and <italic>I</italic> are reshaped in the frame of Descartes's appeal to the cogito as an answer to his new philosophical problem. Newly created philosophical concepts can thus be words that are taken from ordinary language and are given a new meaning. They can also be old philosophical concepts, the meaning of which is transformed through the position of a new problem. Just think of how much Husserl's concept of the “transcendental” differs from Kant's!</p>
         <p>Deleuze and Guattari (1991, 38–39; 1994, 36) devote special attention to the way in which philosophical thinking, which expresses itself in the position of problems, involves a dynamic exchange between the “elasticity of the concept” and the “fluidity” of the plane of immanence. The plane of immanence owes part of its fluidity to the lack of conceptual determination. Concepts owe their elasticity to their heteronymous and nonetheless necessary components as well as to their equally necessary relation with other concepts emerging from a same plane of immanence. As these internal and external relations, which constitute the “endoconsistance” and “exoconsistance” of a philosophical concept (Deleuze and Guattari 1991, 27; 1994, 22), grow and extend, they contribute to the formation of a new, properly <italic>conceptual</italic> plane or, to use another terminology, to the formation of a specific universe of discourse. Being without external reference (i.e., being “self-referential” [Deleuze and Guattari 1991, 27; 1994, 22]), this <italic>conceptual</italic> plane or universe of <italic>philosophical</italic> discourse, while differing essentially from the pre-philosophical plane of immanence, is still immanent. Saying that philosophical concepts are immanent to the problems that they were made for and allow to posit also means that their meaning, far from being universal, depends on a particular process of thinking. This is why, for Deleuze and Guattari, philosophical concepts relate to events and not to essences, to processes of individuation and not of generalizing abstraction. Descartes's cogito is thus a concept with interdependent components, created on the basis of pre-philosophical presuppositions and related to the event of the positing of a new philosophical problem.</p>
         <p>A third kind of immanence comes into play when one asks <italic>who</italic> does the philosophical thinking. For Deleuze and Guattari, just as for Heidegger, the philosopher who thinks cannot be an autonomous subject who freely chooses the topic she wants to think about. Her thinking depends too much on a question that imposes itself on her, and it depends too much on a plane of immanence, on the basis of which she first articulates a problem and creates new concepts to allow for that. A philosopher does not think—that is, posit problems and create concepts—in her own name. This is why Deleuze and Guattari call this philosophical thinker a “conceptual persona” (<italic>personnage conceptuel</italic>). Unlike Husserl's philosophizing transcendental ego, who comports itself as a “noncommitted onlooker” (<italic>unbeteiligter Zuschauer</italic>) of the constitution of the world, Deleuze and Guattari's conceptual persona is a thinker who remains embedded in a plane of immanence, who is entirely absorbed by a specific philosophical problem, and who becomes an actor acting out her newly created concepts on the immanent stage of a particular conceptual field. The conceptual persona is thus in no way transcendent to the process of her thinking. At the same time, the plane of immanence on which her thinking depends also cannot be said to belong to the psychological inner life of the conceptual persona.</p>
         <p>To Heidegger's (1978b) question, “Who is Nietzsche's Zarathustra?” Deleuze and Guattari's answer must then be: a conceptual persona. Nietzsche's own dissatisfaction with what the ontotheological metaphysics and its nihilistic will to power have done to our understanding of the world is just the starting point for a thinking. The thought of the eternal return of the same belongs to the thinking of the prophet Zarathustra, who comes from elsewhere, far away in the mountains, to teach us this new thought. I quote Deleuze and Guattari: “The conceptual persona is not the philosopher's representative but, rather, the reverse: the philosopher is only the envelope of his principal conceptual persona and of all the other personae who are the intercessors [<italic>intercesseurs</italic>], the real subjects [<italic>les véritables sujets</italic>] of his philosophy” (1994, 64).<sup>6</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The poetic thinking of Zarathustra, though coming from elsewhere, still addresses our experience of the real world. It is thus not about another world; it is not a form of hypothetical or fictional thinking. And yet, Zarathustra's thinking is not about observable facts in this real world; it is about a philosophical problem. This is, of course, not to say that philosophical problems are of no relevance for our concrete life in the real world. It only means that, for Deleuze, the task of philosophical thinking does not consist in faithfully describing and conceptually articulating our experience of a pregiven lifeworld. Creative conceptual philosophical thinking must also be distinguished from how <italic>natural science</italic> relates to the real world. Only science is about matters of fact in the real world; and only scientific propositions have a truth-value that can be measured in terms of their correspondence to actual facts. Philosophy is a matter of concepts, the meaning of which depends on other concepts and not on functional relations between empirical facts.</p>
         <p>These Deleuzian views on the task of philosophical thinking and on its difference from science are surprisingly close to what one can find in the later Heidegger. Both philosophers share a concern for a dynamic mode of thinking that cannot be ascribed to an autonomous subject asking questions and finding solutions. It is the insistence and urgency of questions that bring about thinking and thinkers—not the other way around. Looked at through a Deleuzian lens, Heidegger's (1968, 196ff.; 1984, 119ff.) return to the Parmenidian belonging together of <italic>einai</italic> and <italic>noein</italic> can be understood as an insistence on immanence rather than on transcendence—specifically, on the immanence of thinking in the event of the call of Being. Deleuze's own reading of the fragment of Parmenides, where thinking and Being become two sides of the same plane of immanence, and where the difference in what essentially belongs together is understood as a fold (Deleuze and Guattari 1991, 41, 46; 1994, 38, 44), is certainly not incompatible with Heidegger's interpretation of the poem of Parmenides. This is not to say, however, that there are no differences. One only needs to think of Deleuze's (1994, 321; 2000, 188n) disagreement with Heidegger's claim that thinking has a genuine affinity or “homology” with Being or of his resistance to make all philosophical problems depend on the truth of Being.</p>
         <p>Much more could be said concerning the relation between Deleuze and Heidegger. In our context, where I have highlighted their common criticism of how subjective representationalism accounts for thinking, and where I have shown that, for Deleuze, the new mode of philosophical thinking remains conceptual, it must suffice to ask how the later Heidegger sees the relation between authentic philosophical thinking and the use or creation of concepts.</p>

         <title>Beyond Conceptual Thinking</title>
         <p>In 1952, <italic>Heidegger</italic> famously wrote: “Thinking is not grasping [<italic>Greifen</italic>], neither the grasp of what lies before us [<italic>weder ein Zugriff auf das Vorliegende</italic>], nor an attack [<italic>Angriff</italic>] upon it…. Thinking is not grasping or prehending [<italic>kein Be-greifen</italic>]. In the high youth of its unfolding essence, thinking knows nothing of the grasping concept [<italic>Begriff</italic>]…. [A]ll of the great thinking of the Greek thinkers, including Aristotle, thinks non-conceptually [<italic>begrifflos</italic>]” (1968, 211–12).<sup>7</sup> For Heidegger, there are at least two reasons for this nonconceptual thinking of the Greeks: First, their language was not conceptual; and second, what they tried to think does not lend itself to a conceptual grasp or grip. What the early Greek thinkers tried to think was the mysterious event of the truth of Being, of a presencing that takes the form of an unconcealment. However, what appealed to them was not a riddle to be solved, and what it appealed or addressed itself to was not their intellectual curiosity or cleverness. Rather, the appeal, coming from where they should go, opened a laborious path for their learning to think. This path was not laid out for them; it was merely indicated by a sign or, better, by a trace of what needed to be thought. The trace of what was given the Greeks to think could be found in what was most familiar to them—namely, their own language. Their own language had its origin in what they must learn to think, and what they must learn to think was already present and active in their own language. This was a nonconceptual language to which thinkers and poets, while using it differently, paid the same respectful attention. Just as Being and thinking belong together without being identical, the saying of the poet and the thinking of the thinker belong to the same while remaining different.</p>
         <p>Although he thinks that Germans have, through their language, a privileged affinity with the Greeks, even Heidegger must concede that they remain German. In Deleuze's formulation: They are at best German thinkers and poets who reterritorialize themselves in early Greek culture.<sup>8</sup> For Heidegger, German Greek thinkers do not move to another territory: they travel backward in time—they remember. Their thinking and saying have their origin in the repetition of a same gift: in what the early Greek thinkers have received from a <italic>logos</italic> anchored in the truth of Being and in what <italic>they</italic> can receive through a recollection of this early Greek thinking. A double gift deserves a redoubled gratefulness, which expresses itself in what Heidegger (1968, 140; 1984, 92) calls a “recalling thinking” (<italic>an-denkendes Denken</italic>). This <italic>an-denken</italic> (recall) involves both a thoughtful recollection and a thankfulness for what has been sufficiently preserved to allow for this recollection. It is a form of poetic thinking that Hölderlin, like no other German, has restored within and against the tradition of modern thinking.</p>
         <p>The <italic>French</italic> version of such a plea for replacing modern conceptual thinking with a poetic form of thinking can be found in <italic>Bergson</italic>. Just like Heidegger, Bergson contrasts his form of “intuitive” thinking with the method of modern science. However, what modern science cannot think, and therefore completely misunderstands, is for Bergson not the truth of Being but the nature of “duration.” This duration is a dynamic principle operating wherever qualitatively heterogeneous multiplicities grow together into organic unities. Bergson's duration has thus much in common with Heidegger's understanding of a gathering, nonlogical logos. It differs fundamentally with the way in which modern science assembles quantifiable, homogeneous elements into encompassing totalities. In its investigation of human mind and of nature, physical science uses a logic of parts and wholes that it borrows from mathematics. It thus confuses dynamic unities comprising interdependent moments with numbered totalities made out of independent elements. As a consequence, fluent global processes of growth and integration—such as the tension of a temporal duration or the dynamic mobility of a movement—are split up in a manifold of nonrelated punctual instants, spread out on a line that is drawn from a point of beginning to a point of ending.</p>
         <p>In Bergson's understanding of duration, the meaning of all parts depends on the meaning of an intuitively apprehended totality instead of this totality resulting from the summation of independent elements. As such a dynamic principle of organization, where totalities implicate heterogeneous constituents in which they explicate themselves, the structure of duration applies not only to human consciousness, time, and movement but also, as Bergson gradually came to realize, to space, matter, life, morality, religion, and politics. In all these modalities, duration lends itself to a form of intuitive thinking, which is itself a dynamic process exploring the complex organization of mobile totalities, composed of fluent interdependent moments. Intuitive thinking, as Bergson understands it, is thus never a thinking in one glance.</p>
         <p>This method of intuitive thinking serves, in Bergson's <italic>Time and Free Will</italic> and in his <italic>Matter and Memory</italic>, as an investigation of human consciousness, feelings, perception, memory, temporality, and, more generally, the relation between human freedom and material determinism or between mind and brain. However, it is only in his later work that Bergson explicitly focuses on methodological issues and contrasts his own mode of intuitive thinking with the intellectualism of a (Kantian) conceptual thinking. <italic>Creative Evolution</italic>, besides its well-known polemic against (Neo-)Darwinism, is also meant to demonstrate that the world picture of natural science is based on a static metaphysics of presence, which, in its turn, is the result of the intellectualistic way of thinking prevailing in modern times. As Bergson's last major work, <italic>The Two Sources of Morality and Religion</italic>, then observes, the same intellectualism, the same naturalization and objectivation of the dynamism of spiritual processes, is also responsible for a reductionist view on morals, social life, and religion. All this leads Bergson to adopt a position where open, global, dynamic, synthetic intuitive thinking and closed, atomistic, static, analytic conceptual thinking not only are strongly opposed to each other but become irreconcilable. Bergson admittedly owes much of his inspiration for this view on intuitive thinking to book V of Spinoza's <italic>Ethics</italic>.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Spinoza</italic> is, in matters of thinking, perhaps the subtlest among all the philosophers we have encountered thus far. The least one can say is that Spinoza's understanding of <italic>conceptual</italic> knowledge escapes many of the criticisms Heidegger has addressed to modern science and to its metaphysical prejudices. No wonder Heidegger has so much to say about Descartes and so little about Spinoza. Spinoza is best known for his criticism of Descartes's notion of substance, which forms indeed the basis of his entire philosophical system. This leads Spinoza to develop a conception of scientific conceptual knowledge that is free from all subjectivist presuppositions and that purifies the concept of nature from all anthropomorphic representations. Having its center of gravity or, better, its origin in a divine, impersonal substance, human thinking is essentially decentered and asubjective. Even conceptual thinking is the work of <italic>cogitationes</italic> that, instead of depending on an <italic>ego</italic>, depend on a body. Further, the <italic>cogitatum</italic> nature is now understood as <italic>natura naturata</italic> and not as an object laid out by representation to allow for a better inspection and domination by an autonomous intellect. Spinoza's antisubjectivism as well as his violent opposition to all forms of anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism also make him the first ecological thinker of modern times.</p>
         <p>However, how can modern science, which Heidegger accuses of destroying nature and of being totally oblivious of <italic>physis</italic>, be respectful of a mysterious nature, as Spinoza claims? And how can a philosophy that is exposed <italic>more geometrico</italic> escape scientism? This deserves closer examination. It is undeniable that one of Spinoza's main objectives was to make philosophical statements about God, the human mind and body, and animal and material bodies as scientific as mathematical functions or physical propositions doubtlessly are. It is also not doubtful that Spinoza's rationalistic metaphysics rests on assumptions that, while differing from contemporary physicalism, must still be called naturalistic. On the other hand, however, Spinoza's metaphysical naturalism radically transforms the way in which one ordinarily understands the meaning of modern natural science and the role of the scientist. Being herself part of the <italic>natura naturata</italic>, the scientist cannot pretend to be an autonomous subject who, from her central point of view, forces nature to answer her questions and to fulfill her needs. It is “folly,” Spinoza writes, to think that nature is made for man, who would then be “its chief part.”<sup>9</sup> Finally, and most importantly, scientifically rigorous, conceptual knowledge is not all that philosophical thinking can achieve. Such a knowledge of the second kind, though overcoming the anthropocentric prejudices belonging to sensuous perception and imagination (i.e., liberating us from the illusions of the knowledge of the first kind), still falls short of leading to human salvation, which is the declared goal of Spinoza's <italic>Ethics</italic>.</p>
         <p>A good human life cannot be taught, demonstrated, and learned as is the case with science. It depends on a genuine insight into how each human being and all human <italic>conatus</italic> belong to the encompassing totality of Nature or God (<italic>Deus sive natura</italic>). What thus leads to true human wisdom is not general conceptual knowledge but an intuitive knowledge of oneself and of other human persons as individuals belonging to God. It is an intuitive knowledge of oneself from the perspective of God, an intuitive knowledge of one's own existence and of the existence of fellow human individuals as being implicated in the existence of God and as explicating the nature of God. This is why Spinoza famously calls this third, intuitive kind of knowledge <italic>amor intellectualis Dei</italic>.</p>
         <p>Looked at from what we have seen in Bergson and Spinoza, Deleuze's rehabilitation of conceptual philosophical thinking appears now as an attempt to reconcile what he wants to retain from each of them. This is already apparent in the way in which he (1998, 1ff.) presents <italic>Bergson's</italic> conception of “intuition.” It also shows in his book <italic>Spinoza and the Problem of Expression</italic>, where Spinoza is presented (against the mainstream of French scholarship) as a radically anti-Cartesian thinker. Deleuze's new model of conceptual thinking appears now as an attempt to provide creative conceptual thinking with the same fluidity and dynamism that he praised in Bergson's conception of duration and intuition.</p>
         <p>This leads Deleuze to stretch the relevance of concepts beyond their contribution to a logic of truth and to extend their meaning beyond what we can clearly and distinctly conceive. Spinoza's criticism of Descartes is thus used to support Deleuze's own ambition to account for philosophical concepts that are about intensities, qualitative differences, singular events, open problems, and so on. Finally, Deleuze also follows Spinoza in assigning clear limits to all philosophical conceptual thinking. Not all that deserves our thinking can be articulated and thought through concepts. What we experience in imagination and intuition, though falling outside of the realm of conceptual thinking, does not, for that matter, fall outside of all thinking. Art, religion, and a good human life require another mode of thinking—just as Spinoza had suggested.</p>
         <p>What, then, is to be said of Deleuze's relation to Heidegger? Manifestly, what divides Deleuze from Heidegger cannot be their common criticism of the subjectivism of a representative thinking, where the recognition of the identity of an object becomes the goal of all knowledge. It also cannot be their common appreciation of Bergson's conception of intuition and of his opposition to all thinking that reduces time to space, qualities to quantities, totalities to sums, movement to succession, dynamic forces to stable systems. No less can it be their common opposition to a mode of thinking that is governed by logic, especially Hegel's dialectical logic of speculative concepts. Finally, it cannot be their common concern about the wearing out of formerly original and creative philosophical concepts or about the standardization of a philosophical method where pregiven concepts are stereotypically used and applied.</p>
         <p>What separates Deleuze and Heidegger, then, must be Descartes and Spinoza—more precisely, Heidegger's ignorance of a Spinozist form of anti-Cartesianism. It is with <italic>Descartes</italic> in mind that Heidegger criticizes “conceptual thinking” (<italic>be-greifendes Denken</italic>) and turns to the “recalling thinking” (<italic>an-denkendes Denken</italic>) of the early Greek thinkers and poets. It is with <italic>Spinoza</italic> in mind that Deleuze rehabilitates a form of philosophical conceptual thinking that concentrates on the mystery of an unthought and that leaves room for alternative ways of thinking. It is true, however, that Deleuze is as much a Nietzschean as a Spinozist thinker. As a reader of Nietzsche he meets again with Heidegger, and new differences arise. But on this new ground, the debate between Deleuze and Heidegger stretches far beyond the questions concerning the legitimate role of representations and concepts in philosophical thinking.</p>
