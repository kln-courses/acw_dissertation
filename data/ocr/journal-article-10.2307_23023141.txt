<plain_text><page sequence="1">Middle School Journal A five-step strategy for teaching analogous reasoning to middle school students Gail P. Silkebakken Donna J. Camp James: "This book says that by traveling through a series of locks in a canal, ships can go from the Atlantic Ocean, at sea level, to Lake Superior which is 600 feet above sea level. Ships going up hill? How does that work? Mrs. Compton: "Well, James, think of a lock as a room that has a door on both sides. The ship enters the room at one level and the doors are closed. Then, by turning a valve, water flows into the lock and lifts the ship to the next level. The other door is opened and the ship travels to another lock, then another repeating the steps until the ship is on the level of Lake Superior." James: "Oh, I see! That's just like a person having to use more than one elevator to go to the top or bottom of a building." Middle grades students frequently have difficulty understanding new concepts as they are presented in textbooks. Mrs. Compton assisted James to understand this social studies concept by providing a bridge between James' existing knowledge and the unknown concept. Through discussion, Mrs. Compton and James created an analogy which increased James' schema for the word lock. Mrs. Compton's use of an analogy is not a new teaching strategy—analogies have been around for a long time. Few middle level teachers, however, feel knowledgeable enough to make analogical reasoning instruction part of their classroom curriculum. Furthermore, little instruction is provided for teachers in either their pre-service or in-service education to help them clarify and extend the analogy process for their students. In this article, we will: (a) define analogies, (b) discuss the benefits of teaching students to create analogies, and (c) present a five-step strategy for analogy instruction which teachers can apply to any area of the curriculum. What are analogies? An analogy is a comparison between two distinct domains of knowledge. More simply stated, analogies are pairs of words that are alike in the same way. Whenever something is explained by using a comparison with other phenomena or concepts (usually from familiar to unfamiliar information) an analogy is involved, as illustrated in the exchange between James and Mrs. Compton. Analogies may be presented in several ways. The most frequently used forms are: A is to B as C is to D (usually written as A:B:: C:D), or A is to C as B is to D (usually written A:C:: B:D). A good example would be doctor is to patient as lawyer is to client (i.e., doctor:patient :: lawyerxlient). Examples of exercises containing analogies have either one or two parts: A:B:: C: or A:B:: . The reader must first understand the parts of an analogy and then determine the relationship between the pairs. This step is very important and will be explained in greater detail in the strategy section. Why teach analogies? Today the analogy is best known as a testing tool and predictor of mental performance and March 1993 47</page><page sequence="2">Middle School Journal ■— March 1993 48 intelligence. However, analogy use began as far back as the fifth century B.C. (Davis &amp; Si ojo, 1972) and has been used throughout history as an important teaching tool of both metaphysics and literature. Burt, in England (1911), and Woodworth and Wells (1911), in the United States, were the first to use analogies as test items in education to predict collegiate success and in business and government to predict success in upper management positions. During the past decade, several reading researchers have cited analogy instruction as a powerful tool to help students learn unfamiliar concepts and develop vocabulary knowledge in content area curricula (Vosniadou &amp; Ortony, 1983; Burns, 1984; Bean, Singer, &amp; Cowan, 1985). More recently, studies reported by Silkebakken (1987), and Judy, Alexander, Kulikowich and Wilson (1988) have indicated that sixth graders who received direct instruction in analogy problem solving performed significantly higher on reading comprehension tasks than controlled subjects of matched abilities. Additionally, the Report of the Commission on Reading (1985), stressed the need for teachers to devote more time to comprehension instruction and stated that "Teacher-led instruction in reading strategies and other aspects of comprehension promotes reading achievement" (Anderson, Hiebert, Scott &amp; Wiklinson, 1985, p. 118). Furthermore, the Commission reported that students' learning was facilitated when skills in critical thinking were directly taught by the teacher (Patching, Kameenui, Camine, Gerslen, &amp; Colvin, 1983; Baumann, 1984; Palinscar &amp; Brown, 1984). The notion of activating students' prior knowledge is based on schema theories (Rumelhart and Norman, 1981; Anderson, 1984; Anderson &amp; Pearson, 1984). When students have some prior knowledge of a topic, their storehouse of knowledge, or topic schema, provides a framework for assimilating the new knowledge. Unfortunately, students do not always spontaneously integrate old and new knowledge (Anderson, 1984). Creating analogies forms a bridge between students' existing knowledge and new information. Readers who have received instruction in strategies such as creating analogies which assist them in focusing, synthesizing, and integrating the material with what they already know (Paris, Cross, &amp; Lipson, 1984) comprehend unfamiliar text material more easily. The value of analogy instruction lies not only in aiding students to increase their test scores, but by virtue of their structure, analogies can be used to clarify, summarize, and organize information. Teaching strategies which facilitate comprehension and retention of new concepts seem especially vital in an age of increasing technological information. Analogous thinking has real-world applications for students. For example, many advertisers demonstrate the usefulness or desirability of their products through analogous, simulated situations in order to establish direct comparisons. Students who have had practice evaluating the appropriateness of comparisons are more likely to be able to correctly judge the validity of the advertiser's claim. Teaching students to use analogies To implement analogy instruction, middle school teachers may want to begin with professionally prepared materials. These materials are readily available from commercial publishers such as Midwest Publications, Continental Press, and Developmental Learning Materials. Once materials have been identified, teachers may use the following five-step strategy to instruct their students in analogous thinking: (1) analyze different kinds of relationships in</page><page sequence="3">Middle School Journal prepared analogies, (2) balance terms in prepared analogies, (3) create original analogies, (4) discuss terms in analogies they created, and (5) explain self-generated analogies to other students. 1. Analyze different kinds of relationships Middle school students need to begin learning about analogies with oral, concrete, and visual examples so that they can practice finding relationships between words with immediate success. For example, part to whole analogies are good for openers. (For example, leaf:tree:: page:book.) Students should name the relationship between given parts first. This may be stated "the leaf is a part of a tree just as a page is part of a book." (This is a very important step because you will want students to do this automatically with more difficult comparisons.) Part/whole - scales:fish :: bark:tree Synonyms - explore:search :: locate:discover Association - fish:swim :: birdifly Antonyms - full:empty :: send:receive Functional - heart:blood :: pump:water Degree of - definitely:certain:: maybe:probable Quantitative - ACA:BCA :: 131:231; 2:4 :: 8:16 Word Patterns - ear:clear :: all:small 2. Balance terms in provided analogy problems An analogy is a comparison of relationships between two different domains of knowledge (or sets). There must be a balance between sets just as in a math problem. Students should be exposed to various forms of analogy problems. For example, hot is to cold as near is to The relationship between near and must be the same as hot and cold. Thus the student is balancing the pair when an antonym is given to complete the second set. Students will also read an analogy only in an a:b :: c:d or a:c :: b:d sequence. Try this: bird:sparrow :: (boy, mammal, phylum):human being. In this analogy if you said any answer for the third position other than mammal, you just read the analogy incorrectly. The relationship between a:b or bird to sparrow is one of class to a member. Human beings are members of the larger class of mammals. Try some additional items: brush:paint:: pencil: :football:: throw:baseball valuable:worthless:: :cheap teacher: :: musician:entertainment The first two strategies, analyzing and balancing, are prerequisite steps which students need to experience when they first begin to work with analogies. As they become more proficient in analogous reasoning, these two steps may be deleted except in cases where students are dealing with highly complex or previously unknown, complicated material. 3. Create original analogies Teachers who have modeled and discussed several different types of analogies, find most students naturally able to begin creating their own. Encourage students to use words they already know with new words just introduced from text lessons. For example, a group of sixth graders were introduced to a new meaning of the word composed in their textbook. The teacher asked the students to think of synonyms and antonyms for the new word. They came up with several and created these analogies: "composed is to calm as nervous is to jittery" and "composed is to calm as relaxed is to steady." They began transferring this knowledge to every day experiences and to new events around them. Here are some student-generated analogies using synonyms and antonyms: composedxalm:: nervousijittery composed:calm:: relaxed:steady composedxalm:: relaxed:quiet 4. Discuss reading passages using self generated analogies Many difficult and abstract concepts may be presented through the use of "good" analogies. For example, a ninth grade science teacher found analogous examples helped her students with learning different types of chemical reactions. First, she introduced four types of chemical reactions. Next, the class discussed how each could be compared through anthropomorphic statements and showed their understanding of the generic symbols in the generalized equations with comments such as "chemical reactions are like mini soap operas." 5. Explain self-generated analogies Students should have opportunities to explain their self-generated analogies to other members of their groups or to the class. As teachers, we all know that many times we did not really understand a concept until we had to teach it. The unique characteristics of middle school students makes peer teaching an effective tool. March 1993 49</page><page sequence="4">Middle School Journal March 1993 50 Analogy instruction in Mrs. Compton's class To illustrate how students create, discuss, and explain analogies, we will examine how Mrs. Compton incorporates analogous reasoning in her social studies lessons on Canada. Mrs. Compton began the study of Canada with a brainstorming activity in which students activated their prior knowledge about the topic. Mrs. Compton created a cluster on the board of what students already knew about Canada .Next, the class discussed what they would like to know about Canada and Mrs. Compton again led a brainstorming activity in which students created a list of research questions which students would use to guide their study during this unit. After forming research groups, students were directed to read the chapter on Canada in their textbook and create analogies between the new topics in this chapter and their prior knowledge of geography. Students generated the following analogies: Texas:Alaska :: size of Canadarsize of Soviet Union Washington, DC:the U.S.:: Ottawa:Canada States:US:: Provinces:Canada Mississippi:US :: McKenzie River: Canada Next, students discussed their self-generated analogies in their groups. Finally, students from each group explained their analogies and how they formed them to the rest of the class. Conclusion Analogical reasoning is an important element of today's middle school curriculum. Through analogies students can often derive meaning from a variety of text vocabulary and concepts which would otherwise be difficult to understand. Using the five-step strategy presented here, the teacher sets the stage for divergent thinking as well as helps students develop appropriate and useful analogies which can be supported by reasonable explanation.
