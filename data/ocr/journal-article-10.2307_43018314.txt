<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEREDITH R. MACHEN Northern New Mexico Community College Carlyle's Presence in The Professor's House Willa Cather's The Professor's House is a subtle and a masterful blend of her personal and her literary experience. Critics generally acknowledge the autobiographical elements of the work: the parallels between the Professor's strong reluctance to leave his study in the old house, and Cather's feeling of loss at not being able to use the quiet sewing room at the back of Isabelle McClung's home in Pittsburgh after her friend's marriage and subsequent move; the similarity of the Pro- fessor's depressed psychological state to Cather's in the early 1920's; and the correspondence of Tom Outland's Cliff City with the areas of the Southwest with which Cather was familiar.1 Although these links are crucial for our understanding of the work, her personal experiences do not account for all aspects of the novel. If we examine one of the more important literary experiences of Willa Cather, we can see a different dimension of the work. Thomas Carlyle had a tremendous impact on Cather from the time she was an impressionable young student to the time she was an accomplished writer. By scrutinizing the parallels between Sartor Resartus and The Professor's House , we may come to a clearer understanding of the artistry in this work of Cather's. 1The best treatment of the autobiographical elements of the work is Leon Edel's essay in his book, Literary Biography. E. K. Brown and James Woodress also deal with the matter in their biographies, Willa Cather: A Critical Biography and Willa Cather: Her Life and Art, respectively.</page><page sequence="2">274 Western American Literature The essay Willa Cather wrote on Thomas Carlyle when she was a "second prep" at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in 1891 stuck so firmly in her mind that when she was asked to speak extempor- aneously on Carlyle at a Pittsburgh's women's club meeting years later, she presented her essay verbatim.2 Because she had been assigned to write on the personal characteristics of Thomas Carlyle, little of the essay is specifically devoted to Sartor Resartus. However, in one section, she refutes the critics "who assert that 'Sartor Resartus' is but the result of a year of miserable health, the morbid fancies of a sick man." If it is, she insists, "it is a new and pleasing feature of bad gastronomy."3 In another section, she imagines Carlyle's anger at being interrupted by his wife while he is writing the soliloquies of Diogenes Teufelsdröckh. "The wife of an artist, if he continues to be an artist, must always be a secondary consideration with him; she should realize that from the out- set."4 She understood Carlyle's need for solitude and she sympathized with him for all the disturbances he had to endure. Though Willa Cather was only sixteen years old at the time she wrote the essay, she wrote movingly of the man - his loneliness and despair, his dedication to art, his reverence for life. Her English teacher, as the story goes, was so impressed by her essay that he wrote the following baroque sentence from her work on the board: Like the lone survivor of some extinct species, the last of the mammoths, tortured and harrassed beyond all endurance by the smaller, though perhaps more perfectly organized offspring of the world's maturer years, this great Titan, son of her passionate youth, a youth of volcanoes and earthquakes, and great unsys- tematized forces, rushed off into the desert to suffer alone. Without her knowledge, he had the essay published in the March 1, 1891, editions of the local paper, the Nebraska State Journal , and the 2In a letter to Mariel Gere dated August 10, 1896 (in the Rare Manuscript Collection at the Beinecke Library, Yale University), Willa Cather writes that she was astonished that she had had the nerve to dupe her audience. She was well aware of the sophmoric quality of the writing, but she delivered it with the same intense fervor with which it was written. .Thereafter, she says, she became the "darling" of the club women. 3Bernice Slote, ed., The Kingdom of Art : Willa Cather* s First Principles and Critical Statements 1893-1896 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1966), p. 424.

Machen 275 University literary magazine, The Hesperian .5 Willa Cather was so struck by seeing her work in print that she immediately changed her chosen major from science to writing. She never forgot that thrill; the Carlyle essay represented her awakening as a literary artist. In a letter to Will Owen Jones dated March 22, 1937, she explained at length what the experience had meant to her. Although she realized that the writing was "florid" and full of "high-flown figures of speech," she had been "honest" about "the pleasure and delightful bitterness" that Carlyle had stirred up in her.6 For years, the experience of having read Sartor Resartus lay dor- mant in Willa Cather's mind, but there is strong internal evidence that it revived when she wrote The Professor's House . The correspondences between Carlyle's work and Cather's help to explain many puzzling features of the novel. In terms of structure, characterization and theme, there are some interesting parallels between the two works. Cather has been criticized for the bold break in the narrative form of The Professor's House.7 But if we look at the structure of Sartor Resartus , we can better understand Cather's purpose. Both Carlyle's and Cather's works are divided into three books. In Book I of Sartor Resartus , the Professor is presented by a narrator. In Book I of The Professor's House , the Professor is presented by a narrator. In Book II of Carlyle's work, there is an abrupt shift in point of view. In Cather's work, there is a shift in the same place. Book II of Sartor Resartus is the autobiography of Diogenes Teufelsdröckh; Book II of The Pro- fessors' House is the autobiography of Tom Outland. In Book II of Carlyle's work, we see the Romantic reaffirmation of life in the Professor's metaphysical and social applications of the Philosophy of Clothes. And in Book III of Cather's work, we see St. Peter's Stoic acceptance of life following the example of Augusta, the family clothesmaker. If Cather had presented the autobiography of St. Peter in Book II, she would 5E. K. Brown, Willa Cather: A Critical Biography (New York: Alfred A.

Because she doesn't, we have a clue to the function of the interpolated autobiography of Tom Outland. His story is not an intrusion into the Professor's story: it is ger- mane to our understanding of St. Peter. Tom is the ideal professor because, like Diogenes Teufelsdröckh in Carlyle's work, he acts out his beliefs and doesn't compromise them. St. Peter's disillusionment comes from his realization of concessions he has made in his life that Outland never had to make. Cather wants us to recognize, however, that her Professor cannot live the way his student did. Tom Outland did not have to accommodate himself to the demands of modern society. When he was at the ancient cliff dwellings, he was in a world frozen in time. And then he did not live long enough after he invented the bulkheaded vacuum to compromise his integrity. "He had made something new in the world - and the rewards, the meaningless conventional gestures, he had left to others."8 St. Peter has a more stoical philosophy than Tom Outland and Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, because he knows "the bloomless side of life" {PH, p. 278). 9 Life involves certain inevitable, irreversible defeats of spirit. The symbols of the past found in art and religion are the only things that he can cling to. Cather's purpose in breaking up St. Peter's story becomes clearer when we look back to Sartor Resartus. Not only are the structures of these two works similar, but many details of characterization and theme correspond as well. Cather took certain elements from Carlyle's work; others she ignored completely.10 8Willa Gather, The Professor's House (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1938), p. 259. All future references to this work will appear parenthetically in the text of this paper, prefaced by PH. 9The Professor learns about "the bloomless side of life from Augusta" after his deep sleep, and subsequently he prepares himself to "face with fortitude the Berengaria and the future" (PH, p. 281). In contrast, both Tom Outland and Diogenes Teufels- dröckh are more Romantic. They see life more positively, and they experience religious "epiphanies." 10She does something similar in My Mortal Enemy with Gloucester's cliff. An element which in King Lear is of secondary importance becomes an obsession to Cather's character, Myra Henshawe. The cliff is the one place where she feels she can obtain absolution, and one morning she hires a cab to take her there so she can die alone in her spot. A good treatment of Cather's such use of other materials appears in Harry B. Eichorn, "A Falling Out With Love: My Mortal Enemy" Colby Library Quarterly, 10, No. 3 (1973), 121-38. Cather selected certain elements for "the eternal material of art." For a further discussion of her methods, consult her essay "The Novel Démeublé" in Willa Cather on Writing, edited by Stephen Tennant (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1953), pp. 35-43.</page><page sequence="5">Meredith R . Machen 277 Because Cather had a pictorial imagination, she picked up details that many a Carlyle reader might not notice. She selected specific elements such as the Professor's appearance and his attic retreat, with its scanty ventilation and light. The other occupant of the study she connected to the Philosophy of Clothes, the basis of Sartor Resartus . Teufelsdröckh's appreciation of the ancient civilization, his mental return to youth, his disillusionment with life and subsequent acceptance of it also struck her. Cather recognized that her philosophy was similar to Carlyle's: she too wished to criticize her society, to point out the values of past civiliza- tions, and to reaffirm a transcendental reality. As we examine each ele- ment of Carlyle's work which Cather used, we can see how well he fit her purposes. First of all, Cather like Carlyle was very interested in names. Both chose their protagonists' names for their symbolic values. Diogenes Teu- felsdröckh means God-begotten devil's dung.11 The name of Cather's character, Godfrey St. Peter, has the opposite meaning and the oppo- site associations. Godfrey literally means bearing the peace of God and recalls Godfrey of Bouillon, the chosen chief of the allied Crusaders who captured Jerusalem back from the Saracens.12 St. Peter suggests both the apostle upon whom Christ based his church and St. Peter the Hermit, the famous pilgrim who preached to the people (before God- frey's conquest) that they should rescue their Holy City from the infi- dels.13 Until Book III, Godfrey St. Peter has few doubts about his own 11G. B. Tennyson, ed., "Sartor Resartus" in A Carlyle Reader (New York: Modern Library, 1969), p. 122. All future references to this work will appear paren- thetically in the text of this paper, prefaced by SR. 12Godfrey of Bouillon became King of Jerusalem and was known to despise power, wealth, and fame. Willa Cather suggests the relationship of her protagonist to the historical Godfrey when she relates the story of Godfrey St. Peter's having "posed his two sons-in-law in a tapestry-hung tent, for a conference between Richard Planta- genet and the Saladin, before the walls of Jerusalem." In history, Saladin retook Jerusalem, and the Professor appropriately poses Louie Marsellus in this role; clearly, in the novel, Louie usurps the domain which was once the Professor's. Scott as Richard the Lion-hearted, strong and courageous, but unsuccessful in his fight for Jerusalem, is aptly characterized. All these references to the Crusades are significant for our interpretation of the Professor's role in the modern unfaithful society. They may also explain why his life work was on the Spanish conquistadores: they brought the Crusades to America. 13For the meaning of Apostle St. Peter's name see Matthew 16:18. Perhaps there is a connection between the Rock on which Christ is to build his church and the rock on which Cliff City stands.

His placid temperament jars with his crusading spirit and thus causes his anxiety. Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, in contrast, doubts both himself and the world around him. His Romantic nature, unlike St. Peter's Stoic one, makes him feel every malady around him as if it were his own. In the course of both books, the authors say that their characters were influenced by their names. Godfrey St. Peter and Diogenes Teufelsdröckh are two sides of the same coin.14 Not only are the names of the two professors related, but also their appearances are similar. Both have heavy eyebrows and intense eyes and look like Mephistopheles. Notice their kinship in Carlyle's and Cather's descriptions: In thy eyes too, deep under their shaggy brows, and looking out so still and dreamy, have we not noticed gleams of an ethereal or else a diabolic fire, and half fancied that their stillness was but the rest of the infinite motion, the sleep of a spinning- top? (SR, p. 134). . . . you look on him almost with a shudder, as on some incar- nate Mephistopheles, to whom this great terrestial and celestial Round, after all, were but some foolish Whirligig ( SR , p. 145). With this silky, very black hair, he had a tawny skin with gold lights in it, a hawk nose, and hawk-like eyes - brown and gold and green. They were set in ample cavities, with plenty of room to move about, under thick, curly, black eyebrows that turned up sharply at the outer ends, like military moustaches. His wicked- looking eyebrows made his students call him Mephistopheles - and there was no evading the searching eyes underneath them; eyes that in a flash could pick out a friend or an unusual stranger from a throng. They had lost none of their fire, though just now the man behind them was feeling a diminution of ardour ( PH , pp. 5-6). Both professors are also middle aged ( SR , p. 142 and PH, p. 264), and both are connected with similar places of retreat. Note in Carlyle: the Professor's private domicile . . . was the attic floor of the highest house in Wahngassee (SR, p. 137). In his "watchtower" he could get away from all the chaos and be above the world. Likewise, Professor St. Peter liked to retreat to his slanted- 14See Sartor Re s artus, p. 184 and The Professor's House, pp. 263-64.</page><page sequence="7">Meredith R. Machen 279 roof study at the top of the house : Fairly considered, the sewing-room was the most inconvenient study a man could possibly have, but it was the one place in the house where he could get isolation, insulation from the engaging drama of domestic life. No one was tramping over him and only a vague sense, generally pleasant, of what went on below came up the narrow stairway {PH, p. 19). Both men write their life works - The Philosophy of Clothes in the case of Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, and The Spanish Adventurers in the case of Godfrey St. Peter - by the single lights that they used {SR, p. 136 and PH , p. 10). Each professor has an older woman who works in his study: Old Lieschen (Lisekin, 'Liza), who was his bed-maker and stove- lighter, his washer and wringer, cook, errand-maid, and general lion's-provider, and for the rest a very orderly creature, had no sovereign authority in this last citadel of Teufelsdröckh {SR, p. 139). Like Augusta in The Professor's House , Lieschen had a "look of helpful intelligence, almost of benevolence" {SR, p. 140). This "helpful intelligence" of Lieschen may have suggested to Cather a more signifi- cant role for her character, Augusta, who saves the Professor from being asphyxiated. She is part of St. Peter's life in his study just as Lieschen is part of Teufelsdröckh's. Here is Cather's description of the study's other inhabitant: This was the place where he worked. And not he alone. For three weeks in the fall, again three in the spring, he shared his cuddy with Augusta, the sewing-woman, niece of his old land- lord, a reliable, methodical spinster, a German Catholic and very devout {PH, p. 9) . Perhaps Augusta is given the role of sewing-woman to relate to the idea of Sartor Resartus which means the tailor retailored.15 This would help to explain why Cather dwells on the importance of the sewer's manni- kins to St. Peter, and why she goes into such detail about the clothes that his daughters, Rosamond and Kathleen, and his wife, Lillian, wear.16 15Sartor Resartus, p. 122. 16St. Peter refuses to let Augusta disturb the formsj no matter how hard and empty they are. They represent concepts or beliefs that he must protect, even though they recall "certain disappointments" and "cruel biological necessities" (PH, p. 15).</page><page sequence="8">280 Western American Literature The bust of his wife appeared deceptively soft and sympathetic to St. Peter and the form used for his daughters had "no viscera behind its glistening ribs" ( PH , pp. 10-11). Since Tom Outland's death, the Pro- fessor has become impatient with his daughters' and his wife's petty obsession with clothes - a reflection of their more serious flaw, crass materialism. All three of them vie for attention and sympathy, and as a consequence, the Professor becomes disenchanted with them. In Sartor Resartus, the other professor also sees through the appear- ances of fancy clothes to the real substance or lack of substance beneath them.17 Like Teufelsdröckh, Professor St. Peter is not impressed by the exteriors of people. He is extremely aware of how uncomfortable Tom Outland was in his heavy coat, new shoes, and stiff white shirt; and he reacts strongly to his wife's and daughters' new adornments. We are told that "for looks, the fewer clothes he [the professor] had on, the better. Anything that clung to his body showed it to be built upon extremely good bones, with the slender hips and springy shoulders of a tireless swimmer" ( PH , p. 5). Both see the baseness of clothes and yet acknowl- edge their importance in clothing the naked human animal.18 For both, clothes are metaphors for personalities, for clothes can express or mask true personalities. Cather's descriptions of the Professor's reactions to his family's self- indulgences prepare us for his deeper disillusionment with them. "In great misfortunes, he told himself, people want to be alone. They have a right to be. And the misfortunes that occur within one are the great- est. Surely the saddest thing in the world is the falling out of love - if one has ever fallen in" ( PH , p. 273). Diogenes Teufelsdröckh also falls out of love, when he loses his Blumine to another. He, too, feels iso- lated from life and especially meditative. Both professors had previously valued love highly. We are told in The Professor's House that in his youth "he was always consciously or unconsciously conjugating the verb ťto love' " ( PH , p. 262). There is a passage in Sartor Resartus which suggests that the German Professor had a similar nature before his bad experience : 17See Books VIII and IX of Sartor Resartus. 18For a thorough discussion of this, see David Stouck, "Willa Cather and The Professor's House: 'Letting Go With The Heart'," Western American Literature , 7, No. 1 (1972), pp. 13-24. For Willa Cather's own conversion to religion in 1922 (the year the world broke in two for her), see Woodress, p. 197.</page><page sequence="9">Meredith R. Machen 281 A certain orthodox Anthropomorphism connects my Me with all Thees in bonds of Love. ... Is the pitifullest mortal Person, think you, indifferent to us? Is it not rather our heartfelt wish to be made one with him; to unite him to us by gratitude, by admira- tion, even by fear; or failing all these, unite ourselves to him? o SR , p. 217). But after the two professors have fallen out of love, «they lose what was once the crucial reason for existence. In his solitude, Teufelsdröckh was able to look very closely "into the true centre of the matter" (SR, p. 144). So, too, Professor St. Peter "seemed to be at the root of the matter. ... He seemed to know, among other things, that he was solitary and must always be so; he had never married, never been a father. He was earth, and would return to earth" ( PH , p. 263). And when their love lives are over, both men journey mentally back to their childhood homes and experience a second youth. Diogenes Teufelsdröckh's early life "produced on the boyish heart and fancy a quite indelible impression" (SR, p. 182). When he was young, he had acquired "a certain deeper sympathy with animated Nature" (SR. p. 188), by living on a farm. Likewise "the Kansas boy who had come back to St. Peter this summer was not a scholar. He was a primitive. He was only interested in earth and woods and water" (PH, pp. 262-63). Their remembrances of youth revitalize them. Along with their travels into their personal pasts, both remember visits to ancient dwelling places. Teufelsdröckh's feelings toward civili- zations of the past aren't far removed from those expressed in Cather's novel. He says: 'Towns also and Cities, especially the ancient, I failed not to look upon with interest. How beautiful to see thereby, as though a long vista, into the remote Time; to have as it were, an actual section of almost the earliest Past brought safe into the Present, and set before your eyes!' (SR, p. 242). When Tom Outland returns to the Blue Mesa only to find that Roddy Blake has sold his precious artifacts to a German collector, he exclaims: 'There never was any question of money with me, where this mesa and its people were concerned. They were something that ha s been preserved through the ages by a miracle, and handed on to you and me, two poor cowpunchers, rough and ignorant, but I thought we were men enough to keep a trust. I'd as soon have</page><page sequence="10">282 Western American Literature sold my own grandmother as Mother Eve - I'd have sold any living woman first (PH, p. 243) . Most of the central section of The Professor's House is concerned with the reverence toward the ancient civilization which Tom feels. The Pro- fessor identifies with these feelings. "Through Outland's studies, long after they had ceased to be pupil and master, he had been able to experience afresh things that had grown dull with use. ... To share his thoughts was to see old perspectives transformed by new effects of light" ( PH , p. 256). The Professor thought back on his travels to the Southwest with Tom just before he went into his deep stupor. His sleep echoes back to Tom's sleep {PH, p. 247) after he has broken with his friend. After Roddy leaves Cliff City, Tom goes to sleep hoping he "would never waken" (PH, p. 247). But when he awakens, Tom feels a "religious emotion" and "great happiness" (PH, p. 249). His vitality is renewed and he works from dawn to dark on his various studies. He follows Teufelsdröckh's precept: Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might. Work while it is called Today; for the night cometh, wherein no man can work (SR, p. 260). The professor also benefits from his sleep, although not as radically, as we shall see. In any case, the deep slumbers of Tom and the Professor recall the sleep of Diogenes Teufelsdröckh. When Willa Cather gave Robert Frost an autographed copy of The Professor's House, she inscribed a few words. She said the book was about the "letting go with the heart." Both professors lose parts of themselves and learn that their lives must somehow involve faith. Before they do, though, they have to experience first despair, then indifference. In Sartor Resartus, these three stages are clearly marked and are called the "Everlasting Nay," the "Centre of Indifference," and the "Everlast- ing Yea." In Teufelsdröckh's deep depression, he contemplates suicide, for he believes that the "Universe was all void of Life, of Purpose, of Volition, even of Hostility" (SR, p. 239). Godfrey, on the other hand, never suffers such a deep feeling of futility. But, he dreads his family's return enough to be suicidal. Death seems like a welcome release. He could remember a time when the loneliness of death had terri- fied him, when the idea of it was insupportable. He used to feel</page><page sequence="11">Meredith R. Machen 283 that if his wife could but lie in the same coffin with him, his body would not be so insensible that the nearness of hers would not give it comfort. But now he thought of eternal solitude with gratefulness; as a release from every obligation, from every form of effort. It was the Truth ( PH , pp. 270-71). After meditating on their own deaths, both men go into the deep sleep that serves as a transition between the negativity of the "Everlasting Nay" and the reconciliation of the "Everlasting Yea." The German Professor describes this state: ťI am way-weary and life weary; I will rest here, were it but to die: to die or to live is alike to me; alike insignificant' ... I lay in that Centre of INDIFFERENCE : Cast, doubtless by benignant upper influence, into a healing sleep ( SR , p. 253) . It was this spell-bound sleep, that "the believing heart surrender [ed]" (SR, p. 204). The Professor in Cather's novel also recovers from his despair and indifferences with the "letting go with the heart" and he emerges into a state similar to the "Everlasting Yea."19 For Carlyle, the term involves both a reconciliation with life and a recognition that "love of happiness is a vain whim" (SR, p. 251). It is only with Renunciation ( Entsagen ) that Life, properly speak- ing, can be said to begin. . . . here is in man a HIGHER than Love of Happiness: he can do without Happiness, and instead thereof find Blessedness! .... Love not Pleasure; love God. This is the EVERLASTING YEA, wherein all contradiction is solved : wherein whoso walks and works, it is well with him (SR, p. 257) . When St. Peter revives from his stupor, he finds Augusta at hig side "reading a little much-worn religious book that she always carried in her handbag" (PH, p. 275). Before his sleep, he had dreaded seeing anyone, even Augusta; but afterwards, he felt more receptive to her wisdom : St. Peter, with half-closed eyes, lay watching her - regarding in her humankind, as if after a definite absence from the world of men and women. If he had thought of Augusta sooner, he would have got up from the couch sooner. Her image would have at 19Clearly, Diogenes Teufelsdröckh is much more affirmative than St. Peter. However, both realize that happiness is relatively unimportant and perhaps unattain- able; and both look to religion to give them comfort.</page><page sequence="12">284 Western American Literature once suggested the proper action. Augusta, he reflected, had always been a corrective, a remedial influence. . . . Very often she gave him some wise observation or discreet comment to begin the day with. She wasn't at all afraid to say things that were heavily, drearily true, and though he used to wince under them, he hur- ried off with the feeling that they were good for him, that he didn't häfve to hear such sayings half often enough. Augusta was like the taste of bitter herbs; she was the bloomless side of life that he had always run away from - yet when he had to face it, he found that it wasn't altogether repugnant (PH} p. 278). Augusta's important role here may have been suggested by Carlyle's question : What too are all Poets and Moral Teachers, but a species of Metaphorical Tailors? (SR, p. 325). Teufelsdröckh realizes that "Faith is properly the one thing needful" (SR, p. 236) ; this seems to be the conclusion of Godfrey St. Peter as well. He also recognizes, like his German counterpart, that he would have to learn "to live without delight" (PH, p. 280). Theoretically he knew that life is possible, may be even pleasant, without joy, without passionate griefs. But it had never occurred to him that he might have to live like that. . . . His temporary release from consciousness seemed to have been beneficial. He had let something go - and it was gone : something precious that he could not consciously have relinquished, probably. . . . He thought he knew where he was, and that he could face with for- titude the Berengaria and the future (PH, pp. 280-81) . The Berengaria is the ship on which the family is returning from Europe, but it also is the name of the estranged wife of Crusader Richard the Lion-Hearted. Thus, we are reminded at the very end of the book of St. Peter's mission. This final passage puts into clearer perspective the lecture St. Peter gave to his students about how art and religion (which are the same thing in the end) have given man the only happi- ness he has ever known and how science has not helped to solve any of the old riddles. He tells his bright student, Tod Miller, that by giving a sense of mystery to the commonplace aspects of life, religion gave man a sense of dignity and purpose. It is only after the Professor's dark night of the soul that he realizes how true his words were. His happiness henceforth will have to come out of art and religion.</page><page sequence="13">Meredith R. Machen 285 Here Cather is again echoing Carlyle's character who lectures against science and for religion and art.20 Teufelsdröckh also says some other things that St. Peter restates : Have any deepest scientific individuals yet dived down to the foundations of the Universe, and gauged everything there? . . . These scientific individuals have been no where but where we also are (SR, p. 302). 'It is in and through Symbols that man, consciously or uncon- sciously lives, works, and has his being. Those ages, moreover, are accounted the noblest which can the best recognise symbolical worth, and prize it the highest. For is not a Symbol ever, to him who has eyes for it, some dimmer or clearer revelation of the God- like? . . . Highest of all Symbols are those wherein the Artist or Poet has risen into Prophet and all men can recognise a present God, and worship the same: I mean Religious Symbols' (SR, pp. 278-89). Tom (Jutland's worth to the Professor is as a creator and preserver of symbols, not as an inventor of a scientific apparatus that had brought worldly success. "He had never handled things that were not the sym- bols of ideas" (PH, p. 258). No one else in Cather's book understands this: they are too involved in the use of the material wealth that results from the machine. St. Peter abhors this baseness in his family and in his colleague, Professor Crane, who spends his life trying to measure the extent of space. Carlyle shows that space is an illusion of man. It means nothing: only symbols such as the ancient civilizations that both men encounter and in which they find unity in society and religion mean any- thing. For both Cather and Carlyle, modern society was to be endured, not enjoyed. Art and religion would give them the only happiness they would ever have. When Willa Cather said that Thomas Carlyle was "like the lone survivor of some extinct species," she saw in him a kindred spirit. In writing that college essay some thirty years before she wrote The Profes- sor's House , she discovered much about herself - not just that she would be a writer, but also that she, too, would be defiant about her beliefs.
