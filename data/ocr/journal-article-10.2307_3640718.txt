(Seattle, University of Washington Press, 1986. 400 pp. $29.95) This beautifully written and illustrated book is a classic in the large literature of whaling history. It covers the final sixty years of American whaling from the first forays against the</page><page sequence="2">356 Pacific Historical Review docile and initially abundant bowhead whale off the icy Siberian and Alaskan coasts in the late 1840s, through the ever riskier penetrations eastward in the Beaufort Sea, the introduction of steam-powered vessels in an effort to wrest a few weeks of whal- ing from the encroaching ice each September (often with hor- rendous losses in life and shipping when the ice closed in too fast), and ending with the near extinction of the bowhead at the beginning of this century and the demise of American commer- cial whaling. John R. Bockstoce is curator of ethnology at the Old Dart- mouth Historical Society Whaling Museum in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He knows the Arctic through personal experi- ence and is one of the few men alive who has hunted whales the old-fashioned way, in small open boats with harpoon and lance (he whaled with Eskimos in the Chukchi Sea in the 1970s). This experience, and the superb photographs which he interprets so well, give the book a sensual immediacy and a technological authority not found in many library-bound studies. His descrip- tions of the equipment of whale killing and how it worked are clearer than any in print. His immersion in hundreds of logs, journals, and other manuscript sources is so thorough that the reader becomes familiar with individual vessels and a caste of hardened, resourceful whalemen. Bockstoce is chronicling an age before the appearance of an environmental and ecological consciousness. His resolute deter- mination to tell the story of Arctic whaling from the point of view of the men who engaged in it, avoiding self-righteous indig- nation and anthropomorphic sympathy with the whale, may anger present-day friends of the whale. But the absence of senti- mentality serves both to recapture the way men thought and behaved and to trace with year by year objectivity the terrible depredation of the whales, the walrus (slaughtered in an ancil- lary activity), and the Eskimos who starved when their natural food was gone. The book's value is enhanced by appendices of statistics, place-names, and whaling terms. There is an excellent bibliog- raphy as well. Yale University GADDIS SMITH</page></plain_text>
