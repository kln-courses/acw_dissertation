<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gordon Kaufman's Astronauts: A Review Essay of Jesus and Creativity Randall E. Auxier / Southern Illinois University Carbon ale I. Introduction Jesus and Creativity is an excellent book.1 I will adopt a critical tone \J and stance in what follows, but I would not want this to be misunderstood. I may question the wisdom of Kaufman's general strategy for taking liberal Christianity into the twenty-first century, but I do not question the execution of that aim in the least. Even for those, such as I, who are disposed to be critical of an impersonalist account of God, which is here supplemented with an impersonalist Jesus (that may be hard to imagine, but it has been accomplished), Kaufman's newest books come as a serious challenge to our assumptions. The book is beautifully written, with an economy of language and expression that few academic writers could achieve, even if they made the effort. Kaufman accomplishes in 114 pages what many excellent thinkers could not have done in 500. And Kaufman knows his intended audience i.e., the postmodern Christian who accepts scientific truth as the best arbiter of human knowledge, and who finds implausible (no longer believable) those aspects of traditional religious faith which cannot be squared with a broad naturalism and historicism. Indeed, Kaufman finds this audience, and speaks to it extremely well. Given the standard assumptions made by his intended readers (and it is a numerous group), Kaufman's arguments are simply definitive; his arguments are convincing even to those who do not share the naturalistic and historicist assumptions about the relationship between faith and knowledge, to many who do not cast religious faith or practice in epistemic terms. I will return to this point in the critique section of this essay. 1 Gordon D. Kaufman, Jesus and Creativity (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2006).</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 19 II. In the Beginning We cannot get a handle on the project Gordon Kaufman has carried out in Jesus and Creativity without reviewing the ground laid for it in his 2004 book, In the beginning . . . Creativity? Here Kaufman states as the desideratum, "just what it might mean to think of God not as a personal being who had created the world and everything in it, and who continues to work creatively in and upon that world, but rather as neither more nor less than just this creativity itself (however that is to be understood) manifest through the vast cosmos as we today think of it."3 There is an advantage and a disadvantage in setting for oneself such a goal. Few ideas are more difficult to deal with conceptually than "God," but among those few is surely "creativity." Hence, in retreating from a difficult idea with a bloody history of trench warfare (which must be counted an advantage), Kaufman confronts a still more difficult idea with little definitive history (a disadvantage for sure), but at least no one seems to have killed anyone for control of its meaning, yet. In my view, this is not exactly a promising way of solving the problem of the "God symbol," as Kaufman calls it, in the present culture wars. Rather, it is almost as though a general of the First World War had decided to evade the trench-lines of the enemy and no-man's land by flying to the moon instead. In a sense, such a plan might just work those old battle lines are rendered irrelevant to one with moon-access. Yet, back on earth the trenches are still occupied, the machine-guns are loaded, the bayonets are sharp, everyone claims God is on his/her side, and no one shows any signs of abandoning the front. Whether Kaufman and his brave band of astronauts have attained the moon will not in any obvious way bring peace to the culture-warriors, who are far more numerous than these astronauts. In Kaufman's defense, he simply is not trying to sway the people in the trenches, but the culture warriors seem to command nearly all the resources relevant to building (or destroying) the future of humanity and the world. I say "nearly all," because the culture warriors do not control the exchange of ideas, and ideas are admittedly important. 2 Gordon D. Kaufman, In the beginning . . . Creativity (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2004). 3 Kaufman, In the beginning, x.</page><page sequence="3">20 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy A key assumption underlying Kaufman's "creativity project" (as I shall call these two books) is that today's new ideas are (or can become) tomorrow's common sense. There is thus a progressivism embedded in Kaufman's outlook; someone needs to be thinking ahead and adumbrating tomorrow's ideas so that when we arrive in the future, we will be thinking "this" rather than "that" or "the other." "This" (i.e., Kaufman's view) is a turn away from the blood-soaked God of Abraham to "an image/concept much better fitted to encourage our coming to terms with today's massive ecological and pluralistic issues the central religious challenge of our time."4 Thus, in a sense, Kaufman does aim to ameliorate the culture wars, evidently by simply thinking beyond them or outside of their pill-boxes. I think this will surely fail to help, but I do not think it does any harm. The view, of course, is that creativity is God, and in three modalities: Creativityi creativity in an absolutist form (so to speak), in its total inexplicability and its questionable intelligibility is exemplified in the contemporary picture of the Big Bang .... Creativity2 following on the Big Bang in a 14-billion-year exceedingly complex development appeared within the enormous expansion and eventual proliferation of cosmic and biological trajectories . . . [and C]reativity3 [is] human symbolic and cultural creative activity, eventually leading to a self-conscious and deliberate creation of countless cultural/symbolic forms, realities and worlds.5 Each modality involves mystery, according to Kaufman, and in the end, each modality is itself an idea, at bottom, a product of creativity3.6 The claim that the first two kinds of creativity are dependent for their conception upon the third kind is a brand of idealism, of course, but Kaufman is not making ontological claims about the primacy of ideas in creating the intelligible universe. He assumes there is a natural universe that precedes the appearance of our symbol systems by 14 billion years, but he is content to note that "there is no way ... for us to check this out apart from further symbolic testing and other imaginative activity 4 Ibid., 106. 5 Ibid., 100-101. 6 Ibid., 102.</page><page sequence="4">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 21 (creativity3). Ideas are, at least, functional prerequisites for making sense of our universe. There is, then, the added assumption for Kaufman that we at least can change our lives by changing our thinking whether Kaufman thinks that we must change our thinking in order to change our lives is not wholly clear, but given his emphasis upon serendipity in the universe, it seems that we could easily find ourselves in altered ontological circumstances without having paved the way in our thinking. This is a process-oriented ontology. But what is clear is that Kaufman regards "creativity" as, if not the sole Archimedean point of future theology, one of a small handful of such ideas. Creativity is the idea by which Kaufman's astronauts should appropriate their God. How they are to communicate it to the entrenched culture warriors is another matter. This sets the stage for Jesus and Creativity. III. Jesus In this most recent installation of the creativity project, Kaufman consciously struggles with the same challenge to Christian faith as liberal philosophical theologians have undertaken in a clear line since Josiah Royce's The Problem of Christianity? proceeding notably through the thought of such thinkers as H.N. Wieman and H. Richard Niebuhr, which is to reconstruct and actively transform our understanding of the Christian tradition from within, to salvage a core spiritual meaning in that tradition without the fetters of the violent and now implausible beliefs of the past. While he set his sights on the idea of God in the first book, he seeks to transform the idea of Jesus in this volume. Kaufman's theological vision is both minimalist and austere. By minimalist I mean that he seeks to reorient the Christian faith around as few of its central ideas as can be managed, a parsimony borrowed from the impulse of science to explain the universe with as few basic principles as possible. By austere I mean that we are to be realistic about the way our world is, filled with violence, tragedy, death and suffering, and to find our religious consolation and meaning in life with as little in the way of self-deceptive psychological make-believe as possible. Kaufman's God is not a comforter, and we are warned against 7 Ibid., 102. 8 Josiah Royce, The Problem of Christianity, 2 vols. (New York: Macmillan, 1913).</page><page sequence="5">22 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy imagining that God has any special interest in humanity as a whole, let alone in our individual lives. We must find hope without turning to merely fabricated stories about another heavenly world in which things are better than they are here, without any expectation that all injustice will be set aright in the end, and without laying all human (or other) suffering at God's doorstep, as if instances of unmerited suffering were promissory notes God must later pay. For Kaufman there is no second world, no hope of personal immortality, no miracles, no bodily resurrections, no heaven, and most of all no final judgment in which the wicked finally get their punishments. Things are as they are; this life is what it is and not a rehearsal for something else. Most importantly, what humans experience as evil is not necessarily evil from a cosmic vantage point; our tendency to think of events that bring us suffering as evil is just egocentricity, even selfish and myopic. Given the state of the world insofar as history has recorded it for us, not lacking in events that bring us suffering, this is austere. It is beyond austere. At least Kaufman does refrain from blaming us for the situation, as Calvinists like to do. But Kaufman's God does not love us or anything else, for which our consolation is that at least God is not hostile to us either. One gets the impression that if Kaufman could have found a way to preserve the Christian community with the conception of God as creativity, and without Jesus, it would have gratified his minimalism. He indicates that he had not foreseen the need for the book on Jesus when he published the first book,9 but he came to realize after writing it that Christians needed more. As he puts it: "However awe-inspiring and beautiful the modern/postmodern story of the steadily developing creation of the universe may be, the notion of creativity by itself like the notion of God the creator by itself is not sufficient for developing a conception of God that can fully and adequately orient and order human life."10 In short, it is too minimal and too austere. This impersonal God casts Jesus in a demanding role in the cosmic story for Christians, in the sense that Jesus must somehow compensate us for a God that does not love us. Perhaps at least we have a friend in Jesus? One might suppose that the Jesus of the creativity project simply has to be the paradigmatic individual (to use the phrase of Jaspers), the principal person, for Christians; or one might suppose that Kaufman's Jesus is the hero of an epic whose stage is history. One would suppose 9 See Kaufman, Jesus, xi. 10 Ibid. 6.</page><page sequence="6">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 23 wrongly. Jesus is a hero, but only as having made an impression in a small corner of the world that grew serendipitously into a movement that changed the world in major ways. Jesus is not a world historical individual for Kaufman until his movement heroizes him. But Jesus has become the hero in two quite different ways, which Kaufman labels "trajectories." On the first trajectory, Jesus is made into a divine being by historical steps, culminating in the declaration of the Chalcedonian Council in 451 CE that Jesus is fully human and fully divine. This way of thinking about Jesus is familiar to everyone in the West because it has given us both our historical faith and many of our problems. According to Kaufman, trajectoryx is really a conceptual development, a series of changes in how we thought about Jesus.11 The result is that we may (but need not) employ this conceptual development to provide ourselves with a "sense" for the "name" Jesus. It is not really a historical person we understand on trajectoryi, it is a way of grasping the name. Its relation to any actual person is an empirical question to be entrusted to historians. Kaufman trusts historians and believes they produce knowledge plausible to his astronauts. But this conceptual way of appropriating the Jesus symbol is not the hero we now need, in Kaufman's view, and indeed, to continue to think of Jesus in this way causes far more problems than it solves. The second trajectory, which Kaufman is at pains to describe in this book, presents a different kind of hero. The second trajectory includes the first, in a sense, but instead of treating the concepts as ontological truths, trajectory2 sees the making of such claims as instances of creative activity on the part of Jesus' followers. As Kaufman states, "Since in this case we are not working with an anthropomorphic or anthropocentric conception of God as a conscious deliberative agent, but instead with an understanding of God as the mystery of creativity manifest throughout the cosmos, there is no place in this christology for the trajectoryi explanations and interpretations."12 But this is not as prohibitive a stance as it may at first seem. Kaufman says very clearly that he is not claiming the content of the conceptual development in trajectoryi is false. We may leave open whether Jesus is or is not divine, whether he did or did not rise from the dead, whether he did or did not ascend into heaven. There is no compelling reason to deny such claims (although 11 Ibid., 16. 12 Ibid., 17.</page><page sequence="7">24 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy they seem to elude scientific or historical methods of verification), but their true importance lies in recognizing that those who were making such claims were doing something novel, and in such a way that, in successive stages, the historical movement could build upon the creative activity of those who had come before. The description of this second trajectory occupies the rest of the book, along with the integration of the trajectory with the idea of God as serendipitous creativity. The God idea constitutes the naturalistic aspect of Kaufman's theology, and the growth of the conception, while remaining always mysterious, remains plausible to Kaufman's astronauts by answering to the growth of human scientific understanding. There is no expectation with Kaufman that science will eventually answer every mystery, especially the mystery of creativity itself. The Jesus movement understood on trajectory2 supplies the historicist aspect of Kaufman's theology, along with the complementary production of contemporary knowledge by the social sciences. There is here no supposition that history can resolve all mysteries associated with the appearance of symbolic activity and its accompanying norms and practices, especially those which develop on a scale comparable to the Jesus movement. Kaufman is clear, however, that one of the most important creations of symbol systems and their growth in history is freedom.13 Different cultures with different historical movements create different norms, and there is no reducing these to some transcendental principle, but all symbol systems free those who create them, making decisions and actions normatively meaningful. There is room for comparison, but the pluralism of historically created symbolic norms is irreducible. In light of his pluralistic historicism, Kaufman proceeds to examine the major metaphors through which Jesus has been appropriated as suffering servant, as intercessor for the poor, outcast and dispossessed, as teacher and exemplar of agape-love, as incarnate creative principle, and so forth. The synthesis attempted along the way is to situate historical creativity, as it emerges from symbol systems (creativity3 in the first book) within the larger framework of biohistory or evolution (creativity2) and cosmic creativity (creativityi). This is the major effort of Kaufman's third chapter. Thus, the historical trajectories set out in this new work are examples and illustrations of the nested 13 Ibid., 29, 33.</page><page sequence="8">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 25 dependencies of the three types of creativity. Kaufman allows that Jesus is a unique historical individual, but so is every other person. The importance of the Christian tradition comes down to this, for Kaufman: [T]he emergence of Jesus [as an historical individual] reveals nothing particularly unique. However, the image/story of Jesus is unique in certain very important respects . . . and this uniqueness must itself be regarded as a manifestation of the creativity on planet Earth (as is every instance of earthly uniqueness). If one believes that the image/story of Jesus presents a kind of definitive picture of what is normative for humans a sense of what human life at its best is all about, a sense of how we ought to live, for what goals we should strive, what is a truly good human life and human community the distinctiveness of precisely these norms grounded in this story may quite properly be understood as a unique expression of creativity (God). In this respect, thus, this particular image/story reveals something about God (creativity) that we humans otherwise would not know: the divine creativity is involved in the creation of norms by means of which humans can (should?) order their lives.14 Insofar as Kaufman is willing to toss a bone for traditional believers to gnaw upon, this is it: Jesus is sort of a revelation of God's activity, to anyone who chooses to look for its normative meaning and take that meaning to heart. Creativity also creates norms, which are meaningful and important for us, and that is as "abundant" as grace plausibly gets, for Kaufman. Cold comfort is not the complete absence of comfort, after all. In his final chapter, Kaufman does his best to convince his astronauts that the on-going promise of creativity in the midst of all this austerity and minimalism is "good news," and for his astronauts it may indeed be space is, after all, a cold and forbidding place, so even a hint of light or heat is surely welcome. Back on earth, where people are more selfishly hopeful, where they think less clearly than Kaufman, where they are less willing to give over their core existential modalities 14 Ibid., 51.</page><page sequence="9">26 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy to whatever history and science regard as plausible, Kaufman's "good news" will not be received as glad tidings of great joy. IV. Critique It will not be appropriate to attempt to undo any of what Kaufman has done. There surely is an audience for this way of thinking, and they surely need this book and its viewpoint to hold them within the faith community of Christians. But it is possible to question the wisdom of Kaufman's outlook without becoming either superstitious or reductionist. I have no complaint with Kaufman's neutralization of the claims of trajectoryi. It is indeed progress to supplant the conceptual development of the church tradition (and its presumption of authority and metaphysical necessity) with a more informed historical perspective. Yet, while it may not be evident because Jesus and Creativity is so well argued and so beautifully written, Kaufman faced a strategic choice and made a very important decision. Confronted with a choice between attempting to remold religion according to the standards of scientific and historical plausibility, and attempting to remold science and history according to the standards of religious plausibility, Kaufman chose the former. The principal move entailed in this decision is to render religion impersonal, so as to satisfy the objective sensibilities and demands of scientific and historical inquiry. This is not positivism at all, but I think it does make serious concessions to scientism. The option of personalizing and humanizing science and history is set aside by Kaufman and not even seriously considered. In doing this, Kaufman genuflects to the God (Idol?) of objectivity, even if he does not quite direct his prayers to it. I think Kaufman is quite right to suspect that science is not only the most pervasively accepted arbiter of plausibility in modern consciousness, and is likely to remain so for a very long time to come; but whether the faith community should adjust itself to that fact or attempt to counter-balance it with a kind of personalism that defends the legitimacy of inner experience is a more difficult and controversial decision. I believe Kaufman has made the wrong decision, even on his own terms. Let me address this by showing what I believe is a fundamental fault-line in Kaufman's thinking.</page><page sequence="10">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 27 One consistent weakness I find in Kaufman's case, here and elsewhere, is his constant conflation of the idea of the "human" with that of the "personal." Here is a typical instance: In the early Christian movement Jesus was understood in a number of quite different ways .... All of these, however, were expressed and formulated in what today we must regard as anthropomorphic (humanlike) ideas of God and the relation of God to humans. In this book (as well as in other writings of mine) these anthropomorphic ideas are displaced by the understanding of God as simply creativity (instead of a humanlike person thought of as The Creator).15 Kaufman thinks that we have usually created our ideas of God by generalizing or abstracting and projecting our own form of existence or experience. Thus, to think of God as personal is, for Kaufman, the same as thinking of God anthropomorphically, while to imagine God cares about human affairs, activities, and sufferings is an egocentric exaggeration of our place in the order of things, that is, anthropocentrism. There is no doubt that many, even most, Christians have proceeded just as Kaufman assumes, and this anthropomorphism is indeed a crude and backward way of thinking about God and the cosmos. What does not seem to occur to Kaufman is that there can be a difference between anthropomorphic ways of thinking, which egocentrically generalize our finite experience Godwards, and a form of hypothetical ontology which asks why there are personal beings in the universe at all. Given that personal beings do exist, such as ourselves, do we get better theology and philosophy by supposing an impersonal universe and then treating the appearance of personal beings as an inexplicable mystery (which is Kaufman's view)? Would we not get better theology and philosophy by supposing that the universe is from the start so organized as to be compatible with personal existence, and then to ask what makes a universe that is at least possibly personal actually so (at least in the case of our own experience)? It is hardly anthropocentric to notice that personal beings do exist, and to consider 15 Ibid., 6; cf. 15.</page><page sequence="11">28 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy the universe in light of their actuality. The most empirically sound procedure is to suppose that God, if there is one, has a mode of existing that is at least compatible with personal existence, and in fact actually personal in at least some ways, namely those ways which are compatible with our existence. A wholly impersonal God, one that has no trace of personal existing, is a vicious abstraction. Even Kaufman's "creativity" is at least proto-personal, and once we exist, actually personal in part. There is personality in the universe, and it is compatible with what creativity has always been doing. To put this in more traditional language, we suppose that God experiences something (even if that "something" may be without form and void). This is not anthropomorphism, this is just self-consistent ontology. Experience exists certainly in our own case, and therefore it exists in the universe. To suppose we are the only experiencing beings is exceptionalist and arrogant it is anthropocentric, not to mention unempirical. The resultant principle is: do not from the outset render utterly mysterious what is patently required in one's ontological scheme, in this case, that personal experience exists. To violate this principle, as Kaufman does, requires one continually to appeal to mystery itself as an excuse for discontinuities, or in this case, actual fault-lines in one's ontology. Human existing is just one example of personal existing. We do not need God or angels or extra-terrestrials or the immortality of the soul to show that the personal mode of existing is not limited to the human type plenty of animals exist in the personal mode, which is to say they have self-experience, some self-consciousness, some awareness of their own finitude, and meaningful sociality with others whose personal modalities are both like and unlike their own. Dogs, horses, chimps, dolphins, and elephants all exist in the personal mode and clearly communicate with humans. Not only is there experience here, which is to say, broadly, that there is an intentional structure of activity (whether that is understood as consciousness or willing or caring, or planning, or any other meaningful activity), but also personal experience, intersubjectivity, mutual encounterings of the other, and resultant development of each. Anyone who denies that this occurs is simply refusing to consider the evidence. Thus, there is personal existence that is non-human in form. If there is a God, that God admittedly may or may not exist in the personal mode. We simply do not know. We can choose between a concept like</page><page sequence="12">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 29 Kaufman's which excludes a priori the personal mode as applied to God (because it is not plausible to science or history, as we currently conceive of them), or we can remain open to the idea that God's mode of existence is either possibly personal or actually personal, in part or in whole. Kaufman is not open to that latter idea, an idea that sees the existence of personal beings in the universe as an instance of and evidence for God's creative genius. Here is an open version of the imago Dei, which claims not that only humans are made in God's image and after God's likeness, but that wherever we find the personal mode of existence, we find evidence of God's creative genius, and reason to think of ourselves as in a communicative relation with the divine (granting that other non-human personal beings are communicative with the divine as well, and leaving open whether aspects of existence that do not experience in the personal mode may still have a communication with the divine that we do not grasp). In light of such communicative interchange (to use Wieman's phrase), does it make more sense to allow that God is at least personal to the extent that communication occurs between God and the results of creative advance, or to suppose that God is impersonal? The latter seems to render communication among localized individuals more than mysterious; it is miraculous, for unless the universe is so structured as to support intentional activities of beings existing in the personal mode (that is, unless the universe is intentional in form), then apparently we are obliged mutually to create not only the actual communicative meanings we exchange in every instance, but also the forms and existential conditions which render them possible. This is not how things really happen. Communication may involve mystery, but it is not a miracle, and we are not obliged to create its forms and very possibility ex nihilo in every instance. Rather, in communicating, intending, willing, desiring, hoping, loving and believing, we exercise and instantiate activities the universe already supports, for even if it is too much to claim that the universe is intentionally structured, it is not too ambitious to note that the universe seems not only susceptible of creating intentional relations, but somewhat compliant in the development of them. One cannot say that the universe is hostile to communicative or intentional inter-relation, and to this same extent, the universe is also not hostile to the personal mode of existing. Kaufman's impersonal God creates neither by love, nor design, nor intelligence of any kind. This God just creates serendipitously,</page><page sequence="13">30 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy makes new stuff, and in all that flurry of fortuitous undirected activity, for a brief time, a few personal beings get luckily cranked out, and will be gone at some point in the not too distant future. Serendipity as a concept is certainly to be praised for its preservation of contingency, freedom, chance, growth, and many other values that are central to our contemporary self-understanding, but it is no replacement for providence. Embracing impersonal serendipitous creativity seems not only like a nihilistic outlook, it is also requires an implausible ontology. By the latter I mean that any ontology requiring me to accept fundamental breaks and discontinuities in the cosmos, such as the mysteries that obtain between creativity 1, 2, and 3, is less defensible than an ontology that can explain the same creative activity without unnecessary and mysterious violations of continuity. Thus, the assertion that God is definitely an impersonal being is indefensible. It is not knowable if true, and it renders our own form of experiencing and that of other personal beings not only mysterious, but miraculous, a complete exception to the natural order. How an impersonal God can serendipitously create personal beings I cannot begin to understand, but I can understand how a God who is possibly or actually personal in the divine mode of existence can, through creative and communicative action, raise biological beings into personal experiencing. Whether there is any God, or a God who has lifted biological beings toward personal experiencing, I simply do not know but neither does Kaufman. I can also grasp how a personal being can create impersonal or relatively uncommunicative existences, since we create them ourselves all the time. So what is more plausible: that something utterly impersonal serendipitously created personal beings, or that some at least potentially personal being became conscious either through us or of us? Kaufman's assumption that all our ideas about God must be generalizations from the forms of our own experience may be true, but it would be just as true of impersonalist ideas about God as of personalist ones. There is nothing less anthropocentric about taking science and history as models of knowing the universe than taking religious tradition. Science and history are as much human inventions as religion is. In all cases we generalize our own form of knowing and experiencing to a wider cosmos. I think we can avoid crude anthropomorphism and generalize our own forms of experience without supposing that God must be impersonal, and indeed, it is far more</page><page sequence="14">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 31 plausible to suppose God might be personal without asserting God must be personal. One reason is this: Our best models of the workings of creativity are not, in the first instance, models of purely natural processes; rather, they are personal and aesthetic models. We do not understand our own creativity very well, but we tend to grasp nature's creativity by analogy to our own (as Kant argued in the Critique of Judgment, section 59). To describe nature as "creative," as Kaufman does, is no less grounded in a generalization of our own form of experience than to describe God as "personal." In either case we begin with our own experience and project. The question is which should we generalize: our personal or our impersonal modes of creativity? Here the answer is clear, because the impersonal modes of creativity in human experience are derivative of the personal modes. Science is a symbolic form of human culture (Kaufman says this explicitly), an expression of human creativity. One of the things science created was the idea of an impersonal universe. Religion is also a symbolic form of human culture, an expression of human creativity. One of the things it created was the idea of a personal God. The scientific form of creativity gave us Auschwitz. The religious form of creativity gave us the 30 Years War. We should obviously be careful with what we create. From neither form of culture does it follow that there is or is not a God, nor does it follow whether we should or should not conceive of God as personal or impersonal. We are discussing not what exists, in itself, but how it would be better for us to think about what does exist in our experience. Some may argue, as Kaufman does, that we are better off thinking of the universe in impersonal terms. As I have pointed out, this does not really avoid anthropomorphism or a crypto-anthropocentrism; the move still relies upon the generalization of our own mode of experience. Rather, Kaufman's move masks the anthropomorphism upon which it rests: that (impersonal) science is a human creation. To accept science (whether natural or social) as the arbiter of plausibility is, first, to generalize something peculiar to human experience (scientific knowing), and then negate its source (ourselves), and finally pretend it measures something more than our human values. This is a more dangerous generalization than the one involved in simply accepting that the universe allows the existence of the personal mode, and the personal mode of existing contains both objective and</page><page sequence="15">32 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy subjective aspects (there is a subjectivity of science just as surely as there is an objectivity of religious experience). If crude and simplistic anthropocentrism is to be avoided (and it should be), it is probably better to bring it out into the light of day and stand ready to defend the extent to which one has generalized the form of human experience in conceiving of God than to cover it in a veneer of scientific objectivity. Here it makes sense to distinguish between the human mode and the personal mode, the latter of which takes in human and other-than-human creatures. Whenever we speak of God in ways that limit God's modes of being and creating to those exclusively comprehensible by humans (recalling that yielding to scientific and historical plausibility excludes whatever may inform animal experience, for example), we are being anthropomorphic. When we speak of God in ways that can include the ways in which other intelligent life experiences, we mitigate our anthropomorphism (without necessarily eliminating it the description remains our own, after all). With the Jesus book, Kaufman supplements in the social scientific style of discourse what he had insisted upon in his previous book using the natural scientific discourse. We are to adopt a broad naturalism within which emerges a historical series of events, both equally impersonal. The Jesus movement is not the plan of any one person, and no person could have foreseen its outcomes, or could have with any amount of effort brought its historical symbolic meaning into existence. For Kaufman this is the case with all histories they are serendipitous creations, but in this case we look to human beings as the principal actors. Their actions may have, and in the case of the Jesus movement, do have consequences that were neither intended nor foreseeable. Even if the consequences had been magically foreseen, there is no reason to think that any of the principal actors would have chosen or approved of them. The Jesus movement is an impersonal historical snowball rolling down the hill of time, but far less predictable in its course than any snowball. In this way Kaufman supplements the broad picture of God as creativity he has been defending since about 1993. Needless to say, Kaufman's Jesus is not exactly our savior, our mediator, our help in time of need; but Kaufman's Jesus can be our teacher, our normative exemplar, and a source of assurance that human life can be lived well. This is small consolation for those who think they need a savior, however. It is not terribly kind to tell a soul in search of redemption that she or he needs to redefine salvation so as to find it in</page><page sequence="16">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 33 Kaufman's Jesus. Yet, I concede that Kaufman's Jesus is Jesus as sober history can present him, if also something less than Christ. Perhaps Kaufman will now realize that he really needs a book on the Holy Spirit to complete his thinking, and will be inclined to identify it with the mystery that links creativity2 to creativityi. After all, we need a mediator between the unfolding of the cosmos and the appearance of life within it, just as surely as we need a mediator between the unfolding of life and the appearance of historical meaning. If Kaufman does write a book on Spirit and Creativity, I am confident that spirit will turn out to be an impersonal force that contemporary, liberal humans, ones who like science, will find "plausible," and that Kaufman's Holy Spirit will not be much of a paraclete. The weakness in Kaufman's approach, in my view, is that it yields too much to science while neglecting everything which makes science a desirable model for knowing, that is, the high valuation science has received from a thoroughly personal mode of activity (human creativity). Science is a relative newcomer to human culture, and it is natural that we should be enamored of our newest creation, but we were personal beings before we had science, and before we had religion, and other, non-human, personal beings currently exist which have neither science nor religion. Solid ontology cannot safely ignore that fact. It is not the case that symbolic forms of culture, such as religion and science and history, make persons; rather, persons make symbols by actively communicating. Is God a personal being? I certainly do not know. But Jesus was. Those who created his movement were. So why place the movement before the persons? I do know this: Kaufman does not know that God is not or cannot be a personal being, and if he finds it "implausible" to suppose that God is a personal being, that seems strangely subjective and an expression of temperament, the sort of thing only a personal being would be able to do.16 Thanks to Robert Neville for helpful comments on the first draft of this article.</page></plain_text>
