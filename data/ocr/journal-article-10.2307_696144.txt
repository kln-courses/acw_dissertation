<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Classical Review DECEMBER 1908 ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS THE CONNECTION OF THE AEGAEAN CIVILIZATION WITH CENTRAL EUROPE. IN recent years considerable attention has been drawn to a supposed connection between the early civilization of Crete and the Aegaean and that of Central Europe.' Two rival theoties hold the field. The first, propounded by Dr. Hubert Schmidt 2 of Ber- lin, and supported by Professor von Stern3 of Odessa, suggests that all the early culture of the Balkan and Aegaean area is derived from Central Europe. The second, which was first put forward by Dr. Wosinsky,4 is the exact converse, namely, that the Aegaean culture gradually spread northwards over Central Europe. The whole area dealt with by these theories is enormous, extending from Crete to Northern Bohemia, and from Yortan in Western Asia Minor to Olympia and Leucas. The idea that underlies all these theories arises from a desire to unify the civilizations of the whole of this area. It is natural that the Aegaean by itself should form one connected area, because the mere fact that it is a sea has always made com- munication very easy from the earliest times. The ease of this communication by sea is emphasized by the fact that the last phase of the Third Late Minoan period extends from Cyprus to Torcello, Sicily and Marseilles.5 On the other hand, the mountainous nature of the Balkan peninsula and the regions immediately adjoining it to the North, must have made trade and travel exceedingly diffi- cult, and in some cases almost impossible. Even to-day the traveller from Vienna to Can. dia goes by sea from Trieste, since no overland route down the Balkan peninsula exists. In the Aegaean, however, communications from island to island and from coast to coast are very easy. It is far easier to go from Nauplia to Calymnos by sailing boat than to ride from Salonika to Jannina. Consequently, if communication is so difficult to-day over- land, it must naturally have been much more so at the dawn of civilization. Further, at no historical period, except under Trajan or in the great period of the Ottoman Empire, has the whole region in question been dominated by one people. Never since history began has it been inhabited by one race, speaking the same tongue, and possessing the culture. To-day the quarrels and rivalries of the various Balkan nations are a danger to the peace of Europe.

Consequently, we have an a priori argument against a hypothetical unity throughout this vast area in early times. The two theories mentioned depend mainly on conclusions drawn from the style and decoration of the painted and incised pottery which has been found sporadically through- out this region. In many cases these ideas of unity have originated in the false axiom that the spiral and the meander types of decoration so common in almost every part of this area were first developed in one par- ticular place only. The mere fact that such authorities as Dr. Schmidt and Dr. Wosinsky can hold widely divergent views about the position of that one place is a strong point against a single source. Whosoever assumes that the whole of this vast culture radiated from one centre must be able to show that at that centre the early pottery series developed without any break whatsoever. Dr. Schmidt holds that, while this unbroken series cannot be found in Crete, it can be found in Central Europe and at Troy. He asserts that in order to pass from white incised ware to painted pottery, we must have a type of ware in which the designs are in matt white paint on the black polished ground on which the incisions were formerly made. Such a step, he asserts, is missing at Cnossos; on the other hand, he finds it at Troy and in Tran- sylvania. Unfortunately for his hypothesis, this ware is not missing at Cnossos, as Dr. Mackenzie has told us.1 In the later Neo- lithic strata there is a considerable proportion of matt white decoration on a polished ground, and not until the Early Minoan period does a dull black ground make its first appearance. On the contrary, the Trojan sherds with matt white decoration on the polished ground, to which Dr. Schmidt points to support his theory, are only three or four in number. Even this theory assumes that Troy can be included in the Central European culture, which still remains to be proved. The rival theory of Dr. Wosinsky supposes that the white incised ware found through- out this region had one common source, the Aegaean, and belongs all to a single context. That this is too bold an assumption is shown by the fact that white-filled incised ware occurs in Egypt from pre-dynastic down to Roman times. Also in Crete incised ware reappears in the Third Early Minoan period.2 In Southern Italy and Sicily ~ white-filled incised ware occurs in two different periods, the neolithic and the bronze ages, between which there is no direct connection. Further, it must be remembered that the painted fabrics of Bessarabia, Podolia and Galicia, in which the spiral element is pro- minent, were apparently produced by a neolithic race.4 Thus we are asked to believe that though they imitated the bronze-using Aegaean people in such a purely artistic point as vase-decoration, they never imitated them on the practical side by substituting bronze for stone implements. Why also should they have borrowed patterns merely, and not the potter's wheel as well ? 5 As we have already indicated, the use of spirals as a decorative motive is universal. Professor Ridgeway has long ago pointed out that it occurs in New Zealand, a country that no one would dream of including in the sphere of Aegaean culture.6 Finally at Zerelia in Thessaly,7 where im- ported Mycenaean ware (contemporary with the Third Late Minoan period) has been found at the same place as painted neolithic ware, it is to be noted that the Mycenaean pot- tery is found only in the last and topmost of the eight settlements. On the other hand, the painted ware, with which no single sherd of earlier Mycenaean pottery has yet been found lasts from the first to the sixth settlement. So here it seems clear that the neolithic people had no connection with the Aegaean. I We have to thank Dr. Mackenzie for his great kindness in discussing with us several of the points dealt with in this paper. 2 See the cases in the Ashmolean Museum. 3 Bullettino di Paletnologia Italiana, xvi. pp. 177 ff.; xxix. pp. 91 ff. 4 Chvojka, Stone Age on the Dn:pr (in Russian); Trans.

CRETE AND THE AEGAEAN. At sites such as Cnossos we have a con- tinuous development of pottery from the earliest neolithic times to the eleventh and tenth centuries B.C.1 A parallel development the East, to Sicily and Marseilles in the West.3 Actual traces of Cretan trade in Middle Minoan times have been found only since they are easily accessible in Dr. Evans' reports on Knossos, in those of Bosanquet and Dawkins on Palaikastro in the Annual of the British School at Athens, vol. vi. sqq., and in those of Dr. Halbherr and his collaborators in Monuminti Antichi, 1902, vol. xii.; 1905, vol. xiv.

It must be remarked that the obsidian trade from Melos is a thing apart.' Although obsidian was exported, for instance, from Melos to Zerelia in Thessaly from the earliest times, no Cycladic vases were exported with it. Simi- lar phenomena occur at Matera in Southern Italy. Thus we see that in Thessaly and South Italy the early neolithic folk depended on their Aegaean neighbours for obsidian,2 but did not import artistic motives with it. Finally, the well-known Mycenaean terra- cotta statuettes have no likeness to any of those from the north (Fig. i). NORTH GREECE. This district may be said to extend from Chaeronaea to Thessaly, and perhaps as far west as Leucas.3 Here there is found what seems to be an entirely different civiliza- tion from that of the Aegaean proper. We have a hand-made ware decorated with patterns in red on a white ground from Northern Boeotia, the Spercheius valley, and Thessaly; two kinds of incised ware from Leucas and Olympia, and from Thes- saly; and in addition the so-called Dhimini ware with its combination of spiral and geometric elements. Finally, as said above, there is the Late Minoan (III.) pottery from Zerelia and the Iolcus district. Among the painted pottery from the earlier settlements at Zerelia there is not only no single fragment of Early or Middle Minoan ware from Crete, or anything else Aegaean (a fact which in itself would prove little), but there is further no sign of the adoption by the native potters of any Aegaean decorative motives. The North Greek wares always seem to be found in a neolithic environment, whereas if deco- rative patterns from Minoan pottery had been adopted, we should have expected to find bronze also, which was already in use in the South.4 THRACE. The early pottery from this region includes both incised and painted wares.6 The deco- ration sometimes shows a combination of spiral and geometric elements that recalls the Dhimini ware. We have as yet no direct clue as to its chronological relationship to the Aegaean culture. In other words, one cannot express the age of this ware in the Minoan terminology. In any case, it seems to belong to a neolithic period. The terra- cottas (Fig. 4) from this region, though they resemble those from Thessaly, have little like- ness to Aegaean or Servian finds.6 TROY AND WESTERN ASIA MINOR. As said above, the sixth city at Troy 7 belongs to the end of the late Mycenaean period, but the first five cities have not produced a single sherd of any earlier ware that can be attributed to the Aegaean. Nor should we compare Troy I. and II. too closely with the Cycladic culture, since there are many vital differences, and but few simi- larities. For example, at Troy the 'frying-pan' and large marble vases do not exist, and the Trojan anthropomorphic vases do not occur in the Cyclades. The so-called owl-like idols do not resemble the long-headed Aegaean marble statuettes, although fiddle-shaped idols occur both at Troy and in the Cyclades. Also the technique of the vases is distinct, At Troy the usual ware is red, and in the Cyclades grey brown. 'The pottery from Yortan 8 and Boz Eyuk,9 which is considered to be parallel with the earlier cities at Troy, 1 Phylakopi, chapter viii. (Bosanquet). 2Although Melos is the sole Aegaean source, obsi- dian is found in Tokay, the Caucasus, and Russian Armenia, whence it may have reached Central Europe. Consequently we cannot be sure how much of the obsidian found outside the Aegaean area is of Aegaean origin. Although a ship would carry Melian vases as well as obsidian, on a difficult overland route every- thing fragile, such as vases, would be left behind, and only the easily portable and unbreakable obsidian carried up country. 3Ath.

Conse- quently it seems that Troy should be connected with an Anatolian culture rather than with a European, though it is always possible that ware similar to the Trojan may be found in Eastern Thrace; in fact, some of the vases from Thrace already referred to show similar shapes to the Trojan. Also some of Trojan terra-cottas are very like one of the Thessalian types (Figs. 2, 3). SERVIA AND BOSNIA. The pottery found in these countries at Jablanica, Debelo Brdo, Vinia, Butmir, and Zuto Brdo, has very little affinity with any of the wares referred to above.' Its ornament is nearly always rendered by incisions, and the only painted ware found shows designs of a very simple geometric type, carried out in black on grey. The incised ware has no resemblance whatsoever to the Cretan, and Dr. Vasid, for instance, dates that from 2uto Brdo as late as the first quarter of the first millennium B.C. Also the terra-cotta statu- ettes from the same sites, including the famous one from Klidevac,2 have no likeness to any yet found in Thessaly or the Aegaean area (Fig. 5). GALICIA, BUKOWINA, PODOLIA AND BESSARABIA. The beautiful and artistic painted vases found in all four of these provinces seem to form a single group in technique, ornament and form, with slight local differences.3 They have, however, no resemblance to the Servian and Bosnian pottery. The only analogies are perhaps to be found in the incised ware, but here again patterns and shapes differ. The terra-cotta statuettes (Fig. 6), too, present no likeness to those from Servia.4 The pottery is, as a rule, covered with a red-brown varnish or slip; on this elegant spiral patterns are painted in black-brown. A triangle always occurs at the points where two or more spirals meet. Some vases have handles in the form of the heads of animals, such as cows. There is apparently no close connection between this ware and that from Servia or any more southerly district, such as Thessaly. HUNGARY. The painted pottery of Transylvania, for instance from Tordos,5 probably comes into the same context as that from Bessarabia, but till full publication renders it accessible we must suspend judgment. The incrusted ware, for instance that of Lengyel, seems to be a unique and isolated fabric, occurring, as far as we know at present, only in Hungary." BOHEMIA. The pottery from this region,7 which is all incised, is connected with that of Southern Germany, and, apart from the use of spirals as a decorative element, has no affinity with any Aegaean ware. Its patterns have no resemblance to those of the painted ware from the Bessarabian region. Nor can it be brought into relationship with the Hungarian incrusted ware. It is hard to see how it could have penetrated further south to the Aegaean, since there is no trace of it in Servia, Troy, or Thessaly. Our brief survey of the sporadic finds in the Balkan and in the Aegaean area is com- plete so far as our knowledge extends at present. It will at once be noted that large tracts of country still remain to be explored; Epirus, Montenegro, Macedonia,8 Roumania,9 1 For the Bosnian finds see Hoernes, Neolitiscke Keramik in Oesterreick (Jahrb. d.

We would submit that there is a strong case against any attempt to unify the early pottery of the Central European, Balkan and Aegaean areas, and that these attempts have been based on general resemblances of decorative types much too superficial to carry conviction. For instance, a glance at the terra-cotta statuettes (Figs. 1-6) here illustrated from different parts of the area under discussion, shows at once how great are the differences. These statuettes, which are typical of various districts of the area, indicate how much the primitive populations of those districts differed in their conceptions of plastic. We have no wish to set up any rival theory, and, in treat- ing the whole region by sections, have no idea of dividing it into as many separate cultures, since as yet we know too little. Dr. Hoernes's suggestion that the differences we have discussed are due to the parallel develop- ment of various tribes of the same race, appears at least more reasonable than the unifying theories. It will be noticed that in the different districts into which we have divided the whole region, there is no clearly marked connection between any two. Such connection may of course exist, but no proof of it has yet been discovered. Far less is there any archaeological evidence to prove that the culture of the whole area as seen in the pottery is indivisible, and derived from a single source, whether in Central Europe or in the Aegaean.1 T.
