<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Introduction to the Study of Prehistoric Art. By Ernest A. Parkyn, M.A. [Pp. xviii + 349, with 16 plates and 318 illustrations in the text.] (London : Longmans, Green &amp; Co. Price 10 s. 6 d. net.) This is an excellent work, and supplies a want, for there exists no other adequate and up-to-date treatise dealing with prehistoric art in general. Three chapters are given up to the wonderful work of paleolithic artists, one chapter to the Neolithic period, and the ten remaining chapters-constituting, however, only half the book - to the artistic products of the prehistoric Metal Ages. The illustrations</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 697 are of necessity one of the chief features of the book, and these are well selected and admirably produced. To many persons the paleolithic art proves most fascinating, and the high degree of merit attained in those very ancient times is now well known. Mr. Parkyn records thirty-five different animals as represented in Paleolithic Art, and the list is of interest to paleontologists not only for what it includes, but by reason of the omissions. The most notable absentee is the hippopotamus, a beast which would certainly have been included if he had been known to the savage artists ; and there are no monkeys, although one anthropomorphic figure on the wall of the Spanish cave &lt;ł Homos de la Pěna " is provided with a tail, a decoration which may or may not have been suggested by the presence in that region of our quadrumanous cousins. The animals depicted, and the conspicuous animals omitted, may eventually assist us in correlating the pictures and the three paleo- lithic ages in which they were drawn - namely, the Aurignacian, the Solutréan, and the Magdalenian, - with the later glacial and inter-glacial periods. There are, for instance, two mysterious drawings of elephants which Mr. Parkyn thinks are clearly not intended to represent the mammoth. What, then, is this brute ? No tusks can be seen, and the animals bear a resemblance to the female of the existing Indian elephant ; but is it possible that the originals were representatives of Eiephas antiquusi If this be the case, the sketches must have been drawn in pre- Würmian times. We may call attention to a few slips in this part of the book. The bird called a " penguin " is not the real penguin, but the Great Auk. The term " Reindeer Period " is not usually applied to the Aurignacian, Solutréan, and Magdalenian ages collectively, but to the Magdalenian age only. The reindeer is not by any means characteristic of the Aurignacian, the fauna of that time indicating a much warmer climate than that of the Magdalenian. The remainder of the book is on an equally high level with the chapters on Paleolithic Art, and the section dealing with the working of gold in the Bronze Age is particularly informing. Gold was one of the earliest metals to be worked, and much of it came from Ireland. The famous Late Keltic art is also well described ; sword-sheaths, shields, mirrors, fibulae, pottery, and many other objects being considered and illustrated. One of the very finest specimens of the art of the Early Iron Age is the famous bronze mirror found near Birdlip in Gloucester- shire. Mr. Parkyn gives a good description of this, but he makes one rather important mistake. He says that the mirror was found in a grave " at the foot of the Cotteswold Hills." The grave was, on the contrary, on one of the very highest points of the Cotteswolds, the village of Birdlip being nearly 1,000 ft. above sea-level. The mistake is excusable, because the original description by John Bellows is somewhat ambiguous to any one not familiar with the district. As is well known to archeologists in the West of England, nearly all the prehistoric remains in Gloucestershire are found on high ground, the Severn Vale no doubt being at that time very marshy and almost uninhabitable ; and the Birdlip find was no exception to the rule. The mirror and other specimens found with it arc now in the Gloucester Museum. A. G. Thacker.</page></plain_text>
