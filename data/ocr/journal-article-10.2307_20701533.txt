<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON MAORI MYTHOLOGY. By Elsdon Best. The Origin and Personification of the Heavenly Bodies, &amp;c. IN studying the mythology of the Maori race, we cannot but be struck by the general personification or allegorization of natural phenomena, the heavenly bodies, fire, mountains, &amp;c, which obtains in that ancient but unwritten collection of old time lore. As a mythopoetic people, the Maori can assuredly claim to rank with any nation, ancient or modern, of whose system of mythology we have any knowledge. The collection and perusal of divers fragments of ancient history, mythology and folk lore, has led to the extraction from such matter of the following notes on the above subject, which notes, albeit some what crudely arranged, may be of some interest to students of Com parative Mythology. It has been frequently stated that the Maori has no conception of abstract ideas or metaphysical reasoning, that he is utterly incapable of philosophical speculation, that his mental abilities are conspicuous chiefly by their absence. A study of Maori mythology and of their belief in the spiritual nature or essences of man, should tend to destroy the above belief, and at some future time we will endeavour to assist in such destruction. The esoteric knowledge of the Maori tohunga (priest, wise man), has not yet been treated of at any length. The mystic rites and occult sciences, by means of which the priests of yore obtained such an ascendancy over the tribe, are matters of great interest, and, although much is for ever lost, yet is there also much which might yet be placed on record and thus preserved. The 8</page><page sequence="2">94 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. Maori system of ethics may not have been of a high standard, yet the strange rite known as Ka-m,ahunu was the token of a striving or seeking for some higher or better power than brute force, in order to preserve moral discipline in the tribe. The neolithic Maori has for centuries been groping his way in the subjective world in order to gain some knowledge of the mystery of life, of natural phenomena, of the origin of things. Throughout the realms of psychology, psychomancy, oneirology, ontology, eschatology and other dimly lighted regions, we find the faint trails of his pro gress. Faint indeed are many of those trails, and overgrown by the weeds of ignorance and superstition, yet is it well to know that he has trod them, although the gloom remained unpierced by any searchlight of Western knowledge. We will now proceed to speak of the personification of the heavenly bodies, of the seasons, of trees, of stones, of fire, of food, of wind, &amp;c. Also of the heavenly bodies, wind, mountain, &amp;c, as being endowed with the powers of speech, of locomotion and of generation. And of the origin of man from Mother Earth, together with other singular beliefs of the old time Maori. Maori Cosmogony and Anthropogeny. According to the ancient Maori belief, Bangi and Papa, or Heaven and Earth, as well as man, the heavenly bodies, trees, stones, water, and many other organic and inorganic bodies, are all descended from primal Chaos, which obtained long before man was and before the genesis of the Maori Cosmos. The origin of the Earth and Sky, of the stars, of man, &amp;c, as given by the Mata-atua tribes of the Bay of Plenty district of New Zealand, is preserved in the form of a genealogical table, which would appear to have been evolved by a forest dwelling people in the remote past, inasmuch as several of the names have been taken from the parts and growth of trees, as will be seen in the accompanying table. In this table we perceive how the growth of the universe has been likened to the growth of a tree. It is by no means safe to assume that this is an outcome of tree worship, but rather the respect in which the more valuable trees were held by the Maori is the result of the belief that they are of celestial origin, the children of Tane, the son of Heaven and Earth. In explanation of the first ten names in the table*, we quote the words of H. T. Pio, an aged and learned member of the Ngati-Awa tribe :?" Te Pu is the head of the tree. Te More is the root. Te * See Table No, 1 at the end.</page><page sequence="3">NOTES ON MAORI MYTHOLOGY. 95 Weu represents the rootlets. Te Aka the clinging vines. Te Rea means the growth of a tree. Te Wao-nui, the attainment of great size, the great tree or forest. Te Kune?arrived at maturity (kua tuketuke)?the matured forest of trees. Te Whe, the first sound, the creak of limbs as trees sway in the wind (whe = wheke). Te Kore, void, nothingness. Te Po represents Darkness, the primal Gloom before Light was." Born of the Void and Darkness were Rangi and Papa, or Heaven and Earth. These again brought forth Tane, Tangotango and Wai-nui, the last named being a female. Tane is the parent, origin, or tutelary deity of trees and forests and of birds. He is the guardian of forests, which are known as Te Wao tapu nui a Tane?the Great Sacred Forest of Tane. No valuable tree may be felled without performing the strange rites of the Ahi pu-rakau and the Tumu-whenua, and also repeating the sacred karakia (invocation) to Tane, that he may not resent (through his people, the forest elves) the destruction of one of his children. It is Tane that protects the forest and the birds thereof, and preserves the mauri (sacred life principle) of the forests. Should the mauri of a forest be desecrated by man, then assuredly that forest becomes tamaoatia?the sacred mauri is contaminated, and all bird denizens of such a forest will at once migrate to other lands. Tangotango is the origin or cause of alternate day and night. He changes day into night and night into day. Wai-nui is the origin or mother of water. The great ocean, the flowing rivers and lakes?these are the aria (form of incarnation) or kohiwitanga (visible form) of Wai-nui, mother of waters and she is the personification of those waters, as Tane is the personification of trees and birds. Tane took to wife Hine-rau-a-moa and begat Rongo-ma-Tane, who was the parent, origin or personification of the kumara (sweet potatoe) and of cultivation and the arts of peace ; and Hine-te-iwaiwa, the guardian of motherhood; and Tangaroa, the Polynesian Neptune, who stands in the same relation to the ocean and the fish thereof as does Tane to forests and birds. In very remote times, before the quarrels and separation of the grand-children of Rangi and Papa, Tangaroa was a land deity. The next child of Tane was Tu, the god of war, the personification of evil passions, of war. When Tu the Red Eyed turns his fierce visage upon mankind, then war parties are abroad and wailing and desolation and the fierce joy of slaughter fills the land. The next born was Tawhiri-matea, the deity of gales, the boisterous winds are personified in him. (Raka-maomao is the deity of ordinary winds, the personification of winds. Te Potiki a Raka maomao, the child of Raka-maomao, is a term for the south wind.) The next born of Tane and Hine was Ioio-whenua, and the last born</page><page sequence="4">96 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. was Pu-te-hue, the parent or personification of the hue or gourd. This Pu-te-hue (a female) married Tawhiri-matea and bore Makara, who married Rotua. Their progeny were Hine-nui-te-Po (Hine-nui-te-Po is said to be the wife of Tane), Mahu-ika and Hine-i-tapeka. This Hine-nui-te-Po is the Goddess of Oblivion or the shades and appears to be the personification of Death in the Mata-atua traditions. It was by entering the womb of the Goddess of the Dark World that Maui, the demon god, strove to make life eternal to man. The word of Maui was :?"Let death be brief, and as the moon dies and returns again to life, young and beautiful, so let man die and revive." But Hine of the Dark World said :?" Not so ! Let death be eternal. That wailing and lamentation may be heard throughout the world for all time." Mahu-ika and Hine-i-tapeka, sisters of Hine-nui-te-Po, are the origin and personification of fire. It was from Mahu-ika that Maui obtained fire for mankind, but so base was his ingratitude that he was pursued by the fire of Mahu-ika, which strove to destroy him. Near unto death was Maui at that time, but saved himself by his potent invocations, which caused rain to descend and extinguish that fire, the remains of which fled in dismay and took shelter with Tane, that is to say, with the forest trees. Even so we find the seeds of fire in many trees and it is from those trees that the Maori obtains fire. Most of the seeds of fire fled to Hine-kaikomako, the personified form of the kaikomako, a forest tree. Far and wide sought the sons of man for the lost fire, and at last it was revealed to them by Ira of old, who is said to have been the husband of Hine-kaikomako. Figures repre senting Ira and Hine were often carved on the kauahi (stick used for procuring fire). Fire is generally known as Te Ahi o Mahu-ika (the fire of Mahu ika) but the fire of Hine-i-tapeka, usually termed Te Ahi o Tapeka, is applied to the fire which burns in the under-world. The charred tree trunks imbeded in the vast pumice deposits of Kainga-roa and the surrounding districts, are said to have been thus carbonised by the Fire of Tapeka. Among many tribes Hine-nui-te-Po is said to have been the wife of Tane, having taken that name when she deserted Tane and descended to the under-world to fill the position of Goddess of Hades. Also those here given as the children of Tane are often shown as being the progeny of Rangi and Papa. On reference to the table No. 2, it will be seen that Tangotango and Wai-nui had issue?Te Ra (the Sun), Te Marama (the Moon), Nga Whetu (the Stars), Te Hinatore (Phosphorescent Light), Te Pari kiokio and Hine-rau-a-moa.</page><page sequence="5">NOTES ON MAORI MYTHOLOGY. 97 Te Ra?The Sun. There appears to be no trace of sun worship among the Maoris, rather was it an object to be belaboured and reviled, as in the case of Maui the sun snarer, who lay in wait at the edge of the world, and having caught the sun in strong rope nooses proceeded to admonish the same with a bludgeon for travelling too swiftly through the heavens. Having administered a severe clubbing and broken off many of the sun's rays, Maui the demi-god released his captive and since that time the sun has travelled much slower through space and hence we have longer days. In order to capture his solar enemy Maui repeated the Karakia, commencing with :? " Te Maui-mua, te Maui-roto, te Maui-pae, Maui-taha Ka notia, ka herea, ka whakamaua." Having caught the sun, he then repeated an incantation known as a Punga, to cause the sun to move slowly through its course :? Te punga, te Kahu-kura ata, te Kahu-kura tai, Hai kona ra koe, E te Ra ! Tu mai ai? Tu ki tupua, tu ki tawhito, tu ki maneanea. The above incantation was also used by travellers in the old Maori days, in order to cause the sun to move slowly, and thus enable them to complete a journey ere the shades of night fell. Thus Ngahoro, a grizzled old veteran of the Ngati-Mahanga tribe: " In my young days my father and others started on a journey to Taupo. They left Ahi-kereru pa at Te Whaiti in the early morning, marching by way of O-tu-kopeka, and arrived at Opepe on the evening of the second day. On the morning of the third day I left Ahi-kereru, and by the power of this karakia I overtook the travellers near Tapuae-haruru the same evening. Friend ! I think that it would be a good thing to write this in your book, that the White man may know what wondrous things were accomplished by the Maori in former times." We will now pass on to the domestic affairs of the sun and explain his marriage, an important episode in the history of that useful luminary :? Hine-takurua = Te Ra = Raumati I Tane-rore Hine-karoro Hine-tara Hine-tore Punga Te Haere-nui Noho-tumutumu Moe-tahuna Matuku Tu-te-wehiwehi Tu-te-wanawana - - -' (Parent, origin, or (Origin of (Origin of (Origin or parents of lizards, personification of parera, bittern.) insects, &amp;c.) the kawau, cor- duck.) morant.)</page><page sequence="6">98 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. Here we have Te Ra (the Sun) and the names of his two wives, Hine-takurua (takurua = winter) and Raumati (Summer). The two seasons, Summer and Winter, are personified or allegorized in the persons of Hine-takurua and Raumati, each of whom had her own functions to perform. In very old myths we note that the sun is often termed Te Manu-i-te-ra (The Bird in the Sun), a curious name, of which the true meaning or origin appears to be unknown to this generation. The sun had issue by Raumati one Tane-rore, who is the personifi cation of the quivering heat rays observed on hot summer days. When this is first seen, we say : " Kua tu te haka a Tane-rore "?the dancing of Tane-rore has commenced. It is the sign of Tane-rore that summer has returned. Table No. 2 gives the descent of man from Rangi through the Sun and Summer. In some traditions it is stated that Aroaro-a-manu (Aroaro mahana ?) is the personification of Summer, and wife of the Sun. Pio, of Ngati-Awa, speaks :? " That person, the Sun, which you see passing over his ancestor Rangi?I will explain to you his actions and descendants. The Sun has two wives. One wife lives in the south ; her work is the cultiva tion of food, and her name is Aroaro-a-manu or Raumati (Warmth or Summer). The other wife is Hine-takurua (Winter) ; she dwells on the ocean, and her task is the taking of fish. In the winter the Sun goes to the ocean and dwells with Hine-takurua. In the month O-toru (of the Maori year) the sun returns to land to his wife Rau mati, who cultivates the kumara. It is then summer." This is another account of the Sun and his descendants :? Tangaroa-akiukiu Hine-raumati = Te Ea = Hine-takurua Hine-takurua abides with Tangaroa and produces fish. Hine raumati dwells with her ancestor Tane and prepares huahua (preserved birds). You can see the sun going south to the one wife, and then return to the other. That is the changing of the sun. Te Ra = Hine-raumati Hikohiko Hahana-tu Tapui-kohu Aroaro-a-tama Te Hiko-o-te-rangi Maiku Wheriko Te Hau-o-puapua</page><page sequence="7">NOTES ON MAORI MYTHOLOGY. 99 Hine-ruia = Makara(?) Hine-nui-te-Po Itiiti Rekareka Whakawatai Kura-ariki Kura-i-monoa Awanui-a-rangi, &amp;c. (a man). Hine-i-tapeka was the origin of fire. Pu-te-hue Makara Hine-nui-te-Po Mahu-ika Hine-i-tapeka Takonui Takoroa Manawa Mapere Toiti Motumotu-o-rangi Ngarehu-o-ahirangi There are other names applied to winter, such as Hupe-nui, Upoko-papa, Tahutahu-ahi and Tioroa, while Ara-wheu is applied to midsummer, when the forest trails are overgrown with the new growth of shrubs. Whatu-rua is a name used to denote mid-winter. The son of Tangotango ever moves from the realm of one wife to that of the other. Such changes are called te takanga o te ra, the changing of the sun. Should the sun return to his land wife, Raumati, early in the season, then we know that a tau tuku-roa will follow, that is a season of slow growth. Of the children of the Sun and Hine-takurua, the first-born (Table p. 97) is the sea-gull, a female, as the prefix Hine denotes (karoro, the sea-gull). Hine-tara is another sea bird (tara, the tern). Hine tore is possibly meant for the torea, another bird, but this is supposi tion only.* Te Tore-o-te-ra is a place name in Tuehoe-land. Punga, the last born, is the parent or origin of all lizards, spiders, insects, &amp;c, for Tu-te-wehiwehi and Tu-te-wanawana were both lizards, while another of his offspring is said to have been the Kumu kumu (gurnard) which elected to take up its abode in the ocean. As the Kumukumu went to the ocean, the lizard sons of Punga said :? " Soon we shall hear of you being cooked at a common fire." Said the Kumukumu :?" Ere long I shall hear of you being roasted in a fern fire." " Not so !" replied the lizard, " for all will fear my ugly appearance." Hence, for all time, men have feared to look upon the lizard. Of the other children of Punga, we have no knowledge of the descendants of Haere-nui, but Noho-tumutumu is the parent or per sonification of the cormorant (kawau), a bird often seen perched on * We think tore has the meaning of redness here.?Editors.</page><page sequence="8">loo JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. tree stumps, as the above name indicates. Moe-tahuna is the personi fied origin of the parera or duck, which bird has a habit of sleeping upon sand banks (moe tahuna). In these two cases the personifications of the duck and shag are named from the habits of the birds. Matuku is the allegorized parent of the bittern. A Fragment. " Rua te pupuke, Rua te hotahota Takoto te ika whenua o te rangi Ka uraki mai ki te whanau o te manumanu kikino Ki te aitanga a Punga i au?e." A singular remark is one made by old Paitini of the Tuhoe tribe, when speaking of the relative amount of knowledge of native history possessed by the east and west coast tribes :?'* The west coast tribes are a very ignorant people. They possess no knowledge. No sun rises in that region. Knowledge comes from the sun and therefore we (the east coast people) who are near to the rising sun must be a wise people. The moon possesses no knowledge. The moon dies, dies and returns again to life ; but the sun never dies, it lives on, and on, and on." Presumably the old man meant that all ancient lore came from the direction of the rising sun, brought thence by the sea rovers of cjd who colonised this land, and landed on the east coast thereof. As we proceed to note and describe these old time beliefs of the Maori, it will be observed that, in seeking to learn the origin of the phenomena of nature, he ever attributed to such phenomena the characteristics and powers of man, including that of reproduction. In fine, he looked upon them as anthropomorphic beings possessed of the same attributes and passions as himself. The same allegorical style obtained in Polynesia or the forgotten fatherland of the Maori, as among the nations of the far west. Rangi but takes the place of Uranus, and the Maori personifiation of the sun is the Phoebus of the Occident, while Maui is the Polynesian Hercules. Te Marama?The Moon. We now come to the second-born of Tangotango and Wai-nui, viz., the Moon, whose wives were sisters, both being daughters of Tangaroa. (See Table I.) Tangaroa-a-roto = Te Marama = Rona Hete-nui-kaukau-ariki Now this Rona is the person in the moon. One night she set forth to bring water from the spring, taking with her several water vessels formed from the gourd. But the night was dark, and thus Rona stumbled several times as she proceeded. So enraged was she</page><page sequence="9">NOTES ON MAORI MYTHOLOGY. 101 at the moon for not giving its light that she cursed it vigorously. This was the origin of cursing in the world, a custom which has been the cause of many fierce and bloody wars. Naturally the moon was deeply offended at this gross insult, so he came down from the sky and took Rona back with him as a punish ment for her sin ; and there you may see her in the moon, with her bunch of water-vessels?a fearful lesson to those who indulge in profanity. Another version states that both Rona and her sister Tangaroa a-roto were taken by the moon, and that they became the wives of that useful orb. The following is said to be a karakia repeated by Rona, as she waited for the moon to appear :? E Rona E ! Tenei au te piki nei, te heke nei Ki te hihi o te marama?pio !* The Maori held a strange belief with regard to the moon, and which was explained as follows : " The moon is the real husband of all women (notemea kai te matenga o te marama, ka paheke te wahine).\ According to the knowledge of our ancestors and elders, the marriage of man and women is of no moment, the moon is the true husband." Ancient myths state that when the moon dies it proceeds to Te Wai-ora-o-Tane (the Life-giving Waters of Tane), and that by bathing in those waters it is restored to life?becomes again young and beautiful. The following explanations of the waning of the moon were given by natives, but would appear to be somewhat modern ideas : ? " We think that the waning of the moon is caused by its getting close to the sun, which overpowers the moon by its greater strength. As they drift apart again the moon re-appears ; it never really dies." " The disappearance of the moon is caused by its entering the sun, but it soon appears again. It is very small when it re-appears, but soon grows large." In former times the Maori appears to have reckoned time by the nights of the moon?by moons and seasons. The word tau, now used to denote a year, seems to have been anciently used as a season. A short space of time was reckoned by so many nights of the moon, and not by days of the sun, as we reckon. Differences exist among various tribes in the names of the lunar months and nights of the moon, as the following tables will show :? * This appears to be a later gloss ; composed after Rona's translation to the moon, and confounded perhaps with the original karakia.?Editors. t Because, on the death of the moon are women ill.</page><page sequence="10">102 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY.

The terms hinapouri and tapnuri are used to denote moonless nights, while the word told is applied to the waning moon, when the crescent begins to form. The moon dies not as man dies. It has been separated from its elder brother, the sun. Formerly they were joined together, and so traversed the sky in loving embrace ; they were very fond of each other. A time came when the sun said to the moon, " Do you go and seek a realm of your own?that is, for you and your younger brethren, the stars. Let us ever love them, the little ones." Such was the origin of love and sympathy and pity. It is still seen in this world. The sun, the moon, the stars and Hina-tore?these never quarrel? they dwell in amity towards each other. They live on for ever, but their descendants of this world know death?death by the house wall and death in battle. The former death was bequeathed to Tane by Rangi (the great sky parent), the second comes from Tu (god of war). It is not possible to induce man to do his appointed work in a proper manner?he ever errs. Not so the sun, the moon and the stars, which dwell on high. These are the lordly chiefs. Their saying is, " Rurea taitea, kia tu ko taikaka anake." The taitea represents the evil living people of the world. But tree and man alike perish and decay. The Whanau-Marama (Children of Light) on high, live on for ever. People say that the moon dies. It is not so. But it becomes like a young child, a little one that is carried by its elder brother, the sun.</page><page sequence="13">NOTES ON MAORI MYTHOLOGY. 105 Noa Whetu?The Stars. The Maori rendering of the science or doctrine of astrogeny is brief and simple. The heavenly bodies were born of Tangotango and Wai-nui ; they are the grandchildren of Rangi and Papa (Heaven and Earth). The Polynesian cosmology is by no means uninteresting, albeit all celestial bodies are treated in an allegorical manner, and extraordinary occurrences, as earthquakes, meteoric phenomena, &amp;c, are referred to personal agencies. This habit is peculiar to certain stages of human culture, to certain phases of the human mind, and would appear to represent a striving to emerge from the realm of demonism. Probably it marks the limit to advancement in those lines by the neolithic Maori, ignorant alike of the laws of matter and the higher forms of inductive reasoning. A list of the principal stars as known to the Maori is as follows :? Tari-ao Autahi or Atutahi, or Atutahi-ma-Rehua (Alpha centauri) Behua (Betelgeux, sometimes Antares) Te Kokota (Sirius) Pipiri Ti-rama-roa Makahea (Canopus) Te Kakau (Orion) Matariki (Pleiades) Tu-putuputu 1 The Magellan Clouds Ti-oreore J Te Pu-whakahara Tu-nui-a-te-ika Puanga (Rigel) Te Waka-o-Tama-rereti Peke-hawani Tautoru (sometimes Orion's Belt) Pou-tu-te-rangi Kopu or Tawera (Venus) Takero Whanui (Vega) (His younger brother was Bongo-maui, he who procured the kumara for mankind) Naha Poutini Te Mangoroa (Milky Way) Kauanga Whakaonge-kai Parearau (possibly Mars) There are other star names as known to the Maori, but the above contain such as have been given by the Tuhoe people. The stars are situated in the third heaven, according to the Maori. Rehua is one of the most famous stars with the Maori. He is said to have taken to wife Peke-hawani, the issue being Ruhi-te-rangi from whom sprung all food products cultivated by man. " Kua tau</page><page sequence="14">106 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. te waewae o R?hi ki te whenna " is a common saying : it means that crops or fruit are 'set' (viakuru). The appearance of Peke-h?wan? marks the eighth or foodless month. " Te Paki o Ruhi " is an expression denoting fine calm weather. Rehua is always spoken of as a bird. It has two wings, one of which is broken. Beneath the broken wing is Te Waka-o-Tama-rereti. In a MS written by Pio of Ngati-Awa is the following singular remark concerning Behua or Behua-i-te rangi :? " The children of Behua are in the water. They take to the water in the autumn. They go to the ocean in order to give birth to their young, which are there left to be laved by the waters.* In the fourth month (of the Maori year) the young return. They are called kaeaea (sparrow hawk). This is the haka for those young :? Te kaeaea i tuku mai rara I hara mai koe i te tai honuhonu o Meremere Ki' maturuturu koia." The Kaeaea that descends there, Thou comest from the deep seas of Meremeref Drip (off thee the water) then. Behua is always spoken of as a chief among stars. All the principal stars are the whetu rang atira (lordly stars) to the Maori, the smaller stars being the common people. The name Behua was often applied to Maori chiefs, and when a chief dies we say : " Ko Rehua ka mate " ?Behua is dead. The wings (paihau) of Behua are the puhihi of that star. Puhihi means a tail or streamer, as the puhihi of a kite or of a comet. What the puhihi is in the case of Behua may be made clear by those possessing some knowledge of astronomy. % An old saying is : " a te aha i whawhati te paihau o Rehua ?" (What broke the wing of Behua ?) And the old men reply : '? Na te taurekareka. a nga Papaka o Wharau-rangi,y\\ (By the slaves?by the crabs of Wharau rangi). It fell upon a certain fine morn some fifty bright summers ago, that the two tribes of Ngati-Awa and Ngati-Pukeko quarrelled over a mill site at Whakatane. So fierce became the dispute that both sides * This would seem to apply to the Kohi o Autahi. Te Manu-a-Rehua is a term applied to the kekerewai or little green beetle found on the manuka tree. It was a prized article of diet. t Cf. Fornander, Vol. I., p. 13 i, for the Sea of Meiemeie of Hawaiian Legends.?Editors. \ We suggest that puhihi in this connection means "radient." The hair of the Fijians is said to be puhihi, i.e., sticking out from the head or, in other words, radient.?Editors. Il Cf.

Tera Tawera ka mahuta i te pae, I hara mai nei koe i te matua i au. Na te aha i whatiwhati te paihau o Behua Na nga Papaka o Wharau-rangi i turaki ki raro ra.* Tenei te waha o rautao te tuwhera kau nei, He waro hekenga mai no Hopa. Nou E Kohua ! Kihai te toa o Hopa na i homai ki konei, Kia riri nga riri, kia toa nga toa, Kia anga te koinga ki runga o Tupateka, Mo nga mate whakarau e moe tonu mai ra." Behold Taweraf springing up in the horizon ! Thou comest from my parent. What was it that broke the wing of Behua ? 'Twas the papaka of Wharau-rangi that cast him down. Here is the mouth of the oven, full open, A chasm for the descent of Hopa. 'Twas on thy account, 0 Kohua ! That the bravery of Hopa reached not here, Nor fought the battles ; nor courage showed. Let the points (of bullets) turn towards Tu-pateka, For the numberless dead that ever sleep. Star names often appear in Maori songs, especially in the opening lines, as the following :? Tera Tariao ka moiri ki runga? Na runga ana mai te hiwi ki Bangi-aho. Behold Tariao swings above? Above on the ridge at Bangi-aho. And Tera Matariki huihui ana mai. Behold the Pleiades gathering here. Also Tera Whanui tauriporipo o te rangi. Behold Vega, the whirler of the sky. Rehua is also known and spoken of as "Behua kai tangata" (Rehua, destroyer of mankind). This star is seen when the crops are gathered and the merry war-party is abroad in the land. From the position of Rehua in regard to the moon omens are drawn by war parties. " Kua tahu a Behua" (Rehua has set fire to-) is an expression used when the warmth of summer is first felt. * See footnote on opposite page, t The evening star.</page><page sequence="16">108 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. " When Raumati (Summer) commands Rehua, then the quivering heat is seen, the waters are dried up, and the body of man is warmed." The following fragment is from a very ancent oriori or lullaby :? Ko Peke-hawani ka moe i a Rehua. Ko Ruhi-te-rangi ka tau kai raro. Te Ngahuru-tikotiko-iere. Ko Pou-tu-te-rangi, te matahi o te tau? Te putunga o te hinu, E tama E ! 'Twas Peke-hawani that married Rehua. Ruhi-te-rangi has alighted below. The Autumn of plenty is here. Pou-tu-te-rangi?the first sign of the year? (Gives) wealth of rich fat, O Son ! Te Ngahuru-tikotiko-iere is a term applied to the autumn season, when the crops are gathered and food is plentiful. A star known as the Whetu Puhihi derives its name from the fact of it having a tail of auahi (light ?*). This star has not been seen since the year of the Tarawera eruption. It is probably Tirama-roa. Matariki (the Pleiades) is a famous name in Maoriland. " Tena nga kanohi kua tikona e Matariki " is a saying applied to a person who is wakeful at night. It is equivalent to the expression of our child hood in reference to the domestic dustman. The Pleiades are often termed Te Huihui o Matariki (The gathering of Matariki). "When Matariki is seen by the eyes, then the korokoro (eel) appears and is caught by man." Autahi (or Atutahi) or Alpha Centuari is a star-name that often appears in Maori songs. Te K?hi o Autahi was born of Autahi. It is a name applied to cold?that is, the beginning of the cold weather in autumn. It is said the duties of Te K?hi o Autahi consist of giving birth to fish, which idea has probably arisen from noticing the fact that as the cold weather approaches fish leave the rivers for the ocean, and as the warm weather comes again the young fish appear from the sea and ascend the rivers. "When the K?hi o Autahi appears, that is when cold settles upon the land, then fish go to the sea." Thus Te K?hi o Autahi is a kind of personification of cold, and is born of Autahi. When Te Arawa canoe left Hawaiki for New Zealand, Puhaorangi said, " Farewell to you all. Look carefully to Autahi and Rehua"? meaning presumably that those stars would guide them to New Zealand. * Auahi, smoke, and inferentially vapour ; probably a comet. There was a conjunction of planets in the Tarawera year (June 10th, 1886).?Editors.</page><page sequence="17">NOTES ON MAORI MYTHOLOGY. 109 Thus Tamarau the Peacemaker, he who raised the tatau pounamu'* between the mountain tribes and the pakeha :?" It is only the chiefs of the stars, such as Whanui, that give to us the signs in regard to food for man. All stars are persons to us. The small stars are the common people. All the large stars sprang from Tawhiri-matea ; they are the grandchildren of Rangi. As they grew up Rangi took them and placed them in his broad bosom to nurse them. The first born was Autahi, that is the person who thrust aside the Mangoroa (Milky Way), lest it enfold him. We call the Mangoroa a fish?it is Te Ika-a-Maui.f It does not move in the same manner as other stars. It was Autahi who passed on one side, so Autahi rises in the evening that it may escape the Mangoroa. Autahi did not enter the hete (basket), but hangs on the outside. Kopu has three names. In summer time it rises in the evening and is known as Meremere-tu ahiahi. In the eigth and ninth months (of Maori year) it rises late at night and is then called Tawera. During the winter it rises in the morning and is styled Kopu." Whanui gives many signs to the Maori people in regard to food. When it moves slowly it is a sign of plentiful crops and an abundance of food. But when it moves swiftly, as if blown by the wind, then the coming season will be one of great scarcity, a lean season (he tau hiroki). When Whanui is seen flashing above the eastern horizon as autumn approaches, then the cry resounds: u Ko Whanui E-El Ko Whanui /" For that is the sign for taking up of the kumara crop. If the kumara (sweet potato) be not dug then, the crop will be spoilt and will not keep. Such kumara as are left in the ground become hou hunga, good to eat but will not keep. Potatoes are dug in the month Pou-tu-te-rangi. If left too late they will be spoilt, in which state they are termed tauhere or puakiweu. . T. Pio of Ngati-Awa speaks :? " In regard to the chiefs who dwell in the sky. Kopu: his task is to shew that morn approaches. Whanui: his duty is to bring the kumara, as salvation for the people who dwell in the world. Another is Matariki, he gathers together (the stars) as he goes, hence Te Huihui o Matariki (the gathering of Matariki). Again there is Tama rereti, that is Te Waka o Tama-rereti (the canoe of Tama-rereti), which we see clinging to the sky, beneath the broken wing of Rehua. The biggest tribe of the sky is Te Mangoroa (Milky Way). All this tribe travel together, they do not scatter. The fathers, mothers, * Tatau-pounamu, or green jade door&gt; a term applied to a formal peacemaking of enduring character. t Cf. the Barotongan belief that M?ui placed the Milky Way in its position in the heavens,?J.P.S./vol. viii., p. 73. 9</page><page sequence="18">110 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. elder and younger brothers, grandchildren (male and female), children, old men and cousins, all keep together. Their great task is to lighten the morning hours, such is the Maori sign of the coming dawn, those people in the sky. When one end of the Mangoroa swings to the eastern sea and the other end to the western, it is the sign that dawn approaches. Another chief (star) that dwells in the sky is Poutini, who is the origin of the pounamu (greenstone). Those people (the pounamu tribe) migrated hither from Hawaiki, from Mata-ora. They came to Tuhua (Mayor Island in Bay of Plenty, N.Z.), where they stayed a while. But another people pursued them from Hawaiki, meaning to slay the pounamu tribe. The latter left the isle of Tuhua, being afraid of the people of that place ; those people were known as mata (obsidian, Tuhua or Mayor Island is a famous place for it). That is why the tribe of Poutini left Tuhua and went to the Wai-pounamu (South Island of New Zealand), their fear of the obsidian was so great. All this time the tribe from the other side was still pursuing them. So the pounamu passed down the east coast and went far beyond Whakatu (Nelson) to the land of Taiaroa and his people. Then the pursuers came, but they could not find the pounamu tribe. So they sent the pito aruhe* to search for the pounamu, and the pito aruhe found them in the south land.f Then those pursuers went across the land? hence the stars seen above that land, the land of Taiaroa. In the south lands the two tribes met. Then the struggle began. The pounamu tribe was assaulted with the spear. Ngau-kanohiJ (Kai-kanohi) was speared. Kaukau-matuaJ was speared. So the pounamu tribe was speared and slain. Hence we see the Maori people in possession of greenstone which was slain and captured in that ancient battle. These were the grandchildren of Tangotango, the descendants of Poutini, whom we see gleaming in the sky." When the star Pou-tu-te-rangi is seen, then autumn has arrived. The star Naha is said to be the origin of the patiki (flounder, a fish). The star Te Pu-whakahara is the parent of the maire (a tree). Ti-oreore and Tu-putuputu (the Magellan Clouds) are collectively known as Te Whakaruru-hau. These persons dwell in the sky, their task is this : to give forth signs as to coming winds. The term person (tangata) is used in a very free manner by the Maori. I once heard a native declaiming against?tenet tangata kino, * Pito aruhe : a fern stalk used in ceremonies of divination, &amp;c. t See J.P.S., vol. v., p. 233. J Names of a celebrated greenstone mere and an ear-pendant.?Editor,</page><page sequence="19">NOTES ON MAORI MYTHOLOGY. Ill a rama?this evil person, rum. In listening to speeches made by members of an uhunga (mourning party) one often hears allusions to this great (destructive) person, Misfortune (tenei tangata nui a Aitua). The stars Kauanga and Whakaonge-kai are said to be wives of Rehua. The former belongs to the land, the latter to the sea. The star Tirama-roa has long rays (puhihi). It was seen during the siege of Te Tapiri and again about the time of the eruption of Tarawera mountain. Sometimes the rays or tail is downward and sometimes upward. The rising of Pipiri gives the name of the month?Te Toru heri o Pipiri. When it rises then Matariki is also seen. Te Hao-o-Rua is the kupenga (net) seen in the heavens. It is near unto Te Kakau (Orion). Autahi said to Tariao, "Let us travel by land that we may avoid entering the Mangoroa " (Milky Way). Tariao replied, "No; my desire is that the Mangoroa do enter the net." So Tariao dwells within the Mangoroa, and it was Tariao who fixed Ti-oreore and Tu-putuputu (the Magellan Clouds) as pillars for the net. The latter never set, they merely revolve. Tama-rereti wished them to go on board his canoe, but Tariao declined. Then Tama-rereti went a fishing and caught some herrings, but in eating them he was choked by the bones thereof, and so perished. Te Kokota (Sirius) is a female from whom we derive signs in regard to the seasons. Rehua had two elder children, Poanana and Tahumate. These were born in the month Mahuru. Their task is to show that spring is approaching. Their mother was Puanga, but Ru-aumoko gave them to the world as he shook the great earth mother, Papa-tuanuku. Others were born afterwards. Puahou was born in winter and they are all suckling during that season. (Puahou and Tahumate are in some way connected with the parapara or houhoutvee (Panax arboreum) which fruits in winter. Both names indeed are here applied to that tree.) The Magellan Clouds : when wind arises, these persons, Ti-oreore and Ti-takataka (or Tu-putuputu) go to ward off the wind from their people. Comets or meteors have different names among the Maori. Tamarau is a famous name in this district, it is applied to a comet that gives off sparks as it flies?as the natives put it. Another is Tu-nui-a-te-ika, which has a long tail. Among other tribes Rongomai is a correct name. When Tu-nui-a-te-ika was seen in former times, the tohunga (priest) at once proceeded to m?t?puru, i.e., to ward off the evil omen by means of karakia. Puanga and Takurua and Matariki, these ascended from their mother Raro, and climbed to the heavens. The kumara-rau-nui (kumara-hou, a tree) is the kmnara of Raro. It was the origin of the humara that we cultivate.</page><page sequence="20">112 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. Here Raro is evidently a mystical term either for the underworld or for the earth as opposed to the sky. We note the name in an old invocation, used by fishermen of old :? E Karo! E Raro! Te Po ! Te Po-tahuri-ke ! Te Po-tahuri-mai ! Tou maunu tikina mai, kumekumea Tikina mai, takatakahitia Tikina mai, haparangitia Kia u, kia ngoto. Hoko-kumara is a name for Matariki (Pleiades). When Matariki rises in the east the humara is sown. We shall observe it in the following song, together with other interesting expressions :? He Waiata Mate Hiakai. (Composed by Rangi-peka-noa.) E noho ana hoki i?nei I roto koia o toku whare Moe matatu ko au anake Eatahi nei hanga kino na te atua E rua aku tau e huna ai koe Te mau atu au i te toko Te wewe Nuku, te we we Rangi Watawata i runga, watawata i raro Au Kokouri, au Kokotea Nga tai o te kura e whati mai nei Mauria atu ra i te peka, te peka o te ariki, I huna i te kai Na taua tatari hoki ianei Kia huri taua i a Hoko-kumara Hai kawe atu ra i ahau Nga whakakoronga kai Rangi-toto Kai te tupuranga mai o Hawaikj Kai aku mahara e takoto nei-e. Here Kokouri and Kokotea are terms applied to the stars Kokota and Te Kohi, they refer to producing and abundance of food. Peka o te ariki is a singular expression used by Ngati-Kahungunu of the east coast. It means the frost, ice or snow which destroys food, that is its practical meaning, but it is more generally used in a semi mystical sense, an incorporeal force which withholds food from man. It resembles matao ? infertility?and is equivalent to the Uri o Whaitiri. A star is the aria (likeness-form of incarnation) of the atva (god deified ancestor in this case) Tama-i-waho. Me te mea ko Kopu ka rere i te pae?like Venus flashing above the horizon. This is a saying applied to a beautiful or well dressed woman. Nganga was the parent. His offspring was Tio-roa, that is to say, the drifting snow. Should rain come in the fourth month, then all trees of the forest (except the puahou ?) bring forth their young, that is, their fruit.</page><page sequence="21">NOTES ON MAORI MYTHOLOGY. 113 Here Nganga (hail) is spoken of as being the parent of Tio-roa which is one of the personified forms of winter. Another member of the Bongo and Tu brotherhood (not inserted in this table) was Haumia-tiketike, the parent or origin of the edible fern root (aruhe). Another personified term for the same root appears among some tribes as Ariki-noanoa. Te Aputahi-a-Pawa is a wind. When it first rises it is a gentle wind, a matariki. But should it continue for many days, then it will be dangerous, and you had better stop it at once. Go you to the water and standing therein pass your left hand under your thigh, and be sure that you clutch a piece of dead ember in the hand. Then all will be right and lovely and that wind will die away. Ordinary winds are spoken of as being the offspring of Baka maomao, while gales are the children (born of) Tawhirimatea.* The sacred oko (calabash) is concealed at Matahina. It is Tipoki o-rangi. Should it be interfered with, the booming thunder is heard, the heavens awake. It is Whaitiri-pakapaka and Pueaea and Rau tupu, these are the names of the thunder, but they are of different kinds. The frost and snow. These are known as the " Ika a Whaitiri." It is Whaitiri who places them upon the whata. The saying is: " Nga uri o Whaitiri whakapapa ou kai." Should we be going to the village yonder, to Mata-atua. Our fame has preceded us. The people of that place set about bird snaring and fishing (to obtain food for us). No fish are caught, not a bird taken in the snares. That is because our mana has preceded us and driven all the food (fish and birds) afar off, that they may not be visible to the people. Our mana has banished them. That is the Uri o Whaitiri and we repeat the saying. It is Whaitiri who withholds food from man, and banishes it afar off. Her husband was Kai tangata, she prevented him from obtaining food. She said, " Whaka papa ou kai." On arriving at a village, should there be no food at that place, the people will say, " E tohu ano ko nga Uri o Whaitiri tenei." T?hu is a kind of emblematical term for food generally, the per sonification of food. " Kaua e takahi i a aim "?do not despise Tabu?is an expression used towards a person who has declined proffered food. Bongo is an equivalent term applied to cultivated foods, principally the humara, the full name being Bongo-marae-roa. * The information contained in this article, it may be as well to mention, has been all obtained at first hand, either taken down from the lips of the native speakers or in some cases written out by natives who are admitted authorities in the ancient lore of the Maori. This will explain any haziness in sundry passages, or even contradiction.?E.B.</page><page sequence="22">114 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY, We have seen that unusual events were, by the Maori, attributed to personal agencies. This is the case with earthquakes, which are said to be caused by Ru-aumoko, the great atua (god or demon) of the underworld. Earthquakes are the result of his turning over in his sub terranean abode. Ru-aumoko is also the cause of the changes of the seasons. In turning over he turns the winter below and the summer up, and vice versa in autumn. It was Tane who sent Ru-aumoko below as a person for that region. Ru-aumoko was brother to Tane. His task is to separate Warmth from Cold. In the fourth (month) or Te Toru-heri-o-Pipiri he turns the warmth uppermost. In that month the fat (products of) Winter are ready for man. At that time Matariki has acquired ful ness (of size), the rich products are ready, it is Te Paki o Matariki. By rich products (goods) is meant birds and rats. When Rangi and Papa were separated, Rangi said to Ru-ai makoroa: " Go you below and hold fast to your mother (Papa, the Earth)." It is Ru-ai-mokoroa that sends the thunder, as also do the stars Rehua, Tautoru and Rangi-riri. Another underground dweller, according to Maori tradition, was the Tuoro or Hore. This was a gigantic reptile which lived under ground, burrowing vast passages as it moved, and uprooting trees when it came near the surface. A cave in the river bluff at Ahi kereru, Te Whaiti, is known as Te Ana-tuoro. Tuoro is also a place name in Rarotonga. The term hore is here applied to a big power ful man. A Tuoro is said to have dwelt in the Otara lakelet on the summit of Maunga-pohatu. It is credited with having formed the valley of the Waikare stream at that place in times long past away. In a version of the destruction of Tuna the Eel god by Maui, given in White's Ancient History of the Maori, is the following :? " And the tail of Tuna became the Puku-tuoro. This is the monster that dwells in the land of Aotea-roa (N.Z.). And Rangi (the sky) lay with Papa (the Earth). Their offspring were Tane and Tangotango and Wai-nui. These were the origin of all things in the world. This was the beginning of mankind and of plants, and trees, and stones, and fish, and dogs, and birds, and insects. Of rats, moths, spiders, mosquitoes, mu,* lizards and all things of the earth. (The above is a pretty large order, but the wise men of the whare takiura (house of learning) have spoken?and who shall say them nay). * In Hawaiian mu is a little black bug. We do not know it as a Maori word. ?Editors.</page><page sequence="23">NOTES ON MAORI MYTHOLOGY. 115 Let there be Light. The offspring of Tangotango and Wai-nui are the Whanau mamma (the Children of Light). They are the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, Phosphorescence, and Pari-kiokio, and Hine-rau-a-moa. The manawa* of the Whanau marama still endures. The gleam of the Children of Light is still seen in the flame of fire, it has never turned from earth. Should it return?that is the end of man on earth?the earth shall no longer know man. It was Tane-nui-a-rangi who raised on high his parent Rangi (the sky), that Light might enter the world. But the Light came not, and the offspring of Heaven and Earth lay in black darkness on the broad breast of the Earth Mother (Papa). Hence these terms : Te Po tahuri-ke, Te Po-ka-rapa-ke. And Tane looked forth and beheld the Children of Tangotango, and behold ! they vere the Whanau marama, the Shining Ones. Then Tane came unto Tangotango and said:?" How brightly gleam our children of the Whanau-marama." Tangotango asked, "For what purpose?" And Tane replied, "To lighten us in our darkness ; that Light may shine across the breast of our mother." So Hine-rau-a-moa was given to Tane, that Light might enter the world, and Tane placed her on the breast of Bangi, the Sky parent. But the black void was uupierced by Hine, and darkness held fast. Tane returned and demanded another of the Children of Light. It was Te Hinatore (Phosphorescent light). But the Earth Mother still lay enveloped in darkness, and the Light came not. He then procured Nga Whetu?the Stars, and now feeble rays glimmer across the world but the broad light is yet afar off. Then the moon was obtained and Light became stronger, but not yet was Tane satisfied. Once more he came to Tangotango and said :?" Give to me yet .again. It is Te Ra, the sun, the last of the Whanau marama I would have." Then his brother Tangotango was angered and sent the glaring sun, bristling with fierce rays, that Tane might be destroyed with the heat thereof. But Tane warded off the fierce rays. Yet so fierce was the heat that he resolved to raise Bangi still higher that man might not be destroyed by the fierce sun. So he thrust the Sky far up above the Earth, but the Children of Light still clung to the breast of Bangi, where he had placed them. And so Light was." Tane seeks Woman. " It was then that Tane went forth to seek Woman that he might possess a wife. He found Hine-tu-maunga, who brought forth Para whenua-mea, hence the great waters which appear. (Para-whenua-mea * Manawa, the breath ; used probably here metaphorically for iridescence or exudation, as a gas flame from coal or wood.?Editors.</page><page sequence="24">116 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. is a female. She is the personification of flood waters. See Tables Nos. 4 and 5.) The Tuku-rangi is a karakia (invocation) to cause a flood to rise. It calls upon Para-whenua-mea to appear. Tane then found Hine-wao-riki, who brought forth the kahika and matai (two forest trees). He found Mumuhanga, and she gave birth to the totara (a forest tree). He found Tu-kapua, who became the parent of the tawai (a tree). He found Mango-nui, she produced the tawa and hinau (trees). He then took Te Pu-whakahara (a star), she gave birth to maire (a tree, a highly prized hardwood). He found Rere-noa, she brought forth the rata (a tree). He found Ruru-tangi-akau, she became the parent of the ake (a tree). He then took Punga, the result was the kotukutuku and patate (trees), likewise insects and all small things. He took Tu-toro-whenua and formed the aruhe (edible fern root)." Again, Pani-tinaku is the parent of the kumara (sweet potatoe). Hine-mahanga is the parent of the tutu (a shrub). Tawake-toro is parent of the manuka (a tree). Hine-rau-a-moa is parent of the kiokio (a fern). Huna is parent of the harakeke (flax). Tawhara-nui is parent of the kiekie (a climbing plant. Rough shoulder capes are made from the leaf fibre thereof). Kakaho is parent of the toetoe (Arundo conspicua, grass). It was at this time that Tane found Woman. Her name was Kurawaka. She was the grandchild of Tiki, and was pointed out to Tiki by Ro-iho and Ro-ake. (When Tiki had produced man he sought to form woman. He formed two mounds. One was Tuahu-a-te-rangi, the other Puke-nui-a-Papa. He placed in each mound a wand. That of Tuahu-a-te-rangi was the Wand of Life, that of Puke-nui-a-Papa was the Wand of Death. He produced woman from Puke-nui-a-Papa, which represents the Po (Hades, the World of Darkness) and Sin. Tiki then cast down (turaki) the Wand of Death on Puke-nui-a-Papa. Ro-iho said :?" See, 0, Tiki ! You have overthrown Woman." That woman was Kura-waka). So Tane took Kurawaka to wife and had Hine-ahu-one. Tane married his daughter, Hine-ahua-rangi was the result. Tane married his grand-daughter who had Hine-titama. Tane married his great-grand-daughter. One day she asked:?"Who is my father?'' Tane replied, "I am both your father and your grand-father. Then Hine was overcome with shame and rose up and went afar off in search of Tane-te-wai-ora, Tane of the Waters of Life. She said, " I have fled from the Upper World. I have lain with my own father." So Tane came in search of Hine, but she * For origin or birth of trees see also White's " Ancient History of the Maori,' vol. 1, p. 127.</page><page sequence="25">NOTES ON MAORI MYTHOLOGY. 117 would not return to him. Tane said, " I will return, but first do you give me the tatai (embelishment) of your house as adornment for the bare breast of our parent (Bangi)." Tane-te-wai-ora replied, "It is well. Let a basket be woven." The basket was woven. The name of that basket was Haruru. In it were placed all the tatai of the house but one, which one was suspended outside, being fastened to the handle of the basket. Then the people of Tawhiri-matea arrived and danced before Tane, after which Tane returned to his place. He then placed the tatai he had brought, on the breast of Bangi (the Sky). They are the stars which you see gleaming upon the breast of Bangi, our father. Hine-pukohu-rangi and Hine-wai. (Personified forms of mist or fog, and of rain.) Among these mountain tribes of Tuhoe-land, one Hine-pukohu rangi is the personification of fog and of mist. On the east coast (Te Wairoa) her place seems to be taken by Tairi-a-kohu who came down from heaven and married Uenuku, but having been ill-treated by him she forthwith returned to the sky. Uenuku went forth in search of her and eventually died in a far land. His semblance is the rainbow. Uenuku is a rainbow god. Kahukura is another rainbow god, as also were Haere-atautu, Haere-waewae and Haere-kohiko. These are the personified forms of the rainbow and in ancient Maori tradition are credited with the powers of speech and locomotion. Hine-wai was the sister of Tairi-a-kohu. She is the personifica tion of the light rain that descends during foggy weather. Hine-pukohu-rangi also made it her business to descend to earth where she married Te Maunga, the Mountain, and had Potiki, from whom sprang Nga-Potiki, who were the ancient people of Tuhoe land. The Maori holds singular beliefs in regard to mountains, rivers, &amp;c. To the former he allots the powers of speech, of locomotion and generation. When the long and bloody war between the Tuhoe tribe and those of Buapani and Kahungunu, was brought-to a close, the peace was firmly cemented by the marriage of Hine-ki-runga, daughter of Hipara of Kahungunu to a chief of the Tuhoe tribe. And Nga-rangi mataeo said, " We will bind the peace firm by means of the ceremony of tat au pounaviu." Then the hills Kuha-tarewa and Tuhi-o-kahu, which stand by the Sea of Waikare, were set up as man and wife, the former being the female. And those two hills were united in marriage, as are men and women. That was the binding of peace, the peace that has endured even unto this day, the day of the White men.</page><page sequence="26">118 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY. . . . .

That boils up at Tongariro And warms my flesh?even from Rangi. Who married (him) to Pihanga the wife, Hence rain, wind and storm to the north. Traditions of Travelling Mountains. In former times, that is in very ancient times, the mountains Maunga-pohatu, Kakar?-mea and Pu-tauaki migrated from the south ?from Te Matau-a-Maui (Cape Kidnappers)?and came northwards to the places where we now see them, Maunga-pohatu was the wife of Kakar?-mea (Rainbow Hill at Wai-o-Tapu). They disagreed as to which direction they should travel in. The former said, "Let us go to the east." "Ehe!" cried the husband, "to the south." "Not so," replied the wife, " my desire is the east." " My own way shall I go," said Kakar?-mea. " So soon as we have partaken of food I shall depart with our offspring to the north, there to find a new home." But their children had already departed for the north, and were followed by their mother, by Maunga-pohatu. Those children were Tapanaua (a large rock in the Tauranga Stream at Te Wai-iti), Mou-tohora (an island off Whakatane), Tokatapu, Hinarae* and Toka-a-Houmea (rocks at Whakatane). When overtaken by daylight the party were unable to travel further, hence they stand where we of to-day see them. Maunga-pohatu, under whose shadow the ancient tribe of Nga potiki dwelt long centuries ago, and whose gloomy caves hold the bones of their dead, is ever spoken of by the descendants of that old-time people as their mother who brought them forth, and who takes them back to her broad bosom in death. Hamiora Pio, of the Children of Awa, speaks : " Let me speak now of the mountain people. Tonga-riro had two wives, Pihanga and Nga-uru-hoe. Quarrels arose among the mountain people. Tonga riro and Tara-naki (Mt. Egmont), which latter formerly stood by the Sea of Taupo, quarrelled about those women. Hence Tara-naki left that part and went to the west coast, where it now stands. Others also left that place and sought new standing-places. They were Pu-tauaki (Mt. Edgcumbe), Whakaari (White Island) and Paepae aotea (a rocky islet near White Island). Pu-tauaki had two wives? Whatiura and Pohatu-roa.

These two fought fiercely when they met, aud the wizard god struck so stout a blow that the head of Bua-wahia was cleaved thereby, hence its name. " But Pu-tauaki became lonely out there on the great plain, and his desire was toward Maunga-pohatu. So he sang this song :? Kaore hoki e te mate?a?a?a? Whanawhana i roto ra?o?o?ra?
