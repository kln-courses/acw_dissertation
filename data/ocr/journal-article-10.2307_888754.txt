The artist has spoken of hidden or private narratives governing the develop- ment of each composition; and this is per- haps what guarantees him the degree of inventiveness he enjoys. Here too one is aware of a sometimes pungent sometimes elusive perfume, so to speak, from earlier painting. In particular it is rather forgotten mid-century School of Paris abstraction such as that of Dewasne, Deyrolle or Domela that comes to mind. And Nozkowski is neither a parodist, nor an unconscious recycler of styles. He is clearly a deeply informed painter who has found a practice which, while utterly personal, situates him very specifically in his tradition and thus allows genuine innovation. The contemporary to whom he is in some ways closest - though he has more breadth and density and restless resistance to the obvi- ously poetic - is the English artist Prunella Clough. Nozkowski is a mature, firmly established artist, but signs that younger painters might be learning some of his lessons could be found in the group exhibition entitled la la at Tricia Collins Contemporary Art (closed 5th February) which included Jason Rosenberg, Layla Lozano, Warren Isensee and a figurative artist, Michele Basora. (The ideological separation of abstraction and figuration has long since been eroded, no doubt for the best; but again, one sometimes yearns for the focused research that could be implied in the old factionalism.) Lozano's dancing splatters and trails of liquid silver paint deftly dissect the mechanism by which abstract marks take on anthropomorphic dynamism and bodily association. The phe- nomenon has long been exploited by artists from Masson and Gorky to contemporaries such as Cecily Brown, but Lozano has a modesty of format and a direct materiality that could take her into less familiar territory. Jason Rosenberg's confectionery tones and knowingly cute compositions (Fig.72), and Warren Isensee's arrangements of pale, oblate blobs and loops, cleanly rendered and variously grouped, may seem scarcely removed from late formalist exercises. How- ever, in both there was a winning sense of speculative picture-making that might at any moment modulate into genuinely new abstract registers.

New York Stan Douglas and Douglas Gordon It is some consolation to New Yorkers who will not get to see the Canadian artist Stan Douglas's current touring retrospec- tive, organised by the Vancouver Art Muse- um,' that the Dia Center for the Arts has been showing over the past year Douglas's recent video installation piece, Win, place or show (1998; Fig.74) paired in an inspired double feature with Douglas Gordon's film installation, left is right and right is wrong and left is wrong and right is right (1999). The com- bined show (closed 5th March) was called Double Vision, a title apt on more than one level: both artists exhibited diptychs, simul- taneously projected on two abutting hori- zontal screens, and both pieces use and subvert the structures of film narrative to create disturbing, dreamlike alternate universes. The action of Win, place or show consists of two men arguing in a small apartment. The argument is pointless and, like all argu- ments, circular. The cheaply built interior with its flimsy green room divider and its indifferently plastered walls, looks like a low-budget set for a TV series (Fig.74). Every six minutes or so the action repeats itself and the men speak the same lines we have just heard, but they seem to come out differently. The younger man, Donny, picks up the newspaper and reads ajoke; it's not always the same joke, but sometimes it is. The radio plays indistinctly in the back- ground (we can just make out the music from Carmen at one point). There is also the faint, ever-present sound of rain. 'Ever notice how everywhere you go radio sounds the same?' Donny asks. 'Radio stations, news- papers, they could all be from anywhere ... like those scientists out there working on computers, plotting how everything moves . .'. It is, in fact, a computer that, in the immediate present, governs the characters' moves. The six minute mini-drama has been shot in many different short takes from different camera positions and distances all around the room. During the performance, a computer continually re-shuffles the vari- ous takes and decides which combination to project onto the two horizontal screens, which abut each other with a slight space between them. Usually the two screens show the same moment from different angles, but sometimes they combine into what appears to be a single double-wide shot, which, however, doesn't quite match up at the seam in the middle, so that a character might walk to the middle of the diptych and be swallowed up in the seam. Apparently there are a total of 204,023 possible permu- tations of the work. Why is this little drama so compelling? For so it is, even without the background information which, as with all of Stan Doug- las's pieces, we know must underlie it. It is partly the hypnotically fascinating opposi- tion of repetition and variation, almost like music. We wait hopefully for some unsus- pected difference in the text, some surpris- ing new camera angle (there, suddenly for a few seconds, is a close-up of the little dinette set at the back of the apartment), some slip of the tongue that will make the drama take an entirely new turn, solve the riddle and let us out of this strange, dreamlike stasis. About once every cycle the camera looks out of the window onto the rainy city, but that too has a computer-generated look, almost Bladerunner-ish in tones of silvery- black and grey. It seems that in the 1960s Strathcona, a working-class area of Vancouver of small wood frame houses, was earmarked for 'urban renewal', and about a quarter of the area was torn down and rebuilt before local protests halted the project. The set of the apartment that Donny and Bob live in was constructed by Stan Douglas following the plans of one of the huge, international-style apartment buildings designed for single working men in the redevelopment, but never built. Win, place or show takes place continually in an unbuilt world and a future that never happened. The future is marooned in the past. There are certain parallels between Win, place or show and Douglas's 16 mm. film in- stallation Der Sandmann (1995-97), the master- piece which single-handedly made the 1995 Whitney Biennial one of the best exhibitions 259</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS 74.

The workers' housing project of the former corresponds to the German Schrebergdrten, or small working-class allot- ment gardens, that are the setting for the latter. Both were less the benign Utopian experiments they claimed to be than means of keeping underpaid workers close to their jobs. The multiple points of view of Win, place or show are like a fragmented equivalent of the continuous 360 degree pans of Der Sand- mann. But where the text of the latter was adapted from E.T.A. Hoffman, the disillu- sioned dialogue of Win, place or show has more to do with Douglas's own Monodrama videos from 1991, short, laconic video pieces influenced by his study of Samuel Beckett's teleplays. Douglas Gordon's left is right and right is wrong and left is wrong and right is right (Fig.75) is also a diptych. Projected in black and white onto an area larger than Win, place or show, it incorporates a stroboscopic effect that initially overwhelms the viewer. One stands in its presence and bathes in its glow, rather than peering into it, as one seems to do with Douglas's video. Like most of Gordon's work, left is right is an altered Holly- wood movie; in this case the raw material is Whirlpool, a little-known Otto Preminger film from 1949, dealing with hypnosis. Gordon divided the frames of the movie onto two video discs, projected the even-numbered frames on the right and the odd-numbered ones on the left, replacing the missing frames of each with black to create the dis- orienting stroboscopic flicker. The most beautiful visual effects of the piece, though, result from the double projection of the film, with the left half flipped so that the resulting, double-wide image is symmetrical around the central axis, like a Rorschach blot. This creates constantly metamorphosing new forms: goose-neck lamps become eyes of strange insect-faces, characters literally 'turn into' one another or become double- headed Januses before our eyes, and the troubled female protagonist is always accompanied by her mirror-double. The centre of the double screen is never still: when the camera pans to the left everything is sucked into the central void, almost like the whirlpool of the original movie's title, and when it pans to the right, the image appears to be regurgitated out of the centre. The film's sound track has also been split and interrupted to become a mostly unin- telligible stutter, though occasional words and phrases can be made out: '. . . unless I'm crazy ... I'm dreaming all this...' The work is endlessly fascinating and, appropri- ately, hypnotic.2 NATHAN KERNAN 'The Stan Douglas exhibition was at the Edmonton Art Gallery, Edmonton, Alberta (25th June-24th August 1999) and The Power Plant, Toronto, Ontario (24th September-21st November 1999). It is currently at the De Pont Museum, Tilburg, The Nether- lands (to 28th May) before travelling to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (10th Decem- ber-lst April 2001). 2Works by Douglas Gordon are currently on view at ARC, Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, to 30th April. Los Angeles Leon Kossoff Hogarth and Constable argued that there was no need for 'abroad', because the stay-at-home English painter could mingle at will in London with the greatest masters of the European tradition. Leon Kossoff - that poet of the drab London high street, the dim Underground, and the claustrophobic sitting room - regularly makes the trip from Kilburn to Trafalgar Square, to visit the finest picture gallery in the world, where 'The walls are dark with beauty; they frown severest grace', there to engage with the sensuous classical world of Nicolas Poussin, whom he also studied at the Royal Acad- emy, during the unforgettable exhibition devoted to Poussin in the winter of 1994- 95. Kossoffhas drawn and painted from the Old Masters sporadically for many years - inspired by the vital movement of Rubens or the rich matter of Rembrandt's facture - but perhaps never so intensively as in the case of Poussin. Kossoffs responses to Poussin are pre- sented in a complementary pair of exhibi- tions, Drawn to Painting. Leon Kossoff Drawings and Prints after Nicolas Poussin at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (to 2nd April; then touring), and the oddly titled Poussin Landscapes by Leon Kossoff at the J. Paul Getty Museum (to 16th April). The Getty has produced a brochure by the directorJohn Walsh, while the larger exhi- bition at LACMA is accompanied by a book, with an essay by Richard Kendall,' produced in association with LA Louver Gallery, Kossoffs enter-prising representa- tive in Los Angeles. The London artist's appearance so far away from Kilburn is also justified by the fact that the Getty recently lent its newly acquired Poussin Landscape with a calm to the National Gallery for sever- al months, in order that Kossoff might work from it. In return, London has lent Landscape with a man killed by a snake to the Getty exhi- bition: it is a work to which Kossoff was rather more deeply attracted, and the visitor can assess the modern artist's different responses to the two great contrasting oils. Kossoff admits that he struggled with the Getty picture, the very epitome of calmness, and one has to say that his drawings and a drypoint after it (cat. nos.47-50) are disap- pointingly hesitant; only by the second state of the etched interpretation (no.52) does Kossoff seem to achieve an overall harmony in the plate, and to capture a genuine pas- toral poetry; this may owe something to his use of a sepia ink, which both evokes Poussin's and Claude's wash drawings and is associated in the mind with such earlier interpretative prints as Earlom's sepia aqua- tints after Claude. Working in the National Gallery in 1999, Kossoffwas drawn back to 76. The Triumph of Pan (From a Poussin drawing II), by Leon Kossoff. 1998. Drypoint, 9.8 by 11.4 cm. (Collection of the artist; exh.
