An increasing number of lists are being created, and they offer an ever-greater array of materials to the scholar. The author provides examples of how the electronic medium has been of use in his own research. Key Words: computer-based communications, listservers, Bitnet, Internet, networks The grand ambition of the Xanadu system is not "a database the size of the world," but rather a repository publishing network for anybody's documents and contents, which users may combine and link to freely. Theodor H. Nelson Prior to the fashionable interest of the past decade in the "theory" behind literary interpretation, we sometimes encountered a distinction drawn be- tween the scholar and the critic, often to the disadvantage of the latter. The term scholarship, as with scientific investigation, was assumed to repre- sent an objective, or disinterested, search for new knowledge, often in rare and obscure regions requiring particular skills and training, as in the classical languages. Robert Altick was an arch proponent of the ideal of scholarly, as opposed to critical, inquiry. His Scholarly Adventurers de- scribed learned pursuits, such as the deciphering Terrence Erdt, Director of Instructional Technol- ogies at Purdue University Calumet and author of a monograph on Jonathan Edwards, is currently researching the idealization of robots and other anthropomorphic machines. of Samuel Pepys's diary, in a manner occasionally resembling a detective story. Indeed Arthur Conan Doyle could have furnished the titles for some of Altick's chapters: "The Case of the Curious Bibliographers" and "Secrets in Cipher." At bot- tom, Altick wanted to show that the scholar's investigation was anything but trivial, not impres- sionistic criticism, certainly not politically founded logorrhea, but rather a search for truth of the same order as that of science. And so he painted with relish the painstaking, thorough labors of the scholar, whose research seemingly had a purpose greater than the attainment of tenure and promo- tion. Criticism, in contrast to scholarship, was fre- quently made out to be an impressionistic affair, largely an elaboration of personal perspectives and interpretations, involving little or no famili- arity with "background," or even of the original language of a translated work. The scholar ques- tioned whether the critic contributed to knowl- edge; after all an almost limitless series of inter- pretations was to be encountered in some of the most favored territories for critics, such as Shake- speare, Milton, and Pound. The scholar, on the other hand, was supposed to be presenting new information, unquestionably a contribution, since it was assumed to be needed for true understand- ing of the great works of literature. Detracting critics would claim, however, that many scholarly outpourings were merely pedantic. To an impartial observer (if in the era of "post theory" such can be said to exist) literary studies might have seemed pressed by the mid twentieth century to offer much new ground for critical interpretation. It might be argued, of course, that Computers and the Humanities 26: 169-173, 1992. a 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Not that the scholar was in a much better position than the critic when it came to a relatively closed corpus of texts. It would take a lot of virgin land to occupy the legions of new Ph.D.s that arrived on the scene in the sixties and seventies. The continuing conversion of text on paper to text in electronic form and, in conjunction, the expanding possibilities of access through telecom- munications are opening up new areas and modes of research. And the resulting opportunities for scholarly and critical inquiry are not based simply upon changes in fashion - that is, arbitrary changes in points of view (existentialism, pheno- menology, critical theory) toward materials and grounds covered. The growing corpora of machine readable texts includes primary documents as well as bibliographic databases, texts of unquestioned importance as well as those significant for what they reveal of background. These resources in many cases have never been explored, and they likely will prove invaluable in many instances for what they reveal about subjects that humanists deem worthy of study. Additionally, there are new and powerful computer applications being assem- bled to organize, publish, and explore them. While some of these materials are being distributed on disks, many require computer-based communica- tions, or telecommunications, to be accessed. This likely will be the state of affairs for sometime to come.'1 Electronic communication and publication, a subset, are expanding rapidly, as John Quarter- mann's The Matrix: Computer Networks and Conferencing Systems Worldwide suggests (Bed- ford MA: Digital Press, 1990). And the rate of increase is expected to continue to expand signifi- cantly. According to some forecasts, by 1995 most of the twenty-nine to forty-five million computers in the United States, will be on LANs and will have access to the Internet (INTERNET Society News, vol. 1, no. 1, Winter 1992, 5). Currently the web of networks encompasses approximately 727,000 hosts in 38 countries, with e-mail con- nections to 106 nations and over a million addi- tional host machines with e-mail only, rather than interactive, links. Plans call for raising the speed of transmission over certain portions of the Internet (those constituting NSFnet) to T3 (45 Mbbs), and efforts by the Internet Engineering Task Force Internet Message Extensions work group are underway to establish standards for transmission of audio, video, and fax (Boardwatch Magazine, April 1992, pp. 41-44). Using computer-based communications, some scholars are teaching in new ways, and exploring new territories via networks such as Bitnet and the Internet. In effect, their exchange of corre- spondence (e-mail) publicly on lists over global networks constitutes participation in a new form of publication. This dimension is central; such network communications systems as Bitnet and the Internet offer new modes of publication, often but not always with counterparts in print media. In time the e-mail sent to listservers for public viewing may include multimedia, with embedded voice and video. The posting on a Bitnet "list" frequently resem- bles a letter to the editor in newspapers; here someone simply conveys his or her opinions on a subject or suggests a subject about which the readership may wish to comment. More formal postings, in which, for instance, a researcher asks if a particular text is available in electronic form, or seeks assistance in identifying fiction containing robots, more closely resembles what is found in a traditional journal such as Notes &amp; Queries. Such communications are in written form, and they are usually meant to be read by a number of anony- mous readers. Discourteous or inexperienced users of listservers sometimes ignore the fact that their messages are being sent to an anonymous audience and address their remarks to a single, often-named user. The anonymity that charac- terizes graffiti and the intimacy of private corre- spondence is virtually impossible to attain in communications over large network systems when distributed via ListServ; the signification of author- ship is virtually inherent in computer communica- tions, given our current system requiring unique identification and password. Already a number of scholarly projects use the Internet to provide access to databases and the specialized applications that allow the information in them to be sorted and searched, such as the</page><page sequence="3">INTRODUCTIONS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND THE SCHOLAR 171 Dante Project at Dartmouth, and ARTFL at the University of Chicago. Undoubtedly many more such enterprises will make use of the Internet, and joining the ranks will be the enterprises being launched to preserve deteriorating books by scanning them and storing them electronically.2 With the dissemination of large textual data- bases via media such as disks, authors and editors lose control over their work: users can generate subsets, modify them according to their own sense of what constitutes improvements, and even change them so as to avoid charges of plagiarism and copyright infringement.3 Publishers, editors, and authors, therefore, at times may want to con- fine access to their electronic text to telecommuni- cations; by such a publication system they can insure the integrity of electronic editions as well as payment for the cost of production. In addition, of course, sometimes very large databases cannot easily be conveyed to users except by computer- based communications, because of file sizes or program requirements, so that for the foreseeable future telecommunications will occupy an impor- tant place in scholarly communication. Theodor H. Nelson has put together a plan for a system that would insure payment of royalties and would provide for world wide communications. His frequently noted Xanadu Project at bottom is an ambitious plan for publication, one based on a hypertext-like arrangement for tying together a composition through its lifetime or evolution, as it grows, is transformed, and used by other authors. Imagine, if you will, the year 2020, when a billion people around the planet are at their screens. And each is able to withdraw from a great repository any fragments of anything that has been published, as well as the private documents he or she has access to. So, you're able to bring to your screen not just encyclopedias, not just novels, not just the works of Horace and Cicero and Marcus Aurelius and Shakespeare and Goethe, but obscure stuff from South America and Africa that people have written in the last 5 minutes. And you're able to make comments and footnotes and to transclude and quote from anything else that's published, with automatic royalty.4 The publishing dimension of telecommunications has spawned another interesting project, albeit one lacking the technically sophisticated appeal of Nelson's. Populist in its conception, and artless in its self-description ("Our goal is to give away one trillion e-text by December 31, 2001") Project Gutenberg is an effort to publish over the Internet, without charge, various texts that might appeal to a wide audience: the King James Bible, the Oedipus Trilogy (in honor of Freud's Birthday), Alice in Wonderland, Moby Dick, and Peter Pan. There seems to be no organizing principle behind the e-texts selected for distribution; the CIA World Factbook, the Book of Mormon, and Paradise Lost were among the twelve publications for 1991. Unfortunately for most scholars the project is not greatly concerned with issues of basic textual accuracy, let alone mark-up systems. The home- spun, naive formulation of its mission has elicited some unkind remarks;" but the Gutenberg Project nevertheless is pioneering the wide area network as a vehicle for publication, and the results of its efforts will add to the evidence suggesting need for the traditional publisher, or some other entity (such as scholarly organizations), to insure that certain standards, such as for textual accuracy, are met. Ultimately, we may discover that an Internet- based system for distribution, together with the donated, institutionally subsidized, labors of au- thors and editors can result in less cost to aca- demic consumers and a greater variety of mate- rials becoming available. Currently Bitnet lists and Internet resources still are not sufficiently tamed to be useable by many scholars, but there are efforts underway to reduce the degree of computer expertise needed to mine the gold that lies in their mysterious caverns. Discussions contained in the Bitnet list PACS-L @UHUPVM1 suggest that there is some interest in recognizing the Internet as a publica- tion, albeit an amorphous one, that might never- theless be subject to cataloging. A number of librarians have composed guides to the on-line public access catalogs (OPACs) of libraries that can be reached by the Internet. Additionally, applications have become available to hide the Unix FTP and Telnet systems from users, such as Hytelnet for the DOS platform (available via Internet from "access.usask.ca") and Eudora for the Macintosh (available via Internet from ftp.cso.uiuc.edu). To cope with the already considerable number of files available through the Internet, McGill University has developed a central database called "Archie." The system maintains a list of several hundred Internet FTP archives, which it updates</page><page sequence="4">172 TERRENCE ERDT regularly. Users can query the Archie database and receive names and descriptions of documents, data sets, and software obtainable through anony- mous FTP (telnet "quiche.cs.mcgill.ca" and login as user "archie"). The Wide Area Information Servers system (WAIS) also allows searching and retrieving multimedia information from a hundred databases worldwide (see the bibliography, /pub/ wais/wais-discussion/bibliography.txt available by FTP from "quake.think.com").6 Unfortunately, relatively few scholars, even the most expert, have yet discovered the Internet; fewer have found the commercially available databases offered by DIALOG and BRS, although their potential benefit to teaching and research in the humanities is considerable. To suggest the extent telecommunications-based resources such as the Internet and Dialog can serve scholars of the humanities, I will outline some of the forays on behalf of my own research. Investigating fictional works of romantic rela- tions between humans and robots/androids, I recently called upon a panoply of resources; not a student of science fiction, I placed a query on the CompuServe science fiction forum - I suppose that such a query might in some modest way resemble the brother Grimm's interrogation of bearers of folktale. The messages from sci fi buffs, which provided several instances of liaisons, new to me in some cases, between machine and men or women. A search of some of the files, or databases, on DIALOG also proved fruitful. Rather than searching a single file such as the bibliography of the Modern Language Associa- tion, or of the electronic version of the Arts and Humanities Citation Index, I chose to explore the dozen or more databases that became available when I searched a collection of humanities files (with the command b humanit). What turned up illustrates one of the remarkable opportunities for serendipity that this kind of research fosters, as well as its tendency to promote interdisciplinary approaches. Included among the databases of the category of files that I selected was Magill's Survey of Cinema (DIALOG file 299), so that although I had not thought to look into films, I found a number of excellent candidates for study, such as Bladerunner, recounted sometimes in excellent articles of several pages. And, turning to the files that opened when I entered those in the "books" category, I uncovered a number of relevant mono- graphs. Eventually, I left an author's query on the electronic forum HUMANIST (which Willard McCartey will discuss in the following pages) and was rewarded with some quite useful additional bibliography. Via the Internet I searched the electronic library catalogs of Berkeley, UCLA, Harvard, and the University of Texas. Searching related topics led me to full text collections of newspapers on-line. Two or three hours of on-line research possibly saved me at least a week of time in a library. Gradually, I suspect, particularly with the addition of materials in full-text, as opposed to abstract and bibliographic citation, Altick's scholar sleuth will add more and more powerful electronic technologies to his collection of tools, and he will search databases that may be located in other parts of the world. He may also spend a lot less time in the library at his home campus, preferring the "virtual library" he creates via resources such as the Internet. Several years ago, Joseph Raben recognized some of the possibilities for the scholar in the availability of large text databases searchable on- line through systems such as DIALOG. He saw that, inevitably, large electronic corpora of texts would be unstructured, so that researchers would indeed have to probe unchartered territories, without benefit of subject headings, and that dis- coveries would be made frequently through seren- dipity.7 His prognostication is not yet true, but it is closer to being true. The essays to follow can be described as reports from the field. They describe largely successful experiments in using computer-based communications to serve scholarly endeavors. In all but one the center of attention falls predomi- nantly upon the electronic discussion groups, or "lists," that exist on the Bitnet network system, which through a program (ListServ) allows for automatically distributing electronic mail and files from one node to another. The essays tend to be interdisciplinary, with the field of communications perhaps receiving the most attention, although only one of the contributors formally represents that discipline.</page><page sequence="5">INTRODUCTIONS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND THE SCHOLAR 173 Notes 1 "Distance education" based upon television transmission has not had much impact upon higher education, but new teleconferencing technology may meet greater success. Using a system such as IBM's "Person to Person," an instructor can communicate with students from his or her computer station, televised images appearing in windows on the computer monitor. There are indications that this technology may be more natural for student and teacher. 2 A likely candidate for dissemination via a system such as the Internet might be the Computerization Project of the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, Spain. See the "Report to the Commission on Preservation and Access" by Hans Riiti- mann and M. Stuart Lynn, Commission on Preservation and Access (Washington, D.C., March 1992). The project involves a gargantuan effort to preserve and make electroni- cally accessible forty-five million documents covering 400 years of Spanish power in the Americas. 3 Theodore F. Brunner noted that such hazards have im- periled the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project in remarks presented to the Computer Assisted Research Group at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature, November 18, 1989, Anaheim, California. 4 "Managing Immense Storage: Project Xanadu Provides a Model for the Possible Future of Mass Storage," Byte (January, 1988) 225 f.
