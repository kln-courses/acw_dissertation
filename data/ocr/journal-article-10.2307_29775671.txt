<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mechanisms of Sperm Competition in Birds When a female bird mates with an extra-pair male, timing and the number of sperm inseminated by each male determine which fathers the most offspring Tim R. Birkhead The springtime image of birds pair? ing up has often been used as a metaphor for human mating behavior. Birds have long been thought of as forming life-long monogamous partner? ships, an ideal to which many people as? pire. But appearances can be deceptive. Far from being models of fidelity, it has been clear for some time that many birds are sexually promiscuous. The first inklings that this might be the case arose with the earliest stirrings of behavioral ecology in the early 1970s. The traditional view of monog? amy was that each partner benefited from mutual cooperation, but behav? ioral ecology's focus on individual se? lection raised the notion that even within a monogamous relationship both males and females should behave selfishly. In a landmark paper pub? lished in 1972 Robert Trivers, then at Harvard, predicted that males should ^^^^^^^^^ Figure 1. Zebra finches, like many other bird species, practice extra-pair matings more often than common wisdom would have you believe. In fact, in many bird species a greater number of off? spring are produced through extra-pair matings than through copulations with the female's true mate. The different, genetically determined coloration of zebra finches can be exploited experi? mentally to determine paternity. A homozygous wild-type gray male produces only wild-type attempt to inseminate the females of other males and hence parasitize their paternal care. By doing so, they could increase their reproductive success? and, because sperm were believed to be cheap, at minimal expense. Females on the other hand were predicted to be coy, since they need to copulate only once to ensure that their eggs are fertil? ized. Moreover, it was thought that in? fidelity was potentially rather costly for a female since her partner would retaliate by reducing his investment in her offspring. At that time there had been relatively few observations of ex? tra-pair behavior of birds, and those that had been made were explained away as nonadaptive (and in highly anthropomorphic terms)?for exam? ple, the males were "sexually dissatis? fied at home." My own involvement in this field had its beginnings in 1970 during a memorable undergraduate lecture in which we were presented the heady cocktail of Trivers's ideas and the re? sults of University of Liverpool ecolo gist Geoff Parker's studies of multiple mating in the yellow dung fly Scatopha ga stercoraria. Parker showed that the sperm competition that results from males copulating with already mated females creates powerful and conflict? ing selection pressures on males. Male dung flies have a suite of adaptations to help them secure multiple matings and a suite of counter-adaptations to help them avoid being cuckolded. These results hung so elegantly on their theoretical framework, and the whole subject area had such a feel of revolution about it, that I knew at that moment that this was what I wanted to work on. With a long-term interest in ornithology, I specifically wondered if these ideas were applicable to birds. 254 American Scientist, Volume 84</page><page sequence="2">offspring when mating with a fawn-colored female (left). Two fawn birds, on the other hand, produce only fawn offspring (right). If a fawn female is inseminated by a male of each type, the paternity of each male's offspring is apparent at hatching. Experiments where females are mated sequentially with two differently colored males have demonstrated that the second male fathers more offspring than does the first. (All paintings and photographs courtesy of the author.) Monogamy Myths The first field studies of sperm compe? tition in birds were essentially obser? vational. They sought to determine whether extra-pair copulations take place in monogamous birds and whether paired males attempt to pro? tect their partner from the sexual ad? vances of other males. Both prove true: Males routinely attempt to copulate with the fertile partners of other males, while at the same time remaining very close to their own female when she is fertile to avoid being cuckolded. It seems hard to believe now, but it was not even known in the mid-1970s whether multiple mating by female birds in the wild could result in multi? ple paternity. While these observation? al studies were in full swing, the new technique of DNA fmgerprmting was developed in the mid-1980s, for the first time enabling researchers to assess parentage unambiguously. Luckily for those of us who study birds, Terry Burke of the University of Leicester and David Parkin of the University of Nottingham were quick to realize the potential of fingerprinting for studies of the mating systems of birds. To date, paternity analyses have been conduct? ed on approximately 100 species of bird, revealing levels of extra-pair pa? ternity that even Trivers and Parker would not have predicted. In some species, such as the superb fairy wren Malurus cyaenus, more than half of all offspring come from extra-pair mat? ings. True monogamy, with zero extra pair paternity, is relatively rare but is evident in some seabirds, such as the fulmar petrel Fulmarus glacialis. These studies show that extra-pair copula? tions do increase the reproductive suc? cess of certain males?sometimes sub? stantially. For example, in the purple Tim Birkhead is professor of behavioral ecology at the University of Sheffield in England. He was awarded his D. Phil, from the Edward Grey Institute, Uni? versity of Oxford, in 1976. He has spent many sum? mers studying seabirds in the Arctic and sperm competition in birds in warmer parts of the world, including zebra finches in Australia. He has written and edited a number of books, including The Cam? bridge Encyclopedia of Ornithology, which he co-edited with M. de L.

Address: Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, The University, Sheffield, S10 2TN, UK. martin Progne subis, a bird familiar to many North Americans, successful cuckolders can double the number of offspring they father. But two major questions remained. First, why do females engage in extra pair copulations? And, second, when they do, what determines which male fathers the offspring? The first of these questions is one that many behavioral ecologists are current? ly trying to answer. In the true tradition of behavioral ecology it is a functional question and concerns the adaptive sig? nificance of females copulating with more than one male during a single re? productive cycle. Although there are plenty of ideas, so far there are no clear answers. A frequent explanation is that females mate with additional males to ensure fertilization, but there is no evi? dence for this. The answer currently at? tracting the most attention, some evi? dence and not a little controversy is that a female gains better genes for her off? spring by performing one or more ex? tra-pair copulations with a male that is of better quality than her partner. We still have a long way to go, however, to demonstrate this unequivocally and in enough species for it to constitute a gen? eral explanation for female infidelity. The second question, concerned with the fertilization success of copula? tions, however, is one where some clear answers are now emerging. What is more, this is a mechanistic question, concerned not with the evolutionary significance of phenomena but with underlying physiological processes. After a long and productive period in which they focused almost exclusively on functional aspects, behavioral ecol? ogists have started to appreciate that by broadening their horizons to in? clude mechanisms, they can look for? ward to a highly productive marriage between these complementary levels of explanation.

Fawn female copulates with a male of each coloration for the same number of times (a), in this experiment, five. Nevertheless, the second male fathers almost 75 percent of the offspring. Sec? ond-male precedence persists (b), even when the odds are skewed to favor the first male. In an experiment identical in design with a, the first male copulates with the female nine times, whereas the second male copulates with her only once. In spite of the 9-to-l ratio, the second male fertilizes more than 50 percent of the eggs. competition in birds provides a nice ex? ample of this fruitful approach. Last-Male Precedence In many organisms, the second of two males to copulate with a female typical? ly fertilizes most of her eggs. This phe? nomenon, known as second- (or last-) male sperm precedence, has been re? ported in insects, crustaceans and birds. A study on chickens conducted in the 1970s reported a particularly strong last male effect: When females were artifi? cially iriseminated just four hours apart with equal numbers of sperm from two genotypes, the second insemination fa? thered about 77 percent of the off? spring?regardless of which genotype's sperm was inseminated first. The pro? posed mechanism was that the sperm from the two successive mserninations remained stratified within the female's sperm store; the last sperm in were the first out and hence fertilized most eggs. investigating the mechanism in detail meant following sperm along the obsta? cle course from insemination to fertiliza? tion. After insemination, only 1 percent of the several millions of sperm ejaculat? ed traverse the intensely hostile vagina and enter the female's sperm-storage tubules. Many of the remaining sperm are ejected with fecal material within minutes of insemination. The sperm that get into the storage tubules remain qui? escent and can fertilize eggs up to 30 days later. Over this time, however, sperm leak out of the tubules at a con? stant rate and are carried up the oviduct to the infundibulum, where fertilization takes place. Fertilization in birds is se? quential: Each egg of a clutch is fertilized separately and, in the case of most small birds, at 24-hour intervals. The ovum is shed from the ovary, usually in the early morning, into the infundibulum. There is then a 15- to 30-minute window dur? ing which fertilization must take place. After that time the protein-rich albumen is laid down around the ovum, prevent? ing further access by sperm. The ovum spends the next 23 hours in the oviduct having water, membranes and shell added before the fully formed egg is laid early the next morning. Within an hour of laying, the next ovum is shed from the ovary, and the cycle repeats itself. Be? tween the laying of one egg and the fer? tilization of the next ovum, the in fundibulum is replenished with sperm from the sperm-storage tubules. Last In, First Out When I started to investigate the mech? anisms of sperm competition in birds, I needed a species that would breed read? ily in captivity?allowing me to control natural matings?but also one that I could observe in the wild to determine whether sperm competition takes place naturally. The zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata was an ideal species. An inhabi? tant of Australia's arid regions and an opportunistic breeder, the zebra finch breeds throughout the year in captivity, given the right conditions. The observations I made of individu? ally marked zebra finches at Richard Zann's study colony in northern Victo? ria, Australia, confirmed that extra-pair copulation was frequent. Subsequent DNA fmgerprinting, performed in col? laboration with Terry Burke and other colleagues, revealed that extra-pair cop? ulations resulted in extra-pair paternity. Despite the technological elegance of DNA fingerprinting, for laboratory work in Sheffield I needed a more rapid technique to assign paternity and decid? ed on the low-tech but tried-and-trusted method of genetic plumage markers. Zebra-finch breeders have developed a number of different color forms whose mode of inheritance is well known. The fawn mutation is sex linked and reces? sive to the wild (gray) type, which means that when a fawn female copu? lates with a fawn male they produce only fawn offspring. But when a fawn female is fertilized by a homozygous gray (wild-type) male, they produce only gray-plumaged offspring. The beauty of this method is that when a fawn female mates with a male of each genotype, the paternity of the offspring is obvious as soon as they hatch. I performed two experiments, both designed to mimic situations that take place naturally in the wild. The first was a mate-switching experiment in which two males replaced each other. Despite each seairing a similar number of copu? lations, the second male fertilized most (75 percent) eggs. This suggested a last male effect, so the second experiment was designed to test simultaneously for this and to determine the efficacy of a single extra-pair copulation. The first male secured about nine copulations on 256 American Scientist, Volume 84</page><page sequence="4">average, but the second male was extra? ordinarily successful and fertilized over half the eggs with just a single insemina? tion. These results confirmed a last-male advantage, and demonstrated the poten? cy of a single extra-pair copulation. Since my results were similar to those reported for chickens, I started to wonder about the "last-in, first-out" system as an ex? planation for last-male precedence. Be? cause the sperm competition experi? ments I was conducting were extremely time-consuming, however, I realized that I could easily spend years conducting empirical tests to figure out the mecha? nism of last-male sperm precedence. Kate Lessells, then at the University of Sheffield and now at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology, and I took a short? cut and built mathematical models of sperm competition to identify the most plausible mechanisms for last-male precedence. Because more was known at that time about the reproductive biol? ogy of the chicken than of the zebra finch, we used information from the chicken studies to test our models. Al? most our first finding was that the last in, first-out system could not account for the 77 percent last-male effect. This strat? ification model, as we called it, predicted that with increasing time since insemi? nation the first male's sperm should fer? tilize more and more offspring, but the empirical data showed that the ratio of offspring remained constant. In addi? tion, we now know that it takes consid? erably longer than four hours for sperm to occupy the sperm storage tubules, providing further evidence for the im plausibility of this mechanism. Our next model, referred to as the passive sperm loss model, predicted a last-male effect simply because by the time the second insemination took place some sperm from the initial insemination had al? ready died or been lost from the female tract. In other words, the outcome of sperm competition depended entirely on the relative numbers of sperm from each male present at the point of fertil? ization. We also rejected this model be? cause the rate at which chickens lose sperm from their reproductive tract is much too slow to explain the observed level of last-male sperm precedence. The only model that came anywhere close to providing a plausible explanation for the 77 percent precedence was a displace? ment model in which sperm from the second insemination displaced sperm from the earlier insemination. The greater the degree of displacement, the greater the last-male advantage. The next stage was an empirical test of the displacement model. A simple test would be to inseminate equal numbers of sperm four hours apart and show that after the second insemination fewer of the first male's sperm remained in the fe? male's sperm-storage tubules. But to do this, one needs to be able to distinguish between the sperm of different males in? side the sperm-storage tubules. At that time there was only a single vital fluo? rescent dye available that would label sperm without obviously affecting their viability When we inseminated females sequentially with labeled and unlabeled sperm, however, the dyed sperm stained the unlabeled sperm, preventing us from distinguishing between the two. It was reassuring but no less frustrating to learn that two other research groups experi? enced the same problem in trying to re? solve this question. Science is supposed to progress in a logical Popperian fashion, but some? times it does not work out like that. On coming up against a brick wall, I changed tack and decided to go back to first principles by repeating the sperm competition experiment using chickens. ^^jB J infundibulum ^jEM^ )) ?

Avian reproductive physiology contains part of the key to the mystery of second-male advantage. From midafternoon onward, the albu? men-covered ovum (or yolk), which has already been fertilized, resides in the uterus where water, membranes and hard egg shell are added (a). By early the next morning, the egg is complete and is laid at about 7:00 a.m. Once the egg is laid, sperm, which have been stored in tubules at the utero vaginal junction, travel unimpeded up the oviduct to the infundibulum, where they wait (b). Within an hour of laying the first egg, the next ovum is shed from the ovary (c). There is a 15- to 30-minute window during which fertilization must take place (d). The fertilized ovum (e) travels down the oviduct, where it will remain for the next 23 hours, as water, membranes and shell are added around it. It is laid the next morning, and so the cycle repeats itself. 1996 May-June 257</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4. Sperm-storage tubules seen close-up in a light microscope appear sausage-shaped. Tubules are located at the utero-vaginal junction and retain sperm for several days following cop? ulation, during which time they constantly leak out and fertilize eggs. These are tubules from the Japanese quail Coturnix japonica (a) and a single sperm-filled tubule from the Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs (b). When we did this and iriseminated fe? males twice four hours apart, we were surprised to detect virtually no last male sperm precedence. Thinking we might have made an error, we repeated the experiment, several times in fact, but on each occasion there was no evidence of a marked last-male precedence. Our results, however, were consistent with the passive sperm-loss model. This then left unresolved the question of why the two sets of sperm-competition experi? ments on chickens gave such different results. The answer, as I subsequently realized, is that the outcome of sperm competition, in the chicken at least, de? pends on the time at which the insemi? nations are made. In the original study the initial insemination was made very close to the time of egg laying, a time we now know results in a relatively low uptake of sperm by the female. There? fore, because the second insemination was performed four hours later, it had a considerable advantage and hence the 77 precent precedence. In our chicken experiments, both mseminations were made at least seven hours after egg lay? ing and hence avoided this particular problem. I have subsequently analyzed published data from other sperm-com? petition experiments with chickens and turkeys, and these are all consistent with the passive sperm-loss model. Encouraged by the success of this model, we then examined the results of our zebra finch experiments to see if they too could be explained by the pas? sive loss of sperm from the female tract. To do this, however, we needed two pieces of information: the numbers of sperm inseminated by males and the rate at which sperm are lost or die in the female tract. We devised an empiri? cal method, using a surrogate female, to determine the number of sperm in? seminated. Using this technique, we found that the time since the last ejacu? lation had an important effect on the numbers of sperm transferred. Males that had not copulated for a week or more, referred to as "rested" males, transferred about 8 million sperm. But since they have limited sperm stores and a relatively low rate of sperm pro? duction, subsequent ejaculates on the same or the next day were much small? er?about 1 million sperm. In the single extra-pair copulation experiment, we used males that had not copulated for at least one week, so these males would have produced a single ejaculate con? taining a large number of sperm. The paired male was also rested when the experiment started, so he would also have produced one large initial ejacu? late followed by a series of smaller ones. To estimate the ratio of sperm from the two males at the time of fertil? ization, however, we also had to take into account that sperm can remain in the sperm-storage tubules for up to 13 days, during which time they constant? ly leak out and can fertilize new eggs. To ascertain the rate of loss of sperm from the tract, we developed a technique used initially by poultry biologists to pre? dict the fertility of eggs. This consisted of counting the sperm trapped in the layers surrounding the yolk?the peri\dtelline layers?of laid eggs. At Ovulation the ovum (the yolk) is released from the ovary into the infundibulum where a number of sperm are present. At this stage the ovum is surrounded by the in? ner perivitelline layer, and within min? utes this is penetrated by one or more sperm at the germinal disc. One of these sperm then fuses with the egg's nucleus, thereby combining paternal and mater? nal DNA. Shortly afterwards the in? fundibulum starts to secrete the outer perivitelline layer, and as it is laid down around the ovum, it traps the other sperm present in the infundibulum. These sperm can be readily seen and counted in a laid egg?the peri\titelline layers are removed from around the yolk, stained with a DNA-specific fluo? rescent dye and examined microscopi? cally. We counted the number of sperm on successive eggs after a single copula? tion and found that numbers declined exponentially, indicating that sperm were lost at a constant rate. Armed with quantitative measures of the number of sperm inseminated and the rate at which they are lost from the female tract, we were able to deteirnine whether they could account for the last male sperm precedence we recorded in our experiments with zebra finches. In? corporating these values into the pas? sive sperm-loss model, it was reassur? ing to find that the fit between what was predicted and what we observed was remarkably close. This means that the relative numbers of sperm from dif? ferent males in the infundibulum at the time of fertilization determines the out? come of sperm competition. Any factor that affects the uptake of sperm by the female tract will therefore influence a 258 American Scientist, Volume 84</page><page sequence="6">a ' ' b ^ ^ ""^ Figure 5. Fertilization triggers the deposition of additional material around the ovum to form the egg. The unfertilized egg (a) exists as an ovum sur? rounded by the inner perivitelline layer. Sperm present in the infundibulum surround the unfertilized egg. Several of these typically penetrate the germinal disc (b), and one fuses with the ovum's nucleus, which houses the female's genes. In this way, male and female genes are merged in the germinal disc. Within minutes of fertilization, the infundibulum secretes an outer perivitelline layer around the egg (c), which traps remaining sperm present in the infundibulum. particular male's chances of fertilizing eggs. The chicken experiments showed that one such factor is the timing of in? semination relative to egg laying?in? seminations close to egg laying were less successful. Another factor that could affect the proportion of sperm reaching the site of fertilization is the quality of the sperm themselves. A Question of Quality Breeders of domestic mammals and birds, and those who work in human in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics, have known for a long time that the motility of a semen sample is a reasonable indi? cator of its likelihood of successfully fertilizing ova. Motility, which usually refers to the proportion of sperm that are actually motile, is, however, a rela? tively crude measure of quality. More recently the ability to measure the ac? tual velocity of individual sperm, us? ing computer-assisted sperm analyses, has provided a much better predictor of fertilizing potential. In our experi? ments with surrogate females we found that the ejaculated sperm from rested males moved at twice the speed (33.4 micrometers per second) as those from the next ejaculate made just one hour later (17.4 micrometers per sec? ond). In addition, a higher proportion of the sperm in a rested male's ejacu? late are morphologically normal than those in subsequent ejaculates. By ex? amining sperm in the male's sperm store, the seminal glomera, we found that sperm appear to mature and gain the potential for high-speed movement as they travel down the male tract. A similar maturation process takes place in the epididymis of male mammals, but with one important difference: Un? like the zebra finch, male mammals never ejaculate immature sperm. The reason for this difference remains to be resolved. If faster-swimming sperm are more likely to traverse the female's hostile vagina and enter the sperm store tubules, it may provide an addi? tional reason why the single copulation from a rested male zebra finch was so first insemination second insemination Figure 6.

The strat? ification model, shown above, relies on a first-in, first-out principle. After a single insemination, the first male fertilizes all of the eggs (blue). The second male's sperm (brown) is assumed to remain stratified in the sperm-storage tubules in such a way that it is closer to the exit. In this way, the sec? ond male's sperm is the first out of the tubule, and fertilizes most of the female's eggs, until it is used up. Then any remaining viable sperm from the first copulation can fertilize eggs. 1996 May-June 259</page><page sequence="7">first second second insemination Figure 7. Passive sperm-loss model assumes that sperm from both males are mixed within the sperm-storage tubules. This model assumes that by the time the second male's insemination is made (brown), sperm from the first male (blue) have died or have been lost from the female tract The second male, therefore, is more likely to fertilize the eggs after this point. This model is il? lustrated another way in the upper graph. Sperm from each insemination are lost at a constant rate, indicated by the slopes of the lines. Because the ratio of sperm from each male remains con? stant over time, this model predicts that the relative number of offspring from each male also re? mains constant over time. first insemination Figure 8. Displacement model suggests that the limited volume of the sperm-storage tubules accounts for the second-male precedence. This model predicts that incoming sperm from the second male (brown) displace sperm previously stored sperm from copulation with the first male (blue). successful in fertilizing eggs. We are currently mvestigating this. Across the animal kingdom the origi? nal view was that sperm competition has been driven primarily by selection on males. It is clear that by safeguarding their own paternity and fertilizing other females, males increase their reproduc? tive output. In contrast, the only benefit socially monogamous females were thought to obtain from copulating with more than one male was an increase in the quality of her offspring. The view that selection operates more intensively on males than on females in terms of sperm competition has been questioned in recent years, and there is now consid? erable focus on female strategies. Al? though males of a few species (for exam? ple, mallard ducks Anas platyrhynchos) are able to force copulations on females, the evidence that females generally con? trol extra-pair behavior in birds is incon? trovertible. For example, field studies of the purple martin and blue tit Parus caeruleus, both socially monogamous species, reveal that females actively seek and initiate extra-pair copulations with males that are of better quality than their partner. Similarly, studies of zebra finch? es in captivity also indicate that females prefer males with certain characteristics (for example, with a high song rate and a particularly red beak) as extra-pair part? ners. How they benefit from this behav? ioral choice of copulation partner is still unknown. We tested the idea that zebra finches with these particular phenotypic traits might also produce fast moving, high-quality sperm but found no evi? dence for such an effect. In addition to controlling events be haviorally, females that have mated with several males may also have the physiological ability to favor the sperm of one male over another's. Since fertil? ization takes place inside the female's body, it seems reasonable that selection will act particularly strongly to give them the ultimate control. Whether fe? males have the physiological ability to determine paternity in this way, re? ferred to as cryptic choice, remains to be seen, but there are some indications that they might. One of the most remarkable examples concerns an organism about as urcbird like as you can imagine. In the comb-jelly (ctenophore) beroe, several sperm typi? cally penetrate the ovum (a phenome? non referred to as polyspermy, which also occurs in birds), and the egg's nucle? us moves around the cytoplasm visiting 260 American Scientist, Volume 84</page><page sequence="8">E &amp; O 03 I I I I I I I I I I 0600 0800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 2200 2300 time of day Figure 9. Time of egg-laying can profoundly affect second-male precedence. An early study with chickens demonstrated an unusually strong last male sperm precedence when inseminations were only four hours apart. It was known at the time that inseminations made up to 90 minutes be? fore egg laying (yellow zone), had a low chance of fertilization, but it was assumed that those made soon after laying had as good a chance as those made later. However, the uptake of sperm by the female tract (red line) is reduced for approximately 90 minutes on either side of egg laying ?hence the reduced success of initial inseminations and the strong last-male effect (blue line). In the author's experiments, researchers inseminated females as far away from egg laying as possible (brown line). Sperm uptake by females was high for both inseminations. (For the blue and brown lines, "1" indicates the point at which the first insemination is made; "2" indicates the point at which the second is made.) each of the sperm nuclei before fusing with one. In birds the potential for fe? male choice is considerable: Over 99 per? cent of the sperm a male inseminates is rejected by the female. By modifying the degree of rejection only slightly one way or the other, a female could change the odds in the fertilization stakes consider? ably, but whether she has the ability to do this remains to be seen. All of this raises the perplexing ques? tion of why a female should bother to pair up with a male only to go off and mate with another later? Several possi? ble answers have presented themselves. An attractive possibility is that the extra-pair male helps rear the off? spring, but no evidence exists to sug? gest this is true. A second possibility is that the female gets a valuable item? food, for example?in exchange for services rendered. But this theory also lacks evidence. It has been suggested that females mate with other males when their partner's sperm count is low, but there is no evidence for this. So it seems that many scientists are left with a single possible explanation. Fe? males are looking for higher quality males to father their offspring. Why doesn't the female just choose the high? est-quality male to be her mate in the first place? That is not always possible, as the example of migratory birds, such as swal? lows, shows. Males generally arrive at the breeding grounds a few days before fe? males do. The first females to return have the pick of all the males and generally se? lect the highest quality. Later-returning females have fewer good choices left to them, and the last females to return have the poorest choices. Rather than forego? ing her chance to breed at all that season, the late-retuming female takes a poor quality male as her mate. But she doesn't have to completely forgo the chance to have some higher-quality offspring, and so she engages in extra-pair mating. It is hard to tell what constitutes high quality for birds. In swallows, it is the length and symmetry of the tail. Studies have shown that females paired to males with short and asymmetric tails seek ex? tra-pair matings from males whose tails are longer and more symmetric. Studies have also shown that the ex? tra-pair matings are responsible for pro 100 ?I-=-.-., ... . , -, p^pS^ single extra-pair copulation 80 ? f^:^^^^^^^^^^Bra|j^^^^^^^^^^K ^^^^^^^^^^B ______________ ^^^H^M _____ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^IS^^^^^^^^^^^^^K^''-'-*^ __________________________? ^^^^^^^^^^^H iP^^^^^^^^^^^v5s!^^^^^^^^^^^B':*' ____________________________! ____________________________! o ______H___^_n_______________________________ Figure 10. Experiments with zebra finches have produced data that coincide remarkably with those predicted by the passive sperm-loss model. The second male in the experiment described in Figure 2a is predicted to father about 75 percent of the offspring, which is very similar to the observed value (left two bars).

Females of many species routinely copulate with more than one male, but in only a small pro? portion of species are the processes that determine which males father offspring understood. Just as in birds, in many in? sects the last male to copulate fertilizes most eggs. In dragonflies and dam selflies the mechanism is brutally simple; before inseminating his own sperm, the male scrapes out any previously stored sperm using minute hooks on his penis. In the ghost crab Inachus phalangium, the last male also has precedence, but he uses a different trick. Before transferring sperm to a female, he introduces highly modified seminal fluid that sets hard and seals off previously inseminated sperm at the back of the female's sperm store. In the majority of invertebrates, however, the mechanisms by which last-male precedence is achieved are more compli? cated. In the yellow dungfly it is thought that the incoming sperm displace and flush out some of the sperm from previ? ous matings. Molecular studies of paternity have demonstrated that sperm competition also takes place in mammals?includ? ing apparently monogamous species like ourselves. Studies of the inheri? tance of human disease have revealed a number of mismatches?many of which can be explained only by extra pair fertilization. None of the paternity data for people have been formally published, but the figures apparently suggest that between one in ten to one in twenty offspring are the result of ex? tra-pair matings. The mechanics of fer? tilization success in mammals is fun? damentally different from that in birds. First, if a female ovulates more than a single ovum, the eggs are fertilized at virtually the same time (not on differ? ent days, as in birds). Second, there is no consistent last-male effect. In fact, all combinations of effects occur? sometimes the first male wins, some? times it is the second male. The reason for this is that in mammals, timing is everything. Unlike birds, the fertilizing lifespan of mammalian sperm is short and they also have to undergo capaci tation, the physiological preparation for fertilization. Because ova also re? main fertilizable for only a short time, to have a good chance of fertilization, a male must time his copulations so that his sperm have undergone capacitation just at the time the female ovulates and the ovum is ready to be fertilized.
