Produced ca. 1300, in all probability for a Dominican nun, the manu- script provides a simulacrum of the contemplative ascent that cul- minates in a total of twenty Trinitarian miniatures. The Trinitarian images constitute by far the largest group of images in the manuscript devoted to the elaboration of a single subject (figs. 1-6). Simply in their scope and inexhaustible inventiveness, they give expression to the plenitude of the Godhead. The Trinitarian miniatures embody a double paradox. One paradox, the Trinity itself, they represent; the other, they enact. On the one hand, the miniatures attempt to make us see that which cannot be seen, to depict that which is above all images. In theolog- ical terms, they are images of the Exemplar of all images. On the other hand, they provide a simulacrum of the visio Dei, the ultimate vision to which the mystic aspires, yet which cannot be seen, at least not in this life. In addition to representing an ineffable mystery, the miniatures enact the process of mystical vision. The primary object of representation is not the Trinity itself; God is ultimately beyond the grasp of representation. The real subject is the climactic en- counter between the viewer and the image as a simulacrum of the en- counter between God and the soul. The visionary effect of the miniatures depends in large measure on the interwoven forms of veils, suns, and flames, which together create an extended drama of revelation and concealment. The imagery of light- the blazing suns and streaming rays - combined with the im- agery of veils represent God as an unapproachable light shrouded in darkness, both accessible and invisible to the eye. Blindness and vi- sion, velatio and revelatio, are inextricable. The artist, moreover, ex- plicitly identifies the eye's confrontation with the miniatures and the experience of visionary phenomena. On each of the text pages, a figure in a vignette - perhaps a prophet, but more likely a seer or visionary - reels back in awe or crouches and cringes as if in fear of Yale University Library Gazette 1 3 4 Supplement to Vol. 66</page><page sequence="2">Fig. ι.

The seers enact the response of the viewer, whom they encourage to react to the miniatures as if they were visions. Their astonishment, translated into extravagant, contorted gestures, recalls the reactions of wit- nesses at sanctioned moments of epiphany, for example the Ascen- sion, in which the Apostles often appear as if dancing with upraised hands. The principal models for the seers, however, are shepherds, spe- cifically the rustics who shield themselves from the claritas Dei at the moment of the Annuciation (Luke 2:9). Although the shepherds are transformed into awe-struck vessels of inspiration, their bucolic headgear- rimmed caps and floppy hoods - testifies to their humble origins, as do their crutches and club-headed canes, which support them as they reel before the apparitions on the opposite page (figs. 9, 12). The borrowings denote the figures as witnesses to divine reve- lation, but they also identify our perception of the miniatures as mo- ments of vision, both by analogy and by example. The seers not only represent a set of exemplary reactions to visionary experience, they enact that process for the viewer. A specific motif makes the artist's strategy explicit. Imitating a gesture frequently found in depictions of the Annunciation to the Shepherds, several seers raise the hems of their garments, covering their hands with cloth. Some of the seers parody the gesture quite closely (ff. 37V, 49V, 76V), whereas others exaggerate it wildly. For example, the figure in the vignette on f . 71V pulls his cloak over his head with a dramatic sweeping gesture (fig. 11). Detached from its original context, the gesture of veiling acquires a new resonance. The veils refer not only to the seers' clouded, prophetic vision, but directly to the veils that play so prominent a role in the Trinitarian miniatures. The actions and gestures of the seers are metaphors for the process of vision experienced by the reader of the manuscript. Like the seers, the reader views each full- page miniature as if it were a vision. The object of vision, however- the Trinity- is only half revealed. The viewer struggles to make out its forms behind the veil of twisted and knotted cloth. In addition to providing a simulacrum of a visionary subject, in this case the Trinity, the miniature also provides a simulacrum of visionary ex- perience. The Rothschild Canticles also associates the viewer's experience with a visionary account of archetypal authority, the revelation of Saint John on the island of Patmos. The Evangelist's appearance op- posite two subjects inspired by the Book of Revelation, the Adoration 141</page><page sequence="9">of the Lamb and the Mulier amicta sole, indicates that the artist deliberately adapted the imagery of John as the inspired seer (figs, 7, ίο). Unlike the other vignette figures, John is bareheaded; his halo and the lectern with an open book identify him as the Evangelist. On f. 63V, John looks up from his lectern and points to a cloud in the upper right-hand corner of the miniature; on f . 12 ν he not only points upward, he also turns away from the lectern, a pose that specifically identifies him as the inspired Evangelist.1 The pose is elaborated in numerous other vignettes. Four other seers in the Rothschild Can- ticles sit at lecterns with open books, but turn back toward the full- page miniature just as John turns back toward the vision of the Apoc- alypse (ff . 22V, 54V, 58V, 67V; fig. 8). The transferral of meaning from the Evangelist type to the prophet in the Rothschild Canticles is not exact, however. Whereas the Evangelist interrupts his writing, the seers in the Rothschild Canticles interrupt their reading. Their pro- gress from reading to vision, from lectio to contemplatio, parallels the progress of the reader of the Rothschild Canticles who turns from the text on the left to the miniature on the right. The artist could not have found a more effective way of identifying the miniatures with visions. With extraordinary inventiveness, the artist dispenses with the crude anthropomorphic representations traditionally used to represent the Trinity. Instead, he employs forms rich in theophanic and cosmolog- ical associations which themselves suggest the mysterious nature of the Godhead and its inner relations. Anthropomorphic forms are gradually obscured and obliterated, forcing the viewer to abandon any human likeness of the Deity. The three Persons appear most prominently in the first few images, only to diminish until they ulti- mately disappear altogether. It is as if the Persons go into hiding. The process of turning the pages resembles the viewing of a kaleidoscope in which the Trinity appears in ever-changing configurations. The transition from human to ahuman likenesses is especially swift in the first series of Trinitarian miniatures. In the first miniature, on f . 4or, the Triune God appears as a full-length figure holding three suns (fig. 1). The figure's arms are crossed, a premonition of the formal entanglements of the ensuing miniatures. The face of God is covered by streaming golden rays. The striking image recalls a Trinitarian vision in the Speculum of Marguerite d'Oingt (d. 1310), prioress of the Carthusian convent of Poleteins near Lyons, all the more so because Marguerite locates her vision within the opening of a book:2 142</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 7.

Inside, this book was like a beautiful mirror, and there were only two pages ... In this book appeared a delightful place, so large that the entire world is but a little thing by comparison. In this place appeared a most glorious light which divided itself into three parts, as if in three persons, but of that no person can tell. Marguerite indicates that her vision was prompted by her customary meditations, but one cannot infer that her prayer book was illus- trated, let alone with an image comparable to that on f . 4or of the Rothschild Canticles. In the visual arts there is but one precedent for this striking miniature, a unique representation of the Throne of Mercy in an English Psalter, now at Trinity College, Cambridge, in which the transcendence of God the Father is distinguished from the humanity of the crucified Christ by a light-filled quatrefoil covering the Father's face.3 In the Rothschild Canticles, the three Persons appear in human form only briefly. Although clearly distinguished in the second miniature on f. 42r, they are nonetheless reduced to disembodied heads, each of which emits a corolla of immaterial light. On f . 44r, the third and final miniature of the first Trinitarian series, human likenesses are excluded entirely. The Godhead assumes the perfect form of a circle of light with flames that quite literally embrace its circumference (fig. 13). A similar sequence obtains in the second, more extended series of Trinitarian miniatures. At first the three Persons are distinct (f . 751), but as the Trinity gradually closes in on itself, the impression of unity predominates. Already in the second miniature, the three Persons are enclosed in a ringlet of cloth, which they lift as if to prevent it from obscuring the view (fig. 2). The group straddles a sun placed at the perigee of an elliptical cloud. In the upper corners, two censing angels identify the cloud-enclosed area as a heavenly space. The overall effect is of a Baroque stage prop, a device to create a theatrical epiphany. The process of enclosure and withdrawal continues in the following miniatures. When the viewer turns the page (f . 7çr), the ellipse of clouds closes to a circle. Only the Dove remains wholly visible. Christ merely peeks from behind the sun on the left and God the Fa- ther disappears altogether. In the next miniature (f . 8ir), the figures reappear, but are drawn so closely together that their forms are hardly distinct. The large sun becomes the dominant, unifying ele- ment. The Persons gradually disappear within a vortex of veils and 144</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 13. Folio 44Γ *45</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 14. Folio 84Γ 14Ó</page><page sequence="14">light. A few folios later (f . 841*), they are embedded in a long winding sheet, a triangular interlace textile forming three connected loops (fig. 14). The loose ends of the cloth ingeniously suggest the wings of the Dove. The flares of three suns lock the Persons together like the teeth of so many cogwheels. Turning to the next miniature (f . 88r), we find that the knot has been tightened, leaving visible only the face of one figure. Toward the end of the sequence, the imagery of light ceases to be an expansive, outward-moving force. It also turns in on itself, radi- ating toward the center of the images. On f. çór, the flames of the innermost circle radiate outward; those of the intermediary circle point inward, intermeshing with the first set (fig. 4). Centrifugal and centripetal forces are in balance. Eventually, the flames turn uni- formly inward, radiating toward the center. Instead of flares, the flames appear like the spokes of an elaborate clockwork in which the Persons are caged. The penultimate miniature, f . io4r, gives the im- pression of a Trinitarian implosion (fig. 5). The three figures are ob- scured not only by the small circling suns, but by the circle itself. Light streams toward the point at the center. In the final miniature the viewer returns to a radiant stasis (fig. 6). Clouds and veils part to reveal three self-contained circles filled with light, reminiscent of the concluding vision of Dante's Paradiso. The artist of the Rothschild Canticles might have drawn a simple equation between veils and light and the dialectic between conceal- ment and revelation. Each type of imagery is however used in a much more complex and paradoxical manner. Light is made to conceal as much as it exposes, and veils uncover as well as protect. Whereas in most of the miniatures the knotted cloths obscure vision, at the end of the sequence the veils take the form of curtains that are pulled aside. The border of the miniature acts as a frame to which the cur- tains are attached in a series of loops, as if to curtain rods. Even here, the artist introduces an element of the unexpected. The curtains are not suspended from the top of the frame, but instead "fall·' from the sides. They are held back by two asymmetrical arcs of clouds, the parallel curves of which contradict the otherwise uniformly concen- tric system of circles. The image deliberately defies the laws of gravity. Up and down lose their meaning; the viewer enters a space in which no place is privileged except the center. With this miniature, the Rothschild Canticles ends, like the mystical ascent itself, in a coin- cidence of opposites: darkness and light, blindness and vision, the imageless and the image. Rather than resolve the paradoxes, the final 147</page><page sequence="15">pair of text and miniature presents them in the most irresolvable form. A refulgent vision of Trinitarian unity confronts the classic for- mulation of the inaccessibility of the Godhead, John the Evangelist's affirmation that "no man has seen God at any time" (John 1:18). Johns words echo Exodus 33:20, where Yahweh tells Moses that no man can see Him and live. The final Trinitarian miniature offers what the text would deny, an intimation of the ultimate object of vision. For all of its daring, however, the Rothschild Canticles does not en- tirely disregard the Evangelist's strictures. The closing text of the Trinitarian section provides a curious reenactment of the encounter between God and Moses. Saint Bernard replaces Moses as the Lord's confidant and the archetypal mystagogue. Standing in for the reader, who at the moment of greatest proximity is suddenly placed at a dis- tance, Bernard prays, "Lord, lead me to where you are" (f . 105V). Not surprisingly, God replies with a paradox: "Bernard, I cannot do that, for if I were to lead you to where I am, you would be annihilated for me and for you."4 The complete union of God and the soul would negate the very conception of God. Even for the mystic, God must always remain something other, apart from the self. A book in which text and images give vent to an uninhibited longing for mys- tical union concludes by denying the ultimate consummation. To the straightforward opposition between blindness and sight, faith and vision, the Rothschild Canticles adds a third, paradoxical term, the blinding light of interior illumination. In the culminating invocation of the Rothschild Canticles, illumination itself is de- scribed as a form of blindness: "Lord, lead me into the desert of your Godhead and the shadow of your light and lead me to where you are not." The compiler uses the oxymoronic language of negative the- ology to express the absolute transcendence of the Godhead. God is unapproachable light, His being so exalted that His dwelling place can be described only as the place where God is not. The Godhead is a "desert," a wasteland, a nothingness or "No-thing" beyond all human categories.5 Negative or apophatic theology takes as its premise the inability of human language to describe the Godhead. Not only is God greater than anything man can conceive, He is above and beyond all predi- cation. All that can be said of God is that He is. Three times the Trinitarian text cites God's own statement of his absolute transcen- dence: "I am who I am" (Exodus 3:14). No term, nor its negation, suffices as a description of God. God transcends all speech. A passage near the end of the Trinitarian section simply states, "He speaks best 148</page><page sequence="16">and most beautifully who keeps silent concerning God" (f. 101v).6 The text concludes by recommending silence. The sources of the apophatic terminology in the Rothschild Canti- cles are difficult to pinpoint. The writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, in particular the De divinis nominibus and De mystica theologia, are the classic formulation of negative theology and had a lasting influence on theology and mysticism in the West. Yet the compiler need not have known Pseudo-Dionysius directly. Of pri- mary importance as a source are selected passages in Augustine's De Trinitate. Although Augustine could not have known Pseudo- Dionysius, many of his formulations in De Trinitate were easily as- similated to a Pseudo-Dionysian point of view, and it appears that the compiler of the Rothschild Canticles approached Augustine in this spirit. A passage from De Trinitate (7.2.3) on f. 76V provides an exemplary demonstration of negative theology: For it is no small part of knowledge if we aspire from this depth to that height, namely, if before we can know what God is, we can already know what he is not. For assuredly He is neither earth nor heaven, nor as earth and heaven, nor any such thing as we see in heaven, nor any such thing as we do not see, and is perhaps in the heaven. Even if by the power of your imagination you magnify the light of the sun in your mind as much as you are able, either that it may be greater or that it may be brighter, a thousand times as much or innumerable times, yet even this is not God.7 Gods perfection transcends all names, all categories, and all human faculties. Augustinian sources alone, however, cannot account for the sys- tematic application of negative theology in the Rothschild Canticles. The pervasive and subtle presence of apophatic formulas assumes an environment in which Dionysian ideas were current, even familiar. Although hardly restricted to any particular region, the influence of Pseudo-Dionysius was felt with particular force in Germany, espe- cially in the Rhineland. Perhaps the closest analogies to the apo- phatic formulations in the Rothschild Canticles are found in the writings of Meister Eckhart (ca. 1260-1328), who makes extensive use of Pseudo-Dionysius. A passage from one of the German sermons takes the conversion of Saul as its point of departure: "Paul rose from the ground and with open eyes saw nothing." ... He saw nothing, that is God. God is a nothing and God is something. What is something is also nothing. What God is, that He is entirely. Concerning this the illumined Dionysius, in writing about God, says: "He is above 149</page><page sequence="17">being, above life, above light." He attributes to Him neither this nor that, but makes Him out to be I know not what that far transcends these . . . Whoever says God is there, do not believe him. The light that God is shines in the darkness. God is the true light: to see it, one must be blind and must strip from God all that is "something." . . . When the soul is unified and there enters into total self-abnegation, then she finds God as in Nothing.8 With a delight in negation and inversion that reflects his Dionysian sources, Eckhart makes the blinding of Paul a moment of penetrating vision. As in the Rothschild Canticles, opposites converge: light and dark, blindness and insight. Decisive evidence of the importance of Pseudo-Dionysius comes from two texts added on blank folios at the end of the manuscript (ff. íSçr-içor). Both are excerpts from Bonaventuras Itinerarium mentis in deum, a treatise laden with terminology borrowed from the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius. The first excerpt from the Itinerarium takes up the imagery of blindness and vision (5.4-5), comparing man's cognition of God to the proverbial blindness of a bat in day- light. The second excerpt (7.5-6), part of the closing prayer, summa- rizes the steps of the contemplative ascent: And you, my friend, in this matter of mystical visions, redouble your efforts, abandon the senses, intellectual activities, visible and invisible things - everything that is not and that is - and, oblivious of yourself, let yourself be brought back, in so far as it is possible, to unity with Him Who is above all essence and all knowledge. And transcending yourself and all things, ascend to the superessential gleam of the divine darkness by an incommeasurable and absolute transport of a pure mind.9 Bonaventure in fact cites John the Scot's translation of De mystica theologia, book 1, chapter 1. And although Bonaventure does not specify his source, whoever added the excerpts was sufficiently versed in theology not only to recognize the reference, but also to embellish it. In a Ripuarian dialect that can be localized to the region of Co- logne,10 the annotator paraphrases a separate passage from the same section of De mystica theologia, repeating the Pseudo-Areopagite's caution to his disciple Timothy: "Dear friend Timothy, see that no one unlearned hears these things" (f. içor).11 The additions to the Rothschild Canticles present the two faces of mystagogy. On the one hand, the annotator initiates the reader into religious mysteries, while on the other, he fends off the "unlearned" who are incapable of understanding them. He plays both guide and hierophant. Whereas the excerpts from the Itinerarium direct the mystic on his way to God, the paraphrase of Pseudo-Dionysius en- 130</page><page sequence="18">sures that the mysteries are not profaned by the inept outsider. Di- onysius asks Timothy to ensure that his treatise not fall into the hands of those incapable of understanding it. The anno ta tor of the Rothschild Canticles felt that the manuscript contained similar se- crets and added Dionysius' warning so as to insure that it too might not be profaned. In Ε. Η. Gombrich's words, "to the profane these enigmatic images conceal the holy arcanum of the supernatural; to the initiate, however, they serve as the first rung of the ladder through which we ascend to the Divine/'12 The most daring feature of the Trinitarian section is the extent to which it applies this theory of mystical perception to the visual as well as to the biblical image. In the sequence of Trinitarian minia- tures, which progress from anthropomorphic images to abstract, geometric ones, human representatives of the Triune God are shown, in fact, to be "unlike" images that fail to represent their sacred object. The Trinity is paradoxically revealed as it is systematically distorted, obscured, and ultimately negated. The sequence of miniatures pro- vides a simulacrum of contemplative progress in visual terms analo- gous to the apophatic ascent outlined by Pseudo-Dionysius. The imagery of veils and cloths in the Trinitarian miniatures en- hances their effect of visionary immediacy. The veils are rich in em- blematic associations, some of them rooted in the Bible. On f . 8ov, the text of the Rothschild Canticles itself refers to cloths, citing the woman with the issue of blood (Matthew 9:21, Luke 8:44) who says of Christ: "If I shall touch only his garment, I shall be healed" (fig. 3). The miracle refers to faith, specifically to faith in the unseen truth hidden behind physical appearances, a meaning elaborated in the rest of the text. Two figures in the adjoining miniature touch the ends of the braided cloth enclosing the Trinity. The context suggests that in touching the cloth they demonstrate their faith not only in Christ, but also in the need for allegorical interpretation. The cloth refers to outer appearances, whether of the Divinity or of Scripture, two meanings linked in a celebrated passage from the Expositiones in Ier- archiam Coelestem by John the Scot: All images of visible and invisible creatures and all allegories . . . are coverings of the paternal ray, and the ray himself according to his flesh is the greatest veil of himself according to the deity and a veil connatural with us.13 Both Creation and Scripture are veils covering the light of the God- head, but Christ Himself is the "maximum velamen." Christ's flesh *5*</page><page sequence="19">covers His divinity. The mystic resembles the woman with the issue of blood who "sees through" the veil of appearances, whether the physical veil of the flesh or the literal veil of Scripture. In identifying the literal sense of Scripture as a "sacred covering/' the Rothschild Canticles conforms to a long tradition of exegesis. The image of the veil as both a barrier and an enticement, a shield as well as a boundary, finds its most extensive elaboration in imagery of the Old Testament tabernacle of the Ark, rent in two at the Crucifixion to admit the light of the New Dispensation. Entry into the tabernacle shrine was the goal, whether of the reader seeking to penetrate the obscure meanings of Scripture or of the contemplative in search of God, meanings first conjoined by Paul in the Epistle to the Hebrews (10:19-22). The interior of the tabernacle veiled by curtains provided a potent metaphor for mystical and visionary activity. Bonaventure employs the motif,14 as does Meister Eckhart who states: 'The soul that loves God takes hold of him under the garment of goodness. In- tellect draws this garment of goodness off God and takes him bare, where He is stripped of goodness and being and names/'15 The image also provides the governing metaphor for the cloth and curtain imagery in the Trinitarian miniatures. In turning the pages of the Trinitarian section of the Rothschild Canticles, the viewer takes the place of Moses before the tabernacle. As the imagery of veils gives way to the imagery of light, the viewer enters farther into the holiest recesses of the sanctum sanctorum. In the final miniature, the viewer stands at the threshold of the hiding place of the Deus absconditus, described by Eckhart as a kleithuse, or divine vestiary, none other than the interior of the tabernacle.16 The Rothschild Canticles is not alone in parlaying the terminology of veiled meaning into striking visual images. Other examples in- clude frontispieces in Carolingian Bibles and Gospel books17 and a lost window from the east end of the Abbey of Saint Denis.18 For the peculiar imagery of the Rothschild Canticles, however, the most im- portant analogy occurs in the Hours of Jeanne of Navarre, a Book of Hours made in Paris around 1335 (Bibliothèque Nationale, MS η. a. lat. 3145, f. 25r). The miniature in the Hours of Jeanne of Navarre (fig. 15) represents the intimate meeting place where God speaks to Moses "face to face, as a man is wont to speak to his friend" (Exodus 33:11). Holding an orb inscribed with the Alpha and Omega in his left hand and raising his right hand in blessing, the Lord sits on the "throne of mercy" as described in Exodus 25-26. Two cherubs, their heads turned inward to face one another, support the "mercy seat," 132</page><page sequence="20">Fig. 15.

Whereas in the miniature on f . S^r of the Rothschild Canticles the wings of the Holy Spirit are identified with the tabernacle veil by means of a visual pun, in the Hours of Jeanne of Navarre the artist, recently identified as Jean le Noir, associates the veil with the wings of the guardian cherubs through the use of color.19 Three passages in Exodus (25:4, 26:1, and 26:31) specify the colors of the tabernacle veil as blue, purple, and scarlet; in the miniature of f . 25r of the Hours of Jeanne of Navarre, the pairs of wings enveloping the cherubs are painted blue, purple, and vermilion. The variation in the coloration of the paired wings - from top to bottom they are purple, vermilion, and blue for the cherub on the left and vermilion, blue, and purple for the cherub on the right- represents an attempt to illustrate as literally as possible the description in Exodus 26:1: "ten curtains of fine twisted linen, and violet and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, diversified with embroidery" (literally "plumario," "embroidery with soft feathers"). Artists seldom followed this description exactly; a rare example is provided by a miniature in a manuscript of Nicholas of Lyra's com- mentary on Exodus.20 In the commentary, the artist depicts the ten colored curtains, whereas in the Hours, it is the "plumage" of the cherubim that takes on not only the function of the tabernacle veil, but also its coloration. The curtain itself is reduced to two knotted cloths suspended from the necks of the cherubim, a motif that occa- sionally occurs elsewhere, for example in manuscripts of the Bible moralisée.21 The knots or loops represent the "twined" or "twisted" linen, the "byssus retorta," of the tabernacle veil. In the final analysis, however, the Trinitarian miniatures of the Rothschild Canticles are distinguished less by the intricacy of their symbolism than by the consummate artistry with which the series as a whole makes a direct and sustained appeal to the eye. The minia- tures have an immediate, visionary effect. Comparison with a minia- ture for Psalm 97 in a Flemish Psalter of the twelfth century (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, MS lat. 238, f . 114V) underscores the innova- tive relationship between viewer and miniature in the Rothschild Canticles.22 A curtain suspended from the quatrilobe frame is pulled back to afford the spectator a view of Christ in Majesty. In keeping with the conventions of medieval art, however, the curtain would not obscure the view, even when closed. The line of sight passing through the veil to Christ is conceptual rather than actual; the viewer does not experience for himself or herself the process of revelation. The 154</page><page sequence="22">Fig. 16. Strasbourg, Bibliothèque Nationale et Universitaire, MS 2929, Life of Suso, f. 82Γ *55 ■::rv % Η* , 1 y- ■. -iff 3-</page><page sequence="23">miniature depicts a visionary subject without resorting to the visual game of mystical "hide and seek" used in the Rothschild Canticles. A drawing in the manuscript life of Suso (Strasbourg, Bibliothèque Nationale et Universitaire, MS 2929, f. 82r) is closer to the Rothschild Canticles in both date and context. Probably based on Suso's own de- sign, it encapsulates in didactic form a mystical progression similar to the one set out in the Rothschild Canticles (fig. 16). 23 The soul begins its journey in the upper right-hand corner with the Trinity, to which it eventually returns, a reunion depicted as a passage from the three persons, through the tabernacle veil, and into the Godhead, represented, as on f . io6r of the Rothschild Canticles, by three con- centric circles. The inscription reads, in part, "Ich bin in got ver- gangen, nieman kan mich hie erlangen." Whereas Suso relies on two traditional medieval modes of representation, personification and di- agrammatic exposition, the artist of the Rothschild Canticles creates a mystical image that allows the worshipper to see "in a flash" what Suso's reader must construct step by step. The drawings in Suso's vita originally were conceived as devotional and didactic aids for the nuns supervised by the Dominican mystic in the context of the cura monialium.24 Foremost among these women was Elsbeth Stagel, abbess of the convent of Töss in the region of Constance.25 The relationship between Stagel and Suso provides us with a model for the type of relationship that probably existed be- tween the author of the Rothschild Canticles and the nun for whom it was made. The annotator, in all probability a Dominican versed in Pseudo-Dionysian texts, warns his spiritual daughter using the very words with which the Areopagite had cautioned his own dis- ciple, Timothy. Suso is in fact quite explicit about the purpose of mystical imagery. In chapter 53, he speaks of the "three circles" that "represent the three Persons."26 Describing the process of mystical union, he refers to the soul "loosed from all creaturely attachments, penetrating deeper into the circle of the Godhead ... to arrive at spiritual maturity." Suso even makes explicit reference to the use and function of imagery in mystical devotions. On the one hand, he tells his pupil, the nun Stagel, that "all these comparisons of formless and inexpressible ideas to tangible objects are as unlike the bare truth as is the complexion of a black man to a shining sunbeam." Such state- ments, however, are countered by Suso's assertion that he will*"drive out images with images," and that "without sacrificing truth" he will nevertheless "show with images and likeness-giving speech, as faith- fully as is possible, how these same imageless concepts in the truth i56</page><page sequence="24">are to be understood/'27 To suggest the imageless by means of images is also the purpose of the miniatures in the Rothschild Can- ticles. Suso and the artist of the Rothschild Canticles use verbal and visual imagery derived from the same metaphors to achieve a common end. Even more than the illustrations to Suso's autobiog- raphy, however, the Rothschild Canticles presents dramatic evidence of the newfound equality of text and image as vehicles of mystical elevation. Text and image are presented as analogous instruments of anagogical understanding, an equality of status embodied in the physical structure of this unique and extraordinary manuscript. * An expanded version of this paper has now been published in J. Hamburger, The Rothschild Canticles: Art and Mysticism in Flanders and the Rhineland ca. 1300 (New Haven, 1990). Notes and comparative illustrations have therefore been reduced here to a minimum. 1.
