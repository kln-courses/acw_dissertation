<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mnemosyne, Vol. XXXVII, Fase. 3-4 (1984) SOME NOTES ON THE EXAGOGE OF EZEKIEL BY PIETER W. VAN DER HORST Dedicated to Maarten J. Vermaseren on his 65th birthday (7-4-1983) The Exagoge is a drama on the exodus of the people of Israel from Egypt, written by a Jew called Ezekiel at some time during the second century B.C. It is of great interest not only for being the on- ly surviving specimen of Jewish drama from antiquity but also because it is the only Greek tragedy from the Hellenistic period of which extensive portions have been preserved1). This piece, con- sisting of several continuous passages totalling 269 iambic trimeters, has been neglected. When surveying the scholarly work on Ezekiel of the last century, one finds only three major publica- tions. First, the edition with some explanatory notes by K. Kuiper in Mnemosyne n.s. 28 (1900) 237-2802). Second, the edition with commentary by J. Wieneke, Ezechielis Iudaeipoetae AlexandriniJabulae quae inscribitur ???GOG? fragmenta, M?nster 1931, for more than half a century the only commentary on our play3). Third, the critical edition of the text by Bruno Snell in Tragicorum Graecorum fragmenta I, G?ttingen 1971, 288-3014). Now, however, the situa- tion has been changed by the appearance of Howard Jacobson's 1) Only the quotations by Eusebius of Caesarea from Alexander Polyhistor's excerpts from the Exagoge in Praeparatio Evangelica IX 28-29 have been preserved. Vv. 7-40 are also quoted by Clemens Alexandrinus, Stromateis I 23, 155-156. 2) A French version of this article appeared in the Revue des ?tudes juives 46 (1903), 48-73 and 161-177. 3) See A. Lesky's review in Deutsche Literaturzeitung 3. Folge 3 (1932), 2217-2221, and O. St?hlin's in Gnomon 9 (1933), 56-58. 4) See also Snell's Die Jamben in Ezechiels Moses-Drama, Glotta 44 (1967), 25-32, and especially his Ezechiels Moses-Drama in his Szenen aus griechischen Dramen, Berlin 1971, 170-193. Of course ?. Mras' edition of Eusebius' Praeparatio Evangelica in the series Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller (2 vols., Berlin 1954-1956) was also an important event, but Mras tried to reconstruct Eusebius' text of Ezekiel, Snell Ezekiel's text.</page><page sequence="2">THE EXAGOGE OF EZEKIEL 355 The Exagoge of Ezekiel, Cambridge 19835). The distinctive feature of this edition with commentary is that for the first time the Exagoge is explained against the background of post-biblical Jewish exegesis of the Exodus-story. To be sure, Jacobson is a classical scholar but, unlike his predecessors, he is acquainted with all the sources of an- cient Judaism, and the result is that all kinds of details in the play, especially deviations from the biblical narrative, are only now put into the proper light. Jacobson remarks: "Snell fails to place Ezekiel adequately within his Jewish context'' (2), but the same could be said of Kuiper, Wieneke, and many other (even Judaic) scholars. Jacobson's commentary is an original, well documented, and capable work with many stimulating insights, and my notes will be no more than comparatively minor additions to his, with one exception (see below)6). In the long introduction (1-47 with notes on 175-193), Jacobson briefly discusses the name Ezekiel (5 with n. 4 on 176) without rais- ing the question of whether it might be a pseudonym. That this name was indeed used for pseudepigraphic purposes is well- known7). The fact that vv. 68-89 are so evidently based upon the first chapter of the biblical Ezekiel (see below) might raise the suspi- cion that the author has assumed this name as a pseudonym. But although this possibility cannot entirely be ruled out, I think it is more probable that it was his own name. The name did occur 5) Cambridge University Press 1983; 252 pages; ?25. See also the series of re- cent articles by Jacobson: Two Studies on Ezekiel the Tragedian, GRBS 22 (1981), 167-178; Mysticism and Apocalyptic in EzekieVs Exagoge, ICS 6 (1981), 272-293; Ezekiel the Tragedian and the Primeval Serpent, AJPh 102 (1981), 316-320; The Identity and Role of Chum in EzekieVs Exagoge, The Hebrew University Studies in Literature 9 (1981), 139-146. 6) My first critical remark is that, although his book is to be read not only by theologians but also by classicists, Jacobson takes for granted too much knowledge of things Jewish, e.g. abbreviations of the names of Talmudic treatises, terms like 'midrashic' (introduced without any explanation on p. 20), and even untranslated Hebrew and Aramaic quotations. He never gives any indication of the probable date of composition of Jewish sources either although he quotes from writings varying from the third century B.C. to the thirteenth century A.D. For classical scholars, this will make the book much less easy to read and to assess than would have been necessary. 7) See A. M.

He mentions the ??a??e? in Corpus Papyrorum Judaicarum III no. 464, 24 and the ??e????? in Epist. Aristeae 50. But he could also have mentioned the Ezekiels occurring in a Hebrew- Latin inscription in Corpus Inscriptionum Judaicarum I no. 630 and in the ostracon inscription from Medinet-Habu in F. Preisigke, Sammelbuch griechischer Urkunden aus ?gypten I, Berlin 1915, no. 643, 6 (though the latter may be Christian). There was also a third cen- tury A.D. Babylonian rabbi called Ezekiel (Berakhot 11a). Some ear- ly Byzantine instances can be found in F. Preisigke's Namenbuch, Heidelberg 1922, 146, and in D. Foraboschi's Onomasticon alterum papyrologicum, Milano 1971, 1439). When discussing the date of Ezekiel, Jacobson states that most of the proposed datings are not supported by "cogent argu- ment" 10). He himself opts for the late second century B.C., mainly for the following reasons: "there is nothing in the fragments to sug- gest hostility toward Greeks or any other pagans aside from the Egyptians", but "there was probably some deterioration taking place ... in the Jews' situation vis-?-vis the Greeks, such as to motivate Ezekiers engaging in this kind of propaganda/public rela- tions endeavor" (9). Moreover, Ezekiel "eliminated from his ver- sion of the Exodus all references to the land of Israel ... because Judaea was at the time of his writing not under Ptolemaic rule" (10). All this favours a date in the second century. Pre-Christian references to the phoenix (the miraculous bird that is described by Ezekiel in vv. 254-269) suggest that there was a "heightened in- terest in the phoenix at the beginning of the first century" (12). This favours a late second century dating, according to Jacobson. I do not find this a "cogent argument". The many affinities with chapter 7 of the book o? Daniel, commonly dated about 165 B.C., 8) E.g., the name does not occur in A. Schalit's Namenw?rterbuch zu Flavius Josephus, Leiden 1968. 9) A quick glance at the indexes of proper names in Corp.

Jubilees, commonly dated about the middle of the second century B.C., rather suggest a dating in the second quarter of that century11). But that is not a "cogent argument" either. The matter is best left open, as Jacob- son himself admits (13). His suggestion that possibly Sapientia Salomonis and Pseudo-Phocylides were also written in the second century B.C. (11) is curious; there is a growing consensus that these writings were both composed around the turn of our era or in the first half of the first century A.D.12). When discussing "The Provenance of the Exagoge" (13-17), Jacobson opts for Alexandria ("It would be surprising if Ezekiel wrote anywhere else but in Alexandria", 17). Hence he combats Kuiper's thesis for a Samaritan origin of the play. I agree with him when he says that Kuiper's arguments are weak, but I do not agree when he states that "the portrait of Moses in the Exagoge does not appear to tally with the grandiose view of Moses held by the Samaritans (at least as evident in late sources)" (15). John Mac- Donald's chapter on "Moses, Lord of the World" in his The Theology of the Samaritans (London 1964, 147-222) presents a view of Moses strikingly similar to the presentation of Moses in Exagoge 68-89. It is Jacobson's faulty interpretation of this passage which makes him take this position. I shall return to this below, but it should be added here that there are quite a number of noticeable parallels (apart from vv. 68-89) between the Exagoge and the Memar Marqah (Teaching of Marqah, a fourth century A.D. Samaritan treatise)13). Of course, we scarcely know what Samaritans of the se- cond century B.C. believed, but I want to stress that this whole question deserves to be studied anew. Maybe Kuiper was more right than he could imagine. And a Samaritan author might have lived in Alexandria. 11) For these datings see O.

Wieneke had already surmised that the Persae was an important model for Ezekiel. Jacobson con- firms this: "In the story told in Aeschylus' Persae he saw the Hellenic counterpart to the Jews' victory over the Egyptians. In each case the small, seemingly helpless people overcomes the awesome and hybristic enemy with divine aid" (24). But a new ele- ment is that Jacobson points out a number of striking parallels be- tween Aeschylus' Danaid trilogy (in so far as this is extant) and the Exagoge: Ezekiel "saw in the myth of the Danaids the story of the primeval Greeks' escape from Egypt and return to their ancestral homeland. ... Ezekiel would have perceived himself as recreating Aeschylus' Danaides, as well as Persae, in its Jewish guise, quite like- ly to elicit sympathy and respect for the Jews from his Greek au- dience, showing that both Greeks and Jews have similar ancestral stories of persecution, escape and return to a homeland" (25). In an article in GRBS of 1981 (see note 5), Jacobson had already pointed out the parallellism between the figure of Oedipus in Sophocles' Oedipus Coloneus and Moses in the Exagoge. "Ezekiel may have seen the OC as a Greek dramatic exemplar for Moses' exile from his native land, his encounter with divinity on sacred ground, and his future role as benefactor of the nation" {ibid. 178). These points of view are a useful corrective to the opinion (repeated time and again since Wieneke) that it was mainly Euripides who in- fluenced Ezekiel. One may say now: Euripides' influence mainly concerned Ezekiel's style and diction (and metre)15), but it was themes of Aeschylus and Sophocles that helped him to mould the biblical story into the form of a Greek drama. In his chapter on the dramatic structure of the play (28-36), Jacobson shows that there is an excessive neglect of the ideal of the unities of time and place in Ezekiel, much more than has often been assumed. No ancient tragedy, he says, covers so long a period of 14) This is the main emphasis in Wieneke's commentary. 15) But see Jacobson's excursus, "The metre and prosody of the Exagoge", 167-173.</page><page sequence="6">THE EXAGOGE OF EZEKIEL 359 time as the Exagoge and there is also no evidence for so bold a shift- ing of scenes in Greek tragedy. There were at least three different locations, but more probably five, and possibly ten different scenes. In a reconstruction of the play that goes beyond the extant fragments, Jacobson assumes that there must also have been presented a meeting of Aaron with Moses {Exodus 4:27-28), a talk of Moses with the elders of the people {Exod. 4:29-31), and also a scene in which Moses directly confronted Pharaoh (repeatedly in Exod. 5-12). This is very probable as to the first two of these scenes, the more so since Jacobson convincingly argues that w. 175-192 are not part of God's words to Moses but part of a speech by Moses to the elders of the Jewish people in which he reviewed for them God's commands concerning the Exodus and the celebration of Pesach (see 121 ff.). This is a splendid solution for the problem of the repetition of so many items from vv. 152-174 in vv. 175-192, and it also explains why in vv. 109f. God says to Moses s??a??e t??? ????? ?????? ... pas?? ???a????. But as to the assumption that there was a single scene in which Ezekiel may have compressed all the meetings of Moses with Pharaoh, I have doubts. The description of the ten plagues that God will bring upon Egypt in vv. 132-151 has no biblical basis. Nowhere in Exodus these plagues are enumerated by God in ad- vance. There is little doubt that this was a dramatic device employed by Ezekiel in order to avoid the insurmountable pro- blems of putting these ten plagues on the stage. The biblical ac- count of the plagues is inextricably interwoven with that of the meetings of Moses with Pharaoh. If Ezekiel decided to adopt the dramatic technique of having the plagues described beforehand by God, he should also do without these meetings of Moses and Pharaoh. And to reproduce the ten plagues again in one com- pressed scene of such a meeting would have amounted to a tedious repetition which I can hardly imagine Ezekiel would have commit- ted. So I am more skeptic about this part of his reconstruction than about his other suggestions16). 16) The repetition of the rules for Pesach (vv. 175-192) in a sense did have a biblical basis in that Exod. 12 has a first set of rules in vv. 1-28 and, after an in- termezzo in vv. 29-42, a second set in vv. 43-51.</page><page sequence="7">360 THE EXAGOGE OF EZEKIEL After the text (Snell's text slightly modified) with facing transla- tion of the fragments (50-67) follows the commentary (69-166 with notes on 193-221). A general remark must precede my notes on Jacobson's interpretation of the individual verses. It is not a line by line commentary, but rather a discussion of whole passages. Jacob- son focuses upon Ezekiel's train of thought, whereas discussion of problems of textual criticism, the meaning of rare words, syntac- tical peculiarities and the like is relegated to the footnotes. Knowledge of Wieneke's commentary (especially Wieneke's diachronic treatment of words and phrases) is taken for granted as is acquaintance with Jacobson's articles (see note 5). The contents of those publications are not repeated, often not even summarized. Unfortunately, this gives the commentary a somewhat unbalanced character. It does not give a full account of modern scholarship, neither on this drama as a whole nor on the individual verses. In order to get a full survey of the relevant material one must consult not only Jacobson's commentary (with the notes) but also his ar- ticles, Wieneke's commentary, some articles of other scholars Jacobson does not mention (see below), and my articles17). In view of the fact that Wieneke's commentary is sometimes hard to obtain (as are some of Jacobson's articles) it would have been better if the relevant materials from those publications were repeated or sum- marized in this commentary, not just supplemented. The first fragment starts with: af' ?? d' ?a??? ??? ??p?? ?a?a?a?a? | ?at???e ?t?. This inevitably raises the question whether a book could start with d? (cf. the same problem in e.g. Heraclitus' first fragment). Wieneke and Kraus18) assumed, because of this d?, that the original opening lines were lost, but Jacobson rightly refers to Verdenius' convincing studies of incep- tive d?1 a). However, Verdenius discusses only this usage in the classical period. Examples of inceptive d? from the post-classical 17) My article De joodse toneelschrijver Ezechi?l, Nederlands Theologisch Tijdschrift 36 (1982), 97-112, is mentioned in Jacobson's bibliography but I know it appeared too late to be used by him in his commentary.

Vv. 2-3 ?at???* ???? ????pt?? ?pt???? d??a | ???a? s?? a?t?. Jacobson examines in detail the problem that the Hebrew Bible has here the number 70 (as Ezekiel) whereas the LXX has 7519). I fully agree with his conclusion that "there are several ways in which Ezekiel could have known the figure 70 without any direct knowledge of the Hebrew Bible" (84). A reference to D. Bar- th?l?my, Etudes d'histoire du texte de VAncien Testament, G?ttingen 1978, 104 ff. and 333 n. 29, would have been in order here.

II, 1950, 700), examples of abstractum pro concreto (d??aste?a = d???st?? or rather d???sta?) and of ?a? explicativum. So d??aste?a = ?a??? ??d?e?. In w. 1-6 the whole period of Israel's sojourn in Egypt is des- cribed as a period of sheer oppression. The initially favourable situation, e.g. Joseph's viceroyalty over Egypt, is suppressed by Ezekiel, as Jacobson acutely remarks, because it would have reminded his audience or readers of the (since Manetho current) anti-Semitic accounts of a Jewish reign of terror over Egypt in Moses' days. In this respect it is significant that Moses and Joseph are sometimes very closely connected and made contemporaries by Alexandrian anti-Semitic authors, e.g. in fragment 1 of Chaeremon the Stoic20). Jacobson does not discuss the problem of v. 10 where Pharaoh is said to be ????d???a?? te ?a??s?? a?????? ???t???. One expects ?a?e?a??, not the masculine form. Wieneke accepts the emendation (by Sylburg and Gaisford) ????d???a? ???es??, rendering this by "molestias quae aedificatione efficiuntur" (42). Frucht el suggests: "?a??s?? liegt etwa eine Reminiszenz an das ?gyptische Wort ???? vor (also ????s? t')? Allerdings ist diesem Dichter ?a??s? f?r ?a?e?a?? 19) It is inconvenient that it is only at the very end of his discussion of the Pro- logue (vv. 1-59) that Jacobson raises this problem (on pp. 81-84), instead of at its proper place. This occurs more often in this commentary. 20) See the notes to fragment 1 in my Chaeremon, Egyptian Priest and Stoic Philosopher.

If one takes ????? to mean 'big house' or 'tower' (see LSJ s.v. 2), a meaning it occasionally has in the LXX, ????s? would fit perfectly with p??e?? t' ?p????? in the next line, but then ????d???a?? should indeed be changed into ????d???a?. Yet I prefer to take ?a??s?? as a slip for ?a?e?a?? {pace Friichtel). V. 11 p??e?? t' ?p????? is Sylburg's plausible emendation of the manuscripts' p??e?? te p??????. The biblical basis, Exod. 1:11, has just ???d???sa? p??e??, but Jubilees 46:14 says, "they built all the walls and all the fortifications which had fallen in the cities of Egypt". In vv. 14-15 Moses says: e?ta??a ??t?? ? te???s' ????pte ?e | t?e?? ???a?. This datum from Exod. 2:2 was the basis for the later theory that Moses was a six or seven months' child, as Jacobson remarks in another context (81 with n. 49). This motif is treated in my arti- cle Seven Monthsy Children in Jewish and Christian Literature from Antiqui- ty, Ephemerides Theologicae Lovanienses 54 (1978), 346-360. The construction ??s??? e?? ???? das? in v. 17, which has one ad- jective before the noun and a second one asyndetic after it, occurs more often in Ezekiel (as Wieneke 46 already noted): 221 ???a? st???? ?ef?d??, 249 da????? ????? ?a??? (cf. Euripides, Phoen. 653). See on this usage H. Zilliacus, Zur Abundanz der sp?tgriechischen Gebrauchssprache, Helsinki 1967, 37 ff., especially 48 ff. V. 22 says of the Egyptian princess who finds Moses: e??? d' ???a??? ??ta. Exod. 2:6 has ??a, but Philo, Vita Mosis I 15, has ????sa? here, so this may be added to Jacobson's list of possible in- stances of Ezekiel's influence on Philo on 38 f. V. 37 has the well-known theme that Moses was educated t??fa?s? ?as????a?s? ?a? pa?de??as?? (cf. Acts 7:22). On this ter- minology see W.

Could it be that the manuscripts' pa????????? is the Doric form of p????, 'to mutilate, to maim'? This fits the context, and Doric forms do still occur in Hellenistic times22). In vv. 60-62 the country of Moses' future wife, Sepphora, is called ?????, where ?????s?? ... ?????pe? ??d?e? ???a?e?, whereas the Bible calls it Midian, in NW-Arabia.

My own interpretation of this fascinating non-biblical passage has been elaborated elsewhere (see note 17) and can be summarized as follows. This is one of the earliest post-biblical throne-visions of which there are so many in the later so-called merkavah-lherature {merkavah = throne)24). All this literature is based upon the biblical Ezekiel chapter one, in which the prophet has a vision of a mighty throne and of God in human shape upon that throne. Speculations about the throne and the heavenly abodes and the outward ap- pearance of God gave rise to a strong mystical current in late anti- que and early medieval Judaism25). But that is not the only component in this scene. In early post-biblical Judaism there was, in some circles, a tradition in which the highest angel, called 'the angel of the Lord' in the Old Testament, was seen as God's primary or sole helper and allowed to share in God's divinity. It was part of this tradition that a human being, as the hero or ex- emplar of a particular group, could ascend to become one with this figure, as Enoch or Moses. So these angelic mediators often began as humans and later achieved a kind of divine status in some com- munities. They had charge over the world and became close to be- ing anthropomorphic hypostases of God himself26). That Moses 24) Now most of these treatises have been conveniently edited by P.

That Moses was indeed deified in some Jewish circles is beyond any doubt. In his important article Moses as God and King, Wayne Meeks has proved this with a wealth of material27). Another serious candidate was Enoch (see Genesis 5:24 "Enoch walked with God. Then he vanished because God took him away"). Hence it is no great sur- prise that the most striking parallels, even in details, to this dream- vision of Moses can be found in the Enochic literature, especially in the Hebrew Book of Enoch (or 3 Enoch), where Enoch is iden- tified with Metatron ( = ?et??????? or s????????, se. ?e??) a), the highest angel. Metatron is called the 'little Yahweh' which is exact- ly what Moses is in Ezekiel. It is probable that there was a certain rivalry between Moses and Enoch/Metatron in this function28). Be that as it may, Moses is here clearly envisaged as God's viceregent and plenipotentiary who rules over the world from God's throne. Jacobson's interpretation must be gathered from both his com- mentary (89-97) and his long article Mysticism and Apocalyptic in Ezekiel the Tragedian in ICS 6 (1981), 272-293. It is diametrically op- posed to my interpretation. He repeatedly emphasizes the anti- mystical character of our Ezekiel's description of Moses and stresses the playing down of anything supernatural or divine in Moses as a characteristic of the play as a whole, and especially of this scene. The many other stories of heavenly ascension by Moses, Jacobson says, "speak of a real ascension, not a visionary one. None reports his ascension as a dream. (...) In other words, Ezekiel deliberately chose to portray the 'ascension' as an imaginary event" {art. cit. 277). In Ezekiel we find a conscious rejection of the 27) In J.

In Numbers 12:6-8 God says: "If any man among you is a prophet I make myself known to him in a vision, I speak to him in a dream. Not so with my servant Moses: he is at home in my house; I speak with him face to face, plainly and not in riddles, and he sees the form of the Lord". The downright fact that in Ezekiel God does make himself known to Moses in a vision and speaks to him in a dream makes all this "no more than the substance of a dream" {ibid. 278). So actually Ezekiel's account should be read as polemic against the notion of Moses' divinization and cosmic kingship and against throne-mysticism. I take exception to this interpretation, ingenious though it is, for the following reasons. In the play itself, so far as we have it, there is not the slightest indication that this scene should be interpreted in this way. Only the Jewish part of Ezekiel's audience (or of his reading public), if well acquainted with the book of Numbers, might have caught the subtle hint. For his non-Jewish, Greek public, which?as Jacobson himself says?must have been the most important part of his addressees, this dream could have been nothing else than a vision of Moses' future exaltation to cosmic rulership, to be exercised from God's throne. Since the play draws its biblical material only from the first fifteen chapters o? Exodus, it is unthinkable that Numbers 12:6-8 could have been brought in somewhere. But without that, none of his Greek audience could be expected to see this supposed point. Moreover, would not Ezekiel completely overshoot his mark by representing his hero as a kind of megalomaniac, dreaming about his exaltation to divine status? If that was the point Ezekiel wanted to make, he could have made it by having Raguel say in his interpretation that Moses was com- pletely mistaken. But Raguel says nothing of the sort. He em- phasizes that Moses will establish a great throne and also become a great prophet. Raguel's interpretation seems to give more weight to the prophetic element, because, as Jacobson himself notes, "the royal aspect of the dream is straightforward and simple and re- quires no elaborate interpretation. The mantic aspect is not so clearcut and demands more detailed attention" {ibid. 288). So once more we find that the play itself does not offer us a clue to an anti-</page><page sequence="14">THE EXAGOGE OF EZEKIEL 367 mystical interpretation, or rather an explanation directed against notions of Moses' heavenly status. As to Numbers 12:6-8, this text would no more have inhibited Ezekiel from presenting his view in the form of a dream-vision than the prohibition of animal worship in Exod. 20:4-5 inhibited his contemporary Artapanus from depict- ing Moses as the founder of the Egyptian animal cults (Eusebius, Praep. Ev. IX 27). In the light of the studies by Segal and Fossum (although they do not mention Ezekiel), one can only say that Jacobson is mistaken when he states: "all the mysticism of the Philonic accounts is lacking in the Exagoge9' {ibid. 273), or: "the 'non-mystical character of Ezekiel's description may be appreciated by contrasting it to Philo's observation that Moses' ascent at Exod. 24 is his divinization" {ibid. 290 n. 13)29). I think the contrary is true. Let us now look at some minor details of this passage. In v. 68 the manuscripts' reading ?? d???? ?at' ???a? ???? was brilliantly emended by D?bner to e&lt;d?&gt;?' d???? ?at' ???a S??&lt;a?&gt;??. Jacobson still has doubts about S??a???, since a medieval (?) Hebrew transla- tion of this verse only has 'a high mountain'30), and he tentatively proposes d???? ?at' ????? a?pe???? (200 ?. 2). That might be correct, but it should be said that there is a traditional link between Sinai and throne-visions in early Jewish literature31). Moreover, Ginz- berg quotes rabbinic traditions about a pre-Exodus Sinai-ascent by Moses including a throne-vision32). In the ancient Near East God's throne was often envisaged as occupying the top of a high mountain33). For the imagery of the passage as a whole a reference 29) The reference is to Quaestiones in Exodum II 40.

P. l'Orange, Studies on the Iconography of Cosmic Kingship in the Ancient World, Oslo 1953, would have been in order34). The use of ????sta in v. 72 is curious. As in v. 49 (??d?a? d??, ? ????sta V a?t??? s???e?e??, pat????????), it must have here the sense of 'nota bene' which is not attested elsewhere, although ????sta tends to become a particle giving emphasis to the words im- mediately preceding or following it; see W.

Thesleffs discussion of ????sta in his Studies on the Greek Superlative, Helsingfors 1955, 79-92, deals only with the classical usage and sheds no light on these passages). Here, however, this emphasis is not called for, since the holding of the sceptre in the left hand was quite normal; see l'Orange, op. cit. 154 et al35). On 139 ff. l'Orange discusses the symbolism of the raising of the right hand, the s??- ????? s?t???a?, which is relevant to vv. 172-173 de??f d? ??? ??e?se. In v. 174 ?????? is used in the singular, in v. 176 in the plural without any obvious change in meaning. This is parallelled in Sa- pientia Salomonis 9:4 and 10 (and compare the plural ?????? in Aeschylus' Eumenides 18 and 29 with the singular in exactly the same context in Euripides' Iphigeneia Taur. 1254 f.). For the poetic use of the plural instead of the singular, the so-called amplificatio, see K?hner-Gerth (n. 44) I 18-9 and Schwyzer, Gramm. II 42-4. Ad vv. 79-80 Jacobson rightly refers to Psalm 147:4 (LXX 146:4 ? a?????? p???? ?st???) but fails to mention that this counting of the multitudes of the stars is God's activity and that this divine ac- tivity is ascribed to Enoch/Metatron in 3 Enoch 46:1-2 with an ex- plicit reference to Psalm 147. His remark, "Ezekiel distinctly limits the obeisance to a t? p????? ast????, which does not seem equivalent to 'all the stars', nor does he mention the sun and moon", is quibbling.

As to vv. 85-86, Jacobson discusses the problem whether one should read ?????? or ??????, and what the meaning of ??a?ast?se?? is, but he does not discuss the related matter of whether the sentence is a question and what is the meaning of the initial ??? ?e. The context (sc. the interpretation of a dream) makes it clear that it is not a question?here Jacobson rightly sides (in his translation, not in the printed Greek text!) with Kuiper and Wieneke against Mras and Snell. Therefore, a?? ?e must be here equivalent to a?a ?e, expressing a lively feeling of interest; see J. D. Denniston, The Greek Particles, Oxford 19542, 43.

Jacobson offers a brilliant emendation for the difficult d?????t?? in v. 106 ???s?e?? d' e?e???? ?a? et' ???? d?????t??, se. ?e?? (one ex- pects 'promises', not 'gifts'). He suggests ???? d? ????t??, which to my mind is much more feasible than his attempt to prove that ta ??a d????ata means here "the gifts that I have received" (109-112).

This variant reading may have been Ezekiel's text, the more so since Philo (Vita Mosis I 83), too, has it39). Ad v. 134 p??a? te pasa? ?a? ?d?t?? s?st??ata, it should be noted that it is either a quotation from or quoted by Ps-Aeschylus 8 (ap. Ps-Justin, De monarchia 2, and Clemens Alexandrinus, Strom. V 14, 131, 1) ?a? p?sa p??? ??dat?? s?st??ata. Vv. 133-151 enumerate the ten plagues in a different order from the account in Exodus itself. Jacobson refers to parallels for this dif- ferent order in Jubilees, Artapanus and Philo, but the same phenomenon can be found already in Psalms 78:43 ff. and 105: 28 ff.40). Jacobson's discussion of the reasons for this deviation from the Exodus account (114-115) is excellent. The meaning of s???? (or ????) in v. 135 is not certain. In the LXX of Exod. 8:16 ( = LXX 8:12) it is the translation of a Hebrew word for a kind of mosquito. But the Suda s.v. s???? says it is a ???? ?????? ????f???? (LSJ s.v. : an insect found under the bark of trees, eaten by the woodpecker). This uncertainty is reflected in Jacob- son's book in that he translates it by 'lice' in his translation, but by 'fleas' in his commentary (115). Jacobson criticizes Sutton by stating: "When D. F. Sutton writes, 'LSJ incorrectly reports the accusative ... as s???pa?' (at Exagoge 135), 's???pa? is guaranteed by the meter', he himself is wrong (Glotta 55 (1977) 212). As the verse stands in our manuscripts s???pa? is guaranteed by the meter. It is for this reason that Snell posits the lacuna" (206 n. 5). Snell (Glotta 44 (1967) 29) assumes a lacuna because s???pa?, not s???pa?, is cor- rect and would be metrically impossible. Hence he proposes ?at????? te p????? &lt;-^-x-v_,- x-w-&gt; ?a? s???pa? ???a?? ?????. I agree with Jacobson that these metrical problems should not lead us to assume a lacuna but I would prefer J. Strugnell's ?at????? te p????? s???pa t' ???a?? ?????41). 39) Thus E.

God says to Moses: Fa?a? d? ?as??e?? pe?set' ??d?? ?? ????, | p??? t????? a?t?? p??t?????? e?e? ?e????. This raises the question whether pe?seta? comes from p?s?? or from pe???. Although rejected by Kuiper and Wieneke, Jacobson defends the thesis that the sentence means, "Pharaoh will not suffer any of the plagues I have mentioned", which has some slight support from Jewish midrashim. But (a) this contradicts the biblical tale (Exod. 11:9 has: ??? e?sa???seta? ???? Fa?a?), as Jacobson himself is aware (119), and (b) the following v. 151 ?a? t?te f????e?? ?a?? e?p???e? ta?? makes it more probable that what is meant here is, "Pharaoh will not pay heed to anything said to him". V. 156 says that the people should mark the doorposts with blood dp?? pa????? s??a de???? ???e??? and in v. 186 in the same context ?p?? pa????? ???at?? ???a??? ap?, whereas in Exodus 12 it is the Lord himself, not an angel or death that is the actor. Jacobson (209 n. 8) rightly refers to rabbinic debates over the issue. The same is also found in a variant reading in Targum Neofiti I of Exod. 12:13 "and the destroying angel who is appointed over death will not have power to injure you", and in the Samaritan Memar Marqah I 9 (see J. E. Fossum, The Name of God and the Angel of the Lord, diss. Utrecht 1982, 244). The non-biblical notion that the objects taken from the Egyptians by the Jews at the exodus are in fact a payment for all the work done by the Jews in Egypt (v. 165-166 ??a | &lt;???') ?? ?p?a?a? ??s??? ?p?d?s?? ???t???) is amply discussed by Jacobson (126 f.), but he has no reference to the article by the Dutch Jewish scholar E. Stein, Ein j?disch-hellenistischer Midrasch ?ber den Auszug aus ?gypten, Monatsschrift f?r Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judentums 78 (1934), 570 ff.42). This is actually one of the very few publications on Ezekiel missed by Jacobson. In general, his coverage of the secondary literature is very complete. The construction of the verbs in vv. 180-183 is remarkable: ??t?? f??es?e ta?ta? pe??e??s????? ?a? ????a p?ss?? ?p?d?des?e ?a? ?e?? ?a?t????? ????te?, ?? sp??d? te ??? ?as??e?? ?e?e?se? p??ta? ???a?e?? ??????. 42) See also R.

When discussing Hebraisms in Ezekiel (in the introduction, 43), however, he suggests this might be a case of the use of the participle as a finite verb (which is common in post- biblical Hebrew). If this is a case of Semitism at all, it is the partici- ple as an imperative: the future form f??es?e has an imperative function (as so often in the LXX) and ?p?d?des?e is an imperative. The use of the participle as an imperative is a common phenomenon in Mishnaic Hebrew and in Hebraizing Greek43). But I would rather take this as an instance of ellipsis of the im- perative of e??a?, which occurs also, for instance, in another Jewish- Hellenistic poem, Ps-Phocylides 57 ?? p??pet?? ?? ?e??a44). In the following line, v. 184, the manuscripts continue: ?e???seta? d? pa?, ?a? dta? ??s?te d?, | d?s??? ?a???te? ?t?. In view of the context, ?e???seta? d? p?? should mean "and each shall be summoned", but Strugnell (see n. 41) has argued that ?e???seta? can only be translated by 'will be named'; only ?????seta? could mean 'will be summoned". Hence he suggests that an original ?e???seta? d? p?s?'? dta? ??s?te d? was wrongly divided up into p?? ??ta? ? pa? ?a? dta?. His conjecture ?e???seta? d? p?s?' ( = p?s?a) has been adopted by Snell, but Jacobson once again, like Mras, defends the mss. He points out the fact that "virtually every detailed Jewish account of the Passover from antiquity lays stress on its universal application, i.e. that all are solicited to perform the sacrificial rite" (133). Moreover, it is odd to say in v. 184 'it will be called Pascha', when the name Pascha has already been men- tioned in v. 157. This seems to be convincing, but the ?a? ... d? in ?a? dta? ??s?te d? remains problematic a). Jacobson does not 43) D. Daube, Participle as Imperative in 1 Peter, in E. G.

Nevertheless, the fact that the correspond- ing biblical text, Exod. 12:11, has p?s?a est?? ????? makes Strugnell's emendation extremely attractive. After all, ?e???seta? d? p?s?a may just mean: 'then it will be Pesach'. For this weakened use of ?a?e?s?a? as an equivalent of e??a? see LSJ s.v. II 2. V. 190 ?a??? ?a? t??d' ?pa??a??seta? is hard to translate. Jacob- son does not discuss the problem but translates: "for you shall receive release from these evils". Mras and Snell retain the manuscripts' reading and Mras ad locum remarks: "unpers?nlich: Befreiung wird stattfinden", but there is little support for this. Kuiper changed the whole sentence into ?a??? ??? ?st? t??d' apa??a??. Wieneke reads ?pa??a??? t? s??, with ?pa??a??? depending upon the verb d?d?G in the next line. The best thing is to read ?pa??a??sete (with the inferior manuscripts): "you will be re- leased". Jacobson does translate it this way, but he prints ?pa??a??seta?. The ending -?seta? has originated from the ending of the previous line: ?????seta?45). This assimilation was of course furthered by the fact that from the third or second cent. B.C. on- wards there was no longer a difference in pronunciation between a? and e; see F. Blass-A. Debrunner-F. Rehkopf, Grammatik des neutestamentlichen Griechisch, G?ttingen 197514, par. 25.

It should be noted that also elsewhere in Jewish literature there is speculation about the number of drowned Egyptians: Josephus, Antiquitates II 324 and Mekhilta, Beshallach 2 (I p. 202 Lauterbach). 45) Another solution is to read, as Stephanus proposed, apa??a?? esseta?, with synizesis. 46) See my De joodse toneelschrijver Ezechi?l (n. 17) 99.</page><page sequence="21">374 THE EXAGOGE OF EZEKIEL V. 210 says the Israelites were ???p??? when they left Egypt, whereas the Hebrew Bible says they were well armed (Exod. 13:18 hamushim). Although most ancient translations have a word mean- ing 'armed' here, the LXX has p??pt? d? ?e?e?, deriving the Hebrew word from hamesh, 'five'. Possibly this induced Ezekiel, Josephus (Ant. II 321) and others to deny the Jews weapons, as Jacobson rightly remarks (216 n. 53). The uncertainty about the exact meaning of the Hebrew at Exod. 13:18, the discussion of it in early Jewish literature (e.g. Mekhilta, Beshallach 1, I p. 174 f. Laut.) and the divergent consequences thereof have recently been master- fully examined by R. Le D?aut, A propos du Targum d'Exode 13, 18: La T?rah, arme secr?te d'Isra?l, in M. Carrez-J. Dorez-P.

V. 214 ??a? d? ????a p??ta? e??e? ?? ???e? is translated by Jacob- son as "We in contrast were delighted". But ????a here is 'malicious pleasure', 'Schadenfreude', as it is in Aeschylus' Persae 1034. This instance could be added to Jacobson's impressive list (136-138) of echoes of the Persae in this messenger's report by a member of the defeated nation in the Exagoge.

Kuiper's conjecture is based upon Sapientia Salomonis 18:3 p???f?e?? st????. I do not see why the second ???a?, again belonging to the same st????, should be retained; it is too awkward. And Snell's ???a? (in app. crit.) does not get rid of the impossible p?? ???. Jacob- son does not know the brilliant emendation proposed by E.

This is much closer to the original than Kuiper's p???f?e???, and it is in perfect agreement with the biblical account; note the mention of the f??a?? ?????? in Exod. 14:24 in this context.
