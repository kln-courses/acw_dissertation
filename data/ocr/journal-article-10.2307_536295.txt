On the other hand, the song of the Magi in connection with "star- walking" has survived as a popular Danish Christmas custom until rather recently. In Sweden the star-singers' play can be traced back to around I650. To begin with, it obtained a foothold in the towns and merged with the much earlier established practice by schoolboys to raise funds by singing at Christmas. In rural districts it met vigorous predecessors in indigenous peasant pageants still performed, such as going with the Yule Goat and St. Stephen's Singing of December 26, a medieval Swedish custom con- nected with the guilds of the youths and their horse-racing at Christmas. In many places the old customs were more or less included in the new; in some places the old ones held the upper hand. Thus the star-singing was in certain cases transferred from Epiphany to St. Stephen's Day. The patron of the horsemen himself, and the Yule Goat with him, appeared together with the Magi and their Biblical companions. Indigenous Christmas carols of known and unknown origin and a few popular ballads, notably the St. Stephen's stableman's song, were included in the repertoire of the star-singers and thus preserved by them. All records before 1850 are given in full in their chronological order (pp. 49-79). The extensive material that appears hereafter (about I I,ooo records) is given in a representa- tive selection and arranged geographically (pp. 80-258). The following chapters (pp. 259-438) contain a systematic account of the custom, first of its oral and dramatic forms, second of its more or less essential ethnographical features. A carefully done analysis of the dialogue-texts and the songs also offers criteria for time sequences of concomitant elements. The function of each feature in its artistic, religious, or humorous application is shown in its interrelation with relevant social and cultural traditions within each locality. Leaning upon this excellent organization of his material, the author then has the gratifying task of establishing geographical distribution and dissemination (pp. 439-445). Finally, a summary is given of the role that the custom has played within different occupational and age groups in the population, of the practical purposes it has served, its character of being religious folk-art, its mixture of styles, its final degeneration and discontinuance of being spontaneous folklore, and its recent revival as applied folklore. Supplementary are two distribution maps, a short music appendix, and a summary in English. Idaho State College, SVEN LILJEBLAD Pocatello, Idaho Mythos und Kult bei Naturvolkern; Religionswissenschaftliche Betrachtungen. By Ad. E. Jensen. (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, Studien zur Kulturkunde. Zehnter Band, I951. Pp. vii + 423. D M 24.80.) In this book Professor Jensen (Frankfurt a-M.), known for his field work in Ceram and Ethiopia, discusses virtually all the topics of concern to comparative religion, using data from all over the world, though with a preference for the "older horticulturists." Since he deals critically with the theories of animism, primeval monotheism, and pre- animism, a treatise would be required to do justice to his work. A review must confine itself to a few salient points. Though avowedly an advocate of the historical approach to culture (p. i i), Dr. Jensen here deliberately pursues another goal, viz. the determination of the ultimate meaning of religious phenomena. Correctly regarding the interpretations now offered by primitive informants as secondary, he proceeds from Leo Frobenius's conception that any cultural</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 103 phenomenon arose when the thrill (Ergriffenheit) at some aspect of the universe found "expression" (Ausdruck). In the sequel the creative impulse waned, and the expression .of an originally deep emotion became attenuated, yielding to mere routine-like "applica- tion" (Anwendung) of the primal inspiration. In other words, what was once charged with meaning (sinnvoll) is emptied of meaning (sinn-entleert). There are admittedly no objective criteria for gauging the proximity of a given feature to its inspirational archetype; every- thing hinges on one's subjective ability to re-experience the creator's state of mind- precisely as one re-lives the greatness of a Shakespearean drama (p. 8). In trying to make us better understand the spiritual creations of non-Occidental humanity, the author con- cedes the hypothetical nature of his efforts, but contends that the hitherto prevalent theories are likewise hypothetical. Moreover, they assume a prehistoric mentality i la LEvy-Bruhl that conflicts with probability; primeval man was not prelogical as contrasted with modern man, who likewise is far from functioning as a logic-chopping machine. Characteristic of Professor Jensen's approach is the repeated declaration that early man had true mythical insights (Erkenntnisse) into the nature of reality which do not conflict with science because coextensive scientific statements do not exist (p. 403 et passim). Myth is considered primary: ceremonial is merely a mimicry of divine actions during a mythical period. In this context appears perhaps the author's most characteristic contri- bution, the definition of a type of divinity corresponding to the transformer or culture hero, terms Professor Jensen rejects as not adequate to the grandeur of the conception (die Grossartigkeit der Erscheinung): Accordingly, he borrows the Marird-anim (New Guinea) word dema to designate the category. The mythical era of many primitive tribes is peopled by either anthropomorphic, theromorphic, or plantlike beings, the dema, some of which-the dema-divinities-create the present order of the universe, terminating the mythical period. Typically, the other dema kill the divinity, which is transformed into plant species of economic utility, sets out on the first journey to the hereafter, and usually assumes lunar shape, symbolizing death and revival. In contrast to the high god, the dema is active only in the dim past and does not control human destiny, so that invocation would be meaningless. The relevant religious attitude is essentially recollection of the divine origin of the present order of things and ceremonial dramatization of the primeval occurrences, and especially of the killing of the god (pp. 115-II8). I find this idea stimulating in the literal meaning of the term, for it suggests an intensive world-wide inquiry into the nature of the transformer type as defined by Professor Jensen. On specific aspects of his theory I have misgivings. For example, he tends to attach genetic significance to the parallel between the horticulturists' tale of plants springing from the body of the slain god and the Eskimo myth of Sedna's fingers transformed into sea mammals. What is more, he connects the head-scratching taboo "bei einzelnen Volkern in Nord-und Sidamerika" with handless Sedna's inability to remove impurities from her hair. The prohibition, which at first blush is unintelligible, is explained, according to our author, when viewed from this angle. In the crises of life, man, i.e. in this case woman more particularly, recalls his (her) relationship to the deity and plays the divine role. Professor Jensen is very cautious on all pertinent points, neither dogmatizing on the suggested historical connection nor assuming that the Sedna myth is the only conceivable interpretation of the taboo. However, his mode of approach is clearly discernible in these tentative gropings: he regards it as axiomatic that practices or taboos are ultimately related to a mythical verity (pp. I74-I80). This and some of the other postulates set forth in the book I am unable to accept. Like ourselves, primitive man does many things that are meaningless; and precisely if we accept Professor Jensen's view of paleolithic and pre-paleolithic mentality, there seems no reason for assuming that myriads of years ago he acted only in consonance with a coherent</page><page sequence="3">104 Journal of American Folklore cosmological system. I venture to think that this is a relapse into that intellectualistic psychology which the author cogently criticises when considering Tylor's scheme. Specifically, I dissent from the assertions that cult and myth are always closely con- nected; that games are derivative from ceremonial; that folktales are degenerate myths. It is true that in some areas, e.g. in Australia, the ritual bears a close relationship to the mythology, but in others, as frequently in North America, the tie is loose or even absent. As to games and Mdrchen, if man has not completely changed his nature, the sportive, urge must have been present in early times too. It is not a question of priority, but of independence: a game as a form of amusement may be combined with a pre-existing ceremony without either game or ceremony originating from the other. Shakespeare's fools' clowning is not the source of his tragic situations or vice versa. These considerations to the contrary notwithstanding, the reader will profit from Professor Jensen's broad-gauge survey of a vast ethnographic material from a definite point of view. His critique of intellectualistic psychologizing in the study of religion, his. vindication of early human mentality, his definition of the scope of "progress" in culture, are all admirable. Even some of his less convincing statements might suitably become starting points for doctoral dissertations. University of California, ROBERT H. LOWIE Berkeley, California The Sculpture of Negro Africa. By Paul S. Wingert. (New York: Columbia University Press, I950. Pp. x + 96. Map; bibliography; 118 pls. $4.50.) The present volume goes far to fill an important desideratum in ethnological studies in that it provides by far the best introduction to the study of African sculptural art that has yet appeared. Its outstanding contribution is a pioneer attempt to delimit precisely a number of art areas based on sculptural styles in place of the much vaguer formulation in the earlier literature. Thus, even Kjersmeier's classic Centres de style de la sculpture Negre Africaine suffers from an arbitrary classification of material based on administrative and political units. The author faces the facts honestly and arrives at a multiplicity of styles (e.g. six in West Africa alone), underlying which, however, a basic unity of African approach to three-dimensional form can be discerned. The work presents an admirable balance between the artistic and ethnological points of view. The formal features on which the author's obvious appreciation of Negro art is founded, are set forth soberly. The rhapsodic incoherences and vague metaphysics of much art criticism is fortunately conspicuous by its absence. On the other hand, there is an awareness of the functions of the art and its place in Negro African culture although one might wish for more elaboration in this regard. Supplied with an excellent set of illustra- tions, a bibliography, and a catalogue of existing museum collections in the United States, Wingert's book is well suited as an introduction to the subject of African art for the general student. A few questions of details may be raised. I miss any mention of the Bidjogo statues of the Bissagos Islands off the coast area of Portuguese Guinea in West Africa, illustrated in Bernatzik's Athiopen des Westens, which would seem to rank as an independent Negro style. In certain instances a more precise set of features for defining style seems in order. Thus the mask style of the Poro-type secret society found among the Mende and other groups in the Liberia-Sierra Leone area is grouped with the Mende style of figure sculp- tures as variants of his West Guinea Coast style. The statement that "The Poro style agrees with the Mendi in that its emphasis is on form and volume" strikes one as some- what generalized for a conclusion of this kind. In this case, if the styles are considered</page></plain_text>
