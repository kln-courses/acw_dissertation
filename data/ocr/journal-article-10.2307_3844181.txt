The Globe's contention that none of this was orchestrat- ed by the production-in the same way as hissing the villain is never orchestrated by the pantomime, of course-is also reported with a cool detachment that avoids even a flicker of the editorial eyebrow. For the reader, however, the cumulative evidence pro- duces either a sense of profound relief that one missed the experience-or (as in my own case) bitter regret that one didn't! This is, then, though some of its choices seem a little narrow and disappointing, a valuable addition to a useful series. It is a pity that a few typographical errors have escaped detection. One of them (on page 85) has John Woodvine, when he first came on as the Chorus in Michael Bogdanov's production of the tetralogy, having played Falstaff in the Henry IV plays, being greeted by"a spontaneous oration" from the audi- ence-speaking in unison, presumably.

Pp. xiv + 291. $37.50 cloth, $18.00 paper. Reviewed by DAN BRAYTON The many versions of Hamlet constitute an immense field of cultural production, an exhaustive survey of which may well be impossible. The volume Approaches to Teaching Shakespeares Hamlet, edited by Bernice W. Kliman, offers something else: a diverse sam- pling of practical, theoretical, traditional, intercultural, and technologically innovative ways to teach Hamlet. This book is neither a guide to Hamlet scholarship nor a teacher's primer with study questions. It is, instead, an admirably succinct, well organized, and up- to-date collection of insights, anecdotes, and methodological examples for teaching Shakespeare's most popular tragedy. Its accessibility and global scope make it a useful resource for those who teach Shakespeare from middle school to graduate school. Like any good road map, this book provides orientation at a glance. It is divided into two sections,"Materials" and'Approaches" The latter is much more comprehensive and, for my money, a good deal more fun. Here we encounter subsections that treat the tra- ditional concerns of Hamlet criticism, such as "Narrative, Character, and Theme," fol- lowed by"Comparative Approaches" and"Modern and Postmodern Strategies." Ranging in scope from such issues as "Introducing Verse and Meter" and "The Multiple-Text Hamlet" to relatively recent topics such as "Hamlet Online," the contributions are logi- cally arranged and available to lay readers. Readers can move from'An Annotated and Chronological Screenography" to 'An Interdisciplinary Approach to Hamlet in a Distance-Learning Classroom" or"Act 2, Scene 1, 75-120: Psychoanalytic Approaches" and"The Fencing Scene," to name but four of the more than sixty brief contributions that make up the volume. While the pedagogical methods and ideological commitments of the contributors vary considerably, each contribution strives for utility. Thus, Margaret Maurer's con- 201 BOOK REVIEWS</page><page sequence="2">SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY tribution to the innovative subsection "Short Takes" offers a half-page account of Francis Bacon's essay "Of Revenge": Maurer elucidates the distinctions Bacon makes between the different facets of revenge-social, psychological, political-and their rel- evance to Hamlet. Another part of "Short Takes', by Denise M. Mullins, includes graphic sketches of the play's characters depicted as familiar animals. Mullins claims that, "by incorporating students' prior knowledge of pop culture, their understanding of animal imagery in literature, and the anthropomorphic coloring book [she] created while studying Hamlet, [she] successfully introduced a taste of Shakespeare into a seventh-grade poetry unit" (227). It seems unlikely that many will make use of both Maurer's and Mullins's contributions as teaching aids. Still, whether or not someone doing research on revenge may be curious to know that early modern tragedy can be taught to schoolchildren, the presence of such diverse contributions emphatically ban- ishes the specter of a unitary, transhistorical take on Hamlet. Indeed, this volume is evidence of the productive fragmentation of literary studies in the wake of the theory wars and the advent of cultural studies. Kliman has assem- bled a remarkable variety of contributions, including several that bespeak the interna- tional status of Shakespeare in the postmodern world. Thus, Graham Bradshaw's essay, "The 'Encrusted' Hamlet: Resetting the 'Mousetrap'," in the subsection "Comparative Approaches," discusses his experience of teaching the play at the postgraduate level in a Japanese university. Bradshaw faces the issue of interpreting the spectral status of the murdered king when the Ghost has already"been assimilated to the strongJapanese tra- dition of katakiuchi ('blood revenge') drama . . ." (118-19). Similarly, in a piece that emphasizes not current issues of cultural translation but questions of comparative his- toriography, Paula S. Berggren's "Teaching Hamlet in a Global Literature Survey: Linking Elizabethan England and Ming China" draws comparisons between Eastern and Western literatures. While the global scope of the "Comparative Approaches" sub- section is timely, some contributions strain too hard for a transcultural comparatism. I'm not convinced that insights such as the following, from Berggren, advance our understanding of either Elizabethan or Chinese literature:"Whether standing or crawl- ing between heaven and earth, in both periods human beings seek to assert themselves and their capacities" (129). While this book is striking for its plurality of perspectives, it also serves to some degree as a showcase for the work of such noted Shakespeare scholars as Barbara Hodgdon, John Drakakis, and Julia Reinhard Lupton. The virtue of the volume-its concise presentation of the most varied takes on Shakespeare-is exemplified by Lupton's contribution, "The Gertrude Barometer: Teaching Shakespeare with Freud, Eliot, and Lacan," which appears in the subsection "Modern and Postmodern Strategies." In fewer than seven pages, Lupton walks us through an utterly compelling reading that explains a good deal about both psychoanalytic criticism and the rhetori- cal and thematic structure of the play. This kind of interpretive exercise in compression not only provides useful parameters for teaching Hamlet, it also provides a clear glimpse of psychoanalytic literary scholarship. Such a helpful condensation of a sophisticated interpretive methodology lies at the heart of this book's utility. My lingering impression of having held a hard-copy version of an Internet search engine guarantees that I will use this book the next time I teach Hamlet. The impact of 202</page><page sequence="3">the Internet on research and teaching clearly registers not only in much of the content of the book but also in its overall organization. It is a series of sound bites that would be most useful as a compendium of first stops on a wide range of topics related to Hamlet. As such, it offers a sort of virtual topography of the state of Shakespeare schol- arship. This book can help any teacher take a discussion of Shakespeare's most con- tested play out of the world of doublet-and-hose convention and transport it to the far more interesting here and now. Hamlet in His Modern Guises. By ALEXANDER WELSH. Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2001. Pp. xii + 178. $37.50 cloth. Reviewed by DAVID LEE MILLER "It seems that Shakespeare prepared Hamlet well for an unexpected role in mod- ern history" (70). This sentence concludes the second chapter of Alexander Welsh's book and functions as a hinge for its argument. Two chapters devoted to Shakespeare's preparation for the unexpected are followed by three that explore his hero's resurgence in novels by Goethe, Scott, Dickens, and Melville, ending with a brief abstract and chronicle of Hamlet's modernist guises in Hugo, Mallarme, Laforgue, Joyce, and Murdoch. As this summary indicates, the history in question is literary. Welsh places Hamlet in it first by comparing Shakespeare's version of his character and story to those of Saxo and Belleforest. Although the comparison looks back to literary precedents, it is, like the sentence quoted above, anticipatory from the start, centering on the prescience of Shakespeare's innovations. These serve to consolidate the related themes of family and mourning. "As in King Lear," Welsh observes, "the main result of introducing a sub- plot in Hamlet is to generalize the relations of parents and children, to make it less pos- sible to view the hero's situation as unique" (13). He proves an observant guide, lead- ing us, for instance, from the oppressive meddling of the play's older generation (its parental figures) through Hamlet's telling aversion to courtly "compliance," concluding that "Shakespeare represented a young man not just wronged by his uncle but sur- mounted by parents" (23). Meanwhile Polonius accents the motif of parental over- bearance with so much flair that Ophelia "well may be said to have'drowned herself in her own defense"' (23). Turning from the story's ancestry to its generic affiliation with revenge tragedies, Welsh turns as well from the keynote of generational conflict within the family to its antithetical complement, grief extended in mourning. The burden of English revenge tragedy, he observes, is that"grief finds relief in anger, and anger in violence" (39). In violence or, it turns out, in the hypothesis, the fiction, of violence: The Spanish Tragedy, Welsh observes, makes clear"that, where mourning is concerned, the contemplation of revenge is as efficacious as revenge itself" (44). In Hamlet this contemplative impulse dominates as never before, but in doing so, it heightens what was already characteris- tic of revenge tragedies, their exploration of the relations among grief, anger, guilt, 203 BOOK REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
