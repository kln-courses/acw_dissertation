<plain_text><page sequence="1">GREEK AND HINDU GODS Clay Lancaster THE GODS have come into being for two fundamental purposes: first, as an attempt at answering the question concerning the origin of man and of the world in which he lives; and second, as agents to whom man can appeal when he comes up against situations with which he cannot cope. In other words, the gods serve to satisfy man's curiosity and his anxiety. The first function is embodied in mythology-a primitive, often poetic, narration that uses supernatural stories to answer questions of primal cause, in place of abstract speculation. The second function is more immediate, more personal, more tangible; it often takes the form of an image of deity that may be seen, touched, directly worshipped-the great character from the myth come down into the presence of the adoring votary! Herein are two good reasons why the gods should assume anthropomorphic shapes: they are at once actors and beneficent guardians, or in place of the latter they are stern rulers or judges demanding obedience and accounting. In either event they behave, and therefore should look, like men. Artists throughout the ages have exalted in fashioning whatever gods they esteem in the traditional roles or escapades related in mythology. Associ- ated with the gods through depicting them in their work, the artists are lifted to new heights of superiority. More of a devotional attitude is expressed in the making of the icon of divine presence-the portrait of the god, complete with necessary attributes-out of histrionic context. In the latter instance the god is stationary, or nearly so; he stands ready to serve, command or con- demn, or simply to receive his tribute. He has stepped before the curtain of the mythological tableau, facing his audience, ready to acknowledge praise, or condescending to listen to his underlings. The two aspects of the gods and goddesses are everywhere apparent in</page><page sequence="2">336 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL Greek and Hindu art. In both Greece and India we can trace the development back further in sculpture than in the two-dimensional arts; and for this reason we shall limit our observations to plastic representations of the gods. The earliest three-dimensional representations are crude affairs modeled in clay and allowed to harden, or given a light firing. Ivory, wood, steatite and stone, bronze and other metals were added to the list, the harder materials requiring carving at first reserved for incised or low-relief designs. We note that a veneration for primitive materials persisted through the centuries. The little ivory-and-gold Aegean serpent goddesses of the mid second millennium B.C. may be considered an ancestress of Phidias' colossal chryselephantine Athena placed inside the Parthenon on the Acropolis over a thousand years later. And the river-mud figures of Kali that are fashioned for temporary worship in India today, and then ceremonially returned into the River, are another example. Only a wide difference in technique separates the earliest from the later deities in the respective regions, there being comparatively little change in intent. The early god images, newly born from the hands of man, had not yet set out on their mythological quests. They awaited activity, and motion, to be given them by later sculptors. Greek sculpture already had come a long way by the time of the Archaic Period (ca. 600-490 B.C.). From the stylized, geometrical mode of representation during the Neolithic period, the human figure had reached the oriental phase, resembling in the stiff torso and left leg thrust forward the conventional pose of Egyptian sculpture. As one sees in the over-lifesize early kouros in the Metropolitan Museum even the conventionalized details, such as the hair, and the non-individualized face-though with distinctly different ethnic features-seem inspired by art to the south and east of the Mediterranean Sea. Yet the Greek desire to bring the stone to life is soon apparent, and hero or god affects an expression around the mouth that we dub the "archaic smile." The Greeks were unspoiled, perhaps unimaginative, concerning the forms of their gods. Unlike most ancient peoples they had no preconceived ideas whereby a deity differed from a human being. Man was the measure of all things to the Greek; and even his gods could not overstep this persistent ideal. We observe, therefore, that the evolution of the image was a continual striving toward an exact reproduction of the human form. The life infused in early work by means of the forced smile and large, protruding eyes gradually gives way to more subtle means. The musculature of the body is progressively more closely observed and faithfully followed; the sculptured anatomy acquires better physiological unity and more graceful proportions.</page><page sequence="3">GREEK AND HINDU GODS 337 ~44 (~q* _J I.~3 - 7-/ (G( 3 \Q The Greeks adored the whole man; and by the time of the Golden Age, or the Fifth Century, the head was of no more importance than any other part of the body of similar magnitude. The face, no longer concentrated upon for imparting life to the figure, became relaxed to the point of looking rather blank, as can be observed in the pediment sculpture from the Parthenon now in the British Museum. Movement in these well proportioned, carefully modeled gods and goddesses is important, and the loose drapery presses against their sinuous bodies as they advance, the ends of the cloth billowing behind. In contemporary single nudes the sloping hip, striding pose is preferred by such a master as the sculptor Polykleitos. During the Fourth and Third Centuries these tendencies were carried further. The metamorphosis from cold marble to warm flesh was completed through extreme refinement in the modeling and a thorough understanding of the natural pose. The figures of the gods became taller and lither. Praxiteles' seven-foot Hermes with the infant Dionysus in the Olympia Museum, produced about 350 B.C., furnishes us with an example of the traits mentioned (Fig. 1). The S-curve posture needs only to become a helix projected in space, and the final stage will have been reached. This occurs over a century later, as shown in the Nike of Samothrace (ca. 190 B.C.) in the</page><page sequence="4">338 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL Louvre, wherein the axis of the form spirals upward from a horizontal diagonal at the feet sloping backward to the right at an angle of forty-five degrees, coming to a completely frontal position at the shoulders. Realization of space in design was succeeded by a consciousness of environment hitherto ignored. Eutychides, a pupil of Lysippus, working early in the Third Century, portrayed surroundings symbolically. In his personification of the Tyche, or Fortune, of the City of Antioch, in the Vatican, the female figure represent- ing Seleucus Nicator's new capital in Syria poses on Mount Silpius as though seated on a throne, her right foot on the shoulder of the River God Orontes shown swimming at the base of the group. The bulging muscles, agonizing gestures and exaggerated expressions of later centuries (such as in the reliefs of the Pergamon Altar) can only be regarded as a decadence. To force such distortions into stone is to strain the material beyond its natural properties, the production method becoming a technical stunt rather than an artistic performance. We often overlook the fact that Greek sculpture-and Greek architecture as well-was brightly painted, time having spared us most of this garishness. Yet sufficient evidence from each period is preserved to assure us that such was the case. The painter of Praxiteles' sculptures was Nikias of Athens, who no doubt polychromed the hair, eyes, lips and perhaps cheeks of the heroic Hermes, and filled in minute details on the textile draped over the tree trunk which supports the infant Dionysus. The remaining flesh parts were waxed to further the illusion of the human epidermis. Plastic Indian deities had their inception during the third millennium B.C. Numerous mother-goddesses hastily modeled in clay, found in the Indus Valley, remind us of similar contemporary pieces from the Middle East. The triangular girdle about the pelvic region betrays her identity in both areas, and jewelry and headgear accentuate her near nudity. A fragmentary steatite bust of a bearded deity or priest, found at Mohenjo-daro, now in the Archeological Museum, with a shawl having an all-over pattern of sacred trefoils draped over the left shoulder, displays in its frontality and stiffness a parallel to primitive Greek figures, yet here there is a certain aloofness that transcends mere externalities and gives promise of what is to come. A small square steatite seal from the same site (now in the Central Asian Antiquities Museum, New Delhi) depicts in relief a divinity wearing great curved horns and a mask, and sitting cross-legged on a bench, sur- rounded by an elephant, tiger, rhinoceros, buffalo and goat, having the same withdrawn attitude as that of the aforementioned bearded individual. A tremendous time lapse intervenes between the Indus Valley culture and</page><page sequence="5">GREEK AND HINDU GODS 339 the next examples of sculptured divinities that have come down to us in India, dating from the introduction of stone carving on a large scale come from Iran. The upright cylindrical forms bespeak a background of an indigenous woodcarving tradition, combining the boldness of the latter with the meticulous attention to mitiutiae that was characteristic of the Persepolitan style. The production of gods during this period is limited to minor divinities due to the hegemony of Buddhism, made the official state religion by the Emperor Agoka (273-236 B.C.). The subjects include the guardian "kings" of the four quarters, the gods featured in the Buddha nativity legend, and especially the yaksas or earth beings, an example of these last being the headless statue from Patna in the Calcutta Indian Museum. During the first few centuries of the Christian Era, Buddhist art in the northwest of India (Gandhara) is based upon Classical models through the Greek colonies that had been implanted in this region at the time of the conquest of Alexander several hundred years earlier. The influence from the Mediterranean is detected in Eastern art from this moment onward in varying degrees. The Hindu pantheon comes into its own in Indian art beginning in the Gupta Period, or the Fourth and Fifth Centuries of our era, the traditions of which were revived by Harsavardhana in the Seventh, and persisted, with recurring interruptions, throughout the medieval period. Numerous ruling houses succeeded one another in the south of India, without too much effect upon the artistic tradition, other than in the matter of amount of patronage. Finally, in contrast to the Greeks who had been conquered by the Romans accepting their religious and cultural achievements, from the tenth century on the Indians were exposed to monotheistic fanatics come from the Near East who devastated every work of art remotely resembling an image. The result is that we must judge the glories of pre-twelfth century Hindu sculpture from small works that somehow escaped the Moslem invaders, or else look at later pieces, mostly to be found in the south as independent castings, or carved on temples in the northeast. Perhaps attention should be called to the fact that the gods and goddesses of classical India were, in general (at least superficially), counterparts of the deities of classical Greece. Zeus and Indra have common affinities, Poseidon and Varuna, Phoebus and Surya, Aphrodite and Sri, Eros and Kama, and so forth. Until Greek art became Hellenistic, which means when its center of production shifted to the Near East, it knew no symbolism; it had been preoccupied merely with surface appearance. Hindu religious figures, on the other hand, are greatly dependent upon symbolism. Theoretically, at least, there is no evolution in Hindu image-making. The</page><page sequence="6">340 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL artist envisages the finished piece when he begins; he proceeds according to strict rules having to do with forms, proportions, symbols and attributes. He resorts to no human models; and if his finished product is somewhat anthropomorphic, it is less so than the Greek. The parts of the figure are not so much anatomically related as serving a conceptual relationship, combining into an aesthetic unity. Let us consider a thirteenth-century Nataraj or Nategvara (The Dancing Lord-Siva) in the Museum van Aziatische Kunst, Amsterdam (Fig. 2). The god is four-armed and dances within a ring of flames, his right foot firmly planted on a small figure representing the Demon of Delusion, his left lifted high, one left arm held stiffly in front, the hand limp from the wrist, the right arm crooked at the elbow with hand uplifted-the gestures of deliverance and fearlessness. From his headdress flow to right and left the waters of the sacred River Ganges, personified in the tiny mermaid-like goddess on the left. A flame and drum in the outstretched arms symbolize destruction and re-creation. The flaming circle is the glory of the deity radiating in splendor from his pervad- ing being. In comparing the Nataraj to the Hermes of Praxiteles we must keep in mind that Indian sculpture is the successor, chronologically, of Classical art; and the latter can always draw on the experience of its predecessor, benefiting by its successes and failures. Also, we should remember that Indian male anatomy is quite different from that of the Greek, being more smooth and slender, completely lacking the bulging muscles and comparatively thick torso of western man. Although from the early Fifth to the middle of the Fourth Century B.C. the development in Greek sculpture seems to have been from human to divine forms, the distinction seems to lose all meaning when the culminating mani- festation is compared with the Indian deity. The Greek is readily seen to be still a man, only idealized. The Greek god is an individual, belonging to the pantheon family. The Hindu god also belongs to a pantheon, but each god contains the various aspects of every other god, or of the One God, each being the All-in-One or the One-in-All. The Greek example (Fig. 1) is shown as a messenger, a servant, pausing in his mission of transporting the infant Dionysus. He is oblivious to his surroundings, staring dreamily past the child god which he holds. The Indian figure is a celestial dancer, performing to etherial music. The Nataraj is undisputed master of his surroundings; he exists not in a setting, but the setting is of him, created by him, emanating from him. As the Greek sculptor has transformed translucent marble into</page><page sequence="7">GREEK AND HINDU GODS 341 warm flesh, the Indian sculptor has created his god out of the properties of the gleaming molten metal, retaining in the finished piece the character of his material. Thus the one work reflects the model, and the other the material. The Greek and Hindu image were both treated as though the carved or cast form itself were the deity. The Greek figure was washed with perfumed water and rubbed with sweet-smelling oils. The important Indian images were bathed with water from the sacred Ganges and then anointed with sandal paste. Athena was presented with the peplos for garment as the climax of the Panathenaic Procession. The Indian god was given offerings of flowers, lights and incense. Although the similarity of attitude of the Greeks and Hindus toward their respective gods is apparent, there is some distinction, The Greeks cared for the images and offered them gifts such as they, themselves, would like; their every thought concerning the gods was dominated and limited by their own race. The Hindus, on the other hand, regarded the matter as symbolic. It matters little what finite beings may care for. Ordinary water may be scented to charm human nostrils, but it is rancid liquescence compared to the spiritual sweetness of the Ganges waters that has flowed to earth through the tresses of Lord Siva. How can a bolt of material cover one who is all- pervading, whose mantle is the star-strewn cloak of heaven? More satisfying to the gods are the little lights that send out their beams in all directions, or the permeating aroma of incense or flowers, which is, like the deity, without limits, subtle and beyond understanding. The gifts to the gods, to the Hindus, are to be judged appropriate on mystic grounds. The worship of one or another of the tutelary divinities in Greece was a civic duty. An Athenian worshipped Athena, for whom his city was the name- sake; at Olympia one's respects were paid to Zeus, at Samos to Hera, at Delphi to Apollo, at Eleusis to Demeter, and at Ephesus in Asia Minor to Artemis or Cybele. The gods were rivals; and their affections were not to be tampered with. Often they had engaged in the most devastating belligerence among themselves, like in the contest between Athena and Poseidon over the soil of Attica. It would be unthinkable for the Hindu divinities to become involved one against another-being all of the same divinity. And for this selfsame reason it matters not which manifestation of the gods was worshipped, each accepting the devotions as unto himself. Jealousy among them was entirely out of the question. The Hindu gods (devas) combat the demons (asuras) in Indian mythology; but one notes that their natures are of entirely different character. Among the Hindus there is a moral responsibility towards the gods such as did not exist in Greece. The status quo of the universe</page><page sequence="8">342 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL depends upon their adoration. The Greek offered praise for more immediate and personal gains, such as for benefits in the home or victory of the political unit. As we can see there was a lack of universal quality to the gods of the Hellenes, and because of which they were doomed to extinction. Rejuvenated through amalgamation with deities from Asia Minor, Egypt and Persia they survived the Roman period until a fourth-century emperor combined attributes of Apollo, Mithra and Zorathushtra with those of a teacher from the Levant, thus creating the pattern of medieval religion. Those who continued to render homage to the old gods were called pagans-pagani, "country bump- kins." The new religion was a mystery religion; it was for everybody. The Hindu gods have suffered no decline in quantity of adoration. They exist in their age-old form, and have been adopted with variations in Mahlyina Buddhism. Brahmi and Sri are familiar figures in Japanese Buddhist shrines. Their versatility is manifold. One looks not merely upon their outward forms; one must gaze within. The depths are infinite. Genera- tion after generation devotes a lifetime to their contemplation and comes not to the end of it. The process is self-perpetuating.</page></plain_text>
