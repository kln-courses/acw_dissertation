<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gregorianum 79, 2 (1998) 231-246 The Gift of the Name: Moses and the Burning Bush* 'You are great, Lord, and highly to be praised' (Ps. 47.2): 'great is your power and your wisdom is immeasurable' (Ps. 146.5). Man, a little piece of your creation, desires to praise you, a human being 'hearing his mortality with him' (2 Cor. 4:10), carrying with him the wit ness of his sin and the witness that you 'resisi the proud' (I Pet. 5:5). Nev ertheless, to praise you is the desire of man, a little piece of your creation. Have mercy so that I may find words. (from the opening lines of St. Augustine's Confessioni') I have become worried lately about the God of the attributes — the God of omnipotence, eternity, wisdom, immutability and unity — the God of these divine names. Reflection on this God, whether of a philo sophical or a more contemplative nature, has been a uniting practice for Christians, Jews and Muslims. Yet lately this God, or this manner of speaking of God, has come under attack and it is not secular critics who are voicing criticisms but Christian preachers and theologians. 'This God', we hear, 'is remote and unfeeling'. ...'This powerful, impassable and eternai God is far from us. This is a God "over and against" us', and so on. Jiirgen Moltmann (no mean critic) puts it this way: If, in the manner of Greek philosophy, we ask what characteristics are 'appropriate' to the deity, then we have to exclude difference, diversity, . movement and suffering from the divine nature... Impassable, immovable, * Prof. Janet Martin Soskice, of the Divinity Faculty of Cambridge University, held the Joseph Gregory McCarthy Visiting Professorship in the Gregorian Faculty of Theology 1996/97. Her public lecture of May 2,1997, has been revised for this article. 1 Ali excerpts from the Confessions are from the translation by Henry Chadwick, Confessions (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992).</page><page sequence="2">232 JANET MARTIN SOSKICE united and self-sufficient, the deity confronts a moved, suffering and di vided world that is never sufficient for itself. Such a view, Moltmann suggests, may have sufficed in a pre-En lightenment theology where the ruling concept was 'God as supreme substance' but will not do for a post-Enlightenment (and especially) post-Enlightenment Protestant) view which begins from 'God as Ab solute Subject'. In the latter the emphasis must be on our experience and how, Moltmann asks, does God experience me? Focusing his criticisms on impassability he suggest that Christianity may never have developed 'a consistent Christian concept of God', but rather adopted 'the meta physical tradition of Greek philosophy, which it understood as "naturai theology" and saw as its own foundation'3. A number of other theologians have written that we can no longer relate with any sympathy to the God of the attributes4. Although Catholic theologians seem less likely to voice these complaints, nonetheless the tendency to downplay, or at least to sideline, the God of the attributes is tangible in Catholic worship. In popular hymn books (at least, in the English language ones) hymns praising the Immortai, invisible, God only wise in light inaccesible hid from our eyes... are now far less common than tunes which exhort us to Follow me, follow me, leave your home and family, leave your fishing nets and boats upon the shore. An element of this may be a laudable preference for hymns based on the gospels, nonetheless an overall impression is given that the fusty old God of the attributes is (or was) the God of Empire and Colony, a powerful God for the era of powerful nation states: ruling, judging, lord ing, 'nor wanting, nor hasting', and so on. In preference to a sagacious emperor, it seems we prefer a 'biblical' God. And yet a Biblical God, in 2 Jiirgen Moltmann, The Trinity and the Kingdom of God (London: SCM Press, 1982), ρ. 20. 3 Ibid., ρ. 22. 4 Amongst whom are Maurice Wiles, Jon Sorbino, David Jenkins, Don Cupitt, Mary Daly and Gordon Kaufman.</page><page sequence="3">THE GIFT OF THE NAME: MOSES AND THE BURNING BUSH 233 the words of the Bible is the inspiration of the more 'philosophical' hymn 'Immortai, invisible', which is based on I Timothy 1.17: To the eternai King, the undying, invisible and only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Why then, is the God of the attributes suffering liturgical and, in some cases, theological 'neglect'? One theologian who is an admittedly rather extreme case of the tendency to deplore the God of power and might is Professor Gordon Kaufman of Harvard Divinity School. While few wish to go as far as Kaufman, his views represent a consistent ex treme of positions enunciated by many others. Kaufman sees a clear development of religious thought whose cul mination in modernity will be that ali but the most idolatrous will discard a God conceived as infinite and almighty. He is clearly exasperated by theologians and especially by Christian philosophers who defend a God who he thinks no longer deserves defending. The God who is 'an arbi trary, imperiai potentate, a solitary eminence existing in glorious tran scendence of ali else' is, he tells us, a thing of the past. We can no longer think of God as 'an objectively existing powerful agent-self'5. We should not longer speak of God as 'creator/lord' or 'father' either, for these terms cannot be purged of the anthropomorphism responsible for the op pression (of the weak, of women, of the poor) in the past. Now if this is simply a warning against idolatrous reification then many might wish to agree with Kaufman. But he is not simply reminding us, as has almost every theologian before him, of the dangers of anthropomorphic lan guage. He is clear that we should move beyond belief in a God altogeth er. His is then a thoroughgoing theological anti-realism — we once need ed what he calls this 'God symbol', but we do not need it now. In fact its retention keeps us in a state of moral immaturity, forever waiting for a powerful deity to pick up the pieces of our fractured world. In the end there is little to distinguish Kaufman's position from atheism, deploying the rhetoric of religion where it suits our moral and social aspirations, but without 'God' except as a pious turn of phrase. Atheism, as Michael Buckley has reminded us, is not a uniform state — there are as many atheisms as their are 'Gods' which are rejected ! Gordon D.

Pailin, The Making and Remak ing of Christian Doctrine (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), ρ. 104.</page><page sequence="4">234 JANET MARTIN SOSKICE — a particular atheism is usually a rejection of a particular conception of God6. The first question to put to any atheistic strategy is, then, which 'God' does it reject? In Kaufman's case (and not his alone) it is a God who is solitary, arbitrary and imperiai — a God 'over and against us' whose very majesty deprives us of the power or the will to think and act for ourselves. The question to ask is whether we recognise this God? Is it really, as Kaufman assures us, the Christian God? It seems to me that we might recognise in his description a version of Newton's God, an eigh teenth century deity who occupies his everlasting day in making adjust ments to the cosmic frame. But is that God the God who Christians pray to as infinite, almighty and wise7? It is frankly hard to believe that the God Kaufman sketches for us in such lurid and oppressive colours could be the God who excited the love and devotion of Anselm or Aquinas, Augustine or Julian of Norwich — or, for that matter, that this could be the God of the Bible itself. Kaufman for his part does not doubt that his 'imperiai potentate' is the God of the Bible. He says this, In the Bible God stands behind and governs ali that exists. In this picture it was apparently the autonomous, free agent, the Ί' (ego) existing alone in its solitude, that was the core model on the basis of which the image/concept of God was constructed. When Moses, in a very early sto ry, asks the voice from the burning bush, 'Who are you? What is your name?, the answer that comes back to him is Ί AM; IAM WHO IAM' (Exod. 3:13-14, paraphrased). God is identified here as the great Ί AM', the ego-agent par excellence, sheer unrestricted agential power. Given this model, it is not surprising that God has often been conceived of as an all-powerful tyrant, a terrifying arbitrary force before whom women and men can only bow in awe and fear8. We have now reached the focal text from which this essay takes its title: Exodus 3 with its famous account of Moses' encounter with God in the burning bush. Let us consider the God who Kaufman finds there — this 'ego-agent par excellence' — this terrifying force before whom we tremble in awe and fear. Is not this alien and alienating 'agent' strangely 6 Michael Buckley, S.J., At the Origins of Modem Atheism (New Haven and Lon don: Yale University Press, 1987), see his Introduction. 1 Walter Kasper in The God of Jesus Christ makes a useful distinction between 'atheism' and 'a/theism', the latter being a quite proper rejection of Enlightenment theism (and not the God of Jesus Christ). 8 Kaufman, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="5">THE GIFT OF THE NAME: MOSES AND THE BURNING BUSH 235 familiar? Is it not indeed remarkably like the picture of God which David Hume demolished in the eighteenth century? Is this 'ego-agent' not re markably similar to the God which Feuerbach lauded as 'man made ide al' in the nineteenth, and to the picture of God from which Freud has tried to wean us in the twentieth century? Is this not a picture of the God whom Freud regards as a hangover from the childhood of the human race — the produci of our stubborn delusion that an omnipotent father can protect us from ali harm? What is surprising in our own time is that we find, not the Freuds, Feuerbachs and Humes, but professors of theol ogy like Kaufman engaged in this naturalising, atheistic exegesis of Christian texts. It seems Kaufman is singing a familiar song of modem atheism, but we dismiss him (and others like him) at our perii, for we cannot, without willful blindness, ignore the fact that this picture of the deity as a powerful, fearful tyrant is one which many atheistic and ag nostic modem people take to be an accurate picture of the God in whom Christians believe — and in ali honesty we may have to admit that some Christians think so, too9. It is well known that David Hume, especially in his Dialogues Con cerning Naturai Religion, effectively demolished the anthropomorphic picture of God as divine designer so favoured by eighteenth century British religious apologetics. But Hume also goes out of his way to dis credit the God of the classical attributes as well — the God of omni science, omnipotence, etemity and so on. He does this in his essay on the Naturai History of Religion, a naturai companion piece to the Dialogues. In the Naturai History Hume explains or, we may say, invents a history of religion from its origins which sees it as driven always by the emotions of craven fear and blind hope. Since human society improves 'from rude be ginnings to a state of greater perfection', Hume concludes that 'polythe ism or idolatry was, and necessarily must have been, the first and most ancient religion of mankind'10. Indeed, says Hume, (showing little sensiti ty for Jewish feelings) until about Ί700 years ago' (roughly 50 CE) 'ali mankind were idolators'. A 'barbarous and necessitous animai' such as human beings were at the first origin of society, must necessarily have had a groveling and familiar notion of superior powers. Primitive man, concemed with the terrors which threatened his life, conceived of a multi ' While writing this, I heard an interview with a film producer who said that, since he wanted to create an atmosphere of darkness, power and fear in a particular scene, he set it — in a church! i rest my case. 10 David Hume, 'The Naturai History of Religion' in Four Dissertations (1757) (Bristol: Thoemmes Press, 1995), p. 3.</page><page sequence="6">236 JANET MARTIN S0SKICE tude of deities to invoke for protection, and since 'there is a universal ten dency amongst mankind to conceive ali beings like themselves,' human beings attributed human characteristics to these gods. Even monotheism, according to Hume, although 'ancient and widespread' owes little of its success to reason, but is simply a more refined polytheism. People (the simple and barbarie) will naturally choose a particular god as their patron and, having done so, will endeavour by every act to insinuate themselves into his favour; and supposing him to be pleased, like themselves, with praise and flattery, there is no eulogy or exaggera tion which will be spared in their address to him. (ρ. 45) Praise of their 'god' as the greatest god soon leads to praise of him as the 'only god' and, elevating their deities to the utmost bounds of perfection, at last begets the attributes of unity and infinity, simplicity and spirituality. (p. 55) Monotheism, in sum, is only the highest (and therefore most con cealed) form of idolatry and the attributes, far from being the reasonable results of philosophical or spiritual reflection, are nothing but metaphysi cal grovellings. The servile and fear-driven believer, anxious to please a capricious deity, will invoke his 'god' as not only 'good' but 'very good' — in fact the greatest of ali gods; as not only old, but eternai; not only powerful but omnipotent, and so we go on. Where God is so elevated, says Hume (anticipating Kaufman, or for that matter Nietzsche and Freud), the human mind is abased. Monotheism is furthermore not morally preferable to polytheism — rather the reverse. Polytheism, while untidy and primitive, at least is tolerant... but those religions which maintain 'the unity of god' are intolerant, implacable and narrow. A re fined and reasonable religion, Hume concludes, would be quite accept able to him — but as to religions as they are actually found, You will scarcely be persuaded, that they are other than sick men's dreams. (p. 115) Hume's would-be historical account of religions, then, in fact con tains an only thinly concealed attack on that tradition of philosophical and spiritual theology sometimes called negative theology. This kind of theology, far from being a saving moment in which the believer attempts to purge her thought of anthroporphism is, according to Hume, no more</page><page sequence="7">THE GIFT OF THE NAME: MOSES AND THE BURNING BUSH 237 reasonable a practice than the base idolatiy of which it is a sophisticated derivative. It should be noted that this puncturing of the pretensions of negative theology is of utmost importance to Hume's case, since his overall attack on the coherence of religious belief depends upon showing that religious language is either vapid or grossly anthropomorphic. On Hume's account even the predicates of negation turn out to be anthropomorphisms; even that kind of cautious and qualified apophatic language by which Christian theologians have warned of the dangers of presuming we know and name God directly is no more than servile toadying after ali. Part of Freud's 'anti-religious genius' was to confiate his own an tipathetic picture of God's fatherhood with the distant and powerful God of the attributes already familiar to European critics of religion. The God of Exodus becomes, in Freud's terms, the murdered prunai father who is behind every divine figure, and the father who is giver of the law. While echoing, in The Future of an Ilusion, the Humean contention that reli gion for the most part was little more than sick men's dreams, Freud goes beyond both Hume and Feuerbach in his willingness to borrow, or perhaps to 'recycle', the religious language of both Judaism and Chris tianity to suit his own theoretical needs. His talking cure revolved around 'our God, the word' and his late work, Moses and Monotheism, can be read as an extended and eccentric modem midrash on the Exodus story, in which Freud himself appears at times to be Moses, leading the people from pre-scientific slavery to the promised land of psychoanalysis. This borrowing of overtly religious terminology is even more apparent in Freud's famous French interpreter, Jacques Lacan (himself of a Catholic background). Lacan's essay, 'The Function of Language in Psychoanaly sis', for instance, is filled with reference to 'the Word' of the patient, with quotes from scripture (sometimes in Greek), and with theological terminology such as anamnesis, 'nature and grace' and so on". Neither does Lacan neglect to provide his own psychoanalytic gloss on Exodus, providing his own reading of the famous Exodus 3 passage. Moses at the burning bush, according to Lacan, meets the Symbolic father who is lit erally capable of laying down the law — of saying Ί AM WHO AM'. Here, analytically, is the fixed point of the law to which ali who wish to enter psychic maturity must relate. " Jacques Lacan, Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis, trans. Anthony Wilden (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1968).</page><page sequence="8">238 JANET MARTIN SOSKICE Since almost everyone who has ever written a book has said some thing about Moses and the burning bush, it might seem only fair that Freud and Lacan be allowed their analytic allegories of the text as well. The problem is that many modera westeraers have been brought up on a (largely unnoticed) diet of psychoanalytic terminology, and take Freud's reading not as a reading of Exodus, but as the reading — gospel truth. In a new kind of gnosis, the 'real meaning' of the God of Jewish and Chris tian origins is taken to be this Oedipal father, standing over and against us at the gates of psychic pre-history. Many who would shudder at fun damentalist exegesis by Christian theologians swallow uncritically those of a Freud or a Lacan. Perhaps indeed Freud's God is the real intellectual ancestor of Kaufmann's ego-agent par excellence, before whom we can only cower and tremble. But is it the God who Moses meets on Sinai, and who Jews and Christian subsequently have associated with the burn ing bush? I quote the relevant passage in full: 3.1-6 Moses was looking after the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, priest of Midian. He led his flock to the far side of the wilderness and carne to Horeb, the mountain of God. There the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in the shape of a flame of fire, coming from the middle of a bush. Moses looked; there was the bush blazing but it was not being burnt up. Ί must go and look at this strange sight', Moses said 'and see why the bush is not burnt'. Now Yahweh saw him go forward to look, and God called to him from the middle of the bush. 'Moses, Moses!' he said, 'Here I am' he an swered. 'Come no nearer' he said. 'Take off your shoes, for the place on which you stand is holy ground. I am the God of your father', he said 'the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'. At this Moses covered his face, afraid to look at God. Ex. 3.13-15 Then Moses said to God, Ί am to go, then, to the sons of Is rael and say to them, "The God of your fathers has sent me to you". But if they ask me what his name is, what am I to teli them?' And God said to Moses, Ί Am who I Am. This' he added 'is what you must say to the sons of Israel: "I Am has sent me to you'". And God also said to Moses, 'You are to say to the sons of Israel: "Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you". This is my name for ali time; by this name I shall be invoked for ali gen erations to come'. Moses, whose very name (in popular Hebrew etymology) meant 'drawn out' had been 'drawn out' of the Nile, miraculously saved by Pharaoh's daughter. The next we hear of him is as a grown man — edu</page><page sequence="9">THE GIFT OF THE NAME: MOSES AND THE BURNING BUSH 239 cated as an Egyptian, but apparently with some social conscience about the conditions of his fellow Israelites. Like many new to pastoral min istry, he is unfortunately over-zealous, and kills an Egyptian who he sees striking a Hebrew. This act, not likely to impress the Egyptians, does lit tle for his reputation with the Hebrews either, who want little to do with such a wild man. Moses feels it wise to remove himself to Midian where he finds employment as a shephard and marries the non-Jewish Zippo rah. Following the narrative line as it is given us, we might imagine that tending of his father-in law's sheep was to be the only steady and relax ing job Moses ever had. Seeking new grazing land in 'the far side of the desert', Moses comes to Horeb — a place of doublé isolation, a mountain in a desert — and his life is changed once and for ali. Moses looked, we are told, and there was the bush blazing but it was not being burnt up. Ί must go and look at this strange sight', Moses said, 'and see why the bush is not burnt'. Then Yahweh called, 'Moses, Moses'. 'Here I am' he answered. 'Come no nearer. Take off your shoes, for the place on which you stand is holy ground. 1 am the God of your father — the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob'. Let us consider this, not in terms of a source-critical analysis, but by means of a post-critical, narrative reading12. (If Freud, Lacan and Kauf man are to be allowed this license why should we not claim it, too?) Notice then that Moses does not appear from the narrative to be particularly impressed by the initial sight of the burning bush. Rather he is curious. His response sees more, 'Odd, a bush which is burning and not consumed.... I must have a closer look'. It is when God speaks to him from the bush that Moses appears truly awed. This is not, then, in its first moments an 'awe-inspiring theophany'. Lacan, for ali the idiosyn cracies of his reading of Exodus, has at least noticed that this decisive revelation of God to Moses is in the medium of speech, in words13. 12 We will not, for instance, consider suggestions that the three names belong to dif ferent traditions brought together in the one text — 'Elohistic', 'Priestly', etc. 13 Walter Brueggemann notes that this is not so much a 'theophany' as a 'voice to voice encounter'. 'Exodus 3: Summons to Holy Transformation', in ed. Stephen E. Fowl, The Theological Interpretation of Scripture (Oxford: Blackwell, 1997) p. 157.</page><page sequence="10">240 JANET MARTIN SOSKICE God calls Moses by name — 'the drawn out one', first from the wa ter and now from the desert — and tells him to take off his shoes. And then, importantly, God gives Moses His name. This is not yet Ί AM WHOI AM'. Rather God says, Ί am the God of Abraham, Isaac and Ja cob', the God, that is, of Moses' ancestors. This name is repeated at least five times over the next few chapters of the book, by God, and finally by Moses. God tells Moses that he has seen the misery of his people, Israel, in Egypt and that he means to deliver them. Furthermore he, Moses, is to be the agent of this delivery. Moses is to go to Pharaoh and bring the sons of Israel out of bondage14. Far from crumbling in front of this 'all-powerful tyrant before whom we can only bow in awe and fear', Moses at this stage clearly wonders whether God has really thought about what he is suggesting. Moses has ali kinds of objections — he can't speak well, Pharaoh won't listen to him, and so on15. Moses, no born hero, begins to haggle... 'Who am I to go before Pharoah'...'I shall be with you' is God's reply. This promise, Ί shall be with you' from God, one might think, would be good enough for most people — but Moses is even less certain about his reception from the Is raelites than by Pharoah. What' he says 'if the sons of Israel ask me what your name is — what am I to teli them'? At this stage God gives a second name. And God said to Moses Ί AM WHO I AM' — you must say to the sons of Israel Ί AM has sent me to you'. (3.13-14) Then follows a third name, the Tetragrammaton, You are to say to the sons of Israel: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has sent me to you. This is my name for ali time; by this name I shall be invoked for ali generations to come. (3.15) So then, three names are given in this sequence ot text, names whose origins are perhaps lost in the overlapping layers of originating textual traditions, but names whose significance, in this final canonical 141 confess to unhappiness in using the male personal pronoun for God in discussing this most cautious and numinous locus of biblical naming. It is not clear textually that this is a 'he-God', although it is clearly 'the God of Moses' fathers'. 15 Brevard Childs speaks of the prophet's resistance to his inclusion in the divine pian. See Brevard S. Childs, Exodus: A Commentar/ (London: SCM Press, 1974).</page><page sequence="11">THE GIFT OF THE NAME: MOSES AND THE BURNING BUSH 241 form, have been meditateci upon for generations by Jews and subse quently by Christians. Of these three it cannot be doubted that Ί AM WHOI AM\ the name which is no name, has exercised the most fascination for Christian theologians, especially those whom we associate with 'negative' or mys tical theology. Its suggestion of metaphysical ultimacy, of God as 'Being Itself, was attractive to Platonically-formed theologians of the early church. The Septuagint translation of the Hebrew (ehyeh - asher - ehyeh) as 'Ego eimi ho órì acted as an encouragement to just such a metaphysi cal reading. Nor were Christians alone in this. Stéphane Moses points out that not only Christians but many Jews followed in the onto-theolog ical tradition pioneered by the Septuagint — Maimonides, Buber and Rosenzweig ali invoke a picture of 'trans-temporal stasis' in their treat ments of Ί AM WHO I AM'16. Today most scholars emphasise that such a reading does not do justice to the Hebrew text with its doublé future of the verb 'to be'. Metaphysical ultimacy — pure — (so to speak) was not of much concern, we are told, to those who wrote the Pentateuch. Amongst these voices, Walter Kasper suggests that the verb 'haya' here means not so much 'to be' as 'to effect' or 'to be effective'. The name is a promise that God will be with Israel in an effective way. Brevard Childs similarly says the name emphasises the actuality of God — so we might write it as Ί am there, wherever it may be — I am really there'. Stéphane Moses suggests that this name can be seen a high point in a series of names of God which begins in Genesis, with Abraham and ends with the first of the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20, Ί am YH WH your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery'. And it is not only God who is the subject of naming. Abram is renamed 'Abraham' for he will be the father of nations; Isaac is given his name from Sarah's 'laugh'. Naming in these texts is not simply a matter of tagging or simple denomination — it is rather a practice, a practice which locates a certain individuai or place within the emergent, symbolic, remembered history of Israel. In the divine self-designation to Moses in Exodus 3, God is placed as the God of Israel's history. Moses is to know that what he meets is the God of Israel's past (of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob), of its present (who sees its suffering) and of its future (the God who will lead them from slavery to the promised land). 16 Stéphane Moses, '"Je Serai Qui Je Serai".

Olivetti, Filosofia della Rivelazione (Rome: Cedam, 1994), pp. 572-3.</page><page sequence="12">242 JANET MARTIN SOSKICE Contemporary Jewish writers emphasise the specificity of this dis closure on Sinai — this God speaks at this moment of Israel's history, and for this specific purpose. IAM WHOIAM is not an eternai, philosophi cal abstraction but the God who Israel has met in her historical actuality. Jon Levenson is at pains to argue that the religion of Israel is not a philo sophical system. Israel's origins, as recounted in her sacred texts, are not cosmic and primordial (as is the creation of the world) but in a named place with a named man. Truth comes to Israel through the medium of history, and not despite it, and Israel knows her God through her history17. Wed as we Christians may be to readings of Exodus 3 in terms of metaphysical ultimacy, these better (and Jewish) readings of the Hebrew text add richly to our understanding of Moses and the Burning Bush. It is a God of presence and action, and not of stasis, who addresses himself to Moses from the bush — a God who has acted, acts, and will act. This is very much a God with and for Israel, and not a God of philosophical stasis. At the begining of his Mystical Theology, and in direct allusion to Moses' ascent of Sinai, Pseudo-Dionysius prays that we will be led, up beyond unknowing and light, up to the farthest, highest peak of mystic scripture where the mysteries of God's word lie simple, absolute and unchangeable in the brilliant darkness of a hidden silence18. This would seem to be exactly the kind of abstracting and allegoris ing treatment of Exodus 3 that Jews find so annoying in Christian texts. What then are Christians to do with their inheritance of Platonised read ings of the Exodus texts, readings dear to the mystical tradition? Certain ly Christians should be careful not to render the story of the burning bush metaphysical and only that. We must take to heart the Jewish insistence on the specificity of that particular word at that particular moment in Is rael's history. But we can, I believe, defend the integrity of Christian neg ative theology, too, with its meditations on God's eternity, impassibility and unity, since in the hands of great theologians like Gregory of Nyssa, " Jonathan Sacks, the Chief Rabbi of England, makes a similar point in saying Jewish thought is not so much logicai as chronological — a lived history. See his Faith in the Future (London:, Darton, Longman and Todd, 1995). See also Peter Ochs, 'Three Postcritical Encounters with the Burning Bush', in ed. Fowl, op. cit., on the specificity of this divine disclosure. 18 In ed.

Perhaps the most powerful western meditation on the God of the at tributes (the God who Kaufman finds so difficult and remote) is to be found in Augustine's Confessions. Here God's omniscience and om nipresence, his unity and impassiblity need scarcely to be discussed — and are not discussed in philosophical terms — since the text simply dis plays them. Augustine's God is 'omnipresent' because God is, simply, al ways present to Augustine — and was so even when Augustine was not aware of it. How do we know God is always there for Augustine? Be cause Augustine talks to his God, in any place, at any time — 'this, Ο Lord, you knew'. Augustine displays the presence of his God by his lit erary (and doxological) practice. There is no time at which God is not, no place in which God is not, no secret centre to the soul where God is not. The God of the attributes is not far away but near, very near — and so Augustine is able to mix, willy-nilly, and without embarassment, the language of divine perfection with the language of the Psalms and gospels, because ali are terms of God's intimacy with us. Who then are you, my God? What, I ask, but God who is Lord? For 'who is the Lord but the Lord', or 'who is God but our God?' (Ps. 17:32). Most high, utterly good, utterly powerful, most omnipotent, most merciful and most just, deeply hidden yet most intimately present, perfection of both beauty and strength, stable and incomprehensible, immutable and yet changing ali things, never new, never old.... you love without burning, you are jealous in a way that is free of anxiety... You recover what you find, yet have never lost'". (pp 4-5) The recognition that Ί AM WHO IAM' is 'God with us', that the God of the philosophers is the God of Jesus Christ, is one Augustine makes when he moves from neo-Platonism to full Christian commitment. With the acceptance of the startling claim of the Jews that God has acted in their human history, and of the even more startling Christian claim that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, living a human history, Au gustine comes to the recognition that history, human temporalità lives as lived, far from being a distraction from things eternai, is precisely the on ly place where we can meet and know that God who is eternai Lord20.

Similarly Augustine comes to know God's omniscience not as the final deduction of some neo-Platonic theorem (however helpful he continues to find neoplatonism as a staging post) but because standing where he now stands he can see that God always knew and always knows his (Au gustine's) ways. God is powerful because he has acted powerfully in Au gustine's fife, changeless because always present to him. It is precisely in human history that Ί AM WHOIAM' has disclosed himself to us. With this insight Augustine can begin to write his own human history, which is his Corifessions. The metaphysical attributes are not discarded, rather their meanings are only given in fullness through God's self-disclosure — through revelation. For this God who acts in lived lives, whether that of the cosmos, of Israel, or Augustine, ultimacy and intimacy are one. We are brought back to the words with which this essay begins, words of prayer with which the Confessions open. It's often remarked that Augustine begins this book with an epistemological quandary — how can he search for God if he does not yet know who or what it is he is searching for2'? Yet Augustine puts a prior question in the very first sen tences of the book — how, he wonders, can he praise God? 'How shall I cali upon my God, my God and Lord?'. How can he praise God if he does not know how to cali upon him? How can he 'name' God without mis naming God? Here the former professor or rhetoric agonises over how he can speak at ali about the God who is beyond ali naming. This is not just an epistemological and metaphysical question — it is a spiritual and a doxological one — for to name God is to risk making God into an object or an idol, and this is as trae of the most seemingly non-idolatrous names he may use of God, such as eternai, immutable, omniscient, as it is of the more obviously metaphorical names like rock, shield and fortress22. Augustine, we may be so bold as to say, has already anticipated the dangers Freud and Kaufman feel they have discovered in the twentieth century — that our speaking of God may be a false speaking, simply ex alted and disguised ways of speaking once more about ourselves. This, for someone setting out to write a spiritual autobiography, must be an ever-present danger. At one level Augustine faces the problem of any of the prophets (whose language he echos) — how can a man of unclean lips speak of God. But for Augustine the problem is even more acute 21 See for example Denys Turner's discussion in The Darkness ofGod: Negativity in Christian Mysticism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995). 22 Gordon Kaufman's God, or the one he credits to historical Christian theology, would be just such a philosophical idol.</page><page sequence="15">THE GIFT OF THE NAME: MOSES AND THE BURNING BUSH 245 since he has been in the past a rented 'mouth', speaking false words for payment and selling his skills to studente whose object in acquiring them were avance and self-aggrandizement. Augustine has been then, linguis tic tart and pimp in one — words not too strong for the loathing Augus tine feels for his past life — not of sexual concupiscence, but as a rhetorician. How can he, Augustine, speak truly of God? The answer is that he cannot speak if God does not first cali, and so Augustine beseeches his Lord, repeatedly, in this first chapter that he may find words, that God will give him words — 'Speak to me so that I may hear'. 'Allow me to speak'. The answer to his quandary is given in a practice, not a propostion — in the practice of prayer. God cannot be called down by human naming, however philosophically exalted this may be (here Hume is right) but surely, as Augustine says, 'you may be called upon in prayer that you may be known'. This prayer is, as he points out, itself already a gift. My faith, Lord, calls upon you. It is your gift to me. You breathed it into me by the humanity of your Son, by the ministry of your preachers. (Book I.i(D) God has given himself to be named. What Kaufman's neglects to note of the fearful encounter in Exodus 3 is the remarkable fact that when Moses asks a name of his God, he is given one. God is established as the God who gives his name to Israel, and as the God who is named by his acts for Israel. That is the final sense of Ί AM WHO IAM'. Au gustine's recognition is that we can speak of God only because, as to Moses and Israel, God has first spoken to us. For 'those who have nothing to say or don't want to know anything', says Jacques Derrida, 'it is always easy to mimic the technique of negative theology'23. The language of the divine attributes is readily conceived, now as in the past, as either a language of an 'over and against God' (Kaufman and Freud) or, alternatively as vacuous (Feuerbach). Yet de spite its cautions and qualifications this 'rhetoric of negative determina tion' is by no means vacuous and not, in the hands of theologians like Au gustine-or Dionysius, a technique for 'those who have nothing to say'. Derrida, agnostic, here proves an unexpected ally, for, in contrast with Feuerbach, he does not seem to find theological apophaticism to be 23 'How to Avoid Speaking: Denials' in ed. Harold Coward and Toby Forshay, Derrida and Negative Theology, (Albany: SUNY Press, 1992), ρ. 75. 24 Ibid, ρ. 98.</page><page sequence="16">246 JANET MARTIN SOSKICE trapped in a circle of empty negation. The reason for this is the place it gives to prayer. Why do these texts, like that of Augustine, or Aquinas, or Gertrude of Helfta, or any number of others, begin with prayer? The prayer which precedes these apophatic utterances is, as 'the address to the other', a moment which is more than a pious preamble. One must begin with supplication, for the power of speaking and of speaking well comes from God — Derrida quotes Dionysius, 'to That One who is the Cause of ali good, to Him who has first given us the gift to speak and then, to speak well'. And Derrida continues, 'This is why apophatic discourse must also open with a prayer that recognizes, assigns, or ensures its destination: the Other as Referent of a legein which is none other than its Cause'24. Far from condemning the theological enterprise, there is in Derrida's essay the wistful implication that only the language of true theology, language whose destination is assured not by verbal domination but by grace, is truly language at ali. To be a theologian, we might say, is always to stand under the primacy of the signified over the signifier (an exact reversai of what Derrida thinks to be the case for language in general) but at the same time to know the signified can only be named through gift. The problem with which the Derrida's reader is left is not one for theological language, but for any speaking or theory of speech which is atheistic. How, indeed, can Derrida speak if he cannot first pray? Above ali this is true of course when speaking of God. The naming of God can never be, without risk of idolatry a matter of simple denomi nation. Its foundation is gift — the gift of God's self-disclosure in histo ry (both Israel's and our own) — and practice, the practice of prayer which is itself a gift. Our faith, as Augustine says, is God's gift, through his Son, through his preachers. This speaking of God, made possible be cause God first speaks to us, opens for us not only the possibility of praise but of our true sociality, our true and truthful use of the shared possession that is speech. Augustine's search for self-knowledge and true speaking finds its conclusions not with a 'cogito ergo surrì but in 'only say the word, Lord, and I shall be healed'.
