<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHICAL TOPICS VOL. 32, NOS. 1 &amp; 2, SPRING &amp; FALL 2004 Responsibility for Character Andrew Eshleman University of Arkansas, Little Rock Most philosophical treatments of responsibility have little to say about respon- sibility for character, focusing instead on responsibility for actions, omissions, and their consequences. There are perhaps three interrelated reasons for this relative neglect: (1) the historical ascendancy of ethical theories focusing almost exclusively on the Tightness or wrongness of actions; (2) the belief that one is responsible for something only if it is within one's voluntary control; and (3) the widespread conviction that the manner in which one's character is originally acquired is predominantly nonvoluntary. I will have nothing to say about the first of these, except to note that the recent resurgence of inter- est in virtue ethics provides an occasion to revisit the topic. Skepticism about responsibility for character may seem plausible on the basis of the last two. That is, many would likely agree that given the constitutive role played by in- born temperament and early formative influences working at the nonrational level, one's original character cannot be wholly, or even perhaps primarily, the causal product of voluntary choices "all the way down," so to speak, and so not something for which one can be responsible. Skepticism about responsibility for character strikes some as troubling enough, but others have argued that matters are even worse. Extending the implications of such skepticism, they argue that since one is not responsible for one's character, one is not responsible for many, if not all, of one's actions since they are expressions of that character.1 Though providing a full account 65</page><page sequence="2">of responsibility for character is beyond the scope of this paper, I will sketch the central basis of such an account and thereby a basis for resisting skepti- cism about responsibility for character. I won't attempt to deny that our original dispositions to behave in morally relevant ways are instilled non- voluntary during the earliest stages of our moral development, yet I will argue that in a later stage of development, we can be said to take or assume responsibility for those rudimentary dispositions and thereby transform them into genuine traits of character. Since this taking or assuming of responsibility is generated by the practical reflection accompanying a matur- ing agent's voluntary behavior, I hope to make plausible a sense in which we can be said to have made our characters our own through our voluntary choices. The central claim to elucidate is, of course, the way in which we may be said to take or assume responsibility for our character. The proposal defended here will be that we do so through a process of identifying ourselves with the desires that constitute the motivational core of our virtues and vices (or sometimes by failing to identify ourselves with the desires constitutive of a virtue). This is not a novel proposal, it having surfaced several times in the past thirty years in the continually expanding discussion of the role of identi- fication in accounts of agency-related topics. However, to date, it has received little sustained treatment. Part of the reason for this, I suspect, is that much of the literature has been directed toward what is regarded as the more basic task of articulating what, if any, notion of identification is relevant to the explication of free and/or autonomous agency. We need not await the out- come of this discussion, for there is a growing awareness that one need not suppose that there is but one notion of identification that will be relevant across agency-related topics. In fact, one of the principal aims of this paper is to suggest that some of the questions about how best to understand the notion of identification can be resolved and some central objections addressed by devoting more careful attention to the particular philosophical context within which the notion is to be employed. In the present case, the issue is whether the concept of identification can cast light on how it is that we may be said to be morally responsible for our traits of character. Thus, setting the appropriate context involves a specifica- tion of first, the nature of character traits, and, second, the nature of those responsibility-ascribing practices focused on the assessment of character. After a brief discussion of the nature of character traits, I address the second of these by extending P. F. Strawson's treatment of the reactive attitudes to highlight a distinct set of character- focused attitudes through which we regard one another as responsible for our traits of character, as well as the kind of considerations that tend to disrupt those attitudes by undermining confidence in the attributability of the relevant traits. This lays the founda- tion for two subsequent arguments. In the first of these I argue that it is the 66</page><page sequence="3">capacity to engage in higher-order identifications informed by one's evalua- tive judgments that allows its possessor to become the sort of agent whose dispositional traits can become morally attributable to her. This claim is developed further in the next section in response to the objection that eval- uation-informed accounts of identification presume an implausible degree of rational reflection during an agent's development. Finally, in my conclud- ing argument, I contend that while higher-order evaluation-informed iden- tification is sufficient for the moral attributability of a trait, it is not necessary because one can also be responsible for a character fault by negligently fail- ing to identify oneself with the corresponding virtue. I. THE CONTENT OF OUR CHARACTER Like most terms of philosophical interest, the term "character" has a range of accepted meanings. Here, it should be understood to refer to a set of fairly stable morally relevant traits - i.e., standing dispositions to perceive, feel, deliberate, choose, and act in a particular morally significant way when faced with a range of circumstances exhibiting features relevant to the expression of the trait. For example, to be compassionate involves a tendency to notice when one is in the presence of someone in need, experience sympathy or empathy as a result, think wisely about how one might address the perceived need, and choose to do so out of concern for the other if it is in one's power to do so. The presence of a character trait is inferred not only from an indi- vidual's intentional behavior but also from other cues - e.g., her emotional reactions to her circumstances. Such traits are not only objects of ethical appraisal - as virtues or vices - but are also commonly regarded as provid- ing a basis in everyday contexts for explaining and predicting a person's behavior and emotional responses. For example, we might say that Mark's selfishness prevented him from even considering how his frequent weekend outings with friends entail that his partner must share an unfair share of child-care duties at home or that Maria can be counted on because of her loyalty to not sit by idly at the meeting while her colleagues are disparaged unfairly. An essential feature of what might be called the "substantive" moral virtues and vices (e.g., being just/unjust, compassionate/cruel, generous/self- ish, honest/ deceitful, etc.) is that they are constituted - at least in part - by some distinctive motivational content. For example, possessing the trait of compassion reflects something important about one's standing attitudes - namely, that they include a desire to alleviate unjustified suffering when it is encountered. The substance of a moral virtue or vice is determined not only by such content but also by how that content is ordered. The issue here is the 67</page><page sequence="4">priority assigned to satisfaction of the relevant desires. Consider the fact that some persons seem unwilling to sacrifice truth for the sake of other goods like the prevention or alleviation of suffering, yet most of us to varying degrees are disposed to subordinate our desire to tell the truth in at least some circumstances where that desire conflicts with the desire not to inflict harm or to help another person in urgent need of our aid. In general, possession of a virtue or vice is a matter of degree. While there are some virtuosos of both virtue and vice, most of us anticipate that what virtue we attain will be of a modest sort and view our compatriots as scattered along the moral continuum. Furthermore, what degree of substan- tive virtue we attain depends in part on the degree to which we exhibit two other kinds of supporting virtue.2 The first of these and the corresponding vices are managerial in nature (e.g., being strong of will/weak of will, patient/impatient). These traits seem not to presuppose that one's standing motivational structure exhibit any particular content. Both the saint and the moral monster may be patient and strong of will. For this reason, managerial virtues and vices seem best understood as skills, or the lack thereof, in man- aging the elements of one's motivational makeup, whatever it happens to be.3 Finally, substantive virtue requires the virtue of practical acumen, the ability to perceive the morally salient features of one's circumstances, properly gauge their relative importance, and reason about how best to realize one's values and other ends in light of them, including how to weigh competing values and/or other ends. Again, as in the case of managerial traits, whether one possesses such practical intelligence (or suffers a lack thereof) is not deter- mined by the content of one's motivational makeup. Unfortunately, some vicious persons are also persons of great practical acumen.4 In what follows, my main focus will be on the substantive moral virtues and vices - in particular, their motivational content - since it is the elements of this content and the priorities assigned to their satisfaction that are the most plausible targets for the sort of identification proposed as relevant to being morally responsible for one's character. From this point forward then, "character" or "character trait" should be taken as shorthand for the motiva- tional core of virtues and vices unless otherwise noted. Though a full account of responsibility for character would need also to address the complementary virtues and vices of motivational management and practical acumen, I will make no attempt to address responsibility for these traits here.5 II. REGARDING ONE ANOTHER AS RESPONSIBLE FOR TRAITS OF CHARACTER To reflect on ascriptions of moral responsibility is to reflect on a set of atti- tudes and practices central to our interpersonal form of life. One of the 68</page><page sequence="5">important legacies of P. F. Strawson's work on moral responsibility has been to provide us with a more fine-grained understanding of the emotions involved in regarding one another as responsible for the actions we perform and the central place these emotions have in our interpersonal relationships, emotions such as resentment, indignation, guilt, and gratitude. These "reac- tive attitudes" are attitudinal responses to the perceived good will or lack thereof expressed in a person's actions and are only appropriately expressed by and addressed to fellow members of the moral community - i.e., those capable of understanding and responding appropriately to moral norms.6 Imagining a life without these emotions is difficult. Such a life would be, at the very least, strange, and by most accounts, seriously impoverished. Much of the literature on freedom and moral responsibility is driven by the ques- tion of whether or not these attitudes and the moral practices associated with them can be justified, given what we know about human beings and the wider universe to which they belong. Strawson s general strategy in approach- ing this question was to work backward from the nature of these moral emo- tions to an understanding of the conditions under which they might be said to be the appropriate response to an individual's behavior. That is, on this approach both the need for and nature of an account of responsibility is deter- mined by our understanding of those emotions central to our practice of regarding one another as responsible. This is a strategy I will extend by pursu- ing it in relation to another important and related class of moral sentiments. The class of reactive attitudes central to Strawson's discussion and most subsequent accounts reflecting its influence is essentially backward looking.7 In other words, they are responses directed toward a person for a particular action or state of affairs in the past. As highlighted earlier, we attribute virtues or vices to persons on the basis of their past behavior and other relevant cues, but the emotions accompanying trait attributions of this sort seem to repre- sent a distinct class of reactive attitudes insofar as their focus of assessment is the present rather than the past. Perhaps paradigmatic of this class are forms of disdain, shame, and esteem (both other and self-directed forms of the latter).8 These emotions, though generated by observation of events in the past, are themselves not backward looking but reactions instead to what are perceived to be a person's enduring qualities - present qualities that we regard as subject to normative assessment. This difference is reflected in a common way of distinguishing guilt from shame: While guilt may be associ- ated with someone having violated an accepted norm of behavior, "Shame looks to what I am."9 Disdain is the outwardly directed corollary of shame, and esteem is their positive counterpart. Like their action-focused cousins, these attitudes are regarded as appro- priately extended only to members of the moral community. Consider the apparent anthropomorphic inappropriateness (though perhaps humorous- ness) of my responding to my dog's pattern of fearful behavior in the face of large cats with "Have you no shame?!" Though he may cower in response to 69</page><page sequence="6">my raised voice, and perhaps even be said to wish to please me, it seems implausible to think that he is capable of shame in the sense discussed here. Shame as a reactive attitude, along with other such attitudes, require persons as their target because they are generated by an awareness of moral norms and are addressed to one who is assumed to have the ability to grasp and respond to such norms - norms recognized to have at least intersubjective, if not objective, authority. To view someone as an appropriate candidate for the character-focused reactive attitudes is to regard her as having failed, met, or exceeded a norm of how one ought to be morally disposed and so constitutes a form of regarding her as responsible for the state of her character. These norms may govern each of the aspects of a character trait discussed in the previous section. That is, we may hold a person to be responsible for: the motivational content of her character (e.g., the presence or lack of certain desires), the way that content is ordered (i.e., the priority assigned to the sat- isfaction of the relevant desires), the degree of self-control she possesses, and/or the extent of her practical acumen. It is common in discussions of responsibility to focus on the reactive attitudes of resentment, guilt, and indignation - those that express our con- cern with whether a person's action failed to express that minimum degree of good will that we expect from each other as co-members of the moral community. This restriction in focus is often adopted in order to capture the apparent conceptual link between such attitudes and our notion of holding one another responsible in the sense of accountable.10 Clearly, the moral norms governing character traits are broader in scope, for they are concerned not only with dispositions minimally demanded of all members of the moral community but also those which are worthy or unworthy of our aspiration (e.g., integrity) and those which we might legitimately expect given the par- ticular way you and I are related (e.g., being loyal as a friend).11 One reason for maintaining this wider conceptual net is to better capture the multiple interests reflected in moral sentiments like disdain, shame, and esteem - in particular, to highlight the especially important role these moral attitudes play in the closest relationships of our adult lives. Since these sentiments and the character attributions on which they are based concern a person's endur- ing qualities rather than motivations that may be only transitory in nature, they contribute in important ways to our choices about with whom we will work, whom we befriend, and to whom we devote ourselves in love. It is therefore difficult to imagine, as it is as with their action-focused counter- parts, that our present form of interpersonal life could be sustained without them, for in their absence, we would be left to regard traits of character as we do other qualities typically not regarded as subject to normative assess- ment - traits eliciting pity (self or other-directed), wariness, envy, or per- haps congratulations (for one's good fortune) but not disdain, shame, and esteem.12 70</page><page sequence="7">III. THE REACTIVE ATTITUDES AND FAILURES OF ATTRIBUTABILITY Given this understanding of what it is for us to regard someone as morally responsible for a trait of character she possesses, how might we proceed to conditions on being responsible for a character trait? Here again, we may fol- low Strawson's lead, though perhaps with a slightly different aim in mind.13 Working backward from the role the reactive attitudes play in our lives, he noted that the attitudes prompted by another's action may be suspended or mitigated in light of two kinds of considerations. The same, I will show, is true of the character- focused reactive attitudes. Having these two sorts of considerations in mind will help guide our subsequent inquiry into what conditions on being responsible seem to underlie our practice of regarding one another as responsible for traits of character. In the first sort of circumstance Strawson had in mind, the reactive atti- tudes are suspended upon recognition that one was mistaken about the degree of good will manifested in the agent's action. For example, one's resentment may evaporate upon discovering that the person next to you in a crowd was not seeking to push you aside but instead stumbled into you after being pushed, or one's gratitude toward another might dissipate upon real- izing that the benefit one received was an unintended (and perhaps even re- gretted) side-effect of the person's pursuit of another goal. In cases of this sort, the behavior in question remains part of the agent's history of bodily movements, but the particular behavior - as originally conceived - is not attributable to the agent as an instance of her having failed or succeeded in keeping to a moral norm. Thus, the agent is not a fit subject for the particu- lar reactive attitude originally elicited by the behavior. Instead, the agent's behavior is reinterpreted and subsequently excused or the agent now becomes subject to a different attitude.14 There are parallel failures in the attribution of character traits, which likewise, upon recognition impede or alter the character-focused reactive atti- tudes. These failures transpire a number of different ways and often involve a misinterpretation of behavioral cues - sometimes because there are too few of them and/or because they are ambiguous in nature. For example, one may regard an acquaintance with disdain after interpreting her aloof behavior as a manifestation of an arrogant, standoffish disposition only to have one's dis- dain dissipate upon learning later that she is painfully shy and struggles mightily to overcome her disposition to avoid social contact with those she does not know well. Or consider the recent widespread lifting of shame for those suffering from various mild-moderate forms of mental illnesses involv- ing motivational dispositions that have sometimes been conceived as charac- ter flaws - e.g., bipolar and obsessive-compulsive disorders.15 The desires 71</page><page sequence="8">constitutive of the agenťs dispositions in these examples are indisputably part of the agent's psychological history - e.g., the mental history of the painfully shy person does include a pattern of desire to avoid people - and the mani- festations of these dispositional states are sometimes morally significant. However, upon recognizing them for what they are, we conclude that these states are not attributable to the agent as a moral fault. Thus, she is not an appropriate target of disdain or shame for possessing them. In other words, the dispositional traits in cases of this sort, like the excused behaviors cited above, are reinterpreted and then excused or the agent now becomes subject to a different attitude.16 The second sort of consideration which Strawson sought to highlight is illustrated in circumstances where the appropriateness of the full range of reactive attitudes, not simply a particular attitude toward an agent for having performed an action or possessing some dispositional trait, is blocked. In cases of this variety, the reactive attitudes are inhibited or modified upon recognition that the agent is not a full member of the moral community because she lacks some capacity required to be a fully responsible agent. Absent this capacity, neither the agent's actions nor her dispositions to respond in morally relevant ways can be attributed to her in the proper sense, therefore she is exempt from ascriptions of full moral responsibility. Lack of the capacity in question may be due to congenital impairment, immaturity (as in the case of young children), illness, or trauma. The more particular nature of the undermining factor determines whether membership in the moral community is barred only temporarily or permanently. For example, though we typically withhold or express the reactive attitudes in a qualified "training" mode with very young children, we assume that most will eventu- ally develop the capacities requisite for full moral agency and, in turn, that both their morally significant actions and their dispositions to respond in morally significant ways will become attributable to them in the sense required to be properly subject to the full range of the action and character- focused reactive attitudes. We should pause here to highlight the sense of attributability that is absent in the two kinds of circumstances highlighted above. To say that a per- son's action or disposition to respond in morally significant ways is not attributable to her is to say that she is not a fit subject for moral criticism or praise insofar as they do not reflect failure or success on her part to observe the relevant moral norms - i.e., norms of action or character. Thus, to address her via the reactive attitudes with regard to how she behaved or is dis- posed is inappropriate. To regard none of an individual's actions or morally relevant dispositions as properly attributable to her is to judge that she lacks the capacity - either temporarily or permanently - to recognize and/or respond appropriately to moral norms. If failures of attribution undermine the point of moral address, then conversely, attributability opens the way for 72</page><page sequence="9">the agent to be so addressed. That is, for us to regard an action or a trait of character as morally attributable to an agent is for that agent to be "on the hook," so to speak, in the sense that it would not be inappropriate to ask for an explanation of why she saw it as acceptable to act or be so disposed. In response, she can, in turn, either acknowledge the appropriateness of our reaction or attempt to explain why criticism or praise is not fitting.17 This is not to say that one will always be in a position to articulate an answer to such questions should they be asked - only that it would not be inappropriate to be asked. Note that in circumstances of the first sort where attributability is under- mined, a moral agent's action or disposition fails to reflect the exercise of a capacity required for moral attributability of an action or disposition. In the second variety, an individual fails to possess a distinctive capacity that enables her to function as one who is subject to the reactive attitudes for how she acts and is disposed. For our purposes, we need not assume that the relevant capacity is the same for both actions and character traits. It will be enough to observe the need for an account of responsibility for character that addresses both issues. More specifically, as we proceed, our aim is to isolate a human capacity that is morally relevant in these two respects: ( 1 ) attributability of a disposition to respond in morally significant ways is to be understood in rela- tion to the capacity's exercise; and (2) possession of the capacity helps define the boundaries of the moral community - i.e., possession of the capacity makes one a fitting subject of the character- focused reactive attitudes and in its absence, one fails to be a fully responsible agent.18 IV. THE CAPACITY FOR IDENTIFICATION AND MEMBERSHIP IN THE MORAL COMMUNITY By extending Strawson's discussion of excusing and exempting considera- tions we've seen that an agent's disposition to respond to her circumstances in morally significant ways may sometimes not be attributable to her in the sense demanded by our responsibility ascription practices. Since its introduc- tion into philosophical discourse about human agency, the notion of identi- fication has been employed in an effort to distinguish different senses in which an action or a desire may be said to belong, or be attributable, to us. Insofar as we accept that our substantive traits of character are constituted at least in part by the presence of certain desires, the capacity to identify with a desire appears to be a promising candidate for the central notion in an account of responsibility for character. Harry Frankfurt, who deserves much of the credit for raising the philosophical profile of the notion of identifica- tion, once claimed that this was so: 73</page><page sequence="10">The fundamental responsibility of an agent with respect to his own character is not a matter of whether it is as the effect of his own actions that the agent has certain dispositions to feel and to behave in various ways The question of whether the person is responsible for his own character has to do with whether he has taken responsibility for his characteristics. It concerns whether the dispositions at issue, regardless of whether their existence is due to the person's own initiative and causal agency or not, are char- acteristics with which he identifies and which he thus by his own will incorporates into himself as constitutive of what he is.19 Frankfurt's seems to be an account of just the sort sought here, for if he is correct, then the causal origins of our dispositions are irrelevant to our responsibility for them, perhaps enabling one to side-step the worries sketched in the introduction about the lack of voluntariness in the original acquisition of one's character. How then might we be said to take responsi- bility for our dispositions by identifying ourselves with their constitutive desires? As described earlier, the substantive virtues and vices are marked by the presence of a standing structure of motivational elements, some of which (e.g., what one desires, values, or cares about) also may be ordered on the basis of their relative importance to the agent. The elements of this motiva- tional structure are, for the most part, first-order - i.e., their object is some way of action or feeling in relation to a particular set of circumstances. For example, first-order desires, like the desire to alleviate unjustified suffering, are desires to offer aid in circumstances of need. However, on the general model of persons we will now begin to consider, persons possess the capac- ity to evaluate their first-order motivational dispositions and thereby come to adopt a higher-order motivational stance toward them.20 This reflective capacity may be exercised in one of two ways, corresponding to the two aspects of the substantive component of virtues and vices outlined earlier. First, one may adopt a higher-order attitude toward the content of one's character - e.g., what desires one possesses or wishes to be moved by. Second, one may adopt a higher-order attitude toward the way that content is prior- itized - e.g., the relative importance of satisfying one desire compared to that of another.21 Identifications of this sort are higher-order because their object is a first-order motivational element - e.g., a desire to act some particular way - rather than the course of action itself. In virtue of the capacity to form such higher-order attitudes, one may come to identify oneself with some first-order motivation or ranking of them as that which one wants to be effective in guiding one's behavior. Through such identification, one's desires may become more than mere happenings in one's psychological history, for one thereby takes ownership of them - makes them more genuinely one's own - and in withholding one's identification from or in dis-identifying one- 74</page><page sequence="11">self with other first-order motivations in the stream of one s psychic history, one may disassociate oneself from them. Even given the preliminary nature of this sketch of identification, one can see how such an account might be employed to treat the failures of attri- bution discussed in the previous section. For example, the very shy person or the sufferer of obsessive- compulsive disorder does not identify herself with the first-order motivations constitutive of these dispositions, so they fail to be attributable to the agent in the appropriate sense. Further, we may suppose that young children and incapacitated agents lack the capacity to identify themselves with their first-order motivations in the appropriate manner and so fail to be full members of the moral community. However, how best to understand the nature of the higher-order attitude, or stance, involved in identification is controversial. My approach in gaining some clarity about this will be to first isolate that capacity for identification that seems to define full membership in the moral community, for it seems plausible that exercise of this capacity will be sufficient - if not also necessary - for the attributability of a particular trait. (If its exercise is not necessary for the attributability of a trait, then we might at least expect that what is necessary will somehow be defined in relation to it.) To isolate the capacity of identification that seems distinctive of members of the moral community, I will sketch a developmen- tal story of becoming a morally responsible agent so that its emergence is more easily recognizable. Though it is admittedly crude, let us imagine a two-stage process of development for morally responsible agents. In the initial stage, a first-order structure of motivation is instilled in young children on the platform of their inborn traits of temperament via largely, if not wholly, nonrational means of training. By "nonrational," I do not mean to suggest that the child's practical reasoning powers are wholly disengaged but that the considerations weighed in that reasoning are independent of those considerations that we regard as making that way of acting right/wrong or way of being disposed good/bad (thus the term "habituation"). The earliest modes of childhood training cen- ter largely on a system of tangible rewards and punishments grounded in the child's self-interest, and are eventually supplemented with expressions of approval or disapproval that begin to tap into the child's growing desire to please her parents and teachers. As the child continues to grow, genuinely ethical considerations increasingly may be voiced in the training process, but there is little reason to think that these have much purchase on the young child during this first stage.22 By the end of this first stage of development as morally responsible agents, children already have begun to develop relatively stable dispositions to respond to their circumstances in morally significant ways. For example, a still quite young child may be strongly disposed to either tell the truth or lie when it is 75</page><page sequence="12">advantageous to do so. Facsimiles of the reactive attitudes may be extended to and experienced by the child during this first stage, yet we do not regard their actions and dispositions to behave in morally relevant ways as attributable to them in the full moral sense. We may be angry with how a young child during this stage behaves in relation to us, and we may be troubled if it is a manifes- tation of a disposition to so behave, yet we typically - in our clear-headed moments - do not resent the behavior or regard the child with disdain. And though a child may be begin to feel shame or self-esteem for how he is dis- posed, these fall short of their genuine reactive attitude counterparts insofar as they are generated typically not by an appreciation of the relevant moral norm but more likely the significance placed on pleasing his parent or teacher. If we take the capacity to engage in higher-order identification as evi- denced by the ability to reflect on competing wants and then resolve that conflict through reflection on which desire one wants to be one's will, then it is plausibly an ability that has already developed in children at some point during this first stage.23 The capacity for second-order reflection, in part, helps distinguish more complex agency from mere intentional behavior. Older infants and young toddlers, like no doubt many other animals, engage in intentional behavior aimed at gratifying their most pressing first-order desire. It is not long, however, before a child begins to play a more active role in the resolution of his motivational conflict by learning how to prioritize his ends and, correspondingly, the satisfaction of his desires. Consider, for exam- ple, a somewhat older child in the first stage of development as a morally responsible agent who has been told that if he eats his dinner he may go out to play; but if he does not eat his dinner, he must remain at the table. We may imagine that the child is torn between two competing first-order desires: an aversion to eating his dinner and his desire to go out to play. His parents have given him a reason to eat his dinner despite his aversion to doing so. N. J. H. Dent nicely describes the situation of the child who possesses the capacity to override his aversion to eating his dinner in light of the reason supplied by his parents. The child is now able to give his desires a preferential weighting or importance, to assign one priority over another, in however unsystematic, unsteady, and uncomprehensive a way. He is in effect judging that his aversion to eating his dinner is less impor- tant to him, for now at any rate, than his liking for playing; were it more, he would refuse, and forego the chance of play. It is not that being so totally taken up in the latter purpose he swallows anything necessary to getting it, though that can happen. Rather, he asks himself what it matters to have to eat one's dinner in rela- tion to what it matters to him to play, and concludes, for this occasion if for no other, that it matters not so much - The child is taken out of the life of mere successive impulses which move him to this or that and begins to determine for himself what he shall best do or forsake, and deliberately to seek to realise that.24 76</page><page sequence="13">As the example illustrates, the ability to weigh the reasons one has for com- peting courses of action generates the exercise of a second-order capacity to assess the relative importance of satisfying one desire versus another - the capacity to reflectively determine what it is that one really or most wants.25 These preliminary observations concerning the early moral development of morally responsible agents are significant, for they already provide us with a reason to reject several competing conceptions of identification as charac- terizations of that distinctive capacity of those who are fitting subjects of the character- focused reactive attitudes. The first of these is Frankfurt's original model of identification. According to that model, one identifies oneself with a particular first-order motivation and thereby makes it genuinely one's own, when one forms a second-order volition endorsing it - i.e., a desire that the first-order desire in question be effective in moving one to action.26 But as we've seen, it seems plausible to assume that even very young children in the first stage of their development as morally responsible agents are capable of such higher-order reflection and endorsement yet fail to be viewed as agents whose dispositional states are morally attributable to them. In recent years, Michael Bratman (pursuing a suggestion by Frankfurt which Frankfurt himself has since abandoned) has argued that identification consists in formulating higher-order self-governing policies, understood as decisions to treat certain lower-order desires as reason-giving in one's prac- tical deliberation.27 As Bratman correctly points out, such self-governing policies help constitute the agent's cross-temporal identity. The capacity to form such higher-order policies and thereby project a cross-temporal self is surely an important advance in our development as agents, but again it is arguably a capacity acquired quite early during the first stage of our develop- ment as morally responsible agents - e.g., as evidenced by a young child's decision to prioritize his aversion to punishment as reason-giving in relation to his desire to hide some failure to obey his parents. Thus, identification, understood as the higher-order capacity to decide to treat certain lower-level desires as reason-giving, also fails to be the explanatory notion we are seek- ing to help define the boundaries of the moral community. Finally, David Shoemaker has recently argued that identification should be understood as the exercise of our capacity to care, where caring is under- stood as being emotionally invested in the object of care. That is, to care in this sense is to be susceptible to contentment or joy when the object of care is maintained or flourishes and disappointment if it is diminished or harmed.28 Higher-order identification as caring is exercised when one cares in this sense about one's motivational makeup. Again, though this is an important aspect of our agency, it seems plausible to think that even young children in the first stage of development as morally responsible agents are capable of caring not only at the first-order level, but also at the second. For example, they come to care about being disposed in a fashion pleasing to their parents and teachers. 77</page><page sequence="14">So, it seems too that understanding identification as higher-order caring is not the explanatorily fruitful notion we are presently seeking. Each of the foregoing accounts of identification highlight an important aspect of our sta- tus as human agents, but if identification is to serve as an explanatorily use- ful notion in defining membership in the moral community, it will need to be understood in a more robust fashion than thus far described. If the first stage of our development as morally responsible agents is best characterized as aiming to instill - via largely nonrational means - behavior and dispositions with the proper moral trajectory, the second stage is devoted to capitalizing on the child's increasing cognitive and emotional ability to entertain genuinely ethical considerations for acting and being so disposed.29 In other words, here concerted effort is made to transmit certain values in such a way that the child comes to adopt them for herself. The evaluative vocabulary introduced in the first stage is now increasingly linked with those considerations thought to undergird the moral status of the act or disposi- tion. These considerations then begin to be internalized and deployed in the child's own practical reasoning to determine what is right, good, or at least morally acceptable. If this process of internalization is successful, she no longer behaves in the desired manner simply to avoid sanctions or to please her parents and teachers but because (or in addition because) she judges that the behavior is right or disposition good in relation to her own conception of a life well lived. In short, in this stage the child begins to form a concep- tion of the good.30 The conception of the good under construction during this second stage may also begin to inform the child's second-order reflections. That is, now, the young agent may begin to reflect not simply on what she most wants, what she will decide to treat as a reason, or what she cares about, but also what she ought to want, ought to decide to treat as a reason, or ought to care about. In other words, her higher-order stance toward her lower-level desires may now be informed by her judgments of value. The first stage of one's development as a morally responsible agent provides much of the raw mate- rial for such second-order reflection. However, insofar as the agent's rudi- mentary dispositions become the target of second-order reflection informed by the agent's developing conception of the good, they may begin to become something more. What may once have been a disposition to tell the truth for fear of punishment now may increasingly become a disposition to tell the truth because it manifests the virtue of being trustworthy (or shows due respect, or tends to promote less suffering, etc.). This process of rational transformation, if it takes place, is the process of a disposition's transformation from a mere disposition to behave in a morally significant way to a genuine character trait. Though many of the disposition's behavioral manifestations may remain the same, the agent is now invested in the trait in a new way - it is now attributable her in a sense that opens her to 78</page><page sequence="15">being addressed via the character-focused reactive attitudes and positions her to respond by either acknowledging the appropriateness of the attitude or by explaining its inappropriateness. That such a transformation does take place is evidenced by the growing child's increasing willingness to both adopt the reactive attitudes toward herself and extend them to others when the relevant norm of character comes into play. Though a very young agent during the previous stage might feel ashamed for having disappointed her parents or teachers, the maturing agent in the second stage may begin to feel ashamed, not only for having let others down, but also for not having lived up to a standard of character that she herself has now adopted. The latter sort of shame is possible only if the individual has begun to develop a conception of the good, and the desire in question is viewed as having violated a standard entailed by that conception.31 Thus it appears that the capacity relevant to defining the community of those subject to the character- focused reactive attitudes is a higher-order capacity to identify oneself with certain first-order motivations, where that identification is informed by ones judgments of value. Exactly what kind of higher-order attitude is informed by one's judgment in such identification? Here I think we can be accommodating and say that it is likely different on different occasions. That is, may it not be the case that we sometimes identify ourselves with a lower-order desire simply via an endorsing higher-order desire informed by one's judgment, at other times via a judgment-informed self-governing policy to treat a certain lower-order desire as reason -giving, and at other times through a higher-order caring informed by one's judg- ment? In each case what lends authority to the higher-order attitude whichever it may be - i.e., what expresses our distinctive activity as moral agents - is the exercise of our evaluative judgment, for it is through such judgment that we express where we stand, ethically speaking.32 V. OBJECTION: EVALUATION-BASED ACCOUNTS OF IDENTIFICATION ARE IMPLAUSIBLY RATIONALISTIC The most popular objection to accounts of identification emphasizing the centrality of evaluative judgments is that they are overly rationalistic. This charge may grow out of several distinct concerns. Here I will address one of these, and in the next section I will address another. One might worry that grounding our responsibility for character in a capacity for evaluation- informed identification sets the bar too high in the sense that it asks for an implausible degree of rational reflection on one's motives during the devel- opment of one's character. An adequate response to this worry requires first that a distinction be drawn between two levels of critical reflection, and 79</page><page sequence="16">second, a bit more discussion of how such a capacity might plausibly be exer- cised in the course of one's development. To make value judgments concerning the content of one's character is to exercise a capacity for critical reflection. However, in associating the notion of identification with a capacity for critical reflection one must carefully dis- tinguish the sort of critical capacity which grounds one's moral responsibil- ity from that associated with the achievement of increasing degrees of autonomy. Put briefly, the distinction is between the capacity to judge alter- natives in relation to a conception of the good and the capacity to subject one's conception of the good to critical scrutiny. The contrast between the above two capacities is perhaps best isolated by imagining an individual who has not exercised the more robust capacity and very well may not possess it to any meaningful degree. For example, imagine someone who is raised in a community whose members do not dif- fer greatly in their conception of the good, having accepted it as part of a larger unquestioned cultural tradition passed down without great modifica- tion over the years. This individual might be described, from our perspective in a pluralistic society, as a "slave to convention." Such a person makes judg- ments reflecting the capacity to judge alternatives in relation to his concep- tion of the good (at both the first and second order) and so functions as an agent who has internalized his community's values. For example, he may make judgments of the kind: "It is cruel to take pleasure, or find amusing, the misfortune of others" or "It is good to be the sort of person who is feared." Yet he has not and may be unable to "stand back" to any significant practical degree - to suspend commitment to his conception of the good - and reflect critically upon it.33 A failure to clearly distinguish the capacity to make judgments grounded in a conception of good versus the capacity to call that conception itself into question is likely to result in an account of taking responsibility for charac- ter whose conditions are too stringent. This failure sometimes seems to plague Charles Taylor's proposal that a person's responsibility for her self is grounded in her capacity for critical reflection. Taylor distinguishes between strong evaluations and radical réévaluations. Strong evaluations are value judgments similar to those I have proposed as central to our moral responsi- bility for character, but Taylor sometimes seems to go further and suggest that it is our more robust capacity for radical réévaluation that is the basis of our responsibility. The question can always be posed: ought I to re-evaluate my most basic evaluations? . . . Have I truly determined what I sense to be the highest mode of life? This kind of re-evaluation will be radi- cal .. . in the sense that our looking again can be so undertaken that in principle no formulations are considered unrevisable.34 80</page><page sequence="17">According to Taylor, it is this capacity for radical self-scrutiny and the capac- ity for subsequent self-revisions that grounds one's responsibility for one's self. We are responsible for our selves when we engage in such radical rééval- uation, and also when we don't insofar as it was within our power to do so.35 That one ought to develop and exercise the capacity to subject one's received views concerning what is right and good to this sort of scrutiny is undoubtedly one of the fundamental principles we have inherited as heirs of the Enlightenment. Moreover, it seems undeniable that when one does so, one makes one's desires and values in some sense more truly one's own. However, if being morally responsible for one's character dispositions required that one make them one's own in this sense, only very reflective persons could be morally responsible for their character traits. This seems more than our responsibility practices demand, for we seem to assume that mature moral agents are, in general, appropriate targets of the character-focused reactive attitudes, whether or not they seem to possess in any meaningful sense the more robust capacity for critical reflection. The goal of the more robust sort of critical reflection is a form of ideal self-governance. Insofar as it is true that by engaging in such reflection one makes one's desires and values more truly one's own, then it can also be said that one takes responsibility for one's self or character in an even deeper sense. In other words, the sort of responsibility one might acquire for oneself by engaging in such reflection is over and above that which grounds the attributability of one's traits and thereby the appropriateness of the charac- ter-focused reactive attitudes. It is, instead, a notion of responsibility to be associated with becoming increasingly autonomous in relation to one's actions and motivations.36 The critical capacity relevant for moral responsibility is, as I have argued, the more modest capacity to make judgments in relation to one's conception of a life well lived. It is a capacity shared by most human adults,37 and through the exercise of this capacity at the second-order level individuals may iden- tify themselves with those motivations and thereby take responsibility for them. Taking responsibility in this way is obviously compatible with very restrictive forms of acculturation - i.e., forms which do not tolerate great variation and do not encourage critical scrutiny of one's evaluative judg- ments themselves - yet we need not conclude from this that such evaluations do not genuinely express an individual's moral agency.38 However, even if one grants that the capacity for second-order identifi- cation informed by one's value judgments is a natural outgrowth of our development as morally responsible agents, one might contend that it is implausible to think that maturing agents engage in much second-order reflection about their character dispositions in the manner suggested. This concern can be met, I believe, by recognizing that second-order identification 81</page><page sequence="18">with a character disposition may be accomplished indirectly through a pat- tern of first-order evaluations. Identifying with a disposition in this indirect manner would be minimally reflective in the sense that it would require lit- tle in the way of conscious second-order reflection on the value of the lower- order desires in question. The first and primary task of one's capacity for practical judgment is to evaluate courses of action. However, one may - especially in cases involving conflicting motivations - form a second-order desire that the desire to per- form the action in question be effective on the basis of one's first-order eval- uation. In other words, one may come to identify with a particular first-order motivation on the basis of one's initial evaluation of a particular course of action.39 Suppose, for example, that one experiences conflicting desires on a particular occasion about whether one ought to tell the truth. One's practi- cal judgment is engaged in determining what it is that one ought to do in this case. But upon concluding, say, that one ought to tell the truth, one may form a second-order preference that one's desire to tell the truth be the one that directs one's action. With this observation in hand, we are now in a position to understand how one might indirectly, and with minimal reflection, identify with a char- acter disposition during the second stage of development sketched above. We may suppose that as an agent's moral development proceeds, he first exercises his capacity for evaluative judgment in relation to particular actions and that in conjunction with evaluations of this kind, he then forms second-order volitions informed by those evaluations. Over time, the agent's first-order evaluations begin to exhibit a pattern as he begins to extend his judgment that some particular action is kind, selfish, cruel, or thoughtful, to similar actions in like circumstances. Via such a process, he comes to understand that those individual actions under his immediate consideration are tokens of actions of a certain type. So, for example, he learns not only that refusing to share is wrong but also that refusing to share is to be rejected as a member of the broader species of selfish behavior. In grouping individual actions under their moral type, an agent gener- alizes his evaluation of a course of action. My suggestion is that this general- ization may be accompanied by a generalization from his identification with a particular motive to identification with a character disposition manifesting behavior of the kind in question. For example, one may, on the basis of a pat- tern of identification with a desire for other-regarding behavior on particu- lar occasions, come to identify with a disposition to be other- regarding. In this way, one comes to judge it good to be disposed in a particular way on the basis of a prior pattern of judgment concerning how one ought to act in par- ticular cases. Forms of moral education will vary in the degree to which they encourage the agent to consciously reflect on this process, but it seems that 82</page><page sequence="19">the process itself does not require an undue level of conscious reflection. Just as generalizing from the evaluation of actions on particular occasions to the evaluation of types of behavior may be implicit, so may be the process of coming to identify with a character disposition on the basis of ones having formerly engaged in a pattern of identification with particular desires. One final objection to be considered here is that it may seem that while appeal to evaluation- informed identification can easily handle the attribut- ability of virtues, it is difficult to see how such a view can account for the attributability of vices, for on the face of it, it seems unlikely that most indi- viduals with the vice of being, say cruel, have endorsed, at the second-order level, a disposition under the description "being cruel," or more generally, that persons judge their vices good. (Though it is a sad fact that some seem to have done so.) However, this is not what the present account need suggest. Instead, what is suggested is that an individual may have evaluated the dispo- sition positively under some description - it need not be what we would regard as an entirely accurate description.40 We can imagine, for example, a cruel and insensitive manager who does not think of himself in that way at all. On the contrary, he regards himself as an accomplished leader who knows what it takes to "get the job done." He may view the relevant dispositions as contributing factors to his success as a manager, reasoning as follows: "Being the sort of person who is feared is good, because this leads to respect"; "Being unmoved by the plight of others is good, because it demonstrates your inde- pendence." In this case, it seems that he has, in effect, identified with his cru- elty and insensitivity by judging it a good thing to be the way he is. Thus, the mere fact that one does not think of one's vices as such does not preclude one from having identified with those traits in the relevant sense. VI. IDENTIFICATION AND THE ATTRIBUTABILITY OF PARTICULAR TRAITS In the preceding two sections, I have defended an account of identification the capacity for which I take to be central to defining the boundaries of the moral community, understood here as those subject to the character- focused reactive attitudes. However, for the exercise of this capacity to be sufficient for the attributability of a particular trait, it will be necessary to add a further constraint - namely, that the agent be satisfied with the chain of identifica- tion. In other words, there must be an absence of conflict over the content of the agenťs higher-order will and the evaluative stance informing it. This does not mean that there must be a complete absence of contrary motivational impulses and no lingering questions about one's evaluative stance, only that - at least at this moment in the agenťs history - the agent is not inclined 83</page><page sequence="20">to revisit the question of what her higher-order will ought to be. If the agent is genuinely conflicted at the level of her higher-order will or in her evalua- tive judgment, then no identification with one rather than another of her lower-order motivations can be accomplished.41 Frankfurt first introduced the notion of satisfaction in an attempt to ground the authority of one's higher-order identifications, but since the mere negative constraint of an absence of conflict can result from causes (e.g., exhaustion/depression or in more hypothetical scenarios, brain manip- ulation) that fail to confer agential authority,42 it is important to further specify how one's satisfaction need arise. Here, the relevant type of satisfac- tion arises in response to one's interaction with the ethically salient features of one's circumstances and so reflects the fact that the evaluative judgment informing one's higher-order attitude is - as best one can tell given the lim- itations on one's deliberation at that time - tracking the good as one sees it. It is the culmination of a process, perhaps never completed definitively and in its entirety, of figuring out what the ethical contours and limits of one's life will be. Recognizing one's identifications to be the result of such a process may help allay another worry about the present model. One might worry that while the account secures the attributability of a character trait, it does so only by reference to an evaluative judgment that may fail to be properly attributable to the agent. However, recall that - as our responsibility ascrip- tion practices suggest - an action or trait is morally attributable to an agent when she is positioned to respond to possible queries about its appropriate- ness in relation to some moral norm. To reach an evaluative judgment with which one is satisfied because it represents one's best attempt to define where one stands in relation to the ethically salient features of one's circumstances just is to be so positioned as a moral interlocutor. Identifying with the lower-order desires constitutive of a character dis- position via an evaluation-informed higher-order attitude with which one is satisfied would seem to be sufficient for the moral attribution of a character trait. Such identification positions one as a moral interlocutor should a demand for an explanation be forthcoming from a fellow member of the moral community (though again, we need not suppose a great degree of articulateness from all members about that with which they have identified themselves). Interestingly, however, identifying oneself so with one's disposi- tions does not seem necessary for proper attributability. First, we might note that it does not seem necessary that one presently so identify oneself - under any description - with a dispositional trait in order that the trait be properly attributable to oneself. One may lament and thus presently fail to identify with the content of one's character, yet the disdain of others may be fitting. One may even acknowledge the fittingness of such disdain (though it is not 84</page><page sequence="21">necessary that one do so). Let us imagine such an agent. Why might he acknowledge the fittingness of such disdain even though he does not presently identify himself with the disposition he is criticized for possessing? There are at least two versions of such a scenario. According to the first, we might suppose that though the agent now fails to identify with the trait, he recognizes that he did so identify himself with it earlier in the course of its development. He thus is now simply acknowledging the pivotal role he played earlier in becoming who he is through the exercise of his capacity for identification. Moreover, he recognizes the fact that since one neither acquires nor rids oneself of an established character disposition by fiat that it may be some time yet before he brings about the change in character he now desires. On the second scenario, however, our agent may not be acknowledging that he previously identified himself with the trait but rather that he failed to identify himself with it's contrary virtue. Here, the agent is acknowledging his blameworthiness on the basis of his having been negligent in some respect. For example, one may feel ashamed at recognizing a degree of callousness in oneself to the suffering of others - i.e., a failure to notice the suffering of cer- tain others and to experience the corresponding appropriate fellow-feeling - but not because ones callousness was intentionally endorsed (as it seems for some who are quick to attribute the suffering of others to some fault of their own and thus see it as deserved). One may feel rather in such circumstances that one has failed to attend to considerations to which one ought to have attended and that had one attended to them, one would have identified one- self with the appropriate virtue. In the second of these two scenarios, it seems that a trait might be properly attributed to an agent even though he does not and has not previously identified himself with it. Yet, as we ve seen, the agent's responsibility is still understood in relation to his capacity for evaluation-informed identification, for he is negligent for not having exer- cised it in the proper direction. In such cases, then, where an agent is negli- &gt; gent, we might say that he assumes rather than takes responsibility for his character trait to mark the sense in which his failure is one of omission rather than commission. There is a third kind of case that one might think calls into question whether an evaluation-based form of identification is the proper basis upon which to ground an account of responsibility for character. I have in mind here extrapolations from what Gary Watson has called "perverse" cases of free agency. In "Free Action and Free Will" Watson retreats from an earlier view of free agency that, like the account of responsibility for character defended here, emphasized the exercise of one's capacity for evaluative judgment.43 According to Watson's earlier view, freely performing a particular action requires that one act in accordance with one's judgments of value. Watson felt compelled to abandon this view in the face of cases where it seems that one 85</page><page sequence="22">identifies with, or fully embraces, a course of action, even though one has not judged it best. For example, suppose that an agent opts to join a friend who has hard-to-obtain tickets to a concert by her favorite artist, despite the fact that she judges that it would be best for her instead to aid an elderly neigh- bor who had requested some help with some tasks at the neighbor's house. Though she never relinquishes her judgment of what would be best, she does not regret or second-guess her choice, thus it is not a typical case of weakness of will. In cases such as these, the agent acts freely, yet it does not appear to be the case that she judges it best to act as she does. Watson concludes from cases like this that his earlier account of free agency was too rationalistic inso- far as it required that the agent act in accordance with her judgment concern- ing what is best. On Watson's view, the sort of evaluation relevant to free action is of the first order (the object of evaluation is a course of action), yet such cases could be re-described in an attempt to question the sense in which the attributabil- ity of a trait depends upon the exercise of an agenťs capacity for evaluative judgment. For example, now imagine not simply that our agent ignores the needs of her neighbor on one occasion but that she is, in general, a person who is not troubled by the needs of others except for those in her inner circle. This is not because she judges the needs of others to be unimportant, nor is it the case that she is negligently oblivious to those needs to which she ought to attend. After failing to be moved by reports of a community suffering greatly in the aftermath of a natural disaster, she is confronted by a friend about her apparent callousness. She replies, "I know I should be more com- passionate, but I just don't care." Here, again, it would seem that the disposi- tion in question is attributable to the agent in such a way as to be subject to the character- focused reactive attitudes, yet, if we take her response straight- forwardly, her evaluative judgment is divorced from that with which she seems to have genuinely identified herself. We must be careful in this case to be clear about what the agent is attempting to convey in her reply to her friend's criticism. For example, her reply might be paraphrased as: "I know that the demands of morality say that I should be more compassionate, but living up to the demands of morality is not the only thing that is important to me." Here the agent acknowledges the demands of morality, but relativizes their importance in relation to other ends she has adopted. In acknowledging but setting those demands to the side, she does, in fact, seem to be making appeal to a more general framework or conception of what sort of life it is at least acceptable, if not best, to live. We need not insist that the evaluations informing one's identifications be strictly moral evaluations, especially if "moral" is interpreted in the common but narrow sense of those rules that spell out what we minimally owe one another as co-members of the moral community. Thus, if we allow the con- 86</page><page sequence="23">ception of the good employed in identification to be broad in scope, one way of understanding the present example is that the agent is invoking such a conception. If so, then the case is not a counterexample to the account of responsibility for character defended here, for she has identified with her dis- position in the sense required and thereby can be said to have taken respon- sibility for it. But now suppose that we interpret the agent's reply in such a way that she accepts the demand for the relevant degree of compassion as overriding and so understand her to be saying, "I know that I should be more compas- sionate even from my own broadest standpoint of practical reason, but I do not care about the fact that I am disposed in a way that fails to correspond to that standpoint." In response, it is not difficult to imagine that her friend might say, "Well, you should care!" Here, what seems significant is that the locus of responsibility assessment has shifted, for now the agent's perceived lack of a due level of compassion is understood to derive from a fault of another kind - a failure to be concerned about the lack of integration between her evaluative judgment and her state of character.44 Again, the pres- ent case is to be distinguished from that of the dispositional akratic who regrets her persistent failure to bring about such integration. The akratic's regret derives from her commitment to the importance of bringing her actions and character into conformity with her conception of the good. The agent's lack of regret in the present case signals her lack of commitment to this - i.e., at least regarding the extent of her compassion toward those out- side her inner circle. So here the way seems open again to understand her friend's rebuke to be grounded in the perception of a kind of negligence, though a kind different from that identified above. That is, here she is not negligent for having failed to identify with the disposition to be more com- passionate but for having failed to identify with a "meta-disposition" to value the integration of one's evaluative judgment and character, and her failure to be more compassionate is perceived to derive from this more fundamental failure. Therefore, although the state of her character is not attributable to her on the basis of that with which she has identified herself, it is attributable to her failure to exercise properly her capacity for evaluation-informed identi- fication. VII. CONCLUSION In the foregoing, I have sought to develop an account of responsibility for character that is grounded in our capacity to identify with first-order desires to act and feel a particular way by means of a higher-order attitude informed by judgments expressing our conception of the good. When we exercise this 87</page><page sequence="24">capacity during the formation of a character trait through a pattern of vol- untary choices, we may take responsibility for the corresponding trait, and when we sometimes fail to exercise it in the proper direction, we may be said to assume responsibility for the ensuing character fault. Some may be surprised to have not encountered here any discussion of an issue parallel to that which structures much of the literature on responsi- bility for action - namely, whether responsibility for character requires that one could have been otherwise, i.e., could have come to have a character other than the character one, in fact, possesses. Interest in such a condition on responsibility seems to derive from a concern that we not hold someone accountable unjustly or unfairly.45 That an action or trait of character be prop- erly attributable to an agent is surely a precondition of one's being accountable for it, and I've attempted to make clear how much of our responsibility ascrip- tion practices seem to hinge on the question of responsibility understood as proper attributability. The account of responsibility for character provided here is meant to address that question and does not appear to demand that the agent could have been otherwise. But is attributability sufficient for accountability? There is some reason to think that it is not. For example, many seem to think that an agent's responsibility for his actions or character is mitigated if it comes to light that his vicious character was originally formed in a physically and emotionally abusive environment. Typically, in such cases, there is no serious question of attributability; the vicious motives that constitute the agent's character are his own. What then gives us pause? Given the already lengthy nature of this essay, I must - in the most unsatis- fying manner - set this topic aside for another time.46 An account of the sort proposed here provides a means of understand- ing the significance Aristotle placed on voluntary actions in the development of one's character, for on my account it is through the exercise of one's vol- untary agency that one comes to identify oneself with those desires that are consistent with one's conception of the good. As Sarah Broadie writes, com- menting on Aristotle's account of voluntariness: In voluntary action we pursue an objective which is before us and which figures as a good to us so far as we pursue it; but on another level we enact by our action, and thereby propound into public space, a conception of the kind of practical being that it is good (or at least all right) to be: a kind typified by pursuit of this kind of goal in this sort of way under such conditions. So the action expresses what may be called a vision of the human good.47 If the developmental story sketched above is at least roughly correct, then it suggests a need to qualify Frankfurt's remarks about the irrelevance of our causal role in the formation of our character. While it remains true on the present account that responsibility for one's character does not require 88</page><page sequence="25">that one voluntarily acquire the lower-order desires that constitute the moti- vational content of one's original character, it has been argued that is through the exercise of one's practical reason in deliberative voluntary action that one may come to identify with those desires and in so identifying, transform the dispositions of which they are a part into genuine traits of character. Thus, one's original character, while not voluntarily chosen in an important sense, may nevertheless become one's character through one's voluntary choices. NOTES This paper has evolved over a long period of time. It and its ancestors have profited from the comments of a great many thoughtful readers, including John Martin Fischer, Paul Hoffman, Gary Watson, Andrews Reath, Charles Young, Chris Blakey, Michael McKenna, Kevin Magill, Gideon Yaffe, Steve Jauss, Daryl Rice, Hugh Marlowe, Jan Thomas, Dan Speak, and Micah Hester. 1. For a version of this strategy, see Galen Strawson, Freedom and Belief { New York: Oxford University Press, 1986), 28-29. Note how this reverses the tracing principle involved in an account often (though I think erroneously) attributed to Aristotle, according to which one is responsible for one's character because one is responsible for the individual actions that causally brought about its existence. 2. This is the only sense in which I am committed to the so-called "unity of the virtues." 3. The distinction made here between the substantive and managerial traits is based on Robert C. Roberts's distinction between two types of virtues in "Will Power and the Virtues," Philosophical Review 93 (April 1984): 227-47. 4. This is the reason why I've resisted the Aristotelian label, 'practical wisdom', or lphronesis' for this trait. According to the Aristotelian tradition, practical wisdom entails a genuine grasp of the highest human good, eudetnoniay and so comes normatively loaded. Never- theless, it is worth noting that there is a dependency relation exhibited in traits of practi- cal acumen not present in the case of managerial virtues and vices, for what one perceives as relevant and how one reasons about competing ends will depend upon the motivational substance of one's character. 5. Recently, some have argued that there is empirical evidence from social psychology that demonstrates the nonexistence of substantive character traits. See, for example, Gilbert Harman, "Moral Philosophy Meets Social Psychology: Virtue Ethics and the Fundamental Attribution Error," Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society 99 (1999): 315-31, and John Doris, Lack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002). While both reject the existence of so-called global traits - traits exhibiting a high degree of consistency across different kinds of situations - Doris allows for "local" traits indexed to particular kinds of situations, which, if not too narrowly conceived, might be compatible with the argument of this paper. Space does not permit an adequate discus- sion of this material, but others have diagnosed the serious limitations of both the social science data being drawn upon and the philosophical use to which it has been put. For critical discussion of this issue, see Owen Flanagan, Varieties of Moral Personality (Cam- bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1991), chs. 13-14; Nafsika Athanassoulis, "A Response to Harman: Virtue Ethics and Character Traits," Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society 100 (2000): 215-21; Gopal Sreenivasan, "Errors about Errors: Virtue Theory and Trait Attribution," Mind 111 (2002): 47-67; Rachana Kamtekar, "Situationism and Virtue 89</page><page sequence="26">Ethics on the Content of Our Character," Ethics 1 14 (2004): 458-91; and J.

(New York: Oxford University Press, 2003), 75-77. Actually, Strawson himself says that they are reactions to the good will expressed in a person's "actions and attitudes " (my emphasis), suggesting that he would be open to the way in which I expand his treatment below. 7. Jonathan Bennett, "Accountability," in Philosophical Subjects: Essays iti Honor of P. E Strawson , ed. Zak van Straaten (New York: Oxford University Press, 1979), 37; and R. Jay Wallace, Responsibility and the Moral Sentiments (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1990), 56-58. 8. Here, "shame" is intended in a broad sense so as to include even mild self-reproach for one's character not being what one believes it ought to be. Also, self-directed esteem should not be confused with the more popular and diffuse concept of "self-esteem" under- stood as simply feeling good about oneself. Here, "self-directed esteem," like its other- directed counterpart, is intended to denote not merely positive regard but that credit in some sense is due to the target of esteem as well. 9. Bernard Williams, Shame and Necessity (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1993), 93. It is true that one might say, "I am ashamed of what I have done," but I take it that this is often best paraphrased as, "I am ashamed of being the sort of person who would do such a thing." It's also true that shame is not experienced solely in relation to qualities subject to moral assessment - e.g., one can be ashamed of one's appearance. However, it is, I think, significant that our culture's stance toward shame seems to have evolved in the direction of judging shame irrational when experienced in relation to a quality that is in no way connected to the exercise of one's judgment and will. 10. This is because these negative attitudes, when expressed or when accompanied by other responses, can function as sanctions. See, for example, R. J. Wallace, Responsibility and the Moral Sentiments , 36-37; and T. M. Scanlon, What We Owe Each Other (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1998), 270-71. Gary Watson seems to have a similar restriction of scope in mind when he discusses the accountability aspect of responsibility in "Two Faces of Responsibility," in Agency and Answerability: Selected Essays (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 277-79. Though my focus in this paper will be on the con- ditions under which a character trait is properly attributable, I highlight the issue of accountability again in the conclusion. 11. The focus of Strawson's discussion was not nearly as narrow as that of many of those wishing to build upon it. Though primarily interested in action-focused reactive attitudes, he included such relationship-indexed attitudes as hurt feelings and love. As he states, his concern is "with what it is like to be involved in ordinary interpersonal relationships, rang- ing from the most intimate to the most casual" (77). 12. It is not uncommon of late to encounter arguments alleging that shame is destructive and, as a consequence, that it would be best for us to purge it from our lives (e.g., Doris, Lack of Character 157-60). In its strongest forms, shame's potential for destructiveness when unmeasured and ill-targeted needs to be acknowledged, but such forms can be discour- aged without trying to rid ourselves of shame in all its forms. Also, shame serves the important function - unlike guilt - of directing our attention to the more long-term proj- ect of reshaping our motivational structure, enhancing our self-control, and sharpening our practical acumen (see, e.g., Allan Gibbard, Wise Choices and Apt Feelings [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1990], 298). 13. Strawson's primary aim was to position himself to address the question of whether or not the truth of determinism would undermine the responsibility of all agents in one of the two senses described below, a question I will not seek to address here. 14. "Freedom and Resentment," 77-78. The "different attitude" may be another reactive atti- tude if one concludes that the behavior does indeed express the agent's regard for another (though not the level of regard one initially perceived), or it may be a nonreactive atti- tude - e.g., sympathy - if we conclude that the behavior is not properly assessed in rela- tion to moral norms. 90</page><page sequence="27">15. Strawson notes the way action- focused reactive attitudes may be inhibited upon recogni- tion that the behavior stems from mental illness, but his remarks fail to take into account the full significance of the great range and variation in forms of such illnesses. That is, his discussion seems to suggest that all such cases be classified under the general heading of exemptions, the second general class of inhibiting considerations to be discussed below. However, the recognition of such illnesses in their mild-moderate forms - especially when their expression is relatively localized in a person's life - often functions to excuse the behavior and/or trait rather than exempt the agent. 16. This leaves open the question in particular cases of whether the agent may be responsible for manifestations of the motivational disposition even if not for the disposition itself. 17.

The sense of appropriateness and inappropriateness here, of course, is dictated by the logic of our responsibility practices, not the social circumstances. 18. To this point, the "moral community" referred to those subject to both the action and character-focused reactive attitudes, but as our concern here narrows, I will for the sake of ease of expression intend by the phrase only to refer to their being subject to the latter. 19. Harry Frankfurt, "Identification and Wholeheartedness ," in The Importance of What We Care About (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1988), 171-72 (author's emphasis). For similar suggestions, see Charles Taylor's "Responsibility for Self," in The Identities of Persons , ed. A. O. Rorty (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1976); and Gerald Dworkin's remarks in The Theory and Practice of Autonomy (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1988), 20. 20. Harry Frankfurt, "Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person," in The Importance of What We Care About. 21. Here, I am now linking the two substantive aspects of a trait of character discussed earlier with two objects of identification that have been highlighted by both Taylor (282-85) and Frankfurt (e.g., "Identification and Externality," in The Importance of What We Care About, 66-67) in their discussions of the types of motivational conflict that one may seek to resolve via identification. 22. The first stage in my developmental story roughly combines the first two of Lawrence Kohlberg's developmental stages (Lawrence Kohlberg, Essays on Moral Development, Vol II: The Psychology of Moral Development [San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1984] ). Though the upper stages (5-6) of Kohlberg's six-stage scheme have been the locus of much con- troversy, there seems to be considerable empirically backed confidence in his characteri- zation of the first four stages. As is widely acknowledged, children vary greatly in their rate of moral development, and the boundaries between developmental stages are not firm. In case the reader is curious, I am imagining that children enter what I have called the "first stage" after infancy and begin evolving into the second sometime during their early ele- mentary years. 23. See the following for accounts of the early development of second-order reflection: N. J. H. Dent, The Moral Psychology of the Virtues (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1984), 123-29; and Lawrence Haworth, Autonomy: An Essay in Philosophical Psychology (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1986), chs. 1-2. 24. Dent, The Moral Psychology of the Virtues, 125-26. 25. One critique of appealing to identification in accounts of free agency is that it miscon- strues the object of practical reflection. For example, Gary Watson has argued that prac- tical reasoning typically operates at the first-order level and is focused on which course of action to pursue rather than at the second-order level focused on which first-order desire to satisfy (as perhaps suggested by the present example). After reaching a conclusion about which action to perform, Watson acknowledges that one may indeed form a second-order volition supporting the desire to act in the way one's practical reason identified as best, but if that is correct, then with respect to free agency it is first-order activity that explains 91</page><page sequence="28">second-order activity rather than the other way around ("Free Agency," 30). I tend to think that Watson is correct in his original criticism, but this would not undermine the point of the present example in the text or the usefulness of appeal to identification in an account of responsibility for character. What is important about the present example is that it sug- gests that one may form higher-order desires at a quite young age. It matters not whether those are the primary objects versus derivative products of practical reflection. And even if a hierarchical model is not explanatorily central in an account of free agency for the rea- son Watson cites, it is important to note that the relevant focus of activity for an account of responsibility for character just is on what first-order motivations one is to be moved by. Therefore, the relevant activity occurs at the second-order level. 26. Harry Frankfurt, "Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person," 18. Though Frankfurt originally and for many years later characterized the higher-order volition as "endorsing" the lower-order desire, he has since distanced himself from such a characterization in favor of the more modest language of higher-order "acceptance" (see his "Reply to Michael E. Bratman," in Contours of Agency: Essays on Themes from Harry Frankfurty ed. Sarah Buss and Lee Overton [Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2002], 90, note 2. Since his more recent characterization is even weaker than the original and so subject to the same objection I raise in the text, I comment here only on his original formulation. Frankfurt later also added a requirement that one be satisfied with one's higher-order stance, a constraint I discuss below. 27. Bratman has developed his model in a series of essays. See, for example, "Identification, Decision, and Treating as a Reason," Philosophical Topics 24:2 (Fall 1996): 1-18; "Reflection, Planning, and Temporally Extended Agency," Philosophical Review 109:1 (January 2000): 35-61; "A Desire of One's Own ? Journal of Philosophy 100:5 (May 2003): 221-42; and "Hierarchy, Circularity, and Double Reduction," in Contours of Agency, 65-85. 28. David Shoemaker, "Caring, Identification, and Agency," Ethics 1 14 (October 2003): 91. See also, Harry Frankfurt, "On Caring," in Necessity, Volition, and Love (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 160. Though Frankfurt has not abandoned the structure of his earlier account of identification as the one central to human agency, he has, in his more recent work sought to explicate the notion of caring and recognizes that one may identify with a desire in a stronger sense when such caring guides one's volitions. For the stronger notion of identification as caring, see "On the Necessity of Ideals" in Necessity, Volition, and Love , 111. 29. This second of my stages roughly incorporates stages 3-4 of Kohlberg's scheme. 30. For most children, the singular "good" in "conception of the good" is probably apt, but I intend no endorsement of a singular conception of the good as the most ethically ade- quate by my use of the phrase. I'll continue to use the singular simply because "concep- tion of the goods" is stylistically awkward. 31. John Fischer and Mark Ravizza have also defended an account of taking responsibility for the springs of one's actions by appeal to a developmental story about how we become morally responsible agents ( Responsibility and Control [New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998], ch. 8). However, these authors regard as central to such an account the agent's coming to view herself as a proper recipient of the reactive attitudes, whereas I am empha- sizing what I take to be the basis for her coming to so view herself. I have argued elsewhere that an account of taking responsibility should not be founded principally on an agent's reflexive beliefs about her responsibility, in "Being Is Not Believing: Fischer and Ravizza on Taking Responsibility," Australasian Journal of Philosophy 79:4 (December 2001): 479-90. 32. One might also add that in order to be effective, the target of one's identification must be judgment-sensitive. That is, the lower-order desire's continued existence, or at least degree of effectiveness in motivating action, must depend upon whether or not its existence or effectiveness is endorsed by one's judgment. On judgment-sensitive desires, see Pettit and Smith, "Freedom in Belief and Desire," 438-40; Scanlon, What We Owe Each Other, 20; and Richard Moran, "Frankfurt on Identification," in Contours of Agency, 197-202. 33. In suggesting that the imagined individual lacks such a capacity I do not mean to suggest 92</page><page sequence="29">that it is literally impossible for him to engage in such reflection (e.g., that he suffers from some neurological deficit). It is rather to acknowledge the mundane fact that developing the capacity to engage in such critical reflection in a meaningful sense requires experience of a certain sort, which one may lack. This qualification is important, for some have held the - what seems to me implausible - view that in virtue of the bare conceptual possibil- ity of questioning one's conception of the good one can be said to have the capacity to engage in the réévaluation of that conception of the good: Merely in virtue of learning a language - in particular, learning to form the negation of a statement - every human being has the capac- ity to question existing practices, and to imagine that one's social world might be other than it is (Michelle Moody Adams, Fieldwork in Familiar Places: Morality, Culture , and Philosophy [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1997], 100). 34. "Responsibility for Self," 296. 35. Ibid., 299. In his brief remarks about responsibility for one's character, Dworkin seems to make the same error (20), despite his attempt to avoid an "intellectualist" account (17). 36. To elaborate further, moral responsibility is a "threshold" concept - i.e., one is fully responsible when one has achieved the threshold. (For the idea of a threshold concept, see Joel Feinberg, Harm to Self [New York: Oxford University Press, 1986], 29-30). Thus, in giving an account of moral responsibility one seeks to specify the conditions under which an individual is properly considered to have achieved the minimum required in order that she be an appropriate target of those attitudes associated with regarding persons as responsible. The sort of responsibility associated with the ideal of becoming increasingly more autonomous through critical reflection is, however, one that continues to admit of degree. 37. I take Kohlberg's longitudinal and cross-cultural studies on moral development to be evi- dence for this claim. In his studies, subjects classified as stage three or four in his scheme stated as reasons for acting morally the need to "be a good person in your own eyes," and the vast majority of adult subjects studied are classified as having reached these stages (Essays on Moral Development, Vol. II: The Psychology of Moral Development [San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1984], 172-74). 38. In his original account of free agency Gary Watson suggested that acculturated evaluations are not attributable to an agent in the appropriate sense: "Acculturated attitudes may seem more akin to evaluations than to appetite in that they are often expressed in evaluative lan- guage ('divorce is wicked') and result in feelings of guilt ... But since conflict is possible here, to want something as a result of acculturation is not thereby to value it, in the sense of "to value' that we want to capture" ("Free Agency," 25). Watson comes to this conclu- sion by noting that acculturated attitudes, like one's appetitive and passionate desires, may come into conflict with one's current, all things considered, judgment concerning what is best. But this shows only that acculturated attitudes, or values, may become irrational (or nonrational) insofar as they become judgment insensitive, not that they are inherently so. 39. Again, see Watson, "Free Agency," 30. My aim in what follows is to extend this point which concerns identification with a particular desire to identification with a character disposition. 40.
