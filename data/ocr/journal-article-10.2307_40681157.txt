<plain_text><page sequence="1">Valli Rao SEEKING THE UNKNOWABLE: SHAW IN INDIA In January 1933, when Shaw was seventy-six years old, he made a brief visit to India as part of his world cruise aboard the Empress of Britain. Unwilling to be a conventional tourist visiting typical tourist spots around India, he sought out for himself temples in and around Bombay that he appears to have observed very carefully. Shaw's reactions and movements in Bombay are understandable in the light of his previous interest in and familiarity with the civilization of India, particularly the religious environment. In their turn, his reactions and movements in Bombay help to interpret certain crucial ideas that recur systematically in his late plays. The purpose of this essay is to trace briefly Shaw's ear- lier knowledge of India, the details of his stay in Bombay, and the way in which the latter could be used to explain the keynote of one late play in particular: The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles. From his formative years as a writer, Shaw had looked for a credible religion that would satisfy his needs. Works as early as the unfinished Passion Play (1878) and The Quintessence of Ibsenism (1891) provide indi- cations of his distrust of established orthodox religion, and of a consist- ent skepticism towards both the empty mysticism of orthodox religion as well as the materialism inherent in the secularism that attracted many of his contemporaries. The author of The Quintessence of Ibsenism saw the curious "correlation" that exists between the rationalism found in ortho- dox religion and the rationalism found in materialism, arising in the former case from reasoning about the "hollowness of materialism" and in the latter case from a vehement rejection of the existence or impor- tance of things of the spirit.1 Neither the religion of the spiritual ration- alist nor that of the material rationalist satisfied Shaw, whose attempt was to find a religion with a balanced content of the material and the spiritual, the natural and the supernatural. His religion, as The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles evidences, had eventually to be one that would de-</page><page sequence="2">182 VALLI RAO spise neither matters of spirit nor of flesh, and that would struggle to understand the crucial connections between the Word and the Flesh. As he continued his search, he followed with interest the religious explo- rations of some of his colleagues and friends, explorations that are of relevance here insofar as they concern India. One of the most unusual adventures was undertaken by Annie Besant, a close colleague in the Fabian movement. Arthur H. Nethercot's account in The First Five Lives of Annie Besant and The Last Four Lives of Annie Besant gives us clear and fascinating details of Dr. Besant's plunge from western materialism into eastern mysticism after reading Madame H.R Blavatsky's The Secret Doc- trine (1888). Shaw admired the strength that the change brought in her.2 He was, nevertheless, strongly aware of the opposition of his own brand of religious realism, which he revelled in, to the idealism of the theos- ophist position, which he regarded as escapist.3 Another friend was Florence Farr, who had a strong interest in occul- tism and who eventually, in Ceylon, proclaimed herself as a Vedantist. Shaw had a strong degree of skepticism. In 1895, he thought her a woman "who has no religion at all" (CL 1, 504-5) and saw her chief weakness as her inability for hard professional work, which he tried to inculcate in her: "but her early life had been too easy. I failed, and had to give up worrying and discouraging her. She found the friend she needed in Yeats. What she called 'cantillating' for him was within her powers."4 Shaw thought little of such cantillating and did not hesitate in telling her so. He wrote to her that she should concentrate on clear articulation and on the meaning of her words instead of being exclu- sively absorbed in the manner of her recitations. He concluded that "Yeats is heaping fresh artificialities and distractions and impertinences on you instead of sternly nailing you to the simple point of conveying the meaning and feeling of the author" (CL 2, 275). Shaw was also un- sympathetic to Miss Farr 's attempts at translating the Rig Vedas: All I can say about these Rig- Vedas is that those who advise you to throw them into narrative form are, as might be expected, dolts. They will interest nobody but the people who have taken up this particular craze; and the dialogue form will be more convenient for them than a nonsensical attempt to adapt it to the Strand Magazine people. ... Do not be misled by the sloppy-minded lunatics; if you want to write popular books, write them: if you want to write mystic gospels, write them; but in the name of commonsense dont try to popularise your mysticism or to mystify your popular readers.5 Part of Shaw's antagonism to empty mysticism of this sort, as he viewed it, arose from an impatience toward superstition that he shared with material rationalists like William Archer. In a note that acts as a preface to three of Archer's plays, Shaw expressed, at some length, his</page><page sequence="3">SHAW IN INDIA 183 agreement with Archer's realistic and skeptical look at India, an attitude very different from the Theosophical and Vedantist outlook. Of the book that resulted from Archer's visit to India, Shaw wrote At that time it was the fashion for literary European travellers returning from Asia to display their susceptibilities to the call of the East by depict- ing an India of boundless and magical fascination lit up with Bengal lights, saturated with the charm of Pierre Loti's romances, adorned with the temples of a living religion more profound than our own, and inhab- ited by Rabindranath Tagores and dark eyed enchantresses, with Mahat- mas in the mountain background. These enthusiasts were more Indian than any Indian; and their readers, who had never been in India, began where they left off, and went much further into an imaginary east. Archer went to see for himself, and instantly and uncompromisingly de- nounced the temples as the shambles of a barbarous ritual of blood sac- rifice, and the people as idolaters with repulsive rings through their noses. He refused to accept the interest of Indian art and the fictions of Indian romance as excuses. He remained invincibly faithful to Western civilization, and told the Indians flatly what a civilized western gentleman must think of them and feel about some of their customs. ... It is certain that if ... the Indians are ever to say "It was a good thing for us that the westerners came and taught us something," it will be because the English criticism of India was Archer's criticism, and not that of occidental rene- gades who swell the heads of our Indian students by assuring them that we are crude barbarians compared to them. Archer would have been the last man to deny that we are shocking barbarians. . . . All the same, the Fundamentalist does not sacrifice his daughter or even his calf and would send anyone who did to the electric chair or the lunatic asylum; and the eastern toleration of noserings is not justified by the western toleration of earrings. People who make the one an excuse for the other will never do anything to lighten the load of human superstition; and as this was really Archer's appointed task in life he wrote one of the most useful because one of the most resolutely unsympathetic books on India pro- duced in his generation.6 Shaw understood very well the attitude of the material rationalist who wanted to fight superstition, particularly in spiritual matters. The chief reason why he seems uninterested in the superficial exoticism of India is not the negative one of disliking superstition; it arises rather from a more positive diversion of energy and attention to getting at the true essence that Indian religion has to offer. Shaw could identify his own religious instincts, for instance, in a personage like the Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi. The reader of Man and Superman will have no trouble in realizing that when Shaw in a note to Henry Salt equates "Super- man = Mahatma" (CL 2, 349), the qualities he has in mind are the Gan- dhian and positive qualities of hard work, discipline, and self-control</page><page sequence="4">184 VALLI RAO (the greatest virtue that belongs to the Creative Evolutionist). To Shaw, Gandhi was also an example of the natural leader, the born boss of his later plays, an inspired ruler like King Magnus of The Apple Cart. When in 1945 Gandhi was attacked on grounds of being out of date and was asked to retire in favor of Nehru, Shaw, as D. G. Tendulkar relates, "stepped in to defend Gandhi: 'Gandhi's politics is half a century out of date. His tactics like all tactics are subject to error and readjustment, but his strategy is sound, as it was fifty or five million years ago.' As for Gandhi's retiring, he added: 'Retire from what? His position is natural, not official. The Mahatma cannot hand over anything. Leadership is not a plug of tobacco that can be passed from one man to another.'"7 Shaw met Gandhi in London in November 1931 when Gandhi was there to participate in the Round Table Conference. The meeting ap- pears to have left them mutually satisfied. Among other comments to a group of journalists before he left London, Gandhi remarked of Shaw "I think he is a very good man. ... I think he is a very witty man, a lover of epigram and paradox, with a Puck-like spirit and a generous ever- young heart, the Arch Jester of Europe."8 Gandhi, who had read various books by Shaw including Man and Superman and The Black Girl in Her Search for God, was one of the few contemporary readers of Shaw who was thoroughly convinced of the religious content of Shaw's work. Countering Vincent Sheean's doubts regarding Shaw's religion, Gandhi, "still smiling almost playfully at the thought [of Shaw having no reli- gion], said with his slow, careful enunciation: 'I was just about to say that it would be difficult for anybody to say that Bernard Shaw had no reli- gion. In everything of his that I have read there has been a religious centre."9 At the meeting in London, Gandhi and Shaw seemed to under- stand each other extremely well. During their hour-long conversation Shaw questioned Gandhi on "a bewildering variety of topics - ethno- graphical, religious, social, political, economic," and he also remarked, "I knew something about you and felt something in you of a kindred spirit. We belong to a very small community on earth."10 When Shaw visited Bombay in 1933, it was the kinship he felt with Gandhi that prompted his responses to queries from journalists about his opinion of the Indian leader. In 1933 my father was starting his journalistic career as an apprentice with The Times of India. He accom- panied a senior journalist who interviewed Shaw for about half an hour one afternoon, and towards the end of the interview the young appren- tice shot out his timid question: "What do you think, sir, of Mahatma Gandhi?" Shaw, "with a twinkle in his eyes" as my father always recalls, replied, "Mr. Gandhi is the second greatest man in the world!" Shaw's visit to Bombay was widely publicized by the Indian press. The newspaper-reading, educated Indian middle classes did not, any more</page><page sequence="5">SHAW IN INDIA 185 than their British counterparts, understand the depth of Shaw's reli- gious quest; but they had always liked Shaw for his humor and wit, and his ability to supply appropriate epigrams for any occasion. They en- joyed reading of his visit and the interviews he gave. Typical of press response is the article on page 3 of The Times of India, dated Monday 9 January 1933. n Under the heading "India is the Centre of the British Empire" and the sub-heading "It takes Mr. Gandhi very long to find the world is not like him," the report summarizes Shaw's interview with a group of Indian journalists the day after his arrival in Bombay. Shaw discussed a variety of subjects, as the report informs us in the opening paragraph. "Casting off all reserve and sparkling with wit and humor, he apparently enjoyed the heckling to which he was subjected by his interviewers on every conceivable subject. Disarmament, the future of Indo-British relations, untouchability, and the prospects of the next world war were some of the subjects upon which Mr. Shaw discoursed." A couple of comments remind us of situations Shaw was to envisage in The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles. Talking of dominion status and the future of the British Empire, Shaw said, "We were told in a lecture the other day on board that the population of India was 315,000,000. It is a formidable figure. Taking things as a whole, therefore, India is the centre of the British Empire. . . . Consequently the British Empire is not a Christian Empire; it is more a Hindu or a Mohamedan Empire. It is quite possible in the future, Indian institutions will develop and if the population becomes more educated, instead of India wanting to be separated, a time will come when England may make a desperate struggle to get separated from you, and you will decline to allow it." Pra in Act II of The Simpleton mentions how "since India won Dominion status Delhi has been the centre of the British Empire" (BH 6, 807). And a few pages later, in the same act, the four siblings read their news from newspapers: Kanchin. The land that brought forth Iddy begins the apocalypse. Hyering. What do you mean? Has anything happend in England? Kanchin. England has broken loose. . . . [reading the headlines] Dissolu- tion of the British Empire. Jang a [reading] Withdrawal of England from the Empire. Kanchin. England strikes for independence. Janga. Downing Street declares for a right little tight little Island. Kanchin. The British Prime Minister cuts the cable and gives the new slogan. Janga. Back to Elizabeth's England; and to hell with the empire! Kanchin. Ireland to the rescue!</page><page sequence="6">186 VALLI RAO Jangá. Free State President declares Ireland cannot permit England to break the unity of the Empire. Ireland will lead the attack on treason and disruption. [BH 6, 813-14] The germ of these ideas may be seen to originate in Shaw's press inter- view in Bombay. The comments on Gandhi made by Shaw at the interview are consist- ent with his admiration for him as an exceptional human being, morally as superior to his contemporaries as Pra and Prola in The Simpleton are to those around them: "I have not seen very much of the population of India yet, but I have noticed that every man I see in Bombay is not a Gandhi. . . . He is, of course, the sort of man who occurs once in several centuries. It is very hard for you to understand him. The result is he always gets tired of you and threatens to fast and kill himself. If I saw him I would simply say, 'Give them up; it is not your job.' It takes him very long to find out that the world is not like him." It was, however, encouraging to know, he went on, that there was such a person as Mr. Gandhi, because there might come a future when the whole population of India would be much more like Gandhi than they were at present. Perhaps the compromise of Pra and Prola with the other couples in The Simpleton and with the eugenic experiment may be seen in terms of the necessity or otherwise for the involvement of the superior moral and religious force with the commonplace, and the whole compromise seen in terms of Shaw's understanding, when he writes The Simpleton, of why Gandhi could not "give them up" as not being his job. The report in The Times of India indicates that most of the 300 passen- gers on board the ship planned to divide into three parties for tours into India. About half the number were to leave on the night of the 9th of January for visits to Delhi and Agra. Others planned to make even more extended tours of the country. Shaw and his wife did not intend to make any trips outside Bombay. "It is suggested that I should make an exten- sive tour of India, but on examining the map I find that I should hardly see anything except the inside of a railway carriage, the country is so vast," remarked Shaw to the reporters. Further, his attitude as a traveller appears to coincide with that of Peter Keegan in John Bull's Other Island who thinks that the wonders of all countries are the same in essence, if the traveller could but look with the "eyes in his soul as well as in his head" (BH 2, 929). "You must understand," Shaw told the journalists, "that I do not look upon Indians as unlike Englishmen." This remark, incidentally, is the strong undercurrent that informs an article on India</page><page sequence="7">SHAW IN INDIA 187 that Shaw wrote in 1914 for The Commonweal, the journal started that year by Annie Besant for the Theosophical Society in Adyar, Madras.12 Comments such as those quoted above at the interview in Bombay are scattered through the article, the point of which appears to be that in order to throw off* the yoke of the British as a foreign power, Indians should train their children not to be submissive to their elders but to be free to assert their freedom to be themselves, to fight anybody (whether it be their elders or the British) who tries to keep them "quiet, silent, obedient, respectful." Shaw writes: One man is very like another . . . one nation is very like another. . . . The truth is, all nations have been conquered; and all peoples have submitted to tyrannies which would provoke sheep or spaniels to insurrection. I know nothing in the history of India that cannot be paralleled from the histories of Europe. ... It is not a matter of national character at all [whether a country's people are cowards or whether they are brave]. Eng- lish soil is like Indian soil: you reap what you sow, in the animal world as in the vegetable. . . . The Indian who admits that they [the virtues of being brave] are any less characteristic of eastern human nature than of western human nature is, if I may be so blunt, a fool. The superficial difference between the British and the Indian does not impose on Shaw anymore than the exotic out-of-the-way wonders that the average tourist might wonder at. But that does not mean that Shaw was uninterested in India. As the report in The Times of India observes, "Throughout the conversation Mr. Shaw kept questioning his question- ers, obviously trying to gather something about conditions in India." And Shaw wrote to Rabindranath Tagore, as reported in a news item in The Hindu of 19 January 1933: ". . . the ship in which I am going round the world to get a little rest and do a little work has to put in at Bombay and Colombo to replenish her tanks and on such occasions I step ashore for a few hours and wander about the streets and such temples as are open to European untouchables." During the week's stay in Bombay he visited local Jain temples and the Elephanta caves, places of worship he sought for himself. His escort on the visits to two of the Jain temples, Hiralal Amritlal Shah, gives us an interesting account of the afternoon on which the visits were made and of the following day when he took his collection of photographs (of temples like the Delwada temples on Mount Abu) for Shaw to examine, which he was able to do in detail with the aid of a magnifying glass.13 The temples to which Shaw was escorted were the Jain temple dedi- cated to the deity Shri Godi Parshwanathji, in the suburb of Pydhunie, and the Babu's Jain marble temple, built on a hilltop in Walkeshwar hills. The central marble image (Fig. 1) in the latter temple, along with the various small images surrounding it (Figs. 2, 3, and 4) provided much</page><page sequence="8">188 VALLI RAO Fig. i. The main deity in the Walkeshwar temple: Shri Adinathji, meditating in the Pad- masana posture. food for thought for the votary of Creative Evolution. Before we ex- amine the influence of these scenes on Shaw's thinking, let us recall Hir- alal Amritlal Shah's record of them: We proceeded to the Walkeshwar Hills to see the Babu's Jain Marble Temple, built on a hilltop. Mr. Shaw expressed delight at the panoramic view that spread before his eyes. Inside, in its sanctum, stood the huge central marble image of Tirthankara (Prophet), and Mr. Shaw was able to observe it at close range. I explained to him how the image showed the expressions of Yogi in Dhyana (meditation), seated cross-legged in Padmasana posture (that is, each leg resting on the other thigh, the palms of the hands opened out and resting one on the other in the center, above the legs; the gaze of the eyes fixed on the tip of the nose; the body remaining perfectly erect and in a sitting position, while controlling the breath). Around the central shrine, in the surrounding walls, in individual niches, there were numerous small images of various gods and god- desses. Mr. Shaw then directed his attention to the details of these images and observed them intensely, putting several queries to me. I explained to him the different characteristics of these images and of such other types as the God "Harina Naigameshi," etc. "When the people see these sculptured images," he asked, "do they accept them, in their beliefs and</page><page sequence="9">SHAW IN INDIA 189 Fig. 2.

I af- firmed this. We learn from allusions in Shaw's writings that the stark contrast be- tween the ideal that the Jain religion contains and the reality to which it had accommodated itself, impressed itself strongly upon Shaw's mind. Again and again, in the years to come, he returns to the message implicit in the Jain images, in an attempt to understand the fall of man when viewed as a fall from true religion into idolatry, from what in the Bla- kean world is a fall from the spiritual to the material, from an imagina- tive grasp of reality to an effort at a literal hold of apparent reality. The attempt to understand man's fall in terms of a fall from true religion to idolatry may indeed be seen as forming a major impulse in the make-up of The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles. The most widely applicable philosophic conclusions are drawn in the Preface to Farfetched Fables , written in 1948-49: ... all the established religions in the world are deeply corrupted by the necessity for adapting their original inspired philosophic creeds to the narrow intelligences of illiterate peasants and of children. Eight thou- sand years ago religion was carried to the utmost reach of the human mind by the Indian Jainists, who renounced idolatry and blood sacrifice long before Micah, and repudiated every pretence to know the will of God, forbidding even the mention of his name in the magnificent temples they built for their faith. But go into a Jainist temple today: what do you find? Idols everywhere. Not even anthropomorphic idols but horse idols, cat idols, elephant idols and what not? The statues of the Jainist sages and saints, far from being contemplated as great seers, are worshipped as gods. For such examples it is not necessary to travel to Bombay. The articles of the Church of England begin with the fundamental truth that God has neither body, parts, nor passions, yet presently enjoin the acceptance as divine revelation of a document alleging that God exhibited his hind quarters to one of the prophets. . . . Shaw is not an idealist of the sort who necessarily or merely condemns the deep corruption that occurs in a religion as it is adapted to the needs of a people. His foremost concern is to understand the problem clearly, as his treatment of it in two instances makes clear. One instance occurs in chapter 43 of Everybody's Political What's What? in the section titled "Religious Summary": Anthropomorphic Deism will remain for long as a workable hypothesis not only for children but for many adults. Prayer consoles, heals, builds the soul in us. ... But there are all sorts of prayers, from mere beggars' petitions and magic incantations to contemplative soul building, and all sorts of divinities to pray to. A schoolboy who witnessed a performance</page><page sequence="11">SHAW IN INDIA 191 of my play St Joan, told his schoolmaster that he disliked Jesus and could not pray to him, but that he could pray to Joan. [The schoolmaster wisely] told the boy to pray to Joan by all means: it is the prayer and not the prayee that matters. To the Franciscan, Francis and not Jesus is the redeemer; and to countless Catholics and not a few Anglicans Our Lady is the intercessor. To the Jains God is Unknowable; but their temple in Bombay is full of images of all sorts of saints, from nameless images of extraordinary beatific peace to crude elephant-headed idols. . . . Every Church should be a Church of All Saints, every cathedral a place for pure contemplation by the greatest minds of all races, creeds and colors. The other instance dramatically and tellingly impresses on us the ne- cessity of admitting the reality of the fallen world, and of religion in such a world being manipulated to a large extent by the Devil. Shaw wrote the film version of Major Barbara in 1940, 14 and in it he uses his experience in the Jain temples to underscore his point about the corrup- tion of religion. The second half of the last act of Major Barbara shows us Undershaft's town of Perivale St. Andrews, where his employees live and where the Undershaft weapons are manufactured. In the film ver- sion, Shaw takes the opportunity, as Undershaft guides his family on a tour through his city, to elaborate on the connection between orthodox religion and war. As Undershaft points out the various sights of his town, one of the places he halts at is "The Meeting Place of all Reli- gions," also called "Piety Square." His idealistic daughter Barbara, in the process of being converted from religious idealism to an appreciation of her father's realism, ponders curiously: "Is the real meeting place of all the religions a cannon foundry?" Undershaft invites them to have a closer look at the various religious buildings, and they go into a Jain Temple. They "stop before one of the shrines, in which is a seated im- age" much like the central image in Padmasana posture that Hiralal Am- ritlal Shah describes as the one Shaw saw in Bombay. The image fasci- nates the party: Barbara. How utterly wonderful! Perfect peace! Perfect beauty! I think I shall become a Jain too. What god is it? Undershaft. It is not a god. It is supposed to be only a wiseacre of some sort; but it is really a symbol. I am afraid it is worshipped and prayed to as a god, though the Jains hold that God is something beyond us with which they dare not meddle. Even Lomax, the frivolous Church of England conformist, is impressed as he asks Undershaft whether the peace generated in the temple would not be "bad for the cannon trade." But Undershaft tells them the brutal truth, which the idealistic Cusins finds difficult to digest, that the image was made in Undershaft's town, and that it is a by-product of the cannon trade:</page><page sequence="12">192 VALLI RAO Undershaft. One of our troubles here used to be the waste of good gunmetal involved in making cannons. This went on until I had to visit India on business. I was greatly struck by these figures, especially as they were quite new; for I had enough waste metal here to supply all India with them. I found they were made in a certain place by a certain set of native workmen, and nowhere else. I went to that place and bought up the whole concern, workmen and all. The wages I offered were of course far beyond anything they had ever dreamt of. I promised them a temple as well: you are now in it. Sometimes, when my nerves are overwrought I come in here and sit for an hour before this shrine while a priest recites prayers in a language of which I do not understand one word. It soothes me as nothing else does. This Jain religion is far ahead of anything we have in the west. And thus the Jain religion is seen as depending on, and catering to, Undershaft-Mammon, even as the various other religions in Piety Square do. It seems appropriate that some of the wealthiest business- men and tradespeople in India today are Jains. Shaw's impressions of India, and her religious spirit, are recorded in detail by him in a letter dated 4 February 1933, written at sea in the Gulf of Siam. He wrote to Ensor Walters about Hinduism as the most tolerant of religions and as one that accommodates all manner of believers. Shaw reproduced this letter in chapter 25 oí Everybody's Political What's What? when he wrote about architecture as a world power: The apparent multiplication of Gods is bewildering at the first glance; but you soon discover that they are all the same God in different aspects and functions and even sexes. There is always one uttermost God who defies personification. This makes Hinduism the most tolerant religion in the world, because its one transcendant God includes all possible Gods, from elephant Gods, bird Gods, and snake Gods, right up to the great Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, which makes room for the Virgin Mary and modern Feminism by making Shiva a woman as well as a man. Christ is there as Krishna, who might also be Dionysos. In fact Hinduism is so elastic and so subtle that the profoundest Methodist and the crudest idolater are equally at home in it. Islam is very different, being ferociously intolerant. . . . The main dif- ference between the opposition of Islam to Hinduism and the opposition between Protestant and Catholic is that the Catholic persecutes as fiercely as the Protestant when he has the power; but Hinduism cannot perse- cute, because all the Gods - and what goes deeper, the no Gods - are to be found in its Temples. There is actually a great Hindu sect, the Jains, with Temples of amazing magnifience, which excludes God, not on ma- terialist atheist considerations, but as unspeakable and unknowable, tran- scending all human comprehension. So far, it is all simple enough for anyone with religious sense. When</page><page sequence="13">SHAW IN INDIA 193 you are face to face with the Temples and the worshippers, you find that before Mahomet and the founder of the Jains were cold in their graves, the institutions and rituals they founded began to revert to the more popular types, and all the Gods and no Gods became hopelessly mixed up, exactly as the Apostles backslid when Jesus was killed. In the Jain Temple you find shrines and images, and baths where you must wash all over before you may enter the shrine and adore the image. If you can find an intelligent Priest who is a real Jain theologian, you say "How's this? A God in the Jain Temple!" He explains to you that the image is not a God but a portrait of one of their great Saints; and that the man just out of the bath prostrating himself is not worshipping but expressing his respect for the memory of the late eminent Ensoramji Waltershagpat. But it is like Dean Inge trying to explain away St. Paul. It is perfectly plain that the image is a super refined Buddha, and that Jainism and Buddhism have got hopelessly mixed. Jain Buddha is attended by sculp- tured elephants. You ask what they mean, and are told they are purely ornamental works of art. Then your eye lights on an image of Ganesh, the Hindu God with the head and trunk of an elephant. On the point of exclaiming "Que diable fait-il dans cette galère?", you remember that you must not put your courteous host in a corner, and politely hold your tongue, but think furiously. It is always the same. Outside the few who have religious sense, and who are equally at home and equally estranged in all the temples of all the faiths, there is the multitudinous average man. What he demands from the founder of his faith is, first, miracles. If, like Mahomet, you rebuke him and tell him that you are not a conjurer, or like Jesus, turn on him angrily with "An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign," you will waste breath; for when you have become famous through your preaching, and cured the sick by healing their minds and thereby curing their bodies, your average man will invent miracles enough for you to eclipse Saint Anthony of Padua. Then he will make you his God, which means that he will beg from you, and, when he is properly fright- ened of you, make sacrifies to propitiate you, even to the extent of killing his daughter (Iphigenia or Miss Jephtha) to please you; but he will soon begin to cheat by substituting a ram for his son (Isaac) and making the sacrifice purely symbolic and imaginary. And so finally it is not through the authentic principles of the founder of his faith that you must get at him if you are to make a decent human being of him. You must govern fools acording to their folly. In Jamaica and Rhodesia all the good negros and their great ministers and leaders are Fundamentalists. If you rubbed Bradlaugh and Ingersoll into them, you would probably not only shock but demoralize them. You find the same thing in our mining villages. Shaw concluded, "It is clear from my letter to Ensor Walters that a freethinking westerner can feel as much at home in the temples of the farthest east as in a British or foreign cathedral. The dozens of person- ifications by which the manifold nature of the Life Force is represented</page><page sequence="14">194 VALLI RAO trouble him no more than the three persons of the Trinity, plus the Vir- gin Mother goddess, to say nothing of a host of minor gods called saints." In The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles, Shaw gives us an example of an unenlightened person of the sort who does not feel at home with the personifications by which the manifold nature of the Life Force is rep- resented. She is Lady Farwaters, known to us at first as an English lady tourist, a Christian missionary who is trying to identify the various im- ages around her in scene 3 of the Prologue to The Simpleton. The scene is set in the cave temple of Elephanta, as Shaw informed Floryan Sobi- eniowski when discussing the Polish translation of the play: "the third scene of the prologue is taken from the caves of Elephanta, an island near Bombay. The giant figures are of Indian deities. It is impossible to describe them." 15 It is here that Shaw had seen the figure of Ardhanar- isvara, Shiva as half male and half female, to which he referred in the letter to Ensor Walters as making room for the Virgin Mary and modern Feminism. In The Simpleton, the recruits for the ensuing eugenic exper- iment gather in this magic cave. An introductory dialogue ensues be- tween Lady Farwaters as the Lady Tourist, Pra as the Priest, Prola as the Priestess, and Mrs. Hyering as the Young Woman. The L.T.

Who are you calling heathen idolaters?</page><page sequence="15">SHAW IN INDIA 195 Look at all those images. I should say, if you ask me, that the boot is on the other leg. The Priest. Those images are not idols: they are personifications of the forces of nature by which we all live. But of course to an idolater they are idols. (BH 6, 776-77] Shaw commented on the meaning of this passage and tried to explain the idea of the unity of God in the midst of a variety of images, an idea that flashed home to him in the Jain temples, in a letter to Dame Lau- rentia McLachlan. The Benedictine nun was the Abbess of Stanbrook with whom Shaw carried on extensive (and intensive) correspondence. They called each other Sister Laurentia and Brother Bernard, and she had asked for and received a copy of The Simpleton, as yet unpublished. This was in January 1935. She discovered the divinity under the profan- ity, as Shaw had said she would. She also objected strongly to some of the profanity, and commanded him to "omit the allusion to the Immac- ulate Mother. . . . You know, as well as I do, that we do not worship her as God," and wanted him to say a Hail Mary in penance. Shaw replied promptly, from the east coast of Africa where he was travelling, and wondered why Dame Laurentia should "fly out at me when I devoutly insist that the Godhead must contain the Mother as well as the Father." In typical unrepentant fashion he took the opportunity to remind Dame Laurentia that he was "always saying Hail Mary! on my travels. Of course I dont say it in that artificial form which means nothing. I say it in my own natural and sincere way when She turns up in the temples and tombs of Egypt and among the gods of Hindustan - Hallo, Mary! For you cannot really get away from Her. She has many names in the guide books, and many disguises. But She never takes me in. She fa- vours Brother Bernardo with special revelations and smiles at his de- lighted 'Hello, Mary!' When I write a play like The Simpleton and have to deal with divinity in it She jogs my elbow at the right moment and whis- pers 'Now Brother B. dont forget me,1 and I dont." He goes on to analyse the various Marys of Raphael as too human ("highly respectable Italian farmers' daughters") and, on the other hand, the giantess-goddess of Cimabue as having "just a little too much of the image and too little reality," and he concludes with a reference to the Jain temples he visited in Bombay: In short, the Christian Maries are all failures. This suggests that the Jains were right in excluding God from their ritual as beyond human power to conceive or portray. At least that is their theory; but in practice they have in their shrines images of extraordinary beauty and purity of design who throw you into an ecstasy of prayer and a trance of peace when they look at you, as no Christian iconography can.</page><page sequence="16">196 VALU RAO I said to the pundit who showed me round "Those images are surely gods, are they not?" "Not at all," he said, "they are statues of certain very wise men of the Jains." This was obvious nonsense; so I pointed out that man kneeling in the shrine (having first washed himself from head to foot) was clearly praying to a god. "Pooh!" said the pundit with enormous contempt, "he is only a heathen idolater." It is in these temples that you escape from the frightful parochiality of our little sects of Protestants and Catholics, and recognize the idea of God everywhere, and understand how the people who struggled hardest to establish the unity of God made the greatest number of fantastically different images of it, producing on us the effect of crude polytheism.16 A major concern of The Simpleton is indicated in the conversation be- tween Pra and Prola and Lady Farwaters: the gulf between two different ways of viewing God, one involving an appreciation of the life-force, which evokes artistically worthwhile images of God (such as those Shaw found in the Elephanta caves), the other involving an adoration of the physical without the spiritual: the first may be defined as true religion, the second as idolatry. As Pra observes the same image may give scope to both ways of looking at it: "Those images are not idols: they are per- sonifications of the forces of nature by which we all live. But of course to an idolater they are idols." It is, as Shaw observed to Ensor Walters, the prayer and not the prayee that makes the crucial difference. And when the prayer reaches the nadir of idolatry, then a Last Judgment is triggered, with the irresponsible idolaters classed as dispensables to be liquidated and the responsible, self-respecting worshippers of the Life Force recognized as indispensable helpers in the struggle of life towards further evolution. The movement of The Simpleton leads us from the pure religious and spiritual force that inspires Pra and Prola at one end, through the simple Adamic trauma of Iddy caught between the spiritual and the material, to the mocking materialism and idolatry of Maya and her siblings at the other end, the whole movement culminating in the Judgment that destroys the idolaters. In what ways may we trace the basic inspiration for the movement of the play to Shaw's various encounters with India, particularly the con- trast between true faith and idolatry that the Hindu and Jain temples brought home to him? Also how far do Gandhian ideas of responsibility and self-judgment dominate the play more than the Russian ideal that Shaw defends in the Preface, of a tribunal of human judges exterminat- ing those around them? The Preface does not give a hint of the play's connection with India: It advertises the play as being directly inspired by the Russian change- over to communism and the role of the Cheka in exterminating the idle and the socially useless. Even in the Preface, though, an attempt is made</page><page sequence="17">SHAW IN INDIA 197 to give a universal and a religious dimension to the political change in Russia. There is the unusual linking of Communist Russia with early Christianity, with the "communist principles of Jesus, Peter and Paul," a connection that allows for the association, later in the Preface, of the Russian Cheka with the Apocalyptic judgment and of Djerjinsky with the Angel who appears in the play. The play itself contains very little allusion to Russia, the only direct mention being when Wilks applies "the Russian touch" in shooting himself in the back of the head and when Pra hears on telephone about the "Russian plot" to destroy valu- able citizens as the Last Judgment flourishes. F.P.W. McDowell, in one of the most perceptive analyses of The Simple- ton, commented on the difference of emphasis in the play and the pref- ace: "Shaw's thesis that the socially undesirable should be eliminated has its most valid projection in the allegory of this play, which has a tentative, experimental and 'as if flavor about it. The imaginative toying with the ideas of a last judgment in which the wages of social indifference is death is far more satisfying than the explicit exposition of such views in the preface to the play."17 In this context, it is worth pursuing the means Shaw used to universalize the Russian case, keeping in mind Shaw's hint to Hesketh Pearson that "I have been something of a globe-trotter since I married a nomadic wife; but I dont think it has left much mark on any of my plays except the Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles, which you dont appreciate. I could not have written it exactly as it is if I had not been in India and the Far East, though almost all my life as a playwright I have hankered after a dramatization of the Last Judgment."18 The Last Judgment that occurs in the play has not only biblical over- tones but Hindu overtones, and Gandhian overtones, attached to it. Correspondingly, Pra and Prola have the strength and integrity that they share with other Christ figures in the Shavian oeuvre, such as Dick Dudgeon, Barbara, and Joan; they also have substantial components in their nature of a Gandhian sense of responsibility, as well as of the su- perior terrifying and judgmental aspect that belongs to Hindu divinities like Shiva and Parvati. The ancient cave temples of Elephanta are dedicated to Shiva and his consort Parvati and feature sculptures of Shiva in various moods and forms, most of them carved out in the fifth or sixth century. Many of the sculptures are in a partially damaged condition now, but what remains is still magnificently impressive. There are joyous life-celebrating forms such as Shiva Lalita (Shiva as the lord of dance, engaged in the dance of creation), Kalyanasundara (the marriage of Shiva and Parvati), Ganga- dhara (Shiva channelling the energy of the sacred river Ganga through</page><page sequence="18">198 VALU RAO his hair so that it does good and not harm to the world as it rushes down from heaven), and Yogisvara (Shiva the great Yogi, meditating in the Padmasana posture on a lotus seat). There are also terrifyingly destruc- tive forms such as that which shows Shiva's slaying of the demon An- dhaka. The co-existence of the life-giving with the life-destroying forms finds its epitome in Sadasiva, the central bust of Shiva which portrays three heads; to the left the creative, beautiful, and feminine aspect of Vamadeva, to the right the death-dealing aspect known as Aghora, and in the middle the face of Shiva as Tatpurasha, in which all manifesta- tions of Shiva are merged. The overwhelming message of the three- headed bust is the recognition of the necessity of both creation and de- struction in the life process. It could be seen as confirming for Shaw the rule he had upheld at all times, that life is not always and automatically sacred: capital punishment, Djerjinsky's schemes of liquidation, and similar devices for taking a citizen's life are universalized by being given divine sanction, and made a way of reckoning with what Shaw in the Preface to The Simpleton identifies as "the instinctive shrinking from out- right killing which makes so many people sign petitions for the reprieve of even the worst murderers, and take no further interest if a reprieve decrees that their lives shall be taken by the slow torture of imprison- ment" (p. 761). And again, "We need a greatly increased intolerance of socially injurious conduct and an uncompromising abandonment of punishment and its cruelties, together with a sufficient school inculca- tion of social responsibility to make every citizen conscious that if his life costs more than it is worth to the community the community may pain- lessly extinguish it" (p. 762). The existence side by side of life-giving and death-dealing aspects in the image of Sadasiva may be seen to have inspired the idea of the prox- imity of the cliff of death and the cliff of life in The Simpleton. As the Emigration Officer (later Hugo Hyering) makes for the edge of the cliff to hurl himself into the sea, his path is barred by Pra, the handsome priest: Pardon, Son of Empire. This cliff contains the temple of the goddess who is beyond naming, the eternal mother, the seed and the sun, the resur- rection and the life. You must not die here. I will send an acolyte to guide you to the cliff of death, which contains the temple of the goddess's brother, the weeder of the garden, the sacred scavenger, the last friend on earth, the prolonger of sleep and the giver of rest. It is not far off: life and death dwell close together. ... [p. 773] This theme of the free choice between life and death runs as an im- portant thread through the play. Pra, who in matters of practical wisdom is a total contrast to the unworldly Lama in Kipling's Kim (and it seems</page><page sequence="19">SHAW IN INDIA 199 to me that their creation reflects the respective attitudes of their authors towards India), comments on the Emigration Officer's desire for death: they [Englishmen] play games with balls marvellously well; but of the great game of life they are ignorant. Here, where they are in the midst of life and loveliness, they die by their own hands to escape what they call the horrors. We do not encourage them to live. The empire is for those who can live in it, not for those who can only die in it. [p. 774] Iddy's infatuation for Maya and Vashti is sealed with the kiss of death practically from its inception. He declares he would die for Maya ten times over, and is made to admit that he would also die a thousand times for Vashti, and a million times for either of the sisters: Iddy. Yes, yes. I would die for either, for both; for one, for the other - Maya. For Vashti Maya? Iddy. For Vashti Maya, for Maya Vashti. Vashti. Your lives and ours are one life. Maya [sitting down beside him] And this is the Kingdom of love. The three embrace with interlaced arms and vanish in black darkness. Their love ends in the death and nothingness into which Maya and Vashti dissolve, foreshadowed by the black darkness into which they, like the ancient Egyptian god Ra in Caesar and Cleopatra, disappear. Theirs is the attitude that asserts, with Kanchin, that "Without death there can be no heroism" (p. 831). The use of the Elephanta caves as the location for the temple scene in the Prologue involves a characteristically audacious reinstatement of original values on Shaw's part. The reality of Elephanta in 1933, as to- day, is described neatly by Gandhi when he laments the degeneration of places of worship: To my mind, a model temple means an ideal priest. Bricks and mortar do not make model temple. If the priest is good, even a rough hut will shine forth and earnest devotees will find solace there. And when there is no such priest, even a marble temple inlaid with mosaic would be a desolate structure. There are today a number of such famous ruins in India. . . . The caves of Karla, Ajanta and Gharapuri [Elephanta] were temples once. God has disappeared from there because of want of the priest and instead of devotees connoisseurs of art go there to see the works of art. . . . These days most of the temples are lifeless.19 Shaw makes such a place come alive again, and ensures that art is an expression of religion, as it is meant to be in temple architecture in In- dia, by endowing his temple with Pra and Prola, who give the play's meaning a symbolic richness. They act as the representatives, or human</page><page sequence="20">200 VALU RAO aspects, of Shiva and Parvati. And they represent not only the destruc- tive side but also the creative side of Shiva and Parvati: Thus while The Simpleton deals with death and extermination (as the Russian Cheka did), it is nevertheless preoccupied with life and the value and courage of living responsibly. Pra is a priest with an air of religion, purpose, and calm strength; Prola, married and with children to complete her expe- rience as a mother, is a priestess with as much power and strength as her male counterpart. In their equality they represent the male-female re- lationship in its ideal state (much as Shaw saw the Ardhanarisvara aspect of Shiva making room for the equality of women with men), with respect on both sides, and no discrimination or subjugation on either side. Pro- la's state may be seen to represent the state of women in ancient India when, according to the writings of Panini and Badarayana, they had as much right as men to spiritual knowledge of the scriptures and to being learned teachers. How and when later inhibitions and taboos crept into modern social customs and forced women to be passive, and to depend on their sexual power and the desire of men like Iddy to idolize them, is an interesting question which The Simpleton may be seen as tackling in the contrast it shows between the learning and behavior of Prola on the one hand and Maya and Vashti on the other hand. In the attempt to be representative of the creative aspect of Shiva and Parvati, Pra and Prola represent not only spiritual power but the bodily attraction of the sexes for each other. An archetype for the attraction of male and female towards each other may be found in essential form in the representation of Shiva as linga and Parvati as yoni, symbolic rep- resentations of the phallus and the womb, and in an attendant Hindu myth that the material world began with a gigantic act of copulation on the part of Shiva and Parvati. There is an impressively large linga in the central shrine, the garbhagrha (literally, the womb-house) at the western entrance to the Elephanta caves. The linga and yoni are typical symbols in Hinduism of divine procreative energy, which acts as the bridge be- tween the spiritual and the material. The Prologue to The Simpleton shows us one attempt at the fusion of the spiritual with the physical and material, in the setting afoot of the eugenic experiment. Shaw provides a contrast to the varied philosophies of Annie Besant the Theosophist, Florence Farr the Vedantist, and William Archer the Secularist, whose outlooks tended to view the spiritual and the material as being in sepa- rate watertight compartments and unable to relate to each other. In scene 3 of the Prologue the emphasis is on the connection between the spiritual and the physical. We are reminded of this connection right from the beginning, when the Young Woman learns, to her amazement, that Prola is married, although a priestess: "I could not be a priestess if I were not married. How could I presume to teach others without a</page><page sequence="21">SHAW IN INDIA 201 completed human experience? How could I deal with children if I were not a mother?" (p. 776). Pra can initially reach the soul of the lady tour- ist (Lady Farwaters) "only through the flesh, and accordingly he makes love to her. The male tourist - who is her husband, Sir Charles Farwa- ters, and later governor of the Isles - is simultaneously instructed in the same manner by Prola to a realization that a realm of life-giving values exists beyond those generally accepted by the British aristocracy."20 Prola involves the Young Woman and the Emigration Officer (later Mr. and Mrs. Hyering) too in the eugenic experiment, indicating that she and the Young Woman could "share" the Emigration Officer, and that the Young Woman should not think of running away from the situation arising in the cave. The reader might well wonder why Pra and Prola take so much initiative and trouble in their attempt to compromise with people obviously less evolved than themselves, when it appears more sensible to "give them up; it is not your job" as one may proclaim in echo of Shaw's advice to Gandhi at the press interview in Bombay. Pra and Prola have a purpose, of course, which is to blend "the flesh and spirit of the west with the flesh and spirit of the east" (p. 794) in an attempt to breed better children. This attempt at procreation with a purpose, as opposed to sexual fulfilment for its own sake, is itself Gandhian in con- cept, and may also be seen in terms of Gandhi's eveready compromise of his high religious and political ideals with the practicalities of political necessity, in his attempt to create an independent and better modern India. The result may or may not justify the attempt and the experi- ment, but that is immaterial, as Pra and Prola (in opposition to the Shaw whose advice to Gandhi would be to "give them up") conclude at the end of The Simpleton. The message at the end of the play may be inter- preted as indicating that the rest of the world may not live up to the standards of Pra and Prola, or of Gandhi, but that is no valid reason for their giving up the good fight to improve the world: Prola. Remember: we are in the Unexpected Isles; and in the Unex- pected Isles all plans fail. So much the better: plans are only jigsaw puz- zles ... we are not here to fulfil prophecies and fit ourselves into puzzles, but to wrestle with life as it comes. And it never comes as we expect it to come. ... I tell you this is a world of miracles, not of jigsaw puzzles. For me every day must have its miracle, and no child be born like any child that ever was born before. And to witness this miracle of the children I will abide the uttermost evil and carry through it the seed of the utter- most good. [p. 839] "Uttermost evil" and "a precious mess" (p. 838) might seem to be the result, in the short run, of the eugenic experiment as well as of Gandhi's attempts to achieve a free, independent, and godly generation in mod- ern India, but the experiment and the attempt must nevertheless still be</page><page sequence="22">202 VALLI RAO made, as we understand when we view the process as taking its cue from the attempt to fuse the spiritual and the material that is symbolized in the representation of Shiva and Parvati as linga and yoni. Why should commandingly superior religious strength such as that obvious in a priest like Pra, a priestess like Prola, and a mahatma like Gandhi, move to compromise with the physical and the material? Because life is one, because there can be no rigid barrier between the spiritual and the ma- terial, the spirit and the flesh, as the author of Back to Methuselah believed wholeheartedly when he elaborated on the attempts of fallen man to transform matter and flesh into thought and spirit. The myth of the fall of man itself, in this Blakean view of the universe, refers to a fall from spiritual wholeness into materialism, a happy and necessary fall in that the fall into matter saves man from a deeper and totally disastrous fall into chaos and, farther, into nonentity. The compromise between the spiritual and the material is justified in this light, and indicates a kinship of the two in an attempt to safeguard against further deterioration. It is also a fall fraught with danger, because one important consequence of such a compromise is that it could become easy to lose sight of the spir- itual in our involvement with the material, the physical appearance, to forget the essential reality in the pursuit of appearance and illusion, what the Hindus label maya. Shaw's attempt in The Simpleton may be seen to be an attempt to explore the relationship between the spirit and the flesh, how the spirit must compromise with the flesh, but also how avoid the danger of being totally overwhelmed by the flesh, to the point of idolatry. From Shaw's references to the Jain temples that we have looked at, it is clear that he could sense in modern Indian religious practice a loss of true faith and vision, exchanged for idolatrous worship of the physical image adorned with flowers and ornaments and finery of dress. Such a fall into materialism and idolatry is elaborated on in the first act of The Simpleton. The scene is set by the shift in location and mood that occurs between the Prologue and Act I, the two serving as bases for the Unfällen and the fallen world - paradise and earth, respectively - and exploring two powerful areas which appear to be connected as off- spring are to parents and which yet show the clash of apparently oppo- site forces. The location shifts from the ancient caves of Elephanta to a tropical island in the Pacific Ocean, and correspondingly there is a shift away from an emphasis on the spiritual to an exclusive emphasis on the physical, from concerns of the good life to romantic dalliance with death, from spiritual strength to sensual weakness, from the represen- tation of Woman (as seen in Prola) as the Blakean emanation and help- mate of man to the representation of her (as seen in Maya and Vashti) as the Blakean Female Will keeping the worshipping and mindless Adam in her clutches: "Strive not, beloved: I will keep thy soul for thee," Maya sweetly informs the adorine and vacillating Iddy (p. 790).</page><page sequence="23">SHAW IN INDIA 203 Iddy, like his namesake Iddy Toddles the Elderly Gentleman in Back to Methuselah, is fallen Adam, and like the Elderly Gentleman he too is capable of redemption because he can face facts courageously and change when necessary, as he proves at the critical point when Maya disappears. The progressive enlightenment of Iddy in the play may be seen in terms of the journey of the human soul towards recognition of God and his own true self, away from the non-enlightened stage where he is, as the Vedânta-sûtras explain, unable to look through and beyond Mâyâ, which, like a veil, hides from it its true nature. Instead of recognizing itself to be Brahman, it blindly identifies itself with its adjuncts (upâdhi), the fictitious offspring of Mâyâ, and thus looks for its true Self in the body, the sense organs, and the internal organ (manas), i.e. the organ of specific cognition. . . . That stu- dent of the Veda, on the other hand, whose soul has been enlightened by the texts embodying the higher knowledge of Brahman, whom pas- sages such as the great saying, "That are thou," have taught that there is no difference between his true Self and the highest Self, obtains at the moment of death immediate final release, i.e. he withdraws altogether from the influence of Mâyâ, and asserts himself in his true nature, which is nothing else but the absolute highest Brahman.21 Whether Iddy lives or dies after his final speech of great sadness and wisdom is never made explicit. What is certain is that, as in the Elderly Gentleman's in Back to Methuselah, his death as an individual will in no way jeopardize the survival and spiritual enlightenment of the Adamic race of whom he is representative. In this respect, he is the hero of the play.22 Maya and her siblings, in contrast to Iddy, are static and decadent, incapable of change. Their physical health is perfect (p. 796), they have artistic consciences, but "they have not between the whole four of them a scrap of moral conscience" (p. 795). In their exclusively physical per- fection, the "two girl-goddesses" and the "two youthful gods," all "mag- ically beautiful in their Indian dresses, softly brilliant," are a sharp con- trast to the physical and moral handsomeness of Pra and Prola, and a parody of the concept put forward in the Prologue about the various images in the Elephanta caves which represent not different gods, not idols, but various aspects of God, and personifications of the forces of nature by which we all live. The unity that Pra and Prola sense in the various images is echoed in the hideous oneness of the siblings: ". . . they hit out for themselves the idea that they were to be one another" (p. 799), which means that they are equally superficial in their beauty and hollow in substantial worth. That the carefully planned progeny of Pra and Prola can be so utterly devoid of moral conscience is to be pondered on, and perhaps one way of understanding the process may be to con- nect their materialism with that of the majority of middle-class Indians</page><page sequence="24">204 VALLI RAO that Shaw saw in Bombay and elsewhere, the potential inheritors of in- dependence through the efforts of Gandhi who nevertheless, in their materialistic concerns (including the worship of the physical image in the temples), represent the irreligion of idolatry that Gandhi defines as the attempt to "see something through one of the five senses."23 The atmosphere in Act I of The Simpleton is one of disillusionment, beneath the initial references to gods and enchantment, idols and con- secrated ground. This could be seen as Shaw's disillusionment with mod- ern Indian religion, as meaningless as he found contemporary church- going in Britian. The Simpleton could then be seen as a moral fable particularly for Indians, for whom it could deliver a relevant and useful message about the Gandhian heights to which true religion could aspire and, in contrast, the nothingness into which shallow pursuit of the ex- clusively material could plunge mankind. This contrast is hinted at in Hiralal Amritlal Shah's recording of the afternoon when he escorted Shaw to the Jain temples. After their visit to the impressive temples, Shaw invited Shah to accompany him to the next item in his itinerary, a visit to a red-painted bungalow with a crescent mark on the gates. The Shaw couple were to get a reception there, sponsored by the "Three Arts Circle." Chief among its sponsors was a lady called Atiya Begum. When we arrived, we were taken to the terrace at the rear of the house, which commanded a fine view of Bombay and its sea- face. Here tea, drinks and light refreshments were set out on tables, and everyone partook while mingling with music and dances. Enthusiastically, they took us to the in- ner hall, switched off the lights, and let the entertainment begin. It did not take long before I saw that Mr. Shaw had taken out his pocket watch. It was a dull affair, a jumble which reached a low grade in artistic taste, and was exceeding both the time limitations and the patience of the guests. The more the show dragged along, the more Mr. Shaw became restive. He whispered to me that it was 4:30 p.m., and that he wanted to leave for his ship by the early evening ferry. He stood up and told one of his hosts that his time was up and that he had to go, but the host took it rather lightly assuming that, out of cour- tesy, his guest would remain. But Mr. Shaw made straight for the portico, walking fast, his tall figure taking long strides. We had to run after him. We were all rather silent in the car at first, until Mr. Shaw remarked, "There was nothing in that show. Such things and such people are met at every port in every country. My time has been wasted." Beneath the superficial glamor and fine elegance, there is revealed a degree of vapidity and nothingness that is the characteristic of Maya and her companions, and which is in total contrast to the meaningful com- mitment shown in the architecture of the Jain Temples and the Ele- phanta caves, in Pra and Prola, in Gandhi.</page><page sequence="25">SHAW IN INDIA 205 The climax of The Simpleton occurs in Act II of the play, when Maya and her siblings indulge in a hysterical, trance-like worship of war and death (much as the inhabitants oí Heartbreak House do), leading up to a compulsive deification of Prola, which earns them her total contempt. Kanchin. We have made this house a temple. Janga. We have made Prola its goddess. Maya. We have made it a palace. Vashti. A palace for Queen Prola. Kanchin. She shall reign. Janga. For ever and ever.

[pp. 819-29] Idolatry, with all that it implies of laziness, inaction, and irresponsibility,</page><page sequence="26">206 VALLI RAO is shown as having reached a climactic point - a comment relevant to many societies and many religions, which does not decrease its signifi- cance in the context of the modern Indian worship of temple idols as well as of nominal subscription to Gandhi as the spiritual Father of the Nation. Concurrent with this nadir of idolatry is the occurrence of Judg- ment Day, symbolically shown by the appearance of the judging Angel. The Angel is meant to represent the Russian Djerjinsky, the designer of the Cheka, which liquidated people it considered to be not worth their salt to society. The Angel tells his audience, in echo of Jesus's words in the gospel of St. Matthew, "We angels are executing a judgment. The lives which have no use, no meaning, no purpose will fade out. You will have to justify your existence or perish. Only the elect shall survive. . . . The Day of Judgment is not the end of the World, but the end of its childhood and the beginning of its responsible maturity" (p. 825). It is educative, and relevant in the Indian context, to see how Pra and Prola in their maturity take the responsibility of judgment away from the Djerjinskian Angel and towards themselves: they take charge and make it an affair of self-judgment rather than arbitrary judgment by an out- side force, however angelic or otherwise it might appear to be. Towards the end of Act II, Hyering resigns himself passively to the fact that "The angels are weeding the garden. We here are awaiting our own doom." But Prola elaborates on the theme of judgment by the angel, qualifying it so that it gives way to self-judgment: The lives which have no use, no meaning, no purpose, will fade out. We shall have to justify our existences or perish. We shall live under a con- stant sense of that responsibility. If the angels fail us we shall set up tri- bunals of our own from which worthless people will not come out alive. When men no longer fear the judgment of God, they must learn to judge themselves, [p. 835] Pra and Prola judge themselves: Pra. . . . We are awaiting judgment here quite simply as a union of a madwoman with a fool. Prola. Who thought they had created four wonderful children. And who are now brought to judgment and convicted of having created nothing. They discuss the uselessness of the children and Pra sums up: "The coming race will not be like them. Meanwhile we are face to face with the fact that we two have made a precious mess of our job. . . . We are failures. We shall disappear." They recognize, and judge themselves for, the mistake they have made, much as Gandhi recognized and judged himself for his "Himalayan blunder" in 1919, when he blamed himself for the violence that erupted in the wake of the hartal or general strike</page><page sequence="27">SHAW IN INDIA 207 he had called as a protest. He felt he had underrated the forces of evil in Indian society and expected his countrymen to show a strength of nonviolence, self-purification, and prayer of which they proved inca- pable. The self-judgment of Gandhi, and Pra and Prola, is different from the arbitrary external judgment of the Djerjinskian Angel, in that mistake-makers still survive. They do not disappear, as Prola convinces Pra, when she judges herself: I do not feel like that [that she and Pra will disappear]. I feel like the leader of a cavalry charge whose horse has been shot through the head and dropped dead under him. Well, a dead hobby horse is not the end of the world. Remember; we are in the Unexpected Isles; and in the Unexpected Isles all plans fail ... in the Unexpected Isles there is no security; and the future is to those who prefer surprise and wonder to security. I, Prola, shall live and grow because suprise and wonder are the very breath of my being, and routine is death to me. Let every day be a day of wonder for me and I shall not fear the Day of Judgment. [She is interrupted by a roll of thunder]. Be silent: you cannot frighten Prola with stage thunder. The fountain of life is within me. [pp. 839-40] There is a certain sense of humor, and putting things into proper per- spective, in such a speech, and these are qualities, one sometimes feels, that are missing in the world of Stalinist values. No external judgmental force can frighten man's soul as represented in Pra and Prola, and in such people as Gandhi who are capable of self-judgment, but who in the process still ensure that the spirit and the pride of mankind are not broken down, as one suspects they are liable to be in a closed and deter- minist society such as operates in Russia. In The Simpleton, the pervasive Indian influence thus counteracts Shaw's Russian infatuation and makes the play a sensible one, with a serious message to the world, that it should wake up to the folly of idolatry and to the potential power of true religion. I believe it is a Gandhian ideal, rather than a Stalinist ideal, that gives the play's ending the quality of unexpectedness and fearless experimentation that is the characteristic hallmark of the Shavian view of social and spiritual evolution.
