<plain_text><page sequence="1">JUAN CARLOS ONETTTS EL POZO [THE WELL]: AN ACTIVITY OF HESITATION Ciaran Cosgrove Mario Vargas Llosa holds that Juan Carlos Onetti's short novel El pozo [The Welly 1939] heralds the arrival of the modern Latin American novel.1 At first sight the tribute seems hyperbolic. A concatenation of fragments constitutes the visible text. That text invites us to bear onerous witness to the necessary attempts of its first person narrator, Eladio Linacero, to write the story of his life 'because a man ought to write his life story when he becomes forty'.2 Like Dostoyevsky's Notes from Underground (1864) or more recently Ernesto S?bato's novel El t?nel [The Tunnel, 1948], The Well has as its raison d'etre the articulation of the will and the necessity to produce a text. The text that Eladio produces is forever occurring off-stage, as it were: 'I stopped writing in order to turn on the light' (p. 9); 'I re-read what I have just written...I have been writing for hours' (p. 17). The mediated knowledge we have of the half dozen characters who penetrate fitfully into Eladio's ambit is ancillary to, and anticipatory of, the deferred plenitude of textual realisation that never happens in The Well. Seen in this light The Well never transcends its prolegomenal status. Eladio's propensity to narrate prologues must surely emphasise the fact that a critique of teleologies, and particularly of finished narratives, is the primary constitutive feature of The Well. This, and not the characterological portrayal of acerbity, misanthropy and isolation so often focussed on in criticism of this novel,3 is what gives credence to Vargas Llosa's encomium. In the course of this article I propose to examine the ways in which the halting rhythms, metafictive devices and discursive swerves enable possibilities of reading that are not reductive to existentialist or other circumscribed modes. In an interview Roland Barthes comments that 'the fragment breaks up what I would call the smooth finish, the composition, discourse constructed to give a final meaning to what one says, which is the general rule of all past rhetoric,'4 and again, 'the fragment is a spoilsport, discontinuous, establishing a kind of pulverization of sentences, images, thoughts, none of which "takes" definitively'.5 Fragmentation operates at several levels in The Well. The most obvious is the temporal. Broadly speaking, Eladio's psychic bagage is a composite of remembered moments or events (what he calls 'sucesos' [events] which occurred in 'el mundo de los hechos reales' [the world of real happenings]) and fantasies (what he calls 'sue?os' or 'aventuras' [adventures] that may, as in the case of Ana Maria, have analogues in real life). The wider implications of the playing off of fantasy and reality in The Well will need to be returned to. But the consequences of a psychic oscillation between the two and the blurring of the boundaries of each ensure a dislocated narrative flow that disallows temporal continuity. Let us examine some of these aspects of time in the novel before looking at some of the less obvious, though perhaps more significant, manifestations of textual fragmentation.</page><page sequence="2">Juan Carlos Onetti's The Well 7 Eladio Linacero seeks to trap time, make it congeal by dint of repeatable enactments of deed and narrative. The early sections of the novel deal with, first a 'suceso', then an 'aventura', preceded by a prologue, in which Eladio encounters Ana Mar?a. The image-repertoire in which Ana Maria is inscribed is unmistakably sexual. More importantly, it is eternally fixed, given that Ana Maria's death at the age of eighteen years allows Eladio the opportunity to conjure up her presence untrammelled by the corrosive impact of ageing: 'she is still that age when at night she opens the cabin door and runs without making noise, to throw herself on the bed of leaves' (p. 10). Both the 'suceso' which is impregnated with the real life and eternally young presence of Ana Maria and the 'aventura' and its prologue with their naturally (because fantastically) inscribed permanence guarantee a freezing of image and time.6 In like manner, the inference we draw for the failure of Eladio's marriage to Cecilia is that temporal process has corrupted the ideal remembered image of Ceci in a white dress, light of foot, making her way down a windswept street on one summer's night before they got married. Eladio's attempt to 'tender redes y atrapar el pasado y la Ceci de entonces' [lay out nets and catch the past and the Ceci of that time] (p. 27) goes absurdly wrong when he endeavours years later to have that youthful moment re-enacted. To the extent that definitions of a novel's characters are at all possible, it may be said that Eladio is the assemblage of all the frozen narratives and 'aventuras' that constitute him, much in the way that Molina in a more recent Latin American novel may be said to synthesise the heroines of the films he narrates to Valentin in the prison cell.7 It is little wonder, then, that Eladio's hypostatized image-repertoire should make itself felt in a radically disjunctive manner, given that the items of that image-repertoire are not hierarchically ordered and are often whimsically conjured up. Indeed, Eladio's evocation of character and event does not depend on a sequential disposition of episodes at all; rather a somewhat aleatory textual unfolding is in evidence. The structural arrangement of this novel's elements appears then to be unhinged, discontinuous and illustrative of what Stephen Heath in another context has called 'an activity of hesitation'8 or what I should like to call a technique of postponement. This characteristic, with its abrupt consequences of trafficking back and forth from character to character and episode, to episode ensures that our reading of this novel can only be, and at every point, a hesitant one. No sooner is a project decided upon by Eladio than it is shelved and a surrogate project is put in its stead. It is as though the text holds out the promise of a story only to withold it for our future delectation. In the case of the first two related postponements, however, the surrogate narration is given as a supplement of the postponed narration. The former is defined as a prologue. For Eladio, then, no 'aventura' or 'sue?o' is complete without its supplement. A chronic deficiency appears to beset every potential plenitude in his existence. His roommate L?zaro abuses him by calling him 'fracasado' [a failure]. But he is more than that, he is irremediably manqu?, as indeed is the text in which he is inscribed as character. The full resonance of</page><page sequence="3">8 Latin American Literary Review supplementarity needs to be stressed in relation to these two opening postponements. The double-edged significance of the supplement as Derrida has described it is of utmost relevance here: the concept of the supplement...harbours within itself two significations whose cohabitation is as strange as it is necessary. The supplement adds itself, it is a surplus, a plenitude enriching another plenitude, the fullest measure of presence...But the supplement supplements. It adds only to replace. It intervenes or insinuates itself in-the-place-of; if it fills, it is as if one fills a void. If it represents and makes an image, it is by the anterior default of a presence.9 By probing supplementarity in The Well a little further, we arrive at a crucial 'aporia', or textual self-contradiction. Though it appears that Eladio's 'aventuras' supplement the ordinariness of his 'real life', plying it with spicy exoticism, in reality the 'aventuras' themselves are supplemented at least in part, by 'pr?logos' from 'el mundo de los hechos reales'. If the 'aventuras' are insufficient unto themselves, and if real life is always only prolegomenal, then clearly the domains of reality and fantasy, in whatever proportions they occur, are both deficient. Apart from Ana Maria, five other characters weave their way through Eladio's consciousness. They are L?zaro, his room-mate, Hanka, his mistress, Cecilia, his ex-wife, Ester, a prostitute and Cordes, a poet. No one character has a predominant hold over Eladio's attention. Indeed it seems that all are circulating endlessly in a non-hierarchized way in his consciousness. More significantly, he appears incapable of giving full and undivided attention to any one without the 'supplementary' interference of another in his stream of consciousness. No sooner have Cordes and Ester been mentioned for the first time than they are dropped, and an episode with Hanka is narrated. The story of Ester is well under way when there is a sudden 'cut' to the story of his life with Cecilia. There is an equally blunt reversion to Ester as soon as the Cecilia story is terminated: 'I think Cecilia married again and possibly she is happy. I was telling the story about Esther' (p. 28). When we finally imagine we are about to hear about Cordes, we are treated to a lengthy disquisition about the odious L?zaro: 'Pero no quiero dejar de escribir sin contar lo que sucedi? con Cordes. Es muy raro que L?zaro no haya vuelto' [But I don't want to stop writing without telling what happened with Cordes. It is very odd that L?zaro has not come back (p. 30). The endemic digressiveness of Eladio finds its correlative in the textual fragmentariness to which we must now turn. A prevailing figure in The Well is a fragmentary figure par excellence, synecdoche. However, the figure's own rhetorical properties are drastically reduced here. Parts remain parts and do not betoken wholes. The synecdochic vision of Oliver Sacks' 'man who mistook his wife for a hat' has an incongruous, though just, association with the textual realisation of body imagery in The Well:</page><page sequence="4">Juan Carlos Onetti's The Well 9 His eyes would dart from one thing to another, picking up tiny features, individual features, as they had done with my face. A striking brightness, a colour, a shape would arrest his attention and elicit comment?but in no case did he get the scene-as-a-whole. He failed to see the whole, seeing only details, which he spotted like blips on a radar screen. He never entered into relation with the picture as a whole?never faced, so to speak, its physiognomy. He had no sense whatsoever of a landscape or scene.10 For Eladio, a prostitute is remembered by her shoulder and hand: 'I can only see the shoulder reddened by beards that had been rubbing against it, always the same one, never the other one, its skin all red, and I can see the hand with its fine fingers pointing to it' (p. 8). The comfort that Hanka bestows is described in terms of the shoulder: 'she forced me to accept her shoulder as a pillow' (p. 20). Ester's mobile, indeed liquified, arms and legs glide through the tavern as though independent of her body as a whole: los brazos, gruesos y blancos, se dilataban lechosos en la luz del cafet?n, sanos y graciosos, como si al hundirse en la vida hubiera alzado las manos en un gesto desesperado de auxilio, manoteando como los ahogados y los brazos hubieran quedado atr?s, lejos en el tiempo, brazos de muchacha despegados del cuerpo largo nervioso, que ya no exist?a (p. 22). [her arms, thick and milky white, would delate under the light of the little cafe, healthy and graceful, as if when plunging into life she had raised her hands up in a despairing gesture for help, waving like drowning people do and her arms had been left behind lost in time, a young girl's arms unstuck from her long, nervous body, that no longer existed.] The repeated recourse to 'milk' similes when referring to Ester's body further undermines the fixed and solid contours of bodily form: 'her arms and especially her round and powdered shoulders passed in and out through the tables like streams of milk' (p. 24). Ester in front of a mirror is seen by Eladio in terms of head, hair, teeth and shoulders: 'When we arrived her head was soaking wet. She was shaking out her mop of hair in front of the mirror, showing her teeth, without moving her big white shoulders' (p. 28-29). L?zaro's face is a tumult of hair, wrinkles and baggy eyes: 'his wrinkled and hairy face, squinting his eyes between his sparse eyebrows and big bags he has for eyes' (p. 31). But perhaps the most telling indicator of a collapsed world in which Eladio moves as robotic cipher is the way in which Eladio's own bodily parts seem disjunctively 'other' to himself. The smelling of the armpits, the movement of the head and the unwilled growth of the grimace of disgust on his face evoke a scenario wherein autonomy and control have somehow been yielded. The bodily functions appear to be operated from an off-centre control</page><page sequence="5">10 Latin American Literary Review point. And all this is produced in and through a writing the effects of whose syntactical ordering, use of gerunds, adverb, and even assonance demand fastidious attentiveness: Caminaba con las manos atr?s, oyendo golpear las zapatillas en las baldosas, oli?ndome alternativamente cada una de las axilas. Mov?a la cabeza de un lado a otro, aspirando, y esto me hac?a crecer, yo lo sent?a, una mueca de asco en la cara. La barbilla, sin afeitar, me rozaba los hombros (p. 7). [I was pacing up and down with my hands behind my back, hearing my slippers hit the slabs, smelling each of my armpits alternatively. I kept moving my head from side to side, breathing in and out, and this was causing to grow on my face, I could feel it, a grimace of disgust. My unshaven chin was rubbing against my shoulder.] This is a writing which invests the inanimate world of Eladio's room with a vague anthropomorphism (the chairs are 'despatarradas' [legs akimbo]) even as it reduces Eladio to an assemblage of bits and functions. But is it possible that such denudation may be mitigated? As with some of the fine yet harrowing poems of C?sar Vallejo, the dramatization of rupture and loss in The Well is co-terminous with the far from seamless textual fabric itself. To the convolved features of this fabric we must now attend. The use of tenses in The Well is one of the first problematical features a reader is obliged to confront. Given that temporal concerns are considerably foregrounded in this novel this is hardly surprising. But there appears to be a dislocation at work in the usage that serves to disorientate rather than clarify. The dislocation appears to reside in the gap between the narrating present of the first person narrator and the near past. Even though the narrativity of The Well in general is unambiguously conducted from a present vantage point, the opening pages nevertheless make the near past and not the present the site of recall. Indeed, the opening sentence of the novel with a verb in the imperfect tense followed by a verb in the preterite tense, enacting respectively a continuous activity in the past followed by a sudden irruptive action into that continuous activity, suggests a complete absentation from the present: 'Hace un rato me estaba paseando por el cuarto y se me ocurri? de golpe que lo ve?a por primera vez' (p. 7) [I was walking up and down the room a while ago when it suddenly occurred to me that I was seeing it for the first time]. The second sentence by contrast is in the present tense, but, with its limp impersonal verb 'hay' [there are] and its litany of described items, has an autarkic effect that appears to abolish the subject describing. This decrepit room and its contents seem to self-project, as it were. The second paragraph earlier referred to has a predominance of imperfect tense verbs. The bodily activities described by those verbs are so cumulatively insistent that, were it not for an explicit reference to the heat 'now' spreading inside the room or the force of the first person present tense verb 'recuerdo' [I remember] that opens the next paragraph, the fact of present narration would</page><page sequence="6">Juan Carlos Onetti's The Well 11 be obliterated. Even the employment of the verb 'recuerdo' to refer to events that occurred 'hace un rato' [a while ago] suggests a radical discontinuity between moments of time that are near to each other, as though the feat of remembrance in this case were considerable. Paradoxically, Eladio's recollection of an episode with a prostitute which begins in the past tense becomes most vividly realized when he switches suddenly to the present tense, converting the past into a constantly remembered present: 'veo nada m?s que el hombro irritado por las barbas' (p. 8) [I can only see the shoulder reddened by the beards that had been rubbing against it]. From the past made present we then revert to the temporal zone dominant in the opening pages, the near past: 'Despu?s me puse a mirar por la ventana' (p. 8) [Later I started looking out the window]. In the next page or so the pace of intermingling of tenses quickens as if in preparation for a once-and-for-all determination of narrative vantage point. A pivotal sentence which encapsulates present, past and future times is the following: 'Debe haber sido entonces que record? que ma?ana cumplo cuarenta a?os' (p. 8) [It must have been then that I remembered that tomorrow I turn forty]. Here there is a present realization ('debe) of a recent past memory ('haber sido entonces que record?') of a future ('ma?ana')?a future of both that recent past and present?occurrence that paradoxically appears already to be a pervasive present experience 'cumplo cuarenta a?os'. The establishment of the present is, after nearly two pages of text, finally, and somewhat comically, brought into view by a repeated assertion of a material lack: 'I have no cigarettes, I have no cigarettes'. This coincides with the text's speaking, as it were, the hitherto unspoken project of writing that subtends The Well: 'Esto que escribo son mis memorias' [What I am writing here are my memoirs]. Eladio's memoirs are the pretext or, literally, the pre-text, for The Well. And yet the present is not securely established, for, scattered amidst the present reflections on the difficulty of knowing what to include in the memoirs and conditional statements of desire ('me gustar?a escribir'), the near past still insists in a radically unsettling way. It is unsettling because it is to be found in strange juxtaposition with the present: 'I stopped writing to turn on the light and refresh my eyes which were stinging me. It must be the heat (p. 9). The running together of past and present seems to render time meaningless. Similarly, when Eladio narrates the 'Alaska' prologue, indecision characterizes the choice of tenses. The narration begins with the use of the preterite and then slides imperceptibly into the present. But if The Well as a whole may be divided up into narrations of 'pr?logos', 'sucesos', 'aventuras', and finally of Eladio's reflections on what is happening in the now and near past, these last manifest the greatest uncertainty with regard to narrative mode. In the important section that follows the narration of the Ana Mar?a 'aventura' or, even more crucially, in the final section of the novel where the present tense is preponderant, there is a dichotomized time structure, a slippage between now and the near past that is never rectified, leaving Eladio and us the readers to complete a necessary descent down some interstitial black hole. Or, as the text would have it, to be dragged inexorably down the night by the night (p. 41).</page><page sequence="7">12 Latin American Literary Review The fact that The Well purports to be 'about' Eladio Linacero's writing of his memoirs without actually being a facsimile of those memoirs enforces a readerly distance between ourselves and Eladio's project of committing his life to paper. The Well prohibits empathy, not because its protagonist fails to reach the mark in terms of conventionally acceptable behaviour or opinions, but because unmediated access to Eladio's script is blocked. The surrogate text The Well with its disorientating leap-frogging and staccato-like impulses effectively alienates us from the very site of hermeneutical engagement, that is the making sense of Eladio's life. Indeed, The Well*s final issue in an enigmatic sequence of metaphor and symbol, which we shall examine below, determines that the text is ultimately impermeable. It is a cover-up. Like Garc?a M?rquez's novel Chronicle of a Death Foretold (1984) where the chronicle form itself is subverted to cause obfuscation rather than elucidation, The Well leads us inexorably 'noche abajo' [down the nightstream]. But the dark night of The Well is more likely to be the knotty recalcitrance of the text itself, its entangled discourse, its obstructive interpolations. So the metafictive interjections: 'I stopped writing to turn on the light' (p. 9); '(It amuses me to see that I wrote they went down and not we went down)' (p. 10); 'Another warning: I don't know if cabin and hut are synonyms; I don't have a dictionary and much less someone to ask. Since I want to avoid a poor style, I am going to use the two words, alternating them' (p. 14); 'I re-read what I have just written, without paying much attention, because I am afraid of undoing it all. I have been writing for hours and I am pleased because I am not getting tired or bored. I don't know if this is interesting, nor do I care' (p. 17)?perform a ludic function at the reader's expense. The text stalls us as we attempt to penetrate through to the core of Eladio's inner life. By agreeing to read, we agree to be obstructed. The more we involve ourselves with the text of The Well, the more we realize that 'everything is to be disentangled, nothing deciphered.11 The juxtapositions, fractures and ultimate gravitations towards the symbolic mode and away from modes of mimesis and reflection bring The Well within the ambit of the phenomenon Barthes calls 'text'. Associating the 'text' with what he calls 'a liberation of symbolic energy', Barthes, in his essay 'From Work to Text', makes a crucial distinction between the 'work' and the 'text': The work closes on a signified...The text, on the contrary, practises the infinite deferment of the signified, is dilatory; its field is that of the signifier and the signifier must not be conceived of as 'the first stage of meaning', its material vestibule, but, in complete opposition to this, as its deferred action.12 Now, processes of 'deferment' or 'hesitation' have earlier been alluded to. But it is in the long final sequence of The Well that a crucial shift in narrative mode is effected and the 'hesitation' of meaning is given its most striking form. This final sequence signals a drift towards abstraction and the hypostatization of night and time as all-encompassing and personified forces into whose vortices Eladio is subsumed. If Eladio's room was a minimalist space at the</page><page sequence="8">Juan Carlos Onetti's The Well 13 outset of the novel, it is now reduced even further to a white wall whose shadow at night triggers thoughts of 'cosas disparatadas y fant?sticas' [far fetched and fantastical things]. Presence has become whittled away to an encroaching absence. Noise gives way to silence. Water, by no means here a cleansing and purifying element, is metaphorized as a cannibalistic force ingesting the single message of youthful challenge that would have been Eladio's bulwark against the void: There was a message that would launch my youth into life; it was made with words of challenge and trust. The water must have swallowed it as if it were a bottle launched by castaways. The previously happy state of 'an almost absoluete skepticism' in which material wants were satisfied, a book and a cigarette were always at hand and waking dreams ('so?ar despierto') were the imagistic counterblast to the dark has now become superseded by an absolute fragmentariness. A triptych of similes is harnessed to a fractured metaphor of time, and together they describe what life has been reduced to: mi vida no es m?s que el paso de fracciones de tiempo, una y otra, como el ruido de un reloj, el agua que corre, moneda que se cuenta.(p. 40) [my life is no more than the passage of fractions of time, one after another, like the sound of a clock, running water, coins being counted]. The regression to a tabula rasa of primitive, blind and unformed existence redolent of St. Agustine's apopthegmatic reminder that 'inter urinas et faeces nascimur' constitutes the dark subliminal finale of The Well. First person singular gives way uniquely in this novel to a universal first person plural: Todo en la vida es mierda y ahora estamos ciegos en la noche, atentos y sin comprender (p. 40) [Everything in life is shit and now we are blind in the night, attentive and without understanding]. Semantic transgressions and figurai excess are characteristic of these final paragraphs. Sense-impressions are produced in an almost synaesthetic way: the 'pitadas de los vigilantes' [the whistles of the night-watchers] are described as 'sinuosas' [sinuous] ; a 'ruido' [noise] is described as 'breve' [brief]. A clear turn away from realism is effected in the surrealistic evocation of a wrinkle: 'estoy seguro de poder descubrir una arruga justamente en el sitio donde ha gritado una golondrina' [I am sure I can discover a wrinkle precisely in the place where a swallow has cried out]. This swerve from realistic discourse finds its climactic realization in the symbolization of night. First, as a</page><page sequence="9">14 Latin American Literary Review spiritualized entity, night is 'intangible, tense, lengthening its delicate and mysterious soul in the flow from the badly closed tap'; then, as an alienated cosmic force: 'night surrounds me, it fulfills itself like a ritual, gradually, and I have nothing to do with it'. The microcosmic palpitations of Eladio's blood are now conjoined with the macrocosmic heartbeat of the night. Then, in the most cryptically elusive and allusive paragraph of the novel, a pattern of abstract configurations images forth the selfs confrontation with night and death. The calculated flirtation with these dark ultimacies is belied by the easeful symmetry of the first half and gentle oxymoron of the second half of one of the most striking sentences in the whole novel: 'Sonr?o en paz, abro la boca, hago chocar los dientes y muerdo suavemente la noche' [I smile in peace, I open my mouth, I make my teeth grind and I gently bite the night]. This sentence effects the transition to a completely symbolic discursive network. As the novel approaches its end, metaphor and simile combine to produce a harrowing image of Eladio's self-delivery to the waters of death. His attempt to put a stay on the inexorable slippage of night has failed. That attempt is as preposterous as the simile of the large nocturnal butterfly in which it is encased. Such a congealed emblem, like the fixed store of 'sue?os' and 'aventuras', cannot ultimately withstand the centrifugal waters of night. But, once again, it is the disruptive impact of language, in this case metaphor and simile,that compels our attention and drags us down into its embrace: I should have liked to nail the night on to the paper like a large nocturnal butterfly. But, rather, it was she who raised me up in her waters like the livid body of a dead man and drags me alone, inexorably, through the cold and foamy currents, down the night stream. The discursive break with realism at the end of The Well needs to be probed somewhat further. Here is a language of suggestive indeterminacy that captures through extended image concepts of radical isolation, flux and the lived immanence of death (for death in-dwells in Eladio's every summoning gesture from the remembered past of his store of dreams). We have therefore a poeticisation, rather than an explication, of these concepts. The figurai language of these closing passages condenses, as it transmutes, the accumulated narrative of all that has come before. Ernesto S?bato's novel The Tunnel bears an obvious resemblance to The Well, in that its protagonist, Castel, is a misanthropic outsider who is also writing his story. But a more significant textual analogy can be made. A painting, Maternidad, [Maternity], is symbolically pervasive from beginning to end of that novel. Its provenance prior to its realisation through to its final destruction is textualised in a subdued, though persistent, way. It has the supplementary richness of an almost silent sub-plot. Castel's explanation of the painting's origins constitutes one of the most ambiguous, yet important, passages in that novel. What the painting 'represents' seems utterly unconnected to its apparent source of inspiration. The painting 'shows' a large woman in the foreground watching a child playing. The top left hand comer 'shows' a woman on a 'solitary beach'</page><page sequence="10">Juan Carlos Onetti's The Well 15 looking out to sea. The apparent source of inspiration for this painting was Castel's reading, a few days previously, about a concentration camp, where someone who was hungry was obliged to eat a living rat. The lack of correspondence, then, between the painting's provenance and its realisation is stark if, but only if, we expect art to be a mimetic representation of an original impulse or experience. Castel says: Didn't I tell you I don't know what I think? If I could say, using clear words, what I feel, it would be almost like thinking transparently. The desolation of the 'real' episode finds its metamorphosis in an artistic statement that preserves the desolation whilst transmuting the context. At the end of The Well, the imagistic sequence distils, as it transforms into a new discursive register, the fragmented assemblage of mini-narratives already read. But it does more than that. It aspires towards a radical intransitivity whereby the images themselves, in their now idiosyncratic, now shocking, appearance become self-sufficient linguistic clusters, giving force to Alain Robbe-Grillet's dictum that: l'art n'exprime rien que lui-m?me. Il cr?e lui-m?me son propre ?quilibre e...son propre sens'. In truth, it may be said that The Well, far from reaching its conclusion in this final sequence, expires on a prolonged note of ambiguity that is nothing other than a recuperation by other means of the earlier articulations of hesitancy, fragmentation and stasis. In its playing havoc with time and in its subversion of continuity it is well suited to instil distress in the reader whose requirements are those of order, harmony and linear narrative. To some degree, The Well constitutes itself as a critique of such normative requirements. It instances in its very form the provisionality of the segmentation that is the constitution of the art object. By focussing on the most basic and universal experiences of all, Mikhail Bakhtin has described the inherent limitations of quests for beginnings and ends. As conscious human beings, we inhabit the world of the already-happened and somehow miss out on the finale. Origins and teleologies are irredeemably for others: Beginning and end take place in an objective universe for others, but not for the consciousness involved...The absence of a conscious death (death-for-oneself) is as objective a fact as the absence of conscious birth.14 The I-narrative that constitutes The Well can only and always find itself in medias res. The absence of the 'other' voice of, say, an omniscient narrator who could have 'told' Eladio's history from the beginning to the end is more than compensated for by Eladio's internally constructed othernesses, the Ana Mar?a 'suceso' and 'aventura' being the most significant. Eladio's narrative is played out in the interstice beween a congealed past of failed 'sucesos' and a portmanteau of imagined 'aventuras'. In fine, I would argue that the abiding strength of The Well is in its exploration of textual modes of incompletion and</page><page sequence="11">16 Latin American Literary Review difference, and in its ostentatious summoning of our attention to them. Our capacities to interrogate are sharpened by our reading of such a novel, and the limits of interrogation are boundless: The function of art is never to illustrate a truth known in advance, but to give birth to questions not previously formulated.15 University of Dublin NOTES 1Mano Vargas Llosa, 'Primitives and Creators', in Times Literary Supplement, November 14,1968. 2Juan Carlos Onetti, The Well (Argentina, Editorial Calicanto, 1977).
