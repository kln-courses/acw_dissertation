<plain_text><page sequence="1">V.-PESSIMISM. IN offering the followingt remarks on Pessimism, my object is not to advance any new arguments in its support, but only to review that critical survey of the doctrine which has recently been made by an English writer. Pessimism, as is well known, has of late been gaining grounid both in Germany and, elsewhere, and in view of this fact Mr. James Sully has presented us with an examination of the doctrine in a work entitled Pessimism: A History and a Criticismn. Three points in particular have been dwelt upon by him: first, the systematic proof which the doctrine has found in the works of Schopenhauer and Hartinann; secondly, its chance of realisation in the present and future; and lastly, the conditions of its genesis in the individual mind, and the causes of its rapid propagation. Mr. Sully especially attacks the Philosophie des Unbewussten of E. von Hartmann. As this work has not yet been translated into English, it is hardly</page><page sequence="2">Pessimism. 69 possible for English readers to estimate the justice of the charges that Mr. Sully has brought against it; and hence they miay lnot be unwilling to listen to a voice out of the pessimistic camp raised in defence of its leader. To the unreflective mind in the juvenile age of individuals as well as of the race, life in itself is no problem: it is a self- evident thing-that which must be, and cannot help being. But when pain, sickness, lhunger, death appear, then, come doubts and questionings, stirring that feeling of wonder which is destined to become the mother of philosophy. Thus does nmeditation on the misery cof life beget philosophy, while at the same time it prompts the desire to vanquish that misery, as a thing which ought not to be. Mr. Sully in the first four chapters of his work gives an account of the struggles between pessimism and optimism, which will interest many readers. As we approach the present time, we find the voices of unreasoned pessimism swelling in number, while philosophic pessimisni recedes nmore and more into the background. Schopenhauer first fully recognised the claim- of pessinmism to be regarded as an integral part of the systen of philosophy; Mr. Sully, accordingly, next expounds his system.' In relation to -pessimism Dr. Hartmann . may be considered the successor of Schopenhauer, but in respect of the priinciples of his system he can no more be called the successor of Schopen- hauer than of Hegel. All that can be said is, that as every vital system of philosophy must assimilate the main ideas of its predecessor, so Hartmann's is a higher synthesis of Schopen- hauer's 'alogical' will and Hegel's logical idea as attributes of the unconscious spirit. It is an error in Mr.- Sully to class Hartmann with Bahnsen and Frauenstadt as disciples of Schopenhauer 2; while he obscures the metaphysical and psycho- logical proof of pessimism by constantly mixing up the doctrinies of Schopenhauer and Hartmann, the part played by Will in the systems of the two being entirely different. Mr. Sully next gives a short biographical sketch of Hartmnann, with a br'ief analysis of the Philosophy of the Unconscious. In composing, this work Hartmann addressed himself less to the limited circle of professional philosophers, than to the large body of readers, happily still to be found in the " land of thinkers and poets," who are interested in philosophical questions. Partly on this account, and partly as a consequence of the inductive method employed, we find explanations given in the first and 1 Hartmann is Doctor honoris causa of the University of Rostock. 2 It is also an error to .call A. Taubert a disciple of Schopenhauer. Tau- bert's view of the world is based entirely iipon Hartmann's philosophy.</page><page sequence="3">70 Pessimism. second parts of the work which either have a merely pro- paedeutical value or which, though well fitted to elucidate the successive steps of the induction, are seen from the higher levels afterwards reached to be self-evident, not to say, tautological. Now, Mr. Sully, in examining the work, poiints out first these passages which are generally unimportant; and, instead of indi- cating the fundamental principles of the system and the conse- quences drawn from them (the only way to give in a few pages a sufficiently clear exposition of a philosophical system), he follows the successive steps of the induction, sometinmes crowding the contents of a whole- chapter into a single sentence. The result is, to give the reader not only an inadequate, but a decidedly distorted view of Hartmann's great book. Here the historical part of Mr. Sully's work ends. In Chapter VII. he begins the criticism of the metaphysical proof of pes- simism. Like Hartmann-though from a very different motive -he designates the problem of pessimism a eudaemonistic or hedonistic one. As the ethical worth of the world is of account only as it influences the feelings, he shows that hedonism is the only principle whereby we can try the solution of the pessimistic question. Would the non-existence of the world be preferable to its existence? Pessimism, according to Schopenhlauer and Hartmann, follows 4 priori from the nature of Will, as the principle of life. Every act of will refers to something which does not yet exist, else it would not be necessary to will it; and as long as the volition does not procure its satisfaction, there is a state of longing, restlessness. All these terms are of course but similes when the satisfaction of will is an unconsci- ous representation. If a volition can become satisfied, it must be at the cost of another volition, which is proportionately repressed in its sphere of action. In the region of conscious life, whether the aim of will be the mere maintenance of life, or the realisation of an idea, it is at all times eand at all points in collision with other volitions, tending in opposite directions, and those that give way in the struggle react as pain. Schopenhauier was content to deduce the misery of life 4 priori from the principle; but Hartmann, proceeding inductively, offers an a posteriori proof. - Nevertheless, he also has Ihis a priori treatment, and thus, when Mr. Sully attempts to under- mine the metaphysical and psychological bases of German pes- simism, he has to deal with the metaphyAies of both philo- sophers. Metaphysical systems, in Mr. Sully's eyes, are mere outgrowths of poetical fancy, without any claim to a relatively objective truth. He grounds this opinion on the fact that new systems are continually springing up; but he does not see that there is something, common to all, which is ever developing and</page><page sequence="4">Pessiitsm. '71 growing in breadth and depth. Ackno-wledging no objective spirit, he does not understand how philosophy is the develop- ment of the self-consciousness of the Absolute in the multitude of individual minds. The impulse, rooted in the deepest ground of our nature, to inquire after the causae catusarumb, to advance from the phenomenon to the notimenon-this most lofty of the impulses commion to men-is to Mr. Sully a weakness, arid in his optimism he hopes that a time will come when it shall be coni- quered (p. 153), and men will be satisfied with the knowledge sufficient for the practical relations of phenomena to each other. But as long as this impulse, whl-ich Schopenhauer calls the " metaphvsical want," exists in most men, Mr. Sully holds it to be the prinle-task of philosophy.to show that it has no right to exist, since all that we can know is that a gulf yawns between our empirical: world (of subjective representations) and its trans- cendental essence. Now against a dogmatism, which lays claim to the possession of absolute truth, it is clearly open to object on the ground of subjective idealism. Accordingly, when Schopenhauer, notwithstaniding. his idealism, asserts that we are immediately conscious of our will, Mr. Sully does well to point out that we do nlot know our will otherwise than as a repre- sentation-as an object, like our Ego, among other objects. Hartmann, however, in his philosophy is no dogmatist; on the contrary, he ever seeks to combat dogmatism. The critical ground he takes up is indicated in his work New-Kantianisnm, Schopenhanerianism and Hegelianism, while his position re- lative to the different theories of knowledge, especially to Kant's subjective idealism, is shown in his Foundation of Transcendental Realism (1875), and in a criticism of Von Kirchmann's Theory of Perception (1875). We are willing to suppose that Mr. Sully did not know of these works when he wrote the airy sentences on p. 454. From the point of view of subjective idealism metaphysic is an impossibility. If time, space, causation, relation, exis- tence, &amp;c., have as forms of the mind ani exclusively sub- jective ssignification, without being forms of the Ding-an-sich, then of course we neither have the right to construct a world by deduction fron an a priori principle, nor can we hope to reach one by induction. But if subjective idealism is right, and metaphysic an impossibility, then, since all we think is but our thoug,ht, natural science, as it is generally understood, is also impossible as science. For as it is the science of the real, inde- pendent of the subjective, and has nothing but our representa- tions for its objects, natural science can only be the science of hluman modes of thinking and representing. Nay, even such a science becomes questionable, if we follow out subjective idealisn-</page><page sequence="5">72 Pessimism. to its logical conclusion in solipsism and illusionism. If I have the right to suppose a subject-my Ego-behind my represen- tations; if I further have the right to suppose the existence of other subjects, independent of my representations, but analog- ous to my own subject, -then I also have the right to suppose. things-in-themselves behind my representations, as their causal conditions. --Let it be observed, I only say, If I have the right to use Kant's categories transcendentally. Should I assert this right as self-evident, I fall into the dogmatism of naive realism (as the older materialism does); should I deny it, I sink into the hopeless abyss of illusiolnism, or into scepticism, which is also a niegative dogmatism. If, on the contrary, I am convinced that my nature is not a mere colossal hunmbug, whose very existence I can rightly neitfer affirm nor deny, but corresponds to an objective truth, if by the very constitution of my mind I am forced to suppose things-in-themselves behind my representations as their causes, then I stand on the ground of transcendental realism, a doctrine which modern natural science, more or less consciously, accepts. Mr. Sully never tells us what his own theory of knowledge is. Will he doom metaphysics because its constructions are founded on mental representations ? Then the doom must equally fall upon science also, since we never cani travel outside our perception and thoughts, outside our senses. ,On p. 170, Mr. Sully says, " our minds have received their structure in connexion with this very order of things, which is to be accounted for; consequently, all ontological dedulction of the world has to be carried out by help of conceptions drawn from this very world itself." This, however, is far from being a proof that mind cannot acquire any real knowledge; the essential identity of the subject with the object to be known i's the very condition of the possibility of knowledge-and the conditions of the possibility of knowledge form the first principles of all the modern systems of metaphysic. Having pointed out the worthlessness of metaphysic in general, Mr. Sully might have saved himself the trouble of criticising in particular the metaphysical doctrines of Schopenhauer and Hartmann. It is easy to show the contradictions in Schopen- liauer's system, yet, besides the' error above mentioned, Mr. Sully refers only to his obscure scheme of Platonic ideas. He does not mention Schopenhauer's greatest mistake of all-the attenmpt to conmbine materialism with subjective idealism by declaring the intellect to be the product of matter, and matter itself with the entire empirical world to be the product of intellect. Passing next to Hartmann, Mr. Sully finds everywhere can- tradictions and fallacies, which are mainly due to his own mis-</page><page sequence="6">Pessimism. 73 understanding. Whenever Hartmann makes use of a simile to illustrate a difficult conception, he at once lays hold of it as an opportunity of reproaching him for his " mythiological fancies" and " anthropomorphism". When Hartmann, startingo from the con- ception of the world as a process of evolution, and from the relation of the logical idea to the 'alogical' will, arrives at a negative conclusion, namely, the cessation of volition, the end of the world's existence, the reduction of actual beinig to potential being; and when further, after carefully explaining that he by no means thinks of predicting, what will actually happen, he tries to show how an end of the world-process might be conceived,- Mr. Sully takes it all as a positive statement, and ridicules him accordingly. The two chapters in which Mr. Sully undertakes to u;ndermine the scientific basis of pessimism, after haviing, as he believes, overthrown metaphysic in general and the doctrines of Schopen- hauer and Hartmann in particular, present a jumble of sophisin and prejudice, which it would need a whole treatise to unravel. We can here only briefly refer to his way of deniolishing the well-compacted system of the Monism of Will. He seems to believe that a thing or an action has but to be denominated differently to cease to be- what it was. According to -Schopenhauer and Hartmann, all force is will; the atom is a single act of will. Mr. Sully admits that " if force were proved to be a reality in the physical world, we should, by the very limitation of our minds, be compelled to think of it in terms of our volitiois"; but force is " in science proper nothing but a serviceable fiction ". If now, according to Mr. Sully, science does not know force, what then is the ultimate and fundamental phenomenon, of which the whole empirical world is the product ? Mllotion, he replies. But motion can only be understood as the fiunction of a subject. Even supposing it could be empirically shown that the elementary qualities, heat, light, &amp;c., are caused by motion, we should still have to face the questions: Whence these motions? What is their cause, and what are they? The conception of motioin does not dispense with the con- ception of force; there would be no motion if there were no force. Force, whether we call it so, or call it will, is a metaphysical conception, which seems to natural science a somewhat shadowy thing,that might well be excluded from its sphere. And physics is indeed justified in banishing force froin its territory; but the attempt to blot it out of existence is an inroad into a higher sphere, which it is necessary to repel. Mr. I Force as an entity is a fiction, but foree as a phenomenon is thoroughly real, and to Hartmann the act of will is sinmply phenomenal.</page><page sequence="7">74 Pessimism. SuLlly acknowledges no force and hence no will, only consci'oUs volition; but volition, as defined by him, is not genuine will, no real volition. It is only a perception of will, accompanying a mechanical action. This is plainly enouglh stated on p. 202: " The great doctrine of the conservation of energy, carried out to its logical results, has led to the theory of animal and human automatism, namely, that all the actions of our bodily organs, voluntary as well as involuntary, are fully explained as the results of mechanical processes." What stamps certain me- chanical actions of the human organism as acts of volition, different from mere " spontaneous movements " (not a happy expression for a believer in automatism to employ) and from " instinctive impulses," is simply a conscious perception (1) of its motive, (2) of the aim of the-movement, (3) of the character of the action, either as an immediate means to the object in view, or as a link in a chain of means to that object. To be consistent, Mr. Sully should declare volition also to be only a useful fiction, uniless he is prepared to acknowledLge all bodily functions to be acts of will (volition proper). But this is what he cannot do, for, as he truly says, there is no volition without a representation, and he will not adnit unconscious representation. Consciousniess and perception are synonymous to him; while he tries at length to persuade us that there are no unconscious perceptions, with the effect, however, only of showing us that consciousness is not unconscious, and that he has misunderstood Hartmann's concep- tion of unconscious representation as the ideal form/ of real existegice. He even denies the relatively unconscious, that is to say, the consciousness of the different nervous centres within an organism, which is asserted by lartmann in the same sense as by Helmholtz, Maudsley, Lewes, and other men of science. It would perhaps be more consistent to go back at once to Descartes, and deny consciousness altogether to the lower aniimals; for not possessing self-consciousness, they cannot tell us of their consciousness. Hartmann's view of consciousness as springing from the conflict of will seems to Mr. Sully fallacious, but he himself avoids fallacy only by taking the easy course of having no theory of its genesis, and so saving himself the trouble of explaining how a purely spiritual moment, like a conscious representation, can set in motion the bodily mechanism. Without such explanation, it is idle to tell us that the pessimist falls into the blunder of supposing that will is the parent, instead of the natural and necessary foe, of life's misery, inasmuch as it partly crushes, partly satisfies, desire and longing and other unpleasant feelings, at the same time that it directly</page><page sequence="8">Pessimismn. 75 aims at the attainment of pleasure. Just as if pessimists ever doubted tlhat the will makes for pleasure and avoids pain! If each act of will could extort its own satisfaction, the world would be a paradise, and there would be no pessimists. But it is just this satisfaction that is difficult of attainment in a world of conflicting acts of will. We come now to Pleasure and Pain. According to Hartmann, Sensation is a special mr ode of consciousness. Pleasure anld pain, on the physical side, are intensified forms of the specific affections of the different organs; on the mental side, they are ilntensified reactions of will upon representations. Unsatisfied will is pain, whether the accompanying representation is consci- ous or (as in the case of many uncertain and indefinite feelings) unconscious. But unconsciously satisfied will yields no pleasure; it is only when the consciousness is sufficiently established to allow of representations and sensations being compared with each other, that tlhe satisfaction of will becomes known as pleasure, as a higher feeling than mere painlessness, which is the normal state. By this conception of pleasure and pain, Hartmann's doctrine that the difference between the two is merely quantitative, not qualitative, loses much of its apparently paradoxical character. On this point Mr. Sully has unpardon- ably misunderstood Hartmann. He says, p. 120: " Hartmann's account of the manifestations of the Unconscious in pleasure and pain is extremely curious. Pleasures -and pains are perfectly homogeneous states, differing in quantity only !" But Hart- mann says no such thing. What he really says is, that pleasure and pain as such, i.e., apart from their causes and contention, show, each within its own sphere, merely quantita- tive, not qualitative, differences. To understand what pleasure anid pain really are, Mr. Sully refers us to "any respectable text-book in psychology". " Pleasure and pain are found to arise from certain modes of bodily and menthl activity, which are variously defined as those which progiote or hinder function." This, however, is an ex- planation which is only applicable if matter and mind are con- ceived as -one identical substance. From the standpoint of a vague dualistic automatism (pp. 177 and 465), pleasure and pain can be nothing but the signs of approbation and disap- probation on the p-art of the concrete mind, when the latter, in some mysterious way (heaven knows how !), perceives that its seeing, hearing, speaking, and walking maclhine is working smoothly, or the reverse. We are far from denying, and Hartmann himself admits, that pleasure often does accom- pany the promotion, and pain the hindrance, of organic function, but promotion and hindrance are not at all times causes of</page><page sequence="9">76 Pessimism. these feelings. Pleasure may just as well be the cause as the consequent of physical well-being; and if pain is often the offspring of bodily disturbances, it is just as often their parent. Moreover, how is this doctrine to account for the fact that pleasure of a high degree can co-exist with conditions that are destroying health and life ? If in this case the pleasure does not-arise from the satisfaction of a higher will than is in the cells or organs, it is altogether inexplicable. Again, even on Mr. Sully's own supposition, we can establish an evident excess of pain, the very thing that he disputes. The organism is at all tinmes and from all sides exposed to dangerous ilnfluences, both natural and artificial, which hinder and destroy its well-being, and miay even depress it for long periods to a state little above death. The influences that promote physical well-being, on the other hand, have to be looked out for and provided, and after all can do no more than raise life to its normal state. This normal state (which is paralleled, in the case of species, by adaptation to natural conditions in the struggle for existence) is the least we. can get on with, and it is only our familiarity with pain that makes it appear as positively pleasurable. Every attempt to raise the state of well-being beyond the normal point leads again to pain, though perhaps in another sphere, as when certain spiritual pleasures disorder the bodily energy or vice versa. If Mr. Sully thus far, in controverting the pessimistic theory, advances nothing in support of optimism, he is no maore suc- cessful in his strictures upon Hartmann's arguments for the pre- ponderance of paili. Hartmann maintains, (1) that througlh irritation and exhaustion of the nerves pain becomes more and more painful the longer it lasts, while positive pleasure in the like case is lessened and, prompting the will to seek relief; gives rise to a new pain if relief is not found; (2) that satis- faction of will is recognised as pleasure only where the indivi- dual mind is advanced enough to compare the different states of sensation, while the mere fact of unsatisfied will is consciously felt; (3) that the relief which follows a pain constitutes the highest degree of pleasure; (4) that the pleasure of satis- faction is only a- fleetiing one, while the pain of non-satisfaction lasts as long as the effort of volition. Mr. Sully strives to show that the pleasure that follows relief from pain is a real pleasure, and-not mere painlessness. This Hartmann does not doubt, but he holds that, in any general estimate of the value of life according to. the balance of pains or pleasures, the whole amount of such pleasure is not only not sufficient to outweigh pain, but is not even enough to redress the scale. Were there no pain in the. world, there would not be.</page><page sequence="10">Pessimism. 77 any of this negative pleasure; but that it would be a good bargain to get rid of all positive pain at the cost of all such pleasure, will be doubted only by those who would assert that poverty is desirable in order that the rich may enjoy the pleasure of alms- giving. With regard to the first of Hartmanii's arguments for the preponderance of pain, Mr. Sully admits the fact, but finds in it an argument against pessimism, since the iinsensibility pro- duced by nervous exhaustion destroys the pain and diminishes the discontent at the absence of pleasure. Now it is true that there is a certain degree of pain at which insensibility sets in. But terrible suffering must be endured before the nerves are paralysed, while as the field of irritation spreads and new parts are affected, though the first may have become insensible, those last attacked are but just beginning to torment. After all, too, this paiinless exhaustion yields but a short respite: as soon as the nerve has recovered its energy, suffering begins again; or if the complete destruction of certain nerves, or of whole organs, does really bring permanent relief, then it is attended with peril to the existence of the individual. Physicians do not regard the cessation of paini as a favourable syinptom as long as the source of the irritation remains or has become intensified. Il Hartmann's view, although it is hardly possible to deter- mine the equivalence of a certain quantity of pleasure to a certain quantity of pain, yet " the pleasiire must be considerably greater in degree than the pain, if the two are so to counterbalance each other in consciousness as to amount in combination to the state of indifference, and be preferred to this if the pleasure is a little increased or the pain lessened". The true measure of the corn- parative value of pain and pleasure is the readiness with which a pain is accepted for the sake of an antecedenit or succeeding pleasure, or a pleasure sacrificed to avoid such a pain; aild even so there will be all manner of individual differences. Yet the mere possibility of such cornparison implies an habitual endur- ance of pain, for to the naive mind every pain, if it is anticipated with any degree of accuracy, is absolutely great; or if often the opposite seems to be the case, this is due to the careless disre- gard of pain and determined exaggeration of the value of pleasure. So much for pleasure and pain of the same kind: it is a still more difficult matter to furnish a standard of comparison of sensual pleasures or pains with mental pains or pleasures. For here the estimate will vary even inore with differences of character and intelligence. We are not surprised to find Mr. Sully at variance with pessimists on this head also. He acknowledges its difficulty, but hopes to get over it thus: " The siinplest method is to make the antagonistic feelings</page><page sequence="11">78 Pessimism. simultaneous. In this case it will be found that when they are of equal intensity, they tend to neutralise one another, that is, to produce a resultant state of feeling which has a zero-value." Probatum est! It is a pity Mr. Sully does not deal in concrete examples, else we should have liked an illustration. If, again, we turn from pain and pleasure to their causes, we shall find, as a general rule, that the natural and artificial circumstances that are productive of pain are present every- where and at all times, while those productive of an over- balancing pleasure are limited and difficult of attainment; unless indeed we are content to regard the mere painless mnodi- fications of organic sensation as pleasures, as Mr. Sully does with the visual impressions of forrn and colour. As for ennui, on which Schopenhauer laid so much stress as the foe of human well-being, Mr. Sully regards it as only " the penialty inflictel on us for the non-fulfilment of some normal function, or the reminder which is given us by the natural impulse of an organ to discharge its recruited store of energy ". Now certainly ennuti is not in the common sense of the word an external evil, like poverty or sickness; but the circumstances that prevent us from actually removing this removable evil are very often either social or political ones, or are nmaterial organic conditions of our own body which are outside the mind of the individual. Many evils might be annihilated, if we so willed with all our power; unfortunately it only too often happens that we cannot will that which is reasonable and, if not positively pleasurable, at least painless. This troublesomne question of the Nicht-wollen- konnen will, however, meet us again. Meanwhile; let us turn to Mtr. Sully's criticism of Hartmann's a' posteriori proof. First of all, we are told that Hartmann himself " cuts off the surest avenue to the facts " by rejecting " individual testimony as an untrustworthy source of information on the subject," men being disposed " to magnify the value of life througlh the very action of unconscious will ". Mr. Sully here misunderstands Hartmann. The latter simply warns us against a false estimate of the past life, past pains being so readily underrated because they are past; whilst the passing pleasure is greatly magnified. We see this happy gift of the human mind well displayed in the frequent talk of aged people about "the good old times". If it were possible to examine hourly a large number of men as to their actual generalfeeling during a long time, and to put on record the result, Hartmann would have no objection; but the result would be very different from that vielded by the beautified notes of memory. It is only in this sense that. Hartmann attaches a superior value to objective testimony-not from any disposition to make light of the individual's experience.</page><page sequence="12">Pessimism. 79 Ilartmaln's view of the various circumstances of life does not commend itself to Mr. Sully. He gives the list: (1) Health, youth, liberty and material sufficiency; (2) Hunger and love; (3) Pity, friendship and family happiness, (4) Pride, ambition and desire for dominion; (5) Religious edification; (6) Immnoral- ity; (7) Enjoyment of scienice and art; (8) Sleeping and dreaming; (9) Pursuit of wealth; (10) Envy, vexation, &amp;c.; (11) Hope; and then exclaims, What a classification! But, though the reader may expect it, he does not offer a better one. It was, in truth, no part of Hartmann's intention to review all the internal and external circum stances and conditions of life that result in feeling. He held that an a priori proof, based on that of Schopenhauer, but modified at songe points. was quite sufficient for his purpose. Having adopted the inductive method, however, he felt that some amount of 4 posteriori proof was necessary, andso he dipped into the abundant materials at his com- mand, in a way indeed that may seem superficial to the hypercriti- cal. Mr. Suilly especially objects to Hartmann's comprehensive treatment of labour, and to the omission of " motor activity," "genuine humour," and " the daily fulfilments of obligation of all worthy citizens" as sources of happiness " both to the agent and to others ". But, when Hartmann says that labour generally brings more pain than pleasure, he understandgs labour as s tch and apart from the aims whose attainment, or even the mere hope of whose attainment, is or may be pleasurable. When Mr. Sully speaks of labour as a source of happiness, he uleans the aim arrived at. When a workman enjoys his labour, it is the thought that the produce of his toil will protect himself and his family from want, with the hope that a timne may come when he may live without this labour, that is the real source of his enjoyment. It will also satisfy his ambition to see his handiwork sought for and acknowledged, while, if his work is such as to admit of the display of inventive fancy, "the interest of pursuit" (as Mr. Sully rightly suggests) will be satisfied as he realises the ideas of beauty or utility in his works. Work, however, as mere bodily activity, is hardly a source of pleasure. If the physical condition is good, the pleasurable feeling of health is not readily disturbed by it, though even here fatigue is apt to set in towards evening, while in the case of the elderly, the weak, or the sensitive, the fatigue miay even extend itself to the first worling hours of the succeeding day. So to the professional man and the man of business the labour of each day is pleasurable chiefly as satisfying their desire for wealth, self-respect, ambitioni, and vanity, or the loftier sentiments of patriotism, humanity, and love to their fellow-creatures. The case of the agricultural labourer or the factory hand is somewhat</page><page sequence="13">80 Pessimism. different; the pleasure of their daily work being limited to that of winning their daily bread, or, at the best, satisfying their self-respect and vanity. It is only in the field of the fine arts and sciences, and not always even there, that we find, as Hartmann himself is careful to admit, work as such to be a- pleasure. As for that which Mr. Sully sets down as the most important ingredient of happiness, namely, " what is known as mental tone or the underlying sense of well-being," this ought clearly to be reckoned under the head of health, which stands first in Hartmann's classification. Health and the accompanying, feeling of well-being are simply conditions that ought to be, life being, presupposed as necessary, and in general we do not think anything about them until we are deprived of them. Even where they may be deemed as positive pleasures, as in the aimless gambols of children and young animals generally, there is mixed up with them another motive to pleasure, namely, the play of merry fancies, expressed by inarticulate sounds, or nmovenments of the countenance. The equilibrium, however, so essential, to well-being is easily disturbed, so that by the time the julvenile stage is past a feeling of lassitude and heaviness, a residuum of pain in all the organs except those of the special senses, is nearly always present, thougL in so slight a form in the so-called healthful state as to be covered by the manifold impressions of the outer world, anld to emerge into consciousness only dturing moments of reflection and solitude. It is another mistake of Mr. Sully's to suppose that muscular exercise is the source of pleasure in the arduous sports of boys, or in the chase and long pedestrian rambles of grown men. In the case of the former it is the social impulse and the desire of showing strengtlh and adroitniess that give to their games their chief stimuluis and satisfaction. In pedestrian rambles, again, the pleasure does not lie in the inere act of transferring, the weight of the body from one foot to the other throughout a certain space of time, a pleasure which might equally be enjoyed by the recruit in the drill-yard, or the prisoner at the treadmill. The pleasure comes from the change which ramblino brings to sedentary people, living in towns: the farm-servant, who daily walks behind the plouglh, finds his pleasure rather in rest or in simple rural games. As for humour and laughter, no one, certainly no German pessimist, will doubt the value of the power " to transform all the lighter evils of existence into sources of an after-gaiety". Genuine humour, iindeed, is bound up in an especial manner with pessimism, the object of laughter being genierally something that ought not to be. Throuohout the whole range, from the</page><page sequence="14">Pessimism. 81 harmless merry laugh to the scornful laugh of despair, we find the same cause-the incongruity of -a certain realitv with the representation or idea which we or others have of it. And, though it is pleasant to laugh, we generally laugh at somebody's cost, and feel that as pleasure which gives pain to another. If laughter takes its motive from poetry, it falls within the domain of art; and a philosopher with Hartmann's artistic gifts is little likely to undervalue wl-hatever thereto belongs. He only draws the limits of the fine arts more strictly than Mr. Sully does, banishing from their sanctuary those feelings of vanity, amlbition, curiosity, love of the adventurous, &amp;c., &amp;c., which are sometimes imported into them. Mr. Sully has nothiuig to say about Hart- mann's other divisions of hunger and love, of pity and family happiness; the need of concrete treatment becomes too pressing for him there. He censures Hartmann's exaniination of grief and vanity, and with the remark that " the reader is by this time, perhaps, pretty well convinced of the utterly flimsv and meretricious character of Hartmann's examination of hunmn life," he passes on to consider the conditions of happiness in the future. Mr. Sully finds that, in spite of all the efforts of philosophers from Aristotle to H. Spencer, " a systematic science of hedonics has, as yet, no existence," and he aims at supplying the want by " a truly scientific attempt to define happiness and its conditions, and to determine whether the average external circumstances of human life realise these conditions" (p. 263).1 Now at first sight it does certainly seem easier to determine whether a person is happy than to say whether in the samie person's life pleasure has predominated over pain; not becauise happiness is simply " a peculiar compound of pleasure " (p. 279), but because happiness may include a certain amount of pain, without ceasinig to be countea as happiness. According to Mr. Sully, " a wise man" will not aim at single pleasures, but at those fixed anid permanent relations of life which are ever sources of pleasure and safeguards against pain, and which, from being the 1Let uis note, in passing, one piece of inconsistency. When criticising the theory of Schopenhauer and Hartmann that pleasure and pain are the contentment or non-contentment of an act of will, Mr. Sully, it will be remembered, advised his reader (p. 221) to consult any respectable text-book in psychology, to learn that-this theory is fallacious, and that pleasure and pain " arise from certain modes of bodily and mental activity, which are variousiy defined as those which promote or hinder normal function" &amp;c. On- p. 272, however, he has changed his mind, and points out how inadequate this doctrine is to explain the facts of feeling. There is good ground for the hesitation, but Mr. Sully should have remembered this when he previously opposed a theory which not only recognises the truth of the other doctrine within certain limits, but supplies its deficiencies. 6</page><page sequence="15">82 Pessimism. originators of happiness, come to be identified with it. Surveying his mental and physical faculties, he will strive to gain wealth and riches; for the satisfaction of his inner life he will surround himself with friendship and love; and with works. of charity- so far as they do not disturb his personal comfort-he will gratify his sense of pity. He will seek to counteract the bad influences of weather and climate by hardening and training his body, and enlarge his ability to enjoy mental pleasures by the acquisition of knowledge, which extends his mental horizon and improves his artistic skill. He will render his menital life, the sphere of sensations, thoughts and fancies, happy by the power of conseious volition, being careful to exclude all painful and sad representations, whether recollections or anticipations, and to cultivate sweet memories and hopes of a future more and more bright. Nor is it merely the attainment of these ends that is to be called happiness: the very act of striving after tlhem is a source of felicity, since all (?) the varied activities of self-culture and bodily training are pleasurable. Thus, " when all the worst evils of life, sucLh as sickness, bereavement, &amp;c., are averted-when the conditions of large schemes of agreeable activity are present, when the person concerned manifests an habitual pleasurable interet in the events of the world which immediately surrounds him, and when the whole key of life is that of quiet, unfaltering devotion to large, inspiring and yet rational ends, we may be said to have a fairly unambiguous presentation of human lhappiness". '"Observing such a type of existence, we take upon ourselves to assure the person that he is and must (!) be happy ,at moments when he is disposed to doubt the fact." " We ha-ve the fact that happiness has been and is now being realised. By this fact alone the fundamental idea of modern pessimism is amply refuted." So far Mr. Sully, to wllom we would say in reply: The fact that there, are persons, and will -be, at least as long as the development of our earth goes on undisturbed, whose life is to be declared a ,happy one, is not denied by pessimism. But the question with the pessimist is: (1) Has such a happy life really a higher value than pleasureless, but also painless, non- existence? and: (2) If happy life really is preferable to non-existence, what is the proportion of this self-justified existence to that which4 we may call unjustified, as not including a greater amount of pleasure than of pain ? To the philosopher, existence is not more reasonable, has no higher value, than iion-existence; existence can become superior to non-existence olnly by its content. Mr. Sully everywhere conceives life as somethina that ought to be. This no doubt it is to the simple</page><page sequence="16">Pessimism. 83 unreflective mind, from the fact of its being willed. But the point to be settled is, whether this willinct is justifiable. Mr. Sully makes the victory for optimism too easy when he claims the simple normal action of the senses as positive pleasure, and asserts that labour as such brings more pleasure than pain. Self-culture and mental improvement likewise are regarded by him as in themselves pleasurable. And, no doubt, in many cases the victory our reason gains over our instincts or over our bad impulses and habits, is accompanied by a pleasurable feeling of satisfaction; but in other cases the suppression of impulses condemned by reason is- so painful that the succeeding pleasure would be no equivalent for it, if the future consequences were not taken into account. Besides, reason does not always get the victory, having often to be contented with such gains as only vanity can find satisfactory. Notwithstanding this, Mr. Sully conceives the way to happiness as a state of happiness itself, though he has to admit (p. 349) " that the quality of the happiness reached by most of those who are undoubtedly worthy to be called in a sense happy is anything but high if measured by an ideal standard ". The question; then, as to what chance the majority have of securina this modest happiness becomes the more pressing. iMr. Sully allows further that " there are many persons who cannot, by any stretch of probability, be pronounced happy," the fact of suicide, of struggle with want and difficulty, and of sickness everywhere, sufficiently proving this. As one of the hindrances to happiness, he mentions the " gloomy tempera- ment which seems to incapacitate one for accepting any of the cheering gifts of life," and adds, "oftener it is a weakness of active impulse and of will which shuts the person out from' all those fields of interesting occupation which are the sole guarantee of an enduring happiness ". Thus millions of men never have the opportunity of tracing a reasonable plan of happiness, though their heart craves intensely for it; and they struggle painfully to seize it by single unsystematic, and therefore useless, efforts. Now to us it seems quite as great a misfortune to miss the path to happiness, as to have no path at all. Not only are there many who refuse to see the way to happiness, there are also many who will their own misery and with full consciousness tread the path to unhappiness. And what more tragical fate than to be forced by one's inmost nature to struggle for that which to the struggler brings' nothing but pain and destruction ? Mr. Sully takes too superficial a view of the doct-rine of determinism when he says it merely declares " that men will not aim at a thing till they feel the appropriate motives-in other words, till they begin to wish to possess it ". For when the wa;y. which leads to happiness is clearly known, how many obstacles</page><page sequence="17">84 Pessimismn. have to be overcome, how many enemies conquered, before the goal is reached! Even the mere protection against want is not so light a thing as Mr. Sully seems to think. Those who suffer from hunger anid cold in our large towns, and the starving thousands of India, are they all peopjle who did not will to work? Is it the case that the man, whose deepest feelings of love, friendship and trust in mankind are wounded, can seek and find satisfaction and happiness in other directions (p. 353) ? Is sickness, whether of ourselves or those we love, less painful because, as "wise men," we are sure that under given circumstances a certain thing may -or must happen ? Are " the rough street Arab " and " the ragged urchin " (p. 351) really less to be pitied, because in moments, when the stomach does not rebel, the busy world around them makes them forget their miserable condition and the fact tha-t within six hours they will be hungry without the' means to satisfy their hunger ? As regards death, Mr. Sully holds that, so far from being considered an evil, pessimism should laud it as the saviour from life's misery; while the consciouisness of the shortness of life and of the certainty of death, instead of making life less valuable, should really enhance its pleasure, as long as it lasts. To the pessimist, who has learnt to look upon life from a philosophical point of view, his own death is indeed no evil (we say nothing here of the manner of death); the summons to quit the ranks of the great army of sufferers is welcome, if only it does not bring too great sorrow to others. The death of those we love is, however, at all times an evil, even when we comfort ourselves with the thought that tlley are now safe from fate's cruel blows, nor can any pessimistic phrases make it otherwise; while to the optimist, death is an evil xa-r' 6oX4v, whose very thought is the destroyer of every joy. The frivolous and stupid may suicceed in forgetting it, but never the " wise man," in face of the thousandfold renminders that surround him. Turning next to the question of future progress, it is Mr. Sully's opinion that this " is a much more definite and tractable problem than that of the relative amount of happiness and misery co-existing now or at any past period in the world's history ". And " if progress makes for an increase of happiness, it matters but little what are the exact proportions of joy or sorrow in the world at this fleeting point of time. Provided only, happiness be shown to- be possible under certain conditions, the demonastration that the oniward movement of things tends, however slowly, to the fuller realisation of these conditions suffices to redeem the world as a whole from the damning charge of the pessimist." This, however, can only be admitted, if it be proved, first, that the peculiar conglomerate of feeling</page><page sequence="18">Pessimism. 85 which Mr. Sully calls happiness, seems to an intellectual mind really preferable to the insensible state of non-existence; and, secondly, that what we call progress really acts in the supposed direction. But this Mr. Sully has not succeeded in proving. What makes his " wise man " an especially happy man is his bondage to illusions, his light-mindedness, which in spite of all present disappointments lulls him' again and again in the flattering hopes of a better future, and his never-ceasing impulse to action, which prevents him from self-reflection. But if the man in question is really a wise man, sooner or later the moment of disillusion will come, and it will then be of no use to assure him, as Mr. Sully does, that' he is and must be happy. To meet this contingency, Mr. Sully can only suggest a sustained faith in a happier world to come, or, failing that, at least in a happier future of posterity.' It is this future that we will now for a little consider. Historical progress is but one aspect of progress in nature generally. The idea of evolution, long since adopted in philosophy, has become familiar in natural science, especially through the labours of Mr. Darwin and his theory of natural selection. It is not for us here to judge how far this theory, as a mere mechanical principle, is able to account for the origin of species. Suffice it to say that modern philosophy, with Hartmann at its head, acknowledges the fact of the progressive influence of natural selection Now in man evolution seems to be limited to a higher development of the brain and a finer construction of the nervous system. This improvement is the correlative of a higher intellect, a superior mind, which is the true mainspring of historical progress. Were history determined by the natural passions only, there would be nothing new under the sun; all progress depends on an increase in intelligence, producing new motives to which the lower passions attach themselves. It is not, however, the case, as Mr. Sully seems to think, that the operation of natural selection within the mental sphere tends to make the process of evolution at all less cruel. When the earliest prehistoric races overcame their animal kindred, from which as yet they differed but little, by greater versatility and shrewdness, or when they fought among themselves with teeth and fists, the pain of defeat in such rude struggles was no greater than now when we fight with lead and iron or the arts of diplomacy, or when by superior industry one nation compasses the ruin of another. The extinction of one species by another more prolific does not seem to have been attended by more suffering than is involved in the rivalry of races, even though the doomed race is allowed slowly to starve according to peaceful treaty and amid assurances of the kindest</page><page sequence="19">86 Pessimism. regard- for its true welfare. Such thing,s will continue as long as the evolution of nature and mind goes on. The tearing teeth give way to the persuasive tongue and the skilful pen; the bare fist and the stone-weapon are replaced by gun and rifle, and these in their turn may give place to the votes of an international congress. But in every case those who succumb must suffer, though the pain may be transferred almost entirely from the physical to the mental sphere. Individuals or races are evermore acquiring a predominant intellectual influence over others, and a two-fold suffering is the natural result. The exercise of power is repressed in the superior few by the multitude of inferiors, while these find it troublesome and dangerous. Thus both sides are supplied with motives for a struggle, which is none the less a real struggle for existence, -because its objects are ideas. The sympathy and benevolence referred to by Mr. Sully (p. 387) cannot and will not prevent this struggle; at the best they will only serve to heal the wounds which it has caused. All that humanity joined to prudence can do, is to alleviate and limit existing evils,; and it is only when benevolence has ceased, because there is no sphere for its activity, that we can say that a positive step has been taken towards general happiness. According to Hartmann, the actioni even of the best form of government is but of a negative character. Mr. Sully, on his side, would credit the state of the future with unlimited powers, including even the checking of over-population. Now many states have indeed tried to restrain pauperism by putting obstacles in the way of matri mony, but the result has always been the same-the. multipli- cation of illegitimate births and prostitution. Or, if men should become so prudent as to restrain their sexual impulses from a regard to their own comfort, and from pity for the generations to come, then the process of training for such wisdom would certainly be a severe one, and what would be gained in ease from family cares would be dearly paid for by the pain resulting from the suppression of instinct. While, if the very instinct of generation could by a " scientific mind " be supposed eradicated, who can appreciate the effect upon the relation of the sexes-a relation from whose soil have sprung the most venomous thorns but also the sweetest blossoms of happiness, and which has supplied the most stirring inotives to human activity ? No doubt, knowledge' is expanding in all directions, and with the increase of knowledge of nature there is an increase of our power over it. But hitherto all positive increase of general wealth has had the character of a robbing of nature, and a time will come when the productiveness of the whole earth can no more be increased. Nevertheless, pessimists do not deny that</page><page sequence="20">Pessimism. 87 increase of knowledge, directly as well as indirectly, tends to lessen and even remove many evils, and Hartmann, in particular, joins with his pessimism a political and social optimism that seems quite beyond the comprehension of Mr. Sully. It is generally admitted that epidemics may be prevented, or, where they already exist, may be confined within narrower limits by a more rational sanitary policy and improved medical art, while many diseases may be made wholly to disappear by proper physical training and the discovery of new remedies. Yet as long as the doom of death lasts, sickness and infirmity with its attendant sufferings will go before. Hartmann does not question the progress of the medical art, but only doubts w-hether it can keep up with the rapid increase of the more comple.x nervous diseases, and of that sensibility which causes slight disturbances of the normal functions to be more acutely felt than were greater disturbances in the earlier stagges of man's existence, in consequence of the finer nervous organisation which is the condition of higher intelligence. The future will doubtless heal many wouinds which now seem incurable. Even the social question will some day find a solution, though no one dare say whether it will be by gentle or by violent means. But the great sources of suffering will still abide in the future, for the reason that they spring from the very conditions of life. In fact, just in proportion as the different evils arising from passing social and political conditions are found to vanish, will the fact become more and more evident that life itself is the worst foe of happiness. Even if Mfr. Sully had succeeded in provingt that in the far-off future those existences that we call happy will become the majority, the,fundamental idea of pessimism would still be far from being refuted. Should it be the doom of organic creation to perish by a general refrigeration, surely the sun total of pain arising from the pressure of more and more unfavourable climatic conditions on the animal and vegetable kingdoms would be infiniitely greater than during the period of improving conditions; for with every backward movement a developed consciousness would have to be repressed. And, even if the cooling of our globe were to cease at the stage most favourable to human life and progress, the existence of a happy race during an indefinite future would tell against pessimism only on the suLpposition that the happy humanity of the future and the suffering humanity of the past and the present are one and the same. This is the idea ilvolved in the ' panlogism ' or ' panthelism ' of Hartmann, but has no place of right in the materialistic automatism and will-dualism of Mr. Sully. If there is no absolute unconscious spirit as the entity common to all the separate conscious minds,</page><page sequence="21">88 Pessimism. the distant future is absolutely nothing to me of the present; it is only -what I myself suffer or enjoy that can incline me to pessimism or optimism. After me may come the deluge or the millenium, but it is a matter of indifference to me, if my Ego is a mere cerebral phenomenon, the product of an aggregation of -mere material atoms. We will not follow Mr. Sully in his inquiry into the internal and external sources of pessimism and the causes of its rapid dissemination, but only note that he has too intelligent and keen an eye for natural, political and social shortcomings to throw himself unreservedly into the arms of optimism. He considers that, according to, the side from which they are regarded, the facts may land us either in optimism or pessimism. In this we agree witlh him, but not when he goes on to say that the main source of pessimism is an abnormal sensitiveness to pain, and that pessimism itself is to be regarded in a large measure as a pathological phenomenon, which will cease to exist when the medical science of the future shall succeed in overcoming the peculiarities of temperament in which it is rooted (p. 444). With certain limitations this may be true in cases of unreasoned pessimism- VWeltschmerz, but not of philoso- phical pessimism, which, uninfluenced by subjective feelings, rests exclusively on objective observation, and counts individual sensation as an object among other objects. Whatever can in this way be alleged against pessimism, can with equal force be alleged against optimism, and there is no reason why defects of tenperament should be easier to eliminate in the one case than. in the other, Nor is the attempt to hold the balance betweeni optimism and pessimism that most worthy of " the man of philo- sophic mind " (p. 463); it should rather be to find the synthesis of both. . To the eye of cool reason the world seems as good as possible because it is a real logical proce-ss; in the eudaemonistic point of view, it is worse than no world, because the path whereon the logos strides from victory to victory is a path of suffering to the creature. So far as lthe " how " and the " what " of the world is. concerned, Mr. Sully's own. " meliorism " does not differ from Hartmann's social and political optimism; but if meliorisrn includes the hope that the future will justify the fact that a world exists, it merely illustrates what Hartmann calls " the third stage of illusion". We may finally remark, in thus closing our long criticism of a "{criticism," thatit is not because they have to pay high taxes, or to do military, service for their country, nor yet from any humiliating consciousness of the superiority of Frenchl civilisation and luxury, that so many Germans confess to Hartmann's pessimism;</page><page sequence="22">Philosophy in the United States. 89 but because a time of material prosperity and of fulfilment of national hopes and wishes is a fit time to show how small an influence a little more or a little less of luck in external conditions can have on the value of life. And, if we have suc- ceeded in convincing some readers that German. pessimism has not been quiite annihilated by Mr. Sully, and that it might still be worth their while to study its true meaning in the works of Schopenhauer and Hartmann, our labour has not been in vain. 0. PLUMACHER. NOTE.-It is impossible to explain such remarks as those which Mr. Sully has thought fit to make on Hartmann's style and method at pp. 454-7, except on the assumption that he has a rooted prejudice against the great Ger-man thinker. They could hardly have been penned if Hart- mann's works had already (by translation) become generally known. In dealing with the opponents of Hartmann, his taste in the matter of style is somewhat less delicate, else he would hardly call the flat witticisms of J. C. Fischer "pleasantly satirical," and find the attack of a certain Dr. Stiebeling " rather effective " (p. 204). He does indeed speak of an anonymous work, Das Unbewusste vom Standpvunkt der Physiologie und Deseendenztheorie (1872), as "a much more thoughtful demonstration of the untenability of Hartmann's biological assumptions " ; but he evidently little suspected what was to be revealed in a second edition (1877), that this work, whose truly scientific character wvas fully recognised in Germany, was the production of none other than Hartmann himself ! Hartmann has thus given unmistakeable proof of being.no mere layman in natural science; and , in particular, he has shown that it was from no ignoran-ce of what the mechanical principle of Darwinism is able to evplain that he felt hilmlself bound to reject it in part, and to declare the necessity of adopting instead a spiritualistic teleological principle, to which the other is but as means to end.</page></plain_text>
