<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Demiurgic Imagination In Art and Experience Stephen Crites According to the so-called cosmogonic myth, the world of our experience took shape when a craftsmanly god, such as the demiourgos (artificer, craftsman) of Plato's Timaeus, gave form to primordial chaos. I am referring, of course, to the myth of creation we find with many vari- ations throughout the ancient Near East, and even turning up inde- pendently but recognizably in geographically remote cultures. There are other types of creation myth, but this one in particular has enough reso- nance in human experience that we need not be surprised to find people inventing or discovering it afresh. One of the things that is so handsome about this myth is that it exemplifies the very process it describes. It tells a story, and such storytell- ing is one of the prime devices through which our world of experience is constituted. In this sense it is a myth about the myth-making process itself. Telling a story about giving form to the chaos is in fact an act by which the chaos is given form. But that is a point to which we will return. First I would like to offer an interpretation of the myth. I have no idea whether this interpre- 295</page><page sequence="2">tation is original. I don't suppose I can have made it up myself, and anyhow originality is cause for suspicion in interpreting a myth. For me, at any rate, the interpretation presented itself a few semesters ago in con- versation with a student of lively intelligence named Deborah Malamud. A student like Debbie can get a teacher to saying things he never thought he thought or knew he knew. So as we were thinking out loud together, I found myself explaining that the prosaic name for the primal chaos out of which the gods formed the world is: the future. I was surprised to hear myself saying that, because the myth seems to present the primal chaos as a kind of ultimate past. It was there first, and then in some sort of sequence came the shaping and forming that produced a cosmos. But that is an inversion that is characteristic of myth, and is essentially a concession to narrative form. It is a matter of per- spective. If one stands outside a story, as a hearer who grasps it from beginning to end as a completed whole, the beginning necessarily appears as a specious past for all that follows. But from the point of view of a character in the story, such as our demiourgos, what he is to make or to do presents itself first as "in the future." The beginning, that is, of the thing that is in the making or in the doing, is that peculiar state in which it is not yet made or done at all, but is still unformed, just as our myth suggests. It is still, as we say, "in the future." For so it is with any event in our experience. Its future is what comes first, its beginning, when it does not yet exist. In our naive experience, the thing or event seems gradually to gather itself together and take shape as it moves "toward" us, as we say, "out of the future." It has been suggested to me that a photograph taken by an instamatic camera provides a good image (though not an instance) of this process: as we watch the exposed print it first appears a muddy- colored blank, in which the picture that has just been taken gradually takes clearer and clearer shape before our eyes. Just so, an object of experience materializes out of the inchoate blank of the future, becoming determinate as it moves into our present, which is the instant of its vivid reality, so full of presence that we hardly know what to make of it. Typically, we can only give it a name, classify, understand, explain it, as it recedes again-into the past, taking its place among the familiar furniture of an articulated world. Now we who are experiencing it are not in fact so passive as this description suggests, but we will come to that point present- ly. In my naive sense of myself as a fixed, positioned consciousness, things seem to approach and recede from me in this manner, steadily taking form out of their inchoate futurity as they do. Augustine adopts this naive standpoint for the moment when he says that the mind (anima) "antici- pates and attends and remembers, so that what it anticipates passes through what it attends into what it remembers" (Confessions XlI:xxviii). 296</page><page sequence="3">It is the same, according to our myth, with the cosmos itself. In the beginning it is purely future, unformed, still a chaos and not yet a cosmos at all. So the demiourgos, or the spirit brooding over those waters, in Genesis I, must have regarded it. Then it began to take form, but only gradually, usually in quite definite stages such as the six days recounted in that first chapter of Genesis. By and by it actually exists, in its pristine freshness when the Creator in Genesis pronounces it good; but then, alas, it gradually recedes into the past. For the real movement of that story, like all stories, is from the future into the past. The story itself, of course, is a thing made. Once it is made it is past. Even that myth that represents all making, the cosmogony, must present the whole process as something that happened once upon a time. But what it represents as the beginning, which in truth is the beginning of every thing, presents itself in experience as the yet unmade. It is a myth of the myth-making process, including the making of this myth, because it is the myth of all making and of all experiencing. The movement is from the indeterminate future through the living present into the determinate past. Such, too, is the movement of world-making, from the point of view of the demiourgos, the craftsman, who makes it. But we must remind ourselves of what we remarked about the experiencing subject generally: the demiourgos is not in fact passive in this process. He it is who wrestles and shapes a cosmos out of the chaotic future. This prodigious activity is precisely what we mean by the present, in all making and experiencing. It is the critical pass between fluid possi- bility and the definiteness of things made. Your own activity is always present in this sense, and in your act of making or experiencing something you form yourself afresh as well, emerging from the struggle along with it, still wet with the future. In our myth this critical pass is occupied by a god, who pulls and moulds everything, makers and all, out of that fluidity into a cosmos. And when he lets it go it sinks, a thing made, into the past. For to be past is to be part of a nameable, classifiable environ- ment. It is still in flux in the sense that what has been given one meaning can be reinterpreted, can be placed in a new context of meaning, or simply reassessed through hindsight; an old ailment gets a new diagnosis, a differ- ent physics is applied to the physical objects we've lived with all our lives, a hoary classic yields up new secrets, a marriage turns out to be the beginning of big troubles rather than the end of small ones. A new inter- pretation of the past comes to us, like everything new, out of the future. Still, for all this hermeneutical relativity, with the past it is a matter of reinterpreting or even discovering something already there to be pondered, and usually already understood in a certain way. When things have sunk into the past we are able to discriminate, say, between human beings, articles of furniture, animals, works of art, gods, and so forth. But I do not in this sense know exactly what I shall be contend- ing with in the future. A horizon of possibility appears, not a world of 297</page><page sequence="4">things, for only what is actual is definite. No doubt that horizon of possi- bility contains a play of powers, among which I may find myself: or more precisely, among which I may gather together something that I shall identify as myself. The "1" that will emerge will not be in simple identity with the "1" that enters the contention, indeed it may be constrained to identify itself, as well as the other things with which it contends, quite differently than it does now. For they will not be the same, and neither will I. Even that past with which I identify myself may thereby require a new interpretation. It is not merely, as we say, that "things" will "change," an ex- pression that seems merely to attribute to definite items collected out of the past some capacity to alter their condition or situation while remaining essentially what they were. That common-sense view, in which one can recognize the echo of a traditional metaphysics, offers a plausible enough approximation of what seems to happen a good deal of the time. For a certain ontic inertia perpetuates, for instance, the physical structure of the past, placing at least temporary limits on what can take shape out of the future. As things continue to slip into the past they may resemble those things we have known before, giving us the comfortable illusion that they haven't changed much. More important for our purposes is the fact that human activity has a momentum that projects it into the future, either in the effort to change what is or in the effort to give what will be a shape to which we are already accustomed. We scheme and plan and shore up, and to the extent we succeed we impose the structure of pastness on what is coming to be. But these projects are not often a total success; even when the state of affairs that emerges is the direct result of our activities it is not generally quite what we had in mind when we launched the project. In any case the ordinary way of speaking about things changing does not prepare us to confront a future ventilated with possibility. For in the future as such there are neither tables nor hens nor human beings nor gods, as we know them. In the future are the mighty deeps and all- devouring Leviathan, the sheer formless energy of existence. It is the water that nourishes all that is, in which all that now exists will perish, or undergo a sea-change, or a purifying baptism. What "1" shall be, I who articulate the order of my environment by addressing and naming and classifying and thinking it over, this "I" will itself emerge anew from the play of powers in that still unformed future, and will have to think again! That is more or less what Debbie and I pieced out between us in considering the cosmogonic myth a few semesters ago.1 I Now the "world" to which I wish to apply this interpretation of the cosmogonic myth is specifically the world of our experience, the world that is formed imaginatively, through language, through visual con- 298</page><page sequence="5">structions, through patterns of sound, and the like. That may seem inclu- sive enough. But there is no doubt a silence that precedes all speech and remains independent of it, a molecular and galactic silence constituted by the sheer, dense thatness of things, which we can perhaps abstractly con- ceive but cannot experience. To this silence we can attribute neither time nor eternity. Human beings, on the other hand, inhabit the world linguisti- cally, imaginatively, and can experience only what they have the imagi- native resources to form. We experience actively: we do not merely hear, but listen; we do not merely see, but look at. Looking and listening, speaking and thinking (inner speech), we carry on all our conscious deal- ings with things, and our own conscious lives are ventilated by imagination through and through. Yet imaginative beings are not altogether porous. They too have their densities, their opacities. I refer not only to our physiological densi- ties, that we must haul about from place to place, but those densities that are formed by the temporal tensions of our demiurgic experiencing itself, between past and future, which gives rise to the tenses of language. Language, for instance, constitutes its own silence within and among those who speak, the silences of the not-spoken, the secrets that are kept pre- cisely in speech. But that would be the subject of another lecture. I mention it here only to forestall the misunderstanding that what is imaginatively formed has simple transparency, and can be manipulated at will. There are necessities, and also common decencies, to which the demiurge must submit. What I wish primarily to suggest, however, is that the demiurgic imagination functions in parallel ways, through employment of the same formal media, in art as in experience. To speak of imagination is to think first of all of those artificers among us we call artists. But the exercise of imagination in literary or graphic or musical composition is rooted in the way we experience, represents in fact a refinement of the formal qualities integral to experience itself. The human significance of art depends on that parallel. For the influence of the two is bilateral. The demiurgic activity of experiencing is the common human source of every work of art, and the cultural significance of art consists not only in presenting us with purified objects of experience but also in expanding and refining the imaginative resources of ordinary experience. In an effort, however, to clarify this parallel and this bilateral influence, I want to present, and then expound, a general thesis on the aesthetics of experience: We do not undergo experience; experiencing is neither passive nor instantaneous. In every formation of experience the imagination actively strives to achieve a unity of form and content, and a correlation of subject and object, akin to that of a work of art. This imaginative activity, further- more, is positioned by the practical activity in which the subject engages as a socially constituted organism in a particular cultural situation. 299</page><page sequence="6">That is the thesis. Now a bit of commentary: Unity of Form and Content-The imagination strives to give the sensory and emotional contents of experience an aesthetic shape in which they will achieve coherency. We do not usually notice how active imagi- nation is in the formation of experience, just because its demiurgic energy is so integral to the process; just as we do not notice our eyes when we see, precisely because we could not see anything without them. But without this prodigious activity there would be no experience at all, but only what James called the "whirling, buzzing confusion" of sights and sounds and feelings etc. The process of experiencing perhaps typically begins in that confusion, and that is why it often takes awhile to give it shape, through making a story of it, for instance, or a clear enough visual image to lodge it in memory. Sometimes we need others to help us complete the experience, for instance through telling them our story. For we do not generally experience anything all at once, nor is our experiencing sorted out into atomically discrete "experiences." The imagination, demiurgic, must stead- ily tend its garden, weeding, watering, staking, letting things grow together at their own pace. For the imagination does not necessarily impose a ready-made form on the confusion. It lets what is given in experience take whatever shape it has the resources to find in it. In every coherent formation that takes shape there is a fresh synthesis of form and content that renders the form and content inseparable, a whole: the content exists only in this form; the form, in its full articulation, is peculiar to this content, though it may belong to a general type. As in a completed work of art, the form and the content come into concrete existence together, and until they do the form is only an abstract adumbration, the content an indistinct fluidity. Correlation of Subject and Object-The subject and object of experience also take form together, in what phenomenologists call an intentional act. Only in this synthesis is either the experiencing or the experienced concrete and whole, the conscious subject of just this object, the formed object of just this experiencing subject. This synthesis, too, is a work of imagination, at heart the same work of imagination in which form and content coalesce. For that coalescence constitutes precisely the object of the experience for this subject, in which subjective affect or feeling diffuses its tone through what is given to the senses. The subject for which just this object exists is also formed by its experience of that object, the person or persons involved becoming changed in the experience. The shape "1" give my experience also reshapes this "1." Approximation to the Work of Art-Since experience does not take form all at once, since it achieves completeness only to the extent that imagination achieves the synthesis we have described, it seldom, indeed, succeeds in completing this act of unification entirely. A successful work of art, or a ritual act, achieves this completeness to an extent rarely possible in the more volatile medium of experience. Only occasionally, in a 30(</page><page sequence="7">kind of ecstasy, does experience become transparent and fully formed. But when we summon the energy to experience a work of art we enjoy that same ecstatic transparency, which is also available in a religious liturgy for those who can enter it fully. That is why the ritual or the work of art is so satisfying: not because it is entirely different from the sort of synthesis for which we strive in experience, but precisely because it does so fully satisfy that same striving. The rite or the work of art is an ideal paradigm of experience, in which, indeed, demiurgic anthropos, weary in his struggles with the recalcitrant stuff of experience, finds rest, and illumination for his task. Action and Experience-We are positioned toward experience by our active projects, or more generally by our life-activity. The agent of the act becomes the subject of experience as well, of the particular sort of experience toward which his act positions him. The mode of praxis in a well-defined social situation not only situates experience, but also mobil- izes the particular imaginative resources that yield any particular synthesis of experience. That is why people in different social situations will not only experience different things, but will experience them differently. A typical bank clerk and a revolutionary activist will not even experience the same scene in the same way. So much for systematic exposition of our thesis. In many ways it is not new, but there would be no point in tracing its lineage in post- Kantian continental philosophy. The basic demiurgic model, in fact, seems to me to be implicit in the ancient cosmogonic myth itself. Rightly under- stood! But by way of bringing out what is distinctive in it we might briefly contrast it with another model, also a hardy perennial, namely the realistic or mimetic model, which is also a model of both art and experience. There does tend in general to be a rough correlation between theories of art and theories of experience, even if the one does not logically imply the other. The mimetic theory of art, for instance, is generally persuasive to people who hold realistic or mimetic views of experience. In this view, experience registers a kind of mental copy of what is really already there, in the world, independent of experience. In the terms we have established, the real world stands forth in a state of pastness, already articulated into beads, bottles, boulders, bosoms, and boards, and we make mental copies of them, either spontaneously or with some labor. Present experience registers the pastness of the world. The relation is in fact generally con- ceived to be causal: what is, already sorted out into the many things in the mode of pastness, causes our experience of it. To conceive things this way is already to consider that relations among them are causal, and the experi- encing subject is actually one of those discrete things, so that his experi- ence will consist in mental images caused by other things. 301</page><page sequence="8">Now this so-called realistic view of experience is at least con- gruent with a realistic aesthetic or a mimetic theory of art, and proceeds from similar premises, so it is not surprising that they often go together. Representational painting, on this theory, "re-presents" what has already presented itself, in the mode of pastness, in nature. The realistic novel attempts to reproduce concrete social relations as they actually exist, often with a strong underlying assumption of causal determinism, rooting social relations in quasi-"natural" relations governing the material con- ditions of life and the social class relations resulting from their production and exchange. Here the "present" of the writer or artist conveys to "future" readers or viewers the pastness of real things as they exist, in their causal relations. But even that present and future are really modes of pastness, as causal consequences necessarily following from what has been. I think it would not be difficult to suggest a similar congruence between expressivist theories of art and idealistic theories of experience. Only in that case the past and future would be specious modes of that presentness constituted by the inner state of the experiencing subject or the artist. Something like this correlation has in fact been revived in recent years under the appropriate banner of "Nowism." Of course aesthetic theories are one thing and what artists in fact do is another, even if an artist himself understands what he is doing in terms of one or another aesthetic theory. A realistic novelist, for instance, might intend to be reconstructing, in words, the material pastness of a concrete social situation, in its causal relations. But I do not think that is in fact what he is doing at all. His work is an exercise of the demiurgic imagination in spite of his intentions: wresting a particular image of the past, articulated on certain assumptions about social dynamics, out of the great void of the future. For whatever its relation may be to what has been, it is an account of the past that has never existed before. III Now the demiourgos has got to begin his work by establishing the great frame within which his universe of order can be formed, and such framing is also a fundamental necessity of the demiurgic.imagination generally. Only for us mortals the frame is an enclosure that sets some- thing apart from everything else: from all those totalizing systems in which the past predetermines the future. The cause and effect system of the physical world, for instance, and the economic sy.stem of supply and demand, and the eternal circles of family conflict, and so on. These sys- tems seem perfectly global, encompassing everything a person has got to understand to get on in the world: they seem to contain the whole world, in the mode of pastness. But a frame creates a crack or fissure in that world of pastness, setting its contents apart from all that sound and fury. What exists within 302</page><page sequence="9">the frame constitutes its own little microcosmic system, with all its elements related integrally to one another and essentially to nothing else in the great world outside. Kant speaks of a work of art as being character- ized by Zweckma'ssigkeit ohne Zweck, that is as having an interior tele- ology, a self-contained purpose in itself, not determined either by theoreti- cal constructions or by practical aims in the great world outside. Presenting something inside the frame signals this interior teleology to the beholder: don't expect what goes on in here to behave as if it were part of the plenary system outside. It is something special. But the frame does not merely enclose. Its much more important function, which the enclosure serves, is to create the opening of which we have spoken. The frame does not enclose in order to seal its contents in, but on the contrary in order to provide an unobstructed space through which they can pass out into the world of our experience. The frame, after all, is open front and back. Something pours through it that is precisely not subject, say, to covering-law models of universal reiteration.2 So there is a paradox in this matter of framing: we keep what is framed free of the plenary space and time outside, not just to amuse ourselves with it, but in order to gain fresh purchase on our experience in the great world outside. We suspend the pastness of the plenary space and time, the better to occupy the world of experience in a manner that is illuminated and disciplined by our concentration within the frame. That may be especially evident in the case of the sort of framing that takes place in religious rites and disciplines, to which I will refer presently. But works of art function that way as well, whether we expect them to or not. I will want to claim that we employ the device of framing in experience itself, furthermore, in a way that is susceptible to the influence of these more artfully constructed frames. For the frame makes precisely that opening in the totalizing circle of pastness through which the demiurgic imagination pulls, wrestles, and shapes the great void of the future. Through this passageway into the void, typified by the untouched canvas or the blank piece of paper in the typewriter or the empty stage, demiourgos conjures the unseen powers of the fluid deeps into visible form. But now I must get my speculative enthusiasm under control a little, to try more soberly to explain this phenomenon of framing. Sitting in the choir loft of a Sunday morning, as is my habit, with my mind wandering a little, which also happens, I could not help noticing how carefully framed the service is, in time and space. When my mind does not wander I am too thoroughly inside the frame to notice: all the more evidence of how sturdy the frame really is. I should mention, too, that this particular church is of the Yankee Congregationalist sort, not one of your temples of high liturgy. No clouds of incense fill the sacred space, no ancient rite inscribed in black leather organizes the sacred time, no eunuch prances before the sacred altar. Yankees worship their maker with the 303</page><page sequence="10">same grave informality with which they address their pot roast. Religion, after all, is supposed to be of a piece with Real Life. Yet our puritan determination to purge all nonsense has not succeeded in introducing so much as a crack in that frame. We try. Our young minister opens the service with a hearty, Good Morning! as if he were hailing us in front of the post office. But we do not respond by nodding, waving, or saying "H'are ya." No. The congregation intones the echo of his very words, in unison! We do other strange things. We in the choir parade up and down the aisles with our hymn books, wearing black bags from which only our extremities protrude. At regular intervals, and on signal, everybody stands and sings in full-throated chorus; for we are an enthusiastic congregation. At regular intervals, and on signal, we bow our heads in silence, each member of the congregation joined with the others only through the ears, by the unseen tissue of the minister's voice. Throughout that hour we indulge in behavior that would seem quite mad in any other place or during any other hour of the week. For that hour is set apart; everything that happens then is framed. Our critics, and our own clerical scolds, are often heard to com- plain that we do not behave the rest of the week as we do on Sunday mornings. There can be a serious point in that complaint, but taken literal- ly it is pretty silly. If we did break into psalms and such when our paths chance to cross in the supermarket, we'd have to do something else on Sunday morning-if they didn't lock us up first! This phenomenon of framing, at any rate, besides being universal in religious observances, public and private, is one of the things religious rites share with the arts. To speak of frames, in fact, is first of all to think of paintings. The frame of a painting is integral to it as a work of art, in a sense that has nothing to do with whether the frame is plain or ornate, gilded or black. For the painting stands forth as a work of art only by being demarcated by clear boundaries. It differs from the play of color and form that exists everywhere in our environment because of this deliberate act of placing a frame around it, or choosing to paint within a frame. This space is different, not part of the plenary space of the universe at large, and to look at the painting is to concentrate our attention purely on this plane, as if nothing else existed, for its tensions and dynamics are internal- ly related. The time of our attention to it, furthermore, is detached from our other times as the painting is from all other spaces, as detached and as complete in itself. With a piece of music, on the other hand, the framing is primarily temporal, and only incidentally spatial. Like the temporality of the paint- ing, the space of the piece of music is relative to those attending to it. Still, the music can generally be listened to only within a limited space, and even within that space it is set off in our attention from all the extraneous sounds, coughing, cars going by, that are within earshot. We hear all these sounds, but we do not listen to them, for even when they do intrude into 304</page><page sequence="11">the physical space in which the music is heard they do not share its aesthetic space. We filter out the infernal coughing and rustling of pro- grams, letting the piece form its own space in our attention. But this spatial dimension is subordinated, in music, to the temporal one, and really is constituted by it. Within the twenty-five minutes, say, that elapse in the ordinary time the piece takes up, there is a unique temporality formed by the piece itself. This temporal frame is generally both harmonic and melodic, enclosing both a synchronic tonality and a diachronic suc- cession of pitched sounds, rhythmically arranged, that begin and end. Framed off from the normal tempo of social life, the temporality of the piece is intrinsically related to its harmony, melody, and rhythm, but only incidentally related to the twenty-five minutes. Cosmic, organic, social time left to recede to the periphery of our attention, we keep time to the music. Those examples may be sufficient both to suggest the general significance of framing in religion and the arts, and also to suggest that the frame is differently constituted according to the nature of the medium in question. It would not be difficult to extend our analysis to stories, to drama, to poems and other literary texts, in each case making the relevant distinctions in the way the frame is formed. It is worth mentioning that religious usages share with works of art not only the phenomenon of framing, but also the same aesthetic forms that are employed within the frame, formalized movements, music, narrative, lyric, and so on. That is my special professional interest in the matter, as a philosopher of religion, but I won't elaborate on its strictly religious implications here. In general I'd say simply that from a formal standpoint there is no difference between the arts and the religious employment of the same media, but there is a difference in the mode of participation. In a religious act the participant enters bodily into the frame: his movements, his voice, his physical presence, are incorporated into the very medium. For those who are under the sacred canopy the narrative will express a myth or scriptural story linking his life to the acts of the gods, the dramatic form will be employed in its liturgical re-enactment, the visual representation will be a holy icon, and so forth. People pray to icons, not to paintings. However that may be, I want finally to suggest, consonant with the general thesis of this lecture, that the phenomenon of framing functions in ordinary experience, as well as in religion and the arts. Experi- ence does not transpire in an undifferentiated and boundless cosmic soup. In fact, an entirely unframed experience is unimaginable. Until an event in your life achieves some servicable frame you do not yet experience it at all. That is why, when things seem unsettled and chaotic, the imagination struggles to provide the frame, sometimes trying one and then another, to bring what is happening into some aesthetic coherence. The frame is seldom quite so clearly delineated, or the aesthetic forms within it so refined, as in liturgies or works of art. But we do insist on seeing and 305</page><page sequence="12">hearing quite highly organized spaces and times, and daily life is full of little rituals. We see what we can bring into the organized visual frame of our attention, leaving many things out or relegating them to the periphery of our vision. Similarly with our lived time: the confusing flow is full of episodes, long and short, that we may experience as having quite definite beginnings, middles and ends. Just how confining this framing activity may be will depend, really, on our aesthetic resources. It is a question of the most fundamental moral consequence. For the frame, spatial, temporal, or linguistic, is the enclosure in which demiourgos struggles with the fluid energies of the future. If he can do no more than try to impose the familiar forms of pastness on them, he will at best succeed only in damming up their mighty onrush until they break through and overwhelm him. But if he can summon the originality to let these energies assume forms that are answer- able to their own demands, he will be performing his true task. To do so, however, he must also have the courage to face great risks to his own sense of identity. The artist, I think, and also the prophet, takes these risks. In this sense he presents us with an ideal model of experience itself, of rich complexity and yet completed and whole, a model of genuine beauty and sacred possibility at the roots of experience itself. To speak of beauty and sacred possibility in this way may lead to misunderstanding. What appears in the frame may not be pretty. What takes shape may be ugly or horrify- ing, a Guernica or a terrible fairy tale or a crucifix, and the frame may force us to look at it steadily rather than turning our eyes away as we usually do. Precisely the formal intensification induced by the frame gives the imagination the resources for grasping the terrible rather than evading it, and that too may open experience to its sacred sources. For the frame suspends the pastness of routine flux and flow in the social environment with which we busy ourselves. It introduces a break in that routineness, opens up a kind of aesthetic black hole in the pastness of our tight little cosmos. We peer into this hole, or even disappear into it for a while, like Alice down the rabbit hole, and what we find there is not necessarily either pretty or empty. As the example of Alice suggests, we may find ourselves in a region of wonder, in which the latent psychic content of the world we live in is placed in the foreground, full of playful- ness and terror. Upon our return out of this particular frame we may find even the pastness of the world transformed, and ourselves with it. For the frame is the passageway of revelation from the un- bounded future. It does not necessarily provide you with some discursive truths you can write down in your notebook-which is in any case a fairly trivial notion of revelation. Rather, the formal purity that is achieved in the frame in-forms the imaginative structuring of experience generally, giving it the elasticity to cope with the powers of possibility with which 306</page><page sequence="13">the future confronts it. To end this lecture with a snappy slogan: We enclose in order to disclose. Wesleyan University NOTES I think the Plato of the Timaeus understood all this, but there are at least apparent differences between his classic interpretation of the cosmogonic myth and the one sketched here, and it may help clarify the intent of our interpretation to comment a little on the most important of these apparent differences. We have adopted his name for the god who occupies the eritical position which, in our rendering, is always the present. But Plato introduces a playful ambiguity into the portrayal of his demiourgos: he is certainly a god, yet he is engagingly anthropomorphic, in some ways even more so than the classical Olympians. He is the very image of the busy craftsman, with a job he can scarcely manage. With his eye cocked on the eternal archetypes, the demiurge moulds and shapes the formless stuff into their very imperfect copy, which is the cosmos of our experience. But he can never quite get the stuff to conform to the archetypes. It keeps squirting out or slopping over, and things seem in constant need of repair. The job is endless, the task of the perpetual present. What Plato's rendering of the myth does not seem to accommodate is the possibility that the demiurge, who does the shaping, must himself con- stantly emerge from the watery flux in order to sustain his hold on the present. The demiurge, after all, is a god, not only immortal but essentially unchanged by his activity, in spite of being otherwise so human. Also, the fact that the god has a kind of blueprint before him in conducting his handicraft, namely the eternal forms or ideas, gives the impression that the god is steadily imposing a kind of ideal pastness on things as they emerge from the chaos. Still, Plato's rendering of the myth does splendidly bring out the es- sentially active role of the demiurge. The eternal ideas merely subsist, while he has the job of contending with the chaos, by prodigious labor moulding the recalcitrant elements into some semblance of order. Furthermore, I think it would not be difficult to show that Plato intended us to understand that we are ethically and aesthetically the imitators of the demiurge, that indeed we share the task of the great artificer, for instance in the ethical shaping of our personal lives and in the political shaping of our shared social life. For with us, at least, Plato is clear that the shaper also needs reshaping: that we who give such form as we can to the chaos are ourselves of its very stuff, our lives a constant emergence from a great formlessness. However it may be with the demiurge himself, that is the paradoxical situation of his child, the demiurgic anthropos. 2 That is why I found point-missing the suggestion of some colleagues with whom I discussed this notion of framing, that the frame ought to be broken, or open on one side. In that case, "nature" abhorring a vacuum, the frame would simply be inundated with that plenary space it is designed to hold at bay. There is indeed always the danger that our making and experiencing will be so clogged by that stale and fetid smog that nothing fresh can pass through it. The frame is needed in order to keep the opening clear. An innocent in the literary-critical wars, I had not been aware of the minefield I was passing through in this lecture. The term, "framing," in parti- 307</page><page sequence="14">cular turned out to be a particularly active mine. I had forgotten about its use by an earlier generation of critics, who seem to me, however, to have drawn quite different implications from it. Much more relevant to my use of the term, I discover, is that of Erving Goffman in Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (New York: Harpers, 1974), which I had unfortunately not yet read when I prepared this lecture. 5 Y M I O J.
