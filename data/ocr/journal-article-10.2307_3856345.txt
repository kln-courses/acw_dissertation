<plain_text><page sequence="1">(57) SENENU, HIGH PRIEST OF AMUN AT DEIR EL-BAHRI By EDWARD BROVARSKI THIS publication of the Oriental Institute stela 8798 owes much to the labours of two scholars, the late T. G. Allen, who transcribed the stela after its arrival in Chicago, and Dr. John A. Wilson, whose translation and textual notes made in 1925 have been an invaluable aid in restoring the lacunae in the text.I Of white limestone, the stela was broken in nine pieces which measured io5 cm. in height when fitted together and approximately 74 cm. in width (fig. i). The figures of the owner of the stela, his wife, daughter, and the attendant priests are in raised relief, as are the wdat-eyes at the top of the stela. The hieroglyphic legends are in sunk relief. In sunk relief also is the peculiar device of which only the bottom half survives in the space before Senenu's face. What remains suggests the standard or perch used for carrying religious symbols and the figures or emblems of the gods (Sign List RI2). While I know of no specific parallel to this feature, it is possible that a figure of Wepwawet or Anubis stood or reclined on the standard. The stela of Senenu came to the Oriental Institute from the Egypt Exploration Fund. On page 26 of the Catalogue of the Exhibition . . . of the Egypt Exploration Fund for I906, the stela is mentioned as having been found at Deir el-Bahri during the excavations of 1892-6. Senenu bore the high-ranking titles of High Priest of Amun and Hathor in Dsr-dsrw, Hatshepsut's mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri, and that of High Priest Amun in Hjr-ht (the identi- fication of which will be discussed at some length below). If the official is the same High Priest of Amun in HIr-;ht, Sn(n)w, cited by Helck, Materialien, Teil I, 875 (93), as seems likely, at least the lower portion of the Oriental Institute stela which bears that title was seen by Carter in the magazines of the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1899 and was later copied by Sethe. At the top of the same page, Helck draws attention to a High Priest of Amun in Dsr-dsrw and Scribe of Recruits, Snnw. Actually, this citation is a conflation of the titles of two different officials of the Eighteenth Dynasty who bore that name and whose monuments are in the Louvre. The Senenu of Louvre C. I40/ 141/42 (= N 291) is King's Scribe, Scribe of the Army, and Scribe of Recruits.2 The I I would like to thank Dr. Wilson for his permission to use his notes which are kept on permanent file in the Oriental Institute Museum Office, and for his encouragement in my study of this badly damaged but interesting monument. I would also like to express my gratitude to Drs. Edward F. Wente and William Kelly Simpson for reading the manuscript of this article and for their many helpful suggestions, and to Dr. George R. Hughes for discussions and help in the course of its writing. Special thanks are due to Miss Mary Cairns for her patience in typing the manuscript. 2 Pierret, Recueil d'inscriptions inedites du Muse'e du Louvre, II, 31. I have excellent photographs of this Senenu's monument which consists of the two jambs and lintel of a stone portal. At the bottom of both jambs</page><page sequence="2">EDWARD BROVARSKI owner of Louvre E 6.244, however, is a High Priest of Amun in Dsr-dsrw named Snnw and the piece is cited by Pierret,3 as a 'bas-relief en pierre calcaire d'Abydos'. Since it is not drawn and its provenience is given by Pierret as Abydos, only after a photo- graph of Louvre E 6.244 (pl. XI, 2), kindly provided by Mme Christiane Desroches- Noblecourt, arrived in Chicago was it apparent that the Louvre piece was the fragment missing from the gap in the lower right-hand corner of the Oriental Institute stela. The upper parts of the figures of the priests on the Louvre fragment join the lower parts of the figures on the Oriental Institute stela, while the top two lines of the latter com- plete lines 15 and i6 of the former and add a few more signs to the badly damaged line 14. The last two lines of the Louvre fragment add nothing more to the main text but provide a caption to the scene of the four phyles of priests below (pl. XI, A). Since the provenience of the Oriental Institute fragments of the stela of Senenu is well documented and is confirmed by Senenu's own titles, it can only be assumed that Pierret's information was unreliable and that the Louvre fragment likewise derives from Deir el-Bahri. Since the second volume of Pierret's work dates from i878, suggesting that Louvre E 6.244 had been acquired some time before that year, it is, perhaps, not too precipitous to suggest that the piece derived from one of Mariette's three seasons of excavations at Deir el-Bahri in the years 1858, 1862, and i866.4 Some years ago, Grapow5 collected examples of speeches of the deceased on several monuments of the New Kingdom. What was striking in the speeches was not their content, but their presentation and formulation. All had a common form composed of two clauses: one with ir wnn (in the orthography of one of the monuments ir wn), a protasis, and the other, an apodosis with futuristic sense or meaning.6 In two of Grapow's examples, the protasis after ir wnn consisted of an adverbial nominal clause ir wnn ;hw hr ;h 'if souls are transformed' and, in his other examples, of an impersonal sdm.f of the verb ;h, ir wnn h'ztw 'if one is transformed'. In essence, the latter is the form of the clauses of condition on the stela of Senenu. When this construction was used on Grapow's monuments, it was followed by a clause of cause, for example, ir wnn htztw hr irt m] rt: 'If one is transformed because of acting justly (my ba shall follow Osiris, etc.).' Unfortunately, the clause of cause is missing in every instance on the stela of Senenu and only in line 3 is ;h4tw hr preserved to assure us that the other instances on the stela are probably to be restored similarly. Both the speeches on Senenu's stela and those on the monuments published by Grapow contain brief paraphrases of the chapter headings of chapters 78, 8i, 83, and 86 of the Book of the Dead, the 'Chapters of Making Transformations' that begin with are kneeling figures with the inscription: 'It was his son who caused his name to live, the Scribe of the Army of the Lord of the Two Lands, S3-Imn.' The same man appears together with his father on a stela of the latter in the Bologna Museum (Silvio Curto, L'Egitto Antico, pls. 25, 41) where Senenu has, in addition to the titles 'King's Scribe, Scribe of the Army, and Scribe of Recruits', as on the Louvre monument, the title 'First Reporter of the King (whm nswt tpy)'. My thanks to Dr. William Kelly Simpson for this last reference. 3 Pierret, op. cit., 31. 4 Edouard Naville, The Temple of Deir el Bahari: Introductory Memoir (London, I894), 6. 5 'igyptische Jenseitswunsche in Spruchen ungew6hnlicher Fassung aus dem Neuen Reich', ZAS 77 (I942), 57-78. 6 Ibid. 57-8. 58</page><page sequence="3">SENENU, HIGH PRIEST OF AMUJN chapter 76 and end with chapter 88.7 To give an example, the heading to chapter 8I reads 'A spell for assuming the form of a lotus'.8 On the stela of Senenu line 5 reads 'My soul shall assume the form of a lotus', and adds 'which appears on the pure land', a phrase borrowed from chapter I74.9 It is clear from this example that the different redactors of these New Kingdom monuments chose their phrases from the funerary papyri at random. No two of the speeches are literally identical though a number of clauses recur and at least one clause on the stela of Senenu is paralleled elsewhere only on one of the monuments included in the study by Grapow.o1 WinlockI" noted a similar situation in regard to the hymn to the Sun-god on stelophorous statues of the New Kingdom. The hymn was not of set phraseology, like our hymns, but one in which the Egyptian felt free to give his fancy rein in improvisation. While copy after copy of the hymn gives us the same underlying theme, and even many recurring phrases, each scribe was at liberty to arrange it after his own taste. The same principles are discernible in the formulation of the speeches on the stela of Senenu and on Grapow's monuments. Translation I.

Commentary (a) The presence of the third-person feminine singular suffix pronoun in the phrase di-s rnh wis nb n nb t&amp;zwy Mn-hpr-rr is peculiar. To whom does it refer? It is possible that in the stela's original emplacement a figure of a goddess, carved or painted, stood to either side, and it was she who offered life and dominion to Tuthmosis. Another explanation presents itself, however: the feminine suffix may refer to the wdat-eyes in the centre of the lunette. I know of no specific parallel for this feature, where the eyes, being more than a symbol of the god Horus, seem to function as a deity in their own right, giving life to the king. However, on a Middle Kingdom stela in Zagreb (see Janine 6o</page><page sequence="5">SENENU, HIGH PRIEST OF AMUN Monnet Saleh, Les Antiquities egyptiennes de Zagreb, 15, fig. 4) the symbols of the West and East are provided with arms and proffer a cup to the wd3t-eyes in the centre of the lunette. Beside the head of the princess on the block statue of Sn-n-mwt and Nfrw-rr in Berlin (no. 2296) is an interesting portrayal of the goddess Nekhbet. The wings of the vulture are outstretched in the gesture of pro- tection and embrace, but the body of the goddess is replaced by a wd&amp;t-eye (G. Roeder, Aegyptische Inschriften aus den staatlichen Museen zu Berlin, nI, 35 - Urk. Iv, 406; cf. it. Drioton, 'Deux cryptogrammes de Senenmout', ASAE 38 [1938], 23i-46). Similarly, the representations on a cartonnage coffin in Berlin (no. 8505; ibid. 444, 448, 450, 452) provide the single wd4t-eye with a pair of wings or two contraposed eyes with a single wing each, as on another coffin (no. 28; ibid. 443) where the wings are provided with pendant uraei. In similar fashion, a single wd3t-eye replaces one of the wings of the Behdetite on a number of stelae of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties in Cairo (Lacau, Steles du Nouvel Empire, I, plates, passim). (b) H. Ranke, PN I, 310, 2I. (c) The presence of i3rw 'reeds' (Wb. I, 32, 5), at the beginning of line 2, suggests that we had a phrase in lines I-2 that originally ended with Sht-i3rw 'the Field of Reeds' (Wb. I, 32, 6-7). The stela of P;-hry (Urk. Iv, II6, I3) and that of Sn-m-irh (Urk. IV, 499, i) contain the sentence 'Your heart will be happy ploughing in your plot (sd) of the Field of Reeds', while another common locution on stelae of the Eighteenth Dynasty (see Hermann, Die Stelen der Thebanischen Felsgrdber der I8. Dynastie, 21, I3; 25, 9; 51, 3-4) reads 'He shall ferry over in the ferry-boat of the necropolis to the islands of the Field of Reeds'. Both these sentences are too lengthy to fit the lacuna in line i, however. The words in Grapow's Speech 9, 'I shall be summoned to partake of offerings in the Field of Reeds' (Grapow, op. cit. 65) seem to provide the simplest solution, though the sentence, to my knowledge, occurs on no other monument of the Eighteenth Dynasty, while the clause of cause in the same speech fits the resultant gap after ir wnn 4h'tw hr on Senenu's stela. (d) Chapter 78 of the Book of the Dead is the 'Chapter of assuming the form of a divine falcon' (Budge, The Papyrus of Ani, I54). (e) The phrase dr n-k sdbw nb r tl does not occur in chapter 78 of the Book of the Dead. It does occur on the stelae of P?-hry (Urk. Iv, II7, 0o) and Sn-m-irh (Urk. iv, 499, I9) already referred to above. The restoration is that of Dr. Wilson and seems to me a good one, though in no other instance does the phrase appear to be used of the divine falcon. Also possible is a clause found in chapter 130 of the Book of the Dead, dr-n-sn ih mr mn-n'f 'for whom suffering and illness is driven away when he is sick' (Naville, TB ii, I39). In chapter I30 the expression is used of Osiris, but the restoration of either alternative in line 2 of Senenu's stela leaves room for another short phrase at the end of the same line. (f) The apodosis in lines 3-4 is almost literally paralleled by that in Grapow's speech 2 and I have restored the lacuna accordingly: CG 34057: © A[] , 1 ORINST 8798: 12.tl []// ///11111111111//1111/1111111111111111111 CG 34057: u --~ ^ S n ORINST 8798: &amp;" S _ c .m ' . " M Book of the Dead chapter 86 is 'A spell for assuming the form of a swallow' (T. G. Allen, The Egyptian Book of the Dead: Documents in the Oriental Institute Museum at the University of Chicago, I62). The qualifying phrase 'of the God's Land' to my knowledge only occurs here. 'God's land' is used often of Punt (e.g. Urk. iv, 322, 7; 334, 6), as is probably the case here, given the following 6i</page><page sequence="6">EDWARD BROVARSKI mention of myrrh trees, but it can also be applied to Asia (e.g. Urk. IV, 775, I5; Petrie, Six Temples, pi. xii, line I7). Hatshepsut brought back thirty-one myrrh trees (nhwt nt rntyw) from Punt to be planted in the gardens of Amun and great heaps of red incense to be burned before the god (Naville, Deir el Bahari, III, pls. 78-82). (For a recent discussion of African incense trees see F. Nigel Hepper, 'Arabian and African Frankincense Trees', JEA 55 (I969), 66-72.) The mention of incense trees (nhwt nt rntyw) on the stela of Senenu, a contemporary of Tuthmosis III and Hatshepsut (see below), and on the Cairo stela of Neferhotep, a possible contemporary of Senenu, is the more interesting as other and contemporary stelae, while often asserting that the ba of the deceased shall sit (hms) or stroll (swtwt) under, or alight upon (shn) or, most commonly, refresh oneself (skbb) under trees (see Grapow, op. cit. 71; Hermann, Stelen, 22, i6; 31, i6; 38, I6; 52, 10; 56, 2; Urk. IV, 73, 8; 918, 8; 1064, 8; etc.; Save-S6derbergh, Einige Agyptische Denkmdler in Schweden, Abb. 2 (Stockholm no. 55), use only the word nhwt, 'trees', in general (Wb. II, 282, 16-283, I-2) or mnw, a word for 'trees' common from the Middle Kingdom (Wb. II, 71, I3-I6). Unfortunately, the context here and on Cairo 34057 is obscured by a word, damaged on the stela of Senenu but preserved as kfd on Cairo 34057. Grapow (op. cit. 71), finding no parallel for the verb, suggested an emendation to hfd 'to sit' (Wb. III, 75, IO-I2), but the suggestion is rendered even more doubtful by the presence of a tall damaged vertical sign on the Chicago stela, while the hand (Sign List D46) on the Cairo stela is replaced by the arm with the hand holding a stick (Sign List D40) on the latter. I have no solution to suggest, and until a parallel text with clearer orthography is found, the word must remain un- translated. Note also the use of the different prepositions on Cairo 34057 and Orinst 8798; the former uses hr 'under the incense trees' while the latter has hr 'on the incense trees'. Of the examples just cited, Stockholm no. 55 and Hermann, Stelen, 52, IO; 56, 2 have skbb-i hr-hrw nhwti 'I shall refresh myself under my trees'. For the compound preposition hr-hrw, which may represent the original preposition used in the phrase on Cairo 34057 and Orinst 8798, see Wb. III, 392, I2. (g) One would expect a recurrence of the protatic clause ir wnn ;hftw hr etc., here, since, at least in line 6 and, probably, in line 2, iw b;'i r etc. follows this construction as apodosis. The lacuna is not sufficient, however, to allow space for the clause Snnw; dd-f, preceded by one of Senenu's titles, which in every other instance precedes the protatic clause. (h) Chapter 8I of the Book of the Dead is 'A spell for assuming the form of a lotus'. In the text following the chapter heading, however, 'I am the pure lotus' is modified by the clause 'which cam forth (pr) from the sunshine and is at the nose of Re and at the nose of Hathor' (see Allen, The Egyptian Book of the Dead, I56). The wb . . . which is preserved after 'My soul shall assume the form of a lotus' in line 5 of our stela precludes the possibility that this modifying phrase followed. (i) The title before m Dsr-dsrw is completely lost. The space approximates to that occupied by Senenu's title of hm-ntr tpy n 7mn m Dsr-dsrw in line I and it is possible that here Senenu was assigned the title of high priest of one of the other gods resident in Deir el-Bahri: Re&lt; (E. Naville, Deir el Bahari, I, pls. i and viii), Anubis (ibid. ii, pls. xxxi-xlv), or the divine ka of Tuthmosis I (ibid. v, pl. cxxix) or of Hatshepsut herself (ibid. v, pls. cvii-cxvi). For further information on the cult of Tuthmosis I and Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri, see H. E. Winlock, 'Notes on the Reburial of Tuthmosis I', JEA 15 (I929), 56-67. See below for a discussion of known personnel of the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri. (j) Preserved at the beginning of line 7 is the god determinative with plural strokes and before these the top of a sign which may well be the walking legs of s'msw, yielding a phrase ending in 'the following of Wennofer'. Grapow's speeches contain two variants of that phrase. Speech I on the Cairo stela 34057 already mentioned, reads: 'If ;hw are transformed, my bi shall follow Wennofer.' Speech 5 on Louvre A 60, a statue of the High Priest of Memphis, Meryptah, has: 'If one is trans- formed because of doing truth, I shall be transformed and shall follow Wennofer.' Speech 4 on Berlin stela 7272 has a phrase that, with the clause of cause hr irt gr kb on the same stela, fits well 62</page><page sequence="7">SENENU, HIGH PRIEST OF AMUN the lacuna at the end of line 8 and may have stood there originally: iw i r tpy n hsyw m smsw n Wn-nfr, 'I shall be in front of the favoured in the following of Wennofer'. For the writing of s.msw with the god determinative (Sign List A40), see Urk. iv, 1469, 17 (= Hermann, op. cit. 46, 8), an inscription from the tomb stela of Pr-hk;-mn called Bni; (TT 343), a contemporary of Senenu (JEA 46, 35). (k) For the tow-ropes of the ferry-boat being attached for or by the deceased, using either the verb rkf (Wb. I, 234, 9) or tz (Wb. v, 396-7), as here, see chapters 99, Ioo, 183 of the Book of the Dead and Urk. iv, 116, i6. The lacuna after this phrase is short and di'f fits the gap suitably. The prepositional m, 'in', is not generally written after d? mhnt and the initial m of mhnt 'ferry-boat' (Wb. ii, I33, 12-I3) may have served double duty (see Hermann, Stelen, 21, 13; 25, 8; 5I, 3 and, especially 36, IO, where in the phrase d;-n'i m dpt ntr the prepositional m is clearly written). (I) Louvre A 60 has in Speech 5: 'I shall take the form of a phoenix, partaking of [smi m, see Faulkner, Dict. 226; cf. Wb. III, 447, I7] the offering-table.' If we restore the determinative of the phoenix bird (Sign List G3I) after bnw, as seems likely, the phrase sm. m wdhw fits the lacuna at the end of line 8. (m) For mrw(t) 'slaves', see Abd el-Mohsen Bakir, Slavery in Pharaonic Egypt, 22-9. (n) Dr. Wilson in his textual notes made the suggestion that the apodosis here may contain a paraphrase of chapter 80 of the Book of the Dead, which reads in one version (Papyrus Ryerson, Allen, Book of the Dead, 155): 'A spell for assuming the form of a god and putting light in the way of darkness.' The fuller version of the chapter heading is too lengthy for our lacuna and a shorter variant would be necessary. Papyrus Milbank (Allen, ibid.) has 'A spell for assuming the form of a god and making light', which may fit the lacuna at the end of line io. Since I can find no parallel on contemporary stelae, however, and since line io of our stela interjects the phrase 'as the good god', I have left the lacuna unrestored and offer Dr. Wilson's suggestion as a solution on which I can make no improvement. The suggestion would have the advantage of being a paraphrase of the chapter headings from the 'Chapters of Making Transformations' as our other apodoses seem to be. (o) For the Island of the Righteous already in the Coffin Texts, see De Buck, CT Iv, 218 (Spell 335), a variant of BD 17 (Allen, op. cit. 89). I know of no literal parallel to the phrase in line ii, but Sn-mn similarly wishes memory of him to survive in the necropolis (Urk. Iv, 4I2, II). (p) The phrase at the end of line 11 is troublesome, but it seems possible that we have here a very abbreviated writing of mir with the platform (Sign List Aai i) and the forearm (Sign List D36). (q) The parallels in Urk. iv, 116, 9; 148, 3; and 498, 12; have hnm-k wsht nt m;r-ty while that in Urk. iv, 520, 6 has htp.k. The traces at the beginning of line 12 yield m wsht nt mir.ty and I have restored htp.f since hnm is not regularly followed by m while one does commonly rest (htp) m a place (Faulkner, Dict. I80). (r) Book of the Dead chapter 178 (Naville, I, pl. ccii) has iw mhit mir'ti hr zp.k, 'the balance being balanced at your turn'. The phrase in line 13 may be a garbled version of this with the suffix pronouns hopelessly confused. Urk. Iv, I0-i i presents a different version of the judgement: dd'kwi hr mhkt . . . ipkwi, . mhikwi, wd4;kwi 'I being placed on the balance, .. ., I being examined, I being complete, I being sound'. Berlin 9320 (Agypt. Inschr. II, 229) has prt mir-hrw r mhiy and perhaps a similar phrase should be restored at the beginning of line I3, though 'so that it may come forth justified to the balance' seems redundant in light of the phrase at the end of line i . (s) The last phrase with wd; is similar to the end of line I3 here, rw(t)-f wd&amp;(w), 'its limbs being sound'. I have no parallel for the defective writing of wt (Wb. I, i6oc I5-17) without the loaf t and it seems equally possible that the scribe left out the h of hrw (Wb. III, 37, 7). The three flesh determinatives (Sign List F5i) at any rate make it certain that one or the other alternative was intended. The sculptor of Senenu's stela was not the most careful of craftsmen and at the end of 63</page><page sequence="8">64 EDWARD BROVARSKI the line he has incorrectly cut an n in place of the book roll determinative of wdb, an error he repeats in line 3 on the lower part of the stela. (t) Line I4 is badly damaged though the Louvre fragment adds a few more signs. The line ends r rmt but the absence of a stroke after the first r suggests that the phrase is neither mnh rnzi m ri rmt (Urk. iv, 150, 5) nor iwn'f m r; rmt (Urk. Iv, 5I8, 17) which occur on two contemporary monu- ments, but rather to be restored n irzi isft r rmt 'I did not commit a wrong against people', a phrase which, with a sdm'n-f of the verb iri, occurs twice in the tomb of the vizier Ramose (Davies, The Tomb of the Vizier Ramose, pls. xxii and xl). The traces seem to fit this phrase though the stela of Senenu consistently uses n sdm-f in the denials of guilt that begin here or in the phrase lost at the beginning of line I4. (u) As the next two clauses in line 15 are paralleled on the stela of the vizier Wsr (Urk. iv, I03I, 8-9), one might expect the preceding clause there n k4 rmnwi m pr nb ksw, 'I was not haughty in the house of the lord of bowings', to occur similarly on the stela of Senenu. The traces at the beginning of line I5 do not suit such a reconstruction, however, and the presence of n ir at the end of line 14 assures that we need a denial beginning with that verb form. Wb. does not seem to list k; rmn which, on the model of kF ib 'haughty' and Fk s; 'presumptuous, overweening' (Faulkner, Dict. 275), translates well as 'haughty' or the like. (v) The Egyptian f;i-r, 'raised of arm', seems not far removed in meaning from the English idiom 'to raise one's hand' against someone and as the context calls for an undesirable quality, the idiom fii-r here is better translated 'combative' than 'pious' (Wb. I, 572, 9-IO). (w) An epithet of the god Min (JWb. I, 572, II), undoubtedly referring to his raised right forearm in which he supports a flail; see also T. G. H. James, Hieroglyphic Texts from Egyptian Stelae, etc., Ix, pi. xxxix, 2, where Min is called 'the Great, Lofty of Plumes, Raised of Arm', and Pierret, Rec. inscrs. I, 89, for 'Min-Horus of Coptos, Raised of Arm'. (x) The Lord of Silence is, at least in the Late Period, Osiris; see Gauthier, Dict. geogr. II, I3I. Already in the Eloquent Peasant, the Lord of Silence and his domain are mentioned. The villain, Nmty-nht, threatens the peasant thus: 'Don't raise your voice, peasant! Look, you are on your way to the domain (dmi) of the Lord of Silence (BI, 26-7)'; and the peasant in his turn appeals to the Lord of Silence to return his goods which Nmty-nht had stolen (BI, 29-30). (y) A parallel text, Urk. iv, 64, I, has 'I was not contentious [di-rl, Faulkner, Dict. 318] over the god's offerings', and Urk. Iv, 103I, 12 is similar. (z) The initial sign of the verb is a poorly cut butcher's knife (Sign List T34). The stela of Wsr (Urk. Iv, I031, ii) has n nm-i m wrbt n ntr'i, 'I did not steal a meat-offering(?) of my god'. The verb nm (Faulkner, Dict. I33) 'to steal' on Wsr's stela is determined with a fish, but Senenu's monument has the more common determinative, the sparrow (Sign List G37). The word wrbt written with the flesh determinative (Sign List F5i) means 'meat-offering' (Wb. I, 284, II-I2). Though it is without that determinative on Wsr's stela, I believe there may be traces of the sign in the damaged area before the t of wrbt on Senenu's. (aa) A compound phrase with smi is necessary and, without a parallel text, sml-t;, 'be interred' (Wb. III, 448-9), comes most readily to mind. But a sentence that occurs on a contemporary stela n smri isftyw, 'I did not associate with wrong-doers' (Urk. Iv, 442, 8) yields a better meaning here. Note at this point the change from indicative n sdm.f to the subjunctive nn sdm-f, 'so that not . .' I assume the n before the nm-sign in the previous phrase to be a phonetic complement as often (Wb. II, 263-72). (ab) The in indicates some activity on Senenu's part, but whether ssp rnh 'receiving a bouquet', as Urk. Iv, 1500, 5, or some such verb as iit or prt, stood in the lacuna is rendered uncertain by the presence of the vertical book roll (Sign List Yi) which does not commonly occur with any of these.</page><page sequence="9">SENENU, HIGH PRIEST OF AMUN 65 (ac) Urk. IV, 1475, 13-15 adds 'and cause you to endure, and save and protect you from every evil', and Urk. iv, 1462, 3 'and may he give to you a goodly lifetime in the service of the king'. (ad) See Gardiner, Egn. Gr. 256 (top). (ae) The representation of the wrb-priest of Amiin in the first phyle and of the four phyles who follow him on the lower right half of the stela is of some interest. In the second century B.C. at Tebtynis in the Fayum, in the twenty-ninth year of Ptolemy Euergetes II, there were five phyles of priests serving in the temple of Sebek, Lord of Tf-tn (Tebtynis) (S. R. K. Glanville, 'The Admission of a Priest of Soknebtynis in the Second Century B.C.' JEA 19 [I933], 34-41). Dr. George Hughes has pointed out to me that this increase in the number of phyles from four to five took place during the reign of the first Euergetes (Canopus Decree, hierogl. text 13 = demot. 7 = Greek 24). In the Old Kingdom there may also have been five priestly phyles (Helck, 'Die Hand- werkerund Priesterphylen des Alten Reiches in Agypten', Die Welt des Orients 7 (1973), I-8) whose organization was modelled on that of a boat crew. The evidence from the Middle and New King- doms, and the Late Period up to the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes I, however, admits of four phyles only, not named, as in the Old Kingdom, but numbered consecutively I-4. They appear to have served for one month at a time. Thus, a priest of the Twenty-second Dynasty is 'great wrb of the temple of Amun, who is in his month (of service), of the 4h-mnw, in the third phyle' (LD III, 255i). A Middle-Kingdom papyrus from Kahun (L. Borchardt, 'Die Zweite Papyrusfund von Kahun', ZAS 37 [1899], 89-103), providing a duty roster of the temple there, records the official transaction at the rotation of the fourth and first phyles of the temple: 'The report of the first phyle of the staff (wnwt) of this temple which is entering upon (its) monthly duties (m chr m ?bd) ... we have received all the equipment of the temple ... it being intact and in good condition, from the fourth phyle of the staff of this temple which is retiring from (its) monthly duties (m smnt m ;bd).' Since there were four phyles, they presumably rotated on a regular basis three times a year, each phyle serving a total of three months annually. In the New Kingdom the phyles were composed of lector- priests, ordinary (wrb-)priests and acolytes (imy-st-r). The phyles served the mortuary temples of the kings as well as the great state temples and the smaller shrines. It is doubtful whether we can make any generalizations about the size of the phyles based on the representation of the priests at the bottom of Senenu's stela which shows three priests to each of the four phyles. Presumably, the size of the phyles in the great temples at Thebes, Memphis, Heliopolis, and elsewhere would have been larger than those in the royal mortuary temples. However, in the Canopus Decree it was laid down (Canopus Decree, hierogl. text 15, 16 = demot. 8, 9 = Greek 29, 30; see the discussion by Glanville, op. cit. 39-40) that each of the five phyles should be composed of five priests and Black- man, at least, felt the number was consistent for even the large temples (Hastings, ERE, 'Priest, Priesthood (Egyptian)', p. 298). If, in the admission decree of the priest of Soknebtynis, already referred to above, it is assumed that no affiliations were given, there are exactly twenty-five persons listed (i.e. the number stipulated in the Canopus Decree). The numbers are quite unequally divided among the phylae, however. Similarly, a list of priests of Ptah and Hathor in the Ptah temple at Thebes (Orinst P 33796 = FN 6345; P.-M. II, 200 (i8)) which, because of its quartile division, may represent the phyles of the temple, lists four lector-priests but then distributes the twelve ordinary priests unequally among the four groups. Acolytes are not listed in this roster and it is tempting to add one acolyte for each of the four phyles to reach twenty, the number of priests that made up the four phyles before the Canopus Decree, but this remains only a suggestion, being completely unsubstantiated by evidence. Presumably, twelve priests would have been sufficient to staff the temple of Amin in Deir el-Bahri, but it remains possible that the number of priests in each phyle was abbreviated in the representation on Senenu's stela to fit the space available. On the other hand, twelve is also the number of the ordinary priests in the list of priests in the Ptah 4482C75 F</page><page sequence="10">EDWARD BROVARSKI temple and the twelve priests on Senenu's stela may represent the ordinary priests minus, for some reason, the acolytes and lector priests who also made up the phyle. (af) That the priest Amenemhat proffered a bouquet is apparent from the position of his arms on the Chicago fragment, though only the very upper part of his arms are preserved. The presentation of bouquets to the deceased was an important part of the great Feast of the Valley in the tenth month of the year (see Siegfried Schott, Das schone Fest des Wiistentales, pp. 48 ff.), when Amun left Karnak and was ferried across to visit the mortuary temples of the kings on the west bank, and festivities were celebrated in the tomb chapels in which the living took part. (ag) Since T. G. Allen copied the inscription on Senenu's stela, the last half of the wife's name has been chipped off the left edge of the stone and lost. Allen's copy is excellent in every other particular, however, and I follow it here. The name Mirt- ^\c: 1 ; ^ ks-rr-nbt-t.wy 'Ma&lt;atkare&lt;-is-Lady-of-the-Two-Lands' is Zc rL unlisted in Ranke's PN. It did not originally stand after snt.f mrt.f on the stone but has been recut (see fig. I) over nbt-pr and a now illegible name that followed, while nbt-pr [[j ~was then carved once again below, before the face of Senenu's spouse. While it is possible that Senenu re- FIG. I married and that the name of his new wife was put in the place of the name of his previous spouse, it seems equally possible that Senenu's first wife adopted a name incorporating that of her husband's patroness and reflecting the latter's change in status as co-regent of Tuthmosis III. (ah) The name .Hnwt-hmwt is unlisted in Ranke, PN. (ai) For Nb r-dr see Wb. v, 230, I5-I6; probably here Rec, since the gods immediately following have a part in the Heliopolitan cosmogony.

Wente pointed out the easiest solution to this group; reading the | as ° though there is no sign of the lip of the jar. For the phrase 'god's-fathers of this temple', see Urk. IV, I495, I4-I5 where the god's-fathers are included, along with the ordinary priests, lector-priests, and acolytes, in the regular staff (wnwt) of the temple. (ao) The writing of hry-hbt is defective here, lacking the b while the basket (Sign List V30) incorrectly substitutes for the basin (Sign List W3) and is separated from the writing of 'lector priest' by the wrb-sign (Sign List D6o). (ap) A d is clearly preserved in the damaged portion of the aaeline and only smdt (b. v, I47, 2-7) 'subordinates' seems to fit the space. (aq) From the Middle Kingdom the papyrus column (Sign List Mi3) is a frequent substitute for the cord wound on the stick (Sign List V24) (see Gardiner's Egn. Gr. 480). The phrase swd4tn Izttn n hrdlmsw-tn mi dd-tn htp-di-nswt occurs already in the Middle Kingdom (e.g. Hieroglyphic Texts from Egyptian Stelae, etc. in the British Museum, III, pi. 13) and is the standard form of this virtual clause of asseveration on most of the stelae of the Eighteenth Dynasty. On Senenu's stela, however, the apodosis of the clause is ir4tn htp-di-nswt '(if) you make an offering-which-the-king- gives', omitting the preposition ml before the sdm.f form of the verb irz. On the statue group of the vizier Wsr and his wife in Cairo (Urk. iv, 1035-7), the idiom is again 'to make an offering-which- the-king-gives', though here the preposition mi is included before the sdmf form of the verb. A stela 66</page><page sequence="11">SENENU, HIGH PRIEST OF AMUN of the same individual, however, has '(if) you say an offering-which-the-king-gives' (Urk. IV, I032, 9-Io). The word for 'children' on Senenu's stela and Wsr's two monuments, along with the Middle- Kingdom stela, is written with the determinative of a child seated with hand to mouth (Sign List Ai7). In the biographical inscription of Rh-mi-rr (Urk. iv, 1084, i ) msw is written, but on the stela of the scribe Djehuty-nefer hrdw is the word (Urk. iv, I6Io, I2). Senenu's stela asks quite simply for a htp-di-nswt to Amin, Lord of Karnak for the soul of Senenu but the stela of P;-hry at El-Kab expands the standard formulation into an interesting peroration on the invocation formula: 'You shall pass on (your offices) to your children according as you shall say an offering-which-the-king- gives, in accordance with (m-snt-r) the writings, which comes forth at the voices, according as the ancestors said, as it came forth from the mouth of god.' (Urk. Iv, I21, 8-II; see also Urk. Iv, 509, Io.) Two of the texts add a qualifying clause after 'you shall pass on your offices to your children', namely, 'after a lengthy lifetime (Urk. iv, 1084, ii)' and 'after a long old age (itw w;h)' (Urk. iv, I6Io, 12). (as) Ranke, PN I, 249, i, for the name of the father. But of this particular Hr-ms, I can find no trace in the records. (at) The name of the mother, Rfrf, is not listed in Ranke, PN. All we know about Senenu's life and career are the meagre biographical details that can be gleaned from his stela. He was the son of a lady named Rfrf and her husband, Hr-ms, who held the important office of Overseer of the Cattle of Amun. Senenu married a woman with the cumbersome name Mfrt-k;-rr-nbt-t;.wy and the couple had at least one child, a daughter, IHnwt-hmwt, who appears with her parents on her father's stela. Neither Senenu, nor his father, mother, spouse, or daughter, seems to appear in the records elsewhere. As Senenu held several offices in Hatshepsut's mor- tuary temple at Deir el-Bahri, including the paramount position of high priest, a brief summary of the history of the queen's temple will have to suffice in lieu of a detailed prosopographical study. Hatshepsut's temple of Djeser-djeseru is mentioned already on a stela dated to Year 312 of Tuthmosis III's reign, some few months after the queen's coronation. The founding of the queen's temple certainly antedates this time, and it seems probable that the project was conceived of before Hatshepsut was crowned in Tuthmosis' second year.I3 Certainly, Senenmut had repaired to the Aswan quarries while Hatshepsut was still 'king's great wife' and by the time Hatshepsut was crowned, her two enormous obelisks were ready for erection at Thebes.14 The stela of Year 3 was found by the French mission in the Mont temple at Karnak and commemorates a gift by Senenmut (here Steward of Amuin) of 5 arourae of land and of a male and female slave to the Deir el-Bahri temple and the workhouse which Hatshepsut had built there for her father Amiin in Djeser-djeseru.I5 The talented Senenmut, on a statue found in the Karnak Mut temple, claims to have been Controller of Works in Djeser-djeseru (Urk. iv, 409, 5 ff.) and to have held the same office in Karnak, in Luxor, and at Hermonthis. 12 Louis A. Christophe, Karnak-Nord, III, 87-9, pi. 15. Helck, 'Die Opferstiftung des Sn-mwt', ZAS 85 (1960), 24, 30, 34, reads the date as 'year 4'. A close examination of the spacing of the signs on pi. 15 of Christophe's publication has suggested both to myself and to Prof. Charles F. Nims that the grouping is better read as 'year 3'. I3 S.

On his stela, now in Northampton (Urk. IV, 419 ff.) Djehuty says: 'I acted as chief, giving directions, I led the craftsmen to work in the works'7 in Djeser-djeseru.' If the Karnak stela provides us with the information that Hatshepsut's temple was a-building by Year 3 of Tuthmosis, ostraca found by the Metropolitan Museum of Art's expeditions at Deir el-Bahri between the years 1922 and 1936 and published by Hayes,I8 carry us through construction work on the upper portions of the temple in year Io of Tuthmosis III, the cutting of the sanctuary, the grading of the forecourt, and the erection of its gateway. Another ostracon found in a temple dump is dated to the king's twentieth year when the temple had been built and decorated and Hatshep- sut's own end was not far off. Tuthmosis, of course, effaced Hatshepsut's name through- out the temple and also many of her portraits. As J. Lipinska'9 has pointed out, Tuthmosis III's determination to deprive the temple of Hatshepsut of its predominance at Deir el-Bahri seems to be the explanation for the existence of the Djeser-akhet temple on its inconvenient site. After Hatshepsut's demise, Tuthmosis' new temple was the goal of the procession of the Feast of the Valley,20 and the procession may well have by-passed Hatshepsut's temple completely. The cult of Amun in Djeser-djeseru was maintained till the end of the Twentieth Dynasty. In the tomb of Ti-mi-sb, it is listed alongside that of Amun in Djeser-akhet.2' But after the queen's death and subse- quent disgrace, Djeser-djeseru ceased to function as the queen's mortuary temple and undoubtedly suffered a consequent decline in importance and prestige. No priests of Hatshepsut's mortuary cult are known22 and it seems likely that Tuthmosis suppressed her cult also. Indeed, with the exception of Sen-nefer, Mayor of Thebes, who held the office of Controller of Young Cows of Amin in Djeser-djeseru (Urk. Iv, 1418, iz) under Amenophis II, the personnel of Hatshepsut's temple known to us belong to the reign of Hatshepsut herself or to that of her co-regent Tuthmosis.23 Senenu, then, may have been the only holder of the office of High Priest in Djeser-djeseru.24 It even seems possible that he shared the fate of others closely associated with the queen. His stela was smashed and thrown out from his now lost tomb,25 apparently in antiquity. If the 16 James H. Breasted, A History of Egypt (I905, repr. Bantam, I964), 227. 17 Breasted, Anc.

Hatshepsut tells us that she built the Hathor shrine for her mother, Hathor, Chieftainess of Thebes (hry-tp W?st27) and in a number of places on the walls of the Hathor shrine Hathor, Chieftainess of Thebes is hrt-ib Djeser-djeseru.28 Hathor, Chieftainess of Thebes, was worshipped at Thebes already in the time of the Twelfth Dynasty. King Sesostris I dedicated a basalt dyad of himself together with the goddess.29 On its base, he is 'Beloved of Hathor, Chieftainess of Thebes'. The find-spot of the statue, Karnak, suggests that in Sesostris' day a shrine to that goddess stood in the Karnak precinct. In the time of Tuthmosis III, Hathor, Chieftainess of Thebes, had a shrine at Karnak where she was worshipped as a consort of Ptah.30 The surviving shrine of Hathor, the southern chapel of the Ptah temple at Karnak, dates to the time of Tuthmosis, who constructed it when he rebuilt the Ptah temple some time after his twenty-third year.3I On its walls Tuthmosis is shown seven times offering to the goddess (Chic. Or. Inst. photos 9624-3I; P.-M. II, 201). Five of the representations of Hathor have been destroyed above the waist and their inscriptions are gone. In the two figures preserved Hathor appears as she does at Deir el-Bahri32 with the sun-disk and cow's horns on her head, and is named in the of Tuthmosis III (P.-M. ii9 (1960), 325). Dr. William Murnane of the Epigraphic Survey staff was kind enough to examine tomb 225 for me, a task which included the removal of the stone blockage from its entrance, in April I974. The only text that remains is behind the figure of the tomb owner on the eastern half of the south wall and reads hm-ntr tpy n .Hthr . . . Dr. Murnane found no trace whatsoever of the name of the wife, given by Porter and Moss, and was under the strong impression that the tomb was never finished, both the rear part of the chamber and its statue niche being incompletely excavated. 26 As, for instance, did the tomb of Dhwty (see Davies, Griffith Studies, 281, 284; pls. 41, 42), the tomb of 'Imn-htp(?)

To the list of Ptah priests (compiled by Helck, Materialien, I, 63), add a son of P;-iry, owner of Theban Tomb No. I39. This son was named B;k-n-wrl and had the titles wrb, hry-hb(t) n Pth nb Wist (seen on a colour transparency of Dr. Charles F. Nims). Helck lists two incumbents of the office of High Priest of Ptah at Thebes, the P;-iry just mentioned, who served under Tuthmosis IV, and a Kt-m- Wst who dates to the Igth Dynasty. To this list we should, perhaps, add a certain Sn-kd who, on an ushabti from his tomb, is named idnw n pr 'Imn, hm-ntr tpy n Pth (Sotheby Parke Bernet, Inc., Antiquities, catalogue of a public auction, May 4, I974, pp. 38-9, no. 4I). The ushabti dates stylistically to the early I9th Dynasty, between the reigns of Horemheb and Ramesses II. That the joint worship of Ptahl and Hathor in the Karnak Ptah temple continued into, or was resumed in, Saite times, is indicated by a title of a Theban vizier, a con- temporary of Psammetichus I (ASAE 7 (i906), 50-2), who was hm ntr Pth Hthr nb W;st. 32 On walls throughout the five chambers of the Hathor shrine (Naville, op. cit., pls. 92, 93, 97, 99, oo00, 102, 106) and on the end wall of the sanctuary itself (pl. io6). Where the inscriptions over these figures are original and not obscured by Atenist erasures the anthropomorphic Hathor, with sun-disk and cow's horns on her head, is regularly labelled Hathor, Chieftainess of Thebes, while Hathor in her bovine form is Hathor of Dendera (pls. 87, 94, 104). Somtus, Son of Hathor and Chief of Dendera also appears on the walls of the shrine (Naville, op. cit., pl. 98) as does Horus hry-ib 'Iwnt (Orinst P 40643).

Inst. photo 9658), offering to Amun, Ptah, and Mut of Ishru on the right, and to Amun, Ptah, and Hathor, Chieftainess of Thebes on the left. Before this temple, there was a still older temple of Ptah, for Tuthmosis tells us that he found it built of bricks with doors and pillars of wood.33 Undoubtedly this temple had a chapel to Hathor, for on the same stela in which he commemorates his rebuilding of the Ptah temple Tuthmosis ordered Hathor's customary ceremonies (nt-r nt hnw, Wb. II, I97) to be carried out. This earlier temple may well have been of Middle-Kingdom date and that it was the principal shrine of Hathor in Hatshepsut's time is suggested by a scene and an inscription on the northern wall of the entrance hall of the Deir el-Bahri shrine.34 Here is depicted the arrival of the great annual river procession of Amuin on the west side of the river. Accompanying the bark of Amun (now destroyed) is that of Hathor.35 The superscrip- tion indicates that, like Amun of Karnak, Hathor, Chieftainess of Thebes, dwelt at Deir el-Bahri only at specified times of the year: 'Shouting by the crews of the royal boats, the youths of Thebes, the fair lads of the army of the entire land, of praises in greeting this god, Amun, Lord of Karnak, in his procession of tp-rnpt,36 on behalf of the life, prosperity, and health of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, M rt-k;-rr, and on behalf of the life, prosperity, and health of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Mn-hpr-k;-rr,37 given life forever, at the time of causing this great goddess [i.e. on yet another wall in the same guise as Hathor, Chieftainess of Thebes (Orinst P 40649). In the Hathor speos of Tuthmosis III in the Eleventh-Dynasty temple, however, the situation is exactly opposite: the goddess in her bovine form is named Hathor, Chieftainess of Thebes, while the goddess with horns and disk is Hathor, Lady of Dendera (Nims, Thebes of the Pharaohs, fig. io). 33 Urk. iv, 763 ff. 34 Naville, op. cit., pls. 90-I. 35 Naville, op. cit., pls. 88, 89. The cow's head of Hathor actually appears twice, with disk and horns on the bark in the second register from the bottom (pls. 90, 91) and with plumes added to the horns and disk on the figurehead on the boat behind. The front barge has a kiosk from which the portable image of the goddess has been removed. In the outer sanctuary of the Hathor shrine (ibid., pl. 104), the bark room, it rests on its portable bark while on the southern wall of the inner sanctuary, the statue stands as it would have for the duration of the procession, having been removed from its portable boat. The scene of the procession is interesting in another aspect. At least three royal barges appear (ibid., pls. 88, 89, 91) with their thrones empty as though the royal occupants had left to join the procession. In the Theban tomb of Kha'emhat (TT 57), a similar representation of an empty chair (with two bouquets) is a poignant allusion to the final departure of the deceased for the Beyond (Wreszinski, Atlas, I, Taf. 209). As two seem to be assigned to Hatshepsut and Tuthmosis, and Nefrure' elsewhere seems to have been assigned royal prerogatives (Redford, History and Chronology of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt [Toronto, 1967], 85), the third royal bark may have belonged to the Queen's daughter and the heir to her throne. 36 For a discussion of the meaning of the term tp-rnpt, see Richard A. Parker, The Calendars of Ancient Egypt (Chicago, 1950), Excursus B, 6i-2. 37 For Mn-hpr-k;-rr, a variant of Tuthmosis III's prenomen which appears to have been used during the period of his co-regency with Hatshepsut, see Urk. IV, 215, 6-7. A superficial examination of the occurrences of the prenomina of Tuthmosis III in Gauthier, Livre des Rois and Cerny-Gardiner, Inscriptions of Sinai yielded dates between Years 5 and 20 for the form Mn-hpr-k;-rr: see Gauthier, LR, II-B, 254, iv; and Sinai, nos. 175, I76, I80, 181. The shorter prenomen Mn-hpr-rr appeared in inscriptions dated to Years i and 2 (LR, II-B, 253-4, i and ii), 3 or 4 (see n. 12 above), and 5 (LR, II-B, 254, iii). After Year 21 (LR, II-B, 255, vi) the form Mn-hpr-rr becomes ubiquitous.</page><page sequence="15">SENENU, HIGH PRIEST OF AMUN Hathor] to proceed to rest in her temple in Djeser-djeseru-Amu-n, so that they [HIjat- shepsut and Tuthmosis III] might achieve life forever' (Urk. iv, 308, I-8 = Naville, Deir el Bahari, iv, pls. 90-I). In an article on the 'Names and History of the Sanctuaries Built by Tuthmosis III at Deir el-Bahri', Jadwiga Lipinska38 suggested that the Hathor shrine of Tuthmosis III, built in the north-western corner of the platform of the Mentuhotep temple, was connected with the temple of Tuthmosis III above, forming part of the temple complex, in the same way as the chapel of Hathor was incorporated into the temple complex of Hatshepsut, and that the name of Djeser-akhet was applied to the whole Tuthmosis III complex, including the Hathor shrine in the Eleventh-Dynasty temple. While Tuth- mosis III built the Hathor speos and incorporated it into the platform of his new temple above,39 there is some evidence that the Hathor shrine in the Mentuhotep temple was considered as an integral part of h-swt. The Hathor cow of Amenophis II, for instance, found in the speos by Maspero, has the identifying label Hthr nbt Dsr hrt-ib ;h-swt, 'Hathor, the Lady of Djeser, who is in the midst of ih-swt',40 while a New-Kingdom stela found at Deir el-Bahri in Igo441 and showing a representation of the Hathor cow emerging from the cliff, has the same label. Amun was worshipped at 2h-swt until the end of the Twentieth Dynasty42 and was served by a priesthood whose members are attested on some half-dozen monuments.43 That the cult of Hathor in Tuthmosis III's speos was similarly served is indicated by a statue of one of her clergy, an r.-hpr-k; who was 'wrb-priest of Hathor in hi-swt'.44 The inscription on the knees of a statue of Teti45 cited by Lipinska46 as indicating that the name Djeser-akhet was applied to the Hathor shrine reads in full: 'Executing the laws, establishing the regulations, causing every office to know its duty in every rite in the temple (pr) of Amin in Djeser-akhet for Hathor, Chieftainess of the Desert.' The inscription shows that a form of Hathor was worshipped in Djeser-akhet, but the invocation formula around the base of the statue draws a careful distinction between Hathor of Tuthmosis III's temple, who is called 'Hathor, Mistress of Manu, who is in (the midst) of Djeser-akhet', and the Hathor of the speos who is 'Hathor, Mistress of ;h-swt'.47 If Tuthmosis built Djeser-akhet to deprive Hatshepsut's temple of its pre- dominance in the Deir el-Bahri bay and of its part in the festivities of Amuin's Feast of the Valley, it seems equally likely that he built the speos to replace Hatshepsut's chapel in the affections of Hathor's devotees, for Tuthmosis' building was dedicated, as was Hatshepsut's chapel, to Hathor in her bovine form of Chieftainess of Thebes. Senenu adds another dignity to his offices of High Priest of Amun and High priest of Hathor in Hatshepsut's Deir el-Bahri temple on the lower part of his stela; that of High Priest of Amun in Kha'-akhet.

Here it occurs after the temple of Djeser-djeseru and before (after a gap) that of Mut, Lady of Ishru.49 Khac- akhet is again associated with the name of Hatshepsut on a stone from a foundation deposit (Urk. iv, 381, Io) whose inscription reads: 'May the good god Ma&lt;atkarEc, beloved of Amun who presides over (hnty) Djeser-djeseru and is in (the midst of) a live.'

From the above it seems clear that Kha&lt;-akhet was a structure erected by Ijatshepsut and dedicated to Amun. Its location between the Deir el-Bahri temple of Hatshepsut and the mortuary temple of Tuthmosis III on the edge of the cultivation somewhat south of the Deir el-Bahri bay suggests that Kha&lt;-akhet was erected in the neighbour- hood of Deir el-Bahri. Indeed, Davies identified Deir el-Bahri with the middle terrace of the Deir el-Bahri temple.52 Marciniak,53 however, assumed Kha&lt;-akhet to be a small chapel which Hatshepsut built in the neighbourhood of Deir el-Bahri and Helck54 suggests that it was dedicated to the cult of the princess Nefrurc. The fullest description of Kha&lt;-akhet is given in the autobiography of Djehuty (Urk. Iv, 422, 17-423, 3), who calls the edifice 'the great seat (st wrt) of Amiun, his horizon which is in the west'. In an article on building terminology in Papyrus Harris, Christophe55 shows that the term st wrt in the great papyrus had two applications in addition to its original meaning as e throne on which the king or god sits; it can denote both the entire temple and its sanctuary alone. While the three usages can be illustrated in the texts of the New Kingdom, in the Eighteenth Dynasty st wrt seems to have had a specialized connotation. It means 'shrine, sanctuary', but specifically the characteristic Eighteenth-Dynasty form of the shrine, the e, e'bark shrine' which contained the low pedestal on which the portable bark of the god rested between processions.56 This special connotation of st wrt probably derives from the application of the term to the bark pedestal. In more than one instance, on the bark shrine of Hatshepsut and Tuthmosis htp hr st wrt is carved under the bark of Amiun and beside its support.57 On the same red quartzite shrine of Tuthmosis and Hatshepsut the term st-wrt is extended to the entire bark shrine. Named 'the Place of the Heart of Amiin'58 on the shrine itself, it is called by Tuthmosis elsewhere ( Urk. iv, 167, I-4) 'the splendid shrine (hm) (named) "the Place of the Heart of Amun", his great seat (st wrt) like the horizon 48 E.

Tuthmosis replaced this sanctuary with a granite shrine59 and some thousand years later Philip Arrhidaeus replaced Tuthmosis' shrine with a sanctuary which was a faithful copy.60 Significantly, it is the second of the two rooms of this sanctuary, the actual bark room, which received the dedication of the king where the shrine is called a st wrt. In the Twentieth Dynasty, too, at Medinet Habu, the term was used to designate a bark shrine; the bark shrines of Amin, of Mont, and of Khons6I are all called 'great seats'. In the inscription of Djehuty, then, Kha'-akhet may be identified as a bark shrine. The inscription on the stone from the foundation deposit of Kha&lt;-akhet (Urk. IV, 38I, io) which mentions Amun of Djeser-djeseru as dwelling in Kha&lt;-akhet suggests to the writer that 'The mansion of Ma(atkarec (named) Kha&lt;-akhet-Amun', is the name of the central sanctuary at Deir el-Bahri with its outer bark room and inner sanctuary. Otto62 thought that the name of the central sanctuary at Djeser-djeseru was the hwt M;rt-k;-rr Gm-;ht-'Imn, whose name appears twice on the heads of two women carrying vases on both sides of the doorway leading into the first room of the central sanctuary at Deir el-Bahri.63 These figures, however, are certainly personifications of estates of Hatshepsut in Upper Egypt and the Delta as the inscriptions before the two figures declare them to be: 'the mansion of Ma'atkare (named) Gem-akhet-Amun, which is in the Northland/Southland.' On the bark shrine of Hatshepsut and Tuth- mosis, Khac-akhet is called the 'mansion (hwt) of Macatkarec'. In a number of instances in inscriptions of the New Kingdom hwt (Urk. iv, 766, 2; 859, 2; 879, 2) replaces hwt-ntr (Urk. iv, 765, 7; 858, II; 879, 7) and the latter term is used with the restricted meaning of 'sanctuary' both of the central sanctuary of Hatshepsut's temple64 and of the red quartzite bark shrine of Tuthmosis and Hatshepsut.65 The term hwt, too, can be used both of a free-standing temple66 and of a rock-cut chamber, whether a quarry chamber67 or a rock-cut tomb (Urk. iv, II1183, I5) or a sanctuary as was Khac-akhet.68 59 Otto, op. cit. 23. 60 Barguet, Karnak, 136-7. 61 Medinet Habu, VI, pls. 409, 441, 451; VII, pi. 50I. 62 Otto, op. cit. 63. 63 Naville, Deir el Bahari, v, pi. 139. 64 JEA 46, 36 n. 2. 65 Nims, JNES 14, 113; Inscriptions 4a, b. 66 LD III, 7Ia, b. 67 LD III, 7Ia, b. 68 I would like to thank both Mr. John Sanders, of the Oriental Institute Nippur Expedition staff and Dr. Timothy Kendall, of the Egyptian Department of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, for long hours spent on the reconstruction drawing of the stela of Senenu presented herein as pl.
