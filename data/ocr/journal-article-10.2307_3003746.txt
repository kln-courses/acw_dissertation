William Keach. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1977. xviii + 277 pp. $16.00. While there have been many recent articles devoted to the Elizabethan epyllia, particularly to Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis and Marlowe's Hero and Leander, Keach's is the first book-length study of the genre in English, and a welcome addition to the criticism of late sixteenth-century English poetry. Not intended to survey the history of the genre, the book is, rather, a careful examination of selected epyllia and their tradition and milieu. The book is divided into two major segments, each containing four chapters, one setting forth backgrounds, the other three examining specific poems. Part One, "Exploration and Achievement in the Elizabethan Epyllion," examines in Chapter One "Ovid and 'Ovidian' Poetry," demonstrating that "Ovidian" means more than merely borrowing narrative, especially erotic, materials from the Metamorphoses. The Metamorphoses is characterized by (1) a self-conscious tone in the presentation of the myths, especially an exaggerated (and comic) anthropomorphism; (2) an ambivalent attitude toward erotic experience, an attitude which indicates Ovid's awareness of the humor and savagery as well as the beauty and humanity of sexual love; and (3) the stylistic virtuosity which the Elizabethans so often noted in Ovid. These same characteristics pervade the epyllia. In Chapters Two, Three, and Four, Keach examines the earliest Elizabethan epyllion, Thomas Lodge's Glaucus and Scylla, and the two undisputed masterpieces of the genre, Venus and Adonis and Hero and Leander. In Glaucus Keach sees the irony and pathos which mark so many of the epyllia which follow, thus seeing in the poem an importance reaching beyond merely being the first of its type in English. He demonstrates that the strange mixture of comedy, pathos, and eroticism which has disturbed so many critics of Shake- speare's Venus is consistent with both the Elizabethan genre and its Ovidian predecessor. By concentrating on. Marlowe's narrator in Hero and Leander and his shifting attitudes toward the title characters, Keach is able to demonstrate a thematic unity in the fragment which makes its stopping point seem entirely logical. Part Two, "The Epyllion and Late Elizabethan Satire," is introduced with a chapter on "Mythological Parodies and Satirical Attacks on Lust and Erotic Poetry," an examina- tion of the merging of a general tendency toward satire in the late 1590s with a similar impulse inherent in the epyllion from its beginnings. The impulse toward "sexually- preoccupied satire" is manifested in Marston's Metamorphosis of Pigmalions Image (Chapter Six) and in Weever's Faunus and Melliflora (Chapter Seven), while mythological parody is clearly reflected in Beaumont's Salmacis and Hermaphroditus (Chapter Eight). The Conclusion, "The Epyllion and the Poetry of the 1590s - Alternatives to the Spenserian Synthesis," explores connections and contrasts between the epyllia of the '90s and Spenser's The Faerie Queene, the supreme narrative poem of the period. In the poets of the epyllia and the poet of The Faerie Queene, Keach sees important differences of sensibilities. Spenser, throughout The Faerie Queene, attempts to reconcile the "contradic- tions and tensions between different perspectives on experience," while the other poets exhibit "a self-consciously ironic tendency to heighten the contradictions and tensions inherent in narrative materials borrowed from Ovid and a wryly subversive relationship to moral orthodoxy" (pp. 219-220). Bringing together as it does several major epyllia in a single study, examining the appropriate Ovidian background as well as the Elizabethan literary milieu, Elizabethan Erotic Narratives is of primary importance to any student of Tudor narrative verse.
