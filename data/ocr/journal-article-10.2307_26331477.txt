Elliot, Elisabeth, "Ideas Never Come to Me," Expression (1969 Annual Issue), 39-40. A candid and disarming description of the habits of a professional writer, dispelling romantic notions about inspiration and "having time" to write. "Good writing, like all good art of whatever medium, springs from genuine personal experience and a clear vision. Perhaps it's time we spare the Christian reading public our little sallies into matters too great for us, and, without pleonasm, stick to what we ourselves have seen." 703. Griffin, Ernest G.

"X Ml the Way Premiere," Expression (1969 Annual Issue), 9-11. Compares Jerome Hines' opera and projected trilogy (^ Am the Truth, X M the Life) to the medieval miracle cycles because individual scenes may be performed in small churches which could never attempt the whole opera or trilogy. Speculates about major religious arts festivals to parallel the dramatic festivals in ancient Greece. 708. Packer, Nancy Huddleston. "Conversion and After," Kenyon Review, XXX, 5, 661-670. 709. Paton, Ann. Review of Adversity and Grace, edited by Nathan A. Scott, Jr., Christianity Today, XII (October 11, 1968), 20. "The title implies a unity that just isn't there." 710. Phillips, John McCandlish. "Christians and the Secular Mass Media," Expression (1969 Annual Issue), 7-8,42. A challenge to Christians to "get into places that count," to penetrate the secular mass media. 711. Rees, Sir Richard. Review of Mansions of the Spirit: Essays in Religion and Literature. edited by George A. Panichas, Modern Age, XII (Fall 1968), 408-11. The focus of this book is "religious in the fullest possible sense of the word—which is to say that it involves not only literature but politics and every aspect of human life." 712. Ruether, Rosemary. "Religious Publishing," New 52</page><page sequence="3">Book Review, October 1968. Now going into its third issue, the New Book Review (232 Madison Ave., N.Y., N.Y., 10016) "offers critical reviews of all important religious-oriented books as well as interviews with authors, articles surveying the accomplishments of major authors, and periodic reports on educational developments." 713. Smith, Anthony R., "May Our Tribe Increase," Expression (1969 Annual Issue), 45-46. "There seem to be very few dedicated Christians in the world of advertising. ... If the church is to have any contact, any influence with the world, we need qualified, sensitive, stubborn ad men, copy writers, designers, illustrators, managers. ..." 714. Stevens, A. Wilber. "Literature and Religion," Rocky Mountain Modern Language Association Bulletin. XXII (Dec. 1968), 168-176. A discussion of pitfalls and possibilities based on the following assump tions: that both literature and theology are in what Nathan Scott calls a post-modern phase in which it is eminently important to wait, and to resist the temptation to "convert complexity to dogma"; that there is a radical difference between theology (a science treating of God) and religion ("man's mythic predilection toward something beyond his own man-ness or humanness,"); that religion (activity within and beyond man) and literature (art dealing with man) are perhaps separate but also often interdependent; and that the primary humanistic concern has to do with the confrontation of mortality, so that in religion or in literature we must ultimately be dealing with questions of ethical choice. 715. Young, M. James. "Church and Theatre: an Overdue Marriage," Expression (1969 Annual Issue), 37-38, 44. "There is a common ground which genuinely, intensively, irrevocably unites the church and the theatre." The three theological truths which form the common ground are creation, incarnation, and the necessity of significant mystery. 53</page><page sequence="4">OLD AND MIDDLE ENGLISH 716. Cottrell, Robert D. "Le Lai du Laistic; From Physicality to Spirituality," Philological Quarterly, XLVII (October 1968), 499-505. Marie de France's Le Lai du Laistic couches her "dialectic love in terms of the theological doctrine of tranr substantiation. . . . Marie has illustrated the transformation of an urgent physical desire into enduring spiritual bond," and this spiritualiza tion of love "is clearly a Christian mode of thought." 717. Hardison, Jr., O.B. Christian Rite and Christian Drama in the Middle Ages : Essays in the Origin and Early History of Modern Drama. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1965. According to Modern Philology, the most important study of medieval drama to appear in thirty years, causing pat notions of medieval drama to undergo radical revision. 718. Patten, Faith H. "Structure and Meaning in The Dream of the Rood," English Studies, XLIX (October, 1968), 385-401. The Dream of the Rood has three parts unified by their common element, the cross. The first part is tropological; the speaker's description of his dream of the rood shows the cross has awakened him to moral consciousness. The second part, spoken by the Rood, tells the relationship of Christ and the cross. This part is allegorical and historical. The third part, spoken by the dreamer and showing everyman's relation to Heaven, is anagogical. This complex but unified structure creates and reveals the poem's meaning, a profound religious truth. 719. Morrell, Minnie Kate. A Manual of Old English Biblical Materials. Knoxville: U. of Tenn. Press, 1965. A compact quide to the Old English transla tions and paraphrases of the Bible and to the scholarly tools available for the study of these works. RENAISSANCE AND ELIZABETHAN 720. Coppedge, Walter Raleigh. "Shakespeare's Oaths 54</page><page sequence="5">and Imprecations," Diss. Abstr.. XXVIII (Jan. 1968), 2643-2644-A (Indiana U.). The oath and the prayer are essentially the same, because both are appeals to a higher power. Swearing in Shakespeare reveals much about the emotional intensity of the scene and about the religious beliefs of the speaker. 721. Elton, William. "King Lear and the Gods: Shakespeare's Tragedy and Renaissance Religious Thought," DA, XXVIII (Jan. 1968), 2680-A (Ohio State). Shakespeare in his extensively duplicated plot presents four dramatically juxtaposed attitudes toward providence: the pious view of virtuous and saved forerunners of Christianity (Cordelia, Edgar); the atheistic (Edmund, Goneril, Regan); the super stitious (Gloucester); the shifting reaction to the ambiguously oriented heavens (Lear). 722. Heninger, S.K., Jr. "Pythagorean Symbol in Erasmus1 Adagia," Renaissance Quarterly, XXI (Summer, 1968), 162-165. Erasmus1 incorporation of the Pythagorean symbols in the Adagia illustrates Erasmus in his role of syncretic humanist, emphasizing the similarity between the classical Pythagorean precept and Christian tenets. SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 723. Ames, Kenneth John. "The Religious Language of Thomas Traherne's Centuries." Diss. Abstr.. XXVIII (Feb. 1968), 3173-A (U. of S.C.). Traherne was a strategist of language to communicate what might otherwise have been an incommunicable vision. His chief strategy was paradox—both a conscious rhetorical technique and a total awareness of multifaceted truths, a discernment of the converging and diverging forces underlying a dynamic universe. 724. Batson, E. Beatrice. "John Bunyan, Conscious Artist," Christianity Today, XIII (December 29, 1968), 10-12. "Through his fascinating story, well-balanced structure, keen depiction of living characters, and skilled handling of allegorical features [dream framework, personifications, dialogues] Bunyan shows his awareness of the artistic demands of 55</page><page sequence="6">imaginative writing. The story of the pilgrimage of Christian ... is a masterpiece from the hand of a conscious artist." 725. Bausum, Henry S. "Edenic Images of the Western World," The South Atlantic Quarterly, LXVII (Autumn 1968), pp. 672-687. An investigation of the relative influences of Peter Martyr's romantic descriptions of the New World and John Smith's more realistic views. "While Martyr's Weltanschauung has undoubtedly been the paramount 'Edenic' influence upon literature, Smith's world view may . . . prove to have had a significant 'Edenic' effect upon theological thought and popular opinion." 726. De Loche, Jr., John Bruce. "Judgment Here: The Homiletic Art of Cyril Tourneur," Diss. Abstr., XXVIII (Jan., 1968), 2678-2679-A (U. of Pittsburgh). Detailed textual analysis of The Revenger's Tragedy and The Athiest1s Tragedy reveals that Tourneur made Christian moralism the source of his organic unity, and the moralism is itself imagina tively energized by the power of his art. Both plays are given remarkable coherence by their exposition of a single, dominant, and unifying theme: damnation as viewed from a literalistic understanding of Christian eschatology. Tourneur contrasts markedly with Shakespeare, whose ethical frame of reference is always secular; but both writers managed to avoid the confusing shifts of moral focus which make organic wholeness so infre quent in Jacobean tragedy. 727. Gray, James Arthur. "The Form and Function of Rhythm in the Versification of Paradise Lost," Diss. Abstr., XXVIII (Nov., 1967), 1785-1786-A (U. of Wash.). Through the slant of narrative and through versification, especially rhythm, Milton has insured that his epic may be properly read. Falling rhythms are associated with Satan; rhythms of stability are characteristic of deity or of figures such as Abdiel who are tempted but remain unshaken. In the Unfällen created world of man, rising rhythms are characteristic, whereas falling 56</page><page sequence="7">rhythms attend the descriptions of man and his world after the Fall. 728. Lytle, Evelyn Pomroy. "Rolim.de Moura's Os Novissimos Do Homem: A Portuguese Biblical Epic," Diss. Abstr., XXVIII (Jan., 1968), 2688-2689-A (Tulane) . Os Novissimos do Homem. published in 1623 by Francisco Child Rolim de Moura, is an heroic poetization of the story of Adam in Genesis 1-3. Unique among epics written either in Portuguese or Spanish between 1572 and 1640, the poem presents the whole theme of man and God's plan for his redemption. Mythological elements and other extra-Biblical materials are assimilated in such a way that there is invariably a correspon dence between them and the Bible. 729. Marilla, E.L. Milton and Modern Man: Selected Essays. U. of Alabama Press, 1968. See book review section. 730. Morris, John W. "Milton and the Imagination of Time," The South Atlantic Quarterly. LXVII (Autumn 1968), pp. 649-658. Paradise Lost was written "for those to whom God's ways need to be justified— for those whose faith has been called into ques tion" and the poem is, therefore, especially timely for most twentieth century readers. The time of the epic is the present because "the temptation, fall, contrition, and consolation of Adam and Eve are the type and figure of the drama that in the Christian view must be enacted in all but the most exceptional souls." 731. Samaha, Jr., Edward Ellis. "The Essential Conflict: Milton's Treatment of Light and Dark as it Culminates in Paradise Regained." Diss. Abstr.. XXVIII (Jan., 1968), 2695-2696-A (Tulane). Milton achieved his metaphor of light-dark dualism by drawing on Manichaeism as well as Platonism, Neoplatonism, and Augustinianism. Though flashes of light are brilliant and darkness intense and oxymoronic in Milton's early major poems, PR presents his most subtle use of light and dark and seems primarily dependent upon the Augustinian principle of inte 57</page><page sequence="8">riorization (or irradiation) for its theological purpose. 732. Stroup, Thomas B. Religious Rite and Ceremony in Milton's Poetry. Lexington: U. of Ken. Press, 1968. 83 pp., $4.50. 733. Teunissen, John James. "Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom: The Book of Job and Milton's Concep tion of Patient Suffering in Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes," Diss. Abstr., XXVIII (Nov., 1967), 1797-A (U. of Rochester). The Book of Job stands with Genesis in its importance to the theory and practice of poetry in the 17th century. In Milton's mind Job, Samson, and Christ were inextri cably linked in a triumvirate of heroically patient sufferers. But because Christ's sufferings in PR provide examples impossible for ordinary humanity to follow, Milton turned in SA to a more human kind of heroism (still based, however, on the Book of Job). Christ in PR can exercise the higher heroism of perfect patience because He has the example of Job provided for Him by His Father; Samson, in a more human way and for Milton in an aesthetically more decorous way, must live and die in ignorance but in faith. EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 734. Salz, Robert David. "'Scope for Wonder and for Love': The Religious Poetry of Christopher Smart," Diss. Abstr.. XXVIII (Jan. 1968), 2694-2695-A (U. of Va.). Smart's religious poems show a coherent evolution in terms of both matter and poetics. NINETEENTH CENTURY 735. Adams, Maurianne Schifreen. "Coleridge and the Victorians: Studies in the Interpretation of Poetry, Scripture, and Myth," Diss. Abstr., XXVIII (Mar. 1968), 3662-2663-A (Indiana Univ.). Germano Coleridgeans were able to follow Coleridge's sym bolic and mythic readings of Scripture; they could divine a myth when they saw one in Livy or in Genesis. But they could not perceive a mythic or 58</page><page sequence="9">symbolic relevance for poetry. When Pater, Dowden, and Symons finally shifted discussions of Coleridge's poetry away from verisimilitude and into quasi symbolic, organic, and psychological readings, they did so by utilizing Coleridge's own criteria and terminology. 736. Alexander , Edward. "Thomas Carlyle and D.H. Lawrence: A Parallel," Univ. Toronto Quarterly, XXXVII (April, 1968) 248-265. Carlyle and Lawrence are united by the ways in which the intellectual confusion in their art led to a moral confusion in their ethical and social philosophies. "To maintain, as the defenders of both men have so often done, that a writer's ideas, beliefs, and opinions are readily separable from his art, or to help retard that reunification of art with truth towards which Carlyle and Lawrence, however blindly, were striving" is to act unjustly. 737. Bush, Sargent, Jr. "The Relevance of Puritanism to Major Themes in Hawthorne's Fiction," Diss. Abstr.. XXVIII (Jan. 1968), 2677-A (U. of Iowa). Hawthorne is no Puritan but there are more fundamental points of relevance than have usually been recognized. 738. Collins, Winston. "Tennyson and Hopkins," Univ. Toronto Quarterly, XXXVIII (October, 1968) 84-95. As social poets both Tennyson and Hopkins reveal similar concern for Victorian themes: the insist ence on duty, work, sacrifice, heroism; the hope that an ideal society would be achieved, and the painful awareness of the evils within their own society; the search for a coherent, purposeful universe ordained and controlled by God; and the concept of the personality as free, distinctive, divine. 739. Crie, Robert D. "The Minister's Black Veil: Mr. Hooper's Symbolic Fig Leaf," Literature and Psychology, XVII (1967), 211-218. The black veil symbolizes the minister's need for protection from the world (now it may no longer see his face) and his total withdrawal from the world (he has "taken the veil"). The veil effectively shields him from 59</page><page sequence="10">the normal demands of both manhood and marriage, and serves to point up his psychological conflict: a sexual maladjustment. 740. Fedeman, William E. "A Sign Betwixt the Meadow and the Cloud: The Ironic Apotheosis of Tennyson's St. Simeon Stylites," Univ. Toronto Quarterly, XXXVIII (October, 1968) 69-95. Application of formalist techniques demonstrates that Tennyson uses paradox, irony, and other hallmarks of "modern" poetry; that "St. Simeon Stylites" is a perfectly conceived and structured poem; and that spiritual pride functions intellectually and spiritually to the undoing of a "saint." 741. Jackson, J.R. "Free Will in Coleridge's Shakespeare," Univ. Toronto Quarterly, XXVIII (October, 1968) 34-50. Lapses or unique readings of the characters of Macbeth and Othello and his unusual view of I.i. of King Lear demonstrate Coleridge's preoccupation with the nature of free will and moral responsi bility. 742. Loucks, James Frederick, II. '"Scripture for his Purpose': A Study of Robert Browning's Use of Biblical Allusions in The Ring and the Book," Diss. Abstr., XXVIII (Mar., 1968), 3676-3677-A (Ohio State). The speakers in the ten interior monologues may be classified by their use of the Bible: the literalists feel too great a reverence for God's word to use it for persuasive or decep tive purposes, while the ironists feel no such compunction and even invent "texts," bogus allusions, inexact analogies, and uncanonical parables for their own purposes. 743. Merton, Thomas. "Blake and the New Theology," The Sewanee Review, LXXVI (Autumn 1968), pp. 673 682. This essay on Thomas Altizer's The New Apocalypse: The Radical Vision of William Blake investigates the poet's role as prophet of present day "Christian atheism." Although Merton takes issue with Altizer on many points, he concludes that "Blake is talking a language similar to that of the radical theologians—and making their own 60</page><page sequence="11">points perhaps better than they do." 744. McMaster, R.D. "Criticism of Civilization in the Structure of Sartor Resartus." Univ. Toronto Quarterly, XXXVII (April, 1968) 266-279. The three chief symbols of SR, the labyrinth, the Satan Prometheus figure, and the phoenix, provide an organic structure that leads inward to the core of Carlyle's meaning. "The three archtypes suggest, first, a spiritual and philosophic situation in history, an imprisonment of the spirit; secondly, an attitude or series of related attitudes toward this desolating situation; and finally, a way through the situation towards freedom and spiritual rebirth." 745. Park, Roy. "Coleridge: Philosopher and Theologian as Literary Critic," Univ. Toronto Quarterly, XXXVIII (October, 1968) 17-33. Coleridge's theory and practice of literary criticism exhibits a distinct change between 1796 and 1818. In his early views he distinguished between philosophical or impassioned poetry as different in kind. He also felt that all great poetry must be taken as philosophical less in the sense of a system of abstract truths and more as an expression of a personal vision. By 1818 Coleridge reverts to his very earliest views of philosophy and poetry as concerned with "the Totality of a System." 746. White, Dana F. "A Summons for the Kingdom of God on Earth: The Early Social-Gospel Novel," The South Atlantic Quarterly. LXVII (Summer 1968), pp. 469-485. A study of Protestant clerical and lay authors from the early 1870's to the mid 1890's who developed "a distinct and peculiar literary form—the social gospel novel." Novelists discussed include Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Albion A. Tourgée, Charles M. Sheldon, and William Dean Howells. TWENTIETH CENTURY 747. Atkins, Anselm. "Mr. Eliot's Sunday Morning Parody," Renascence, XII (Autumn 1968), 41-43, 54. Eliot's poem-prologue has been a parody of lifeless, 61</page><page sequence="12">wordy theology. The spiritual message of that theology, in contrast to the fourth gospel's Prologue, is nil. The last words are thus a dismissal °f theology and its hucksters." Yet this is no excuse to ignore spiritual realities. 748. Blumenthal, Warner. "Sin and Salvation in The Works of Franz Werfel," Diss. Abstr., XXVIII (Jan. 1968), 2674-2675-A (U. of Cal. at Los Angeles). Discusses the three way-stations in Werfel's career: 1911 to 1920 as Paradise Lost, 1920 to 1933 as the period of transition from social humanitarianism to personal experience with God, and 1933 to 1945 as the eternal road, a homecoming to God through sorrow and alienation. 749. Cargas, Henry J. "John Buell: Canada's Neglected Novelist," Renascence, XII (Autumn 1968), 28-31. "John Buell writes more than mysteries—he writes about human love absorbed by Divine Love." The violence his characters suffer "is truly purgative. They are purified in the totally Christian sense." 750. Currie, John Sheldon. "Supernaturalism in Graham Greene: A Comparison of Orthodox Catholicism With the Religious Vision in the Major Novels," Diss. Abstr. . XXVIII (Feb. 1968), 3176-3177-A (U. of Ala.). Greene depends on the doctrines of Original Sin and of Grace, but he also tends toward a natural istic pessimism and determination of character. 751. Detweiler, Robert. Iris Murdoch's The Unicorn. Seabury Press: New York, 1968. This is a mono graph in the Seabury Religious Dimensions in Literature Series. 752. Dinneen, Patricia Marie. "Flannery O'Connor: Realist of Distances," Diss. Abstr., XXVIII (Mar. 1968), 3635-A (Penn. State). Miss O'Connor, like Teilhard de Chardin, has an Incarnational view of reality: because of the union of the natural and supernatural in the person of Christ, everything earthly is significant as a means to fulfilling oneself as a human being and a Christian. Miss O'Connor speaks as a modern Christian humanist on basic human problems. 62</page><page sequence="13">753. Doyle, John Robert Jr. "A Reading of Robert Frost's 1 Directive,'" Georgia Review. XXII (Winter 1968), 501-508. The theme of Frost's "Directive" is "the personal salvation of the individual, a salvation according to the 'directive* of Saint Mark." The later Frost poetry expresses Christian belief. "The younger Frost was correct in speculating that his 'last end would be religious.'" 754. Elliott, George P. "Destroyers, Defilers, and Confusers of Men," Atlantic Monthly, 222 (Dec. 1968), 74-80. Literary nihilism is out of date. Sontag, Lenny Bruce, William Burroughs, and the other destroyers, defilers, and confusers of the State, social order, society, and literature are no longer useful or honest critics. The time has come for a brave new world constructed at least in part by literary positivists. 755. Fitzgerald, Robert. "James Agee: A Memoir," Kenvon Review. XXX, 5, 587-624. 756. Forster, Leonard. "Günter Grass," UTQ, XXXVIII (Oct. 1968) 1-16. Analysis of Günter Grass's literary devices such as the creation of Oskar provides the distance and detachment necessary for the close-up views of World War II Germany. This point of view permits an essential Christian philosophical statement, for "Grass shows charac ters whose equality is that all men are in sin; they are capable of salvation but do not exert their free will in order to attain it or to co operate with Divine Grace. They are unredeemed and indeed uninterested in redemption." 757. Handlin, Oscar. "The Worlds of Arthur Koestler," Atlantic Monthly. 222 (Dec. 1968), 92-96. The intellectual development of Arthur Koestler shows these recurrent themes: "The consequences of man's will to transform society; the nature of his place in the world, and his capacity for rational under standing and action." Koestler's Jewish heritage provided the foundation for these themes. 758. Howard, Thomas. "Homer, Dante, and All That," Christianity Today, XIII (October 25, 1968), 6-7, 9. 63</page><page sequence="14">With a basis of Christian Humanism, the reading of serious literature broadens our awareness of what's at stake in human existence, and may energize in us the faculty of imagination. It may sharpen our consciousness of the original creative energy which moves us toward personhood and concretion. 759. Kunkel, Francis L. "The Dystopia of Harold Pinter," Renascence. XXI (Autumn 1968), 17-20. "In our time, Pinter implies, the family has degenerated into a ghastly institution; men and women are beastly; and so we are faced with a crisis of personhood. Worst of all, perhaps, God is dead. . . . Pinter depicts a nihilistic society that has become post-Christian and post-humanistic; anti theocentric and anti-anthropocentric." 760. Lamar, Lillie B. "Edith Wharton and the Book of Common Prayer," American Notes &amp; Queries, VII (Nov. 1968), 38-39. 761. Montgomery, Marion. "Miss O'Connor and The Christ Haunted," The Southern Review, IV (Summer, 1968), pp. 665-672. Using Miss O'Connor's statement that "while the South is hardly Christ-centered, it is most certainly Christ-haunted" as a springboard, the author attempts to show that O'Connor's works are not existential, Freudian, or nihilistic. Professor Montgomery adds to the Christ-haunted and the Christ-centered a third category of char acters, who predominate in our time: the oblivious, of whom Miss O'Connor was certainly aware but who seldom are the focus of her stories. Her major concern is for the Christ-haunted, who dwell "in the no man's land in which dramatic struggle is possible, between the Christ-centered and the oblivious." 762. Muller, Gilbert Henry. "Flannery O'Connor and the Catholic Grotesque," Diss. Abstr., XXVIII (Feb. 1968), 3193-A (Stanford). Because she knew Catholic fiction was alien to the majority of her readers, O'Connor appealed to her American audience through the shock value of grotesque art. 763. O'Dea, Richard J. "Faulkner's Vestigial Christianity," 64</page><page sequence="15">Renascence, XXI (Autumn 1968), 44-54. Faulkner is Christian because of his emphasis upon "those virtues without which Christianity is impossible." His Christian content lies in 'the cognitive virtue of grasping reality as it is, the acceptance of man as a body-spirit composite, and finally, humility." Faulkner's Christianity "is not dogmatic and assertive but is preparatory and vestigial." 764. Ransom, John Crowe. "T.S. Eliot; A Postscript," The Southern Review, IV (Summer, 1968), pp. 579 597. A reexamination of.Eliot's verse, which Ransom apologizes for having originally under estimated. In discussing religious aspects of Eliot's poetry, Ransom admits his Unitarian views, which he writes, he held "even before I came upon Kant the Transcendentalist, who did not dare make images of the Unknown God." 765. Reynolds, Mary T. "Joyce's Planetary Music: His Debt to Dante," The Sewanee Review, LXXVI (Summer, 1968), pp. 450-477. Though Joyce may be called the Dante of Ireland, he secularized his borrowings from the great Christian poet? nevertheless he considered himself in the tradition of poets like Dante who attempt "to create imaginatively for all ages the world of his own time and the meaning of life as he had learned it." 766. Shorter, Robert N. "Becket as Job: T.S. Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral," The South Atlantic Quarterly, LXVII (Autumn, 1968), pp. 627-635. Becket's decision to become a martyr for the right reason—submission to the will of God—in Part I suggests an analogy between him and Job. In Part II, however, he is elevated to Christ-figure status. 767. Stephens, Martha. "Flannery O'Connor and the Sanctified-Sinner Tradition," Arizona Quarterly. XXIV (Autumn 1968), 223-39. Miss O'Connor is "writing within the sanctified-sinner tradition of modern-day European Christians. ..." (Eliot, Greene, Mauriac). Insistence on her American Southern affinities "has led critics to under 65</page><page sequence="16">estimate the evangelical thrust of her work and the depth of her commitment to orthodox Christian doc trine. ..." 768. Watt, Donald J. "Vision and Symbol in Aldous Huxley's Island." Twentieth Century Literature. XIV (Oct. 1968), 149-60. Huxley insists that a seed of goodness and insight "lies buried within the dark ground of individual consciousness." Thus, "salvation. . . is a process of inward vision . . . . But the modern environment . . . prostitutes the dormant goodness of his nature of false values." It ignores "pacific and mystical values." 769. Webner, Helene L. "Waiting for Godot and The New Theology./' Renascence, XXI (Autumn 1968), 3-9, 31. Beckett's play suggests the kind of religious concept expressed by such modern theologians as Bonhoeffer and Tillich. The anthropomorphic God of western tradition is no longer accessible to modern man. But "a new view of God" is suggested by the Tree—"a god who is the suffering servant, the 'man for others.V 66</page></plain_text>
