<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS wrong approach to religion (e.g. Ribot, Freud, Leuba), for they envisage religion as an aberration, inevitably so when they look only to its bizarre features and ignore its more essential character as an agency of social value and cultural progress. Through the entire book runs the contention that religion and mysticism find prag- matic validation in terms of elevated social values and individual sanity. Of interest to physicists as well as to psychologists is his appeal to "distinguished authorities in modern physics and mathematics" who "now seem to regard consciousness as funda- mental and matter as derivative from consciousness." Accordingly, he relates (p. 269) Jeans' view of the university "as consisting of pure thought" and Eddington's belief that "the stuff of the world is mind stuff" to the Yoga conception of the universe as "mere thought." Let not the reader infer from this review that Professor Mukerjee puts science on a par with mysticism. Despite his readiness to invoke science in defense of mysti- cism, he does not attempt to serve both masters on an equal footing. Mysticism is the preferred master; science belongs to a lower order. Hence the implications of the second law of thermodynamics need provoke no qualms anent personal security. For we find in eastern mysticism "something more than anthropomorphic systematiza- tion;" something which "alone can rescue metaphysics from the crippling effects of the invasion of physical science, and save human souls from the laws governing the motion of electrons and protons or the ceaseless flux of the evolutionary process." Indeed, "science has not always given a true and unfaltering guidance for the direc- tion of human activities along socially desirable channels. Thus, instead of science being called on to advise what expressions of the religious impulse will be permissible, it is upon rleigion that society will have progressively to depend for pulling the chariot of man's destiny along the path of progress." A careful reading of this book has not convinced the reviewer, at least, that mysticism is more dependable than science "for pulling the chariot of man's destiny along the path of progress"-if by "progress" one means escape from obscurantist interpretations. But, then, the reviewer is doubtless seriously deficient in those habits of thought by which mysticism flourishes. Lawrence College J. H. GRIFFITHS Biologische Typen des Menschen und ihr Verhaltnis zu Rasse und Wert. By EDUARD ORTNER. Leipzig, George Thieme, 1937. Pp. 104. An attempt to clarify the ambiguities in Jung's "introversion" and "extraversion" led the author to develop his own schema for classifying human types on the basis of the relation of the organism to the environment, and to coin eight new words to describe his six a priori human types and the two main groups into which he divides them. The first three types adapt their environments to themselves. Dr. Ortner calls them the intrabasal types, in contrast to the last three, or extrabasal types, which become adapted to their environments. For each extrabasal type there is an intrabasal type that contrasts with it in some ways and resembles it in other ways. The whole schema is very pretty-far too pretty to fit the complexities of the actual world of real people. The author identifies his six so-called biological types with the six races described by Ludwig Ferdinand Clauss in Rasse und Seele. He is not disturbed by the fact 190</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS that Clauss's six races include only those of Europe, the Mediterranean, and a part of Asia, whereas his own a priori types seem to exhaust the logical possibilities of classification according to the schema he has adopted. In attempting to account for the origin of Clauss's races, he seeks to derive each of them from some occupational group and the mental and emotional attitudes suited to it. For example, he thinks the Nordic race (corresponding to the type which he calls "extrapetal") is derived from the primitive hunter; the "falische" race of Clauss, corresponding to his own "intraharent" type, is derived from the primitive farmer; the Mediterranean race ("intrafugal" type) from the primitive hand worker; the oriental race ("extrafugal" type) from the nomadic herdsman; the race of Asia minor ("intrapetal" type), including the Jews, from the merchant; and the "ostische" race of Clauss ("intraliquent" type) from the servant, whose sole responsibility is to obey his master. It does not seem to worry the author that even in primitive times such division of labor as there was must have existed among the different individuals of the same race within the same community. In fact, before the time of rapid transportation and mass production, even such geographic specialization of labor as exists today would have been impossible. The author is well aware that his a priori method will meet with little approval from those anthropologists who arrive at their descriptions of human races by averaging individual measurements, but he thinks these "empiricists" are self- deceived. They believe their results are entirely objective because they are based on accurate measurements. Actually, they always have in mind a subjective ideal of racial type on the basis of which they select the individuals they measure. Each of the six races has its own virtues, its own deficiencies, and its own forms of artistic and religious expressions, which the author elaborates in some detail. The book contains 70 illustrations-many of them reproductions of famous works of art-which the author regards as characteristic of the different races. West Springfield, Mass. M. F. MARTIN Caste and Class in a Southern Town. By JOHN DOLLARD. New Haven, Conn., Yale University Press, 1937. Pp. viii, 502. As stated by the author, "the aim of the study is to grasp and describe the emo- tional structure which runs parallel to the formal social structure in the community." The material was collected in a five months residence in a small town in the deep South, by means of collecting life histories of negroes, and by interviews with negroes and whites, and personal observation of their behavior. The relations between the class levels of the two castes is first described and the gains of the white middle class as regards economic advantage, sex relations, and prestige. This with the caste pat- terning in education, politics, and religion, is given as the background for explaining the accommodation attitudes, of negroes, aggression within the negro group, the ag- gression of negroes against whites and of whites against negroes, and the defensive beliefs of the white caste. He then considers the gains of their relationships to the lower-class negroes and ends with a discussion of Class Symbolism and Race Prejudice. As an exposition of the differences in caste relations between each of the different classes of each other and to those of the other caste, and in describing the local mores, the author makes a real contribution to sociological analysis. In his interpretation of emotional reactions and their motivation, one is not sure 191</page></plain_text>
