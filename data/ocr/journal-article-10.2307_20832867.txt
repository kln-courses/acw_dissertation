<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEMANTICS OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN EARLY ISLAM?I SHAMEEM AKHTAR INTRODUCTION There is a varied terminology for international agreements in the classical siyar1 (i.e. International Law) literature of Islam. In the writings of classical masters, like al-Shaybani, Aba Yasuf, Aba 'Ubayd, al-Sarakhsi and Ibn Qudamah, we find juristic precision in the connotations of these terms, which must be the result of a long process of growth. Of course, these terms and their definitions are based on the Qur'an and the Hadith literature. But in the course of historical development and under the pressure of the requirements of the codification of international conduct of those times, their connotations inevitably underwent certain subtle changes. In many cases there was more exact definition and precise differentiation. Some terms became rather obsolete, while others assumed slightly different nuances. The Qur anic (and Hadith) usages are themselves related to, and partly based on, pre-Islamic Arabian?pagan, Jewish and Christian?concepts and connotations of international agreements and their terminology. We intend here to examine the semantic processes of the different terms for international agreements used in the Qur'an and the Hadith literature. It is hoped that a discussion of the subject will be helpful in the better understanding of the evolution of Islamic International Law. I *AHD, MITHAQ, AND KITAB %Ahd and Mithdq Rain, protector of life and something to be eagerly looked for, and its precious water to be jealously looked after, in the waterless desert of Arabia, was called Kahd and %ihad% and the expression rawdah mdhudah meant 'a garden well-watered by rains*. This appears to be the basic concrete concept which gave 'ahd the con notation : 'to protect something (hifz) and to look after it (muraah) from time to time'.2 The meaning was further extended to</page><page sequence="2">82 SHAMEEM AKHTAR connote *a pact'or 'a treaty', for, in the words of Raghib al-Isbahanf, it is incumbent on man to safeguard it and to look after it (yulzamu muradtuhu)? According to Ibn al-Athir, Kahd is a comprehensive term, meaning 'a pledge on oath' (al-yamin)% 'pro tection* (al-aman), 'a guarantee* (al-dhimmah), 'security' (al-hifaz). 'safeguarding the sanctity of a person or a thing* (riayat al hurmah), and 'a testament' (al-wasiyah)* 'Ahd and its derivatives occur on forty odd times in the Qur'an and %ahd is now used as a generic term for international agreements. Mithaq is another term which occurs with some frequency in the Qur'an. It is often used as a synonym of *ahd. For instance, though treaty or pact between Muslims and non-Muslims is more often called %ahd (II : 100 ; III: 77 ; VIII : 56 ; IX : 1,4,7, etc.) , yet sometimes it is also termed mithaq, as in IV : 90, 92 and VIII : 72 ; for Jehovah's covenant with Abraham, Moses and other Jewish prophets the word mithaq is more frequently used (II: 63, 83, 84, 93 ; III: 81, 187 ; IV : 154, 155 ; V : 12, 13, 70 ; VII: 169 ; XXXIII: 7), but in 11:40, 124, 125; VII: 134; XX: 86 these covenants are referred to as %ahd. On the other hand, the following passages show the different shades in the meanings of the two terms : Those who break the pact Cahd) of Allah after making it binding (mithaqihi) and break that which Allah ordered to be joined ... (II: 27 and XIII: 25). ... Such as keep the pact Cahd) of Allah and break not the bond (mithaq) and unite that which Allah has commanded should be joined .. . (LXIII : 20-21). The last parts of the above passages clearly emphasize the primary meaning of the root: w. th. q? viz. "joining together, 'binding'. Wathaq or withdq means 'the rope with which animals are tied' or 'the fetters to bind the prisoners'.5 The Qur an in some places uses the derivatives of w. th. q. for their basic concrete concepts, e.g. And he who rejects false gods and believes in Allah has grasped a firm handhold (bi-l-ur-wati 'l-wuthqa) which will never break. (II: 256) ; Now when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, . . and you have routed them, then bind them with fetters Xfa-shuddu "l-wathdqa) . . . (XLVII: 4) ; and</page><page sequence="3">INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN EARLY ISLAM 83 None bindeth as He then will bind (walayuttequwathaqahu ahad), (LXXXIX: 26). Ibn al-Athir has thus defined mithaq : *ic* 3 C'mithaq is an agreement which is strengthened by oath and pledge").6 But this definition appears to be a late development in the connotation of the word. Qur'anic usage does not validate it. God's %Ahd and Mithaq with Adam and his Progeny Old Testament's Hebrew term berith is a synonym of mithaq and 'ahd. There is some controversy about the root meaning of the Hebrew word, but the more prevalent opinion is that which derives it from the Assyrian barHt% 'bind', whence birittt, 'fetter'.7 Like the Old Testament berith the Qur'anic terms %ahd and mithaq signify both a covenant of God with man and that between individuals or communities. The basic idea of the covenant of God with man is contained in VII : 172 : And (remember) when your Sustainer (Rabb) brought forth from the Children of Adam, from their veins, their seed, and made them testify of themselves (saying) : Am I not your Sustainer? They said : Yes, verily. We testify ... God took upon Himself to be the Sustainer of man, and man on his part testified to acknowledge this Truth. XXXVI: 59 seems to refer to the same covenant, for not being grateful to God, the Bestower and Sustainer of Life, is nothing but "worshipping the devil1'. God also entered into a covenant with Adam that "he and his wife will dwell in the Garden and will eat freely its fruits" and as their part of the agreement they "will not go near the Tree" (II : 35 ; VII : 19). The Quran further says, And verily We made a covenant C^hidna) of old with Adam, but he forgot and We found no constancy in him (XX: 115). In this there was a warning for the progeny of Adam. The conception of religion as a covenant concluded by God with man is peculiarly Jewish. But as the message of Judaism is primarily meant for the Jewish race, we find that while the Old Testament abounds in references to Jehovah's covenant with the Children of Israel and their elders : Abraham, Moses and the Patriarchs, there is no mention of His covenant with human beings other than the "Chosen race" of Israel. However, in the Apocrypha there is a reference to Jehovah's making a covenant of life with Adam (Ecclus. [Sirach] xvii. 12).8</page><page sequence="4">84 SHAMEEM AKHTAR God's Covenant with the Israelites and their Elders There are repeated references in the Qur'an to God's covenant (mtthaq and sometimes kahd) with the Children of Israel and with Abraham, Moses and other Jewish prophets, as has already been mentioned above (p. 82). These statements are in substance parallel to the pronouncements of the Hebrew prophets on the subject as recorded in the Jewish scriptures.9 However, Qur'anic narrations are unique in many respects. First, their pithiness. The Qur'an does not appear to be interested in the details of the story ; it is concerned with its moral only, viz. breaking of covenants brings all moral life to an end, or in the Qur'Sn's words, "makes hearts hard" (V : 13), it "brings God's curse" on the transgressor (ibid.\ and "what could be the reward of those who break covenants save ignominy in the life of the world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be consigned to the most grievous doom." (II: 85) Secondly, the Qur'an is deeply involved in the Prophet's most earnest efforts to form a close alliance with his Jewish neighbours, failing that, to establish some form of peaceful coexistence with them, or at least to find a modus vivendi. But the Jewish arrogance led them to the repeated breaches of solemn pledges, as we shall discuss later on, and thwarted all his efforts for peace. By narrating the earlier instances of Jewish failure to fulfil their covenanted word, the Qur'an wants to give its contemporary happenings an historical depth, so to say. But it is remarkable how the Qur'an does not lose its faith in man despite all the bitterness caused by repeated breaches of pledges, and pleads : You will not cease to discover treachery from all save a few of them. But bear with them and pardon them. Lo ! Allah loves the kindly. (V : 13) Thirdly, what is perhaps most important, the Qur'an emphasizes the principle of reciprocity underlying all agreements. It declares : Fulfil your part of the covenants with Me and I shall fulfil My part of the covenant with you. (II: 80) Recalling God's covenant with Abraham, it says : And (remember) when his Lord tried Abraham with (His) commands, and he fulfilled them, He said : Lo ! I have appointed you a leader for mankind. Abraham said: And of my offspring (will there be leaders)? He said: My covenant includes not wrongdoers. (II: 124)</page><page sequence="5">INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN EARLY ISLAM 85 Again, the Prophet is asked to observe the sanctity of treaty even in respect of those pagans from whom its breach was apprehended : So long as they are true to you, be true to them. (IX : 7) But one-sided pleading is not enough. Sanctions must be made, and political and military power must be built up to see to it that pledges are honoured by the other party as well. They must be made to understand that it always takes two to keep a pledge: And if they break their pledges (ayman) after their treaty Cahd) (has been made with you) and assail your religion, then fight the heads of disbelief?Lo ! they have no binding oaths? in order that they may desist. Will you not fight a folk who broke their solemn pledges (aymdtx), and purposed to drive out the messenger and did attack you first ? What I Fear you them ? Now Allah has more right that you should fear Him, if you are believers. (IX : 12-13) But prevention is better than cure. A host of measures have got to be taken to put teeth in the sanctions for safeguarding the sanctity of an international agreement. These are outlined in some detail in the following : Those of them with whom you made a treaty, and then at every opportunity they break their treaty, and they keep not duty (to Allah). If you come on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that, haply, they may remember. And if you fear treachery from any folk, then throw back to them (their treaty) fairly. Lo ! Allah loves not the treacherous. And let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip (Allah's purpose). Lo ! they cannot escape. Make ready for them all you can of (armed) force and of horses tethered, that thereby you may dismay the enemy of Allah and your enemy, and others beside them whom you know not, Allah knows them. Whatsoever you spend in the way of Allah it will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged. And if they incline to peace, incline you also to it, and trust in Allah. Lo! He is the Hearer, the Knower. (VIII: 56-61) The Old Testament, too, has emphasized the element of reciprocity in the covenant ; for instance, Exod. xxxiv. 11, 14; Deut. xxix. 25-26. But the Jewish priestly hierarchy corroded this all-important element of reciprocity in the connotation of the</page><page sequence="6">86 SHAMEEM AKHTAR Hebrew word berith, over a number of centuries, so much so that, in the words of Rev. A. B. Davidson, "by the time of the Septuagint translation btrith had become a religious term in the sense of a one-sided engagement on the part of God, as in the Pr'estly Narrative and late writings."10 They were so successful that the Greek Bible universally translated the Hebrew word btrith into the Greek friaflV*1? meaning disposition or appointment. St. Paul also employs the term ^ictQ'n'K'q in the sense of an engage ment on the part of God, which is, as he calls it, a promise (Gal. iii. 15-18).11 The Quran set the records straight. It made the Old Testament btrith signify mithaq or 'ahd (covenant) once again, and not ^tatf1?'*1?, or disposition, or appointment or promise as it meant to Rabbi authors of the Priestly Narrative, the Septuagint translators of the Bible, early Fathers of the Christian Church, and the Jewish and Christian neighbours of the Prophet. It was indeed an important contribution of the Qur'an towards the semantics of international agreements. God's covenants with the Muslims In a number of passages, viz. V : 7; IX : 75, 111; XXXIII: 15, 23 ; XLVIII: 10 and LVII: 8, the Qur'an mentions God's covenants with the Muslims. In all the cases these refer to the pacts and oaths of allegiance that the Prophet concluded with his followers at the time of crises ; for instance, on their way to Mecca to offer pilgrimage when it was feared that the Muslim emissary to the Meccans,'Uthm5nb.'Affan, was killed treacherously and a bitter war was thrust upon the Muslims against all their earnest wishes to avoid it; or during their march to Tabak, when Muslims faced the danger of a headlong clash with the powerful Byzantine Empire. These pledges and pacts are called 'covenants ( aW) with God' to emphasize their sanctity.12 XLVIII: 10 makes this point very clear when it says: Lo ! those who swear allegiance unto you (Muhammad) (yubayi'unaka), swear allegiance (yubayiuna) only unto Allah. The Hand of Allah is above their hands. So whosoever breaks his oath breaks it only to his soul's hurt: while whosoever keeps his covenant Cahada) with Allah, on him will He bestow immense reward. The expression "the Hand of Allah is above their hands" suggests an important rite connected with the confirmation of covenants, that is the handclasp. The evolution of the confirmation</page><page sequence="7">INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN EARLY ISLAM 87 rites and their variety presents an interesting study which has some bearing on the semantics too. In primitive times covenants were sealed by the covenanters swallowing a drop of each other's blood. In fact, a number of philologists have derived the Hebrew word berith from barah meaning 'to cut', for the covenanters used to cut into each others arm and suck the blood, the mixing of the blood rendering them 'brothers of the covenant."13 This custom was later refined into the procedure described in Jer. xxxiv. 18-19, when a sacrificial animal was cut into two parts, between which the contracting parties passed, showing thereby that they were bound to each other, or by setting up pillars of stone (Gen. xxxi. 44-48); or by accepting a covenant token of salt (Num. xviii. 19). Hand, too, took a part in these confirmation rites : putting the hand under the thigh (Gen. xxiv. 2, xlvii. 29), raising the hand (Gen. xiv. 22 ; Dan. xii. 7; Rev. x. 5-6) and handclasp (2 Kings x. 15 ; Prov. vi. 1; Ezek. xvii. 18) played an important part in these rites. The Arabs, like all Semites, were familiar with these customs ; a confederacy (hilf) was formed while the Prophet was still young, which was known as'the blood-lickers' confederacy1 (hilf Idiqat al-dam), while their adversaries, among whom was the tribe of the Prophet himself, were called fyilf al-mutayyibin 'confederacy of the scented ones', for they had substituted a bowl of perfume for the plate of blood. (We shall describe these confederacies in greater detail in the Section on Hilf). It is remarkable how the Qur'an abolished all these rites, except the handclasp, a universal custom which was prevalent among the Romans, Greeks, Hebrews and most other peoples of antiquity, as it is with most modern ones.14 The expression yubdytun, in the above-quoted passage of the Qur'an, derived from bay1 meaning 'sale', also deserves notice. (Bay ah, 'oath of fealty to a king or a spiritual leader' is wellknown). Reciprocity is so dominant a theme with the Qur'anic concept of covenants that even oaths of allegiance are considered to be a two-sided contract, a deed of sale. The imagery of a bargain is well depicted in the following passage of the Qur'an: Lo! Allah has bought from the believers their lives and their wealth because the Garden will be theirs: they shall fight in the way of Allah and shall slay and be slain. It is a promise (ua'dan) which is binding on Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur'an. Who fulfils His covenant Cahd) better than Allah? Rejoice then in your bargain that you have made,</page><page sequence="8">88 SHAMEEM AKHTAR for that is the supreme triumph. (IX: 111) %Ahd and mzthaq do not merely signify God's covenant with man, but, as we pointed out earlier, like the Hebrew berith they also mean covenants between men, treaties or pacts. Quranic passages describing *ahd and mithaq between men can be divided into three categories : GO those related to Muslims' treaties with the Jews; (fc) those concerning Muslims' treaties with the pagan Arabs ; and (c) treaties in general. Muslims' treaties with the Jews There lived in Medina a resourceful Jewish community which was a force to be reckoned with in the local politics. The exodus of the Jews to Arabia started in the early Christian century. Some of the early settlers were the Jews who had been expelled from Judea by Hadrian and Trajan while others are said to have been the Edomites from Nabata.15 According to al-Samhudl, there were twenty Jewish tribes in Yathrib and were in possession of a number of strongholds.16 But modern scholarship maintains that there were only three authentic Jewish tribes in Yathrib, namely, Band Nadir, BanQ Qurayzah and BanQ Qaynuqa'; however, there were a good many tribes of Arab extraction who had embraced Judaism.17 The Jews were politically and economically dominant in Yathrib at the time when the Aws and the Khazraj came there from the south. BanQ Nadir and BanQ Qurayzah allied themselves with the Aws while Banu Qaynuqa* became the allies of the Khazraj. At the time of the advent of Islam, Jewish political influence had declined and Yathrib was politically controlled by the warring Aws and Khazraj tribes. The Prophet's coming to Yathrib brought to an end the long internecine feud between the Aws and the Khazraj in which their respective Jewish allies also used to take part. He also established a brotherhood (muahkdh) between the local tribes now designated Ansar, 'the Helpers', and the Meccan Muslim immigrants, the Muhajirun. This now left the Jewish community. To bring them also in the Ummah, the community, that was thus formed in Yathrib,?which was now Madinat al-Nabz, the City of the Prophet, or simply al-Madinah, the City,?the Prophet entered into a covenant?or most probably a series of covenants, which were amalgamated into one by the later chronicles?with the Jews, independently or through their Aws or Khazraj allies.18 Covenant</page><page sequence="9">INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN EARLY ISLAM 89 of Medina is a fascinating subject, but it is beyond the scope of the present paper to discuss the different aspects of this wonderful document, the like of which is not known in religious history. Here we would like to discuss only the Qur'anic references to this covenant in their semantic and necessary historical contexts.19 The first reference to the Covenant Cahd) of Medina occurs in II: 84*85, where the Jews are chastised for having fought, exiled, slain, and made captives of each other as the allies of the warring Arab clans, before the coming of the Prophet to that city. His advent brought peace among them and stopped all bloodshed. Peace it was, but it was an uneasy peace. The Jews had found in the nascent Muslim society a common object of hatred. Prophet's efforts to enter into an alliance with them proved futile right from the outset. II: 100, which was revealed at the same time as the above-mentioned passage reads : Is it so that whenever you (Jews) make a covenant Cahd) a party of you set it aside ? The truth is, most of them believe not.20 The crucial Battle of Badr clearly showed that the Jews could not be the faithful allies of the Muslims, let alone be a part of their Ummah as envisaged by the Covenant of Medina. Subsequent events of teasing the Muslims and of attempting to molest a Muslim lady, committed by the BanQ Qaynuqa' Jews forced the Prophet to ask them to vacate Medina with their belongings except their arms. VIII: 55-64, revealed about this time, shows that the covenant was at its breaking point. Henceforth efforts had to be directed towards forging effective sanctions behind the covenant by inflicting exemplary punishments on the defaulters and by bringing about greater cohesion among the Muslims, the real bulwark of the rising Ummah. The passage which has already been quoted on p. 85, gives the necessary instructions. After the Muslims received a set-back at Uhud, the Jews became still more restive and the incident connected with the collection of the blood-money of two clients of the Muslims, showed the depth of their hostility to Islam and its Prophet. Jews of the BanQ Nadir, who were the culprits this time, planned to kill the Prophet and escape the payment of the small amount of blood money, which, in fact, they had outwardly agreed to pay. An obvious reference to this incident is in III: 77, where the Jews are accused of "selling the covenant Cahd) of Allah for a small pot of</page><page sequence="10">90 SHAMEEM AKHTAR money (thamanan qalilan)". Now, BanQ Nadir had to be given an exemplary chastisement for their breach of faith. They were not only exiled but had also to lose their property. (The stern terms of their punishment and subsequent and related matters are detailed in LIX : 2-17). BanQ Nadir took their frightful revenge. They went first to the leaders of Quray?h in Mecca and then to the chiefs of the desert tribe of Ghatafan, urging them to extirpate the Muslims and promising them help from the Jewish population of Ya?hrib. As a result of their efforts, Quraysh with all their clans, and Ghatafan with all their clans, altogether making a formidable army of 10,000, marched to destroy Medina. The Prophet having dug a trench (adopting the military tactics of the Persians) prepared for a long siege. It was, indeed, the hardest trial yet for the young and struggling Muslim society. In the words of the Qur an, it was the time : When they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when eyes grew wild and hearts reached to the throats, and you were imagining vain thoughts concerning Allah. There were the believers sorely tried and shaken with a mighty shock. (XXXIII : 10-11). At this time of crisis, BanQ Qurayzah, the only Jewish tribe left in Medina, were lying in wait to pounce upon the Muslims in the event of their "certain" defeat at the hands of the united might of the Arab clans ("lal-ahzab")But they were sorely disappointed. The digging of the trench, an altogether new defence stratagem for the Arabs, proved an insurmountable barrier to them ; long days and nights of siege without any bravado of pitched battles familiar to them brought ennui and the resultant discontent and discord among their ranks (which the Muslims did not fail to exploit); and on top of all came a fierce, bitter wind from the sea which blew for three days and nights so furiously that they could not keep a shelter up, or light a fire, or boil a pot. The Quraysh raised the siege in disgust, followed by the Ghatafan and all their clans. On their return from the Battle of the Trench, the Muslims laid the siege of the traitorous BanQ Qurayzah in their towers of refuge. It lasted for twenty-five days. At the end they surrendered. Their case was laid before BanQ Aws who were their allies for many genera tions before Islam. The Prophet wanted the original inhabitants of Medina whose life and security was so very much jeopardized by the Jewish tribe to share the responsibility of the decision taken in this</page><page sequence="11">INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN EARLY ISLAM 91 respect and, in any case, Banu Aws, old allies of BanQ Qurayzah, could intercede on their behalf according to the old Arab custom, as, indeed, they are reported to have done. Thus, Sa'd b. Mu'adh, the chief of the Aws tribe of Medina and a lifelong ally and friend of the Jews of Banu Qurayzah, was made the arbitrator of their fate. And he gave his judgement strictly according to the Mosaic Law, which he appears to have known through his long association with the Jews. The Mosaic Law on the subject is as follows : When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it. And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee. And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it: And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword : But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the Lord thy God hath given thee. (Deut. xx. 10-14). It was a very harsh and stern judgement, indeed, which Sa'd b. Mu'adh pronounced on Banu Qurayzah and the bitter irony of it was that in doing so he merely carried out the injunctions of the Mosaic Law up to the hilt I It was a sad day for the evolution of the concept of international agreements as well, for the elimination of Banu Qurayzah brought to an an end the Prophet's efforts at evolving 'ahd into a permanent community (ummah) of diversified (in this case racially as well as religiously) and autonomous groups on a strict basis of reciprocity. The failure of the Covenant of Medina had a great impact on the semantic evolution of 'ahd and kindred concepts, in the early history of Islam, which is usually ignored while discussing the related laws of the Fiqh on the subject. We feel that an analysis of the causes of its failure will be useful towards the appreciation of the subsequent semantic history of these terms. We think that the first reason for the failure was the presence of an element among the Jewish Rabbis who disapproved the very idea of concluding a covenant with the Gentiles. They seem to have derived their authority from such texts, as Exod. xxiii. 32, xxxiv. 12 ; and Deut. vii. 2. "The covenant concluded by</page><page sequence="12">92 SHAMEEM AKHTAR Solomon with Hiram (1 Kings vi. 26) and those between Israel and the Kings of Syria or Assyria and Babylonia (1 Kings xv. 19;Hosea xii. 2; Ezak. xvii. 13), were therefore fraught with evil, nor could the covenant of Simon Maccabeus with Rome (1 Mace. xiv. 24etseq) meet with any thing but disapproval on the part of the Pharisees."21 Even Abraham who made a covenant with the pagan Abimelech (Gen. xxi. 27) was severely censured for it (Tanna Eliyahu R. vii.; Yalk., Gen. 95). The Qur'an refers to this group of Jews, when it says: And among them there is he who, if you trust him with a piece of gold, will not return to you unless you keep standing over him. That is because they say : We have no duty to the Gentiles (al-ummiyin). (Ill : 75). But there must be a number of them who must have recognized the similarity between the Arabian Prophet and the fore most among the biblical prophets?-those of whom the Quran says : They recognize him as they recognize their sons (II : 146). On account of this very similarity these Jews associated his covenant with the covenant of Abraham, which was sealed through a sacrificial rite in which certain animals were slain and divided into their parts, the corresponding parts being placed opposite each other with a space between. At nightfall there passed between the pieces a smoke as of a furnace and a burning lamp. (Gen. xv. 9-17). The smoke and flame was a symbol of the Divine Being who signified by His presence the acceptance of the sacrifice and the sealing of the covenant. A reference to this group of the Jews is made in the Qur'an in III: 183. They are said to have demanded "to bring us an offering which fire (from heaven) shall devour." But how could the Prophet acquiesce in such a "strongly anthropomorphic"22 conception of sacrifice, when the Qur'an had declared : Their flesh and their blood reach not Allah, but the devotion from you reaches Him (XXII: 37). The disappointment of this appreciative and sensitive group of the Jews must be immense. There was a semantic gap between the Prophet and them, when they talked of covenants, which proved to be unbridgeable. The most important reason for this failure was the Jewish arro gance: their presumption of being?to quote the Qur'an?"sons of Allah and His loved ones" (V: 18). This was based on the semantic "tahrzf" (changing words from their contexts) which the Jewish hierarchy had committed in the connotation of the Hebrew word</page><page sequence="13">INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN EARLY ISLAM 93 berith which we have already discussed above. The people who con sidered themselves the recipients of a one-sided engagement on the part of God could not observe reciprocity in man-made agreements. Muslims' treaties with the pagan Arabs There was an open conflict with the pagan Arabs. After the migration from Mecca ail avenues for seeking a basis for co-existence?"Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion" (CIX: 6)?with them were closed. Subsequently, the battles of Badr, Uhud and al-Ahzab had aggravated the mutual bitterness. Despite all this, the Prophet sought the earliest opportunity to make a truce (hudnah) with the Meccans and the occasion came at the time of al-Hudaybiyah, which the Prophet utilized to the utmost. Without going into the details of the Treaty of al-Hudaybiyah and the events that preceded and followed it, we would like to mention a few points of semantic interest : (i) The Treaty is called aUhudnah% meaning 'a truce1 (which, in fact, it was) by all the later writers,23 but the Qur'an in all its references to this Treaty calls it an 'ahd, see IX : 1, 4 and 7, while the text of the Treaty, as recorded in the Hadith literature, has the word sulh and its derivative s.alaha.2* We shall discuss this point later, on its proper occasion. (if) The Prophet did not make a permanent treaty Cahd) with the Pagans. Perhaps the experience of the Covenant of Medina was not very encouraging and, of course, the Meccans themselves were not in a mood to enter into any truce, let alone a long-term peace treaty. The document itself being of a legal nature keeps the distinction between sulfy and 'ahd. This may be the explanation for one of the points raised in the preceding paragraph. (tit) The Prophet's insistence on strict adherence to the terms of the treaty, however unfavourable to oneself they may be, is illustrated by the well-known events that followed immediately after the signing of the treaty. Treaties and contracts in general The Quran uses the term "ahd not only for treaties but also for contracts between individuals. There are a number of passages where either or both of them could be meant, viz. [The righteous are . . ] those who keep their Qahd) treaty (or contract) when they make one. (II: 177)</page><page sequence="14">94 SHAMEEM AKHTAR And if you give your word, do justice thereunto, even though it be against a kinsman ; and fulfil the covenant of Allah. (VI: 153) Fulfil the covenant of Allah when you have covenanted. (XVI : 91) Come not near the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better till he comes to strength; and keep the covenant. Lo ! of the covenant it will be asked. (XVII: 34) Successful indeed are the believers ... And those who keep their pledges and their covenants (XXIII : 1-8 and LXX : 32) It may be noted that these general treaties and contracts too are sanctified and called the covenants of Allah. The term mitkaq is used for the marriage contract in IV : 21 (cf. Prov. ii. 17 ; Mai. ii. 14). Kitdb Kitdb from the root fe. t b. meaning 'to write1 is the obvious synonym for 'ahd. The Qur an insists on all business contracts being duly written and witnessed (II: 282-83). The international agreements would then, of course, be invariably written and wit nessed. So are all the peace documents of early Islam whose complete texts have reached us. The Qur'an in one instance uses the term mithdq al-Kitdb "covenant of the book" in relation to the Sinaitic Covenant (VII: 169), which reminds one of the expression "the book of the covenant" used in the same context in Exod. xxiv. 7. In the Hadith literature kitdb and its derivative (haghd ma) kataba are most often used in place of 'ahd. The Covenant of Medina begins with the sentence Hddhd kitdbun min Muhammad... (This is the writing from Muhammad .. . ) Similar patterns are found in, e.g. Documents Nos. 19, 32, and 41, in the excellent and well-documented collection of such treaties by Dr. Muhammad Hamidullah : Majmuat aUWathaiq al-Siydsiyah, references to which have already been made in the notes that follow. NOTES I, Siyar is the plural of sirah meaning 'conduct', hence 'the conduct of the ruler in time of war and peace. Later, the term was adopted for International Law.

For instance, cf. the Qur'an II: 83-84 ; V : 70 with I Kings xix, 10 ; Jer. xxxi. 32. The Qur'an mentions in a few places how God caused the Mount to tower above the Children of Israel at the time of the Sinaitic Covenant (II : 63, 93 : IV : 154) ; this has a parallel in the Mishnah, which reads as follows : 'And they stood at the nether part of the mount' [Exod, xix, 17], said R. Abdimibar Hana, From this expression we learn that God suspended the mount over them as a bat, and said to them : If you accept the Torah, it is all right, if not, you will find here your tomb.'

On the subsequent pages, besides the Qur'an we have relied mainly on Ibn Ishaq's Sir ah as recorded by Ibn Hisharn and al-Tabari. 20. It appears to us that this passage of the Qur'an shows that there were a number of treaties with the Jews and not just one as upheld by the classical writers. 21.
