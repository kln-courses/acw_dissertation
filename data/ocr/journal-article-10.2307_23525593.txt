Laundré, University of Wisconsin Press, Madison. Paperback, $24.95. 200 p. ISBN 978-0-299-28754-2. 2012. No species has generated such fervor or interest in the Midwestern United States as North America's largest obligate carnivore, the cougar (Puma concolor). Extirpated from most of their former eastern range by the 1880s, cougars have long been absent from much of this region. However, recent confirmations of individuals in several states have suddenly displaced the search for a mythical creature with avid discussions of the real likelihood for and potential repercussions of their return. Evidence of successful eastward movements by dispersing cougars raises the issues of how they might return and what will happen when they do reside in a landscape vastly changed by human population growth and development (LaRue et al., 2012). This same region challenges prediction due to the paucity of science conducted prior to its transformation from vast prairies into intensively utilized farmlands and growing cities. In Phantoms of the Prairie, the Return of Cougars to the Midwest, cougar biologist John Laundré provides a timely synthesis of what we know from the past about cougars in this region, what we currently know about cougars in the west; then speculates on what might occur as they move eastward into this new environment. In the brief introduction, Laundré begins by defining his approach and delimiting the region for discussion. Rather than attempt to cover the vast extent of 'prairie ecosystems' the focus is drawn to a modified 'Midwest' including Midwestern (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois), a southern (Arkansas), and Great Plains (North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas) states. The first chapter summarizes historical accounts of former cougar presence in this region. This is followed by a description of cougar ecology, including speculation on the ecological role of cougars in prairie ecosystems. After laying this foundation, the next two chapters take an exhaustive look at potential cougar habitat in each state in the region. First, predictions are made on where cougar might find suitable habitat to form populations. Then, by use of a 'virtual tour,' Laundré imagines where individual cougars may wander. By combining the predicted movement with recent data on where cougars have been found (e.g., road-killed mortality), Laundré qualitatively predicts the likelihood of cougar travelling specific routes through this region. Having established a broad biological basis for cougar movement, he then uses the fifth chapter to explicitly address the political and sociological challenges for cougar to recolonize the Midwest. The first part of this chapter clearly differentiates the real versus perceived threat of cougars to humans, livestock, and deer, while the latter half includes an evaluation of how people might respond to cougars. The last chapter briefly highlights the same set of factors that cougars may face moving further eastward. Throughout the text the tone is descriptive, in parts perhaps overly anthropomorphic, but overall passionate about the potential for the return of cougars to the Midwest and Eastern United States. Bold ideas and direct statements, especially in Chapter 5 are certain to ignite heated discussion, for example, over the role of state wildlife management agencies in the issuance of policy regarding cougars. For the researcher, the science is presented with a broad brush backed by a lean citation list, given the greater than 370 scientific papers already published on cougars. Throughout the text Laundré draws heavily from his own extensive research primarily based in southern Idaho. For those interested in the details, one could question how applicable our understanding of cougars from 'western' environments may be in predicting their use of Midwest prairies or contending with developed cities. Explicit review of what we have learned from the few studies already conducted in or near urban environments or those with considerable grasslands (e.g., Dickson et al., 2005; Sweanor et al., 2008) may have strengthened these sections. The adaptability of cougars to use a wide variety of landscapes from deserts to rainforests, the northern Rockies to southern Chile, suggest there is much we still do not know about the species. This would also caution against firm predictions for how cougars may use novel environments. However, from the outset Laundré prefaced, that the book is not meant to be a "hard scientific work." Rather, it was written for everyone ... who is interested in what is happening with cougars in the Midwest." For this larger audience, rather than providing an extensive review or evaluation of the scientific literature, Laundré selectively distills the latest research to familiar terms. In this he largely succeeds, painting a clear picture of cougar ecology. Similarly, the extensive use of metaphors and 402</page><page sequence="2">2013 Book Review 403 attempts to view the world from a cougar's eyes may provide greater lay understanding—despite the discomfort they may raise for the scientist. With this in mind, and the lack of pre-colonial scientific data on cougars in the Midwest, it is useful to recall Darwin's statement to Wallace in 1857: "I am a firm believer that without speculation there is no good and original observation." As we observe the return of cougars to the Midwest, Phantoms of the Prairie provides fertile ground for speculation, for wildlife biologists, outdoor enthusiasts, hunters and naturalists alike.
