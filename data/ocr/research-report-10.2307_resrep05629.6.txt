He was  killed during a June 2004 raid connected to the investigation of American contractor Paul  Johnson who was kidnapped and killed by Saudi mujahidin. He is reported to have fought in  Afghanistan, Spain, Algeria, Somalia, Ethiopia and Bosnia-Herzegovina before returning to  Saudi Arabia.     He was captured in Ethiopia in the late 1990s, and was extradited to Saudi Arabia where he  served four years in prison.               Name:  `Abd al-`Aziz b. Salih al-Jarbu`   Name (Arabic):  عوبرجلا حلاص نب زيزعلا دبع   Aliases:     Aliases (Arabic):   NO   Born:  ? IMAGE  Died:  ?  Country of Origin:  Saudi Arabia    Background:      Closely associated with `Ali al-Khudayr, Nasir al-Fahd, and `Uyayri, all Saudi disciples of  Hammud b. `Uqla' and supporters of Bin Ladin and Zawahiri. He, along with most of this  group, were imprisoned by Saudi authorities in late 2001, and were held until 2003.  On 28  February 2003, the Saudi Islamist researcher Mansur al-Nuqaydan published an article in al- Watan about the radical currents in Saudi Islamism, from which I quote a few paragraphs:     In the mid-1990s the Saudi Government detained a number of opposition Islamists who had  provoked a riot in Baridah. They stormed the provincial government's offices and held sit- ins in the mosques. During their detention at the famous Al-Hayir Jail, a disagreement and a  schism occurred between the first and second classes of religious students. The dispute was  over what kind of attitude the detainees should adopt versus the government and the  employees of the Criminal Investigation Department from the most senior to the very  lowest officials.   282 </page> <page sequence="6">   Al-Hayir Jail held two types of Islamists: the Resurgent activists and the new Salafis. The  new Salafis were led by Shaykh Muhammad al-Farraj and his group, who were serving long  prison sentences in connection with another case that occurred prior to the Baridah  incidents. Included in this group was Shaykh Nasir Bin-Hamad al-Fahd and `Abd-al-Aziz al- Jarbu`, both of whom represented the movement's hard-line wing. Today these two men are  viewed as symbols of the jihadist Salafi movement in Saudi Arabia.    When Shaykh Ali-Bin Khudayr al-Khudayr, who was among the detainees in the wake of the  Baridah incidents, met with the other Islamists, a new alliance was forged and as a result a  new schism occurred inside Al-Hayir Jail. This schism was the first spark and nucleus that  formed a new very hard-line stream [tayyar takfir] prepared to brand other Muslims as  infidels. At a later stage it surfaced and conducted its activities publicly by issuing statements  and religious rulings [fatwas] branding other people as infidels. These fatwas were issued  every now and then under the sponsorship of Shaykh Humud b. `Uqla al-Shu`aybi and with  his blessing. After al-Shu`aybi's death, al-Fahd and al-Khudayr became the leaders of this  stream.    The new Salafi movement followed the example of Shaykh Ibn-Baz and other Wahhabite  [reference to 18th-century founder of puritanical Islamic movement Shaykh Muhammad b.  `Abd al-Wahhab] clerics. It also relied on the opinions and religious interpretations of the  late Hadith [tradition and sayings of the prophet] scholar Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani.  The al-Suwaydi neighborhood in the city of Riyadh was the base that this stream used. This  movement conducted a thorough search of Wahhabite heritage and examined the fatwas of  former Wahhabite clerics on the question of the conditions for declaring a Muslim an infidel  and on the question of what conditions needed to be fulfilled for a Muslim population to  rebel against their Muslim ruler. This search gave the movement a new interpretation of the  issues in question and provided it with a lethal weapon that it used against the government.  It then declared that the government was an infidel government.    The credit for this development goes to two persons. The first was Muhammad al-Maqdisi, a  Palestinian who lived in Kuwait, who was subsequently deported to Jordan after Kuwait's  liberation from Iraqi occupation. The second was Al-Barqawi, the author of the famous  book "The Manifest Proofs of the Disbelief of the Saudi State" [al-kawashif al-jaliyah fi takfir  al-dawlah al-sa'udiyah]. Al-Barqawi's dissertation "The Nation of Ibrahim" is regarded as the  constitution of the repudiators [takfiris], that is, those who accuse others of apostasy.  Informed sources say that this dissertation is actually a commentary on an old dissertation by  Juhayman al-Utaybi [leader of rebellious group that invaded and seized Mecca's Grand  Mosque in November 1979] on the same subject.    Notes:    Author of an oft-cited post-9/11 tract, "The Foundations of the Legality of the Destruction  that Befell America," (published in November 2001; also sometimes called "Basing the  Religious Legitimacy of Destroying America")  in which he argued that Usama b. Ladin was  the rightful inheritor of the legacy of Ibn `Abd al-Wahhab.  It also famously argues for the  legitimacy of killing women, children and the elderly in the course of jihad.  He is also  credited with a radd (denunciation) of Salman al-`Awda.   283 </page> <page sequence="7">     Name:  `Abd al-`Aziz b. Baz  Name (Arabic):  زاب نب زيزعلادبع  Aliases:    Aliases (Arabic):    Born:  1909?  Died:  1999  Country of Origin:  Saudi Arabia    Background:      One of the most prominent figures of the Saudi Salafi establishment. Bin Baz was born in  Riyadh and served as Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia from 1993 until his death in 1999. He  was President of the Islamic University of Medina, one of the elite Salafi Islamic institutions  in Saudi Arabia, until 1971. Four years later, he was appointed to the ministerial rank of chair  of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Fatawa (al-lajna al-da’ima li’l-buhuth al- `ilmiyya wal-ifta’), from which he issued thousands of fatwas.    Bin Baz lost his eyesight at the age of 20, and studied under Mauritanian Wahhabi/Maliki  Shaykh al-Shinqiti (d. 1973) and Muhammad b. Ibrahim Al al-Shaykh (d. 1969).  He was  widely criticized for his ongoing support of the al-Sa`ud family during the first Gulf War,  which began to erode not only his own legitimacy (especially in the eyes of the Salafi-jihadi  movement) but also that of the Saudi Salafi establishment. Many of the most prominent  figures of the contemporary Saudi establishment were his students or followers.    In 1996, Usama b. Ladin labeled Bin Baz a puppet of the Saudi regime and told Muslims that  Bin Baz had written "a Fatwa to hand over Palestine to the Jews, and before this, to permit  entry into the country of the two sacred mosques to the modern day crusaders under the  rule of necessity" (al-Nida magazine).     Notes:    He was famously involved in a controversy surrounding his fatwa that the earth is flat. Bin  Baz's position—based on his interpretation of the Qur'an—is not that the earth is flat, but  that the earth is a globe at the center of the universe with the sun and moon revolving  around it.                         284 </page> <page sequence="8"> Name:  `Abd al-Akhir Hammad al-Ghunaymi  Name (Arabic):  يمينغلا دامح رخلآا دبع   Aliases:     Aliases (Arabic):     Born:   NO   Died:   IMAGE  Country of Origin:  Egypt    Background:      A prominent shaykh and former member of the senior leadership council of the Egyptian  Jama`a al-Islamiyya (al-Gama`a al-Islamiyya bi-Misr).  He currently resides in Bonn,  Germany, under political asylum (since the year 2000).  He is near the top of Egypt’s Most  Wanted list, as he was one of the earliest Jama`a members to go to Afghanistan to join the  anti-Soviet jihad and was among those sentenced to death (in absentia) in the so-called  “returnees from Afghanistan” mass trials of 1992 in Egypt.  His position with regard to the  Jama`a’s use of violence is complicated; in a televised discussion in 2002 (see  http://www.aljazeera.net/Channel/archive/archive?ArchiveId=90921) he implied that the  Egyptian government was the party that needed to first forego human rights abuses against  Jama`a members and other Islamists in prison before resisters could be reasonably asked to  foresake the use of force, pointing specifically to torture and the absence of due process in  the imprisonment of Jama`a activists in Egypt.  However, when Ayman al-Zawahiri  announced that a large portion of the Jama`a had allied itself with al-Qa`ida, `Abd al-Akhir  denied this.  (The official position of the Jama`a is that it has foresaken the use of violence,  though `Abd al-Akhir is no longer an official representative of that organization.)    Notes:    Two of his works are included in the jihadi suggested reading list provided by Ibn Ahmad al- Salim in the latter’s 39 Wasilat li-khidmat al-jihad wa’l-musharaka fihi (“39 Ways to Serve and  Participate in Jihad”), one under jihadi fiqh (Ghunaymi’s Marahil tashri` al-jihad) and one  under jihadi ideology [fikr] (Ghunaymi’s Waqafat ma`a al-Albani).    In a videotaped address aired by al-Jazira on 9 August 2006, Ayman al-Zawahiri announced  that a significant part of the membership of al-Jama`a al-Islamiyya bi-Misr (the Egyptian  Gama`at al-Islamiyya) had allied themselves with al-Qa`ida.  In that address Zawahiri named  `Abd al-Akhir Hammad as one of the the principal leaders of this al-Qa`ida-allied section of  the Jama`a (the others being Muhammad al-Islambuli and Muhammad Mustafa al-Muqri).   In a subsequent interview with al-Jazira from Germany, however, `Abd al-Akhir denied that  he or the Jama`a in general had joined al-Qa`ida, saying that some members did so as a  purely personal decision.               285 </page> <page sequence="9"> Name:  `Abd Allah `Azzam  Name (Arabic):  ماّزع اللها دبع  Aliases:    Aliases (Arabic):    Born:  1941  Died:  1989  Country of Origin:  Palestine    Background:      Chief mujahid ideologue in Afghanistan.  The following profile is by Col. Jonathan Fighel of  the Israeli Institute for Counter-Terrorism (with transliterations changed for the sake of  consistency):     `Abd Allah Yusuf `Azzam was born in the village of Seelet Al-Hartiyeh, in the province of  Jenin in the West Bank in 1941. He received his early elementary and secondary education in  his village, and continued his education at the agricultural Khadorri College near Tul Karem,  where he obtained a Diploma. After graduating from Khadorri College, `Azzam worked as a  teacher in a village called Adder in southern Jordan, and later enrolled in Shari`a College at  Damascus University, where he obtained a B.A. Degree in Shari`a (Islamic Law) in 1966.     After the 1967 war, in which Israel conquered the West Bank from Jordan, Shaykh `Abd  Allah `Azzam immigrated to Jordan. There, in the late 1960’s, he joined the jihad against the  Israeli occupation. Soon afterwards, he traveled to Egypt and graduated with a Masters  Degree in Shari`a from the University of al-Azhar.     In 1970 Jordanian forces expelled the PLO militants from Jordan. This effectively ended the  jihad against Israel from Jordanian territory, and Shaykh `Azzam took up a teaching position  in the Jordanian University in `Amman. In 1971 he was awarded a scholarship to al-Azhar  University in Cairo, eventually obtaining his Ph.D in Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence (usul  al-fiqh) in 1973.     Shaykh `Abd Allah `Azzam spent many years involved in the Palestinian jihad. However, he  eventually came to believe that those involved in the jihad were too far removed from “the  real Islam.” For this reason, he turned his back on Jordan and his home in the West Bank,  and traveled to Saudi Arabia, where he took up a university teaching position. Shaykh  `Azzam became convinced that only by means of an organized military force would the  Umma (Islamic nation) emerge victorious. He became preoccupied with religious warfare:  “Jihad and the rifle alone: no negotiations, no conferences and no dialogues.”     In an attempt to practice what he preached, Shaykh `Abd Allah `Azzam became one of the  first Arabs to join the Afghan jihad against the Soviet forces, who invaded Afghanistan in  1979. He left his teaching position at King `Abd al-`Aziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,  and traveled to Islamabad, Pakistan, to be close to the Afghan jihad. There, he became  acquainted with the leaders of the jihad. During his initial time in Pakistan, `Azzam was  appointed a lecturer at the International Islamic University in Islamabad. However, he  eventually resigned this position in order to devote all his time to the jihad in Afghanistan.    286 </page> <page sequence="10">   In the early 1980’s, Shaykh `Abd Allah `Azzam immigrated with his family to Pakistan in  order to be closer to the fighting. Soon after, he moved from Islamabad to Peshawar to be  even closer to the front lines. In the jihad, he said, he found the “satisfaction of his longing  and untold love to fight in the Path of Allah”.     In Peshawar `Azzam founded the Bayt al-Ansar (Mujahidin Services Bureau), with the aim  of offering all possible assistance to the Afghani jihad and the mujahidin. The bureau’s  mission was to establish and manage projects in support of the cause, and to absorb and  train the many volunteers pouring into Pakistan to participate in the war. However, this  work did not satisfy Shaykh `Azzam’s desire for jihad, and his lust for battle eventually drove  him finally to Afghanistan to take part in the fighting.     In Afghanistan he rarely stayed in one place for long. Instead, he traveled throughout the  country, visiting most of its provinces and states. Among the places that `Azzam reportedly  visited at one time or another were Lujer, Kandahar, the Hindukush Heights, the Valley of  Binjistr, Kabul and Jalalabad. These travels made a deep impression on him, allowing him to  witness first-hand the “heroic” deeds of these ordinary people, who had sacrificed all that  they possessed—including their own lives—for “the Supremacy of Islam.”     Upon his return to Peshawar, `Azzam became an active propagandist for the jihad. He  attempted to bring together the estranged Mujahidin commanders, and called upon those  who had not yet joined the fighting to take up arms and to follow him to the front while  there was yet time. In this way, he gained a reputation for leadership, eventually becoming  one of the foremost figures in the Afghani jihad, apart from the Afghan leaders themselves.  In particular, he was instrumental in promoting the Afghan cause to the rest of the world,  especially in the Muslim world.     In his travels throughout the Arab world, he called on Muslims to rally to the defense of  their religion and lands. In addition, he wrote a number of books on jihad, including Join the  Caravan and Defense of Muslim Lands. `Azzam’s goal was to impel young Muslims all over the  world to join the fighting in Afghanistan, which he presented as an Islamic cause, of  significance to all Muslims. Due to his efforts, the Afghani jihad became an Islamic symbol,  bringing together Muslim volunteers from every part of the globe. `Azzam saw his goal to be  the establishment of the Khilafah, or “Allah’s Rule on earth,” which he believed to be the  responsibility of each and every Muslim. The jihad, according to his belief, was the vehicle  that would establish the Khilafah (Islamic Rule) over the whole world.     His work in Afghanistan had made `Abd Allah `Azzam the main pillar of the jihad  movement in the region. He played a significant role in influencing the minds of Muslims  concerning the meaning of jihad, and served as a role model for the younger generation of  Muslims, who flocked to Afghanistan in droves.     However, Shaykh `Azzam was not without enemies within the jihad movement. The  movement was split by rivalries and factionalism. In 1989 a lethal amount of TNT explosive  was placed beneath the pulpit from which the Shaykh was to deliver his Friday sermon. The  bomb did not explode.      287 </page> <page sequence="11"> On 24 November 1989 three bombs planted along the route that `Abd Allah `Azzam  regularly traveled to the mosque detonated as he passed. The Shaykh was killed, along with  two of his sons. Rumors have consistently linked Usama b. Laden to `Azzam’s assassination,  though there is no proof of a connection. Upon his death, `Azzam left behind him dozens  of books on religious doctrines, religious fatawa (rulings) and a comprehensive ideology of  jihad.

Following the clash between al-Qa`ida and Saudi security forces in the al-Fayha  neighborhood in May 2004, he helped hide Nasir Rashid Nasir al-Rashid and Rakin al- Saykhan until they both died of their wounds, after which he buried them in secret.  He was  injured and captured after a clash with police in the Rawabi neighborhood of East Riyadh in  October of 2005.  He was carrying forged identity papers at the time under the name `Isa al- Siba`i, and had in his car a small arsenal of explosive materials, bombs, assault rifles and  pistols, as well as nine car plates, various documents and cash.  He holds an advanced degree  in Shari`a from an Islamic university.  He was shot during the encounter, but was taken  immediately to a hospital and treated for his wounds.  He was not on any of the Saudi “most  wanted” lists prior to his arrest.  He is in prison in Saudi Arabia.                Name:  `Abd al-Qadir b. `Abd al-`Aziz  Name (Arabic):  زيزعلا دبع نب رداقلا دبع   Aliases:  Sayyid Imam `Abd al-`Aziz Imam al-Sharif, often  simply Sayyid Imam al-Sharif.   Aliases (Arabic):  فيرشلا ماما زيزعلا دبع ماما ديس   Born:  1950  Died:  N/A  Country of Origin:  Egypt    Background:      `Abd al-Qadir was born in 1950 in Upper Egypt, memorized  the Qur'an in childhood, and graduated with honors from the  Cairo College of Medicine in 1974.  He was pursued by police  in Egypt in 1981 for involvement in the Sadat assassination, but managed to escape the  country.  He moved first to UAE, then to Saudi Arabia and then Pakistan.  `Abd al-Qadir  worked there as the director of the al-Hilal al-Kuwaiti Hospital in Peshawar, during which  time he made and maintained contacts with other jihadi activists then in  Pakistan/Afghanistan.  He moved to Sudan in 1993 and Yemen sometime in the late 1990s.    `Abd al-Qadir was the founder and first leader of al-Jihad al-Islami fi Misr (Islamic Jihad in  Egypt), until Zawahiri took over in 1991; apparently they disagreed at the time about violent   289 </page> <page sequence="13"> action, and `Abd al-Qadir was opposed to some terrorist acts that al-Jihad al-Islami had  carried out in Egypt.  Some reports indicate that `Abd al-Qadir accused Zawahiri of  publishing the former's writings under the latter's name, and that this was part of the split.    He was living in Sana`a, Yemen, when after 9.11.2001 he was taken into police custody,  remaining imprisoned in Sana'a for a little over two years, until extradited to Egypt from  Yemen in 2.2004.      Notes:    He is the author of "Risalat al-`umda fi I`dad al-`udda li'l-jihad fi sabil allah," an important  jihad "manual" that has been found in the possession of a number of different terrorist cells  disrupted in Europe.  In 12.2004, this book was found in the Stuttgart apartment of one of  the planners of the (failed) assassination attempt on Iyad Allawi during the latter's visit to  Germany; that terrorist was a member of Ansar al-Islam (see  http://www.verfassungsschutz-bw.de/kgi/files/kgi_arab_2005-03.htm).  It was also found  in the Milan apartment of Bouyahia Maher ben Abdelaziz (Abu Yahya Mahir b. `Abd al- `Aziz), a Moroccan arrested in Italy in late 2004 for alleged recruiting of jihadis for `Iraq and  association with Ansar al-Islam (on the discovery of this manual in his apartment, see  http://italy.indymedia.org/news/2005/07/832872.php.).

He has also written on the priorities on Islamic da`wah, or  outreach and missionary work, in the West. In addition, he authored the book Scientific Basis  of the Salafi Da'wah, published in Florida. `Abd al-Khaliq has weighed in extensively on  debates over takfir, legislation, and governance, and is used by both sides of the Salafi debate  on jihad.              290 </page> <page sequence="14"> Name:  `Abd al-Rahman Hasan   Name (Arabic):  نسح نمحرلا دبع   Aliases:     Aliases (Arabic):   NO   Born:  ?

Country of Origin:  Libya    Background    A writer and ideologue of the al-Jama`a al-Islamiyya al-Muqatila bi-Libya (The Libyan  Islamic Fighting Group), a militant Islamist group composed mostly of Libyan veterans of  the Afghanistan jihad against the Soviets, formed in Fall of 1995 for the purpose of  overthrowing the regime of Mu`ammar al-Qadhdhafi and establishing an Islamist  government in Libya.  He is the author of al-Qadhdhafi Musaylima al-`asr (“Qadhdhafi, the  Musaylima of the Age”) a 1998 jihadi tract against Qadhdhafi written on behalf of this group,  prefaced by Abu al-Mundhir al-Sa`idi, one of the group’s most prominent leaders. [NB:  Musaylima was a rival of the Prophet Muhammad who was killed in battle against the  Muslims.]  `Abd al-Rahman Hasan is most likely a pseudonym.    Notes:    On 8 February 2006, the U.S. Treasury Department designated five U.K.-based individuals  as being al-Qa`ida affiliated, all of them connected to the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group  (the U.K. government had given the LIGF sanctuary until late 2005, when it was banned as a  terrorist group).  The first-named LIGF member was “Abd al-Rahman al-Faqih,” with a  number of aliases, none of them identical to `Abd al-Rahman Hasan.  It is possible, however,  that these two `Abd al-Rahmans are one person.  The individual named by the Treasury  Department was born 15 December 1959 in Libya and was living at that time (Feb. 2006) in  Birmingham, U.K.  The Department’s press release said of `Abd Al-Rahman al-Faqih:  “Abd al-Rahman al-Faqih is a senior leader of the LIFG and is involved in the provision of  false passports and money to LIFG members worldwide.  Al-Faqih has been tried and found guilty in absentia by the Rabat, Morocco Criminal Court  of Appeals for his involvement in the series of suicide bombings in Casablanca, Morocco on  May 16, 2003 that killed over 40 people and caused more than 100 injuries. It was strongly  suspected that the Moroccan Islamic Combat Group (GICM) carried out that attack.  GICM  was designated pursuant to Executive Order 13224 on November 22, 2002.  Al-Faqih has a history of GICM-related activity, notably representing the LIFG during  meetings held in Turkey in the late 1990s with GICM.  During these meetings, LIFG agreed  to host weapons training and jihad indoctrination at LIFG camps in Afghanistan for  Moroccans.”               291 </page> <page sequence="15">     Name:  Abu `Ubayd al-Qurashi   Name (Arabic):  يشرقلا ديبع وبأ   Aliases:     Aliases (Arabic):   NO   Born:   IMAGE  Died:    Country of Origin:  Saudi Arabia    Background:      Al-Qa`ida leader and strategist, close aide to bin Ladin.  He was a frequent contributor to the  jihadi journal (print and online) al-Ansar.  His writings are generally devoted to jihadi strategy  and insurgency tactics.  One of his works, “al-Qa`ida and the Art of War” (al-Qa`ida wa fann  al-harb), was listed in the recommended reading list of Muhammad b. Ahmad al-Salim’s “39  Ways of Serving and Participating in the Jihad” (39 wasilat li-khidmat al-jihad wa'l-musharika  fihi).   Much of his strategy writing is in the form of historical analysis, a sort of after-action- report method of breaking down the successes and failures of Islamist and jihadi movements  around the world in recent history.  He is also keenly aware of Western military strategy  discourses, and famously described al-Qa`ida’s combat doctrine as a manifestation of  “fourth-generation warfare,” a concept first formulated in 1989 by a group of American  military officers and published in the Marine Corps Gazette, October 1989 (Qurashi cites this  article a number of times); see the MEMRI analysis of this, in their Special Dispatch No. 344  (http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&amp;Area=sd&amp;ID=SP34402).

He was born in Qassim and died at the age of 37. Abu `Umar al-Sayf's brother, Ali  al-Tamimi, told the al-Hayat newspaper, "my brother participated in jihad in Afghanistan. He  studied with Dr. `Abd Allah `Azzam then returned to Saudi Arabia after the Russian army's  withdrawal and the civil war broke out in Afghanistan. My brother completed his university  education in the College of Shari`a at Imam Muhammad Bin Sa`ud Islamic University. Upon  graduation, he was offered a job opportunity in the judicial field, but he declined and joined  up with the Mujahidin again."    Abu `Umar al-Sayf, who was responsible for the Islamic courts in Chechnya when then- Chechen president, Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, attempted to declare Chechnya an Islamic state,  became an ideologue of the Arab fighters in Chechnya and connected the presumed state in  Chechnya with groups of Muslim clerics in the Arabian Gulf (qoqaz.com).    The al-Ra’y al-`Amm newspaper in Kuwait published the details of his trip to Afghanistan in  1986, where he stayed for two years. During that time, he only went back home once. Later,  he returned home and graduated with honors from Imam Muhammad Bin Saud Islamic  University. The newspaper also indicated that Abu `Umar al-Sayf went back to Chechnya in  "1996 with his Saudi wife; two-year-old firstborn son; and two-month-old daughter, Asmaa,  at the time" (al-Ra’y Al-`Amm, December 11, 2005).    Abu `Umar al-Sayf married a Chechen woman, who was killed with him in Chechnya. He  had three children with his Saudi wife—the youngest a six-year-old boy he had in Chechnya  when his wife was staying with him before she returned to Saudi Arabia in 1999 with all her  children.    Abu `Umar al-Sayf had "five brothers, two older ones, Mubarak and Ibrahim, who work at  the Royal Commission in the Jubail Industrial Zone East of the Kingdom of [Saudi] Arabia,  and three younger ones: Faysal, Badr and Ali, respectively. He also had six sisters. His father  died while Abu `Umar was in college, and his mother still lives with her children in Jubail,  where the whole family moved after they left Qassim" (al-Ra’y al-`Amm newspaper,  December 11, 2005).

Abu al-Fadl al-`Iraqi is a pseudonym.      Notes:    In cross-examination on 6 February 2001 at the U.S. District Court, Southern Disctrict of  New York, during the trial of three suspected al-Qa`ida militants connected with the  bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, witness Jamal Ahmad Muhammad  al-Fadl identified Abu al-Fadl al-`Iraqi as having been present at a meeting of al-Qa`ida  leaders in Afghanistan in the early 1990s at which the decision was made to relocate al- Qa`ida to Sudan (also present were Abu `Ubayda al-`Iraqi, Abu Ayyub al-`Iraqi, Abu  Hammam al-Sa`udi, Abu `Unays al-Sa`udi and `Ali Harun, AKA Abu Hasan al-Sudani).  The  same witness spoke about a discussion among al-Qa`ida leaders in the Sudan regarding the  Sunni/Shi`a divide, in the course of which al-`Iraqi reportedly argued in favor of trying to  get Sunni and Shi`a to work together in the larger Salaf-jihadi project, saying that it would be  better for the two sects to fight the enemy together than to be in conflict with each other.

He accompanied Muhammad on  the latter's hijra to Medina.  At the death of Muhammad, a gathering of the Medinan Ansar  and some of the prominent Meccan Muslims, including `Umar, elected Abu Bakr as the  khalifat rasul allah, or the successor of the prophet of God.

He has been severely critical of Hamas  for what he considers their deviation from "true jihad."  He has also condemned Hizballah  as a tool of the "global Shi`i movement."  After the bombings in London in 2005, Abu Basir  put a fatwa on his website condemning the actions, calling the London bombers cowardly  and Islamicly illegitimate, and questioning whether the attackers were actually linked to al- Qa`ida.  He subsequently distanced himself further from the jihadi mainstream, posting on  his website in mid-2005 a fatwa prohibiting suicide operations.   In May of 2005, he led a  protest in London, staged outside the U.S. embassy, against the desecration of the Qur'an at  Guantanamo.

Often called simply al-Imam al-A`zam (the  greatest imam), Abu Hanifa al-Nu`man b. Thabit was born at Kufa, `Iraq.  He was a silk  merchant, though he attended the lectures on religious law of Hammad b. Abi Sulayman at  Kufa and `Ata’ b. Abi Rabah in Mecca.  After the death of the former, Abu Hanifa became  the leading Kufan authority on Shari`a law and gathered a large following of students.  He  left no writings, and the teaching that forms the basis of the Hanafi legal tradition is  contained in works written by his direct disciples (principally Abu Yusuf and al-Shaybani).   He was never a qadi (practicing Shari`a judge), and died in an `Abbasid prison in Baghdad,  for reasons which are still obscure.

The Caliph `Umar  appointed him to the governorship of Bahrain, but deposed him after reports of corruption  and graft, having him flogged and forbidding him from transmitting hadith (Mu`awiyya later  rehabilitated him and made him governor of Medina).  Medieval hadith scholars often  judged him a liar and unreliable relater of hadith, but contemporary Salafi reverence for the  sahaba has overridden this judgment, and he is considered by modern Salafis to be a  trustworthy source of tradition.

He has been in prison in Saudi Arabia since 2004, and his real  name (al-Zahrani) was only revealed when he was listed on one of the Saudi “most wanted”  lists.  He was number 13 on that list, and was captured in a park in the southern Abha  Province on 5 August 2004 (he held a hand-grenade at the time of his capture, but did not  use it; one other person was arrested with him, not identified to the press).  Prior to his  capture he had declared the legality of killing Saudi security forces and had publicly rejected  the Saudi government’s amnesty offer.  He is the author of a large (460 page) encomium to  Usama b. Ladin, entitled Usama b. Ladin: mujaddid al-zaman wa qahir al-amrikan (“Usama b.  Ladin: Renewer of the Age and Conqueror of the Americans”).  (The title mujaddid –  “renewer” or “reviver” – is typically given to only those perceived to have dramatically  furthered the interests of Islam in a given period, and in the modern period has been applied  to relatively few scholars, such as Hasan al-Banna and Abu al-A`la al-Mawdudi.)

Son of the great al-Azhar hadith scholar  Muhammad Shakir, Ahmad Shakir helped revive the traditional sciences of hadith  scholarship in the context and cognizant of modern academic methods.  In his later years he  worked tirelessly to edit hadith texts, and, with Muhammad Hamid al-Faqi, founded an  institute dedicated to collecting and editing hadith manuscripts.  He was educated and taught  at al-Azhar.

IMAGE  Died:  661  Country of Origin:  Arabia    Background:      Cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, fourth caliph and first Shi`i Imam,  whose short reign was marked by constant civil war and strife.  He is considered one of the  first Muslims, either second after Muhammad’s wife Khadija (the Shi`i view), or third after  Khadija and Abu Bakr (the Sunni view).   `Ali married Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad,  and fathered on her al-Hasan and al-Husayn, the second and third Shi`i Imams, respectively.   He succeeded to the caliphate upon the murder of `Uthman in 656 and immediately  attempted to put down a rebellion led by Talha b. `Ubayd Allah, al-Zubayr b. al-`Awwam  and `A’isha.  `Ali’s armies were victorious, Talha and Zubayr were killed and `A’isha was  captured.  Soon thereafter, `Uthman’s kinsman Mu`awiyya raised an army in revolt from  Damascus, demanding vengeance for the killing of `Uthman.  Their armies met at the Battle  of Siffin in 657, and the conflict was submitted to arbitration after Mu`awiyya’s forces fixed   300 </page> <page sequence="24"> copies of the Qur’an to their spears and demanded settlement by reference to the book.  For  agreeing to this arbitration (which was decided in Mu`awiyya’s favor), a group of `Ali’s  supporter’s broke with him and formed what became known as the Khariji movement.  A  Khariji assassin later managed to stab `Ali in the head while the latter was in prayer at a  mosque in Kufa, and `Ali died three days later, 28 January 661.              Name:  `Ali b.

He was arrested after the May 2003  bombings in Riyadh (which he supported and subsequently wrote in praise of), and was held  in the al-Hayir jail.  When he was imprisoned, Usama b. Ladin posted a message on a Web  site warning the Saudi government not to harm Khudayr, calling him "our most prominent  supporter" and saying that any harm that came to him would draw from al-Qa`ida a  response "as great as the Shaykh's standing with us." He wrote a fatwa after 9/11 calling for  Muslims to rejoice, and defended the killing of civilians. He and this circle of takfiris is  extremely critical of the Saudi regime.

His first shaykh was his grandfather, Muhammad b. `Abd al-Wahhab, and he  subsequently studied with the leading disciples of Ibn `Abd al-Wahhab and later with the  leading shaykhs of Egypt.  He supported the house of Sa`ud in its struggle to take over the  peninsula, and when it did, he returned to Najd in 1825 and  was made the most powerful  religious leader of the kingdom, the marja` (authoritative exemplar) to all other clerics in the  kingdom.    Notes:    The `Abd al-Rahman b. Hasan described in the "Background" section had a relative in the  next generation by the same name, who was also one of his disciples.  It is thus possible that  a citation of "`Abd al-Rahman b. Hasan Al al-Shaykh" refers to the younger, and not the  elder `Abd al-Rahman.  Resolution of this depends on context and checking the title of the  cited work against lists of the works of these two shaykhs, available at various Arabic sites on  the Internet.

Name:  Ibn `Abbas   Name (Arabic):  سابع نبا   Aliases:     Aliases (Arabic):   NO   Born:  619 IMAGE  Died:  686  Country of Origin:  Arabia    Background:      Father of Qur'anic exegesis, widely considered one of the greatest scholars of the first  generation of Muslims.  From the article in EI2: "Proud of his knowledge, which was not  based only on memory, but also on a large collection of written notes, he gave public  lectures, or rather classes, keeping to a sort of program, according to the days of the week,  on different subjects: interpretation of the Qur'an, judicial questions, Muhammad's  expeditions, pre-Islamic history, ancient poetry. It is because of his habit of quoting lines in  support of his explanations of phrases or words of the Qur'an that ancient Arabic poetry  acquired, for Muslim scholars, its acknowledged importance. His competence having been  recognized, he was asked for fatwas (especially famous is his authorization of mut`a marriage,  which he later had to vindicate). The Qur'anic explanations of Ibn `Abbas were soon  brought together in special collections, of which the isnads go back to one of his immediate  pupils ( Fihrist, 33); his fatwas were also collected; today there exist numerous manuscripts  and several editions of a tafsir or tafsirs which are attributed to him (whether rightly or  wrongly cannot be said, as no study of this material has yet been made)."  He later became  the symbolic grandfather of the `Abbasids, though his importance in early Islamic politics   314 </page> <page sequence="38"> was generally exaggerated by `Abbasid and later writers.  He did follow the Muslim armies  into the first major battles of expansion (into Egypt, North Africa, Tabaristan, and  Constantinople), and led a wing of `Ali's troops at the battles of the Camel and Siffin.   `Uthman delegated Ibn `Abbas as his proxy on the pilgrimage just before `Uthman was  assassinated.  Later writers make Ibn `Abbas into the leading counselor of `Umar, `Uthman  and `Ali, though in fact he did not enter political life until the reign of `Ali.  He was a  signatory to the agreement to arbitration at Siffin, though he later broke with `Ali and  withdrew to Mecca (he has been `Ali's representative in Basra).  He served as al-Hasan's  military general, though maintained contact with Mu`awiyya and helped to arbitrate their  agreement, whereby al-Hasan ceased any political claims.  He refused to recognize the  caliphate of Ibn al-Zubayr, and was therefore expelled from Mecca.  He eventually made his  way to al-Ta'if, where he died.

He also took a hard line on the permissibility of Muslims  living in non-Muslim lands, stating that hijra out of Dar al-Harb was obligatory.     318 </page> <page sequence="42">           Name:  Ibn al-Athir, Majd al-Din  Name (Arabic):  ريثلأا نبا نيدلا دجم   Aliases:     Aliases (Arabic):     Born:  1149 NO   Died:  1210 IMAGE  Country of Origin:  Iraq    Background:      Important philologist and hadith scholar, whose work on obscurities in the hadith was  incorporated in the Lisan al-`arab.  From the EI2 article (by F. Rosenthal): Majd al-Din Abu  'l-Sa`adat al-Mubarak was born in 544/1149. His entire adult life was spent in Mosul, where  he worked for the government in the service of Ghazi b. Mawdud, Ghazi's brother Mas`ud,  and the latter's son Arslan Shah. For a while, he was attached to Mujahid al-Din Qaymaz,  who, formerly of Irbil, had moved to Mosul and been entrusted there by Ghazi with the  running of affairs. Though he was paralyzed in his later years, his administrative services and  advice were still very much in demand. However, an anecdote reported by his brother, the  historian, depicts him as preferring the contemplative quiet of the invalid to the distractions  of politics. He died on Thursday, 29 Dhu 'l-hijja 606/24 June 1210.     Of his works, a hadith collection entitled Jami` al-usul became a much used standard  reference work (autograph copy of the first volume in Istanbul, Feyzullah 299, cf. H. Ritter,  in Oriens, vi (1953), 71-7). His dictionary of less common words and meanings occurring in  the Prophetic traditions, al-Nihaya fi gharib al-hadith (Cairo 1322, also 1963-65), gained  especially wide currency from the fact that it was incorporated in the Lisan al-`Arab . He  wrote on particular kinds of names in the Kitab al-Banin wa-'l-banat wa 'l-aba' wa'l-ummahat  wa'l-adhwa' wa'l-dhawat (= Kitab al-Murassa`, incomplete ed. by C. F. Seybold [Weimar  1896, Semitistische Studien, 1h/11]). While his works on the Musnad of al-Shafi`i, on the  pious men and women of early Islam ( al-Mukhtar fi manaqib al-akhyar, table of contents by  O. Spies, in MO , xxiv (193h), 31-55), and, it seems, a collection of Rasa'il (listed in  Brockelmann as No. 5) are preserved, his major works on grammar and Qur'an  interpretation, together with a number of works on other subjects, have not yet been  recovered.               319 </page> <page sequence="43"> Name:  Ibn al-Farra', Abu Ya`la   Name (Arabic):  يلبنحلا ءارفلا نب نيسحلا نب دمحم ىلعي وبا يضاقلا   Aliases:     Aliases (Arabic):   NO   Born:  990 IMAGE  Died:  1066  Country of Origin: `Iraq    Background:      Important early Hanbali jurist and hadith scholar.  He was the notary (shahid) of the  `Abbasid court at Baghdad, and appointed qadi of the palace and of the towns of Harran  and Hulwan.  Late in life he was polemicized by a group of Ash`aris for anthroporphism.   He authored many polemical works, included refutations of the Batinis, the Karramiyya, the  Mujassima, and of kalam generally.  His most famous work is the Kitab al-Mu`tamad, a work  of Hanbali doctrine modelled after the form of kalam treatises.  For three centuries he was  considered the leading scholar of the Hanbali school, referred to simply as al-Qadi (“The  Judge”), though this position was later conferred upon Ibn Qudama, and later al-Mawardi.

Theologically he was a conservative Ash`ari and a vehement opponent of what he saw as  anthropomorphism and polytheism of rival theological schools.  His relative extremism drew  much criticism from other Hanbalis, both of his time and afterward, though for the same  reason he is a hero of modern salafis.    Notes:    A good article on him by G.F.

One of the most celebrated scholars of the Muslim West, `Iyad went  to Spain from his native Ceuta in 1113 to seek Islamic legal training in an era when it was  much more common for one to go East for this purpose.  He in fact never went East, not  even to make the pilgrimage.  Throughout his adult life he was attached to the Almoravid  court.   He was appointed to the position of qadi of Ceuta a second time in 1145 and was the  center of resistance to the Almohads (al-Muwahhidun) there.  After the latter conquered the  city, he was sent into exile in Tadla and subsequently Marrakesh, where he died.  He was an  extremely strict Maliki faqih, and was deposed from his post of qadi of Granada by its  governor for being too censorious.  According to M. Talbi (Encyclopedia of Islam, s.v. `Iyad b.  Musa), “His best-known published works are: al-Shifa’ bi-ta`rif huquq al-Mustafa, which  enjoyed an enormous success and which still continues to play an important part in popular  piety; Mashariq al-anwar `ala sihah al-athar; Tartib al-madarik wa-tarkib al-masalik bi-ma`rifat a`lam  madhhab Malik, which constitutes the best defence for and illustration of the Maliki school.”   The last-named work is the most oft-cited work of `Iyad in contemporary Salafi-jihadi  literature.

He is currently in jail in  Jordan. While in prison in the 1990s, he mentored Abu Mus`ab al-Zarqawi, for which he  came to the attention of the West.  He studied the works of earlier Salafi writers and thinkers  and traveled through Saudi Arabia, where he developed a view of Salafi ideology akin to the  Saudi Salafis, yet with endorsements for jihad and armed resistance to tyrannical rule. He  later traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan where he met various mujahidin groups and  members of Takfir wal-hijra, whose ideology he found dangerous. After returning to Jordan  in 1992 he angered Jordanian officials by denouncing their rule as illegitimate and opposed  to the Shari`a. Maqdisi has not shied away from criticizing other Salafi thinkers, and his  focus on intra-Salafi issues demonstrates his intentions to form a body of Salafi beliefs,  which have appeal for young Muslims—particularly those disenfranchised youth in  Jordanian prison and elsewhere.

In 1888 he returned  to Egypt and became a judge on the National Courts; eleven years later he became grand  mufti. Through his official positions, he tried unsuccessfully to reform Egypt's constitution.     After Abduh's death, his closest disciple, Syrian reformer Muhammad Rashid Rida (1865- 1935), continued to spread his message throughout the Islamic world. Rida's magazine, al- Manar, spoke for their self-named Salafiyya movement.

Educated in Ottoman  state schools in Qalamun and Tripoli, Rashid Rida traveled to Egypt in 1897 seeking to  become `Abduh’s student, and almost immediately began working on the important Islamic  reformist journal he founded and was to edit until his death, al-Manar.   Like `Abduh before  him, his primary concern was the relative backwardness and weakness of Muslim societies  with regard to Western colonialism, blaming Sufi degeneracy, the unexamined following of  past tradition (taqlid), the stagnation of the `ulama, and the resulting failure to achieve  progress in science and technology.  He held that these flaws could be alleviated by a return  to what he saw as the true principles of Islam, albeit interpreted (ijtihad) to suit modern  realities, in concert with reform-oriented national education initiatives throughout the Arab  and Muslim world.

His PhD dissertation was on the Murji`a, and is perhaps a  foundational work in which firqa categories from early Islam are mapped onto the  contemporary ideological spectrum.  Is currently secretary general of the Supreme Council of  Global Jihad; was one of the 26 Saudi scholars who issued an open letter in late 2004 calling  on 'Iraqis to fight the US.

Notes:    While a number of Safar al-Hawali's writings and speeches are available on tawhed.ws, he  also appears in the Firaq wa madhahib ("Sects and Schools") section of tawhed.ws as a leader  of the "Sururiyya," an artificial sect-name used mostly by opponents to refer to the ideas and  followers of Muhammad Surur Zayn al-`Abidin, a Saudi supporter of the Muslim  Brotherhood until 1968, when he broke and established his own group (he now lives in exile  in London).

Studied in the US from 1948-50.  Upon returning to Egypt, resigned from  civil service and became an active member of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (Ikhwan al- Muslimin).  One of the most important mid-twentieth century ideologues of salafi/jihadi  thought, whose extension of the category of jahiliyya to modern contexts was foundational  for present salafi and jihadi discourses.  His Fi Zilal al-Qur'an is one of the most influential  modern commentaries of the Qur'an.  Was executed by hanging on 8.29.1966 along with six  other Muslim Brotherhood activists for plotting to overthrow the Egyptian government.    He articulated a militant anti-modernist analysis of modernity in the terms and categories of  classical Islamic thought, a project which involved sweeping redefinition of some of these  fundamental categories – most notably the term jahiliyya – and which therefore established  the basic lexicon and methodology of moder Salafi-jihadi discourse.  Following his execution  by Egyptian authorities his martyr status helped fuel the explosive growth and strength of  the Muslim Brotherhood, making him partly and posthumously responsible for the  widespread growth of Islamist political movements.  His narrow definition of true Muslim  identity and broad denunciations of existing Muslim societies helped determine the takiri or  excommunicative tendencies of subsequent jihadis, who are thus sometimes known  interchangeably as Qutbis and as Takfiris.  Born and executed in Egypt, traveled to the  United States.

Born at Kufa and participant  there in the circles of early Islamic legal study, he is credited with having established a  distinct “school” of legal theory, known as the Thawriyya.  In contrast to the other early  legal “schools,” especially the Hanifiyya and Malikiyya, Sufyan al-Thawri was a scholar of  hadith and grounded his interpretation of Islamic law in the hadith.  He was a student of  many of the thinkers formative for the development of Sunnism at that time, including `Abd  Allah b. `Awn, al-Awza`i, Wasil b. `Ata’ and others.  He was to be continuously cited as a  major authority in the various disciplines of hadith, fiqh and tabaqat literature from the 8th  century to the present, by members of all of the Sunni madhhabs, a fact which illustrates his  foundational position with respect to the earliest period in the developments of hadith and  law.  His hadith-centered legal theory was the predecessor of that of al-Shafi`i.  He is often  considered by both Sufis and - to a lesser extent - the Shi`a as one of their early members,  though the former claim is anachronistic and the latter is probably false.  Large parts of his  numerous works are preserved via citation in a great many classical texts, and his theology is  described in detail by both Abu Nu`aym (in the latter’s Hilya) and Ibn Abi Hatim (in his  Takdima).                 350 </page> <page sequence="74"> Name:  Sulayman b.

He  lost his eyesight at an early age from diabetes and studied the Qur’an and the writings of the  Salafi ideological architects (e.g., Ibn Taymiyya, Sayyid Qutb) in Braille editions.  He  graduated from al-Azhar University, having studied with then-professor `Abd Allah `Azzam,  and developed close ties with the Jama`a and Egyptian Islamic Jihad in the 1970s.  He was  imprisoned in Egypt following the 1981 assassination of Sadat, and was reportedly tortured  repeatedly during this incarceration.  He was subsequently acquitted of the charge of  conspiring to assassinate Sadat, and was expelled from Egypt upon his release from jail.  He  then joined the anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan, where he became a close associate of `Abd  Allah `Azzam and Usama b. Ladin.  He was also linked to Qulb al-Din Hikmatyar and the  CIA/ISI funding for the jihad, and he travelled around the world recruiting fighters and  raising support for the jihad for five years in the late 1980s.  After the murder of `Azzam, he  assumed a leading role in the latter’s Maktab al-Khadamat (MAK) as well as in al-Qa`ida.  He  was sent to New York in 1990 to lead the MAK in the U.S., where it had important financial  resources.  He became the imam of three mosques there and gathered a large following of  extremists, including those involved in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1990  assassination, in New York, of Israeli terrorist and religious extremist Meir Kahane.   Following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, intense FBI surveillance of `Abd al- Rahman led to his arrest in the same year, and he was convicted in 1995 of seditious  conspiracy and sentenced to life in prison.  He is currently serving a life sentence at the  Maximum Penitentiary hospital in Florence, Colorado.  His release has been a consistent and  high-priority demand of a number of Salafi-jihadi terrorist groups, including the Jama`a al- Islamiyya, al-Qa`ida, and others.  A faction of the Jama`a killed 58 European tourists in  Luxor, Egypt in 1997, distributing leaflets at the scene of the attack demanding `Abd al- Rahman’s release.  In videos and audio recordings, the leadership of al-Qa`ida has also  repeatedly called on the U.S. to release him or face further attacks.      Notes:    In 2005, members of the legal team representing `Abd al-Rahman were convicted of crimes  relating to their representation of `Abd al-Rahman. His lawyer, Lynne Stewart, was  convicted of providing material support (through a press conference and allowing access by  her translator) to a terrorist conspiracy to kill persons outside of the United States and  conspiring to defraud the U.S. government when acting as counsel to `Abd al-Rahman. She  was accused of passing along `Abd al-Rahman's blessing for a resumption of terrorist  operations to his terrorist cell in Egypt after cell members inquired whether they should   353 </page> <page sequence="77"> continue to honor a Jama`a ceasefire that was in place against the Egyptian government.

An early and forceful opponent of Muhammad, he  converted during the Meccan period to Islam, becoming one of Muhammad's most  prominent supporters.  He promoted Abu Bakr for the position of the first caliph.  His reign  saw massive expansion of the Islamic empire, including the effective overthrow of the  Persian empire, the taking of all of North Africa, and the conquest of Armenia from the  Byzantines.  He was assassinated in the Prophet's Mosque in Medina by Abu Lu`lu`a, a  Persian slave, who then committed suicide.  He was succeeded in the caliphate by `Uthman  b. `Affan.                      Name:  Usama b. Ladin  Name (Arabic):  ندلا نب ةماسأ  Aliases:    Aliases (Arabic):    Born:  1957  Died:  N/A  Country of Origin:  Saudi Arabia    Background:      There are numerous biographies available; the following is primarily from the MIPT  Terrorism Knowledge Database:     354 </page> <page sequence="78"> Usama b. Ladin was born in 1957 to Mohammad bin Awdah bin Ladin, originally of  Southern Yemen, who moved to Saudi Arabia for financial opportunities. The elder bin  Ladin eventually became a construction magnate and the bin Ladin family became highly  respected in Saudi Arabia for their work in renovating the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.  Usama b. Ladin graduated from King `Abd al-`Aziz University in Jedda, where he met his  first mentor, Dr. Abdullah Azzam, a Palestinian of Jordanian origin who was a member of  the Muslim Brotherhood and was to become the leader of Hamas later in life.     Bin Ladin traveled to Afghanistan during the 1980’s to aid the mujahadin in their fight  against the Soviet Union. There he organized what came to be known as al-Qa`ida—initially  guest houses for the mujahidin—to provide money, shelter and communications for the  fighters and to encourage more Arabs to travel from Saudi Arabia to Afghanistan to fight.     At the end of the anti-Soviet campaign in Afghanistan, bin Ladin returned to Saudi Arabia.  After Saudi rulers failed to expel US troops following the successful Gulf War against  Saddam Hussein, bin Ladin started a campaign against the Saudi royal house. He claimed the  Saudi rulers were corrupt puppets of the West and failed to meet their obligations as Muslim  rulers, stating that they should be deposed in order to install a true Islamic regime in Saudi  Arabia. The Saudi regime deported him in 1992 and revoked his citizenship in 1994.     After his deportation from Saudi Arabia, bin Ladin brought his organization to the Islamic  state of Sudan. Sudan received widespread international criticism for hosting the terrorist  group and it eventually expelled him, causing bin Ladin and al-Qa`ida to return to  Afghanistan, then ruled by the Taliban. Despite the American attacks in October 2001 that  ousted the Taliban from power and destroyed much of al-Qa`ida’s infrastructure in  Afghanistan, bin Ladin remains at large. He is believed by many to be hiding in the  mountainous region on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.               Name:  `Uthaymin(al-), Muhammad b. Salih b.   Name (Arabic):  نيميثع نب حلاص نب دمحم   Aliases:     Aliases (Arabic):   NO   Born:  1926 IMAGE  Died:  2001  Country of Origin:  Saudi Arabia    Background:      Prominent Salafi scholar and jurisconsult.  Born in `Unayza, Qasim province, `Uthaymin  came from a distinguished family of religious scholars and studied under the leading Salafai  and conservative Sunni shaykhs of his day.  His shaykhs included `Abd al-Rahman al-Sa`di,  Muhammad Amin Shinqiti, and `Abd al-`Aziz b. Baz, of whom `Uthaymin was seen as a   355 </page> <page sequence="79"> successor.  As the representative of "establishment" Salafism, `Uthaymin has long been  vilified by the jihadi right, in Saudi Arabia and abroad.  He has given prominent rulings in  recent years on issues related to jihadi activism, consistently finding the jihadi jurisprudence  in violation of Islamic law.  Thus, he famously and repeatedly ruled suicide bombing illegal  and declared that such bombers are not martyrs but denizens of Hell.  He was a professor of  usul al-din (fundamentals of religion) at the Shari`a College of Muhammad b. Sa`ud Islamic  University in Qasim.  He was appointed to the Council of Senior Scholars of Saudi Arabia  (Hay'a kubar al-`ulama fi mamlaka al-`arabiyya al-sa`udiyya) in 1986.  He was the imam and  preacher at the large mosques of `Unayza, and had a large number of other appointments,  titles and positions.                  Name:  `Uyayri(al-), Yusuf  Name (Arabic):  يرييعلا فسوي  Aliases:  al-Battar (The Cutting Edge)  Aliases (Arabic):  راتبلا  Born:  ca. 1967  Died:  2003  Country of Origin:  Saudi Arabia    Background:      Saudi al-Qa`ida ideologue, military commander and mujahidin trainer.  He joined the anti- Soviet jihad in Afghanistan at the age of 18, and was quickly elevated to positions of  leadership in Afghanistan on account of his ability and leadership skills.  In 1993 he was sent  with Abu Hafs al-Misri to Somalia to train Islamist militias and teach them to use anti- aircraft weaponry.  He was imprisoned in 1995 in Saudi Arabia in connection with a  bombing of a U.S.-Saudi military office in Riyadh, but later released.  He was a pioneer in the  use of the Internet to further jihadi goals.  He served at one time as Usama b. Ladin's  bodyguard, and was active in the establishment and running of mujahidin training camps in  the Arabian Peninsula. Was closely linked to the takfiri-jihadi circle under Hammud b. `Uqla  al-Shu`aybi, though `Uyayri had more direct leadership involvement in the 2003 attacks in  Saudi Arabia.  He was one of the principal writers (cf. now Najdi) on jihadi military strategy  and training techniques, having written many articles for "Mu`askar," a jihadi strategy  periodical that was counterpart to Sawt al-Jihad, the primary al-Qa`ida organ.  He wrote  "The Future of `Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula After the Fall of Baghdad," which argues  that the greatest weapon of "Zio-Crusaderism," his term for a putative U.S.-Israeli alliance, is  the spread of democracy.  He was killed by Saudi security forces in June 2003 while trying to  flee the country.  Subsequent to his death, he was identified as the webmaster of alneda.com,  also known as the Markaz al-dirasat wa'l-buhuth al-islamiyya.         356 </page> <page sequence="80">   Notes:    His name sometimes transliterated in the media as Ayyiri.  His date of birth is not given in  any sources available to me, but the fact that he joined the Afghan jihad at the age of 18  means that he was almost certainly born between 1967 and 1970.                  Name:  Yusuf al-Qaradawi   Name (Arabic):   يواضرقلا فسوي  Aliases:    Aliases (Arabic):    Born:  1926  Died:    Country of Origin:  Egypt    Background:      Prolific Egyptian-born, al-Azhar-trained conservative Muslim shaykh living in Qatar.  He  was a follower of Hasan al-Banna in his youth and was imprisoned three times in Egypt in  the first half of the twentieth century for his involvement in Islamist activism there. Though  a member of the Ikhwan al-Muslimin, Qaradawi has several times turned down offers to lead  the organization.  After relocating to Qatar, he was appointed the Dean of the Islamic  Department at the Faculties of Shariah and Education in Qatar and was also made chairman  of a council overseeing Islamic education in Algeria.  Qaradawi has a popular television  program on the al-Jazeera Network called al-Shari`a wa’l-Hayat (Islamic Law and Life), and  was a co-founder in 1997 of the popular Islamic web portal, IslamOnline.net.  Author of  more than fifty books, Qaradawi is a major voice in the contemporary Muslim world, where  he is generally considered a moderate conservative, making him a frequent target of attacks  from both the left and the right.  More liberal voices in the Muslim world, as well as the bulk  of his Western critics, take issue with Qaradawi’s support of suicide bombings in Israel as a  legitimate means of resistance on the part of the Palestinians, with his uncompromising  views on hot-button social issues like homosexuality and the status of women, and with his  unqualified rejection of secularism as fundamentally impossible in an Islamic society.  Many  of these critics view Qaradawi for these reasons as a radical, even jihadi shaykh.   Contemporary jihadis, however, revile Qaradawi for his general opposition to violence  outside of Israel and Palestine and for what they view as his heretically liberal construal of  Islamic law.  After a car-bombing by jihadi terrorists in Qatar on 20 March 2005, for  example, Qaradawi condemned the act in the strongest of terms, and it is this sort of  reaction that has made him one of the most hated of the establishment salafis living and  writing today.    Notes:   357 </page> <page sequence="81">   In a response to `Abd Allah b. Jibrin’s fatwa that forbade Muslims from supporting or  praying for Hizb Allah in the recent conflict with Israel on account of their Shi`i religious  beliefs, Qaradawi issued a counter-fatwa arguing that it was the duty of all Muslims to  support Hizb Allah in its fight against Israel.  He has denied being the author of a 2004  fatwa published in al-Sharq al-Awsat and subsequently translated by MEMRI which declared  that all Americans in `Iraq, military and civilian, were legitimate targets.  He has called for a  total boycott of Israeli and American goods.  He has been banned from entering the United  States since 1999, though he made a visit to London in July of 2004, amid much controversy.               358 </page> <page sequence="82"> Name:  Zawahiri(al-), Ayman  Name (Arabic):  يرهاوظلا نميأ  Aliases:  Abu Muhammad (Abu Mohammed), Abu Fatima,  Muhammad Ibrahim, Abu Abdallah, Abu al-Mu'iz,  The Doctor, The Teacher, Nur, Ustadh, Abu  Mohammed Nur al-Deen, `Abd al-Mu`izz (Abdel  Muaz, Abdel Moez, Abdel Muez).  Aliases (Arabic):    Born:  1951  Died:  N/A  Country of Origin:  Egypt    Background:    Al-Qa`ida Second-in-Command; former leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad who issued a  statement with Usama b. Ladin in 1998 forming the World Islamic Front Against Jews and  Crusaders. Full DOB: 6.19.1951.  Ayman al-Zawahiri was born to a prominent middle class  family in Maadi, Egypt, a suburb of Cairo, and was reportedly a studious youth.  His father  was a pharmacologist.  By fourteen he had joined the Muslim Brotherhood (al-Ikhwan al- Muslimin), and had become a student and follower of Sayyid Qutb.  Al-Zawahiri studied  behavior, psychology and pharmacology as part of his medical degree at Cairo University.   By 1979 he had moved on to the much more radical Islamic Jihad, where he eventually  became one of its leading organizers and recruiters.  He was one of hundreds arrested  following the assassination of Anwar Sadat.  Al-Zawahiri's lawyer Muntasir Al-Zayyat  contends that Zawahiri was tortured in prison.  However, the Egyptian government was  unable to prove any connection between al-Zawahiri and the assassination and he was  released after serving jail time for illegal arms possession.  In the 1980s he journeyed to Afghanistan to participate in the mujahideen resistance against  the Soviet Union's occupation. There he met Usama b. Laden, who was running a base for  mujahideen called Maktab al-Khadamat (MAK); both of them worked under the tutelage of  the Palestinian `Abd Allah `Azzam; later when the MAK fractured al-Zawahiri joined bin  Laden in organizing the al-Qa`ida group.  In 1990 al-Zawahiri returned to Egypt, where he continued to push Islamic Jihad in more  radical directions employing knowledge and tactics learned in Afghanistan.  In 1996, he was considered the most credible threat and a highly lethal terrorist who could  strike against the USA.  A warning issued at the time specified suicide bombing as the likely  form of attack.  In late 1996 he was detained in Russia for six months by the FSB after he  apparently tried to recruit jihadists in Chechnya.  According to the FSB spokesman Sergei  Ignatchenko, "He had four passports, in four different names and nationalities.  We checked  him out in every country, but they could not confirm him.  We could not keep him forever,  so we took him to the Azerbaijani border and let him go."  In November 1997 he was held  responsible for the massacre of 62 foreign tourists in the Egyptian town of Luxor, for which  he was sentenced to death in absentia in 1999 by an Egyptian military tribunal.   359 </page> <page sequence="83"> On February 23, 1998, he issued a joint fatwa with Usama b. Laden under the title "World  Islamic Front Against Jews and Crusaders", an important step in broadening their conflicts  to a global scale.  On September 25, 2001, Interpol issued an arrest warrant for al-Zawahiri in response to the  terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon.  On October 10, 2001 Dr. al-Zawahiri appeared on the initial list of the FBI's top 22 Most  Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by President Bush.  In December 2001, he published the book Knights Under the Prophet's Banner outlining al-Qa`i  da’s ideology.  English translations of this book were published, but are currently difficult to  locate due to security reasons.  However, extracts are available online.  He is also currently  working on another book.  Following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, al-Zawahiri's whereabouts are unclear.  It seems  likely he stays with bin Laden in the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan. On  December 3, 2001, airstrikes were launched on a complex of caves near Jalalabad. Zawahiri's  wife, Azza, and their three children were reportedly killed in the attack.  In May of 2004, the Pakistani government had announced that he was surrounded in a tribal  area of Pakistan bordering the Afghan mountains, along with 50-100 hardcore al-Qa`ida  fighters.  Although there were significant casualties, no trace of him was discovered. It is  now believed he was never in the area to begin with or slipped out of the dragnet just as the  fighting commenced.  On January 13, 2006, the CIA launched an airstrike on Damadola, a Pakistani village near the  Afghan border, where they believed al-Zawahiri was located. The airstrike killed eight men,  five women and five children but Al-Zawahiri was not killed. Many victims were buried  without being identified.  Anonymous U.S. government officials claimed that some foreign  fighters were killed and the Bajaur tribal area government confirmed that at least four  foreign fighters were among the dead. Anti-American protests broke out around the country  and Pakistan's government condemned the U.S. attack and the loss of innocent life. On  January 30th a new video was released showing al-Zawahiri unhurt. The video did discuss  the airstrike, but did not reveal if al-Zawahiri was present in the village at that time.
