<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS The characterization of Lucile will seem inconsistent only to those who expect the quarrel between purity and impurity to be patched up by some sort of compromise. But the opposition has not been mini- mized in this play; Paola's evil was an absolute evil, though it found expression in a half-measure, a kind of practical joke. We should not expect Lucile to counter this evil with half-measures or remonstrances, for an "essence character" does not make jokes about "a tiny bit of adultery" or being "somewhat virginal." Lucile's attack on impurity in Act I was serious; her answer to the "joke" in Act III is both serious and inevitable. For Lucile, then, life had virtually ended before the hoax was re- vealed; but for the audience, the dramatic reversals of Act III add considerably to the tragic effect of this "Duel of the Angels." Lucile's pathetic scene of "confession," in which she seemed to be trying to reconcile herself to her husband, comes to be understood as a futile attempt to make his after-life more tolerable. This delayed recognition, followed by Barbette's tirade at the end, gives tremendous force to Giraudoux's bitter indictment of men. Finally, the great scene of Paola's supposed triumph, which ends with her contrite acknowledge- ment, "le monde est pur," is a peripeteia in the grand tradition, justify- ing Lucile's death and leaving the audience with its reassertion of the ideal. ARTHUR J. KNODEL Tantric Plunge and Yantric Poem THE INTEREST OF A NUMBER of so-called symbolist writers in occultism will come as news to no one familiar with the field. The attempt to treat that interest as the very key to symbolism, while not unprece- dented, has considerably more novelty. And since occultism is nothing if not eclectic, that attempt may take widely varying forms. Here is how The Way Down and Out1 approaches the matter: "What is the metaphysical foundation of the symbolist movement? . . . the answer is 'occultism' . . ." (p. xxiii). Having argued that important point, the author proceeds to demonstrate that the real significance of symbolist writings is in direct proportion to their success in embodying occult metaphysics. The demonstration is not convincing, for a variety of reasons. Foremost among them is the fact that The Way Down and Out is predicated on a patently false premise. We are told from the outset THE WAY DOWN AND OUT: THE OCCULT IN SYMBOLIST LITERA- TURE, by John Senior. Cornell University Press. $3.75. 611</page><page sequence="2">THE HUDSON REVIEW that "the symbolist view of art is wholly different from-in fact pre- cisely antithetical to-the aesthetic" (p. xxiv) and again, "The symbo- lists did not think of themselves as writing poems for aesthetic pleasure. They were out to change the quality of the consciousness of men and therefore out to change the world" (p. xxv). Now the symbolist move- ment was first and foremost a literary movement, and the primary con- cern of its participants was to produce works that give a maximum of aesthetic pleasure. "Beauty" was their watchword; and-to cite only chefs de file-Baudelaire and Mallarm6 were obsessed with problems of form and style, and both of them paid fulsome tribute to Theophile Gautier, the high priest of that extreme form of aestheticism known as l'art pour l'art. The symbolists certainly did think of themselves as writing poems for aesthetic pleasure. It is true that the more intelligent ones were not content with aestheticism alone, but the aesthetic concern remained paramount for almost all of them. Of the admittedly symbolist writers (I exclude Blake and Hugo, who are placed in a kind of symbolist annex by Mr. Senior) Rimbaud alone violently rejected aesthetic considerations; only to find that, in that case, he had better give up writing poetry. Which he did. I agree that the best symbolist poets, like all poets worthy of the name, were "out to change the quality of the conscious- ness of men"-but precisely by aesthetic means and with aesthetic pleasure as their immediate goal. The anti-aesthetic premise helps explain two striking peculiarities of The Way Down and Out. I refer, first, to the shift in the dramatis personae of symbolism: the author considers Blake, Hugo, Nerval, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Huysmans, Villiers, Mallarm6, Yeats, and Eliot. Second, there is the strong impression one gets, on reading several of the essays on the individual authors, that the prince of Denmark has been left out of Hamlet. It should be recalled that only a small group of writers of the mid- eighties and nineties actually applied the term "symbolist" to them- selves. It was later critics who extended the term to include such pre- cursors as Nerval, Baudelaire, and Rimbaud, and such followers as Yeats and Eliot. But no one, so far as I know, has ever tried to attach Blake or that tete de Turc of almost all the symbolists, Victor Hugo, to the movement. Moreover, many poets that should figure in any serious consideration of symbolism-Corbi~re, Verlaine, Laforgue, R6gnier, the Belgian group-are hardly mentioned, if at all, in The Way Down and Out. The author, in his determination to define the symbolist movement exclusively in terms of a problematic occult meta- physics (of which only isolated symbolists were truly aware) omits so much of the total picture that what is left is grossly deformed by re- sultant errors in perspective. The term "symbolist movement," if it is to retain any valid content at all, must continue to designate-as it has for Symons, Val6ry, Edmund Wilson, T. S. Eliot, et al-a com- 612</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS munity of sensibility rather than a common metaphysics. It is perfectly obvious that occultism could fit very easily into the pattern of that highly self-absorbed sensibility. But it should be equally obvious that occultism was, in fact, only one of many elements that actually did enter into the expression of the symbolist sensibility. A refusal to admit that fact leads Mr. Senior to the distressingly lop-sided kind of Hamlet-without-the-prince presentation I have mentioned. Reading the essay devoted to Hugo, one would never suspect that Hugo was the author of "L'Expiation" or "La Rose de l'Infante" or a dozen other magnificent pieces that surpass in beauty and poignancy any of the table-tapping pseudo-profundities cited by Mr. Senior. Sylvie, not being very occult, is not mentioned, though it is undoubtedly Nerval's masterpiece. Mallarm6's "Apres-midi d'un faune" and "HWrodiade" (except for the closing "Cantique")-in fact, almost all the Mallarm6 poems except one or two sonnets and "Un Coup de d6s . . ."-are hardly mentioned or simply omitted. And Yeats, poor Yeats! All the extraordinary verve and humanity of some of his later work, all his saving wit-one would never suspect their existence on reading Mr. Senior. "Deprived of love, Yeats ends with hate, the only passion accessible to a dying animal" (p. 168). But then, Yeats "uses symbols in his poems, but his poems are not themselves symbolic. That is, they are not koans or yantras" (p. 168). It may be objected that, after all, the author's concern is only with the occult elements in the symbolist writers and that such omissions as those just discussed are justified. The objection would be valid if the author did not keep reiterating that what makes a piece of sym- bolist writing valuable is the measure of genuine occultism it involves. As it is, he is duty-bound to show either that the accepted masterpieces (like "La Rose de l'Infante" or "L'Apres-midi d'un faune") are actually not masterpieces, or that these works in some way owe some- thing important to occultism. But that is hardly done at all. It may still be argued that the analyses of the admittedly occult pieces of Blake, Nerval, and the others are of value, in spite of the deficiencies cited. Unfortunately, not even those analyses are very con- vincing. But before I can justify that assertion, a word must be said about Mr. Senior's presentation of occultism. Approximately the first fourth of his book is given over to an histori- cal survey of occultism. It is said to be a philosophia perennis underly- ing a continuous and world-wide tradition extending from pre-history into the present. "We can," writes Mr. Senior-who is a great hand at the cautionary term, as my italics seek to indicate-"list a number of attributes so that with some fairness we may separate the occult from the rest of human activity somewhat at least. Occultists tend to believe ..." (p. 39). And there follows a list of twenty-one attributes, to which we must do violence in the interest of brevity. The list begins by de- claring that the universe is monistic; its underlying 'stuff' is spirit, 613</page><page sequence="4">THE HUDSON REVIEW usually manifested as light. All things progress by dialectical opposites; yet the opposites are only apparent, since the universe is One and ineffable. Moreover, between the various modes of appearances there exists an inexhaustible pattern of correspondences or analogies. The underlying Oneness is organic and wholly anthropomorphic: "The universe is taken to be, in fact, a living man" (p. 39). In the sexual act man overcomes the play of dialectical opposites by becoming sym- bolically androgynous "and therefore whole." Sex is thus one of the keys to self-realization, which involves seven different layers of the psyche. Certain supermen (bodhisattvas) "veil the ultimate in terms suitable to time and place" (p. 40). The device by which the underly- ing Oneness is at least momentarily revealed is a system of corre- spondences (yantra) such as "ziggurats, pyramids, mysteries, myths, alchemical processes, astrological diagrams" (p. 40) and, of course, certain works of literature and art. The dialectical pattern works itself out in pulses or cycles in which "all souls must eventually be all things. The task of individual man ... is to leave things as they seem in order to discover the unknown, which is often symbolized as a descent into Hell" (p. 41). I take Mr. Senior's elaborate list of attributes at face-value, since I am not an adept at the hermetic arts. It is not the list I quarrel with, but rather with the way it is applied or by-passed. Not one of the writers presented-not even Nerval-exemplifies all twenty-one attri- butes. But nowhere is it made quite clear just how many or just which attributes must be exemplified in order for a writer to be a genuine occultist. This vagueness makes it possible to get such really unlikely candidates as Mallarm6 and Eliot into the occultist fold. Add to that vagueness a constant tendency to treat a mere interest in, or curiosity about, occultism as a genuine belief in the theory, and you will have no trouble getting Baudelaire and Rimbaud into the same fold. Equally distressing is the by-passing of the definition in favor of a procedure of guilt-by-association-or should one say rather "innocence- by-association" in this context? Baudelaire was a symbolist and an occultist. [Then one can appar- ently be a symbolist without being an occultist, even sans le savoir? A dangerous admission.] He was a friend of Nerval; he read Sweden- borg assiduously and was associated with the Fourierists in the revo- lution of 1848. Even more . . . Baudelaire not only read Eliphas LUvi, but knew him well enough to collaborate with him-they were joint authors of a piece of yellow journalism called Les Mysteres galans (p. 88). Mutatis mutandis, it sounds uncomfortably like the late senator from Wisconsin doing in some hapless State Department employee. Of the writers considered, Baudelaire, Mallarm6, and Eliot are the worst sufferers from this "associational" approach. 614</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS Finally, the substitution of occultist terminology for the actual words of a writer, or the off-hand assertion that such-and-such a passage is obviously an example of some occultist phenomenon or procedure no- where mentioned by the writer, is shifty at best. Random examples: But the intention of the organization is clear: the book [Les Fleurs du Mal] is divided into six sections, each representing a stage of the "vaporization" of the will. The Prologue ("Au lecteur") and the unfinished "Epilogue" interpret the experience in clear alchemical language (p. 98). Oh so? Then why didn't Baudelaire, who was not reticent about such matters, tell us? Or, quoting for the nth time Mallarm6's passage on "evocative" verse ("Evoquer dans une ombre expres" etc.), Mr. Senior adds for our en- lightenment: "The abolition of Chance is the equivalent of 'Moksha,' or yogic 'release'" (p. 140). And Chance is not even mentioned in the quoted passage. The final act of the hero of Mallarm6's posthumous Igitur-the throw of the dice preceding the hero's lying down in the dark of the family sepulchre-elicits this: It is the discovery that atman and brahman are one. And it should not be without significance to remind ourselves that in Indian phi- losophy the act of creation, the act, that is, which initiates the suc- cessive emanations of Brahma-his "days"-is symbolized by a throw of the dice (p. 143). It should not be without significance, but it probably is. And that gratuitous rapprochement is immediately followed by: The title as well as spinal phrase of Mallarm6's last poem is "Un Coup de dUs n'abolira le hasard." [Not quite. Mallarmd wrote "Un coup de d6s jamais n'abolira le hasard."] I shall not attempt an exegesis.... Suffice it to say that it is an attempt to create fourfold vision; it is a yantra, an attempt to express the simultaneity in time, the identity in space, of many possible forms; and this attempt unites Mallarm6 even more strongly in both theory and practice with occult tradition (p. 143). The poem is far too ambiguous for Mr. Senior to attempt an exegesis, but it is quite clear enough to allow an arbitrary occultist interpretation that is justified by nothing Mallarmd ever declared. Far from ever be- ing united with the occult tradition, Mallarm6 remained resolutely agnostic-as did his nearest and dearest disciple, Paul Val6ry. Apparently anything that is not flagrantly and openly anti-occult is liable to occult annexation by Mr. Senior. This convenient but dis- tressing procedure begins on the very first page of text. There we find (p. xi) three quotations-one from Joyce, one from Virginia Woolf, 615</page><page sequence="6">THE HUDSON REVIEW one from Faulkner-which crystallize three different moments of in- sight. (Mr. Senior uses the Joycean term "epiphany.") These epiphanies, for Mr. Senior, make occultists of the three writers. But that is nonsense, for Joyce and Woolf were, and Faulkner is, perfectly aware of occult- ism, and if they had felt their epiphanies to be occult, they would cer- tainly have let us know. Their presentations of moments of insight must be accepted just as they are; we have no right to force them into a world-view alien to their authors. Obviously these epiphanies were important to the three writers who recorded them; but those writers regarded these experiences as isolated and mysterious. That is why they gave them artistic rather than doctrinaire expression. The occult- ist generalizes (or more often, judging by the occult systems I have come across, gratuitously extrapolates) on the basis of such experiences. He deduces a world-view, a metaphysics, from them. Blake did this; the later Hugo did this. And they are occultists. Though it should be pointed out that when they were their most occult, they were often least successful as poets. This "pan-occultization" vitiates the very heart of Mr. Senior's book, which is the thesis that all the writers discussed represent a "descent into Hell." That is the only way "out", the only salvation open to us in the twentieth century; the way up, through charity and self-denial, being, for some unexplained reason, not feasible at the present time. But exactly what is this Way Down? - ... To discover the highest form of Self, we must live through the lowest first-Hell is a necessary condition of Heaven. Some Hindu schools have developed this aspect of Indian philoso- phy into libertinism. If all things are one and if recognition of all things as one's self is the necessary condition of release, it follows, according to these schools, that all possible experience, even per- verse experience, must be included as a form of love in the soul's education. What moralists call sin is actually a way to salvation. This aspect of occultism rather than asceticism has had the widest influence on romantic and symbolist literature (p. 17). We have heard all this before. The greatest sinner is the greatest saint. Left in that unqualified form, the doctrine is an invitation to moral chaos. Mr. Senior does give it a somewhat more plausible form, but even his "tantric" explanations do not make it very palatable. Be that as it may, we must agree with Mr. Senior that all the writers he dis- cusses did indeed go through agonizing crises. But the important point is that these crises were not necessarily occult in nature, or even when they were, did not necessarily take the form of the desperate embrac- ing of the lower self. Of the writers in question, only Baudelaire, Rim- baud, and Huysmans show real evidence of having cultivated vice in an effort to exhaust it and reach some sort of purity beyond. But of those three, neither Baudelaire nor Rimbaud was ever truly an occult- 616</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS ist, and the last and most important "vice" that Huysmans threw off was precisely occultism itself, to arrive, as everyone knows, in the arms of the Church. (Parenthetically, Huysmans' "occult" dealings with the Abbe Boullan are of so stupid and loathsome a character that they are enough to turn one away from occultism and Huysmans forever.) In the case of the true occultists such as Blake, Nerval, and the later Hugo: while their crises involved acute suffering-and to that extent may be described as a descent into Hell-it is still difficult to under- stand what their crises (all three so different, moreover) have in com- mon with the tantric plunge into the destructive element. But then, it becomes increasingly clear as one approaches the end of The Way Down and Out that its author's chief concern is not sym- bolist literature or even the occult aspects of some of it. Occultism itself is his chief interest. Indeed, in the postscript entitled "Epilogue: The Destructive Element" the author expresses the belief that occultism may be our best hope-if, indeed, there is any at all-in the face of our mid-twentieth-century woes. In view of what I have already said about his book, it will come as no surprise that I cannot share Mr. Senior's belief. In fact, I came away from the book with the depressing feeling of having witnessed something very close to intellectual bankruptcy. How else can one react in the face of such far-from-isolated passages as the following? - [Mr. Senior is explicating T. S. Eliot's verse:] "Garlic and sapphires in the mud/Clot the bedded axle-tree." We should find this meaning- less except for the image of the wheel suggested by the axle. The garlic and the sapphires are the opposites, mixed in the mud of this world, which whirl on the samsaric wheel. Garlic and sapphires- the stench and the glitter; the one nourishes, the other dazzles. Or perhaps the lines do not mean this at all. These are only hints and guesses. A precise idea of the image is perhaps not possible, and per- haps poets should not write this way (p. 188). No one, even occultists, should write that way. No "perhaps" about it. When the author is summarizing information, his prose manages to be fairly clear and straightforward. That prose, however, is not en- hanced by such terms as "Eliotic," "Longfellowonian," and "resu- mded." And somebody should long ago have told Mr. Senior that arriviste does not mean a new arrival in the big city; that the expres- sion is embarras de richesses and not exces de richesse, and that "co- hort" is not a synonym of "confederate" or "associate" but the word for a tenth of a legion-i.e., five to six hundred men. Finally, one mechanical defect can scarcely be overlooked, because it begins on the first page of the first chapter and continues through- out the book: the typographical errors in the quoted French texts are so numerous as to be disconcerting. 617</page></plain_text>
