<plain_text><page sequence="1">MIMI OR THE ARCHAIC ART OF ARNHEM LAND By Jan Jelinek1 my stay in Arnhem Land in 1969 and 1973, I studied seventy- three galleries of rock art containing a great number of paintings. Most of the anthropologists studying Australian rock paintings recognized two principal styles, first, the so-called 'mimi' which is considered the older; it is mono- chromatic, painted in red colour and represents mostly stylized dynamic human figures, small in size (20-30 cm); and second, the static 'X-ray style', which is considered later in age and is polychromatic and varies greatly in size. After finishing a broad comparative study it was clear that this old archaic art does not represent only small size human figures but also larger ones and in addition animal paintings. As these paintings are very important for North Australian prehistory and as their understanding is essential for many anthropological questions, I try to give here a chronological, geographical and stylistic analysis of them. Chronological evolution of the archaic style For some of the Arnhem Land localities with rock paintings we have now C14 datings. The oldest near Oenpelli and in Kolondjorluk are older than 23,000 and 17,000 years respectively and in both cases the remains of colour on the nearby rock walls were conserved. It is also not rare to find pieces of red ochre in dated archaeological layers. In some localities when observing the superposition of paintings we see that red hand stencils are the oldest art: they are overpainted by all other paintings and styles. This is especially so in Nangalore and Kolondjorluk, where such stencils are concentrated in great numbers. Even the archaic dynamic figures of spearmen holding the spear in hand without the use of womera are painted over them. When considering the question of still older existing paintings, we must mention some archaic paintings of human figures without any tools and some snake and kangaroo paintings over which other paintings were unfortunately not superimposed. Their dating is uncertain and the style and the degree of preservation show that they can belong to a very old archaic style of painting. The snake pictures are simple and the bodies of the kangaroos are usually filled with short strokes. Their age in relation to the hand stencils cannot be fixed. 1 Head, Anthropos Institute, Moravian Museum. Brno. C.S.S.R. President, International Council of Museums. Arch, ã Phys.

The womera is unknown but the use of the boomerang as a weapon is frequent. Some of these human figures are painted in groups but no real scenes can be found. They are later than the hand stencils. Contemporary with them are some animal paintings e.g. opossum, echidna and thylacine at the Upper Cadell River crossing, snake in the Cooper Creek gallery, birds in Inagurdurwil and Mt. Brockman and kangaroos in Upper Cadell River, Bulman Gorge or Kolondjorluk galleries. The third group is represented by human-like static figures usually painted in thin lines. Mostly they are larger than the archaic dynamic figures and some of them (e.g. in Inagurdurwil or Upper Cadell River crossing) are 150 cm and even more in size. Contemporary with them are most probably groups of dynamic figures representing fighting, dancing and various corroborée scenes (East Alligator River area). The fourth group of the latest and recent paintings is painted usually in white colour. These are exceptional and are contemporary with the peak of X-ray style paintings production. They are executed in dynamic mode (e.g. in El Sherano, Djerlandjal rock) and strongly contrast with the rigid X-ray style. They prove the persistence of the dynamic style up to recent time. The relationship of the archaic dynamic and static style paintings to the X-ray style paintings deserves our attention. The usual idea in anthropological literature is that the monochromatic archaic red paintings are limited to the prehistoric period followed later by the X-ray style. As I mentioned above, the archaic style is not limited to the prehistoric period only, but exists - even though sporadically - up to recent time, where it is contemporary with the developed X-ray style. On the other hand, X-ray style is not limited to the recent period only. Oldest paintings in this style are found - again only sporadically - already in early periods where they are contemporary with the archaic static paintings (e.g. in Cannon Hill, Mt. Brockman, Inagurdurwil) (Jelinek, 1978). Isolated X-ray characters appear even in the dynamic archaic style (e.g. Upper Cadell River crossing). In all galleries mentioned above, the chronological relationship of the two main rock art styles is proved by numerous superpositions as well as by the degree of weathering of different styles under identical conditions. Many examples prove also that the archaic style was not originally always monochromatic but that yellow (Cannon Hill, Old Woman's Dreaming, Kolondjorluk, Upper Cadell River crossing) and white colours (Mt. Brockman, Inagurdurwil, Obiri, Upper Cadell River crossing) were also used. The oldest examples of developed X-ray style paintings are often preserved only in red as the red colour was much more resistant than white or yellow which are therefore preserved only exceptionally.</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAIC ART OF ARNHEM LAND 231 If we try to correlate the archaic paintings archaeologically we see that in the neighbourhood of the archaic dynamic and static paintings we find frequently stone tools known in Australian prehistory as 'pirri culture'. This name is certainly not satisfactory because the unifacial 'pini points' form only the minority in corresponding assemblages. Bifacial small points form another important component of the same assemblages. The oldest examples of archaic paintings are older than the so-called 'piri-culture' and the latest examples in white colour are contemporary with the recent blade assemblages (sometimes called Oenpellian'). Geographical differences in archaic paintings Some Australian experts consider the East Alligator River area the centre of North Australian rock art. This opinion is certainly based on the great number of rock art galleries in this area and of the limited knowledge of other regions in Arnhem land and in North Australia in general. The East Alligator River area is undoubtedly one of the most important centres of North Australian rock art both for X-ray paintings and also for archaic style paintings. Some striking features of the latter in this area are: the early presence of womera, the use of yellow and white colours and the characteristic 'S' shape of dynamic human figures. Another important area is Kolondjorluk Creek (the tributary of the Deaf Adder Creek) where in spite of the later East Alligator River influence many local characters were developed. One of them is the presence of the character- istic anthropomorphic yam paintings (archaic style), the use of yellow colour and the great number of the oldest red hand stencils. The C14 date from this locality is 17,000. The third important area is the Upper Cadell River crossing. The archaic human figures are sometimes in less dynamic positions and the use of yellow starts with the static figures in which individual characters of the X-ray style are frequently found. Static figures with incipient X-ray characters are often of considerable size. Pictures of boomerangs are frequent and the use of the woomera is relatively late. In Nangalore, which is situated west from the East Alligator River, we found influences both from East Alligator and from Kolondjorluk areas. Characteristic are local walking-like figures with unusual hairdress. Many red hand stencils are found here. The oldest examples of painted forearms (static paintings period) link Nangalore area with East Alligator River and New Guinea respectively (Jelinek, 1978). Another group of the archaic style human figures was discovered in Northern Kimberley: the Bradshaw figures (Crawford, 1968, chap. 10) and still another one in Cape York (Trezise, 1969). Important parallels are found as far as</page><page sequence="4">232 ARCHAIC ART OF ARNHEM LAND New Guinea (Jelinek, 1977). The squatting figures, archaic static style parallels, not to mention the X-ray characters, are the most striking and it is clear that these similarities with New Guinea art have prehistoric roots. This is not surprising in the light of other parallels in material culture (e.g. the presence of womeras), and in mythology as well as similar faunal elements documenting past contacts and relationships. The common character for archaic paintings of all Central and West Arnhem Land areas is the mode of painting in lines and the division into three main chronological groups, namely (1) red hand stencils, (2) dynamic human figures and (3) static figures or dynamic scenes. The analysis of the archaic rock paintings The striking feature of these paintings in Arnhem Land is that they are mostly situated in places quite unsuitable for living sites. Often they are high in cliffs, which were very difficult and even dangerous to climb. In this way they are quite different from the X-ray paintings which are mostly situated in places within easy reach, mostly in rock overhangs suitable as living sites. The typical dynamic figures are usually 20 cm high, exceptionally bigger (30cm or more) or smaller (even 2-3 cm small figures are known). The corresponding animals and fish paintings as well as static, archaic figures vary in size. As for the colours used, the red colour in different shades certainly prevails. Nevertheless, it is evident that also white and yellow were used but they both survived only exceptionally. Red was more resistant, penetrating easily into the rock. The older the paintings, the darker is their red colour. Brighter red paintings are always younger than dark red ones. Oxidization most likely plays a decisive role. Studying the subjects represented in these paintings, we see that human figures are more numerous than animal. They hold mostly a long single-headed spear in hand without womera. Also the boomerang is often represented in archaic dynamic figures, though some of these are without any tool. Dynamic figures of spearmen are frequent and survive for a very long time. Exceptionally, we find them even in X-ray style recent paintings (e.g. in Djerlandjal). Different hairdresses are characteristic for certain areas. The oldest animal paintings represent kangaroos (often with the body covered with short strokes), snakes and fish; later are echidna, thylacine, fish, opossum, birds etc. Rainbow snake (in Kolondjorluk, a female one), is sometimes represented. It shows the great age of this mythological tradition. We do not find sorcery figures and mamandi evil spirits, so typical in later X-ray style paintings. Only one exception is known to us; it is in the Cahills Crossing area on the East Alligator River (late archaic style). We find some examples of static figures depicting magical function.

Detailed observations of human figures show frequently some non-human characters, mainly in the face, showing that these figures represent mostly mythological beings or spirits. If we ask what was the social meaning of early archaic art, we must assume that it was not linked with living or with burial sites. No erotic meaning was ever observed. In the late archaic paintings in which fighting or corroborée scenes were represented, an historical or mythological meaning is probable. The former is the case if an actual event is recorded in the painting. We can exclude from archaic paintings ceremonial use (in the usual meaning of the word) as the position of the majority of them makes impossible the participation of more than one individual. Certainly for the archaic dynamic art mostly mythological and sometimes religious (totemic) meanings remain. In Aboriginal mythology the "mimi" spirits are small thin spirits living in rock country. And bearing in mind the very slow pace of change in Aborigines' culture, especially in their spiritual culture, the idea of "mimi" spirits is most probably an old one, even of prehistoric age. As the "mimi" denotes human-like spirits and as the archaic paintings cover many more (even animal) subjects of different ages and areas, I prefer the general designation 'archaic art'.
