<plain_text> <page sequence="1">      II NEGATIVE CAPABILITY ‘The New Men’ will be people with an immense store of negative capability, taking a provisional world for granted and not asking for permanent assurances or faiths anchored in fixed systems ... I believe I am such myself and thanks to a great indifference to what other people think I have been a happy man most of my life.1 Introduction Hope was naturally drawn towards the concept of ‘negative capability’; it provided him with an unlimited environment in which he could taste, test and explore the vagaries of human existence. Life was to be a continual celebration of ‘being’ and ‘becoming’, lived with a sense of irony and Nietzschean perspectivism.2 Hope, as a young poet, acknowledged that the creative life was as significant in human existence as a life of action or a life of contempla- tion.The poet was most rich if he/she was continually open to a field of forces unhampered by the privilege of one epistemological, logical or metaphysical set of values. It was the face behind the mask and beyond the strictures of codes and ‘truths’ that he was most intent on bringing into his metaphorical field. Hope feared that what we know often gets in the way of what we might learn, and that such a perspective requires page 35 a joyful embrace of all hypothetical explanations of the world. Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="2">       As a creator, Hope, the poet, was amused by the way most people around him thought. Having understood all stories from life as metaphors, whether embodied in gods, cosmological theories or moral axioms, he, in the spirit of ‘negative capability’, enjoyed finding the flaw in the argument that had foolishly promised a truth of some kind. It would not be far-fetched to conceive of Hope like Nietzsche’s Zarathustra: a wanderer, a nomad, a homeless creator laughing at certainties yet inspired by the way metaphor is active in gathering its strength in a continual process of displacement and transference. This does not, however, make him unaware that the passing of some beliefs is a great loss to the human spirit. Entries in his notebooks cite, for example, the belief in the eternal life of the soul, a rich source of metaphor and story that once played a fruitful role in the creative life. Hope’s perspectivism, his insistence on the shifting nature of all paradigms of thought, whether sociological, moral or scientific, fuels his representation of people as active, contemplative and creative beings. THE THREE FACES OF LOVE L’animo, ch’è creato ad amor presto, Ad ogni cosa è mobile che piace, Tosto che dal piacere è desto. Vostra apprensira da esser verace Tragge intenzione, e dentro a voi la spiega, Si che l’animo ad essa volger face ... Poi come il foco movesi in altura per la sua forma, ch’è nata a salire ...3 — Purgatorio XVIII, II, 19–33. This suggests another way in which we could make a clear distinction between the contemplative emotions and the active, without neces- sarily accepting the scholastic and Aristotelian psychology. For it is true that every object can be both an object in itself or the original of an object in the mind with which the mind connects it. It is true that page 36 there is a pleasure in the thought or sight of an object of desire which Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="3">        accompanies the first movement to attain it and another and different pleasure of attainment, fruition and contentment. Now the object may be pursued and enjoyed in itself and this is active life. But we may also enjoy the object of thought, imagination or memory or the object itself as though it were an object of thought, in itself: as there is no need to do anything in order to attain the image which is there without effort and sometimes without volition; the pleasure is different from those concerned in active pursuit of the original object: this is contemplative life. But if from the objects of contemplation we are moved to create further objects in the world by music, painting, poems dances and so on, then a third sort of pleasure arises — that which is out-going not intaking, expressive not possessive and the end of which is another pleasure: that of contemplation again: this is creative life. The objects of creative life, once created, become, of course, objects of the first two sorts and only creative life is life sui generis. Thus, where the scholastic distinction sees only two kinds of activity, I would think there should be three. And so the mind can desire in three ways and find three kinds of satisfaction of its desires. I should, in Thomistic or Aristotelian terms, describe these as the three aspects or modes of Love in human minds and hearts. St Thomas might agree that the third, as more like the divine nature, is the highest. But of course he makes a sharp distinction between Divine and human creation. — Book VI, 1959, pp. 4–5. ‘PARADISE LOST’ It all depends on the subordinate position of Eve ... ‘He for God only, she for God in him’ ... Without this, is there any reason why Satan should not have decided to tempt Adam first? Suppose Adam to have succumbed to flattery of his understanding only a little less crude than that to which Eve succumbs; suppose, as well, that he tries to tempt Eve to eat the apple too and that she, already pregnant and weighing the risk of Adam’s life against that of her unborn child, quite naturally refuses. This would be to tamper with the original story but not much more than Milton has already tampered with it. But how would the page 37 fall of Adam look then, poor thing? And how would the great poem Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="4">      look, even supposing Eve not to be pregnant at the time, had she refused, let us say for fear of the consequences and not from genuine obedience, to eat the apple. As a good wife she would continue to live with Adam, whom she loved in any case. In due course she became pregnant. But what of original sin? What part in Adam’s fall would his children then have had? Theological myths have to be very carefully arranged if they are to carry any conviction. You cannot have a great epic called ‘Paradise Half-Lost’. — Book VI, 1959, p. 26. RELATIVE MORALS If the natural history of morals were to reveal that what is considered moral or immoral in any society, reflects the needs and desires of that society at a certain stage of its existence, then one would expect certain moral views to outlast their usefulness. In a society living more or less at subsistence level gluttony is obviously a crime and a sin because it is equivalent to murdering or starving other people. And for the same reason infanticide may be a moral duty. But in a society with an excess or a sufficiency of food gluttony is a venial fault that affects the indi- vidual only and [is] condemned no more severely than personal vanity — not pleasant but not important. Many primitive societies approve or condone homosexuality. ‘Christian societies’ count it a sin. But a society, threatened with over-population might well make it a virtue, as medieval Christianity made chastity a virtue. In a complex society based on ownership as a source of power and position, theft, envy and greed are obviously bound to be major sins, but a simple society living easily without any sentiment for prestige based on goods would have no reason to consider these ‘deadly sins’ as more than bad manners. It is difficult to imagine a society in which murder and wrath would not be crime and sin respectively, since they are always disruptive — nor one in which love and kindness would not be virtues. There seems at any rate to be a confusion in most collections of virtues and vices, sins and laudable acts, between acts and states which are deleterious or beneficial in themselves to the agent, and those which are indifferent to the agent but deleterious or beneficial page 38 to society. Dishonesty and cruelty corrupt the agent and harm others. Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="5">         But eating and drinking and fucking seem only to harm the agent if carried to excess, or intermitted altogether. Their social effects vary according to the circumstances. But there is nothing inherently corrupting or destructive in any of them. — Book VI, 1960, pp. 71–2. MEMENTO MORI The fact that each of us must die, that science can provide no discovery to prevent it, social legislation no protection or alleviation, that each of us must face one disaster that cannot be shared or sold or outwitted is the last protection against a protected and sheltered comfort which increasingly the race takes to be its natural condition. This is the last bulwark against the triviality and frivolity of mind that complete safety and comfort tend to bring with them. There is a sense in which the abolition of death would be the negation of life. A time may well come in which most of the material problems of man’s life on earth will be overcome and each will be assured of comfort and security from the cradle to the grave. Men’s minds will be led to consider death as their last serious problem. There will arise a poetry of death, a philosophy of death and even a cult of death unlike anything of the sort before, though several societies have had such cults. — Book VI, 1960, p. 89. ‘THE SOUL SECURED I’ The Soul, secur’d in her existence, smiles  at the drawn dagger, and defies its point The stars shall fade away, the sun himself  Grow dim with age and Nature sink in years; but then shalt flourish in immortal youth unhurt amid the war of elements the wrecks of matter, and the crush of worlds. page 39 — Cato: V.I. Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="6">        A great change has come over things since these noble lines were written. For the great mass of people engaged by the practical life and absorbed by it, an after-life was probably a holding concern, some- thing to be secured in this world but to be attended to when it came along. For those engaged in the intellectual life, a world in which a few intellectuals believe or even entertain the notion of the immortal soul makes a great difference to their intellectual pursuits. This is not so much a matter of belief or lack of belief in an immortal soul, but a result of the fact that through ancient philosophy and Christian theology, the soul was regarded as the seat and agent of all the rational and intellectual powers of man. A thinking animal, fallible and ephemeral is a very different thing from a permanent intellectual creature temporarily attached to its animal and only partly dependent on it for the operation and success of its rational powers. The older belief may have been in error, but if so, it is an example of those fruitful errors which made for a noble conception of human life and gave the intellectual life a superior dignity and appeal. The decline of regard for the contemplative life in our world is in part due to this and the loss of this regard is severe and may be fatal in the long run. — Book VIII, 1961, pp. 2–3. OPAQUE GLASS Ingenious devices for letting in the light without allowing you to see out, such as modern techniques provide — eg., glass brick walls, crinkle-glass, sanded glass and so on — remind me very much of most present-day forms of education. — Book VII, 1961, p. 4. FAITH AND CERTAINTY In the quarrel between a materialist and a religious view of the world, each side is apt to claim certainty for its side and to point out how page 40 Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="7">       much the other depends on unprovable and even unwarranted hypotheses. The type of mind which can be content to recognise the hypotheses on both sides without demanding certainty in either seems comparatively rare. A continual exercise of suspended judgement on matters which admit of no proof seems almost impossible to most temperaments and an attempt to keep it up seems to produce a corrup- tion of intellectual fibre or a relapse into indifference. To such minds the contemplation of the limits of human knowledge is gruesome. They must opt for one of the alternatives and compensate with the emotional ‘certainty’ of a faith for the intellectual certainty which the facts deny them. The exceptional minds are marked out by joy, the exhilaration with which they are able to contemplate the hypothet- ical nature of all explanations of the world. — Book VII, 1961, p. 128. THE ENLIGHTENMENT One important result of the Enlightenment and all its continuations has been to demonstrate that if you remove the bases of their supersti- tions, people will simply invent others for themselves often more harmful for wearing an appearance of science or rational structure which blinds the believers to the false premises. This has happened so often since the eighteenth century, and in so many departments of knowledge, and so many spheres of action, that it suggests that superstition is necessary to men and societies, that it at least supplies a need for which no substitute has yet been found. But it may also suggest that what science calls superstitions, fallible as their ideas may prove to be, supply spurious answers to real questions which science is too limited by its own presuppositions — dare one say, its own superstitions to consider the force of. The failure of the Enlightenment was to deny the reality of the questions along with that of the answers. — Book VIII, 1964, p. 19. page 41 Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="8">          PANTHEON I am so used, by the attitude of my age and upbringing, to thinking of any god as a doubtful concept and many gods as mere absurdity that it comes as a surprise travelling in the Peloponnese to feel the gods near, quite natural and exercising their numinous force. On the bus from Argos to Olympia across the Arcadian plateau, it came as no surprise to recognise the bus-driver as Pan, whom he very closely resembled both in features and bearing. Not even the fact that he stopped the bus to say a prayer at a wayside shrine as we began our descent towards Olympia destroyed the illusion, since so many Christian shrines are on the spot occupied by a pagan before them. The little nun who showed us round at Agia Moni [Zoodochos Pigi]4 the ancient well and spring of Hera, where she renewed her virginity annually, now the Virgin Mary’s spring, kept crossing herself all the time she stood with us. I put out my hand to touch the water but found myself impelled to desist with a powerful feeling of sacrilege. In the same way, it was not merely a series of thunderstorms at Olympia, marking the end of the autumn and the beginning of the rains, but a sense of Zeus the Thunderer, himself — as though the thunder had taken on a personal note never heard before. On the spot, it is not only natural, but quite easy to believe in a Pantheon of gods and to find the notion of a single ‘monolithic’, abstract deity contradictory and unsatisfactory. In the desert of Arabia it might be the other way about. Certainly if one is going to give assent to the possibility of supernatural beings at all — or perhaps superhuman would be a better word, it is the ‘naturalness’ of the Greek Pantheon that wins assent — then there seems no reason to stop at one. Theology knows nothing of Occam’s Razor,5 since it is an area of speculation in which the critical words ‘praeter necessitaten’ have no relevance and perhaps no meaning. — Hydra 1965 — Book VIII, 1965, pp. 140–1. page 42 Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="9">          PRIVATE AND PUBLIC Classification, grouping things together as similar in some respect or similar in the way we feel about them, is sometimes quite conscious and explicit and it requires an explicit effort to free oneself from an arbitrary prejudice when such a classification happens to be baseless, eg., classing fornication with murder, social standing or lack of it with worth or ability, whales with fish and so on. Sometimes we do not classify at all but behave as though we did, and the explicit statement of the group and its members can be illu- minating or at any rate entertaining. For example, there are certain activities which we habitually perform in public with no sense of unease or incongruity; others which are not so and which, if we have to do them in public, make us uncomfortable at the least and so acutely shamed or mortified at the most, that we may be willing to go to any lengths to avoid them, like poor Virginie in the shipwreck or Margaret Fuller for that matter, if anyone doubts the truth of Bernardin de St Pierre’s fiction.6 The list of private activities differs from society to society, from age to age and from class to class in the same society, but in my own it makes a curious but very real ‘group’: pissing, shitting, making love, copu- lating, sleeping, bathing, praying, writing (especially poetry), going naked ... there are a few others, but few: almost any society will have still others and omit some of these. Some for example pray in public, some have no objection to nakedness or making love in public. In fact the actual nature of the act does not matter very much. It is the way it is regarded or the conditions under which it can be carried on — writing and praying need to be uninterrupted as other forms of art or of worship do not. It is interesting that writing is distinguished in this way from all the other arts. It is the only one that cannot be practised in public. — Book IX, 1965, pp. 3–4. page 43 Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="10">                 THE MIRRORS 1965–68 If I make the lashes dark And the eyes more bright And the lips more scarlet Or ask if all be right From mirror after mirror, No vanity’s displayed: I’m looking for the face I had Before the world was made. W. B. Yeats: A Woman Young and Old7 It is much the same for a poet as for the woman or the actor. It is what Yeats called the ‘Mask’, what Keats called the operation of negative capability — essentially a means of looking into a mirror to find something other than oneself, which is to become oneself for the time of creation. — Book IX, 1966, pp. 138–9. PROTECTIVE COLOURING Reading Montherlant’s Le Chaos et La Nuit, it occurs to me how apt we are to see types like his Celestino as aberrations from a normal human make up. It is this that makes him absurd and delightfully monstrous. In the book he is treated, too, as Spanish and, therefore, from a French point of view, racially and inherently monstrous. But of course he is nothing of the sort: he is an example of Congreve’s idea of a ‘humorous’ character. An extreme case of what we are all like more or less. He pursues his humour, he is stupid, he cuts himself off from his surroundings and so loses the protective colouring that most social animals learn to adopt. I find it easier in a foreign country like this to see that for all my enjoyment of Celestino, I am probably as much a grotesque if they could know me as we are allowed to know Celestino, to the Puerto Ricans and negroes with whom I am surrounded in page 44 West Side New York.  Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="11">               The great thing about the interpolated tales in Don Quixote is the way they bring out the ‘relative’ nature of social values, in class, in race, in country and epoch. Each has its normal men, but the norms are of such a kind that there is no normal norm; there is no normal society, and since no man exists outside a society, there is no ‘normal man’. Yet most social, moral and other types of value theory are built on the supposition. Most literature takes it for granted.  — New York, June 1967 — Book IX, 1967, pp. 66–7. NEW MEN Another possibility would not be the usual speculative emergence of some kind of Übermensch or the development of hitherto unknown kinds of mental power, but simply the fading out of certain limiting conditions which prevent men as they are living in the world as it is. The greatest problem is that morally, socially, artistically we are brought up and adapted to deal with a world of a definite and defin- able kind. In the past if a new world view came into being it was as definite as the old one; doubt could exist only as to which was the true one. We are all fundamentally Big-Endians or Little-Endians.8 But now we live in a world which offers us a choice of possible cosmolo- gies and keeps on changing the choice so fast that we have no time to build a permanent belief on any. The same is true of biology, psychology, social theory, ethics. All our knowledge is provisional and we are trying to live by ‘permanent’ or ‘reliable’ beliefs and principles in what is and from now on promises to be a purely ‘provisional’ world. The New Men will be people with an immense store of nega- tive capability, taking a provisional world for granted and not asking for permanent assurances or faiths anchored in fixed systems. I meet such people from time to time. Often they are unhappy because the ‘fixed believers’ who form the majority have persuaded them that they are irresponsible or defective, when in fact they are the most healthy and whole of men. I believe I am such myself and thanks to a great indifference to what other people think I have been a happy man most of my life. page 45 — Book X, 1968, pp. 19–20. Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="12">        DEFECT VERSUS ILLUSION I In the debate between Science and Religion, the general assumption is that religion has the worst of it because it cannot produce any testable ‘facts’. It cannot devise any social or controlled experiment to decide between the two points of view. Neither of course can science, but science is not on the defen- sive, believes it has no onus of proof and has accumulated a pretty pile of evidence for its point of view ... or so it thinks. Those who believe in God have, they say, ‘experience’ of God but they cannot produce this experience to be tested and they have no means of proving that it is not an illusion, as their opponents claim it to be. But neither can their opponents prove that it is not a power or a sense that not everyone possesses, like colour vision for example, and that it is they who are ‘defective’ not the others who are deluded. II One could regard the extreme mystic experience and the hunger and incompleteness of these types of mind as a perfectly normal but terminal unit in a human series of which the other terminal unit is the happy solipsist, the person to whom this is an imperfect and unsatisfactory world because of the plurality of beings in it, whose ideal is the opposite of union with God, the self contemplation of his single self in an empty universe. Both yearn for and can adumbrate or suggest an experience which is ineffable. Each, perhaps is aiming at the same consummation, imperfectly understood, but setting off in the opposite direction from the other. I must stay where I am, but I must try to follow those journeys in imagination. — Book X, 1968, pp. 54–5. page 46 Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="13">         NATURAL LAW ‘There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.’ ‘Beauty is in the eye of the beholder’, etc. etc. It is interesting that this should so often be taken as incompatible with natural law (in ethics), the reality of beauty (in esthetics), even the objective reality of values in economics. There is certainly much to be said for such views and it is impossible to prove them wrong. But if we accept them we have not proved the unreality, the relativity or the illusory nature of values — was this the existentialist fallacy perhaps? — we have simply said that values are man-made, as cities and ivilizations and the music of Bach and Beethoven are man-made. The mistake arises perhaps from the view that man, and what he thinks and does are not a part of nature, the view that opposes the natural to the artificial. — Book X, 1969, p. 91. NEGATIVE CAPABILITY What Keats has said on this subject seems to me of the first impor- tance, but it deals only or perhaps primarily with the poet’s relations with his world and time. There is another way of looking at the same idea which considers the poet’s relations with his art. A great deal of the time of my genera- tion has gone into endless discussion of the ‘true nature’ of poetry, the superiority of one technique to another, the stimulating business of revolution and heresy hunting, and in particular the obsession with ‘originality’ and novelty to a point where it seemed obvious to many that a new method was necessarily a better method. A degree of negative capability in the writer which allows him to enter into all theories and all techniques, to test and taste with no irritable concern with right and wrong, with mine and thine, might be what is badly needed. — Williamstown, Mass., 1969  — Book X, 1969, p. 93. page 47 Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="14">        EDDINGTON’S NET Apart from these two pure numbers [the ‘fine structure constant’ and the ratio of the masses of electrons and protons] the subject [of physics] in his day appeared to be almost closed. Eddington produced the intellectually stimulating idea that the whole of physics might possibly be analogous to the activities of an ichthyologist ... who devoted a long and distinguished scien- tific career to the discovery of the basic biological law which bears his name. The law states that ‘no fish are less than two inches long’. The ichthyologist never realised that his law was nothing but a reflection of the size of the mesh of the net in which he caught specimens for his study. P. T. Matthews: The Nuclear Apple, p. 23. Matthews goes on to make fun of Eddington and concludes that ‘there seems no justification nowadays [1971] for the view that the whole content of physics is determined by the techniques which define its boundaries — that nothing comes out which has not implicitly been put in’. This is rather puzzling. The framing of an hypothesis, the evolu- tion of a new technique to test this hypothesis, is of course implicitly putting in what we expect to come out. There is no other method of procedure, as the author seems to imply there is. What Eddington’s Parable of the Net is meant to do is to keep the theorist and the experi- menter aware of the ‘Fallacy of the Net’ implicit in our thinking. It is no different from the advances in mathematics or logic due, in the last few years, to study of the way the techniques of these sciences tend to define their boundaries. But there are great areas of human thinking to which the Fallacy of the Net still needs to be applied and in particular to ‘reticulation’ imposed on us by the span of consciousness. We have become well aware in the last half-century of the sorts of events possible below the minimum threshold, but those which may be concealed from us above the maximum are still in unknown territory. The limitations of the nets thrown into the ocean of Being by the senses [have] been partly explored (as have some missed by the senses altogether, eg., those parts of the electro-magnetic series outside colour and warmth) and page 48 their capacities enlarged by instruments, but those imposed by the Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="15">        brain itself are only beginning to be surmised. Once the idea takes hold one cannot stop. It applies to every area of knowledge, of aware- ness, of introspection or of social intercourse. We can see ourselves as savages on an atoll trying to make a world picture on the basis of the flotsam and jetsam of the shoreline. Eddington’s Net becomes the basis of a new world-view. Eddington’s Net applies, of course, to the formulation of his own parable. Because the nets used by his scientist are small, as the reticu- lations of the net are definite, it excludes fishes larger than the net can take as well as letting those too small to be taken escape. Eddington’s preoccupations limited the scope of his parable. Moreover his ‘scientific’ approach excluded a parable that would have taken in the poetry of earth as well as its measurements. — Ballina, 24–IX–72 — Book XIV, 1972, pp. 36–9, FINAL CAUSE I wonder whether it has occurred to anyone that the idea of God may be one towards which the universe is working rather than that from which it arises, a Final Cause rather than a Prime Mover. Immediately on asking this silly question I take the trouble to find out and find it a fairly constant preoccupation of philosophers and theologians though they are not usually raising the idea as such. It comes into some forms of Pantheism. — Book XII, 1971–2, pp. 96–7. I expect it has. Everything has been thought of before, but there may be a new way of putting this one, that would make it practically a new idea. Could analysis of history and biology suggest what sort of a God we are in fact in [the] process of evolving? Could any survey of colonial animals have predicted even one of the possible forms of multi-cellular animals? I imagine not even the lowliest, let alone the most advanced. Evolution is one science, like cosmology, in which prediction is page 49 not a result of accredited theory. Not even the most experienced Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="16">                    specialist in a set of related species can predict which way the cat will jump next to evolve a new one. But he can describe the ways in which it tends to happen and prepare us for the unexpected. If in the past man has been busy making God in his own image, it must be remembered that he is only just beginning to learn to shape and control his own image. When he learns about that, religion may take a quite unexpected turn. So far it has been the other way about. Men’s image of God has been anthropomorphic — even the most abstract and rational ones — and the image of God thus formed has limited his power to advance in finding new images of man. What might not be possible if we were to realise that we were the active partners in the adventure of the Divine? THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE What worries me about the claims sometimes made that modern physicists have not only abandoned determinism but dispensed with logic in their operations and theories is that however much this may apply to the objects of their investigations, it obviously does not apply to the way they investigate and reason. Their experiments assume a determinism, a cause-effect regularity in the way they set them up, record and deduce the results, which they deny to the results them- selves. They argue by common logic that their results can only be explained in terms that call common logic [into] question.  Until this anomaly is cleared up it is pointless for supporters of extra-sensory perception or psycho-kinesis to claim support from modern particle physics. It is the old fallacy of ignotum per ignotius. I remember talking to Sir John Ecclesix about Newton’s hint in the last edition of the Principia which was taken up by early psychologists of the Hartley School. They set to work on a sort of psychological physics on the theory of a sort of mental atoms to be called vibratuncle, if I remember the term correctly. It was the first attempt at a scientific approach to what is now called para-psychology and it failed because nobody could find or demonstrate a vibratuncle. Eccles rather thought he could and that he could demonstrate it interacting with an atom. page 50 Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="17">              This arises from reading Koestler’s messy little book The Roots of Coincidence, the motto of which might well be ‘Once a journalist, always a journalist’, that is to say a man who tries to argue in an expert field with only superficial knowledge (eg., what I am now doing). It seems to me that the whole of Koestler’s argument by analogy is on the wrong track. A better line might well be along the lines that to deal with the world around [us], we have had to limit and formalise our perceptions to exclude certain perfectly natural forces and types of operation which could have been alternative methods of perception and communication — a specialisation observable almost everywhere in nature. There is no need in fact to appeal to the analogy of physics, even if the analogy could be demonstrated. (Use for The Abdiel Appendix)10 — Book XV, 1973, pp. 16–18. MORE THOUGHTS ON ECONOMICS OF TIME [See Notebook XII, 1971, pp. 8–12: London, 1971, Economics of Space and Time] The economics of Time gives each of us a roughly equivalent capital which cannot be bartered or exchanged. This gives the economics of time a stability which the economics of space, of goods and posses- sions and money does not have. But it is subject to inflation of a sort. Those religions which preach a life after death or before birth, or which promise both in the form of a soul continually reborn in other bodies, affect the value of our time holdings in much the same way as the wildest inflation of a currency system. — Book XIX, 1976, p. 2. ALL THINGS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL Cecil Alexander’s hymn was a great favourite of mine as a child and there was a special magic in the image: page 51 Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="18">            The purple-headed mountain The river running by  which it still has for me. I don’t think I noticed the illogical optimism of the idea that all the bright and beautiful things were God’s handi- work while nothing was said about the darker side of his creation. And I was quite ready to accept the social theory of The rich man in his castle The poor man at his gate, God made them high or lowly  And ordered their estate. Of course I took it in the sense the author intended: God was on the side of the landed gentry — his attitude to riches acquired by trade or manufacture was not considered. However in some ways it now seems to me a witless production and though I still sing it with pleasure I have altered the text to suit myself. All things bright and beautiful All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful, The Lord God made them all,  etc. To be followed by All things dark and dreadful, Beasts that live by blood All monsters and disasters Of Famine, Plague or Flood, Shark and snake and spider And every deadly pest, The good Lord God, remember, He made them with the rest. I should like to think that Cecil Alexander could hear me. — 17–1–1976 page 52 — Book XIX, 1976, pp. 4–5. Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="19">              CELESTIAL LIGHT Wordsworth’s There was a time when meadow, grove and stream To me did seem Apparelled in celestial light11 is usually not taken literally. It is assumed that the illumination was in Wordsworth himself and not an actual light — an extra light — on the landscape itself. Wordsworth encourages this notion with the clumsy ‘to me did seem’, as though in recollection he doubts that he actually saw it. He reinforces it later in the ode when he confesses that this no longer happens to him: ‘where is it now, the glory ...?’ etc. But it occurs to me that we can take him quite literally and that it [is] an experience shared by many other people — a sudden or momentary experience with some; involuntary with some; with others almost a permanent state and one that can at any rate be called up at will. The similar reports of people under the influence of particular drugs, such as mescalin might suggest that the effect is an illusion due to some abnormal physiological condition. On the other hand, recent experiments on people who see ‘auras’ and/or a halo of some force round living matter, which can be photographed and seen as a shifting and vibrating pattern of light in such photographs, might suggest that it is an effect external to the observer. Traherne’s ‘orient and immortal wheat’ comes to mind and many other reports. I have experienced it myself at times — usually only briefly — as an effect of a light added to the ordinary light of the sun or of lamps and differentiated from such light by an intense ‘stasis’ and a feeling that it emanates from the objects observed. — Carlton, 1976 — Book XIX, 1976, pp. 84–5. OBJECTIVE STUPIDITY In the years that I had to deal with various kinds of ‘objective tests’ in page 53 which one has to choose between various preferred answers, my objec- Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="20">          tion to every sort except those testing minutiae of information was always the same: the candidate was not asked to think anything out for himself. The tests were only of that lower sort of intelligence which can judge between alternative solutions to a problem. The higher sort of intelligence which is required for judging the problem itself and devising one’s own possible solutions was never called into play. The candidate more intelligent, creative or critical than his examiners had no chance to display his real quality (someone like the young mathematician Abel, for example). It seemed to me an adequate method of testing only servile or second-rate minds. When I visited the research centre in this sort of examining near Princeton in 1958 and spent a day with the specialists on their admittedly very sophisticated ‘objective tests’ for ability in English, I could not get them to admit that their tests still suffered from this major defect. In fact, when they claimed that their methods were being adopted by college after college and that soon all tertiary educa- tion would go over to the system, I refrained from saying that it seemed a good way to make the country safe for mediocrity. Today in a foolish spy thriller by a man who otherwise shows all the gifts of a novelist, Billion Dollar Brain by Len Deighton, I came across the perfect description of the system. The hero, after taking one of these tests, remarks: ‘We were then given a simple exam which consisted of crossing out stupid answers in order to leave the least stupid one.’12 That of course is the whole point. The answer preferred may in fact not be stupid at all, but because the examinee has not arrived at it for himself he has answered stupidly and if there is a better alternative (as there so often is if one has time to think about it), which he could have given, he has been reduced to the level of the moderately bright dullard.  In order to limit the possible ‘right’ answers, the deviser of the test has to exclude from his mind all other possible ways of looking at the problem than the one he chooses. He has to eliminate  imagination, and suppress his more subtle habits of manipulating and recognising the innate ambiguity of language. He has to ignore the difference that ‘context’ makes to a question or a statement and to do this is forced to choose only run-of-the-mill contexts implying his own culture and epoch. In other words, he has to impose dullness on himself in order to frame his tests. At a deeper level the subject touches on the most important division of human beings one from another, those who operate within page 54 a system of experience or ideas or values which work well enough and Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="21">              with which they are content; for them in theory at least, ‘objective tests’ are feasible — and those who are constantly aware of the limita- tions of the systems which for practical reasons we are all compelled to work with, those again for whom creation of new ideas or values is their constant preoccupation. For such people the whole notion of inventing an objective test is absurd, since those who frame the questions do not know what to ask, and even if they did, cannot tell beforehand which answers will be right or wrong. I cannot at the moment put my finger on the point, but this note seems to be worth considering for The New Cratylus. — Mysore, 15–1–77 — Book XIX, 1977, pp. 125–8. SI SILEAT I have just come across Elizabeth Fry’s [then Elizabeth Gurney] description of hearing a woman of the Quaker persuasion, Deborah Darby preach when she was staying at the house of her cousin Priscilla Gurney in Wales: Elizabeth was then about nineteen: I think my feelings that night, at Deborah Darby’s, were the most exalted I ever remember. I, in a manner, was one of the beginners of the Meeting; suddenly my mind felt clothed with light, as with a garment, and I felt silenced before God; I cried with the heavenly feeling of humility and repentance. Then when I was in this awful state, there were two sermons preached ... But that silence, which first took possession of my mind exceeded all the rest.13 I am irresistably reminded of St Augustine’s last conversation with his mother at Ostia, a passage in the Confessions14 which is never far from my mind and not always or even usually in a religious context. The older I grow the more often I am convinced of the narrowness of the bases of knowledge of the world and the way what we are aware of gets in the way of what we are totally unaware of. I have a great yeaning for that ‘si silent omnino’. page 55 — Book XXI, 1979, pp. 11–12. Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="22">            ‘TOUT SAVOIR.’ ‘Tout savoir, c’est tout pardonner’ has been very much an attitude of mind in this generation and as a means of liberalising manners and getting rid of absurd prejudice it has something to be said for it. But on the debit side it has much nonsense to answer for. It has too often led to the view that if we know all the circumstances that lead to crime, cruelty or folly, those who commit acts of these kinds, have nothing to answer for. They are victims of the way things are or of their own unfortunate natures. It is a view that denies man respon- sibility and makes nonsense of his moral nature. The most deliberate and calculating acts of wickedness, cruelty, dishonesty and neglect dissolve in this bath of social and psychological explanation. They cannot be blamed or indeed punished. — Book XXI, 1980, p. 120. DARWIN AND MILTON I learn from the editor of Darwin’s Journals of the Voyage of the Beagle that the only works of literature which accompanied him on the whole voyage were the Old Testament and Milton’s poems.15 The mind reels at the thought of the one attempt to justify the ways of God to man, as the constant companion of the man who was really responsible for turning Milton’s system out of doors. I am even more surprised to learn that Darwin began the voyage in the firm belief in ‘special creation’ and the intention of becoming a country parson of the Church of England. No doubt it was the devil who put all those Galapagos finches in his path. It is to be seen as the Second Fall of Man. — 25–3–1981 — Book XXI, 1981, p. 189. page 56 Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="23">      POLITICS AND LOGOS The Right is often wrong but it has a true function; The Left is sometimes right but with odious unction That the Right is on the way out, the Left is here to stay, Unaware that it will be the Right of a later day We need both their visions and their gift for the absurd To keep our insight active and to activate the Word. — Book XXII, 1981, p. 46. page 57 Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="24">                    Notes 1 Hope, Book X, 1968, pp. 19–20. 2 Hope’s philosophical view throughout his notebooks and his poetry coincides with Nietzschean perspectivism which is one that sees all theories as interpretations, that knowledge is provisional in a state of continual becoming and which denies the notion of absolute truth. 3 This quotation is from Purgatorio, Canto XVIII, II. 19ff., in which Dante’s  typically medieval doctrine of love and the three stages by which it passes into action is given expression (II. 22–4, 28–33). See John Ciardo, who translates the segment as follows: The soul, being created prone to love is drawn at once to all that pleases it, as soon as pleasure summons it to move. From that which really is, your apprehension. 4 The place where the ancient well and spring of Hera once was is now occupied by a monastery,Agai Moni (Holy Monastery), which is situated north-west of the village of Diakofti, 30 kilometres from Kythera. It was built in 1840 and dedicated to Our Lord the Saviour.Tradition claims that the monastery’s holy icon was found in the bushes by a shepherd in 1759. It is said that Theodoros Kolokotronis prayed here for a successful outcome to the Greek Revolution.To thank the Lord, he helped renovate the monastery in 1822. 5 See Honderich (ed.), The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, p. 633, where McCord Adams’ definition of Ockham’s Razor is quoted as: ‘A methodological principle dictating a bias towards simplicity in theory construction, where the parameters of simplicity vary from kinds of entity to the number of presupposed axioms to characteristics of curves drawn between data points.’Although found in Aristotle, it became associated with William Ockham because it captures the spirit of his philosophical conclusions. 6 Jacques Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, a follower of Rousseau, wrote the novel Paul and Virginie in 1787; it was a poetic romance of virtuous love in which the heroine,Virginie, shows restraint in the manner descibed by Hope. Margaret Fuller (1810–51), a poet, editor, translator, literary critic and author of the classic feminist tract Women in the Nineteenth Century, describes in the latter the degrees to which women would go to ensure an invisibility as regards to their private bodily functions. 7 See Yeats, ‘Before the World was Made’, The Collected Poems, p. 308. 8 See Swift, Gulliver’s Travels, in which the expressions ‘Big Endians’ and ‘Little Endians’ were first coined. Swift’s ‘Big Endians’ were exiled from Mildendo, the metropolis, for refusing to break eggs at the smaller end (Part 1, Chapter 4, pp. 55–60).Today the term refers to any conflict over trivial differences adhered to with religious zeal. 9 See Hutchinson,Dictionary of Ideas, p. 161, in which John Eccles, born in 1903, is described as an Australian physiologist who shared with Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley the 1963 Nobel Prize for Medicine for work on conduction in page 58 the central nervous system. In some of his later works, he argued that the mind Dance of the Nomad has an existence independent of the brain. </page> <page sequence="25">              10 The Abdiel Appendix finds its source in Milton’s I, ‘The Argument’, Book V, when Abdiel, a Seraph, opposes those who wish to rebel against their God. Hope had plans to write a work titled ‘The Abdiel Appendix’. He writes about this project: ‘The Abdiel Appendix purports to be some notes on Earth and the human race written for his own amusement by an archangel charged with a survey of planets and their occupants in a section of the universe. I have sketched out this vast enterprise but written no part of it and shall not live long enough now.’ See Book IX, 1973, pp. 118–24. 11 See Wordsworth, ‘Intimations of Immortality from Reflections of Early Childhood’, Stanza I, lines 1 to 4, The Norton Anthology of Poetry, p. 551. 12 See Deighton, Billion Dollar Brain, p. 153. Hope’s favourite reading matter was detective stories and spy-thrillers, when not engaged in scholarly pursuits. 13 Elizabeth Fry (born Gurney), 1780–1845, was an English Quaker philanthropist. She formed an association for the improvement of conditions for female  prisoners in 1817 and worked with her brother Joseph Gurney (1788–1847) on a 1819 report on prison reform. 14 See St Augustine, Confessions, Chap. IX: 25, where he speaks with his mother as she is dying.Augustine refers to a silence that exists beyond the senses and intel- lect. He speaks of when his conversation with his mother ‘did gradually pass through all corporal things ... we soared higher yet by inward musing, and discoursing, and admiring Thy works; and we came to our own minds, and went beyond them ... We were saying, then, if to any man the tumult of the flesh were silenced — silenced the phantasies of earth, waters, and air — silenced, too, the poles; yea, the very soul be silenced to herself, and go beyond herself by not thinking of herself — silenced fancies and imaginary revelations, every tongue, and every sign, and whatsoever exists by passing away, since, if any could hearken ...’ Hope’s yearning for ‘si sileat omnino’ is for this kind of silence that exists beyond thought and sensual experience and which provides a space where the ‘unknow- able’ exists and, he implies, might be experienced. 15 See Moorehead,Darwin and the Beagle, p. 39, where he notes: ‘There was a round of farewells with Charles coaching up to London and Cambridge and back to Shrewsbury to make his final arrangements. Books he must have: Humboldt, Milton and the Bible, Lysell’s first volume of Principles of Geology (a parting gift from Henslow), just off the press ...’ page 59 Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="26">  </page> </plain_text>
