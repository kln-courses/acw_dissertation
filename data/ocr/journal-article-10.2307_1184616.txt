Navajo Reading Study. The Navajo Reading Study is a series of projects concerned with various aspects of Navajo Bilingual Education. The original study was started in 1969 to investigate the feasibility and affect of teaching Navajo children to read their own language. Language studies included a computer assisted analysis of the language of young Navajo children with related word counts, spelling lists and studies of Navajo Orthography. A revision of the Navajo Dictionary is under way. Sociolinguistic surveys of Navajo language maintenance were carried out in 1969 and 1970. Analytical bibliographies of Navajo reading material were developed. Production of Navajo reading materials began in 1971. Studies of the effect of Bilingual Education are being carried on. A Teacher Training Project subcontracted with the Sanostee Toadlena Title VII Navajo Bilingual Teacher Training Project began in 1973; eight students have so far completed Bachelors Degrees. Work on a bilingual curriculum began in 1973. A survey of American Indian Bilingual Education was carried out in 1973. A survey of American Indian Bilingual Education was carried out in 1973.

Cartographic Records in the National Archives of the United States Relating to American Indians, Reference Information Paper No. 71, compiled by Laura E. Kelsay (1974). The purpose of this paper is to give a brief account of the relationship of the Federal Government to the American Indians and to describe groups of car- tographic records in the National Archives of the United States pertaining to explorations in the Indian country and locations of Indian tribes-bands- villages, the settlement of Indians on reservations and their loss of land, and population, transportation, and industry on the reservations. When the War Department was established by Congress under an act of August 7, 1789, the duties assigned to it included those "relative to Indian Affairs." The Bureau of Indian Affairs was organized in the Department on March 11, 1824, and given responsibility for the nonmilitary aspects of Indian affairs. The Bureau passed from military to civil control when it was trans- ferred to the newly created Department of the Interior in 1849. Most of the early maps showing explorations in the Indian country and locations of Indian tribes, villages, and settlements in the United States are on file among the records of the Office of the Chief of Engineers, War Department, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior. Several of these maps and a few maps selected from the cartographic records of other Govern- ment agencies are described in detail in Appendix I (List Of Selected Maps Relating To Indians 1781-1883). Other maps relating to Indians may be found among textual records in the National Archives of the United States. List of Cartographic Records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Special List No. 13, compiled by Laura E. Kelsay (1954) is presently being revised. List of Record Groups of the National Archives and Records Service. Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Service, GSA, July, 1973. This list replaces a list of January, 1972. A list of record group titles arranged alphabetically by keyword appears as Part A (e.g., Indian Affairs, Bureau of/Indian Claims Commission). In Part B the titles are arranged by the National Archives and Records Service operating units having primary responsibility for archival controls over the record groups (e.g., Natural Resources Branch, NNFN). In Part C the titles are arranged by record group number (e.g., RG 75 [Bureau of Indian Affairs, NNFN] and RG 279 [Indian Claims Commission, NNFN]). Guide to the National Archives of the United States (third edition in press 1974). This will be the most comprehensive finding aid that describes in detail the records of the National Archives. Accessions and Openings: Regional Archives Branches (Federal Records Centers) The eleven Regional Archives Branches (Federal Archives and Records</page><page sequence="25">Bibliography, Research, and News 243 Centers) have accessioned computer-generated community profiles from the Office of Economic Opportunity. Derived from data supplied by both government and nongovernment sources, the community statistics describe geographic, social, and economic characteristics to each country and in- dependent city in the United States. Designed to provide basic information for governors, congressmen, mayors, and other public officials seeking solutions to community problems, much of the data come from 1960 sources; however, some of the profiles provide 1962, 1964, and 1965 data, as well as 1966 estimates. Regional Archives Branches are located in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta (East Point), Chicago, Kansas City, Fort Worth, Denver, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Seattle. The original print-outs are available at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. Accessions and Publications: Public Archives of Canada (Ottawa) As a result of the recent federal government policy to settle the outstanding claims of the Indian peoples of Canada and to promote research by Indian groups into the background of possible claims, the Public Archives of Canada has been authorized to undertake both the microfilming and the production of finding aids for the records of the Indian Affairs Branch. The program calls also for the preparation of detailed indexes to facilitate the needs of Indian claims research. The project is scheduled to last four years with a cost of nearly three quarters of a million dollars. Also affected are records still in the custody of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. The microfilming is intended to protect the original records from serious damage and possible destruction due to overhandling, as well as to make them easily available. The new publication program of the Public Records Division, in- volving the preparation of inventories for publication, has already completed Indian Affairs (Record Group 10). Accessions and Openings: State, Municipal, and University At the University of Kansas, the C.J. Moore collection of photographs from Northeastern Kansas and the Indian Territory (1893-1915) has been in- ventoried and indexed. The Floyd Schultz photograph collection of Plains Indians is in preparation. MUSEUMS AND HISTORICAL SOCIETIES Pre-Columbian Art of Mexico and Central America (The Bowers Museum, Santa Ana, California) Introduction No event within human history has been so fully documented as the Spanish discovery and conquest of the New World, yet never have the total cultures of an entire continent been overthrown and obliterated in such a brief period of time. The Spanish invasion brought about a total and permanent destruction to the cultures of Mexico in less than fifty years.</page><page sequence="26">244 American Indian Quarterly Who were the people of Prehispanic America? Refugees from Atlantis or Lemuria? Phoenicians piloting the children of Israel? Chinese? Egyptians? Or none of these? And how did they get here-when there was a bridge of land between Asia and America at what is now Bering Strait? Via Malaysia or Polynesia? Early crossings of the Atlantic? Surely occasional visitors must have come. The winds and currents of the North Pacific tend eastward. Any craft caught helpless in their embrace can easily be carried across the ocean. Records show, for example, that between 1775 and 1885 about 20 Japanese junks were blown to the West Coast of America. If Japanese junks in the last century, why not Chinese or Indian or Malaysian ones in preceding centuries? No question about it, a certain number must have ended a storm-tossed journey on this side of the Pacific. Perhaps a few risked the long sail back home, but most must have chosen to settle down where they landed. Eventually they either died out or were wholly absorbed, leaving behind only tantalizing hints of their presence. This exhibition points out striking transpacific stylistic parallels in ar- chitecture, art forms and technology-but the dates just cannot be made to coincide. Some resemblances are off by as much as 2,200 years. It is important to point out that the style and expression of Mesoamerica is uniquely its own and probably was influenced more by social attitudes than the art they produced. An archaeological autopsy shows that Mesoamerican history consisted of native wars that formed and changed the development of civilizations as well as art forms. Buildings at Tula, the Toltec capital, were torn down centuries earlier; Teotihuacain, greatest of all Mexican cities, was destroyed and abandoned almost 900 years before the Spanish conquest. But never in Prehispanic conflicts was there such destruction that caused the elimination of the native arts altogether with the symbolism they expressed. In Europe, the arts of the New World brought about praise from Albrecht Durer, Benvenuto Cellini, Matthias Grunewald and other great masters in the arts. But in years to come it was treated as outlandish in some private collections, and still later in museums whose interests were narrowly confined to ethnology and anthropology. Even today, art museums undertreat its importance. Much of the material in this exhibition [380 artifacts] has never before been published and represents examples of the works of every major culture from Northern Mexico to southern Panama. This exhibit is a deliberate effort to present less well-known masterpieces and regions which have not previously been treated in depth. However, it must be understood that any exhibition devoted to the art of ancient Mexico must be limited in both its breadth and its depth. Recent dating by radioactive isotopes indicates that man may have been on this continent as early as 48,000 B.C. and the first evidence of art forms were produced perhaps as early as 9,000 B.C. Many of these objects survive today because the ancient peoples of Mexico buried their art forms with the dead. Selecting, as we have, more than 300 examples of this means that we have assembled a fairly strong cross section of objects of the pre- Columbian art of Mexico, Panama and Costa Rica. Inspite of the limitations in scope and depth, the exhibition does outline the historic development of an- cient Mexico through almost 3,000 years. [Reilly P. Rhodes, Director] Prehispanic Contacts Between The Old And The New World</page><page sequence="27">Bibliography, Research, and News 245 Inquiries into the origin of the Indians in the New World began soon after the discovery by Columbus. In the early 17th century, the astronomer Edward Brerewood (1565?-1613) expressed the belief that the Indians descended from the Tartars because they had nothing in common with European culture and their skin color precluded their African origin, and since they were unfamiliar with the arts and skills of the Chinese and the peoples of India, their original homeland must have been that part of northeastern Asia which is close to America and which was then inhabited by the Tartars. Various other theories were presented during the 18th century, all of them based on general com- parisons of cultural traits. The first specific analogies were pointed out by Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859). He attributed the amazing similarity between the Prehispanic calendar systems of Mexico and those of East Asia to a common Old World origin. During the last two decades, Robert Heine-Geldern and Gordon F. Ekholm made substantial contributions which stimulated renewed interest in the problem. As a result, an impressive list of similar trait occurrences can be compiled, ranging from early evidence of plant domestication, the appearance of pottery and figurines, the use of jade and turquoise to the "great art styles" in monumental architecture, sculpture, and pottery, which provide a con- siderable share of transpacific evidence. Due consideration has been given to their historical contexts in terms of time, place, and the means of transport. According to documentary sources, the Chinese used large seagoing vessels for trade and military expeditions by 500 B.C., if not earlier. Thereby, the nautical presuppositions for transpacific voyages from East Asia existed at the time of the Formative cultures of Mexico which laid the foundations for the development of the Classic civilizations. However, the advocates of transpacific diffusion are not unopposed. The critics do not negate that there had been contacts across the Pacific but they question, as Philip Phillips pointed out, whether such contacts could have been determinant at critical moments in the development of American cultures. To be sure, there never were mass migrations involving military conquests from Asia (after the initial settling of the continent via the Bering Strait); voyages were sporadic and in small numbers. Let us consider a few select analogies of trait complexes--not of isolated elements-which strongly indicate continued southeastern Asiatic influence in Mexico. Architecture. Comparisons of the Mesoamerican stepped pyramid which has a central stairway leading to a temple platform, with similar structures in Angkor Wat, has led several authors to assume that the Mexican structures were derived from Cambodia. Since the stepped pyramid appears in Southeast Asia as late as the 9th century A.D. but considerably earlier in Mexico, it would seem, as Heine-Geldern noted, that the influence has been reversed. It is quite possible, theoretically, that Cambodians had visited America and taken the concept back to Cambodia. More significant is the comparison between wall panels decorated with rows of colonettes which appear in Puuc - style architecture (Kabah, Zayil, etc.) and similar window gratings in Khmer temples. The colonettes appear in the 9th century during the Angkor period as imitation of earlier wooden ones. In fact, a wooden colonette, like those of stone, was excavated in Angkor. Whereas the colonettes in Yucatan were</page><page sequence="28">246 American Indian Quarterly merely wall decorations, those of Cambodia had a real function; they were placed as grating within the frame of a false window. It is known furthermore, that the Cambodian stone colonettes were turned on a lathe, otherwise their perfect shape could not have been achieved. The Puuc-style colonettes are simpler--the lathe was not known in America-but it still can be recognized that they must have been derived from the lathe-turned prototype. In Heine- Geldern's view, this comparison probably constitutes the most decisive proof of the Old World origin of a Mayan architectural motif. Wheeled figurines. Terra cotta figures of animals, with perforations in the legs for the insertion of a wooden axle to which were attached clay wheels, have been reported from the Valley of Mexico, the Gulf Coast (163* [Jaguar Figure On Wheels, San Marcos Moldmade, Veracruz, A.D. 750-900]), Guerrero, Michoacan, and from Jaina and Mayapan in the Maya area. They are attributed to the Classic and Early Post-classic periods. Some of these are too elaborate and too well preserved to be considered toys; their function must have been ritualistic. These artifacts indicate that the principle of the wheel was known in America but it had never been put to practical use because there were no draft animals to pull carts. Clay spindle whorls, cylindrical clay stamps with an axle hole (1 [Roller Stamp, Tlatilco, Middle Preclassic, Mr. and Mrs. Myer Bello]), and the large stone rollers which the Maya used in flat- tening the causeways that connected some of their major ceremonial centers are, in a sense, related to the wheel but not to its use in transport. Old World occurrences of figures on wheels are abundant and range widely in time and space. The earliest specimen has a hinge on its throat so that it could be pulled with a string. It was discovered in the Royal Cemetery at Ur, Mesopotamia (ca. 2800-2550 B.C.). Other wheeled figures have been found in Iraq (aram, ca. 2500-2400 B.C.), in the Indus Valley (carts, 2400 B.C.), in Iran (animal of bronze from Marlik, 1200-1000 B.C.), in Egypt (ape driving a horse and chariot on a painted limestone slab, New Kingdom, 1250 B.C.), in Cyprus (horse-drawn chariot, 600-525 B.C.), in Greece (charioteer on horse, 725 B.C.), in the Roman empire (clay statuette of Victory driving a chariot drawn by two horses, close of the 4th cent. B.C. and others from the 1st-5th cent. A.D.), and China (cart, Han period, 206 B.C.). In view of their wide distribution, it appears that the wheeled effigy originated in Mesopotamia and spread in the 3d millennium B.C. to India and then to other places. Its local independent invention in many different surroundings, dating from different periods, is most unlikely. The correspondences suggest that the principle of the figure on wheels was in- troduced into Mexico from India via China. Figurines with articulated limbs. Clay figures with jointed limbs also have an interesting history. One type in Mesoamerica is distinguished by hinges in the arms for insertion of the string and occurs in Kaminaljuyui, Guatemala, and at Tazumal, El Salvador, at a much earlier date (1500-1000 B.C.) than another type from central Mexico (states of Veracruz, Hidalgo, Mexico, Tlaxcala and Puebla, A.D. 300-900) which lacks the hinges. It is not known why the first type was discontinued. The great time gap would seem to argue for a completely independent invention of each type. But articulated figures occur also elsewhere in the New World and at different time levels: in Costa Rica (jade figure, also pottery vessels with movable heads, A.D. 400-1200, in * Reference numbers indicate exhibition (catalogue) number of artifacts.</page><page sequence="29">Bibliography, Research, and News 247 Ecuador (Manabi, in the very broadly defined time range between 500 B.C. and A.D. 500), in Panama, in Peru (only the arms are jointed, Ancon, 1200 B.C., and a silver doll with hinged arms, Chimu, A.D. 1100-1400). Occurrences in Costa Rica, Ecuador and Peru can be attributed to Mesoamerican in- fluences. There is ample evidence of cultural interchange by the sea route between Mexico and Ecuador which began in the Preclassic period and con- tinued intermittently to the 16th century A.D. Early Old World occurrences are known from the Indus Valley (2700 B.C.) and Egypt (wooden fugure with movable legs, 2200-2000 B.C.; with movable jaw, 1000 B.C. and 1250 B.C.; ivory figure, 100 B.C.). This overview suggests that the idea of making figures with movable parts originated in Egypt at the beginning of the 3d millennium B.C. and re-occurred in Greece from the 9th to the 7th century B.C., where they were not uncommon in the 5th century B.C., although far less abundant than ordinary figures. A religious function can be attributed to the Mexican figures because of the position of the hands. A religious connotation for the bell-shaped early Greek figures (9th-8th cent. B.C.) appears certain. Furthermore, there is a definite correlation between occurrences of wheeled figures and jointed figures in Mesoamerica, and probably elsewhere. The method of joining limbs or head to the body by means of strings represents a sophisticated mechanical principle. The question when and how it spread from the Mediterranean area to the New World and the hiatus of over thirteen centuries that separated the Guatemalan/El Salvador from the Mexican figures can at present not be answered. House models. Ceramic house models are known from the Ixtlan del Rio region in southwestern Nayarit. They represent huts or houses made of sun- dried bricks, wood and thatch and five different architectural types can be distinguished. Each model contains at least two, often more, handmodeled figurines, about 1 V2 -3 /4 in. high, of men, women, children, and even dogs and parrots. The inhabitants are engaged in various activities of daily life: they stand, sit, climb, lie down and sleep; they gaze in various directions, play musical instruments (drums, rattles, flutes), carry weapons and various ob- jects (215 [ Two-Storied House Model With 6 Occupants And A Dog, Nayarit, Bowers Museum Foundation]) or just sit in a contemplative mood, sometimes in front of dishes of food. It is strange that the occurrence of animated house models in Mesoamerica is restricted to the Shaft Tomb Complex of Nayarit (ca. 200 B.C:-A.D. 500). Somewhat similar clay models are known from Ecuador. Remarkable are the parallels with funerary house models from China (Late Chou period 700-221 B.C.; Han period 206 B.C.-A.D. 220). It can be concluded that the concepts of modeling houses with occupants for funerary purposes had been introduced from southern China. The diffusion of great religious systems. The study of Asiatic roots for certain New World religious institutions has been given serious consideration by Paul Kirchhoff, David H. Kelley, and Thomas S. Barthel, among others. Kirchhoff demonstrated that a calendaric classification of 28 Hindu gods and their animals into 12 groups reveals sequences representing Creation, Destruction, and Renovation, which existed both in India and Java and which must have been carried from the Old World to the New, since in Mexico we find calendaric lists of gods and animals (or their substitutes) that follow each other without interruption in the same order and with attributes and functions or</page><page sequence="30">248 American Indian Quarterly meaning strikingly similar to those of the 12 Indian and Javanese groups of gods. Recently, Barthel published a systematic analysis of the iconographic structure of Codex Laud, a 14th (?) century Prehispanic pictorial screenfold manuscript. He finds overwhelming substantial evidence of Asiatic prototypes, in some cases perfectly matching concordances, in other cases adaptations to the Mesoamerican tradition. Some sections of the codex (which is preserved in England) are based on Hinduistic astronomical concepts, others suggest a mixture of Chinese religious concepts, whereas still others reveal an Indonesian base. These findings are indeed fascinating. They constitute a different approach from that of comparisons of art motifs and cultural traits, all of which lead towards a better understanding of Old World influences in America. [Hasso von Winning, Guest Curator] Pre-Columbian Art of Mexico The Olmec Civilization With the discovery, in 1862, of a colossal stone head in the southern part of Veracruz-now known an Monument "A" of Tres Zapotes-and later on of similar heads, weighing approximately 18 tons, and of carved monuments up to 50 tons, the originators of these masterpieces and their place in the cultural time sequence became the subject of much debate. Only recently the enigma shrouding the Olmecs has been clarified and it is now established, by radio- carbon dating, that a florescence of this first civilization of Mesoamerica oc- curred between 1200-900 B.C. at San Lorenzo in southern Veracruz, with a second florescence at La Venta (Tabasco) between 800-400 B.C. But Olmec stone carving was not confined to monumentality. Lapidaries produced countless smaller objects of jade and other hard stones with superb artistry. Procurement of the necessary raw materials-jade, magnetite, ilmenite, hematite, flint, bitumen, mica, schist, and obsidian-not available in the Tabasco-Veracruz core area, impelled Olmec merchants to seek them at their source. The finished artifacts were exported over trade routes leading from the Gulf Coast through Puebla (Las Bocas) to the Valley of Mexico (Tlatilco, Tlapacoya) and then through Morelos (Gualupita, Santa Cruz, Chalcatzingo) to the Balsas River. The places listed in parentheses are all famous for their Olmec remains. They were Olmec dominated settlements, some of them fortified, and situated at strategic points along the trade routes. Olmec pottery with symbolic designs and extraordinarily well-made terra cotta figurines likewise were manufactured at these "colonial" sites where they occur in graves at Tlatilco, Tlapacoya and Las Bocas. The latter site is known particularly for its oversize hollow figures with infantile obese features, and unusual pottery forms. One cannot but marvel at the imagination and dex- terity with which Olmec artisans accomplished their masterpieces, which rival those of the coeval Chou and Han Periods of China. The Gulf Coast Our display comprises pottery objects from the Huastec culture of southern Tamaulipas and from the lowlands of south-central Veracruz. Figures from the latter region are quite large and have a glossy black paint, believed to have been made of resin, that emphasizes certain features (eyes, teeth, ornaments). Very appealing are the figures with broad heads and a</page><page sequence="31">Bibliography, Research, and News 249 smiling countenance which ranges from a blissful expression to an idiotic grin. They are exceptional because happiness is rarely displayed in the figurative art of Mesoamerica. The peoples of central Veracruz whom Hernan Cortes encountered in 1519, and their surviving descendants, are the Totonac, a term that has been loosely applied also to antiquities from the area. To avoid confusion with earlier art styles, the term Classic Central Veracruz is preferred. It designates stone carvings which are characterized by a decorative pattern of entwined scroll work and certain functional forms known as yokes, palmas (or palmate stones) and hachas (axes) which were associated with the ceremonial ball game. Yokes are shaped like a horseshoe and were made of hard polished stone. Palmas are mostly fan-shaped at the top (hence the name) and have a concave base. They were carved of volcanic stone in a variety of sizes and shapes and decorated in relief with plant or animal motifs. Hachas are flattened heads, sometimes with a tenon in back, and they are reminiscent in shape of votive axes. Yokes and hachas originated in the Early Classic period and were traded, during the Late Classic period, throughout neighboring areas, the Valley of Mexico and as far as the Pacific slope of Guatemala and El Salvador. Palmas apparently originated later than yokes and are confined to Veracruz. The Central Mexican Highlands Teotihuacan. A long development from simple village life to urbanization culminated in the Basin of Mexico with the rise of Teotihuacan which became the dominant political and religious center for over 500 years, and again with the hegemony of the Aztecs during the century prior to the Spanish conquest (1519-1521). Even today, almost 13 centuries after its decline, Teotihuacan presents a formidable aspect with its two enormous pyramids, temples, palaces, and multiple dwellings. Impressive, too, is the planned layout of this large metropolis with its Ceremonial Precinct and grid-like streets which, by A.D. 500 had a population estimated between 70,000 and 125,000, perhaps even exceeding 200,000. Teotihuacan sculpture has a flavor of its own, evident in the stone incense burners bearing the image of Huehueteotl, the Old Fire God. The ceremonial pottery also has distinctive features. Of interest are the cylindrical tripod vessels decorated in flat relief or coated with a thin layer of lime plaster after the vessel had been fired and painted (al fresco) with symbolic designs. Teotihuacan was the focal point of far reaching trade that stimulated the exchange of goods with, and the spread of religious concepts to, other centers that flourished simultaneously such as Monte Alban (Oaxaca) and sites in the Guatemalan Highlands (Lake Amatitlan) and Lowlands (Tikal). Teotihuacan influence extended also to Central Veracruz, into West Mexico (Colima), and to the coast of Guerrero (Acapulco). The decline of Teotihuacan, indicated by the cessation of all building activity and the virtual end of the functions of the Ceremonial Precinct (Pyramid of the Sun and Moon and buildings along the Avenue of the Dead, ended with the final collapse and abandonment of the peripheral city in A.D. 650 (or A.D. 750 according to recent estimates). The Aztecs. Following a period of turmoil and the flow and ebb of a power struggle among various regional entities who were eager to fill the political vacuum left by Teotihuacan, the Mexica (Aztecs) forged a state in the early</page><page sequence="32">250 American Indian Quarterly 14th century that controlled in the 15th and early 16th century much of the Central Highlands and constantly expanded its domain far beyond the capital city of Tenochtitlan. The religious fervor of the Aztecs created a sculptural style which embodied the legacies of their predecessors, the Toltecs. Portrayed are the ancient deities such as the wind god Ehecatl, an aspect of Quetzalcoatl, the rain god Tlaloc, and a host of agricultural fertility gods. A large number of monumental sculptures of outstanding quality have been discovered in Mexico City. Some of them were salvaged, along with all kinds of artifacts and pottery, during the construction of the underground railway (Metro) in the late 1960s. The Chupicuaro Style Pottery and figurines marked Chupicuaro display unique characteristics which distinguish them from all other styles and make them easily recognizable. The pottery is heavy, thick-walled and very durable. Designs are entirely geometric, incised or painted, and the same motifs recur in various combinations. All the figures are hand-modeled. The smaller ones have the features and ornamentation executed by application of clay fillets. Attention was given to the modeling and decorating of the head, as was generally the custom in Mesoamerica. Bodies are small and simple in proportion to the head. The Chupicuaro complex extends over a large area of southern Guanajuato. Excavations at the village of Chupicuaro Viejo were conducted in the 1940s before the construction of the Solis Dam on the Rio Lerma inundated the site. Materials from some 400 graves in cemeteries surrounding the village are recorded in three monographs. The culture flourished during the first four centuries B.C. according to radiocarbon dates from comparable sites in ad- jacent regions. West Mexico Following an established procedure, the figures and pottery vessels of western Mexico are labeled "Colima," "Jalisco" or "Nayarit" in order to designate in one word their geographical origin, the art style and, implicitly, their range in the Mesoamerican chronological sequence. These states and adjacent parts of Michoacan form a large archaeological province which in Prehispanic times was distinguished by a certain degree of cultural homogeneity and set apart from the other areas of the Mesoamerican co- tradition, namely the Central Highlands, Oaxaca, the Gulf Coast, the Maya area and the semi-arid regions of northwestern Mexico. A unique feature, unparalleled in other Mesoamerican areas, are the shaft tomb cemeteries which occur in a great arc extending from south-central Nayarit through central Jalisco to Colima. Shaft tombs consist of a vertical entrance shaft up to 25 feet deep. At the bottom are one or two vaulted chambers with a stone slab covering the entrance so that the rubble and dirt with which the shaft had been filled after the burial had taken place, would not penetrate into the chamber. The human remains are usually found in the center surrounded by a number of large hollow figures of men, women or animals. Depending on their provenience, these tomb figures reveal characteristic forms, attributes, and surface finish so that three major art styles can be distinguished. Briefly, the art style of Colima can be recognized by a highly polished surface, restrained use of color and a sturdy appearance. The human figures have an impassive expression, torsos are bulky and featureless, dress and ornaments are indicated in relief. They are readily differentiated from the</page><page sequence="33">Bibliography, Research, and News 251 figures in the style of Jalisco and Nayarit. Jalisco figures have elongated faces with a flat and pointed chin thrust foreward. Eyes are wide open and have thick lids; fingernails and toenails are carefully modeled. There is usually a venthole in the ear to prevent the figure from bursting in the kiln. Figures from other style areas have a spoutlike opening. Nayarit figures have thin eyelids but thick prominent noses. Colors are applied generously, especially to simulate embroidered textiles. They are fragile and the ornaments protrude far beyond the body. In the southern part of Nayarit occurs a sub-style termed "Chinesca" because the figures have an exotic, vaguely oriental, appearance. Those on display are painted red or black on a white glossy surface; they have broad foreheads, puffy slit eyes and their arms are fused to the body. Hands and feet are omitted. Ornaments are painted instead of being attached with fillets. Whereas the shaft tomb figures of Colima, Jalisco and Nayarit occur in a time span from 200 B.C. to A.D. 500, the Chinescas appear early in the sequence but their duration is not known. A sub-style called "Zacatecas" originated in northeastern Jalisco, close to the border with Zacatecas, and has recently been dated A.D. 200. The figures have a startled look and show relatively few variations suggesting that they were made only during a short time span of some 50-100 years. The great aesthetic appeal of the shaft tomb figures lies in their portrayal of human beings in various attitudes and activities. Also animals, particularly dogs, turtles, serpents, etc. occur and they are modeled with much naturalism. All these figures were destined to accompany the dead and, although they are formal components of a widespread mortuary cult, they nevertheless look very much alive. The Mezcala Style The term Mezcala was first applied by the famous Mexican painter Miguel Covarrubias to a type of stone figures from a relatively inaccessible mountain region in Guerrero. The style is characterized by simplicity of design with straight cuts and planes and a tendency toward abstract forms. Some of the human figures include stylistic traits of Teotihuacan, thereby implying a chronological link but, on the whole, the duration of the Mezcala style is still unknown. The Zapotec and Mixtec of Oaxaca The famous hilltop site on Monte Alban, in the Valley of Oaxaca, with its temple pyramids, ball courts, and masonry tombs was occupied without in- terruption for more than two millennia. The graves of the Classic period, built by the Zapotec, contain peculiar terra cotta figures with a cylindrical vase in back (which were almost invariably found to be empty) known as urns. They represent frequently the rain god Cocijo, a pan-Mesoamerican deity known as Tlaloc in the Valley of Mexico, or Chac among the Maya, which was of greatest importance for a people that depended on maize agriculture for their sustenance. In the Postclassic period Monte Alban was occupied by the Mixtec whose domain extended into southern Puebla. They were highly skilled craftsmen which is evident in their precious stone carvings and mosaic inlaid wood ob- jects. Their artistic and intellectual influence spread over a large part of central and western Mexico.</page><page sequence="34">252 American Indian Quarterly The Maya Maya civilization flourished with several great coeval cultures--Teotihua- can, Monte Alban, El Tajin in Veracruz-and each reacted on the other, yet each had a distinctive art style. Commensurate with their high level of in- tellectual and artistic achievements the Maya excelled in the manufacture of painted and carved pottery. The decorations consist of sumptuously dressed dignitaries or of animals, always shown in profile, and frequently accompanied by hieroglyphic texts, the meaning of which is now slowly and laboriously being deciphered. Many of the scenes depicted relate overtly to the voyage of the deceased to the Underworld. Some individuals are painted black, a color related to war and death. Modeled pottery, mostly used for incense burning, also shows great vitality in the treatment of the face that contrasts with the stylized rendering of the body and ornaments. During the Late Classic period a tradition of modeling terra cotta figurines reached its apogee on the coast of Campeche where hundreds of superb statuettes were found in the cemeteries of Jaina and Uaymil. Particularly skillful is the treatment of the face; ornaments and garments are usually very elaborate. Frequently a whistling device was in- conspicuously incorporated, or the hollow figure contains pebbles that produce a rattling sound when shaken. Other examples of the heights reached by the Maya in the plastic arts are the almost life-size stucco heads from Palenque, an important ceremonial center in the state of Chiapas. Commerce in pottery was brisk throughout the Maya area and beyond. A highly prized ware, called plumbate because of its metallic luster, was manufactured in only one place near the border of Guatemala and southern Chiapas (Soconusco region) and traded over great distances. Later forms of this pottery depict Mexican, that is non-Maya gods, suggesting that the makers were not of Maya speech. Plumbate ware became extremely popular and valued, so much so that it was imitated in Veracruz for those who could not afford the genuine product. Jade carving in the form of plaques and ornaments likewise reached a high degree of perfection; jade artifacts were among the most treasured luxury items throughout the prehistory of Precolumbian Mesoamerica. Central America Pottery and artifacts from El Salvador and Honduras show Mayoid characteristics and are therefore included in the Maya section. The area to the south of El Salvador and Honduras served as a corridor between the two American continents and from the Middle Preclassic period on cultural in- filtration from the north resulted in an increasingly complex and lasting relationship of Lower Central America with Mesoamerica. Preceding the fall of Teotihuacan, Nahuat peoples, known by their Aztec name Pipiles ("princes" or "children"), moved via the Gulf Coast into Central America bringing with them their cultural heritage. By A.D. 900 Upper Central America and much of the lower portion had acquired a noticeable veneer of Mexican culture centered on religious concepts. On the other hand, the Nahuat became acquainted with concepts of South American origin that had been brought to Panama and Costa Rica from the Amazon basin. Among them is the crested alligator, a water and fertility deity. Also derived from South America is the trophy head cult which is manifest in stone figures holding a severed head, in offering tables and large grinding stones with</page><page sequence="35">Bibliography, Research, and News 253 "flying panels" representing animals carved beneath the slab. [Hasso von Winning, Guest Curator] Conch Shell Trumpets in Mesoamerica Trumpets or conch shells of various species were distributed widely in Prehispanic Mesoamerica. They functioned in the belief systems and sacred activities of such societies as Teotihuacan, Tenochtitlan (the Aztec capital), Veracruz, and the Early Classic cultures of West Mexico such as those of Nayarit and Jalisco. Trumpet shells or conches were sometimes modified to function as trumpets. They are also referred to as valved aerophones. As musical instruments they played a part in shamanistic activities as well as in the more colorful ceremonies of complex social systems such as that of the Aztecs. The conch shell trumpet (294 [Conch Shell Trumpet With Incised Design And Residues Of Green Lime Plaster (Stucco), Vicinity of Zuruamato (now Pastor Ortiz), Municipality of Puruandiro, Northern Michoacan, Post Classic, A.D. 900-1200(?) Bowers Museum]) to be described is part of an assortment of artifacts which were found near the Rio Lerma. According to the discoverer, it was found while excavating for a school house foundation in 1966. Zuruamato falls within or on the northern boundary of the Tarascan linguistic area. According to the discoverer, Indians no longer live there. However, he affirmed that the word Zuruamato means tump-line or carrying net and believed the word was Tarasco in origin. The trumpet bears an incised design, composed of an anthropomorphic figure enclosed by a rectangular panel; the panel is made up of an interlocking design which appears in Mixtec place signs. The apex of the spiral had been removed presumably to provide a mouthpiece and to modify the shell into a musical wind instrument; a single perforation near the lip functioned as a means of attachment or suspension. Various ceramic figurines from West Mexico are shown wearing suspended or attached conches on the lower torsos. The specimen, Fasciolaria princeps/gigantea, belongs to one of the species of trumpet shells occurring in West Mexican archaeological sites. The species lives in the Atlantic and Pacific, and like other trumpet shells was widely distributed in Prehispanic Mesoamerica. Shell trumpets and conch shells have appeared in diverse archaeological contexts such as Teotihuacan, Kaminaljuyui, West Mexico, the shaft tombs of Etzatlan, Jalisco, and the Spiro mound in Oklahoma. Like the specimen, one Spiro mound specimen bears an incised design; another incised example is in the museum in Morelia, Michoacan. Peter Furst retrieved over a hundred trumpet shells from looted shaft tombs in southwestern Nayarit (1966). There is, therefore, generous comparative data from widely separated areas and periods against which to compare our specimen. Since there is no radioisotope date for the shell, its age must be determined by comparisons with analogous dated phenomena from other sites. Shell trumpets found in shaft tombs in southwestern Nayarit fall in the range ex- tending from the last century B.C. to the third century A.D. and their design elements show affinities to Teotihuacan. However, the use of trumpet shells continued after this time. (In fact the ritual use of shells persists among the Huichol Indians of West Mexico.) A trace of greenish-blue or turquoise-colored stucco on the shell is evidence that the specimen was stuccoed, a technique</page><page sequence="36">254 American Indian Quarterly which flourished in Teotihuacan and other areas of Mesoamerica during the Classic Period (300 A.D.-900 A.D.) and later. According to Hasso von Win- ning the style of design falls within the Early Post Classic Period (900-1200 A.D.); the age of the artifact probably falls within this period. The function of shell trumpets in Prehispanic societies was ritual; like so many objects, there is evidence they played a role in shamanistic behavior. Shamans were powerful persons with supernatural abilities whose role it was to safeguard the structure of society from malevolent forces. Peter Furst has argued that the figurines in West Mexican shaft tombs represent shamans. Trumpet shells, which appear on some of these figurines and occur among the skeletons, were in all likelihood part of the shaman's paraphernalia. These shell artifacts were deposited with the dead, functioning like many other categories of mortuary goods. Other kinds of burial sites in West Mexico have yielded valved aerophones such as one from Michoacan described by Isabel Kelly, in which a conch shell strewn with slate disc beads reposed on the chest of a skeleton. If these were shamanistic objects, then it follows they were installed in shamans' burials. There is evidence that another function was the use of such objects in warfare. And "anecdotal" ceramic from West Mexico shows an individual standing at the top of a rise with a trumpet shell in hand while warriors stand on the slopes. The individual at the top could well be a shaman, utilizing sacred power in the efforts of communal defense. In many societies shamans may well have functioned as war leaders because of their possession of spiritual power and authority in the social structure. Moreover, traditional societies view strangers, especially quarrelsome strangers, as threats in the physical and spiritual sense. Hence war in these societies is conceived of as a struggle against malevolent spiritual as well as physical forces requiring the assistance of a shaman or group of shamans to repel them. Aside from their association with shamans and priests, conch trumpets were used as adjuncts in mortuary ritual as among the Tarascans. In the Relacion de Michoacan, two attendants are shown blowing conch trumpets during a funeral procession honoring a dignitary. This is especially significant since the trumpet most likely falls in the indigenous Tarascan culture area. Trumpet shells functioned as symbols of Quetzalcoatl, a wind deity honored as early as the Classic Period at Teotihuacan and throughout the Post Classic until the Spanish Conquest. In the Florentine Codex (Book II, 1951), Quet- zalcoatl is depicted with sacred paraphernalia, among which is the wind shell symbol, a transversely bisected conch shell. He also wears turquoise ear pendants; a trace of turquoise stucco appears on the trumpet from Michoacan. Moreover, the wind shell symbol or conch may be one of the appurtenances of priesthood. Quetzalcoatl was the patron of learning and wisdom, a kind of priest deity, or patron of priests. As society evolved and became more com- plex, the conch shell which was a sacred symbol used by shamans, became a symbol of the priests. Furthermore, shell trumpets were used in some of the mass ceremonials in urban contexts such as Tenochtitlan and may have been sounded by minor religious officials or attendants in the priestly hierarchy. Evidence drawn from archaeological research and historical sources strongly suggests a ritual function for this trumpet, either shamanistic or as part of a priestly paraphernalia or as a sacred adjunct during rites of passage such as mortuary ritual. In any case the design must be functionally associated with the use and meaning of the trumpet. The figure on the shell may represent a</page><page sequence="37">Bibliography, Research, and News 255 deity or an earthly intermediary such as a priest. Further research on the symbolisms of Mesoamerican and Tarascan culture history and ethnography may reveal that the design is a composite of symbols representing a variant of Quetzalcoatl, or another Mesoamerican deity, such as a member of the Tarascan pantheon or a priest. [Charles N. Irwin, Curator of Anthropology] Appendix Iconographic Analysis The decoration of the shell trumpet consists of a human male figure, shown frontally, with arms and legs spread sideways. It is framed by a rectangular panel decorated with tau elements, reminiscent of shell mosaic work from West Mexico. The figure and the frame were executed by shallow, somewhat irregular incising. Straight and angular lines predominate. The head is proportionately much larger than the body and also more elaborate. The configuration shows great similarities with incised designs on polished brown ware of the Shaft Tomb Complex of Colima. The following parallels are noted: 1. Use of broad panel frames. 2. The person is shown en face, not in profile. 3. Punctate filler elements in the headdress. 4. Triangular rendering of the body. 5. Treatment of the limbs in angular, spread-eagle, fashion. 6. Simplicity of design, with emphasis on essential details. The two circles indicate the ear discs. The loincloth is shown by a simple knot. The lack of priestly paraphernalia and the absence of attributes that would identify the person as a deity of the Mesoamerican pantheon do not contribute towards clarification of the role of the human figure. There are residues of green stucco which suggests that at some later time the original incised design was entirely covered by a paint-over-stucco design. It is therefore assumed that the shell was first decorated in Colima and later traded to northern Michoacan, probably during the Early Postclassic period when Mixtec influence dominated the art of western Mexico, where it was re- decorated with al-fresco paint to serve as a tomb offering. [Hasso von Win- ning, Guest Curator] Bone Artifacts From Nayarit The four bone awls or spatulas (120 A-B-C-D [4 Carved Bone Awls With Elaborate Decoration, Reportedly from a shaft tomb near Ixtlain del Rio, Nayarit, Early Postclassic (Mixtec?), Bowers Museum Foundation]) were found in one of the areas where shaft tombs occur. They were retrieved from a burial with other artifacts such as a perforated bone awl and ceramics, which purportedly included some in the "Chinesca" or "Chinesco" style. This ceramic style coexisted in time with the shaft tombs of southwestern Nayarit (100 B.C.-300 A.D.), and by inference, the four bone awls or objects may fall within this time span. However, Hasso von Winning suggests that they belong to a later period in Mesoamerican cultural history, when Mixtec influence affected West Mexico. Bone artifacts occurred frequently if not universally in American Indian technologies and took the form of tools such as awls, spatulas, scrapers and</page><page sequence="38">256 American Indian Quarterly files. Others were seemingly decorative such as beads whose varying forms differentiated status. The objects (120 A-B-C-D) do not appear to be tool types, nor do they conform to the usual form of ornamentation. Rather, a socio-religious function is more likely. The bone objects may have had a purely mortuary purpose but like so many kinds of grave offerings may have had an additional utility in the ritual activities of the living, such as shamanism, soothsaying, offerings, or even priestly paraphernalia. It is always desirable to find comparative data from other sites, especially from West Mexico. However, comparative data is seemingly rare or nearly non-existent in West Mexico. Peter Furst and Stanley Long (1966) carried out shaft tomb salvage programs in southwestern Nayarit and Jalisco, respectively, but no bone awls like these were retrieved. Clement Meighan and Leonard Foote uncovered bone artifacts from Tizapan El Alto, one of which was a spatula with a carved animal head deposited with a burial. Incised bone artifacts occur in other parts of Mesoamerica such as Campeche (during the Late Classic), Cholula and during the late Post Classic in Aztec culture (127 [Deer Bone With Incised Design Showing Two Eagles With Flags, Valley of Mexico (?), Aztec period, A.D. 1350-1521]). West Mexican archaeology suffers from the fact that shaft tombs and other sites are invariably looted of their contents. Items such as the bone awls may generally be discarded as being trivial compared to more sought after "Chinesca" material and other exotic artifacts; the absence of recorded bone objects may be the result of the continuing non-scientific digging, and the limited interest of collectors in these artifacts. The technique of applying data drawn from contemporary Indian societies, such as the Huichol of Nayarit, in an explanation of the archaeological record has proven to be a productive avenue of research. This ethnohistorical technique is based on the assumption that a contemporary group, such as the Huichol Indians, are the cultural heirs of earlier groups living in the region of interest, in this case, Nayarit. One might postulate that these bone awls were used in shamans' ritual activities if ethnographic reference could be found demonstrating an analogous practice among contemporary Huichol shamans. No known evidence exists that the latter used bone awls in ritual. However, shamans in other American Indian societies employed sacred bones such as the Pomo of Central California. Nonetheless there are other suggestive links between the objects and Huichol ethnography. As one example, the deer holds a central position in the Huichol world view. Deer bones and antlers litter some of the temple or god- house sites and are especially linked to the shamans. The choice of remains such as bones of a given species for the production of sacred items may be governed by the religious concepts operating in a given social system. There was an Aztec veneration for unmodified human bones as well as symbolic bones depicted with paint or dough (Florentine Codex). By analogy, the an- cestors of Huichol shamans may have chosen the remains of certain species such as the deer for the manufacture of sacred paraphernalia such as the two deer bone "awls" (120 B-D) because of the central position the deer held in their cosmos and because of a role played by these objects in rituals linked to the deer. Supporting this argument are the possible meanings of the fishnet or carrying net design on the modified deer tibia (120 D). The net design closely</page><page sequence="39">Bibliography, Research, and News 257 resembles the "back-shield" design of the Huichols which symbolizes a deer snare, the bed of the gods, rain and prayer for rain. Rain and the inducement to rain is a central interest of the Huichol; rain emerged from the forehead of a deer according to Huichol cosmogony. There is a logic inherent in the execution of this design on a piece of deer bone. This design element appears on West Mexican ceramic figurines such as (207 [Seated Male Holding A Bowl And A Staff, Chinesca style of Nayarit, Museum of Natural History, Los Angeles County]), on which the net motif appears on front and back. The dog played an ideological role in the early Classic societies of West Mexico where figurines have been found showing dogs with shamans. In contemporary Huichol society the dog as well as the coyote function in the belief system. Dogs function as aids to shamans, accompany the deceased to the underworld and are thought to have curative qualities by many con- temporary Mexicans. One role of the shaman is diagnosis and cure of diseases. The modified canine bone (120 C) may reflect the importance of canines in shamanistic activities in Prehispanic Nayarit. Finally, the modified feline bone (120 A), may have been associated with an ancient veneration for the ocelot or some other feline. A role played by this species in Huichol world view and shamanism would place this object in a more meaningful perspective. A veneration for "tigers" or ocelots is an element in Huichol world view as shown by the presence of images of tigers in their god- houses and the depiction of their fire god as a feline holding an arrow. These examples are only a few of the interpretive possibilities in the study of connections between raw material and design elements in archaeological data and the world views of contemporary or historically treated ethnic groups.

Early in 1974, a magnificently carved Maya stela was placed on extended loan at the Museum of Science in Miami, Florida. Identified as Stela 24 from Naranjo, Guatemala, this stone monument dates to A.D. 702, when it was made to commemorate certain important historical and astronomical events. On the stela, a large authoritative figure, elaborately costumed in a beaded tunic, a tall headdress with feather plumes and ornate sandals, stands on the back of a prostrate captive. Hieroglyphics containing dates and other vital information cover the rest of the monument's surface. The stela, which was first discovered in 1905 by the archaeologist Teobert Maler, was removed illegally from Naranjo in the mid 1960s. At that time it was broken up by thieves to be smuggled out of Guatemala. Fortunately the</page><page sequence="40">258 American Indian Quarterly police recovered the pieces and returned it to the government's possession. Through the tireless efforts of many people both in Guatemala and the United States, the Guatemalan government has allowed the stela to be exhibited at the Museum of Science on extended loan while it retains ownership of the monument. Such agreement between countries with extensive archaeological remains and foreign museums can be seen as a positive step toward achieving international cooperation to ensure the protection of archaeological treasures. Donated to the Denver Museum of Natural History in 1968, the Crane Collection of Native North American artifacts has found an unusual home. The concept, organization, and presentation of the Collection represent a sensitive approach to Native American cultures. In 1973, the Museum's board of trustees formally recognized the Native American Advisory Council, which currently represents 25 tribes. The purpose of the Council is to review all materials and labels to insure that respectful interpretation is made and to suggest, research, and aid in the installation of at least one temporary exhibition each year. The Council will remain an informal group so that "all people from all tribes and representatives of all thoughts feel free to join." Working as teams by tribe and region, Council members will meet once a month to work on special projects, review material, and suggest labels. Museum conservator-preparator, Patty Harjo, a Senecca-Seminole, serves as coordinator of native American affairs and the Museum's liaison with the Council. Items in the Crane Collection range from Alaska and Canada to the tip of South America, and in time from pre-Columbian to the present. Valued in excess of one million dollars, the Collection is being installed in the Museum's new Crane Hall of Historic Native Americans, which will open over a five-year period. The first exhibits, opened in February, 1974, illustrate the achievements of Eskimos, Northwest Coast totem pole carvers, and the Seminoles of the Southeast. According to Arminta Neal, curator of the Crane Hall, the exhibits are conceived to illustrate the effects on the tribes' cultural materials after contact with the white man's European culture. In addition, they show what Native Americans in each culture are doing today, both socially and vocationally. Visually, the exhibits emphasize the natural-history backgrounds of the various tribal cultures and show their relationship to the environment. For example, in the Eskimo section a poured plastic floor simulates slush ice and refrigerated air blows across it. Visitors hear the moan of a low wind, the sound of barking dogs and the taped conversation of two men talking in Eskimo. After four years of planning and negotiations, the National Museum of Man, Ottawa, Canada, succeeded in repatriating the Speyer Collection of Canadian Indian artifacts. This acquisition is significant for two major reasons: 1) In predating 1850, the artifacts are unique in representing the traditional culture of the Canadian Indians; and 2) the return of the Speyer Collection is an un- precedented example of repatriation, following the growing international concern over the illegal trafficking of cultural properties and general dispersion of primitive cultures. Arthur Speyer, Jr. was well known in German museum circles for his ethnographic collection. In the 1920s his interests focused ex- clusively on early Native American objects. Speyer spent years tracing the</page><page sequence="41">Bibliography, Research, and News 259 European descendants of early travelers to the New World who had purchased souvenirs from the Indians. Indian artifacts from the New Jersey State Museum at Trenton are on display through May, 1975. The exhibition features objects collected by the late Charles A. Philhower. The exhibits staff at the Texas Memorial Museum at Austin has carried out a design by Patrick Mehaffey in an exhibition of North American rock art. Placed in a realistic setting that resembles a West Texas cave, samples of pictographs and petroglyphs are shown with information about this important link with the past. The exhibit will run until June, 1975. A guide to the exhibit is free. The exhibition, Indian Baskets, will run from May 20 to June 29, 1975, at the Museum of the Southwest, Midland, Texas. On January 23, 1975, Frontier America, a traveling exhibit featuring art and artifacts of the wild West, opened at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Among the 300 objects on display are Indian artifacts dating back to 700 A.D., religious carvings, and architectural fragments from mission churches. The museum's curator of American Decorative Arts, Jonathan Fairbanks, calls Frontier America a show about the common man, whose objects and materials are just beginning to interest cultural historians. The exhibit, which closed in Boston on March 12, will be at the Denver Art Museum, April 16-June 1; the Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego July 2-August 17; the W.R. Nelson Gallery of Art, Kansas City, September 17-November 2; and the Milwaukee Art Center December 5-January 18, 1976. The State Historical Society of Wisconsin (Madison) received the papers (1892-1937) of Carlos Montezuma, a Chicago physician, member of the Society of American Indians, advocate of assimilation of the American Indian, and leader of the pan-Indian movement. The records include correspondence, financial records, writings and notes, and printed materials from many sources dealing with the American Indian. The Oklahoma Historical Society (Oklahoma City) opened the Jim Thorpe Home at Yale, Oklahoma, on September 16, 1973. The house has been restored to the condition it was when occupied by the Thorpe family from 1917 to 1923. It is open to the public. CENTERS AND INSTITUTES A center for the History of the American Indian has been established at the Newberry Library in Chicago. It has been developed in collaboration with the Committee on Institutional Cooperation, an organization which represents eleven major universities in the Midwest-Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Michigan State, Minnesota, Northwestern, Ohio State, Purdue, Wisconsin, and the University of Chicago.</page><page sequence="42">260 American Indian Quarterly The purposes of the Center- to increase the number of competent scholars in the field of Indian studies and to make study and research materials available at all levels of education-will be developed over a five-year period. The first year was devoted to planning. In the following years the program will be carried out in a number of ways: Three post-doctoral fellows will be appointed each year; two of them will be American historians, preferably American Indians, the third will be an anthropologist or sociologist. In addition, four predoctoral fellows will be designated for each of the four years to work in the field of American Indian history, with preference again being given to American Indians. The library will also sponsor an institute for high-school teachers in social studies, conducted each summer by the staff of the program on American Indian history. In order to further the spread of research materials, the program will also prepare three bibliographies that will provide the basis for three "libraries" to be made available in microprint form to high schools, colleges, universities, and Indian tribes and organizations. The Instituto Indigenista Interamericano, with the collaboration of the Instituto Nacional Indigenista of Mexico and the Organization of American States, organized a Curso de Observacion y Practica Indigenista in 1973. Government and academic officials from Colombia, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Panama attended the course. participant received basic information on various aspects of indigenous policy which is applied in Mexico, and on general topics of social and applied anthropology. Major participants did field work in Oaxaca, Chiapas, Michoacan, Hidalgo, and Veracruz. For additional in- formation write: Alejandro D.

Both the location (Mexico City) and the time (June 20-22, 1973, the summer solstice) of the meeting were well suited to the subject of the three-day session, "Archaeoastronomy in Precolumbian America," which in turn fitted well into the general theme of the two-week series of meetings on "Science and Man in the Americas." Arranged by Anthony F. Aveni, Colgate University, and the architect Horst Hartung, University of Guadalajara, the program offered 28 papers by scholars from a number of American and foreign countries, who exhibited a wide range of professional backgrounds; they included nine anthropologists, two planetarium directors, four astronomers, a geographer, a psychologist, a historian, an archaeologist and four laymen. The paper "Mesoamerican Ethno-astronomy" delivered by Michael Coe, an anthropologist of Yale University, provided conferees with a general background by alluding to ethnohistoric knowledge, such as the native American constellations, observation of eclipses, comets and other spectacular phenomena, as well as astronomical materials in the extant codices and other surviving documents and artifacts. His talk left no doubt that the people of the Precolumbian world were preoccupied with watching the heavens and that, while astrology and astronomy were deeply intertwined, much of their astronomy was of a practical nature. Indeed one priest in the Mendoza Codex is seen to be "watching the stars at night in order to ascertain the hour, that being his particular function." Even the great Montezuma, king of the Aztecs, is told upon his coronation not to neglect his most important duty, namely, "to rise at midnight and to offer incense to certain principal stars." Above all, Coe stressed the need for communication with the surviving native descendants of the Aztecs, such as the Lacandones, who can give much information regarding the astronomical and calendrical practices of their ancestors. Gerald Hawkins, an astronomer, delivered a paper entitled "Astroarch- aeology: The Unwritten Evidence," which concerned Stonehenge, a site which he now views as a repository for all alignments found at the various Megalithic sites rather than as a functioning astronomical observatory. He discussed his analysis of the linear markings on the desert at Nasca, Peru, which he finds are not of an astronomical origin, and the alignment of temples and pyramids in Egypt, which show some interesting possibilities for astronomical orientation. In particular, a small side chapel at Abu Simbel may have been used to mark the swing position of the sun at the winter solstice. On the basis of the papers presented, the subject matter of the conference can be divided into three broad, though not totally unrelated areas. (A) Ceremonial and Rock Art in the Southwestern United States. Several papers presented on this subject suggested that the ancient native, Anasazi and other</page><page sequence="44">262 American Indian Quarterly peoples of this region did indeed record astronomical phenomena on the walls and ceilings of caves. Representations of constellations were noted on star ceilings at the Canyon de Chelly, and a number of rock-art representations possibly of the Crab Nebula supernova which could be seen in A.D. 1054 were described. The supernova not only would have passed near the zenith of the Mesoamerican sky but also would have been so spectacular as to have been visible in broad daylight. It is not known how the Central Mexicans and the Maya, with their more sophisticated systems of writing, would have recorded the event, which they certainly must have observed. Papers relating to rock art included "American Indian Interest in the Sky Indicated in Legend, Rock Art, Ceremonial and Modern Art" by Von Del Chamberlain of Michigan State University, "The Pueblo Sun-Moon-Star Calendar in the Southwestern United States" by Florence H. Ellis of the University of New Mexico, "The Astronomical Record in Chaco Canyon" by R.A. Williamson and others, "Early Navajo Astronomical Pictographs in Canyon de Chelly" by Claude Britt, Jr., of Chinle, Arizona and "Evidence for the Depiction of Star Patterns in Indian Petroglyphs" by Dorothy Mayer of Berkeley, California. Most participants in this section concluded that more time ought to be expended in looking for possible astronomical references in rock art. (B) Native American Calendars and the Correlation Question. Though one paper focused on the Aztec calendar, the bulk of the attention was confined to the question of how to correlate the Maya with the Christian calendar. This subject produced heated debate among proponents of more than a dozen correlations which span a total of five hundred years. Some correlations rely on the assumption that noteworthy astronomical events, e.g., the occurrence of comets, novae, planetary conjunctions, eclipses and eclipse seasons, were recorded in the codices and the elaborately carved stelae of the Maya. The known Christian dates of such phenomena can then be used to put the Maya calendar in phase with our own. But which events ought to be selected and which excluded? And did the scribes and sculptors make mistakes in the record? To no one's surprise not a single correlation could be agreed upon, but the one-day session on the calendar brought together many individuals who had previously been working alone, and their meeting forecast good prospects for considerable cooperation in the future. Rual Noriega, of Mexico City, discussed how the Aztecs utilized a com- plicated calendric system involving 260-, 360-, and 365-day periods in addition to a lunar count. Nancy Owen, Solana Beach, California, revived the Makemson Correlation by suggesting that intervals between eclipses using that correlation corresponded well with dates in the Dresden Codex, a famous Maya astronomical document. Franz Hockleitner of Universidad Fora, Brazil, employed much the same technique, substituting his own correlation for that of Makemson. Charles Smiley of Brown University also examined eclipse intervals to test a correlation he had devised, while Hubert Harber of West Chester State College dealt with a search for comet and nova dates. David Kelley of Calgary University presented intervals of possible astronomical significance found on Stele 3, Caracol, Guatemala. Marion Hatch of the University of California, Berkeley, elaborated on the existence of a possible astronomical calendar in the Madrid Codex, another of the three surviving Maya texts. Two papers integrating agricultural cycles into native American astronomy were "An Astronomical Interpretation of the Four Ball-court</page><page sequence="45">Bibliography, Research, and News 263 Panels at Tajin, Mexico" by Carmen Cook de Leonard of Mexico City and "Astronomical Implications of the Maya Agricultural Calendar" by Harold Shaw of the Canal Zone. A paper on the calendar which attracted considerable attention was Alexander Marshack's (Peabody Museum, Harvard University) "Cognitive Analysis of an Arithmetic Calendar Olmec Mosaic ca. 1200 B.C." His reconstruction of the sequence in which pieces in a mosaic pendant were inlaid suggests that the Olmec kept a 354-day lunar count at a very early date. (C) Astronomical Orientation of Buildings. In a field in which practically no work has appeared in print, several investigators discussed their common goals in attempting to determine the extent to which Mesoamerican structures were astronomically aligned. In discussing guidelines for future research in this area, it became clear that unless (a) investigators possess some knowledge of the culture with which they are dealing, and (b) careful measurements on original structures at the sites are employed, any hypotheses regarding the matching of archaeological and astronomical alignments ought to be given little weight. This view was stressed in particular by Jonathan Reyman of Southern Illinois University in his paper. Studies at Teotihuacan, one of the few sites to be measured carefully, suggest strongly that the rectangular grid structure was laid out to align with astronomical reference points along the horizon, according to R. David Drucker of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project. Other ancient cities in Central Mexico seem to favor the same general 150 to 170 east of north orientation. The orientations in a large number of cases appear to be genuinely functional rather than purely ritualistic in their layout. Specific examples, such as Mound J at Monte Alban and the Caracol of Chichen Itza, were cited in papers read by Hartung and Aveni. Thaddeus Cowan of Kansas State University compared sighting schemes used by the Megalithic cultures and the effigy Mound Builders of the central United States. Robert Fuson, University of South Florida, was concerned with the multitude of physical and cultural factors which might affect the arrangement and alignment of structures within a given building complex. Other papers referring to the astronomical alignment of buildings were presented by the architect Alfonso Hurtado of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico and by Franklin Marsh of Goddard Space Flight Center. Some of the par- ticipants interested in astronomical orientation planned future fieldwork together as a result of the meeting. The sessions were summarized by Elizabeth Chesley Baity of the University of North Carolina, and a field trip to Teotihuacan capped the three-day session. Ample facilities for informal discussion sessions and seminars were provided by the Centro Medico, the host for the meeting. The central question under discussion at the conclusion of both the formal and the informal sessions was: Does Mesoamerican archaeoastronomy exist as a bona fide interdisciplinary field commanding more than just various segments of the traditionally established fields of archaeology, New World history, cultural anthropology, positional astronomy, architecture, etc.? It is the opinion of the author that, from the interest and cooperation among all the participants both during and outside the conference and from the quality of the papers presented, the field has clearly established itself. Whether it can and should be tied into a cross- cultural approach involving Old World astronomy has yet to be determined. The number of questions and problems still to be resolved is staggering, for at this juncture we know practically nothing of the scientific-cultural heritage left us by the people of Precolumbian America. The conferees have made a</page><page sequence="46">264 American Indian Quarterly beginning by using the Mexico City meeting as an occasion for defining some of the problems and by sharing viewpoints for the first time.
