THE Theory of Subjective Activity is the theory that the active principle in experience is to be found in the self-conscious subject of experience, that activity is psychical not physical, mental not material, rational not empirical, inherent in the subject as knower not in the object known. It is an attemipt to overcome the dualism of Nature and Mind by explaining Nature as a system of laws, the unity, causality, and regularity of which are the product of the activity of coniscious beingrs. This theory has been lately set forth witlh great force and ability by Dr. Ward in the Gifford Lectures on Naturalism and Agnosticismn, and my references are mainly to that work. I do not, however, in any way attempt to give an account of Dr. Ward's theory, or to examilne it in detail. With much of the argument I am in substantial agreement, and particularly with his destructive criticism of the theories of Naturalism and Agnosticism. In the later lectures he has developed a con- structive theory which he has named Spiritualistic Monism. It is this theory which seems to me impossible by reason of an initial difficulty common to all monistic theories, and the object of this paper is simply to invite discussion of that difficulty. The theory of subjective activity is the theory that " subjects with intrinsic qualities and causally efficient" are facts of experience prior to and independent of the scientific colnception of Nature, and give rise to it. " Subjects with varied intrinsic qualities, causal agents," are known by us first and indepen- dlently of Nature and its laws, and " we can pass fromn them to it but never from it to them." Laws of nature, natural agency, and causality are anthropomorphic conceptions resting on</page><page sequence="2">192 H. WILDON CARRI. analogy, but " man's intellectual and practical activity is fact and not analogy." Startilng from self-activity as fact, we have first '- the experienlce of intersubjective intercourse." This yields a complete knowledge of what is, primnd facie, causal efficacy, the interaction of man and manl of which Society,. Civilisation, and Science are the result. It is allowed that such iinteraction takes place through the mediumi or instriumelntality of matter, buLt in respect of it miiatter occupies an enitirely secondary anid subservient position. Secondly, we lhave "the experience of the individual subject, not with other suibjects but with the physical environment simply." Here there is evidence of action only, not of interaction. "Lastly we have the unliversal experience of science, in which objective clhanges. are regarded solely in relation to each other." Here there is no direct evidence of action at all, only the fact of change. The interpretation of such experiences as inidividual things. interacting is an anthropomorphic interpretation after the analogy of suibjects. This is the view that I am calling the theory of subjective activity. (Naturalismi, anid Ayqgosticis?21, Lecture XX.) There are two distinct senses in which we may speak of the subject, anid in the present connection the distinction seemiis to me of first importance. There is the pure subject, what we nmay call the epistemological subject in distinction to the psychological subject. It is the episteniological subject that is intended wlhen we speak of the relation of subject to object.. It is the sense intended by Dr. Ward in the sentenice: " You caninot dismember percipient and percept, iindividual subject and concrete object into twvo distinct andl separate thlinlgs: here there is only duality inl unity." The sul)ject of know- ledge is only recognisable as the term of a relationi. It cannot be perceived because it is always perceiver. To perceive it would be (per impossibile) to make it a perception, and of that perception it would be the perceiver not the perceived. It is impossible to characterise the subject 2)er se. It is purely</page><page sequence="3">THE THEORY OF SUBJECTIVE ACTIVITY. 193 formal, it is unaffected by the variety, qualitative or quanti- tative of the perception, all characterisation is for it not of it. The terms of the subject-object relation do not quialify one another, there is no meaning in callingt the subject, objective or the object, subjective. Experience supposes a subject of experience, perception a percipient,, but the infinite diversity of experience is in the object and for the subject. The subject is present as a part of consciousness in all experience, but it cannot be presented to itself without losing, its character of subject aild beconming object for a subject. Clearly then the subject in the epistemological sense cannot be active or causal, activity wouild make it independent of the object, causality would make it prior to the object. But there is another sense in which the term subject is used, viz., the psychological sense. The psychological subject is the "I" of I feel, I can, I do, the " thou," " he," " we," " you," " they," when used as individual subject or subjects of experience. Our knowledge is direct only of the first person, we know our own self by reflecting on our personal experience, other selves we know indirectly by analog,y or inCerence or "intro- jection." The psychological subject can be presented to coni- sciousness, whether as the consciousness of self or of another, and in the presentation it must inevitably lose the character of pure subjectivity, it becomes an object for a subject. It is only if and when I am conscious of myself in perceiving as perceiving that I am conscious of real subjectivity, any content that I put into the perceiving self is my perception, it is object not subject of my experience. The psychological subject, when thought of as it must be thought of as a distin- guishable something, is epistemologically object not subject. But it is an object distilnguished from other objects by this peculiar mark, that it is in intimate connection with the epistemological subject, it is within it that the pure subject may be said to lie, and it arises as a distinct somewhat in the attempt to present this subject per se. To attribute</page><page sequence="4">194 H. WILDON CARR. activity to the pure subject is impossible, and to attribute it to the psychological subject is not necessari]y to malce activity subjective unless it can also be shown to attach to such subjects purely on their subjective side, to belong to them as knowers not as objects known. Now this doctrine of subjective activity is brought forward as a refutation of Dualism, and as a satisfactory substitute for Dualism in its final form it is named Spiritualistic Monisni. The subject- object relation as a fundamental characteristic of experience is not, Dr. Ward holds, a dualism, but a duality in unity. If the dualism that it is the object of the theory to refute is the doctrine that subject and object are in any sense whatever disparate, and if duality in unity is the expression of the doctrine that subject and object is the necessary twofold expression of what is one fact, then it seems to me that we are confronted with this dilemma-that we cannot characterise the pure subject as active for the simple reason that we cannot characterise it at all, and on the other hand it is only of the pure subject that we can say that the subject-object relation is a fundanmental characteristic of experience. Endow the pure subject with activity, and dualism is the inevitable result; a characterised subject is a substance. I may attribute activity to the self-conscious subject of experience, the psychological subject, and in the sense that all experience, and activity as experience, is the experience of a self-conscious subject I must do so. If I attempt to attribute activity to the self-conscious subject, not as its experience, but as its nature independent of its experience I make the subject a mental substance, and can only escape the dualism of mental and material by making all objective experience the creature or product of this subject. Dualism may be got rid of by denying the independenice of the mental series, and making mind dependent on, created or produced by, the material series; or by denying the indepen- delnce of the material series and making, the objective world a creation or production of the mental world; or by denyir-g the</page><page sequence="5">THE THEORY OF SUBJECTIVE ACTIVITY. 1 9 5 independence of either series and reconcilina their appearance in the absolute reality. Dr. Ward's argument seems to me to be an attempt to establish Monism by the second of these methods. He has shown in an admirable and very minute analysis the failure of various attemipts to attain it by the first method. It seems to me that failure must equally attend the second method, and that success is only possible, if at all, by the third method. Dualisin, or rather that view of the world which gives rise to Dualism, is due, according to Dr. Ward's most interestina and somewhat novel analysis, to a misinterpretation of experi- ence. In ordinary experience taken alone, there is, according to this view., no dualism, only duality, the duality in unity of subject and object. The object is not a manifold unified by the subject, and the subject is not indifferent to the object. The whole is a continuum, the diversity, interest, and meaning of which is for the subject. Taking a single subject with its experience, Dr. Ward appears to me to hold that there is no discrepancy between knowing and being, no conception of a real order distinct from a perceived order. That which we designate the external world, and imagine as possessing independent existence, is a conception due to intersubjective intercourse. The objects of our experience are the product of such intercourse, and have acquired by it that appearance of externality and independence that characterises them. There is, however, one fact of experience that seems to me absolutely fatal to this contention. Intersubjective. intercourse is only possible through the mediation of matter; how can imiatter be the product of that of which it is a condition ? I do not under value the enormous importance of intersubjective intercourse as a factor in the formation of our world of experience, but it seems to me that the interpretation or misinterpretation of experience that gives rise to the problem of dualism is founded on facts of experience into which it does not enter-facts prior to and the condition of intersubjective N 2</page><page sequence="6">196 H. WILDON CARR. intercourse. We have no immediate experience of any con- sciousness but our own, and if we try to imagine an experience devoid of the conception of independent objects, it would be an experience not only incommunicable, but devoid of the idea of communication. The idea of a world of objects independenit of consciousness seems to me to rest on the experience that consciousness does not produce its sensations. Consciousness is aware of sensations, not the cause or condition of them. The conlcept of subjective activity as the basis of spiritualistic monism is no more satisfactory when regarded from the side of the concept of activity. The concept of activity is objective for knowledge, whether it be derived from observation of external nature or from introspective analysis of consciousness. It is quite intelligible to hold that subjective activity is the solution of the problem of the relation of mind to body, meaning that activity is found entirely in the psychical series that we call mind. The conlception is full of difficulty, and l)r. Ward is driven to admit that, certain and indisputable as he regards the fact of subjective activity to be, the mode of its activity is wholly inconceivable (IT, 244). But it seems to me that it is just this conlception of the mode of activity that the psychological problem requires if subjective activity is its solution. As the attribute of a subject or psychical agent there is no difficulty in the conception of activity. Activity and passivity are relative terms which I constantly apply to mnyself, however I conceive that self. My purely psychical thoughts and feelings have very distinct and ascertainable physical effects. The puzzle is not the reality of such activity, but the conception of the mode of it. If the mode of it is inconceivable, there is aln end of it as a solution ; it does not rid us of a single difficulty. Activity and passivity are relative terms; they do not constitute the subject they qualify; and the question at once arises, What, apart from such qualification, is the subject ? If we succeed in distinguishing, the conscious self as a somewhat distinct from the material organism which</page><page sequence="7">TilE THEORY OF SUBJECTIVE ACTIVITY. 197 conditions it, we must then show that the agency inheres in it as its nature and does not belong to the order of its con- ditioning. In all this we are dealina with consciousness as anl existent. The question with which we are here concerned is a purely metaphysical one, the relation of knowing to being. I cannot see that even if it be granted that activity is psychical, not physical, we are advanced one step toward the solution of the fundamental metaphysical problem, and, unless we can solve it, what is the meaning of spiritualistic monism, and how can we claim to have refuted duialism ? The transition from the psychological to the metaphysical problem seems to ime to rest simply on the ambiguity of the word subject, which denotes the term of an indissoluble and incommutable relation and also a psychical agent with intrinsic qualities. Dr. Ward insists on the reality of subjective activity: in one passage he considers the terms convertible, and declares that subjective activity is reality (II, 53). In another he distinguishes it from the con- ception of it and the perception of it (II, 244). And finally he identifies it with apperception. " Activity is of the essence of the relation (of subject to object), though it does not make it, and-givilng the wide meaning to apperception that is somne- times given to it-we may say with Kant that amiong all our presentations this is 'the only one that cannot be uiven by the object, but must be wrought solely by the subject itself, since it is an act of its own self-activity "' (II, 245). All this can onily mean the identity of activity with consciousness or expe- rience in its universal aspect. It is of the essence of the subject-object relation, though it does not produce it. It is therefore in some sense ideintical with the " unity in duality," which is the universal characteristic of experience. Now what possible meanino can we give to this ultimate conception ? It is a vain attempt to characterise the Absolute. This brings us to the direct question. Is thought or con- sciousness per se an activity ? Is thought or consciousness in its nature as distinct from its genesis, to use a distinction of</page><page sequence="8">198 H. WILDON CARR. Mr. Shadworth Hodgson's, an activity ? Is activity a true description of the nature of thought in abstraction from any- thing that may be supposed to condition it ? And if it be, is the activity of thought identical with the activity thought of, can we pass by it from Mind to Nature, from knowing to being ? Thought is a process. A train of thought is the evolution of a meaning or a purpose accordingr as the emphasis is laid on intellect or will. In all rational thinking the thoughts pure and simple lead from one to another. Thinking may be in itself dependent on the activity of nerve cells, but a train of thought, a rational argument, depends for its meaning and consistency purely on the thoughts as such, and niot on the material conditions of the thoughts. We mnay imagine a series of nerve changes running parallel with a train of thought, but we cannot imagine a series of nerve changes determining the meaning of the thoughts or the purpose of the thoughts. If the train of thought be A is B, B is C, A is C, we cannot imagine this to be determined by the nerve changes in such a way that nerve changes might have forced the conclusion A is D. Or if the thought take the form of intention or purpose, we cannot imagine that that purpose is the particular purpose it is and not another, because the nerve change is what it is and not another. The purpose is what it is by reason of its connection with the train of thought pure and simple, however the existence of that train of thought may be imagined to be conditioned by a series of nerve changes. Independently of any view that may be held of the natule of the relation of the psychical to the physical series, whether that it is a simple parallelism without interaction of any kind, or that one series is produced by the other series, or that the two series are two in aspect only, what appears as a physical series being experi- enced as a psychical series, this fact remains-that there is in pure and simple thought something which depends in no sense whatever on the physical conditions of thought or on anything but simple thought itself, viz., meaning and purpose.</page><page sequence="9">THE THEORY OF SUBJECTIVE ACTIVJITY. 199 Is this process of thought that we describe as meaning or purpose in itself an activity ? And is this activity identical for knowing and being ? Spiritualistic Monism is the affirma- tive aniswer to these questions. Is such answer possible ? Now there is a distinction in knowledge which would seem to be fundamental, if such a thing as a fundameintal distinction exists, between the knowledg,e of an object and the object known, but this theory requires that in the case of one object, activity, the knowledge is one and the same with the object known. Our knowing is the activity we know. This seems to me a perfectly impossible contention. It involves the contradiction that activity both is and is not an object of thought. It is an object of thought because it is thought of and known as a real condition, and it is at the same time not an object of thought because it is itself the thinking or knowing. This I imagine to be the difficulty which drives Dr. Ward to distinguish activity from the concept and the percept of it (II, 244). There is no escape fronm the dilemnma, as object of thought it is a concept, and every concept has a content, and knowledge is the determination of that content. Activity has no such unique position as is claimed for it, and even if it had, if activity be allowed as a right description of meaning or purpose in logical process, it is absolutely worthless for the purpose of establishing a doctrine of spiritualistic monism, inasmuch as it cannot be identified with physical activity. Physical activity is not identical with the knowledge of it, and activity in the psychical sense cannot possibly be claimed for it. On this question Mr. Shadworth Hodgson's conclusion seems to me entirely right, that activity or agency is an object of knowledge not found in the nature of knowledge itself by analysis, though his argument is different, being based on the philosophical analysi5 of consciousness without assump- tions, whereas mine rests entirely on a dialectical difficulty in the conception. Activity, as experienced, is not unique in the sense of being an identity of knowing and being. Logical process can only be described by purely logical terms.</page></plain_text>
