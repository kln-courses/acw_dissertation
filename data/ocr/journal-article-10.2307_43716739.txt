Pp. [xiv] + 221. Paper SwF 55. The story of Jacob's wrestling with an "angel" proves to be an excellent focus for this study of early Jewish exegesis. As the author notes, several key elements in this narrative, such as the apparent anthropomorphism and the etiology for the name Israel, along with the Bible's succinct, sometimes ambiguous style, offered many exegetical possibilities. Indeed, the process of interpretation begins as early as the biblical period itself, although it reached its most extensive form during the time of the rabbis. In tracing this process, Butterweck addresses all major texts where the narrative is treated. It is surprising to learn that it is not included everywhere one might expect, such as in the book of Jubilees , which does contain some themes elsewhere associated with this story. The first and one of the longer sections of B.'s book deals with the biblical narrative itself, providing a substantial overview of scholarly discussion accompanied by a traditio-historical analysis of Genesis 32. Understanding the nature and back- ground of the existing text is an important component in a study of its exegetical history. The author notes that the Genesis account gives evidence of a process of</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 531 development lying behind the current tradition. Unfortunately, she tends to note such facts without fully examining the nature of that process or exploring its ramifications. The book then discusses this story's treatment in Hosea, Josephus, Wisdom of Solomon, Philo, and the Prayer of Joseph (embedded in Origen's Commentary on John , 11.31). Here the author's thesis begins to emerge, viz., that the various interpre- ters have sought to understand the biblical text in a way meaningful to their own contemporaries. Although transparently true, such a hypothesis hardly exhausts the questions to be raised in such a study. One must ask what influences led to the various interpretations here described. Did exegetes simply superimpose their own ideologies on an available biblical text, or were the meanings which they present already some- how implicit in the Genesis account? This question becomes especially crucial once the focus shifts to rabbinic and patristic literature where polemical and theological concerns are so often at stake. The book's main emphasis is apparently given over to rabbinic interpretations. The author sorts out this potentially chaotic material according to thematic cate- gories, with the roles of Jacob and the "angel" examined separately. How this is carried out can be seen in the case of the angel, which is depicted in several distinct ways. Viewed as the guardian of Esau (i.e., Edom = Rome), the angel becomes a political symbol. Elsewhere, it does God's will by encouraging Jacob's obedience to the commandments. The ambivalence reflected in such differing views about this incident is mirrored in the writings of the Church Fathers who were able variously to identify Christ with either Jacob or the angel. Unfortunately, B. tends simply to point out such facts rather than seek to explore them fully. Some of this variety surely resulted from the ambiguity of the biblical text itself (e.g., Gen 32:30b, where the identities of the verb's subject and object are not entirely clear), yet one senses that there were other factors responsible for the interpretations here studied and these too merit elucidation. The chapter on Rashi is puzzling. As B. clearly shows, this medieval exegete provides a synthesis of midrashic tradition, offering little that is new to the under- standing of this passage. It is for precisely this reason, however, that his treatment can hardly be said to typify the medieval Jewish approach as the chapter's title implies ("frühmittelalterliche Exegese ... am Beispiel Raschis"). Even granting B.'s reluctance to tackle the mystical tradition, the tendency to present Rashi as epitomiz- ing medieval Jewish exegesis, an approach hardly unique to this work, obscures the diversity and importance of a period which should have been either thoroughly studied or altogether ignored. The inclusion of a relatively brief reference to a Pauper's Bible (ca. 1420-30), now found in the Heidelberg University Library, is similarly perplexing. In sum, Genesis 32 serves as a useful focus through which to trace the history of early Jewish biblical interpretation. Despite some omissions (see the notes to this passage in L. Ginzberg's Legends of the Jews) and overstatements (e.g., it is hardly clear that yiśra^el was commonly related to the root šwr in the hellenistic period as B. contends on pp. 30 and 65; Philo's treatment could be based on the same etymology as that of the rabbis), most of the relevant texts are conveniently collected and translated here, and much prior scholarship is summarized. Although the author's</page><page sequence="3">532 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 46, 1984 chronological arrangement of the material suggests a process of unfolding interpreta- tion in which one exegete draws on another, describing such interrelationships is clearly not the book's dominant theme. Only in the all too brief conclusion is a serious effort at understanding the dynamic behind the history of this story's interpre- tation attempted. This book will serve as a useful tool in preparing the way for a broader study of the development of a biblically based tradition. Frederick E.
