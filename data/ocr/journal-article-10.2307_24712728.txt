<plain_text><page sequence="1">RITUAL CHANGE AND THE DISTANT: MESOAMERICAN ICONOGRAPHY, SCARLET MACAWS, AND GREAT KIVAS IN THE MIMBRES REGION OF SOUTHWESTERN NEW MEXICO Patricia A. Gilman, Marc Thompson, and Kristina C. Wyckoff The Mimbres Classic period (A.D. 1000-1130) in southwestern New Mexico was marked by dramatic and complex changes. The use of Great Kivas ended, and macaws and Mesoamerican-inspired iconography appeared. We argue that these events were systematically related and signify observable changes in Mimbres ritual economy. The presence of macaws, images of macaws, and representations of characters and motifs from the Hero Twins saga suggest that ideology accompanied macaws north from the Gulf Coast of Mexico. We recognize and discuss episodes and icons from the saga painted on Mimbres black on-white bowls and propose that the macaws and narrative reached the Mimbres region through direct acquisition rather than down-the-line trade. This research has significant implications for the importance of long distance travel to faraway places and interaction with distant peoples, Mesoamerican-southwestern United States relationships, changing religious practices in non-hierarchical societies, and the adoption of extrinsic elements into local settings. El Periodo Clásico Mimbres (1000-1130 d.C) en el sudoeste de Nuevo México estuvo marcado por cambios dramáticos y com plejos. Terminó el uso de las Grandes Kivas, y aparecieron las guacamayas y la iconografía inspirada en Mesoamérica. Se argumenta que estos eventos estuvieron relacionados sistemáticamente y significan cambios observables en la economía del ritual Mimbres. La presencia de guacamayas, imágenes de guacamayas y la representación de personajes y motivos de la saga sobre los gemelos heroicos, sugieren que la ideología acompañó a las guacamayas al norte desde la costa del Golfo de México. Se reconocen y discuten episodios e iconos de la saga que fueron pintados en los cajetes de cerámica del tipo Mimbres negro sobre blanco, y se propone que las guacamayas y la narrativa llegó a Mimbres a través de adquisición directa en vez de comer cio por intermediarios. Esta investigación tiene implicaciones significativas sobre la importancia de viajar largas distancias a lugares lejanos y las interacciones con personas distantes, las relaciones entre Mesoamérica y el Sudoeste de Estados Uni dos, las prácticas religiosas cambiantes en sociedades no jerarquizadas y la adopción de elementos extrínsecos dentro de un escenario local. Archaeologists working in the Mimbres region of southwestern New Mexico (Figure 1) recognize that some of the more complicated Classic Mimbres (A.D. 1000-1130) ceramic paintings show aspects of Mimbres cosmology and worldview. Several in vestigators (Brody 2004:174-175; Hegmon and Nelson 2007; Moulard 1984:113, 115, 124; Schaafsma 1999; Shafer 1995,2003:212; Thomp son 1994, 1999a) have noted parallels between some of the Mimbres images and Mesoamerican characters and narratives in the creation saga de scribed in the Popol Vuh and other similar sources (Figures 2-10). We extend this interpretation of the paintings by linking images shared between people in Mesoamerica and the Mimbres region, and the re lated creation story, to a wider historical context within the Mimbres region. We argue that the presence of this iconography is connected to other dramatic changes at the beginning of the Classic Mimbres period that include the introduction of scarlet macaws from lowland Mesoamerica and a change in, or addition to, the religion that must Patricia A.

For perhaps a century, this new religious overlay or replacement in the Mimbres region included the Mesoamerican creation saga, using symbols re lated to the story and to scarlet macaws. A con sideration of this profound transformation in the religious belief system and the iconography on the pottery is essential for understanding the Mimbres Classic period. The explosion of Mimbres Classic representational imagery formed an iconography that is unique in the southwestern United States prior to the mid-A.D. 1100s. Our research has implications for people and places beyond the Mimbres region, especially for other investigators who are considering iconogra phy, religion, and long-distance interactions in groups with low to moderate organizational com plexity. It contributes to models of changing reli gion in non-hierarchical societies and to an un derstanding of the incorporation of foreign ideas</page><page sequence="3">92 AMERICAN and items into local settings. That is, both images and things, in this case, scarlet macaws, can travel long distances to become centerpieces of religious ritual and iconography in a short period of time. We also suggest, because of the behavioral pecu liarities of scarlet macaws, that the long-distance interaction of which they were a part did not in volve down-the-line trade, but instead involved di rect contact between people in Mesoamerica and the Mimbres region. This contact could have oc curred in the context of religious quests charac terized by travel to a center of learning, or the ac quisition, earning, or receipt of religious prerogatives. This is a rather different kind of re lationship between ancient people in the United States Southwest and Mesoamerica than previ ously posited. Such direct contact also could have occurred in the context of Mesoamericans coming north (Di Peso et al. 1974:182). Helms (1991) has made a similar argument for Panamanian and other chiefdoms, while we are developing a parallel case for a much less com plex group. At the crux of Helms's argument is that long-distance travel is often conducted to obtain esoteric knowledge and ritual/status objects that support the ownership of the knowledge rather than serving economic purposes. Using ethnographic examples, she supports her con tention that geographic distance may correlate with supernatural distance. "People who travel in geographically distant, supernaturally charged realms are engaged in a very esoteric exercise, one that marks them as distinctly different from ordinary folks" (Helms 1991:337). Much of the traveler's distinctiveness comes from ideological interpretations of travel to cosmologically pow erful regions, and thus much of it is religious in nature. Helms contends that long-distance jour neys may allow travelers to obtain efficacious religious practices. For example, initiates or shamans-in-training may travel to gain experi ences or information relevant to their new roles. If the travelers are successful, they are seen as leaders who understand the universe, who are re ligious authorities, and whose knowledge of ge ographically distant phenomena forms part of their esoteric understanding of religious-politi cal matters. Successful travelers must show con trol of this knowledge, however, and ways to do this include acquiring exotic goods, hosting for ANTIQUITY [Vol. 79, No. 1, 2014 eigners, and actively traveling to, staying in, and learning in foreign places. Following this line of thinking, Carr (2005:575) has considered the material consequences of 10 "seldom or never cited forms of possible interre gional activity" as potential explanations for the movement of materials into and between Hopewell contexts in the midwestern United States. Two of the "mechanisms" he describes— travel to a center of learning and acquisition of re ligious prerogatives (Carr 2005:581)—may be particularly applicable to the transport of macaws into the Mimbres region. The material conse quences of each of these mechanisms are similar but distinct, and although Carr dealt specifically with Hopewell interaction, we suggest that both are useful in considering the Mimbres case. Carr described the material consequences of travel to a center of learning by discussing the ma terials the "student" might bring back. These could consist of raw or finished goods and would likely have functioned as symbols of the esoteric knowl edge that the individual had gained. The source of the materials would be non-local, as would the "visible and obscure style of finished goods" (Carr 2005:581), and relatively small numbers of these materials would be present. We can think of macaws and other parrots in the Mimbres region as these "materials." They are certainly non-local and could easily have been symbols of esoteric knowl edge. If people were responsible for transporting macaws and other parrots into the Southwest from the birds' native environments, then these people may have been educated in the proper care as well as the ritual/ceremonial use of these birds, in which case macaws and other parrots could be "symbolic token(s) of esoteric knowledge" (Carr 2005:581). For the second mechanism, acquiring religious prerogatives, the material record would reflect fin ished goods functioning as ceremonial parapher nalia made from local materials but fashioned with a non-local style (Carr 2005:581). Although this mechanism does not account for the macaws, it could explain the paintings of these birds and other Mesoamerican images on Mimbres ceramics. That these same concepts may apply to people organized without the layers of statuses, social roles, and the complexities of chiefdoms and states suggests that travel to foreign and exotic places, of ten for religious purposes, and coming home with</page><page sequence="4">Giiman et al.] MESOAMERICAN ICONOGRAPHY, SCARLET MACAWS, AND GREAT KIVAS 93 Table 1.

That is, people who hope to be, or are, religious/political practitioners make long-distance journeys to gain and keep such po sitions, regardless of the kind of society. We pro pose that some people in the Mimbres region may well have made long-distance trips south into Mesoamerica, or they at least hosted people from Mesoamerica who made the trip from the south. The Mimbres Region, Chronology, Great Kivas, and Macaws and Parrots Based on the distribution of sites with predomi nantly Mimbres black-on-white pottery, the Mim bres region encompasses southwestern New Mex ico and spills over to an unknown extent into southeastern Arizona, northern Chihuahua, and across the Rio Grande to the east (Figure 1). Im mediately preceding the Classic period (A.D. 1000-1130) is a long Pithouse period (A.D. 200-1000) during which people in small villages built and inhabited pit structures, underground buildings that probably housed families or small groups of people. Great Kivas, subterranean build ings like pit structures but much larger, are present at sites in the Mimbres region during the Pithouse period, most clearly after A.D. 750 (Creel and Any on 2003). People started making Mimbres black-on-white pottery at about A.D. 800 (Table 1). The earliest painted pottery, Boldface Black on-white (also called Style I; A.D. 800/850-900/ 950; Gilman 2010:124; Shafer and Brewington 1995:12), has a few representational images, and the intermediate type, Transitional Black-on-white (Style II; A.D. 880/950-1020/1050; Shafer and Brewington 1995:13), has more pictures of ani mals and people. Neither has imagery clearly de rived from the narratives of the Mesoamerican origin story, although there are several Transi tional examples of paired fish painted on bowls that suggest the earliest references to the Hero Twins. The Mimbres Classic period is characterized by the earliest surface pueblos in the southern South west and by more people in the Mimbres Valley than during earlier times (Blake et al. 1986). The densest concentration of large (more than 100 rooms) Classic pueblos is along the Mimbres River, with at least 13 such sites in 48 km. Plazas apparently replaced Great Kivas as places of com munal rituals and performances (Anyon and LeBlanc 1980:270-272). People made Mimbres Classic Black-on-white pottery (Style III; A.D. 1000-1130) employing the same technology (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:151) as earlier painted pottery, but they used many more human and an imal figures, finer painting, and Mesoamerican-in spired iconography. The imagery that is most clearly Mesoamerican-inspired is on Classic Black-on-white ceramics. Most, if not all, of the bright multi-colored scarlet macaws, which were from much further south than thick-billed parrots and military macaws also found on Mimbres sites, were in Classic period contexts. The Classic Mimbres period thus is marked by changes in religious architecture, ritual econ omy in terms of large, red birds from a great dis tance, and ceramic imagery. Others (e.g., Brody 2004:174-175; Creel and Anyon 2003; Hegmon and Nelson 2007; Moulard 1984:113, 115, 124; Schaafsma 1999; Shafer 1995,2003:212; Thomp son 1994,1999a) have noted some of these sepa rately, but they have not suggested, as we do here, that the three changes might be related. The End of the Great Kivas People in the Mimbres region, as in other parts of the Mogollon and Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) ar eas of the United States Southwest, had built and used large subterranean structures since the early centuries of the first millennium.

Creel and Any on (2003:70) defined such structures as being more than 30 m2 in floor area. Archaeologists have as sumed that these large buildings were places where groups of people gathered for communal activities and religious rituals, and so we often call them Great Kivas. People ritually burned most Great Kivas through time (Creel and Anyon 2003:73) and re placed them with new Great Kivas. However, cul minating in the early to middle A.D. 900s (Late Pithouse period; Table 1), people very intensely burned a number of the extant Great Kivas in the Mimbres region (Creel and Anyon 2003:69, 78-79). Although some of these Great Kivas may have been replaced, by the Classic period, no Great Kivas remained (Creel and Anyon 2010:29), and there were no other large buildings in which a community could hold ceremonies. Although there are rooms large enough to hold groups of people on some Classic sites such as the NAN Ranch (Shafer 2003:80-81) and S warts (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:22), there are none the size of most Great Kivas, in which many people could have gathered for communal purposes. Not re placing the Great Kivas suggests a major change in the structure of religious spaces. There are obviously open areas between room blocks on Classic Mimbres sites, and Shafer and Drollinger (1998:384) have suggested that some of these at the NAN Ranch site were public spaces. Whether people used them for the same kinds of ac tivities as occurred in the Great Kivas is unknown. Macaws and Parrots in the Mimbres Region Archaeologists have recovered 19 macaws and thick-billed parrots (seven scarlet macaws, one military macaw, four thick-billed parrots, one macaw of indeterminate species, and six indeter minate macaws/parrots) from five or six Mim bres Late Pithouse and Classic period sites (Table 2; Creel and McKusick 1994; Wyckoff 2009). DNA from the macaw at the Cameron Creek site (Bullock and Cooper 2002:4) confirms Hargrave's (1970) identification of it as a scarlet macaw, sup porting the presence of the species in the Mimbres region. The skeletal remains of these birds are ob vious evidence of their presence and the probable interaction between people in the Mimbres region and the Mesoamerican tropics. McKusick (2001:72) has suggested that people used macaws for their first tail feathers and for sacrifice at the spring equinox.

The pit was between several large rocks and was in front of the ramp entrance on the east side of the structure. AMogollon Red-on-brown bowl (Brad field 1931:108, Plate 32, Number 110-28) was over the parrot skeleton. Mogollon Red-on-brown is the earliest painted type in the Mimbres region and dates to perhaps A.D. 750-800 or even 850 (Gilman 2010:124). People in the Mimbres re gion clearly attached importance to brightly col ored exotic birds from a relatively early time. The other Late Pithouse period bird is a newly fledged military macaw (Ara militaris) buried be neath a green stone in the floor of the latest Great Kiva (Structure 73) at the Galaz site (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:130). This Great Kiva likely dated late in the Late Pithouse period, perhaps after the early to mid A.D. 900s. The macaw was wrapped in strings of hundreds of shell and turquoise beads, and it is the most elaborate avian burial in the Mimbres region. In contrast to the two Late Pithouse period site occupations, from which a military macaw and a thick-billed parrot were recovered, scarlet macaws (Ara macao) are present in the Mimbres region only during the Classic period, after Great Kivas were no longer built. At least four and perhaps five Classic sites had a minimum of one scarlet macaw, and two sites (Galaz and Treasure Hill) had thick billed parrots (Table 2). Scarlet macaws were pre sent at Galaz, Old Town, Cameron Creek, Wind Mountain, and a possible fifth site represented by a specimen in the Osborn collection, along with five unidentified macaws or parrots from Galaz, one from Cameron Creek, and one macaw of unidenti fied species from Old Town. The Galaz site clearly stands out as having the most macaws and parrots, suggesting that this site was a focus of these brightly colored birds and perhaps associated rituals, with continuity from the Late Pithouse to the Classic pe riod. Some archaeologists (Creel 2006:42-43; Creel and Anyon 2003:69; Powell-Marti and James 2006) have suggested that the Galaz site was a preeminent one in the Mimbres Valley in terms of religious and social leadership and ritual use. This determina tion is based on its position as a ceramic exporter, but not importer, to other Classic sites, and on the 95 unique features of the Great Kivas that do not oc cur at other sites. The occurrence of so many macaws and parrots supports this contention. It is important for our argument to note that the scarlet macaws recovered from Mimbres sites are from a distant and dissimilar environment, while thick-billed parrots and military macaws had closer sources. The closest known present-day source of scarlet macaws to the Mimbres is the Huasteca region of the Mexican Gulf Coast, more than 1100 km from the Mimbres region (Wyckoff 2009:20,50,54), and, in fact, the Huastecs had a long tradition of raising macaws (Greiser 1995:508). Along the Pacific coast, this species is not found north of Oaxaca, more than 2000 km from the Mimbres region. The present extent of the military macaw habitat reaches as far north as southeastern Sonora and southwestern Chihuahua (Hoppe 1985:135) in the northernmost tier of Mexican states. There is no evidence to suggest that either macaw species ventured into the Mim bres region without human assistance. Thick-billed parrots are present in northwestern Mexico, rela tively close to the Mimbres region compared to scarlet macaws, and infrequent thick-billed parrot sightings have been reported in southeastern Ari zona (Blake 1953:192). We wonder whether peo ple used the more accessible military macaws and thick-billed parrots until obtaining scarlet macaws became more feasible during the Classic period. Although the possibility exists that ancient people bred macaws at intermediate locations and sup plied these birds to people in the Mimbres region, at present no such source is known. Punzo (2013), however, notes that in colonial times there were bird breeders among the Acaxées who lived in the Sierra Madres border area of Durango, Sinaloa, and Chihuahua, somewhat more than 700 km from the Mimbres region. Other evidence of scarlet macaws occurs on painted Classic Black-on-white bowls. We have identified 36 painted Mimbres bowls with images of macaws or parrots using the Mimbres Pottery Image Digital Database (MimPIDD), a photo graphic archive of more than 10,000 whole or partial vessels from the Mimbres region. We refer to each individual piece of pottery in the MimPIDD by its unique Mimbres Archive (MA) numbers. The Mimbres Archive was the non-elec tronic predecessor to the MimPIDD.

On three other bowls (MA 1608, 4393, and 5496; Figure 2), the birds' tail feathers are represented by a series of long parallel lines. Be cause a fledged macaw's tail feathers are more than half its total length, these appear to depict fledged macaws and not other parrots (Wyckoff 2009:15). However, in several instances the birds are drawn in silhouette, without clear species distinctions, and with short pointed tails. Given that in archaeologi cal contexts during the Classic Mimbres period and throughout the southwestern United States other parrots are found in significantly lower frequencies than macaws (Rizo 1998:Appendices I and II; Wyckoff 2009:38), the representation of these par rots in silhouette may carry a more general refer ence to exotic, brightly colored birds or to the care and interaction they required.

Therefore, it is likely that parrots and macaws are not depicted on bowls before the Classic period, and perhaps not even before the Middle Classic. In sum, during the Classic period, people in the Mimbres region were apparently obtaining scarlet macaws from the tropics of the Huasteca region on the east coast of Mexico, at least 1100 km from the Mimbres. These exotic and brightly colored birds appear in the archaeological record, both in the form of skeletal remains and in painted images on pottery, at about the time when people ceased building and maintaining the Great Kivas. Shared Iconography and Ideology: Mimbres and Mesoamerica We address two issues here that pertain to shared Mimbres and Mesoamerican iconography. The first is the presence of shared imagery on Mim bres painted pottery, specifically images and nar ratives from the Hero Twins saga. Given this presence, the second issue is when the specific Hero Twins imagery appeared on Mimbres ves sels. We will use this analysis to evaluate the likelihood that these symbols and related ritual procedures came north to the Mimbres region with the scarlet macaws in the Classic period. We note that present-day interpretations of Mim bres images may not be related to how ancient people in the Mimbres region understood those pictures. However, we make the case that we can indeed recognize episodes and characters from the Hero Twins saga in the paintings. What those meant to people in the past and how those mean ings might have changed through time are more difficult issues that we do not address. Thompson (1994, 1999a, 1999b, 2006, 2007, 2008; Thompson and Brown 2006; Thompson et al. 2006) has extensively examined Mimbres im ages and has shown that some figures and actions in narrative scenes on Mimbres pottery have par allels to the Hero Twins saga, as narrated in the Popol Vuh (Tedlock 1985)—an important written description of Mesoamerican cosmology and re ligion from the Maya region—and as illustrated in and on Classic Maya (A.D. 250-900) media such as ceramics. The Popol Vuh recounts the Maya ori gin story, including the Hero Twins' miraculous birth, epic adventures, and reincarnations as the sun and the moon (Thompson 1994, 1999a). The Twins are tricksters who vanquished monsters and willingly suffered death. They reappeared after death as fishmen, and so fish are symbols for life after death and for passage of the souls of the dead through the watery Underworld. Fish are powerful and multivalent metaphors for the twins, death, and the Underworld. We use Thompson's research to demonstrate here that Mimbres painters depicted images and narratives from the Hero Twins saga on Classic Mimbres Black-on-white bowls. Because the saga is complex and has many components, we focus on four prominent motifs that are part of the Hero Twins saga in the Popol Vuh (Tedlock 1985: 89-160), including identifying the Hero Twins themselves, the Twins as fish, the monster Seven Macaw, and his first son Zipakna. We then use a bowl painting to show a narrative of the Hero Twins and many of the symbols associated with them. As we will support with evidence below, these images appear exclusively on Classic Mim bres pottery, particularly bowls, making them con temporary with the presence of scarlet macaws in the Mimbres region. Such figures also occur in Mimbres rock art (Rice 2010; Schaafsma 1980:199-242), but for simplicity's sake we are using only pottery images for this analysis. Classic Mimbres Black-on-white pottery stands out from other contemporary pottery and indeed from much of the later pottery in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico because of the high proportion of representational animal and human designs (Figure 2). Representational im Figure 2.

Figure from a Classic Mimbres Black-on-white howl depicting the Hero Twins. The elder masculine twin on the right is larger and wears a male sash tied in front. His right arm is larger, denoting his right-handedness. The younger effeminate twin on the left is smaller, wears a white shift and a female sash with fringe at the back.

The elder right-handed twin is on the left, distin guished by larger body size and a larger, presumably right arm.

The propor tion of representational images exploded in the Classic period, starting around A.D. 1000, al though we do not yet know whether this is related to the presence of Hero Twins iconography. We searched the MimPIDD for all representational bowls. The MimPIDD allows searches for differ ent kinds of vessels, such as representational or geometric, as well as searches by time period, type, and many other characteristics. Rough counts of the vessels in MimPIDD suggest that about 6 percent (19 of 301) of Boldface Black-on-white, 13 percent of Transitional (152 of 1185), and 38 percent of Classic (2763 of 7340) are representa tional. This almost certainly denotes the increas ing importance of painting and displaying repre sentational images. Identifying the Hero Twins. In prehistoric me dia from various cultures and time periods, in cluding the historic Popol Vuh, it is apparent that the older twin is depicted as larger than the younger twin, right-handed, and masculine. Al though the sun and deer symbolize him, deer and pronghorns often denote both twins, since these animals often bear twins. The younger twin is smaller, left-handed, often has a feminine guise, and the moon and rabbits are his symbols. He is often shown facing left, as are many rabbits, in cluding the "rabbit in the moon" that many Native American groups recognize (see Thompson 1994 for side by side illustrations of the rabbit in the moon, Mimbres and Maya rabbits, the younger twin with rabbit features, Classic Mimbres and Classic Maya Seven Macaw images with the younger twin, and twinned fish). There are numerous depictions of the Hero Twins on Classic Black-on-white bowls, more than 30 in the first 6000 bowls in the MimPIDD. We illustrate Mimbres interpretations of the Hero Twins with two Mimbres bowls, MA 198 (Figure 3) and MA 1605 (Figure 4). The specificity of the images on these bowls should suffice to show that these are paintings of the Hero Twins. On MAI 98, the elder twin is on the right, and he is slightly larger and has a larger right arm. He wears a male sash tied in front that distinguishes him from his brother as in MA7958 (Moulard 1984:Figure 16) and MA1604 (Brody 2004:Figure 31). The younger twin, on the left, is a bit smaller, has a larger left arm, and is wearing a string apron, which Munson (2000:131) notes that only women pictured on Mimbres bowls wear. In addition to the string apron, the younger twin wears a shift in dicative of female attire. The Hero Twins as Fish. In MA 1605 (Figure 4), the elder twin is shown as larger and with a larger right arm, while the younger twin is smaller with a larger left arm. Although the latter twin may</page><page sequence="10">Gilman et al.] MESOAMERICAN ICONOGRAPHY, SCARLET MACAWS, AND GREAT KIVAS 99 be smaller because he is painted in the back ground, this does not negate the fact that he has a larger left arm, and that this scene refers to a spe cific part of the Hero Twins saga. The large an thropomorphized catfish in this scene refers to the fishmen episode of that saga. Here, the twins have willingly suffered death by immolation, but they have left instructions that their bones should be ground and cast into a Stygian stream. This is done, "and on the fifth day they reappeared. They were seen in the water ... the two of them had the appearance of channel catfish when their faces were seen" (Tedlock 1985:149). This provides the metaphorical model for fish representing souls of the dead, the defeat of death, the possibility of life after death, and successful passage through the wa tery Underworld. In this episode, the twins as cat fish are transformed into vagabonds, and this is likely what is depicted on this bowl. Thus, not only does MA 1605 show the Hero Twins with some of their appropriate characteristics, but it also por trays part of the Hero Twins saga. Seven Macaw. In the Hero Twins saga, Seven Macaw is a giant monster. In Mimbres iconogra phy, he is often depicted as a bear or a bird-like creature. He tears off the left arm of the elder twin in a failed attempt to kill him. Subsequently, the twins defeat the monster, and he dies after his teeth and eyes are removed through trickery. The elder brother's arm is later retrieved and reattached. To demonstrate that Seven Macaw and the in cident involving the severed arm are depicted on Mimbres Classic bowls (Thompson 1994:99), we use two bowls. On one (MA811; Figure 5), a bear is shown with a severed human arm, and on the second (MAI 199; Figure 6) the younger twin is on the back of a monstrous bird in the process of re trieving his brother's arm, which is near the bird's beak. Classic Mimbres bowls (MA2702; Figure 7) also show the interaction between Seven Macaw depicted as a bear and a human figure that is likely the younger twin, especially since the person has his fingers near the bear's eyes. Thus, parts of the Hero Twins saga narrative are directly inter pretable from the Mimbres paintings. There is lit tle subtlety here. Zipakna, Seven Macaw's First Son. Zipakna, the first son of Seven Macaw, is depicted in two contexts in Classic Mimbres bowls. In one (MA2459; Figure 8), he is shown moving moun Figure 5. Figure from a Classic Mimbres Black-on-white bowl with the monster, Seven Macaw, shown as a bear and with the elder twin's disarticulated arm near its mouth (MA811; Baca site; Evans et al. 1985:268). Figure 6.

In others, he appears as a large, white being with a globular body in the bottom of a hole (MA 1488; Figure 9). These refer to the first attempt to kill him with a post after enticing him Figure 5.

He realized he was to be killed, so he dug a separate hole to one side, he dug a hole for safety" (Tedlock 1985:95). A Hero Twins Narrative. In terms of the images representing the Hero Twins saga, the narrative and reiterative qualities of the scenes on some Mimbres bowls are astounding. Many of these motifs can be ordered to follow the narrative se quence of the Hero Twins saga from their birth, through their various exploits, and to their death and reincarnations as the sun and the moon (Thompson 1994, 1999a). Although we have examined specific images above, we now consider a narrative painting com bining several images, because this again depicts specifics of the Hero Twins saga. One vessel (MA7974; Figure 10) is emblematic of this style of narrative painting. Here, the center of the bowl is dominated by the elder, larger, right-handed twin. His right hand grasps a linear element at tached to the head of a deer, symbolizing through analogy his association and role with the mascu line avatar of the sun. In his left hand he holds a bow, an arrow, and a crooked stick. On his back is a quiver full of arrows made of animal hide with a tail. These also identify him as one of the Hero Twins. Additionally, this twin wears a headdress comprised of the neck and head of the Bird of Doom with a four-legged fish at its throat. This Bird of Doom icon is not described in the Popol Vuh, but it is illustrated on Maya, Mimbres, and Hohokam ceramics and in other and later media between the fifth and the twelfth centuries (Thompson 2008). The chimeric Bird of Doom (Thompson 2008) consumes souls of the dead, represented by fish in the watery Underworld. The avian headdress on the elder twin is similar to those depicted on ancient Maya ballplayers (e.g., Scarborough and Wilcox 1999:Figures 8.1, 14.1, 14.8; Whittington 2001 :Figures 87, 106,107). Be low the feet of the elder twin are the heads of sim ilar but not identical pronghorns, symbols of the twins. The younger, diminutive, left-handed twin is depicted to the right and above the elder twin. At the end of his left arm is the head of a rabbit, em blematic of his association as avatar of the moon and conceived of as feminine. His right hand grasps the apparent stubs of hind legs on the Figure 8.

Like the heads of the pronghorns, the younger twin's facial and body markings are similar to, but distinct from, those on the elder twin. Figure 8.

They are rendered in dynamic but ungrounded postures, are lateralized to the left, and are depicted individually with deer or rabbit elements. The younger twin follows the elder twin as night fol lows day, moon follows sun, and death follows life. Above all, they personify divine dualities: male and female, right and left, light and dark, large and small. These are not dichotomous nu mina, but instead they combine balanced halves of a whole. Although the reiteration and narration are eso teric in the painting on the above bowl, they ap proach redundancy, leaving little question of which twin is which, which episode in the saga is alluded to, and at what point in the narrative sequence the twins are represented. Based on this scene, it ap pears the twins have defeated death, represented metaphorically by the Bird of Doom headdress, and they are about to achieve their apotheosis as the sun and moon, symbolized by the deer and rabbit heads. Taken together, the elements, icons, and mo tifs suggest the end of the twins' saga. Timing of the Shared Imagery. The shared im agery from the Hero Twins saga we examined above is different from the images that may form an earlier and likely continuous shared ideology throughout much of the Southwest and Mesoamer ica. From as early as perhaps A.D. 800, when people in the Mimbres region began painting black-on-white pottery and representational im agery, they shared similarities in pottery designs and rock art motifs with the Hohokam (Hegmon and Nelson 2007; LeBlanc 1983:77-78; Shafer 2003:7-8) and Mesoamerican cultures (Thompson 2006). For example, Venus glyphs (Thomp son 1999a, 2006), which are crosses with arms of equal lengths, and Birds of Doom (Thompson 2008), composed of elements of different aquatic birds and which consume souls of the dead (Fig ure 10), were common to all three areas (Thomp son 1999a). The Knife-wing icon, which is a bird figure with extended wings, wings or wing feath ers depicted as knives, a body in ventral-facing po sition, and, often, anthropomorphic features, is represented in both Mesoamerica and the South west (Kelley 1964; Thompson 1999b). Just these few images suggest that common symbols were in place by the time people in the Mimbres region be 101 gan painting Boldface Black-on-white pottery. It seems apparent that people in both the Mimbres and Hohokam regions participated in a similar cosmosphere as people in Mesoamerica (Shafer 1995; Thompson 1999a), although certainly the symbols may not have represented the same ideas or ideologies in all places. Although images on Boldface Black-on-white pottery include Knife-wing icons (Thompson 1999b), duality, and Venus glyphs, there is little specific to the Hero Twins saga. For example, of the 19 Boldface Black-on-white whole vessels with representational images, two have Knife wing icons (MA572 and 9539), three show dual ity (MA1731, 5127, and 9539), and three have Venus glyphs (MA2262, 5997, and 6505). There are also two bowls with quadrupeds (MA5997 and 9706) that may be pronghorn or deer. The best dates for this pottery may overlap with the pres ence of the thick-billed parrot at the Cameron Creek site, although the parrot was associated with an earlier Mogollon Red-on-brown bowl. Sometime in the range of A.D. 750-850, then, people in the Mimbres region had obtained at least one brightly colored bird, had changed their pottery paint colors to black-on-white (perhaps for maximum design visibility), and were using symbols on their pottery that were shared across a wide area. In examining Transitional Black-on-white rep resentational images, we found that none met the visual requirements noted above for the Hero Twins, Seven Macaw, or Zipakna, although there are 10 examples of twinned fish (MA521, 2490, 2664, 2901, 3888, 5864, 8214, 8414, 8759, and possibly 9009), which may be the earliest refer ences to the Hero Twins. There are three rabbits, but MA5978/6234 is probably better typed as Early Classic and MA8960 may have been re painted. If the latter is correct, it would make the sample of rabbit bowls only two, but if it is not a forgery, then it could also be classified as Classic. Unlike these two, the one certain Transitional rab bit bowl (MA9073) has only one rabbit accompa nied by Knife-wing. There are almost 30 depic tions of Knife-wing and three possible Venus glyphs, although we did not search all Transi tional bowls for the latter. Aside from twinned fish, there is little on Transitional bowls that could represent the Hero Twins saga. MESOAMERICAN ICONOGRAPHY, SCARLET MACAWS, AND GREAT KIVAS</page><page sequence="13">102 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 79, No. 1, 2014 In the Classic period, as we noted above, the proportion of vessels with representational im agery exploded, being triple the proportion on Transitional Black-on-white pottery. The narra tive quality of the images also increased, and we can associate many with characters and episodes from the Hero Twins saga. As people in the Mim bres region wanted and found better access to scarlet macaws, we posit that they started ma nipulating the accompanying symbols and rituals to form a new or at least an expanded version of their religion. Our examination of the representational im ages from Boldface, Transitional, and Classic pot tery suggests that images on the earlier two pottery types were mostly those shared across wide re gions of the Southwest and Mesoamerica. The earliest images of the Hero Twins may be seen during the time that Transitional designs were painted (A. D. 880/950-1020/1050). Representa tional painting and the Hero Twins icons and nar ratives are all far more common on Classic Mim bres bowls than they were earlier, and we suggest that it is no coincidence that these occurred at the same time that people in the Mimbres region started to obtain scarlet macaws and presumably the care instructions and rituals that accompanied proper use of these birds. Thus, we have reiterated that images and nar ratives from the Hero Twins saga were painted on Mimbres pottery. The paintings that are unmis takably related to the saga appear only on Classic Black-on-white bowls, and this timing fits well with the first appearance of scarlet macaws during the Classic period. Red Tail Feathers and Esoteric Knowledge How did Mesoamerican macaws, ideology, and the Hero Twins mythology reach the Mimbres re gion of southwestern New Mexico? Due to the ap parent difficulties of transporting young macaws, discussed below, it is parsimonious to suggest that individuals to whom the macaws were accustomed took the birds the entire distance from their homes in Mesoamerica to the Mimbres pueblos. The northeastern Mexican Gulf Coast area, called La Huasteca, was occupied by Mayan speakers and is a natural habitat of scarlet macaws and the closest natural scarlet macaw source to the Mimbres region (Thompson and Brown 2006:94). It is possible that the Hero Twins ideology and mythology came from the same source as the macaws, and that the practical and esoteric knowl edge necessary for the care and ritual use of macaws accompanied them north. In this section, we first discuss macaws and their care to show that the presence of scarlet macaws in the Mimbres re gion was not likely the result of down-the-line trade. Then, we consider a model of religious quests that would account for the presence of scar let macaws in the Mimbres region. Macaws and Their Care. In the northern hemi sphere, scarlet and military macaws breed in early spring. They nest in tree hollows and lay one to four eggs in March and one or more hatch in early April. Newly hatched macaws are defenseless, and juvenile macaws usually stay with their par ents for at least two years. These parrots are fairly easy to breed and raise in captivity, although new borns must be fed about one cc of food 16 times a day. These birds' body temperature is 104.9 de grees, and the food for newly hatched young must be this temperature. In captivity, it is practical for the mother to nurture and feed newborns for about three months until they become fledglings. Hand fed hatchlings have lower body weight than those fed by their mothers (Michele Kemp, macaw breeder, personal communication 2010). "The birds are not ready for a change of environments when they are being hand fed. They are used to their hand feeder's technique, and it is impossible for any two people to hand feed the same bird" (Abramson 1995:80). Young macaws tend to form individual human attachments, and they usually become quite sociable compared with adult birds captured in the wild. The latter may never ac commodate humans, and they can become very aggressive (Greiser 1995:497). At four months of age, immature birds can eat about 35 cc once a day. Between six and eight months, the birds can fly and perch. Between 11 and 12 months, their first or "virgin" red tail feathers are fully grown (Michele Kemp, personal communication 2010). The birds continue to grow until 18 months old and reach reproductive maturity at two-and-a-half to four years (Abramson and Thomsen 1995:7). Creel and McKusick (1994:517) have sug gested that exotic macaws may have arrived in the Mimbres region via down-the-line trade, noting</page><page sequence="14">Gilman et a!.] that "it is possible that the birds were acquired or passed along through a series of exchanges." How ever, it seems unlikely that people in the south western United States would have obtained macaws in this way, since they require specialized care, especially hand feeding and bonding with in dividual handlers. The care and nurturing of juve nile scarlet macaws would have been a burden of responsibility requiring specialized knowledge, training, and experience, especially for trans portation away from their natural environment. Bringing adult macaws north would have been an unenviable task because of the birds' aggressive temperament toward those to whom they are un accustomed, and people likely brought young macaws instead. As noted above, people in intermediate areas may have been raising macaws outside their nat ural habitat and were likely doing so during colo nial times. People from the Mimbres region could have obtained such birds, but prehistoric evidence for this does not exist at present. Unlike at the later site of Paquimé to the south in Chihuahua, there is virtually no evidence of macaw husbandry in the Mimbres region, and so people likely transported live birds north (Creel and McKusick 1994:517). Not Down-the-Line Trade. If people transported scarlet macaws north, then why and how did this happen? Scarlet macaws, brilliantly colored birds from a distant place, fit well into the sort of item that Helms (1991) suggests people sought on their journeys to faraway lands. The macaws would function as symbols of the trip, the connection with the supernatural that such trips have, the con trol over such powerful journeys and items, and, therefore, the leadership qualities of the person who obtained and held a scarlet macaw. Follow ing Carr (2005:581), we further suggest the pos sibility that Mimbres individuals may have nego tiated for the acquisition of macaws and other parrots as "ceremonial paraphernalia," or were given them because they had demonstrated their commitment to religious practice and thus merited such a gift. Although we cannot demonstrate that the two are directly related, we speculate that the presence and role of Hero Twins iconography shared with Mesoamerica and painted on the Clas sic Black-on-white bowls may relate to the macaws themselves, in that this iconography was perhaps important in the ritual care of these birds. 103 That is, maybe one could not have a scarlet macaw without knowing and using at least part of the Hero Twins saga. In answer to the how question, as we have ad dressed above, biological and behavioral restric tions would have dictated the manner in which these birds were moved. We know virtually noth ing of how the macaws came north, except for one tantalizing bit of information. DNA analysis of two women from the NAN Ranch site in the Mimbres Valley suggests that the DNA of one of them was similar to five modern Tarahumara samples from northern Mexico, and the DNA of the other was similar to eight modern samples from the Cora, Huichol, and Nahua Atocpan farther south (Snow et al. 2011:3131-3132). The burial of the second woman is between A.D. 940-1010, just before the beginning of the Classic period, while the bur ial of the first woman dates to A.D. 1120-1140 or later, which is the very late end of the Classic. That is, the women were not contemporaries, and their presence hints at continuing movement through the Classic period. It also suggests that people in the Mimbres region hosted these women from far away, which, as Helms (1991:342) notes, is an ex pression of leadership abilities and knowledge, or that the women came north with people from the Mimbres region on their own journeys to distant places. These women came from northern Mexico, though, and not from the Gulf Coast, the homeland of the scarlet macaws, and so they may not have been involved with the movement of the macaws. Their presence does, however, show that women made long-distance journeys. It is interesting that both of these people are women. Munson (2000:138-140) has analyzed gender roles as depicted on Classic Mimbres bowls, and she has concluded that the majority of the people associated with parrots on the bowls are women. She suggested that some women, per haps from particular sites and families, may have held relatively high standing because of their in volvement with parrots and their possession of the esoteric knowledge accompanying the par rots. Greiser (1995:501) stated that "knowing that macaws bond with individuals and often act ag gressively toward people of the sex opposite their handler, it would be unlikely that men were trans porting these birds over long distances... if women were their handlers." In 1569 in the Florentine MESOAMERICAN ICONOGRAPHY, SCARLET MACAWS, AND GREAT KIVAS</page><page sequence="15">104 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 79, No. 1, 2014 Codex, Sahagún (Dibble and Anderson 1961:92), describing sixteenth century Aztec feather work ing, observed that "The feather seller [is] a bird owner. She raises birds; she plucks them. She plucks feathers; she treats them with chalk. She plucks feathers from the back and the breast; she peels downy feathers." Although we certainly can not demonstrate that women were the main scar let macaw transporters and handlers, it is an in triguing possibility. Why did those receiving the macaws want them in the first place? We propose here that the macaws were part of religious quests and the re organized or augmented religion in the Mimbres region during the Classic period. Following Helms (1991), people may have been seeking esoteric goods (scarlet macaws) and knowledge (Hero Twins saga/religious use of macaws). In the process of obtaining the scarlet macaws for trans port, they gained practical and esoteric knowl edge necessary to care for the macaws. The two were possibly part of the same whole. As an aside, we point out that this model solves the problem of what was traded in return for the macaws, be cause the answer now can be "not necessarily anything." Indeed, there is a Hopi story of Tiyo (Hopkins 2012), a youth who in the distant past traveled far to the south into Mesoamerica and South America, returning to Hopi with ritual knowledge of the snake dance and a Snake Maiden wife. The snake dance is an important rain-making ceremony, and Tiyo's travels are part of the history and sacred knowledge of the Rattlesnake Clan. Important for our argument, Tiyo obtained religious preroga tives from a distant place, perhaps even more dis tant than we are proposing, and brought them home to be incorporated into local religious prac tices. In other words, the Hopi recognize the im portance of travel to distant lands and bringing home a ceremony that they incorporated into their religion, rituals, and culture. One cannot ignore the possible impact of per sonal agency in such a situation. That is, someone went to the Gulf Coast of Mexico, or someone from the Gulf Coast traveled to Mimbres, bring ing macaws, ideology, and ritual. What might peo ple in the Mimbres region have gained from these replacements of, or additions to, their ritual econ omy beyond association with exotic powers to the south? In contrast perhaps to contemporary Chaco Canyon to the north, no one in the Mimbres region had obvious power (Gilman 1990, 2007; Shafer 2003:105-107). Munson (2000:140), citing Brandt (1994:15), notes that ceremonial property ownership and the knowledge accompanying it is "the fundamental basis for social ranking in Puebloan societies." Did some people in the Mimbres region have a concealed ritual power that came with their trip(s) to obtain scarlet macaws (if indeed they made such trips) and the religious knowledge that ac companied their use or possession of macaws? Helms's (1991) research has suggested that ritual power would be a reason to make such trips and to obtain items like scarlet macaws. Information from the Mimbres region indicates the possibility that some people there made trips to gain religious power. For example, scarlet macaws are present at some sites but not others that have been equally and thoroughly excavated (Creel and McKusick 1994:521). When provenience is known (Galaz, Cameron Creek, and Old Town), the macaw buri als are all in the northern part of the sites (Creel and McKusick 1994:519), but only the southern Galaz site had bowls with macaws painted on them (Creel and McKusick 1994:519-520). Clearly, not everyone had a scarlet macaw or ac cess to one, nor did people at all sites have macaws. As well, not everyone painted macaws on bowls, and not everyone had the practical and rit ual knowledge to handle macaws. Summary and Implications The iconography on Classic period pottery is unique, and the Mimbres region is the only place in the southwestern United States prior to the mid A.D. 1100s where such a creative explosion of iconography occurs. The change in, or perhaps ad dition to, the Great Kiva religion was abrupt, unique in the southwestern United States, and highly visi ble. During the Mimbres Classic period, the society was insular (Minnis 1985), much more so than dur ing preclassic and postclassic times. This was per haps the result of people in the region suddenly in corporating a unique aspect of religion. We see relationships between the appearance of scarlet macaws and Mesoamerican iconography painted on pottery during the Classic Mimbres</page><page sequence="16">Gilman et al.] MESOAMERICAN ICONOGRAPHY, SCARLET MACAWS, AND GREAT KIVAS 105 period, and we suggest that these could be con nected to the collapse or diminution of the Great Kiva religion in the Mimbres drainage during the A.D. 900s and the replacement or synthesis of this religion with one that included scarlet macaws and symbols from the Hero Twins saga shared with Mesoamerica. Clearly, though, people in the Mimbres region made the new ritual economy fit their needs and wishes in that not all symbols on Mimbres bowls are apparently Mesoamerican, and the style in which the narrative imagery is de picted is clearly Mimbres. We propose that, beginning in about the sec ond millennium A.D., people, possibly including both women and men, made journeys of about 1100 km each way to or from the Huasteca region on Mexico's Gulf Coast to transport scarlet macaws necessary for equinoctial rituals, sacri fice, and the distribution of red feathers tied to re ligious practices and ultimately horticultural suc cess. While it is possible that people from the Huasteca region came north with the macaws and practical and ritual knowledge, it is unclear what they would have gained from such a dan gerous trip. The advantages to people from the Mimbres region are more obvious— ritual power and the accompanying social standing, and bet ter control over the elements with a new religion or new rituals added to their continuing religion. Some, such as Helms (1991), have suggested that people in search of ritual and political stand ing in chiefdoms made long distance trips for these reasons, and she indicates that people in less complexly organized groups may have done the same. The Mimbres case supports her argu ment for the latter. Munson (2000:137) suggests that, given their association with burdens and burden baskets on Classic Black-on-white pot tery, women were involved with long-distance trade. Along with the other possibilities that we have cited regarding the role of women, this makes us wonder whether Mimbres women, per haps in the company of men, made these macaw trips. If so, this has interesting implications for women's possible quests for ritual and political knowledge and for their position in societies such as those in the Mimbres region. This explanation for the presence of scarlet macaw images on Mimbres pottery and bird buri als at Mimbres sites suggests that some people in the Mimbres Valley became involved in macaw acquisition and use as active participants, rather than as passive recipients, of exotic goods and ritual practices. Perhaps the Mesoamerican/South west economic trade paradigm and the concept of Mesoamerican "influence" are thus off the mark. Based on the data and interpretations presented here, acquisition of specialized precious goods and ideological concepts may have been the goal (Carr 2005:575; Helms 1991), rather than trade. In addition, if people from the Mimbres region or anywhere in the United States Southwest went south on trips to acquire macaws and the rituals as sociated with their use, they sought Mesoamerican "influence" for their own benefit. The influence thus may not have originated in the purposes of people living in Mesoamerica, and it might not have come from the down-the-line trade of goods and ideas. This may speak to ways in which reli gion might change in non-hierarchical societies and how and why people incorporate foreign ele ments into local settings. That is, such a situation may not require many new people or even many items from exotic settings, but instead the local people may act to obtain the goods and esoteric knowledge that they perceive as useful or neces sary. Therefore, there should be (and is in the Mimbres case) much continuity with the past. Thus, in terms of contexts other than the Clas sic Mimbres period, we note that what might ap pear to be trade is, rather, the long-distance ac quisition of exotic goods and knowledge likely for the purposes of those doing the obtaining. This is a far cry from trade or influence, and it casts the interactions between people in the Southwest and Mesoamerica in a completely new light. Acknowledgments.
