EDWARD MOSELEY and LUIS WATANABE Cupisnique on early the centuries north art, the of coast art the of of first the Peru millennium peoples during living the Cupisnique on the north coast of Peru during the early centuries of the first millennium b.c., shares certain motifs and canons with the art- work of the famous site of Chavín de Huántar in the Peruvian Andes. The similarities are most ap- parent in decorated pottery made for special pur- poses, such as funerary accompaniments and vo- tive offerings. Archaeologists once took the like- nesses in the ceramics of the two regions to mean that Cupisnique ware was simply a peripheral, coastal manifestation of highland Chaván style. Continuing investigation, however, has under- scored the independent status of Cupisnique art and culture. Increased information about Cupisnique art has made it possible to recognize distinct but in- terrelated centers of influence in different coastal areas. While these centers participated in the broader and more formal aspects of the style, they developed themes and expressions uniquely their own. The recently discovered Caballo Muerto complex, where Cupisnique art manifested itself in abode friezes, was one such center of local in- fluence. Caballo Muerto is situated on the north side of the Moche Valley near the edge of the desert some twenty kilometers inland from the sea. The complex contains eight platform mounds or trun- cated pyramids and their attendant structures spaced over an area of 1.5 square kilometers and connected, in part, by a series of megalithic walls. Though some of the buildings may have been constructed and used at different times, an early dating has been confirmed for all the principal platforms. The size of the complex makes it one of the larger corporate labor construction proj- ects known to have been undertaken in the An- dean area during the early part of the first mil- lennium B.C. The Huaca de los Reyes, or "Shrine of the Kings," is the best-preserved structure within the Caballo Muerto complex. A preliminary program of surveying, mapping and excavation was car- ried out at the huaca in April, 1972, by the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project, and it revealed that the building is basically U-shaped in plan. A cen- tral platform rises in a series of ascending tiers, and two wing structures, projecting from each side of this principal mound, flank a spacious court which opens to the east. The entire struc- ture displays the following modular components: U-shaped platforms with central stairs; colon- nades with rectangular pillars; semi-sunken rec- tangular courts; and rectangular rooms with single or multiple doorways. 155</page><page sequence="3">The east façade of the principal platform showing the frieze of area 1 . The primary construction materials used in the Huaca de los Reyes were river cobbles set in mud mortar. Wall faces were finished with thick coats of adobe plaster. Excavation showed ample evi- dence of remodeling and reconstruction, and the huaca was undoubtedly built in stages. There are three classes of abode sculptures at Huaca de los Reyes: massive heads, standing bi- pedal figures and zoomorphic figures. We found reliefs in five different places in the building, and the examples would probably have increased in number with more extensive excavation. Area 1 designates the north section of the main façade of the central platform. Here a row of three mas- sive heads which were labeled A, B and G, from north to south came to light. Presumably, on the southern side of the platform there are counter- part heads which remain as yet ünexcavated. Area 2 consists of the entry colonnade to the main platform; there standing bipedal figures ornament the two northern pillars and the side panel of the colonnade. Again, balancing friezes are probably present in the entry's unexcavated southern sector. Area 3 is the entry colonnade to the summit of the principal platform. Standing figures decorated the north and south side panels of the entry structure. Stylized zoomorphic motifs were found in two niches in area 4, the southern portion of the façade at the summit of the prin- cipal platform. Area 5, some distance off, is the eastern side panel of the entry colonnade of the south wing. Here we discovered a standing figure. A balancing frieze is very likely present on the unexcavated western panel of the entry. l he three massive heads of area 1 are set in large niches averaging 60 centimeters in depth, 220 centimeters in width and more than 130 centimeters in height. They lie approximately 170 centimeters from one another. The tops, both of the niches and of the heads, have been de- stroyed by erosion. All three heads, rendered in high relief employing both curvilinear and recti- linear forms, are depicted in frontal view and tend to be rectangular in outline. Head A, the best preserved, has oval eyes with a circular pupil set near the top of the sclera, slightly toward the center of the face as if to indicate an upward gaze. The upper eyelid extends over the top and down each side of the eye in an accentuated man- ner suggesting extreme epicanthic folds. A platyr- rhine nose with deep, circular nostrils occupies the center of the face. The nostrils are somewhat below eye level, where a high-relief band runs along each side of the face. The form and posi- tion of these bands suggest that they represent ears. A curving incised line seems to run from the top of the mouth to the exterior corner of the eye. Thick lips outline the mouth, which is de- picted as partially open with down-turned round- ed corners. Upper and lower teeth are visible. In each row, the two central teeth which are more or less square in form, may correspond to incisors. Two large rectangles symbolizing interlocked fe- line-like canines flank the incisors and overlap both the upper and lower rows of teeth; they do not cross the lips. Three teeth are depicted in the corners of the mouth, two in the upper row and one in the lower row. These tend to be rectangu- 156</page><page sequence="4">Huaca de los Reyes and the areas with excavated friezes. lar with rounded corners and probably represent molars. A »large rectangular depression which con- tains an incised V set on its side is in the center of the chin. It may symbolize a labret or an open- ing for a labret. Parts of head A still carry faint vestiges of red and white pigment; traces of red, perhaps painted over a white base, are present on the canines, lips and cheeks. Head B differs somewhat from head A. The corners of the mouth open upward as well as downward, and the lips are thus shaped as if in a grimace. The added space in each corner of the 157</page><page sequence="5">"Labret" of massive head B. On each side of the central band are two schematic heads with stylized eyes, mouths and teeth. The east façade of the principal platform showing the frieze of area 2. mouth contains an additional lower molar. The "labret" is formed by a raised horizontal band divided in half at the midpoint. Head B has traces of white pigment on the molar teeth, and red on the canines and lips. Head C resembles head A. The main variation is the labret which contains a diagonal slash set within a depressed rectangle. No pigment remains on this sculpture. These massive heads represent a unique com- bination of stylized anthropomorphic features and feline motifs, specifically the interlocked ca- nines (a common element in Gupisnique and Chavin art). Although certain of the motifs ap- pear in other examples of Gupisnique art, the combination found here is not duplicated else- where in the Andean area. The heads share general features with several friezes found 250 kilometers to the south at Huaca Moxeke in the Gasma Valley. Here in 1937 Julio C. Tello ex- posed a series of early, high-relief sculptures. Two were massive anthropomorphic heads set in large niches; these, however, lack the feline dentition characteristic of the Huaca de los Reyes speci- mens, and they differ in other details. But there are sufficient similarities to suggest that, during Gupisnique times, the decoration of walls with sculptures consisting of massive heads set in large niches may have been a fairly widespread practice on the north coast of Peru. Unfortu- nately, the rain and a major earthquake have destroyed the Moxeke figures. Thus, the massive heads of Huaca de los Reyes are the only extant examples of this early class of wall decoration. -1 he excavations unearthed a total of six reliefs depicting standing, man-like figures. Each of these friezes is composed of two parts, the figure itself and a thick border ornamented with zoo- morphic motifs. For convenience we shall first discuss the standing figures, and then the borders. The standing figures are set in shallow panels decorating the frönt pillars and side walls of main entry colonnades (areas 2, 3 and 5). The figures always face the central plaza of the site. Surfaces not facing the plaza were left undecorated; this is the case, for example, with interior pillars of the colonnades. The tops of the figures have been destroyed by erosion, and much of their original nature remains unknown. The frieze in area 5 is the most complete. The principal individual, a stylized anthropomorphic being, depicted head-on, stands fully erect, legs slightly apart, feet forward, right hand down at his side. His feet seem to be covered by short boots or footgear; a wrap or garment crosses his body at midsection. The figures in area 2 are basically the same. To the left of the northern- most figure, at about knee level is a poorly pre- served motif, the clearest aspect of which is a small, deep circular depression that perhaps repre- sents an eye. It may belong to a downward looking serpent's head of a type sometimes used to orna- ment the ends of hair strands or garment tassels in Gupisnique art. The standing figures in area 3 are somewhat different. They are executed in a low relief that verges on incision. The four toes on the feet of these figures are depicted, rather oddly, in vertical rows, and at the base of each leg there is a wide band where the leg joins the foot. The feet of the figure on the north side of the colon- nade turn outward, while the one on the south has inturned feet. Standing figures comparable to those of the Huaca de los Reyes have not been found at other early coastal sites. Man-like figures appear in some stonework from Chavin de Huántar, and some of these examples possess lower limbs resembling those of the area 3 friezes, but the poor state of preservation of the coastal figures does not permit detailed comparison. 158</page><page sequence="6">Northernmost bipedal figure of the colonnade panel in area 2. Right half of northern panel in area 3. Standing bipedal figure of area 5. X he bipedal figures of areas 2 and 3 stand on thick basal borders which are divided vertically between the figures' feet. Each half is decorated with a stylized head shown in profile facing out- ward. In area 5 the basal border lies to the west of the figure. The borders are executed in high relief. Typi- cally (as, for example, in the well-preserved base of the northernmost figure in area 2) the face is large and quadrangular and occupies slightly more than a third of the total composition. A plain horizontal band separates the top of the face from the two higher rectangular motifs which suggest headgear. The eye is rectangülar with the top slightly concave and the base slightly convex. A rectangular pupil is placed centrally at the top of the eye, above which are two small rectangles representing the top of a split ocular band that reappears immediately below the eye, then drops several centimeters and turns back to the rear of the face. The nose is represented with a deep nostril and an ala that curves at the top. The partially opened mouth has thick lips turning down at the corners. There are two rows of teeth: feline-like canines shown as interlocked rectangles that cross the adjacent tooth and lips, and four smaller teeth on each side of the canines. The ear, set at the back of the face behind the mouth and eye, is represented by a rectangular motif with curved edges. The vertical band be- hind the ear marks the end of the head and symbolizes the figure's neck. It is followed by three horizontal bands, each divided into three vertical sections. The sections farthest from the face have small rectangular depressions set in their top exterior corners. This creates an Li- shaped configuration, a motif used in Cupisnique times to indicate the ends of feathers; the Huaca de los Reyes artisans probably used it here to represent plumage. 159</page><page sequence="7">Basal border of the pillar in area 2. Zoomorphic figure in central niche of area 4. The border figures in areas 2 and 5 resemble each other but show some variation in the front and corners of their lips, the number of molar teeth, the presence of the ocular band above the eye and the depiction of plumage. The borders in area 3 are more distinctive, even though they share the same basic themes with the other borders. Executed in very shallow relief, they are now badly deteriorated; the best-preserved example is on the northern side panel of the entry colon- nade. In this frieze the eye and pupil are nearly rectangular. The same eye serves for the principal face and for its headgear. (This composition ex- hibits the Gupisnique convention of using the same motif for several different purposes in a single work.) When viewed upside down the headgear forms a second face which has an ear set behind the eye, a nose with a circular nostril and a thick lip with jawless mouth. Issuing from the mouth are two feather symbols and two elongated rectangles which probably represent canines. The partially opened mouth of the prin- cipal face reveals two rows of equal-sized teeth; the nose is circular with a centrally placed nostril. Marking the back of the face is a complex verti- cal motif representing a nose, two nostrils and the maxillary section of a mouth set on its side. The remainder of the panel is occupied by three rectangular motifs indicative of feathers issuing from its mouth. The other basal borders in area 3 resemble the one described above. Some variation occurs, how- ever, principally in the headgear, the front and corner of the lower lip and the number of feather symbols. In spite of the distinctive features of the area 3 borders, we believe they depict the same subject represented in the basal borders of areas 2 and 5. This being exhibits a combination of stylized anthropomorphic, avian and feline motifs. Some of the individual motifs have analogies in the art of other early Andean sites, particularly in stonework, but no other known composition either duplicates or resembles the basal borders at Huaca de los Reyes. Three niches were excavated in area 4. The northern niche jnay once have been decorated, but this is uncertain. The southern niche contains a very fragmentary frieze. Only in the central niche could aspects of the original design be traced with certainty. If we look at the niche head-on, a snake-like animal seems to be por- trayed with its head turned backwards. If, how- ever, we turn the photograph so that the niche's south side acts as its base, the frieze depicts a zoomorphic being with its head shown in profile. The top and back of the head are bounded by a deep wide groove, and the side of the face is demarcated by a horizontal band that corre- sponds to the neck of the being. The eye is rectangular with rounded basal corners, as is the pupil. Behind the eye, at the back of the head, a curl represents the ear. An upside down L with an interlocked U-shaped motif depicts the mouth. The U-shaped motif may represent a lip and the L motif, a molar tooth. A thick bifurcated band resembling a snake's body extends from the neck up to the top of the panel. As with the other friezes at the site the zoomorphic figure em- 160</page><page sequence="8">ploys motifs that have analogies at other early Cupisnique sites. However, their combination at Huaca de los Reyes is original, and comparable compositions are presently unknown. Huaca de los Reyes had a complex history of construction which includes both localized re- modeling and structural additions. It is possible, therefore, that some of the friezes may have been erected at slightly different periods, although it is likely that all the sculptures uncovered were visible and in use at one time. Since areas 1 and 2 form a single façade to the main platform, we can assume that the associated sculptures were constructed during the same phase. This would make the massive heads contemporary with the standing figures of area 2. The wing structures at Huaca de los Reyes are free-standing buildings, and at the present time, at least, the history of their construction cannot be directly related to that of the principal plat- form. It seems, however, unlikely that they were erected before the building of the main platform. To judge from the similarity of their style and their location on the central plaza, the artworks of areas 1, 2 and 5 would seem to constitute a single unit. Thus we suspect the area 5 frieze dates to the same time as or very shortly after those in areas 1 and 2. We do not yet know what, if any, structural ties exist between the friezes of areas 3 and 4, and those of areas 1 and 2. We also cannot say whether one set might predate the other. Although both groups were probably visible at the same time, they could have been constructed at different times, a speculation which rests on their stylistic differences. The phase of remodeling that saw the building of the niches in area 4 included the building of the wall ornamented by the southern frieze in area 3. This implies that the friezes were erected at the same time. The picture is complicated, however, by the fact that the sculpture in the central niche of area 4 extends a short distance behind the right side of the niche, a situation which can be interpreted in several ways. It may be due simply to the manner of niche construc- tion: the wall was built and sculpted before the side walls of the niche were added, in which case the right wall simply overlapped a section of the frieze. According to this interpretation the reliefs in areas 4 and 3 would be contemporary. On the other hand, the area 4 relief could have been put up sometime before the addition of the niches. The frieze would thus predate the building of the niches as well as the wall in area 3. In either case the area 4 frieze cannot postdate the area 3 panels. TChe reliefs at Huaca de los Reyes are associ- ated with cultural remains believed to date from the earlier half of the first millennium b.c. This date is consistent with the style of the artwork, which falls within the range of the Cupisnique culture. The wall decorations are basically repre- sentational, although the nature and meaning of the depictions are obscured by the canons and artistic conventions the artisans used. Apparently these workers were primarily concerned with the representation of human figures. Both the largest friezes (the massive heads) and the most numer- ous (the standing figures) are anthropomorphic, though embellished with feline and other proper- ties. The identity of the being represented in the basal borders is still unclear: it may be human or avian. Yet no matter what type of being these borders are intended to represent, it is obviously subordinate to the standing anthropomorphic figures. The zoomorphic figure of area 4 was certainly not human, but neither was it a major frieze nor a repetitive design. The newly discovered sculptures of Huaca de los Reyes make a significant contribution to our understanding of the range of variation in Cupis- nique art. Furthermore, they provide evidence for the position of the Caballo Muerto complex as an important cultural center independent of other coastal centers and of Chavín de Huántar. M .
