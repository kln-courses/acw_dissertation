For this reason, James Reardon-Anderson's work on chemistry in China takes a sociological approach. His gen- eral theme is the relationship of the authority of government to the development of science from the 1840s to 1949. The four-part struc- ture of his book follows a periodization of the career of government in China: a declining late Qing Dynasty, from the Western impo- sition of the treaty system in the 1840s to China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895; a weak and chaotic interregnum from 1895 to 1927, when the Chinese Na- tionalists established their government in Nanjing; a seemingly cohesive Nanjing De- cade from 1927 to 1937; and a period of chaos from 1937, when Japanese incursions in north China broke out into open warfare, until the fighting ended in 1945. Using a detailed body of material on sci- ence and technology in academic, industrial, and governmental settings, Reardon-Ander- son describes developments in each of his four periods. The focus is on chemistry, but Rear- don-Anderson also generalizes about other disciplines. A short review cannot even men- tion all the fascinating episodes that are in- cluded, beginning with the nineteenth-cen- tury creation of a Chinese chemical terminology and ending with the science pol- icies instituted by the Chinese Communists in wartime Yan'an. Reardon-Anderson shows that in relation to the Chinese state, the career of science runs a contrapuntal course: science rises as the state declines. Only during the Nanjing Decade does Reardon-Anderson find a coordination of the rising fortunes of both. No one in the West or in China has come close to Reardon-Anderson in giving such a comprehensive description of the history of modem science in China. In order to do this in one volume, Reardon-Anderson's analysis primarily serves the history of chemistry, mostly the history of chemical technology. Future work on other scientific disciplines in China may provide contrasts-contrasts that Reardon-Anderson himself suggests. Other disciplines might be better understood via a periodization that places less positive empha- sis on the Nanjing Decade and that highlights bicultural interaction in China rather than the fortunes of a Chinese state that was at times irrelevant. However, once we get to 1927, when the Chinese Nationalists take over, and also when we get to the mid 1930s, when the Chinese Communists establish themselves in Yan'an, there is an element of the relationship of the state to scientific work that transcends dif- ferences among disciplines. Reardon-Ander- son explains the demands that scientists' work serve the needs of the state. Nowhere is Rear- don-Anderson more forceful than when he describes the origin of Chinese Communist oppression of scientists, a disturbed relation of government to researchers that has contin- ued to this day and is partly exemplified by the unwillingness of Chinese students who have studied science in the United States to return home. WILLIAM J. HAAS * Twentieth Century David Hilbert. Natur und mathematisches Erkennen: Vorlesungen, gehalten 1919-1920 in G6ttingen. Lecture manuscript prepared by Paul Bernays. Edited by David E. Rowe. 600</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 84: 3 (1993) xxiv + 101 pp., figs., bibl. Basel/Boston: Birkhauser Verlag, 1992. SFr 58. David Hilbert (1862-1943) dominated the mathematical scene at the turn of the century. He was the main defender of the status quo in the Grundlagenkrise that culminated shortly after World War I. The problems he studied and the exacting standards he set are consti- tutive of modem mathematics. Hilbert was also deeply committed to physics and meta- physics-this was a hallmark of the G6ttingen Denkstil-and he studied a variety of prob- lems in mathematical physics from the early 1900s onward. Although his research on the foundations of physics received mixed re- views from his contemporaries, he was nom- inated for the Nobel Prize in physics every year from 1929 to 1933. With the collapse of the general theory of relativity as a research field in theoretical physics in the 1920s and the subsequent rise of quantum and nuclear physics, Hilbert's re- search program in physics came to be seen as infertile and gradually was suppressed in the collective memory of mathematicians and physicists. This in turn created an image of Hilbert as the paragon of pure mathematics and a formalist philosopher of mathematics. A correction to this lopsided picture of Hil- bert is long overdue. It is provided by this first publication of Hilbert's lectures on na- ture and mathematical knowledge, which he gave at the University of Gottingen in the winter semester 1919/1920. The text is a transcription of lecture notes taken by Hil- bert's assistant and longtime collaborator, the logician Paul Berays. The lectures were ed- ited by David E. Rowe, who writes an intro- ductory essay. It is surprising that the text has not been annotated, and there is no index. The lectures were intended to be a prepa- ration for a theory of knowledge. The first three question and refute customary views concerning mathematics: the role of intuition and experience, the role of presuppositions, and the noninfallibility (Nichtuntriiglichkeit) of mathematical conclusions are themes. The next group of lectures correct common views concerning physics: here the main issues are the formation of physical concepts, the laws of physics and eternal laws of nature, and the relationship between theory and experiment. The final group of lectures address philo- sophical questions: physical lawfulness and causality, natural events and probability, and the role of ideal structures. The lectures form, on the one hand, a se- quel to Hilbert's address to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. There he had taken stock of the field and put his stamp of approval on promising avenues for further research, including the axiomati- zation of physics. In the succeeding two de- cades, frequently with the help of his assis- tants, Hilbert applied his recently developed theory of integral equations to physical prob- lems (e.g., the kinetic theory of gases) and discovered, simultaneously with Albert Ein- stein, the field equations of the general the- ory of relativity. Hilbert's lectures are thus partly a report on his progress in physics in the intervening years. The lectures are, on the other hand, confessions of faith. Hilbert emphasized that mathematics was not an arbitrary game but was determined by inner necessity. He sought unity in nature and invariant formulations of natural laws in order to escape human arbi- trariness. His abhorrence of subjectivism and anthropomorphism made him a fellow trav- eler with Max Planck. Moreover, Hilbert was mesmerized by the unifying power of elec- tromagnetism, the elegance, simplicity, and invariant properties of Maxwell's equations, and the formulation of Maxwellian electro- magnetism as local differential laws. The local formulation of electromagnetism made it possible to unify geometry and phys- ics via differential geometry and cast the laws of physics in field form. Thus intuitive ele- ments such as action-at-a-distance laws (cf. the Newtonian law of gravitation), the last remnants of anthropomorphism, had been ex- pelled from physics; in the process, an ob- jective form of the laws of nature and unity and comprehensibility of the theoretical sys- tem had been reached. Einstein had brought this transformation about. The general prin- ciple of relativity was, in Hilbert's opinion, "the greatest victory of the spirit over the world of appearances" (p. 51); it came close to being "an eternal law of nature" (p. 55). In that manner Einstein, the undisputed hero of the lectures, was enlisted in the fight against the "counter-moders" and their celebration of intuition so perceptively analyzed by Herbert Mehrtens in Moderne Sprache Mathematik (Suhrkamp, 1990). It would be intriguing to know for whom these lectures were meant. Were they, like Hilbert's Paris speech, aimed at winning new converts to mathematics? If so, what rhetor- ical skills were needed to address the survi- 601</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 84 : 3 (1993) vors of the Great War during a winter of hun- ger and economic deprivation? The lectures do not provide an answer, but they make clear that false prophets existed. Thus Hilbert cas- tigated his erstwhile student Hermann Weyl for radicalizing his hopes for a unified field theory, for making it too deterministic; he christened Weyl's approach "Hegelian phys- ics." Rowe suggests in the introduction that Hil- bert's philosophy of mathematics may have more in common with empiricism than the formalism with which Hilbert has usually been associated. These lectures support that con- clusion. The next step would be to explore whether Hilbert himself maintained a consis- tent party line and to what extent his philos- ophy of mathematics evolved. The prereq- uisite for such a reevaluation must be further publication of Hilbert's unpublished manu- scripts. In light of the intriguing questions raised by this volume, such an undertaking promises exciting results, not only for the history and philosophy of mathematics, but for the history of the physical sciences as a whole.

With first glasnost and then the disintegration of the Soviet Union, it has become common knowledge that seven decades of communist rule inflicted unprecedented harm on the country's natural environment, with dire con- sequences for the health of the population, the economy, and ultimately the state. Less widely known is the irony that when the Bol- sheviks took power in 1917, Russian ecolog- ical science and environmental consciousness were among the most advanced in the world, and that even Lenin believed national policies must account for the true characteristics of natural systems as determined by science. The Cover of the first issue of the Soviet conservation journal Okrana Prirody (1928); the illustration's legend reads "And that is how the bison were exterminated!" (reprinted from Weiner, Models of Nature). two pathbreaking books reviewed here have played decisive roles in opening the two parts of this story to world scrutiny. Taken to- gether, they show with unique clarity the way in which the Soviet Union's environmental debacle was a tragic departure from more sci- entifically grounded and environmentally re- sponsible alternative paths, and the possibil- ities, however frail, for the USSR's successor states to find such paths again. Murray Feshbach, research professor of demography at Georgetown University and former adviser to the general secretary of NATO, and Alfred Friendly, Jr., former Moscow bureau chief for Newsweek, have compiled an awesome mass of data support- ing their overall conclusion that the USSR committed ecological suicide by pursuing de- cades of forced economic development in disregard of environmental consequences and their ramifications.
