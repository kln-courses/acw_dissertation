<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Religion of Ancient Egypt. By Samuel A. B. Mercer. London (Luzac), I949. Pp. 460, ii8 text figures. Price 4Ss. I17 0 The author claims for his treatise that it must inevitably be based upon myths and legends, poems, songs, hymns and prayers, narratives, biographies, histories and other literary remains, as well as upon what the classical writers have handed down, and he admits that a modern scholar 'with limited insight into ancient ways of religious thought' can only hypothetically reconstruct this ancient religion-'never one' but consisting of 'many cults 'at many places.' The book, thus, is not-nor does it pretend to be-the work of a student of comparative religion. The author-putting his trust in Manetho as a historian-assumes that 'Menes' is Egypt's first historic dynastic pharaoh who reigned some 3,000 years B.C., but he considers that the results of modemi archaeo- logical research are of greater value to the student of 'the facts of ancient Egyptian religious thought and practice' than anything to be learned from such writers as Herodotus, Eusebius, Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, Apuleius and Plotinus. He takes Oriental sym- bolism somewhat literally: the Egyptians 'saw heaven as an immense and friendly cow' and 'imagined heaven as a woman, bending over the earth' (p. 2I). His pages, however, are full of references to actual pictorial representations of this sort, duly figured, which should help the student to find his way about the extant remains ofEgyptian symbolic art. He accepts what he calls 'legends' as the naive ex- planations of how the cosmos came to be. The student of ancient religions, however, if he learns to compare the creation 'legends' of different historic civilizations, will realize that popular 'legends' or 'myths' of cosmogony, together with their dramatis personr, are mostly derived from a repertory of religious masques or panto- mimes of the same kind as our European mediaeval Christian mystery plays (themselves very often popularizations of adaptations by the early clergy of pagan 'mysteries'), and that these dramatic performances largely derived from traditional poetical allegories, handed down orally and thus frequently modified to suit particular occasions and different local-indeed national-audiences. There exist texts, not only of medieval European 'mysteries' (e.g. of 'Sainte Barbe,' I SS7) but ofBabyloniantimes (e.g. 'Epic of Creation,' Langdon, and 'Epic of Gilgamish,' Campbell Thompson); frag- ments of such texts incorporated in so-called Japanese 'chronicles' (see my review of Kato and Hoshino's translation of the Kogoshui, A.D. 807, MAN, I928, 20), and, of course, Egyptian, which illustrate my point. The author does not help us very much to understand the religious thought of the ancient Egyptians, but he does assemble between the covers of a single book a gallery of the many stylized figures, describing, where possible, their ritual roles, and usefully indicates his sources. This should be particularly helpful to the non- specialist in identifying and dating the animal and masked human figures met with in Egyptian religious art. He devotes a chapter each to the better-known deities and reproduces examples of how they were represented, but he also gives many figurations and descriptions of minor deities and demons as the Egyptian represented them. This factual part of his book is likely to be of more service to students than the chapters on 'Theological Systems' and 'The Two Great Cults' (of Osiris and of Re). He states that 'the religion of Ancient Egypt was definitely polytheistic.' Like most European scholars (in this influenced by the Hebrew Scriptures) he takes the Oriental many-sidedness of the postulated Creative Powers-in- volving many representations and symbols-as proof of the concept of a plurality of anthropomorphic gods and goddesses. It is true that simple people in all ages and climes tend to accept stylized individual representations as convenient images of the unseen powers-the tendency against which the Semitic religious leaders have always contended, but which temple officials, jealous of their vested interests in the votive offerings of the devout, as well as the super- stitious everywhere and in all ages, have encouraged. Probably the religious philosophy of the peoples of past times cannot be grasped without such clues as ecclesiastical art provides. It needs to be stressed, however, that such symbolism (as, e.g., the Catacomb representations and symbols of the Christian Messiah) is only a clue and that to understand these conceptions a key to the symbols and stylizations is not enough. Comparison with the cults and 'myths' of other historic civilizations that have left their mark in the folklore of those who came after, and a study of the writings of near con- temporaries in neighbouring lands-even when their authors do not understand fully the meaning of what they reported-is more helpful than crediting the ancient makers of the protective and votive images with the literal minds anid anthropomorphic bias of present-day Western-peoples. More students of the calibre of the late Sir John Woodroffe and Madame Alexandra David-Neel are much needed in this field, for civilizations pivot as much on the ideas of their thinkers concerning the cosmos, past and present, and man's relation thereto, as on their economy. The student of ancient Egyptian religion lies in no danger of forgetting the place occupied by the Nile and the desert in moulding the psychology and ritual of the people: what he is apt to ignore is the part played in their philosophic outlook by the still older religions of West and Central Asia. The author's chapters on 'The Idea of God,' on 'Worship' and on 'Mysteries' are not really helpful; he denies to the Egyptian any system of ethics. On such aspects of the Egyptian people's attitude to religion the student is likely to learn more from the relevant chapters in Margaret Murray's recently published The Splendour that was Egypt. An adequate index and sketch map are provided, and a list of authorities cited. V. C. C. COLLUM</page></plain_text>
