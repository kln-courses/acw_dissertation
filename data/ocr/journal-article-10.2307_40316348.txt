<plain_text><page sequence="1">CALENDAR SYMBOLISM OF URALIC PEOPLES OF THE PRE-CHRISTIAN ERA N. D. KONAKOV Translated by Lydia T. Black Abstract. The discovery within the European Northeast territories of calendrical im- ages dating to the pre-Christian era and their study permits us to discuss the common roots of calendrical symbolism of a number of peoples inhabiting territories in North- ern Eurasia. Analogies to calendrical symbolism used by peoples of North America may be noted. In this paper, rational knowledge of the environment as it is reflected in representational art is examined. Graphic systems underlying calendrical represen- tations are deciphered. The discovery in the Komi territory of a unique representation of an ancient hunting calendar (Fig. 1) and the subsequent study of this find give a much better and deeper understanding of the level of environmental knowledge and the world view of pagan [pre-Christian] Uralic populations. As the calendrical images were deciphered, it be- came apparent that the calendar in use was a so- lar one. The year began with the day of the spring equinox. The year was divided into periods (so called "months") which were based on the an- nual biological rhythms of the prey animals. In the calendar, these periods are represented by nine animal images: bear, reindeer, ermine, wol- verine, elk [moose], river otter, fox, squirrel, and marten. It was determined that these periods were of unequal duration, a feature characteristic of an- cient calendrical systems of many peoples. The Bear period lasted from 22 March to 27 April. It is at the end of March or April that bears leave their winter dens. During the Rein- deer period (28 April-2 June), both domestic and wild reindeer calve. The Ermine period began 3 June and ended 4 July. In June the preying ac- tivity of this species intensifies, as the young [born that spring] at this time switch to a meat diet. From 5 July to 9 August the wolverine be- comes "mistress of nature," so to speak. At this time, female wolverines accompanied by their young commence a wandering mode of existence. Their "poaching activity" when the young animals come forth in the forest contradicts the moral norms of the hunt [hunting ethic] and this is re- flected in the calendar. The Elk [Moose] period lasted from 10 August to 10 October. This is the time when drives of wild ungulates are conducted. The autumn equinox is observed on 23 September and this event is marked on the calendar by a so- lar sign shown beneath the elk [moose] snout. The Otter [river otter] period began 5 October and ended 19 December. Among the Komi, as among other peoples, the otter was considered a repre- sentative of the Nether World, an incarnation of the water spirit. Probably for this reason, it fell to this animal to represent the time of late autumn, when the longest night occurs in the North. The Fox period covered the timespan from 20 Decem- ber to 24 January. The winter solstice fell in the N. D.

Hunting Calendar, Komi Autonomous Republic. (Variant 4) first four days of the Fox "month." This event is marked on the calendar by a sign on the outward rim [frame] and by a notch on the animal's tail. The "month" of the squirrel was from 25 January to 21 February. Very cold temperatures and frosts begin to abate in January /February and squirrels come into heat. The concluding annual period was the Marten period which lasted from 22 Feb- ruary to 21 March. Around this time, martens un- dergo a period of intensified activity associated with springtime, the "false heat." A solar sign placed under the image of the marten indicates the end date of this period. This is linked to the spring phase of the sun (Konakov 1987). There is little doubt that the calendric sym- bolism of the ancient Uralic populations was far richer than the representations found in the hunt- ing calendar. Zoomorphic symbols designating seasons of the annual cycle are only a particular variant of mode of fixation, by means of represen- tational art, of calendrical knowledge and the concepts syncretically linked to it. Side by side with these there existed other allegorical repre- sentations of the annual seasonal cycle, to which the names of the months in the Komi folk calen- dar are ample testimony (Sidorov and Lytkin 1966:126). The division of the year into periods of spring, summer, fall, and winter, corresponding to the observed movements of the sun in the heavenly sphere and to seasonal changes in the natural en- vironment, was characteristic of all calendrical systems. The astral beginning of the annual sea- sons corresponds to the four solar phases (spring and autumn equinoxes, summer and winter sol- stices), although in folk calendars, as a rule, the partition of the year into periods is somewhat more arbitrary [or flexible]. The hunting calendar representation shows only two solar phases marked by solar symbols (spring and autumn equinoxes, see Fig. 1). Their positioning vis-a-vis each other, and the duality of the direction of movement of the animals which represent the periods when these phases occur (the Bear and the Elk [Moose]), clearly evidence the so-called two-fold or binary code. Number two is at the root of the simplest mode of numeration, which is apparent through various paired concepts (the binary oppositions). The binary code was characteristic of various world view systems, and underlies a wide circle of concepts linked to classification systems, and to the "ordering" of the surrounding world. Nev- ertheless, it has been noted by scholars studying folk cultures that "even though the binary cul- tural code, as is acknowledged, is universal, one cannot doubt the ethnic specificity of each op- position [or binary pair]" (Zhukovskaia 1987:243). That a dual or binary code underlies the hunting calendar is confirmed by the clearly rep- resented division of the year into two seasons which are in opposition to each other: the pro- ductive (hunting) season and nonproductive (breeding) season. An analogous division of the year into seasons according to succession of eco- nomic activities rather than to changes in the weather, was a characteristic feature of the calen- dars of other peoples also. It is even possible that among the ancient Komi the calendrical year was divided into two separate, independent entities. An indirect datum in support of this proposition is the fact that Komi language has two terms to indicate the concept of year: "vo" and "aros" (year when indicating age; years or seasons [Rus- sian "leto" and "god" respectively]). The second term, derived from the word "ar" (autumn), is, without doubt, of very ancient ori- gin. The word "ar," designating "year," is found among Udmurt. Mansi designate the concept of time with the word "arem" (oarem). Terms pho- netically similar are found in Samoyedic lan- guages and designate either the concept "year" (ere, Kamasintsy; ire, Koibaly; iriu, Motory; Ur'iu, Tofalary), or the concept "fall, autumn" (narra, Nentsy; narro, Nganasan; ara, Sel'kup). K. Redei (1986:26, 27) links these terms etymologically with the Sanscrit word sarad designating "fall/ autumn, year." In the Udor dialect of the Komi language the word "aros" also designates the autumn hunt. Among the Russian population of the former Arkhangelsk administrative unit, in whose dia- lect there is a significant Finnic substratum, the word ar' refers to the animal spoor on the new- fallen snow, and arit' [a verb], means to follow an animal on the new snow (Dal' 1981:26). This com-</page><page sequence="3">Konakov: Calendar Symbolism of Uralic Peoples 49 pacting into a single semantic group the concepts "hunt," "autumn," and "year" may be logically explained by the fact that hunting had a primary role in the economic activities of the ancient Komi. Similarly, among the Russians, a people with an ancient agricultural tradition, summer [leto] was singled out and this was reflected in the language. The term "god" is used to designate a year, but when defining age the term "let" is used. Traces of the division of the year into two basic seasons can be found in a number of folk calendars. Several peoples preserved this tradi- tion until very recent times. Among the Hun- garians, the contemporary spring and autumn festivals demonstrate the ancient linkage of the beginning of the seasons to both spring and au- tumn. The folk concepts of the Bulgarians merge spring and summer into a single season. In Bul- garia, beginning of summer is counted either from St. George's Day (6 May) or from early March. The Albanian calendar divides the year into two seasons, summer and winter. The year begins on the day of St. George, summer lasts to the day of St. Dimitrii [Demetrios], 9 November, and winter follows. In the remote past, Germanic peoples also divided the year into two periods, winter and summer. In some German lands, until very recent modern times, the day when winter ended and summer began was the feast of St. Gertrude on 17 March [Kalendarnye obychai 1977). Such dual division of the year into two seasons has been noted in folk calendars of the Finns, Aus- trians, Greeks, and other peoples {Kalendarnye obychai 1983). S. A. Tokarev analyzed calendrical rituals of the European countries. His results led him to conclude that the archaic division of a year into two seasons (winter- summer), when spring and autumn are considered transitional time spans, corresponds not to the world view of agricultur- ists, but to that of the more ancient cattle keeping populations {Kalendarnye obychai 1983:3, 4). His conclusion is supported by the fact that among the Veps, there existed until just recently a dual division of the cattle keeping economic year. From Egor'iev day [St. George Day], 23 April by the Julian or Old Style calendar, or from Nikolin [St. Nicholas] Day, 9 May by the Julian or Old Style calendar, and to the feast of Pokrova [Pro- tection of the Theotokos], 1 October by the Julian or Old Style calendar, was the season called pai- menan aign (literally, "herding time"). The feast day of Pokrova began the season veraz aig (liter- ally, alien [chuzhoe] time) (Vinokurova 1988:8). There are reasons to suppose that the binary code in defining calendrical entities is even more archaic and universal. An example is the folk cal- endar of Tungus-Manchu peoples of Siberia. Among the Tungusic tribes winter and summer are the basic subdivisions of a year. Earlier, each of these seasons was a separate [independent] entity. There was a winter year and there was a summer year. Negidal hold to this concept even now, while the Ude have two beginnings of a year: one in the au- tumn, the second in the spring (Petrova 1937:106). The Evenk divide the year into two periods: from May to October, the reindeer period, and from Oc- tober to May, the hunting period (Mazin 1986:124). It seems to us that the zoomorphic symbol- ism of the spring season or (when there is a dual structure of the year) of the spring/summer pe- riod, by the use of the image of the bear, is no less ancient or universal. Such representation is widely utilized in calendrical rituals of various peoples. Bear's emergence from his den following winter hibernation was the sign that winter has ended and spring begun among Italians, Ruma- nian, and French {Kalendarnye obychai 1977). In the Russian folk calendar this event has become linked to one of the central spring Church Feast Days, that of the Annunciation. Among the Be- lorussians [White Ruthenians], at the festival of komaedzitsy, held on the eve of the Feast of the Annunciation, participants in ritual masking "put on their fur coats with fur to the outside and walk swaying from side to side, imitating the movements of a bear when he wakes up from his sleep in the spring" (Zelenin 1936:241). Bear im- agery was central in the festive spring carnivals among the Austrians, Swiss, Hungarians, Poles, Chechs, Slovaks, and peoples of Yugoslavia {Ka- lendarnye obychai 1977). Russian bear masking took place during Cheesefare Week (Sokolova 1979:33, 49). The persistence in the world views of agri- cultural peoples of this ancient zoomorphic sym- bol of fertility and cyclicity in nature, despite the appearance of new symbols, such as bull or ox, goat, pig, horse, and others, attracted and contin- ues to attract scholarly attention. B. A. Rybakov, having analyzed a wide range of sources, sees the main reason for this symbol's stability and glob- ality among the Eastern Slavs in the fact that the Bear cult associated with the hunt, one of the most ancient hunting cults, became modified to fit within the concepts of the ancient agricultur- ists. The notion of reproduction and increase of prey animals was transformed into the notion of agricultural fertility, while the symbol of the for- mer was retained to signify the latter (Rybakov 1981:98-108). This proposition found support among scholars who investigated the calendrical rites of Europe when they considered the notions that a bear is a harbinger of nature's spring time awakening {Kalendarnye obychai 1983:79). In studies of calendric mythology, it is ac- cepted that the most archaic notation of diurnal and</page><page sequence="4">50 Arctic Anthropology 31:1 seasonal changes are the disappearance and return of personifications of the sun, light, warmth, and fertility. The theme of the bear's "disappearance" is marked in the Russian folk calendar. According to these folk beliefs, the bear enters his den for hibernation on the feast of Elevation of the Holy Cross (14 September by Julian or Old Style calen- dar). It was held that it is dangerous to enter the woods on that day (Bolonev 1978:101). The Mari held their so-called bear festival (maisk pairem) at the time of this Feast. The Mari name of the festival is linked to the belief that it is on this day that the Bear commences his hibernation (Popov 1979:124). Among the Komi hunters, the Church feast of St. Simeon of the Pillar [Semen lun, cele- brated 1 September by Julian or Old Style calen- dar) was consider the "Bear Day." The prohibition to enter or to be in the forest on this day was ex- plained by the belief that the day belonged to the Bear, when Bear weddings were held. D. Fokosh- Fuks has recorded from Vychegda Komi a myth- ological legend which stated that at one time St. Nicholas gave the Bear a gift of three days of free life [i.e., free from being hunted? - trans.], be- ginning with the Day of St. Simeon. "On these days only those enter the woods who count only on their own power. St. Nicholas will not save such an one" (Fuchs 1924:252). According to my own field data, the Vychegda hunters observe the prohibition on entering the forest not only on the day of Semen-lun but also for a week following, that is until 22 September by the modern [Gre- gorian] calendar, the date of the autumn equinox. Norwegians had a folk legend that on 21 Septem- ber, the Day of St. Mathias, the Bear collects grass and moss and prepares his winter lair [Kalendar- nye obychai 1978:104). When there exists a dual calendrical code, the disappearance (passing) of one mythological personification representing the yearly season, logically presupposes the return (appearance) of another. In the hunting calendar of the ancient Komi, autumn, or rather the fall-winter period, is represented by the zoomorphic symbol of a fe- male elk [moose]. Elk [moose] and bear, as global symbols, including calendrical oppositions, are widely represented in mythology of the peoples of Siberia. Factual material which was analyzed permits us to propose that these two polysemic images were at one time the two basic calendrical symbols not only among the peoples of Siberia but within a much larger cultural sphere. The elk [moose] as a zoomorphic symbol of the autumn/ winter calendrical timespan was apparently as universal in the calendrical symbolic system as was the Bear as symbol of the spring. The archae- ologist V. E. Larichev seems to be on firm ground when he asserts that the idea of representation with the aid of zoomorphic personages ". . . of the interaction of the polar world powers and cosmic phenomena, in particular of the astro- nomic and natural-calendrical order with its sea- sonal and diurnal changes" appeared and was formulated within the world view of paleolithic humans (Larichev 1987:45, 47). In the mythological representations of various peoples, the image of the elk [moose] is seman- tically close and interchangeable with another ungulate denizen of the taiga and tundra zones of Northern Eurasia - the reindeer. Both species have comparable biological rhythms and both played a significant role in the economies of the people who practiced foraging. In B. A. Rybakov's (1979:21) opinion, elk [moose] and reindeer cults originated in the Mesolithic. In the past, many groups of Northern Eurasia had widely distrib- uted concepts of the Sun-Elk (Okladnikov 1964: 52-86). A. F. Anisimov (1959:13, 14) considered concepts linked to solar symbolism in association with the elk and the reindeer to be among the most ancient elements of cosmological concepts. Calendrical concepts, as have been noted by var- ious researchers, always are linked to concepts of chaos and cosmos, of structure of the universe, . . . of the heavens and stars (Braginskaia 1987:612). "Elk" names for the stars, elucidated through calendrical mythology, existed up to modern times among many peoples of Siberia. Khanty, Ket, Sel'kup, and Evenk, all associated the Big Dipper constellation with the elk [moose]. B. A. Rybakov noted that among the Slavs, stellar "Elk" names preceded the "Bear" names. For example, the Polar Star earlier was called the "Elk Star" [gwiazda Losiowa] by the Poles, and the Great Bear [Big Dipper] was called Sokhatyi, the Elk [moose], by the Russians (Rybakov 1974:6). The period of autumn drives of the wild un- gulates is reflected in a wide range of names for the autumn months among many peoples of Si- beria. The legend explaining the custom of cattle sacrifice at the summer/fall church feasts, which was spread through the entire Russian North, stated that in former times in this period reindeer [deer] and elk [moose] came out of the forest and approached the people of their own free will (Shapovalova 1973). A. Popov (1848:137) recorded a legend of this type among the Komi in the first half of the last century. Among the Vepsy and Southern Karel there existed a legend about a reindeer or elk who came out of the forest early in August (on St. Elias Day, 20 July of the Julian or Old Style Calendar) (Pimenov 1965:243). Most of the recorded stories about the emergence from the forest of an elk, reindeer, two reindeer, or a female with a calf were, in the past, linked with the church feast of the nativity of the Theotokos, which coincides</page><page sequence="5">Konakov: Calendar Symbolism of Uralic Peoples 51 with the date of the autumn equinox (Rybakov 1979:32). Ethnographic data obtained among peoples for whom hunting, in the historic period, had only minimal economic significance, testify to the fact that even among such people the reindeer or elk image at some time symbolized the autumn period and, in respect to the economy, repre- sented the start of the hunting season. For in- stance, in the Netherlands, the feast Hartjesdag is observed on the second Monday in August. Some scholars hold that this feast was dedicated to the Earth Goddess Herda, and that the name is a cor- ruption of "the Goddess Herda day." However, in folklore traditions "it is linked with deer hunting (hartjesjagen; hert means deer in Dutch). Precisely at this time the Amsterdamers were permitted to hunt deer. The deer that were killed were roasted on spits in the streets." In England, in the town of Stratford, on the feast day of the local church, 4 September, it was obligatory to perform the "dance of the horns." There were 12 dancers, six of whom wore on their shoulders deer skins and had deer horns fastened to their heads. The skins and horns used were preserved in the local chapel from one festival to another. Of the other six masked dancers, two boys, armed with bows and arrows, represented hunters [Kalendarnye obychai 1978:63, 92). In societies with clearly defined dual orga- nization, the binary calendrical symbolism was often employed to designate the moieties. Thus, among the ancient Maya of Mexico, in the early stages of state formation, there was a periodic shift of the moiety in power: the "summer" and "winter" ones. The seasonal leaders ruled for half a year in turn, winter and summer. The Iowa tribe of North America were also divided into the Win- ter and Summer moieties. "The tribe was led by two chiefs, each elected from a certain lineage of his moiety: the Bear lineage [clan] from the Win- ter moiety, the Bison or Buffalo lineage [clan] of the Summer moiety. Each led the tribe for half a year" (Guliaev 1987:109, 111). Among the Oto tribe, the chief of the Bear lineage [clan] led during the first part of the year, and the chief of the Bison lineage [clan] led during the second half of the year (Averkieva 1981:145). There are traces of anal- ogous calendrical symbolism designating moieties among the peoples of Siberia. According to data of A. F. Anisimov, the moieties of the Evenk were symbolized by the elk [moose] and the bear. Dur- ing the election of the chief, which took the form of intermoiety competition, two sacrificial altars were erected, one dedicated to the elk [moose], the other to the bear. It was believed that the elk [moose] and the bear were each supporting his own moiety, "held up the hearts of their chiefs" ÍAnisimov 1936:167). The bison, the largest ungulate of the Ameri- can prairies, and the elk [moose], its analog within the forest-taiga zone, are without doubt interchange- able images, while the principle of the calendrical and moiety symbolism is absolutely identical: two equal but mutually opposing seasons which follow each other cyclically. The oppositional na- ture of the seasons, their polarity in terms of cal- endrical opposition, is emphasized through the second binary pair, that of the prey animal (bear)/ grass eating animal (bison or elk). The Siberian example contains, in addition, a reflection of yet another idea: the struggle and victory of one sea- son over another. This idea is no less ancient than the idea of the simple passing and return of the calendrical mythical personifications. The conception that the bear and the elk are opposing powers, practically equal in strength, was a very widespread notion among the people of the taiga zone. Thus, in the Trans-Onega Lake region, there were localities where elk hunting was not prac- ticed at all, as it was believed that the Elk expels the Bear from his territory (Loginov 1986:45). Cor- responding to the mythological conceptualization of cyclical time, the struggle of opposing powers guarantees equilibrium within the universe. On the basis of the myth of the Cosmic Hunt, it is possible to reconstruct still another archetype of the mythopoetic conception of this idea in the world view of the ancient hunting population of Northern Eurasia through the zoomorphic code. We shall cite here, in a slightly abbreviated form, a variant of this tale, recorded in 1976 by A. I. Mazin among the Evenk. This happened long, long ago, before the earth expanded, when [she] was very small ... At that time there was no night, the sun shone twenty- four hours [calendrical day, sutki]. One day, in the autumn, the male elk at the time of heat grabbed the sun and ran toward the heavens. The female elk which accompanied him, ran after him. Night fell upon the earth . . . There lived at that time among the Evenk a famous hunter and strong man, Mani. He alone among the Evenk did not become confused. He took up his bow, called his hunting dogs and went after the elks . . . The female, choos- ing her moment, turned sharply to the north, to the hole in the heavens, to escape from him. Mani was close behind and shot the male elk, but he had no sun with him. [Mani] guessed that the elk had given the sun to the female ... he began to shoot at her with his hero's bow ... As soon as Mani recovered the sun and gave it back to the peo- ple, all members of the cosmic hunt were trans- formed into stars. Since then, day is alternating with night, and the cosmic hunt is repeated . . . (Mazin 1984:9). In the most ancient variant of this myth, the focus is on the cosmic bear Mangi who liberates the sun stolen by the elk. Among the Evenk this</page><page sequence="6">52 Arctic Anthropology 31:1 cosmic hunter, the Bear Mangi, is identified with the Arcturus constellation, and the cosmic elk Khenglen is identified with the Great Bear [Big Dipper]. The Milky Way is the trace of the skis of the cosmic hunter (Anisimov 1959:11, 15). Among the Ket, the myth about the cosmic hunt of the Heavenly Elk was also current. The Mansi had a tradition about the pursuit by the hero Tunkpas, running on skis, of an elk, who had descended from the sky. Among the Tuva and Al- taitsy peoples, the object of the Heavenly hunt was the female noble deer [maral]. Names for the con- stellation of the Big Bear [Big Dipper] "which were partaking of the elk" existed, as has been noted above, among a number of the peoples of Northern Eurasia. The name "spoor of the skis" for the Milky Way has been recorded among the Ket and Khanty. Among the Turkic and Finno-Ugric speak- ing peoples, the Milky Way is designated as "The Birds' Road," but among the Komi both names were current: "Kai tui" and "Liampa tui." Analysis of the genesis of the Cosmic Hunt myth demonstrates that we are dealing with the most ancient binary zoomorphic code found in Northern Eurasia. The zoomorphic symbols - the image of the greatest predator of the taiga zone, the bear, and the wild ungulate (elk [moose], rein- deer, or noble deer) - express in mythopoetic form the idea of the succession of day and night, as well as that of the seasons. The active princi- ple (i.e., spring, male procreative power, destruc- tive tendency) is expressed within this zoomor- phic code by the image of the bear, while the passive principle (autumn, female reproductive source, sacrificial idea) is expressed by the image of a female ungulate. The Cosmic Hunt myth encompasses also another archaic variant of imagining the diurnal and seasonal changes: the killing (death) and res- urrection (coming to life) of the calendric zoo- morphic symbols. Customarily, this variant is considered to be more recent than the image of disappearance and return of the mythological per- sonifications of the sun, light, warmth, and fertil- ity. It is being treated as a typically agrarian meta- morphosis: death of the seed and the resurrection in the form of the plant. We consider that the Russian ethnographer V. G. Bogoraz-Tan (1926) was right when he stated that the myth about the death and resurrection of an animal is a regular hunting-associated parallel to the agricultural myth of the death and resurrection of the vegeta- tion spirit. The de-mythologized theme of the Cosmic Hunt is present among the Komi and in Western Finn epics. The themes of a struggle, counter-balance (opposition), or torture of zoomorphic personages found in representational art have attracted schol- Figure 2. Petrograph, Maia River (Okladnikov and Mazin 1979:126). arly attention for a long time. The dominant inter- pretation of these themes in the contemporary art studies is that they are symbolic of spring renas- cence. The most ancient analogies to these themes are to be found in Sumerian art. As is clear from petroglyphic materials, this calendrical theme of the struggle between the two main annual seasons reflected in the zoomorphic code was known since ancient times among the peoples of Northern Eur- asia. This theme is especially clearly represented in the imagery of the petrograph found along the River Maia, a tributary of the Aldan (Fig. 2). The opposing images of the bear and the elk in this composition are located exactly in the same way as in our hunting calendar (Fig. 1). The elk moves to the right, clockwise, the bear to the left, coun- ter-clockwise. It is exactly the manner in which the infliction of suffering on beasts is represented in the ancient art of the southern cultures. The predator (animal, bird) moves counter-clockwise, the victim moves clockwise (Figs. 3-8). A set of ethnographic examples testifies that among the peoples of Northern Eurasia the images of the elk or reindeer (deer) and of the bear were linked also to the concepts of west and east. Among the Nganasan, the female elk or the female wild reindeer image stood for Earth-Mother. "Her head is turned toward the west. She travels there following the sun" (Gracheva 1983:21). The Komi hunters in earlier times when burying the head, af- ter the bear had been killed, uttered a [spell]: "Vot tenò ciuiam uvlan' iuròn, rytylò - asylò banòn, on mòdys' lok tatchò" (We are burying you head down, with the face from west to east, so that you should not come back here again). A detailed analysis of ethnographic and folk- loristic materials indicates that among many</page><page sequence="7">Konakov: Calendar Symbolism of Uralic Peoples 53 Figure 3.

Direction of the movement of the point of sunrise by calendrical periods. peoples zoomorphic calendrical symbols were identified with cosmic objects. The solar symbol- ism of the elk (reindeer, deer) and bear images among the peoples of Northern Eurasia is traced with a sufficient degree of clarity. From this, it becomes easy to explain the linkage of the con- cepts bear = east = spring = movement to the left (counter-clockwise) and of the elk [moose] (rein- deer, deer) = west = autumn = movement to the right {"posolon," "with the sun"). Many scholars hold that in palaeolithic times human beings were already aware that the sun rises precisely in the east and sets precisely in the west only at the times of the spring and au- tumn equinoxes. Beginning with the spring equi- nox, the point of the sunrise along the horizon begins to move in a northerly direction (to the left, counter-clockwise); after the summer solstice it returns from the northeast. Beginning with the day of autumn equinox, the sun travels in a south- erly direction (to the right, clockwise) and follow- ing the winter solstice it begins its return from the southeast (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). When general ori- entation is toward the east, the movement is north to the left, and south to the right; when there is a southern orientation, as was the case among many peoples in the past, the left is east, the right is west. Since the sun is located to the left of east during the "active" seasons of spring and summer, and to the right during the "pas- sive" seasons of increase [fertility, new genera- tion], it is possible readily to discern the sexual connotations of these symbols, the selection of specific symbols for the binary calendrical code, and also to discern the conceptual linkage be- tween the northward (east) movement with the ac- tive (male) way [road], and the southward (west) movement with the passive (female) one. If we assume the elevation of the sun in the zenith to be the median during the equinoxes, then the sun's position during various seasons above or be- low the median explains why the calendrical symbolism also includes the binary opposition of high/low (spring- summer/autumn-winter). The basic structural elements of the mythopoetic con- ception of cyclical time are the diurnal and an- nual cycles. We have already noted above that the transference of notions pertaining to part of a year or a whole year among some people is universal. As noted by several scholars, "in a mythological sense it is specifically the alternation of day and night which serves as the elementary semantic model for the opposition of light and darkness on which all calendrical mythologemes are built" (Braginskaia 1987:617). In the realm of representational art, the diur- nal and annual cycles are clearly apparent through the so-called solar symbolism, which has very an- cient roots. The solar symbolism of the Uralic Pa- gan systems has not been studied in sufficient depth, though there are several interesting works dedicated to this topic. Below we shall briefly ex- amine the calendrical aspects of solar symbolism and elicit the graphics which underlie it. The simplest variant of solar representation is a circle or a set of concentric circles. By itself, it does not have any calendrical significance. It may express the notion of the cyclical move- ment(s) of a heavenly body (or bodies), but it does not focus on the specific phases of this move- ment. On the other hand, a cross within the cir- cle, or simply a cross, symbolizes such phases and their linkage with the points of the compass: east (sunrise), south (solar zenith), west (sunset), and north (solar nadir). A cross with the end ele- ments of each arm bent (the swastika) symbolizes in addition the direction of the observed move- ment of the heavenly body across the sky or heavens. The simplest geometric figure represent- ing the diurnal solar symbolics is the diamond. This figure is derived through linking by straight lines the points of intersection of the mutually perpendicular diameters of the circle (the main elements of the cross), of this simplest solar sym- bol. The solar symbolism of the diamond is clearly reflected in the Komi name for this ornamental element: "gògyl' ser" (decorative circle) (Belitser 1958:340). Among the Russians of the European North, as well as in the Smolensk area and in By- elorussia, the diamond also is named "circle"</page><page sequence="9">Konakov: Calendar Symbolism of Uralic Peoples 55 (Dmitrievea 1985:176, 177). Such considerations permit us to add this symbol (the diamond) to the cross and the swastika as the universal signs of diurnal symbolism. The graphic schemata of annual solar sym- bolism show that the simplest variant thereof is two opposing vectors. When a linear arrangement of symbols is used, this variant is represented within the binary zoomorphic code as two ani- mals which either face each other or move toward each other, each in the opposite direction. These represent symbols of two seasons of a year. The direction of their movement corresponds to the direction of the movement of the point of the sun- rise in the course of the first half of each season (see Fig. 2). When the circular placement of sym- bols is used, an arrangement which represents more directly the concept of the cyclicity of time, the zoomorphic symbols move toward each other along the circle. It is possible to suppose that this variant was not typical in the representational art of the Uralic speaking Pagans and was adopted under the influence of their neighbors to the south. It is imperative to note that this is not a simple borrowing of symbols, but only a utiliza- tion of the notion that annual symbols can be placed circularly. Evidence for this may be found when art objects of local manufacture are com- pared with those from the south on which cal- endrical symbolism appears (see Figs. 3-8). Local examples show a clearly Northern Eurasian cal- endrical symbolization, rather than the southern annual zoomorphic calendrical symbolism. In the local examples, the seasonal symbols do not so much struggle with each other (as is the case with the more southern examples) but simply stand against each other. A more complicated variant of the calendri- cal symbolics goes beyond the idea of the binary division of the annual cycle to encompass also the idea of binarity within each of the seasons. In this variant the direction of movement of the sun- rise within each of the four calendrical seasons is clearly represented. Graphically, this idea of bi- nary opposition within each semiannual period (spring- summer and autumn-winter), of the four seasons among themselves, may be expressed in the following manner. Variant I represents the notion of binary op- position of two annual periods, and within each of these two, binary opposition of the seasons which compose it: spring=summer, autumn= winter. The semiannual opposition is expressed either through the opposition of the left=right (Fig. Ila), representing the point of sunrise to the right or to the left from the east, or through the opposition top=bottom [high=low] (Fig. lib), re- flecting the situation of the sun in respect to the zenith, either above or below the median. The seasonal opposition is expressed through vectors. In variant 2, besides the opposition of the semiannual periods, the notion of opposition of their first (spring=autumn) and second (sum- mer=winter) component parts is also expressed (Fig. 12a, 12b). Variants 3 and 4 represent in graphic form the calendrical year. The sequential location in a circular pattern of the four year sea- sons either clockwise (Fig. 13) or counter-clock- wise (Fig. 14) is utilized. "Calendrical symbolism or symbolics," or specifically the "calendar" (calendrical represen- tation), is a concept of insufficient adequacy. The calendrical symbolism which we have examined without doubt was recognized in much wider cir- cles than was the knowledge and operational use of precise calendrical reckoning. The presence of calendrical symbolism on many objects of ancient applied art may be cited as evidence here. The calendrical representation found on the shores of the Vychegda River (see Fig. 1) shows nine periods of the year, each period having its own symbol derived from the zoomorphic code. Two of these signs indicating the beginning of the basic annual seasons are universalistic, as we have demonstrated earlier. Of the four solar phases, only three are represented on this calendar: the spring phase (Bear symbol), autumn (Elk [moose] symbol), and the winter (Fox symbol). Animal fig- ures which symbolize the annual seasons are lo- cated in accordance with the vectors of the given seasons (Fig. 14, variant 4 of the graphical scheme). The polyzoomorphic solar calendrical code is found also among other Eurasian peoples. For ex- ample, the theme represented on a skin vessel from Tuva (Fig. 15) corresponds to the graphics scheme of variant IB (Fig. lib), though the spe- cific animal images which symbolize the direc- tion of the movement of the point of sunrise during various annual seasons on this Tuvan item are different. A bone plaque, showing two opposing pairs of stylized bear figures, has been found at Goro- dishchenskoa town, which dates to the tenth to thirteenth centuries A.D. and is located in the Solikamsk district of the Perm region (Fig. 16). Between the opposing pairs there is an oval, which in all likelihood constitutes a solar sign. Depending on the placement of the plaque, the representation corresponds to the graphical scheme of variant 2a or 2b. The use of the bear symbols in this representation of the calendrical symbol- ism testifies to continuity of the ancient northern Eurasian traditions. At the same time, the princi- ple itself of monozoomorphic solar calendrical symbolization should be considered universal. A few examples: among the Yakut (Fig. 17) and Pueblo Indians (Fig. 18) a bird image served this</page><page sequence="10">56 Arctic Anthropology 31:1 Figure 11. Variant 1. Figure 12. Variant 2.

But the specific artistic tradition dictated various means of vector representation. The Yakut used the direction of movement of the entire figure, the Pueblo only the turn of the head, while the Kypchak used the bend of the tail. The monozoomorphic principle of represen- tation of calendrical symbolics appears even sharper on a number of cult objects. On such ob- jects, the bear is often represented in a position which, at first glance, appears to be rather strange. One bear figurine, found in the territory of the Komi Republic, carries on its chest an anthro- pomorphic mask, symbolizing the sun, while the fore- and hind-paws indicate the direction of movement of the point of sunrise in accordance to phases (Fig. 20, variant 2b). The bear figurine from Prikam'ie (Fig. 21) corresponds to the graphic scheme of variant lb. A bear figurine from Ust'- Ishim in Western Siberia (Fig. 22) embodied vari- ant 3 of the graphics schema, while the stylized bear figurine itself falls into variant 2b. Univer- sality of such methods of representation of cal- endrical symbols finds support in the bear image from a house front of the Indians of North Amer- ica (Fig. 23, variant lb). Besides the zoomorphic images, anthropo- morphic figures associated with the calendrical symbolism are also found. Such are, for instance, the figurines of the Ust'-Ishim archaeological cul- ture (Figs. 24, 25, variants 2b, 3). Archaeological data demonstrate that the anthropomorphic solar calendrical code is no less ancient than the zoo- morphic one. Such images are widely represented</page><page sequence="12">58 Arctic Anthropology 31:1 Figure 20. Zoomorphic image, Komi Autonomous Republic (Aspelin ,1877:52). (Variant 2b) Figure 21.

Both anthropomorphic and anthropo-zoomorphic calendrical codes are widely represented in ancient pictographs of Eurasia, and merit special study. Valuable and interesting material pertaining to calendrical symbolism of Uralic Paganism is evident in the traditional decorative arts of the peoples of Northern Eurasia. In particular, through application of the graphic schema of binary cal- endrical symbolism proposed here, it is possible to establish the solar-calendrical semantics of a number of geometric ornamental elements in the art of the peoples of Siberia. The binary principle of the division of the calendrical year which was examined in this pre- sentation, and the associated zoomorphic symbol- ism, do not exhaust, and do not represent, by far, the totality of calendrical knowledge and means of its expression among the peoples of EXirasia. In this paper, we succeeded in locating and de- ciphering two calendrical representations from the territory of the European Northeast, one of which resembles the hunting calendar which was discussed above (Fig. 27). The second representa- tion, found in the north of the Komi Autonomous Republic, is a calendar based on the annual bio- logical cycle of the reindeer. Though all three cal- endrical images found in the European Northeast differ among themselves, they also have common features. The calendrical knowledge and the cal- endrical symbolism of the Pagan peoples of the Ural Regions, and any reconstruction of their sys- tem(s), without doubt await and demand more detailed, patient and painstaking, long range study.
