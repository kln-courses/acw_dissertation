Cambridge University Press, 1915. PROFESSOR RIDGEWAY in the present work undertakes to critcise his critics. The theory set forth in his Origin of Tragedy that Greek Tragedy originated in the worship of the dead has been assailed by the upholders of rival ex- planations framed in terms of totemism, fertility-rites, initiation-rites, mana, and so forth. He retorts that these anthro- pological principles are not 'primary;' that such phenomena one and all them- selves originated in the worship of the dead. Therefore Greek Tragedy did not come into existence by way of these secondary developments, but arose directly from the worship of the dead. The argument is unconvincing. Even if it can be shown that your far-off ancestor was an ape, it does not follow that your father was an ape. Here my sole concern must be with the validity of the anthropological principles to which Professor Ridgeway assigns a secondary rank. The question of the origin of Greek Tragedy is hardly my affair, when so many are better qualified to discuss it. But I am personally subjected to a good deal of drastic, though perfectly good-natured, criticism for my advocacy of mana as a root-principle of explanation applying to the origins of magical and religious rites. ' With the theories of Kuhn, Max MUiller, Mannhardt, Frazer, and Marett must fall the doctrines of Greek Tragedy based upon them by Professor Dieterich, Dr. Farnell, Miss Harrison, Mr. Cornford, and Professor G. G. Murray, and that of Hindu Tragedy founded upon them by Professor A. B. Keith.' Fortunate are the classical scholars whose views are impugned. Though they occupy the forward trenches, Professor Ridgeway's heavy artillery directs its high-angle fire to their rear. We of the supports catch it. In the interests of pure fighting, I could almost wish that I did not agree with Professor Ridgeway so fully as I do. As it is, I have always believed, and have said repeatedly in print, that animism may be as primitive as mana, or as Sir James Frazer's 'magic,' or as anything else belonging to the order of magical or religious facts. After all, we have good reason to hold that Mousterian man of the mid - pleistocene period buried his dead with an eye to their comfort in a future state. Even if we put down his date at a beggarly fifty thousand years ago, and do not postulate a round million with the more robust votaries of prehistorics, that would allow a veryfair time in which secondary developments of animism might occur, ere ever Thespis took to his waggon. On the other hand, the French caves of</page><page sequence="2">16o THE CLASSICAL REVIEW the Reindeer Age afford strong indica- tions of the existence of hunting-rites of the kind that figures so prominently in The Golden Bough. Whether the animals represented at Niaux or Tuc d'Audoubert were in the first instance made the object of ceremonies, not on their own account, but because they were such as might have eaten the human dead, as according to Professor Ridgeway's theory of the origin of totemism, is not known. As a matter of fact, nearly all of them are herbivores. At any rate, however, it is pretty clear that, say, fifteen thousand years ago, ritual observances devoid of any anthropomorphic element, at all events so far as concerns the accom- panying art-forms, were already in vogue. The alleged 'parasitic growth' had plenty of time in which to foster parasites of its own-on the principle that 'the little fleas have lesser fleas I . .'- before Thespis exploited ritual in the interests of art. Now I have no call to defend the theories of Sir James Frazer, much less to support any of those explanations of Greek Tragedy that have been founded thereupon. All I would point out is that the fertility-rites to which these ex- planations refer us are in Sir James Frazer's sense of the term primarily ' magical.' But is' magic' in this sense any less primary a source of ritual than the worship of the dead, on Professor Ridgeway's own showing ? Having laid it down that the essence of religion consists in 'the belief of the existence of the soul after the death of the body and the worship of the dead,' he goes on to declare that 'Religion is at least as early a stage as Magic, and certainly is not later.' So it would seem that fertility-rites in so far as they embody ' magic' may be as primary as animism after all. By this all too generous con- cession Professor Ridgeway appears to me to give away his whole case. For the rest, his ingenious method of dis- posing of the priest of Nemi does not greatly affect the general question of the validity of 'fertility-magic' as a principle of explanation, either abso- lutely or even in an ad homincm way; since Sir James Frazer at the end of the third edition of The Go!den Bough in- forms the startled reader that the priest of Nemi, having served his turn as a peg on which to hang facts, may now him- self go hang. And now for miana. 'The term mana . . ,' writes Professor Ridgeway,' has come into the nomenclature of Com- parative Religion from Dr. R.R. Marett's essay on Pre-Animistic Religion. His statements have not unreasonably been taken to mean that there was a pre- animistic stage in the evolution of Religion, though he now disclaims this interpretation, yet hardly with success.' I am sorry that I have managed to convey a false impression to Professor Ridgeway, and still more sorry that he should find it inconvenient to give that false impression up. My view has always been that mania, or wonder- working power, may be attributed to a rite that in its inception has had nothing to do with animism, but is in- spired by some other notion, as, for instance, by what Sir James Frazer would call 'magic,' namely, the sympa- thetic principle. Thus a Melanesian picks up a stone that is fearfully and wonderfully shaped in the likeness of a yam, and concludes that it has mana for making yams grow. I believe that the wonder-working power is suggested in the first instance simply by the fact that the stone is so wonderfully like a yam. If the Melanesian, as apparently happens, explains the efficacy of his charm, not on the ground that 'like produces like,' but on the ground that the stone has 'eaten ghost,' I assume this to be a secondary gloss due to what Professor Ridgeway would himself call 'a natural extension' of the ghost- theory. The sympathetic principle, on the other hand, which whether reflec- tively grasped or not, undoubtedly operates as a motive, I regard as the primary source of the attribution of nmana to the stone and to the fertility- rite that makes use of the stone; and therefore in such a context would term the underlying notion 'pre-animistic.' Whether animism goes back in time as far as, or even further than, the sympa- thetic principle is a consideration quite irrelevant to the issue whether in a given case the sympathetic principle preceded animism as a formative in-</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW i6r fluence. If the excavation of a Roman villa in Britain yielded a piece of pottery of purely British design dating from about the year 200 B.C., one would have no hesitation in describing it as 'pre- Roman '; and a critic who objected that Rome was founded in 753 B.c. would be wasting ink. Again, Professor Ridgeway attacks me for saying that primitive thought in regard to religion is relatively 'un- differentiated.' He calls attention to the complex nature-complex for us who know so little about it-of the social organisation of the Australian aborigines. He adds that the lower animals 'have in their own limited spheres a power of differentiation by sight, sound, and smell in matters vital to them utterly unknown to civilised men, though found in some degree in such races as the Australians, whose powers in tracking men and animals is [sic] too well known to need elabora- tion.' He concludes: ' Dr. Marett's hypothesis is therefore refuted by well- established facts.' But these facts are beside the point. The question is whether the thought is differentiated, whether the principle or ground of dif- ferentiation is not merely felt but understood. Plato deems the dog a philosopher, but the most philosophic of dogs never tried to think out his world of smells. As for the Australian, I have taken a lesson from a native in the art of throwing the boomerang, and it was exactly the same experience as being coached ingolf bya very illiterate Scotch caddie. The aboriginal expert obviously had the ' how' of the matter, but he was quite unable to impart it by means of a 'why.' But I fear that Professor Ridge- way will run riot among such psycho- logical niceties like a bull in a china shop. I wonder, however, that, con- sidering the nature of his own special topic, he is not more in sympathy with mygeneral psychological position, which I have tried to put in a phrase by say- ing that the typical savage dances out his religion rather than thinks it out. Moreover, I am ready to make an ad- mission, if it be of any use to him. I certainly regard mana as a vague notion, since it stands for wonder-workingpower as displayed indiscriminately by men, NO. CCLIX, VOL. XXx. things, actions, and conditions, without making it clear whether the power is good or bad, personal or impersonal, mediated or automatic. On the other hand, I hold that there are primitive ways of conceiving 'soul'-Wundt has dealt at length with some of them- that are just as vague, and therefore, as far as the argument from vagueness goes, may be just as primitive. So much for Professor Ridgeway's attack on mana, unless it be that it likewise comes within the sweep of the comprehensive judgment that forms his peroration. Having exploded the first principles of the anthropologists, in- cluding mine, and denounced the doc- trines of the origin of Greek and Hindu Tragedy founded upon them, he prophe- sies as follows: ' And no less futile will be any other theories of their origin which hereafter may be built upon the prin- ciple that Man starts from the Abstract and only later proceeds to the Concrete.' 'Concrete,' by the way, is about the last epithet one would have thought of applying to a ghost. Professor Ridge- way appears to mean, however, that a living man who by his concrete be- haviour acquires a reputation for mana will tend to be worshipped not only in life but also after death. Quite so. But things may similarly by their concrete behaviour acquire a reputation for mana. The Masai, for instance, prays to his medicine-man and to 'the Rain' (Engai) together, the balance of respect, if any, going to the Rain. Is 'the Rain' an abstraction ? If so, it is one that is hypostatised in the next shower that falls after the prayer for rain. So Calverley wrote an ode to the abstrac- tion 'Tobacco,' yet was careful to indicate the way of hypostatisation: Smith, take a fresh cigar! Jones, the tobacco-jar ! Here's to thee, Bacon! I cannot agree, therefore, that Professor Ridgeway has disposed once for all of John Barleycorn by pronouncing him abstract. The 'Eniautos Daimon' is in another class-a class by himself. I grant that he is something of a philo- sopheme, and smacks more of Cambridge than of Athens. I have come to the end of my space, L</page><page sequence="4">162 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW if not to the end of possible adversaria. One has naturally answered criticism with criticism. Professor Ridgeway is a 'bonny fighter,' and it is a pleasure to exchange blows with him. But I should like, by way of conclusion, to say how much anthropologists are likely to benefit from a book of this sort. The cult of the dead is a subject that hitherto has been sadly neglected. If, as it would seem, Sir James Frazer is about to corn pose another magnum opus on this very topic, so much the better. In the mean- time, since there exists this aching void in our anthropological literature, classi- cal scholars, who naturally look to the anthropologists to provide a conspectus of the facts, are almost bound to get the values wrong. Professor Ridge- way's 'euhemerism ' will help to make us realise that Man is worshipful at least as much as Nature. But, like the rest of us, he simplifies too much, and con- sequently exaggerates. He offers us a 'key to all mythologies,' and we need a whole bunch of such keys. Besides, he boasts to have 'proved to the full for the whole world' a theory resting on an induction that, if fairly searching as regards Asia, is miserably inadequate in regard to the rest of the primitive world. Four pages for Australia will hardly satisfy the anthropologists, nor would forty pages. So his book, like any other scientific book, marks a fresh beginning, rather than an end; but at least we may say of it,' Many will pass through, and science will be increased.' R. R. MARETT.
