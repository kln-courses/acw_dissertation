The settle- ment thus occupied an excellent strategic position on one of the Kishon fords, in close proximity to Tel Yoqne'am some 2 km away, the major site in the region, on which Tel Qashish was most probably dependent (Plan 1). The elongated mound (ca. 270 x 160 m) covers an area of about 1 0.7 acres (ca. 43 dunams) at the base of the tel (Plan 1 , Photos 1-3). The western half is about 5 m higher than the eastern half. The mound slopes steeply on all sides, except on the northeast, where the approach road to the site was probably located (Photos 1-2). Aharoni suggested that the site should be identified with Helkath, No. 112 on the list of Thutmose III (Aharoni 1959:119-122, 1979:163). Another possibility, which the authors prefer, is to identify it with Dabbesheth (Josh 19:11). A limited trial excavation was conducted at the site by Garstang in the 1920s. Two trial trenches sunk into the Photo 1. Tel Qashish: aerial view, looking west. Plan 1. Tel Qashish: location and excavation areas. 1</page><page sequence="43">INTRODUCTION Photo 2. Tel Qashish: aerial view, looking south (left, Area B; right, Area A). eastern and the western slopes of the tel yielded exclusively Early Bronze Age pottery (Garstang 1922:16-17). The site was surveyed in the 1950s by Giveon (1954:515-518), who reported finding pottery from the Middle Bronze Age to the Hellenistic period (Aharoni 1959:120, Pl. 15B). Another survey, conducted by Raban in the 1970s, confirmed Giveon 's findings (Raban 1982:6-9). The extensive archae- ological excavations at Tel Qashish began in 1978. The eight seasons of excavation (1978-1979, 1981-1985, 1987) were conducted under the auspices of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Israel Explo- ration Society. These excavations, directed by A. Ben-Tor, were part of the Yoqne'am Regional Project (Ben-Tor and Portugāli 1987:1-3) that included, in addition to Tel Qashish, the excavations conducted at Tel Qiri and Tel Yoqne'am, as well as a survey of the western Jezreel Valley (Portugāli 1982:170-188). A survey conducted at Tel Qashish prior to the excavations showed that it was relatively easy to reach the Iron and Late Bronze Age strata on the higher part of the tel. The Middle Bronze Age strata lay close to the surface at the center of the site, as were the Early Bronze Age strata in the lower part. Several preliminary reports of the excavation results have been published (Ben-Tor 1980; Ben-Tor, Portugāli, and Avissar 1981; Ben-Tor and Bonfil 1987/8; Bernick and Greenberg 1987/8; Ben-Tor 1993c: 1200-1203). THE EXCAVATIONS The site was substantially damaged during the 1948 war, when it served as a military post. Defensive positions and trenches crisscross the tel, and a cement bunker built at the highest point is still there today. Further damage was caused by annual plowing of the surface by farmers from the nearby agricultural settlement. As a result, the latest occupational remains, dating mainly from the Persian and Iron Ages, are only scarce and poorly preserved. These periods, however, are well represented at the nearby site of Yoqne'am, which was investigated by our team as part of the Yoqne'am Regional Project and will be described and discussed in detail in a forthcoming report ( Yoqne'am II), currently in preparation. In some places, even the Late Bronze Age remains were affected. The limited extent to which the archaeological remains were preserved and unearthed should be borne in mind when evaluating this report. On the other hand, given the small size of the site, the area excavated relative to its overall size is of significance. The extent of the Middle and Late Bronze Age remains at Tel Qashish is about 2</page><page sequence="44">INTRODUCTION Photo 3. Tel Qashish: aerial view, Areas A and B. three times greater than that excavated at Yoqne'am, relative to the overall size of the two sites. Furthermore, a significant portion of the excavated Bronze Age area at Yoqne'am is taken up by the site's fortification systems, whereas at Tel Qashish, most of the excavated area comprises domestic architecture. Thus, the results presented in this report are no less, and perhaps even more, representative of the overall picture of settlement than those of the neighboring site of Yoqne'am. The excavations were carried out mainly by students from the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and volunteers from overseas. Over the years, more than 150 volunteers participated in the excavations, most of them from the United Kingdom (through "Project 67") and the United States (mainly from the Criswell Bible Center in Dallas, Texas), as well as a group of theology students from Sweden and students from various institutions in Germany. The area supervisors were: H. Bernick- Greenberg, D. Esse, Y. Fleitman, M. Fleitman, B. Guz, R. Greenberg, and D. Ilan. The staff also included: Y. Portugāli (surveyor); R. Bonfil (preparation of plans and object drawings); G Laron, Z. Radovan and I. Sztulman (photographers); L. Bell, M. Sarig, S. Halbreich, and D. Weinblatt (object drawings); R. Uni (pottery restoration); M. Avissar, R. Ben-Dror and R. Bonfil (registrars); and S. Dahan (administrator). The following contributed to the editing and production of this volume: K. Ebert (translation), E. Sachar (editing), A. Pladot (layout), A. Marzel (typeset- ting), and the Old City Press (graphics and printing). The excavations received substantial assistance from the Soltam factory, in particular from S. Matri, Y. Ronen, and M. Bar-Uman (directors of the personnel department). Generous support was also received from the Yoqne'am Illit local authorities, in particular from I. Gavrieli, S. Leibo, and Y. Elkanati. The expedition was housed at the Hadassim elementary school of Yoqne'am Illit. Assistance was also provided by the National Parks Authority, in particular by S. Ben-David. Financial assistance for the data analysis, preparation of the report and final publication was granted by the Philip and Muriel Berman Center for Biblical Archaeology at the Hebrew University; the Doron Foundation, Tel Aviv; the Israel Academy of Sciences; and the Shelby White-Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications, New York. We are most grateful to all these individuals, institutions and foundations. 3</page><page sequence="45">INTRODUCTION THE EXCAVATION REPORT As mentioned above, the site of Tel Qashish consists of an upper and a lower part. The two areas of excavation, desig- nated "A" and "B," correspond to this division of the tel. The archaeological data are discussed in chronological order, from the earliest to the latest remains. Since the earliest remains were found mainly in the lower part of the site, in Area B, the discussion of each period begins with this area. The order is thus as follows: Area B: Early Bronze Age I- III Area A: Early Bronze Age II- III Area A: Middle Bronze Age-Persian Period Table 1 : Tel Qashish : stratigraphie sequence.

STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE The discussion begins with the presentation of the strati- graphic sequence of the remains from each period and the reasoning for the division into strata or phases. The architec- tural remains are dated by "key loci," with the accompanying ceramic assemblages presented in drawings, referred to as "figures" (Fig./Figs.). The figures are arranged by loci. The determination of sherd color follows the Munsell Soil Color Chart and the color designations give a range of colors defined on this basis. Most of the parallels for the vessels are presented in the tables accompanying the figures. The sites are designated in abbreviated form, as presented in the Site Reference List (pp. 00-00). Line drawings of the architectural remains and sections are designated "Plan" or "Section." Photographs of architec- tural remains, pottery and other finds are designated "Photo," and line drawings of pottery and other finds are designated "Fig." POTTERY TYPOLOGY The division of the ceramic assemblage into types follows the stratigraphie discussion. Two separate typologies were formulated for the Early Bronze Age, one for the EB I and the other for the EB II- III. The rationale for this division is that while the EB I assemblage clearly shows distinct types, which differ to a large extent from those of the rest of the EBA, no such clear-cut division was observed for the ceramic types of the EB II and the EB III. One typological classification for these two periods enabled us to follow the development of types over time and to determine the more subtle differences between the ceramic assemblages of each period. The same reasoning led us to formulate a single typology for the ceramic assemblages of the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, which again enabled us to observe the development of each of the types over time and to determine the differ- ences between and characteristics of each of these two periods. At the end of each of the typology discussions, the sherd- count tables are appended, presenting the quantitative occur- rence of each of the types throughout the stratigraphie sequence. The rise and/or decline in the popularity of each type may often be of chronological significance. 4</page><page sequence="46">PART I THE EARLY BRONZE AGE</page><page sequence="47">CHAPTER 1 TEL QASHISH AND THE JEZREEL VALLEY IN THE EARLY BRONZE AGE Sharon Zuckerman Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem Tel Qashish is located in the narrowest part of the western Jezreel Valley, on the northern bank of the Kishon River (Plan 1). The river creates a natural barrier and could have served as an important transport route. The Kishon drains an area of more than 1000 km2 (Surveys 1956: Map 1/V) and its level can rise substantially in the winter, especially near Tel Qashish (Ganor 1967:178) (Photo 1). The location of Tel Qashish on the "knee" of the Kishon is strategically advanta- geous and probably contributed to the initial settlement and to the continuous occupation of the site from the fourth until the first millennium BCE. The site is located in close prox- imity to the southwestern entrance to the Jezreel Valley (through Wadi Milh) and to its western access to the coastal plain and the Acco Valley (Ben-Artzi 1993:4). These two routes were probably already known and used during the EB IB. Tel Qashish is the only excavated site in the Jezreel Valley that has a continuous occupation sequence from the EB IB through the EB II and EB III. The few Chalcolithic sherds (Fig. 1) may indicate an earlier occupation at the site. It is also one of the few sites in the area that was not deserted during the transition from the EB I to the EB II (Raban 1982:19; Esse 1991:146-152). Thus, the history of occupa- tion at the site can shed light on the processes of agglomera- tion and urbanization that took place during the third millennium BCE within the Jezreel Valley and in northern Israel as a whole. ECONOMY AND SUBSISTENCE Little can be said about the subsistence strategies of the inhabitants of Tel Qashish during the Early Bronze Age. The climate of the area was probably much the same as today's, with an annual rainfall of ca. 600 mm (Surveys 1956) and temperatures ranging from 10-12°C in January to 26-28°C in August, suggesting good conditions for agriculture (Liphschitz 1989: Table 1). Plant remains from this period include olive wood and pits, terebinth, and oak, all repre- senting the natural Mediterranean arboreal environment (see Chapter 26). The EB I edible plant remains include, besides the olive, also wheat, barley, and vetch seeds. These crops were probably grown in the vicinity of the site. All the species, except for vetch seeds, were also found in EB II and EB III loci. No grape-pips were found in Early Bronze Age strata at Tel Qashish. The importance of agricultural activities is further demon- strated by the lithic assemblage recovered in the Early Bronze Age strata, of which sickle blades comprise 40% (see Chapter 23). Signs of their intensive use, including sickle gloss on both edges and heavy continuous retouching and sharpening, attest to their relative value. TEL QASHISH IN THE JEZREEL VALLEY Throughout most periods, the majority of the Jezreel Valley sites are located on the edges of the valley and not at its center. This is probably due to drainage problems creating significant soil instability on the valley bed, the possible existence of seasonal swamps, and the difficulty of defending sites situated in the middle of the valley against human threat. These conditions existed in the Jezreel Valley well into the 19th century CE, as reported by several trav- elers (Schor 1993) and to some extent still apply today (Dan 1983:102, 106; Ben-Artzi 1993). A reconstruction of the area exploited by the inhabitants of Tel Qashish during the Early Bronze Age can be suggested on the basis of survey results and a theoretical framework proposed for a different period (Portugāli 1984). The map drawn by Portugāli (Ibid.: Fig. 1) relates to the Iron Age, a period that had a more advanced level of technology and a more complex social organization than the Early Bronze Age. This model, however, may be valid for earlier periods as well, considering the similar environmental conditions and the small size of the settlement at Tel Qashish in both periods. Most of the sites on Portugāli 's map were already inhab- ited during the EB I. These are Tel Tiv'on (Raban 1982: Site 31), Tel Risim (Ibid.: Site 42), Tel Shem (Ibid.: Site 38), Tel Shimron (Ibid.: Site 83), and Kh. Seifan (Ibid.: Sites 66-67). Each of these settlements, located north of the Kishon River, probably exploited a surrounding area of 2-3 km (Portugāli 1984). The absence of larger cities in the settlement pattern of the village-based society of the EB I should also be taken into account. During the subsequent EB II, the number of sites diminishes and the sustaining area of each settlement probably increases in extent, a trend that becomes more pronounced during the EB III. A similar development occurred at sites in the Hula Valley (Greenberg 1996a; 1996b). Recent studies dealing mainly or partially with the Early Bronze Age in northern Palestine stress the regional char- acter of occupation development during this period. The Hula valley sites represent a system of urban development and hierarchy in the exploitation of land and other resources that begins in the EB II and ends at some point during the EB III. Tel Dan is considered to have played an important 7</page><page sequence="48">CHAPTER 1 role as a central site during both these periods (Greenberg 1987:177-183; 1996a; 1996b). Esse conducted similar research on the status of Beth Yerah within its regional context (1991). He views the site as an important center in northern Israel that played a major role in the inter-regional trade system of the hill country and the valley plains, with each region distributing specific agricultural products (Ibid. :98- 1 01). Maeir also briefly discusses the develop- ment of Early Bronze Age settlement in the central Jordan Valley (1997). The Jezreel Valley, as a well-defined region, is a possible candidate for such an analysis (partially attempted by Esse [1991]). The existing database for Early Bronze Age sites in the valley, however, is limited. THE JEZREEL VALLEY IN THE EARLY BRONZE AGE I Most of the information concerning the Jezreel Valley in the EB I derives from surveys conducted in the area. These include Raban's survey of the western part of the valley, published in the Nahalal (1982) and Mishmar ha-'Emeq (1999) maps, and Zori's survey of the eastern part (1977). Raban identified 20 EB I sites (1982: Table on p. VII), most of them represented by meager assemblages of sherds. The southeastern part of the valley (Raban 1 999) contains 35 sites attributed to this period (Esse 1 99 1 : 1 50, Table 5 ; Raban 1999:27). This number is similar to the number of sites that existed in the area in the Chalcolithic period, in contrast to the dramatic increase in the number of sites from the Chalcolithic to EB I periods observed in other areas (Esse 1991:143-146). Most of the EB I sites of the Jezreel Valley, except for four new sites in the Nahalal map (Joffe 1993:43) were built on previously settled Chalcolithic sites (Raban 1982: Table on p. VII). Thus, the settlement pattern in the western Jezreel Valley appears to have remained essentially the same in the transition from the Chalcolithic period to the Early Bronze Age. The break occurred some time before or during the transition from the EB IB to the EB II, when many small, unfortified sites were abandoned and fewer, more densely populated fortified sites appear (Esse 1991:146-152; Portugāli and Gophna 1993). Similar trends were observed in other regions during the same period (Gophna 1989). One of the major obstacles in interpreting the information on the EB I gained from these surveys is the fact that it does not provide a subdivision of the period. In most cases, the sites are designated "EB I," usually on the grounds of holemouth jars and Gray Burnished Ware (GBW) sherds found on the surface. None of the surveys distinguishes between the EB I sub-phases and it is therefore impossible to compare the settlement picture of the EB LA to that of the EB IB. A similar situation exists regarding the distinction between the EB II and the EB III (Esse 1991:129-130). In general, the EB I sites of the Jezreel Valley are unforti- fied and spread over a wide area close to the valley edges (Raban 1982). The settlement pattern is quite scattered and the main criteria for the establishment of a settlement appear to have been the proximity of a water source and the avail- ability of fertile soils, especially in the western parts of the valley. The valley bed itself may not have been settled because of the swampy conditions known to have existed there (Esse 1991:20). Thus, until modern times the fertile central part of the Jezreel Valley was probably not inten- sively settled and was rather used for agricultural activities, with settlements limited to its edges (Ben-Artzi 1993). Only a handful of sites with EB I remains have been exca- vated in the Jezreel Valley. These are Tel Qashish in the western part of the valley, 'En Shadud on one of the Kishon tributaries in its central part, the Hazorea cemetery on its southern border, Megiddo, which dominates the south- eastern entrance to the valley, and 'Afula. East of the 'Afula-Megiddo line is the Harod Valley, which is desig- nated as an independent geographical unit (Ben-Artzi 1993:10-11) and in many respects belongs in the Jordan Valley sphere in the EB I. At all of these sites the excavated EB I remains are dated to the EB IB sub-phase. Most of the other EB I sites are known only from the surveys conducted in the area (Raban 1982; 1999) and include Tel Tiv'on (Esse 1991 : Site 116), Tel Risim (Ibid.: Site 123), Tel Shem (Ibid.: Site 125), and Tel Shimron (Ibid.: Site 132). The total number of sites attributed to the EB I in these surveys is close to 100 (Esse 1991 : Table 5), although some of these attribu- tions should be treated with caution. THE JEZREEL VALLEY IN THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II AND III Unfortunately, very few EB II and EB III settlements in the Jezreel Valley are known. Excavated sites include Tel Qashish, 'Afilla (Sukenik 1948; Gal and Covello-Paran 1996), Megiddo (Loud 1948), and Tel Kishion (Arnon and Amiran 1 98 1 ; 1 993). Even for these sites, however, very few house and site plans are available. A complicated picture emerges for the two eastern Jezreel Valley sites of Megiddo and 'Afula. The existence of EB II remains at both sites is uncertain. Although the excavators attributed the initial fortification of Megiddo in Stratum XVIII to the EB II (Shipton 1939:47; Loud 1948), a detailed examination of the finds suggests an EB III dating for these activities and the subsequent strata (Esse 1991:76-83; Finkelstein and Ussishkin 2000:585-586). The nature of the EB II settlement, if there was one, is unknown. The situation at 'Afilla seems to be similar (Esse 1991 : 90-91), as does that at Tel Kishion in the northeastern part of the valley and Taanach to the south (Ibid.:92-97). Regarding the western Jezreel Valley, there is as yet no exact date for the Tel Shimron settlement, although this large, heavily fortified site (Raban 1982:69-76) must have been an important center during at least part of the third millennium BCE. Further- more, until the publication of material from the surveyed sites reported as having EB II sherds on the surface, such as Tel Shimron, Kh. Shabana, Mizpe Zebulun, Tel Risim, Tel Shem, Kh. Seifan, and others, the map of the western Jezreel Valley during this period remains virtually empty, except for Tel Qashish on its western edge. Though many other sites were noted in the surveys conducted in the various parts of the valley and its vicinity (Zori 1977; Raban 1982; Esse 1991), no architectural remains were reported. The problem of a precise dating for 8</page><page sequence="49">TEL QASHISH AND THE JEZREEL VALLEY IN THE EARLY BRONZE AGE these sites, especially those identified only in surveys, is acute (Esse 1991:130). A reconstruction of the settlement picture and its changes throughout the Early Bronze Age must be based on a definitive attribution of each stratum/site to a distinct period; inability to do so renders the entire recon- struction groundless (Portugāli and Gophna 1993; Finkelstein 1995). Most of the survey material that uses the designation "EB II- III" for site definition is of little value. The same applies to excavated sites with inadequate pottery publications, such as Megiddo (Engberg and Shipton 1934a; Guy 1938; Esse 1991:67-90). Much more information on EB II and EB III pottery assemblages has been published in recent years, and synthetic works are enabling us to begin to differentiate between the two periods (Greenberg 2000). Detailed regional studies illuminate the process of change in site size and distribution, reflecting changes in the economic and political status of the areas studied (Greenberg 1987 and 1 996b for the Hula Valley; Maeir 1 997 for the central Jordan Valley). Finkelstein proposes a political reconstruction of northern Canaan in the EB II as a system of peer-polities (1995:62, Fig. 1). Alternatively, Greenberg and Porat, based on their study of the distribution of metallic ware, suggest the polit- ical scenario of a large, culturally homogeneous entity (1996). Again, such a picture is difficult to prove in the absence of excavated sites that can be securely attributed to this period. It is, therefore, difficult to propose a political reconstruction for the Jezreel Valley, but the detailed analysis of the occupation remains and ceramic assemblage of Tel Qashish may serve as a starting point. 9</page><page sequence="50">CHAPTER 2 THE STRATIGRAPHY OF THE EARLY BRONZE AGE I Amnon Ben-Tor and Ruhama Bonfil Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem PRE-EARLY BRONZE AGE A considerable number of flint implements were found in L. 575 in Squares AH-AI/12, directly on bedrock (Fig. 156:2, 10-12). These are not associated with any archi- tectural remains, and it is impossible to determine whether they were in situ or part of a fill. Some can be dated to the Pre- Pottery Neolithic period (see Chapter 23). A few isolated sherds dated to the Chalcolithic period were found in various parts of the site (Fig. 1). The origin of these sherds, whether from a small-scale settlement on the tel or elsewhere, remains unknown. THE EARLY BRONZE AGE The chronological definition of the EB I phase, based on its typical ceramic assemblages, is fairly simple. The EB II and III ceramic assemblages, in contrast, are difficult to differen- tiate. In the following stratigraphie discussion, therefore, the EB I strata are designated as such, while the later Early Bronze Age strata are designated EB II- III. A more precise attribution to one or the other of these two phases of the Early Bronze Age on the basis of a comparative study of the ceramic assemblages attributable to the different strata is attempted in Chapter 4. The spatial relationship between the remains of the EB I and the subsequent EB II- III fortification wall and related elements is shown in Plan 4 (P. 30). EB I sherds were scattered over a large area, both on the tel and in the surrounding fields (Photo 4), indicating that the EB I settlement at Qashish was larger than any of the subse- quent settlements at the site. In the upper part of the tei, Area A (Plan 1), the excavation was not deep enough to reach the Photo 4. Tel Qashish: aerial view (left, Area A; right, Area B). 10</page><page sequence="51">THE STRATIGRAPHY OF THE EARLY BRONZE AGE I EB I strata. However, the fill below the Early Bronze Age fortification wall in Area A (L. 457 and L. 463) contained exclusively EB I sherds (Fig. 2). The excavation reached EB I walls and floors, built directly on bedrock, only in Area B, in Squares AH-AI/12-13. THE EARLY BRONZE AGE I: AREA B Stratum XV (Plan 2) The remnants of three structures were attributed to this stratum. The two eastern buildings, L. 566B and L. 605+L. 622A, belong to the early phase (Stratum XVB), while L. 620 most probably belongs to the later phase (Stratum XVA). For both phases of Stratum XV, the L. 566A and L. 566B building is the best preserved (Photo 5). The building is of the Rounded-Corners (RC) type well known in this period in Israel as well as Lebanon (see the discussion of EB I architec- ture in Chapter 3). Two floors were found in this building, the entrance to which is from the south. The earlier L. 566B, as well as the burial (L. 616) beneath it - of an adult male around twenty years old (Chapter 24) - belong to Stratum XVB. The later L. 566A floor, covering both the L. 566B floor and the threshold in W. 339, is attributed to the later phase, Stratum XVA. The pottery found on both floors is dated to the EB I (Figs. 3-4).

One possibility is that the building on the east cuts W. 337, though this is difficult to determine. W. 337 appears to be associated with W. 338 and both buildings are founded directly on bedrock. Two floors (L. 622A and L. 622B; Figs. 5-6) were discerned in the narrow space between W. 337 and W. 338, corresponding to floors L. 566A and L. 566B in the eastern building. The function of this area is difficult to explain. L. 568 (Figs. 7-8) is a fill laid on bedrock to the southwest of W. 337 (Photo 6) and sealed by Stratum XIV walls. The group of complete vessels attributed to this fill (Photo 7) might hint at the existence of a floor in this area, tentatively correlated with floor L. 622B inside the building. Only the later phase of a third building (L. 620), defined by the corner of W. 359 and W. 360, was excavated. No floor was found in this building, perhaps because the excavation here did not penetrate deep enough. Since both buildings to its south have two clear-cut phases, it seems that a similar situation may have existed in the L. 620 building, and the excavated phase was therefore attributed to the later phase, Stratum XVA, paralleling L. 566A and L. 622A.

The evidence for this is twofold. First, the elevation of the base of W. 3 1 3 is higher than that of the other two walls, and second, W. 313 seals floor L. 531, which yielded, among other vessels (Fig. 9), a holemouth jar (Fig. 9:18) and a high-looped cup (Fig. 9:12; Photo 10). Floor L. 532, where a bow-rim storage jar was found (Fig. 10: 1 1 ; Photo 11), belongs to the earlier phase, together with floor L. 531 (Section A-A). Since no direct connection exists between these three walls and the remains in Squares AH-AI/12-13 to the east, the stratigraphie relationship between these two complexes could not be established. Because of the curvilinear nature of these walls, which is more similar to the walls of Stratum XV than the Strata XIV-XIII walls, we decided to attribute these walls to the former stratum. The differences in elevation between these two sets of walls can be easily explained by the fact that the walls in Squares AF-AG/12-13 are situated higher on the slope than the walls in Squares AH-AI/12-13.

Walls 320 and 325B and their associated floors L. 534 and L. 553 (Photo 12) were attributed to Stratum XIV (Figs. 13 and 14, respectively). Walls 312 and 325 A were attributed to Stratum XIII. No floors associated with these later walls were discerned. W. 328, southeast of the W. 325A remains, may also belong to Stratum XIII. Photo 12. EB I walls (Stratum XIV). Fig. 13.

Area B: Superposition of Strata XV-XII. 30</page><page sequence="71">CHAPTER 3 THE EARLY BRONZE AGE I ARCHITECTURE Sharon Zuckerman Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem Remains of at least four architectural units attributed to various phases of the EB I were excavated in Area B (Plans 2-3). The limited exposure does not permit a reconstruction of all these units, but some observations can be made even on the basis of these meager remains. Though parts of possibly straight walls (Plan 3) represent the later phases of EB I occu- pation at the site, Strata XIV-XIII, no coherent plan of the area can be formulated for this period. However, a different picture emerges for Stratum XV, the main phase of the EB I (Plan 2). Three walls were excavated in Squares AF-AG/12-13 (Photo 9). Two (W. 314 and W. 315) are curvilinear and probably belong to two different units. L. 532 is a floor asso- ciated with the interior of W. 315, while L. 531 is the area between the units. The area between the two walls seems to have been open. Curvilinear architecture, in many varia- tions, is well known in EB I Palestine, especially in the northern part of the country (Braun 1 989). It has been impos- sible thus far to reconstruct the plan of the fragmentary examples at Tel Qashish as a part of an oval, sausage-shaped or even round building. The remains of two buildings, located to the east of the aforementioned walls on the edge of the excavation area, also belong to Stratum XV. The first, possibly a rectilinear room of unknown size, is represented by the corner formed by W. 359 and W. 360 (Squares AH-AI/11-12). The walls are similar in width to the other walls attributed to this stratum (see below). No floor level was reached within the room, and its attribution to this stratum is based on its relation to the unit to its south, separated from the first by a narrow space, 60 cm wide (Photo 5). This is thç western part of a building, oriented east-west (Squares AH-AI/12-13). Most of the building lies outside the excavated area, but the western room is defined by all four walls (W. 340, W. 355, W. 338, and W. 339). The three outer walls of the room are ca. 60 cm wide and preserved to five stone courses. The width of the inner wall, W. 340, is unknown. Though all the walls are straight, the two corners differ from that of the northern building in being angled on the inside and rounded on the outside. The entrance to this room is in its southern wall. A curvilinear wall (W. 337 and W. 354) is attached to the southwestern corner of the RC building from the west. The area between the two walls is ca. 1 m wide and was probably used simultaneously with the room, as suggested by the two floors, L. 605 and L. 622B. Thus, a close connec- tion exists between the rectilinear, curvilinear, and RC archi- tectural traditions even in this limited area of a single excavation square. It should be noted that the construction method of laying stones in a herringbone fashion is unknown in the EB I strata at Tel Qashish, but appears in a number of walls in the EB II and EB III strata (see below). Walls with rounded corners also appear in later Early Bronze Age strata at Tel Qashish, for instance in various rooms attributed to Stratum XIIB (Plan 7). Some of these have rounded corners from within and on the outside and thus cannot be considered as representing the same phenom- enon; examples are W. 357 and W. 346, as well as W. 243, attributed to Stratum XIIE in Area A (Plan 1 3). Rooms with angled inner corners and rounded outer ones are common in Stratum XIIB (Room L. 603 and L. 609, L. 606, L. 279, and W. 283) and continue in use through Stratum XIIA (Plan 9). These are part of the newly fortified site in the EB II. The width of these walls is similar to that of the EB I walls, but the plans of the buildings are different. The rooms are usually larger and arranged next to one another on each side of an alley between the buildings. This phenomenon of continuity in architectural tradition has also been observed at other sites (see below). RC buildings have been recognized at several Early Bronze Age sites in Palestine and represent one of the diverse architectural traditions that characterize this period (Braun 1989:14-16; Ben-Tor 1992b:60~62; Golani 1999). The following discussion relates only to "genuine" RC buildings, i.e., those with corners that are right-angled on the inside and rounded on the outside.1 Other types, such as the buildings at 'En Shadud with rounded corners on the inside and straight corners on the outside (Braun 1985:67, Pl. IVA) or with two rounded end-walls (Ibid.: Fig. 28:3), are not considered as belonging to the same group of carefully planned buildings. The RC buildings are a distinct phenom- enon, in terms both of underlying rules of construction and of chronological and geographical range. However, although this type of building is recognized in the literature, none of the published examples can contribute to the study of specific associated artifacts. In this respect, the Stratum XV building at Tel Qashish, with its two superimposed floors, can provide ceramic material that is typologically and chro- nologically useful (Figs. 3-4). Before attempting a reconstruction of the Tel Qashish example, buildings belonging to this group from other sites are described below, in chronological order. 1. Byblos The earliest examples are attributed to the Enéolithique Ancien or Stage IIA in the sequence of the site (Dunand 31</page><page sequence="72">CHAPTER 3 1950:588; 1973:169, Pl. I). The buildings are usually one- roomed, either rectangular or almost square. The average size of the rooms is 3*8 m. The width of the walls ranges between 45 and 90 cm and is usually around 70 cm. They are built of large fieldstones and some of the floors are stone- paved (Dunand 1973: Pl. 7a-c). A special feature, believed by the excavator to be an imported tradition, is the hearths in the rooms (Ibid.: 171). In the next phase, the Enéolithique Récent, a change in the plan of these buildings can be discerned. An inner wall divides many of the buildings, generally at the one-third point. The entrance to the building is usually in one of the longer walls (Ibid.: 218). Only towards the end of the period do oval and apsidal, and even- tually round, buildings appear (Ibid.:222).2 Thus, the first appearance of the RC tradition is contemporary with the Chalcolithic and EB I in Palestine (Braun 1 989: n. 38; Stager 1992: Fig. 16, Table 1). In the following period, the "Première Installation Urbaine" (Stage III), an entirely different architectural picture emerges, with buildings consisting of several interconnected rooms around a common courtyard (Dunand 1950:593). 2. Megiddo The RC building attributed to Stage V on the eastern slope of the tel was published only in an aerial photograph (Engberg and Shipton 1934a: Fig. 2; Guy 1938: PL 2). The attribution to Stage V is based on the stratigraphie relationship to the apsidal building and its related units, which seem to seal the northeastern wall of the RC building. The walls of the building are built of two rows of large stones with smaller stones in between, and a possible mudbrick superstructure. Bonn reconstructs the size of the building, based on the grid shown above the aerial photo- graph, as 8.75x5.25 m (1976:106-107). The entrance could have been located in the northern wall (not shown in the photograph), thus making the building a long house. None of the other walls appears to include the possible remains of an entrance, unless the few stones rising above the level of the western wall are taken as the remains of a doorpost. Braun notes the problematic nature of the internal walls shown in the photograph (1989:4, Fig. 2), which may have been benches, dividing walls or even earlier walls. The internal wall in the northern part of the building probably separated it into two rooms, which might suggest a plan similar to the Tel Qashish example. The pottery attributed to Stage V is typical of the Jezreel Valley EB IB assemblage. It includes GBW bowls of G.E. Wright's Types 3 and 4 (1958), holemouth jars, grain- wash decoration, thumb-indented ledge handles, bow-rim storage jars, high-looped cups, gourd jars, and spouted vessels (Engberg and Shipton 1934a: Chart). Another RC building excavated on the tel, Building 41 13, is attributed to Stratum XVIII, the first fortified city at Megiddo (Loud 1948: Fig. 391). Though only one corner of the building was preserved, its original large size is apparent. The walls are at least 1.5 m wide and its excavated part measures at least 5*5 m. The rounded corner is clearly visible in the photograph (Ibid.: Fig. 147). The construction technique is similar to that of the Stage V building, with two rows of stones filled in with smaller ones. The building was interpreted as a temple (Dunayevsky and Kempinski 1973:14, Fig. 5), but there is no basis for this assumption other than its location in the "sacred area". Its relation to the rounded Installation 4034 is problematic, as is the recon- struction of the pillar later suggested by Kempinski (1989a: Fig. 14). Though no pottery from the building itself has been published, a few sherds from the area to its north belong to the EB II repertoire (Loud 1948: Pis. 100:9, 104:6, 105:12). The problematic nature of the remains attributed to Stratum XVIII and their dating should be borne in mind (Esse 1991:74-83). 3. Tel Megadim Recent excavation of this coastal site has yielded some archi- tectural remains attributed to the EB IB, among which at least three RC buildings were identified (Golani 1999:126; S.R. Wolff, personal communication). These are almost identical to the RC building at Tel Qashish in both size and general plan.3 4. Tel Asawir The recent excavations at this settlement site (E. Yannai 1999 and personal communication) have revealed two strata attributed to the EB I. Thin- walled oval buildings attached to one another characterize the earlier Stratum III. The pottery assemblage is typical of the EB IA, including GBW bowls of GE. Wright's Type 1. The architecture of the subsequent Stratum II presents a different plan: larger rectangular build- ings, some of which have rounded corners (Golani 1999: Fig. 3:1-2), replace the oval buildings. The pottery assem- blage is typical of the EB IB and is similar to that of the Jezreel Valley sites, including GBW bowls of GE. Wright's Types 3 and 4. 5. Qiryat Ata At this site four RC structures were attributed to Stratum II, dated to "the very end of the EB IB" (Golani 1995b:31; 1999:125-126). A number of rectangular buildings were also part of the plan of the site in this stratum (Golani 1995a: Fig. 29). One RC structure seals an oval building attributed to an earlier phase within the EB I (Golani and Braun 1992:99; Braun 1996a: Fig. V.E.4/1). 6. Tel Kitan An RC building was exposed here in Stratum VII, the first EB I stratum following the Chalcolithic settlement (Eisenberg 1993). The building, not fully excavated, measures 3 m wide and 7.5 m long up to the excavation limit. In contrast to the buildings at other sites, which are constructed of stone, the Tel Kitan example is built of mudbrick, which necessitated the special manufacture of rounded-corner bricks. The room contained benches and a stone column base; another room, with straight walls and a number of installations, was attached to it. A narrow lane separated this from a second building, with a possible court- yard. The entire area is interpreted as a part of a densely built settlement. Stratum VII at Tel Kitan is dated to the EB IB, based on a ceramic assemblage consisting of pithoi and storage jars decorated with grain-wash, and red-burnished and net-painted vessels (Ibid.:880). 32</page><page sequence="73">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE I ARCHITECTURE 7. Aphek The first fortified settlement at Aphek was attributed to the end of the EB I/ beginning of the EB II (Kochavi and Beck 1985:25). It includes a large building in Area G, measuring 14&gt;&lt;7 m, with 1 m wide walls. The building is reported to be rectangular with rounded outer corners, constructed of a mudbrick superstructure on a stone founda- tion. Between this building and the broad-room houses related to it is a pebble-paved street. The plan of the building was not published. 8. Me'ona A segment of the city wall with a semicircular tower and part of a domestic quarter were attributed to Stratum I, the upper stratum uncovered at the site (Braun 1996b: Plan 1). The rooms are rectangular broad-room (Ibid.: Room 2), almost square (Ibid.: Room 1), or somewhat irregular (Ibid.: Room 3, L. 120) in shape. The plan shows one rounded corner, the southeastern corner of Room 1. The buildings were constructed on top of a fill laid above an earlier occupation level (Ibid.:9). Stratum I is dated by the associated pottery to the EB II (Ibid.: 17), and the earlier occupation should probably be dated to a late phase of the EB I (Ibid.:22). 9. 'Ai Two buildings belonging to this group were found in the lower city at 'Ai. The first, House 238, was excavated during the initial excavations of the site (Marquet-Krause 1949:33-34). It was taken to be the eastern room of a large building that also comprised rooms 195B and 198 (Ibid.: Plan C) and was attributed to the two earliest phases of the Early Bronze Age. Column bases were set in the earthen floors of Room 1 95B and House 238. While the quality of the building technique was mentioned, the rounded corners were not noted. Following the renewed excavations at 'Ai, the remains from the earliest phases of the Early Bronze Age were published aňd discussed (Vagner 1972). In this discussion, House 238 is treated as part of a large building that is attrib- uted to the same phase as the postern gate (Ibid. :9). This attri- bution is problematic, however, because it would mean that the only entryway to the inner part of the city would have been via a very narrow space between the southwestern corner of House 238 and the rounded tower. Vagner describes the architectural details, such as column bases and the difference in the height of the floors in the rooms, but does not mention the rounded corners. He suggests that the complex had a public function, probably connected to the city gate (Ibid.: 11). Some curvilinear walls are attributed to the same phase (Ibid.: Fig. 6).4 The final publication of the results of the excavations at the site presents a different picture of the stratigraphy of Site L, the postern gate area and the rooms in its vicinity (Callaway 1980:81). The postern gate, as well as House 238, which is now identified as an RC room, are attributed to Stage III, and Rooms 195B and 198 are assigned to the later Stage IV (Ibid.: 118-1 19, Fig. 13). Both the plan (Ibid.: Fig. 49) and the photograph (Ibid.: Fig. 57) show the corner of House 238 as being very close to the city wall, with no space between them. Callaway ascribes the RC building to the same architectural tradition as the rounded towers and sees the curvilinear buildings as deriving from the local late Chalcolithic tradition, assimilated and continued by the EB I newcomers (Ibid.:81).5 House 238, which was attributed by Callaway to Stage III at 'Ai and dated to the EB IC in his terminology, has been reassigned to the EB II (Esse 1984:323-325). The pottery found in the room, published by Vagner (1972: Fig. 8), clearly belongs to the EB II. The repertoire includes hemi- spherical bowls, platters with triangular and elongated rims, storage jars with a flaring rim and ledge handles. The RC building at 'Ai, like that at Aphek and Megiddo Building 4 1 1 3 , is part of the new fortified city established at the end of the EB I or beginning of the EB II. Its size (4x8 m) and the width of its walls (almost 1.5 m) hint at an important, possibly public, function. It was later incorporated into a larger building, with the addition of two large rooms. A related building was found further to the east, in Area G, on the lower terrace of the Early Bronze Age city (Callaway 1980: Fig. 2). The southeastern rounded corner of the partly eroded House MN was preserved (Ibid.: Figs. 59, 105). This is a smaller building, 3 x7.5 m, with 80 cm wide walls. In plan it is a broad-room, which contained a hearth during the earlier phase. The construction technique is cruder than that of House 238 and the structure was probably domestic in nature. The first phase of the building is attributed to Phase III and it was rebuilt on the same lines in Phase IV (Ibid.:81-83). An additional reuse of this house, together with its rounded corner, is suggested to have occurred in Phase VI, well within the EB III (Ibid.: 158). However, the evidence for this rebuilding, a few large stones preserved on top of a Phase IV wall (Ibid.: Fig. 14; cf. the photograph in Fig. 58), is not convincing, and no floor associated with the supposed later phase was found. Thus, the two RC buildings at 'Ai attributed to Phase III should be dated to the very beginning of the EB II. DISCUSSION The RC building tradition is a phenomenon with a wide chro- nological and geographical range, despite the small number of examples published. The earliest appearance of this type is in the fifth millennium at Enéolithique Ancien Byblos. The tradition continues there into the fourth millennium, the Enéolithique Récent strata, side by side with the oval and round buildings. The earliest RC buildings in Palestine are more or less contemporary with the final phase of this tradi- tion on the Lebanese coast. The buildings of Megiddo Stage V, Tel Qashish, Qiryat Ata, Tel Megadim, Asawir, and Tel Kitan are all dated to the EB IB. Like their northern predecessors, these buildings are part of the unfortified villages that characterize this period. Some of the structures are freestanding independent rooms, while others are attached to other rooms. Other architectural traditions, mainly the rectangular and the curvilinear traditions with all their sub-types, existed alongside the RC buildings (Braun 1989). At a later stage, but still within the EB I or at the very beginning of the EB II, this architectural tradition spread beyond the Jezreel and the Jordan Valleys. It is found at sites like Megiddo and Me'ona, as well as at southern sites like 33</page><page sequence="74">CHAPTER 3 Aphek and 'Ai. At this stage the RC buildings are part of planned fortified settlements, the first cities of the EB II. It appears that the RC tradition should be viewed as a distinct phenomenon and not as a "kind of hybrid, a melding of the curvilinear and rectilinear traditions which seems to have developed through contemporaneousness" (Braun 1989:16, n. 58; see also Braun 1996a: 121; Golani 1999:129-130). The tradition appears fully fledged at Byblos, earlier than the curvilinear and round buildings, and first appears only later in northern Canaan.6 This is one of many aspects of the relationship between the Lebanese coast and northern Canaan in the EB I (Ben-Tor 1989). The dynamics and routes of this influence, however, are not yet fUlly understood. There seems to be no functional justification for the adoption of the RC technique, though G.R.H. Wright (1985:29) explains it as "...an effort at a stable construction, to avoid 'angle collapse'...," and Wachman (1959:41) suggests that the purpose of rounding the corners, both inside and outside, was to reduce wind pressure or to facilitate transport through the narrow streets. Other reasons for the use of this building technique may be suggested. The appearance of RC buildings in Palestine and of GBW of the later types, mainly G.E. Wright's Type 3, can be directly linked (Braun 1989:16, Table 3). The two phenomena are found together at Megiddo Stage V, Tel Qashish (where more than half of the bowl repertoire found inside the RC building and in its vicinity belong to this family), Qiryat Ata, Tel Megadim (S.R. Wolff, personal communication) and Tel Asawir (E. Yannai, personal communication). These buildings should be viewed as part of the "GBW horizon," much like the 'En Shadud building with its curvilinear walls (Braun 1985). Tel Kitan is the only site at which no GBW sherds were found in the context of an RC building. This absence, however, does not necessarily reflect a chronological difference and might be a regional phenomenon. The Jezreel Valley seems to be the origin in Canaan of this architectural tradition, which infiltrated other regions of northern Palestine in the later part of the EB IB and beginning of the EB II. Several scholars have dealt with the factors influencing the form of domestic architecture (Rapoport 1969; Sanders « 1990). Seven factors are thought to determine the form and organization of architecture, among them natural features, such as topography and climate; economic features, such as available materials, resources and technology; and cultural features, such as designated function and behavioral conven- tions (Sanders 1990:44-46, Table 5.1). Assuming that at a given site in a given period all natural and economic factors are more or less the same, the causes for any clear architec- tural diversity should be sought in the cultural category, which includes the function of the building and the loosely defined term "cultural conventions." This can be applied to the RC buildings of the EB I. The fact that, at this point, there is no plausible functional explanation for the technique of building houses with rounded corners and that all the build- ings seem to have a domestic function indicates that cultural conventions were the determining factor. Furthermore, contemporaneous buildings were built according to other traditions at the same sites, indicating that the explanation does not lie in differences in the other conditions mentioned above. This may imply that the inhabitants of these sites had different cultural conventions, reflecting the diverse society of the EB I. The RC building convention initially had regional bound- aries. At the very end of the EB IB or beginning of the EB II, these boundaries dissolve and the buildings are found at sites outside their core area. At some point during the EB II, the tradition is abandoned altogether. This process suggests a connection between the RC building tradition and a distinct group of people that constituted a component of the segmented EB I society, but retained some of its cultural affinities with other areas (in this case, the Lebanese coast). The agglomeration of the population into larger and denser fortified sites in the EB II blurred the previous regional uniqueness of this tradition. It should be noted that in contrast to the small RC buildings of the EB I, the EB II examples of this type at Megiddo, Aphek, and 'Ai are larger and more spacious structures, interpreted by their excavators as public buildings connected in some way with the fortifica- tion systems. This suggestion could perhaps form the basis for an evaluation of the part played by the "GBW/RC- building people" in the process of transition from village to city in northern Canaan (see also Golani 1999). FOOTNOTES 1 A number of the buildings discussed by Golani (1 999) seem not to belong to this group, either because their reconstruction is problematic (Rosh ha-Niqra) or because their corners are neither sharply angled on the inside and nor clearly rounded on the outside (Jericho, the Palmahim Quarry, Room 1 at Tel Halif Terrace). 2 Since the stratigraphy of Byblos is problematic, this develop- ment is difficult to prove (Braun 1989:8). 3 I wish to thank the excavator, Samuel R. Wolff, for his kind permission to cite this parallel. 4 Although these walls are not necessarily apsidal, as claimed by Vagner (1972:12-13). 5 See, however, the justified reservations expressed by Braun (1989). 6 A Yarmukian "megaron" building with at least one true rounded corner was excavated at En-Ghazal in Jordan (Kafafi and Rollefsonl995: Fig. 2). This building, however, is unique and therefore cannot be treated as a significant predecessor of the Late Chalcolithic-EB I group of buildings. Nevertheless, other possible connections between EB I and Late Neolithic material culture have already been suggested, for example, the tradition of dark burnished pottery (Miroschedji 1971:120-123). 34</page><page sequence="75">CHAPTER 4 THE EARLY BRONZE AGE I POTTERY Sharon Zuckerman Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem TYPOLOGY The following discussion defines the vessel typology used in the analysis of the pottery assemblage from the EB I strata at Tel Qashish (Figs. 2-16). This discussion relates to the two main EB I strata, Stratum XV and Stratum XIV. Since the upper occupation phase attributed to the EB I, Stratum XIII, consists of two walls lacking an associated floor, no pottery from this stratum can be included in the ceramic sequence of Tel Qashish. EB I pottery from the construction fills of the EB II- III city-wall, designated "Post-XIII," is discussed only as an addition to the principal types from the main strata (Figs. 15-16). The types were defined mainly on the basis of form (in most cases of the rims) and only in certain cases of ware. Each type is described and its range of appearance within the EB I sequence is noted. Parallels from other sites are presented in the discussion of the pottery from individual strata. The references for specific vessels appear in the tables accompa- nying the figures of pottery grouped according to loci. BOWLS (B) Fig. 17 Type B I: Shallow bowls (Fig. 17: 1-3). This type is charac- terized by slightly curved walls. The rims are simple, flat- tened or sharp. In most cases, the type is not slipped. Bowls that could not securely be defined as belonging to one of the other types are included in this category. These bowls are common in Strata XV and XIV. « Type B II: Deep bowls. Two sub-types were distinguished: Type B Ha: Straight-sided bowls (Fig. 17:4). These bowls have straight walls and simple rims. Though most are red-slipped, some are plain and lack decoration. The bowls are somewhat reminiscent of the V-shaped bowls of the Chalcolithic period, which continue to appear at many EB I sites (Amiran 1969:43). The type appears only in Stratum XV. Type B lib: Gutter-rim bowls (Fig. 17:5-6). The bowls of this type have a rounded profile and an everted rim with an inner recess ("gutter"). Another variant has a sharply everted rim but lacks the typical gutter. All the bowls of this type are red-slipped on the exterior and on the inner part of the rim. The type appears in Strata XV and XIV. Bowls of the same type were defined as "inner-ledge rim" bowls at Megiddo (Engberg and Shipton 1934a: 19), where their range spans Stages VII-IV (Ibid.: Chart 19). At 'En Shadud, they were defined as "Bowls with Everted Rim" (Braun 1996a:202, Fig. VI.D.6). This type has been found only at sites in the Jezreel Valley and its vicinity. Its limited chronological range and the regional boundaries within which the type appears have led to its designation as "Esdraelon-style" bowls (Louhivouri 1988: PI. 130). It can be seen as one of the hallmarks of EB IB sites in the Jezreel Valley (Ibid.: 159). Type B lie: Bowls with conoid projections (Figs. 17:7; 23: 19-23). These bowls are almost hemispherical in profile. The in-turned rim is in most cases thickened and sharpened. The special feature of these bowls is the rounded projections below the rim. Since no complete bowl of this type was found at Tel Qashish, it is difficult to reconstruct the total number of projections and their arrangement on the vessel. The bowls are slipped on the exterior and sometimes on the interior of the rim. The color of the slip, which varies from red through brown to almost black, is a possible indication of the connection between this type and GBW bowls of Type B Hid (see below). The attribution of a particular sherd to one or other of these two types is often difficult; the distinction is based on the color of the slip, its location on the vessel (on the exterior or both inside and outside) and the presence of burnish on the exterior of the bowl. Despite the close resem- blance of types B lie and B Hid, no significant connection can be defined in terms of their appearance within the sequence. In some cases, they appear together in the same stratum and even on the same floor (e.g., L. 566B), but in others, they appear separately (e.g., only Type B lie in the Stratum XV fills and only Type B Hid in Stratum XIV). Thus, interpreting one of the types as an imitation of the other, as several scholars have suggested (Engberg and Shipton 1934a:19; G.E. Wright 1958:*41; Amiran 1969:49; Louhivouri 1988:105), must be based on broader strati- graphic and pétrographie data. The two types are contempo- raneous at sites in the Jezreel Valley and the northern valleys in general (Megiddo Stages VII-IV, 'Afilia, 'En Shadud, Asawir and Qiryat Ata). Their later appearance at sites in the Jordan Valley, such as Beth Yerah (Esse 1989a:81), seems to be a regional phenomenon ( contra Louhivouri 1988: 105, n. 5; Braun 1996a: 196-197). For further discussion of this "post-GBW" phase, see pp. 59-60. Type B lie appears only in Stratum XV. Bowls of this type are very common in EB I contexts throughout Palestine (Braun 1996a: 196- 197), and basalt bowls of a similar form are also known in this period (Braun 1991:26, Fig. 10). 35</page><page sequence="76">CHAPTER 4 Type B III: Gray Burnished Ware bowls. This category comprises the variants of the GBW bowl family defined by GE. Wright (1958). The bowls are slipped in colors varying from dark through light gray to yellow and are burnished. The quality and homogeneity of the slip vary from type to type. The following classification is based on Wright's types. Type B Ilia: Carinated bowls with sinuous line (Figs. 17:8; 23:1-2). According to Wright's definition of his Type 1 (Ibid.: *41), this is a shallow bowl with a simple everted rim. Its characterizing feature is the line of rope-like projections attached to the sinuous line on the carination. Though at Tel Qashish only body sherds bearing the rope- like decoration were considered to belong to the type, some of the out-turned rims classified as Type B Illb could well belong to Type B Ilia. Both the slip and the burnish of these bowls are of high quality and exhibit a technical ability not expressed by the other types of this family. A small number of sherds of this type were found at Tel Qashish, though none could be securely attributed to an EB I floor context. Type B Illb: Carinated bowls with out-turned rim (Figs. 17:9; 23:3-4). This type bears a certain resemblance to Wright's Type 2, which he believed to be unique to Tell el- Far' ah (North) (Ibid.: *41). The type's limited distribution is further demonstrated by later studies (Louhivouri 1988: 162; Goren and Zuckerman 2000:175). The bowls belonging to Type B Illb at Qashish tend to be deeper than those of the previous type, with the diameter of the rim equaling that of the body at the point of carination. The rims are simple or somewhat thickened, not as sharply out-turned as those of the previous type, and the walls are thicker than those of the other types. Most of the bowls are slipped and thoroughly burnished both inside and out. The color of the slip is usually light gray. As mentioned above, all the thick, rounded out- turned rim sherds that lacked a rope-decorated carination and thus could not be definitively attributed to Type B Ilia were classified as Type B Illb. Thus, this type should be under- stood as reminiscent of the earliest GBW bowls, Type B Ilia (Wright's Type 1). Examples of this type appear in Strata XV and XIV. Most of the sherds were found in fills, which might suggest an early date for the type. This fits well with Wright's GBW chronological sequence (Ibid.:*42-*44). The proportions of Types B Illb and B IIIc observed throughout the EB I sequence at Tel Qashish accord with Louhivouri 's observa- tions on northern EB IB sites (1988:162-164). Type B IIIc: Carinated bowls with sharpened rim (Figs. 17:10-11; 23:5-9). This type is identical to Wright's Type 3. The diameter of this bowl is generally smaller than that of the other types. The rim is thickened and everted and the carination is closer to the rim than in Type B Illb. The slip characterizing the type is thin and uneven, and in most cases the interior of the bowl is unslipped except for a narrow line inside the rim. The type often lacks burnishing, as observed by Wright (1958: *42-*44), as a result of which the bowls are considered technologically inferior to the other types. These bowls appear in Strata XV and XIV and are the most common GBW type at Tel Qashish. The gradual increase in the quantities of Type B IIIc relative to Type B Illb fits the chronological sequence presented by Wright and places the Tel Qashish sequence well within the EB IB. Type B IIIc is typical of Jezreel Valley sites and seldom appears outside this region. Type B Hid: Bowls with conoid projections (Figs. 17:12, 23:15-18). This type is equivalent to Wright's Type 4. These are hemispherical bowls with a thickened inverted rim and a row of conoid projections attached below the rim. The slip is dark gray to almost brown in color and applied on both sides of the rim. These bowls, which are often burnished, appear in Strata XV and XIV. The latter two types of GBW bowls (B IIIc and B Hid) have counterparts, in terms of both form and quantities, in the "traditional" or "local" repertoire of the EB I pottery at Tel Qashish (Fig. 23: 10-14 and Fig. 23: 19-21, respectively). These so-called "imitation" bowls (Wright 195 8: *41 -*42) are made of buff clay and are slipped in red or reddish- brown. They were defined as Types B IIb and B lie respec- tively (Fig. 17:5-7) (Fig. 23:10-14, 19-23). Type B IV: Small bowls (Fig. 17:13-15). This category includes all the bowls with a diameter of less than 15 cm. There are a number of typological variants, such as hemi- spherical, slightly carinated, shallow and holemouth-like bowls. These variations are described and discussed in their specific contexts. This is a common type of bowl in this period (Amiran 1969:43), showing considerable variation in the shape of the rims and the kinds of slips used. The bowls appear in both Strata XV and XIV.

The rims are inverted and sometimes thickened. Their definition as a separate type of vessel is based on their size, typical form and the attachment of ledge handles (Fig. 18:3). Kraters are not very common in the EB I repertoire at Tel Qashish (Table 3). Type K I: Thumb-indented rim (Fig. 18:1). This type has a raised clay band with a thumb-indented decoration on the rim, and in most cases appears to be unslipped. The few sherds attributed to this type at Tel Qashish were found only in contexts dated later than the EB I, and their attribution to the EB I is based mainly on parallels from other sites (Braun 1991: Fig. 13). Type K II: Simple rim (Fig. 18:2-3). The second krater type lacks the raised band and indented decoration. Judging by the vessel with an almost complete profile (Fig. 18:3), at least some of these kraters had ledge handles. Some are slipped, either on the interior or the exterior or on the rim only. HOLEMOUTH JARS (H) Fig. 19 Holemouth jars are the most common vessel in the EB I assemblage at Tel Qashish (Table 3). Since complete vessels are rare, the following typology is based mainly on rim sherds and thus a distinction between "holemouth cooking pots" with a rounded base and "holemouth storage jars" with a flat base (Amiran 1978:48-49) cannot be made. However, all the complete holemouth jars found at Tel Qashish have a flat base (Fig. 19:4-5; Photos 7, 13). Slip may occur on holemouth jars of all types, but no burnished examples were found. Incised and plastic Photo 13. Holemouth jars (Fig. 8:16, 20) and stand (Fig. 7:16). decorations are a common feature (Fig. 22:9-15). The holemouth jar types defined below appear in both EB I Strata XV and XIV at Tel Qashish. An interesting exception is Type H IV, which is found only in the "Post-XIII" fills. Their simple forms and variety of rim shapes make the holemouth jars poor chronological indicators (Nodet 1988). Contrary to other vessels, the differences in the rim shapes of holemouth jars are usually insignificant. Type H I: Simple rim. The two sub-types are: Type H la: Rounded rim (Fig. 19:1). The rim is a contin- uation of the wall. Type H lb: Sharpened rim (Fig. 19:2). The rim is sharp- ened at the edge. Type H II: Thickened rim. The two sub-types are: Type H IIa: Rounded rim (Fig. 19:3). The rim is thick- ened and rounded on the inside. Type H IIb: Sharpened rim (Fig. 19:4-5). The rim is thickened and sharpened. Parallels for the thickened sharp- ened rim are found at Megiddo from Stage VII through Stage IV, and the thickened rounded rim variant appears in these stages and Stage III as well. This is also the case at Tel Qashish: the thickened rounded rim variant appears side by side with the sharpened rim variant, gradually increasing in quantity but always remaining much scarcer. Similar rims appear at 'Afilla, Beth-Shean from Stratum XV on, and Tell el-Far'ah (North), where they are attributed to the Enéolithique Supérieur. Louhivouri assigns the holemouth jars with thickened bulbous rim to a later date, the EB IB (1988:205), and this suggestion seems to be borne out by the parallels cited above. Type H III: Up-turned rim (Fig. 19:6). In this type the rim is a continuation of the wall but the edge is up-turned, creating a kind of gutter. Type H IV: Ridged rim (Fig. 19:7). This type has a ridge on the exterior below the rim. The ridge is sometimes indented or rope-decorated. Type H V: Squared-off rim (Fig. 19:8). In this type the rim is cut. In most cases, the diameter of the mouth is smaller than that of the other types of holemouth jars and the walls are thinner. Parallels for this type were found at Megiddo Stages I- III, attributed to the EB II- III; at Beth-Shean from Stratum XV on; at Tell el-Far'ah (North), attributed to Bronze Ancien I; at Jericho, defined as Type C.I.d, belonging to the Early Bronze Age rather than the Proto-Urban sequence; and at Arad Stratum IV. On the whole, it seems that this type should be defined as a later EB I type that continues to appear in the EB II. TypeH VI: Spouted holemouth jar (Fig. 19:9). This type is characterized by a short, wide-mouthed spout, often with "flaring" walls. For convenience, all the spouts included in the count, which in most cases were broken and did not provide any indication of the form of the whole vessel, were attributed to this type. Some of these spouts, however, may have belonged to kraters. 37</page><page sequence="78">CHAPTER 4 Table 3 STRATUM TOTAL K HI H II HUI HIV HV HVI Hia HIb Hila Hllb ~ XVB 1 4 6 2 29 ~ 1 3 45 XVA 1 _5 22 1 29 XV fill 1_ 6 14 35 1 1 57 Early _5 4 2 3 J36 45 Late _5 2 6 18 26 XIV 2 16 13 10 73 9 121 Post-XIII 2 2% 18 33 106 3 4 2 2 196 TOTAL 1 27 59 55 59 319 ļ 5 '4 75 3 519 SMALL CLOSED VESSELS Fig. 20 Type HC: High-looped cups (Fig. 20: 1). The type has two main variants. In the first, the diameter of the mouth is equal to the diameter of the base and the shoulder is rounded (Fig. 9:12 Fig. 20: 1). The second variant has a much wider mouth, a shorter rim and a sloping shoulder (Fig. 14:4-5). The absolute number of both variants at Tel Qashish is so small that no quantitative analysis has been attempted. The cups are red-slipped on the exterior and on the rim, and some show traces of handles running from the rim to the shoulder of the vessel. They appear in both Strata XV and XIV. Type NJ: Straight-necked small jars (Fig. 20:2-3). In these vessels the neck is erect and short and the rim is simple or slightly sharpened. Though there is some resemblance in form between this type and Type SJ I storage jars, Type NJ is much smaller. These jars appear in both Strata XV and XIV. Type T: Teapots/Kettles (Fig. 20:4-5). These vessels are represented by two kinds of sherds: drooping spouts (Amiran 1969:43) and ridged necks belonging to "Funnel Neck Teapots" (Braun 1996a:202, Fig. VI.D.7). Teapots are usually red-slipped on the exterior. The type was found in the fills of Stratum XV and in Stratum XJV. Type GJ: Gourd jars (Fig. 20:6-7). The type has a flaring neck, flat shoulder and squat body. The handles are usually straight, running from just below the rim to the shoulder. The jars are red-slipped on the exterior and sometimes also on the interior of the neck. Gourd jars are common in EB I tomb contexts, especially in the north, but are not very common at settlement sites; Tel Qashish is no exception. STORAGE JARS (SJ) Fig. 21 Type SJ I: Jars with straight neck (Fig. 21:1). These jars have upright or slightly flaring necks, simple or sharpened rims and drooping shoulders. Some are slipped on the exterior and inside the rim. The type appears in the fills of Stratum XV and in Stratum XIV (Table 5). Type SJ II: Bow-rim jars. The neck of this type is convex and the body is elongated and oval. In most cases, the jars are slipped on the exterior and inside the rim with a loosely applied wash or in the grain-wash style. The type is typical of the northern valleys (Braun 1996a:204, Table VI.D.9). The two main variants at Tel Qashish are: Type S J Ha: Simple rounded rim (Fig. 21:2). This variant is represented only in Stratum XV. Type SJ lib: Cut rim (Fig. 21:3). In some cases, the neck of this sub-type is shorter than the characteristic neck of the first variant. The variant appears in both Strata XV and XIV. Type S J III: Varia (Fig. 21:4-6).

The type includes the three variations of ledge handles found at Tel Qashish: plain, thumb-indented (Fig. 22:2) and slightly pushed-up (Fig. 22:1). Some of the ledge handles are perforated. This type of handle usually belongs to large, coarse vessels: kraters, holemouth jars and storage jars. The origins, chrono- logical and technological development, and regional distri- bution pattern of ledge handles have been discussed at length (Amiran 1969:35-40; Braun 1996a:82, 87). They are one of the hallmarks of the Early Bronze Age, and their internal development throughout the period is well known. Plain (Fig. 15:5) and thumb-indented/wavy (Figs. 7:24- 25; 10:16; 1 1 : 14-15; 22: 1-2) ledge handles were found in EB I contexts at Tel Qashish, as at most EB I sites in the region, such as 'En Shadud, Beth ha-'Emeq, Beth-Shean Strata XVII-XIV, and Asawir. The plain ledge handles are considered a later phenomenon within the EB I period (Louhivouri 1988:183-184; Braun 1996a:210). The other variants, such as the pushed-up and folded ledge handles (Fig. 69: 1-2), are attributed to EB II- III contexts. Type HD II: Pierced lug handles (Fig. 22:3-4). Some variants of this type already appear in the Chalcolithic period (Amiran 1969: PI. 25; Louhivouri 1988:187). The type comes from small vessels, such as teapots and even bowls. Type HD HI: Loop handles (Fig. 22:5-8). This is the largest group of handles found in the EB I strata at Tel Qashish. The category includes handles of high-looped cups, as well as larger handles of other closed vessels. Incised loop handles have been defined as a northern characteristic of the EB IB (Louhivouri 1988:187). The handles are sometimes red- slipped and decorated with incisions (Fig. 22:7-8). DECORATIONS (DC) Fig. 22:9-17 Type DC I: Incisions and "potter's marks" (Fig. 22:9-1 1). These are markings incised on or just below the rims of holemouth jars, usually prior to firing. This kind of decoration, sometimes designated "potter's marks," is fairly common and is usually composed of several incised lines. Another decoration, characteristic mainly of holemouth jars, consists of incised lines and dots. The style of line-combina- tions has parallels at Megiddo Stages VI-III, especially Stages VI-V (Engberg and Shipton 1934a: Type 15), 'Afilla, and Tell esh-Shunah Stratum II. The function of these markings is uncertain, and the simplicity of the forms makes the parallels somewhat insig- nificant. N. Lapp recently presented several suggestions regarding the nature of the incised markings of the EB I (1995). Due to the small number of incised sherds found at Tel Qashish, however, an analysis of the various designs and their significance is impossible. Type DC II: Plastic decorations (Fig. 22:12-15). All the plastic/applied decorations, including rope designs, thumb- indented ridges and clay coils, appear on holemouth jars, in most cases near the rims. Holemouth jars with various applied decorations appear in the north throughout the EB I (Louhivouri 1988:206). Less common are the attached projections (Fig. 22: 1 2-1 3) and the horseshoe-like appliques (Figs. 16:6; 22:14). The significance of these additions, whether functional or merely decorative, is unknown. They appear mostly on large coarse vessels, such as holemouth jars and storage jars, and may be a continuation of traditions of the Chalcolithic period (Amiran 1969:25, 55). Jars with rope decoration at the base of the neck or below the rim, typical of the EB LA (Louhivouri 1988: 191), do not appear at Tel Qashish. Also noteworthy is the absence of another type of jar with a rail-rim incised with diagonal lines or a thumb-indented rim (Braun 1985: Fig. 23:3-7), which appears at most neighboring sites (Megiddo Stages IV-III, 'A&amp;la, Beth-Shean Stratum XIV) and is considered one of the ceramic indices of the "En-Shadud" phase (Braun 1996a: 84). The only storage jar bearing a rope-like decoration was found in L.532 (Fig. 1 0: 1 1 ; Photo 1 1 ). A line of small, round clay projections was applied on the sloping shoulder. Similar decoration appears at Megiddo Stages VI-V (Type 1 5) and at Tel Asawir (E. Yannai, personal communication). This tradi- tion may be a reflection of the use of actual ropes for fastening the vessels, turned into a pure decorative element 39</page><page sequence="80">CHAPTER 4 (Amiran 1969:25). A possible relationship between these decorations and the cylinder-seal impressions on storage jars is suggested below. Type DC III: Grain-wash (Fig. 22: 1 6). All the body sherds of storage jars decorated in this style (also known as "band- slip") were attributed to this group. These were irregularly slipped in red, brown, or even black bands over the entire vessel. This kind of decoration is relatively rare at Tel Qashish, as at other sites in the Jezreel Valley. Its main distri- bution area appears to be the Jordan Valley and the northern valleys, where it continues into the EB II or EB III (Braun 1996a:83-84, 197-199; A. Mazar, Ziv-Esudri and Cohen- Weinberger 2000). Fig. 15. Area B: L. 526 (Post-Stratum XIII). No. Object type Reg.

Although the EB I occupation on the tel was the most extensive relative to other periods, EB I strata were exposed only on a limited scale in Area B and the architectural remains are meager (Plans 2-3). The pottery assemblage attributed to the EB I was recovered from the fragmentary Stratum XV buildings, from the floors associated with the Stratum XIV walls and from the rich construction fills, designated "Post-XIII," associated with the fortification of the EB II settlement. In general, the EB I ceramic assemblage consists mainly of domestic vessel types, the greater part of which, both absolutely and in terms of percentage, comprises holemouth jars. Other characteristic types are bowls (mainly GBW), kraters, and storage jars. This assemblage is typical of settle- ment sites and is completely different from the repertoire found in tombs from this period, for example, at Hazorea, Asawir, Kefar Glickson, Tell el-Far' ah (North), Jericho, and 'Ai. Amiran and others emphasize the distinction between the two types of assemblages (Amiran 1969:55; Louhivouri 1988:89-220). The characteristic ware is light buff, often with small dark grits. Most of the vessels, with the possible exception of the GBW bowls of Type B IIIc, are hand-made. Many of the vessels are red-slipped, or rather red-washed: the large vessels are often covered with a thin, loosely applied red wash on the exterior and sometimes on the rim. Burnishing is uncommon and appears mainly on GBW bowls. Band- slip/grain-wash decoration, the characteristic style of decoration at northern EB I sites (Braun 1996a:83-84), is rare at Tel Qashish. Throughout the following discussion references are given to Figs. 2-16, the EB I pottery figures accompanying the stratigraphie discussion. These figures represent floors of the main loci in each stratum. The sherd-counts given in Tables 2-5 present the raw data on which many of the following observations are based. Types that appear only in fills were not included in the pottery figures but are discussed and represented in the sherd-count tables. The descriptions accompanying each pottery figure list the references for the parallels mentioned in the discussion, in order of geograph- ical proximity. AREA A (Fig. 2) EB I architectural remains were not found in Area A. W. 243, a curvilinear wall found in Squares Y/15-16 (Plan 13), similar in nature to the Stratum XV curvilinear walls in Area B (see W. 337, W. 3 14, and W. 3 1 5 on Plan 2), was attributed to Stratum XIIE because its associated floors yielded only EB II- III pottery (Fig. 48). Two loci in Area A, however, did contain EB I pottery: L. 457 and L. 463 in Square W/14 (Fig. 2). Both loci repre- sent fills beneath the alley attributed to the initial EB II- III occupation in Stratum XIIE. There is no exact correlation between these loci and a specific phase of the EB I sequence in Area B. 49</page><page sequence="90">CHAPTER 4 AREA B (Figs. 3-16) STRATUM XVB (Figs. 3; 5:1-5; 6) This is the earliest EB I stratum at Tel Qashish. Beneath its floors (L. 566B and L. 575, L. 613, and L. 616), only fills were found, which yielded little pottery but were rich in flint implements (see Chapter 23). These fills rest on bedrock. Though the few Chalcolithic sherds from the fills attest to some activity during this period (Fig. 1), no architectural remains were found. The lower floor of the RC building (L. 566B) associated with the threshold in the southern wall (Plan 2), and the lower level relating to W. 338 from the west (L. 622B), were attrib- uted to the earliest stratum. L. 605 to the north of L. 622B is also attributed to Stratum XVB, although it may belong to Stratum XVA p. 12. Bowls. Two bowls of Type B I were found in this stratum. One (Fig. 6: 1) is a shallow unslipped bowl, its rim cut on the exterior. The other (Fig. 5:1) has a triangular in-turned rim, somewhat resembling the form of EB II platters. Parallels were found at Megiddo in the Tomb 91 OB fill attributed to Stages VI-V, at Me'ona pre-Stratum I, and at Tell el-Far' ah (North) (where the bowls are usually irregularly red-slipped and burnished) in the stratum attributed to the Enéolithique Moyen and in Tomb 3, attributed to the Enéolithique Supérieur (accompanied by GBW bowls of Type B Ilia). Similar bowls were also found at southern sites such as Arad Stratum IV (EB IB). Three bowls of Type B lie were found on the lower floor of the RC building (Fig. 3:2-3, 15). Two (Fig. 3:2, 15) are typical. Parallels were found at 'En Shadud, in the elliptical building of Stratum I, at Megiddo Stages VII-IV, especially from Stage VI On (with the brown-red wash that also charac- terizes the Tel Qashish examples) (Engberg and Shipton 1934a: 19), in the burial cave at Asawir, at 'Afula, at Beth- Shean Stratum XV, and in the 'En ha-Naziv burial cave. The third Type B lie example (Fig. 3:3) is a larger bowl-krater with a simple in-turned rim and traces of a projection (possibly a handle). The bowl is red-slipped on both the exterior and the interior. Considering its diameter and general form, it seems to have a parallel in Type I from 'En Shadud. Parallels were also found at 'Afula. Three rims of GBW bowls of Type B Illb were found (e.g. , Fig. 3:16). Similar bowls were found at 'Afilla, at Beth- Shean Strata XVII-XVI, and at Yiftahel Stratum II. This type of GBW bowl is relatively rare at Tel Qashish. GBW bowls of Type B IIIc are represented in Stratum XVB only by a single, not very typical sherd (Fig. 3:1). This type is predominant in the later EB I strata at Tel Qashish. GBW bowls of Type B Hid are not very common in Stratum XVB. Parallels come mainly from tombs, e.g., at Megiddo (Tomb 903 Lower), Asawir, and Tell el-Far'ah (North) (for the most recent treatments of this type see Esse 1989a; Braun 1996a). One small red-slipped bowl with a sharpened rim of Type B IV was found (Fig. 3: 14). For parallels see the discussion of the pottery from the Stratum XV fills L. 568 + L. 579, below. Holemouth jars. The types that appear are H Ia-b, with a simple rounded or sharpened rim (Figs. 3:4-6, 17; 6:3-4) 50 and H IIb, with a thickened sharpened rim, already appearing in significant quantities (Figs. 3:7-9; 5:3; 6:6-10). Three examples of holemouth jars with a squared-off rim, Type H V, were found in this stratum. The quantity of this type peaks in Stratum XIV. High-looped cups. Three sherds probably belonging to high-looped cups (Type HC) were found in Stratum XVB (Figs. 3:10; 6:11). The type and its parallels are discussed below, but its first appearance at Tel Qashish is in the earliest EB I stratum. Straight-necked jars. Two vessels of Type NJ appear in this stratum. One (Fig. 3:18) has a large diameter and could be considered a storage jar sub-type. Similar straight-necked jars were found at 'En Shadud Stratum I. A unique vessel (Fig. 6:12) found in L. 605 has a funnel- shaped conical rim. Though there are no exact parallels, it may be a variant of a funnel-shaped teapot (Braun 1996a:202-203). Storage jars. Thebow-rimjarofType SJ Ha with a simple rounded rim first appears in Stratum XVB (Figs. 3: 1 1 ; 6: 13), as does Type S J lib with a cut rim (Fig. 3:12). Type SJ II jars are very common at EB IB northern sites (Braun 1 996a:204). Parallels were found at 'En Shadud Stratum I, Megiddo Stages VII-V, and Tell el-Far'ah (North), where they are attributed to the Chalcolithique Moyen. Aunique type of jar appears in L. 622B (Fig. 5:4-5). These jars are relatively small and have short erect necks and a sharpened rim. Grain-wash ware. Several body sherds of small jars with a grain-wash decoration were found in Stratum XVB (Fig. 3:19). Parallels were found at 'En Shadud, 'Afilla, and Megiddo Stages VII-IV, as well as at contemporaneous sites in the upper Jordan Valley and northern Transjordan. This type of ware has recently been discussed by Braun (1996a: 196-197, 232, Table VI.D.2). Summary: Stratum XVB. The parallels for the Tel Qashish examples suggest that Stratum XVB, the beginning of the EB I settlement at Tel Qashish, is at a relatively late stage of the period. The earliest phase of the EB I in the Jezreel Valley, which retains some features of the Chalcolithic tradi- tion, is best represented by Yiftahel Stratum II (Braun 1 99 1 ; 1 997). It is noteworthy that virtually none of the types found in the earliest stratum at Tel Qashish is paralleled in the EB LA assemblage of Yiftahel. The two assemblages seem to differ in every typological and technological aspect. All the chronologically significant types of the first phase at Tel Qashish, such as the GBW bowls, holemouth jars and bow- rim jars, point to an EB IB dating for the earliest EB I stratum at the site, contemporaneous with sites designated by Braun as belonging to the "'En Shadud phase" (1985; 1996a). STRATUM XVA (Figs. 4; 5:6-9) This stratum comprises the upper floor level of the RC building (L. 566A) and the upper level associated with the curvilinear wall to its west (L. 622A). Bowls. A small deep hemispherical bowl with a gutter rim and a rounded base, red-slipped on both the interior and the exterior (Fig. 5:6), was found in this stratum. It has no exact</page><page sequence="91">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE I POTTERY parallels. Fig. 5:8 is a red-slipped holemouth bowl, which appears for the first time in this stratum. Two GBW bowls were found in this stratum: one is of Type B Hid (Fig. 4:1) and the other sherd is too small to be securely classified, but might be of Type B Illb (Fig. 5:2). Holemouth jars. The Stratum XVB types continue to appear in Stratum XVA. Type H IIb, holemouth jars with a thickened sharpened rim (Fig. 4:2), are predominant in the assemblage, a phenomenon also observed in Stratum XIV. Though holemouth jars of Types H III and H IV do not appear in Stratum XVA they are present in the fills of Stratum XV (L. 568 + L. 579) and later, and consequently their absence cannot be regarded as chronologically significant. One sherd of a spouted holemouth jar of Type H VI was found in Stratum XVA (Table 3). High-looped cups. This type of cup with an out-turned rim known from Stratum XVB continues to appear in Stratum XVA. Gourd jars appear for the first time in this stratum. Storage jars. The types known from the previous stratum also appear in Stratum XVA. The most common type in this stratum is the bow-rim jar of Type SJ II, whose two variants dominate the jar repertoire from Stratum XVA on (Fig. 4:5-6). Grain-wash ware. Sherds with grain-wash decoration continue to appear (Fig. 4:4). Summary: Stratum XVA. The ceramic assemblage of Stratum XVA seems to be typologically indistinguishable from that of Stratum XVB. No new types, except for one sherd of a gourd jar, appear in this stratum. It can be concluded that both occupation phases of the first stratum at Tel Qashish, Strata XVB and XVA, represent a relatively short and continuous period of occupation. STRATUM XV FILLS (Figs. 7-8) This phase consists of fills to the west of W. 337 sealed by the walls attributed to Stratum XIV. Though a possible level was traced at a height close to that of the Stratum XVA floors, the same fill continues down to bedrock. During pottery restora- tion, it became apparent that the two loci, L. 568 and L. 579, should be combined into a single element. This hints at the existence of a floor level, probably at the base of L. 568. Thus, these fills represent the entire time-span of Stratum XV. Bowls. All the bowl types of the EB I assemblage at Tel Qashish appear in these contexts, some for the first time. Small bowls of Type B IV (Fig. 7:1-5) Two variants of hemispherical bowls were found: the "closed" hemispher- ical bowl (Fig. 7:1) with a sharpened in-turned rim and the "open" hemispherical bowl (Fig. 7:2) with a simple and slightly in-turned rim. Parallels for both variants were found at 'En Shadud Stratum II, Megiddo Stages VII-IV and Tomb 903 Lower, and Asawir. This simple form also appears at southern sites, for example, 'Ai Tomb B and Azor Tomb 1, Level III. The three small bowls with a simple or sharpened rim and almost straight walls (Fig. 7:3-5) are typical of this phase. All the bowls of this type are red-slipped both inside and outside. Parallels were found at 'En Shadud, where they are attributed to Stratum I or to undated fills; at Megiddo Stratum XIX; at Yiftahel Stratum II, dated to the early EB I, where they are only poorly represented in the assemblage (Braun 1991:48, Fig. 14:5); at Mezer Stratum I, attributed to the late Chalcolithic; at Tel Kinnerot; and at Tell el-Far'ah (North), where they are attributed to the Chalcolithique Supérieur. The wide range of parallels is a result of the simple form of these bowls and appears to lack chronological significance. The bowl with a flattened rim (Fig. 7:8) may have a parallel at 'En Shadud. Straight-sided bowls of Type B IIa (Fig. 7:6-7). This type is found only in Stratum XV. Variants also appear in L. 532 (Fig. 10:2) and L. 528 (Fig. 12:1). Parallels were found at 'En Shadud (mainly in Stratum I but also earlier), 'Afilla, Asawir, Kefar Glickson, and Tell el-Far'ah (North), where they are attributed to the Enéolithique/Chalcolithique Supérieur. Similar bowls were found in the south, at Jericho, 'Ai Tomb B, and Azor Tomb 4, Level III. Basalt bowls from this period share the same form (P.W. Lapp 1968: 13; Braun 1 990). Another similar bowl was found with a basalt bowl in the Kefar Glickson tomb (Ziegelman 1978: Fig. 2:4, 7). Gutter-rim bowls of Type B lib (Fig. 7:9-10). This type is best represented in the Stratum XV fills. Parallels were found at 'En Shadud Stratum I, Megiddo Tomb 903 Lower, Tomb 910G fill, and Stages VII-IV, Asawir in the tomb and in large numbers in Stratum II on the tel (Yannai and Grosinger 2000:158-160), and 'Afula Pit B. According to Gophna, the type is characteristic of a number of coastal sites, which might hint at the possible Jezreel Valley origin of the inhabitants of this area (Gophna 1974:140-147). The only other EB I site outside the Jezreel Valley at which this type was found is Tell el-Far'ah (North), where a bowl with a similar rim and ledge handles is attributed to the Enéolithique Supérieur. It should be noted that a somewhat similar rim shape is found on shallow bowls from Beth ha- 'Emeq Strata II- III. The difference in their general form might be explained by the geographical distance from the assumed production center of these bowls in the Jezreel Valley. Bowls with conoid projections of Type B lie. Two bowls of this type were found. In contrast to Stratum XVB, their appearance in these fills is not accompanied by GBW bowls with conoid projections of Type B Hid. GBW bowls of Type B IIIc (Fig. 7:11-14). This is the first significant appearance of the type (only one sherd was found in Stratum XVB and none in Stratum XVA). More than half the GBW bowls found in these loci are of this type. Two variants were discerned: bowls with a short rim and sharp carination (Fig. 7: 1 1) and bowls with an elongated rim and rounded carination (Fig. 7:12). Both variants appear at 'En Shadud Stratum I/II, Megiddo Tomb 903 Lower and Tomb 910(1 Asawir, and 'Afilla. A unique bowl belonging to this type (Fig. 7:14) has a grooved rim; no exact parallel was found. Kraters. A relatively large number of kraters was found in the fills of Stratum XV. All belong to Type KII. An almost complete example appears on Fig. 7 : 1 5 . Parallels were found at 'En Shadud Stratum I, Megiddo Tomb 903 Lower and Stages VII-IV, and 'Afilla. 51</page><page sequence="92">CHAPTER 4 Holemouth jars. More than half the holemouth jars from these loci are of Type H IIb (Fig. 8: 1 1-2 1 ; Photos 7, 1 3). The type is undoubtedly the most common throughout the EB I strata at Tel Qashish. The other types found in the Stratum XV fills are H la (Fig. 8:1-5) and H lb (Fig. 8:6-10) with a simple rim, and one example each of Types H III, with an up- turned rim, and H V, a spouted holemouth jar. Stand. Stands are rare in EB I assemblages. The Tel Qashish example (Fig. 7:16; Photos 7, 14) is notable mainly for its size, which is big enough to hold a large holemouth jar (Photo 13). The stand is biconical in shape but not symmet- rical, and is red-slipped on the interior and the exterior. The closest parallel in form was found in the Asawir tomb, though this example is much smaller. Stands with vertical walls were found at Jericho Stratum VII and at Pella in Jordan (Hanbury-Tenison 1985). Photo 14. Stand (Fig. 7:16). High-looped cups. This type is represented by a flat base reused as an oil-lamp and a body sherd (Fig. 7:18-19). Paral- lels were found in the Asawir tomb. Straight-necked jars (Fig. 7:20) and gourd jars (Fig. 7:17) continue to appear in these fills. Similar vessels were found at 'En Shadud, Megiddo Stages VII-VI and Stratum XIX, and Asawir. The gourd jar found in L. 568 has a unique feature: the lower part of the handle is attached to the body at the point of carination rather than at its shoulder (Fig. 7: 17). A similar vessel, cited by Amiran, was found at Aktanit in Lebanon (Amiran 1969:46). Teapots. This vessel, so characteristic of the EB I, makes its first appearance in the Stratum XV fills. In most cases it is represented only by its drooping spout (Fig. 20:5). Storage jars. Most are bow-rim jars of Type SJ lib. Ajar of Type S J I was found in L. 568 (Fig. 7:21); a similar red- slipped jar was found at 'Afula. A gutter-rim storage jar without exact parallel at Tel Qashish or any other site was found in L. 568 (Fig. 7 :22). The jar has a relatively thick wall, a convex neck and a gutter rim. It should be noted that a similar treatment of the rim is discernible in the bowls of Type B lib found in this fill, perhaps indicating a common tradition or manufacturing process for both these vessel types. Grain-wash ware (DC III) is represented by sherds of small vessels, decorated in wide strips of paint (Fig. 7:23). This is the last appearance of this type of decoration in the Tel Qashish repertoire. The assemblage of the Stratum XV fills cannot be defini- tively correlated with either one of the two Stratum XV phases observed inside and outside the RC building. The pottery of L. 568 + L. 579 shares some typological features with each of the two phases, as well as presenting new ones. It therefore seems justified to discuss the phases of Stratum XV, representing the period of use of the RC building and W. 337, as a whole. The minor differences in elevation between the two phases further emphasize this point, and indicate the absence of any significant occupational gap. Summary: Stratum XV. Stratum XV as a whole fits into the framework of the later part of the EB I (i.e., EB IB) in the north, especially within the Jezreel Valley. Most of the paral- lels were found at neighboring sites, mainly Megiddo, 'En Shadud, 'Afula, and Asawir. Some important chronological observations regarding the GBW tradition should be emphasized. A chronological development within the sequence of this ware was observed by GE. Wright (1958:42*) and later proven by others, most recently Louhivouri (1988:163-164) and Braun (1996a). Wright's Type 1 (our Type B Ilia, with a rounded out-turned rim and rope-like decorations) appears to be earlier, domi- nating the assemblages from sites belonging to the "Yiftahel II" phase (Braun 1991:49, Fig. 10; 1997). At such sites, defined as EB IA in the traditional terminology or as "Early Northern EB I" by Braun, GBW bowls of Wright's Type 3 (our Type B IIIc, carinated bowls with an out-turned rim) are completely absent. Wright's Type 3 appears in later assem- blages, especially in the Jezreel Valley. Sherds of Type 3 predominate at 'En Shadud, the type site for the EB IB (Braun 1985: Fig. 19:1-10), where bowls of Type 1 are represented by only one sherd (Ibid.: Fig. 18:13). Yannai observes a similar development in his recent excavations at Asawir. This is the only northern site in which a stratified sequence of an EB IA stratum of the Yiftahel II horizon, followed by an EB IB stratum contemporaneous with 'En Shadud and Tel Qashish, has been excavated to date. GBW bowls of Type 1 characterize the earlier Stratum III, while Type 3 is most common in the later Stratum II (Yannai 1999; Yannai and Grosinger 2000:156-157). This sequence supports the chronology suggested by Wright. Thus, Yiftahel II and 'En Shadud I- II represent the two separate chronological phases of the EB I in northern Israel. These can be defined on the basis of the proportions of GBW bowl types within the assemblages. In the course of this period, there is a sharp decline in the quantities of GBW bowls of Type 1 and an increase in those of Type 3. Other 52</page><page sequence="93">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE I POTTERY sites at which both types were found can be dated according to their proportions. The difference between the early and the late phases of the EB I can be seen not only in the GBW types, but also in other types, such as the hemispherical red- slipped and burnished bowls, kraters, holemouth jars and storage jars. Stratum XV, the first occupation phase at Tel Qashish can therefore be placed some time after the begin- ning of the EB IB, when GBW bowls of Wright's Type 1 (our Type B Ilia) no longer appear and GBW bowls of Type 3 (our Type B IIIc) are predominant. THE CURVILINEAR WALLS IN SQUARES AF-AG/12-13 (Plan 2) Three walls were excavated in Squares AF-AG/12-13 in Area B, to the west of the main area in which EB I remains were exposed. The attribution of these walls to the EB I is based on their curvilinear nature and their associated pottery. Two distinct architectural stages are defined (see the stratigraphical discussion above): the "Early Stage" includes the L. 53 1 (Fig. 9) and L. 532 (Fig. 1 0) fills and a floor associ- ated with W. 314 and W. 315; and the "Late Stage" includes the fills relating to W. 313, L. 527 (Fig. 11) and L. 528 (Fig. 12) (see also Section A-A' in Squares AF-AG/13). It is difficult to correlate between these stages and the EB I sequence of the area to the east, and any such correlation is based primarily on the curvilinear nature of these walls. The ceramic sequence discussed below might serve as a basis for a possible correlation between these stages and Strata XV-XIV. The Early Stage (Figs. 9-10) Bowls. A shallow bowl of Type B I (Fig. 9:3) is reminiscent of an unslipped bowl found in the fills of Stratum XV (Fig. 7:8). Parallels were found at 'En Shadud Stratum I/II. A straight-sided bowl of Type B IIa (Fig. 10:2) is unique, due to its thin walls and relatively large diameter, as well as its decoration, consisting of thin red line on both the inside and outside of the rim. Similar bowls were found at 'Afilla. The bowl is more similar to earlier Chalcolithic V-shaped bowls than the typical straight-sided bowl of the EB I reper- toire in Tel Qashish. All the GBW bowls from this stage belong t,o Type B Illb, the thick-walled rounded-rim bowls characteristic of Stratum XVB in the RC building area. The small bowls of Type B IV from this stage belong to types well known in the EB I repertoire of Tel Qashish. These are bowls with a rounded carination and a sharpened rim (Fig. 9:1), already known from the fills of Stratum XV (Fig. 7:3-4), and small holemouth bowls with an in-turned rim (Fig. 9:2). A unique feature of the bowls of this stage is their style of decoration. One bowl from L. 53 1 (Fig. 9:2) is decorated with white vertical stripes over a red slip, a tech- nique paralleled at Asawir and Jericho Tombs A94 and A 1 3 . This "white-on-red" decorative style is known in the EB II- III (Fig. 35:7), but less common in the EB I. A different kind of decoration is found on the small bowl with a rounded carination from the same locus (Fig. 9: 1). The bowl is irregularly red-slipped on the exterior, while the interior is decorated with wide red horizontal stripes. Parallels were found at Tell esh-Shunah Stratum II, attributed to the "late Chalcolithic," and at Mezer, attributed to Stratum II (i.e., late Chalcolithic-EB I). A number of small bowls at Asawir are decorated with vertical and diagonal lines (Dothan 1970: PI. 7:9, 12-14). It should be emphasized that this kind of decoration is different from the "Line Group Painted Ware" (LGP W) characterizing southern sites of this period (Amiran 1969:49; Stager 1992:29; Braun 1996a:213-215). Holemouth jars. Type H IIb (Figs. 9:7-10; 10:8-9) domi- nates the holemouth jar repertoire from both the Early and the Late Stage. Types H I (Figs. 9:4-5; 10:5-7) and H Ila are represented by only a few sherds (Table 3). This is typical of the entire EB I sequence at Tel Qashish. All the other types of holemouth jars are absent in both stages. Considering the small number of sherds and the problematic nature of the area, this absence could be coincidental. High-looped cups appear as a slightly different variant from the usual one, in which the rim is very short and out- turned and the diameter of the mouth is ca. 10 cm (Fig. 14:4-5). The cups characteristic of this stage (Fig. 9:11-12; Photo 10) have an elongated raised rim, a handle attached to the rim and a more rounded shoulder. They are slipped, like the more common variant, on the exterior and inside the rim. Parallels were found at Asawir, in the Kefar Glickson tomb, and at Kh. Usa, attributed to the Chalcolithic-EB I transition. The type also appears at southern sites, e.g., 'Ai Tomb G and Azor Stage III of Tomb 1. It is characteristic of northern sites in the EB I and also appears in the coastal region and the Shephelah. No gourd jars or straight-necked jars were found in this stage. Storage jars. All the types known in the Tel Qashish EB I repertoire are represented in this stage. Notable is a jar of Type SJ I (Fig. 9:13) with a sloping shoulder. A possible parallel was found at 'Afula. Another jar (Fig. 9:14) is a hybrid between the erect neck of Type S J I and the rounded rim of Type S J Ha. Parallels were found at Megiddo Stages VII-V and 'Afula Pit D. The most common EB I type, Type S J Ha, is represented in this stage by an almost complete example (Fig. 10:1 1). Two mending holes were drilled in the neck of this jar (Photos 1 1 , 15-16). Its base was probably similar to the flat base found in L. 531 (Fig. 9:18). Parallels for this type were found at Megiddo Stages V-IV and 'En Shadud Strata I/II. Similar storage jars at Megiddo and 'En Shadud bear cylinder-seal impressions. It is interesting that the location and orientation of the seal impressions on these vessels resemble the form and location of the rope-like decoration on the Tel Qashish jar (Braun 1985: Figs. 23:10-11; 34). A similarly decorated storage jar was found at Asawir Stratum II (E. Yannai, personal communication). The gutter-rim storage jar (Fig. 7:22; discussed in the Stratum XV fills section above) is represented in this stage by two slightly different variants (Fig. 10:13-14), with a possible parallel at 'Afula. In contrast to the Stratum XV fills, in this case there is no correlation between the appearance of this type of jar and of gutter-rim bowls of Type B Ha, which are completely absent in these loci in both stages. The characteristic storage jar type of this stage, not found in the later stage and represented by only one sherd in the 53</page><page sequence="94">CHAPTER 4 Photo 15. Bow-rim storage jar (Fig. 10:11). Photo 16. Inside of bow-rim storage jar (note traces of ancient mending). Stratum XV fills, is Type SJ III with an out-turned flaring neck (Fig. 9:16-17). Summary: The Early Stage. On the whole, the assemblage from the early stage closely resembles that of Stratum XV in general, especially the earlier Stratum XVB phase. This similarity is manifested by the predominance of GBW bowls of Type B Mb; the absence of teapots, gourd jars and ridged- rim holemouth jars; the predominance of slipped over unslipped vessels; and the relatively high percentage of high- looped cups and gutter-rim storage jars. The unique style of striped decoration is noteworthy. The Late Stage (Figs. 11-12) This stage consists of the fills associated with W. 313, the later wall that seals the floor in L. 53 1 of the early stage. The pottery attributed to this stage comes from L. 527, to the east of W. 313, and L. 528 to its west. Though the amount of pottery attributed to this stage is meager, even compared to the other phases attributed to the EB I, it nevertheless represents later building activities in this area and might suggest a sequence connecting this area with the area to its east. Bowls. One bowl of Type B IIa, slightly different from the common variant, was found in this stage (Fig. 12:1). The bowl is smaller, thin-walled, and lacks slip. Possible paral- lels were found at 'Afilla. The two types of GBW bowls represented in this stage are Type B Illb (Fig. 1 1 : 1) and Type B IIIc (Figs. 1 1 :2-3; 12:2). The latter seems to differ slightly from the common variant of this type and no exact parallels were found. Kraters. Type K II is relatively common in this stage (Figs. 11:4; 12:3^). Holemouth jars. Three types of holemouth jars appear in this stage. The most common is Type H IIb (Figs. 11:9; 12:7-11), and Types H la and H lb are also represented (Figs. 11:5-8; 12:5-6). Most of the holemouth jars are unslipped. A unique "holemouth bowl" (Fig. 11:10) has a sharply inverted rim and a very small diameter. Small vessels. No high-looped cups or teapots were found in this stage. One sherd of a gourd jar was counted. Straight- necked small jars appear in L. 527 (Fig. 11:11-12). Storage jars. Most of the jars attributed to this stage belong to Type SJ lib (Fig. 12:12-14), although Type SJ I is also represented (Fig. 11:13). A body sherd with a ledge handle (Fig. 11:15) is noteworthy. Summary: The Late Stage. The chronological and typo- logical significance of the repertoire of this stage lies mainly in the types it lacks, among which bowls of Type Bllld, holemouth jars of Types H IV-V, and high-looped cups and teapots should be mentioned. These types are characteristic of the late strata in the main area to the east. Some vessels that appear in this stage, such as the GBW bowls of Type B IIIc, are absent in the Early Stage. Both stages seem to belong to the range of occupation represented by Stratum XV in the main area, the earliest EB I settlement at Tel Qashish. STRATUM XIV (Figs. 13-14) This stratum consists of two fragmentary walls sealing the fills of Stratum XV in Squares AH/12-13 (Plan 3). These walls, W. 320 and W. 325B, differ in orientation from the walls of the earlier stratum (Plan 4). No coherent plan of any single architectural element could be discerned, and the walls could have belonged to either a rectilinear or a curvilinear building. The floors attributed to Stratum XIV are L. 534 to the east of W. 320 (Fig. 13) and L. 553 to the south of W.325B (Fig. 14). 54</page><page sequence="95">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE I POTTERY Bowls. Bowls of Type B lib with a gutter rim were found in this stratum. GBW bowls. Three types of GBW bowls are represented: Type B Illb was found only in fills, Type B IIIc (Fig. 13:2-3) is the most common, and Type B Hid (Fig. 14: 1-2) continues to appear, though in contrast to the previous stratum it is not accompanied by the red-slipped bowls of Type B lie. The dominant type of bowl in this stratum is the small bowl of Type B IV, most of which were found in fills. Most common are the small bowls with a sharpened or a slightly carinated rim (Fig. 13:1). The type already appeared in the fills of Stratum XV (Fig. 7:3-4). Kraters. The two kraters from this stratum belong to Type K II. Both are unslipped. Parallels for this type were found at 'En Shadud Stratum I A and Arad Stratum IV. Holemouth jars. The absolute number of holemouth jars reaches its peak in this stratum. Jars of Type H IIb predomi- nate (Figs. 1 3 :6- 7 ; 1 4: 1 0-1 3), but Types H Ia-b (Figs. 13:4-5; 14:6-9) and Type H IIa are also represented. The appearance of squared-off rim jars (Type H V) is note- worthy (Fig. 14:14). Though this type was represented by only a few sherds in the previous stratum, in Stratum XIV its quantity almost equals that of some of the other types. The type seems to appear late in the EB I sequence and is paral- leled in late EB IB contexts, for example, at Megiddo Stages III- I and Tell el-Far'ah (North) Bronze Ancien I. Small vessels. All the types continue to appear in more or less the same frequencies. Teapots appear as a slightly different variant, with a straight spout angled downwards (Fig. 14:3). Parallels were found at 'En Shadud in undated fills, Megiddo, Asawir, 'Afilla, Hazorea and Tell el-Far'ah (North), where they are attributed to the Enéolithique Supérieur. This type of spout apparently belongs either to wide-mouthed teapots (Amiran 1969: Fig. 11:16) or to ridged-neck teapots (Amiran 1969: PI. 9: 14). A sherd of the latter type was found in the fill of Stratum XV (Fig. 20:4). High-looped cups from this stratum (Fig. 14:4-5) have a relatively wide mouth and a short rim. Like the common variant, they are red-slipped on the exterior and the interior of the rim. The diameter of the mouth and the sloping shoulder are similar to the cups from Tell el-Far'ah (North) Tomb 11, attributed to the Enéolithique. Some of the cups from the Asawir and Kefar Glickson tombs, have the same general form. Gourd jars and straight-necked jars continue to be represented in this stratum. Storage jars. Storage jars with a bow neck and a cut rim (Type SJ lib) predominate in this stratum. Most were found in fills. A unique jar found in L. 553 (Fig. 14:15) has a very short neck and a sharpened rim. This jar is relatively small compared to the other types and is unslipped. Parallels were found at 'Afilla. Summary: Stratum XIV. The pottery repertoire of Stratum XIV does not differ significantly from that of the previous stratum, except for the appearance of holemouth jars with a squared-off rim (Type H V). We did not discern any sharp differences in the appearance of types: the general observa- tions with regard to the pottery of Stratum XV also apply to Stratum XIV. The sole exception, the appearance of the squared-off rim holemouth jars, may hint that this assem- blage is of a somewhat later date. STRATUM XIII The features attributed to this stratum, the final EB I occupa- tion level at Tel Qashish, are W. 3 12, which was built on top of W. 320, and W. 325 A, also built on top of an earlier wall with a similar orientation, W. 325B (Plan 3). These walls seal the walls of Stratum XIV and are sealed by the walls of the EB II- III fortifications (W. 308 and W. 305). No floor associ- ated with these walls was found, and the fills belonging to the next stratum, L. 520 and L. 526, reach the bases of the earlier walls. Thus, unfortunately, no pottery representing the final EB I phase of the Tel Qashish sequence can be presented. POST-XIII FILLS (Figs. 15-16) The Post-XIII fills are the construction fills beneath the stone level of L. 506, built at the same time as the city wall and the retaining wall of Stratum XII. These pottery-rich fills reach the base of W. 3 1 2, but no floor associated with this wall was discerned. The pottery discussed below contains types that are not necessarily represented in the stratified EB I loci. Typologically, however, they all belong to this period. Bowls. A unique bowl of Type B lie (Fig. 15:1) has an inverted rim and flat projections. A similar bowl was found in the burial cave of 'En ha-Naziv 134 in the Beth-Shean Valley and similarly dated to the EB I (M. Sebanne, personal communication). At Megiddo, a similar feature appears on a small bowl of this type, on which a "conoid knob and ledge- like projections might have alternated" (Engberg and Shipton 1934a: 19, Fig. 6:18b). GBW bowls of Types B Illb, B IIIc, and B Hid were found in this fill, with Type B IIIc being the most common. Some of the bowls attributed to this type belong to a special variant, with a thickened convex shelf-like rim, sharpened on the outside and inside (Fig. 16:2-3). Parallels were found at 'Afilla, Hazorea, and in the Kefar Glickson tomb. Kraters. All the kraters found in this stratum are of Type K II. The appearance of the spouted holemouth krater (Fig. 15:4) is noteworthy. A similar type of spouted krater was found at 'En Shadud Stratum I, Megiddo (Type 27B) Stages VI-IV, and Maayan Dor on the coastal plain. Holemouth jars. All the known types of holemouth jars were found in this fill. Their absolute number exceeds by far that in the previous strata, but their proportions remain the same: Type H IIb is predominant, while Type H I variants form a lesser part of the repertoire. Type H IIa, with a rounded simple rim, already appeared in Stratum XVA. Parallels for this type can be found through the latest phase in the Megiddo Stages VII- III sequence (Type 12D), at 'Afilla, and at Tell el-Far'ah (North), where it is dated to the Enéolithique Supérieur. Type H IV with a ridged rim (Fig. 19:7) appears only in this fill. The type appears to be chronologically significant, and has parallels at 'En Shadud Stratum I, Megiddo Stages V-IV, and 'Afilia. GE. Wright (1937:43) and more recently Louhivouri (1988:205) attribute the type to the EB IB. Holemouth bowls (Fig. 1 6:4-5) appeared for the first time 55</page><page sequence="96">CHAPTER 4 in Stratum XVA (Fig. 5:8). These vessels vary in diameter from 10-20 cm, and some could even be defined as "small bowls" of Type B IV. Most have a simple or slightly thick- ened rim. Since no complete vessel of this type was found, the shape of the body and base remains unknown. There are no exact parallels. A "small holemouth bowl" was found at Arad Stratum IV, but it has a different rim. The slip and surface treatment of these vessels is similar to those of the larger holemouth jars: red slip on the exterior and inside the rim. One example (Fig. 16:4) has a yellowish-brown slip and is burnished, which might suggest a connection with the GBW bowl family (Fig. 16:2-3). Small vessels. Teapots, high-looped cups (Fig. 16:7), and gourd jars (Figs. 15:8; 16:9-10) are all represented in these fills, as are small straight-necked jars of Type NJ. Two special vessels were found: one with a funnel-shaped neck (Fig. 15:7), slipped on both sides, and an almost complete small jug (Fig. 15:6), which seems foreign to the EB I repertoire in both form and manufacturing technique. The vessel is wheel-made (note the signs of string-cutting on the base) and unslipped. A possible parallel is a neck from Cave 4 at Giv'atayim, attributed to the EB I. This vessel could be a forerunner of the "Abydos" jugs of the EB II. Also noteworthy is a unique bag-shaped juglet with pierced lug handles (Fig. 16:8). Storage jars. The jars represented in the fills are mainly of Type SJ I, which began to appear in the Stratum XV fill, and Type SJ lib, known throughout the EB I sequence. Summary: Post-XIII Fills. These fills are especially note- worthy for the large quantities of vessels they yielded. There are no significant typological features in the repertoire, except for the first appearance of the ridged-rim holemouth jar. This is hardly surprising, considering that this is a construction fill, probably consisting of material dug up from the previous strata. If this is indeed the case, the "Post- XIII" level does not represent a single occupational phase but reflects the entire EB I sequence at Tel Qashish. FOOTNOTES * The contribution of Ruhama Bonfil to the typological discussion of both the EB I and the EB II- III pottery cannot be overestimated. She undertook the initial drawing, classification and stratigraphie attribution of the sherds and the following discussions are based on her work. I thank her wholeheartedly. 56</page><page sequence="97">CHAPTER 5 TEL QASHISH IN THE EARLY BRONZE AGE I Sharon Zuckerman Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem The above description of the EB I pottery at Tel Qashish, mainly from Area B, shows the ceramic assemblage to be quite homogeneous. There is no major discontinuity between Strata XV and XIV, and the chronological range of occupation seems to be of relatively short duration. Architecturally, however, the obvious difference between Stratum XV and the meager remains of Stratum XIV (Plans 2-3) warrants treating them as two separate strata. The following is a suggested correlation of the remains, based on the architectural features and their associated ceramic assemblages: Architectural Inside the Outside West of squares elements/ RC RC W.337 AF-AG/12-13 Stratum building building XVB L.566B L622Band L.579 L.531and L.605 and L.532 L.568 XVA L.566A L.622A L.527and L.528 XIV L.534 and L.553 These phases fit within the known chronological frame- work of the EB I in the north, as outlined most recently by Stager ( 1 992) and Braun (Braun 1 996a). Tel Qashish belongs within the '"En Shadud" phase, the EB IB, as represented at 'En Shadud Strata II- I, Qiryat Ata Stratum II, Asawir Stratum II, Megiddo Stages VII-IV, Beth-Shean XV-XIV, and other sites (Braun 1996a). All the main ceramic indices described by Braun as characterizing this phase were found at Tel Qashish. These include GBW carinated bowls of Wright's Types 3 and 4 and their red-slipped counterparts, rounded bowls with conoid projections, bow-rim storage jars, and grain- wash ware. Dating the end of the EB I occupation at Tel Qashish is difficult, given that the latest remains of Stratum XIII are fragmentary walls that lack associated floors. The latest EB I remains are probably represented by the "Post-XIII" construction fills beneath remains of the EB II- III, which are devoid of chronological significance. The number of diagnostic sherds recovered from floors and fills at Tel Qashish is regrettably small. All in all, less than 700 sherds were included in the sherd-count tables (Tables 2-5). If the pottery of dubious provenance attributed to the "Post-XIII" fills is not taken into consideration, the overall amount is further reduced to some 500 diagnostic sherds. This is hardly a sufficiently large database for statistical analysis, let alone for making chronological and regional assumptions. Despite the commonly held conviction that the Jezreel Valley was central to the amalgamation and development of northern Canaan in the later part of the fourth millennium, very few sites attributable to this period have been excavated in the region: 'En Shadud, Megiddo, 'Afilla, Hazorea, and Tel Kishion. Of these, only 'En Shadud was not disturbed by later activities and can be regarded as the EB IB type site in the Jezreel Valley (Braun 1985). Other sites known from the many surveys conducted in the region (Zori 1977; Thompson 1979; Raban 1982; De-Cree 1990) can serve as a background for reconstructing the settlement pattern in the valley. Their contribution to our understanding of the devel- opment of EB I material culture, however, is small. This situ- ation warrants the fullest possible publication of every stratified EB I site in the region. The Tel Qashish pottery assemblage is clearly domestic in nature. The most common types are holemouth jars (65% of the assemblage), bowls (14%), and storage jars (12%). Small closed vessels, such as high-looped cups, gourd jars, teapots, and juglets, are much less common (together amounting to 7% of the assemblage). This is not unusual for a settlement site, where most of the excavated area was probably used for household activities such as the preparation, consumption, and storage of foodstuffs (Falconer 1995). The absence of vessels that had special functions, such as small containers and pedestalled bowls, indicates the mundane nature of the area. The pottery production techniques reflected in the assem- blage are quite limited. Most of the vessels are hand-made, with no signs of wheel-throwing or decoration by means of a tournette. The only exception is the GBW bowls discussed below. Three main types of ware can be discerned: 1 . The most common ware, characterizing the majority of vessel types (i.e., bowls, kraters, small vessels, and storage jars), is light buff clay with small grits. These vessels are usually slipped on the outside and interior of the rim. The slip varies in color from red to reddish- brown. Some vessels are unslipped. 2. Holemouth jars are made of a coarser ware, usually buff to brownish in color. The main characteristic of this ware is its many medium-sized inclusions, sometimes crystal- line in appearance. This indicates that the vessels were used for cooking, as shown also by the traces of soot observed on some of the sherds. 3. Three types of GBW bowls at Tel Qashish constitute 57</page><page sequence="98">CHAPTER 5 approximately 30% of the bowl repertoire (Table 2). An additional type, B Ilia (Wright's Type 1), is represented only by unstratified sherds and was not included in the sherd-count table. The ware characterizing these bowls is gray and relatively fine. The slip varies in color from dark through lighter gray to yellow. The bowls with conoid projections of Type B Illd tend to have a darker brownish or reddish slip. Since the ware and typical form of these bowls differ from the rest of the assemblage, they should be treated as a special "family." A notable phenomenon is the so-called "imitations" or "hybrid" bowls, which share the form of the GBW bowls (i.e., carinated or with conoid projections) but are made of the more common red- slipped buff ware (Fig. 23:10-14). The implications of this are discussed below. GBW bowls of all four types, together with a few representa- tive red-slipped bowls of Type B lib, were analyzed petro- graphically by Y. Goren (Goren and Zuckerman 2000). The GBW vessels analyzed originate mainly at northern sites, but a few southern examples were also included. The following results characterize the Tel Qashish examples and are gener- ally applicable to other sites. All GBW types were locally manufactured. However, there is an important pétrographie difference between the various types. Bowls of Wright's Type 1, the early type with or without rope decoration (Types B Ilia and B Illb in the Tel Qashish typological scheme), were usually made of foraminiferous marl clay with grog and calcareous sand or crushed calcite temper (Ibid.: 173-176). This pétrographie family is traced to northern or central Israel, a wide definition that precludes specific sourcing of the material. All the carinated bowls of Wright's Type 3 (our Type B IIIc) and the bowls with conoid projections of Wright's Type 4 (Type B Illd) are also made of foraminiferous marl clay, but the typical temper is basaltic/calcareous sand. The same kind of ware also characterizes the Tel Qashish red-slipped carinated bowls and the gutter-rim bowls of Type B lib. The existence of basaltic inclusions points to the basalt outcrops of the western Jezreel Valley as the possible source of the raw materials used in the manufacture of these bowls (Goren 1991:131, Fig. 17:C). It is unlikely that there are functional reasons for the use of different tempers in the various types of GBW bowls found at Tel Qashish. These types share the same general form of an open carinated bowl, and were found in similar contexts at settlements and in tombs. The reason for the differences seems to be chronological, reflecting a preference for different raw materials in the EB IA and the EB IB. Bowls of Types B Ilia and B Illb were found at Tel Qashish only in unstratified contexts. These bowls are considered one of the hallmarks of the EB IA in northern Israel (Braun 1991). Tel Qashish was probably not yet occupied in this period, and the few Type B Ilia sherds (Fig. 23:1-2) were in all likelihood not manufactured at the site or in its close vicinity. It is clear that the pétrographie profile of the Tel Qashish EB IB assemblage is quite homogeneous. All the vessels examined are made of the same raw material and temper, and were probably manufactured not far from the site (Goren 1991:131, Fig. 17:C). It should be borne in mind, however, that only bowls of regionally significant types were chosen for analysis. The inclusion of a wider range of types, for example, holemouth jars and storage jars, might have changed this picture. The pétrographie data are essential for an attempt to reconstruct the level of pottery production reflected in the Tel Qashish assemblage. It seems that the conclusions reached by Esse for the production and distribution of Crackled Ware (Esse 1989a) are also valid in our case. The extreme regionality of types and the relatively small distribu- tion ranges of the vessels indicate a lower level of produc- tion. This regionality is reflected in the pétrographie analysis and in the spatial distribution of types. The parallels cited for the Tel Qashish EB I types come from a limited number of sites, mostly in the western Jezreel Valley and neighboring Acco Valley (Louhivouri 1988; Braun 1997), principally Megiddo, 'En Shadud, 'Afula, Hazorea, and the unpublished sites of Tel Megadim and Qiryat Ata. Others sites that share some types with Tel Qashish are Asawir, Kefar Glickson, Beth ha-'Emeq, Rosh ha-Niqra, and Tell el-Far'ah (North), and there are one or two parallels at more distant sites (Arad, 'Ai, and Arqub e-Dahr). Thus, on the one hand, a large-scale pottery distribution system cannot be reconstructed for this period. On the other hand, the relatively advanced tech- nology involved in the manufacture of the GBW bowls is beyond the capability of a part-time potter working only to serve the needs of his/her own household, i.e. "household production" in Van-der-Leeuw's definition (Arnold 1985; Sinopoli 1991:98-102). GBW bowls of Wright's Type 3 have often been found in large numbers in a single context, usually in tombs (Dothan 1970; Yannai 1996), showing considerable standardization in size, form, and surface treat- ment. Minimal variation and overall standardization of the vessels are considered to be characteristics of a more advanced manufacturing system involving full-time potters, a workshop, or a village industry (Esse 1989a; Braun 1996a:23 1-232). The deterioration in the quality of the slip and burnish of the GBW bowls of Wright's Type 3 as compared to those of his Type 1 (GE. Wright 1958:44) was already described by the Megiddo excavators (Engberg and Shipton 1934a:64). This reduced investment in slips and burnishing also reflects a more commercial and larger-scale level of production (Esse 1989a:88). Another aspect of the pottery production system is the so- called "GBW-imitation" bowls (Fig. 23), first observed by the Megiddo excavators (Engberg and Shipton 1934a). These were also described by GE. Wright, who referred to the GBW bowls as an ". . . ''intrusive' or imported element in a native horizon. Yet they were imitated in local clays..." (1958:40*; emphasis mine). The existence of red-slipped counterparts of GBW bowls of the early and late types was laternotedbyBraun(1985:65-66; 1997:60). Esse referred to these bowls as mere variations of the "traditional" GBW forms (Esse 1989a:90), while Braun sees them as reflecting two pottery-making traditions that existed side by side (1985:38, 65-66). This phenomenon should be viewed within the overall framework of EB I pottery production systems. Red-slipped bowls imitating the forms of Wright's Type 1 already appear in EB IA contexts at sites such as Yiftahel (Braun 1997), 58</page><page sequence="99">TEL QASHISH IN THE EARLY BRONZE AGE I 'Afilla (Sukenik 1948: Pl. VI: 15), Beth-Shean Stratum XVI (Fitzgerald 1935:9-10, Pl. III: 1-4), and Tell esh-Shunah North (Rowan 1 994: 128). They flourish in the EB IB, along- side GBW bowls of Wright's Type 3, ať En Shadud (Braun 1985), Megiddo Stages VII-IV (Engberg and Shipton 1934a), Asawir (Dothan 1970; Yannai 1996), Qiryat Ata (A. Golani, personal communication), and Tell el-Far'ah (North) (de Vaux and Steve 1 949: Fig. 2:5). The fact that both GBW bowls and their red-slipped counterparts were found in the same contexts and that they were made from the same raw materials (Y. Goren, personal communication) prohibits the reconstruction of a central workshop producing GBW bowls together with local household production manufac- turing the red-slipped imitations. It suggests, rather, that both types were made in the same workshops, supplying the different needs of their customers. The GBW bowls are conspicuous in the EB I repertoire because of their unusual shape and distinctive appearance; their possible relation to silver vessels has recently been suggested again (Philip and Rehren 1996). Their production required more skill and experience than the manufacture of the red-slipped vessels. The production of "imitations" of distinct GBW forms could have been the result of an increasing demand for these vessel forms.1 We can conclude that the EB I pottery assemblage from Tel Qashish reflects production in a village-based system. The pottery workshops were located in the Jezreel Valley, perhaps in its western part, from where they traded outside the area. The physical remains of the production centers have not yet been found, but the manufacturing techniques and the patterns of vessel distribution are good indicators of such a system. Tel Qashish might have been one of these sites. An accurate reconstruction of the dynamics of this system, whether centered in village workshops, as suggested here, or in the hands of itinerant professional potters, is impossible, given our present state of knowledge (Braun 1996a:232). This suggestion, however, is valid mainly for the EB IB, when regional ceramic distinctions are very clear.2 Braun suggests that there was a production center of basalt bowls in the Jezreel Valley (Braun 1990), and a similar suggestion might be made for pottery production. Such a small-scale exchange system during the EB I, carried out within the boundaries of distinct regions, may also be compared to the system suggested by Rosen (1989) for the production and distribution of flint tools, especially Canaanean blades and fan-scrapers. While simpler tools were manufactured within the sites themselves, the produc- tion of specialized tools was centralized within each region and distributed from its center of manufacture. Such centers were identified by the occurrence of blade cores exclusively at these sites (Ibid.:208-209). In conclusion, it seems that the GBW bowls and their red- slipped "imitations" provide an example of the dynamics of the EB IB pottery production system. The system was village-based and served the different needs of the inhabit- ants of these sites. Some specialized families, such as GBW and Crackled Ware and their "imitations," were distributed to a limited region around their production sites (Esse 1989a). Inter-regional trade was on a small scale, compared to the EB II pottery trade system (see below). Note on Terminology and Chronology In the ceramic and architectural discussions, the traditional division of the EB I in northern Israel into two phases has been used (GE. Wright 1958; Joffe 1993:39-41). The early phase, the EB IA, is identical to Braun's "Yiftahel II" horizon, best represented at this site ( 1 99 1 ). An earlier phase within the EB I, Braun's "lost horizon," constituting the "missing link" between the Chalcolithic and EB I periods in northern Israel, is yet to be defined (1996a: 104-106). The later phase, EB IB, is best represented at 'En Shadud Strata II- I and designated the "En-Shadud phase" by Braun ( 1 985). The assemblages from Qiryat Ata Stratum II, Asawir Stratum II and tombs (Dothan 1970; Yannai 1996), Megiddo Stages VII-IV (Engberg and Shipton 1934a), Tel Megadim (S.R. Wolff, personal communication), and Tel Qashish are attributed to this phase. The ceramic indices of this phase, among other types, are GBW bowls of Wright's Types 3 and 4 and grain-wash ware. The sites designated by Braun as "Advanced Early EB I," as well as those attributed to the later "Post-GBW" phase and the "Latest Phases" (1996a:240, Table VII.A/1), can be associated with this phase. The determination of a "Post-GBW" horizon, the fourth phase in Braun's chronological sequence, seems to be premature. It is noteworthy that most of the sites in which this phase was identified, Tel Kitan, Beth-Shean, Beth Yerah and Tell Um Hammad, are located in the northern and central Jordan Valley (Braun 1996a: 107, n. 79). This area is known to have had a distinct regional character throughout the EB I (Esse 1989a; Braun 1996a:207-208). The existence of strata designated "Post-GBW" at other sites, located in the Acco and Jezreel Valleys, is less clear. The sites mentioned by Braun are Tel Megadim, Megiddo, and Asawir. At both Asawir and Megadim, GBW bowls of Types 3 and 4 appear until the last phase of the EB I (E. Yannai and S.R. Wolff, respectively, personal communication). The ceramic assem- blage of Megiddo Stage III is transitional, containing both early EB I and later EB II elements (Engberg and Shipton 1934a: Chart). However, the problematic nature of the Megiddo Stages publications must be taken into consider- ation, and the definition of a chronological phase solely on the basis of the Megiddo material is hazardous. The "Post-GBW" horizon, characterized by the absence of GBW bowls of Types 3 and 4, should be regarded as a regional phenomenon. Assemblages belonging to this horizon are found at sites in the Jordan Valley and its vicinity. These sites should be seen as contemporaneous with sites of the "'En Shadud" phase in the Jezreel and Acco Valleys, and Tel Qashish is representative of this group. This phenomenon is a good example of the diversity of EB I material culture, in which "...contemporary indices show different patterns of distribution with no sense of uniformity and no clear boundaries" (Braun 1 996a:237). The pétrographie profile of the GBW bowls of Types 3 and 4, two important hallmarks of the "'En Shadud phase," further demonstrates their limited regional range. Our present state of knowledge of the EB I in northern Israel, although expanded by recent excavations and publi- cations, does not yet allow for a finer phasing of this period. The situation seems to be different in the southern part of 59</page><page sequence="100">CHAPTER 5 Israel, with evidence of intensive cultural ties with Egypt (Alon and Yekutieli 1995; Levy et al. 1995). As for the absolute dating of this period, even fewer data exists for northern Israel. Recent 14C analyses push the date of the beginning of the EB I into the first half of the fourth millennium BCE (Joffe 1993:41). In southern Canaan the Egyptian connections constitute the basis for a finer chrono- logical division, while in the north only two imported Egyptian vessels have been found, at Asawir (Yannai and Grosinger 2000:160-161). Although this find may contribute to the correlation with Egypt, its significance is still being assessed. The possible connection of the EB I pottery repertoire to the succeeding EB II and EB III assemblages is not well defined. The two periods differ in most respects, such as the variety of types and the manufacturing techniques involved. However, some vessels in the EB I assemblage can be regarded as prototypes of later EB II- III types. These include bowls with a triangular rim (Fig. 5:1) that are forerunners of EB II platters, the "proto-Abydos" juglet found in the construction fills of the EB II- III fortification system (Fig. 15:6), and holemouth jars and ledge handles. These types reflect some continuity between the two periods, a continuity that may also be identified in the architectural traditions characterizing these periods. FOOTNOTES 1 Local imitations of imported vessels and special families of pottery are known in the EB I in southern Canaan, where Egyptian vessels were made locally using Canaanite raw materials (Brandl 1989). 2 A similar reconstruction was suggested for EB IA Yiftahel on the basis of the jar repertoire (Braun 1997:55-56). It is note- worthy that the distribution of GBW bowls of the earlier Type 1, typical of Yiftahel and other sites belonging to its horizon, covers much larger areas (Braun 1991). Sherds were found as far south as the Palmahim quarry and as far east as Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq. A possible red-slipped variant of this type can be recognized at 'Ai (Marquet-Krause 1949: Pis. LXXIV:1055, LV: 1 055). The production of these vessels might be attributed to different workshops or even different potters, whether itin- erant potters, as suggested by Braun (1997:56), or specialist potters at the sites themselves. In any event, the raw materials are local, and the vessels are manufactured in the vicinity of the site. The products of these skilled potters, contrary to the more domestic functional types, might have been traded outside their sites and even outside their area of manufacture. 60</page><page sequence="101">CHAPTER 6 THE STRATIGRAPHY OF THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III Amnon Ben-Tor and Ruhama Bonfìl Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem AREAB STRATUM XII (Plans 5-10) The most important architectural element in Area B in Stratum XII is the fortification wall, W. 305, ca. 30 m of which were excavated in the northeastern part of the site. Another segment (W. 241) of the same fortification system was found in Squares W-X/ 1 3- 1 4 in Area A (Plans 1 3-22). The average width of the wall is 2.7 m (Photo 17). It is a surprisingly thick fortification wall, relative to the size of the site. The wall is made of a stone foundation and a mudbrick superstructure, most of it eroded. Only a few bricks, found in Square AG/13, survived. The outer and inner faces of the stone foundation are built of rather large, rough field stones placed on their narrow sides in herringbone fashion (Photo 5). The fill between the inner and outer faces of the wall is made of small stones (Photo 17). The fortification element W. 24 1 in Area A is constructed using the same tech- nique (Photo 50). The segment of the wall excavated in Area B is located in the lowest part of the site, and the gate must also have been located in this area. The ramp leading up to it on the northern slope of the mound, running northwest to northeast, is clearly visible in the aerial photographs (Photos 2-3). The excava- tion conducted at the upper end of the ramp, in Squares AD-AF/12, failed to expose the gate, which was completely eroded. The western edge of the wall was preserved in Squares AG/12-13 up to the very point at which it presum- ably met the gate. Photo 17. Stratum XI walls superimposed on Stratum XII fortifica- tion wall. As this was the lowest part of the site, one of the problems that had to be dealt with was run-off rainwater, which had to be collected or channeled away from the settlement. Two drainage channels were found in the excavated part of the wall. The features of the two channels differ: the first, L. 524 in Square AG/13, is 60 cm wide and was clearly part of the original construction plan of the wall (Photo 18). A similar drain was found at Tell el-Far' ah (North) (see the discussion of the EB II-III architecture below, Chapter 7). The second, L. 577 in Squares AH-AI/14, transverses the wall in a crooked line, and seems to be a weep hole rather than a drainage channel (Photo 19) (see the discussion of the EB II-III architecture below, Chapter 7). Photo 18. Drainage channel in fortification wall. Wall W. 308+ W. 342 runs parallel to the fortification wall on the outside (Photo 20). The northwestern part of the wall is eroded at more or less the same point at which the gate, as well as the fortification wall, are eroded away. This wall most probably served as a retaining wall for W. 305. Similar retaining walls of Early Bronze Age fortifications were found at Taanach, as well as at Khirbet Zeiraqoun in Jordan. After running 12 m in a southeasterly direction, parallel to the fortification wall, W. 308+W. 342 joins W. 305 in a straight corner, connected by means of W. 345. The area between the fortification wall and its retaining wall (L. 506 and L. 58 1 ) was filled with small stones and earth (Photo 21). The fill underlying these elements, L. 520+L. 526, contained 61</page><page sequence="102">CHAPTER 6 Photo 19. Drainage channel and walls outside fortification wall. a large amount of EB I sherds (Figs. 15-16, pp. 40-41), probably dug up from the previous strata by the builders of the EB II- III fortifications. Both the fortification wall and the retaining wall are founded directly on top of the EB I walls W. 312 and W. 325 (Photos 5-6, 20). The drained water was channeled down a paved slope, towards the northwest (Photo 19). Another drain, L. 367 in Photo 21. Stone fill between fortification and retaining walls. Photo 20. Retaining wall of fortification wall. Square W/15 in Area A (Plan 21), channeled the rainwater from the residential area into the street that runs parallel to the fortification wall W. 24 1 . Due to the poor state of preser- vation of the wall in this area, it is not known at which point the water was drained out of the settlement. Very little is known about the earliest dwellings that were contemporaneous with the construction of the fortification wall. The subdivision of these dwellings into strata or phases is difficult. In general, three phases were discerned in Area B, designated XIIC, XIIB, and XIIA. The walls attributed to XIIC are contemporaneous with the construction of the forti- fication wall, while those attributed to XIIA belong to its last stage, although it is not possible to determine definitively whether W. 305 continued in use in Stratum XIIA (see below). The walls and floors attributed to Stratum XIIB, however, may have already been in use in Stratum XIIC, or may have continued in use in Stratum XIIA. This situation is typical of a settlement that existed in peaceful conditions, without exposure to catastrophes that might have resulted in drastic changes in its architectural plan. Strata XIIC-XIIA may therefore be regarded as three phases of a single stratum, as in the case of the three building phases of the MB II settle- ment (Stratum IX) in Area A (see below), which had a simi- larly peaceful, uninterrupted existence. 62</page><page sequence="103">THE STRATIGRAPHY OF THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III STRATUM XIIC (Plans 5-6) The important loci of Stratum XIIC are L. 126 in Squares AG-AH/13-14 (Fig. 24) and L. 516 in Square AH/14 (Fig. 25:1-3). There may have been an alley running along the inner face of the fortification wall (Section B-B' in Squares AG-AI/14), similar to that in Area A. This alley is composed of L. 518B (Fig. 26:1-4) in the north and stone- paved L. 523B in Square AG/13 (Fig. 26:5-7). The latter locus seems to have been paved because of its proximity to the drain. The alley continues southwards into L. 126, leading through an opening in W. 310 into a building about which very little is known, since the excavation was not sufficiently deep. The above-mentioned entranceway, the fragmentary wall W. 319, and pilaster W. 321 are the only parts of the building excavated thus far. It was built against the inner face of the fortification wall, indicating that the alley ended at this point. L. 5 1 6 is the earliest floor of the building. The locus under- neath, L. 529 in Square AH/14 (Section B-B' in Squares AG-AI/14; Photo 22), yielded exclusively EB I pottery (Fig. 25:4-7), indicating that the construction of the building and the laying of floor L. 516 were contemporaneous with the construction of the fortification system. A building was found to the west of the paved section of the alley, bounded by W. 110 on the south, W. 306B on the north, W. 307B on the east, and W. 346 on the west. The actual connection between W. 307B, W. 346, and W. 1 1 0 was not exposed, since the excavation ceased before it reached the floor of this room. W. 322 forms part of the entrance into the paved alley in the next phase, Stratum XIIB. A similar wall that flanked the entrance into the alley in Stratum XIIC is covered by the later wall (Photo 23). It is possible that another unit, of which W. 1 10 constituted the northern wall, already existed in this early stratum (see below under Stratum XIIB [Plan 7]). Photo 22.

Stratum XII structures (note the "water reservoir" in the background). course of W. 283 was preserved, and it seems that it is indeed associated with W. 305 (Photo 24). W. 362 is the most massive of the walls found in the resi- dential area. Too little of it was preserved to be able to deter- mine any coherent plan (Photo 24). Pavement L. 626 is associated with this wall on the east. A similar paved area associated with W. 358 on the south (Photo 25) may have continued eastward, running up to the western face of W. 362, thus connecting W. 358 and W. 362 within one system. The pavement, L. 625 (Fig. 27:12-18), slopes from north to south, creating a difference in elevation of 0.3 m over a distance of 4 m (Photo 26). At some stage, a hard fill made of crushed chalk, L. 522 (Fig. 27: 1-1 1), was laid over Photo 26. The "water reservoir" and W. 283. the stone pavement (Photo 27). It is impossible to determine whether these two parts of the pavement represent two separate stratigraphie phases or two technical phases of the same pavement, though the latter seems more probable to us. The chalk surface has a concrete-like appearance and is Photo 27. Detail of the "water reservoir". 66</page><page sequence="107">THE STRATIGRAPHY OF THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III watertight. A yellow-greenish patina, probably caused by an extremely humid environment, covers all the sherds found in this area. The system may, therefore, have functioned as a water reservoir (see the discussion of the EB II-III architec- ture below, Chapter 7). It is difficult to determine what happened to this system in subsequent periods: on the one hand, W. 283 seems to run over it, but, on the other, no later structure was found in the area and it consistently remained empty of buildings. Later sherds of the Middle Bronze and Iron Ages were found deep down, almost at the same eleva- tion as the floor of L. 522. Finally, L. 530 in Square AI/16 (Fig. 28) is attributed to Stratum XIIC, although it is not directly related to any of the structures in the vicinity (Photo 24). The elevation of this floor, however, is similar to that of the other Stratum XIIC floors and lower than that of the floors of Stratum XIIB. Its designation as a floor is supported by the presence of a complete storage jar (Fig. 28:5; Photo 55, p. 157). Fig. 25. Area B: L. 516 (Stratum XIIC) and the locus below it, L. 529 (EB I).

On top of this wall, as well as on top of the fill between it and W. 305, a surface of crushed chalk, L. 567 and L. 569 (Fig. 29), was laid. This surface also covers the drain, L. 577, attributed to the previous stratum. Walls W. 282, W. 284, and W. 335 are founded on top of this surface, at right angles to W. 305. Walls W. 282 and W. 335 are clearly connected with the fortification wall, while W. 284 seems to be associated with W. 279, constructed on top of W. 305 (Photos 28-29). The fortification wall W. 305 probably continues in use during the next phase, Stratum XIIA (see discussion below). If W. 279 is not interpreted as some sort of reinforcement for a weakness in W. 305, its construction on top of W. 305 cannot be explained. The function of the projecting walls W. 282 and W. 335 is difficult to understand. The question of whether the dwell- ings of this stratum were also constructed outside the forti- fied settlement must remain unanswered until further investigation. It should be noted, however, that the 70 assemblage attributed to L. 567 and L. 569 (Fig. 29) is similar to that found in the dwellings inside the settlement. Another change observed was in the drainage channel L. 524, which was narrowed to only 0.25 m by W. 316 built inside it (Photo 30). No change was discerned in the entrance to the alley, L. 523A (Fig. 30), except for the raising of the stone pavement, associated in Stratum XIIB with the narrowed drainage channel. Walls W. 306A and W. 307A in Squares AG/ 13-14 were rebuilt a little further to the north and east, respectively, as compared with Stratum XIIC. The space between them remained unchanged and, as opposed to the previous stratum, the excavation reached its floor, L. 276+L. 517 (Fig. 31). The entrance to the room was probably in its southeastern corner. W. 336, constructed in Stratum XIIB, adds another unit to the west of L. 517. This unit is bounded by W. 1 10, W. 271, W. 336, and W. 346, and was probably entered from the northwest. L. 563 in Square AF/13 is yet another unit, the northern- most found thus far. It is bounded by W. 306A and W. 336 on the south, the fortification wall W. 305 on the east, and</page><page sequence="111">Plan 7. Area B: Stratum XIIB. I 1a » i Plan 8.

Its northern part is eroded, as is the northern part of the fortification wall and the possible gate, the location of which is suggested to have been in this area (see above). L. 563 may have been part of an open area, a kind of piazza, in the vicinity of the gate. L. 583 replaces L. 126 and L. 503 (Fig. 32) replaces L. 5 16 of Stratum XIIC. (Section B-B1) Both have new floors in Stratum XIIB. The main change in this area is the blocking of the entranceway in W. 310 (Photo 31). The division of Stratum XIIB into two phases in Squares AG-AH/14 is noteworthy. W. 341, built across the top of W. 307A (Squares AF-AG/13-14), blocks the alley. The entranceway in W. 310 (in Square AH/14) is also blocked, indicating that the alley that ran along the wall in the previous phase went out of use in Stratum XIIB. As noted above, a unit with W. 1 10 as its northern wall may already have existed in Stratum XIIC. Its existence in Stratum XIIB is certain: in addition to W. 110, the unit is bounded by W. 113, W. 115, and W. 27 1 . The excavation did not reach the foundations of these walls, nor was the floor L. 609 of Stratum XIIB removed to explore the possibility of the existence of an earlier floor in this location. Thus, the question of whether the unit already existed in Stratum XIIC remains unan- swered. No entrance to the Stratum XIIB unit was found, though the walls were preserved to a considerable height (see also below). Two beaten earth floors were discerned, L. 603 (Photo 32) and L. 609 (Fig. 33), which differ in elevation by 8 cm. It is not clear whether L. 603 is only an accumulation on top of floor L. 609 or whether these indeed are two separate floors corresponding to the two Stratum XIIB stages observed in this area, represented by the blocking of the entranceway in W. 310 and the construction of W. 341. Another unit, L. 606 and L. 615 (Photos 33-34), was found to the south of the L. 603 and L. 609 room. It is note- worthy that these two adjacent units, L. 603/L. 609 to the north and L. 606/L. 615 to the south, do not share a common wall. W. 275 is built up against the southern face of W. 1 1 5 to its north. This may indicate a lapse of time between the construction of these two units, and that one was completed before the other was started (Photo 33). Photo 32. Room L. 603 (note reinforced corners). The southern unit is bounded by walls W. 275, W. 280, W. 281, and W. 353. It is divided in two by W. 352. All these walls are preserved to more or less the same height and their uppermost courses are leveled, indicating that the preserved remains represent the stone foundations of walls that had a mudbrick superstructure, which is completely eroded. All the walls of the settlement must have been of this nature. No entranceway into any of the rooms of the unit was found. The only options for access are in the northeastern corner of the northern room and the southeastern corner of the southern room. This is suggested on the grounds that the northern and southern extremities of W. 353 were not exposed. A diffi- culty in accepting these possible locations of the entranceways, however, is the fact that no entrance into unit L. 603/L. 609 was found, even though its walls were exposed to their entire length. The problem of the entrances into the various units is addressed below. The only clearly defined floor in the southern unit is L. 6 1 5 (Fig. 34), part of which is made of stone slabs that end in a straight line at a distance of about 1 m from W. 280 (Photo 34). Thus, it appears that some kind of installation must have been located in the corner of W. 280 and W. 352. Photo 33. Rooms of Stratum XIIB: general view. Photo 34.

The area is damaged to such an extent that all that can be said is that it contained additional dwellings. The only clearly discernible floor is L. 608 in Square AH/15 (Fig. 35). Pit L. 62 1 in Squares AH-AI/1 6 cuts into the southeastern end of an alley, most of which was found in Squares AF-AG/14-16. W. 271 and W. 280 bound the alley on the east and W. 267 on the west (Photo 35). The alley runs more or less parallel to the fortification wall and leads into the open space in the vicinity of the assumed gate. This may also explain the straight course of the northern end of the alley, bounded by W. 330. The elevation of the floor of the alley in the north, L. 561, is 47.00/46.80; it rises slightly towards the south in accordance with the topography of the site. L. 279 (Fig. 36), bounded by W. 264, W. 267, and W. 276, is the largest unit among the Early Bronze Age buildings thus far found at the site (Photo 35). No partition walls were discerned within this unit. Its western wall is located outside the excavated area. The attribution of this building to Stratum XIIB was determined by the fact that it is covered by Stratum XIIA building L. 273. The question of whether the Photo 35. Area B: general view with alley in the center, looking north. building was already founded in the previous Stratum XIIC, as in the case of several of the other Stratum XIIB structures, remains open.

The following obser- vations inform against its continuation: 1. Large parts of the wall in Squares AI-AH/14-17 are missing. 2. Some of the pottery from L. 512 in Square AG/ 13 (Fig. 37) was found on top of W. 305. 3. Several pits containing Early Bronze Age pottery (e.g., L. 599 in Squares AH/13-14) are cut into W. 305. 4. The small room bounded by W. 279, W. 284, and W. 334 (the layer of stones found in L. 557 [Fig. 44] to its east may be associated with W. 334) in Squares AI/14- 15 is built partly on top of the wall (Photos 28-29, 36). Photo 36. W. 334 and W. 284 superimposed on fortification wall. Thus, on the one hand, these observations seem to indicate clearly that the fortification wall goes out of use in Stratum XIIA, which may indeed be the case. On the other hand, the drainage channel L. 524, built in Stratum XIIC and narrowed in Stratum XIIB, is completely blocked from the outside by a thick wall W. 309 in Stratum XIIA (Photo 1 8). There would be no point in blocking a channel in a wall that was not in use. W. 322, serving as the doorjamb of an opening between it and W. 305, also seems to indicate that the latter continues in use. We are unable to determine which of these two contradic- tory sets of arguments regarding the continuation or non- continuation of W. 305 is to be preferred. The Early Bronze Age pottery found partly overlying the top of W. 305 may have been deposited there later as a result of erosion. We remain undecided on this issue (see also the discussion of Stratum XI). Within the settlement, L. 512 (Fig. 37) and L. 518A in Squares AG/13-14 (Fig. 38) are two of the key loci of this stratum. Walls W. 306A, W. 307A, and W. 322 continue in use. W. Ill, separating L. 282 and L. 587, replaces the Stratum XIIB W. 346, which previously separated these units. The Photo 37.

The northern part of L. 5 1 8 A and L. 54 1 is eroded, as are the assumed gate and the northern end of the fortification wall (see the general discus- sion of Stratum XII above). The area defined as the "northern unit" in the previous stratum, now room L. 113+L. 602 (Fig. 39), continues without major changes except for the reinforcement of two of its corners (Photo 32). A more drastic change occurs in the double unit to the south. The dividing wall W. 352 goes out of use (Photos 33-34), its uppermost course now forming part of the stone pavement of one large unit, L. 139 (Fig. 40; Photo 38), another key locus of this stratum. The floor of the southern part of this large room is L. 607 (Fig. 41). The area is disturbed by the penetration of later walls (Photo 38). W. 280 and W. 28 1 were raised and function in this stratum as well. The alley L. 263 (Fig. 43) continues in use. To the west of the alley, building L. 256 and L. 273 (Fig. 42) was built on top of the previous unit, L. 279 (Photos 35 and 39). This constitutes the major change from Strata XIIB to XIIA. The building is of large dimensions, similar to those of building L. 1 39 and L. 607 on the other side of the alley, and, like the latter, its northern part is paved with stone slabs. Since the succeeding Stratum XI is entirely different in nature from Strata XIIC-XIIA, it is appropriate to describe at this point some of the general characteristics of the architec- ture of the Strata XIIC-XIIA dwellings (see also the discus- sion of the EB II- III architecture below, Chapter 7). The continuity in the general plan and layout of the build- ings throughout the three phases of Stratum XII is clearly apparent, with several of the walls serving in two or even in all three phases (Plans 5-10). 80</page><page sequence="121">Plan 9. Area B: Stratum XIIA.</page><page sequence="122">CHAPTER 6 The average thickness of the walls is 60 cm. Since no evidence of the presence of even a single supporting pillar was found, the size of the rooms must have been such that they could be roofed without any such support. Entrances were not found for most of the rooms, although the walls were preserved to a considerable height. Thus, if there were any entrances, they should have been discernible. We are unable to answer the question of how these rooms were accessed. Since the walls were not sufficiently thick to have supported a second story, access into the rooms by means of a ladder through an opening in the roof seems to be the only option. If so, this is a strange phenomenon indeed, for which no parallels are known. There is a tendency toward curvilinear walls (W. 346 in Stratum XIIC) and rounded corners (Photo 35). Typical examples are W. 283 (Stratum XIIB), the corner of W. 275 and W. 280 (Stratum XIIB), W. 357 (Stratum XIIB), and the corner of W. 1 13 and W. 1 1 0 (Stratum XIIA). W. 243 in Area A (Stratum XIIE) apparently also belongs to this group (Photo 45). As noted above, this feature, which is character- istic of the EB I both at Tel Qashish and elsewhere, continues at Tel Qashish into the later phases of the Early Bronze Age (see the discussion of the EB II- III architecture below, Chapter 7). Several walls are built in herringbone fashion, a feature that, again, is usually attributed to the EB I but continues at Tel Qashish into the later Early Bronze Age phases. In addition to the fortification wall (W. 305 [Photo 5]) and its counterpart in Area A (W. 241), Area A walls W. 229 and W. 243 and Area B walls W. 1 1 5, W. 274, W. 28 1 , and W. 283 are built in the same manner (Photos 33, 38-39). An architectural feature that is limited to Stratum XIIA is the reinforcement of corners by supports from within. This phenomenon can be seen in the corner of W. 269 and W. 272 in L. 273, the corners of walls W. 1 1 5 and W. 27 1 and W. 1 1 3 and W. 115 in L. 113+L. 602 (Photo 32), and the corner of walls W. 271 and W. 336 in L. 282 (Plan 9).

An accumulation of approximately 0.5 m of debris was found between the remains of Stratum XIIA and Stratum XI, while no such accumulations were noted between the previous strata (Photo 17; Section B-B' in Squares AG-AI/14). Thus, a chronological gap between Stratum XIIA and Stratum XI may be indicated. Another feature characteristic of Stratum XI is the delicate nature of the walls, which are thinner than those of the previous strata and constructed of small, fist- sized stones (Photo 17). The orientation of the dwellings, however, is the same as that of the previous strata, since they too had to be built in accordance with the topography of the site. The excavation of this stratum was very complicated. The walls were constructed of extremely small stones and the spaces between them full of fallen stones, making the walls exceedingly difficult to trace. In addition, the remnants of Stratum XI are very close to the surface (Photo 40; Section B-B' in Squares AG-AI/14), resulting in damage caused by pitting and recent agricultural activity. The fortification wall, W. 305, had clearly gone out of use. The eastern row of rooms, L. 1 16, L. 108, and L. 267, and the eastern wall common to these units, W. 1 12 and W. 277, were Photo 40. Stratum XI walls superimposed on Stratum XII walls. built directly on top of the course of W. 305, separated from this wall by a 0.5 m thick layer of accumulated dirt (Photo 17). The Stratum XI settlement, therefore, was not fortified. The eastern wall common to the excavated dwell- ings follows the edge of the slope and constitutes the eastern boundary of the settlement. Given its narrow width of approximately 0.4 m, it could not have had a defensive function. The dwellings have a more or less standard plan. An alley in Squares AG/14-15 bordered the dwelling on the west. Four units were excavated, each comprising two spaces. The front spaces, L. Ill, L. 104, L. 117, and L. 118, were lower than the level of the alley. Only the entrance to the northern- most of these front spaces was excavated, leading down into L. 111. The entire area to the south was disturbed by a massive wall, W. 120 (Photo 38), attributed to a later period (see below), as a result of which there are no remains of the entrances from the alley into L. 104, L. 117, and L. 118. The difference in level between the alley and the floors of the front spaces averages ca. 0.3 m. From these, as evidenced by the steps excavated between L. 117 and L. 267, steps led down into the rear spaces (from L. Ill into L. 116, from L. 104 into L. 108, from L. 117 into L. 267, and from L. 118 into L. 268). The difference between the levels of the front and rear spaces, as excavated in L. 1 1 7 and L. 267, is approxi- mately 0.2 m, making the rear spaces ca. 0.5 m lower than the alley. Thus, steps were used to compensate for the differ- ences in levels, e.g., from L. 101 into L. 1 1 1 (Photo 40) and from L. 117 into L. 267. The front spaces were probably unroofed and served as the work and service unit of the dwelling, as indicated by the installations and ovens found in L. 104, L. Ill, and L. 502 (the northern part of L. 111). The rear spaces were probably roofed and served as living quarters. Since there are hardly any remains on the western side of the alley, we are unable to determine whether similar dwellings also existed on the other side. The dating of Stratum XI is extremely difficult. The prox- imity of the remains to the surface and the effects of erosion and other massive disturbances of later periods (mainly during the Iron Age) have resulted in the destruction of floors and the mixing of the ceramic material, leaving not one floor unaffected. Three of the four front spaces were disturbed by W. 120, and three of the four rear spaces by pits. The only unaffected loci are L. 1 1 1 and part of L. 267, neither of which contained any conclusively datable finds, ceramic or other (Fig. 45). The pits, such as L. 109, L. 282, and L. 292, that cut into the walls of Stratum XI are dated to the Iron Age and even later. Thus, it can be maintained with certainty that Stratum XI predates the Iron Age. In excavating L. 596 under W. 101 of the Stratum XI building, some MB II sherds were found (Fig. 45:26-29). The most severe disturbance was caused by W. 120, with which no floor is associated. The pottery found in its vicinity is mainly Iron Age, but also includes some Middle Bronze Age sherds. If W. 120 could be dated to the Middle Bronze Age with certainty, then Stratum XI could be attributed to an earlier period, with the Early Bronze Age as the only logical candidate. If, however, an Iron Age date is assigned to W. 120, the Stratum XI could just as well be dated to the Middle Bronze Age. In that case, the dwellings would have 92</page><page sequence="133">THE STRATIGRAPHY OF THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III Plan 1 1 . Area B: Stratum XI. Plan 12.

We are divided in our opinions regarding the dating of Stratum XI. The meager available evidence makes it possible to assign this stratum to either the Early Bronze Age or the Middle Bronze Age, and a clear-cut decision in this matter cannot be reached. AREA A As noted above, the excavation did not reach any EB I archi- tectural remains in Area A. The possible existence of an EB I settlement in this area may be assumed on the basis of fills preceding the EB II-III strata, especially beneath the floor of the alley (L. 441 in Square W/14; Plan 13). These stone fills (L. 463) contained mainly EB I pottery (Fig. 2). The curvilinear wall to the south of the alley, W. 243 in Squares Y/15-16, might be attributed to this period (see below). STRATUM XII (Plans 13-23) The architectural remains attributed to Stratum XII in Area A were divided into five phases, in contrast to the three phases discerned in Area B. The correlation between these phases in the two areas is presented in the discussion of the ceramic assemblages (see Chapter 14). STRATUM XIIE (Plans 13-14) Walls W. 241 , W. 56, W. 57+W. 66, W. 69, and W. 243 repre- sent the earliest architectural remains found in Area A. W. 241 is a massively built wall, 2.7 m thick, running along the northern edge of the mound (Photo 41). This is probably part of the settlement's fortification wall, better represented in Area B (see above). Though the two parts of the fortification wall in Areas A and B do not actually connect, they are most likely two elements of the same forti- fication system, for the following reasons: 95</page><page sequence="136">CHAPTER 6 Plan 13.

Both walls run along the edge of the tel, a location appro- priate for fortifications. 2. The width and nature of the construction of both elements are identical. 3. Both walls are constructed on top of a fill containing exclusively EB I sherds (L. 457 and L. 463 in Area A [Fig. 2], andL. 520 [Fig. 16] andL. 526 [Fig. 15] in Area B Square AH/13 [Plan 5]), indicating that they were constructed at the same time. W. 57+W. 66+W. 69 runs parallel to the fortification wall at a distance of approximately 1.8 m. L. 241 (Fig. 46; Photos 41-42) and L. 441 (Fig. 47) constitute the space between these two walls. Photo 4 1 . Area A: Stratum XII fortification wall, view from above. Since the southern half of the wall, W. 57+W. 66, is covered by a Middle Bronze Age tower, only its northern face is known (Photo 43). The eastern part of the wall, W. 69, is not covered by the tower and both faces are freestanding. The width of this wall is 0.9 m, while the average thickness of the Early Bronze Age walls in Area B is 0.7 m. This reflects another difference observed between the two areas: the walls in Area A are generally more massive than those in Area B. Several construction phases were observed in the western part of the wall: W. 66 on the west seems later than W. 57 on the east. It is not clear whether these are two separate strati- graphic phases. The problem is further complicated by the Photo 42. Area A: Stratum XII fortification wall, looking south. fact that the place at which these two parts of the wall meet was damaged by later activities, as well as by the fact that both walls tilt towards the slope, making excavating down to their foundations impossible (Photo 43). The easternmost part of the wall, W. 69, also seems to have been constructed in two phases, with the inner face of the lower part of the wall built further south than that of the later wall. It is possible, however, that these are not two different stratigraphie phases, and that the tilt of the wall towards the slope has resulted in the slight northward shifting of the upper courses of the wall. W. 56 is built at a right angle to W. 69. Only the northern end of the wall was exposed, since further south it is covered by the remains of the Middle Bronze Age fortifications. Only a small part of W. 243 was exposed (Photos 44-45), and its stratigraphie attribution is problematic. Its course and construction technique differ from those of all the other walls attributed to Stratum XIIE. Since the excavation did not penetrate deep enough to expose earlier remains, W. 243 cannot be stratigraphically isolated from below.

Because of its curvilinear nature and course, it is tempting to date this wall to the EB I. However, it is associated with floor L. 446 to the west and a possible level L. 447 to the east, both of which produced post-EB I pottery (Fig. 48). Thus, an EB I dating of W. 243 is untenable. Furthermore, the stones of W. 243 were placed in a herringbone fashion (Photo 45), a technique also used in the Area B EB II- III walls, including the fortification wall. Curvilinear walls were also found in the earliest EB II- III phase in Area B (W. 346 of Stratum XIIC). Thus, the attribu- tion of W. 243 to Stratum XIIE seems probable. Photo 46.

The phases discerned in Area A are based on the changes observed in the plan of this building and its surroundings. The fortification wall W. 241, the alley L. 241, and the wall W. 66+W. 57+W. 69 bordering the alley on the south all continue unchanged. No floor attributable to Stratum XIID was discerned in L. 241, and the floor attributed to Stratum XIIE may have continued in use. If so, its associated ceramic material (Figs. 46-47) should be attributed to Stratum XIID. 100</page><page sequence="141">THE STRATIGRAPHY OF THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III Plan 15.

Paved area (Stratum XIID). The newly built Stratum XIID walls are W. 84, W. 233, and W. 244. W. 84 (Photos 44-46) may represent the southern continuation of W. 56. Since most of its course is covered by later walls, its relationship to W. 56 could not be established with certainty (Photo 46). The area to the east of W. 84 is paved with small stones, bounded by W. 84 on the west, W. 69 on the north, and W. 244, built of small stones (Photo 47), on the east (Photo 48). The area between W. 84 Photo 48. Stratum XIID walls. Photo 49. Walls of Stratum XIIC (note Stratum XIID installation on lower left). 102</page><page sequence="143">THE STRATIGRAPHY OF THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III and W. 233 is divided into two parts: the western two thirds are paved with small stones, while the eastern part has a beaten earth floor. The paved area is made of three layers of stones on top of each other: a) L. 456 (Fig. 49); b) L. 4 1 7 (Photo 46; Fig. 50:9) and L. 452 (Fig. 50: 10-17); and c) L. 410 (Fig. 50: 1-8). The earliest of these, L. 456, is laid over a layer of ash, crushed bones and small sherds. It should be noted that while the two later layers, L. 410 and L. 417 (and L. 452), are clearly asso- ciated with W. 84 (Photos 46, 51), the lowest layer, L. 456, is lower than the foundations of W. 84 and may therefore be interpreted as a foundation for the two later pavements. The paved area is bordered on three sides, the west, north and east. W. 227 on the south (Plan 1 7) belongs to Stratum XIIC, given that its foundations are higher than pavement L. 410. The earlier wall that may have delimited the paved area on the south may lie directly under W. 227; otherwise it would be difficult to explain the ending of the pavements, as well as of W. 244, precisely in line with the later wall W. 227. In the area outside the pavements to the east and south, two layers of accumulation were observed, probably corresponding to L. 4 1 0 and L. 4 1 7. These are L. 442 and L. 467 (Fig. 5 1 : 1 -5), comprising the early phase, and L. 437 (Fig. 51:6-16) and L. 453 (Fig. 5 1 : 1 7-18), comprising the later phase. The two layers on the south, L. 437 and L. 442, are higher in elevation than the two on the east, L. 453 and L. 467, due to the topog- raphy that rises from north to south. The earliest layer of earth, L. 442 (Photo 50), rests on a layer of ash similar to that on which the earliest pavement L. 456 was laid. Floor L. 437 is associated with the rim of a circular installation with a stone-paved floor sunk into it, L. 481 (Photo 49), the function of which is unknown. Two additional rounded installations were found in the northwestern (L. 479) and southeastern (L. 480) corners of the paved area. The latter installation goes out of use when it is covered by pavement L. 410. Photo 5Ü.

L. 403 is a floor covering the earlier pavements and W. 244 of Stratum XIID (Plan 15). This floor (Fig. 53:10-18) is associated with W. 227, probably built on top of an earlier Plan 17.

For some reason, the floor L. 402 does not seem to be associated with W. 84 on the west and W. 227 on the north. This may perhaps be explained by the slight tilt of these walls towards the slope. L. 394 to the south of W. 220 clearly belongs to Stratum XIIC. The excavation in this area was halted for technical reasons before reaching the floor, which should be some 20 cm lower. The existence of a floor is suggested by the presence of whole vessels in this area (Fig. 54). Photo 5 1 . Stratum XIIC W. 227 above pavement L. 4 1 7 of Stratum XIID.

The space within the building continues in use. A higher floor, L. 327 (Figs. 56-57), clearly belongs to this stratum (Photo 79). Another change is the opening of a doorway in W. 220, leading into the area of L. 327 and L. 383, the lower baskets from which come from the fill above L. 327 (Fig. 58). To the south of the entrance, probably outside the building, a floor L. 384 was discerned (Fig. 59). In the plans (Plans 2 1-22), the area to the west of L. 327 is portrayed as one large unit, bounded on the east by W. 84, on the west by W. 89, on the north by W. 66+W. 57, and on the south by the reconstructed line of W. 220 (where the excava- tion did not reach below the Middle Bronze Age strata).

It is possible that this area, in which two loci, L. 345 (Fig. 60: 1-15) and L. 346 (Fig. 60: 16-1 9), were discerned, is a large open courtyard. In the courtyard, an installation, L. 366, was found in the east (Photo 52) and a stone-paved channel, L. 367, in the northwest. Installation L. 366 is built of stones laid in a circle and has a floor made of a stone slab. To its west is a bench, L. 368, some 50 cm above the floor of the installation. The relationship between the bench and the installation, as well as their function, remain unknown. Photo 52. Installation L. 366 in courtyard L. 345.

The fortification wall, W. 241, which continued in use from the beginning of the sequence of Early Bronze Age strata excavated in Area A, goes out of use, as indicated by a small wall, W. 232, constructed on top of it. The floor associated with this small wall, L. 302 (Fig. 61), also partly covers the previous fortification wall. The same wall is associated with W. 66, which continues in use.

THE TRANSITION FROM THE EB IB TO THE EB II In the transition from Strata XV-XIII to Stratum XII, a major change occurred in the size and plan of the site. The fortifica- tion wall of Tel Qashish was built directly on top of the EB I remains in Area B, and probably also in Area A. Material from the earlier strata was used as construction fills for this wall. The line of the newly built fortification wall followed the topographical features of the tel, encompassing only the tel itself (Plan 1) and disregarding the layout of the previous stratum (Plan 4). Thus, the fortified EB II-III settlement was considerably smaller than the EB IB village (Portugāli 1 982: Table 2). The process of transition from the unfortified sites of the EB IB to the well-planned fortified sites of the EB II is crucial to our understanding of the rise of urbanization in Canaan in the fourth and third millennia BCE. This process is reflected in, among others, the different nature of the settle- ments attributed to these periods. Two groups of sites reflecting this process have been defined in a recent treat- ment of the subject (Portugāli and Gophna 1993). These are the "shrinking settlements," like Tel Qashish, and the "aban- doned settlements," which were deserted and not resettled in the succeeding period (Ibid. : 1 69-1 72). Tel Qashish is one of the smallest sites belonging to the first group, which, in the Jezreel Valley, also includes Tel Shimron and Megiddo (Ibid.: Table 1). Two models have been suggested as an explanation for this phenomenon. Portugāli and Gophna speculate that the abandonment of settlements was followed by a stage of nomadization of their inhabitants, ending in resettlement at the same sites (Ibid.: 177). According to these authors, the smaller size of the resettled sites suggests a demographic decrease in these areas, the causes of which are unknown (Ibid.: 178). Esse, on the other hand, rejects the suggestion of a significant demographic change and prefers a model of agglomeration of the population into denser sites ( 1 99 1 : 1 5 1 ). Neither of these models is easy to prove archae- ologically, but some observations regarding Tel Qashish might shed light on the issue: 1 . There is no evidence of destruction of the EB IB settle- ment. 2. There is no indication of a hiatus between the end of the EB IB and the first settlement of the EB II. The architec- tural features of the latter were built directly on top of the remains of the earlier period. Such a hiatus, if it could be proved, would help to confirm the model of Portugāli and Gophna (see the objection in Finkelstein 1995:51). 3. The general plan of the structures changes considerably from the assumed single-roomed oval and RC buildings of the EB IB to the rectangular double-roomed units of Stratum XII. This change is probably the result of an increase in the number of inhabitants and a lack of avail- able space within the smaller area of the fortified site. 4. Some continuity was observed in architectural features, such as the RC and the herringbone construction tech- niques. This, together with the continuity in some aspects of the pottery assemblage, seems to indicate that the settlement was continuously occupied by the same inhabitants throughout the transition from the EB IB to the EB II. Thus, Tel Qashish should be understood as a "shrinking site" whose population continued to live there through the transition, adapting to the limited newly fortified space. This reconstruction is more in accord with Esse's model of agglomeration. THE SIZE OF TEL QASHISH Tel Qashish is one of the smallest known fortified sites of this period: its estimated area of 10-12 dunams stands in sharp contrast to other fortified sites.1 However, all the elements that constitute the fortification system of Tel Qashish have parallels at the other fortified sites. Thus, despite its small size and apparently marginal role on the larger political scene of the EB II and EB III in northern Canaan, the forti- fied village of Tel Qashish shares the cultural and architec- tural traditions of its much larger contemporaneous neighbors. THE FORTIFICATION WALL (STRATA XIIC-XIIA) A total length of more than 35 m of the fortification wall was found in both areas of excavation (although only a small segment was excavated in Area A). The fortification system consists of the wall and other elements added to it in its various phases of use. Unlike most other fortified sites attrib- uted to the EB II and EB III, the wall continued in use through both periods without major changes or rebuilding. The wall is 2.7 m wide (Plans 5-1 0, 1 3-22) and belongs to a group of relatively thin city walls, such as those found at 125</page><page sequence="166">CHAPTER 7 Jericho (1.1 m: Kenyon 1981:97, Pl. 229b, Photo Pl. 79b), Arad (2.2-2.5 m: Amiran and lian 1 996: 1 9, 1 40), Tel Dothan (2.5 m: Helms 1977: Fig. 2), Me'ona (2.8 m: Braun 1996b:7-9), the earliest wall at Tell el-Far'ah (North) (3 m: de Vaux 1962:212-215), and possibly the wall of Tell el- Handaquq North (3 m: Mabry, Donaldson, and Palumbo 1995: 123-124). These walls can be securely attributed to the EB II. The city walls dated to the EB III at these and other sites are usually much thicker and the fortification systems more complex, for example, the walls at Taanach (4.2 m in its earliest phase: Lapp 1969: Fig. 2), Megiddo Stratum XVIII (4 mbefore its widening: Loud 1948: Fig. 391), the later wall at Tell el-Far'ah (North) (8.5-9 m: de Vaux 1962:216-217), Yarmouth (6 m: Miroschedji 1988: Pl. 6), Bab edh-Dhra' and Numeira (4 m: Rast and Schaub 1980: Fig. 5), and Kh. Zeiraqoun (7 m: Ibrahim and Mittman 1987). This observation has important implications for understanding the political situation in Canaan during the EB III. The size of a city is not necessarily reflected by the width of its fortification wall. Though Taanach is only a medium- sized site (estimated at 30-45 dunams), it is heavily fortified in at least four phases of rebuilding. Arad, on the other hand, is one of the largest cities in EB II Canaan but has a thinner wall than that of Tel Qashish, altered only slightly during its use (Amiran and Ilan 1996:140). The wall of Tel Qashish consists of a stone foundation with a mudbrick superstructure. The stones of the foundation are laid in herringbone fashion, a technique observed in Canaan from the Chalcolithic period (Eisenberg 1993:879), through the EB I and thereafter (Ben-Tor 1989). According to G.R.H. Wright, this is a universal technique "particularly suited to dry stone walling," used until the Iron Age (1985:400). The wall was apparently built in adjoining segments in a somewhat crooked line (Plan 5, Square AI/1 5). This technique is known from other EB I sites in Canaan, most notably Megiddo Stratum XVIII (Esse 1991:74 and references there). It was reported also at Bab edh-Dhra' and Numeira (Rast and Schaub 1980:42, Fig. 5; Coogan 1984: Fig. 1), as well as sites on the Lebanese coast and further north (Ben-Tor 1989). The wall in Area B, built in Stratum XIIC which is dated to the EB II on the basis of its associated pottery, was in use throughout the EB II and EB III. The question of its continued use in Stratum XIIA has been addressed in the stratigraphie discussion above. The continuation of the settlement's original plan throughout Stratum XIIA seems to support the existence of the wall in this phase too. However, there were some modifications of its attached elements; these are discussed below. The excavated segment of the fortification wall in Area A, which continued in use from Stratum XIIE to XIIA, is too small to contribute to our under- standing of this development. In Area B, two narrow openings were found in the wall (Plans 5-6). The southern opening, L. 577 in Squares AH-AI/14 (Plans 5-6, Photo 1 9), is 30 cm wide and runs in a crooked line through the wall. Since it could hardly serve for human passage, a reconstruction of this as a drainage channel makes most sense. Drainage channels incorporated into Early Bronze Age city walls are known from Tell el-Far'ah (North) (de Vaux 1961: Pl. 34; Chambón 1993:435). The channel in the Tel Qashish wall opens out towards the retaining wall attached to the city wall (Photo 19). The northern opening, L. 524 in Squares AG-AH/13 (Photos 18, 30), is 60 cm wide and may be a postern rather than a drainage channel. Its location near the assumed location of the gate strengthens this hypothesis. Posterns are a common feature in EB II fortification systems. Such narrow openings in the city walls were found at Arad (Amiran and Ilan 1996:22, Fig. 90), 'Ai, Tell el-Far'ah (North), Tel Dalit, and Kh. Zeiraqoun (Helms 1975) and were probably used for daily movement in and out of the settlement. These entrances were often sealed, perhaps during times of threat to the inhabitants. At Tel Qashish the "postern" was narrowed in Stratum XIIB by a wall (Plan 7, Photo 30), and then sealed in Stratum XIIA by a wide stone wall (Plans 9-10, Photo 18). A similar phenomenon was observed at 'Ai (Callaway 1 980: Figs. 74-75) and at Tel Dalit (Gophna 1996:29, Figs. 6, 8, 11-12). The reason for sealing the "postern" at Tel Qashish is unknown, but might be inter- preted as part of the strengthening of the fortifications in response to an external threat, also hinted at by other activi- ties in Stratum XIIA. The initial fortification system, attributed to Stratum XIIC (Plan 5), consisted of a wall (W. 308+ W. 342) parallel to the fortification wall W. 305 on the outside and attached to it by means of another wall (W. 345). The excavated length of the parallel wall is 12 m, and it probably continued northward toward the assumed gate area. These two outer walls, W. 308+W. 342 and W. 345, are wider (1.3-1.6 m) than the walls of buildings inside the city. They do not seem to be part of a domestic building (like the rooms attached to the city wall at Megiddo Stratum XVIII: Loud 1948), but should rather be seen as an integral part of the fortification system. Such elongated "towers" abutting the city wall are known from the earliest phase of the Taanach fortifications (P.W. Lapp 1969: Fig. 2) and at Kh. Zeiraqoun (Ibrahim and Mittman 1989: Fig. 2). Their purpose must have been to provide support, as they were filled with earth and small stones and have no clear floor levels. The fill of this wall at Tel Qashish contained mainly EB I sherds (Figs. 15-16) and was probably dug out of the earlier strata and laid on top of their walls (Photo 5). A different reconstruction of the function of this element assumes the existence of an opening in the fortification wall in Square AH/14. The stones of the outer face of the wall are missing only in this area. The presence of two parallel inner buttresses in the same place (W. 310 and W. 321) further supports this reconstruction. If indeed an earlier "postern" opening existed in this part of the wall, the filled area between the fortification wall and W. 308+W. 342 might have served as a ramp leading up to it. Sealing the "postern" would have rendered the ramp useless, and other elements were subsequently built on top of it (Plan 7). Helms suggests the presence of a similar "covered passage" at Taanach and Tel Dothan (1976:137-156; 1977). In Stratum XIIB, the area outside the fortification wall underwent radical changes (Plans 7-8). The parallel retaining wall/rectangular tower went out of use. The northern "postern" (L. 524) was narrowed by W. 3 1 6, and the southern drainage channel (L. 577) blocked. A different 126</page><page sequence="167">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III ARCHITECTURE system of walls perpendicular to W. 305 was constructed on top of the previous elements (Photos 1 9, 2 1 ). These walls are thinner than the earlier walls in this area and are similar to those of the buildings inside the settlement. Thus, in contrast to Stratum XIIC, the area outside the fortification wall no longer served as part of the fortification system but probably as domestic quarters (Photo 28). The space between these walls slopes gently outwards, and a possible floor level, L. 567 (Fig. 29) runs up against W. 335 from the south. It is possible that this area was used for farming-related purposes, for example, as sheepfolds or for tool storage. Similar extra- mural installations were found at Arad (Amiran and Ilan 1996:19, PI. 79). The "water reservoir" of Stratum XIIC (see below) was at least partly sealed by the walls of a domestic building constructed during Stratum XIIB (W. 283, Photos 24-26). In Stratum XIIA, there is another change in the area outside the fortification wall (Plans 9-10). The thin walls of the previous stratum are sealed by a massive wall (W. 334) built parallel to W. 305. That W. 334 dates to the EB II-III is shown by the pottery found on top of it (Fig. 44). "Postern" L. 524 is blocked from the outside by W. 309 (Photo 1 8). We can only speculate on the reason for these changes, but it seems that they were necessitated by military considerations, similar to those that led to the intensified and strengthened fortifications at many other EB III sites. In both areas of excavation, Stratum XI marks the end of the fortified Early Bronze Age settlement at Tel Qashish. In Area B, the building attributed to this stratum (Plan 11) is constructed on top of the line of the fortification wall (Photo 17). The same phenomenon occurs in Area A, where thinner walls (W. 232, W. 66, and W. 57) are built on top of the much wider fortification wall (Plan 23). The settlement of this stratum thus seems to be unfortified. Its dating is prob- lematic, although a date within the later part of the EB III cannot be ruled out (see the pottery discussion below). The building attributed to 'Afilla Stratum VII (Dothan 1993:38) is a possible architectural parallel to the Area B complex of Stratum XI. The description of "eight units, almost square rooms measuring up to 5 m, thin field-stones walls 30 cm wide" (Ibid.) is strikingly reminiscent of the Tel Qashish building. The 'Afilla building is attributed to the EB IV, although the presence of large quantities of Khirbet Kerak Ware is noted. No architectural remains were attributed to this period during the recent excavations at the site (K. Covello-Paran, personal communication). THE "WATER RESERVOIR" (STRATUM XIIC) One of the problems that faced the planners of Early Bronze Age sites in the Levant was the accumulation and storage of water within the city walls. From the end of the fourth millennium BCE, water management systems constituted an important aspect of town planning (Miller 1980:335-337). Most of the sites known from the period were located near water sources, such as springs or rivers. Access to these extramural water sources was probably defended, although no evidence of this has remained. Intramural water reser- voirs are known at two sites in Early Bronze Canaan, both located on the edge of a semi-arid zone. At Arad, runoff water from the city flowed through the radial streets towards the center of the settlement. In Area M, a large semi-natural water reservoir was used during the EB II period to accumu- late and redistribute the water to the inhabitants (Amiran and Ilan 1996: 142). The so-called "water fortress" built adjacent to this water reservoir represents one of the monumental buildings of the period (Kempinsky 1992:75; Amiran and Ilan 1996:143). At 'Ai, another type of water system was found, located in the corner of the city wall near the gate (Helms 1976:34-36). It consists of a kidney-shaped pool paved with large flat stone slabs on a layer of red clay for sealing (Callaway 1976:27-28, Fig. 7; 1993:43). The pool is 25 m wide and 2.5 m deep. The reservoir is dated to the EB III; the question of the water sources of the EB II city remains unresolved, unless the settlement relied on the spring alone, as suggested by Callaway (1993:43). Callaway's suggestion of an "Egyptian influence" in the construction of the EB III pool remains to be proven (1993:43) The situation at Tel Qashish is different. The site is located on the bank of the Kishon River, one of the perennial rivers of northern Israel, in an area with an average annual rainfall of 400-500 mm. Thus, the problem of water supply was less critical than at Arad and 'Ai. Since the Kishon drains a large area around the site, there were many seasonal and a few year-round swamps and marshes in the western part of the Jezreel Valley throughout the later periods (Ben- Artzi 1 993 ; Schor 1993:14-17). This phenomenon probably already existed in the Early Bronze Age and earlier (Esse 1991). The site thus did not require the development of runoff-water diversion and accumulation systems like those at other contemporary sites in the more arid zones of southern Canaan and Transjordan (Mabry, Donaldson, and Palumbo 1995:124-126). However, a certain amount of water probably had to be stored within the walled area of the settle- ment for the use of the inhabitants or their livestock during the year (Miller 1980:337). A possible "reservoir" suitable for this purpose was found in the southern part of Area B; it was attributed to the first fortified settlement of Stratum XIIC (Plans 5-6, Photos 25-27). A detailed description of these remains is presented in the stratigraphie discussion above. The suggested reconstruction of this installation as a "water reservoir" is based on its stone-built walls and the dense layer of crushed chalk covering its surface, similar to the remains found at 'Ai (Callaway 1976:27-28, Fig. 7). The complete plan and size of the Tel Qashish "reservoir" are unknown, but its presence and possible connection with the fortification wall suggest a high level of planning and public works carried out by the Tel Qashish inhabitants in the EB II. DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE The architectural elements dated to the EB II-III represent the first public works activities of the inhabitants of Tel Qashish. Remains of domestic architecture, however, are characteristic of both the EB I and the EB II-III strata, allowing for a comparison between the details of the domestic architecture attributed to these periods. The first domestic buildings attributed to the EB II 127</page><page sequence="168">CHAPTER 7 settlement are contemporary with the construction of the fortification wall in Stratum XIIC (Plan 5). Little is known about the plan and internal organization of the site in this phase, but it clearly marks the starting point of the plan that would develop in the succeeding phases of Stratum XII. Most of the walls attributed to Stratum XIIC continue in use in Stratum XIIB, and only the "water reservoir" is unique to the earliest phase of the fortified site. Strata XIIB and XIIA in Area B show a significant conti- nuity in plan (Plans 7-10). All the houses are rectangular, except for one irregularly shaped room (L. 517, Plan 7). Since no entrances were preserved, it cannot be determined whether the buildings are broad- or long-houses. The walls are quite thin, 60-70 cm wide. An interesting feature is the use of "independent" walls, whereby adjacent units do not share the same walls (Plan 7). This could be explained either chronologically, assuming that one of the rooms was built later and separately from the other, or as a result of other factors, such as a social distinction between the inhabitants of the two units. Some of the corners of the rooms, especially in Stratum XIIB, are angled on the inside and rounded on the outside (Plan 7, the corners of W. 283 andW. 357, W. 275 and W. 280, and W. 110 and W. 113). This might represent a continuity of tradition from the EB IB, noted at a number of other EB II sites (see the discussion of RC buildings in Chapter 3). The rooms are occasionally stone paved, but more often have earthen floors. The main building in Area B is divided into two rooms in Stratum XIIB and becomes a one-room unit in Stratum XIIA. Double-roomed domestic units are known at other sites of the period, such as Tel Kishion (Arnon and Amiran 1981; 1993), Kh. Zeiraqoun (Ibrahim and Mittman 1989), and Tell el-Far' ah (North) (de Vaux 1961: Pl. XXXIV). The size of the rooms at Tel Qashish in Stratum XIIB is small compared to other sites of the period. The main units are L. 606 (10 m2) and L. 615 (14 m2), making the total area of the house 24 m2, L. 603 (8 m2), and L. 279 (± 34 m2). At Arad, for example, the smallest units measure between 33 and 42 m2 (Marfoe 1 980; Amiran and Ilan 1996:142). Due to the limited exposure, further analysis of the dwelling units at Tel Qashish is not possible. In Stratum XIIA, a few changes in the size and internal organization of the units can be discerned (Plan 9). The main unit, L. 1 39, is no longer divided into two rooms, and encom- passes an area of almost 30 m2. The room to the west, L. 256, is probably similar in size. In the smaller rooms, the addition of stones in the inner corners might have served structural needs (similar "strengthened corners" are known at Beth- Shean in the large building attributed to the EB IB; D. Weinblatt, personal communication). The reasons for enlarging the unit of L. 139 could be diverse and may reflect social or economic changes, probably the same as those that brought about the enlargement of the Area A building in Stratum XIIB (see below). It is difficult to differentiate between rooms and open courtyards. The area between the fortification wall and the buildings might have served as a private courtyard or as a public alley, similar to that in Area A (Plans 13-21). No installations of daily use, such as benches, silos, hearths, or ovens, were found in the buildings or their vicinity. The function of the different units is, therefore, difficult to recon- struct. The pottery distribution in the various units is of little help in this respect. The pottery assemblages from most of the loci are quite diverse, with the majority of the vessel types being represented. However, in a number of units the pottery assemblage might hint at a special function of the rooms. In L. 279 (Plan 7), for example, the number of storage jars is relatively large, and the room may have served for storage. In L. 608, in the same stratum, the relative number of open vessels, especially bowls and platters, is larger, possibly suggesting that this area served other functions. These observations, however, should be viewed with caution, as they are based on small assemblages that statisti- cally are almost insignificant. Area A presents a different architectural picture. The earliest building remains, contemporary with the construc- tion of the fortification wall (W. 241), are a massive wall (W. 66+W. 57+W. 69) running parallel to the fortification wall (Plans 13-14). Between the two walls runs an alley (L. 241 and L. 441), unchanged throughout the EB II and EB III. The curved wall to the south (W. 243, Photo 54) is attributed to the EB II on the basis of an associated floor, but it seems to correspond better with the EB IB architecture at Tel Qashish. One main building, with several architectural sub-phases, continued in use in Area A throughout the EB II- III sequence (Plans 15-22). The building differs in many respects from the domestic units characterizing Area B. The plan is of a large rectangular room, which was later divided into two rooms and then reunified into one large unit. There is a large space attached to the west of this room, probably an open courtyard. The walls of the building are thicker than those in Area B, between 70 and 100 cm wide, and are built of larger stones. The area of the room alone is 32 m2. The courtyard may be almost 50 m2. Several installations were found inside the building and in the courtyard, suggesting that diverse activities took place throughout their use (Photos 46-47, 49-50, 52). In Stratum XIID, the finds from the room included three basalt objects (Fig. 50:8, 16-17) that may be spinning whorls (Shamir 1 996: 1 49-1 5 1 ). This might explain the interior arrangement of the room in this phase, with its narrow dividing wall, pavement, and attached installation (Plans 15-16), as a weaving or spinning workshop. Attrib- uting a function to the different units based on the pottery repertoire is again difficult. One hint is the predominance of open vessels, mainly bowls and platters, in the large court- yard in Stratum XIIA (L. 345 and L. 346). The interpretation of this area as an open courtyard is strengthened by the presence of various installations (Plan 21). To sum up, it seems that there is some kind of architectural hierarchy between Areas A and B at Tel Qashish. In both areas, the remains are undoubtedly those of domestic build- ings. No public structures other than the fortification wall and the "water reservoir" were found. Larger dimensions and better building techniques are characteristic of the Area A remains, possibly the result of a difference in social stratifi- cation. Area A, the "acropolis" of the tel, might have served as the living quarters of the well-to-do, the Tel Qashish elite, and Area B, on the outskirts of the settlement, as the lower- class neighborhood. A similar explanation is suggested by 128</page><page sequence="169">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III ARCHITECTURE Marfoe for the differences in house sizes and material remains among the areas at Arad (1980). This line of reasoning, although tempting, should be viewed with caution. The excavated parts of Tel Qashish are not large enough to establish such a social reconstruction. Moreover, the pottery repertoire of the two areas is very similar, and there are no special finds, except for the cylinder-seal impressions (see Chapter 10) and incised bone tube (see Chapter 1 2), that could serve as criteria for such a differentia- tion. Another possible explanation, more in line with the infor- mation gained from the pottery analysis, is chronological. The pottery assemblage from Area B seems to begin earlier than that from Area A. Stratum XIID in Area A, the first phase of the large building, seems to be contemporaneous with a phase somewhere between Strata XIIC and XIIB in Area B. If this is correct, then the building in Area A was constructed later than the first buildings in Area B. The differences in architecture might be the result of different needs of the period and not necessarily different inhabitants. Similar needs might be reflected in the fortifications: Stratum XIIB seems to constitute a period during which the need for a strong fortification system was limited, and domestic installations were built outside the fortification wall (Plan 7). If the Area A building was constructed around this time, its large dimensions might hint at a certain measure of prosperity and peace during this period. Both these explanations are suggested as possible reasons for the architectural differences between the two areas. Both, however, should be considered against the background of Tel Qashish within the larger picture of the Jezreel Valley and northern Canaan during the Early Bronze Age. As stated by Kramer, who conducted an ethnoarchaeological study in an Iranian village: "For an archaeologist... the problem would seem to be not so much in discovering that the village house- holds had not been identical, but in obtaining a representa- tive sample from which the ranges of variation could be established, and on which efforts to specify their causes could build. . . It might be advisable to evaluate the remains of such settlements in the light of a larger regional sample" (1982: 148). Unfortunately, no EB II or EB III village sites in close proximity to Tel Qashish have been excavated, and the lines of such a regional architectural development cannot as yet be defined. FOOTNOTES 1 For example, Taanach (30-45 dunams; Broshi 1984: Table 5), Megiddo (50-60 dunams; Broshi 1984: Table 5; Portugāli and Gophna 1993:169-170), Dothan (60 dunams; Broshi 1984: Table 6), 'Ai (110 dunams; Broshi 1984: Table 7), Yarmouth (150-160 dunams; Miroschedji 1988:23), Beth Yerah (200 dunams; Esse 1991:184), Kh. el-Makhruq (250 dunams; Broshi 1984: Table 4). 129</page><page sequence="170">CHAPTER 8 THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III POTTERY Sharon Zuckerman Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem TYPOLOGY Strata attributed to the EB II-III were excavated in both Areas A and B. This necessitated a finely tuned typology, for two reasons. Firstly, it was necessary in order to establish a correlation between the different phases of Stratum XII defined in the two areas; the fact that three phases were distinguished in Area B and five in Area A makes this corre- lation both more difficult and more important. The second reason was to create a basis for a chronological differentia- tion within the Stratum XII sequence between the phases attributed to the EB II and those dated to the EB III. This differentiation is hampered by the total absence of Khirbet Kerak Ware (KKW) in the Tel Qashish pottery repertoire. The fact that the hallmark of the EB III is absent requires the use of "local" traditional pottery types as the basis for distin- guishing between the two periods. The typological principles are similar to those applied to the EB I pottery. The fact that most of the pottery repertoire consists of sherds, mainly rims and decorated body sherds, should be taken into consideration. The reconstruction of the vessel shapes was usually based on parallels from other sites. Many of the types, notably bowls, platters, and juglets, are wheel-made. Holemouth jars and storage jars are usually hand-made. The EB II-III wares are generally different from those of EB I vessels, with the exception of holemouth jars. Metallic ware is quite common, especially in the earlier phases of Stratum XII in both areas. Red-slipped sherds are also common, usually with no signs of burnishing. The types are described below with reference to the typology plates (Figs. 62-69). The shape and ware are speci- fied where possible. The occurrence of each type in the EB II-III sequence is given in general outline. The specific details and parallels of each type are presented in the discus- sion of the assemblages. BOWLS (B) Figs. 62-63 Type B I: Shallow bowls (Fig. 62:1-2). These bowls are relatively small and shallow, and in most cases are made of metallic ware and irregularly burnished inside and out. Similar bowls are characteristic of the early assemblage at Tel Dan, attributed to the EB II, but continue to appear in the EB III (Greenberg 1996a: 100, 103). At Tel Qashish, they appear in all phases of Stratum XII in Area B and in phases XIIE-XIID in Area A. Red-slipped examples were found in Stratum XIIA in Area B and in Stratum XI in Area A. Type B II: Straight-sided bowls (Fig. 62:3). These bowls are reminiscent of the type known in the EB I repertoire. The ware is coarse, sometimes red-slipped, but never metallic or burnished. They appear in Stratum XI in both areas. Type B III: Hemispherical bowls (Fig. 62:4, Photo 66). This type has a rounded base and walls and a simple rim. The bowls are often red-slipped but never metallic. The type is characteristic of the late assemblage at Tel Dan, replacing the shallow metallic bowls (Greenberg 1 996a: 1 03). At Tel Qashish, it appears in phases XIIB-XIIA in Area B and is found throughout the Stratum XII sequence in Area A. Type B IV: Bowls with tapering rim (Fig. 62:5-6). The type has two variants : the first is larger but with a thinner wall (Fig. 62:6), and the second has a small flat base and is made of coarser material (Fig. 62:5). Both variants are usually unslipped. Bowls of this type were found only in Area A, in phases XIIC and XIIA. Type B V: Bowls with ledge rim (Fig. 62:7-8). Bowls with a ledge rim appear in two sub-types: Type B Va (Fig. 62:7). Bowls with an inverted triangular rim. The diameter of these bowls is relatively large, and the only complete example has a flat base. Most of the sherds are red-slipped. This variant appears in phases XIIC and XIIA in Area B and in phases XIIC-XIIA in Area A. Type B Vb (Fig. 62:8). Bowls with an inverted rim, thin walls, and a rounded base. This variant is represented by both red-slipped and metallic examples. Bowls of this type were found in phases XIIC and XIIA and Stratum XI in Area B and in phases XIID-XIIB in Area A. Type B VI: Bowls with rounded carination (Fig. 62:9). Bowls of this type have a simple rim and a rounded profile. The carination is in the middle of the body. In some cases, the bowls are red-slipped. One red-slipped example appears in phase XIIA in Area B, while the type appears in all the Stratum XII phases in Area A. Type B VII: Carinated bowls (Fig. 62: 10- 1 3). These are small, rather shallow bowls, carinated in the middle of the body. The following variants differ mainly in the inversion of the wall and the characteristic ware. Type B Vila (Fig. 62: 10), with an erect wall. 130</page><page sequence="171">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III POTTERY Type B Vllb (Fig. 62: 1 1), with an out-turned rim. Type B Vile (Fig. 62: 12), with an in-turned rim. lýpe B Vild (Fig. 62: 13), with a sharp carination and out- turned rim. This type is considered a hallmark of the EB II (P. Beck 1985a). While its distribution reaches the Jezreel Valley, it is absent at Tel Dan (Greenberg 1996a: 101). Carinated bowls appear in phase XIIA in Area B and in phases XIID-XIIC in Area A. Types B Vile and B Vild are usually made of metallic ware and burnished. Type B VIII: Platter-like bowls (Fig. 63: 1-3). The shape of these bowls is similar to that of platters, but their diameter is smaller, usually less than 25 cm. Type B Villa (Fig. 63:1) has a triangular inverted rim. This variant appears in phase XIIA in Area B, and throughout the Stratum XII sequence in Area A. Type B VHIb has a long inverted rim. Like platters (below), it is represented by two variants: Type B VHIbl (Fig. 63:2), with a simple rim. Type B VIIIb2 (Fig. 63:3), with a thickened rim. Both Types B Villa and B Vlllb are found in red-slipped plain ware (mostly Type B Villa) and in metallic ware (mostly Type B Vlllb). At Tel Dan, the type is especially characteristic of the early assemblage (Greenberg 1996a: 101). The first appearance of Type BVIIIb in Area B at Tel Qashish is in phase XIIC, but it is more common in phase XIIA. In Area A, it appears throughout the Stratum XII sequence. Type B IX: Incised-indented bowls (Fig. 63:4-5). Two variants of incised-indented bowls are attributed to this type: the first (Fig. 63:4), which is less common, has thin erect walls and is usually metallic. Similar bowls were found at Tel Dan (Greenberg 1996a: Fig. 3.28:13). Greenberg suggests that they were used as graters (Ibid.: 101). The second variant is best represented by one complete example (Fig. 63:5, Photos 53-54) that has a flat base, almost straight walls and an inverted rim. Most of the sherds attrib- uted to this type are red-slipped on the outside and the rim. None are made of metallic ware. The variant is represented in Area B in phases XIIC and XIIA. In Area A it is represented only in phase XIIC. « Type B X: Varia (Fig. 63:6-8). PLATTERS (PL) Fig. 64 Platters are wide, shallow vessels, with a diameter usually exceeding 25 cm. They are made either of metallic ware or of red-slipped buff ware. Only in rare cases are metallic-ware platters also red-slipped. As far as can be determined from the sherds, they are wheel-made or at least wheel- finished. The following definition of types is based on rim variations. Type PL I: Short rim (Fig. 64:1-5). Four sub-types were distinguished: Type PL la (Fig. 64:1). Platters with a short triangular rim. This variant usually is made of orange-colored metallic ware, although non-metallic red-slipped examples are also known. It is represented throughout the Stratum XII sequence in both areas. Type PL lb (Fig. 64:2). Platters with a triangular rim and a hand-made recess below it. The variant appears throughout the Stratum XII sequence in Area B, in metallic or red- slipped ware. In Area A, its appearance is limited to phases XIIC-XILA, and most platters are red-slipped. At Tel Dan, metallic-ware platters of this type already appear in the early assemblage (Greenberg 1996a: 101, Fig. 3.24:6). Type PL Ic (Fig. 64:3). Platters with a rounded rim. In Area B, this variant appears only in phase XIIA, and is repre- sented by metallic-ware sherds. In Area A, it appears throughout the Stratum XII sequence, and in phase XIIA it is usually red-slipped. Type PL Id (Fig. 64:4-5). Platters with a rounded rim and a groove below it. This type is typical of the late assemblage at Tel Dan (Greenberg 1996a:103, Figs. 3.33:8, 3.35:2). In Area B at Tel Qashish, the type is mainly characteristic of phase XIIA, although one metallic example was found in phase XIIC. In Area A, it is represented throughout the Stratum XII sequence. All the variants are found in metallic ware (mainly the first two) or in red-slipped buff ware (more characteristic of the last two). All the metallic-ware and most of the red-slipped platters are burnished on the inside and on the rims, and some also on the outside. Type PL II: Elongated rim (Fig. 64:6-7). The two sub- types are: Type PL IIa (Fig. 64:6). Platters with a simple elongated rim. In Area B, this variant is represented throughout the Stratum XII sequence, almost solely by metallic examples. In Area A, it is typical mainly of phases XIID-XIIC (metallic sherds) and XIIA (red-slipped sherds). At Tel Dan, the type is attributed mainly to the early assemblage (Greenberg 1996a: 101). Type PL lib (Fig. 64:7). Platters with a thickened elon- gated rim. In Area B, this variant, in metallic ware, appears throughout the Stratum XII sequence. In Area A, it appears mainly in phase XIID, with only a few examples found in the subsequent phases. Almost all the platters belonging to this type are metallic and burnished, and only a few are red- slipped. Type PL III: Ledge rim (Fig. 64:8-10). Ledge-rim platters appear in three sub-types: Type PL Ilia (Fig. 64:8). Platters with an in-turned ledge rim. In Area B, this variant is found throughout the Stratum XII sequence, almost solely in metallic ware. In Area A, two metallic sherds were found in phase XIID and one red- slipped sherd in phase XIIA. Type PL Illb (Fig. 64:9). Ledge-rim platters with a groove below the rim. In Area B, this type was found in phases XIIB-XIIA, and in Area A, in phases XIIB-XIIA. Both metallic and red-slipped examples appear. Type PLIIIc (Fig. 64: 10). Platters with a ledge rim, thick- ened both outwards and inwards. In Area B, one example comes from phase XIIB, while in Area A, two red-slipped sherds were found in phase XIIA. 131</page><page sequence="172">CHAPTER 8 Type PL IV: Thickened rim (Fig. 64:11). The rim of this type is thickened inwards and outwards to form a wedge shape. The type is usually red-slipped and never metallic. It was not represented in Area B, but two red-slipped examples were found in phase XIIA in Area A. Type PL V: Varia (Fig. 64:12-14). KRATERS (K) Fig. 65 Type K I: In-turned ledge rim (Fig. 65: 1). The ware of this type of krater resembles that of the platters, although the kraters are deeper and usually have a smaller diameter. They occur in metallic or red-slipped buff ware. The type was found throughout the Stratum XII sequence in both areas. In the Tel Dan assemblage, these vessels, designated "basins" or "vats," appear mainly in metallic combed ware in both phases (Greenberg 1996a: 101-104). Type K II: Flattened rim (Fig. 65:2). This type has almost straight walls and the rims are flattened or slightly squared. All of these kraters are red-slipped, and none are metallic. No examples of the type were found in Area B. Red-slipped examples are represented in all the Stratum XII phases in Area A, except phase XIIB. Type K III: Varia (Fig. 65:3). HOLEMOUTH JARS (H) Fig. 66 The attribution of a given type of holemouth jar to either the EB I or the EB II- III repertoire is difficult. Although the ware of some of the later holemouth jars is darker and finer, the buff coarse ware of the earlier examples continues to appear. Most types of holemouth jar are represented throughout the Stratum XII sequence in both areas, and their contribution in determining chronology appears to be limited (see also Nodet 1988), with the possible exception of type H IV. Only one holemouth jar is made of metallic ware, and very few are red-slipped. « Type H I: Simple rim (Fig. 66:1). Type H II: Rectangular rim (Fig. 66:2). Type H III: Thickened rim (Fig. 66:3). Type H IV: Sharpened rim (Fig. 66:4, Photos 63-64).This type is characteristic of Area B, where it appears throughout the Stratum XII sequence. A special example with a spout (Fig. 56:6) is attributed to Stratum XIIA in Area A. Type H V: Varia (Fig. 66:5). JUGLETS (JT) Fig. 67:1-9 All the juglets found in the EB II- III strata, most of them represented only by sherds, belong to the same type (Fig. 67: 1-9, Photos 58, 65, 67). The base is usually flat and the body globular or elongated. The handles are attached from the rim to the shoulder. Almost half of the juglets are made of metallic ware, horizontally burnished on the outside. A few red-slipped sherds were also counted, all from Area A. There were no stump bases, but a few "semi- stump" bases (e.g., Fig. 67:9) were found in the later strata. JUGS (J) Fig. 67:10-12 Most of the jugs have a simple rim, turned slightly outwards. In most cases, the handle is attached to the rim. The bases are flat and wide. The jugs are usually made of metallic ware. Some red-slipped body sherds were found in Area A. Only one example of a jug with a stump base was found in a disturbed locus (Fig. 67:12). STORAGE JARS (SJ) Fig. 68 Storage jars are the most common vessel in the Tel Qashish EB II- III repertoire, outnumbering holemouth jars and platters. The two main types described below are known at other northern sites of the period (Greenberg 1996a: 102-105). Type SJ I: Squat wide-necked storage jars (Fig. 68:1-4, Photos 55-57, 68). These jars are usually squat, with a bag- shaped body and a flat base. They lack a defined neck and the rim is simple. The two variants are similar in shape but differ in their characteristic ware: Type SJ la (Fig. 68: 1-2). The main characteristic of this variant is its coarse ware, a dark brown clay with large quartz and mica grits. The use of this ware hints at the possible function of these jars as cooking utensils (Greenberg 1996a: 102). They probably replace the holemouth jars used for this purpose in the EB I. Most of the examples are unslipped. The type appears throughout the Stratum XII sequence in both areas. Only one sherd is red-slipped and two are metallic. Type SJ lb (Fig. 68:3-4). The shape is probably similar to that of the first variant but it is made of finer, levigated clay with no additions, and is commonly red-slipped. As no complete jars were found, its body-shape is difficult to reconstruct. It is represented throughout the Stratum XII sequence in both areas, although in much smaller numbers than the first variant. Type SJ Ibi (Fig. 68:3) has a simple out-turned rim. Type S J Ib2 (Fig. 68:4) has a thickened rim. Type SJ II: Elongated jars with folded rim (Fig. 68:5-8). These jars have a relatively long neck and an out-turned folded rim. The complete examples found at Tel Qashish have a narrow body and a flat base. Most of the jars belonging to this type are made of metallic ware, frequently pattern-combed and seldom red-slipped. The type has three variants: 132</page><page sequence="173">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III POTTERY Type SJ IIa (Fig. 68:5), with a rounded-elliptical rim. This is the most common variant in both areas throughout the Stratum XII sequence. Type SJ lib (Fig. 68:6-7, Photo 62), with an out-turned triangular rim. This variant includes both jars (Fig. 68:6) and pithoi (Fig. 68:7). Examples appear in both areas, albeit in greater numbers in Area B. Most are made of metallic ware. T^pe SJ lie (Fig. 68:8), with a sharply out-turned gutter rim. This variant is not very common. It appears in Area B for the first time in phase XIIA, and is represented in phases XIID, XIIC and XIIA in Area A. Type SJ III: Varia (Fig. 68:9-10). This category includes body sherds of combed metallic jars. Most bear plastic rope decoration (Fig. 68:9) or incisions (Fig. 68: 10) on the base of the neck. The rope decorations characterize jars and pithoi of Type SJ Ilb-c (Fig. 68:6-8). Metallic-ware sherds bearing rope decoration were found in Area B in phase XIIA, while in Area A, they are represented in phases XIID, XIIC and XIIA. LEDGE HANDLES Fig. 69:1-8 In contrast to the EB I, the number of ledge handles found in EB II and EB III contexts at Tel Qashish is small (Fig. 69:1-8). The most common type is the pushed- up handle (Fig. 69:1-3). The bulbous handles, which are often incised or punctured, are noteworthy (Fig. 69:5-7). The distinction between EB I and EB II-III ledge handles is clear, as most of the latter are made of reddish unslipped material, as opposed to the lighter material, often red- slipped, characterizing the EB I examples. Many of the EB II-III ledge handles, especially the bulbous variant, are decorated with incisions or punctures, a feature unknown in EB I. At Tel Dan, ledge handles appear in the late assemblage, together with an increasing number of holemouth jars (Greenberg 1996a: 104). This development is not paralleled in the Tel Qashish assemblage. INCISED DECORATIONS AND "POTTER'S MARKS" Fig. 69:9-20 Many body sherds and rims of holemouth jars and of metallic-ware storage jars bear incisions, usually made before firing. The most common incisions are compositions of straight vertical and horizontal lines. Some can be viewed as schematic representations of animal figures (Fig. 69:15), while others may represent the quantity of goods the vessel contained (Fig. 69:10). These signs could represent a system of symbols connected to a trade network in the area, within which they could have fulfilled the need for inter-regional communica- tion (Greenberg 1987:156; N. Lapp 1995:565-567). The main problem in assessing this interpretation is the absence of a complete corpus of such "potter's marks" from Early Bronze Age sites. Most of the published examples come from disturbed contexts (Engberg and Shipton 1934a: 16). A comparison of incisions found at neighboring sites, such as Tel Qashish and Megiddo, shows no similarity between the two assemblages. At Megiddo, the marks attributed to Stages IV-II (Ibid.: Table 15) are composed of curvilinear lines, dots and arrows, while at Tel Qashish, they are composed of straight lines and angles. On the other hand, the marks found at Tel Yarmouth, especially those incised on holemouth jars, reveal close similarities both in form and location to those from Tel Qashish (Miroschedji 1988: Pis. 26:9,31:11,39:9-10). The reconstruction of the chronological and regional borders of this phenomenon is quite difficult. In order to achieve such a definition, more incisions from stratified sites in the region should be analyzed and compared. This should be considered together with other evidence of contact between the sites under discussion, such as the presence/absence of specific pottery types and other objects. The nature and function of the incised vessels (open bowls or closed storage jars), the location of the sign on the vessel body, and the technique of incision, whether before or after firing, should also be taken into consideration. Other aspects of this possible regional network, such as ceramic families, cylinder-seal impressions, and other objects, should be studied in order to determine its existence and extent. THE ASSEMBLAGES OF AREA B The division of the EB II-III architectural remains in Area B into three phases is described in detail in Chapter 6. The main feature characterizing these phases is the existence of the fortification wall (W. 305). The wall was built above the EB I walls and its construction fills were dug up from the lower strata. The three phases represent the three stages of the building activities in this area (see Chapter 7). Stratum XIIC (Plans 5-6): The earliest phase includes the construction of the fortification wall and its retaining wall and fills. This first stage of construction is poorly repre- sented within the settlement by meager remains of walls and floors, one of which, L. 516, seals an EB I fill (Fig. 25). Stratum XIIB (Plans 7-8): The next phase shows the plan of the site at its peak. The fortification wall is still in use, with some minor changes such as the narrowing of the drainage channel and the addition of perpendicular walls on its outside. Some of the features from the previous phase continue in use, notably the alley along the wall, as well as a number of walls. This phase represents a rather long time- span, as indicated by several changes and floor repairs discerned within the buildings (e.g., L. 603 and L. 609). Stratum XIIA (Plans 9-10): This phase is defined as the last stage of the fortification wall. The plan and the orienta- tion of the buildings remain the same, with few changes. 133</page><page sequence="174">CHAPTER 8 Stratum XI (Plans 1 1-12): The remains of this stratum lie immediately beneath the surface and are of an entirely different nature from the previous strata. The fortification wall goes out of use, the walls are thinner, and the plan of the buildings is completely new. No undisturbed floors attribut- able to this stratum were discerned and its pottery assem- blage is scanty, making it difficult to date. In the following discussion, the Strata XII-XI assemblage from Area B is presented before that of Area A, since a larger area was exposed and preserved in Area B. An attempt is made to correlate the findings from Areas A and B. The raw data on the Area B EB II- III pottery are presented in the sherd-count tables (Tables 6-11). STRATUM XIIC (Figs. 24-28) The loci discussed below come from the alley running along the fortification wall, only the northern part of which was paved (L. 523B). A special feature is the "water reservoir." The connection of this isolated element with the other Stratum XIIC walls is unclear. Bowls The bowls of this phase represent a limited range of types: Type B I. Two metallic bowls of this type were found in fills. The type, in most cases irregularly burnished, is found mainly in EB II contexts, e.g., Me'ona Stratum I, Tel Dan Stratum 5, Beth Yerah, the Kinneret tomb, and Tel Teo. It continues to appear in later, EB III contexts, such as Tel Dan Stratum 7. Type B Va. Two bowls of this type, one red-slipped inside and out (Fig. 27:3) and the other smaller and slipped only on the rim (Fig. 28:1), were attributed to this stratum. Similar bowls were found in EB II contexts at Tel Kinnerot and Yarmouth Bronze Ancien II, and in EB III contexts at Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA. Type B VHIbl. Platter-like bowls appear only in this sub- variant, with a long simple rim. One is made of metallic ware and none are red-slipped. Type B IX. This special type is common in this stratum (Fig. 24:4-6; Photos 53-54). Only one other example was found in Stratum XILA (Fig. 37:2). These deep bowls have straight walls and a flat wide base. The interior surface of the vessel, including the base and the walls, was indented with a sharp tool. The rim of the complete example from L. 126 is inverted. In some cases ledge or knob handles were attached to the body. All the bowls are red-slipped on the outside and inside the rim and never made of metallic ware. At 'Afula, similar bowls were attributed to the Neolithic period (Sukenik 1948: PI. 1:8), but their reassignment to the Early Bronze assemblage should be considered. A sherd of this type of bowl was published from Kh. Seifan in the western Jezreel Valley (Raban 1982:58). Bowls with indented inte- riors were found at Tel Dan (Greenberg 1987: Figs. 18:15, 20:8; 1996a: 101) and at Shamir (Greenberg 1987: Fig. 44:12), but these differ from the Tel Qashish type in almost every other respect: the rim is sharply inverted, the walls are thin and sloping towards the base, the ware is metallic and unslipped, and the indentations are smaller. They were found mostly in the upper phases at Tel Dan, i.e., the very end of the EB II or beginning of the EB III. A similar bowl was found in Area A at Tel Qashish in the fill of the Early Bronze Age street (Fig. 52:5). Platters Type PL la. This is the most common type of platter in Stratum XIIC (Fig. 27: 13-14). In most cases, platters of this type are made of metallic ware, and only rarely red-slipped. Parallels come mainly from EB II contexts at Me'ona Stratum I, Beth Yerah, the Kinneret tomb, Yarmouth Bronze Ancien II, and 'Ai Phase III. Red-slipped platters of this type appear in slightly later contexts (see Stratum XIIB below). Type PL lb. A few platters of this type, one of which is metallic (Fig. 27:2), were found in this stratum. Parallels have been attributed to EB II contexts at Tel Dan, Tel Kinnerot, and 'Ai Phase III, and to EB III contexts at Hazor Area L, as well as to transitional contexts at Shamir and Rosh ha-Niqra Stratum I. Only in the later contexts are these platters red-slipped. Type PL Id. One example was found in this stratum, made of metallic ware and burnished. Type PL Ha. The type is very common in this phase and throughout the Stratum XII sequence. The platters are in most cases metallic and burnished (Figs. 24: 1 ; 26: 1-2), and only rarely red-slipped. They appear almost exclusively in EB II contexts, at Me'ona Stratum I, Tel Dan Phase 5, Tel Kinnerot, the Kinneret tomb, Beth Yerah, Tell el-Far'ah (North) Bronze Ancien I, and 'Ai Phase III. Type PL lib. Similar to the preceding type is the metallic platter with the elongated, thickened and slightly more inverted rim (Figs. 24:2; 26:3, 5; 27:12, 15). Parallels for this type were found in EB II contexts at Tel Dan Phase 5, Beth Yerah, and 'Ai Phase IV, but some also appear in later contexts at Rosh ha-Niqra Stratum I and Beth-Shean Stratum XIII. Type PL Ilia. Platters with a shelf rim appear in this stratum in metallic and plain ware (Fig. 27:16-17). No red- slipped examples are found in Stratum XIIC, a feature common in Strata XILA and XI. Holemouth Jars The two most common types in this stratum are the sharp- ened rim (Type H III) (Fig. 24:7-8) and the thickened rim (Type H IV) (Fig. 24:9), and other types (H I and H II) make their first appearance. Juglets and Jugs Very few indicative and identifiable sherds of jugets and jugs were found. Sherds that could be attributed to such vessels are simple rims (Fig. 28:3) and flat bases. Most of the sherds from this as well as the other phases are of metallic ware and none are red-slipped. Storage Jars Two types of jars are common in this phase: Type S J la. Coarse "cooking-pot" jars are common, with a flat base reconstructed on the basis of the whole vessel attributed to Stratum XIIB (Fig. 28:5; Photo 55). None of 134</page><page sequence="175">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III POTTERY these vessels are red-slipped (Figs. 24:10-12; 25:1-2; 26:4). One is finely combed (Fig. 25:2), a phenomenon similar to that of the pattern combing of cooking pots observed in the early assemblage at Tel Dan (Greenberg 1996a: 102, Fig. 3.23:8). Parallels for this type can be found at almost every site attributed to the Early Bronze II or III. In southern Palestine, for example at Arad Stratum IV and 'Ai Phase I, the type seems to appear earlier, in the EB IB. Type SJ Ibi (Fig. 27:5-6). This is not as common as the previous variant. Type SJ II. This type is very common Stratum XIIC, constituting more than 50% of the total number of storage jars. Most are made of metallic ware, and only two sherds are red-slipped. Pattern-combed decoration is fairly common (Fig. 24:13). T^pe SJ Ha (Figs. 26:6; 27:7-8). Parallels for this type are found in EB II contexts, such as at Tel Kinnerot, but are more typical of EB III contexts, e.g., at 'Afilla, Beth Yerah, Hazor Area L, Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IILA, 'Ai Phase VII, and Lachish Cave 6013. Type SJ lib (Figs. 25:3; 26:7; 27:18). Jars of this type are usually metallic, and appear together with pithoi with a similar triangular rim (Fig. 27:9). Parallels were found in EB II contexts at Me'ona Stratum I, Tel Dan Stratum 5, and Tel Kinnerot, as well as in EB III contexts at Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA. The pithoi have parallels at Tel Kinnerot in an EB II context, and at Shamir and Rosh ha- Niqra Stratum I in the transition to the EB III. STRATUM XIIB (Figs. 29-36) The loci attributed to this stratum represent the main occupa- tion phase of Tel Qashish (Plan 7). Most are floors identified within buildings (L. 603 and L. 609 in Square AG/14, L. 608 and the fill above it, L. 614, in Square AH/15, and L. 279 in Squares AF-AG/1 5-16). Others represent the alley (L. 523 A in Square AG/13) and the area outside the fortification wall (L. 567 and L. 569 in Squares AI/14-15). Few architectural changes were discerned in this phase, mainly the raising of floors and addition of walls. In order to reflect these subtle changes, the pottery from this phase was divided into three categories: floors, fills, and the construction layers of the floors, i.e., "make-up" layers (se'e sherd-count Tables 6-11). Bowls Most of the types attributed to this phase already appeared in Stratum XIIC. The absence in Stratum XIIB of two types (B Va-b and B IX) present in Stratum XIIC seems to be only coincidental, since they reappear in Stratum XIIA. Type B I. Small shallow bowls continue to appear in this phase, although not all are made of metallic ware (Fig. 32: 1). This phenomenon is also evident at Tel Dan, especially in the early assemblage (Greenberg 1996a: 101). Type B Vlllb. Small platter-bowls are represented in this phase by one example (Fig. 33:2). The appearance of this type reaches its peak in the following phase. Two types of bowls make their first appearance in Stratum XIIB: Type B III (Figs. 33:1 [Photo 59]; 35:1-2). The earliest parallels for these bowls come from EB II contexts, mainly at southern sites, such as Tell el-Far' ah (North) Bronze Ancien I- II and 'Ai Phase IV. They are, however, more common in EB III contexts, e.g., at Megiddo Strata XVII-XVI, Beth Yerah, Tel Dan Phases 7-8, Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA, and Lachish Cave 1516. Type B VII. This is the first appearance of the carinated metallic bowl, a type common in the following phase (Fig. 29: 1). The irregular burnish, a feature characteristic of this family (Beck 1985a: 19) appears at Tel Qashish only on one unstratified bowl (Fig. 62:13). These bowls are often referred to as a hallmark of the EB II (Esse 1982:120; Beck 1985a). Similar bowls appear in EB II contexts at Beth Yerah, the Kinneret tomb, and Yarmouth Bronze Ancien II. The distribution of this type is limited to the coastal plain and northern Palestine, but they were not found at Tel Dan (Greenberg 1996a: 101). The carinated bowls from southern sites, e.g., Lachish, 'Ai Phases III-IV, and even Tell el-Far'ah (North), are made of non-metallic ware and often red- slipped. Platters Most types of platters, like the bowls, continue to appear in Stratum XIIB. The metallic nature of the platter repertoire is obvious (Table 7). Only one example of Type PL la is red- slipped, and only a few sherds are of non-metallic ware. The most common types of platters are those with a trian- gular rim of Type PL I (Fig. 29:2) and with an elongated rim of Type PL II (Figs. 33:3; 35:3; 36:1). A new type that appears in this phase is the platter with a ledge rim of Type PL III, with very thin walls and a net-burnish on the inside (Fig. 36:2). Parallels for this type were found in the EB II at Beth Yerah and in the EB III at Tel Dan Stratum 7 and Megiddo Stratum XVI. Kraters One metallic krater with a ledge rim (Fig. 31:2), which might represent a forerunner of the shelf-rim kraters of the later phases, and one krater with straight walls and a thickened rim (Fig. 36:3), paralleled in an EB II context at Beth Yerah, were found in Stratum XIIB. Holemouth Jars The types found in Stratum XIIC continue to appear. Rectan- gular-rim jars of Type H II become more abundant. Juglets and Jugs A few sherds belonging to small closed vessels, most of them metallic, were found in this phase. The juglets have a flat base and globular body, and are vertically burnished (Fig. 33:7; Photo 58). Parallels for this type were found in EB II contexts at Arad Stratum I. No red-slipped body sherds were found in this phase, except for a narrow neck with the handle attached in the middle (Fig. 35:5). Parallels for this feature come from EB III contexts at Megiddo Stratum XVIII and Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA. The jugs have an elongated neck with a simple rim and an attached handle (Fig. 30:4). The closest parallels were found in the early assemblage of Tel Dan Phase 7a and the Kinneret tomb. The type should be attributed to the EB II. 135</page><page sequence="176">CHAPTER 8 Storage Jars The main types continue to appear in the same relative frequencies. Type SJ la (Figs. 29:4-5; 31:3-5; 33:5; 34:4-5; 36:5-6). The one complete jar with a flat base and a bag-shaped body (Photo 56) is paralleled at Megiddo Stratum XV. A special variant is a jar with a very wide mouth and an erect neck, bearing an incised decoration on the shoulder (Fig. 29:6; Photo 57). Type SJ Ibi (Figs. 3 1 :6-9; 36:7). This variant appears in the same relative proportions within the storage jars reper- toire, with some red-slipped examples. The type is paralleled in EB II contexts at Beth Yerah. Type SJ Ib2. A special type of jar, with a thickened "rail rim" and red slip on the exterior, was found in this phase (Fig. 35:9). Parallels were found in EB III contexts at Beth Yerah. The appearance of this type is limited to the two earlier Stratum XII phases in Area B. Type S J II. The metallic out-turned rim jars, so common in the previous phase, are represented in Stratum XIIB by one triangular rim (Fig. 30:5), two rounded rims (Fig. 34:8), and a flat, combed metallic base (Fig. 32:5). The type again appears in significant quantities in Stratum XIIA. An impor- tant vessel, attributed to this type only because of its rim shape, was found outside one of the rooms in this phase (Fig. 35:7). It is a small jar made of fine well-levigated clay, with an out-turned rounded rim. Its special feature is the decoration, consisting of white painted triangles and dots on a burnished red slip. The motifs are identical to those discussed by Amiran as belonging to the "painted style" family (1974), and defined by Kantor as "light faced painted ware" (1965:14-17). Amiran concludes that the "white-on- red" vessels are derivatives of the EB II painted style and should be attributed to EB III contexts. Only two of her examples, however, seem to belong to this family (1974: Pl. XXVI: 1-2), and the others are more probably later types, like the Tell el-Yahudiyeh ware (Ibid. : PI. XXVI:3). No prov- enance is given in Amiran's text for the two "white-on-red" vessels mentioned above. Parallels for this type are found mainly in EB II contexts, at Tel Dan, Tel Kinnerot, Tel Teo (Greenberg 1996a:135), and Yarmouth Bronze Ancien II. At 'Afilla, it was found in Pit E, which contained large amounts of KKW. At Yoqne'am, a sherd was found in a fill together with KKW. At Zeiraqoun, it is attributed to the EB III (Genz 1 993 : 1 2). Thus, the suggestion made by Amiran concerning the later, EB III date of this variant seems to be too limited, and the first appearance of this type of decoration should be dated to the EB II (Miroschedji 1988:71; Greenberg 1996a: 136). STRATUM XIIA (Figs. 37-44) This phase reflects the latest of the architectural elements contemporaneous with the fortification wall. Stratum XIIA is the richest in pottery. Bowls A general feature of the bowls from this phase is the increasing number of red-slipped vessels replacing the metallic ware, although some of the types remain mainly metallic. Type B I. One example of a red-slipped bowl. No metallic-ware bowls of this type, known in the previous phases, were found. Type B III. Hemispherical red-slipped bowls continue to appear (Fig. 37:1). Type B V. Bowls with a ledge rim appear either in metallic ware or with a red slip. The complete red-slipped example from L. 139 (Fig. 40:2) has parallels in EB II contexts at Tell el-Far' ah (North) Bronze Aiicien I and in EB III contexts at Megiddo Stratum XVIII and Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA. The small burnished bowl with a pierced lug handle (Fig. 40: 1) is paralleled in EB II contexts at Beth Yerah, Tel Dalit, Yarmouth, and 'Ai Phase V. Type B VII. Almost all the variants of carinated bowls appear in this phase. The bowl with an out-turned rim (Fig. 37:3) is metallic and burnished, similar to Type B Vlld discussed above under Stratum XIIB. An atypical bowl belonging to this family (Fig. 44:1) is paralleled in EB II contexts at Aphek and Yarmouth Bronze Ancien II. Type B Vile. Bowls with an in-turned rim (Fig. 37:4-5) are characteristic of EB II contexts, for example, in the Kinneret tomb, but continue into a later context at Tel Dan Phase 8. Type B Villa. The first appearance of platter-bowls with a triangular rim (Fig. 42:1, 9) is in this phase. All the bowls are red-slipped, and, in contrast to Type B VHIb, none are metallic. This phenomenon might be connected to the appearance of more red-slipped platters of Type PL la (see below). The type appears in EB II contexts at Tel Dan, Arad Stratum II, and probably 'Ai Phase V, but at most northern sites, it is attributed to EB III contexts, e.g., at Megiddo Stratum XV and Beth Yerah, and also at Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA. Type B Vlllb. The variant with a simple elongated rim continues to appear (Fig. 37:6), mostly in metallic ware. The type is accompanied, for the first time, by the variant with a thickened rim (Fig. 39:1 is a somewhat unrepresentative example). Type B IX. One example of a red-slipped bowl of this type appears in Stratum XIIA (Fig. 37:2). Platters Type PL la. This continues to be the most common type of platter, mainly in metallic ware (Figs. 37:7; 40:4-5), but the relative number of red-slipped examples increases in this phase (Fig. 38:2). The metallic platters are paralleled mainly in EB II contexts, while the red-slipped variant appears in transitional EB II/EB III contexts, such as at Tel Dan, and in EB III contexts at 'Ai Phase V and Yarmouth Bronze Ancien HIB. Type PL lb. This type continues to appear in the same relative quantities. One red-slipped example was observed (Fig. 44:2), but most are metallic. The variant appears in EB II contexts in the early phases at Tel Dan, at Tel Kinnerot, and at Yarmouth Bronze Ancien II, and continues into EB III contexts at Beth Yerah. Type PL Ic. The first appearance of this type is in Stratum XIIA (Fig. 44:3). Most of the platters are metallic, although red-slipped examples also appear. Parallels were found in EB II contexts at Tel Kinnerot and 'Ai Phase II, as well as in 136</page><page sequence="177">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III POTTERY EB III contexts at Megiddo (where it is erroneously attrib- uted to Stratum XIX) and Beth Yerah. Type PL Ila-b (Fig. 40:6-7). These platters, most of which are metallic, are found in the same relative quantities throughout the Stratum XII phases. One example is red- slipped on the inside (Fig. 39:4). Type PL Ilia. Platters with a ledge rim continue to appear in this stratum, mostly of metallic ware, but some red-slipped vessels were also found. One example is net-burnished on the inside (Fig. 39:5). At Beth Yerah, a similar vessel was found in an EB II context, but net-burnished platters are typical mainly of later contexts, the end of the EB II or well into the EB III, at Megiddo Strata XVII-XVI, Tel Dan Phase 7, and Beth-Shean Stratum XII. Type PL V (Fig. 39:6). This type of platter deserves speciál attention. It is very shallow, with rounded walls and a simple rim, unslipped, and non-metallic. It seems to be an EB III type, with parallels at Megiddo Stratum XVIII and Stages IV-I, Beth Yerah, and Yarmouth Bronze Ancien HIB. At 'Ai, the same type, with a red slip, begins to appear in Phase VI. Kraters Kraters of Type K I with a ledge rim (Figs. 42:10; 43:18; 44:4) continue to appear. The type is paralleled mainly in contexts attributed to the end of the EB II, e.g., at Tel Dan Phase 6B. Holemouth Jars The same types of holemouth jars observed in Stratum XIIB continue to appear, with some minor changes. In contrast to the previous phase, no red-slipped vessels were found. The rectangular-rim holemouth jars of Type H II (Figs. 39:7; 40:3) tend to be smaller and finer than their predecessors. Parallels come mainly from EB III contexts, at Beth Yerah, Hazor Area L, Yarmouth Bronze Ancien HIB, and 'Ai Phase VII. At Tel Dan, they appear in Phases 6B-7, at the begin- ning of the EB III. Juglets and Jugs Most examples belong to the same types discussed above (Figs. 37:9; 38:4; 39:8; 42:3^4). One jug has an out-turned rim with an attached handle (Fig. 42:5). Most of the juglets and jugs are metallic, none are red-slipped, and some are pattern-burnished (Fig. 38:4). A new feature is the appear- ance of narrow, almost semi-stump bases (Fig. 39:9-10), especially in the case of juglets (Fig; 40: 10- 1 1). Though none are red-slipped, net-burnish does appear. Parallels were found in EB II contexts at Tel Dan and the Kinneret tomb, and continue to appear in later assemblages at Megiddo Stratum XVII, Tel Dan Phase 7, and Beth-Shean Strata XIII-XII. Storage Jars The absolute number of storage jars found in this phase is much higher than in the previous phases. All the main types continue to appear, and only one type appears in Stratum XIIA for the first time. Type SJ lie. Jars with an out-turned rim and a gutter (Figs. 37:13; 39:14), made of metallic ware or red-slipped, make their first appearance. These are paralleled by vessels with such "channeled" rims found mainly in EB III contexts, e.g., at Beth Yerah, Hazor Area L, Shamir, and Yarmouth Bronze Ancien HIB. Combed jars. An almost complete example was found in L. 518A (Fig. 38:8; Photo 60). This is a hand-made metallic storage jar with a flat base and two handles attached/squeezed into the wall. Parallels were found in EB II contexts at Beth Yerah (Amiran 1969: PI. 16:l)andTel Dan, and in an EB III context at Hazor Area L. (For a discus- sion of the different types of combed jars and their signifi- cance, see the section on Stratum XIIE in Area A below.) Storage jar with vestigial handles (Fig. 40:17; Photo 37). This jar can be attributed on the basis of its ware and rim shape to Type SJ lb. Two special features are the four elongated projections on its shoulder and the vestigial handles on the body. An almost identical storage jar was found at Megiddo Stratum XVI. The non-functional char- acter of these features and the general affinity between the Tel Qashish and Megiddo pottery repertoires, as well as the geographical proximity of the two sites, might suggest a common source (workshop) of these two jars. Twin Vessels While this form is known from many Early Bronze Age sites, the Tel Qashish example (Fig. 40:8; Photos 37, 61) is one of the most complete. Like most of its parallels, the twin vessel is red-slipped. Parallels were found mainly in EB III contexts, at Megiddo Stratum XVI, Beth Yerah, Tel Dan Phase 7, Yarmouth Bronze Ancien HIB, and 'Ai Phase VII. Twin vessels are already found in the EB I. Their function is unknown; in the later part of the Early Bronze Age, they occur together with basins, at Beth Yerah and Yarmouth, and might be interpreted as equipment used in the oil-production process (Esse 1 99 1 : 1 23). Cylinder-seal Impressions Two geometric cylinder-seal impressions (Figs. 37:14; 40:21) were found in this phase. Both are impressed on metallic combed body sherds (see Chapter 10). STRATUM XI (Fig. 45) The problematic nature of this stratum is described in Chapter 6. No undisturbed floors could be identified. Fig. 45 presents a representative group of pottery attributed to this stratum. In the sherd-count Tables 6-11, only recognized EB II-III types from undisturbed baskets were included. Most of the pottery types presented in Fig. 45 may be attributed to the Early Bronze Age (Fig. 45:1-17). The pottery assemblage from this stratum is similar to that from the previous Stratum XII phases, especially Stratum XIIA. No new types were observed in Stratum XI, except for one straight-sided bowl, which might be an earlier EB I intrusion. Most of the main types discussed above are represented in Stratum XI: Bowls of Types B I, B V a-b, and B VIII a-b. Platters of Type PL la, all of them metallic; Type PL Ib-c, both of which first appear in Stratum XIIA; and Type PL IIIa-b, red-slipped. 137</page><page sequence="178">CHAPTER 8 Kraters of Type K I in metallic ware. Holemouth jars of all types. The straight-sided cooking pot (Fig. 45:21), considered a hallmark of the Middle Bronze Age, was recently found in EB III contexts at Zeiraqoun (H. Genz, personal communica- tion). Its chronological attribution is therefore inconclusive. The other vessels (Fig. 45: 19-29) can safely be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age. The ceramic assemblage of Stratum XI, consisting of a mixture of Early Bronze Age and intrusive Middle Bronze Age pottery, thus seems to have no chronological signifi- cance. Excavations under the Stratum XI walls W. 101 and W. 1 02 revealed an earthen fill between these and the walls of the earlier stratum (L. 596). The pottery from this fill is mixed, consisting of Early Bronze and some Middle Bronze Age sherds (Fig. 45:19-30). This observation further supports a later date for the Stratum XI building. SUMMARY: STRATA XII-XI IN AREA B A few chronological conclusions can be suggested based on the above discussion. It should be borne in mind, however, that most of the pottery types are represented only by sherds, and the presence of stray sherds out of contexts is always a possibility. No pottery types that can be assigned exclusively to the EB III were found in either of the earlier phases of Stratum XII in Area B, Strata XIIC-XIIB. All the types attributed to these phases are typical of EB II contexts, such as carinated metallic bowls (Type B Vild) and metallic platters with a triangular rim (Type PL la) and with an elongated rim (Type PL Ila-b). Other types appear in EB II contexts, but continue into the EB III: hemispherical (Type B III), shallow (Type B II), and ledge-rim bowls (Type B V), ledge-rim kraters, metallic juglets and jugs, squat wide-necked storage jars (Type SJ Ia-b), and metallic combed storage jars (Types II-III). Most of the vessels found in these two phases are made of metallic ware. This is particularly evident in the platter reper- toire. More than 50% of the platters are metallic, and only one sherd of Type PL la in each phase is non-metallic and red-slipped. Stratum XIIA presented a somewhat different picture. Most of the types found in the first two phases continue to appear. These include types that are usually considered as characteristic of the EB II, such as carinated metallic bowls (Types VIIb-d) and metallic-ware platters with a triangular rim (Types PL Ia-b) and with an elongated rim (Types PL Ila-b). Some types, however, appear in Stratum XIIA for the first time. These are platters with a short rounded rim (Type PL Ic), platters with net-burnishing, and gutter-rim storage jars (Type SJ IIIc). Some are clearly EB III types, such as platter-like bowls, shallow platters with a simple rim (Type PL V), small holemouth jars with a rectangular rim, and the twin vessel. The number of metallic-ware vessels, especially platters, decreases in this phase, while non-metallic red-slipped examples begin to appear in larger quantities. It should be noted, that even in Stratum XIIA, metallic ware is still predominant, most notably in the platter and storage jar repertoires. The quantity of red-slipped buff ware increases, however, considerably. The same line of development is observed in the pottery repertoire of Area A, where it reaches its peak in Stratum XIIA, in which not even a single metallic- ware platter was found. This stage is not encountered in Area B. No objects other than pottery that can safely be attributed to the EB III were found in Area B. The following is the suggested dating of the EB II and EB III strata in Area B: Phase Architectural Features Relative Dating XIIC F ortification wall with drainage channels, EB II "water reservoir," curvilinear wall. XIIB Fortification wall, narrowed drainage EBII channel, two-roomed main building, other one-roomed buildings, "sheep-folds" outside the wall. XIIA Fortification wall, one-roomed main Late EB II/EB III building, other one-roomed paved and "corner-strengthened" buildings, blocking of drainage channel. XI No fortification wall, eight-roomed EB? Intermediate building. Bronze Age? MB? In architectural terms, no major changes in the plan of the area are discernible between the two earlier phases, mainly because no coherent plan of the earliest phase, Stratum XIIC, could be determined. The role of the fortification wall (W. 305) that so clearly served as part of a fortification system in its first phase in Stratum XIIC appears to be somewhat different in Stratum XIIB, when the presence of extramural walls and floors might suggest a peaceful period at Tel Qashish. The buildings attributed to Stratum XIIB seem to be attached to the fortification wall from the inside, with no clear evidence of an alley in between (in contrast to Area A). Several changes from the previous plans seem to have occurred in the transition to Stratum XIIA. The area outside the fortification wall was re-fortified by a massive wall running parallel to it and the blocking of the drainage channel from the outside. The walls attached to the fortifica- tion wall from the inside no longer exist, and this area might have been turned into a public area, possibly an alley. The main building is no longer divided into two rooms but forms one large unit, and stone pavements, corner installations, and strengthening were built inside the rooms. These changes might reflect a different spatial organization of the settle- ment, traces of which are also discernible in the transition from Stratum XIIC to Stratum XIIB in Area A. 138</page><page sequence="179">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III POTTERY THE ASSEMBLAGES OF AREA A In contrast to Area B, Area A was excavated on a limited scale and no complete plan of a building attributable to the EB II-III could be discerned. Two main architectural features of this period were identified on the upper part of the tel. The first is the fortification wall with the alley running alongside it, similar to that in Area B. The second is a rectan- gular building bordering the alley from the south, with the northern wall of this building parallel to the fortification wall. The building underwent several changes, including floor raising, the construction of cross-walls, the reuse of earlier walls as pavements, and the blocking of an entrance in the southern wall. These modifications were defined as the phases of Stratum XII. The differences in elevation between the various floors of the building are a matter of only a few centimeters, making the distinction between the sub- phases of Stratum XII difficult. Whenever possible, baskets of pottery belonging to the "make-up" layers of the floors were counted separately, enabling a finer division of the phases. Stratum XIIE (Plans 13-14): The earliest phase of the EB II-III sequence in Area A. Below it were only fills containing EB I pottery (Fig. 2). The construction of the fortification wall and the wall parallel to it is attributed to this phase. Another feature, attributed to this phase mainly on the basis of relative heights, is the curved wall in Squares Y/15-16. The pottery connected with this wall dates from the EB II-III, although the wall's curvilinear nature resem- bles that of the EB I walls in Area B (Plan 2). Strata XIID-XIIA (Plans 1 5-22): The same general plan of one large building separated from the fortification wall W. 241 by a narrow alley continues, with minor changes, throughout these four phases of Stratum XII. Stratum XI (Plan 23): The latest remains of the EB II-III in this area consist mainly of fragmentary walls. Though the fortification wall has gone out of use, in contrast to Area B, there is no coherent plan of this post-fortification wall occu- pation. The raw data on the EB II-III pottery of Area A are presented in sherd-count Tables 12-17. STRATUM XIIE (Figs. 46-48)' The loci discussed below are related either to the alley running parallel to the fortification wall (L. 24 1 , L. 441 ) or to the curved wall (L. 446 and L. 447). The definition of the former as floors should be treated with caution, as they belong to a street that continued in use throughout the Stratum XII sequence in the area. Bowls Most of the bowls found in this phase are of types that continue to appear in the subsequent phases. Type B I (Fig. 48:9). The shallow metallic bowls are char- acteristic of EB II contexts (see discussion of this type under Stratum XIIC in Area B). Type B VI (Fig. 48:2). This type of bowl, with a relatively large diameter and rounded carination in the middle of the body, is uncommon. Only one other example was found, in Stratum XIIA in Area B. Parallels come from EB III contexts at Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA and 'Ai Phase VII. Type B Villa (Fig. 46: 1 ). In Area B, this type first appears in Stratum XIIA. Parallels were found mainly in EB II contexts at Tel Kinnerot and Beth ha-'Emeq Stratum II. Type B IX (Fig. 46:2). One bowl of this type was found in this phase. The other sherd of an incised bowl (Fig. 46:3) is of a different type, made of metallic unslipped ware. A similar type was found at Tel Dan in a late EB III context (Greenberg 1996a: Fig. 3.32:14). Platters The platters found in this phase belong to the most common types discussed above, PL la (Fig. 46:4), PL Ha (Figs. 46:6; 47:3), and PL lib (Fig. 46:5). All the platters are made of metallic ware and are usually burnished. Parallels come mainly from EB II contexts, such as Me'ona Stratum I, Tel Dan Phase 5, Beth ha-'Emeq Stratum II, Tel Kinnerot, Tell el-Far'ah (North) Bronze Ancien I, and 'Ai Phase III. Kraters The kraters found in this phase belong to Type K II, with straight walls and a flattened rim, red-slipped on the outside and inside the rim (Fig. 48:3). The type is unknown in Area B, except for one atypical krater in Stratum XIIB (Fig. 36:3). No exact parallels for these vessels were found. They bear a general resemblance in form, but not in material or surface treatment, to the combed kraters from Hazor Area L (Greenberg 1987: Fig. 33:19). Holemouth Jars All the types of holemouth jars are represented in this phase. Holemouth jars with a sharpened rim of Type H IV appear for the first time in this phase and disappear thereafter (Table 15). In Area B, the type appears in increasing quanti- ties in the later phases. Juglets and Jugs Most of the indicative sherds of small vessels found in this phase belong to common types of the period. These are flat bases of juglets (Fig. 46:7) and jugs (Fig. 48:11) and elon- gated necks (Figs. 47:4, 48:4). Most of the sherds are metallic and burnished, and few are red-slipped. Storage Jars Type SJ la. The "cooking-pot" jars are the most common type of storage jar in this phase and throughout the Stratum XII sequence in Area A, much as in Area B. These jars have a simple out-turned rim and a short neck (Figs. 46:8-9; 47:5; 48:5-8, 10). In some cases, the rim is somewhat squared-off (Fig. 48:6-8), a feature that also appears in EB II contexts at Tel Dan, Beth Yerah, and Tel Kinnerot. Type S J Ibi . Storage jars with a simple out-turned rim are also common in this phase, although not as common as the "cooking-pot" jars with the same form of Type SJ la. In some cases, the type is red-slipped on the outside (Fig. 47:6). Parallels were found at Tel Kinnerot, Rosh ha-Niqra Stratum II, and Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA. 139</page><page sequence="180">CHAPTER 8 Type SJ lib. The most complete example of the type was found in this phase (Fig. 46: 1 1 ; Photo 62). The jar has an out- turned folded rim, sloping shoulders, and an elongated body with a flat base. It is made of red metallic material and the entire body is pattern-combed. Although pattern-combed jar sherds have been found at many EB II- III sites, not many complete vessels are published. The shape of the Tel Qashish jar is paralleled at Megiddo Stratum XV and Beth ha-'Emeq Stratum I. The difference between this storage jar and the Area B Stratum XIIA example (Fig. 38:8; Photo 60) is note- worthy. While both are metallic and combed, they differ in almost every other respect: the Area B jar is ovoid, with a wide flat base and two handles pressed into the body at its widest point. The pattern of combing consists of oblique lines in all directions between horizontal lines. The Area A jar is larger and taller, of slender elongated proportions, and has a flaring rim and a different combing pattern, consisting of vertical lines cut by horizontal lines all over the body. The combed storage jars of shorter ovoid proportions are typical of EB II contexts, e.g., at Tel Dan Phases 5 and 6a-b, or of the earlier phases of the EB III, such as at Hazor. A combed jar of similar proportions was found in the tomb of Dj er at Abydos, thus establishing the date of this type as the EB II (Petrie 1902: PI. VIII:9). In later contexts, the storage jars become taller, narrower, and often lack handles. A rope decoration is usually applied on the neck (Greenberg 2000), a feature common at Tel Qashish from Stratum XIID onwards. Examples were found at Megiddo XVII-XV, Beth ha-'Emeq, Beth Yerah, Hazor Area A, and in the later assemblage at Tel Dan (Stager 1992:38-39). The cylinder-seal impressions at Tel Qashish are usually found on sherds belonging to metallic combed storage jars of Types S J Ilb-c (Chapter 10; Ben-Tor 1994). The difference in form between these two variants might suggest a difference in function. The squat two-handled jars are easier to move and carry, and were probably used in the Syrian-Canaanite-Egyptian EB II trade network (Esse 1991:109-116; Stager 1992:38-39). The large pithoi without handles probably served for storage. STRATA XIID-XIIA (Figs. 49-60) These sub-phases of Stratum XII in the Area A building comprise an accumulation of 1.5 m. Four floors associated with the same outer walls (W. 69, W. 84+ W. 56, and W. 233) were identified. It is therefore justified to treat these sub- phases as a single stratum, as in the case of the main occupa- tion phase in Area B, Stratum XIIB. The following discus- sion deals with these phases as part of the same stratum, pointing out the similarities and differences in the appear- ance of the various pottery types in each phase. Bowls Type B I. One metallic bowl of this type, typical of EB II contexts, was found in phase XIID (Fig. 51:6), but none appear in the subsequent phases. Type B III. Simple hemispherical bowls are represented in all phases of Stratum XII. They are either burnished (Fig. 56:1) or red-slipped (Fig. 59:1), but never metallic. In Area B, this type appears in Strata XIIB and XIIA. Type B IV. These bowls, with a tapering rim and a flat base, are not very common in either area. Most examples come from fills in Area A, and therefore have little chrono- logical significance. Type B V (Figs. 53:7; 55: 1). Shelf-rim bowls appear in all the Stratum XII phases, except for Stratum XIIE. The bowls have thick walls and are often red-slipped, but never metallic. They begin to appear in Stratum XIIC and continue through Stratum XIIA. Parallels were found in EB II contexts such as the early assemblage at Tel Dan, but mainly in EB III contexts, e.g., Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA, Lachish Cave 1513, and 'Ai Phase V. Type B VI. Bowls with a rounded carination begin to appear in Stratum XIIE and their last appearance is in Stratum XIIC. An unusual burnished bowl attributed to this type was found in Stratum XIID (Fig. 49:1). Type B VII. Two sub-types of carinated bowls appear in these phases in Area A, especially in Strata XIID-C: Type B Vile. The bowls with an in-turnëd rim (Figs. 50:2; 51:8) are sometimes metallic. Parallels come mainly from EB II contexts, such as the Kinneret tomb and Beth Yerah. Type B Vild. Bowls of this type, with an out-turned rim and a sharp carination (Fig. 53:6), are not very common at Tel Qashish. They are similar to the type discussed by Beck and are considered a hallmark of the EB II (P. Beck 1985a; Esse 1991:45-46). Type B VIII. Platter-like bowls are relatively common in all the Stratum XII phases in Area A: Type B Villa. These bowls, similar in shape to larger platters of Type PL la, appear throughout the Stratum XII sequence (Figs. 50:1; 58:4). Most are either unslipped (in the lower phases) or red-slipped (in the upper phases). Only one metallic sherd of this type was found. No metallic bowls were found from Stratum XIIB onwards. This is similar to the development of platters described earlier. The same phenomenon was observed by Greenberg in the Tel Dan and Hazor sequences (1987:157; 1996a:105). Type B VIIIb2. Bowls with an elongated inverted rim, similar in form to platters of Type PL II, begin to appear in Stratum XIID. They are burnished in most cases (Fig. 50:9) and sometimes also red-slipped (Fig. 51:9). Type B IX. A sherd of this type was found in Stratum XIIC (Fig. 53:17). The form of the incisions on the inside of the vessel is similar to the "twig-impressions" on an open metallic ware bowl in the Tel Dan early assemblage. As noted above, this variant is different from the flat-based red- slipped type attributed to Stratum XIIC in Area B (Fig. 24:4-6). Platters Type PL la. Platters of this type appear throughout the Stratum XII sequence. In the lower phases, Strata XIIE-XIIC, most are metallic and none are red-slipped (Figs. 49:2; 50:3; 55:3). The material is often orange in color and very fine (Esse 1991:46), although in the upper phases there is a tendency toward lighter, coarser material. The type appears mainly in EB II contexts, at Me'ona Stratum I, Tel Dan (the early assemblage), Beth Yerah, the Kinneret tomb, Yarmouth Bronze Ancien II, and 'Ai Phase III. It continues into the EB III at Tel Dan (the late assemblage) and 'Ai Phase 140</page><page sequence="181">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II-III POTTERY VI. Red-slipped platters (Fig. 55:2) begin to appear side by side with the metallic platters in Stratum XIIB. The former are sometimes burnished, but none are metallic. At Tel Qashish, no metallic platters of any type are red-slipped, in contrast to the Beth Yerah assemblage (Esse 1991:46). Type PL lb (Figs. 53:2; 60: 1). These platters, with a trian- gular rim and a recess below the rim on the outside, are often red-slipped and never burnished. They appear relatively late in the sequence, from Stratum XIIC to Stratum XIIA. Paral- lels for this type were found mainly in EB III contexts, e.g., Megiddo Phase J-6, Hazor Area L, and Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA. In the later phases, these platters are net- burnished on the inside (Fig. 60:2), a characteristic of EB III contexts, such as Megiddo Phase J-6, the Tel Dan late assem- blage, Hazor Stratum XIX, Beth-Shean Strata XIV-XII, 'Ai Phases VI-VII, Yarmouth Bronze Ancien III, and Lachish. Type PL Ic (Figs. 53:1; 58:6). This type, with a rounded rim, appears for the first time in Stratum XIIC, but reaches its peak only in Stratum XIIA. In most cases, the platters are red-slipped, and only one example is metallic. Some of the platters belonging to this type are wide and shallow (Fig. 53:3). This phenomenon has been observed in other EB III contexts (Greenberg 1996a: 103-105). Type PL Id. The rim shape of these platters is similar to the former type, with the addition of a mold-made groove just below the rim (Figs. 56:2-3; 57:1; 59:2; 60:3,11). One example of this type is metallic. While parallels can be found in EB II contexts, e.g., at Yarmouth Bronze Ancien II, most examples are attributed to EB III contexts, at Beth Yerah, Hazor Stratum XIX, 'Ai Phases IV- VI, and Tel 'Ira. Type PL Ha. Platters of this type are the most common in the Tel Qashish platter repertoire. In the lower phases, espe- cially Stratum XIID, which marks the peak of their appear- ance, they are usually metallic and burnished (Figs. 49:3-4; 51:2). In the later phases, their quantity decreases signifi- cantly, and in Stratum XIIA mainly red-slipped platters appear. This type is characteristic of EB II contexts, such as Me'ona Stratum I, the Tel Dan early assemblage, and Tel Dalit. Type PL lib. This type, with a thickened elongated rim, develops similarly to PL Ha: its peak appearance is in Stratum XIID, after which only a few sherds were found. The main difference between the types seems to be in the ware. Most sherds of Type PL lib are of brown-gray Ware, metallic and burnished (Figs. 49:5; 50:4, 10; 5 1 : 10- 12, 18). One sherd from Stratum XIID (Fig. 49:6) and two from Stratum XIIA (Fig. 57:2-3) are red-slipped. Parallels were found mainly in EB II contexts, at Beth Yerah, Tel Dan Phases 6a-b, and 'Ai Phase IV, but some continue into the EB III, at Beth Yerah and Rosh ha-Niqra Stratum I. Esse ascribed this ware to the EB II pottery corpus at Beth Yerah (1991 :47). In Area B, the two variants, PL Ha and PL lib, continue to appear throughout the Stratum XII sequence, and their quantity, in contrast to Area A, increases in the later phases. Type PL III. Platters with a shelf rim are not very common in Area A, especially compared to their relatively high proportions in the platter repertoire of Area B. Type PL Ilia. Two metallic examples were found in Stratum XIID and a red-slipped example in Stratum XIIA. Type PL Illb. Two sherds of this variant were found in Area A: a metallic platter in Stratum XIIB (Fig. 55: 12) and a red-slipped example in Stratum XIIA. Parallels for the metallic variant are found in EB II contexts, at Beth Yerah and 'Ai Phase III, and in EB III contexts, at Hazor Area L and Rosh ha-Niqra Stratum I. Type PL IIIc. This variant is represented only in Stratum XIIA by two red-slipped sherds. Type PL IV. This type, with a thickened "nail" rim, is not very common in either area. In Area A, it is represented by two sherds in Stratum XIIA (Fig. 60:4), both red-slipped. Parallels were found at Beth Yerah in both EB II and EB III contexts. Vat (Fig. 54:1). A shallow, wide-mouthed vessel with straight walls and a flat base, this example is unslipped. Parallels were found mainly in EB III contexts, at Megiddo Stratum XVIII and Stages IV-I, 'Afula, Tel Dan (the late assemblage), and 'Ai Phase VIII. Kraters Type K I. Kraters of this type were found in all the Stratum XII phases, with the exception of the earliest phase XIIE. Type K II (Fig. 50:11). This type is unique to Area A, where it appears in all the Stratum XII phases except XIIB. No exact parallels were found. Type K III (Fig. 54:2). A large holemouth krater with an out-turned rim and a spout, the vessel is red-slipped on the outside and resembles the holemouth jars in ware. Parallels were found in EB III contexts, at Beth-Shean Stratum XIII, Tel Kishion, and Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA. Holemouth Jars All types of holemouth jars appear throughout the Stratum XII sequence. One example (Fig. 56:6; Photo 63) has a spout and a line of incisions below the rim. These two features are commonly found in EB III contexts, such as Megiddo Strata XVI-XVII. Juglets and Jugs Sherds of juglets and jugs, the majority of which are metallic and burnished, were found in all the Stratum XII phases. Most of the sherds belong to the common types, with a simple rim, long neck, and rounded body (Figs. 49:7; 50:5, 13-14; 53:8; 60:12 [Photo 65]). Noteworthy are red-slipped jugs with pattern-burnish (Figs. 54:4; 57:14), paralleled at Yarmouth Bronze Ancien HIB, jugs and juglets with semi- stump bases (Figs. 53 : 1 2-1 3; 60: 1 8), and juglets with degen- erate handles (Fig. 54:3). Storage Jars Type SJ la. Almost half the storage jar repertoire of each Stratum XII phase is of this variant. These "cooking-pot" jars are the most common vessel in the Tel Qashish EB II-III strata (Figs. 51:3-4; 53:4-5; 55:5-6; 56:9-11; 57:7-9; 58:9; 60: 1 4). Though there are many minor variations in rim shape or neck length, all these jars are made of the same coarse material. One variant from Stratum XIIC has an erect rim and is made of metallic ware, and is decorated with linear inci- sions (Fig. 53: 14). The rare examples of decoration on these vessels usually include incisions, simple line groups, and "potter's marks." 141</page><page sequence="182">CHAPTER 8 Type S J Ibi. This type appears side by side with jars of the previous type, although it is not as common. These storage jars are made of fine buff ware (Figs. 49:8; 50:7; 56: 12; 57: 10-1 1; 60:6) and some are red-slipped. The paral- lels from many sites are usually defined as cooking pots (Greenberg 1987:33-34, 82). A possible reconstruction of the body form of this type is suggested by a red-slipped jar with a flat base and handles (Fig. 58: 12). Parallels come from EB II contexts at 'Aiula, the Kinneret tomb, Tel Kinnerot, and Beth-Shean Stratum XIV. Type S J Ib2. Examples of this variant, with a thick rail rim, begin to appear in Stratum XIIC. Type SJ Ha. The most common variant is the jars and pithoi with a rounded rim, sometimes with a small gutter (Figs. 54:5-7; 56:13-14; 57:12; 58:11). These jars are usually metallic and often combed. Some examples are red- slipped. They appear throughout the Stratum XII sequence in both areas. Parallels are attributed mainly to EB III contexts, at Megiddo Phase J-6, Beth Yerah, Hazor Areas L and A and Stratum XX, Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA, Lachish Cave 6013, and 'Ai Phase VII. Type SJ lib (Fig. 57:13). In Area B, Type SJ IIa with a rounded rim and Type S J lib with a triangular rim appear in equal proportions. In Area A, however, jars of Type S J lib are much less common. Parallels were found in EB III contexts, at Beth Yerah and Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA. Type S J lie. The main characteristic of this variant is the channel or gutter rim (Figs. 5 1 : 1 5; 53 : 1 6; 60:7). The type is found in EB II contexts, at Tel Dan (the early assemblage), Beth Yerah, Tel Teo, Beth ha-'Emeq Stratum II, and Yarmouth Bronze Ancien II (where a similar form is deco- rated with white triangles and dots on a red surface). It continues to appear in EB III contexts at Hazor Stratum XXI, 'Ai Phase VII, and Kh. Zeiraqoun (H. Genz, personal communication). At Yoqne'am, jars of this type were found together with KKW sherds. Type SJ III (Figs. 54:8; 57: 15-16). In Area B, rope deco- rations or incised lines on the base of the neck are limited to Stratum XIIA, but they appear in Area A from the earliest phases. These features are paralleled mainly in EB III contexts, at Megiddo Stratum XVIII, Beth ha-'Emeq Stratum I, Tel Dan (the late assemblage), Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA, 'Ai Phases VI-VII, and Lachish Cave 6013. STRATUM XI (Fig. 61) Stratum XI is poorly represented in Area A (Plan 23). The only indicators of an EB II- III occupation postdating the fortification wall are some fragmentary walls and one floor, L. 302, which seals the wall. Most of the types found in Stratum XII are also represented in this stratum. No new types were observed, but some are conspicuously absent in this stratum. Bowls All the variants of bowl Types B IV, B V, B VI, and B VII are absent in Stratum XI. The last type, the carinated bowls, ceased to appear in Stratum XIIC. The types that are repre- sented are small shallow, hemispherical, and straight-sided bowls, all of which are red-slipped. One example of the platter-like bowl also appears (Fig. 61:1). Platters The types of platters represented in this stratum are: Type PL la, the appearance of which is consistent throughout the Stratum XII sequence in both the metallic- ware and red-slipped buff ware variants. Type PL lb (Fig. 61:2-4), which first appears in Stratum XIIC, continues into Stratum XI. Parallels for these platters come from EB III contexts, at Beth Yerah, Tel Dan Phase 7, Hazor Strata XIX-XX, Yarmouth Bronze Ancien IIIA, and 'Ai Phase VI. Types PL Ila-b, which appear throughout the Stratum XII sequence, continue in Stratum XI. The examples are metallic and none are red-slipped. Kraters/Vats Only one krater was found in this stratum (Fig. 61:5). Possible parallels come from EB III contexts at Rosh ha- Niqra and Lachish. Holemouth Jars All the types continue to appear in this stratum. Noteworthy is a holemouth jar with a thickened flattened rim (Fig. 61:9), a type attributed by Esse (1991 :47) to the EB II. Juglets and Jugs Metallic and red-slipped body sherds of juglets and jugs continue to appear in this stratum. The bases are flat or slightly stumped (Fig. 61:6-7). Storage Jars Only two types appear in this stratum: Types SJ la (Fig. 61:10-12) and SJ Ibi (Fig. 61:13-17). None of the combed metallic jars characteristic of all the Stratum XII phases were found in Stratum XI. SUMMARY: STRATA XII-XI IN AREA A The following are a few general observations concerning the development of the pottery repertoire from Area A, bearing in mind the gradual nature of the changes and the overall continuity of settlement that characterizes Stratum XII in Area A. Stratum XIIE, the earliest fortified occupation phase in Area A, is characterized mainly by pottery types that have parallels in EB II contexts. These include metallic shallow bowls (Type B I), triangular-rim platters (Type PL la), and straight-walled kraters (Type K I). Despite the meager pottery assemblage recovered from this stratum, it can be attributed to the EB II, and is closely related to the Stratum XIIC assemblage from Area B. The sites that provide most of the parallels for the repertoire of this phase are Me'ona Stratum I (Braun 1996b), Tel Dan (the early assemblage) (Greenberg 1996a), and Beth Yerah (Esse 1982). Of these, Me'ona is especially important, as it was uninhabited during the EB III and thus provides a "clean" EB II repertoire. In contrast, none of the pottery types attributed to the main phases of Stratum XII in Area A (Strata XIID-XIIA) can be 142</page><page sequence="183">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II- III POTTERY attributed solely to the EB II. The carinated metallic bowls found at Tel Qashish are not typical of this family in general, and might represent a later development of the type. No painted decorations, whether "light-faced" or "white-on- red," were found. On the other hand, many types from these phases, especially the two later phases XIIB and XIIA, can be dated mainly to the EB III. These include pattern- burnished platters, platters with a rounded rim (Type PL Id) and with a triangular recessed rim (Type PL lb), kraters with a shelf rim or an out-turned rim, straight-sided vats, and rope decorations. To these can be added other objects, such as some of the cylinder-seal impressions (Chapter 10) and the decorated bone tube from Stratum XIIA (Fig. 59:3) (Chapter 12), which can securely be attributed to the EB III (P. Beck 1995:28; Zarzecki-Peleg 1993; Greenberg and Porat 1996:139). Some pottery types that appear only in the upper phases in Area B are common in all the phases of Stratum XII in Area A. These include platter-like bowls (Type B Villa), platters with a rounded rim (Type PL Ic), storage jars with a gutter rim (Type SJ lie), and metallic decorated body sherds. The percentage of red-slipped vessels in the Area A repertoire, whether bowls, platters, holemouth jars, juglets and jugs, or storage jars, is significant, while the Area B assemblage seems to be more "metallic" in nature. Pinpointing the moment of transition from the EB II to the EB III is complicated. The problem of continuity between the two periods in the local pottery tradition is well known. The distinction is almost impossible for assemblages lacking the fossiles directeurs of either period, i.e., the "Light Faced Painted Ware" for the EB II and KKW for the EB III (Esse 1991:64-67; Greenberg 1996a:105). If, however, such a transitional phase were to be defined at Tel Qashish, it would most probably be in the transition from Stratum XIIC to Stratum XIIB. Architecturally, this transi- tion is reflected in the change from a two-roomed building in Stratum XIIC (Plan 17) into a larger one-roomed building in Stratum XIIB (Plan 19). A large courtyard was added to the latter in Stratum XIIA (Plan 2 1 ). A similar development was observed in Area B, in the transition from Stratum XIIB to Stratum XIIA (compare Plans 7 and 9). In terms of the pottery assemblage, the transition from the EB II to the EB III in this area is indicated by several criteria. Stratum XIIB witnesses the disappearance of all metallic- ware carinated bowls (all the sub-types of B VII), although the other types of bowls continue to appear without major changes. The first appearance of red-slipped platters of Types PL la, PL lb and PL Id, which become the most common types in Stratum XIIA, is noted already in Stratum XIIC, and especially in Stratum XIIB. While in Strata XIIC and XIIB metallic-ware platters are still predominant, in Stratum XIIA, not a single metallic platter of any type was found, and the majority of the vessels are red-slipped. Greenberg describes a similar development as character- izing the transition from the early to the late assemblage, containing KKW sherds, at Tel Dan (1996a:99-105). At Tel Yarmouth, the "brune" metallic ware is limited to bowls and jugs in the EB II levels (Miroschedji 1988:71), while the EB III levels are characterized by decreasing quantities of basins and storage jars made of reddish metallic ware (Ibid.:77). The range of sites that provide parallels for the vessels attributed to the two upper phases in Area A (Strata XIIB and XIIA) is much wider. These include Megiddo Strata XVIII-XV, the Tel Dan late assemblage, the Beth Yerah EB III strata, and Hazor, as well as sites in central and southern Palestine, such as 'Ai, Lachish, Yarmouth, Tell el- Hesi, and Tel 'Ira. Tel Qashish thus provides another example of the phenomenon of "blurring the boundaries" between northern and southern Canaan during the EB III (Greenberg 1996a: 137). The following chronological sequence is suggested for Area A: « Phase Architectural Features Relative Dating XIIE Fortification wall? Curvilinear wall. EB II XIID Fortification wall, one-roomed building with traces of "weaving"? EB II XIIC F ortification wall, two-roomed building, entrance in long wall. EB II-Late XIIB Fortification wall, one-roomed paved building, entrance in long wall (?). EB Ill-Early XIIA F ortification wall, one-roomed building, entrance in short wall, courtyard with installations to the west. EB III XI Fortification wall goes out of use, fragmentary walls.

The samples represent the main EB II and III pottery types found at the site and include holemouth jars, storage jars of Type S J la, platters, Abydos-type metallic jugs, juglets, and combed storage jars (Table 1 8; Fig. 70). The goal of the analyses was to define the raw materials used for producing the pottery, to identify their geographic and geological sources, and to distinguish between locally made and imported vessels. A thin section was made from each sample for examina- tion under a standard polarizing microscope. The sand-sized temper and the coarse-silt components in the matrix (larger than ~0.04 mm) were identified, and the clayey matrix char- acterized. The samples were divided into pétrographie groups mainly on the basis of the temper, but the texture of the matrix was also taken into consideration. Due to the small number of samples, the division into pétrographie groups is rather general. RESULTS Following is a description of the pétrographie groups. Table 18 lists the temper and silty components of each sample. Group 1 The two holemouth jars that were analyzed belong to this group (Fig. 70:1-2). Large, black basalt grains and white calcite fragments are visible to the unaided eye. In thin section, the temper is basalt and calcite. The basalt is coarsely crystalline, with large crystals of plagioclase and purplish to greenish augite. Olivine was not observed but only iddingsite. The basalt grains are quite angular and could have been crushed deliberately. The calcite fragments are angular and were intentionally crushed before being added to the clay. Rare small, rounded micritic limestone grains were also observed. The matrix is fine, calcareous, with some silty quartz. The firing temperature was low, under 750°C. The closest source of basalt is the Kishon River bed, where sand and pebbles of varying compositions are found. The temper was not collected as sand from the river: the river sand is rounded and contains abundant limestone grains, whereas the temper is angular with only sparse limestone. The basalt was most probably collected as pebbles, crushed and sieved to the appropriate size, and then added to the clay. Calcite pebbles are also found on the riverbed, but calcite is abundant and could also come from veins within the lime- stone formation on Mt. Carmel. The source of the clay is a soil, most likely nearby. The two holemouth jars were made from locally available raw materials. Group 2 This group includes three storage jars of Type SJ la (Fig. 70:4-5), two platters (Fig. 70:3), and one combed storage jar, totaling six samples. The group is not as homoge- nous as Group 1, but the same components appear in all vessels. The temper comprises calcite and limestone. The calcite is angular and often broken along cleavage planes. The lime- stone is very coarsely crystalline. One platter (Sample 1271) contains a few basalt grains, with the same pétrographie features as the basalts in Group 1, and grog. The matrix is usually very calcareous, and frequently contains foraminifera of Senonian to Eocene age,1 as well as rare silty quartz grains. The storage jars are densely tempered and the matrix contains little or no foraminifera, while the two platters contain less temper and the clay is rich in foraminifera. This group is also low-fired, with temperatures rarely exceeding 750°C. The source of the calcite and coarse limestone is from veins commonly found on Mt. Carmel and in other carbonate rocks around Israel. The material was collected intentionally, crushed, and added to the clay. The clay was taken from marly formations of Senonian to Eocene age exposed nearby. Since all the raw materials are found near the site, the vessels were most probably made locally. However, such raw materials are so common that one cannot exclude the possibility that they were made elsewhere. Nevertheless, the basalt grains in one of the platters indicate that it is local. Group 3 The remaining platters (Fig. 70:6-8), a combed storage jar (Fig. 70:14), the metallic Abydos-type jugs (Fig. 70:10-12), and one juglet (Fig. 70:9) belong to this group. The temper comprises several components, all appearing in varying proportions in all the vessels. The temper components, in decreasing frequencies, are shale fragments, quartz, iron oxides, limestone, and siltstone. The shale fragments are derived from shales that were crushed and added to the clay. They appear in diverse colors (red, yellow, or black) and textures (pure clay, with silty quartz or silty iron oxides), and are rectangular to oval. 161</page><page sequence="202">CHAPTER 9 &lt;D ti O O.

The grain size of the quartz varies and it is usually poorly sorted. The only acces- sory minerals found with the quartz are iron oxides and rare tourmaline. The iron oxides also appear in a variety of forms and some contain silty quartz. Iron-rich oolites are found in a few samples. Limestone is a minor component, usually entirely decomposed as a result of firing, and its source, therefore, cannot be determined. The siltstone is cemented by clays or iron oxides, and occasionally contains fine mica laths. Two samples contain rounded, weathered grains of volcanic origin, of unknown composition and source. The clay is usually non-calcareous and is clay-rich with a well-ordered and oriented texture. The silty components are mainly quartz and oxides, in varying quantities and propor- tions. The totally decomposed carbonate grains indicate that the firing temperature was high, above 850°C and sometimes as high as 950°C. The source of the raw materials is in formations containing shales, siltstone and quartzose sand. Such forma- tions are found at the base of the Lower Cretaceous section in northern Israel (Greenberg and Porat 1996). One of the units contains iron-rich oolites, such as those found in some of the samples. The weathered basalt grains could be from the basalt flows found at the base of the section. The closest outcrop of these formations is near Qiryat Shemona and in the foothills of Mt. Hermon. Further north, they are found in Lebanon. Thus, the vessels of Group 3 were not made locally and were probably imported from the north. Sample 1262 One combed storage jar (Sample 1262) differs from the groups described above. The temper is grog, limestone, and chalk fragments of varying textures. The matrix is clay-rich and contains some silty quartz and carbonates. Firing temperature was around 800-850°C. This vessel could be either local or imported. CONCLUSIONS Evidence of two ceramic industries can be recognized at Tel Qashish. The first is represented by pétrographie Groups 1 and 2 and includes holemouth jars, platters, jugs, and storage jars. This is a local industry, using locally available raw materials and firing to a low temperature. None of the vessels made in this industry are metallic. The second industry includes assorted metallic wares: platters, jugs, a juglet, and combed storage jars. The raw materials are not found nearby, and the vessels are highly fired. These vessels are similar to other metallic vessels from other sites in northern Israel and were imported to the site, probably from the area of Tel Dan (Greenberg and Porat 1996). In general, vessels of similar shapes are also made of similar materials and belong to the same pétrographie group. Such a match between form and composition is typical of Early Bronze Age ceramic technology. Following is a brief summary of the composition of each type of vessel. The holemouth jars were locally made and, compositionally, are different from the storage jars of Type S J la, which most probably were also produced locally. Most of the platters are metallic and were imported, but two were made of locally available materials. All the metallic jugs are imported (non-metallic jugs were not analyzed). The combed storage jars are the most varied: one contains calcite and another grog, and both of these are probably local, while the third is imported. While it is rather surprising to find such a large proportion of imported vessels, this phenomenon is very common at other EB II sites north of Megiddo (Greenberg and Porat 1996).

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE MOTIFS Cylinder-seal impressions Nos. 1-1 5 clearly belong to the most popular and widespread family of geometric designs (Ben-Tor 1978:4-8, 42-43, 47-52, 63-69, Figs. 1-5, Pis. 1-5). Most of the Tel Qashish examples have clear paral- lels among the impressions previously found in Early Bronze Age contexts in Palestine. Nos. 1-3, three fragments of the same impression on one jar, are paralleled by a seal from Megiddo (Ibid.:4, Type IA-1, Fig. 1:1, PI. 1:1). The Tel Qashish impression differs, however, in its "double motif," namely, the lozenges below the herringbone. The "double motif' is known from Tel Dan (Ibid.:5, Type IC-4, Fig. 1:9, PI. 1:9). Nos. 4-5 may similarly be compared with the above- mentioned seal from Megiddo. It should be noted that impressions of this rather simple motif were unknown prior to the discovery at Tel Qashish of the example represented by Nos. 1-3. The herringbone motif usually appears in combina- tion with other geometric motifs on the same seal (Ibid.: 6-7, Type IE, Figs. 3:17-21, 4:22-25, Pis. 3:17-21, 4:22-25). No. 6 seems to consist of a group of zigzag lines, rather poorly executed. This example may be compared with an impression from Qabr el-Faras, located in the vicinity of Tel Qashish (Ibid.:5, Type IC-1, Fig. 1:8, PI. 1:8), or better yet, with an example from Har Haruvim, a site geographically even closer to Tel Qashish (Ibid.:8, Type IF-10, Fig. 5:33, PI. 5:33). Two additional parallels are known from Beth ha- 'Emeq to the west of the Jezreel Valley (P. Beck 1976:120-121, PI. 6:1-2). No.7 presents a group of elliptical and lozenge-shaped forms, and may thus be classified as belonging to the "eye motif' group. The only possible parallels thus far known in Israel are a bone cylinder-seal from Jericho and a stone stamp seal from Arad (Kenyon 1960:91, Fig. 27:4; Amiran et al. 1978: Pl. 116:2; Ben-Tor 1978:4, Type IA-2, Fig. 1:2; P. Beck 1984:98-99, Fig. 1:2). This motif is quite common among the cylinder-seals from the Diyala region, mainly made of stone, but occasionally also found on bone-made seals. When found in stratigraphie contexts, these seals are dated to the mid-to-late 4th millennium BCE. The motif may be traced back to rather naturalistic portrayals of fish and quadrupeds (Frankfort 1955: Nos. 25-26, 29, 41, 61, 183, 221, etc.; Amiet 1961: Pis. 21:348, 357-358, 21bis:c, m, 27:439-440, 29:468; Buchanan 1981: Nos. 156-157, 183, 1 93, 207). Over time, this motif underwent a gradual process of schematization and "disintegration" of the figurative depictions, eventually becoming entirely abstract. The center of production of these seals appears to have been located in northern Syria and in the Diyala region, where they are very common and the gradual process of "disinte- gration" of the motifs can easily be traced (Speiser 1 935 : 1 28, Pl. LIX:48; Mallowan 1947:132-133, PI. XXI:2; Frankfort 1955: Nos. 5, 14,40,47,61, 145, 158, 166, 176,215-216). No. 8 may represent another "disintegrated" motif, or a rather crude attempt at portraying a net design. The net design of No. 9 has several good parallels in seal impressions from nearby Tel Parar, as well as from Tel Qurs and Shamir (Ben-Tor 1978:4, Type IB-1-3, Fig. 1:5-7, PI. 1:5-7). Almost identical parallels for No. 10 come from 'Ein Quniyye, Beth Yerah, and nearby Beth ha-'Emeq (P. Beck 1976:121, PI. 6:3-4; Ben-Tor 1978:5, Type ID-1-2, Figs. 1:10, 2:11, Pis. 1:10, 2:11). The impression consistsofa frieze of lozenges alternatively filled by net or parallel lines and triangles with the same motifs filling the spaces between the lozenges. The design on No. 11 is closely related to that of No. 10, except that concentric circles alternate with the line-filled lozenges. The space fillers between the circles and the lozenges are triangles with lines, as in No. 1 0. Close parallels are known from Beth Yerah (Ibid.:5, Type ID-3, Fig. 2:12, PI. 2:12; Esse 1990:30*, Ills. 1:1, 2:1) and possibly from Tel Dan (Ben-Tor 1978:5, Type ID-5, Fig. 2:13, PI. 2:13). No. 12 portrays what appear to be concentric circles (or a spiral) and a herringbone motif (or vertically arranged half- circles). No exact parallels are known thus far; the closest is an impression from nearby Har Haruvim (Ibid.:8, Type IF-10, Fig. 5:33, PI. 5:33). The four impressed fragments Nos. 13-16 seem to origi- nate from one or perhaps two seals (No. 1 3 from one seal and Nos. 14, 15 and 16 from another?). Nos. 15 and 16, although found more than 50 m apart in two different areas of the exca- vation, actually join. This is all the more surprising in view of the fact that neither is a surface find and the displacement (most probably of No. 15) must therefore have occurred in antiquity. The design is composed of V-, M- and W-shaped lines, zigzags, and herringbones bordered on both sides by vertical lines. This motif is thus far unparalleled at any other site in Canaan. The closest parallels come from Lerna, where impressions that bear a close resemblance to some of the examples under discussion were found (Wiencke 1970: Nos. 252-253, 260). The affinity between the Palestinian Early Bronze Age geometric cylinder-seal impressions and those from Lerna has already been noted and discussed previously (Ben-Tor 1978:67-69, 96-99). The resemblance of other geometric cylinder-seal impressions from Lerna - such as zigzag or wavy lines (Wiencke 1970: Nos. 251, 254-256, 261-263, 269-270), spirals and herringbone (Ibid.: Nos. 241-243), and concentric circles (Ibid.: Nos. 238-240) - to their Palestinian counterparts is also noteworthy. The four impressions Nos. 13-16 from Tel Qashish are an important addition to the growing corpus of archaeological artifacts indicating the existence of relations between Canaan and the Aegean in the third millennium BCE (Zarzecki-Peleg 1993). 170</page><page sequence="211">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE CYLINDER-SEAL IMPRESSIONS AND A STAMP SEAL No. 17 depicts an animal frieze in a tête-bêche arrange- ment. Although schematically portrayed, two distinctly different animals can be discerned: one has two short horns (?) and a tail and the other has one long, undulating horn and a shorter tail. One of the animals is clearly depicted with only three legs and the other, portrayed in the damaged frieze, is similarly reconstructed on the basis of the closely related parallels. The depiction of animals with three (or, occasion- ally, five) legs is well known from stamp and cylinder seals of the 4th millennium BCE from Syria, Mesopotamia, and Elam, and no satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon has thus far been proposed (Mallowan 1947:143, Pis. XVIII:7, 9; XIX:6; Amiet 1961: PL 7:145; Goff 1963:38, 53, 144, 146; Buchanan 1981: Nos. 87a, 104). The two closest known parallels come from Megiddo (Engberg and Shipton 1934a:35-36, Figs. 10B, IIB) and 'En Shadud (Braun 1985:80-81, Figs. 32:2A-B, PI. IX:A), both located in the vicinity of Tel Qashish. The two impressions from Megiddo and 'En Shadud were made by seals twice as large as the one used at Tel Qashish. Braun speculates that the Megiddo and 'En Shadud impressions may have been made by the same seal (Ibid.). Be that as it may, although the impression from Tel Qashish was made by a much smaller seal, the design of all three is almost identical, and the conclusion that all three (or two?) seals (and perhaps also the jars on which they were impressed) were made by the same artisan seems very reasonable. This artisan probably resided in the western Jezreel Valley, the region in which all three impressions were found. The relationship between the Megiddo impression (and, therefore, also those from 'En Shadud and Tel Qashish) and seal impressions from Byblos II and IV has been discussed elsewhere (Ben-Tor 1978:69-75, 104-105; 1985:9-14), and the suggested rela- tionship between Byblos and northern Israel is further supported by the impression from Tel Qashish. Nos. 18-19 are most probably two impressions of the same seal, though they were found some 20 m apart. The break and the vertical line above the head of the horned figure in both impressions make this conclusion almost a certainty. On the basis of the evidence at hand, it is impos- sible to determine whether both fragments originally belonged to the same jar (which seems to be the case) or whether they represent two impressions of the same seal on two different jars. Only a very small part of the scene is preserved on No. 19 and the reconstruction suggested in the drawing is based on the more complete impression, No. 1 8. The scene consists of a human figure standing in front of what looks like a seated long-horned animal, behind which is a multi-storied structure with many windows (?). These impressions clearly belong to a group depicting cultic scenes, discussed at length elsewhere (Ben-Tor 1977:90-100; 1978:11-12, 44-45, 57-61, 79-87). An almost exact parallel for the two impressions under discus- sion was found on the surface during a survey of the predom- inantly EB III site of Giv'at Rabi in the near vicinity. Two other closely related parallels come from Beth Yerah and Tel Dan (Ibid.: 12, 45, Type IIIC-4, Fig. 10:67, PI. 10:67; 11, 44, Type IIIC-1, Fig. 9:64, PI. 9:64). Previous analyses of these scenes led to the conclusion that they represent one basic scene consisting of buildings, humans and horned animals, with some examples depicting only buildings and humans. The two impressions from Tel Qashish, together with the recently discovered example from Giv'at Rabi and a réévaluation of the impressions from Beth Yerah and Tel Dan, seem to indicate a division of this family of seal impressions into two groups. In the first, the scene consists of a number of people located behind (or on the roof of?) a building, apparently engaged in a cultic dance (Ben-Tor 1977: Figs. 13-16, 21). The second group is char- acterized by a single human figure, a building that is taller and narrower than that in the first group, and a figure that looks like a horned animal, but could also be interpreted as a person masquerading as a horned animal. This figure is seated on a chair (?) placed in front of the building, facing the worshipper, who seems to be offering a three-leaved, plant- like object (Ben-Tor 1992a: Figs. 3-4). Nos. 18-19 from Tel Qashish clearly belong to the second group (for further discussion of these impressions and their possible origin and predecessors see Ben-Tor 1992a). No. 20 was not found in its original stratigraphie context. The ware is closely related to that of impressions Nos. 7, 8, and 17, clearly dating this sherd to the EB I. The design is incoherent, and it may not even be a seal impression. No. 21 is a large rectangular stamp seal, measuring 65x45x8 mm. It is made of soft limestone, matching the rock formation of Tel Qashish, and is thus clearly locally made. It has a large pierced lug handle in the middle of the back, and the face is engraved with a rather sloppily executed net design (Ben-Tor 1985:8, Figs. 12-13). While this geometric motif is very common, the shape of the seal is quite unique: among the thousands of stamp seals known from the ancient Near East, only a handful bear some resemblance to the Tel Qashish example. The closest parallel is a seal from Tel Kitan (Keel, Keel-Leu and Schroer 1989: No. 42; Eisenberg 1992), dating to the late Chalcolithic or the EB I period. The Tel Kitan seal is also made of soft limestone, but is slightly smaller, its lug handle is not pierced, and the engraved motif is figurative. Another example of a stamp seal very similar in form to the one from Tel Qashish was found in an unstratified context at Tel Dan (Biran 1994: Fig. 16; Miroschedji 1997:195, Fig. 5:3). Additional parallels in form, two of which also bear a net design, are three seals in the Yale Baby- lonian Collection and one in the Ashmolean Museum, all dated on stylistic grounds to the 5th-4th millennia BCE (Buchanan 1981: Figs. 3, 7, 9; 1984:2, PI. 1:1). II. STRATIGRAPHY AND CHRONOLOGY The stamp seal (No. 21) is unrelated to the rest of the glyptic material from Tel Qashish and was not found in its original stratigraphie context: it comes from the fill of a floor dated to the latest Early Bronze Age phase at the site. It is impossible to determine whether the stamp seal is contemporaneous with the floor or whether, which seems far more likely, it was brought in together with the rest of the floor fill material. On the basis of the similarity in shape to the Tel Kitan seal, as well as the possible Syrian parallels (see also Homès- Frédéricq 1970:11, "Plaquette"), an EB I dating of the Tel Qashish seal is most probable. The cylinder-seal impressions Nos. 1-16 depict 171</page><page sequence="212">CHAPTER 10 geometric motifs. Of these, Nos. 1-6 and 9-16 belong to a single, rather homogenous group, which is also the most common among all the known Early Bronze Age Palestinian cylinder-seal impressions (Ben-Tor 1978:4-8, 42-43, 47-52, 63-69, Figs. 1-5, Pis. 1-5; 1985:14-19). These are usually impressed immediately below the neck on the shoul- ders of storage jars, which are usually well fired (i.e., metallic ware) and, in many cases, also combed. Unfortu- nately, most of these impressions originate in equivocal stratigraphie contexts: many are surface finds and many come from mixed fills, pits, and other stratigraphically disturbed contexts. In the broadest sense, these impressions belong to EB II- III horizons, and the question as to whether they can safely be attributed to either the EB II or EB III, or even to both, is as yet undecided. The author has previously argued for the dating ofthese impressions to the EB III (Ibid.; Ibid.). This is supported by the discovery of several such seal impressions in unequivocal EB III contexts (Ben-Tor 1978:42-43), as well as the admittedly circumstantial evidence of other such impressions, albeit not found in situ, from sites with a distinct EB III occupation, such as Tel Dan, 'Ein Quniyye, the Leviah Enclosure, Beth Yerah, Hazor, and Bab edh-Dhra'. Esse's dating to the EB II of an impression from Beth Yerah (1990:31*) identical to No. 10 from Tel Qashish, if correct, makes the Beth Yerah impression the only known example dated securely to the EB II. It should be noted, however, that seal impressions identical to the one from Beth Yerah have been found in many of the exclusively EB III contexts at Kh. Zeiraqoun (Ibrahim and Mittmann 1987; 1988).* The three geometric impressions from Tel Kinnerot are dated by the excavator to the EB III (Fritz and Rosel 1 986:24; Fritz 1987:47). While Esse maintains that "the Early Bronze Age town was occupied only in EB I and EB II" (1990:33*, n. 18), the excavator makes no such statement. Such a claim is also made by Winn and Yakar, based on the absence of KKW at the site (1984:44). However, EB III sherds seem to be included in their "EB I- II" assemblages (Ibid.: Figs. 7:2, 8, 8:4, 5, 1 0: 1-3, 7). The fact that no KKW has thus far been found at Tel Kinnerot has absolutely no bearing on the issue of whether the site was occupied in the EB III or not (Ben-Tor 1978:90, 106-107; Kochavi 1989:4-6). The large corpus of cylinder-seal impressions on jars from Tell Gubba in the Hamrin Basin, dated to the ED I (Ii 1988), cannot be compared with the Palestinian seal impressions under discussion (contra Esse 1990:31 *-32*). While the Gubba impressions indeed portray geometric motifs, this does not necessarily make them comparable with the Pales- tinian examples. Furthermore, the postulated influence of the Tell Gubba impressions on the Palestinian ones (Esse 1990:32*) cannot be sustained also on a chronological basis, since the former are considerably earlier. The Tell Gubba jars were impressed with cylinder-seals typical of the Diyala region (Frankfort 1955: Nos. 83-142, 160, 210, 223, 241, 297, etc.), which have hardly anything in common with the Palestinian repertoire, particularly in terms of the spatial arrangement of the geometric motifs. The significance of the Hamrin Basin material is thus restricted to the phenomenon of using cylinder-seals to decorate pottery, common also in northern Canaan, Lebanon, and Syria. The argument for the existence of some kind of relation- ship between the Palestinian geometric seal impressions and those from Greece is far more convincing. Both groups are more or less contemporary, and in both places, storage jars were decorated by cylinder-seal impressions with a similar design repertoire and spatial arrangement. Moreover, an ever-increasing number of diverse archaeological artifacts seem to indicate a relationship between these two regions in the EB III (Hennessy 1967:82-83, PI. 77:12-17; Ben-Tor 1978:96-97; Zarzecki-Peleg 1993:20). Several jars decorated by geometric cylinder-seal impres- sions from EB III-IV Hama and Tarsus (Ben-Tor 1978:64-67, 98-99) represent two distinct groups that cannot be compared with the Palestinian impressions, mainly because the designs are completely different. The impressed jars from Ebla constitute yet another distinct group, with geometric impressions closely related to those from Hama (Ingholt 1940: Pis. XIV:6, XV: 1; Mazzoni 1984: Figs. 6, 9). One of the Ebla impressions, however, bears a striking resemblance to Palestinian examples (compare Mazzoni 1984: Fig. 13 with Ben-Tor 1978: Types IC-1, IC-4), and may perhaps be considered (the jar or the seal itself) an import at Ebla. It is hoped that more such impres- sions turn up at Ebla as the excavations proceed. It appears, therefore, that dating the geometric seal impressions under discussion to the EB III is well founded, and that these impressions could be considered one of the characteristics of the period, at least in northern Israel. The impressions from apparently EB II contexts at Tel Qashish, Nos. 1-3, which clearly belong to the same combed metallic storage jar, were not found in a clear-cut stratigraphie context: one sherd originates in Stratum XIID, another in Stratum XIIC, and the third in Stratum XIIB, the last already dated to the EB III (see pottery discussion, Chapter 8). The jar should thus most probably be dated to the EB III, but its attribution to the EB II cannot be ruled out with certainty. Impression No. 4 was found in L. 522 in Area B, the so- called "water reservoir," dated to Stratum XIIC, that is, to the EB II. While many identical seal impressions are known from secure EB III contexts (e.g., at Kh. Zeiraqoun, see above), given its rather simple and common design, the possibility that it dates from the EB II cannot be precluded. It seems, therefore, that while most of the seal impressions bearing geometric designs can securely be dated to the EB III, the possibility that they already begin to appear in the EB II cannot be entirely excluded. A final decision in this matter must await the discovery of such impressions in clear EB II contexts, preferably at exclusively EB II sites (such as those recently found at Qiryat Ata [A. Golani, personal communication]). Cylinder-seal impressions with geometric motifs, while very common in the EB III, are not limited to this period. In fact, considering their simple and common motifs, it is surprising how few have been found in earlier Early Bronze * I wish to thank Prof. S. Mittmann and Dr. H. Genz of the Kh. Zeiraqoun expedition for showing me the seal impressions from the site, most of which are as yet unpublished. 172</page><page sequence="213">THE EARLY BRONZE AGE CYLINDER-SEAL IMPRESSIONS AND A STAMP SEAL Age contexts. While these are also geometric, their motifs, as well as their spatial arrangement and the ware on which they are impressed, are clearly distinct from those of the EB III group discussed above. The clay and the finish of the EB I vessels are easily distinguishable from those of all the other periods at Tel Qashish. Thus, even when found out of contextúas in the case of both Nos. 7 and 8, their attribution to the EB I is certain. The nature of the "eye motif' of No. 7 is discussed above. The design of No. 8 is too uncharacteristic to enable a comparative analysis. An EB I seal impression from Beth Yerah (Esse 1 990:27*, No. 1, Ills. 1:3, 2:3), although quite similar to an EB III example from Tel Kinnerot (Fritz 1987:47), has no known EB I parallels thus far. It is indeed surprising that impressions in this simple style are so rare in EB I contexts in Palestine, and that virtually none have been found in clear-cut EB II contexts (for a possible exception from Beth Yerah see above, and Esse 1990:27*, No. 2, 31*; Ills. 1:6, 2:5).' One would expect this situation to change as a result of the contin- uous accumulation of newly excavated material. Impression No. 1 7 is clearly unstratified, but its well strat- ified and clearly dated parallels from 'En Shadud and Megiddo, discussed above, as well as the particular ware on which it is impressed, securely place it within the EB I. Nos. 18-19 and their close parallels are discussed above (for further discussion of this group of seal impressions see Ben-Tor 1992a). No. 19 is a surface find, but No. 18, though not found in its original context, comes from an EB III locus situated above the fortification wall, which by then had apparently gone out of use. The two seal impressions are securely dated to the EB III also on the basis of the well-strat- ified and dated example from Beth Yerah (Ben-Tor 1978: 12, 45, Type IIIC-4, Fig. 10:67, PI. 10:67; 1985:19-25). Somewhat related predecessors of this group from the Diyala region, Syria, and, more recently, EB I Kabri in northern Israel have been noted (Ben-Tor 1 992a: 1 6 1-1 64). In view of these finds, the future discovery of related impressions of this type from EB II contexts is perhaps to be expected. III. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GLYPTIC ASSEMBLAGE FROM TEL QASHISH Two aspects of this assemblage warrant speçial attention. The first is the information these artifacts provide regarding local schools of artisans and foreign relations, and the second concerns the relatively large number of seal impressions found at this small site. The Tel Qashish impressions attributed to EB I indicate a local, Palestinian school of seal manufacturers (stamp seal No. 21), as well as a school specific to the western Jezreel Valley (No. 17), while Nos. 7-8 represent an advanced stage of "disintegration" of motifs that is characteristic of Pales- tine. These artifacts also indicate a degree of connection with regions to the north, i.e., the Lebanese coast (Byblos) and Syria, including northern Syria. The EB III material from Tel Qashish is clearly characteristic of sites in northern Israel, with the Jezreel Valley and southern Lebanon as its southern and northern borders respectively. At the same time, contacts with central Syria (Ebla) and even as far as Greece (Lerna) seem to be indicated. Such northern connections seem also to be indicated by the pétrographie analysis of five of the impressed jars, four of which bear geometrical designs (Nos. 1,5, 11, and 15), and one (No. 19) a cultic motif. Porat's conclusion (see Chapter 1 1 below) that these jars were not made locally but imported to Tel Qashish is based on the fact that the clay contains elements not found in the vicinity of the site. As a possible place of origin of these jars, she suggests "the area of Tel Dan" (Greenberg and Porat 1996). This conclusion, however, should be treated with caution: it is hardly conceiv- able that all the Tel Qashish storage jars, some of which exceed 1 m in height and are quite heavy, were brought to the site (whether full or empty) from the vicinity of Tel Dan, some 100 km to the north. It seems more probable that the EB III (II?) impressed jars, like those of the EB I (see above), were produced locally or in the immediate vicinity (as impression No. 17 indicates). Esse's argument is more convincing: "These specialized vessels were produced by potters who traveled from city to city and from village to village. . . The size of these jars would have precluded their transport for any great distance... and [they] were probably, in the main, produced at the site. . . The potter could have used various seal designs on any number of vessels" (1990:32*). The presence of elements in the clay that are "not found in the vicinity of Tel Qashish" (Porat, Chapter 11) may be explained by the possibility that the specialized potters carried with them not only the seals with which the finished vessels were impressed, but also some of the temper that they found best suited to the manufacture of these specialized vessels. The 20 cylinder-seal impressions (representing some 15 different seals) and one stamp seal found at Tel Qashish represent a very impressive number, particularly in light of the modest size of the site and the limited area in which Early Bronze Age remains were exposed. It is even more impres- sive when compared with the number of impressions found at nearby Megiddo, a much larger site at which the exposure of Early Bronze Age remains by far exceeds that at Tel Qashish. While the number of EB I impressions from Tel Qashish equals that from Megiddo (Engberg and Shipton 1934a:3 1-39; 1934b:90-93), not a single impression dating from the EB II- III is known from Megiddo, whereas nine or possibly ten impressions from this period were found at Tel Qashish. The total absence of such impressions at Megiddo is particularly noteworthy in the light of their presence at practically every other EB II-III site excavated or surveyed in northern Israel. The question of the significance of these stamped jars - whether the impressions were merely decorative or had another function, and whether jars were stamped for the same reasons wherever such vessels have been found - must for the time being remain open (Mazzoni 1984:30-34; Palmieri 1989). One observation, however, seems to be warranted: there is apparently no relationship between the size (and importance?) of a site and the number of impressed jars it yields. This is clearly demonstrated by the large number of such jars found in the small and apparently poor village of Tel Qashish and the large and prosperous site of Beth Yerah, as compared with the paucity of such artifacts at Megiddo. 173</page><page sequence="214">CHAPTER 11 PETROGRAPHIC ANALYSES OF CYLINDER-SEAL IMPRESSIONS Naomi Porat Geological Survey of Israel Five jar fragments with seal impressions were petrographi- cally analyzed. The impressions were selected to include the different decorative styles. The analyses were conducted in the same manner as for the other pottery (see Chapter 9), and the results are presented in Table 19. The pétrographie composition of all the seal impression samples is similar, containing varying proportions of quartz, decomposed limestone, various shale fragments, and highly weathered basalt, in a matrix rich in silt-size iron oxides, some decomposed carbonates, and occasionally also silty quartz. All were fired to a high temperature, in the range of 900°C. The seal impressions belong to pétrographie Group 3 (see Chapter 9), which includes the other combed metallic jars, as well as platters, jugs, and a juglet. The source of the jars bearing the seal impressions is not nearby, given that they contain raw materials not found in the vicinity of Tel Qashish. They most probably come from the same source as the other metallic ware found at sites throughout northern Israel. Greenberg and Porat (1996) suggest the area of Tel Dan as the possible source of this metallic ware, and the Tel Qashish seal impressions could also have originated there.

The pottery assemblage of this locus is dated to the EB III (see Chapter 8). The bone is polished, finely worked, and decorated with incisions in geometric patterns. It is ca. 8.5 cm long and 3 .25 cm wide. A considerable part of the object, including its edges, was not preserved.1 The bone belongs to a group of decorated bones found in the EB III in Palestine and the coastal plain of Syria, identi- fied and discussed by several scholars (for a general discus- sion and bibliography see Zarzecki-Peleg 1993, including the first publication of the Tel Qashish example). The function of these objects remains unclear. Some scholars have defined them as handles, paint-tubes, or other containers (Hennessy 1967:82 and bibliography there; Ben-Tor 1968:129). The bone from Tel Qashish, like the others in the same group, bears several decorative registers consisting of a number of geometric-pattern motifs in a specific arrange- ment that constitutes the composition. MOTIFS Two clearly recognizable registers are preserved on the Tel Qashish bone: 1. A row of rhombs filled with a net pattern (Motif 3, Zarzecki-Peleg 1993:4, Fig. 1:3). 2 . A continuous herringbone pattern bounded on each side by three parallel horizontal lines (Motif 5, Ibid.:5, Fig. 1:5). The first is a well-known motif on decorated bones from Palestine and the coastal plain of Syria. It consists a row of rhombs with touching corners that fill the entire register. The net pattern fill sets them off from the blank triangles that serve as a background. While the second motif is common in glyptic art of the period, it is an exception in the decorated bone repertoire from Palestine and the coastal plain of Syria (Ben-Tor 1978:47, Motif IA-2; Zarzecki-Peleg 1993:5). It does appear, however, on a few decorated bones from central and northern Syria (albeit without the horizontal parallel lines that serve as a frame on the Tel Qashish example), for example, from Tawi and possibly Hama (Kampuschulte and Orthmann 1984:98, Pl. 34:15; Thuesen 1988:171, Pl. 12:64). Furthermore, the continuous herringbone pattern on most of the examples in the central and northern Syria group, as well as in the Greek repertoire, is divided by a horizontal line in the middle of the register. This feature does not appear on the Tel Qashish example (Motif 10, Zarzecki-Peleg 1993:12, 17-19, Figs. 7, 11:2, 4; Peltenburg et al. 1996:11). Two other registers were partially preserved. One consists of four horizontal parallel lines. The poor preservation makes it difficult to determine whether the motif consists only of horizontal parallel lines (Motif 1, Zarzecki-Peleg 1993:3, Fig. 1:1) or whether the lines bounded another geometric pattern, as in the relatively complex frame register of Type II (Ibid.:6). Nevertheless, the arrangement of the registers indicates that this should be identified as the former, Motif 1 (see Composition below). The last register is too damaged for identification of the motif. There are several incisions near the edges on both sides, seemingly deliberately incised by the artist. On the basis of the direction of the incisions and the empty space Photo 69. Decorated bone, L. 384 (Figs. 59:3; 75). Fig. 75. EB II- III: deco- rated bone. 175</page><page sequence="216">CHAPTER 12 between them, this register may have been comprised of one of the geometric-unit motifs: a row of rhombs filled with a net pattern, parallel herringbone lines, or parallel zigzag lines (Motifs 3, 7, or 8). All bear filled elements with the remaining space blank (Ibid.:4-5, 9-10). COMPOSITION In general, the bones are decorated with several registers that cover almost the entire object. The arrangement of the different registers in the repertoire from Palestine and the coastal plain of Syria is consistently represented by three main types (Ibid.:5-8). These bear "dominant" and "frame" registers, divided in accordance with the size and the nature of the motifs (Ibid.:5, 10). In addition, it should be noted that the motif comprised of the row of rhombs filled with a net pattern (Motif 3), the "dominant" register, is the main common motif characteristic of the three types (Ibid.: 10). The arrangement on the preserved registers on the bone from Tel Qashish is A?-B-C-[D or B?...], and it may be defined as Type I or III, according to the typology of the decorated bones from Palestine and the coastal plain of Syria. CONCLUSIONS Some observations regarding the Tel Qashish decorated bone may add to our understanding of these objects: 1 . The object belongs to the group of decorated bones from Syria-Palestine (Type I or III) and represents the first appearance of the herringbone motif in this group. As noted above, this motif (generally with a dividing line in the middle of the register, in contrast to the Tel Qashish example) appears on a few decorated bones in the central and northern Syria group. The commonness of this incised motif, however, does not allow for any specific conclusion. 2. The stratigraphie context in which the bone was found supports the attribution of these objects to the EB III. 3. The Tel Qashish decorated bone, together with those found at Byblos, indicates that the geographical distribu- tion of the group does not overlap with that of the KKW family, although they are contemporary (Prausnitz 1955:23; Ben-Tor 1968:130; Zarzecki-Peleg 1993:20). FOOTNOTES 1 The bone was identified by Justin Lev-Tov, Department of Anthropology, University of Tennessee, as the humerus of a cow. 176</page><page sequence="217">CHAPTER 13 A BEAD Sharon Zuckerman Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem One bead was found in the Early Bronze Age strata at Tel Qashish (Fig. 27:11, Photo 70). The bead was found in L. 522, the so-called "water reservoir" (Plan 5). It is attrib- uted to Stratum XIIC, the earliest fortified settlement at the site, dated to the EB II. The bead might be termed "butterfly-shaped" or "double- ax shaped." It consists of a central rounded "stem" that is vertically perforated, with a flat oval "wing" on each side. The perforation along the axis justifies its definition as a bead rather than a pendant (H.C. Beck 1928: 11). The perfo- ration was made from both sides of the bead, as the asymmet- rical shape of the biconical hole clearly shows. The bead is made of transparent orange material, probably carnelian. This material was widely used for jewelry and seal-stones from the very early periods throughout the ancient Near East, including the earliest Neolithic stratum at Ugarit, Stratum VC (de Contenson 1992: Fig. 125:13). Carnelian is a raw material commonly used for objects found in other Early Bronze Age assemblages in Israel, such as Strata III- I at Arad (Amiran 1978:55, Pis. 68-69) and the Early Bronze Age tombs at Bab edh-Dhra' (Schaub and Rast 1989:461-470). The source of the raw material might be Egypt or Sinai, where it is found in pebbles. It may also be found, on rare occasions, in the Negev. Parallels to this bead that can be attributed to Early Bronze Age contexts in Israel were not found. The shape is well known, however, at earlier sites in northern Syria and the upper Euphrates, where it is dated to the seventh-sixth millennia BCE. The closest parallel to the Tel Qashish bead was found at Tell Dahab, a site in the Amuq region in northern Syria (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960:62, Fig. 36:6, PL 70:8). It is attributed to phase A, or phase B at the latest, dated to the early sixth millennium BCE (Schwartz and Weiss 1992:226, Fig. 3). Beads of this type are found in other contemporary contexts, attributed to the Neolithic Pre- Halaf period. Noteworthy are a group of polished stone beads found in the Pottery Neolithic phase at Tell Abu- Hureyra (Moore 1975:68, Fig. 9:10-17) and two pendants found together with Halafian polychrome pottery at Tell Arpachiyah (Mallowan and Cruikshank-Rose 1935:95-96, Pl. VIb: A864, A865). "Butterfly" beads are also attributed to the earliest Neolithic strata (phases VC and VB) at Ras- Shamra, though the published alabaster example is dissim- ilar in shape to the above-cited parallels (de Contenson 1992: 197-198, Fig. 125: 12). The chronological range of this type of bead spans pre-Halafian and Halafian period contexts in northern Syria and upper Mesopotamia, and they are sometimes taken as one of the characteristics of the material culture of these contexts (Perkins 1949:36). It should be emphasized that all the examples discussed above are thousands of years earlier than the Tel Qashish bead, and a connection between their occurrences is impos- sible to establish. Similarly shaped beads have been reported at earlier Neolithic sites in the region, but the chronological gap is still too wide to bridge. Photo 70. Bead. 177</page><page sequence="218">CHAPTER 14 TEL QASHISH IN THE EARLY BRONZE AGE Sharon Zuckerman Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem The architectural features and ceramic assemblages of the various Early Bronze Age phases at the small site of Tel Qashish are important for several reasons: 1 . This is the only excavated site in the Jezreel Valley that shows a clear continuity of occupation from the EB IB through the EB II and well into the EB III. Tel Qashish is one of only a few sites in northern Israel that allows for a detailed analysis of the development of pottery types through most of the Early Bronze Age. This continuity enables an assessment of both the architectural and ceramic development of the period in northern Israel. 2. The ceramic assemblage of Tel Qashish exhibits all the characteristic aspects of the different phases of the period, including GBW in the EB IB and high proportions of metallic ware in the EB II strata. The total absence of KKW in the EB III strata at the site provides an opportunity to define the "local" indices of this period and to gain a better understanding of the gradual ceramic development of the Early Bronze Age phases. THE EARLY BRONZE AGE IB The EB IB settlement at Tel Qashish has no evidence of forti- fications, and probably occupied the largest area in the history of the occupation of the tel (Portugāli 1982: Table 2). The remains of the structures attributed to this period, however, do not allow for the reconstruction of a coherent plan of the settlement. These remains seem to represent free- standing one-roomed buildings spread haphazardly throughout the settlement, much like the situation at other sites of the period, such as Yiftahel (Braun 1997), 'En Shadud (Braun 1985), Asawir (E. Yannai, personal commu- nication), and Qiryat Ata (A. Golani, personal communica- tion). The apparent proximity of the buildings (Plan 3) might hint at a densely packed plan, a phenomenon also observed at other sites of the period (Braun 1996a:236) and a forerunner of the planned EB II fortified settlement at Tel Qashish. Regarding the architectural traditions reflected in the remains of the EB I buildings at Tel Qashish, the regional character of the RC building tradition and its origin on the Lebanese coast (Ben-Tor 1989) seem convincing, although the exact dynamics of this "influence" are far from clear (Joffe 1993:55). Once this tradition reached Canaan at the beginning of the EB IB, it became one of the "cultural conventions" determining the form of domestic architecture in the northern valleys. The EB IB ceramic assemblage from Tel Qashish includes mainly domestic types, and exhibits many regional characteristics and a close affinity with sites in the Jezreel Valley and its near vicinity. One special family is the GBW, which might have been produced at Tel Qashish itself or somewhere in the western Jezreel Valley (Goren 1991:131, Fig. 17:C; Goren and Zuckerman 2000). Goren shows that the distribution of his "basaltic inclusions" group focuses in and around Tel Qashish, which he interprets as reflecting the production of a small workshop manufacturing pottery for use within the site and its close vicinity. Thus, Tel Qashish might have played a central role within an otherwise undif- ferentiated society, at least with respect to GBW pottery production. Tel Qashish is located at an important junction of routes leading west and northwest into the Acco Valley and south- west into the Sharon Valley. The ceramic parallels from Asawir, Tel Megadim, and Qiryat Ata, showing typological affinities with the Tel Qashish assemblage, support the importance of its position. The pétrographie analysis of vessels from Asawir, which were shown to have originated in the western Jezreel Valley (Y. Goren and E. Yannai, personal communication) further strengthens this assump- tion. Connections also existed between Tel Qashish and sites in the Jordan Valley and the Samaria region to the east. As indicated by a number of the findings described above, Tel Qashish probably came within the cultural sphere of northern, possibly Lebanese, influence during the EB I. Tel Qashish is a typical village of the EB IB, similar to other contemporaneous sites in its vicinity (such as 'En Shadud). The site was economically self-sustaining, based mainly on agriculture. Its connections to other sites are few, except for the possible pottery distribution system mentioned above. The continuity of settlement at the site into the EB II was probably the result of its strategic location. THE EARLY BRONZE AGE II In the transition to the EB II, a major change occurs at Tel Qashish and probably also at other sites in the vicinity. The Tel Qashish settlement "shrinks" to encompass only the tel itself, while the area around it is no longer inhabited (Portugāli and Gophna 1993). The site itself is fortified and planned, two features that did not exist in the previous period. Remains of the fortification wall and buildings attrib- uted to this period were excavated in both areas of the tel. The EB II rebuilding activities provide an opportunity to examine the architectural tradition at the public level, not known in the EB I. At the beginning of Stratum XII, the 178</page><page sequence="219">TEL QASHISH IN THE EARLY BRONZE AGE construction of the fortification wall and other public works, like the assumed city gate and the "water reservoir," repre- sent what was probably the first cooperative building effort. Three types of domestic architecture existing side by side were found in Stratum XV: curvilinear, rectilinear, and RC buildings. In Stratum XII, all the domestic units basically share the same rectangular plan, with certain adjustments made as a result of the general layout of the site. The building plans were probably influenced by those in the larger cities that developed in this period. A certain difference exists between the architectural remains in Area A and Area B, a difference that might be attributed to social distinctions between the inhabitants of the "acropolis" and the lower part of the tel. No such distinction can be seen in the ceramic assem- blages or small finds from the two areas. Both Area A and Area B yielded a domestic repertoire, consisting mainly of platters, holemouth jars and storage jars. Examples of crudely-cut stone and basalt bowls are found in both areas (Figs. 45:30, 49: 10). Area B yielded one sherd of a possibly pedestalled basalt bowl (Fig. 41:7). Contributing to the conclusion of the daily nature of activities in both areas are the grinding stones found on the floors of Stratum XIIC in Area A (Fig. 54:9-10), as well as the loomweights and spindle whorls found in both areas (Figs. 32:6, 37:15, 50:8, 16-17). A highly polished rounded basalt stone, probably part of a potter's wheel (Fig. 41:5), was found in the main building of Area B in Stratum XIIA. A similar stone was found at Tel Dalit (Pelta 1996). This find possibly attests to the production of pottery at the site, probably at a household level to supply the village inhabitants' immediate needs. No luxury items from the Early Bronze Age strata were found, except for one carnelian bead in Area B (Fig. 27: 1 1 ; Photo 70 [see Chapter 14]) and the decorated bone in Area A (Figs. 59:3, 75; Photo 69 [Chapter 12]). The large number of cylinder-seal impressions on metallic storage jars point to the possible role of Tel Qashish within an Early Bronze Age regional economic system (Chapter 10). In terms of its ceramic assemblage, Tel Qashish is an integral part of the larger picture of northern Israel, and of an active system of pottery distribution. Metallic ware, typical of this area and possibly originating from one or more production centers in the Mt. Hermon foothills (Chapters 9 and 1 1 ; Greenberg and Porat 1996), constitutes around 50% of the repertoire (excluding holemouth jars and jars made of coarse cooking-pot ware). Similar proportions also charac- terize other sites, such as Qiryat Ata (A. Golani, personal communication). These are at the very edge of the wide range of sites at which metallic vessels were found in signifi- cant quantities. The relatively large number of cylinder-seal impressions on metallic storage jars found at Tel Qashish apparently complements this picture (but see Chapter 10 for a different view). This should be seen within the framework of the general similarity observed in the architectural features characterizing the earliest phases of the fortified settlement at Tel Qashish and other sites dated to the EB II. These observations accord with the reconstruction of a large political entity in most of northern Israel during this period, suggested by Greenberg and Porat on the basis of the distri- bution of metallic pottery (1996). The development of Early Bronze Age pottery at Tel Qashish, as well as that in northern Israel in general, is gradual. Most types have a long time-span, and in the absence of such indices as KKW, the transition from the EB II to the EB III is difficult to pinpoint. The detailed study of the Tel Qashish EB II- III assemblage (see Chapter 8) enabled the formulation of a stratigraphie sequence, the dating of which is based on the analysis of the local types. Most of the pottery types appear throughout the sequence, with only minor changes. These include simple bowls of Types B I (Fig. 62:1-2) and B III (Fig. 62:4), platters with a triangular rim of Type PL la (Fig. 64:1), most types of holemouth jars (Fig. 66), and storage jars of Types SJ la (Fig. 68:1-2) and SJ IIa (Fig. 68:6). Some of the types, however, can be regarded as indices for either the EB II or EB III sub-periods. These are defined in the pottery discus- sion (see pp. 142-143), mainly on the basis of parallels from other sites. THE EB II CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE Strata XIIC and XIIB in Area B and Strata XIIE-XIIC in Area A can be attributed to the EB II. Their ceramic reper- toire is characterized by the predominance of metallic ware bowls, platters, and storage jars. Especially significant is the appearance of the metallic platters. These constitute more than half the platter repertoire in the earlier phases and diminish in number in the later phases, disappearing alto- gether in Stratum XIIA in Area A. The reverse applies to the red-slipped vessels, which are relatively rare in the earlier phases and increase in number in the later phases. These characteristics are similar to those observed by Greenberg in the "Early Assemblage" at Tel Dan, dated to the EB II (1996a:99-103). An important feature of the EB II, the "Red-on- White" painted ware ("Abydos Ware"), is absent at Tel Qashish in its common form, appearing only in its "White-on-Red" variant (Fig. 35:7). This variant is not as firmly dated as the common type, which is found in First and Second Dynasty contexts in Egypt (Kantor 1965; Amiran 1974; Esse 1991). "White on EB II Pottery Types Type Area B Area A Carinated bowls Type BVIId XIIB-XIIA XIID-XIIC _I Incised bowls Type B IX XIIC-XIIA XIIC Metallic platters Type PL II XIIC-XIIA XIIE-XIIC Metallic platters, all types XIIC-XIIA XIIE-XIIB Holemouth jars Type H IV XIIC-XIIA XIIE J 179</page><page sequence="220">CHAPTER 14 Red" amphoriskoi were found together with typical EB II carinated bowls (Type B VII) at sites like Tel Teo in the Hula Valley (Greenberg 1996a: 135). THE EARLY BRONZE AGE III The transition to the EB III at Tel Qashish was gradual and peaceful, without major architectural changes or sharp breaks in the development of the ceramic assemblage. The main changes in the fortification system are the blocking of the drainage channel in the fortification wall and possibly the construction of the massive parallel wall parallel to its east. Apart from this wall, none of the major buttressing so typical of EB III sites, e.g., at Taanach, Yarmouth, 'Ai, and Zeraqun, was found at Tel Qashish (see also discussion on architec- ture, Chapter 7). The architectural changes within the site are minor, mainly the enlargement of rooms and the addition of installations. Nothing in the material remains at the site reflects the "serious.. .real upheaval" that is suggested to have taken place in the Jezreel Valley and northern Palestine in the transition between the EB II and EB III (Finkelstein 1995:59-62). The local ceramic repertoire continues to develop gradu- ally and red-slipped and pattern-burnished types, paralleled mainly in EB III contexts, supplant the metallic types. This process has also been observed at other sites of the period (Esse 1982; Greenberg 1987). In this context, the absence of KKW, an indicator of the beginning of the EB III in northern Palestine, is noteworthy (see below). THE EB III CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE Stratum XIIA in Area B and Strata XIIB-XIIA and XI in Area A should be attributed to the EB III. These strata are characterized by a decline in the percentage of metallic ware platters and some types of bowls. Only storage jars andpithoi are still made of metallic ware and remain unslipped. This is coupled with a gradual increase in the appearance of red- slipped platters, in most cases made of lighter, coarser material than that characteristic of vessels from the earlier phases. Greenberg observed a similar phenomenon at Hazor, where, together with the appearance of KKW, there is a decline in the percentage of metallic vessels and an increase in the number of red-slipped vessels (1996a: 105). He suggests a connection between this tendency and the appear- ance of the KKW vessels, known for their coarse ware and low firing temperature (1987:130). Another feature characterizing the EB III assemblage is the pattern-burnished vessels, mostly large platters, but also juglets and jugs. A similar phenomenon was observed at Megiddo Phase J-6 (Joffe 2000:174-181), in the Tel Dan "Late Assemblage" (Greenberg 1996a: 103-1 05), and at Tel Yarmouth (London 1988:122-124). One important feature notably lacking in the Tel Qashish EB III assemblage is the KKW family. Although the amount of KKW thus far found in the Jezreel Valley is rather small (Hennessy 1967:74-76; Esse 1991:172), its absence at Tel Qashish, in view of the relatively extensive excavated area, cannot be coincidental. The few KKW sherds that were found in the small trial trench at neighboring Tel Yoqne'am are significant (Zuckerman in press). Since GE. Wright's seminal study of Early Bronze Age pottery, the appearance of KKW is considered the marker of the beginning of the EB III in Palestine (1937:72-78). Various scholars have dealt with the KKW family, investi- gating its technological properties, spatial distribution, chro- nology, and importance for the study of foreign relations (Hennessey 1967:74-79; Amiran 1969; Todd 1973; Esse and Hopke 1986; Esse 1991:137-140; Philip 1999; Greenberg 2001). The nature of the KKW assemblage, comprising mainly serving and possibly cooking vessels, led to an acceptance of its "ethnic" identification, supporting a "pots to people" argument (Esse 1991:138-140; Bunimovitz and Yasur-Landau 1996:90-91). The boundaries of its distribu- tion are well known. It is especially common in the northern Jordan Valley and the eastern Jezreel Valley (Hennessy 1967: PI. LXII; Esse 1991 : 139, Fig. 25), with 'Afilla and Tel Kishion forming the western boundary of its distribution. Sites in the Acco Valley and the Galilee lack this ware (Givon 1993:52-53), the only exception being Tel Regev (Esse 1991 : Table 4). Recently, however, a few KKW sherds were found at Tel Yoqne'am, together with a ceramic assemblage that is clearly attributable to the EB III, most of which has parallels in the Tel Qashish EB III assemblage, especially in Stratum XIIA in Area A (Zuckerman in press). It is note- worthy that KKW was found in an Early Bronze Age context at Tel Yoqne'am, only 2 km away from Tel Qashish, but was not found at the latter site. As mentioned above, the absence of KKW at Tel Qashish is most unlikely to be random, espe- cially considering the wide exposure of the Early Bronze Age settlement at the site compared to the limited exposure of Early Bronze Age remains at Yoqne'am. There are two possible explanations for this phenomenon. 1 . The chronological explanation. The existence of a "pre- KKW" phase within the EB III has recently been suggested based on the results of a salvage excavation at Beth Yerah EB III Pottery Types Type Area B Area A Platters Type PL Ic XIIA XIID-XIIA Platters Type PL Id XIIA XIID-XIIA Platters Type PL IV - XIIA Kraters Type K II - XIIE-XIIA Storage jars Type SJ lie XIIA XIID-XIIA ^Metallic sherds Type SJ III I XIIA I XIID-XIIA 180</page><page sequence="221">TEL QASHISH IN THE EARLY BRONZE AGE (N. Getzov, personal communication). The lack of published material from this suggested "new" EB III phase, however, prevents an assessment of its nature. The fact that no such phase has been observed at any other sites of the period (with the possible exception of Tel Beth-Shean [A. Mazar et al. 2000]) and the limited area in which it was exposed at Beth Yerah necessitates further study and analysis. The evidence from Tel Qashish does not seem to corroborate the existence of such a phase, since there is no hiatus in the settlement of the site between the EB II and the EB III ( contra Finkelstein 1998:168). The pottery from Tel Qashish was dated on the basis of parallels from other sites in northern Palestine. The most significant are Tel Dan in the northern Hula Valley and Beth Yerah on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. The Early Bronze Age assemblages from both sites have been published, and the presence of "Light-Faced Painted Ware" and KKW pottery assigns their local assemblages to the EB II and EB III, respectively. The EB III assemblage from Beth Yerah is rich in KKW and all the components of its repertoire are represented (Esse 1991: Table 4). Although KKW is entirely absent at Tel Qashish, most of the "local" pottery types accompanying the KKW vessels at Beth Yerah (Ibid.:48-53) are represented. These include small hemispherical buff ware red-slipped bowls, buff ware red-slipped platters, platters with a concavity below the rim exterior, twin vessels, squared-off rim holemouth jars, and flared rim jars. The "Late Assemblage" from Tel Dan is securely dated to the EB III (Greenberg 1996a: 103-105). Most of the types attributed to this assemblage were also found in Stratum XIIA at Tel Qashish. These include non-metallic red-slipped bowls, non-metallic thick platters that are often red-slipped and pattern-burnished, and metallic pithoi with sharply everted rims and ledge handles. An important feature of the Tel Dan "Late Assemblage" that is also very prominent in the later phase at Tel Qashish is the marked predominance of red-slipped low-fired ware over metallic ware (not a single metallic bowl or platter was attributable to this stratum in Area A). This is in sharp contrast to the EB II assemblage, which contains an abundance of metallic vessels (over 50% of the platter repertoire of Strata XIID-XIIC). Also notable is the wide geographic range of parallels for the types found in the later phases at Tel Qashish, the phenomenon of "blurring the boundaries" characteristic of the EB III (Greenberg 1996a: 137). The decorated bone tube from Tel Qashish belongs to a family found at other sites in Palestine, usually in connection with KKW, securely dated to the EB III (Chapter 12; Zarzecki-Peleg 1993). This find further supports the EB III dating of Tel Qashish Stratum XIIA. The Tel Qashish Stratum XIIA assemblage should thus be dated to the "KKW phase" of the EB III, on the basis of ceramic parallels with other sites in northern Palestine. It appears, therefore, that the absence of KKW at Tel Qashish should not be explained chronologically. 2. The differential distribution/regional explanation. The differential distribution of pottery is known in both the archaeological and the ethnographic record (Hodder 1982; Wood 1990). The reasons for this differentiation vary from geographical boundaries through economic and political conditions to cultural distinctions. As can be seen in the case of EB II metallic ware, vessels could have been transported over long distances, more than 100 km, even to small villages like Tel Qashish and Qiryat Ata (Greenberg and Porat 1996; but see Chapter 10 for a different view). What, then, happened during the EB III? The KKW family is considered unique in the Early Bronze Age ceramic repertoire of northern Israel. Its special forms and distinct appearance are very different from the local repertoire and were seldom imitated in local forms (A. Mazar et al. 2000). These vessels constitute a large part (from 20% to 60%) of the assemblages at some sites, especially in their production centers at Hazor, Beth-Shean, and Beth Yerah (Esse and Hopke 1986:332; Stager 1992:39; Greenberg 2000; A. Mazar et al. 2000), but are absent at other sites in the vicinity, such as Tel Kinnerot (Fritz 1990:19-24), Beth ha- 'Emeq (Givon 1993), and Tel Qashish. The distribution of this ware thus seems to have been limited to some sites, while others lack it altogether. This differential distribution and the variety of KKW types are regarded by Esse as ". . .good indicators that there were Khirbet Kerak folk living at these sites..." (1991:139 [emphasis mine]). The same diversity is interpreted differ- ently by Philip, who prefers to explain it as representing distinct social groups, rather than a specific homogenous ethnic group (1999:42-43, 49-51). Much like special tribal pottery shapes, KKW vessels may carry information on group identity and the collective desires of its members (Hodder 1982:37-57). Paraphrasing Hodder's assessment, owning a KKW-type pot is part and parcel of being "KKW folk" (Ibid.:44). The ubiquitous shapes and colors of KKW vessels are important as a visible marker of its social signifi- cance. Within the fragmented society of the EB III, which was divided between large competing cities, each distinct group, like the KKW-users, probably needed these (and other) material indicators to enhance group identity (Hodder 1979; Greenberg 2000). Others, even their close neighbors, might have shown less interest, if any, in these crudely made task- specific vessels, continuing instead to use the local repertoire of red-slipped vessels, holemouth jars, and metallic storage jars. The inhabitants of Tel Qashish and Tel Yoqne'am, although geographically very close to one another, could represent these two groups. The settlement at Tel Qashish apparently did not continue to exist until the very end of the EB III and was abandoned some time earlier. The site evidently was not violently destroyed; there are no signs of destruction accompanying the end of Stratum XII. A possible explanation might be the movement of the settlement's inhabitants to nearby Tel Yoqne'am, seeking the defense offered by this strategically located site, on a high hill controlling the western entrance to the Jezreel Valley. The disappearance of small EB III villages and the continuing agglomeration of their inhabitants into larger, heavily fortified sites might be attributed to the unstable conditions characterizing this period. Among the possible reasons suggested for this process are the deterio- rating political situation that created tension between competing cities, the over-exploitation of land and other 181</page><page sequence="222">CHAPTER 14 resources and the cessation of economic relations with Egypt at the end of the EB II (Esse 1989b). Tel Qashish, like many other small villages in northern Israel, was probably affected by these conditions during the EB III. Later remains from Stratum XI at Tel Qashish point to the existence of an unfortified settlement with smaller buildings. As indicated in the pottery discussion, this stratum is difficult to date. Whether it belongs to a later phase of the EB III or the Middle Bronze Age II, it reflects a transitional period between two urban phases at the site.

These floors preceded the earliest Middle Bronze Age structures of Stratum IX (Photos 71-72). The floors are L. 316+321, L. 320 (Figs. 76-77; Photos 73-74) and L. 468. These floors continue under the earliest Middle Bronze Age walls (Photo 72), i.e., W. 43, forming part of the tower, and W. 53, 60, 63 and 249, all of Plan 24.

Structures of Stratum IX and trial trench. which belong to Stratum IXC dwellings (see Sections D-D' and E-E' in Square X/15 [P. 192]; Photos 72, 79). The possi- bility that Stratum X in fact only represents a technical phase within Stratum IXC should be borne in mind (see below). The nature of Stratum X, with clearly defined floors made of gravel and/or crushed chalk, is unclear. There may be walls beyond the excavated area with which these floors are associated. It should be noted that to the east and west of these floors, Early Bronze Age remains were found immedi- ately below the earliest phase of Stratum IX (i.e., IXC), with no earlier Middle Bronze Age floor in between (Sections D-D' and E-E' in Square X/15; Photos 52, 77, 79). Thus, it appears that the Stratum X phase of the floors is confined to Squares W-X/15. THE CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE (Figs. 76-77) The discussion of the pottery characteristic of Strata X-VI is based on the typological classification for the Middle Bronze and Late Bronze Age assemblages presented in Chapter 16. 186</page><page sequence="226">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A Photo 73. Storage jar and lamp (?) from Stratum X (L. 3 16+L. 32 1 ; Fig. 76:6-7). Bowls Open bowls (B) The two open bowls attributed to Stratum X belong to Type B IVb. Type B IVb: Inverted cut rim (Figs. 76:11; 77:1). These bowls are common in the ceramic assemblage of Tel Qashish. They occur first in Stratum X and last in Stratum VIII. Similar bowls appear in assemblages attributed to the MB IIA at Tel Zeror and Aphek (Palace Phase A IVa+b), as well as at Megiddo in assemblages apparently belonging to the end of the MB ILA (T. 5 1 04) and to the MB IIB (T. 2 1 35, T. 2142). Closed carinated bowls (CB) All the carinated bowls from Stratum X are of closed Types CB I and CB IV. Type CB I: Gutter rim with sharp carination (Figs. 77:3-4). These first appear at Tel Qashish in Stratum X. Their main occurrence is in Stratum IXC, and, except for a single sherd attributed to Stratum IXB, cease to appear there- after. Similar bowls are found in assemblages attributed to the MB IIA at Megiddo (T. 5178), Tel Poleg, and Aphek (where they occur from the beginning of the MB ILA through the Post-Palace Phase). Type CB IV: Rounded rim and globular body (Fig. 77:2). One example was found on a Stratum X floor. Apart from the single bowl from Stratum XII at Mevorakh, parallels come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIA. In the discussion of the Mevorakh example, it is noted that bowls of this type are characteristic of the MB IIA in general, Photo 74. Storage jar from Stratum X (L. 320; Fig. 77:8) (note chipped upper part). and that the bowl from Mevorakh XII is an exception {Mevorakh 11:55). The parallels from the tomb assemblages at Megiddo conform to this dating. All three tombs yielded open bowls with a "ring rim" characteristic of the MB IIA {Megiddo II: Pis. 9:2, 14:2) and red-slipped and burnished jugs with a gutter rim {Megiddo II: Pis. 7:15, 10:10-11). Cooking Pots Globular cooking pots (GCP) The cooking pot rim found on a Stratum X floor belongs to Type GCP lb and the GCP la rim was found in a fill above a Stratum X floor level. The latter type mainly appears in Stratum IXC but continues into Stratum IXB. It is possible that its occurrence in Stratum VIII is fortuitous and that it originates in earlier strata. Type GCP lb: Thickened gutter rim (Fig. 76:2). This type occurs from Stratum X through Stratum IXB. A similar cooking pot was found at Tel Poleg in an assemblage attrib- uted to the MB IIA. Jugs (J) The rims of the Stratum X jugs belong to Types J Ha and JIVa. Type J IIa: Simple triangular rim (Fig. 76:3). The type occurs at Tel Qashish from Stratum X through Stratum VIIA (the example found in an assemblage attributed to Stratum V has a thicker rim). Type J IVa: Thin and elongated folded rim (Fig. 77:5). The example found in Stratum X is well fired. Jugs of this type appear at Tel Qashish only in Strata X and IXB. 187</page><page sequence="227">CHAPTER 15 Fig. 76. Stratum X: L. 316+ L. 321. No. Object Type Reg.

The rim of the storagejar depicted in Fig. 77:8 is missing, and the upper part of the vessel had been chipped. As both storage jars have flat bases and strap handles, it seems plausible to ascribe them to the MB IIA. The shoulder of the storage jar depicted in Fig. 76:6 is decorated with three combed bands. The storage jar rims from Stratum X belong to Types SJ IIa and SJ IVa. The former (Fig. 76:4-5) were classified as storage jars of Type SJ Ha, even though they could also be identified as amphoriskoi without handles, such as the example found at Aphek (P. Beck 1975:58). 188 Type SJ Ha: Folded rim with inner gutter (Figs. 76:4-5; 77:6). Folded storage jar rims with a gutter were found in Strata X, IXB, and IXA. Similar storage jars are known from assemblages attributed to the MB IIA, and not later. Pithoi (P) Stratum X produced only one pithos rim, belonging to Type P Illb (Fig. 77:9). Such pithoi were found at Tel Qashish in assemblages attributed to Strata X and IXA. A similar pithos was found in Tomb 490 at Aphek, dated to the MB IIA.</page><page sequence="228">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A 7ig. 77.

Summary: Stratum X The excavations at Tel Qashish reached the Stratum X remains in only a very limited area. The ceramic assemblage attributed to this phase, therefore, is small compared to those of the later strata. The Stratum X settlement was exposed directly above the Early Bronze Age remains. It seems, however, that it should not be attributed to the beginning of the MB IIA, a phase in which the pottery is not red-slipped or burnished, as repre- sented, for example, at Aphek (P. Beck 1985b: 181- 190, 194), Tell el-Hayyat (Falconer and Magness-Gardiner 1984), and Gesher (Garfinkel and Bonfil 1990:144-146). It is lacking at nearby Yoqne'am, Tel Qiri, and Megiddo. The subsequent MB IIA phase is characterized by an abundance of red-slipped and burnished vessels (P. Beck 1985b: 194-1 96; Garfinkel and Bonfil 1990:144-146), and the founding of the MB II settlements at neighboring Yoqne'am and Megiddo Stratum XIIA is dated to this phase. It cannot be ascertained, however, whether the construction of Stratum X at Tel Qashish also belongs to this phase, or whether it should be assigned to the last phase of the MB IIA. Most of the vessel types found in Stratum X continue to appear thereafter, mainly in the Stratum IXC-IXB assem- blages (open bowls of Type B IVb, closed carinated bowls of Type CB I, globular cooking pots of Type GCP lb, and storage jars of Types SJ IIa and SJ IVa). The pithoi of Type P Illb, one example of which was found in Stratum X, continue into Stratum IXA. The remaining types of vessels had a longer lifespan. Parallels for the Stratum X vessels come from assem- blages attributed to the MB IIA and MB IIB. It is noteworthy that every vessel that has parallels in MB IIB assemblages also has parallels in those of the MB IIA. Thus, it seems that Stratum X should be dated to the end of the MB IIA. STRATUM IX This stratum, with three phases, represents the MB II settle- ment at Tel Qashish, which appears to have been confined to the western, higher, part of the site. These remains were excavated in an area of almost 150 m2, which slopes to the east and to the north (Plan 1 ; Photos 2-4). As a result of this natural incline, the northern and eastern parts of the exca- vated area were severely eroded. The three phases of Stratum IX are distinguished by the raising of floors and other minor architectural changes. These changes, however, are of minimal significance and there is no substantive change in plan throughout the period. It may well be that while floors were raised in some loci some, other adjacent loci remained unchanged. All this points to the conclusion that the time-span represented by these three phases is relatively short, a conclusion corrobo- rated by the ceramic assemblage, which remains more or less uniform throughout Stratum IX. STRATUM IXC STRATIGRAPHY (Plans 24-25) The fortification system and the basic plan of the dwellings were established during this phase (Photo 75). The fortifica- tion wall (W. 20) is 1 .7 m thick, built of average-sized field stones, and preserved to a height of 1 .4 m. A modestly sized glacis was built against the outer face of the wall (Section C-C' in Square U/l 5; Plan 32 [P. 23 1]; Photo 76). The glacis is made out of small stones and crushed stones mixed with earth, laid on an earth foundation. It slopes at an angle of 45°, and its upper surface was not preserved due to erosion. The tower has a rectangular plan, 5. 5*4.5 m. Its northern outer face had collapsed down the slope (Photo 3), so that while it clearly projects 2.5 m inwards toward the inside of the settlement, it is impossible to determine whether it projected outwards and, if so, to what extent. It is noteworthy that in the fortifications dated to the same period excavated at the nearby site of Yoqne'am, the tower projects only inwards, while its outer face (which was eroded) was most probably flush with the outer face of the city wall. A similar reconstruction is proposed for the Tel Qashish tower. The tower comprises an almost solid mass of rough field stones with a small rectangular cell, 1.8x0.7 m, almost at its center (W. 43 and W. 47; Photo 75). Neither floor within nor entrance into this space were discerned, which may suggest that its function was solely constructional. The northeastern corner of the tower, as well as the fortifications to the east of the tower, with the exception of a short 1.5 m long segment of the inner face of the fortification wall (W. 242) had collapsed down the slope. If the width of W. 242 is reconstructed as the same as that of the wall in Squares V-W/14-15 (Plans 24-25), it would appear that the north- eastern corner of the tower projected 1.5 m from the outer face of the wall. Plan 25. Area A: Reconstruction of Stratum IXC. It should be noted that a clearly discernible white plaster floor associated with the inner face of the wall, L. 343, seems to be cut by the tower wall W. 42. If this is indeed the case, it would appear that the wall was built first and the tower was added later and incorporated into the wall; a "seam" at both the eastern and western joins of the tower and the walls supports this conclusion. If this was indeed the sequence of events, it is possible that the floors attributed to Stratum X actually belong to the construction phase of the fortification wall, which would explain why these floors are not associ- ated with the walls of the tower added later. In that case, it 190</page><page sequence="230">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A Photo 75.

Was only the western, higher part of the site forti- fied? If so, the wall must have turned sharply to the south at a distance of approximately 7 m from the eastern edge of the tower (see broken line on Plan 25), perhaps with a gateway leading into street L. 317B (Photos 3, 77). The other possi- bility is that the fortification system also incorporated the lower, eastern part of the site, where only a few Middle Bronze Age remains were found (see below). Walls 29B, 45, 53, 61, and 60, and the walls connected to them, abut the fortification system (Sections D-D' and E-E' in Square X/15; Photos 77-79). These walls, approximately 0.4-0.5 m thick, clearly belong to dwellings. No isolated units can be discerned, and the entire complex seems to be agglutinative. The floors are made of beaten earth and finds are of a domestic nature. The only installations found are two storage jars and a pithos sunk into the floor of L. 81B (Fig. 78:18-20; Photos 80-81), and a tabun (clay oven) in the corner of L. 313 (Photo 79). Loci 81B and 353 are connected by a very wide doorway formed by the two pilas- ters of W. 29B (Photo 86). The connection between L. 353 and L. 343 to its east is unclear.

Two entrances connect the dwellings and the street to the south: from L. 313 through an opening in W. 76, and from L. 464 through an opening in W. 1 8. W. 249, bordering L. 464 on the north, forms a corner with W. 53, but also with W. 63, which, in turn, forms a corner with W. 16 (see Plan 26). The nature of the area to the east of W. 63 is unclear, and in order to allow for access, a doorway in W. 18, connecting it with the street, must be reconstructed. An opening in W. 52 connects L. 3 1 3 with the room to the north (L. 233). The oven in L. 3 1 3 indicates that it must have been an unroofed area in front of room L. 233. It should be noted that L. 233 and L. 237 were combined, as the difference between them is insignificant. Fragments belonging to the same vessels were recovered from these two loci (Fig. 81:1-12 and 13-23, respectively). The street L. 3 17B, made of beaten earth paved with small stones, is rather rough and irregular (Photos 77-79). It slopes gently eastwards, following the topography of the site. THE CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE (Figs. 78-81) Bowls Open bowls (B) The open bowls found in Stratum IXC belong to Types B IVa, B IVb, B Vc, and B Via. Type B IVa: Simple cut rim (Fig. 81:1). Bowls of this type first occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXC and continue into Stratum VI. In Stratum VII, they comprise the most common type. In Stratum IXC, these bowls are not red- slipped. Similar bowls were found in MB IIA assemblages at Mevorakh Stratum XIV, corresponding to the Palace Phase at Aphek {Mevorakh 11:57). Parallels also come from an assemblage attributed to the beginning of the MB IIB at Megiddo (T. 3 125), as well as from the Middle Bronze Age assemblages, the exact dating of which cannot be deter- mined, at Megiddo (= T. 3093) and Tel Qiri. Type B IVb: Inverted cut rim (Figs. 79:7, 11; 81:2-3). This type occurs both with and without decoration in red paint and burnish. It first appears in Stratum X and last in Stratum VIII, peaking in Stratum IXB. Parallels come from Megiddo in assemblages attributed to the MB IIA (T. 4088) and MB IIB (T. 2135, T. 2140, T. 2142, T. 3145, T. 4022, T. 4054, T. 4099, T. 5067, T. 5267). Type B Vc: Rounded everted rim, cross-decorated (Fig. 78: 1). Cross-decorated bowls first occur in the MB IIA and continue into the MB IIB. A similar bowl from Mevorakh, decorated with the same pattern, was attributed to Stratum XIII ( Mevorakh 11:56-57). A tomb at Barqai produced another type of bowl decorated with the same pattern (Gophna and Sussman 1969: Fig. 6:10). Type B Via: Simple rim (Fig. 81:13). These small bowls first occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXC. Similar vessels were found in an assemblage attributed to the MB IIA at Yavneh-Yam (Gophna and Beck 198 1 :64); in an assemblage spanning the MB IIA to Iron I at Megiddo (T. 9 1 1 A); and in assemblages attributed to the MB IIB at Mevorakh ( Mevorakh 11:5). 194</page><page sequence="234">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A Photo 82.

With the exception of Type CB I, the first appearance of all these types is in Stratum IXC. Type CB I: Gutter-rimmed with sharp carination (Fig. 81 :4, 14). This type mainly occurs in Stratum IXC, and is represented by only one sherd in Stratum IXB. Similar bowls were found at Jericho in assemblages both attributed specifically to the early MB IIB and to the MB IIB in general. 200 Type CB II: Simple everted rim (Figs. 79: 1 , 8-10; 80: 1). Some ofthese bowls are red-slipped (Fig. 79:1, 10)andsome unslipped (Figs. 79:8-9; 80:1). This type first occurs in Stratum IXC, peaks in Stratum IXB, and is absent in Stratum IXA. The CB II fragments found in Stratum VIII and in a fill attributed to Stratum VIIA are intrusive. Similar bowls were found in assemblages dated to the MB IIA at Megiddo (T. 3155, T. 5114, T. 5130), Tel Burga, and Aphek. Type CB III: Triangular rim and sharp carination</page><page sequence="240">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A (Figs. 80:2; 81:5). These bowls are red-slipped and burnished. They occur at Tel Qashish only in Strata IXC and IXB. Parallels come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIA at Megiddo (T. 5114) and Tel Burga, and from an assemblage attributed to the MB IIA-MB IIB transitional period at Megiddo (T. 3104). Type CB Va: Simple everted rim (Fig. 78:2). This type occurs at Tel Qashish in Strata IXC and IXB. A similar bowl was found at Megiddo in an MB II assemblage, the exact date of which is difficult to determine (T. 3076). Type CB Via: Slightly carinated with no ridge at the base of the neck (Fig. 78:5; Photos 82:d, 83). CB Via bowls appear in assemblages attributed to Strata IXC and IXB. No exact parallel was found for the decorated bowl from Stratum IXC. A similar bowl, but larger, decorated with a red geometric pattern, was found at Jericho in an assemblage attributed to the beginning of the MB IIB. Type CB VIb: Slightly carinated with a ridge at the base of the neck (Fig. 78:3; Photos 82:e, 84). No exact paral- lels were found. Cooking Pots Most of the cooking pots found in Stratum IXC are of the globular type, with some examples of the straight-sided type. Globular cooking pots (GCP) The globular cooking pots in the Stratum IXC assemblages belong to Types GCP la, GCP lb, GCP II, GCP III, GCP IV, and GCP V. Type GCP la: Simple gutter rim (Figs. 79: 1 2; 8 1 : 1-1 8). This type occurs at Tel Qashish mainly in Stratum IXC, after which it appears only in fills attributed to Strata IXB and VIII. It is therefore possible that the type belongs exclusively to Stratum IXC, and its occurrence in the later assemblages is intrusive. Parallels come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIA at Tel Poleg; an assemblage apparently belonging to the MB IIB at Beth-Shean; and to assemblages that are diffi- cult to date at Tel Qiri and from inside the ramparts at Tel Michal. TType GCP lb: Thickened gutter rim (Figs. 78:6; 80:3). This type already occurs in Stratum X and continues through Stratum IXB. A similar cooking pot was found in an MB IIA assemblage at Tel Poleg. Type GCP II: Square rim (Fig. 78:10). The type first occurs at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXC, peaks in Stratum IXB, and continues through Stratum VIII. Type GCP III: Folded triangular rim (Figs. 78:7-8; 79:3; 81:9). The type occurs with high frequency in Strata IXC and IXB. Strata IXA and VIII each yielded only a single rim of this type. The cooking pot depicted in Fig. 79:3 is decorated with a plastic band on the body. The band is incised with a herringbone design, a common decoration on closed cooking pots of the middle and end of the MB II (Maeir 1997:104). Parallels come from assemblages attrib- uted to the MB IIA at Tel Poleg and at Aphek. At Megiddo, examples were found in Tomb 3 1 09, which can be attributed to the beginning of the MB IIB (and perhaps the end of the MB IIA). Another cooking pot of this type was found in an MB IIB assemblage at Mevorakh. Type GCP IV: Triangular rim (Fig. 79:17). Only one rim of this type was found at Tel Qashish, in the fill of a Stratum IXC floor. Type GCP V: Vertical rim (Fig. 78:11). This type was found exclusively in Stratum IXC. A similar, but smaller, cooking pot was found at Megiddo in an assemblage of inde- terminate date (S=2032). Upright-walled cooking pots (UCP) Cooking pots of the upright-walled type were found mainly in assemblages attributed to Stratum IXC. Most belong to Type UCP la, with one example of Type UCP II. Type UCP la: Upright-walled, decorated with a plastic band (Figs. 79:2; 8 1 : 1 6). Apart from one rim found beneath a Stratum IXB floor, this type occurs at Tel Qashish only in Stratum IXC. Parallels come from MB IIA assemblages at Tel Zeror and the beginning of the MB IIB at Jericho. Type UCP II: Simple square inverted rim (Fig. 81:8). One example was found in Stratum IXC (in L. 233). Cooking pots of this type with plastic decoration were found in an MB ILA assemblage at Tel Poleg, and in an assemblage of indeterminate date at Beth-Shean. Open cooking pots (CP) The cooking pot depicted in Fig. 79:13 was classified as Type CP Illb. Apart from this vessel, the first appearance of open cooking pots of Type CP III is in Stratum VIII. It there- fore cannot be determined whether this example found in L. 343 belongs to Stratum IXC or whether it is intrusive. Juglets Only a very limited number of juglets are attributed to Stratum IXC. Piriform Juglets (PJT) The button base (Fig. 79:15) belongs to this group. Dipper Juglets (DJT) Dipper juglets of Type DJT (Fig. 79:14) first occur in Stratum IXC and continue through Stratum VILA. Jugs (J) The jug rims in the Stratum IXC assemblages belong to Types J IIa, J lib, and J IVb. Type J Ha: Simple triangular rim (Fig. 79:4; 80:5). The rims attributed to this type could belong either to jugs with shoulder handles or to amphoriskoi. The type first occurs in Stratum X and continues through Stratum VILA. Similar rims were found in an MB IIA assemblage at Aphek and an MB IIB assemblage at Megiddo (T. 3122). Type J lib: Modelled triangular rim (Fig. 78:13). This type was found only in Str IXC. Ajug with a shoulder handle and a similar rim was found at Megiddo in an assemblage dated to the MB IIB in general, through the end of the MB IIB period (T. 3085). Type J IVb: Thin and short folded rim. A rim of this type was found in the make-up of a Stratum IXC floor. The type is already known in Stratum X. Storage Jars (SJ) Stratum IXC produced two almost complete storage jars, 201</page><page sequence="241">CHAPTER 15 both lacking rims, in L. 81B (Fig. 78: 18-19; Photo 82:a-b). The neck of the storage jar depicted in Fig. 78: 19 had been chipped. The storage jar rims found in Stratum IXC belong to Types SJ lib, SJ IVa, SJ IVc, and SJ V. The most common storage jars in this stratum are Types SJ lib and SJ IVa. Type S J lib: Simple folded rim (Fig. 81:21). This type occurs at Tel Qashish from Stratum IXC through Stratum IXA. The SJ lib rim found in Stratum V is intrusive. Similar rims were found at Aphek in the phases preceding the construction of the palace (Aphek A VII, AVI). The excava- tors note that this type is characteristic exclusively of the Pre- Palace phase (P. Beck 1975:53). Type SJ IVa: Ridge at base of simple folded rim (Fig. 78:14). The type occurs at Tel Qashish mainly in Stratum IXC, first appearing in an assemblage from beneath a Stratum X floor. Parallels come from MB IIA assemblages at Aphek, Tel Burga, Tel Zeror, north of Habonim, and Revadim. Type SJ IVc: Ridge at base of gutter rim (Fig. 81:19). This type occurs exclusively in Stratum IXC (the rim found in Stratum VIIA is intrusive). Parallels come from MB IIA assemblages at Tel Poleg, Tel Zeror, and the Palace Phase (A IVB) at Aphek, and from the MB IIB Post-Palace Phase (A II) assemblage at Aphek. Type SJ V: Folded and inturned rim (Figs. 78:15; 81:10). The type occurs at Tel Qashish in Strata IXC-IXA. Similar rims were found in MB IIA assemblages at Tel Poleg and Aphek. Pithoi (P) Stratum IXC produced one complete pithos (Fig. 78:20) and several rims belongings to Types P I, P IIa, P Illa, P IVa, and PIX. Type P I: Short-necked with simple everted rim (Fig. 81:12). This type occurs at Tel Qashish exclusively in Stratum IXC. Type P Ha: Short-necked with thick square rim (Figs. 79:16; 80:6; 81:22). Pithoi of this type occur at Tel Qashish in Strata IXC-VIII, becoming less common in Stratum VIII. Parallels come from MB IIA assemblages at Tel Zeror, Tel Poleg, and the Pre-Palace phase at Aphek, and from MB IIB assemblages at Megiddo (3121), Tel Qiri, and Jericho. Type P Ilia: Short-necked with inturned triangular rim (Figs. 78: 16; 8 1 :23). This type occurs mainly in Stratum IXC. Only one such rim was found in a later assemblage, attributed to Stratum IXA. These rims probably belong to hybrid vessels, somewhere between a krater and a pithos (like the vessel found at Megiddo [. Megiddo II: PI. 36:1], although it should be noted that its rim is ridged). A similar rim was found in the fill of the rampart at Mevorakh, which was correlated with the Palace phase at Aphek, that is, the MB IIA ( Mevorakh 11:57). Type P IVa: Short-necked with simple "nail" rim (Fig. 78:17, 20 [Photo 82:c]). The first appearance at Tel Qashish of pithoi of this type is in Stratum IXC. The type is especially common in Stratum IXA, after which it disappears (the rim found in Stratum VIIB is intrusive). Parallels were found at Megiddo and Tel Burga, and apparently also at Tel Zeror (Kochavi, Beck, and Gophna 1981:50). The type may 202 be characteristic of the combined western Jezreel Valley and northern coastal plain region. Type P IX: Short-necked with elongated and ridged rim (Fig. 80:7). Only one rim of this type was found in Stratum IXC. A parallel comes from an MB IIB assemblage at Jericho. Summary: Stratum IXC The dating of Stratum IXC is important for establishing the date of the construction of the fortified settlement of Stratum IX. Parallels for the various groups of vessels found in Stratum IXC come from MB IIA, transitional MB ILA-MB IIB, and MB IIB assemblages. None of the vessels are dated exclusively to the MB IIB, except for the cooking pot (Fig. 79:13) from L. 343 of the open type that occurs at Tel Qashish from Stratum VIII onwards and is intrusive in the Stratum IXC assemblage. Although the assemblage is not large, several types that appear in Stratum X continue into Stratum IXC: open bowls of Type B IVb, closed carinated bowls of Type CB I, globular cooking pots of Type GCP lb, dipper juglets of Type DJT I, jugs of Type J Ha, and storage jars of Type S J IVa. Some of these types last occur in Stratum IXB: closed carinated bowls of Type CB I and globular cooking pots of Type GCP lb. Several types that first occur in Stratum IXC last appear in Stratum IXB: closed carinated bows of Types CB III, CB Va, and CB Via, and globular cooking pots of Type GCP la. Other Stratum IXC types continue through the final phase of Stratum IX, phase IXA: storage jars of Type S J IIa and pithoi of Types P Ha and P Ilia. A number of vessel types found in Stratum IXC occur in assemblages later than Stratum IXA: open bowls of Types B IVb and B Via, globular cooking pots of Types GCP II and GCP III, dipper juglets of Type DJT I, jugs of Type J Ha, and storage jars of Type SJ lib. Two of these (open bowls of Type B IVb and jugs of Type J Ha) already appear in Stratum X. In conclusion, it is noteworthy that the continuity observed in the settlement plan through the Stratum IX phases is also apparent in the pottery. It should be empha- sized that most of the vessel types found in the Stratum IXC assemblages were found in the Stratum IX phases and not later. While Stratum X represents the final phase of the MB IIA, Stratum IXC belongs to the transitional phase between the MB IIA and MB IIB, and the fortified settlement at Tel Qashish was constructed during this phase. STRATUM IXB STRATIGRAPHY (Plans 26-27) The fortification system constructed in Stratum IXC continued in use unchanged throughout the Middle Bronze Age. The main changes are in the dwellings. The opening that existed in W. 29B in Stratum IXC is blocked (W. 29A), separating the areas of L. 326 and L. 81 A (Photo 86). W. 61 goes out of use, and the entire area to the south and west of the tower, L. 247 and L. 312, becomes a single large unit. The area of L. 249 and L. 300 was not exca- vated below Stratum IXB (Section G-G' in Squares V/l 5-1 7</page><page sequence="242">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A Plan 26.

Stratum IXB: general view, looking east. p. 23 1 ), and its Stratum IXC remains are therefore unknown. The stone pavement L. 250 (Photo 85) covers W. 249 of Stratum IXC (Photo 72). The floors were raised in all loci, as were those of the street. L. 249, 250, and 300 seem to comprise one unit, delimited by W. 16+W. 31 in the north and W. 63 in the east. W. 36 delimits L. 249 on the west, with a doorway connecting it with the unexcavated unit to the west (see Plan 27). These units are connected with the street on the south via openings in W. 18. It is difficult to determine whether the street continued westward beyond L. 250: W. 92 extending south- wards seems to indicate a change in the course of the street. L. 300 is connected with the street on the south and with L. 249 on the west, the socket to the north of the entrance indicating the location of the door (Photos 85, 87). L. 300 is also connected with stone-paved L. 250 on the east (Photo 85). A storage jar is sunk into the floor of L. 250 (Plan 26). L. 445 in the center of L. 300 is a stone-built circle (Photo 87), the function of which is unclear. A similar instal- lation was noted at Taanach (P. Lapp 1964: 19, Fig. 7). L. 304 (Plan 31) is a tomb dug down from Stratum IXA into the southwestern corner of L. 300 (Plans 26, 31). 204 Photo 86. Blocked entranceway in W. 29 A, Stratum IXB. The finds from L. 249 (Fig. 84:1-6), L. 250 (Fig. 85), and L. 300 (Fig. 84:7-18) may indicate their different functions: cooking pots are common in L. 300, while bowls are common in L. 250.

L. 300 may have been an open courtyard, while L. 249 and L. 250 seem to have served as living quarters. L. 81A (Fig. 82:1-8), L. 312 (Fig. 83), and L. 326 (Fig. 82:9-21) are located to the north of the above- mentioned three loci. They are some 0.8 m lower than L. 249, 250, and 300, but date from the same phase: the difference in elevation is to be explained as the result of the natural slope to the north. These two series of loci are not interconnected. With the construction of W. 29A, the passage between Photo 89. Loomweights from courtyard L. 300 (Fig. 84:15-18). L. 81A and 326 was blocked. A tabun was built abutting W. 29A. Access into L. 81 A, closed on three sides by solid walls, must have been from the west, beyond the excavated area. The entrance into L. 312 and 326, connected by an opening in W. 45, was from the east, through L. 247. W. 52, 53, 60, and 245 continued in use. No phase IXB floors associated with these walls were found: these were probably washed down the slope towards the east. THE CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE (Figs. 82-85) Bowls Open bowls (B) All the open bowls found in Stratum IXB are attributed to Type B IVb, apart from a single B Via bowl rim found in a fill (see Table 20). Type B IVb: Inverted cut rim (Figs. 82:1, 9; 83:1-3; 84: 1 ; 85: 1). This type first occurs at Tel Qashish in Stratum X and continues through Stratum VIII. Similar bowls were found at Megiddo in assemblages attributed to the MB IIA-MB IIB transition (T. 5254), to the MB IIB (T. 2135, T. 2140, T. 3058, T. 3075, T. 3 1 10, T. 3080), and to the end of the MB IIB (T. 3085, T. 3095). Such bowls also occur in an assemblage that could be dated either to the MB IIB or to the LB I (2024). Further parallels come from MB IIB assemblages at Mevorakh. The bowl depicted in Fig. 84:1 is red-slipped and burnished, thereby differing from other Type B IVb bowls. Parallels come from MB IIA assemblages at Tel Poleg and an MB IIB assemblage at Mevorakh. A similar bowl was also found at Megiddo in an assemblage of indeterminate date (ist. T. in 3071). 205</page><page sequence="245">CHAPTER 15 Fig. 82. Stratum IXB: L. 81 A and L. 326. Type B Via: Simple rim (Fig. 85:2). Bowls of this type first appear in Stratum IXC and continue through Stratum VI. Similar bowls were found at Megiddo in assemblages attributed to the end of the MB IIB (N=2032, S=2032, 5155). Closed carinated bowls (CB) The closed carinated bowls found in Stratum IXB belong to Types CB I, CB II, CB III, CB Va, CB Vc, and CB Via. Type CB I: Gutter-rimmed with sharp carination (Fig. 83:4). The bowl found in L. 312 is assigned to Type CB I, even though its rim is vertical compared to other bowl rims of this type. This bowl represents an intermediate type between Types CB I and CB III. In terms of dimensions and body shape, it resembles the Type CB III bowls, which first occur in Stratum IXB. Type CB II: Simple everted rim (Figs. 82:2, 10; 85:3-6). The type first occurs in Stratum IXC and continues through Stratum IXB, after which it disappears, apart from two rims found in Stratum VIII. Most of the Type CB II bowls from Stratum IXB are not red-slipped. Parallels come from MB IIA assemblages at Megiddo (T. 5130) and Aphek, and MB IIB assemblages at Mevorakh and Jericho. Type CB III: Triangular rim and sharp carination 206 (Fig. 82:3). These bowls occur first in Stratum IXC and last in Stratum IXB. Similar bowls were found in assemblages dated to the MB IIA at Aphek, the end of the MB IIA at Tel Burga, the beginning of the MB IIB at Megiddo (T. 3104), and the MB IIB in general at Megiddo (T. 3129). Type CB Va: Simple everted rim (Fig. 83:6). The type first appears in Stratum IXC and last in Stratum IXB. Similar bowls, but not red-slipped, were found at Megiddo in MB IIB assemblages (T. 2026, T. 3137). Type CB Vc: Ledge rim (Figs. 83:5; 85:7-8). The type appears at Tel Qashish only in Stratum IXB. Parallels come from MB IIB assemblages at Megiddo (T. 2 143, T. 4004) and Aphek (Post-Palace Phase A II). Type CB Via: Slightly carinated bowls with no ridge at the base of the neck (Fig. 82:11). This type occurs first in Stratum IXC and last in Stratum IXA. Similar bowls were found at Aphek in tombs attributed to the MB IIB. Open carinated bowls (OB) One rim assigned to Type OB V was found in Stratum IXB. Type OB V: "Egg-shell" family and related bowls (Fig. 85:9). Some examples appear in Strata IXB-IXA, but most were found in Stratum VIII.</page><page sequence="246">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A Fig. 82.

Closed kraters (CK) Type CK la: Simple ledge rim (Fig. 85:11). This type was found in Strata IXB and IXA. Its main occurrence is in Stratum IXA. Parallels come from MB IIB assemblages at Aphek (Post-Palace Phase A II) and Jericho. Type CK II: Triangular rim (Fig. 85: 13). Kraters of this type were found at Tel Qashish in Strata IXB and VIII. A larger krater with a similar body shape was found at Tel Qiri. Open kraters (K) Type K II: Everted rim (Fig. 85:12). Kraters of Type K II occur at Tel Qashish in Strata IXB-VIIA, mainly in Strata IXA-VIII. Cooking Pots With the exception of one upright-walled example (UCP) found in the make-up of a Stratum IXB floor, all the Stratum IXB cooking pots are of the globular (GCP) Types GCP lb, GCP II, and GCP III. The fragment of a globular cooking pot with a plastic decoration incised with a herringbone pattern is noteworthy (Fig. 82:8). Cooking pots with similar plastic decoration occur at Tel Qashish from Stratum IXC through Stratum VIII. Globular cooking pots (GCP) Type GCP lb: Thickened gutter rim (Figs. 82:6, 14; 83:8-9; 84:7). The type is known at Tel Qashish from Stratum X; its final appearance is in Stratum IXB. Most of the Stratum IXB cooking pots are of this type. Parallels come from MB IIA assemblages at Tel Burga and Tel Poleg. Type GCP II: Square rim (Figs. 84:8-10; 85:14-15). This type first occurs in Stratum IXC.

Similar cooking pots were found in assemblages dated to the MB IIA at Aphek, to the end of the MB ILA or beginning of the MB IIB at Megiddo (T. 3 1 09), and to the MB IIB at Megiddo (T. in 3182, = T. 3087), Mevorakh, Tel Michal (in the rampart), and Jericho. Type GCP III: Folded triangular rim (Fig. 82:7, 13, 15). The type first appears in Stratum IXC and continues into Stratum IXB. Its frequency declines in Stratum IXA, and it disappears thereafter (except for a single rim found in Stratum VI, which is intrusive). Open cooking pots (CP) Open cooking pots are represented in Stratum IXB by a single rim of Type CP Ilia (Fig. 83:10). These cooking pots occur continuously in the course of Strata VIII-V, and in Strata VIIA-V constitute the most common type. It seems that the isolated fragment found in Stratum IXB is intrusive.

Piriform Juglets (PJT) A single, almost complete juglet of Type PJT IIa was found in Stratum IXB (Fig. 83:11; Photo 90). The small ring base found in L. 326 (Fig. 82: 1 6) apparently also belongs to a red- slipped and burnished piriform juglet. Photo 90. Piriform juglet from L. 312, Stratum IXB (Fig. 83:11). Dipper Juglets (DJT) All the dipper juglet fragments found in Stratum IXB belong to Type DJT I. lýpe DJT I: Inturned rim (Figs. 83:12; 84:2; 85:16). Dipper juglets of this type first appear in Stratum IXC and continue into Stratum VIII (a single simple rim of this type was also found in Stratum VILA). The type includes both small (Fig. 84:2) and large (Fig. 83:12) juglets. No red- slipped or burnished examples were found in Stratum IXB . A similar dipper juglet was found at Tel Qiri. Jugs (J) The jugs in the Stratum IXB assemblages belong to Types J IIa, J III, J IVa, and J VII. Type J IIa: Simple triangular rim (Figs. 82:17; 84:12). This group of jugs first appears in Stratum X and continues through Stratum VIIA. The characteristic rims may belong either to jugs with a shoulder handle (e.g., Megiddo II: PI. 20:19) or amphoriskoi {Megiddo II: Pis. 21:1; 27:5). It is difficult to determine to which of the two vessel groups these rims belong. In this study, it was decided to classify them as jugs. Parallels come from an MB IIA assemblage at Aphek (Palace Phase IVB) and MB IIB assemblages at Megiddo (T. 3 109, T. 3 137, T. 4095). The|ype therefore belongs to the period spanning the MB IIA to the middle of the MB IIB. Type J III: Triangular gutter rim (Fig. 83: 13). The type first occurs at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXB, is common in Stratum VIII, and disappears thereafter. Type J IVa: Thin and elongated folded rim (Fig. 82: 1 8). This type occurs at Tel Qashish exclusively in Stratum IXB. A similar rim was found at Megiddo in an MB IIB assem- blage (T. 5259). Type J VII: Miscellaneous: concave and everted rim (Fig. 82:19). A similar rim comes from Mevorakh XIII. It is characteristic of the MB IIB ( Mevorakh 11:56). Storage Jars (SJ) The storage jars found in Stratum IXB belong to Types S J I, SJ lib, SJ III, SJ IVb, SJ V, and SJ Vllb. Type SJ I: Simple everted rim (Figs. 82:20; 84:5). The type occurs at Tel Qashish in Strata IXC and IXB. Numerous fragments of the storage jar depicted in Fig. 84:5 were found in L. 249. Similar storage jars were found at Tel Qiri and Tel Mevorakh, and the type is probably characteristic of the northern coastal plain ( Mevorakh 11:57). Type SJ lib: Simple folded rim (Figs. 82:21; 83:16; 84:13). Storage jar rims of this type occur at Tel Qashish from Stratum IXC through Stratum IXA. The rim found in Stratum V is intrusive. The rims of Type SJ lib storage jars from Strata IXB and IXA differ from those of this type found in Stratum IXC. The Type SJ lib storage jars resemble those of Type SJ VII that appear in Stratum VIIB, and it is possible that the latter replaces the former. Storage jar rims similar to those of Type S J lib from Stratum IXB were found at Tel Poleg and Aphek. Type S J III: Ridged folded rim (Fig. 85 : 1 7). Tel Qashish produced only one storage jar of this type, decorated with black paint on a white slip. It perhaps should be considered a variant of Type SJ II. Type SJ IVb: Ridge at base of flat folded rim (Fig. 84:3, 14). The type occurs at Tel Qashish only in Stratum IXB. Its closest parallels come from Tel Poleg and Mevorakh XIV; the latter is attributed to the MB IIB ( Mevorakh 11:56). Type SJ V: Folded and inturned rim (Fig. 84:4). This type occurs at Tel Qashish in Strata IXC-IXA assemblages. Parallels for the Stratum IXB rim come from MB IIA assem- blages at Aphek and Tel Polég. Type SJ Vllb: Inturned ring rim (Fig. 83: 15). It is diffi- cult to distinguish between Types SJ VIIa-b and SJ lib. Nevertheless, it appears that Types SJ VIIa-b mainly occur in Strata VIIB-V, while Type SJ lib is more characteristic of Strata IXC-IXA. Pithoi (P) Stratum IXB produced just one type of pithos, Type P lie. Type P IVb was found only in a fill attributed to Stratum IXB. Type Pile: Inturned and folded square rim (Fig. 84:6). This type occurs at Tel Qashish in Strata IXB-IXA. Parallels come from assemblages dated to the MB IIA at Aphek and the MB IIB at Jericho. Summary: Stratum IXB Stratum IXB represents a transitional phase between Strata 212</page><page sequence="252">IXC and IXA from a ceramic, as well as architectural, point of view. Several types that occur in Stratum IXC last appear in Stratum IXB: 1 . Closed carinated bowls of Types CB I, CB III, CB Va, and CB Via. Type CB II bowls, the most common type in Strata IXC-IXB, can also be added to this group, since the rims of this type found in Stratum VIII are apparently intrusive. 2. Globular cooking pots of Types GCP la, GCP lb and GCP IV. 3. Storage jars of Type SJ I. Several types first appear in Stratum IXB, continue into Stratum IXA, and disappear thereafter: closed kraters of Type CK la; storage jars of Types SJ Ha, SJ lib, and SJ VI; and pithoi of Type P lie. In addition, two types present in Stratum IXB have long lifespans, the limits of which remain undetermined: open bowls of Type B Via and jugs of Type J IIa. As a result of the continuity of various vessel types that appear in Stratum IXB, parallels come from both MB IIA and MB IIB assemblages. Some of the parallels, however, appear only in MB IIB assemblages: closed carinated bowls of Types CB Va and CB Via, and jugs of Types J III and J IVa. Stratum IXB should therefore be assigned to the MB IIB. Parallels for the open bowls of Type B Via were found only in assemblages attributed to the end of the MB IIB, but it should be borne in mind that this type occurs over a long period of time and thus cannot serve as a chronological indi- cator. STRATUM IXA STRATIGRAPHY (Plans 28-31) The plan of Stratum IXB continues with minor changes. No floors associated with the fortifications were preserved above L. 8 1 A, 3 12 and 326 in the northern excavated section. The average elevation of the floors of this phase is 52.80/70 (e.g., L. 228 and L. 229), while the fortifications were preserved to 52.25, approximately 0.5 m below that of the floors, which were apparently washed down-slope, with the collapse of the upper part of the fortifications. W. 29A continues in use, but inclines strongly westward (Photo 91). While possibly caused by the effects of time, this partial collapse may have already occurred in Stratum IX. W. 17 may have been constructed as a support for W. 9 for similar reasons. Stratum IXA may thus represent a partial rebuilding of phase IXB, possibly as a result of an earthquake. L. 240, 243, and 245 represent the raising of floors of L. 249, 250, and 300. The doorway in W. 18 (leading into L. 245) was narrowed and is associated with the higher elevation of the street L. 328 (Section F-F' in Square W/16; Photo 92). The area to the east of L. 245 was severely eroded and, as a result of their proximity to the slope, very little remains of the rooms built close to the tower, of which only L. 228 and L. 229 were preserved. Eleven complete pithoi were found in the southwestern corner of L. 240 (Plans 28-30; Figs. 87, 88; Photos 93-94). These were covered with mudbrick debris, probably from the superstructure. Photo 91.

The deceased were interred in pithoi of types common in Stratum IX, several complete examples of which, as mentioned above, were found in L. 240. Tomb 304 (Photos 95-97), the best preserved, is an infant (approximately two years old) burial in a pithos (Fig. 91:6; Photo 97:c). A juglet and a broken bowl (Fig. 91:3, 1; Photo 97:b, e) were placed next to the head, and two jugs were placed on either side of the bottom of the pithos (Fig. 91:4-5; Photos 96, 97:a, f). An additional bowl (Fig. 91:2; Photo 97:d), found among the stones below the pithos, may also have belonged to the burial. The mouth of the pithos was stopped with a few small stones. Tomb 75 is of a different nature (Photos 98-99). The deceased (an approximately 40-year-old female) was placed in the ground and covered by half a pithos (Fig. 91:9; Photo 99:d). The burial gifts were a bowl, a juglet, and a loomweight (Fig. 91:7-8, 12; Photo 99:a-c). In contrast to the other loomweights found at Tel Qashish, this example is well fired. Tomb 319 was severely disturbed, and all that remains of this burial are a few adult bones and some pithoi fragments. For an analysis of the human skeletal remains, see Chapter 24. Photo 93.

Similar bowls were found at Tel Zeror and at a site "south of Dor" (Gophna and Beck 1981 :46-48), dated by the excavators to the MB IIA. Parallels also pome from MB IIB assemblages at Megiddo (T. 5133) and Tel Mevorakh (in the fill of the Strata XIII-XII ramparts). The evidence from Tel Qashish seems to show that these bowls belong exclusively to the MB IIB, and, if so, Tel Zeror and the site "south of Dor" were occupied also during this period. Type B Via: Simple rim (Fig. 90:4). This type does not characterize a definable period at Tel Qashish, as it occurs from Stratum IXC through Stratum VI. Similar bowls were found at Megiddo in assemblages dated to the end of the MB IIB (T. 4055, S=2032). Type B Vlb: Simple everted rim (Fig. 90:3). This type occurs at Tel Qashish in Strata IXA-VIIB. Open carinated bowls (OB) In contrast to the earlier Strata X-IXB, all the carinated bowls found in Stratum IXA are of the open Types OB I, OB IIa, OB V, and OB VI. Type OB I: Pronounced carination and vertical rim (Fig. 86:3). This type first appears in Stratum IXA. The body sherds of bowls found in L. 245 (Fig. 89:3-4) can also be assigned to this group. The complete bowl (Fig. 86:3) and one fragment (Fig. 89:3) both have a small ring base. A similar bowl was found at Megiddo in an assemblage dated to the MB IIB through the end of the MB IIB period (T. 3175). Type OB Ha: Pronounced carination (Fig. 86:4). This bowl fragment probably belongs to Type OB Ha. Type OB V: "Egg-shell" family and related bowls (Fig. 90:5). Bowls of this type appear mainly in Stratum VIII, but first occur in Stratum IXB. Parallels come from Megiddo in assemblages dated to the MB IIB (T. 2135), to the end of the MB IIB (S=2032, T. 2144, T. 3095, T. 4055), and to the MB IIB-LB I (T. 3070). Type OB VI: Votive (Fig. 91:2; Photo 97:d). Only one bowl of this type was found at Tel Qashish; it served as a burial offering. A larger bowl of the same type was found in Tomb 498 at Kabri, in a burial dated to a late phase within the 223</page><page sequence="263">CHAPTER 15 Fig. 90.

Another bowl of this type was found at Megiddo, but not in a stratigraphie context (Square OIS). Kraters The kraters found in Stratum IXA belong to the closed Type CK la and to the open Types K II and K Via. Closed kraters (CK) Type CK la: Simple ledge rim (Figs. 89: 1 6; 90: 1 7-1 8). The closed kraters of Type CK la occur first in Stratum IXB and last in Stratum IXA. The appearance of this type at other sites indicates that it occurs also in the MB IIA. TTius, the absence of these kraters in the Strata X IXC assemblages at Tel Qashish is not chronologically significant. Parallels come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIA at Aphek (especially in the Pre-Palace strata, but continuing into the Palace stratum [Gophna and Beck 1981:60]) and at Mevorakh. Similar kraters were also found in MB IIB assem- blages at Jericho. Kraters of Type CK la are represented at Tel Qashish only by fragments, and it therefore cannot be determined whether or not they all belong to spouted vessels (e.g., the krater found in L. 246 [Fig. 89: 16]). A similar krater was found at Tel Mevorakh. Open kraters (K) The first occurrence of open kraters at Tel Qashish is in Stratum IXA. These belong to Types K II and K Via. Type K II: Everted rim (Figs. 89: 1 7; 90:6, 1 9). Kraters of this type occur in Strata IXA and VIII assemblages and in the fills of Strata VIIB and VILA. A similar krater was found at Megiddo in an assemblage dating from the end of the MB IIB or the beginning of the LB I (2025). The occurrence of Type K n at Tel Qashish could be defined as limited to Strata IXA- VIII, with the fragments found in the fills of Strata VIIB and VIIA considered intrusive. Type K Via: "Nail" rim (Fig. 89:7). This type occurs at Tel Qashish in Strata IXA and VIII. The krater rim from L. 245 resembles that of the open cooking pots of Type CP II, which first appear in Stratum IXA and continue into Stratum VIII. Amodelled rim of similar shape also occurs on pithoi of Type P rVa, which already appear in Stratum IXC and are most common in Stratum IXA. Bichrome ware (Fig. 90:24). A krater of this type was found in L. 229, together with a fragment of another Bichrome ware vessel (Fig. 90:25). Pétrographie analysis of these two sherds indicates that they belong to vessels origi- nating in Cyprus (A. Cohen, personal communication). Cooking Pots Open cooking pots first occur in Stratum IXA, alongside globular cooking pots. Globular cooking pots (GCP) The globular cooking pots in Stratum IXA belong to Types GCP II and GCP ni. Type GCP II: Square rim (Figs. 86:8-9; 89:9; 90:7). This is the most common type in Stratum IXA and continues to appear through Stratum VIII. Similar cooking pots were found in MB IIB assemblages at Tel Mevorakh and Jericho, and in assemblages attributed to the end of the MB IIB at Megiddo (T. 3030, T. 3109), Tel Michal (in the fill of the rampart), and Jericho. lýpe GCP III: Folded triangular rim (Fig. 89:10). This Stratum IXA cooking pot rim is thin compared to the GCP III rims from Strata IXC- IXB. Open cooking pots (CP) Open cooking pots first occur in Stratum IXA and gradually 227</page><page sequence="267">CHAPTER 15 replace globular cooking pots, which disappear in Strata VIIB-V. The Stratum IXA examples belong to Types CP I and CP IIa. Type CP I: Gutter rim (Fig. 86:10-11). This type continues into Stratum VIIB. Its rim resembles that of Type K V kraters. A similar cooking pot was found at Jericho in an assemblage dated to the end of the MB IIB. Type CP IIa: "Nail" rim (Figs. 86:12; 90:26). Cooking pots of Type CP Ha occur at Tel Qashish in Strata IXA-VIIB. The rim shape also occurs on kraters of Type K VII and pithoi of Type P IVa. Similar rims were found in an MB IIB assem- blage at Mevorakh and in assemblages attributed to the end of the MB IIB at Jericho and Tel Michal (in the fill of the rampart). Juglets The number of rims and complete vessels that can be identi- fied as juglets is small, and as a result, the issue of a specific type's frequency in a specific stratum at Tel Qashish cannot be discussed. Piriform Juglets (PJT) The Stratum IXA assemblages produced piriform juglets of Types PJT I, PJT lib, PJT III, and PJT IV. Another piriform juglet, a burial offering in Tomb 75 (Fig. 91:8; Photo 99:c), was found without a rim. Type PJT I: Simple everted rim (Figs. 90:8; 91:3). An intact piriform juglet (Fig. 91:3; Photo 97:b) was found in Tomb 304. Similar juglets, red-slipped and burnished, were found at Megiddo in MB IIB assemblages (T. 4 1 07, T. 524 1 ). Type PJT IIb: Ridge on neck, directly beneath rim (Fig. 89:18). Parallels come from MB IIB assemblages at Megiddo (2133, T. 5084). Type PJT III: Ring rim (Fig. 86: 1 3). Parallels come from MB IIB assemblages at Megiddo (T. 2026, T. 2140, T. 3084). Type PJT IV: Pinched neck (Fig. 90:20; Photo 100). Similar juglets were found at Kabri in Phase 1 of Tomb 498, Photo 100. Piriform juglet (L. 229; Fig. 90:20). attributed to the MB IIA (Kempinski 1989b:31), and at Megiddo in an MB IIB tomb (T. 3090). Pétrographie analysis of various juglets from Kabri indicates that they were manu- factured in northern Israel, and the excavators therefore suggest that they were made at Kabri itself or in its vicinity. In their opinion, the juglets were influenced by Anatolian pottery (Goren 1989:37-38). Dipper Juglets (DJT) A single dipper juglet rim was found in Stratum IXA, belonging to Type DJT I. Type DJT I: Inturned rim (Fig. 89:11). This type is known at Tel Qashish from Stratum IXC through Stratum VIII. Similar juglets were found at Megiddo in an MB IIB assemblage (T. 3110) and in assemblages spanning from the middle to the end of the MB IIB (T. 3095, T. 3175). Jugs (J) Stratum IXA produced jugs of Types J I, J IIa, J III, J IVb, J V, and J VII. Type J I: Dipper jug with simple pinched rim (Fig. 86:15-16; 91:4 [Photo 97:a]). This type first occurs in Stratum IXA and continues through Stratum VI. Type J Ha: Simple triangular rim (Fig. 90:10, 21). Jugs of this type occur at Tel Qashish in Strata X-VIIA. At Megiddo, similar rims belong to jugs with a shoulder handle. These were found in MB IIB tombs (T. 24, T. 3087, T. 5067), and in a tomb dated to the end of the MB IIB (T. 3095). Type J III: Triangular gutter rim (Fig. 90:11-12). These vessels occur at Tel Qashish in Strata IXB-VIII. Similar jugs were found at Megiddo in assemblages attrib- uted to the end of the MB IIB (T. 3095, T. 4055) and in an assemblage beginning in the MB IIB and ending in the LB I (T. 3070). Type J IVb: Thin and short folded rim (Fig. 86:17). These jugs occur at Tel Qashish in Strata X-IXA. Type J V: Modelled rim (Fig. 91:5; Photos 97:f, 101). These jugs first occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA and continue through Stratum VI. Similar jugs were found at Megiddo in MB IIB assem- blages (T. 24, T. 5259). It should be noted, however, that the example from Megiddo Tomb 24 has a different rim. Paral- lels also come from Taanach and Hazor. Type J VII: Miscellaneous - concave neck and thick- ened rim (Fig. 86: 1 8). Asimilar jug was found at Megiddo in an assemblage attributed to the end of the MB IIB. An LB II assemblage at Hazor produced a jug with a similar shape belonging to the "Light Red Ware" family. Storage Jars (SJ) The storage jars found in Stratum IXA belong to Types SJ lib, SJ V, SJ Vila, SJ Vllb, and SJ VIII. Type SJ lib: Simple folded rim (Fig. 89:20). These are common in Strata IXC and IXB and continue through Stratum IXA. While the quantity of this type declines in Stratum IXA, this also applies to the other storage jar types. Type SJ V: Folded and inturned rim (Fig. 89:13). This type was found at Tel Qashish in Strata X-IXA. Parallels come only from MB IIA assemblages at Tel Poleg and Aphek. It can therefore be assumed that the rim found in 228</page><page sequence="268">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A Photo 101. Jug (L. 304; Fig. 91:5). Stratum IXA originated in an earlier stratum, probably Stratum X. Type SJ Vila: Simple ring rim (Fig. 89:12). These rims first occur in Stratum IXA. The resemblance between this storage jar type and Type SJ lib (the most common type in Strata IXB-IXC) suggests that SJ Vila replaces SJ lib. SJ Vila storage jars are the most common type in Strata VIIB-V. Parallels come from Megiddo in assemblages dated to the MB IIB (T. 3075) and to the end of the MB IIB (T. 3085). Type SJ Vllb: Inturned ring rim (Fig. 90: 1 3). It is diffi- cult to determine whether this rim belongs to a jug or storage jar. While we decided to consider it a storage jar of Type SJ Vllb, it cannot be deemed a good example of the type. SJ Vllb storage jars occur at Tel Qashish from Stratum IXB through Stratum VIIB. Type SJ VIII: Inwardly thickened "concave" rim (Fig. 86:20). The only storage jar of this type found at Tel Qashish comes from Stratum IXA. A complete storage jar with a similar rim was found in the "third burial phase" at Barqai. Pithoi (P) The number of pithoi (complete vessels and rims) in Stratum IXA is large compared with that of storage jars. The Stratum IXA pithoi belong to Types P IIa, P lib, P Ile, P Ilia, P Illb, P rVa, P Va, P VI, P VII, and P VIII. Type P Ha: Short-necked with thick square rim (Fig. 90:22). Rims of this type are characteristic of the Strata IXC-IXA assemblages. Similar pithoi appear in MB IIA and MB IIB assemblages at Megiddo (3121) and at Tell el-Far'ah (North). Type P lib: Short-necked with thin square rim (Fig. 87:2). Tel Qashish produced only one example of this type. Type P lie: Short-necked with inturned and folded square rim (Figs. 86:23; 88:1; 91:9). These pithoi occur in Strata IXB-IXA and disappear thereafter. Type P Ilia: Short-necked with inturned triangular rim (Fig. 86:22). This type appears in Strata IXA and IXC. Its absence in Stratum IXB is probably fortuitious. Type P Illb: Short-necked with everted triangular rim (Fig. 87:3). This type occurs in the assemblages of Strata X and IXA. Type P IVa: Short-necked with simple "nail" rim (Figs. 86:26; 87:4-6; 90:14 [Photo 102]; 91:6 [Photo 97:c]). This is the most common pithos type at Tel Qashish. It occurs first in Stratum IXC and last in Stratum IXA. Rims of pithoi of this type found in the fill layers of Stratum VIIB floor L. 360 are therefore probably intrusive. lype P Va: Short-necked with simple folded rim (Figs. 86:25; 87:1; 88:2). Pithoi of this type occur at Tel Qashish exclusively in Stratum IXA. Photo 102. Pithos (Fig. 90:14). 229</page><page sequence="269">CHAPTER 15 Type P VI: Short-necked with ring rim (Fig. 86:21). This type was found exclusively in Stratum IXA. It resem- bles the storage jar rims of Type SJ Vila, which initially occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA and with high frequency in Strata VIIB-V. Type P VII: High-necked with ridged rim (Fig. 88:3). Pithoi of this type have a high neck, similar to Type P VIII. Type P VII first occurs in Stratum IXA and becomes the most common pithos type in Stratum VIII. Type P VIII: High-necked with ledge rim (Figs. 86:24, 27; 88:4). These pithoi first occur in Stratum IXA and peak in Stratum VIII. The Type P VIII rim shape also occurs on kraters of Type K Via and cooking pots of Type CP IIa, which also first appear in Stratum IXA. The pithos depicted in Fig. 88:4 was assigned to Type P VIII because, even though its rim differs from the other P VIII examples, it has the high neck characteristic of Types P VII and P VIII. Summary: Stratum IXA The Stratum IXA assemblages include the following types that already appear in Strata IXC and IXB: open bowls of Types B IVa and B V; open carinated bowls of Type OB V; globular cooking pots of Types GCP II and GCP III; piriform juglets of Types PJT IIa and PJT III; jugs of Type J IVb; storage jars of Types SJ IIa, S J IIb, and possibly also S J Vllb; and pithoi of Type P IIa. Some types first appear in Stratum IXA: jugs of Type J IVa and storage jars of Types SJ Ha and SJ lib. This stratum also includes the first appearance of types that characterize the subsequent Stratum VIII assemblage: open bowls of Types B Ilia, B Va, B Vb, and B VIb; open kraters of Type K Via; open cooking pots of Types CP I and CP Ha; jugs of Type J I; storage jars of Type S J Vila; and and pithoi of Types P VII and P VIII. Parallels for the vessels found in Stratum IXA at Tel Qashish mainly come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIB, from the beginning to the end of this period. Some of the types have parallels only in assemblages dated to the end of the MB IIB: open kraters of Type K II; open cooking pots of Type CP la; and jugs of Types J III and J VII (Miscel- laneous). Stratum IXA did not produce any type of vessel indicative of the MB II-LB I transitional phase and therefore should be dated to the MB IIB. Given the continuity of types from Strata IXA to Stratum VIII, and since Stratum VIII is assigned to the end of the MB IIB, it appears that Stratum IXA can be attributed to the middle of the MB IIB. STRATUM VIII STRATIGRAPHY (Plan 32) Remains of this stratum were found only on the southern side of the excavated area in Squares V-W/16-17. The Stratum VIII loci are clearly built on top of those of Stratum IXA, on one hand, and below those of Stratum VII on the other (Section G-G' in Squares V/15-17; Photos 103-104). Stratum VIII lacks substantial architecture, its remains consisting mainly of stone pavements L. 230, 23 1 , 438A, and 438B, and two wall fragments W. 246 and 247. A rich ceramic assemblage was found on the pavements (Photos 104-105). The average elevation of the floors is 53.30, some 0.4 m above the Stratum IXA floors and 0.7 m below the Stratum VII floors. L. 230 constitutes a stone pavement and a patch of beaten earth with a thin plaster coating to its north (Photo 104). The entire surface is covered with ash. The pavement covers pilaster W. 1 7. The storage jars found on the pavement differ typologically from those found immediately below it in Stratum IXA. Similarly, in L. 231, a stone pavement covered with ash was found above W. 36 of Stratum IXA (Section G-G' in Squares V/15-17; Photo 103). To the north of this pavement is a patch of lime-covered beaten earth. Since the pottery fragments from L. 230 (Fig. 92) are not restorable with those from pavement L. 231 (Fig. 93), it seems that the fallen bricks found between these two loci represent a collapsed wall that originally separated them. L. 236 is the make-up of the L. 230 and L. 231 pavements (Fig. 99:10-13). L. 438 consists of remnants of a stone pavement in the north and two fragmentary walls, one of which is curvilinear, which do not represent a coherent plan (Photos 105-106). Two floor levels differing in elevation by 10-20 cm were discerned, the upper L. 43 8 A and the lower L. 43 8B Photo 103.

It is not clear whether these are indeed two separate floors or the result of accumulations of pottery over time (Photo 107). The 16 loomweights come exclusively from L. 43 8A. Some of the Stratum IXB loomweights were found not far away (Fig. 84:15-18; Photo 89, Plan 26). A comparison shows two main differences between the two groups: first, while the earlier group is elliptical in section, the later is rounded; and second, the earlier loomweights are smaller than the later ones. The average weight of the loomweights in the earlier group is ca. 300-350 gr (Fig. 84: 1 5-1 8; 85 : 19-21 ; Photos 88-89), while that of the latter is ca. 600-750 gr (Fig. 97; Photo 108). Both groups are made of unbaked clay, or clay baked at very low temperatures. L. 389 is a pavement of small pebbles, covered with ash, like the other Stratum VIII pavements. A small number of bones and sherds (Fig. 98:1-13) were found on this pavement. Photo 107.

Loomweights from L. 438B (Stratum VIII; Fig. 97:1-9). THE CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE (Figs. 92-98) Bowls Open bowls (B) Stratum VIII yielded open bowls of Types B la, Bib, B II, B Ilia, B IVa, B IVb, B Va, B VIb, B Vlf, and B VII (Miscel- laneous). Type B la: Simple rounded rim (Fig. 98: 1 ). These bowls first occur in Stratum VIII and their frequency increases in Strata VIIA-VI. The diameter of the Type B la bowls from the Strata VIIB-VI assemblages is smaller than that of the Stratum VIII examples. Similar bowls were found at Megiddo in an assemblage dated to the MB IIB in general and through the end of this period (T. 3095). Type B lb: Simple rounded rim, red-slipped and burnished (Fig. 93: 1). This type occurs first in Stratum IXA and last in Stratum VIIB. Similar bowls were found at Megiddo in an assemblage dated to the MB IIB in general and through the end of this period (T. 3095), and in an assem- blage that begins in the MB IIB and continues into the LB I (T. 3070). Type B II: Sharpened rim (Fig. 92: 1). Bowls of this type occur at Tel Qashish only in Strata VIII and VIIA. Type Billa: Small inwards-folded rim bowls (Figs. 94: 1 ; 96:3). Bowls with a thickened rim first occur in Stratum IXA and continue through Stratum V. The bowl depicted in Fig. 94:1 is red-slipped and burnished on the inside, similar to one of the Stratum IXA examples (Fig. 91:7). The slip and burnish distinguishes these two bowls from the others of Type B Ilia. Type B IVa: Simple cut rim (Fig. 93:2; Photo 109). This type first occurs in Stratum IXC and continues through Stratum VI. The bowls are usually undecorated, as are those in assemblages from Megiddo dating from the end of the MB IIB (T. 3085, T. 3175, T. 4055) and an example from Beth-Shean. These are similar in shape to the decorated bowl from Tel Qashish depicted in Fig. 93:2. Type B IVb: Inverted cut rim (Fig. 98:2-3). This type first occurs in Stratum X, is the most common bowl in Stratum IXB, and last appears in Stratum VIII. One bowl of this type found at Tel Qashish is decorated with red bands (Fig. 98:3). Undecorated parallels were found at Megiddo in MB IIB assemblages (T. 2130, T. 2143, T. 4051, T. 4053, T. 4078, T. 5046, T. 5249) and in an assemblage attributed to the end of the MB IIB (T. 2144). Type B Va: Rounded everted rim, without slip or burnish (Fig. 96: 1-2). This type first occurs in Stratum IXA and continues through Stratum VI. The diameter of the bowl depicted in Fig. 96:1 is ca. 45 cm, and an example with a similar diameter was found in Stratum IXA (Fig. 89:1). In contrast, the Type B Va bowls in the subsequent strata are smaller. There is also a resemblance in shape between the Type B Va bowl depicted in Fig. 96:1 and the Type B Vb bowls found exclusively in Stratum IXA (Fig. 86:1-2). Parallels for the bowl depicted in Fig. 96:1 were found in MB IIB assemblages at Megiddo (T. 5133) and Beth- Shean. Photo 109. Bowl (Fig. 93:2). Type B VIb: Simple everted rim (Figs. 93:3, 94:3). This type occurs first in Stratum IXA and last in Stratum VIIB. Type B Vlf: Votive (Fig. 94:2). A single votive bowl was found in Stratum VIII at Tel Qashish. Similar bowls were found at Megiddo in assemblages of indeterminate date (S=2032, S=5026, =5155). Type B VII: Miscellaneous - modelled cut rim (Fig. 92:2). A bowl of this type was found only in Stratum VIII. 233</page><page sequence="273">CHAPTER 15 Fig. 92. Stratum VIII: L. 230.

Such bowls are typical of Strata IXC and IXB. Open carinated bowls (OB) The open carinated bowls found in Stratum VIII belong to Type OB V. Type OB V: "Egg-shell" family and related bowls (Fig. 98:5). These rims belong to bowls of the "egg-shell" family or a closely related group. The type first occurs in Stratum IXB and is most common in Stratum VIII. Its final appearance is in the make-up of a Stratum VIIB floor, and it therefore probably originates in Stratum VIII. If so, then the last occurrence of this type at Tel Qashish is in Stratum VIII. Similar bowls were found at Megiddo in assemblages attrib- uted to the end of the MB IIB (T. 4043, T. 4046) and at Mevorakh XII. These have a flat disc base (e.g., Megiddo II: PI. 36:17) or a trumpet base (e.g., Megiddo II: PI. 37:9; Mevorakh II: Fig. 11:6). In this context, it should be noted that while the high ring bases at Tel Qashish (Figs. 94:4; 96:4-5; 98:6) occur in Stratum VIII, they disappear in the subsequent strata. These bases may also belong to open carinated bowls. Kraters Open kraters (K) The kraters found in Stratum VIII belong to Types K II, K Ilia, K V, K Via, K VIb, K Vic, and K VIII. Type K II: Everted rim (Figs. 93:7-9; 96:7, 98:8). This type occurs first in Stratum IXA and last in a fill beneath a Stratum VIIB floor. It is the most common krater in Stratum VIII. No exact parallels for the Stratum VIII examples were found. The type occurs in MB IIB assemblages at Megiddo (T. 3026, 3038) and Mevorakh. Type K Ilia: Thickened rim and short neck (Fig. 93: 10). This type appears in Stratum VIII (a single rim was found in the Stratum VIIB fills). The assemblages from Megiddo attributed to the MB IIB or the end of this period produced similar kraters (W=2128, 3053). In contrast to the Tel Qashish example, however, these are not red- slipped. Types K V: Gutter rim; K Via: "Nail" rim; K VIb: Grooved rim (Figs. 93:11-12; 98:7). These kraters have rims similar to those of cooking pots of Types CP la, CP Ha, and CP lib, and differ only in their ware. Types K V and K VIb occur at Tel Qashish only in Stratum VIII, and Type K Via occurs in Strata IXA and VIII. A krater similar to Type K VIb was found at Megiddo in an assemblage of indetermi- nate date and at Beth-Shean in an assemblage attributed to the end of the MB IIB. Similar cooking pots were also found at Jericho in phases dated to the end of the MB IIB. Type KVIc: Ridged rim (Fig. 94:5; Photos 107, 110). No exact parallel for this krater was found. Megiddo produced a similar example, without the snake decoration ( Megiddo II: PL 52:5), in an assemblage of problematic dating, but probably belonging to the LB I (E=T. 3027). Akrater of iden- tical diameter and proportions to the Tel Qashish example was found at Yoqne'am in a stratum dated to the end of the MB IIB. The same locus produced pithoi with modelled rims and high necks made of greenish clay (Types P VII and P VIII). These types were found at Tel Qashish exclusively in Stratum VIII. Although the krater from Yoqne'am has four handles and a differently modelled rim, it apparently can nevertheless be used to reconstruct the lower part of the krater from Tel Qashish, as suggested in Fig. 94:5. Type K VIII: Thickened, elongated, modelled rim (Fig. 96:6). A rim (ca. 40 cm in diameter) of this type was found in Stratum VIII. Such large kraters, with rims of various shapes, are known in assemblages characteristic of the end of the MB IIB at Tel Qashish and Yoqne'am. Photo 110.

Stratum VIII: L. 438A. Closed kraters (CK) The closed kraters found in Stratum VIII belong to Types CK lb and CK II. Type CK lb: Modelled ledge rim (Fig. 98:9). These kraters occur at Tel Qashish exclusively in Strata VIII and VIIB. A similar krater was found at Hazor. Type CK II: Triangular rim (Fig. 98:8). These kraters occur first at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXB and last in Stratum VIII. At Shechem, a krater with a similar rim was dated to the MB II solely on the basis of typology. Cooking Pots Most of the cooking pots from Stratum VIII are open, although some globular cooking pots were also found. Globular cooking pots (GCP) The globular cooking pots found in Stratum VIII belong to Type GCP II. Fragments of Types GCP la and GCP III were found in fills attributed to Stratum VIII, but the possibility that these fragments originated in earlier strata cannot be precluded. 240 Type GCP II: Square rim (Figs. 93:13; 95:1-3; 96:8; Photo 111). Cooking pots of this type first occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXC and comprise the most common type in Stratum IXB. Stratum VIII produced two rims of this type with an inner gutter (Figs. 93:13; 95:2). No exact parallel was found for the cooking pot depicted in Fig. 95:3 and Photo 111. The closest is a cooking pot from a pit attrib- uted to Stratum X at Megiddo, which lacks the plastic deco- rative band on its shoulder, but has a plastic decoration in the form of a cross within a circle on its base. The practice of decorating bases of globular cooking pots with crosses occurs in the MB II, e.g., at Tel Qashish and Megiddo. Open cooking pots bear such decoration in the Late Bronze Age, mainly the LB I; e.g., Fosse Temple I at Lachish yielded four such cooking pots, while Fosse Temple II yielded only one {Lachish II: PL LVB:352, 358). Similar globular cooking pots featuring incised plastic decoration were found at Mevorakh XIII (a comparable rim was found in Stratum XII), at Beth-Shean in an assemblage dating from the MB IIB, and at Gezer in an assemblage dating from the end of the MB IIB and perhaps LB I.</page><page sequence="280">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A Fig. 96.

Open cooking pots (CP) The open cooking pots found in Stratum VIII belong to Types CP I, CP Ha, CP lib, CP Ilia, and CP lile. Type CPI: Gutter rim (Figs. 93:16; 96:9). Cooking pots of Type CP I occur first in Stratum IXA and last in Stratum VIIB. Similar rims were found in assemblages attributed to the end of the MB IIB at Beth-Shean and Jericho. Type CP Ha: "Nail" rim (Figs. 92:3; 93:17-19). Cooking pots of this type occur at Tel Qashish from Stratum IXA through Stratum VIIB and are most common in Stratum VIII. Similar cooking pots were found in assemblages attrib- uted to the end of the MB IIB at Beth-Shean and Jericho, and in the fills of the ramparts and glacis at Tel Michal and at Shiloh, respectively. Type CP lib: Grooved rim (Figs. 93:14-15; 95:4). This type occurs at Tel Qashish in Strata VIII and VIIB and is especially common in Stratum VIII. Parallels come from Jericho in an assemblage dated to the end of the MB IIB. Type CP Ilia: Simple triangular or wavy triangular rim (Fig. 96:10). This type first occurs at Tel Qashish in Stratum VIII (the vessel in an assemblage attributed to Stratum IXB is apparently intrusive) and continues through Stratum V. Type CP lile: Short triangular rim (Fig. 93:20). Cooking pots of this type first occur in Stratum VIII and continue through Stratum V. Juglets The two juglet fragments found in this stratum belong to dipper juglets of Type DJT I. Type DJT I: Inturned rim (Figs. 93 :2 1 ; 96: 1 1 ). This type occurs first in Stratum IXC and last in Stratum VIII. The fragment found in Stratum VILA is probably intrusive.

The dipper juglets with inverted rims (Fig. 96:11) have a long lifespan. Megiddo produced such juglets in assem- blages dating from the MB IIA(T. 3 144), the MB IIB (2013, T. 2026, T. 3075, T. 3109, T. 4099, T. 5259), and the end of this period (T. 3030, T. 3085, T. 3095, T. 3175, T. 4055). Jugs (J) The jugs found in Stratum VIII belong to Types J I and J III. Type J I: Dipper jug with simple pinched rim (Figs. 93:22; 96:12). This type occurs at Tel Qashish from Stratum IXA through Stratum VI. Type J III: Triangular gutter rim (Figs. 93:23-24; 95:5). This type occurs at Tel Qashish from Stratum IXB through Stratum VIII. Similar jugs were found at Megiddo in assemblages dating from the MB IIB (T. 3087, T. 5067) and from the end of this period (T. 3066). The rims of the jugs from Megiddo are not trefoil, thereby more closely resembling the rim depicted in Fig. 93:24, and have a shoulder handle. Since no complete Type J III example was found at Tel Qashish, it cannot be determined whether or not the rims found in Stratum VIII belong to jugs with a shoulder handle. Storage Jars (SJ) The only almost complete storage jar found in Stratum VIII (Fig. 92:4) lacks a rim. Based on its shape and especially thin walls, it seems to have had a modelled everted rim similar to that of the storage jars found at Megiddo in assemblages attributed to the end of the MB II (T. 3095, T. 4055) and to the end of the MB IIB and the beginning of the LB I (T. 3070). If so, the Tel Qashish storage jar belongs to Type SJ VI. This type is also represented in Stratum VIII by rims. This stratum also yielded storage jar rims of Type S J Vila. Type SJ VI: Ridged rim (Fig. 96:13-14). Rims of this type were found at Tel Qashish exclusively in Stratum VIII. Aš noted above, several vessel types in Stratum VIII evinced a tendency toward rim modelling: kraters of Types K V, K Via, K VIb, K Vic, and K VII; cooking pots of types CP I, CP IIa, and CP lib; storage jars of Types SJ VI; and pithoi of types P VII and P VIII (see below). Similar storage jars were found at Megiddo in assemblages attributed to the end of the MB IIB (T. 3095, T. 4055) and to the end of the MB IIB and beginning of the LB I (T. 3070). The storage jars and pithoi of Stratum VIII have several features in common: 1 . A number of the vessels are made of a "sandy"-textured, greenish material. 2. There is a tendency toward especially thin walls (relative to those of the Stratum IXA vessels). 3. They were fired at a high temperature. Type SJ Vila: Simple ring rim (Fig. 98:12-13). This type first occurs at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA and becomes the most common type in Strata VIIB-V. Pithoi (P) All the Stratum VIII pithoi have a high neck, in contrast to most of those found in Stratum IXA. The Stratum VIII pithoi are of Types P VII and P VIII exclusively. These already 244 appear to a limited extent in Stratum IXA. Most of the pithoi found in Stratum VIII are made of clay with a "sandy" texture and greenish color. Type P VII: High-necked with a ridged rim (Figs. 92:5-8; 93 :28-29). Pithoi of this type first occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA and are most common in Stratum VIII. One rim was found in Stratum VIIB. Similar pithoi were found at Jericho in assemblages dated to the MB IIB and the end of this period. Type P VIII: High-necked with ledge rim (Figs. 93:25-27; 96: 15). This type occurs mainly in Stratum VIII, which is its last appearance. It first occurs in Stratum IXA. Similar pithoi were found at Yoqne'am in the last stratum attributed to the MB II. Imported Vessels Two very small fragments found in Stratum VIII assem- blages at Tel Qashish belong to vessels of Cypriot White- Painted Ware, WP IV-V (Figs. 93:30; 96: 17). The fragment depicted in Fig. 93:30 may belong to a small spouted juglet, while that depicted in Fig. 96:17 belongs to a dipper jug. WP IV-V occurs in MB IIB contexts through the end of this period (Johnson 1982:50-68). Summary: Stratum VIII The ceramic assemblages attributed to Strata IXC-IXA come from rooms within a single architectural complex that underwent slight changes in the course of the various phases. Since the Stratum VIII assemblage was found above this complex, it seems that the settlement at Tel Qashish under- went a significant change between Strata IXA and VIII. Is this change also expressed in the pottery? The Stratum VIII assemblage includes vessels of types found in the earlier strata, types that appear exclusively in Stratum VIII, and those that first occur in Stratum VIII and continue into later strata. As such, from a ceramic point of view, Stratum VIII represents a transitional phase between Stratum IX and Stratum VII. Thus, despite the clear architectural break between Strata IXA and VIII, the more pronounced ceramic break can be observed between Strata VIII and VIIB (see the typological discussions in Chapters 16 and 17). Among the vessels associated with Stratum VIII, some already appear before Stratum IXA (open bowls of Types B IVa and B IVb; open carinated bowls of Type OB V; closed carinated bowls of Type CB II; closed kraters of Type CK II; globular cooking pots of Type GCP II; and open cooking pots of Type CP Ilia), others first occur in Stratum IXA (open bowls of Types B IIb, B Ilia, B Va, and B VIb; open kraters of Types K II and K Via; open cooking pots of types CP I and CP Ha; jugs of Type J I; and pithoi of Types P VII and P VIII), and others first occur in Stratum VIII and continue into the following strata (bowls of Types B la and B II; open kraters of Types K lb and K III; open cooking pots of Types CP lib and CP IHe; and jugs of Type J V). Very few vessels can be attributed exclusively to Stratum VIII (open kraters of Types K VIb, K Vic, and K VIII; and storage jars of Type SJ VI). Parallels for the Stratum VIII vessels come from assem- blages attributed to the MB IIB, to the transition between the MB IIB and LB I, and to the LB I. It is therefore reasonable to date Stratum VIII to the end of the MB IIB.</page><page sequence="284">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A THE LATE BRONZE AGE Late Bronze Age remains were excavated mainly in Squares S-V/16 and U-V/17 (Plans 34, 36, 38-39). In Squares V/16-17, a clear superposition of the earliest Late Bronze Age walls (Stratum VIIB) on top of the latest Middle Bronze Age remains (Strata IXA-VIII) was observed (Plan 33). Stratum IX is clearly dated to the Middle Bronze Age, while Stratum VII is clearly Late Bronze Age; Stratum VIII thus represents a transitional phase between these two periods. The pottery found in the fills between Strata VIII and VII is presented in Fig. 99. Stratum VI dates from the Late Bronze Age, and there may be a gap between the end of Stratum VI and the beginning of Stratum V/IV, a supposition possibly supported by the fact that Stratum VI ended in a conflagration. The question of the transition between the last clearly datable Late Bronze Age Stratum VI to the Iron I Stratum IV is difficult: Stratum V is most probably still of Late Bronze Age date, but the orientation of the Stratum V walls is the same as that of Stratum IV, and some of the walls seem to have been in use in both strata. The problem of the nature of the transition between these two periods apparently cannot be solved on the basis of the limited information obtained at Tel Qashish so far. Plan 33.

The main loci are L. 72B, 80, 79 and 84, 89, 360, and 362. The average eleva- tion of the floors in Squares S-V/16 is 53.85, while those in Squares U-V/17 are slightly higher. The fortification system constructed in the Middle Bronze Age goes out of use, and W. 33B, W. 38, W. 40, and W. 46, defining L. 72B and L. 80 of the Late Bronze Age dwellings, are built over the previous fortification wall (Plan 33). The orientation of these walls, however, is the same as that of the walls of the dwellings of the previous period. Like the earlier walls, these are built of rough field stones, but their average width is 0.6 m, compared to an average width of 0.4 m of the Middle Bronze Age walls (see Chapter 18, pp. 325-326). L. 72B, 80, and 85 (Photos 112-113) probably belong to the same unit. Most of the finds originate on the stone pavement of L. 80. An oven, a stone-built installation, and a pebble floor in L. 79 and 84 are associated with W. 38 (Photo 1 13). This space may have been unroofed. No walls define L. 360, in which only a floor was found, composed of several fill layers (L. 373, 376, and 381), some 45 cm thick. Photo 112. Stratum V 11 loci beneath superimposed Iron Age walls.

Walls W. 6, 8, and 10, the tabun L. 89, and pavement L. 362 probably all belong to the same unit. THE CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE (Figs. 100-103) Bowls Open bowls (B) The open bowls found in Stratum VIIB belong to Types B lb, B Ilia, B Illbl, B IVa, B Va, B Via, B VIb, B Vic. Type B lb: Simple rounded rim, red-slipped and burnished (Fig. 101:9). Bowls of this type occur at Tel Qashish from Stratum IXA through Stratum VIIB. Similar bowls were found at Megiddo in assemblages attributed to the end of the MB II (T. 3066, T. 3085, T. 3095, T. 3 175) and in those beginning in the MB IIB and ending in the LB I (T. 3070). Type B Ilia: Small inwards-folded rim (Fig. 100:2). This type first occurs at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA and continues through Stratum V. Type B Illbl: Large inwards-folded rim (Fig. 100:7). This type was found at Tel Qashish in Strata VIIB and VIIA. The diameter of the example depicted in Fig. 100:7 is ca. 35 cm. Bowls of a similar size belonging to chalices were found in LB I assemblages at Megiddo (2115) and Mevorakh. Type B IVa: Simple cut rim (Figs. 101:1-3, 5-7; 102:1, 13-14). These bowls comprise the most common type in the Stratum VIIB assemblage. They have various bases: ring (Fig. 101:1 [Megiddo II: PI. 54:8]), disc {Megiddo II: PL 54:7), or flat {Megiddo II: PL 54:2). The type occurs at Tel Qashish from Stratum IXC through Stratum VI. The bowls from Stratum VIIB are ca. 25 cm in diameter, considerably smaller than the Type B IVa example from Stratum VIII (ca. 35 cm in diameter). Similar bowls were found at Megiddo in an MB IIB assemblage (T. 3076) and in assemblages attrib- uted to the end of the MB IIB (T. 2144, N=T. 3040, T. 3048, T. 3095, T. 4054). A similar bowl was found at Beth-Shean in Tomb 303, dated to the transitional phase between the MB II and LB I (Oren 1973:69; Gonen 1979:78), but none of these vessels must necessarily be attributed to the LB I. Similar bowls were also found in assemblages dated to the transi- tional phase between the MB II and LB I at Megiddo (2047, T. 3070). The latest assemblages containing bowls similar to those from Tel Qashish Stratum VIIB are attributed to the LB I at Megiddo (T. 2098, 2114, 2115, T. 3028) and Mevorakh XI. Type B Va: Rounded everted rim, without slip or burnish (Fig. 100:1). This type occurs at Tel Qashish in Strata IXA-VI. Type B Via: Simple rim (Fig. 100:3). Bowls of this type were found at Tel Qashish in Strata IXC-VI. Type B IVb: Simple everted rim (Fig. 100:6). This type occurs first in Stratum IXA and last in Stratum VIIB. Paral- lels come from Megiddo, mainly in LB I assemblages (T. 3018D, T. 3018E, and T. 2016, although it is uncertain whether the last belongs to the MB II or LB I). Type B Vic: Inwards-folded rim (Fig. 100:4-5). Bowls of this type were found at Tel Qashish exclusively in Stratum VIIB. Open carinated bowls (OB) All the carinated bowls found in Stratum VIIB are of the open Types OB II, OB III, and OB V. Type OB II: Carinated with everted rim (Fig. 100:8). Bowls of this type occur first in Stratum IXA and last in Stratum VI. Since the point of carination of the example depicted in Fig. 1 00:8 was not found, it cannot be determined whether this rim belongs to Type OB Ila or OB lib. Type OB lib first occurs in Stratum VIIA; Type OB IIa, however, is absent in the Strata VILA-VI assemblages. Type OB III: Modelled rim and slight carination (Fig. 101:10; Photo 1 14:a). Bowls of this type were found at Tel Qashish only in Stratum VIIB. Type OB V: "Egg-shell" family and related bowls (Fig. 101:8). The"egg-shell" family or a closely related group is represented in Stratum VIIB only by one rim (Fig. 1 0 1 : 8). The type first occurs in Stratum IXB and is most common in Stratum VIII. Its final appearance can be related to the make-up of a Stratum VIIB floor, and it therefore probably originates in Stratum VIII. If so, then the last occur- rence of this type at Tel Qashish is in Stratum VIII. Kraters The kraters of Stratum VIIB belong to the open Types K I and K II as well as the closed Type CK Ib. Open kraters (K) Type K I: Simple vertical rim (Figs. 100: 10; 102:6). These kraters appear at Tel Qashish in Strata VIIB and VI. A krater of the same type was found at Mevorakh X. Type K II: Everted rim (Fig. 101:22). At Tel Qashish these kraters occur first in Stratum IXA and last in Stratum VIIB. 248</page><page sequence="288">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A Fig. 100.

Kraters of this type occur exclusively in Strata VIII and VIIB. Cooking Pots All the cooking pot rims found in Stratum VIIB are of the open Types CP I, CP Ha, CP lib, CP Ilia, CP Ille, CP IV, and CP V. The globular cooking pots (GCP), still in use in Stratum VIII, no longer appear in the Strata VIIB-V assem- blages. Type CP I: Gutter rim (Fig. 102:9-10, 20). These cooking pots occur first in Stratum IXA and last in Stratum VIIB. Type CP Ha: "Nail" rim (Fig. 102:22-23). This type occurs first in Stratum IXA and last in the fill layer of a Stratum VIIB floor, where it is apparently intrusive. Similar cooking pots were found in the fills of the ramparts at Tel Michal and in an assemblage dated to the end of the MB II at Jericho. Type CP lib: Grooved rim (Fig. 102:21). Cooking pots of this type characterize the Stratum VIII assemblages. The Stratum VIIB example found in the fill layer of floor L. 360 is apparently intrusive. If so, it can be maintained that Type CP lib is characteristic solely of Stratum VIII. The rim of this cooking pot is similar to that of Type K VIb kraters. Type CP Ilia: Simple triangular or wavy triangular rim (Figs. 101:15; 102:7, 19). Apart from one apparently intrusive example found in a Stratum IXB context, these 250</page><page sequence="290">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A cooking pots first occur in Stratum VIII and continue through Stratum V. Parallels were found at Megiddo in assemblages attributed to the beginning of the LB I (2116, T. 3013, T. 5021). Some have a high rounded carination {Megiddo II: Pis. 46:5; 55:2), while others have a carination in the middle of the wall {Megiddo II: PI. 55:4). The rims found in Stratum VIIB at Tel Qashish seem to belong to the variant with a carination in the middle of the wall (depicted in Fig. 101:15). Type CP lile: Short triangular rim (Fig. 102:18). This type first occurs in Stratum VIII and continues through Stratum V. A similar vessel was found at Megiddo (T. in 3069). Type CP IV: Cooking bowls (Fig. 100:11). This type occurs exclusively in Strata VIIB and VIIA. A similar vessel was found in an LB I pit (L. 7021) at Hazor {Hazor I: PI. CXXXIX:6). Yoqne'am also produced a similar vessel, with an ear handle (cf. Fig. 119:13), in a locus attributed to the LB I. It seems that this type occurs only in the LB I. Type CP V: Miniature cooking pots (Fig. 102:3). These cooking pots occur in Stratum VIIB. A similar vessel was found at Mevorakh XI in an LB I assemblage. Fig. 101.

Bowls from Stratum VIIB: a: Fig. 101:10; b: Fig. 101:12. Juglets The single juglet fragment found in Stratum VIIB (Fig. 100:14) apparently belongs to a dipper juglet of Type DJT III. This type occurs at Tel Qashish in Strata VIIB and VI. Jugs (J) The jugs found in Stratum VIIB are of Types J IIa, J III, and J VI. Type J IIa: Simple triangular rim (Figs. 100:15-17; 101:16-17; 102: 8). These jugs are the most common type in the Stratum VIIB assemblage. The type first occurs in Stratum X and last in Stratum VIIA. Similar rims belong both to jugs and amphoriskoi. Jug rims of Type J Ha were found at Megiddo in MB IIB assemblages (T. 2140, T. 3 122). An amphoriskos with a similar rim was found at Megiddo in an LB I and LB II assemblage (T. 3015). Another amphoriskos was found in Megiddo Tomb 877C1, which was in use for an extended period from the MB I through the Iron I. No exact parallel for the red-slipped jug of this type (Fig. 1 0 1 : 1 7) was found. A similar vessel, but white-slipped, was found in an LB I assemblage at Megiddo (21 14). Type J III: Triangular gutter rim (Fig. 99:5). These jugs were found at Tel Qashish in Strata IXB-VIII. As the rim is not trefoil, it could belong either to a jug or an amphoriskos. Amphoriskoi with similar rims were found at Megiddo in LB I assemblages (T. 855, T. 1 145B). Type J VI: Biconical (Fig. 1 00: 1 2-1 3). Fragments of two vessels of this type were found in.L. 80. No exact parallel was found for the jug with a modelled rim depicted in Fig. 100: 12. Biconical jugs with a similar decoration in two colors, consisting of horizontal bands on the neck and at the point of carination, with metopes formed by vertical bands enclosing wavy lines between them, were found in LB I tombs at Megiddo (T. 855, T. 1 145B). This decorative motif on biconical jugs apparently continues into the LB II at Megiddo ( Megiddo Tombs 101: PI. 55:1) and Beth-Shean (Tomb 29A-C [Gonen 1979:79]). The rim of the biconical jug depicted in Fig. 100:12 resembles that of Type K Via kraters, Type CP IIa cooking pots, and Type P IVa pithoi. The rim of the second jug (Fig. 1 00: 1 3) is similar to that of the LB II jugs found in the Lower City at Hazor (Stratum 1 [Hazor I : PI. CXXVIII:11]). A similar jug was found at Megiddo in a tomb containing vessels attributed to the MB I, LB I, and LB II (T. 989A1). The decoration on the jug depicted in Fig. 100:13 was very poorly preserved: the remains of a horned animal are discernible to the left of the handle; to the left of this animal is a clear geometric pattern of vertical lines with dots between them; and to the left of this pattern is another depiction that may also possibly represent an animal. Although the decoration of biconical jugs in the LB I was generally executed in two colors, there are also examples decorated in one color (e.g., from LB I Tomb 1 145B at Megiddo). Storage Jars (SJ) The Stratum VIIB storage jar assemblage includes both decorated and undecorated examples of Types S J Vila, SJ Vllb, and SJ IX. Some of the storage jars are decorated with horizontal bands (Figs. 100:21-23; 102:4), and some include an additional wavy line at the base of the neck (Fig. 100:21). The wavy line decoration on storage jars occurs at Tel Qashish in Strata VIIB, VIIA (Fig. 104: 1 8) and VI (Fig. 109:4; Photo 124:d), and at a number of sites on the Coastal Plain, e.g., Tel Michal (Tel Michal 1989: Fig. 5.9:6) and Tell Abu Hawam {Tell Abu Hawam 1 980: Pl. 1 3 : 1 , 3-4), and at Ugarit (Schaeffer 1978: Fig. 7:7). Type SJ Vila: Simple ring rim (Figs. 100:18-19, 22; 101:4). This type first occurs in Stratum IXA and constitutes the most common storage jar type in Stratum VIIA-V. Type S J Vllb: Inturned ring rim (Fig. 100:21). Storage jars of this type occur first in Stratum IXB and last in Stratum VIIB. This Stratum VIIB example is decorated in two colors, which is characteristic of the LB I. 253</page><page sequence="293">CHAPTER 15 Fig. 102.

Pithoi (P) The pithos rims found in the fill layers beneath the floor of L. 360 belong to Types P I and P IVa (Fig. 102:24-25). It seems, however, that these are intrusive and do not belong to Stratum VIIB. Chocolate-on- White Ware Only a few fragments of Chocolate-on- White ware vessels were found at Tel Qashish (Fig. 99:6-7; Photo 1 1 5), in the fill beneath the Stratum VIIB floors (see summary below).

A very similar vessel found in the fill of the glacis at Shiloh is dated by the excavators to the end of the MB II (Brandl 1993:223-224). The two vessels from Megiddo and Jericho cited by Brandl as parallels for the Shiloh example feature a spout or neck in the shape of a horned animal, but the model- ling of the head is different. Imported Vessels Stratum VIIB assemblages produced number of vessels belonging to the Bichrome, Monochrome, and Base Ring families. Bichrome ware The earliest fragment of a Bichrome vessel found at Tel Qashish comes from Stratum IXA. Additional fragments were found in Stratum VIIB (Fig. 102: 12) and Stratum VIIA (Fig. 107:8). The pétrographie analysis of the fragments from Strata IXA and VIIA shows that they originated in Cyprus (A. Cohen, personal communication). Monochrome ware The two Monochrome bowls from Stratum VIIB (Fig. 102:5, 1 1) are of Types IFB and IJB (or JC), according to Gittlen's classification (1977). Type IFB (Fig. 102:5). This is the most common type found in Israel. It already occurs in MB II and its frequency increases in LB I assemblages (Gittlen 1977:304-306, 311-320, 323-324). Type IJB (or JC) (Fig. 102: 11). This is the most common type found on Cyprus, though in Israel it is secondary to Type IFB. It occurs in LB I assemblages (Gittlen 1977:304-306, 311-320, 323-324). Photo 116.

This juglet belongs to Gittlen's Type VID la. The ridge on the neck, where the handle meets it, characterizes Base Ring I jugs and juglets (Gittlen 1977:46-47). Juglets of Type VI are the most common imported Base Ring I vessel in Israel and Egypt, while on Cyprus they comprise only about one third of the vessels of this family. Type VI initially appears in Israel in LB I assemblages and becomes widely distrib- uted by the beginning of the LB II (Gittlen 1977:46-47, 49, 68-71, 105). 2. The base of the jug depicted in Fig. 100:24 lacks special features, and it therefore cannot be ascertained whether it belongs to a Base Ring I or Base Ring II vessel. Fig. 103. Stratum VIIB: L. 89.

In terms of local ware, these include bowls of Types B Illbl and B VIc; open carinated bowls of Type OB III; open kraters of Type K I; open cooking pots of Type CP IV; and jugs of Type J VI. The imported ware includes Monochrome and Base Ring vessels. Since the two Chocolate-on- White Ware fragments were found in the fill between Stratum VIII and Stratum VIIB, the exact strati- graphic context of this group at Tel Qashish cannot be deter- mined. Alongside these vessels, other types were found that already occur in strata preceding Stratum VIIB: bowls of Type B lb, B Ilia, B IVa, B Via, and B VIb; open carinated bowls of Type OB II; closed kraters of Type CK lb; open kraters of Type K II; cooking pots of Types CP I, CP Ha, CP lib, CP Illa, CP lile, and CP IV; jugs of Types J IIa and J III; and storage jars of Types SJ Vila and SJ Vllb. Although some of the Stratum VIIB vessels have parallels in LB II assemblages (at Megiddo and Beth-Shean) or in those spanning from the end of the MB II to the LB I (at Megiddo), parallels for most of the vessels come from LB I assemblages (at Megiddo and Mevorakh XI). The imported vessels from Stratum VIIB (Bichrome, Monochrome, and Base Ring I) also fit within this period. STRATUM VIIA STRATIGRAPHY (Plans 36-37) The main loci are L. 1 8, L. 72A, L. 356, L. 350, and the tabun L. 358. There is no major change in the plan, which in Stratum VIIA is more complete and suggests that all the loci in Squares S-V/16-17 probably belong to the same unit, as may already have been the case in Stratum VIIB. The two complete cooking pots found in L. 72A seem to indicate that it served as an unroofed cooking area, while L. 7 1 to the east may have been a living unit, as suggested by the fine ceramic finds originating in L. 80 of Stratum VIIB, immediately below L. 7 1 . Thus, the functional division between these two units established in Stratum VIIB may have continued in Stratum VIIA. W. 90 is anew wall, defining L. 70 and L. 356 on the south. This area seems to have been a large courtyard: W. 33A, built on top of W. 33B and continuing it eastwards, delimits the courtyard on the north. The courtyard is divided into two parts: the eastern L. 356 was stone-paved and at least partially covered, with the roof supported by two pillars; and L. 70, in which tabun L. 358 was found (Photo 117), was unroofed. The courtyard was probably entered from the south, through an opening in W. 90, the eastern doorjamb of which can be seen in the balk. Since the area south of W. 90 Plan 36. Area A: Stratum VIIA.

Stratum VII A courtyard. was not excavated, the southern edge of the unit and whether L. 350 was a part of it cannot be determined. The entrance seems to have been blocked at a certain stage by a wall built of small stones. The placement of the oven in the corner of W. 6 and W. 10 in Stratum VIIB is changed in Stratum VIIA to the corner of W. 8 and W. 10. The unit to the east of W. 10 appears not to have been connected with that to its west, given the blocking of the Stratum VIIB entrance. Pit L. 78 was dug into W. 33A. This pit is attributed to Stratum VI, indicating that the wall delim- iting the courtyard on the north went out of use in this phase. THE CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE (Figs. 104-107) Bowls Open bowls (B) The open bowls found in Stratum VIIA belong to Types B la, B II, B Illa, B Illbl, B IVa, B Va, and B Via. Type B la: Simple rounded rim (Figs. 105:1-2 [Photo 118]; 106:1). These bowls comprise the most common type in the Stratum VIIA assemblage. In general, they are not decorated, though two are, one in two colors (Fig. 1 05 :2) and the other in one color (Fig. 106:1). The bowl base found in L. 350 (Fig. 105:4) is very similar to the bowl type depicted Photo 118. Bowl decorated with bands in two colors (Fig. 105:2). in Fig. 105:2. Type B la first occurs in Stratum VIII and continues through Stratum V. A bowl resembling the example depicted in Fig. 105:2 was found in an assemblage of indeterminate date at Megiddo (W=5083). Bowls of Type Bla have either a flat (Fig. 105:1) or a ring base (Fig. 105:2). Type B II: Sharpened rim (Figs. 104:2; 107:2). Bowls of Type B II were found at Tel Qashish exclusively in Strata VIII and VIIA. A smaller and deeper bowl of this type was found at Mevorakh X. The tendency toward reduction in size and deepening in LB II bowls was already noted by Tufnell (Lachish IV: 181). Type B Ilia: Small inwards-folded rim (Fig. 104:3). These bowls occur at Tel Qashish from Stratum IXA through Stratum V. Type B Illbl: Large inwards-folded rim (Fig. 106:2). This type occurs at Tel Qashish in Strata VIIB and VIIA. Some of the large bowls of this type may belong to chalices (e.g., Megiddo II: PI. 55:16, 19). Type B IVa: Simple cut rim (Figs. 104:1 [Photo 119]; 107:1). This type occurs at Tel Qashish from Stratum IXC through Stratum VI. Similar bowls were found at Megiddo in assemblages attributed to the LB I (T. 2098, 2114, 2115, = 5239) and to the LB II (3102), and at Mevorakh XI. Photo 119. Bowl (Fig. 104:1). Type B Va: Rounded everted rim, without slip or burnish (Fig. 107:10-11). Bowls of this type first occur in Stratum IXA and continue through Stratum VI. The diameter of the Tel Qashish Stratum VIIA examples does not exceed 30 cm. Parallels come from an MB II assemblage (T. 3076) and an assemblage that could be assigned to either Stratum VIII or Stratum VII at Megiddo (W=5023). Type B Via: Rounded everted rim, without slip or burnish (Fig. 1 06:5). Bowls of this type were found in Strata IXC, IXA, and VIIB-V. Open carinated bowls (OB) All the carinated bowls in the Stratum VIIA assemblages are of the open Type OB lib (Fig. 104:5). These bowls occur at Tel Qashish exclusively in Strata VIIA and VI. Similar bowls were found at Megiddo in assemblages apparently belonging to Stratum VIII (3006, 4084), and in assemblages that the excavators attribute to Stratum VIIB, but the stratigraphie context of which is uncertain (3101 west on floor, W=5023). Kraters Open kraters (K) The kraters found in Stratum VIIA assemblages are of the open Types K Illb and K IV. 258</page><page sequence="298">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A Fig. 104.

This type was found at Tel Qashish exclusively in Stratum VIIA. It is unusually large and made of greenish clay. Type K IV: Triangular rim (Fig. 104:9-10). These kraters first occur in Stratum VIIA and continue in Stratum VI and in a fill attributed to Stratum V. It should be noted that beginning in Stratum IXA, some kraters are similar in shape to cooking pots: the Type K IV kraters resemble the Type CP Ilia cooking pots. Cooking Pots All the cooking pots found in Stratum VIIA at Tel Qashish are of the open Types CP Ilia, CP Illb, CP IIIc, and CP IV. Type CP Ilia: Simple triangular or wavy triangular rim (Figs. 104:12-13; 107:12-14). This type first occurs in Stratum IXB, where it is apparently intrusive. It seems that its initial appearance should be attributed to Stratum VIII. It is the most common type in Strata VIIA-V. Parallels come from LB I assemblages at Megiddo (2116, 5021, =5239). Type CP Illb: Everted triangular rim (Fig. 106:7-8 [Photo 120]). Cooking pots of this type appear first in Stratum VIIA and last in Stratum VI. Similar cooking pots were found at Tel Michal in an LB I assemblage ( Tel Michal: 38-39). Type CP IIIc: Thin triangular rim (Fig. 104:11). The only example of this type at Tel Qashish was found in Stratum VIIA. A similar cooking pot was found at Mevorakh X. Type CP IV: Cooking bowls (Fig. 107:3). These cooking bowls were found at Tel Qashish exclusively in Stratum VIIB-A assemblages. A cooking bowl was found in an LB I pit (L. 7021) at Hazor ( Hazor I: PI. CXXXIX:6). Yoqne'am also produced a similar vessel, with an ear handle (cf. Fig. 119:13), in a locus attributed to the LB I.

They seem to be intrusive in Stratum VIIA. Jugs (J) The Stratum VIIA jugs are represented by rims of Types J I and J Ha and by a red-slipped and burnished jug without a rim (Fig. 105:5; Photo 121:b). Two jugs resembling the latter were found at Megiddo, but these are not red-slipped or burnished. One originates in an LB I assemblage (T. 258), and the other in an assemblage of indeterminate date (T. 989A1). Type J I: Dipper jugs with a simple pinched rim (Fig. 105:6; Photo 121 :a). Jugs of this type occur at Tel Qashish from Stratum IXA through Stratum VI. Similar jugs were found at Megiddo in assemblages attributed to the MB II, the beginning of the LB I (2 1 1 7) and the LB I (2 1 1 6, T. 3013), and at Mevorakh XI. Type J IIa: Simple triangular rim (Figs. 104:16; 105:7; 1 07 :4). This type occurs first in Stratum X and last in Stratum VIIA. Storage Jars (SJ) The storage jars found in Stratum VILA belong to Types SJ I, SJ IVc, and SJ Vila. Type SJ I: Simple everted rim (Fig. 106:3). Storage jars of this type first occur in Stratum IXC and are especially common in Stratum IXB. They cease to appear thereafter, except for this single rim in Stratum VIIA, which is probably intrusive. Type SJ IVc: Ridge at base of gutter rim (Fig. 106:4). This SJ IVc fragment is probably intrusive in Stratum VIIA. Type SJ Vila: Simple ring rim (Fig. 104:17-18). Storage jars of this type first occur in Stratum IXA and become the most common type in Strata VI-V. The storage jar depicted in Fig. 104:18 is decorated in two colors in a pattern similar to that on a storage jar from Stratum VI (Fig. 109:4; Photo 124:d). 261</page><page sequence="301">Fig. 106.

Milk bowls. The milk bowl fragment (Fig. 105:8) appar- ently belongs to the White Slip I type (R. Merrillees, personal communication), which evidently reached Israel in the first half of the LB I. It becomes increasingly common at the end of the LB I but is absent in LB II assemblages (Gittlen 1977:404, 415-416). Summary: Stratum VIIA The ceramic assemblage of Stratum VIL^. is similar to that of Stratum VIIB. Some of the vessels first occur in Stratum IXA (bowls of Types B Ilia and B Va; jugs of Type J I; and storage jars of Type SJ Vila); others first appear in Stratum VIII (bowls of Type B II; open kraters of Type K III; and appar- ently cooking pots of Type CP Ilia); and others first occur in Stratum VIIB (bowls of Type B Illbl; and cooking pots of Type CPV). Alongside these vessels, the assemblage includes types that first appear in Stratum VIIA (open kraters of Type K IV and cooking pots of Types CP Illb and CP IIIc). Type CP IIIc was found exclusively in Stratum VIIA, while cooking pots of Type CP Illb also occur in Stratum VI. Most of the jugs and juglets found in Stratum VIIA have a long lifespan. Jugs of Type J Ha first occur in Stratum X and continue in Strata IXC-IXB and VIIB-VIIA. Their absence in Strata IXA- VIII is probably fortuitous. Most of the parallels for the Stratum VIIA vessels come from assemblages attributed to the LB I, although some vessels have parallels in LB II assemblages. The latter, however, also have LB I parallels. The fragments of imported vessels found in this stratum - Bichrome ware, Monochrome ware, and milk bowls - also fit with an LB I dating. Since the Stratum VI assemblage is attributed to the begin- ning of the LB II (see below), it is reasonable to date Stratum VIIA to the LB I and to consider it a direct continuation of the earlier Stratum VIIB. This continuity is also apparent in the architecture. The structures built in Stratum VIIB continue in use in Stratum VIIA with only minor changes, while new structures were built in Stratum VI. It thus appears that the settlement at Tel Qashish underwent a major change in the aftermath of its destruction or abandonment at the end of the LB I, and was rebuilt according to a new plan at the beginning of the LB II. STRATUM VI STRATIGRAPHY (Plan 38) All the Stratum VII walls are phased out and replaced by a square, tower-like structure measuring 3X2.5 m in Square U/15-16 (Photos 117, 122). Thus, there is no architectural continuity between Strata VII and VI, just as there is no continuity between Stratum VI and the later strata above it. The walls of the tower-like structure have the same 264</page><page sequence="304">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A Flan 38. Area A: Stratum VI. orientation as the previous Stratum VII walls and a differerent orientation from the walls of the later strata. The pottery associated with this structure, especially L. 244+349 (+L. 4+11), clearly dates it to the LB II (Figs. 108-1 11; Photos 124-125). The function of this struc- ture remains unclear, and no surface was discerned in the small space within it, which may be a constructional feature. Given its location on the edge of the northern slope of the mound, the structure may have had a defensive function, but the modest width of the walls seems to make this interpreta- tion rather doubtful. An Iron Age pit (L. 305 [Fig. 140:7-9]), a Persian pit (L. 55 [Fig. 140: 1 ]), and three pits of the Islamic period (L. 5, 7, and 9 [Fig. 154:7-9]) caused considerable damage to the Stratum VI remains. South of the tower-like structure, and associated with it, stone pavement L. 244 (Photos 122-123) and a beaten earth floor L. 57, 56, and 315 were found. The many oven fragments found in L. 315 and several cooking pots found in nearby pavement L. 244 indicate that this area served as an unroofed cooking area. The dwellings were probably located to the south of the paved area. THE CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE (Figs. 108-112) Bowls Open bowls (B) The open bowls of Stratum VI belong to Types B la, B Ilia, B IIIb2, B IVa, B Va, and B Vid. Type B la: Simple rounded rim (Figs. 108:1, 6; 111:3; 1 12:2). These bowls first occur in Stratum VIII and become very common in Stratum VI. It should be noted that the diameter of the bowls of this type in Strata VIIB-V is ca. 20 cm, considerably smaller than that of the Stratum VIII Type B la bowls (ca. 35 cm). Similar bowls were found at Megiddo in Stratum VIII. The footed bowl (Fig. 108:6; Photo 124:j) has a simple rounded rim and thus belongs to Type B la, although it differs 265 T U V ^ U H I I i I 5 I 1 i I _L ' ® - y^&gt;7' e 2-5=V, ; ! 1 O L„ : 54.65 I 1 I ».

Since most of the bowls found at Tel Qashish are incomplete, it cannot be ascertained which rims belong to bowls with a concave disc base (Fig. 108:1) and which to bowls with a high foot (Fig. 108:6; Photo 124:j). Consequently, all the simple rounded rims are considered as Type B la. Type B Ilia: Small inwards-folded rim (Figs. 111:8; 112:9). These bowls first occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA. As noted in the case of the Stratum VI Type B la examples, the Type B Ilia bowls of Strata VIIB-V are smaller than the examples from Strata. IXA-VIII. Type B IIIb2: Large inwards-folded rim (Fig. 108:7; Photo 124:h). Only one such bowl was found at Tel Qashish. Three similar bowls were found at Lachish in Fosse Temple II and three more in Fosse Temple III ( Lachish II: Pis. XXXIXB:68; XLIIB: 135). It therefore seems that bowls of Type B IIIb2 occur exclusively in LB II assemblages. Type B IVa: Simple cut-rim (Figs. 111:1-2; 112:1, 7-8, 14). Bowls of this type already occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXC and become especially common in Stratum VIIB. Similar bowls were found at Megiddo in exclusively LB I assemblages. Thus, the Stratum VI bowls of this type are probably intrusive, apparently originating in Stratum VII. Type B Va: Rounded everted rim, without slip or burnish (Figs. 108:2-5; 112:15). These bowls first occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA, becoming increasingly common until they peak in Stratum VI, and disappear there- after. The diameter of the Stratum VI bowls does not exceed 20 cm. Parallels for the Stratum VI examples were found at Megiddo in MB II assemblages and in those attibutable to Stratum VIII. Consequently, these bowls cannot serve as a criterion for dating. Type B VId: Elongated thickened rim (Fig. 111:7). A bowl of this type was found at Tel Qashish only in Stratum VI. Open carinated bowls (OB) All the carinated bowls found in Stratum VI belong to Types OB lib and OB IV. Type OB lib: Slight carination (Fig. 112:16). Most of the carinated bowls from Stratum VI belong to Type OB lib. The type first occurs at Tel Qashish in Stratum VILA and its appearance seems to be limited to Strata VIIA and VI. Similar bowls were found at Megiddo in Stratum VIII assemblages and in others that may belong either to Stratum Vili or IX. Type OB IV: Simple straight rims and degenerate cari- nation (Fig. 111:9). Two carinated bowls of this type were found at Tel Qashish, only one of which (the Stratum VI example) derives from a clear stratigraphie context. The second example was found at the bottom of the Persian period pit (Fig. 140:5; Photo 128). This bowl possibly origi- nated on the floors of L. 56 and L. 57, which are attributed to Stratum VI. The bowl is decorated with painted bands in two colors, like the carinated bowl from Taanach (Sellin 1905: Fig. 21). 268</page><page sequence="308">Fig. 109. Stratum VI: L. 244+L. 349.

Type K IV: Triangular rim (Fig. 111:11). Kraters of this type first occur in Stratum VIIA. One such rim was found in a fill attributed to Stratum V.

These cooking pots belong to the Type CP III sub-types CP Ilia, CP Illb, CP IHd, and CP IHe. Type CP Ilia: Simple triangular or wavy triangular rim (Figs. 108:10-13; 112:19). This is the most common cooking pot type in Stratum VI, as in the previous stratum. It first occurs in Stratum VIII and continues through Stratum V. The type has two sub-classes: the simple triangular rim (Figs. 108:10 [Photo 124:m]-ll; 112:19) and the "wavy" triangular rim (Fig. 108:12-13 [Photo 124:1]). Cooking pots of the "wavy" rim sub-class were found in an LB I assem- blage from Fosse Temple I at Lachish and in an LB II assem- blage at Hazor. The type should therefore bé dated to the LB I-LB II. Type CP Illb: Everted triangular rim (Fig. 108:14). Cooking pots of this type were found at Tel Qashish only in Strata VILA, and VI. The dating of these vessels to the LB II is supported by parallels from Mevorakh X and Pella IV. Type CP IHd: Folded triangular rim (Figs. 111:4; 112:10-11). This type first occurs in Stratum VI and continues into Stratum V. The cooking pots of this type found in Stratum VI come from loci disturbed by later pits. It is therefore possible that the CP IHd sherds found in Stratum VI originate in Stratum V. Type CP IHe: Short triangular rim (Figs. 108:9 [Photo 124:k]; 111:12; 112:18). Cooking pots of this type occur at Tel Qashish from Stratum IXA through Stratum V. Parallels come from LB I assemblages at Tell Abu Hawam, Hazor, and Lachish. The fact that a complete cooking pot of this type was found in a Stratum VI assemblage at Tel Qashish indicates that the type continued to appear in the LB II. Juglets Like the other strata at Tel Qashish, Stratum VI produced only a small number of juglets. These include two dipper juglets of Types DJT II and DJT III (a complete vessel) and a juglet of Type BJT. Type DJT II: Simple pinched everted rim (Fig. 1 1 1 : 1 3). The single dipper juglet featuring an everted rim found at Tel Qashish comes from Stratum VI. Type DJT III: Pinched inturned rim (Fig. 111:5). This type first occurs at Tel Qashish in Stratum VIIB. This dipper juglet apparently replaced Type DJT I, which occurs mainly in the Strata IXC-VIII assemblages. Type BJT: Ring base (Fig. 112:13;Photo 126). Due to the small dimensions of this vessel, it was classified as a juglet rather than a jug, to which it is more similar in shape. Only one complete juglet of this type was found at Tel Qashish. Its decoration resembles that of an example from Megiddo VIII {Megiddo II: PI. 59:2). Another juglet, similar in shape but undecorated, was also found in the same locus at Megiddo (Megiddo II: PI. 57:7). These juglets are probably imitations of Bichrome ware juglets (see, e.g., Megiddo II: PI. 49: 1-2). Jugs (J) The Stratum VI jugs at Tel Qashish belong to Types J I, J IVc, J V, and J VII (Miscellaneous). Type J I: Dipper jug with simple pinched rim (Fig. 109:1; Photo 124:e). Jugs of this type already occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA. Exact parallels for the example from L. 244, with a ridge at the base of its neck, are not known. The same assemblage includes the lower part of 271</page><page sequence="311">CHAPTER 15 Fig. 111. Stratum VI: L. 1 1 and L. 4. another jug (Fig. 109:2; Photo 124:f), probably also of Type J I. Type J IVc: Small, thickened folded rim (Fig. 112:3). Jugs of this type first occur in Stratum VI, but are especially common in Stratum V. Type J V: Modelled rim (Figs. 1 1 1 : 14; 1 12:4). Two jugs of this type appear in Stratum VI. Type J VII: Miscellaneous - thickened and inverted rim (Fig. 111:6). This type was found only in Stratum VI. No exact parallels are known. Type J VII: Miscellaneous - biconical with a high neck (Fig. 111:15). Tel Qashish produced a single high- necked biconical jug, white-slipped and decorated with brown paint. The decoration was very poorly preserved, but it can be surmised that it consisted of metopes formed by vertical lines. A similar jug decorated in two colors was found at Megiddo (T. 78). A large group of high-necked jugs was found in the Northern Cemetery at Beth-Shean, most in Tomb 27 (Oren 1973: Fig. 36:3-13) and two in Tomb 29A (Oren 1973: Fig. 39:21-22). The majority feature everted rims (Oren 1973: Figs. 36:3, 8-9, 13; 39:21-22), while a few have triangular rims (Oren 1973: Fig. 36:11-12). With one exception, all the Beth-Shean examples are decorated with various geometric designs on the shoulder (from the point of 272</page><page sequence="312">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND POTTERY ASSEMBLAGES OF THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES IN AREA A Photo 125.

Some are decorated in a single color (Oren 1973: Figs. 36:5-6, 10-12; 39:21-22), others in two colors (Oren 1973: Fig. 36:7-9, 13). Two of the tombs were originally hewn in EB IV and reused in the LB II, apparently in the 14th century (Tomb 27 also produced LB I vessels and had evidence of Roman period interment as well). Oren notes that high-necked jugs are rare in Israel and apparently imitate the Anatolian-Cilician type of the MB II. In his view, these jugs can be divided into two sub-classes: 1 . The Early Type: delicate jugs of proportions similar to those from Anatolia, with handles that are large in relation to their body size, an especially long neck, and a ring base. This type occurs in Israel in the 15th century. 2. The Late Type: coarser jugs that feature a shorter neck than that of the previous type and a broad, flat or concave disc base. Jugs of this type are mainly found in assemblages attributed to the 14th century (Oren 1973:80-81). Since the upper part of the Tel Qashish example is missing, it is difficult to ascertain whether it belongs to the early or late type. Its low ring base, however, differs from the ring bases characteristic of the early type, and it therefore appears closer to the late type. Storage Jars (SJ) The Stratum VI storage jars belong to Types S J Vila (the majority) and SJ Vile. Type SJ Vila: Simple ring rim (Figs. 110:1-2, 4 [Photo 124:a-b]; 111:16; 112:20 [Photo 127]). Storage jars of this type first occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA and become the most common type in Strata VIIA-V. Only two complete storage jars were found in Stratum VI (Figs. 110:l;Photo 124:a; 112:20). Other storage jars similar to the example decorated in two colors (Fig. 112:20; Photo 127) were found in Strata VIIB and VI. A small storagejar resembling the example depicted in Fig. 112:20 was found at Megiddo in Stratum VIII. Type SJ Vile: Rounded ring rim (Fig. 110:3). An almost complete storage jar of this type was found in Stratum VI. Imported Vessels Two fragments of Cypriot vessels were found in Stratum VI. One belongs to a bowl of Base Ring ware (Fig. 110:7) of Type IFa, according to Gittlen's classification. This type first occurs in Israel in the LB I (Gittlen 1977:130). The second fragment belongs to a dipper juglet of White Shaved ware (Fig. 112:21). These juglets occur in Israel at the end of the LB I (the phase Gittlen terms "post-Thuthmosis III"), and reach their peak in the LB IIA. They continue in the LB IIB, but decline in frequency (Gittlen 1977:348, 353). Summary: Stratum VI Most of the Stratum VI vessels at Tel Qashish already appear in earlier assemblages. Vessels that occur in Stratum VI for the first time include bowls of Types B IIIb2 and B VId; carinated bowls of Type OB IV; cooking pots of Type CP Hid; dipper juglets of Type DJT II; and jugs of Type J IVc. Of these, only the Type CP Illd cooking pots and the Type J IVc jugs also appear in Stratum V. The other vessels were found exclusively in Stratum VI. Nevertheless, it should noted that the Stratum V assemblage is very limited, and it 275</page><page sequence="315">CHAPTER 15 therefore cannot be decisively established exactly when these vessels ceased to appear at Tel Qashish. The types that appear for the first time in Stratum VI can be divided into two main groups. The first comprises vessels with a long lifespan, including types that first appear in Stratum IXC (bowls of Types B IVa and B Via); those that first occur in Stratum IXA (bowls of Types B lb and B Illal, cooking pots of Type CP lile, and storage jars of Type SJ Vila); and those that first occur in Stratum VIII (bowls of Type B la and cooking pots of Type CP Ilia). The second group includes vessels that first occur in Stratum VIIB (dipper juglets of Type DJT III and storage jars of Type SJ Vllb) and those that first appear in Stratum VIIA (carinated bowls of Type OB IIb, open kraters of Type K IV, and cooking pots of Type CP Illb). Parallels for the Stratum VI vessels come from assem- blages attributed to the LB I and the first half of the LB II (corresponding to Megiddo VIII). Stratum VI at Tel Qashish should therefore be dated to the first half of the LB II. The fragments of imported ware found in Stratum VI (the Base Ring bowl and White Shaved dipper juglet) also fit well with this dating. 276</page><page sequence="316">CHAPTER 16 POTTERY TYPOLOGY OF THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE II AND THE LATE BRONZE AGE Ruhama Bonfil Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem A detailed examination of the ceramic assemblages from the Middle and Late Bronze Age allows the tracing of the devel- opment of the vessel types over the time-span under discus- sion and where possible their chronological classification on the basis of their assignment to clear stratigraphie contexts (see stratigraphy in Chapter 15 above). Since most the types are represented solely by rims, which, as a result of digging foundation trenches, burials, etc., may be displaced from one stratum to another, caution should be exercised in the chronological-stratigraphic attri- bution of the various types. It is generally easier to establish when a type first appeared than when its manufacture ceased. Establishing the dating of the first appearance of the various types is largely based on comparative research, examining the occurrence of each type at diverse sites. Since, however, there are regional differences among the various vessel types (Kempinski 1983:181-196; P. Beck 1985b:200; Maeir 1997:3, 104), the following comparative study relates mainly to sites in the vicinity of Tel Qashish, that is, those in the Jezreel Valley and the northern coastal plain (Plan 1 ). The most important site for this study, in that it provides a complete continuum of strata contemporaneous with those considered below, is Tel Yoqne'am. At the time of writing, however, it is unfortunately not possible to establish exten- sive correlations with this site, because its ceramic analysis is only in the preliminary stages. As a result, only a few isolated examples can be offered for comparison. For the purposes of dating, whenever necessary, comparisons with vessels found further afield, such as at Tel Hazor and Tel Aphek, have been used. The latter has a stratigraphie continuum covering most of the Middle Bronze Age, and thus can helpňn defining the various phases of this period at Tel Qashish. All the MB II and Late Bronze Age vessels and rims found at Tel Qashish (totalling around 500) were counted. This allows for the determination not only of the first and last appearances of the various types, but also their frequency, which, as will be seen, sometimes proves meaningful for relative chronology. However, the number of assemblages from these periods is small, as is the number of vessels and their types. Consequently, each type is represented by only very few examples. All the ceramic finds originating in assemblages attrib- uted to Strata X-VI[V] were assigned to the same typo- logical scheme based on vessel shape (Figs. 113-124). Complete vessels are rare at Tel Qashish, and most are repre- sented exclusively by rims; the rim, therefore, is an impor- tant (and sometimes the only) feature used to define the type. The count was limited to "clean" assemblages from the various strata. Each stratum was divided into three catego- ries, based on the following criteria: 1. Vessels originating on floors. 2. Vessels found directly beneath floors (in their make-up). 3 . Vessels originating in the fill above a floor, but below the make-up of the next stratum's floor. The results of the vessel and rim counts are presented in Tables 20-24 (pp. 313-317). References to parallels for the vessels usually appear in the tables accompanying the pottery figures in the discussion on the stratigraphy and ceramic assemblages; in some cases, however, a parallel for a certain type is also cited in the context of the typological discussion. BOWLS Figs. 113-114, Table 20 The bowls are divided into three main families, within which they are further subdivided into types and sub-classes: 1. Open bowls (B). 2. Open carinated bowls (OB). 3. Closed carinated bowls (CB). 1. OPEN BOWLS (B) Type B I: Simple rounded rim (Fig. 113:1-6). Some of the bowls assigned to this group are red-slipped and burnished, characteristic of the MB II. Accordingly, we subdivided the Type B I bowls into two sub-classes: 1. Type B la: Simple rounded rim. 2. Type B lb: Red-slipped and burnished bowls with a simple rounded rim. Type B la: Simple rounded rim (Fig. 113:1-5). These rims come from bowls with a ring base (Fig. 113:1-2 [Photo 135], 4), a flat base (Fig. 113:3), or a high stem (Fig. 113:5 [Photo 124:j]). Most of the Type B la bowls are classified on the basis of their rims and hence cannot be further subdivided into sub-classes on the basis of shape. The majority are not decorated, but some that feature painted concentric circles originate in assemblages attributed to Stratum VIIA (Figs. 105:2; 106:1; 113:4 [Photo 118]). The similarly decorated base (Fig. 105:4) apparently also belongs to a Type B la bowl. Bowls of Type B la occur at Tel Qashish in Strata VIII-V. It should be noted that their diameter in Strata VIIB-V is ca. 20 cm, considerably less than that of the Stratum VIII examples, which are ca. 35 cm in diameter. This phenomenon accords with Tufhell's obser- vation ( Lachish IV: 1 8 1 ) that Late Bronze Age bowls exhibit 277</page><page sequence="317">CHAPTER 16 an ongoing tendency towards size reduction and deepening over time. The tendency towards deepening at the end of the LB II is confirmed by the Type B la examples found at Tel Qashish; compare the bowls of Strata VIIA-VI (Figs. 105:1-2 [Photo 118]; 106:1; 108:1, 6; 111:3; 112:2) with those of the Stratum V assemblage (Fig. 127:1; Photo 135). Type B lb: Simple rounded rim, red-slipped and burnished (Fig. 113:6). These bowls usually have a ring base. Complete examples of this type were not found at Tel Qashish, but all the B lb bowls at Megiddo have a ring base ( Megiddo II: Pis. 29:30; 38:5, 8-9; 45:11, 13-15). Bowls of this type first occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA and continue through Stratum VIIB. The Stratum VIIB bowls have parallels in the MB IIB assemblages (especially from the end of this period) and in Tomb 3070 at Megiddo, where most the vessels are of MB IIB date, although some can be attributed to the LB I. It can accordingly be suggested that the B lb bowls from Tel Qashish belong to Strata IXA and VIII assemblages. It should be noted that these bowls are red- slipped and burnished, characteristics that are not typical of LB I vessels (Stratum VIIB at Tel Qashish), implying that these rims originate in earlier horizons (probably Stratum IXA or VIII). Type B II: Sharpened rim (Fig. 113:7). Such bowls have: 1. Open sides. 2. A disc or flat base. 3. A diameter of ca. 25 cm. Bowls of this type occur at Tel Qashish in Strata VIII and VIIA. Type B III: Inwards-folded rim (Fig. 113:8 [Photo 97:e], 9-11). The inwards-folded rim characterizes two classes of bowls: 1. Type B Ilia: Bowls with a diameter of ca. 20-25 cm. 2. Type B Illb: Bowls with a diameter of ca. 35 cm. Type B Ilia: Small with inwards-folded rim (Fig. 113:8 [Photo 97:e], 9). Such bowls have: 1. Rounded sides. 2. A diameter of ca. 20-25 cm. 3. Ring bases (Megiddo II: Pis. 29:23; 38:1) or disc bases (from Tel Qashish, Fig. 91:7 [Phôto99:a]; from Megiddo, Megiddo II: PI. 37:14-15). Similar rims also occur on chalices ( Mevorakh II: Fig. 1:20-22). Type B Ilia first occurs at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA, continuing through Stratum V. Despite its generally long chronological range, this class includes several bowls with a more narrowly definable time-span: A. Red-slipped (and sometimes burnished) bowls occur in Strata IXA-VIII, that is, in the MB II (Figs. 91:7 [Photo 99:a]; 94:1). B. Bowls painted with concentric circles in two colors occur in Strata VIIB and VI, that is, in the LB I- II (Figs. 100:2; 112:9). C. Bowls with a lengthened inwards-folded rim occur only in Stratum VI, that is, in the first half of the LB II (Figs. 111:8; 112:9). Type B Illb: Large with inwards-folded rim (Fig. 113:10-11 [Photo 124:h]). Such bowls have: 1 . Rounded sides. 2. A diameter of ca. 35 cm. These rims occur both on chalices (Megiddo II: Pis. 55:19) and bowls, such as the example depicted in Fig. 113:11 (Photo 124:h). The bowls from Tel Qashish also have two handles, and we therefore decided to distinguish this class from the other Type B Illb bowls, designating it Type B IIIb2 and the others Type B Illb 1 . Type B Illbl occurs at Tel Qashish in assemblages attributed to Strata VIIA, VIIB, and V. Type B IIIb2 is found only in an assemblage attributed to Stratum VI, and, on the basis of its parallels, it appears that this type occurs exclusively in the LB II. Type B IV: Cut rim (Fig. 1 13: 12-14). The rim is sometimes slightly inverted, and thus we divided the bowls of the cut- rim type into two sub-classes: 1. B IVa: Simple. 2. B IVb: Inverted. Type B IVa: Simple cut rim (Fig. 113:12). Such bowls have: 1. A ring base (Figs. 104:1 [Photo 119]; 113:12) or a disc base (Megiddo II: PI. 54:7). 2. One example was decorated with painted red bands (Fig. 113:12). Type B IVa occurs at Tel Qashish in Strata IXC-VI. Parallels for the examples from Strata IXC-IXB come solely from assemblages attributed to the MB IIB, and generally have a disc base (Megiddo II: PI. 2 1 : 14). From Stratum IXA on, the sides of the bowls are less rounded. Stratum VIII produced a bowl of Type B IVa with a diameter of ca. 35 cm. Similar vessels were found at Megiddo in assemblages belonging to the end of the MB II. These have a ring base, like the Tel Qashish Stratum VIIA examples (Fig. 104:1, Photo 119). The bowls from Strata VIIA-VI are smaller, with a diameter of ca. 25 cm. Parallels for the B IVa bowls from Strata VIIA-VI were found solely in assemblages attributed to the LB I and LB II, and it therefore appears that the B IVa bowls should be subdivided into three classes: 1 . Early: bowls with rounded sides and a disc base. These occur only in the MB II. 2. Middle: bowls with straight sides, a ring base, and a diameter of ca. 35 cm, sometimes decorated with painted red bands. This class occurs at the end of the MB IIB. 3. Late: Bowls with straight sides, a ring or disc base (Megiddo II: PI. 54:7), and a diameter of ca. 25 cm. These bowls occur in the LB I and LB II. The cessation of this class can apparently be attributed to the first half of the LB II. T^pe B IVb: Inverted cut rim (Fig. 113:13-14). These bowls have: 1 . A slightly folded (Fig. 1 13: 13) or inverted (Fig. 113:14) cut rim. 2. Rounded sides. 3. Adisc base (Megiddo II: Pis. 19:6; 29:20-21; 37:17-18; 44:39, 41 ; 45: 1) or a ring base (Megiddo II: Pis. 29:22, 24, 26; 37:12; 38:2-3). 4. Some of the examples are red-slipped and/or burnished (Figs. 81:2, 83:2, 113:13), and Stratum VIII produced a bowl with an inverted rim decorated with painted red bands (Fig. 98:3). 278</page><page sequence="318">POTTERY TYPOLOGY OF THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE II AND THE LATE BRONZE AGE Inverted cut-rim bowls occur in Strata X-VIII, and in Stratum IXB are the dominant type. Type B V: Rounded everted rim (Fig. 113:15-17). Type B V can be subdivided into two main groups: B Va and B Vb. A bowl decorated with a cross pattern (Fig. 113:17) can also be assigned to Type B V. This decorative motif is not common, and we therefore chose to define this bowl as a separate class, B Vc. Type B Va: Rounded everted rim, without slip or burnish (Fig. 113:1 5). Most of the bowls of this type have a ring base ( Megiddo II: Pis. 37:22; 61:16; 65:21), but some examples, ca. 40 cm in diameter, have a concave disc base C Megiddo II: Pis. 29:17; 37:19). At the end of the LB II, a number of B Va bowls with a flat base also occur ( Megiddo II: Pis. 65:19-20; 69:3; 71:20). Type B Va occurs at Tel Qashish from Strata IXA to Stratum VI. This class seems to have a particularly long lifespan, but while the examples of ca. 25 cm in diameter appear throughout, those that are ca. 40 cm in diameter appear only in Strata IXA- VIII and resemble the bowls classified as B Vb. Type B Vb: Rounded everted rim, red-slipped and/or burnished (Fig. 113:16). Such bowls have: 1 . Red slip on the inside of the bowl (and sometimes also on the outer edge of the rim) and/or burnishing on the interior. 2. The bowls are usually ca. 40 cm in diameter. 3. A complete bowl similar in shape to Type B Vb found at Megiddo {Megiddo II: PI. 37:19) has a concave base, but was wet-smoothed rather than burnished. Type B Vb bowls were found at Tel Qashish solely in assem- blages attributed to Strata IXA-VIII. On the basis of the associated finds, it appears that this type should be attributed to an advanced phase within the MB IIB, and thus the occur- rence of similar bowls at Tel Zeror and at the site "south of Dor" raises the possibility that both these sites were also settled in the MB IIB, and not only in the MB IIA, as suggested by the excavators (Kochavi, Beck, and Gophna 1 979: 1 60-1 6 1 ; Gophna and Beck 1 98 1 :46, 48). It seems that this type also occurs at Tel Mevorakh in the course of the MB IIB, though the origin of the bowl attributed to Stratum XIV {Mevorakh II: Fig. 15:2) is unclear (the locus in which it was found does not appear on the Stratum XIV plan). It was found in L. 339, together with an open carinated bowl {Mevorakh II: Fig. 15:3) that is not characteristic of the earlier phases of the MB IIB. Type B Vc: Rounded everted rim, cross-decorated (Fig. 113:17). These bowls have: 1 . diameter of ca. 25 cm. 2. A disc base (on the basis of a similar bowl found at Tel Mevorakh [. Mevorakh II: Fig. 15:8]). At Tel Qashish, only one Type B Vc bowl was found; it belongs to a Stratum IXC assemblage. Type B VI: Small bowls (maximum diameter ca. 15 cm) (Fig. 113:18-23). Small bowls are not abundant at Tel Qashish. We subdivided these into classes in accordance with typical rim shape. It seems, however, that no conclu- sions can be reached regarding the dating of the sub-classes. Type B Via: Simple rim (Fig. 113:18). These bowls comprise the most common type among the small bowls. They were found at Tel Qashish in Strata IXC, IXA, and VIIB-VI. Type B VIb: Simple everted rim (Fig. 113:19, Photos 82:d, 83). These occur at Tel Qashish in Strata IXA-VIIB. Type B Vic: Inwards-folded rim (Fig. 113:20, Photos 82:e, 84). Two bowls of this type were found in assemblages attributed to Stratum VIIB. The occurrence of such a rim in Stratum VIIB concurrently with the first appearance of Type B Illbl bowls seems to indicate that bowls with an inwards-folded rim were preferred in Stratum VIIB. Type B VId: Elongated thickened rim (Fig. 1 13:21). A single bowl of Type B VId was found in an assemblage attributed to Stratum VI. Type B Vie: Ledge rim (Fig. 113:22). A single bowl of this type was found at Tel Qashish in an assemblage attrib- uted to Stratum V, and it can therefore be suggested that Type B Vie occurs only at the end of the LB II. Type B Vlf: Votive bowls (Fig. 113:23). Tel Qashish produced a single votive bowl, in an assemblage attributed to Stratum VIII. 2. OPEN CARINATED BOWLS (OB) While the first appearance of the open carinated bowl is represented by a rim (Type OB V) in a Stratum IXB assem- blage, the main occurrence of this type at Tel Qashish is in Strata IXA-VI. The shape and placement of the bowl's cari- nation are significant, and these criteria are taken into consideration in determining the vessel's typological subdi- vision. Type OB I: Pronounced carination and vertical rim (Fig. 114:1). These bowls have: 1 . Apronounced carination in the middle of the vessel wall. 2. A small ring base. A single bowl, the entire profile of which was preserved, can be assigned to Type OB I. It belongs to an assemblage attrib- uted to Stratum IXA. Type OB II: Carinated with everted rim (Fig. 114:2-3). These bowls can be divided into two sub-classes, based on the shape of the carination: 1 . Type OB Ha: Pronounced carination. 2. Type OB lib: Soft carination. Type OB IIa: Pronounced carination (Fig. 1 14:2). It is difficult to ascertain the form of the base of the OB Ha bowls at Tel Qashish. These rims could belong to bowls with a low ring base {Megiddo II: Pis. 36:22; 37:1; 44:22) or a high ring base {Megiddo II: PI. 37:3-4). Tel Qashish produced only one fragment that can be assigned with certainty to Type OB IIa, originating in a Stratum IXA assemblage (regarding the fragment from Stratum VIIB assigned to Type OB IIa, see the discussion of Stratum VIIB above, p. 248). Type OB lib: Soft carination (Fig. 1 14:3). Bowls defini- tively classifiable as Type OB lib were found at Tel Qashish only in Strata VIIA-VI. On the basis of their parallels, it appears that they can be assigned to the LB I and beginning 279</page><page sequence="319">CHAPTER 16 of the LB II. These bowls probably had a low ring base (. Megiddo II: PI 61:8; 65:15). Type OB III: Modelled rim and slight carination (Fig. 114:4, Photo 114). Only one bowl of this type was found at Tel Qashish. It belongs to a Stratum VIIB assem- blage; no exact parallels are known. Type OB IV: Simple straight rim and degenerate carina- tion (Fig. 114:5 [Photo 128], 6 [Photo 125]). These bowls sometimes have painted decoration. Tel Qashish produced only one example from a clear stratigraphie context, in an assemblage attributable to Stratum VI. The locus containing another assemblage from the same stratum was disturbed by pit L. 55, probably dug in the Persian period (Fig. 140). The pit also produced a few LB II vessels (Fig. 140:5-6), including the bowl depicted in Fig. 1 14:5. It appears that the Late Bronze Age vessels found in pit L. 55 originated from the Stratum VI floor. A bowl similar to the example from the Persian period pit (Fig. 1 14:5) was found at Taanach (Sellin 1905: Fig. 21). Type OB V: "Egg-shell" Family and related bowls (Fig. 114:7). These bowls have: 1 . Exceptionally thin walls (ca. 2 mm). 2. A simple rim. 3. Pronounced carination in the middle of the vessel wall (Megiddo II: Pis. 36:18; 37:4) or low carination C Megiddo II: Pis. 37:3^, 7-9; 44:23, 27). 4. Most have a high ring base ( Megiddo II: Pis. 29:2; 37:4; 44:23) or even a trumpet base ( Megiddo II: Pis. 29:3-5; 37:3, 5, 7, 9; 44:25-27). On rare occasions, however, exceptionally thin walls also occur on carinated bowls with disc bases ( Megiddo II: PI. 36:17-18). OB V bowls were found at Tel Qashish in assemblages from Strata IXB-IIB. They are most common in Stratum VIII, and the possibility that the rim found in Stratum VIIB originated in an earlier stratum cannot be precluded. If so, the occur- rence of OB V at Tel Qashish should be dated to the Strata IXB-VIII time-span. It is reasonable to suggest that within this time-span, OB V bowls with a trumpet base occur solely in Stratum VIII, as such bases are associated exclusively with this stratum (see the discussion of Type OB V in Stratum VIII), while bowls with a low ring or disc base occur in Strata IXB-IXA, comparable to the base of the votive bowl (which also has exceptionally thin walls) found in a burial attributed to Stratum IXA (Fig. 1 14:8, Photo 97:d). Type OB VI: Votive (Fig. 114:8, Photo 97:d). A single open carinated votive bowl was found at Tel Qashish, in Tomb 304 attributed to Stratum IXA. Such bowls have exceptionally thin walls, an everted rim, and a disc base, and are sometimes decorated with red paint. 3. CLOSED CARINATED BOWLS (CB) Closed carinated bowls begin to appear at Tel Qashish in Stratum X. In Strata IXC-IXB, their occurrence is pronounced, but they are absent in Stratum IXA. Conse- quently, it seems that the three fragments in assemblages attributed to Strata VIII and VIIB do not actually belong to these assemblages and originate in earlier strata. If so, the occurrence of closed carinated bowls at Tel Qashish is limited to Strata X-IXB. As with the open carinated bowls, the shape of the carination is significant, and this feature therefore serves as a criterion for their typological subdivi- sion. Type CB I: Gutter rim and sharp carination (Fig. 114:9-10). These bowls probably have a disc base (Megiddo II: PI. 15:2). The type includes red-slipped and burnished bowls (Figs. 77:4; 83:4), bowls with the upper part red-slipped (Fig. 77:3), and unslipped bowls (Fig. 81 :4, 14). It should be noted that unslipped and unburnished bowls occur at Tel Qashish only in Stratum IXC. CB I bowls occur at Tel Qashish in Strata X-IXB, mainly in the Strata X-IXC assemblages. Parallels come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIA and MB IIB (through the middle of the latter). Type CB II: Simple everted rim (Fig. 114:11-12). Tel Qashish did not produce examples of CB II bowls on which the carination is preserved. Rim of this type, however, occur on bowls with sharp (Megiddo II: Pis. 19:2; 21 :8- 9; 28:6-7; 36:8) or rounded carination (Megiddo II: Pis. 14:33; 19:3). Most of the CB II bowls have a disc base (Megiddo II: Pis. 19:3; 21:8-9; 28:6-7; 36:8), and some a flat base ( Megiddoll : Pis. 14:26,31,33; 19:2). Some of the examples are red-slipped and burnished on the exterior (Fig. 79: 1). At Tel Qashish, the CB II bowls comprise the most common type of closed carinated bowl. They occur first in Stratum IXC and mainly in Strata IXC-IXB. In our opinion, the CB II bowls in the Strata VIII-VIIB assemblages do not in fact belong to the ceramic repertoire of these strata (see above). Type CB III: Triangular rim and sharp carination (Fig. 1 14:13). The carination on these bowls is in the middle of the vessel wall. They are red-slipped and sometimes burnished on the exterior. A bowl of this type from Megiddo has a disc base (Megiddo II: PI. 28:9). At Tel Qashish, CB III bowls were found solely in Strata IXC-IXB. Parallels come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIA and MB IIB. It seems possible to maintain that CB III bowls appear through the middle of the MB IIB. Type CB IV: Rounded rim and globular body (Fig. 114:14). These bowls have a flat base (Megiddo II: PI. 14:34) or a disc base (Megiddo II: PI. 14:37), and are red- slipped and burnished. Tel Qashish produced only a single rim belonging to this type. It was found in Stratum X, and parallels come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIA. Type CB V: Closed carinated bowls with necks (Fig. 114:15-17). Among the closed carinated bowls are several examples with necks. The bowls classified as Type CB V are subdivided according to the shape of the rim. Type CB Va: Simple everted rim (Fig. 114:15). These bowls have: 1 . Rounded carination (Megiddo II: PI. 36: 1 1-12) or sharp carination (Megiddo II: PI. 36:16). The bowl depicted in 280</page><page sequence="320">POTTERY TYPOLOGY OF THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE II AND THE LATE BRONZE AGE Fig. 78:2 may belong to this type; it has a wide neck and sharp carination. The rim of a second bowl may also belong to the rounded carination type. However, the possibility cannot be precluded that these rims belong to pedestal vases, such as those found at Megiddo {Megiddo II: Pis. 44:9; 54:19). 2. A disc base {Megiddo II: PI. 36:16), a ring base {Megiddo 11:36: 1 1-12), or a high ring base {Megiddo II: Pis. 44:9; 54:19), assuming that the last belongs to a pedestal vase. 3 . Red slip and burnishing appear on two CB Va bowls from Tel Qashish, but the type is sometimes cream-slipped and burnished {Megiddo II: Pis. 36:11) or only burnished {Megiddo II: PI. 44:9). The two CB Va fragments at Tel Qashish found in Strata IXC and IXB assemblages evidently belong to different bowls. The example depicted in Fig. 78:2 is carinated and cannot be a vase. The other, depicted in Fig. 83:6, however, could belong to a vase. Type CB Vb: Gutter rim (Fig. 114:16). Tel Qashish did not produce CB Vb bowls. The bowl depicted in Fig. 1 14: 1 6 was found at Yoqne'am in a tomb attributed to the MB IIA. It was found intact and is presented here as representative of the class. These bowls have: 1 . A ridge at the base of the neck. 2. A low ring base. 3. Red slip and burnishing on the exterior. Type CB Vc: Ledge rim (Fig. 1 14: 17). These bowls have: 1. A neck. 2. Sometimes a ridge at the base of the neck (Fig. 85:7-8). 3. Red slip on the exterior. Tel Qashish produced mainly rims of this class of bowl, and it is therefore difficult to determine the body profile, that is, whether it was sharply or slightly carinated, like the bowl depicted in Fig. 83:5 or those found at Megiddo {Megiddo II: Pis. 36:11; 54:19). The two bowls from Megiddo differ in terms of profile: one has a high ring base and a narrow neck in relation to its body {Megiddo II: PI. 54: 1 9); the other has a low ring base and a relatively wide neck {Megiddo II: PI. 36:11). At Tel Qashish, the CB Vc bowls were found solely in Stratum IXB, and parallels come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIB. « Type CB VI: Slight carination (Fig. 114:18-20). The number of examples that can securely be assigned to this type is small, and thus their subdivision into two sub-classes is based entirely on whether or not they have a ridge at the base of the neck. Three CB VI bowls were found at Tel Qashish in assemblages attributed to Strata IXC-IXB. Type CB Via: Slightly carinated without a ridge at the base of the neck (Fig. 114:18-19 [Photos 82:d, 83]). The two bowls of this class differ from one another. The bowl depicted in Fig. 114:18 features a simple triangular rim and red slip, while the one depicted in Fig. 114:19 has a modelled rim and is paint-decorated. Type CB VIb: Slightly carinated with a ridge at the base of the neck (Fig. 114:20, Photos 82:e, 84). Only one bowl is assigned to this class, a complete example found in Stratum IXC. No exact parallels are known. It has: 1 . A simple everted rim. 2. A low ring base. 3. Burnishing on the exterior. KRATERS Figs. 115-116, Table 21 The kraters found at Tel Qashish can be subdivided into two classes: 1. Open kraters (K). 2. Closed kraters (CK). 1. OPEN KRATERS (K) Open kraters first occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA (apart from a single rim found in a Stratum IXB assemblage), and, beginning in Stratum VIIB, all the kraters belong to this class (see below regarding the closed krater of Type CK lb found in Stratum VIIB). The lifespan of this type corresponds to that of the open cooking pots (see below). Like the other vessels, kraters are represented mainly by fragments, and it is therefore very difficult to determine which had handles and which did not. Consequently, the following typology is based mainly on rim shape. Type K I: Simple vertical rim (Fig. 115:1, Photo 124:i). A single complete krater of this type was found at Tel Qashish. It has: 1 . A small ridge at the base of the neck. 2. Carination in the middle of its side. 3. Two ear handles. 4. A low ring base. Kraters of Type K I were found at Tel Qashish in two assem- blages, the first attributed to Stratum VIIB and the second to Stratum VI. It appears that these kraters were in use from the LB I through the beginning of the LB II. Type K II: Everted rim (Fig. 115:2-3). Though complete kraters of this type were not found, their shape can be recon- structed on the basis of similar kraters from other sites. These kraters apparently have: 1. Sometimes a neck {Megiddo II: PI. 46:3), as recon- structed on the example from Tel Qashish depicted in Fig. 115:2, and sometimes no neck (Fig. 115:3; Megiddo II: PI. 46:2). 2. Possibly two ear handles {Megiddo II: PI. 46:2-3), although there are handleless examples (e.g., from Lachish [Lachish II: Pl. XLIIB: 147-149; Lachish IV: PI. 68:526, 528-529]). 3. Alow ring base {Megiddo II: PI. 46:2-3) or a concave disc base {Megiddo Tombs : PI. 62:24). Type K II kraters occur at Tel Qashish in assemblages attrib- uted to Strata IXB-VIIA, but it seems that they mainly appear in Strata IXA- VIII. Type K III: Thickened rim (Fig. 115:4-5). The thickened rim characteristic of this type appears both on kraters with a neck, Type Kllla (Fig. 116:4), and on those without a neck, Type Klllb (Fig. 115:5). Type KIHa: Thickened rim and short neck (Fig. 115:4). The characteristics of these kraters are: 281</page><page sequence="321">CHAPTER 16 1. Apparently a globular body, like the kraters from Megiddo (Megiddo II: Pis. 36:2; 42;7). 2. Possibly two ear handles, like the above examples from Megiddo. 3. It is difficult to establish what type of base is character- istic of these kraters. One of the Megiddo kraters has a disc base {Megiddo II: PI. 36:2), the other a low ring base ( Megiddo II: PI. 42:7). 4. Slip on the interior of the vessel. A rim of Type K Ilia was found at Tel Qashish in a Stratum VIII assemblage, while another was found in a fill attributed to Stratum VIIB. Since parallels come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIB or the end of this period, the possi- bility that the Stratum VIIB rim originated in Stratum VIII cannot be precluded. Type K Illb: Thickened rim without neck (Fig. 115:5). One krater of this type was found at Tel Qashish, made of greenish clay. It has: 1 . Slight carination in the middle of the vessel wall. 2. A diameter of ca. 40 cm. Type K IV: Triangular rim (Fig. 115:6). These kraters are similar in shape to the open cooking pots of Type CP Ilia, and are characterized by carination in the middle of the side. A tomb at Megiddo yielded a triangular-rimmed krater with two ear handles and a ring base ( Megiddo Tombs : PI. 37:1). Type K IV kraters occur at Tel Qashish in Strata VIIA-VI, and an additional rim was found in fills attributed to Stratum V. Type K V: Gutter rim (Fig. 1 15:7). This type is represented at Tel Qashish by a single fragment found in a Stratum VIII assemblage. It has: 1. A neck. 2. Probably two ear handles. Like a number of kraters first appearing in Stratum IXA that have rims similar to those of cooking pots, the rim shape of the Type K V krater resembles that of a Type CP I cooking pot (Fig. 119:1-2). Such cooking pots occur at Tel Qashish in Strata IXA-VIIB. Type K VI: Modelled rim (Fig. 115:8-10). A number of delicate open kraters with variously modelled rims begin to appear in Stratum IXA. We generally assigned these kraters to Type K VI, which we further subdivided into sub-classes on the basis of rim modelling: 1. Type K Via: "Nail" rim. 2. Type K VIb: Grooved rim. 3. Type K Vic: Ridged rim. TypeKVIa: "Nail" rim (Fig. 11 5:8). These kraters have: 1. A short neck. 2. Two ear handles. 3. Rounded carination on the upper part of the vessel. The Type K Via krater represents an intermediate type between bowls and kraters, and is similar in shape to Type CP Ha cooking pots. Type K Via kraters were found at Tel Qashish in Strata IXA-VIII, overlapping with the occur- rence of open cooking pots of Type CP Ha. Type K VIb: Grooved rim (Fig. 1 15:9). On the basis of a krater with a similar rim from Megiddo (Megiddo II: PI. 46: 1), it can be suggested that this rim represents kraters that have: 1 . Carination on the upper part of the vessel. 2. Two ear handles. 3. A low ring base. The Type K VIb krater from Tel Qashish was found in Stratum VIII. Its rim is similar to that of Type CP lib open cooking pots. These cooking pots were found mainly in Stratum VIII (an additional rim was found in Stratum VIIB), and it can therefore be concluded that the grooved modelling of krater and cooking pot rims is characteristic of Stratum VIII assemblages. On the basis of parallels, they appear to belong to the end of the MB IIB. Type K Vic: Ridged rim (Fig. 115:10, Photo 110). An almost complete ridged-rim krater was found at Tel Qashish in a Stratum VIII assemblage. It has several characteristics: 1. Large proportions, with a maximum diameter of ca. 70 cm and ca. 65 cm in height. 2. A high neck. 3. Rounded carination on the upper part of the vessel. 4. Two ear handles. 5. A plastic band decorated with an incised herringbone design on the body and two snakes modelled on the neck and rim. The bodies of the snakes are decorated with reed impressions. On the basis of a krater from Yoqne'am with a similar shape, a low ring base may be reconstructed for the krater from Tel Qashish. A similar vessel, but lacking the snake decoration, was found at Megiddo ( Megiddo II: PI. 52:5) in an assem- blage of indeterminate date. Similar ridged rims also occur on pithoi of Type P VII. These first appear at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA, but their occurrence ends in Stratum VIII, the stratum in which the K Vic krater was also found. The modelled snake decoration appears on several MB II vessels, beginning in the MB IIA (e.g., on a piriform juglet from a tomb at Yoqne'am), and continuing through the end of the MB IIB (e.g., on this krater from Tel Qashish and on a jug from Jericho [Garstang 1 934: Pl. XXIL9]). Snake decoration appears mainly on bowls, kraters, juglets, and jugs: Bowls: A decoration probably consisting of four snakes around the bowl of a chalice was found at Megiddo; its strati- graphic context is unclear ( Megiddo II: PI. 22:11). Hazor produced two bowl fragments decorated with snakes, their heads facing the bowl's interior, similar to those on the Tel Qashish krater. A snake appears on the fragment of a knob handle from a Stratum 3 assemblage at Hazor ( Hazor III-IV: PI. CCLX:24), while another appears around a carinated bowl from an assemblage of unclear stratigraphie context (Hazor III-IV: Pl. CXCVL13). Kraters: Two snakes appear around the neck of the Tel Qashish krater from Stratum VIII, attributed to the end of the MB IIB (Fig. 115:10, Photo 110), their heads on the rim, facing the vessel's interior. Juglets: A snake with its head facing the vessel rim appears on the handle of a piriform juglet found in a tomb attributed to the MB IIA at Yoqne'am. Jugs: Jericho produced two jugs decorated with snakes, their heads facing the interior of the vessel. One is on the neck of a jug found in storerooms attributed to the end of the MB IIB (Garstang 1 934: Pl. XXII:9), while the second is on a 282</page><page sequence="322">POTTERY TYPOLOGY OF THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE II AND THE LATE BRONZE AGE jug handle (Garstang 1934: Pl. XXV:20). Two jug handles decorated with snakes were also found at Shechem (Cole 1984: PI. 29:h-i). Additional snake fragments were found on body sherds at Jericho {Jericho V: Fig. 170:6) and at Tell Beit Mirsim (Albright 1932: PI. 13:27). It is thus possible to maintain that plastic decoration comprised of snakes with their heads facing the vessel's interior occurs on bowls, kraters, juglets, and jugs throughout the MB II, and is represented in all regions of the country: the upper Jordan Valley (Hazor); the lower Jordan Valley (Jericho); the Jezreel Valley (Megiddo, Yoqne'am, and Tel Qashish); the hill country (Shechem); and the Shephelah (Tell Beit Mirsim). The markings on the snake's body were generally produced by jabs with a single point, while those on the Tel Qashish krater and on the bowl from Megiddo were made with reed impressions. Type K VII: Bichrome decoration (Fig. 115:11; Photo 1 29). The stratigraphie context of this krater is unclear. Numerous fragments belonging to it were found in the fills above Stratum VILA and probably beneath the floor attrib- uted to Stratum VI. The krater has several characteristics: 1. A triangular rim. 2. A short, narrow neck. 3. Carination on the upper part of the vessel. 4. Two ear handles on the shoulder of the vessel. 5. Decoration of red and black metopes on the shoulder and bands on the rim and handles. There are similarities between the shape of the Type K VII krater and Cypriot kraters, one of which was found at Tel Qashish (Fig. 126, Photo 134, p. 335). Fhoto 129. Decorated krater (Fig. 115:11). Type K VIII: Thickened, elongated, and modelled rim (Fig. 115:12). One modelled rim, ca. 40 cm in diameter, was found in Stratum VIII at Tel Qashish. It apparently belongs to a large krater, the body shape of which resembles that of the Type K Vic krater from Tel Qashish Stratum VIII and a krater from Yoqne'am found in an assemblage attributed to the end of the MB II. Thus, it appears that large kraters featuring various rims are characteristic of the ceramic assemblage from the period corresponding to Tel Qashish Stratum VIII. 2. CLOSED KRATERS (CK) All the closed kraters found at Tel Qashish come from Strata IXB-VIIB assemblages. Though their number is not large, they can be subdivided into two main classes. Type CK I: Ledge rim (Fig. 116:1-3). Tel Qashish did not produce complete kraters of Type CK I. This type was therefore divided into two sub-types on the basis of rim shape: 1. Type CK la: Simple ledge rim. 2. Type CK lb: Modelled ledge rim. Type CK la: Simple ledge rim (Fig. 116:1-2). These kraters have: 1. A globular body. 2. Sometimes a spout (Fig. 116:2). 3. Sometimes two ear handles (Fig. 116:2); particularly large kraters (which, in fact, represent an intermediate type between kraters and storage jars) have four such handles ( Megiddo II: Pl. 21 :4). Most of the CK la kraters are known at Tel Qashish only from rims, and it therefore cannot be determined whether they had handles or not, like the kraters from Hazor {Hazor V: Fig. IV.3:15). 4. The bases of all the CK la kraters from Tel Qashish are missing, and it therefore cannot be determined whether they had flat bases (such as the krater/storage jar from Megiddo [ Megiddo II: PL 21:4]) or stood on three ear handles (such as the krater from Hazor [Hazor V: Fig. IV.3:15]). The closed kraters of Type CK la at Tel Qashish were found exclusively in Strata IXA-IXB. Parallels come from assem- blages attributed to the MB IIA-B (P. Beck 1975:48-50), and thus the absence of these kraters in the Strata X-IXC assemblages at Tel Qashish is not of chronological signifi- cance. It should be noted that the last occurrence of this type is in Stratum IXA, when the open krater was common at Tel Qashish (see above). Type CK lb: Modelled ledge rim (Fig. 116:3). The hallmark of these kraters is the modelled rim, and it seems that the shape of the body is similar to that of Type CK la. This type was found at Tel Qashish in Strata VIII and VIIB. It is possible that the krater rim found in Stratum VIIB (Fig. 101:14) originated in Stratum VIII, which also applies to several other vessel fragments from the same locus that seem to belong to the MB II (Fig. 101:9, 11, 17), and not to the LB I, to which the remainder of the vessels from the locus are attributed. If so, it can be maintained that Type CK lb occurs exclusively during the time-span of Stratum VIII, when there was a striking tendency towards modelled rims of various vessels (see above, kraters of Types K Vc, K Via, and K VIb; and below, cooking pots of Types CP IIa and CP lib; storage jars of Type SJ VI; and pithoi of Types P VII and P VIII). Type CK II: Triangular rim (Fig. 116:4). These kraters apparently have a body similar in shape to that characteristic of the CK I kraters, and their hallmark is the triangular rim. The type is found at Tel Qashish in Strata IXB and VIII assemblages. 283</page><page sequence="323">CHAPTER 16 COOKING POTS Figs. 117-119, Table 22 The MB II and Late Bronze Age cooking pots are subdivided on the basis of shape into three main classes: 1 . Straight-sided (upright-walled) cooking pots (UCP). 2. Globular cooking pots (GCP). 3. Open cooking pots (CP). 1. UPRIGHT-WALLED COOKING POTS (UCP) This class of hand-made cooking pots is represented by an almost complete vessel (Fig. 1 17:2, Photo 146) and a small number of fragments. These cooking pots occur only in assemblages attributed to Strata IXC-IXB, the early phases of the settlement attributed to the MB II at Tel Qashish. Type UCPI: Decorated with a plastic band (Fig. 1 17: 1-2 [Photo 146, p. 365]). These cooking pots are subdivided into two classes: 1 . Type UCP la: Without holes. 2. Type UCP lb: With a row of non-perforating holes. Type UCP la: Decorated with a plastic band (Fig. 117:1). These have: 1 . A simple, square and slightly everted rim. 2. A plastic band decorated with thumb impressions. This band appears at a relatively low point (not directly beneath the rim). 3. Probably a flat base, like that of Type UCP lb. Type UCP la cooking pots were found in Stratum IXC, and one rim came from beneath a Stratum IXB floor. It thus appears possible to delimit this type's occurrence to only Stratum IXC. Parallels come from assemblages at Tel Qashish attributed to the MB IIA and the beginning of the MB IIB. Type UCP lb: Decorated with a plastic band below a row of non-perforating holes (Fig. 117:2, Photo 146). These have: 1 . A simple straight or slightly everted rim (Qiri: Fig. 62: 1 ). 2. Decoration consisting of a plastic band located at a rela- tively low point (not directly beneath the rim) and a row of non-perforating holes above the band. 3. A flat base. The Type UCP lb cooking pot was found in Area B in an indeterminate stratigraphie context (see p. 365). Type UCP II: Upright slightly inslanting walls, undecorated (Fig. 117:3). This cooking pot has: 1. A square rim. 2. Apparently a flat base. The cooking pot was found in Stratum IXC. No exact paral- lels are known. 2. GLOBULAR COOKING POTS (GCP) The appearance of globular cooking pots at Tel Qashish is limited to Strata IXC-VIII. They are divided into classes on the basis of rim shape. Type GCP I: Gutter rim (Fig. 118:1-3). Some of the cooking pots of this type have a rim of the same width as the wall of the vessel, while others have a thickened rim. We therefore divided the type into two sub-classes: 1 . Type GCP la: Gutter rim of the same width as the vessel wall. 2. Type GCP lb: Thickened gutter rim. T^pe GCP la: Simple gutter rim (Fig. 1 1 8: 1). This type occurs at Tel Qashish mainly in Stratum IXC assemblages (the fragments attributed to Strata X, IXB, and VIII were found in fills and possibly originated in Stratum IXC). Similar cooking pots are known mainly from assemblages attributed to the MB IIA. Type GCP lb: Thickened gutter rim (Fig. 118:2-3). This type first occurs at Tel Qashish in Stratum X and continues through Stratum IXB. Parallels come from assem- blages attributed to the MB IIA. Their conspicuous occur- rence in Stratum IXB evidently implies that the type continued to exist at the beginning of the MB IIB. Type GCP II: Square rim (Fig. 118:4-7). This group includes cooking pots with folded simple square rims (Fig. 1 1 8:4) and others with folded and modelled square rims (Fig. 1 18:5-7). These rims belong both to globular cooking pots without decoration and to those with an incised plastic decoration (Fig. 118:6, Photos 107, 111) ( Mevorakh II: Fig. 13:12-13; Megiddo II: PI. 46:7). It should be noted that cooking pots with modelled square rims first occur in Stratum IXA, mainly appear in Stratum VIII, and disappear thereafter. This conforms with the tendency of several other vessel types that begin in Stratum IXA and end in Stratum VIII (bowls of Type OB VI; kraters of Types K V, K Via, K VIb, and K Vic; cooking pots of Types CP I and CP Ha; and pithoi of Types P VII and P VIII). Parallels for the cooking pots with a folded and modelled square rim come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIB (through the end of the period), while parallels for the cooking pots with a simple square rim are already present in assemblages attributed to the MB IIA, as well as in those of the MB IIB. Among the GCP II cooking pots, the vessel with plastic decoration is noteworthy (Figs. 95:3, 118:6; Photos 107, 1 1 1 ). Its shoulder bears a decorative band and its base a circle containing a cross, both in relief. Both decorations have herringbone incisions. The decoration of cooking pot shoul- ders with a plastic band is common on closed cooking pots from the MB II (Maeir 1997: 104). The motif of the cross on the base occurs on globular cooking pots dated to an advanced phase within the MB IIB (for references see Maeir 1997:105) and continues to appear on open cooking pots dated to the LB I from Fosse Temple I at Lachish ( Lachish II: PI. LVB:352, 358). The fragment found in an LB I tomb at Megiddo ( Megiddo Tombs : PI. 49: 11) can also be attributed to this type. Type GCP III: Inturned triangular rim (Fig. 118:8-9). The rims of the Type GCP III cooking pots are similar to those of Type GCP lb, but lack the characteristic gutter. On the basis of the complete cooking pot of this type found at Megiddo, it seems that the body of the vessel was rounded and devoid of plastic decoration ( Megiddo II: PI. 30:3). Type GCP III cooking pots occur at Tel Qashish mainly in assem- blages from Strata IXC-IXB, virtually disappearing 284</page><page sequence="324">POTTERY TYPOLOGY OF THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE II AND THE LATE BRONZE AGE thereafter (Stratum IXA produced a single rim, and the fills of Strata VIII and VI two more). It is therefore possible to delimit the time-span of the type's appearance to Strata IXC-IXB, and to suggest that the three additional rims origi- nated in earlier strata (IXC or IXB). Parallels come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIA and MB IIB. Type GCP IV: Everted triangular rim (Fig. 118:10). A single cooking pot of this type was found at Tel Qashish, beneath a Stratum IXC floor. Type GCP V: Vertical rim (Fig. 118:11-12). These cooking pots feature an ear handle attached from rim to shoulder. Cooking pots of this type were found at Megiddo ( Megiddo II: PI. 46:9) and at Shechem. The excavators at Shechem note that handle fragments from cooking pots are rare: of the 69 cooking pots found in clear stratigraphie contexts, only two had handles (Cole 1984:65). The Type GCP V cooking pot depicted in Fig. 118:12 was found in Stratum IXC. The example from Megiddo comes from an unclear stratigraphie context. 3. OPEN COOKING POTS (CP) The open cooking pots have an everted modelled rim, a rounded base, and carination (generally emphasized) in the middle or upper part of the vessel wall. The emergence of the open cooking pot coincides with the gradual disappearance of the closed variety. This process cannot be assigned to a specific stratum and occurs over Strata IXA-VIII, both of which produced several closed alongside open cooking pots. The transition from the closed to the open cooking pot corre- sponds with that from the closed to the open krater. It should be noted that the open cooking pots from Strata IXA-VIII belong mainly to Types CP I- II. These types span three strata and then disappear. Thereafter, only the sub- types of CP III occur. It seems that cooking pots of Types CP I- II represent the transition from the the closed (GCP) to the open (CP) types. Type CPI: Gutter rim (Fig. 1 1 9: 1-2). Most of the Type CP I cooking pots from Tel Qashish are known only from rims. The majority of these rims are everted and furrowed, thereby creating a gutter, the type's hallmark. On the basis of the cooking pot depicted in Fig. 119:1 (the carination of which was also preserved), it appears that these rims belong to the open type, even though rims like that depicted in Fig. 1 19:2 seem to belong to the closed variety. It is possible that this rim represents a transitional type between the closed and open cooking pots. The CP I cooking pots from Tel Qashish occur in Strata IXA-VIIB. The gutter characterizing the Strata IXA-VIII rims is more pronounced than that charac- terizing those from Stratum VIIB. Parallels for the Strata IXA-VIII cooking pots are known at Jericho in assemblages dating to the end of the MB IIB. There is considerable simi- larity between the rims of open cooking pots of Type CP I and those of open kraters of Type K V. Type CP II: Modelled rim (Fig. 1 19:3-6). An emphasis on rim modelling is the hallmark of the cooking pots assigned to Type CP II. It occurs in assemblages attributed to Strata IXA-VIIB and in Stratum VIII constitutes the most common type of open cooking pot. CP II is divided into two sub-classes. 1. Type CP Ha: "Nail" rim. 2. Type CP lib: Grooved rim. Type CP IIa: "Nail" rim (Fig. 119:3-4). Type CP Ha cooking pots have a thickened and everted rim that resem- bles the head of a nail. There is sometimes a groove along the top of the rim (Fig. 1 19:4). These cooking pots occur at Tel Qashish in the course of Strata IXA-VIIB. Their first appear- ance parallels that of the Type K Via krater, but the latter, in contrast, has two ear handles. It should be noted that a similar rim appears on several types of vessels in the course of the MB II and at the beginning of the LB I: kraters of Type K Via (Fig. 115:8); pithoi of Type P IVa (Fig. 123:7-9); and a biconical jug of Type J VI (Fig. 1 2 1 : 1 6). Parallels come from assemblages attributed to the end of the MB IIB. The rims attributed to Stratum VIIB at Tel Qashish originated in the fill layers below the Stratum VIIB floor. Consequently, their presence in this context does not attest to their continued use at this time. It seems, therefore, that Type CP IIa occurs exclusively in assemblages attributed to the end of the MB II and could also constitute a fossile directeur for the period. Type CP lib: Grooved rim (Fig. 119:5-6). Cooking pot rims with a groove at the top are similar to those of Type K VIb kraters (Fig. 1 15:9). These cooking pots were mainly found in Stratum VIII (another rim derives from an assem- blage originating in a Stratum VIIB floor foundation). It seems therefore that the modelling of grooved rims on cooking pots and kraters is characteristic of the Stratum VIII assem- blage, and, on the basis of the parallels for these vessels, they can be attributed to the end of the MB IIB and could also constitute a fossile directeur for the end of the period. Type CP III: Triangular rim (Fig. 119:7-11). All the cooking pots from Strata VIIA-V at Tel Qashish belong to Type CP III. Although a number of examples already appear in assemblages attributed to Strata IXC-IXB and VIII, it seems that their main occurrence is in Stratum VIIB (see below). Type CP III cooking pots are divided into sub- classes on the basis of their rim modelling. They are charac- terized by: 1. A triangular rim. 2. Sharp carination in the middle or upper part of the vessel wall. 3. A rounded base. Type CP Ilia: Simple (Fig. 119:7, Photo 124:m)orwavy (Figs. 107:13; 108:12-13) triangular rim. These cooking pots occur at Tel Qashish throughout Strata VIII-V and represent the most common type in Strata VILA- VI. The rim of this type found in Stratum IXB apparently should be regarded as intrusive (see above). Similar cooking pots were found in assemblages dating from the beginning of the LB I through the LB II. Type CP Illb: Everted triangular rim (Figs. 106:7 [Photo 120], 119:8). The body ofthis vessel is very similar to that of the other Type CP III cooking pots, and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between this and Type CP Ilia. The occurrence of Type CP Illb at Tel Qashish is limited to Strata VIIA- VI. The fragment found in Stratum IXC seems to be 285</page><page sequence="325">CHAPTER 16 intrusive (see above); the absence of such cooking pots in the assemblages from Strata IXB-VIIB strengthens this assumption. Similar cooking pots were found in assem- blages attributed to the LB I and LB II. It should be noted that parallels for the Tel Qashish Stratum VIIA cooking pots come exclusively from assemblages attributed to the LB I. Type CP IIIc: Thin triangular rim (Fig. 119:9). The rims of these cooking pots are thinner than those of Types CP Ilia and CP Illb, which are massive. The outer edge of the rim is straight, and, as such, differs from the rounded trian- gular rim characteristic of Type CP Hid. Only one cooking pot at Tel Qashish, found in Stratum VIIA, belongs to this type. Parallels come from an assemblage attributed to the first half of the LB II. Type CPIIId: Folded triangular rim (Fig. 119:10). The folded rim with a rounded edge is characteristic of Type CP Hid. Such cooking pots occur at Tel Qashish in assem- blages attributed to Strata VI-V. The Stratum VI examples were found in loci that had been disturbed in the Iron Age, and thus the possibility that the type initially appeared in Stratum V, that is, the second half of the LB II, cannot be precluded. Type CP Hid characterizes the end of the LB II, when the cooking pot rim is still everted, as opposed to the Iron I, when the triangular rim is vertical or inverted C Megiddo II: PI. 85:14-16). Type CP lile: Short triangular rim (Fig. 119:11, Photo 124:k). A short, triangular, and generally upturned rim characterizes Type CP lile. This rim is delicate in compar- ison to the massive rim of Type CP Ilia. The type is known at Tel Qashish mainly in Strata VI-V, but is already represented in Strata VIII and VIIB assemblages. Similar cooking pots from other sites come from assemblages attributed to the LB I. The complete cooking pot of this type found in Stratum VI at Tel Qashish indicates that Type CP lile also appears in assemblages attributed to the LB II (at least to the beginning of the period). Type CP IV: Cooking bowls (Fig. 1 19: 12-13). The cooking bowls have been categorized under the rubric of open cooking pots rather than bowls because they are made of the same material as the cooking pots. The cooking bowls have the following characteristics: 1 . A simple vertical rim. 2. Carination in the middle of the vessel wall. 3. On the basis of the cooking bowl found at Tel Yoqne'am (Fig. 1 1 9: 1 3), it can be inferred that these vessels had two ear handles. Cooking bowls were found at Tel Qashish in Strata VIIB-VIIA, dated to the LB I. The assemblages containing cooking bowls at Yoqne'am (Fig. 119:13) and Hazor have also been assigned to this period. The number of Late Bronze Age cooking bowls found is small in general, and conse- quently their exact chronological disposition within the period cannot as yet be determined. Type CP V: Miniature cooking pots (Fig. 119:14). Two fragments of miniature cooking pots were found at Tel Qashish. The rims, which do not exceed ca. 15 cm in diameter, are triangular in shape and everted. These vessels were found in Stratum VIIB. JUGLETS Fig. 120, Table 23 Juglets are not common in the Middle and Late Bronze Age assemblages at Tel Qashish. Their limited number and the fact that most are represented by small fragments make their typological classification difficult. Nevertheless, the juglets can be subdivided into three main classes: 1. Piriform juglets (PJT). 2. Dipper juglets (DJT). 3. Juglets with a ring base (BJT). 1. PIRIFORM JUGLETS (PJT) Piriform juglets are found in two strata (IXB-IXA) at Tel Qashish. Their limited range is coincidental and does not accurately reflect the time-span of the vessel, which is known from the MB IIA through the end of the MB IIB. Most of the MB IIB piriform juglets come from burial assem- blages, and since Tel Qashish has thus far produced only three MB IIB burials, with most of the pottery originating in residential contexts, the number of piriform juglets in the overall assemblage is small. It should be noted, however, that two of these three tombs (both attributed to Stratum IXA) each contained a piriform juglet as a burial offering (Fig. 91:3 [Photo 97:b], 8 [Photo 99:c]). Most of the piriform juglets at Tel Qashish were found without bases; their typological classification is therefore based mainly on the shape of the rim or neck. Type PJT I: Simple everted rim (Fig. 120:1, Photo 97:b). Only one complete juglet of this type was found at Tel Qashish. The simple everted rim is the main characteristic of Type PJT I, though this rim can occur on several other types of piriform juglets, some of which have a button base ( Megiddo II: PI. 24:8). It should be emphasized, therefore, that, as a rule, the typological classification of juglets cannot be predicated solely upon rim shape. Juglets of Type PJT I have: 1. A single or double handle (Fig. 90:8). 2. A small flat or low disc base ( Megiddo II: PI. 24:25) or a button base {Megiddo II: PI. 24:8). 3. Usually red slip and burnish. Since the surface of the complete juglet from Tel Qashish was poorly preserved (Photo 97:b), it cannot be determined whether it was burnished. The two Type PJT I examples from Tel Qashish were found in assemblages attributed to Stratum IXA. Similar juglets at Megiddo come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIB. Type PJT II: Ridge on neck (Fig. 120:2 [Photo 90], 3). These juglets were subdivided into two classes on the basis of the location of the ridge on the neck: 1 . Type PJT Ha: On the upper part of the neck. 2. Type PJT lib: Directly beneath the rim. Type PJT Ha: Ridge on upper part of neck (Fig. 120:2, Photo 90). Juglets of this type have: 1 . An everted rim. 2. Red slip and burnish. The base of the Type PJT Ha juglet from Tel Qashish is 286</page><page sequence="326">POTTERY TYPOLOGY OF THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE II AND THE LATE BRONZE AGE missing. It was found in Stratum IXB, attributed to the MB IIB. Type PJT lib: Ridge directly beneath rim (Fig. 120:3). Complete juglets with a rim and neck characteristic of Type PJT lib were found at Megiddo ( Megiddo II: Pis. 17:6; 32:27-28). Juglets of this type have: 1 . An everted rim. 2. A double handle. 3. A small flat base {Megiddo II: PI. 17:6) or a button base C Megiddo II: PI. 32:27-28). 4. Burnish. The rim of a juglet of this type was found at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA. Parallels come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIA-MB IIB transitional period or to the MB IIB. The type apparently developed from juglets like those found at Kfar Szold (Epstein 1974: Fig. 1:2-3). Similar rims also appear on juglets of Tell el-Yahudiyeh ware found in the refiise pit of a potter's workshop at 'Afilla (Zevulun 1990: Fig. 23, Reg. No. 50-805). This assemblage, the time-span of which is narrowly defined, contains a wide range of juglets with rims of various types, which undermines a number of typological-chronological assumptions concerning the end of the MB IIA that were largely based on the diverse juglet types (Zevulun 1990:185). Type PJT III: Ring rim (Fig. 120:4). The ring rim is not confined to a particular type of juglet but occurs on piriform juglets of various types and sizes, some red-slipped and burnished and others not ( Megiddo II: Pis. 17:5; 24:1-8, 10-11, 17-23, 29-30; 40:17-21), as well as on cylindrical juglets of diverse types, some with a flat base, others a round base, some with slip and/or burnish, and some with double handles ( Megiddo II: Pis. 23:14-15, 17, 19; 32:5-6, 8-19; 40:7-15). As such, it cannot be determined to which vessel type the fragment found at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA belongs, and it was broadly assigned to the MB IIB. Type PJT IV: Pinched neck (Fig. 120:5, Photo 100). Tel Qashish produced only one juglet of this type, with the following characteristics: 1. A double handle. 2. A button base, thereby differing from similar piriform juglets with a flat base ( Megiddo II: PI. 17&gt;14-15). 3. Red slip and burnish. A juglet similar to the Tel Qashish Stratum IXA example was found at Megiddo in an assemblage attributed to the MB IIB. It should be emphasized that juglets of this type also occur in assemblages dated to the MB IIA (Phase 1 in Tomb 498 at Kabri [Kabri 1989: Fig. 16:5-8]). 2. DIPPER JUGLETS (DJT) (Fig. 120:6-8) Most of the juglets found at Tel Qashish are dipper juglets, appearing mainly in assemblages attributed to Strata IXC-VIII. The dipper juglets are divided into two sub- classes on the basis of rim shape. Type DJT I: Inturned rim (Fig. 120:6). This group is repre- sented at Tel Qashish solely by rims, occurring mainly in assemblages attributed to Strata IXC-VIII. These rims belong to juglets of different sizes and body proportions. It appears that this type is a development of the red-slipped and burnished dipper juglet found in MB IIA assemblages (e.g., Megiddo II: Pis. 12:8-10, 12, 14-15). These juglets display several characteristics: 1 . An inturned rim (in contrast to the pinched rim typifying Type DJT III). 2. Usually a handle from the rim to the shoulder C Megiddo II: Pis. 17:21-22; 20:8-13; 25:15, 18-19, 21-23; 26:1-6; 33:15-24; 41:8-18); occassionally, a double handle (e.g., Fig. 120:6). 3. An elongated or bag-shaped body. It seems that some examples have a bag-shaped body ( Megiddo II: Pis. 12:11; 17:21-22; 20:12-13) and others an elongated body {Megiddo II: Pis. 12:13; 20:8-9; 25:19, 22-23; 26:1-6; 33:16-18, 20-22; 41:8-15). 4. In most cases, the base is round, although in rare cases, the juglets have a very small flat base {Megiddo II: Pis. 12:11; 17:21-22; 20:11; 26:5). The small flat base mostly occurs on the red-slipped and burnished juglets of the MB IIA {Megiddo II: Pis. 12:2-7, 12, 14: 17:23-24; 20:14), and it therefore seems that the small flat base represents an early type in the dipper juglet continuum. 5. All the dipper juglets from Tel Qashish lack slip and burnish. Red-slipped and burnished dipper juglets were found at Megiddo solely in assemblages attributed to the MB IIA {Megiddo II: PI. 12:8-10, 12, 1 5), a period repre- sented at Tel Qashish by only two assemblages, neither of which include dipper juglets. Burnished but not red- slipped dipper juglets were found at Megiddo in assem- blages attributed to the MB IIB, especially to the end of the period {Megiddo II: Pis. 25:15; 33:23; 50:19-22). As noted, dipper juglets occur from the MB IIA on, and thus their absence in Stratum X at Tel Qashish is purely coinci- dental. Apparently, the range of types in this stratum's assemblage is rather limited. Dipper juglets of Type DJT I from Tel Qashish Strata IXC-VIII lack slip and burnish; parallels come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIB. Type DJT II: Simple pinched everted rim (Fig. 120:7). Type DJT II is represented at Tel Qashish solely by the upper part of a single juglet, and thus the definition of the type is based largely on similar juglets from Megiddo. These, like Type DJT I, appear in different sizes. These juglets have: 1. An elongated body. 2. An ear handle from the rim to the shoulder. 3. Apointed base {Megiddo II: Pis. 26:1; 63:4-5; 67:16). It seems that this type first appears in the MB IIB {Megiddo II: PI. 26: 1) and continues through the LB I, LB II {Megiddo II: Pis. 63:4-5; 67:16), and Iron Age {Megiddo II: Pis. 73:4-5; 75:14-16; 81:9-11 -, Megiddo Tombs : Pis. 68:18; 69:10). Within this long continuum, a more precise subdivi- sion is suggested between the barrel-shaped juglets more common in the LB II and the Iron Age and the elongated juglets more characteristic of the MB IIB-LB I periods. It seems that the single juglet fragment of Type DJT II found in Stratum VI at Tel Qashish belongs to the barrel-shaped class (note the carination at the shoulder) and should therefore be attributed to the Late Bronze rather than the Middle Bronze Age. Thus, while Type DJT II juglets apparently should be 287</page><page sequence="327">CHAPTER 16 subdivided on the basis of their various body shapes and proportions, this would require comparing a large number of juglets from assemblages originating in clear stratigraphie contexts. Type DJT III: Pinched inturned rim (Fig. 120:8). Dipper juglets of this type are generally similar to those of Types DJT I and DJT II, but differ from DJT I in two respects: 1. A pinched rim, in contrast to the rounded rim of Type DJT I. 2. A swollen body, compared to the more elongated body of Type DJT I. Type DJT I, which appears at Tel Qashish in MB IIB assem- blages (red-slipped and burnished juglets of the same shape already occur in assemblages attributed to the MB IIA), seems to constitute the archetype of Type DJT III, found in Strata VIIB-VI at Tel Qashish. 3. JUGLETS WITH A RING BASE (BJT) Because of the vessel's small proportions, it was assigned it to the juglet rather than the jug family, to which it is more similar in shape. The juglet depicted in Fig. 120:9 (Photo 126) has a ring base, thereby differing from both the piriform and the dipper juglets. This type is represented at Tel Qashish by a single, almost complete, juglet, which has the following characteristics: 1. A simple rim. 2. An ear handle from the rim to the shoulder. 3. A globular body. 4. A ring base. 5 . Painted decoration. This type also occurs without decora- tion (Megiddo II: PI. 57:7). The juglet from Tel Qashish was found in Stratum VI, and parallels come from the assemblage attributed to Stratum VIII at Megiddo. These are similar in shape to juglets of the Bichrome family {Megiddo II: PI. 49: 1-2), and it is conceiv- able that they imitate them. It may be concluded that they originate in the LB I (Bichrome ware), and continue to occur in the first half of the LB II. JUGS (J) Fig. 121, Table' 23 Like the other vessels, most the jugs at Tel Qashish are known only from rims, and the resemblance of these to storage jar rims makes it difficult to determine whether a certain rim belongs to a jug or a storage jar. The subdivision into various types is mainly based on rim shape, while also attempting to relate the rim to the associated body shape. Three main body types can be identified among the jugs: 1 . Large dipper jugs (Type J I and some of the Type J II rims). 2. Jugs with a modelled rim and a ring or flat base (Types J II-J V). 3. Biconical jugs (Type J VI). It should be noted that most of the jug rims are everted, with the exception of Types J IVb and J IVc and two rims classi- fied under Type J VII - Miscellaneous (Fig. 121:17, 19). Type J I: Dipper jugs with a simple pinched rim (Fig. 121:1-3; Photos 121 :a, 124:e). These jugs have the following characteristics: 1. A simple vertical (Fig. 121:1-2) or everted (121:3, Photo 121 :a) rim. 2. A handle from the rim to the shoulder. 3. A bag-shaped body. 4. A small flat base. Type J I jugs occur in assemblages attributed to Strata IXA-VIII and VIIA-VI at Tel Qashish. The two complete examples from assemblages attributed to VIIA-VI indicate that their absence in Stratum VIIB is coincidental. In accor- dance with the general trend in the pottery of the MB II and Late Bronze Age, these jugs also exhibit a marked decline in quality and modelling in the Late Bronze Age; compare, for example, the jug from an MB IIB tomb (Fig. 91:4, Photo 97:a) with that attributed to the first part of the LB II (Fig. 121:1, Photo 124:e). Parallels for the Type J I jugs at Tel Qashish come from both MB IIB and LB I assemblages. Itype J II: Triangular rim (Fig. 121:4-5). The triangular rim occurs on most of the MB IIB and Late Bronze Age jugs of various body shapes. These jugs are divided into two sub- classes: 1 . Type J IIa: Simple triangular rim. 2. Type J lib: Modelled triangular rim. Type J Ha: Simple triangular rim (Fig. 121:4). The simple triangular rim is not diagnostic of a specific type of jug, and sometimes even occurs on small storage jars. Jugs : the triangular rim occurs on three different types of jugs with a range of several shapes: 1. A dipper jug with a shoulder handle ( Megiddo II: Pis. 23:10; 31:12; 40:2), which occurs only in assem- blages attributed to the MB IIB (but not to the end of the period). 2. Jugs with a globular body, shoulder handle, and ring base {Megiddo II: Pis. 3 1 :24; 48:3). To this class can be added the jug with a ridge at the base of the neck {Megiddo II: PI. 32:1). Such jugs occur in the MB IIB, through the end of the period. 3 . Jugs with a handle from the rim to the shoulder and a ring base {Megiddo II: PI. 57:9). Paint-decorated jugs can also be assigned to this class (e.g., Megiddo II: PI. 57:14). These jugs occur in the LB I and LB II, and continue into the Iron I. Storage jars : The rims of Type J Ha occur on small storage jars with a relatively high neck and no decoration (e.g., Megiddo II: PI. 27:5), as well as on those with painted deco- ration (e.g., Megiddo II: PI. 34:17). Such storage jars were found at Megiddo in assemblages attributed to the MB IIB. While no complete jug with a triangular rim was found at Tel Qashish, most of the rims were defined as belonging to Type J IIa. Such jugs occur from Strata IXC-V, a time-span corresponding to that of similar rims of vessels found at Megiddo. Type J lib: Modelled triangular rim (Fig. 121:5). This type differs from J Ha by virtue of the modelling of the rim. The J lib rim is characterized by a groove around its outer edge. This type was found at Tel Qashish only in Stratum IXC. As with Type J Ha, it is difficult to determine whether 288</page><page sequence="328">POTTERY TYPOLOGY OF THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE II AND THE LATE BRONZE AGE the rim belongs to a jug (e.g., the rim of the jug with a shoulder handle in an assemblage from Megiddo attributed to the MB IIB; Megiddo II: PL 32:2) or to an amphoriskos without a handle {Megiddo II: PL 13:2). Type J III: Triangular gutter rim (Fig. 121:6-7). Jugs of this type are represented at Tel Qashish solely by rims, some of which are pinched (Figs. 83:13; 93:23). Most examples have a small ridge beneath the rim (Fig. 121:6-7). Gutter rims without a ridge beneath them appear on dipper jugs with a shoulder handle at Megiddo {Megiddo II: Pis. 23:6; 40:3), in assemblages attributed to the MB IIB through the end of the period. There is a certain resemblance between the rims of Type J III jugs and of Type SJ VI storage jars. Jug rims of Type J III occur at Tel Qashish in Strata IXB-VIII. Their frequency increases in assemblages attributed to Stratum VIII, the only stratum in which storage jars of Type SJ VI occur. Type J IV: Folded rim (Fig. 121:8-11). This definition of folded rims includes a number of sub-types: 1. Type J IVa: Thin and elongated. 2. Type J IVb: Short and thin. 3. Type J IVc: Small and thickened. 4. Type J IVd: Large and thickened. Type J IVa: Thin and elongated folded rim (Fig. 121:8). These jugs are usually more delicate than those of Types J IVb-J IVd. Tel Qashish did not produce a complete jug of this type. Three different variants of jugs with Type J IVa rims were found at Megiddo: 1. A paint-decorated dipper jug {Megiddo II: Pl. 11:20), attributed to the MB IIA. 2. A red-slipped and burnished jug with a pinched rim, globular body, and disc base {Megiddo II: Pl. 11:11), attributed to the MB IIA. 3 . A jug with a pinched rim, an elongated body, a ridge at the base of the neck, a simple or modelled handle, a disc or small ring base, and sometimes red slip and burnishing {Megiddo II: Pis. 25:8, 14; 34:11). These jugs are attrib- uted to the MB IIB. At Tel Qashish, jug rims of Type J IVa were found in assem- blages attributed to Stratum X and Stratum IXB (in which they peaked), after which the type disappears.. The lack of complete jugs with Type J IVa rims makes it difficult to determine to which jug type these rims belong. It can only be asserted that the type initially occurs in assemblages attrib- uted to the MB IIA, that its last occurrence is in the MB IIB, and that it disappears before the end of the latter period. Type J IVb: Thin and short folded rim (Fig. 121:9). Rims of this type first occur in a fill attributed to Stratum X and thereafter in Stratum IX A assemblages and in a fill attrib- uted to Stratum V. Their lack in Strata VIII-VI suggests that the Stratum V rim is intrusive. In the absence of complete examples, the shape of this jug is unknown. Type J IVc: Small, thickened folded rim (Fig. 121:10). It is difficult to ascertain to which kind of jug the J IVc rim belongs. It could belongs to jugs with a long neck and globular body (e.g., Megiddo II: PL 57:13) or to those with more elongated bodies (e.g., Megiddo II: Pl. 57:16). Both have a small ring base and are paint-decorated. In addition to these jugs, the Type J IVb rim also occurs on undecorated jugs and possibly even on dipper jugs {Megiddo II: Pl. 50:29). At Tel Qashish, rims of this type occur in assem- blages attributed to Strata VI-V. In Stratum V, they are the most common type. Type J IVd: Large, thickened folded rim (Fig. 121:11). Only one rim of this type was found at Tel Qashish, in Stratum V. It cannot be determined whether the rim belongs to a jug or a storage jar. Type J V: Modelled rim (Fig. 121:12-14 [Photos 97:f, 101]). These rims belong to jugs with different body shapes. Only one complete jug was found (Fig. 121:14; Photos 97:f, 101); its body shape is not characteristic of jugs with a Type J V rim. The rim depicted in Fig. 121:12, for example, belongs to a jug with a very short neck. The complete jug has the following characteristics: 1 . A modelled, pinched rim with an inside gutter. 2. A narrow neck. 3. A small ridge at the base of the neck. 4. A handle consisting of three bands. 5. An elongated body. 6. A stepped ring base. This jug is generally similar to examples dated to the MB IIB at Megiddo {Megiddo II: Pl. 25:14; Megiddo Tombs: Pl. 23:15), Taanach, and Hazor. To this group can be added another jug found in a tomb at Megiddo {Megiddo II: PL 25:8). Its body shape and proportions are similar to the jug from Qashish, although it differs in the details of the rim shape (of Type J IVa), the low ring base, and the "rolled" shape of the handle, as well as the red slip and burnish. The other two rims attributed to Type J V are paint-deco- rated: one in a single color, red (Fig. 121:13); and the other in two colors, red and black (Fig. 121:12). It should be noted that special care was taken with the decoration and model- ling of the complete jug (the rim, handle, and base). This characterizes several vessels, beginning in Stratum IXA, but mainly those found in assemblages attributed to Stratum VIII (kraters of Types K V and K VIA-K VIC; cooking pots of Types CP IIA and CP IIB; storage jars of Types SJ VI; and pithoi of Types P VII-P VIII). While the jugs found in Stratum VI (Fig. 121:12-13) are paint-decorated, the painting of vessels is more characteristic of those found in assemblages attributed to Strata VIIB-VI (e.g., bowls of Type B la; kraters of Type K IXa; biconical jugs of Type J VI; and storage jars of Types SJ VILA and SJ VIIB) than of those from earlier strata. Type J VI: Biconical jugs (Fig. 121:15-16). Tel Qashish produced only two biconical jugs, which have the following characteristics: 1 . A modelled rim, modelled differently in each of the two examples from Tel Qashish (see below). 2. The absence of a neck, thereby differing from other jugs. 3. Usually one handle, although several parallels have two {Megiddo II: PI. 64:5, Beth-Shean [Oren 1973: Fig. 37:16], Hazor II: Pl. CXX:20). 4. Usually a small ring base (e.g., Megiddo II: Pis. 58:1-3; 63:3). 289</page><page sequence="329">CHAPTER 16 5. Painted decoration in one or two colors. Geometric patterns similar to those of the jug depicted in Fig. 121:16 occur on biconical jugs with various rims from Megiddo ( Megiddo Tombs : PI. 43 : 1 1 ) and from Tomb 29A at Beth-Shean, attributed to the 14th century BCE (Oren 1973:99, Fig. 39:20). The decoration on the jug depicted in Fig. 121:15 includes a combination of geometric patterns (parallel lines enclosing a row of dots) and animal motifs. A decoration comprised of horned animals and a tree was found on a biconical jug at Megiddo {Megiddo II: PL 58:2), and of parallel lines enclosing a row of dots on a jug at Hazor (Hazor I: PL CXXVIILl). The rims of the two jugs from Tel Qashish differ from one another. One (Fig. 121:15) is wavy and triangular, similar in shape to the rim of open cooking pots of Type CP Ilia (Fig. 108:12-13). The other is modelled, and resembles the rims ofkraters ofType K Via (Fig. 1 15:8), open cooking pots of Type CP IIa (Fig. 119:3-4), and pithoi of Type P IVa (Fig. 123:7-9). Cooking pots with a wavy triangular rim occur at Tel Qashish only in assemblages attributed to Strata VIIA-VI (Figs. 107:13, 108:12-13), while the modelled rim of the jug depicted in Fig. 121:16 occurs on kraters, open cooking pots, and pithoi, mainly in assemblages attributed to Strata IXA-VIII. It thus seems that the rim of the biconical jug depicted in Fig. 121:16, found in an assemblage attrib- uted to the LB I, is more closely associated with the group of rim shapes characteristic of the MB IIB. Parallels for both jugs from Tel Qashish are mainly known from the LB I, although several belong to LB II assemblages. It should be noted that since parallels for both jugs were found in assem- blages attributed to the LB I, they do not necessarily have to be attributed to the LB II. J VII: Miscellaneous Thickened and inverted rim (Fig. 121:17). It is difficult to determine whether this rim belongs to a jug or a storage jar. It originates in an assemblage attributed to Stratum VI, and no exact parallels were found. Generally speaking, it seems attributable to some phase within the LB II. It is possible that this type continues into the Iron Age. Concave and everted rim (Fig. 121:18). Tel Qashish produced only one rim belonging to this group, in Stratum IXB. A similar jug rim was found at.Tel Mevorakh XIII. Concave neck and thickened rim (Fig. 121:19). This type is represented at Tel Qashish by a single rim found in an assemblage attributed to Stratum IXA. The rim apparently belongs to a jug similar to the example found at Megiddo ( Megiddo II: PL 39:16), which has several characteristics: 1 . A vertical and convex neck, with a rim that is essentially a direct extension of the neck. 2. An ear handle from the rim to the shoulder. 3. An elongated bag-shaped body. 4. A low disc base. 5. Red slip. The jug from Megiddo was found in an assemblage attrib- uted to the end of the MB IIB. It should be noted that this type continues into the LB I, as represented by a jug of the Light Red Ware family found at Hazor in Stratum la ( Hazor II: Pl. CXXIV: 1 8). High-necked amphoriskos (Fig. 121:20, Photo 125). A single amphoriskos of this type was found at Tel Qashish. It is almost complete (the rim is missing). Its main characteris- tics are: 1 . Ahigh neck, approximately half the length of the vessel. 2. A biconical body. 3. Two ear handles on the shoulder of the vessel. 4. A small ring base. 5. White slip. 6. Geometric decoration in brown paint. The decoration is poorly preserved but appears to represent a geometric pattern consisting of two horizontal lines, one at the base of the neck and the other at the point of the carination, apparently divided into metopes, of which only a few vertical lines survive. For a detailed discussion of this type see above, pp. 272, 275. STORAGE JARS (SJ) Fig. 122, Table 24 Storage jars occur in all the MB II and Late Bronze Age strata at Tel Qashish. Their continuum can be divided into two parts: 1. The occurrence of Types S J I-SJ VI, mainly in Strata X-VIII. 2. The occurrence of Types SJ VII-SJ VIII, mainly in Strata VIIB-V. This division corresponds with the above-mentioned periods, with Strata X-VIII dating from the MB IIA-MB IIB transition through the end of the MB IIB, and Strata VIIB-V from the LB I-LB II. Storage jars were primarily used for storing various commodities, a function also fiilfilled by pithoi. Thus, the discussion of the two groups is interrelated and it is not surprising that phases that contain a large number of pithoi have comparatively few storage jars. In assemblages of Strata IXA-VIII, the pithos is common, and its disappearance in the Strata VIIB-V assemblages is accompanied by a rise in the number of storage jars (on the pithos rims in assemblages attributed to Stratum VIIB, see above, pp. 247-248, 255). As with the other vessels at Tel Qashish, the various storage jars are represented mainly by rims, which accord- ingly form the basis of the following typological division. Type SJ I: Simple everted rim (Fig. 122:1-2). These storage jars are characterized by simple rims that are a direct extension of the vessel neck. The rim is everted, and belongs to storage jars with two ear handles with a rounded section. The SJ I storage jars at Tel Qashish were found in a fill attrib- uted to Stratum IXC and in assemblages attributed to Strata IXB and VIIA. The absence of this type from Strata IXA- VIIB seems to indicate that the rim in Stratum VIIA is intrusive. Similar storage jars were found at Tel Qiri and Tel Mevorakh. Type SJ II: Folded rim (Fig. 122:3-6). These were divided into two sub-classes: 1. Type SJ IIa: Folded rims and an inner gutter. 2. Type SJ lib: Simple folded rims. There is some similarity between the folded-rim (SJ II) and ring-rim storage jars (SJ VII below). The distinction between 290</page><page sequence="330">POTTERY TYPOLOGY OF THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE II AND THE LATE BRONZE AGE these two types lies in the way the rim is modelled: in contrast to the SJ II type, the SJ VII rims are rounded on the outside. Type SJ Ha: Folded rim and inner gutter (Fig. 122:3). Folded storage jar rims with an inner gutter are generally everted. These storage jars comprise the most common type at Tel Qashish in Stratum X and disappear therafter, apart from the single sherd found in a Stratum IXB fill. This and the fact that similar rims are found in assemblages attributed to the MB IIA but not in those attributed to the MB IIB show that Type SJ Ha belongs exclusively to Stratum X at Tel Qashish. Type SJ lib: Simple folded rim (Fig. 122:4-6). This group includes storage jars with rims of various sizes. Most have an average diameter of ca. 13 cm (Fig. 122:4-5), while some are larger, up to ca. 18 cm in diameter (Fig. 122:6). It should be noted that the larger folded rims are represented at Tel Qashish only by a single sherd found in Stratum IXC (Fig. 122:6). As opposed to the other rims defined as Type SJ lib, it was decorated with red paint. It seems that this rim belongs to a separate group; the only parallels come from assemblages attributed to the "Pre-Palace" phase at Aphek (P. Beck 1975:53). The other Type SJ lib rims, measuring ca. 13 cm in diameter, are everted, with one exception (Fig. 122:5), found in Stratum IXA. Most of the Type S J lib rims belong to storage jars with elongated bodies, two ear handles, and a flat base, like the example from Megiddo ( Megiddo II: PI. 18:1). Tel Qashish produced such rims in assemblages attributed to Strata IXB-IXA, and the single sherd found in a fill attributed to Stratum V is clearly intrusive. Similar rims are found in assemblages attributed to the MB IIA (at Tel Poleg and Aphek), and from their presence in Strata IXB-IXA at Tel Qashish, it can be inferred that they continue in the MB IIB . Type SJ III: Ridged folded rim (Fig. 122:7). Tel Qashish produced only one rim that can be defined as ridged and folded, belonging to a white-slipped storage jar decorated with black paint found in Stratum IXB. This rim is delicate compared to those classified as Type SJ VII (see below), and we therefore decided to treat it as a separate type rather than as a sub-class of Type SJ VII. • Type SJ IV: Ridge at base of folded rim (Fig. 122:8-10). All the Type S J IV rims are everted. A ridge at the base of the folded rim is the hallmark of the storage jars classified as this type, which can be divided into three sub-classes on the basis of rim modelling: 1. Type SJ IVa: Simple rim. 2. Type SJ IVb: Cut rim on the inside. 3. Type SJ IVc: Gutter rim. Type S J IVa: Ridge at base of simple folded rim (Fig. 122:8). Though Tel Qashish did not produce a complete storage jar of Type S J IVa, its characteristics can be inferred from the example found at Aphek (P. Beck 1975: Fig. 1:3): 1. An elongated body. 2. Two ear handles. 3. A broad flat base. Type S J IVa storage jars occur at Tel Qashish in Strata X-IXC (the rim attributed to Stratum X was found directly beneath the floor level), and mainly in Stratum IXC. Paral- lels come mainly from MB IIA assemblages. It can be assumed that this type continues into the beginning of the MB IIB. Type SJ IVb: Ridge at base of cut folded rim (Fig. 122:9). These storage jars with folded rims cut on the inside occur at Tel Qashish exclusively in Stratum IXB. Similar rims are found in assemblages attributed to the MB IIA or MB IIB. Type S J IVb appears until the middle of the MB IIB, and not later. Type SJ IVc: Ridge at base of gutter rim (Fig. 122: 10). This type is represented at Tel Qashish by only two rims, one in an assemblage attributed to Stratum IXC and the other in an assemblage attributed to Stratum VILA. Parallels for Type SJ IVc mainly occur in the MB IIA, with some examples from the MB IIB. The rim found in Stratum VIIA, therefore, seems to be intrusive. A complete storage jar of Type SJ IVc was found at Aphek. It has the following characteristics: 1. An elongated body. 2. Two ear handles. 3. A broad flat base. Type SJ V: Folded and inturned rim (Fig. 122:11-12). Storage jars with folded and inturned rims occur at Tel Qashish in assemblages attributed to Strata IXC-IXA, with a single rim found in a fill attributed to Stratum X. Similar rims occur in assemblages dated to the MB IIA at Tel Poleg and Aphek. It thus appears that this type is limited to the MB IIA, perhaps continuing into the beginning of the MB IIB. If so, then the rims found in assemblages dated to later phases of the MB IIB probably originated in earlier strata. Type SJ VI: Ridged rim (Fig. 1 22 : 1 3). These rims belong to storage jars like the example from Megiddo ( Megiddo II: PI. 43:1) with the following characteristics: 1. An everted ridged rim. 2. An ovoid body. 3. Two ear handles. 4. A very small flat base. Type SJ VI rims were found at Tel Qashish exclusively in Stratum VIII. The only almost complete storage jar that apparently had a rim of this type (Fig. 92:4) can also be assigned to this group. Its walls are unusually thin, and it is made of greenish clay. These characteristics also apply to the pithoi that appear exclusively in Stratum VIII (see pp. 293, 3 1 8). Type SJ VI storage jars were found at Megiddo in assemblages attributed to the end of the MB IIB, and in an assemblage containing vessels from the end of the MB IIB alongside LB I vessels. Thus, storage jars of Type SJ VI seem to be diagnostic of the end of the MB IIB. Type SJ VII: Ring rim (Fig. 122:14-17, Photo 124:a-b). A folded rim with a rounded outer edge is the hallmark of Type SJ VII storage jars. This type can be considered a develop- ment of Type S J lib. The distinction between the two lies in the modelling of the rim: the Type S J lib rim is more delicate than that of Type SJ VII. The complete shape of most of the Type SJ VII jars, especially that of the base, is highly signifi- cant. These storage jars feature two main types of bases: a small flat base and a stump base. It should be noted that 291</page><page sequence="331">CHAPTER 16 stump bases were not found at Tel Qashish, even though there is reason to assume that they should be present in the typical Stratum V assemblage. This absence is probably due to the fact that the assemblage is small and does not faithfully reflect the entire Stratum V range of vessels. Some of the Type SJ VII storage jars are large (Fig. 122:14-15) and others small (Fig. 1 12:20), but since they are known mainly from their rims, they are divided into sub-classes on the basis of rim shape: Type SJ Vila: Simple. Type SJ Vllb: Inturned. Type S J Vile: Rounded. Type SJ Vila: Simple ring rim (Fig. 122:14-15, Photo 124:a-b). These storage jars have: 1. A flaring ring rim (Fig. 122:14, Photo 124:b) or straight ring rim (Fig. 122:15, Photo 124:a). 2. An ovoid body. 3. Two ear handles. 4. Either a small and flat base (Fig. 122:15) or a rounded base ( Megiddo Tombs : Pis. 55:8; 56:11). We have not assigned to this type storage jars with a stump base, like those from Megiddo ( Megiddo Tombs'. Pis. 55:7; 56:10), which represent a separate class. 5. Sometimes painted decoration (Figs. 104:18; 112:20). It should be noted that the paint decoration on the storage jars from Strata VIIB-VI is usually bichrome. Storage jars of this type were found at Tel Qashish in Strata IXA-V. Their main occurrence is in Strata VIIB-V, while in Strata VIIA-V they represent the most common type. Type SJ Vila storage jars can be further subdivided on the basis of rim diameter, which in Stratum VIII is ca. 20 cm (Fig. 98: 12-13, the latter red-slipped) and in Strata VIIB-V is usually ca. 10 cm, and never more than 15 cm. It should also be noted that most of the Type SJ Vila rims in Strata VIIB are flaring, while in Stratum VILA they are vertical. It can thus be assumed that the manufacture of vertical storage jar rims of Type SJ Vila became more common in the LB II, especially at the end of this period. This represents the begin- ning of a trend characteristic of Iron Age storage jars (e.g., Megiddo II: Pis. 73:6-8; 76:2-4; 82:8-9; 83:1-6). Type SJ Vllb: Inturned ring rim (Fig. 122:16). Type SJ Vllb storage jars are defined by their delicate inturned ring rims. They are sometimes slipped and decorated. A Stratum IXB example has white slip and red paint (Fig. 83:15), and a Stratum VIIB storage jar is decorated in two colors (Fig. 122:16). Type SJ Vile: Rounded ring rim (Fig. 122:17). The single rounded and flaring ring rim of this type found at Tel Qashish belongs to a storage jar in an assemblage attributed to Stratum VI. Type SJ VIII: Inwardly thickened convex rim (Fig. 122: 1 8). A rim of this type was found at Tel Qashish in an assemblage attributed to Stratum IXA. A complete storage jar with a similar rim was found in the third and last burial phase in a tomb at Barqai (Gophna and Sussman 1 969: Fig. 8). The phase is assigned to the MB IIB, towards the end of the period (Ibid.:3, 10). Type SJ IX: Triangular rim and a ridge in the middle of the neck (Fig. 122:19). Tel Qashish produced a single storage jar of this type, in an assemblage attributed to Stratum VIIB. The shape of the vessel to which the rim belongs is unknown, and it is therefore difficult to determine whether it belonged to a storage jar or jug. PITHOI (P) Figs. 123-124, Table 24 Pithoi are storage vessels of ca. 90 cm in height, the main criterion that differentiates them from storage jars, which do not exceed 70 cm in height. Pithoi occur at Tel Qashish in Strata X-VIII (for several pithos rims found in assemblages attributed to Stratum VIIB see above, pp. 247-248, 255). In Strata IXA-VIII, their number rises considerably in relation to that of storage jars. The absence of pithoi in the subsequent strata is noteworthy and may have geopolitical significance (Bonfil 1992:31-33). In the second millennium BCE, the pithos occurs throughout Israel, beginning in the MB IIA and continuing to the end of the MB IIB (except in the region of the northern Jordan Valley, where it continues through the various phases of the Late Bronze Age). Pithoi can be divided into three main groups, corresponding to three well- defined regions (Bonfil 1992:34): 1. The northern Jordan Valley: a large pithos with plastic decoration on its body apparently constitutes the arche- type of the Late Bronze Age "Hazor pithos," which also occurs only in this region. 2. The coastal plain, Jezreel Valley and Shephelah: pithoi without handles are the dominant type in this region. 3. The central hill country and central Jordan Valley: pithoi with two or four handles occur alongside pithoi without handles. Pithoi with handles apparently comprise about half the assemblage, e.g., Shiloh produced 13 examples with handles {Shiloh: Figs. 6.15:15; 6.16:1, 3, 7; 6.18:1, 3-5; 6.19:1-2, 4; 6.20:5, 7), and 13 without ( Shiloh : Figs. 6.15:1, 3-4; 6.17:1-6; 6.18:2; 6.19:3, 5). Beth- Shean also produced pithoi with handles alongside handleless examples (Maeir 1997:108-110). All the pithoi found at Tel Qashish lack handles and have rounded shoulders, an elongated body, and a small, flat base. Their subdivision into different classes is based on the shape of the rim and length of the neck. The length of the neck is of chronological significance (Cole 1984:75; Bonfil 1992:33). Short-necked pithoi can be subdivided into several types (P I-P VI and P IX) and long-necked pithoi into two types (P VII-P VIII). The long-necked pithoi have a more elon- gated body than the short-necked types. Type P I: Short-necked with simple everted rim (Fig. 1 23 : 1 ). These pithoi have variously modelled rims. The pithos with a simple everted rim is less common, and at Tel Qashish is represented by a single fragment in an assemblage attributed to Stratum IXC. Type P II: Short-necked with square rim (Fig. 123:2-4). Pithoi with a square modelled rim include three sub-types: 1. Type Pila: Thick square rim. 2. Type Pllb: Thin square rim. 3. Type Pile: Inturned and folded square rim. 292</page><page sequence="332">POTTERY TYPOLOGY OF THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE II AND THE LATE BRONZE AGE Type P IIa: Thick square rim (Fig. 123:2). Tel Qashish did not produce a complete pithos of this type, which is common in assemblages attributed to the MB IIA and MB IIB. Rims of this type were found in Strata IXC-IXA. Type Pllb: Thin square rim (Fig. 123:3). The thin square rim occurs on only a single pithos at Tel Qashish, found in Stratum IXA. Type P lie: Inturned and folded square rim (Fig. 123:4). Pithoi with a folded square rim occur at Tel Qashish in assemblages attributed to Strata IXB-IXA, and especially in Stratum IXA. The preference for complex rims characterizes several pithos types, mainly at the end of the MB IIB. Type P III: Short-necked with triangular rim (Fig. 123:5-6). Triangular-rim pithoi can be divided into two sub-types: 1 . Type P Ilia: Inturned. 2. Type P Illb: Everted. Type P Ilia: Inturned triangular rim (Fig. 123:5). These pithoi were found at Tel Qashish in Strata IXC and IXA. Similar rims were found in the rampart fill at Mevorakh. At Megiddo, a similar rim belongs to a large krater, making it a transitional type between a pithos and a krater (Megiddo II: PI. 36:1). The main occurrence of Type P Ilia pithoi at Tel Qashish is apparently in Stratum IXC. Type Plllb: Everted triangular rim (Fig. 123:6). These pithoi are found at Tel Qashish in assemblages attributed to Strata X and IXA, and it can be assumed that their absence in Strata IXC-IXB is fortuitous. The complete example from Stratum IXA (Fig. 123:6) is decorated on the shoulder with two incised wavy lines. Parallels for Type P Illb pithoi come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIA at Aphek and at Tel Qiri. Type P IV: Short-necked with "nail" rim (Fig. 123:7-10). The rim of Type P IV is modelled like a nail head, and most of these pithoi have a ridge at the base of the neck. Type P IV pithoi can be divided into two sub-types on the basis of rim shape: 1 . Type P IVa: Simple. 2. Type P IVb: Moulded. Type P IVa: Simple "nail" rim (Fig. 123:7-9). Some of these pithoi feature combing on the shoulder (e.g., Fig. 123:7). Type P IVa pithoi are found at Tel Qashish in assemblages attributed to Strata IXC and IXA. The rims of this type from the fill on which floor L. 360 was founded, attributed to Stratum VIIB, are apparently intrusive. Paral- lels come from assemblages attributed to the MB IIA (at Tel Burga, Tel Zeror, and Tel Mevorakh) and to the MB IIB (at Megiddo). The type seems to be characteristic of the western Jezreel Valley and the northern coastal plain (Bonfil 1992:28). Type P IVb: Moulded "nail" rim (Fig. 123:10). The Type P IVb pithos is represented at Tel Qashish by only a single rim, found in a fill attributed to Stratum IXB. Type P V: Short-necked with folded rim (Fig. 124:1-2). The folded-rim pithoi can be divided into two sub- types: 1. Type P Va: Simple. 2. Type P Vb: Flaring. Type P Va: Simple folded rim (Fig. 124: 1). These occur at Tel Qashish exclusively in assemblages attributed to Stratum IXA. Most of the Type P V pithoi at Tel Qashish belong to Type P Va. Type P Vb: Flaring folded rim (Fig. 124:2). Tel Qashish produced only one pithos rim of this type, found in a fill between Strata IXA and VIII. Flaring rims also occur on high-necked pithoi (which appear at the end of the MB IIB). Pithoi with flaring rims (both the short- and long-necked varieties) are common at the end of the MB II (Bonfil 1992:29-30, 33). Thus, the rim found at Tel Qashish might be attributable to Stratum VIII rather than to an earlier phase. Type P VI: Short-necked with ring rim (Fig. 124:3). This type is represented by only one rim, in an assemblage attrib- uted to Stratum IXA. The Type P VI pithos rim is similar to that of Type SJ Vila storage jars, which first appear in Stratum IXA and become common in Strata VIIB-V. Type P VII: High-necked with ridged rim (Fig. 124:4). Most of the Type P VII pithoi have a ridge at the base of the neck, and most of the rims are flaring. An exception is the ridged rim that is not everted (Fig. 88:3) found in Stratum IXA. All the other Type P VII pithoi at Tel Qashish come from assemblages attributed to Stratum VIII. Most are made of greenish clay, which also characterizes the Type P VIII pithoi, in contrast to the reddish/pinkish clay of most of the Strata X-IXA pithoi. The manufacture of pithoi from greenish clay is characteristic of assemblages from the end of the MB II at Tel Qashish, Yoqne'am, and Shechem (Cole 1984:78; Bonfil 1992:30). Most of the Stratum VIII pithoi at Tel Qashish belong to Type P VII. Type P VIII: High-necked with ledge rim (Fig. 1 24:5). The ledge rim characteristic of Type P VIII seems to be a develop- ment of the Type P IVa rims common in the assemblages of Strata IXC and IXA and evidently replaces them. Like the Type P IVa pithoi, Type P VIII also has a ridge at the base of the neck. Type P VIII pithoi were found at Tel Qashish in Strata IXA- VIII, especially in Stratum VIII. It should be noted that the only complete vessel (Fig. 88:4, from an assemblage attributed to Stratum IXA) has a high neck and a short ledge rim, thereby differing from the other ledge rims of this type, which flare outwards. As mentioned above, these flaring rims are characteristic mainly of the end of the MB II, also typified by the manufacture of pithoi and storage jars from greenish clay, of which most of the P VIII pithoi are made. Type P IX: Short-necked with elongated and ridged rim (Fig. 1 24:6). The only Type P IX pithos from Tel Qashish has a ridge at the base of its neck. It is found in an assemblage attributed to Stratum IXC, and has a parallel at Jericho in an assemblage attributed to the MB IIB. This pithos has a short neck, characteristic of pithoi found at Tel Qashish in Strata IXC-IXA. 293</page><page sequence="333">Bowls Open bowls (B) rig. 113. MB-LB typology: bowls (open).

The first group derives from Strata X-VIII and the second from Strata VIIB-V. The first, earlier group has the following characteristics: 1 . A relatively large number of closed vessels. This trend is particularly marked in the occurrence of closed carinated bowls, closed kraters, and globular cooking pots, all of which are absent in the second group. 2. The vessels are made of levigated pinkish clay and are well-fired (especially compared to those of the second group). 3. The vessels are more finely modelled than those of the second group. This is evident mainly in the elaborate rims. The same rim shape can often be found in different ceramic classes (e.g., the rims of kraters of Type K IVc, cooking pots of Type CP IIa, and pithoi of Types P IV and PVII). 4. A relatively large number of vessels with thin walls, such as Type OB V bowls, Type S J VI storage jars, and Types P VII-P VIII pithoi, were found in Strata IXA-VIII. 5. The occurrence of red slip and burnishing, almost completely absent in the later group. 6. The main storage vessel is the pithos. The second, later group has the following characteristics: 1. Open vessels are common. Globular cooking pots are completely absent, replaced by open cooking pots (Figs. 1 1 8-119). Open carinated bowls appear, while the closed carinated types are absent. 2. The use of yellowish/light brown coarse clay. The firing is poorer than that of the previous group. 3. Paint-decorated vessels (mainly storage jars and jugs). 4. The only storage vessel is the storage jar, while the pithos is completely absent. It should be emphasized that even though there is a clear break between these two ceramic groups (between Stratum VIII and Stratum VIIB), it seems that several tendencies characterizing the later group can already be identified in Strata IXA and VIII: 1. The disappearance of closed carinated bowls and the advent of open carinated bowls already in Stratum IXA. It should be noted that the open carinated bowls in Strata IXA-VIII belong to the more modelled types (Types OB I, OB IIa, OB V, and OB VI). 2. The appearance of open kraters, mostly with modelled rims (Types K V, K Via, K VIb, and K Vic). 3. The appearance of the open cooking pot, the numbers of which steadily increase over time. It already occurs in Stratum IXA (Types CP I and CP II). These observations suggest a division of the strata at Tel Qashish based on the ceramic assemblages into three groups: the early group (Strata X-IXB), the transitional group (Strata IXA-VIII), and the late group (Strata VIIB-V). The transi- tional group is closer in nature to the early group than to the late group. 318</page><page sequence="358">CHAPTER 17 CHANGES IN THE MATERIAL CULTURE AT TEL QASHISH OVER TIME IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER SITES IN THE JEZREEL VALLEY Ruhama Bonfil Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem TEL QASHISH Most of the remains attributed to the MB II and Late Bronze Age come from Area A. Consequently, our examination of the history of the settlement at Tel Qashish during this time- span is largely based on the findings from this excavation area, where five phases involving significant architectural changes were observed. THE FIRST PHASE: STRATUM IX Given the nature of the remains attributed to Stratum X (see pp. 185-186), it is difficult to ascertain with confidence whether an MB II settlement existed at Tel Qashish prior to the construction of Stratum IX. In the course of the excavations, it emerged that the foundations of several Stratum IX struc- tures were built directly over remains dating to the EB III (Stratum XI), and it is therefore conceivable that Stratum IX represents the earliest MB II settlement at Tel Qashish. The findings of the survey conducted previously at Tel Qashish indicated that the MB II remains were located within the area defined by Portugāli as Shelves I - III (1982:184-186), that is, on the summit of the mound, and it is possible that the line of fortifications surrounding the settlement corresponds to the line defining Shelf III (Portugāli 1982: Fig. 4a). Even the results of eight excava- tion seasons have proven inadequate to ascertain the size of the fortified settlement (Stratum IX). The MB II fortification line was exposed exclusively in Squares V-X/15 (Plans 24, 26, 28; Photos 3-4, 75), which apparently .confirms the conclusions of the survey. Nevertheless, it is necessary to account for the MB II remains fousd in the excavations within Shelf IV (see p. 365), where, according to the survey, a settlement existed only during the Early Bronze Age (Ibid.: 185). Of significance in this respect is the "belt of structures" attributed to Stratum XI in Area B, concerning which we raised the possibility that they could be assigned to the MB II. It is thus conceivable that the Stratum XI belt in Area B is contemporary with Stratum IX in Area A, and, if so, it was built outside the fortified settlement. Another option is that it should be dated only to the end of the MB II, when the fortifications no longer demarcate the settlement (Stratum VIII, see pp. 230-232). If the settlement was concentrated only on the summit of the mound (Shelves I- III), it would have encompassed ca. 6 dunams (1.5 acres) in the MB II; if, on the other hand, it included the "belt of struc- tures" in Area B, it was ca. 10 dunams (Ibid.: 185-1 86). The fortifications attributed to the MB II were constructed in the earliest phase of Stratum IX. They include a fortifica- tion wall with a tower and a glacis (Plans 24, 26, 28; Sections C-C', G-G'; Photos 75-76). The fortification system was constructed concurrently with a row of structures abutting the inner side of the wall (Plans 24-29; Sections D-D', E-E', G-G'; Photos 3-4, 75, 77, 85). These structures faced the street running parallel to the wall. This plan was preserved through three phases (IXA, IXB, IXC), during which only minor modifications were made. The analysis of the ceramic assemblages associated with these three phases confirms that the foundations of the Stratum IX settlement (IXC) were laid during the transitional phase between the MB IIA and MB IIB, and that this settle- ment continued to exist for two additional phases (IXA-IXB), both dated to the MB IIB. The Stratum IXA remains were covered by fallen mud- brick debris, but no traces of fire were observed. It is there- fore impossible to determine whether Stratum IX ended violently or peacefully. THE SECOND PHASE: STRATUM VIII The Stratum VIII settlement remains are comprised of segments of floors and walls directly above the remains attributed to Stratum IXA (see Section G-G'). A layer of ash covered the floors, which produced assemblages of vessels more akin to those of Stratum IXA than to those character- istic of the subsequent Stratum VIIB. We therefore chose to assign Stratum VIII to the end of the MB IIB, rather than to the LB I. Stratigraphically, the remains of Stratum VIII were below those of Stratum VII and above those of Stratum IXA (see Section G-G'; Plan 32), but the relationship between the Stratum IX fortification wall and the Stratum VIII remains is unclear: in the area in which it should have been possible to investigate this issue (Squares V/15-16), the top of the forti- fication wall was located directly beneath the surface (Section G-G'). Consequently, it cannot be determined whether this wall continued in use in Stratum VIII. THE THIRD PHASE: STRATUM VII The fortifications of Stratum IX do not encompass the Stratum VII (VIII?) or subsequent settlements. The remains of the Stratum VII structures (exposed in Squares S-T/16) were found above the lines of the Stratum IX fortification 319</page><page sequence="359">CHAPTER 17 wall (Plan 33; the excavation in this area did not reach the Strata VIII and IX remains, as a result of which the continua- tion of the wall [W.20] was not exposed). It is noteworthy that the pottery found in the fill directly beneath the floor of Stratum VIIB (Fig. 101:22-24) is similar to that character- istic of Stratum VIII. The structures in Squares S-T/16 were built on the slope of the mound, as a result of which their northern parts were eroded. The dwellings of Stratum VII were built in close proximity to the edge of the site, leaving no room for a fortification wall. At most, the continuous outer wall of the houses, approximately 1 m in width, provided some kind of defense. A similar phenomenon was observed at neighboring Yoqne'am, where a 1 .2 m wide wall encompassed the Stratum XXB settlement (contempora- neous with Stratum VII at Tel Qashish), after the fortification system of the previous Stratum XXII had gone out of use.1 The Stratum VII settlement was attributed to the LB I on the basis of the pottery repertoire. The factors that brought about its end have not been adequately clarified, but it appears from the architecture that the remains of Stratum VI belong to a completely new settlement. The results of the earlier survey regarding the size of the Late Bronze Age settlement at Tel Qashish correspond to those of the excavation. The settlement during this period was concentrated on the summit of the mound (Shelves I- III), and encompassed an area of ca. 6 dunams (Ibid.: 184-1 86). THE FOURTH PHASE: STRATUM VI The remains attributed to Stratum VI are sparse, and appear to represent a new settlement, unconnected with that of Stratum VII, even though the orientation of the Stratum VI structures is similar (cf. Plans 36 and 38). The ceramic assemblage from the Stratum VI floors was dated to the first part of the LB II. THE FIFTH PHASE: STRATA V AND IV Several wall and floor segments were attributed to Stratum V. These had an entirely different orientation from that of the preceding strata (IX-VI). The ceramic assemblages associ- ated with these remains indicate an LB II date, probably until the end of this period. In the stratigraphie discussion, we noted that it was diffi- cult to ascertain whether Walls 1 1 and 1 5 (Plan 39) were part of a massive structure (a tower?), and whether they could confidently be assigned to Stratum V (see p. 331). The next stratum (Stratum IV) was dated to the end of the Late Bronze Age. However, the question of the nature of the transition from Late Bronze to the Iron Age at Tel Qashish remains unresolved: Strata V-IV may be contemporaneous with Strata VIIA-B at Megiddo (see the discussion of L. 371 on pp. 331-333). COMPARISON WITH OTHER SITES IN THE JEZREEL VALLEY The question arises as to whether the history of the settle- ment at Tel Qashish from the MB II to the end of the Late Bronze Age corresponds with that of other Jezreel Valley settlements in its proximity, and, if so, whether it is possible to identify similarities regarding two main issues: 1. Is there a parallel at other sites for the strati- graphic/ceramic "break" at Tel Qashish between Strata VIII and VII? 2. Is it possible to identify similar elements in the plans of the various settlements? The discussion of these topics will contribute to our under- standing of the settlement pattern and perhaps also to identi- fying historical events in the Jezreel Valley. Tel Qashish is located in the western sector of the Jezreel Valley, a region with numerous MB II sites (Na'aman 1982:149; Broshi and Gophna 1986:73, 78-79, 87-88). In most cases, these sites represent a resettlement after a gap beginning at the end of EB III (except for meager remains attributed to the Intermediate Bronze Age found at some sites). The majority of the surveyed sites have not been exca- vated, and thus it remains difficult to determine whether the number of settlements already rose significantly in the MB IIA (and, if so, during which phase), or whether this process occurred mainly in the MB IIB. The excavation results from a number of sites in the vicinity of Tel Qashish indicate that Megiddo, Yoqne'am, and possibly also Tel Qiri were already settled in the MB IIA: Yoqne'am XXIV (Ben- Tor 1993b:81 1); Megiddo XIII ( Megiddo II: Figs. 378, 397); and Tel Qiri, where the MB IIA is represented by a tomb and not by a defined stratum on the mound (Qirv.212). None of these sites yielded remains or artifacts dating to the begin- ning of the MB IIA, corresponding to the early (Pre-Palace) phase at Tel Aphek (Strata X20-X19 and BV) and Phase 5 at Tell el-Hayyat (Garfinkel and Bonfil 1990:144-145; Ben- Tor 1993b:811). The earliest MB II architectural remains at Tel Qashish belong to the MB IIA-MB IIB transitional period. This time-span can be correlated with Yoqne'am XXIIIB and Megiddo XII, when the city plan changes at these sites. At Yoqne'am XXIII, the city was built anew (Ben-Tor 1993b: 8 10), and at Megiddo XII, the surrounding fortification wall was thickened, its offsets widened, and an outer tower added ( Megiddo 11:87: Figs. 198, 308). Taanach can be included in this general picture of settlement develop- ment in the Jezreel Valley, though the date of its construction in the MB II remains unclear (see below). Until the excavation results from Yoqne'am and Taanach have been completely published, the discussion of the data from these sites is of necessity based largely on preliminary reports, and the Tel Qashish material is, therefore, mainly compared with that of Megiddo, the final report for which is available. Megiddo The nature of the final report for Megiddo detracts from its reliability as a stratigraphie and chronological reference point for the other sites in the vicinity. The main problems are the impossibility of reconstructing the ceramic assemblages found on the floors of the structures (most of the vessels published in the report come from tombs of unclear strati- graphic contexts) and the schematic nature of the plans, which makes it difficult to ascertain the connections between the various walls (Kenyon 1969:25-60; Kassis 1973:5-22; 320</page><page sequence="360">CHANGES IN THE MATERIAL CULTURE AT TEL QASHISH OVER TIME IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER SITES IN THE JEZREEL VALLEY Baumgarten 1978:24-26; Gonen 1987:83-84). These diffi- culties notwithstanding, we shall try to identify correlations between Tel Qashish and Megiddo in the MB II and Late Bronze Age, that is, between Qashish IXC-V and Megiddo XII-VIIB. In the pottery discussion, we noted that it is difficult to establish the exact point at which the Stratum IXC settlement at Tel Qashish was constructed. It should apparently be correlated with some point in the course of Stratum XII at Megiddo (although perhaps not at its outset). Megiddo XII represents a significant change in urban planning, as demon- strated mainly in Area AA, where Stratum XII residential structures were built over the remains of the Stratum XIII gate (the excavators' view seems preferable to that of Dunayevsky and Kempinski, who date the gate to Stratum XIIB [1973; Kempinski 1993:56]). The basic plan of Megiddo XII also characterizes that of Megiddo XI. The continuity between these two strata is clear, and they can perhaps be correlated with the various phases of Qashish IX. The reconstruction of the city plan of Megiddo XII is mainly based on the remains exposed in Areas AA and BB. Both areas had a fortification wall (ca. 3 m in width) with offsets, a row of residential structures abutting its interior, and a street running parallel to the wall. It appears that this basic plan was retained with minor modifications in Stratum XI. Megiddo X shows an architectural, but not a ceramic, change. This stratum can be associated with the expansion of the built-up area to cover the Strata XII-XI glacis and the establishment of a street above the line of the Strata XIII-XII fortification wall in Area BB; the excavators assign this street to Stratum X {Megiddo 11:97). Even with the phasing out of the Stratum XII fortifications in Stratum X, the settle- ment's overall plan was not drastically changed. The resi- dential structures built in Stratum XII continued in use in Stratum X, while a tendency to expand the building area towards the slopes of the mound can be observed. The question concerning the existence of fortifications in Stratum X remains open. A wall, 1 .5 m in width, exposed in Squares K/6-8 apparently both served as the rear wall of the Stratum X belt of structures and demarcated the city of that phase (Gonen 1987:84). Significant architectural and ceramic changes can be attributed to Megiddo IX, to which the construction of the palace in Area AA can probably be assigned,' rather than to the early phase of Stratum X (Gonen 1987:84-86). Gonen's dating is mainly based on the assemblage of vessels from Floor 403 1 . This floor, however, appears to be isolated and is not related to the palace walls. There is no problem, there- fore, with assigning the construction of the palace to Stratum IX. Two phases marked by the raising of the floor levels can be attributed to the early palace. It should be noted that, apart from two MB II vessels found in a room on a floor that had been disturbed (Floor 4116 in Square K/7), the ceramic assemblages found on the floors of the Stratum IX palace have not been published (Ibid.: 89). Thus, the question of the dating of Stratum IX in Area AA remains open. There appears to be a correlation between Areas AA and BB, with the construction of the palace in Area AA paral- leling that of House Z in Area BB (Epstein 1966:89-91). House Z is apparently also a new building, as the structures of the earlier strata were not taken into account. In contrast to the palace in Area AA, House Z yielded ceramic assem- blages that can be attributed to the LB I. In our view, it is difficult to accept Gonen's opinion that the palace in Area AA had been abandoned and remained unoccupied until the 1 4th century BCE, and only then were internal changes intro- duced (1987:89, 96). It is reasonable to assume that Areas AA and BB show a similar stratigraphie continuity. In our opinion, Megiddo IX can be correlated with Qashish VII. The palace in Area AA is the main structure at Megiddo that contributes to our understanding of the changes affecting the site in the course of the Late Bronze Age. In Stratum VIII, the palace plan underwent several changes, the most prominent of which is the location of the central court- yard ( Megiddo 11:25: Figs. 381-382). It is difficult to date the Stratum VIII palace. Following Tufnell, Gonen posits a gap at Megiddo during the 14th century BCE (1987:91: Fig. 5 : 1-5), based on the absence, according to Tufnell et al. (1958:66; Kenyon 1969:59), of painted Base-Ring ware. It should be borne in mind, however, that the pottery published in Megiddo II includes only complete vessels, and it is there- fore not certain that this family is entirely lacking. Tufnell herself mentions a juglet published in Megiddo II: PI. 26: 1 1 , claiming that it is rare (Tufnell et al.l958:66). To this vessel should be added the painted Base-Ring jugs found in tomb assemblages in the Megiddo cemetery, which attest to the presence of this family at the site, and, if so, to the existence of a settlement too during this period ( Megiddo Tombs : Pis. 11:11; 19:25: 43:8; 55:2; 56:7-8; 59:12; 63:17). No evidence of a stratigraphie gap of nearly a century was found at Tel Megiddo (Baumgarten 1978:26). In Stratum VIIB, the plan of the palace underwent several changes: the widening of the inner courtyard, the rearrange- ment of the western and northern wings, and especially the rebuilding of the wall enclosing the structure on the north {Megiddo 11:29: Fig. 383). The ceramic assemblage found in the Stratum VIIB palace courtyard belongs to the transitional LB II-Iron I phase, the period identified with Stratum VILA at Megiddo. The plaster floor (2041) on which the vessels were found (Gonen 1987:94-95: Fig. 7) appears on two different plans, representing two strata, VIII and VIIB {Megiddo II: Figs. 382-383). No plaster floor, however, is shown in this location in Stratum VILA (Ibid.: Fig. 384). It can be suggested that the plaster floor of Courtyard 2041 belongs, in fact, to Stratum VILA, and, if so, the assemblage dates the Stratum VIIA palace, and not that of Stratum VIIB or VIII. This has already been proposed by Ussishkin, whose reconstruction of this area includes two stories in the Stratum VIIA palace ( 1 995 :24 1-246). The basic plan of the Stratum VIIA palace is very similar to that of Stratum VIIB, and it thus appears that there was continuity between the two phases {Megiddo 11:29, 31: Fig. 384; Kempinski 1993:77; Ussishkin 1995:246). The question of the fortifications at Megiddo through the various phases of the Late Bronze Age has been re-investi- gated in the recent excavations at the site. The excavators re- examined the stratigraphie attribution of the gate (Area AA) and reached the conclusion that it was not connected to the fortification wall during the Late Bronze Age, thereby supporting the suggestion that Late Bronze Age Megiddo 321</page><page sequence="361">CHAPTER 17 was not surrounded by such a wall (Ussishkin 1995:259). If so, Megiddo, like Tel Qashish, Yoqne'am, and possibly also Taanach (see below), was unfortified during this period. Taanach Settlements dating from the MB II and the Late Bronze Age were excavated at Taanach. A Late Bronze Age archive was also found, containing documents illuminating the nature of settlement in the Jezreel Valley during this period (Glock 1983:57-66). However, the excavation results pertaining to the MB II and the Late Bronze Age at the site have been published only in preliminary form (P.W. Lapp 1964; 1967; 1 969), and it is difficult to reconstruct the settlement's devel- opment during these periods. The reports include the plans of various structures but lack the ceramic assemblages associ- ated with them, and their dating, therefore, remains unclear. At Taanach, as at Tel Qashish, there is a gap between the EB III settlement and the settlement established at some stage during the MB II. This phenomenon is apparent in the section in Squares SW 7-7 (P.W. Lapp 1969: Fig. 10), where some of the MB II remains were built directly on top of those attributed to the Early Bronze Age, as at Tel Qashish (see above). This is the only excavated area at Taanach that contributes to our understanding of the MB II and Late Bronze Age fortifications at the site. Between the EB III and the Iron Age remains, two main strata, subdivided into phases, were identified (Ibid.: 16). The excavators attributed the earlier stratum and the begin- ning of the later stratum to the MB IIC, and the remainder of the later stratum mainly to the LB I. It is unknown what data the excavators relied on to determine that the earlier MB II settlement belongs specifically to the MB IIC. This is partic- ularly evident in their description of a piriform juglet with a button base, which they define as an MB IIC type: "A double- handled juglet with degenerate button base (belonging to the very end of MB IIC)..." (P.W. Lapp 1964:19). Such juglets are also common in the MB IIB, and the possibility cannot be precluded that the early MB II settlement at Taanach belongs to this phase, which is also represented by additional vessel fragments that, according to the excavators, date from the MB IIB, although their stratigraphie context is unclear (P.W. Lapp 1969:24-25). If so, it appears that the early level at Taanach corresponds to one of the Qashish IX phases. There are several similarities between the settlement plans at Taanach (the early level) and Qashish IX. The settlement at Taanach was also surrounded by a fortification wall (Ibid. : Fig. 11). However, the area in which it was excavated was very limited and narrow, and it is thus difficult to determine whether Wall 1 1 8 is the western side of the tower or a thick- ening of Wall 105, as the excavators suggest (Ibid.: 17, Fig. 11). The other similarities are as follows: 1. A glacis abuts the outer face of the fortification wall (Ibid.: 19, Fig. 102.2). 2. Residential structures were built abutting the interior of the fortification wall. Most of these structures' walls were one row of stones in width (Ibid.: 16, Figs. 11-12). 3. A street ran parallel to the line of the fortification wall (P.W. Lapp 1967: Fig. 10; 1969:24-25, 27). 4. Storage-jar burials were found beneath the floors of the structures (Ibid.: 13; 1969:27-28). It also appears that the time-span of Qashish IX was similar to that of the early level at Taanach, and both are divided into three sub-phases. The structures of the subsequent stratum at Taanach cancel those of the previous level (P.W. Lapp 1969: Fig. 10). Above the fortification line of the earlier stratum were built two parallel walls, the outer wall on top of the glacis, ca. 80 cm west of the previous stratum's settlement perimeter (Ibid.: Figs. 10-11). In the excavators' view, these walls represent part of a casemate (Ibid.:21- 22). It is noteworthy that both walls were exposed within a narrow excavation area, and they could be interpreted as the walls of a structure built on the edge of the mound. Such a structure possibly formed part of a belt surrounding the city, comparable to the "West Building" ( Westburg ) exposed by Sellin (P.W. Lapp 1964:7, 16, Fig. 1). The excavators assigned the later stratum and the "West Building" to the MB IIC and LB I (Ibid.: 16; 1969: 16, 22). It is noteworthy that the area of the "West Building" also has several phases: the walls of the earlier structures are one row of stones in width, while those of the "West Building" are two rows wide (P.W. Lapp 1969:22-23, Figs. 15-16). Even if the correlation between the "West Building" and the remains attributed to the later stratum in Squares SW 7-7 is unclear, it appears that a similar process occurred in both areas. Considering that Tel Qashish and other sites exhibit a discon- tinuity between the MB II and LB I, with narrow walls char- acterizing the MB II structures and walls two rows of stones wide typifying the Late Bronze Age construction (see pp. 325-326), we believe that the date of the later stratum at Taanach should be re-examined. A correlation between the late stratum at Taanach and Qashish VII may therefore be proposed. Tel Mevorakh A comparison between Tel Qashish and Tel Mevorakh virtu- ally suggests itself, since the latter is located in an area of the coastal plain that had direct contact with the Jezreel Valley via Wadi Milh. This contact is also evident later, in the 10th century BCE, when Mevorakh produced cooking-pots bearing incisions characteristic of the Jezreel Valley (Qiri: 232-233). Mevorakh exhibits a stratigraphie conti- nuity (Strata XIII-X) paralleling that at Tel Qashish (Strata IX-V). The Stratum XIII settlement at Mevorakh was founded on top of structures attributed to the end of the MB IIA (Stratum XIV) and cancelled them ( Mevorakh 11:50-51). Thus, it appears that Stratum XIII represents a new settlement and not a continuation of the previous one. The Stratum XIII settlement does not exceed one dunam in size, and was surrounded by an earthen embankment abutted by a wall 50 cm in width. This wall served as the rear wall of a series of rooms of residential structures (Ibid.:47^9). Since the excavation in Squares E-F/10-11 did not reach the remains of Stratum XIII, it is not known whether a street affording access to these structures ran parallel to the line of fortifications at Mevorakh, as was the case at Tel Qashish, Megiddo, and Taanach. Some of the walls of the Stratum XIII structures at Mevorakh were one row of stones wide (Ibid.: Pis. 16:1-2, 322</page><page sequence="362">CHANGES IN THE MATERIAL CULTURE AT TEL QASHISH OVER TIME IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER SITES IN THE JEZREEL VALLEY 17:1-3), comparable to Tel Qashish (IX), Yoqne'am (XXIII-XXII), and Taanach. The excavators related the Stratum XIII ceramic assemblages to those from Megiddo XII-XI (Ibid.:56). Despite the above-mentioned difficulty of dating based on comparisons with Megiddo, it appears that Mevorakh XIII conforms to one stage or another within the MB IIB (but not the beginning of the period), and a correla- tion between Mevorakh XIII and Qashish IXB-IXA can therefore be suggested. The construction of a new settlement, which disregarded the borders of the previous one, occurred in Stratum XII at Mevorakh. Some of the structures were built on top of the Stratum XIII embankment. The pottery attributed to Stratum XII belongs to the end of the MB IIB (a period the excavators termed the MB IIC [Ibid.:46-47, 55-56]). Among the vessels in the assemblages assigned to Stratum XII, of partic- ular note is the egg-shell bowl (common at Tel Qashish in Stratum VIII); it was found on a paved surface that cancels the fortifications attributed to Stratum XIII (Ibid.:46, Fig. 1 1 :6). A comparison between the ceramic assemblages from Mevorakh and Tel Qashish indicates that the Qashish VIII assemblages contain vessels similar to those from Mevorakh XIII and XII. It should be noted that both Tel Qashish and Mevorakh exhibit an architectural discontinuity not represented in the pottery: at Tel Qashish, it occurs between Stratum IX and Stratum VIII, and at Mevorakh, between Stratum XIII and Stratum XII. The excavators of Tel Mevorakh compared the assemblages of Mevorakh XII (both phases) with those from Megiddo X. It appears that at Megiddo, too, a continuity can be discerned between the vessels of Strata XI and X, as well as a certain architectural discontinuity between these strata (see pp. 320-321). With the construction of the Stratum XI temple at Mevorakh, the area was reorganized and underwent a signifi- cant change. The temple, like the Stratum XII remains, was built above the lines of the Stratum XIII ramparts and was situated in the center of an unfortified site (Ibid.:6, 37). The dating of Mevorakh XI to 1550-1440 BCE is based on the assemblages of local and imported vessels (Ibid.: 3 7), and it seems possible to establish a correlation between Mevorakh XI and Qashish VII, as well as between the assem- blages of Mevorakh X and Qashish VI. The correlation between Mevorakh X and Qashish VI pertains solely to the pottery, since new construction is evident at Qashish VI, while at Mevorakh X the temple continues in use, even though a number of architectural changes are introduced (Ibid.:6-8). Additional architectural changes are apparent at Mevorakh IX. It is not clear whether another temple replaced the one from the previous two strata: the assumption that a temple existed in the same place in Stratum IX is based on the notion that sacred areas were preserved from one generation to the next (Ibid.:8). The dating of Mevorakh IX is also prob- lematic, as floor levels associated with this stratum's frag- mentary remains were not found. It therefore cannot be determined whether there was a correlation between Tel Mevorakh and Tel Qashish during this period. CONCLUSIONS In light of the above, it appears that the Jezreel Valley sites show a comparable development, for which the following points can be cited: 1. MB IIB sites are planned and fortified according to similar principles. The ceramic assemblages associated with these settlements show a continuity from the MB IIA. 2. Architectural changes occur at the end of the MB IIB, basically expressed in the cancellation of the fortifica- tions and the expansion of the settlements above the line of the fortifications of the previous phase. 3 . New unfortified settlements were built at the beginning of the LB I. Since the pottery associated with these settle- ments differs from the previous assemblages, the division between the Middle and the Late Bronze Age should be made at this point. 4. In the LB II, the continuity of the ceramic culture coin- cides with a number of architectural changes. Table 25 presents the proposed correlations among the various phases at Tel Qashish, Yoqne'am, Megiddo, Taanach, and Mevorakh.

Settlement during this period was concentrated mainly in two regions, one along the Jordan River Valley and the other on the coastal plain. Communication between these two regions, separated by a mountainous zone, followed the Jezreel and Beth-Shean Valleys (A. Mazar 1990:176-179). In the Jezreel Valley, two sites that can definitively be attrib- uted to the MB IIA (Yoqne'am and Megiddo) have been excavated. The cities of Yoqne'am XXIVB-A and Megiddo XUlA(Megiddo II: Figs. 378, 397) were surrounded by forti- fication walls. Both cities exhibit architectural discontinuity between the strata attributed to the MB IIA and those attrib- uted to one phase or another at the beginning of the MB IIB. Comparable discontinuity is not apparent in the ceramic assemblages, which attest to an uninterrupted development beginning in the MB IIA and concluding at the end of the MB IIB. It is therefore difficult to specify the date of the architectural change in these cities. Furthermore, it cannot be established whether it occurred abruptly or over a period of time. Accordingly, it remains unclear whether the transition from the MB IIA to MB IIB was peaceful, and thus repre- sents an uninterrupted development, as proposed by A. Mazar (1990:191), or whether some external agent induced change in the existing settlements and perhaps also promoted an increase in the number of settlements. We attributed the construction of the Stratum IX settle- ment at Tel Qashish to the MB IIA-MB IIB transitional period. It was evidently built according to a plan with standard elements that also appear in the plans of other settle- ments in the Jezreel Valley (Yoqije'am, Megiddo, and Taanach), as follows. FORTIFICATIONS The width of the fortification walls is not identical at the various sites (at Megiddo XII, ca. 5 m; at Taanach, ca. 3 m; at Yoqne'am XXII the width is unknown, since the outer face of the wall did not survive [the MB IIA wall of Stratum XXIII is ca. 3 m in width]; and at Tel Qashish, ca. 1 .80 m). The nature of the plan of the wall at Tel Qashish is similar to that of the MB IIB wall at Yoqne'am. It is straight and lacks offsets (as opposed to those at Megiddo). At Taanach, the excavation area was too limited to determine the nature of the fortifica- tion system. Towers of various types were incorporated in these walls: 1. Towers projecting markedly into the settlement The MB IIB tower with an internal cell exposed at Tel Qashish belongs to this class. It projects 0.8 m inwards on the east and 2.70 m on the west. Its external face was eroded, and it is therefore unclear whether it also projected outwards. Towers of this type first occur in the MB IIA at Tel Poleg (Kochavi, Beck, and Gophna 1 979: 1 33, Fig. 5) and continue into the MB IIB in the Jezreel Valley, the Shephelah, and the hill country. In the Jezreel Valley, a tower of this type was exposed at Yoqne'am XXII, but the excavation area was too limited to determine whether it contained an internal cell comparable to that at Tel Qashish. At Taanach, a similar cell was exposed (it was possible to reconstruct at least one such cell [P.W. Lapp 1969: Fig. 11]), but the excavation area was too limited to determine whether the tower was of the type under discussion. In the Shephelah, a similar tower was found at Gezer ( Gezer I: Plan I), and in the hill country, this type is represented at Hebron (Tell Rumeida), where a wall (ca. 3-3.5 m in width) with a tower projecting inwards by ca. 5 m was exposed (Ofer 1989: Fig. on p. 90; upper Fig. on p. 9 1 ). It can be identified as a tower of the type under discus- sion. The excavator reconstructed the entire wall as an offset- inset wall, but the exposed segments are limited and it could also be reconstructed as a straight wall incorporating towers of various types (like the wall at Gezer [see below]). If this is the case, the wall segment abutting the line of the fortifica- tions in Area F (Ibid.:92, Fig. on p. 90) could also represent the outer face of a tower of this type (compare this segment to the one exposed in Area 13). Since the tower at Hebron was not completely exposed, it cannot be ascertained whether it had an internal cell or was solid. It may be assumed that the construction of towers of this type was determined by the need to deal with topographical weak points. Such towers were built at junctures where the fortification walls change direction (e.g., at Tel Poleg [Kochavi, Beck, and Gophna 1979: Fig. 5]). This seems also to be the case at Tel Qashish, with the tower located near the place where the wall changes direction (assuming that the MB II settlement was limited to Area A on the summit, i.e., Portugali's Shelves I- III [1982:184-186]), and possibly also at Hebron, at junctures where the topography of the site changes (Ofer 1989:90). 2. Towers projecting equally both inwards into the settlement and outwards Such towers were found in settlements dated to the MB IIA at Yoqne'am XXIV-XXIII (Ben-Tor 1993b:81 1) and Tell Beit Mirsim (Albright 1938:18, PI. 49; Eitan 1972:19-24), and at others attributed to the MB IIB, such as Shiloh ( Shiloh A9 , 324</page><page sequence="364">CHARACTERISTICS OF SETTLEMENT PLANS IN THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE II 57, Figs. 1.5, 4.1-4.4, 4.10; Lederman 1985:140-146) and possibly Bethel (Kelso 1968:10-11, 23, PI. 91a). 3. Towers projecting exclusively outwards Such towers occur in the MB IIA at Tel Zeror (Kochavi, Beck, and Gophna 1979:155, 163, Figs. 13-14, 16) and apparently at Tell el-Far'ah (North) (de Vaux 1 95 1 :423-426, Planche VI, n. 44), and in the MB IIB at Megiddo ( Megiddo II: Fig. 398), Gezer ( Gezer 1:42-43; Gezer 11:33-35; Gezer IV:35-36, Plan I; Rowe 1935:28), and probably also Jericho (Garstang 1948: Fig. 4, Pl. V). It appears that these three tower types originate in the MB IIA and continue through the end of the MB II. Further- more, all three types occur in a single fortification wall at Gezer {Gezer I: Plan I). Since the various tower types appear at sites located in different regions (the Jezreel Valley, the hill country, the coastal plain, and the Shephelah), the construc- tion of a given type should be related not to regional differ- ences, but rather to local considerations. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE DWELLINGS WITHIN SETTLEMENTS The area excavated at most of the sites was insufficient to ascertain the settlement plan or to establish whether a standard "blueprint" was applied in constructing cities and smaller settlements. This especially applies with regard to the larger cities, where most of the remains dating from the MB II were exposed on the edges of the tels. Nevertheless, it is possible to cite several common elements: 1. The construction of structures abutting the line of the fortifications demarcating the settlement on the one side and facing a street on the other The city's fortification wall also serves as the rear wall of these structures. Such construction already occurs in the MB IIA in the Jezreel Valley at Yoqne'am XXIV and Megiddo XIIIA, and on the coastal plain at Tel Zeror (Kochavi, Beck, and Gophna 1979:155, Figs. 15-16). At Megiddo, this phenomenon was noted in Area AA ( Megiddo II: Fig. 378) and probably also occurs in Area BB, where the Stratum XIIIA fortification wall was exposed in Squares N-O/15. The Stratum IX settlement at Tel Qashish, constructed during the MB ILA-MB IIB transitional period, reflects the same architectural concept. Several rooms were exposed in Squares V-X/15-16 and V/17 (Plans 24, 26, 28) in Area A on the northwestern slope of the tel (Plan 1). The excavated area was too limited to determine whether all the rooms found in each successive phase belonged to a single residential unit or whether they represented several struc- tures. Generally speaking, it can be stated that two rows of adjoining rooms were constructed between the street and the fortification wall. Both rows had three phases (IXA-IXC), and the probes conducted in each row beneath the founda- tions of the earliest phase (Stratum IXC), revealed that the architectural remains directly below those of Stratum IXC belong to the Early Bronze Age (Stratum XI). Thus, it is possible to establish a correlation between the two rows of rooms (one abutting the fortification wall and the other, to its south, associated with the street running parallel to the wall). The two rows are separated by wall W. 1 6 and W.3 1 : each row has three architectural phases belonging to the MB II constructed on top of the Early Bronze Age architectural remains (Stratum XI in Area A). The rooms were constructed on the slope of the tel, making it possible to distinguish the differences in height in Stratum IXB between the floor levels of the rooms to the north and south of W. 31 (L. 81 A, L. 249), which is 80 cm (Section G-G'). It is unclear whether this relationship was retained in Stratum IXA, since, apart from one segment of floor L. 228 (in Square W/l 5), the floors of this stratum were not exposed north of wall W. 1 6 and W. 3 1 . If the segment of floor L. 228 applies to the remaining floor levels in the northern row of rooms in Stratum IXA, then the level of the northern row of rooms in this phase is similar to that of the southern row. In the MB IIB at Yoqne'am, Megiddo, and Taanach, as at Tel Qashish, dwellings were built contiguously with the fortification wall. At Megiddo and Taanach, the dwellings were accessed by way of a street running parallel to the line of the wall, while at Yoqne'am the excavated area was too limited to determine whether or not a street ran parallel to the wall. The disposition of dwellings along the edges of the settlement also occurs at Mevorakh XIII ( Mevorakh II: Fig. 32), where these structures were built against the ramparts surrounding the settlement. Regarding MB II dwellings in general, it is not yet possible to define the components that constitute a single residential unit (Eitan 1972:23), and it cannot be determined whether the dwellings in various regions have different char- acteristics, perhaps corresponding to the differences in climatic or environmental conditions. It should be empha- sized, however, that the basic plan according to which the dwellings in fortified settlements were built contiguous with the line of the fortification wall occurs in all regions: • The Jezreel Valley - at Tel Qashish, Yoqne'am, Megiddo, and Taanach. • The coastal plain - at Mevorakh. • The hill country - at Shiloh ( ShilohA9 , 57, 61-62, Fig. 4.10), Bethel (Kelso 1968:11, Pis. 91a, 97), and Jeru- salem (Shiloh 1984:12, Fig. 14). •The Jordan Valley - at Jericho (Garstang 1934:118, Pl. XV; Jericho III: Pis. 336, 339). • The Shephelah - at Tell Beit Mirsim, where the principles of the MB II settlement were already established in Stratum F, attributed to the MB IIA (or to the MB IIA-MB IIB tran- sitional period); its plan includes a fortification wall, abutting houses, and a perimeter street running parallel to the line of the wall (Albright 1938: PI. 49; Eitan 1972:19, 21-24). 2. Walls one row of stones in width Most the walls of the structures in all three phases of Qashish IX consist of a single row of stones (Plans 24, 26, 28; Photos 72, 75, 77-80, 85, 87), no more than 50 cm wide. In the later phases, the walls are two rows of stones in width (Plans 34, 36; Photos 112-113). The construction of narrow walls at Tel Qashish is characteristic only of the MB II. Both the Early Bronze Age structures (Plans 2-3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 1 7, 1 9, 2 1 , 23) and those dating to the Late Bronze Age (from 325</page><page sequence="365">CHAPTER 18 Stratum VIIB on; Plans 34, 36, 38) were two rows of stones in width. This phenomenon, too, was observed in all regions: • The Jezreel Valley - Qashish IX, Yoqne'am XXIV-XXI, and Taanach (P.W. Lapp 1967: Fig. 11; 1969:25, Figs. 11, 12, 15-17). It should be noted that at Yoqne'am and Taanach, this method of construction is likewise character- istic exclusively of the Middle Bronze Age, with the LB I walls built two rows of stones in width. Another element common to Tel Qashish and Taanach is the round stone- built installation sunk into the floor in the center of the structure's courtyard (for Tel Qashish, see Plan 26, Photos 75, 85, 87; for Taanach, P.W. Lapp 1964: Fig. 7). Given the schematic nature of the plans in the Megiddo excavation report, it is not possible to relate to the question of the method of construction of the walls during the period under discussion. • The coastal plain - Mevorakh XIII {Mevorakh II: Pis. 16:1-2, 17:1-3). • The Shephelah - Tell Beit Mirsim (Albright 1938: PI. 49; Eitan 1972:19, 21-24) and the unfortified settlement of Giv'at Sharett (Bahat 1975:64-65; 1993:254). • The hill country - Tell el-Far'ah (North) (de Vaux 1952: Plan X; Mallet 1987: Plans 25-29), Shiloh ( Shiloh : Fig. 4.10), and Bethel (Kelso 1968: Pis. 91a, 97). • The Jordan Valley - Jericho ( Jericho III: Pis. 194-197, 336; Ussishkin 1989:34). CONCLUSIONS It appears that there are a number of common features in the MB II settlements of the various regions of Canaan. Most were surrounded by fortifications, in most of which the forti- fication wall incorporated towers of the types described above (on occasion several types together). Inside and contiguous with the wall were residential structures entered from a street running parallel to the line of fortifications. Access to the various quarters within the settlement was probably afforded by a pre-designed street network (Jericho and Giv'at Sharett). The residential structures were built between the streets, and are characterized by walls one row of stones in width. The construction of fortifications and a pre-designed street network suggest a "master plan," which raises a number of questions that, given our present state of knowl- edge, cannot be definitively answered. 1 . To what extent were the smaller settlements autonomous, as opposed to subordinate to a central administrative, economic, and political authority in the city-state? 2. Were the structures contiguous with the fortification wall connected with the administrative system or were they perhaps private buildings (e.g., dwellings) built only after the construction of the wall? If the latter, were they built by the inhabitants themselves only after the local authori- ties had completed the wall's construction and deter- mined the layout of the streets? 3. If the structures contiguous with the fortification wall represent part of the administrative-economic system of the local government or city-state, it may be possible to connect the magazines in the belt of structures surrounding the settlements to this system. Such maga- zines were found at Tel Qashish (see pp. 213-214), Tell el-Far'ah (North) (de Vaux 1951:346-397), Shiloh (Shiloh:6l-62), Jerusalem (Shiloh 1984:12), Jericho (. Jericho 111:368-369), Gezer (Seger 1983:481), and Giv'at Sharett (Bahat 1993:254). The excavations of the MB II remains on the various tels were mainly conducted on the edges of the mounds, thereby mostly exposing the settlements' fortifications and adjacent quarters. It is therefore not yet feasible to undertake a comparison between the assemblages found in the structures adjacent to the line of fortifications and those found in the settlement's nucleus to ascertain the degree of similarity between them. 326</page><page sequence="366">CHAPTER 19 TEL QASHISH IN THE MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGES: HISTORICAL IMPLICATIONS Amnon Ben-Tor and Ruhama Bonfil Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem Following the military campaign led by Thutmose III and the division of Canaan into several administrative provinces, a new order was established, different from that character- izing the region since the beginning of the 18th Dynasty (Ahituv 1978:105; Na'aman 1981:177-180; Weinstein 1981:12). Could this change be reflected in the Jezreel Valley by the changes that occurred between the strata attrib- uted to the Middle and Late Bronze Ages? Can this transition be accredited to the outcome of Thutmose Ill's campaign and can the destruction of Megiddo X (and not IX) and Yoqne'am XXI be correlated with this campaign? Further- more, can the occupational break that occurs at smaller, village sites, such as Qashish VIII or Mevorakh XII, be explained as a consequence of the same event? If so, Aharoni's identification of Tel Qashish with Helkath, No. 112 on Thutmose Ill's list of conquered places (1959:119-122; 1979:163) is preferable to its identification with Dabbeshet (see Introduction, p. 1). Alternatively, should we see these transitions as resulting from internal pressures affecting the Canaanite city-state system, which may have facilitated the establishment of Egyptian domination over Canaan? If the end of Middle Bronze Age strata such as Megiddo X, Yoqne'am XXI, Mevorakh XII, and Qashish VIII is seen as a result of Thutmose Ill's campaign, how can one explain the change that occurs at these sites towards the end of MB IIB (at Megiddo between Strata XI and X, at Yoqne'am between Strata XXII and XXI, at Mevorakh between Strata XIII and XII, and at Tel Qashish between Strata IXA and VIII)? Certain changes in architectural plans are evident, first and foremost in the fortifications, which may have gone out of use. Yet despite these changes, a general continuity in the basic plan of structures and in the ceramic typology is apparent. We are aware of the temptation, quite common in archaeological-historical reconstructions, to explain and correlate changes and even breaks in gradual architectural and ceramic evolutions with military campaigns and destructions. Such conclusions are not always justified, as already maintained, for example, by Kenyon - "There are no certain criteria for connecting the stratigraphical sequence in most sites with the re-conquest of Palestine by the Egyptian rulers of the Eighteenth Dynasty" (1973:531) - and, more recently, by Na'aman, who convincingly argues against the "Egyptian hypothesis" (1994:176). At the same time, Na'aman states that "It was a weakened, partly desolated and ruined country that Thutmose III was able to conquer and subdue following his decisive victory at Megiddo (c. 1457 B.C.)" (1994:175). It is precisely this conquest that is our point of departure in this discussion, and we are in complete agreement with Na'aman, given that the evidence presented above indicates that the conquest followed a period of decline, as reflected in the possible phasing out of the fortifications at several sites. This weakening, which we view, as mentioned above, as resulting from internal pressures affecting the Canaanite city-state system that may have facilitated the establishment of Egyptian domination over Canaan, may indeed have been a consequence of pressure caused by Na'aman's "northern groups" (1994: 1 76 ff.). Unlike Na'aman, however, we prefer to see this "weakened" phase as the final chapter of the Middle Bronze Age, rather than the first phase of the Late Bronze Age (Na'aman 1994:184). Another change (architectural but not ceramic) may be observed at the above-mentioned sites in a somewhat later phase (at Megiddo between Strata IX and VIII, at Yoqne'am between Strata XXA and XIXB, at Mevorakh between Strata XI and X, and at Tel Qashish between Strata VIII and VII [see Chapter 18, Table 25]). This change should perhaps be accredited to the military campaigns of Amenhotep II (year 9) or Thutmose IV (Weinstein 1981:13-14). 327</page><page sequence="367">PART III THE TRANSITIONAL LATE BRONZE/IRON AGE TO THE PERSIAN PERIOD IN AREA A</page><page sequence="368">CHAPTER 20 THE TRANSITIONAL LATE BRONZE/IRON AGE TO THE PERSIAN PERIOD IN AREA A Amnon Ben-Tor and Ruhama Bonfil Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem THE TRANSITIONAL LATE BRONZE/IRON AGE PHASE (Strata V-IV) STRATIGRAPHY (Plans 39-40) Located on the summit of the tei, Area A was severely disturbed by various activities, the latest occurring during Israel's War of Independence in 1948, when several trenches were dug and a cement bunker was constructed. The latest archaeological remains, close to the surface of the tel, were also severely damaged by repeated plowing, as well as erosion. Squares S-U/16-17 are located at the edge of the steep northern slope of the mound, which also contributed to the poor state of preservation of the remains. As a result, the walls are very fragmentary, prohibiting the formulation of coherent plans of structures attributable to the various upper strata in this area. The following description of the latest Late Bronze Age and early Iron Age remains at the site (Strata V-IV), there- fore, deals only with securely dated loci and pottery found on well-defined floors. This is based as much as possible on a continuous sequence of loci discerned in Square S/18, located at the highest point of the mound. The distinction between the remains of Stratum V and Stratum IV is extremely difficult: while in some places, a superposition of the walls and loci of these two strata could clearly be distinguished, in other parts of the excavated area this was not possible. It cannot be determined to which of the two strata the two massive walls W. 11 and W. 15 in Squares V-W/15-16, found just below the surface (Photos 130-131), should be attributed. The walls are rather fragmentary and do not form a coherent plan. We shall therefore deal only with walls and loci that are clearly later than Stratum VI and earlier than Stratum III, the ceramic finds from which, usually quite limited, can be dated to the Late Bronze Age (Figs. 125-127, 129) and Iron Age I (Figs. 128, 130-131). The most important walls are W. 1 1 and W. 1 5, against the outer faces of which a line of smaller stones was built (Photo 130). Since the walls are 1.5 m thick, they appear to be defensive in nature (a tower?), but due to the poor and fragmentary state of preservation, their function cannot be definitively determined. Two vessels, a painted storage jar (Fig. 125; Photo 133) and a Cypriot krater (Fig. 126; Photo 1 34) (see discussion below), are associated with these walls. Since several fragments of these two vessels were found within the two walls W. 1 1 and W. 15, however, they probably predate their construction. The corner of walls W. 1 and W. 7 in Square V/l 7 (Plan 39; Photo 131) probably belongs to a dwelling, the orientation of which corresponds to that of the "tower"; an alley seems to have separated the two structures. The corner of walls W. 94 and W. 211 A in Square U/17 seems to belong to the same system. These fragmentary dwellings apparently belong to the last phase of Late Bronze Age (Stratum V). Wall W. 21 1 in Square T/17 separates L. 371 from L. 374 (Photo 132; Section H-H' in Squares T/17- 18). This wall has a long lifespan, and may have been in use both in Stratum V (together with W. 211 A) and Stratum IV. It could not be determined, however, whether the wall has two structural phases or only one. L. 37 1 , which produced Late Bronze Age Photo 130.

Similarly, two floors were associated with W. 217 (Squares T/17-18): L. 218, of Late Bronze Age date (Fig. 129), belongs to the early phase of the wall, while L. 214, of Iron I date (Fig. 130:5-22), belongs to the later phase. The superposition of these two loci is significant: although L. 2 1 8 of the Late Bronze Age is indeed somewhat higher than L. 374, this might be explained by the natural incline of the northern slope of the mound (Section H-H' in Plan 4U.

The cooking pot rims (Figs. 128:1-3) seem to belong to the earlier phase and are out of context in L. 374. Apparently, these loci represent the Late Bronze-Iron I transitional phase. Stone pavement L. 331 (Plan 40), with Iron I pottery (Fig. 131), covers W. 211 A, indicating that this wall was in use only in Stratum V. W. 209 in Square S/18 is cut by the Stratum III installation (Plans 41, 43; Photo 136), indicating a Stratum V or IV dating for this wall. W. 209 and pavement L. 363 in Square S/l 7 both seem to belong to Stratum IV: the former because it forms a corner with W. 209A (the western continuation of W. 211) and the latter due to its elevation. W. 30 in Square T/16 and W. 32 in Square S/16 are clearly later than Stratum VI, since they are built on top of the pave- ments of this stratum. The only floor associated with these walls is the fragmentary stone pavement in Square S/16 asso- ciated with installation L. 63, as well as with W. 32. The few sherds found in these squares do not allow for a determina- tion as to whether these walls belong to Stratum V or IV. THE STRATUM V CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE (Fig. 127) Stratum V was exposed in a very limited area due to its poor state of preservation. Only one floor (L. 371 in Square T/17) could be securely attributed to this stratum. Bowls (B) Apart from bowls of Type B Vie, which first occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum V, the remaining bowls are known already in earlier assemblages and belong to Types B la, B Ilia, and B Illbl. Type B la: Simple rounded rim (Fig. 127: 1 ; Photo 135). Only one such bowl, with a relatively small diameter, was found in a Stratum V context. Bowls of this type occur at Tel Qashish from Stratum VIII, and it is possible to distinguish between the Stratum VIII examples and those that first occur in Stratum VIIB by the size of the bowls. These become smaller in Stratum VIIB, and also exhibit a tendency towards greater depth in the later strata. Type Billa: Small inwards-folded rim (Fig. 127:2-3). Bowls with a thickened rim first occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum IXA. Similar bowls were found in assemblages dated to the LB I at Megiddo (Stratum IX) and to the LB II at Mevorakh (Stratum X). Type B Illbl: Large inwards-folded rim (Fig. 127:4). These bowls already occur at Tel Qashish in Strata VIIB and VILA. Type B Vie: Ledge rim (Fig. 127:5). This type is found at Tel Qashish only in Stratum V. Paint-decorated bowls with a similar profile were found at Megiddo in Stratum VIIB (2131) and Mevorakh X. The Megiddo assemblage includes vessels that seem to belong to the LB II, as well as those belonging to the beginning of the Iron I. Open Carinated Bowls (OB) L. 37 1 produced a single rim that seems to belong to an open carinated bowl (Fig. 127:6). As its point of carination is missing, it cannot be determined whether it belongs to Type OB Ha or OB lib. Photo 135. Bowl (Fig. 127:1). Cooking Pots (CP) All the cooking pots found in Stratum V belong to Type CP III sub-classes: CP Ilia, CP Hid, and CP lile. Type CP Ilia: Simple triangular or wavy triangular rim (Fig. 127:13-14). Cooking pots of this type occur in Strata VIII-V (the fragment found in Stratum IXA is intru- sive). In Strata VIIB-VI, these cooking pots comprise the most common type. As in previous strata, in Stratum V, too, the simple triangular rim (Fig. 127:13) occurs alongside the wavy triangular rim (Fig. 127:14). Type CP Hid: Folded triangular rim (Fig. 127:11-12). Type CP Hid cooking pots first occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum V (the rim of this type found in Stratum VI is appar- ently intrusive). Parallels come from Mevorakh X. Type CP nie: Short triangular rim (Fig. 127:15-16). This type first occurs in Stratum VIIB. Jugs (J) Most of the jugs found in Stratum V belong to Type J IVc. The two exceptions are jug rims of Types J Ha and J IVd. Type J Ila: Simple triangular rim (Fig. 127:21). Jugs of this type occur at Tel Qashish from Stratum X. The Stratum V rim is thick compared to those from the earlier strata and may be intrusive. Type J IVc: Small, thickened folded rim (Fig. 127:17-19). Rims of this type first appear in Stratum VI. It is difficult to ascertain whether they belong to jugs or storage jars of Type SJ Vila. Type J IVd: Large, thickened folded rim (Fig. 127:20). The sole occurrence of this type is in Stratum V. Storage Jars (SJ) Apart from a storage jar rim of Type SJ lib (found in a fill and probably intrusive), all the Stratum V storage jars are of Type S J Vila. 336</page><page sequence="374">THE TRANSITIONAL LATE BRONZE/IRON AGE TO THE PERSIAN PERIOD IN AREA A Type SJ Vila: Simple ring rim (Fig. 127:22-23). These are decorated with horizontal black and red painted lines. Painted storage jar (Fig. 125; Photo 133). This storage jar, found in an unclear stratigraphie context, is decorated with more elaborate motifs. Since the upper part is missing, it was not included in this typology. Miscellaneous The ceramic assemblage from L. 371 included several vessels that were not classified within this typology. 1 . A biconical jug (?) (Fig. 1 27:7). This vessel, which is not of the high-necked type, is white-slipped and decorated with black paint. A similar rim was found at Mevorakh XI (Mevorakh II: Fig 7:3). 2. Chalice bases (Fig. 127:8-10). It cannot be determined whether all the chalice bases had holes, like the example depicted in Fig. 127:8. 3. "Fire Dog" (Fig. 127:26). Vessels of this group were found in assemblages belonging to the end of the LB II and to the LB II-Iron I transition. 4. The rim of a basket-handled vessel (Fig. 127:25). Imported Vessels L. 371 included several fragments of Cypriot vessels belonging to the White Shaved (Fig. 127:27), Milk Bowl (Fig. 127:28), and Base-Ring (Fig. 127:29-32) groups. A Cypriot krater/pithos (Fig. 126; Photo 134) of the pithos group characteristic of the LC II was also found. The Base- Ring group includes a bowl (Fig. 127:29), a tankard jug (Fig. 127:30), and jugs of the bilbil type (Fig. 127:31-32). The tankard jug (Fig. 127:30) apparently belongs to Type VII according to Gittlen's classification. These vessels first occur in Israel at the beginning of the LB I, and their frequency peaks in the LB II, declining in the second half of this period (Gittlen 1977:71, 124). The necked krater (Fig. 126; Photo 134) has several char- acteristics: 1 . Short, narrow neck. 2. Carination on the upper part of the vessel. 3. Two ear handles on the shoulder. 4. Incised wavy decoration on the shoulder. 5. Flat disc base. 6. The greenish material of which it was made is not charac- teristic of the Late Bronze Age vessels at Tel Qashish. A pétrographie examination of the krater was carried out by Y. Goren at the petrography laboratory of the Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv University. Goren reports that under the microscope, the matrix is seen as nearly isotropic (devoid of optical properties, hence almost vitrified), silty clay. The firing temperature is estimated at 800-900° C. The silt is dense (30%) and contains (in order of frequency) mica minerals, quartz, oxyhornblende, pyroxene, feldspars, and epidote. The inclusions (5%- 10%) include medium-sorted, angular to subangular minerals and rock fragments of various types. These include: hornblende (partly or completely altered into oxyhornblende by firing), both as separate crystals and as rock fragments (amphibolite); twinned plagioclase feldspar; K-feldspar with a granophyric texture; weathered spilitic basalt; greywacke; and dolerite. This assemblage clearly points to an alien source, since most of these components are not found in the Levant south of Iskanderun Bay. The rock and mineral suite clearly points to an ophiolitic complex. On typological and technological grounds, the island of Cyprus seems to be the most likely origin of this krater. Several components within the silt and inclusions suggest that in this case, the area of Kouklia or Paphos should be favored. This is evident in the high frequency of mica minerals (suggesting a schistose province nearby), the greywacke, and the amphibolite. All these are typical of the Mamonia complex of the westernmost part of Cyprus and its bordering terrains. Comparative materials from Cyprus indicate that a southern Cypriot coastal site (i.e., Amathus, Kourion, or Kition) is unlikely, since the angular shape of the inclusions suggests a source that is near their parent rocks, unseen in the local pottery at these sites. Similar petrofabrics were found in thin sections of Roman and Medieval plain wares from Paphos. In the latter, amphi- bolite dominates the inclusion assemblage, as in the case of the krater under discussion. As this krater was found in an unclear stratigraphie context (see the above stratigraphie discussion and the painted storage jar [Fig. 125; Photo 133]), its dating cannot be based on stratigraphy. Pétrographie analysis shows that it probably originated in Cyprus, where a vessel closely related to the Tel Qashish example was found at Sanidha, at the southern foot of the Trodoos Mountains. This vessel too, however, was found in an unclear stratigraphie context (Todd et al. 1991:44, 47). The site of Sanidha is an ancient settlement dating from the MB II-Late Bronze Age transi- tion, with the main stratum assigned to the LC IIB (14th century BCE [Ibid. 1991:37, 39-40]). The excavators note that the krater belongs to a well-defined group dating from the LC II. This group of large vessels (ranging in height from 56 to 80 cm and in rim diameter from 22 to 44 cm) includes pithoi and particularly large kraters, which have the following characteristics (Schuster Keswani 1989: 12-15): 1. Most are hand-made. 2. A thickened rim, either square or rounded. 3 . A neck 5-1 3 cm in height. 4. Incised wavy decoration on the shoulder. 5. The material from which the vessels were made is of various greenish hues (from 5 YR 6/8 to 10 YR 7/3 on the Munsell chart). This group, which includes parallels for the Tel Qashish krater, is represented at a number of sites on Cyprus and at Ugarit. On Cyprus, examples were found at Sanidha and Maa -Palaeokastro (Karageorghis and Demas 1988:122, Pl. CXCrV:530) in assemblages attributed to the LC IIC (Herscher 1991:57-61), and at Kalavasos-^y/os Dhimitrios (Ibid. : Fig. 1 6:2 1-23), where the kraters, while similar, differ in their proportions and base shapes. Ugarit yielded several kraters belonging to this group, the dimensions of one of which were similar to the Tel Qashish vessel (Schaeffer 1949: Fig. 85:15), while another was larger (Ibid.: Fig. 86:16).

Three vessel types first occur at Tel Qashish in Stratum V: a small bowl of Type B Vie, a Type CP Illd cooking pot, and a Type J IVd jug, as well as a fragment belonging to the so- called "Fire Dog" group. Most of the remainder of the vessels attributed to Stratum V have a long lifespan: bowls of Type B Ilia that first occur in Stratum IXA and vessels that first appear in Stratum VIII: bowls of Type B la (from Stratum VII on their diameter is smaller and in Stratum V they are deeper) and cooking pots of Type CP Ilia (especially common in Strata VIIA-V) and of Type CP lile (the frequency of which increases in Stratum VI). Another group first occurs in Stratum VIIB: Type B Illbl bowls and Type K IV kraters, represented in this assemblage by examples from a fill attributed to Stratum V. The number of vessels from Stratum V with a relatively short lifespan is few: jugs of Type J IVc, which first occur in Stratum VI; bowls of Type B Vie; and cooking pots of Type CP Hid, which apparently occur exclusively in Stratum V. Most of the parallels for these vessels come from LB II assemblages, with some deriving from assemblages attrib- uted to the end of this period. As noted above, some of these vessels have a long lifespan, with parallels also found in assemblages attributed to the LB I. The presence of cooking pots of Type CP Hid and the "Fire Dog" vessel indicate that Stratum V should be dated to the end of the LB II. THE STRATUM V/IV CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE (Figs. 128-131) Unlike the Late Bronze Age assemblage, no ceramic typology was formulated for the Iron Age pottery from Tel Qashish. As mentioned above, the Iron Age strata at the site were exposed only in a limited area and were severely disturbed, as a result of which very few assemblages are stratigraphically secure. Most of the Iron Age ceramic reper- toire of the Yoqne'am Regional Project comes from neighboring Tel Yoqne'am, where it is well stratified. This pottery will be discussed at length in the final report on the Iron Age period at Yoqne'am (currently in preparation). Consequently, it was decided to treat the Iron Age material from Strata IV-IIB at Tel Qashish in a more general manner. The ceramic repertoire of Stratum IV comes from L. 374 (Fig. 128), L. 214 (Fig. 130:5-22), and L. 331 (Fig. 131:1-8). The following characteristics are note- worthy: a) The relatively high proportion of cooking pots that continue the tradition of everted rim cooking pots of the Bronze Age (Figs. 128:1-3; 130:13-17; 131:5-6), appearing side by side with straight-rimmed Iron Age cooking pots (Fig. 131:7). The same phenomenon was observed at Yoqne'am. b) The almost complete absence, except for two or three fragments from unclear contexts, of Philistine sherds (Fig. 131:9). Of the three sites studied in the framework of the Yoqne'am Regional Project, the appearance of cooking pots continuing the Bronze Age tradition in Iron Age loci was observed at Tel Qashish and Yoqne'am. It is, of course, possible that this apparent contemporaneity of the two types of cooking pots results from the disturbed nature of the remains. As for the scarcity of Philistine ware, a similar phenomenon also char- acterizes the Iron I strata at Yoqne'am, in contrast to the abundance of such ware found within a limited excavated area at Tel Qiri (Qiri: 91, 200-201, Figs. 18, 19:1-3, 25:12-13, 42:1-7, Photos 42, 43:1, 6). Collared-rim jars are common at all three sites, and the secondary use of chipped bases from these large vessels observed at Tel Qashish (Fig. 128:4) and Qiri (Qiri: 91, Fig. 17:7) is unknown at Yoqne'am. We therefore suggest that Stratum V represents the latest Late Bronze Age occupation at the site, while Stratum IV should be dated to the Iron I. It should be reiterated, however, that due to the limited extent of the excavation, the severely damaged state of the walls, and the highly disturbed nature of the ceramic assemblages attributed to Strata V-IV, the above observations should be treated with reservation. 340</page><page sequence="378">THE TRANSITIONAL LATE BRONZE/IRON AGE TO THE PERSIAN PERIOD IN AREA A Fig. 128.

Only three of these squares - S-T/18 and S/17 - can, however, be included in the stratigraphie presentation; the other three were too damaged as a result of their proximity to the edge of the slope, as well as by Persian period pits (L. 55, Plan 38) and later disturbances. The main loci attributable to this phase are L. 204 and L. 209 in Square S/l 8, the latter a round installation made of large flat stone slabs and the former a floor associated on one hand with the rim of the installation and on the other with W. 13. L. 207 in Square S/17 is a sloping floor (55.20/55.05) associated with W. 208 and W. 208a. The material shown in Fig. 133:3-4, 6-7 dates from the Persian period and is obvi- ously out of context in Stratum UIC. It probably originates from a pit dug in Stratum IIA or Stratum I. Other loci that may belong to this phase are L. 202 and L. 205 in Square T/18. This area, however, was severely disturbed by modern activities and also contained glass frag- ments and tin cans. No ceramic finds originating in this square, therefore, are presented. Installation L. 209 was dug into W. 209 of the earlier phase (Plans 39, 43; Photo 136). It is built of thin slabs of stone lining a circular pit with slightly sloping sides dug into the ground, and a flat base lined with similar slabs (Plan 43; Photo 1 37). Akrater (Fig. 132:5; Photo 138) was neatly fitted into an opening at the meeting point of the base and wall in the southeastern part of the installation, clearly for the purpose of collecting liquid. It should be noted that a very similar installation dated to the same period was found at Yoqne'am, except that the liquid was collected not in a krater but in a storage jar (Ben-Tor et al. 1 987 : 1 6). It can be assumed that both installa- tions had a similar function, connected with agricultural production. The walls in Square S/l 8 and the adjoining squares do not present a coherent plan: W. 208 and W. 208a seem to form a corner. The location of these walls in the western balk of Photo 136.

The same applies to the fragmetary walls W. 25 and W. 27 (+W. 26). If these walls indeed belong to one system, part of a large-scale structure may tentatively be reconstructed in these squares (see Plan 42). 345 I S T ! ££ 55.52 B g.« ££ j_ r^ri^n 55.52 55 40 JR g.« 5bot&gt; j_ OS 55 40 sJ 16 K ° 0 I L.55 I !

The loci attributable to Stratum HIB are L. 201 and L. 203 in Square S/l 8, both asso- ciated with W. 202 and situated above installation L. 209 (Plans 43^44). W. 202 probably forms a corner with W. 206 in Square S/l 7. W. 207 probably also belongs to this system. Since no floor was discerned in the area between W. 206 and W. 207 and the northern end of W. 202, the exact strati- graphic attribution of W. 206 and 207 cannot be determined. L. 29, discussed below as belonging to Stratum IIIA (Plan 45), has to be divided into two, although it was excavated as one locus. Its lower part, however, is lower than the base level of the oven (55.68) attributed to Stratum IIIA; there- fore, the lowest 28 cm of L. 29 (55.68-55.40) are earlier than the L. 29 floor. This lowest part is therefore designated L. 29b and its ceramic content (Fig. 135:14-23) assigned to Stratum HIB, while the upper part is designated L. 29a (see Stratum IIIA below). The ceramic repertoire of this phase is rather poor, including mainly the pottery from L. 201 (Fig. 134:1-5 [the items depicted in Fig. 134:6-7 are intrusive]), L. 29b (Fig. 135:14-23), and perhaps also L. 203 (Fig. 134:8-13). The kraters made of "sandy" clay (Fig. 134:12) deserve special attention, as they seem to belong to the Phoenician ceramic repertoire. The painted storage jar fragment (Fig. 135:23), as well as the Bichrome bowl (Fig. 135:14), also belong to this category. Plan 44.

The main remains attributable to this phase are W. 12 and the abutting oven L. 37. W. 202A built on top of Stratum HIB W. 202 also belongs to this phase. No floor was identified in L. 39 and L. 208. The base of the oven is at 55.68, thus defining the lowest elevation possible for this phase. The pertinent locus is L. 29a. The oven itself (L. 37) was made of clay and lined with sherds and small stones. The sherds are two fragments of cooking pots and two of kraters (Fig. 135:1-4). The few sherds from L. 29a (Fig. 135:5-13) - bowls, cooking pots, and storage jars - are similar to those found in the previous Stratum HIB. A date in the 9th century BCE is probably indicated for Stratum IIIA. Plan 45. Area A: Stratum IIIA. STRATUM II (Plans 46-47) Two phases were discerned in Stratum II: the earlier (IIB) is dated to the Iron Age III and the later (IIA) to the Persian period. Architectural remains of this stratum were found in Square R/17 (Photos 139-140; in Squares S/17-18, Stratum III is directly beneath the surface). The remains of Stratum II in Square R/17 are ca. 1 m deeper than those of Stratum III in the adjacent Square S/18, which is difficult to explain. The only logical explanation is that in addition to its location on the slope, and hence topo- graphically lower than Square S/18, the builders of the Stratum IIB structures dug deeper foundations than those of the preceding stratum. 352 Stratum IIB (Plan 46, Fig. 136) Walls W. 223 and 231, W. 224, W. 225, and W. 228, all in a single square(!), are attributable to this stratum.

The only floor is L. 398, associated with W. 225 and W. 23 1 . Since the surface to the north of W. 225 was severely disturbed by pit L. 414, no floor could be discerned in this part of the square. The ceramic assemblage and the fíbula (Photo 141) found in L. 414 are presented in Fig. 137.Dueto the disturbed nature of the area, the pottery repertoire is clearly mixed. The ceramic material from L. 398 (Fig. 136:1-13) differs considerably from that of the previous stratum, as demonstrated by the red-slipped and burnished kraters (Fig. 136:4-5), as well as by the modelled rims of the cooking pots (Fig. 136:6-9). The two complete bowls (Fig. 136:14-15) found in the fill under the L. 398 floor also clearly belong to this horizon. A date in the Iron Age III is clearly indicated. Fig. 136.

No pottery was found on floor L. 387; the only artifact from this floor is an Ottoman clay pipe (Fig. 1 54: 1 0, p. 38 1 ), a stray find that does not contribute to the dating of these walls. L. 388, a fill below L. 387 and above L. 392 of Stratum IIA, is also characterized by Persian pottery, such as cooking pots, storage jars andjuglets (Fig. 139). A Persian period pit, L. 55+70 (Fig. 140:1-6) in Square T/l 6 (Plan 39), produced a small Cypriot jug dating from this period (Fig. 140:1; Photo 144). The ceramic material found in this pit dates from the Late Bronze, Iron II, and Persian periods, the last providing the date of the pit. Several isolated finds from Areas A and B, such as sherds and coins (see Chapter 2 1 ), are attributable to the Hellenistic, Islamic, and Mamluk periods. These are mainly surface finds and represent some kind of human activity at the site in these periods. Since no architectural remains can be attributed to Photo 144.

However, scat- tered remains and finds from all the subsequent periods represented at Tel Qashish, from the Middle Bronze Age to the Ottoman period, were uncovered in Area B. Due to the massive recent disturbances, among them intensive agricul- tural activity, these remains are isolated and only fragmen- tary floors, if any, are associated with the architectural features (Plans 49-50). THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE (STRATA X-IX) Most of the remains of the settlement dating from this period were found in Area A, where a fortification system as well as dwellings dating from the MB II were excavated. In Area B, which was probably outside the fortified settlement of this period (see above, p. 319), the remains are very meager. The possibility that Stratum XI in Area B, consisting of a series of dwellings constructed of very small stones (Plans 11-12), may be dated to the Middle Bronze Age is discussed above (pp. 92-95). This stratum, however, may date from the Early Bronze Age. Plan 50. Area B: Squares AH-AI/16-17. Middle Bronze Age pottery was found in Squares AG/15-16 in Area B, in L. AG/16 (Fig. 142:1-3), L. 133 (Fig. 142:7-8), and L. 134 (Fig. 142:9-10), none of which is clearly associated with any architectural remains: not a single floor attributable to this period was identified. These find were at elevations that may relate to fragmentary walls W. 119 and W. 253, which perhaps belonged to one unit, as suggested in Plan 49. Three almost complete Middle Bronze Age vessels were found in L.139 in Square AG/15 (Plan 9; Fig. 142:5-6; Photo 146) and L. 621 in Squares AH-AI/16 (Plan 50; Fig. 142:11; Photo 147). A considerable number of Middle Bronze Age sherds was found in later contexts, mainly in Iron Age pits, such as L. 252 and L. 266 in Square AI/16 (Plan 49), and L. 570 in Square AI/17 (Plan 50; Fig. 143). We are unable to determine to which of the two Middle Bronze Age strata defined in Area A (Strata X and IX) the material excavated in Area B belongs. The following should, however, be noted: 1. Cooking pots with straight walls (Fig. 142:4, 6 [Photo 146]) appear in Area A exclusively in Stratum IXC, where they are all of the variety without holes below the rim (see p. 284). 2. The only fragment of Tell el-Yahudiyah ware found at the site (Fig. 143:15) originates in an Iron Age pit. 3. The jar (Fig. 142:5), cooking pots with a gutter rim (Fig. 143:8-1 1), and the storage jar fragment with white slip and a red band decoration (Fig. 143:26) seem to date from early in the period. 4. The carinated bowl (Fig. 142:2), storage jar with a ridged rim (Fig. 143:22), and ridged-rim krater (Fig. 143:4), however, seem to date from later in the period. Photo 146.

These include Bichrome (Fig. 144:1-2) and White Painted (Fig. 144:8) ware of the early phases of the period, as well as painted ware (Fig. 144:5-7) and cooking pots (Fig. 144:3-4) dating from a later phase of the Late Bronze Age. Since, in contrast to all the earlier and later periods, only sherds and no complete vessels from the Late Bronze Age were found in Area B, it is impossible to determine whether they were washed down to Area B from the Late Bronze Age settlement in Area A on the higher part of the tei, or whether they represent human activity in Area B itself in this period.

This wall cut through the western part of the Area B Stratum XI dwellings (see pp. 92-95 above; Plans 11-12; Photo 38). No floor is associated with this wall, but its foundation trench yielded sherds of various periods, the latest of which date from the Iron II (Fig. 145:11-15). The three Persian period pits, L. 128 in Square AH/15, L. 255 in Square AH/16, and L. 262 in Square AH/16) (Fig. 153:1-3), cut into W. 1 20 (Plan 49), clearly indicating that W. 1 20 went out of use in the Persian period, but possibly already in the Iron Age. These considerations have a bearing on the dating of Stratum XI in Area B, which was severely damaged by W. 120 (see discussion above, pp. 92-95). W. 120 is problematic from the viewpoint not only of its dating but also of its function. It is 2.8 m thick, making it the most massive wall at the site in any period, its width compa- rable only to that of the Early Bronze Age fortification wall, W. 305. There is, however, no relationship between these two walls, with the fortification wall located some 4 m to the east and built in a different manner. W. 1 20 ends abruptly in a straight line at its northern end, while its southern part, to the south of Square AH/16, is missing. The tabun in L. 1 1 8 is located approximately 1 .5 m to the east of W. 120, in the corner of Stratum XI walls W. 107 and W. 109 (Plan 11), and is clearly associated with these walls, as well as with the adjacent stone pavement, as indicated by its position vis-à-vis the walls and its elevation. While the Iron Age sherds presented in Fig. 145:11-15 were found in the foundation trench of W. 120, those found near the tabun in L. 118 (Fig. 145:l-10)are problematic. The krater (Fig. 145:2) and cooking pots (Fig. 145:3-4) date the assemblage to the Iron II. The relationship between the tabun and the architectural unit with which it seems to be associ- ated, on the one hand, and the Iron Age assemblage, on the other, remains an open question. Several pits should also be dated to the Iron II. The most impressive assemblage of the period thus far found at the site comes from L. 253 in Squares AG/14-15 (Fig. 146:1-8; Photos 148-149). The knobbed bowl (Fig. 1 46:1), the kernos bowl (Fig. 146:3; Photos 149-150), the jug (Fig. 146:7; Photo 149), and the globular jug with black-on-red decora- tion (Fig. 146:6; Photo 149) date this assemblage to the 10th century BCE. The pottery found in pit L. 282 (Fig. 146:9-10), north of pit L. 253, dates from the same period. Another series of pits in Squares AI/15-16, L. 252, 265, 266, 292, 570, 571, and 572 (Plans 49-50; Figs. 147-148), also seem to date from the same period, as Photo 148. Area B: Excavating Iron Age II pit (L. 253). 370</page><page sequence="407">THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE TO THE OTTOMAN PERIOD IN AREA B Photo 149. L. 253 assemblage (Fig. 146:1-3, 6-8). indicated by the cooking pots (Figs. 147:8-9, 148:2-3) and the Cypro-Phoenician material (Figs. 147:1, 3-5, 148:7). The date of these pits, therefore, corresponds to that of Stratum UIC or HIB in Area A. Floor L. 51 OB in Square AH/17 (Plan 50) also seems to date from the Iron II. It is not associated with an architectural element, however, due to the limited area in which it was exposed. The pottery found on this floor (Fig. 149:1-12) is comprised mainly of cooking pots of the massive triangular rim type (Fig. 149:2-7). This is the type of cooking pot, dating from the 10th century BCE, on the rims of which incised signs often appear (Fig. 149:2; Qiri: 224-235). Walls W. 327, W. 302, and W. 333 in Squares AH-AI/16-17 are part of the most massively built Iron Age unit found at the site thus far (Plan 49; Photos 1 5 1-1 52). The walls were preserved to a maximum height of 0.7 m and are built (especially W. 302) of very large stones, several of which measure 1 *0.7 m. W. 327 meets W. 302 and W. 333 at an unusually oblique angle. W. 333 may perhaps be somewhat earlier than the other two walls. The building was apparently in use for a considerable period of time, and three floors in Square AI/17 are associ- ated with it: these are, from earliest to latest, L. 558, L. 554, Photo 151. Latest architectural elements in Area B, looking north (Squares AI/16-17). Photo 150. Iron Age kernos (Fig. 146:3). and L. 546, all made of beaten earth. A meager amount of pottery was associated with these floors (Fig. 1 50; Nos. 2-3 are clearly intrusive). In the adjacent Square AH/1 7, the situ- ation is somewhat different, although it, too, contained three floors associated with the building: L. 510A (Fig. 149:13-18), probably contemporaneous with L. 558; stone paved L. 508B, probably contemporaneous with L. 554; and stone paved L. 508A, associated with W. 301 built in the latest phase. The problem is the correlation between the two upper floors, L. 546 in Square AI/17 and L. 508A in Square AH/17. Since the difference in elevation Photo 152. Architectural elements in Squares AI/15- 16 (in fore- ground, Iron Age walls; in background, EB walls of Stratum XI). 371</page><page sequence="408">CHAPTER 21 between these two floors is 0.2 m, they cannot represent two parts of the same system. The floor in Square AH/17 that corresponds to L. 546 in Square AI/ 1 7 and the floor in Square AI/17 that corresponds to L. 508 A in Square AH/17 are both missing. The pottery associated with these two uppermost floors is also problematic: the material found on floor 508A in Square AH/17 (Fig. 152:11-20) seems to be earlier than that found on the floor L. 546 in Square AI/1 7 (Fig. 1 50: 1-3). The latter includes sherds that may date from the Persian period (Fig. 1 50:2-3), but these could be intrusive due to the proximity of the floor to the surface of the tel. It seems that the unit under discussion should be dated to the Iron Age II- III, corresponding to the dating of Strata III- IIB in Area A. This was perhaps one large structure, consisting of several spacious units. The walls may have enclosed an unroofed area or courtyard. The upper parts of the walls of this structure protruded above the present-day surface of the mound (Photos 151-152), and the original walls were probably considerably damaged, some even completely removed, as a result of the pits dug later, such as L. 514 and 515 in Square AH/17, as well as recent agricul- tural activity. Several extremely fragmentary walls and stone pave- ments were found in Area B: W. 255 and W. 257 in Square AF/14; W. 258 and pavement L. 296 in Square AF/15; W. 252 in Square AF/16; and W. 254 in Square AI/16. These features are far too fragmentary to form a coherent plan and could not be dated. Fig. 145. Area B: Iron Age II pottery (L. 118). No. Object Reg.

The pottery found in these loci is presented in Fig. 153:1-5 and Photos 153-154. The Hellenistic assemblage (Fig. 153:6-8) comes from L. 27 1 in Square AF/1 6. Additional Hellenistic period sherds (Fig. 154: 1-6) and five coins (Photo 155: 1-5) were found on the surface. The coins span the 4th-3rd centuries BCE and were identified by Professor Ya'akov Meshorer of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem. Several sherds originating on the surface as well as in pits in both areas of excavation may be attributed to the Islamic, Mamluk, and Ottoman periods (Fig. 154:7-11). These finds represent some human activity at the site in these periods. Since no architectural remains can be attributed to any of these periods, they were not assigned stratum numbers. 380</page><page sequence="417">THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE TO THE OTTOMAN PERIOD IN AREA B Photo 155.

L. 323, Reg. No. 2171 (Fig. 155:1); 2. L. 211, Reg. No. 733 (Fig. 155:3); and 3. L. 251, Reg. No. 947 (Fig. 155:4). As all three come from loci that were close to the surface and disturbed, the following discussion is limited to stylistic considerations. It is hoped that this detailed analysis of the finds and compara- tive material will place the Tel Qashish fragments in their proper cultural context. DESCRIPTION Fragment No. 1 (Fig. 155:1) Head of a figurine (height ca. 3.5 cm), made in a closed, double mold. The "seam" between the two parts of the mold is clearly visible, forming a distinct edge on both sides of the head. Broken at the top and neck. The clay is light brown and well baked throughout, without a gray core. There are some, mostly white, large Fig. 155. Clay figurines: 1, 3-4: Fragments from Tel Qashish; 2: Figurine from Megiddo (after Guy 1938: PI. 155:9). 387</page><page sequence="422">CHAPTER 22 grits. The back is hand smoothed, but the surface left uneven, with bits of surplus clay folded over. The woman is wearing high headgear, set low on her forehead. The edges of the headgear are delineated by deep grooves, and its surface is subdivided by eight vertical grooves. There is no trace of hair on either side of the face. The ears are large and modelled in detail, and the large eyes are deeply molded. The left eye is well preserved; the relief of the right eye is damaged and only the contours are visible. Similarly, both the relief and the surface of the lower part of the face are damaged: the nose is flattened and the mouth non-existent. The back of the head is not sculptured. Fragment No. 2 (Fig. 155:3) Fragment of a figurine (height ca. 7.5 cm) preserved from the head to the lower body. Very little remained of the plaque on which the figure is superimposed: its bottom tip is broken off and the edges are damaged and broken. The figurine was made in an open, one-piece mold. The image was frontally impressed into the clay and a frame-like line encloses the body at the sides, separating it from the edges of the plaque. The back is flat, slightly arched at the top and bottom. The clay is gray to brownish-gray, the surface hand smoothed. Numerous minute dark grits, as well as some larger white grits, are visible, especially on the back. The woman's head is flattened on the top and her face is nearly triangular, with a very low forehead and high cheek- bones. The hair seems to have been parted at the top of the head, but there is no parting line and the surface is damaged. The hair is long, and its two tresses, made of separate coils of clay, fall on the shoulders on both sides of the face and slightly curl at the ends. The eyebrows, delineated in high relief, are long and triangular, forming an almost continuous horizontal line across the face. The left eye is elongated and slanted; the right eye and nose are damaged and the mouth obliterated. The arms are clearly molded but schematic and crescent-like, encircling the breasts. The remaining part of the body is devoid of details. When complete, the figurine seems to have been narrow and elongated in its proportions. Fragment No. 3 (Fig. 155:4) Fragment of a figurine (height ca. 5.5 cm) preserved from the hips and pubic triangle to mid-calf. The surface of the legs rises slightly at the lower end, possibly towards the feet. The figurine was made in an open, one-piece mold, with the image frontally impressed into the clay. The back of the plaque is convex, the right side edge is intact and knife- pared, and the left side edge is damaged. The surface is hand smoothed, especially between the legs, where the imprint of a finger is visible on the surface. The clay is brownish, with a gray core, strewn with dark and some white grits of various sizes. The image is molded in high, rather detailed relief. The legs are thin and set apart from each other, with bulging knees, and the hips are rounded. The pubic triangle, deeply set and delineated by incisions, is divided by a vertical groove in the middle. Above its upper line are a few remnants of short vertical grooves. 388 DISCUSSION Fragment No. 1 (Fig. 155:1) Although only the head of this figurine was found in the excavations, there can be little doubt as to its original shape. The Tel Qashish head is very similar to that of the complete figurine from Megiddo, M. 598 (reproduced in Fig. 155:2), found in Tomb 26B and dated to the LB I- II (May 1935: Pl. XXXL598, dated "M-LB?"; Guy 1938:103, PI. 155:9; Pritchard 1954:161, No. 467, and p. 303). In fact, the headgear on both is identical in shape, dimensions, and in the number of grooves (8) on the surface, as if both were made in the same mold. The Tel Qashish head, however, is more elon- gated than that of the Megiddo figurine. The torso of another such figurine was found in Tomb 38, which was dated on the basis of its pottery principally to the LB I (Guy 1938:82, PI. 139:25), and a second, dated "LB," comes from Tomb 989 Bl, with mostly LB II and some LB I pottery (Ibid.:40, PI. 99:2). All three tombs were disturbed in antiquity. More figurines of the same type were subsequently excavated at Megiddo by the expedition of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. These mainly come from Stratum VIII (Loud 1948:149, 157, 159, PI. 242:8-10), with one found in Stratum VILA (Ibid.: 171, Pl. 243:16). The mold of a similar head was found at Megiddo already by Schumacher (1908:102, 103:158a ["from the palace, along the east wall ]; cf. May 1935: Discussion ofPl. XXXI; Lamon and Shipton 1939:55). Another figurine should be added to Schumacher's finds; exhibited at the Israel Museum, it belongs to the Reifenberg collection and was listed by the collector as coming from "Megiddo, Schumacher's excavation" (Reifenberg 1937: Pl. 3 on right; Kahane 1968:71, Pl. 56 in center). The head and body of this figurine are two separate fragments that at some point were glued together. Without taking them apart it is impossible to determine whether these are parts of the same figurine or whether they belonged to two different figurines of the same type excavated at Megiddo. Of interest to us is the fact that this head is also similar to the Tel Qashish example, even in terms of the number of grooves (eight) in the headgear, and that the body conforms in every detail with the other figu- rines of this type from Megiddo. Similar representations were so common at Taanach that a complete figurine of a woman with high, rilled headgear was termed "Gewöhnlicher Astartetypus" (Sellin 1904:45, Fig. 47, 50, Fig. 51). In discussing this figurine, Pritchard (1943:12, No. 72) remarked that it could easily have been made in the same mold as Megiddo figurine M. 598, were it not for the anklet on each leg of the Taanach specimen. Lapp (1964:173:39, n. 64) mentioned 19 figurines from Sellin's excavations and 14 more that he himself found, and added more in his second report, one from "a good LB I context" (Ibid.:35, n. 3 1). He suggested a stylistic development of the "Astarte of Taanach" genre of figurines throughout the Late Bronze Age, from the 1 5th to the 12th century BCE; the two heads closest to the Tel Qashish example and a comparable torso are dated by their contexts to the first half of the 15th century BCE, "presumably before the destructive campaign of Thutmose III in 1468 B.C." (Ibid.:40, 42, Fig. 22:1-3).</page><page sequence="423">FEMALE FIGURINES FROM TEL QASHISH Significantly, Lapp mentioned that none was found in a cultic context (Ibid.:39). The figurines from Megiddo and Taanach differ only in minute details: the proportions of the headdress and the number of its grooves the number and quality of the incisions delineating the pubic triangle, and the details of the jewelry. The Megiddo figurines comprise a uniform stylistic group, while the Taanach group seems to have been more diverse. In his discussion of the Megiddo figurines, May (1935: Discus- sion of Pl. XXXI) concluded that "all could have come from the same mold". To reach this conclusion, he had to have assumed that the details in which the figurines vary were added after the figurines were removed from the mold. Even so, however, the heads M. 227 and M. 598 seem to have come from different molds. The head mold found at Megiddo (Schumacher 1908:103, Fig. 158:a; May 1935: PI. 31)raises the possibility that occasionally heads were produced sepa- rately to be used as charms. A head from Taanach has two holes on its top, obviously for suspension, and pierced ears, possibly for earrings (Lapp 1964:42, Fig. 22:2). In view of the above-mentioned parallels, we can assume that, when complete, the woman depicted in the Tel Qashish figurine was holding her breasts in her hands; her feet were straight, in line with the body; the pubic triangle was delin- eated by incisions and had a vertical groove in the center; and the torso had a vertical incision running from the breasts down to the navel or pubic triangle. She may have been wearing bracelets, anklets, and a necklace. There was probably very little detail on the back: it may have had the typical concave areas sunk between the arms and the body, and it is very likely that a heavy, braid-like (but not braided) element was depicted in relief from the head down along its center. The figurines from Megiddo and Taanach, together with the head from Tel Qashish, are also characterized by a signif- icant technical peculiarity that distinguishes them from typical plaque-figurines of the Late Bronze Age: they were all made in double molds (May: 193 5: Pl. XXXI; Pritchard 1943:43). Thus, in terms of production technique, they are not plaques but rather three-dimensional figurines, even if there are only a few sculptural details on their backs. The few extant complete examples show that the figurines of this genre narrowed at the base and that they could not stand in an upright position without support. In one case of a figurine from Megiddo, the legs are partially framed by the mold and the feet rest on a support (Loud 1948: PI. 242:10). The numerous examples from Taanach and Megiddo, as well as the recently found Tel Qashish fragment, indicate that such figurines were especially popular in the major Canaanite cities of the central and western Jezreel Valley. We assume that their proliferation in this particular region is not a temporary distortion of discovery and that these figurines indeed reflect the distribution of a distinct genre of style and technology popular in this area. Until a pétrographie study is conducted, their production site (or sites) cannot be deter- mined, but there can be little doubt that these figurines were locally made and, therefore, may be considered a character- istic regional product. For the sake of convenience, the figu- rines of nude women wearing high, rilled headgear and holding their breasts are referred to below as the Megiddo- Taanach type. Single finds from other sites indicate, however, that these figurines had a wider distribution. Tell Abu Hawam, on the seashore, produced a very similar, headless, specimen in an intrusive pit (Hamilton 1934:55, No. 322); another torso, as yet unpublished, was found in recent excavations at the site.1 Tel Kishion, west of En-Dor (T zori 1 977: 1 1 0, Fig. 27 :4), and Kheir- Allah near Jenin (Zertal 1992:248, 529), on the northern and southern fringes of the Jezreel Valley respec- tively, each produced one fragment; Tel Hefer, on the central coastal plain, produced another (Paley and Porath 1982:66; Porath, Dar and Applebaum 1985:167, Fig. 57:3).2 A torso with identical details was found at Shechem (Sellin 1926:231, Pl. 31:1) and another at Gezer (Macalister 1912: PI. CCXX:6; May 1935: Pl. XXXI). Similar figurines of unknown provenance in private collections should also be mentioned in this context (M. Tadmor 1 982b: Fig. on p. 9 and frontispiece, upper row, second from left). Again, only a pétrographie study will determine whether all these figurines originated in the Jezreel Valley or, as is more likely, were locally produced in several regions at various sites. The image of a nude woman wearing high, rilled headgear is also represented in plaque-figurines made in open one- piece molds. Such plaques are known mostly from southern sites, such as Gezer (Macalister 1912:413, Pis. CCXX:16-18, CCXXI:1; Dever, Lance and Wright 1970: PI. 25:B) and Tell Beit Mirsim, all from Stratum C (Albright 1938:69, 122-123, Pis. 26:3, 5; 27:2,4; 1939:111, 118, PI. A:3, 5); and some plaques of unknown provenance are in private collections (e.g., M. Tadmor 1982b: Frontis- piece, lower row, second from right). The vertically rilled headgear from Gezer was described by Macalister as a "cylindrical crown apparently of feathers" (1912 11:413), and as a "feather tiara" or "feather headdress" by Albright (1939:118). Albright referred to the Megiddo-Taanach type as a "fluted tiara" or "rilled calathus." He doubted whether "the fluted tiara was a skeuomorphic adaptation of the feather headdress, though a certain amount of contamination does seem to have occured later" (Ibid.: 11 8, n. 4), and remarked that "it is sometimes hard to distinguish the feather headdress, especially in the inferior pieces, from rilled calathus" (Ibid. : 1 1 8). Indeed, the identification of the high headdress of the type found at Tel Qashish with the "feather crown" of the Tell Beit Mirsim examples still poses some difficulties. If a realistic prototype is sought (although both types are roughly contem- porary), the "feather crown" is a most likely candidate. Stylistically, however, the two are not identical: the high, grooved headdress is rigidly delineated and confined within its border lines, while the "feather crown" has a very wide band at its base and the "feathers" are bent at the top. Moreover, on the two Tell Beit Mirsim plaques, the woman wearing the "feather crown" usually has long hair and is holding lily stems; on the figurines of the type found at Tel Qashish, she is holding her breasts. Therefore, the two types might have represented different female images. As noted above, the images in the Megiddo-Taanach group display considerable consistency, with the woman always holding her breasts, and the stylistic variants seem to be of little iconographie significance. In contrast, the plaques encompass a much wider stylistic spectrum, including 389</page><page sequence="424">CHAPTER 22 elements of iconographie significance: as shown by the Gezer and Tell Beit Mirsim examples, the heads may have "Hathor curls" or long tresses falling on both sides of the face, while the Tel Qashish head and those of the Megiddo- Taanach group of figurines have no hair at all. Finally, the woman may be holding her breasts or, as on two plaques from Tell Beit Mirsim, two long lily stems in her upraised hands. On Canaanite figurines of the Late Bronze Age, vertical grooves were commonly used for realistic depictions of various hairstyles and wigs (Macalister 1912: PI. CCXX:14) and can be found in pottery, gold and silver (Metzger 1993: Pis. 18:7, 37), bronze (Hachmann 1980:89, PI. 27:1), and glass representations (Tufnell 1958: PI. 27:2; Barag 1970:188, Figs. 25-26, 98-99; 1985: Figs 15-16; Grose 1989:58-59, 397). In fact, this style also continued in the Iron Age, when other stylistic details and iconographie attributes changed (May 1935: PI. XXIII:41 17; Yadin et al. 1960: Pl. CLXII:2, 4, 8; James 1966: Pis. 111:4, 115:1-3,6; Beck 1 990). These hairstyles and wigs, however, must not be confused with the high, rilled headgear under discussion. The former are usually low, naturally framing the contours of the head. In contrast, the high, rilled headgear is clearly a separate element, projecting from the top of the head. The high, rilled headgear is also represented in other media. On a Megiddo ivory, the woman (a priestess or queen) presenting a lotus blossom to the king also wears a high head- dress, albeit with differently arranged ribs (Loud 1939: PI. 4:2a-b; Pritchard 1954:111, No. 332; 288; Barnett 1985:4*). The earliest example of rilled headgear seems to be on a small silver figurine from the Middle Bronze Age seashore shrine at Nahariya, although a representation of a high coiffure cannot be excluded in this case (M. Dothan 1956:20-21, Pl. 5J; Negbi 1976:130, 178, PI. 38:1526). A parallel for such headgear may be found in the exquisite gold pendant from the Ulu Burun shipwreck, found near Ka§ in modern Turkey (but of unknown provenance). This is an excellent example of a crown worn by a nude goddess on top of a coiffure (also rilled) of long hair; she is holding gazelles in both hands, her feet turned to her right (Bass et al. 1 989:4, Fig. 3).3 In an additional example, on a gold pendant from Minet el-Beida, the goddess stands on a lion with her feet turned to her right, holding gazelles and snakes (Schaeffer 1932: Pl. IX: 1, second from right; Barrelet 1958: PI. II:e). In the posture of the goddesses and their wealth of attributes, both plaques resemble the gold plaque found in a temple at Lachish (M. Tadmor 1986). In light of the above, we can assume that rilled hairstyles and headgear enjoyed considerable popularity in Late Bronze Age Canaanite representations, appearing on objects of diverse shapes, sizes, and materials. In the subsequent early Iron Age, high, rilled headgear was a typical feature of Philistine warriors (Nelson 1930: Pis. 32, 43-44; T. Dothan 1982:271, 275, Fig. 11:2, Pis. 16-17), and is depicted, for example, on an anthropoid sarcophagus from Beth-Shean (Oren 1973:135-139, 250, Figs. 53:4, 80). Still later, at Tel Miqne-Ekron, a goddess sketchily incised on a silver pendant, wearing high, rilled headgear crossed by two horizontal lines and standing on a lion (compared to Ishtar from Zinjirli), provides an example 390 from a 7th-century BCE context (Gitin 1997:93, 102, Fig. 21, and the detailed discussion in Ornan 2001 :235-252; for Zinjirli, see von Luschan 1 943 : Pis. 46:a, d-e, 47 :e). High headgear, rilled at the top, is also depicted on an imported Babylonian cylinder-seal dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE found at Beersheba (Beck 1973; H. Tadmor and M. Tadmor 1995:353-354). The similarity between the Tel Qashish head and these examples, however, may be only superficial, as the latter come from different periods and different reli- gious and cultural milieux. The high, rilled headgear is depicted on some Mesopotamian plaques, but in a very different way. It is worn by elaborately dressed female images, mostly seated, with rosettes on either side of their crowns (e.g., Barrelet 1968:233-243, Pis. XXVIII:299, XXIX, XXX:318), orby a woman represented in a couple (Ibid.:295, PI. XLIX:519). Similar headgear is worn by men defined as dancers, associ- ated with cult and music (Opificius 1961:156-159 [espe- cially discussion on feather crown on p. 158], 232-235, 265, Pis. 12:450, 17:576; Barrelet 1968:409, PI. LXXXIII:829 (armed); Boehmer:1980-1983:205-206, Fig. 34:36-37), by a bearded dwarf from Nippur (Legrain 1930:29, PI. XLII), and by "twin gods" from Ur (Woolley and Mallowan 1976: PI. 75: 1 10-1 11). Indeed, no exact parallel was found among the Mesopotamian plaques for the Megiddo-Taanach figu- rines, as represented by the Tel Qashish head: even where the headgear is similar, other components of style and iconog- raphy are not paralleled.4 Similarly, I found no female repre- sentations in a similar posture and wearing the high, rilled headgear among the terracottas excavated at Syrian or Lebanese sites. We have seen that, locally, the high, rilled headgear was a prominent and constant element appearing both on figurines of the Megiddo-Taanach type and on plaques, while on the latter, other elements were apt to change. The identity of its wearers is a complex issue that is dependent on the icono- graphie definition and significance of the headdress, as well as on the posture of the image and on the presence or absence of other attributes. In the context of Canaanite iconography, the nude woman wearing such a headdress, holding flower stems or gazelles and snakes and standing on a lion or horse, was certainly a goddess, undoubtedly one of the major Canaanite goddesses. However, the posture and choice of attributes were meaningful and different postures and attrib- utes probably represented different images. Therefore, in the absence of such attributes and of accompanying inscriptions or literary evidence, any identification must remain tenta- tive, as we do not have the tools to identify such images. While it is likely that the image may have been a goddess, the possibility that these figurines, devoid of attributes, depicted lesser divinities, spirits from the realm of magic, or even mortals engaged in some cultic service to the goddess must also be considered. As the Megiddo-Taanach figurines were found in domestic contexts and in burials, they must have carried a distinct personal significance and cultic connota- tion pertinent both to daily life and after death. Fragment Nos. 2 and 3 (Fig. 155:3-4) It is suggested that, when complete, the female image of No. 2 (Fig. 155:3) was framed on both sides by the plaque</page><page sequence="425">FEMALE FIGURINES FROM TEL QASHISH and the bottom tip curved up to form a short support upon which the feet rested. This type of figurine and its stylistic connection to Egyptian "concubine" or fertility figurines has been discussed in detail elsewhere (M. Tadmor 1982a: 149-1 60). It has been suggested that plaques with curving-up bottom ends and often with a frame encircling the female image depicted a bed with its foot support, and that the plaque was designed to be placed horizontally, resting on its back (see also Lipiñski 1986:89; Weippert 1988:305; Hadley 1989:224-233). Analogies of contemporary Egyptian fertility figurines have led to the interpretation of these images as representa- tions of women lying on beds (M. Tadmor 1982a: 140-156; Pinch 1993, especially 207-209). Given that the attributes of Canaanite divinities never appear in this genre of figurines, these female images seem to have been depictions of mortals or protective spirits, not of the major Canaanite deities (on the roles and identities of terracotta and metal statuary see Moorey and Fleming 1984:77-81; for an interpretation that these are indeed images of deities see Keel and Uehlinger 1998:97-108). A very similar plaque from Tell Mumbaqat on the middle Euphrates, dated to the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, provides an illuminating parallel supporting our definition. The plaque is wide and the nude woman has her feet resting on the curving-up end. Incised on the back is the Sumerian sign for "woman" (Kühne 1980: Pl. VII). Had an image of a goddess been intended, the name of the goddess and/or the divine determinative would also have been incised there (see, however, Keel and Uehlinger 1998:108). The female images on plaque-figurines, represented by the Tel Qashish fragments Nos. 2-3, display a pronounced stylistic variety (Macalister 1912: PI. CCXX:7, 11, 15; May 1935: PI. XXX:878, 2884, 3444; Albright 1938: Pis. 26:4, 6-10; 27:1, 3, 5, 8-9; Tufnell 1958:90, 291-292, PI. 49:1-5; Tzori 1958:52-55, PI. 7; Yadin et al. 1960:156, Pl. CXCII:7-8; Yadin et al. 1961: Pis. CLVII:42, CCVII:36; CCCXIV:l-2; M. Dothan 1967:137, 163, Fig. 43:4, 6, Pis. XV: 3, XXVII:2; 1971:139, Fig. 64:1-7, Pl. LVII: 1-6; M. Tadmor 1982a: Pis. 6-7, 11-12, 144-149). As their facial features vary, the triangular contour of the face of Tel Qashish fragment No. 2 is not exceptional. -The coiffure is always realistically depicted, and there is considerable variety and freedom in these representations. Such symbolic elements as "Hathor curls" or rilled or feather headgear are non-existent. The position of the hands also varies: the woman may be holding her breasts or have her arms and palms stretched alongside the body. In Tel Qashish fragment No. 2 the arms encircle the breasts (which is unusual) rather than holding them in the palms, but this may be attributed to the sketchy manner of representation rather than to a differ- ence in meaning. The convex back is comparable to that of a figurine from Beth-Shean (Rahmani 1959:184-185, Pl. XXIV: 1-2; M. Tadmor 1982a: 157-1 59, Pis. 8-8a). The feet are always in line with the legs and the body. Not enough remains of fragment No. 3, also a plaque- figurine, to ascertain the original shape of the representation and the plaque, but certain elements might be suggested. Since there is no room for the hands alongside the hips, the arms must have been raised to the breasts. The legs, set apart by a deep groove, and the bulging knees can be compared to those of some figurines from Megiddo and Tell Beit Mirsim (May 1935: PL XXX:648, 722; Albright 1938:122-123, Pis. 26:6-7, 27:9; Guy 1938: PI. 155:6-7; Loud 1948: PI. 242:13). The few short, vertical incisions observed above the pubic triangle are significant, since these can serve as an additional diagnostic element of style. Such incisions appear on a plaque-figurine from Tel Zeror (Ohata 1967:28, PI. XLVII:l-2; for a better photograph see M. Tadmor 1 982a: 1 60, PI. 9). Unusual, quite bizarre, incisions appear on a group of figurines from Taanach (Lapp 1964:42, Fig. 22:8-10), but these are typologically different from Tel Qashish fragment No. 3. In view of these comparisons we may assume that the female image in this Tel Qashish fragment resembled the figurines from Tell Beit Mirsim and Tel Zeror in its stylistic details. In Mesopotamia and Elam, there was an established tradi- tion of plaque production already in the late third millennium BCE. This genre, which spread west, became especially common in the kingdoms of northern Syria, Canaan and Egypt during the second millennium and reached the Aegean in the first millennium. It has been widely discussed by archaeologists and art historians (e.g., Van-Buren 1930; Opificius 1961:41-161; Ziegler 1962:141-182, 204-220; Stadelmann 1967:88-123; Barrelet 1968:230-321; Moorey 1975; Winter 1983:93-460; Moorey and Fleming 1984:77-90; Böhm 1990:19-116; Wrede 1991; Spycket 1992:37 ff.; 1993:183-191; Pinch 1993:197-225; Postgate 1994). CONCLUSIONS Female plaques comprise the largest group of small sculp- tures in clay from the ancient Near East. Nude women were depicted in various materials and on various types of objects (jewelry, cylinder-seals, and scarabs), but pottery plaques were the most common medium. The meaning and signifi- cance of these images, often accompanied by a variety of iconographie symbols, must have been rooted in each culture. Over the ages and in each culture, these images were integrated into the specific beliefs, cults, and rituals of their environment (Kantor 1962:99-100). The Tel Qashish head fragment No. 1 was produced in a double mold and is therefore a three-dimensional figurine rather than a plaque. Moreover, the high, rilled headgear puts it in a separate stylistic category. We have seen that, to date, such figurines seem to be concentrated in the northern valleys of Israel, especially in the Megiddo-Taanach region, with a few examples from further south; several plaques with similar headdresses have been found at southern sites in Israel. Fragment Nos. 2 and 3 are plaques made in open, single molds. In terms of their technique, style and distribution, the three Tel Qashish fragments belong to two distinct variants of Canaanite female representations. As mentioned above, the Taanach figurines of women wearing high, rilled headgear were dated by Lapp to the LB I- II, but only a few figurines 391</page><page sequence="426">CHAPTER 22 from Taanach have thus far been published, all in prelimi- nary reports. Many of the figurines from Megiddo discussed above also come from disturbed or insecure loci and their dating is by no means certain. Moreover, because they were found in disturbed loci, the Tel Qashish fragments must also be dated solely on typological grounds, without extrinsic stratigraphie considerations. Therefore, it seems that a general dating of the Tel Qashish figurines within the Late Bronze Age, without further refinement, is the best that can securely be attempted at this stage of the inquiry.

Rosen Ben Gurion University of the Negev INTRODUCTION The past decade or so has seen a significant broadening in the types of evidence utilized in the reconstruction of ancient cultures in the Levant. The development of a general frame- work for the study of flint assemblages from the metal ages has been an important part of this phenomenon (Rosen 1997a). Apart from the elaboration of a descriptive techno- typology, hypotheses regarding chronologies, trade systems, craft specialization, cultural affinities, site organization and functions, subsistence economies, and technological change have been suggested on the basis of flint assemblages (e.g., Schick 1978; McConaughy 1979; Crowfoot Payne 1983; Rosen 1983a; 1983b; 1984; 1988; 1989;Futato 1990). Given the relatively recent status of much of this work and the correspondingly limited nature of much of the database, virtually every new assemblage brings surprises. In this sense, the frameworks are best seen as working hypotheses, since every new assemblage adds important modifications and addenda. The chipped stone assemblage from Tel Qashish is one of the few well-collected assemblages of its kind from northern Israel. It is also the largest assemblage from this area to date. Thus, both in terms of geography and sampling, the materials from Tel Qashish are of some significance. It should also be noted that the occupation history of the site spans several periods, some of which have been little studied in terms of their lithic industries. Thus, despite its small size, the sub- assemblage from the Middle Bronze Age strata at Tel Qashish is a major supplement to the meager corpus of mate- rials from other sites, providing a critical perspective on technological change from the Early to Middle Bronze Age. Finally, the presence of both Pre-Pottery Neolithic artifacts, apparently in situ, as well as Chalcolithic types (not in situ), are important "dots-on-the-map" for synthetic analyses of settlement patterns from these periods. METHODS The excavations at Tel Qashish were conducted using the standard locus/basket provenience units of historical archae- ology in Israel. Sieving of sediments was restricted to selected loci (especially in the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age strata); however, considerable efforts were made to collect all the flint artifacts discerned in the sediments, and this is reflected in the relatively high proportion of waste to retouched tools (ca. 9: 1 in general, and ca. 15:1 for Neolithic and Early Bronze Age loci). Furthermore, microliths (bladelets and bladelet tools) were recovered, which are to be associated with the Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and to a lesser extent the Early Bronze Age occupations of the site. As post- Chalcolithic industries seem to have relied only minimally on microlithic technology, the bias introduced by lack of sieving is unlikely to be significant for these periods. The importance of the collection of waste cannot be over- emphasized. It is only the analysis of this component of the assemblage that allows for the reconstruction of patterns of production and trade. Different tool types often leave diag- nostic chipping debris, the presence or absence of which can be used to infer on-site or off-site manufacture. Furthermore, since specialized tool types (sickles, tabular scrapers, axes, etc.) undergo several distinct stages of production, it is often possible to isolate these stages and identify different types of manufacturing stations. The analytic methods used in this study are the standard techno-typological methods utilized for prehistoric lithic assemblages, with emphasis on typology. The dominance of expedient flake technologies that I have termed ad hoc industries (Rosen 1989, 1997:34, 158-159) in the proto- and early historic periods, used on a range of local lower-quality raw materials, suggests that detailed technological analyses of waste assemblages would provide little information beyond what is more or less evident from simple examina- tion. This is especially so in light of limitations on time and financial resources. The specific analyses undertaken are discussed below. RAW MATERIALS The range of raw materials exploited in the manufacture of chipped stone tools at Tel Qashish is broad. For the most part, variability is reflected in the graininess of the material and in its color. Other aspects include the degree of homogeneity in color, number of impurities (such as internal faults and cortex), type of cortex, patination, and burning. It is difficult to classify the assemblage into discrete categories based on these criteria since, to a large extent, the raw materials seem to grade into each other. Furthermore, individual artifacts occasionally exhibit internal variability that crosscuts specific raw material categories. In general, the following categories of raw materials can be recognized: 1. Fine- to medium-grained flints in a range of browns, from dark brown to light beige. Colors are usually homoge- neous, and the materials show few impurities. Cortex varies from white to beige in color, and is variable in surface 395</page><page sequence="430">CHAPTER 23 morphology. This type of flint is probably Eocene in origin, and geological maps (e.g., Bartov 1985) show outcrops in the hills surrounding Tel Qashish. The material is used most commonly for the manufacture of tabular (fan-) scrapers (especially in its darker shades) and Canaanean sickles, which seem to show a wider range of coloration. A major Canaanean blade manufacturing center was apparently located nearby at Har Haruvim (Kibbutz Hazorea) (Meyerhof 1960; Shimelmitz et al. 2000). Some Large Geometric sickles and celt tools were also manufactured in this material, as were, occasionally, other less formal tool types. 2. A group of fine-grained flint artifacts, of grayish flint, sometimes show a pinkish-purple discoloration associated with heat treatment (e.g., Nadel 1989), seems especially prevalent in the Neolithic assemblage. Burins and arrow- heads are typical examples. Some of the microlithic artifacts, either Neolithic or Chalcolithic, were also manufactured in this material. 3. Relatively coarse-grained, white and gray limestone was also used. However, utilization was more or less restricted to the manufacture of scrapers, denticulates, and notches {ad hoc tools) (Fig. 161:4). No sickle segments of limestone were recovered. Obviously, the lower quality of the raw material in terms of knapping, sharpness, and holding a sharp edge precluded the manufacture of limestone sickle blades (cf. I. Gilead 1989). 4. The final group is a catch-all category of medium- to coarse-grained flint, usually gray and white in color. Color- ation is not homogeneous, and pieces are often banded or mottled. Impurities are not uncommon. The full range of tool types was manufactured of this type of flint (with the excep- tion of tabular scrapers), although the ad hoc flake tools dominate. The celt tools and sickles were manufactured on the finer side of the spectrum of the group. In addition to these groups, burnt pieces showing potlidding, heat fractures, and black or dark gray discolor- ation are not unknown. Other pieces show double patina, suggesting the reuse of earlier Paleolithic artifacts. TYPOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY Lithic waste and tool frequencies by general period are presented in Tables 26 and 27. Many artifacts were recovered from unattributable mixed loci. For the most part, these are not included in the descriptions, since in most cases, such artifacts are non-diagnostic. The main exception is the inclu- sion of all Canaanean blades within a single statistical sample for the description of the technology. Tool frequen- cies are according to stratigraphy. Stratigraphie distinctions can also be made between "clean" fill loci and floor loci; however, restricting the sample to floor loci would render it too small for study. Furthermore, it is clear that the difference in the degree of intrusions between floor and "clean" fill loci is only minimal. PRE-POTTERY NEOLITHIC Technology The PPN waste assemblage is dominated by debris, espe- cially chips. The small size of the debitage assemblage (flakes, etc.) precludes definitive characterization, but the dominance of flakes is clear. The relatively high proportion of bladelets is of some interest, although the presence of a probable Canaanean sickle, attributable to the Early Bronze Age, suggests the possibility of intrusions. Flakes are small Table 26: Lithic waste frequencies by period.

Core trimming elements consist of two typical naviform blade core core-tablets and one miscel- laneous piece of core waste. Typology Arrowheads: One fragmentary possible arrowhead (Fig. 156:10) shows pressure flaking and discoloration, probably a result of heat treatment. It should be noted that another arrowhead (Fig. 156:8), recovered from a mixed context, can be classified as a Jericho point, typical of the Levantine PPNB (Gopher 1994:36). A third arrowhead (Fig. 156:5) can be classified as an el-Khiam point (e.g., Gopher 1994:32-34), and attributed to the PPNA. A PPNB strangled blade (Fig. 156:6) (e.g., Bar- Yosef and Alon 1988), perhaps the base of an arrowhead, was also re'covered from an Early Bronze Age context. Burins: One double dihedral burin on a truncation was found (Fig. 156:2). Several other burin (Fig. 156:1, 3-4), intrusive in Early Bronze Age contexts, may also be associ- ated with the PPNA or PPNB. Drills: Two microlithic drills (Fig. 156:12) were recov- ered. Similar drills were found in the Sultanian levels at Jericho (Crowfoot Payne 1983), although these may also be Chalcolithic or Pottery Neolithic, perhaps indicating a mixture in some baskets designated PPN. Retouched blades: One piece shows nibbling retouch. Retouched bladelets: One is backed (Fig. 156:11) and one double truncated. Their association with the PPNB is suspect. Sickles: Three sickles are fragments of plain blades, typical of the PPNB. The fourth appears to be a Canaanean blade, and may be either intrusive or fortuitously shaped. Hammerstones: One golfball-sized pecked wadi cobble was recovered. In addition to the above, the chisel (Fig. 157:3) recovered from an Early Bronze Age context is also probably PPNB. EARLY BRONZE AGE Technology Debris constitutes proportionally somewhat less of the Early Bronze Age waste assemblage than in the PPN. The assem- blage is dominated by flakes, although blades comprise a large component, which, in turn, is dominated by Canaanean prismatic blade technology. Bladelets comprise only a small percentage of the assemblage, and given the presence of Chalcolithic intrusions in the tool assemblage (e.g., axes), their association is somewhat suspect. The sickle flakes are compatible with the manufacture of Large Geometric sickle blades: their presence in low numbers is indicative of the general range of variation in the size and shape of flakes. No Large Geometric sickles were found in Early Bronze Age loci, and they are not known from this period. Flakes are generally small, with numerous production faults, hinge fractures, and broken edges. There is little stan- dardization evident in their manufacture. As mentioned above, the blade assemblage is dominated by Canaanean technology (Figs. 158:1-4, 6; 159:2). Attrib- utes of the Canaanean blades are summarized and compared to those of the plain blades in Table 28. Only two complete Canaanean blades (Fig. 158:1) were found, measuring 12.9 and 8.2 cm in length (a third example [Fig. 158:2], only slightly broken, was 11.9 cm long). Although 31 complete plain blades were recovered, the longest measured only 7.2 cm. The similarity in length average should be attributed 397</page><page sequence="432">Fig. 156.

Width distributions of the two types are presented in Graph 1 , and the average widths of the two types are statistically significantly different (t=3.99, df=174, pO.OOl). Cores are dominated by the 17 amorphous flake cores (Fig. 157:5). These average 4.77±0.79 cm in maximal dimension. The number of striking platforms varies: 10 showed one platform, six showed two platforms, and one showed three platforms. Of the remainder of the cores from Early Bronze Age loci, five are bladelet cores, which may be intrusive, and one is a plain blade core. As is typical of most large Early Bronze Age sites, no Canaanean blade cores were found. The four flake cores recovered from later loci are not distinguishable from those described above. Core trimming elements (CTE) consist of two plunging blades, four burin spalls (probably PPNB intrusions), two core tablets of unclear affinity, three ridge blades, one cortical flake (perhaps to be associated with tabular scraper manufacture or repair), and four miscellaneous pieces of core waste. The ridge blades are probably by-products of Graph 1. Canaanean and plain blade width frequencies. Canaanean blade manufacture, and have been found at several sites (e.g., 'En Shadud [Rosen 1985]). An additional partial Canaanean ridge blade was found in an Iron Age context (Fig. 158:3). Typology Arrowheads: Two transverse arrowheads, one triangular and one trapezoidal in shape (Fig. 159:3), were recovered. They measure 3.1x1.2x0.5 and 1.0x0.6x0.2 cm respec- tively. Roughly similar types have been documented at EB I sites in northern Sinai (E. Oren and I. Gilead, personal communication) and from the Sinai Nawamis cultures (Bar- Yosef et al. 1977; 1986). They are rare to absent at northern Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age sites, although known from the Egyptian Early Dynastic period (Clark, Phillips, and Staley 1974). Awls: Awls, or borers (Figs. 157:1; 159:4), are pointed pieces, usually manufactured by double notching, leaving a point between the notches. Five pieces were manufactured on flakes and one on a chunk. One is a pointed retouched blade. Burins: Of the three examples (Fig. 156: 1, 3-4), one is a double dihedral burin (Fig. 156:2), one sur face plan, on what appears to be heat-treated purple flint (Fig. 1 56: 1 ) (e.g., Nadel 1989). The third is a burin on a truncation, on a blade (Fig. 156:4). All are probably PPNA or PPNB intrusions. Celt tools: Two chisels (Fig. 157:3) and one ax/adze (Fig. 160:6) were recovered. The ax is almost undoubtedly Chalcolithic, but the chisels may be PPNB (e.g., Crowfoot Payne 1983:675-676, Fig. 301; see also Neuville 1934; Lee 1973; Levy and Rosen 1987). Varia: One piece of quartz crystal can be classified as a manuport. One patinated Levallois blade was either intrusive or deliberately collected in ancient times. Denticulates: Four are steep denticulates on thick flakes. Another is a similar piece on a chunk, and two more are "heavy duty" denticulates. The remaining five are on flat flakes (Fig. 160:4; cf. also Fig. 160:1). Drills: Three are microlithic drills on bladelets (Fig. 157:2) (one of purple flint), and one is a fragment of a somewhat larger piece. Such pieces are not known from northern Early Bronze Age contexts, although some Chalcolithic sites have yielded large quantities (e.g., Macdonald 1932; Roshwalb 1981; Burian and Friedman 1987), and they have also been discovered in Negev Early Bronze Age sites (Rosen 1997b). They are also known from the Enéolithique at Byblos (Cauvin 1968), but whether they should be dated to the Early Bronze Age or Chalcolithic there is unclear. Somewhat similar pieces are also known from the PPNB (e.g., Crowfoot Payne 1983: Fig. 279). 401 40 ». io. XL..H/ L__Kļ . I If l H &amp;• 0.5-14) i.O-15 15-2,0 2MJ IMA 3M5 Blade width cm ggctii.

Seven are steep side- and endscrapers, probably similar in function to the steep denticulates (Fig. 157:4). Indeed, one shows denticulate retouch (Fig. 161 :3) (the difference being one of degree). One of these is on a chunk. Of the three simple scrapers on flakes, one shows denticulate retouch. Two are endscrapers on blades, one of which is massive (Fig. 160:3).

The remainder are on thin flakes; three show double notches (e.g., Fig. 160:2). Retouched blades: The retouched blades can be divided into plain blades and Canaanean blades (Rosen 1983a). Almost all are broken. Among the plain blade tools, five show simple retouched edges, four others nibbled edges, and one what appears to be utilization damage. One blade is nosed, one pointed, and one notched. The final piece is a strangled blade, typical of the PPNB (e.g., Cauvin 1968; Crowfoot Payne 1 983). Of the (non-sickle) Canaanean blade tools, 11 show nibbling or other miscellaneous retouch (Fig. 158:2, 6). One is notched and two are truncated. It is likely that these pieces are by-products of sickle manufacture or use. Retouched bladelets: Two are broken backed bladelets, perhaps epipaleolithic intrusions. One microendscraper (Fig. 156:9) is Chalcolithic (I. Gilead 1984) or perhaps Early Bronze I (e.g., Roshwalb 1981; Rosen 1988). The final piece is notched. Sickles: Eight show backing and may be Chalcolithic intrusions (cf. Fig. 162:7-8). Four are typologically uniden- tifiable fragments, but show sickle gloss along their working edges. Seventeen are plain blade sickles, and the remaining 68 (70%) are technologically Canaanean (Figs. 158:5; 159:1). These are of greatest interest and importance. The following attributes were recorded for each (measurable) Canaanean sickle segment: length, width, thickness, presence/absence of bulb with or .without modification, number of truncations, number of glossy edges (sickle gloss), location and degree of retouch, and complete/broken (cf. Hours 1 979). No significant differences were discernible either in dimensions and attribute frequencies among the different sub-periods of the Early Bronze Age (EB I, EB II/III, or EB III), or among segments found in Early Bronze Age loci and those recovered as intrusions in later strata and in mixed loci. Claims that the average width of these pieces increases over time (Hanbury-Tenison 1986:148) do not hold here. The absence of differences between artifacts from Early Bronze Age and later loci supports the contention that those from later loci are indeed intrusive. Of the 62 measurable Canaanean sickle segments deriving from Early Bronze Age loci (and restricting the analysis to these for reasons of scientific rigor), three retain the bulb of percussion, 10 show single truncations, and three show double truncations. Sickle gloss is present on all but three, and these show such heavy retouch that it is likely that the gloss was removed in the course of sharpening. Gloss is present on both edges of 30 pieces (48%), indicating a fairly high degree of reuse. The sickles generally show heavy retouch sharpening. Some 38 (61%) show retouch on both edges. Of the total of 100 retouched edges (62+38), 37 are ventrally retouched. Relating only to retouched edges, if retouch is scaled between 1 (light nibbling) and 4 (heavy serration), then the average retouch is 2.2. Length, width, and thickness average 3.9±1.26, 1.74±.34, and 0.47±.12 cm respectively. The differences between the sickles and the unretouched blades, especially in width, should be noted (Table 28). The frequency distribution of the retouched segments is presented in Graph 2. Only five of the pieces could be considered complete in length. Of the 17 plain sickle blades, only four (23.5%) show double gloss, and only five (29%) show retouch on both edges. On the retouched edges, average retouch is 1 .9, far lower than for the Canaanean sickle segments. Three pieces show partial backing and four show ventral work edge retouch. Only one piece is complete. Average length, width, and thickness are 3.8±0.72, 1.7±0.27, and 0.6±0.28 cm, respectively, bearing in mind, of course, that average length relates to broken pieces and has little significance. Sickle blanks: Two Large Geometric sickle blanks were recovered. The total absence of Large Geometric sickles in the Early Bronze Age (at other sites as well as at Tel Qashish: cf. Rosen 1983a) suggests that these may be fortuitously shaped scrapers or retouched flakes. Tabular scrapers: The tabular scraper assemblage from Tel Qashish consists of 13 pieces, seven of which derive from Early Bronze Age contexts, two from intrusive Middle Bronze Age contexts, and four from mixed fills. Although it is possible that some of these pieces date from the Chalcolithic, it is not possible to determine which, and given the presence of apparently Chalcolithic intrusions in Early Bronze Age loci, there is no reason to assume that these are Fig. 161.

Six are too fragmentary to be described by shape (Fig. 161:5), four can be classified as fan-scrapers, one is cordiform, one elongate, and one transverse. Only two pieces retain the bulb of percussion, and none show bulbar thinning. Retouch varies from fine nibbling and sharpening through coarse denticulation. Three pieces show incisions (Fig. 159:5-7) and seven cortical grinding. Four pieces show faceted striking platforms. The four relatively complete pieces measure 8.2, 1 1 .4, 10.0, and 5. 1 cm in length. Average width and thickness of the seven measurable pieces are 6.4±1.8 and 1.2±0.5 cm, respectively. POST-EARLY BRONZE AGE Technology The Middle Bronze, Late Bronze, and Iron Age waste assem- blages are considerably smaller than that of the Early Bronze Age. For this reason, and because the tool assemblages from these later periods are technologically and typologically similar, the description of the basic technologies is combined. The assemblages are dominated by flake technologies. The primary type is similar to that of the Early Bronze Age, consisting of small flakes with numerous production errors (hinge fractures, etc.) and little standardization in manufac- ture. A second type consists of "sickle flakes," that is, flakes appropriate for the manufacture of sickles (these are to be distinguished from sickle blanks, i.e., flakes that have been worked into sickle segments but not yet utilized). Although relatively rare in the Middle Bronze and Iron Age contexts excavated at Tel Qashish, these pieces comprise almost one- third of the Late Bronze Age waste assemblage. Since such pieces are the result of specialized manufacture, the by- products of which seem to be restricted to special production loci (e.g., the Gezer Iron Age flint caches [Rosen 1986]), the low number of pieces found in Middle Bronze and Iron Age contexts at Tel Qashish probably reflects the non-discovery of similar specialized loci. Although no specific locus from Late Bronze Age Tel Qashish can be defined as a sickle production area, the sickle flakes may reflect the dispersal of such a locus. Although blade tools continue to be of some importance in the waste assemblages of the post-Early Bronze Ages, Canaanean technology declines both in its representation in the blade assemblage and in the waste assemblage as a whole. From the Early Bronze Age to the MB II, Canaanean technology declines from 59% to 44% of the blade assem- blage, and from 1 7% to 8.5% of the waste assemblage. There is a more dramatic decrease in absolute numbers, but this is difficult to evaluate. Given the evidence from other sites (Albright 1936/7; D. Gilead 1973; Crowfoot Payne 1983; Rosen 1983a; 1989), it is likely that the post-Early Bronze Age presence of Canaanean technology reflects intrusions from earlier levels. Another possibility is the intentional collection and reuse of these items in later periods. Bladelets are rare in these periods, and it is likely that all those recovered are intrusive. The only cores recovered derive from Middle Bronze Age 407 pttcem 70. 1 M ■■ su- -H - 40- H. 3Ù- -■ - 20 ia o - i - - mij - ■■■ - ■■L- 0.5-14» 10-1,5 15-2.0 2.0-25 2.534» 3.035 utifll-h in rm n = R9</page><page sequence="442">CHAPTER 23 contexts. These flake cores are technologically identical to those from the Early Bronze Age, and whether they are indeed associated with the Middle Bronze Age or are Early Bronze Age intrusions is not ascertainable. The bladelet cores (the "other core" category) are clearly intrusive, either Chalcolithic or Epipaleolithic in origin. Core trimming elements include one ridge blade, one core tablet, and two miscellaneous pieces. The ridge blade and core tablet are typical of the PPNB. Middle Bronze Age Typology This sub-assemblage includes tools attributed stratigraphically to periods designated as Middle Bronze Age, MB II, MB IIA, IIB, and HC, and Middle-Late Bronze Ages. Celt tools: One ax, with Chalcolithic affinities, was recovered. Drills: Two microlithic drills, one broken, were recov- ered. These are probably Chalcolithic intrusions. Denticulates: Two flat denticulated flakes were recov- ered. Scrapers: Six flat endscrapers on flakes were recovered. One shows denticulated retouch. One steep scraper on a thick flake was also found. The scrapers show no standardization in manufacture. Varia: One patinated Levallois flake and one miscella- neous trimmed piece were recovered. The Levallois flake is either intrusive or perhaps was intentionally collected. Notches: Four notches, three on flat flakes and one on a chunk, were found. One of the flake notches shows orange patina, and is probably a Middle Paleolithic intrusion, to be associated with the above-mentioned Levallois flake. Retouched blades: Of the 12 retouched blades, five are technologically Canaanean. All four of the Canaanean blade tools recovered are broken; three show nibbled dorsal retouch and one ventral retouch. It is likely that all are Early Bronze Age intrusions. Three of the seven plain retouched blades are also broken. Of the seven plain blades, three are nibbled, one is denticulated, one truncated, one shows utili- zation damage, and one has a double basal notch. Retouched bladelets: One bladelet shows nibbling. Sickles: Two are backed blades, 14 are technologically Canaanean, five are plain blade sickles, and eight are Large Geometries. This period marks the introduction of the Large Geometric type into the region. The large number of Canaanean sickles is probably indicative of a high degree of disturbance and intrusion in these loci. This is also reflected in the presence of the celt tool, the microlithic drills, and the tabular scrapers, as well as ceramics. Technological descrip- tions of the Large Geometric sickles are presented in Table 29. Tabular scrapers: Two tabular scrapers were recovered, one only a fragment. This piece shows a ground cortex. The other piece is a complete fan-scraper with an incised cortex and a faceted striking platform. It is undoubtedly an intrusion from Early Bronze Age strata. Late Bronze Age Typology Awls: One awl/borer on a flake was recovered. Scrapers: The single scraper recovered is a crude endscraper on a flat flake. Retouched blades: Of the four retouched blades, one is a retouched Canaanean blade, one is backed, one shows a single truncation, and one shows utilization/edge damage. Retouched flakes: Three show nibbling retouch and one is truncated. Table 29: Large geometric sickle attributes and measurements by period.

Technological descriptions of the Large Geometries are presented in Table 29. Sickle blanks: Eight unfinished/unused sickles were recovered (Fig. 1 62:5-6). These are summarized in Table 29. Iron Age Typology Scrapers: Two small "thumbnail" scrapers (Fig. 156:7), one scraper on a flake (Fig. 161:2), and one steep scraper/chopper (Fig. 161:6) were recovered. Retouched blades: Two Canaanean blades were found. One, with a cortex, shows nibbling, as does another plain blade. One blade is backed and the final piece is notched and shows a natural back. Denticulates: One denticulate on a flake was recovered (Fig. 161:1). Retouched bladelets: The single piece shows utilization damage or light retouch (Fig. 160:5). Miscellaneous trimmed pieces: One chip shows minor retouch or utilization damage. Sickles: This group dominates the assemblage. It consists of 10 Large Geometric sickles (Fig. 162:1), three backed blade sickles (Fig. 162:7), two plain blade sickles, and three Canaanean sickles. Technological data on the Large Geometric sickles are presented in Table 29. Sickle blanks: Three Large Geometric sickle segments, showing fresh edges without gloss or other signs of use, were recovered. Attributes are summarized in Table 29. Mixed These are loci and baskets of problematic dating that never- theless yielded a considerable number of artifacts. A detailed discussion of these materials can offer few significant conclusions, but their general constellation, both typologically and technologically, resembles that of the Early Bronze Age. This is reflected in particular, for example, in the sickle category, containing 30 Canaanean sickles, three backed blade sickles, 18 Large Geometries, 1 1 plain blade sickles, and three fragments. This again serves to emphasize the all-encompassing Early Bronze Age presence at the site. DISCUSSION The PPN and (intrusive) Chalcolithic materials are difficult to assess due to the inherent limitations in the quantity of the material. PPN exposure was essentially limited to one locus (L. 575, p. 10), and no in situ Chalcolithic materials were found. There are hints of both PPNAandPPNB occupations, but their nature is not ascertainable. Beyond suggesting their existence, little information can be added. The primary occupation of the site occurred during the Early Bronze Age, and this is reflected in the fact that some 65% of the lithic assemblage can be attributed directly to Early Bronze Age loci, and perhaps up to 25-50% of the lithic artifacts from later strata are probably intrusions from this period. The assemblage is typical of its period. Thus, there is good evidence of non-specialized on-site manufacture of most of the less sophisticated tools (basically, the simple flake tools, including notches, denticulates, scrapers, awls, miscella- neous trimmed pieces, etc.), which constitute the bulk of the assemblage. The sickle blades, however, especially Canaanean sickle blades, and tabular scrapers are more than likely to have been manufactured off-site. It is notable that the raw materials from which these types were manufactured are not especially distant, indicating that the off-site manu- facture, at least in the case of the sickles, was a function of production specialization and not distance of raw material sources. The evidence from Tel Qashish fits well with that presented in other studies of Canaanean sickle blade manu- facture (Rosen 1983a). It is likely that these pieces were imported as whole blades and snapped and hafted on-site, according to the specific needs of the user. The fairly inten- sive retouch and the extensive use of the second edge, indi- cating reversal of the blade in the haft, is indicative of the relative value of these pieces. In these features, they contrast with the plain blade sickles, which may be interpreted as non-specialized adjuncts to the general sickle assemblage. Tabular scrapers, on the other hand, do not conform as well with earlier models (Rosen 1 983b; also see Helms 1987 for a critique). First, they constitute a somewhat larger proportion of the assemblage than predicated by the simple fall-off curve (although there are still far fewer proportion- ally than the number found at Negev sites). Second, in one case, there is a very close similarity between the raw material of some of the tabular scrapers and a cortical Canaanaean blade. The similarity in cortex seems especially telling and suggests the possibility that, as at Lahav (Futato 1990), some tabular scrapers may have been by-products of Canaanean blade core preparation. This, of course, is not the case for all of them. The set of functions and activities represented by the Early Bronze Age lithic assemblage covers a wide range. Clearly, agriculture plays a central role. The high proportion of sickles (40%) seems to be typical of assemblages from northern Israel, and contrasts with those from farther south (cf. 7% at Arad [T. Schick, personal communication]; Rosen 1983b: Table 1). The ad hoc tools probably reflect various domestic functions (McConaughy 1979). Tabular scrapers may be associated with cult (McConaughy 1979; Rosen 1 983b; 1 989; Greenhut 1 989), possibly on a domestic level. The primary problem regarding the post-Early Bronze Age assemblages lies in determining which artifacts are actually associated with the cultural horizon from which they derive and which are intrusive. Pottery evidence indicates high degrees of intrusion. The presence of tools such as tabular scrapers, an ax, a Levallois flake, and retouched bladelets, not to mention many Canaanean blades, in loci architecturally attributable to the post-Early Bronze Age tends to confirm this assessment. Architecturally mixed loci show even greater levels of intrusion. Nevertheless, several points can be made. The MB II marks the introduction of a new sickle type, the Large Geometric sickle. It also seems to mark an acceleration in the technological, typological, and quantitative decrease in the use of stone tools. In this respect, several important trends can be noted in the waste industries at Tel Qashish. The most obvious is the 409</page><page sequence="444">CHAPTER 23 Graph 3. Lithic artifacts per basket (excluding chips). general decline in the quantity of lithic artifacts recovered in the later strata. Graph 3 shows this decline, calibrated by number of baskets per period (in order to adjust for differen- tial sieving, chips were disregarded).2 This is accompanied by a complementary decline in the number of types repre- sented, which together reflect the increasing restriction in the use of flint tools. In conjunction, Graph 4 shows the decreasing percentage of waste in the general lithic assemblage. Given that most tools by these periods are the product of specialized manu- facture, the decrease in waste undoubtedly reflects a general pattern of declining on-site manufacture of stone tools. This is further supported by the decrease in the number of cores found in the later periods (Table 26). The use of flint as a common raw material is well attested even in the Iron Age, but the slow process of its replacement by metals is also well represented here. Afterword (February 2002) The pace of research on lithic industries of the post-Stone Age has considerably outstripped that of the publication of the monographs presenting the results of large-scale tel exca- vations. Briefly stated, the decade-plus that has passed since this report was written has seen numerous new studies on lithic assemblages from the Bronze and Iron Ages, including major geographical expansions, significant methodological advances, and many important discoveries. While much of Graph 4. Lithic waste percentages over time (excluding chips). this information was summarized in my volume on Lithics After the Stone Age (Rosen 1997a), even this synthesis is no longer up to date. A few highlights should be noted. Geographically, the last decade has seen the publication of important work from beyond Israel's borders, especially from Jordan (e.g., Betts 1991; 1992; Fujii 1998; 1999; Quintero, Wilke, and Rollefson in press). Methodologically, both microwear analyses (e.g., Anderson and Inizan 1994) and operation sequence studies (e.g., Coqueugniot 1991; Shimelmitz, Barkai, and Gopher 2000) have added new perspectives to the study of function and technology. The discovery of a major Canaanean blade workshop at Titriç Höyük (Hartenberger, Rosen, and Matney 2000) and a production locus at Hassek Hiiyiik, in eastern Turkey (Otte, Pelegrin, and Collin 1990; Pelegrin and Otte 1991) have provided new insights into the organization of Canaanean sickle production. Within Israel, work at various sites (e.g., Bankirer 1999; Marder, Braun, and Milevski 1995) has added considerably to the basic sample and broader picture of these industries. Updating this report would have required extensive and time-consuming revisions at the expense of current research. Even though the Qashish materials reported on here reflect the state of research more than a decade ago, they may be understood in a larger context and still constitute a signifi- cant addition to the basic data and our essential under- standing of the lithic industries of the early historic periods.

I am grateful to Amnon Ben-Tor for the opportunity to study the assemblage from Tel Qashish, and to Ruhama Bonfil for all her help in sorting out the material and explaining the site to me. I am also grateful to Isaac Gilead for various discussions and for the idea of cali- brating raw numbers of artifacts by number of baskets exca- vated. Edna Sachar did her usual expert job in editing the manuscript. 2 All the Neolithic and EB I baskets were sieved, as were a selection of baskets from the Early Bronze Age in general; none of the baskets from the later periods were sieved. Since microlithic tools play virtually no role in the lithic assem- blages of the later periods, the effect of sieving on relative tool type frequencies is minimal; however, the effect on waste assemblages can be significant, and is reflected almost entirely in the chip category (waste &lt; 2 cm long). Eliminating this category thus allows for a quantitative comparison of waste assemblages from different periods. 412</page><page sequence="447">CHAPTER 24 THE HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS FROM TEL QASHISH Pamela Sabari and Patricia Smith Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Hadassah Medical and Dental School, Hebrew University of Jerusalem During the excavations at Tel Qashish in 1978-1987, the skeletal remains of five individuals were recovered from under the floors of dwellings. The fragmentary, scattered remains of one individual were dated to the EB I. The other four were dated to the MB IIB. Of these, two, an adult and a child, had been buried in pithoi. The other two were adults represented by some cranial fragments. The bones were cleaned and examined under direct light. Age and sex deter- minations were based on Bass (1987). EARLY BRONZE AGE One skeleton (Homo 1) was attributed to the EB I (L. 616). It was found under the floor of a house (L. 566B) and belonged to an adult male, ca. 20 years old. The skeleton, which was incomplete, included cranial fragments, a mandible missing both rami, and the shaft of the left humerus. One of the parietal fragments showed parietal porosity on its external surface, indicative of vitamin and or iron deficiency (Nathan and Haas 1966). All teeth show hypoplastic defects in the form of parallel bands. These result from physiological stress during tooth development, either from malnutrition and/or illness accompanied by a high fever (El-Najjar, DeSanti, and Ozbek 1978). Their location indicates the age and duration of such stress. This individual has defects on the mid third of the crown of the canines and premolars and on the cervical third of all the molars. This indicates that he was malnourished and/or frequently ill from about the age of 2.5 to 3 years. In addition to the dental hypoplasia, there are calculus deposits on the anterior mandibular teeth (the maxillary teeth are absent). An accumulation of calculus in such a young individual is unusual and indicative of a period of ill-health before death when the person was not able to chew and swallow normally. This would indicate that the young man not only suffered during his childhood, but probably also suffered from a lengthy illness just prior to his death. MIDDLE BRONZE AGE Two of the burials dated to the MB IIB (Homos 3-4) were in pithoi. Homo 3 (Basket 1635, L. 75) was identified as a 40-year-old female on the basis of the gracile mandible and long bones. The poorly preserved bones include some cranial fragments, part of the mandible, and some upper torso and upper limb bones. There were two carious lesions on the teeth, one on the second molar and one on the third molar. There was also an abscess with resorption of the alveolar bone in the area of the premolars and first molar. The second pithos (Basket 2002, L. 304) was complete, measuring 90 cm in height, and contained the incomplete and fragmented remains of a two- to two-and-a-half-year-old child (Homo 4). Parietal hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia were present, suggesting that the child suffered from a defi- ciency of vitamins and/or iron (Nathan and Haas 1966). Homo 5 (from L. 95+3 19) was represented by only a few post-cranial fragments. Their circumference and thickness indicated that they belonged to an adult. There were no signs of pathology. A few cranial bones of a second adult (Homo 2) were found in L. 621. On one of them there was a round depression, 15 mm in diameter, either the result of a scalp infection or a blow that had caused an incomplete fracture of the bone. In conclusion, although the skeletal material from Tel Qashish is a very small, poorly preserved sample, it provides additional evidence of poor health status in the southern Levant during the Early Bronze and Middle Bronze Ages, as previously reported by Smith (1989).

Bar- Yosef Mayer Peabody Museum, Cambridge, MA, USA INTRODUCTION Molluscs, originating mainly in marine and fresh waters, have been used by humans for some 50,000 years for both food (Volman 1978) and ornaments (Bar- Yosef 1989b). Shells are found at almost every archaeological site, gener- ally scattered, like coins in the historic periods, but some- times in clearer contexts, such as burials, plastered skulls, storage installations, etc. They were used mainly as orna- ments, such as necklaces, bracelets, etc., or for decorating clothes and objects, and were probably collected by the inhabitants of the sites directly from the source (the sea or river), by exchange with other groups, or through gift giving. Shell middens (accumulations of the shell debris of molluscs used as food), however, are very rare in the Levant. Landsnails also occur at almost every site, but these are usually a result of natural deposition (e.g., Hester 1975). The molluscan fauna from Tel Qashish, situated on the right bank of the Kishon River in the Jezreel Valley, consists of thousands of shells and shell fragments. In this report, each of the three main groups - marine shells, freshwater shells, and landsnails - is dealt with separately, as each group contributes in a different way to our understanding of the Early Bronze Age at Tel Qashish. The various groups of shells represent changing ecological, social, and economic roles in the Early Bronze Age both at this site in particular and in society in general. METHODS The shells were classified first into taxa, using the compara- tive mollusc collection at the Hebrew University's Zoolog- ical Museum. They were then identified as types (e.g., bead, broken shell, etc.) according to a type-list (Bar-Yosef 1989a:62-67). The data, consisting of shell taxon and type and the information from the excavation, namely, locus and basket numbers, were entered into database programs (Mac Works and Excel), enabling the sorting of the material. The assignment of each basket to stratum and period was provided by the excavators (based mainly on the classifica- tion of the pottery from the various baskets). The landsnails are reported below by number of complete or almost complete shells. The cases in which there were numerous (at least dozens of) fragments are specified. The freshwater gastropods ( Melanoides sp. and Melanopsis sp.) were also counted individually. However, the freshwater clams, which constitute the bulk of the shell assemblage, were counted by calculating an MNI (Minimum Number of Individuals). This calculation was based on counting complete valves, broken valves (when more than half of the valve was present), and fragments (less than half of a valve), all of which included the umbo of the valve. This number was divided by two, since each clam consists of two valves.2 Marine shells were also counted individually, whether gastropods or bivalves, since each valve was used separately. MALACOLOGICAL INFORMATION Following is a brief description of the species discussed below, presented in taxonomie order: Patella caerulea (Photo 156:f): A Mediterranean limpet that adheres to rocks in the littoral zone. An edible species (Tornaritis 1987). Cypraea lurida (Photo 156:d): A Mediterranean cowrie that lives in deep water (over 10 m), but empty shells are commonly found on the shore (Mienis 1984:106). Tonna galea (Photo 156:b): A common Mediterranean species, with a thin shell (Tornaritis 1987:75). Tonna sp.: One fragment of Tonna sp. is probably not Tonna galea and is assumed to originate in the Red Sea. The exact species could not be determined. Phalium granulatum (Photo 156:c): A common Mediter- ranean species, often found at archaeological sites, its thick outer lip was used as an ornament (Reese 1989:33-35). Murex brandaris (Photo 156:e): A common Mediterra- nean species. Murex trunculus : A common Mediterranean species. This and the previous species were used for producing purple dye. This is not the case at Tel Qashish, however, since hundreds of snails would have been needed to extract a small amount of dye (Spanier 1986). Columbella rustica : Avery common small Mediterranean gastropod used as a bead in almost every period (Tornaritis 1987; Bar-Yosef 1989b). Conus mediterraneus : A common Mediterranean species, often found on the shore (Tornaritis 1987). Melanoides tuberculata : A freshwater gastropod found in streams and springs throughout Israel and the Near East (Schüft 1982:39; Mienis 1983:545). Melanopsis sp.: A freshwater gastropod found in streams and springs throughout Israel (Mienis 1983:545). Monacha sp.: A landsnail, often living on weeds (Bar-Yosef and Heller 1987:133), common in this region. Helix engaddensis (Photo 156:a): A relatively large landsnail, common in the Mediterranean climatic zone of Israel (Heller 1988:338). 415</page><page sequence="450">CHAPTER 25 Calaxis sp.: A minute landsnail (not larger than 1 cm), found at many archaeological sites (Bar-Yosef and Heller 1987; Heller 1988:337). Euchondrus sp.: A common landsnail that lives in this region (Heller 1988:338). Xeropicta vestalis : A common landsnail that lives in this region (Ibid.). Glycymeris violacescens : Avery common Mediterranean bivalve, the empty shells of which presently represent the most abundant species on the shores of the Mediterranean in Israel (Barash and Danin 1 982). Most of those shells are sub- fossil (Kaufman and Magaritz 1980:780). Cerastoderma glaucum (Photo 157:e): A common Medi- terranean bivalve, erroneously reported as Cardium edule in the past (Tornaritis 1987). Donax trunculus : A common Mediterranean bivalve (Tornaritis 1987:162). Unio terminālis". A freshwater bivalve common in streams; it still lived in the Kishon River until some 50 years ago, when the stream became polluted (Mienis 1983:547). Potomida littoralis (Photo 157 :a-d): A freshwater bivalve common in streams; it too still lived in the Kishon River until recently (Mienis 1983:547). Photo 156.

Since no pottery was found in L. 616, which is a burial, it could be dated either to the EB I or earlier. Table 30 presents the mollusc shells from these two loci. Both loci produced one or two marine shells and a rela- tively large number of landsnails, as well as a few Potomida littoralis. L. 575 yielded one and L. 616 six Melanopsis sp. The last two species originated in the nearby Kishon River. Since the sample size is very small, we cannot elaborate more specifically as to the age or possible use of these shells. However, it is our impression, judging by the dominance of landsnails, that it was probably a very short human occupa- tion, possibly even contemporaneous with the occupation of the landsnails, which are typical of abandoned sites. The Melanopsis sp. and the Cerastoderma glaucum fragment could be intrusive. Table 30: Pre-Early Bronze Age shells.

Area B Stratum XIIC: 1 Helix engaddensis and numerous fragments. Stratum XIIB: 29 Monacha sp. Stratum XIIA: No landsnails found. In addition, 1 Helix sp. and fragments, as well as 1 Monacha sp., derive from EB II-III contexts. LATER PERIODS AND OTHER LANDSNAILS In Stratum XI, assigned to the EB III or MB II, one fragment of Helix sp. was found. One Helix sp. from Area A and another from Area B were not assigned to a specific stratum or period. No landsnails were found in Middle Bronze Age or later strata. 417</page><page sequence="452">CHAPTER 25 DISCUSSION - LANDSNAILS Landsnails are the only group of molluscs that entered the site by themselves and were not brought in by humans. They are scarce (and in some strata absent) in Area A, but quite abundant in Area B, although their absence in Stratum XIII should be noted. When they do occur in relatively large quantities, however, it is a result for the most part of the shells being concentrated in specific loci, and often in one basket. In Stratum XVB, the majority of the landsnails comprises Monacha sp. from L. 566 and Helix engaddensis from L. 622 (Basket 4889). In Stratum XVA, most of the Monacha sp. and Xeropicta sp. come from L. 566 (in this locus, too, they appear both in Stratum XVA and Stratum XVB, but not on floor levels). In Stratum XIV, all the Helix sp. are from L. 553 (from both the floor and fill of the locus). In the EB II- III, there is one large concentration of Monacha sp. in L. 609 (Basket 4678). By and large, more landsnails were found in EB I than in EB II- III strata, and most come from Area B rather than Area A (Graph 5). Most landsnails were found in fills above floors. Some landsnail species, including those present at Tel Qashish, often live on weeds, which are characteristic of abandoned sites (Bar-Yosef and Heller 1987); some of these species may also be consumed by rodents. It is not surprising, therefore, to find them mainly in fills, but it should also be borne in mind that in many cases landsnails do burrow into the ground and easily fall into cracks. Conse- quently, their stratigraphie context is never certain, and any farther comment on this data would be merely speculation. Graph 5. Distribution of mollusc shells in the Early Bronze Age.

LATER PERIODS AND OTHER FRESHWATER SHELLS Two Melanopsis sp. were found in mixed or disturbed contexts, and several freshwater clams derive from Middle Bronze Age contexts, as follows: Area A. Potomida littoralis : 1 from Stratum X (MB IIA), 1 from Stratum IXA (MB IIB), and 2 from Stratum IXB (MB IIB). Area B: 1 broken valve of Unio terminālis and 1 Potomida littoralis derive from an MB II pit. Two juvenile valves oí Potomida littoralis were found in an Iron Age wall, as well as 2 valves in a mixed context and another in a Persian period pit. Three valves of Potomida littoralis were found that had an artificial hole perforated in the center of the shell (Photo 1 57:d): 1 in Area B Stratum XV (EB I), and 2 in Area A in MB IIB contexts (one from Stratum IXB and the other from Stratum IXA). Two additional Potomida littoralis found in Area B were not assigned to a specific stratum or period. Fragments were not included in the MNI counts presented above, but it is interesting to note that a total of 73 fragments of Unio terminālis were retrieved in Area A and 27 in Area B. Around 25 fragments oí Potomida littoralis were retrieved in Area A and an estimated 4,000 in Area B. These numbers seem to be proportionate with the numbers of complete and broken shells found in the two areas (Graph 5). DISCUSSION - FRESHWATER SHELLS There are two possible explanations for the presence of the freshwater gastropod, Melanopsis sp., at the site: (1) they were collected accidentally with the clay for making mudbricks, as was suggested in the case of the PPNB site of Yiftahel (Bar-Yosef and Heller 1987); or (2) they were randomly collected in the course of deliberately gathering other species of shellfish, a task usually attributed to women and children (Meehan 1982:81; Claassen 1992). The bivalves were probably gathered in the Kishon River for consumption. Most Potomida littoralis derive from Early Bronze Age strata. The few found within an Iron Age wall could have originated in earlier strata. Potomida littoralis and Unio terminālis were retrieved at the site by the thousands (counting everything from complete shells to tiny fragments). The large number of frag- ments is due to the fragility of the shells, which are composed mainly of aragonite, as opposed to calcite, like most marine shells. Postdepositional processes also contributed to the breakage, and in some instances, the shells broke during excavation. Since we are interested in an estimate of the actual number of shellfish, a minimum number was calcu- lated (see Methods section above). The Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) in the EB I and EB II- III is 452 (Graph 5). This relatively small number could be a result of the decay of some shells over time (Claassen 1991 :267). An alternative explanation may well be that most of the collected shells were not brought into the habitation area of the site but remain buried in the riverbanks. In terms of nutritional value, 452 clams do not contain much protein or calories, but they could be an important supplement to the diet, especially if the usual diet came under stress. Cohen suggests that "...shellfish are evidently low- prestige resources of last resort for a great many human populations, so that any increase in their utilization is probably significant. In individual cases, of course, the exploitation of shellfish may result from cultural preferences or from environmental changes.. .but a widespread increase in their importance presumably indicates a significant stress on other resources" (1977:79). In the case of the inhabitants of Tel Qashish, there is no indication that they had a cultural preference for shellfish: (1) there is no evidence of shellfishing at any archaeological site (in any period) in the southern Levant; (2) the quantities of shellfish remains are low; and (3) it seems they were not expert in opening the bivalves, and many had chipped edges (Photo 1 57 :a), which might indicate attempting to split open the bivalve with a hammerstone. A better and easier tech- nique for achieving this would be either baking the shells on heated pebbles and covering them with clay or steaming them. In both cases, the shells would pop open by themselves (Parmalee and Klippel 1974). The three artificially perforated Potomida littoralis probably had a secondary use as decoration.

In prehis- toric times throughout the Mediterranean basin it was usually collected for consumption (e.g., Reese 1978; Shackleton 1988). The presence of Patella sp. at Tel Qashish suggests that shellfishing was not unfamiliar to the inhabit- ants of the site. The Patella are found mainly in Area B in Stratum XIIB, at a stage when there seems to be a decline in the quantity of freshwater clams and an increase in marine shells. It is conceivable that the shellfish resources of the Kishon River were depleted due to over-harvesting, hence the decline in freshwater shells. As a result, EB II- III popula- tion would have had to go further afield and obtain shellfish in the Mediterranean. Since shellfish rots very rapidly and must be consumed shortly after gathering (unless it is preserved by smoking, etc.), most would probably have been consumed on the seashore rather than taken back to the habi- tation site. As yet, however, no shell middens are known on the Eastern Mediterranean coast from this period. In any event, this would explain the small quantity at the site of edible shellfish from the sea. Cerastoderma glaucum were worked into beads and their concentration in certain loci suggests they were part of a necklace or clothing decoration. The presence of Cerastoderma glaucum in Stratum XIIA in Area B supports a definite link with Stratum XIIA in Area A, where it is also</page><page sequence="455">SHELL BEADS, FRESHWATER CLAMS, AND LANDSNAILS FROM TEL QASHISH found in relatively large quantities. As in the case of the freshwater shells found in the Iron Age wall, the six Cerastoderma glaucum from the Iron Age probably derived from earlier strata, possibly Stratum XIIA. COMPARISONS The only other Early Bronze Age site in northern Israel for which an adequate report on the molluscan fauna has been published is Yiftahel (Bar-Yosef and Heller 1987), where, indeed, some of the same land and marine species are present, albeit in much smaller quantities. At Yiftahel, only one valve of Unio terminālis was found, which cannot suggest shellfishing. A few other reports of Early Bronze Age shell assemblages from other regions are noteworthy: Jericho (Biggs 1963), Megiddo (Bar-Yosef Mayer 2000), and Arad (Mienis forthcoming). A comparative study of these assemblages is beyond the scope of this paper. Shells are known from later periods at various sites. Some such examples are the reports on the shells from the Middle Bronze Age at Tel Mevorakh (Mienis 1984), as well as in various strata at the City of David (Mienis 1992). Unfortu- nately, these remains come mainly from later periods than those at Tel Qashish (only five 5 shells from the EB I are reported from the City of David), and the assemblages, there- fore, cannot be compared. At Tel Qashish, there are no shells from the Late Bronze Age strata, and the few shells from the Iron Age were found in walls and probably originated in the Early Bronze Age levels, despite the existence of later strata. CONCLUSIONS The fauna presented above is very rich and diverse. Tel Qashish would be defined as a "shell bearing midden site" according to Claassen's classification (1991 :259). There are few Early Bronze Age sites in the southern Levant from which the molluscan fauna is well known. The freshwater fauna is particularly intriguing, and several potential studies could follow, which might shed light on the suggestion that they were used for subsistence: 1. Seasonality. It is common for shellfish to be collected during certain seasons (e.g., Buchanan 1985), and it is there- fore possible that the freshwater bivalves from Tel Qashish were collected at a certain time. The results of a seasonality study might reflect a seasonal occupation of the site during EB I, or the seasonal gathering of shellfish within a year- round occupation (as reflected by the fortifications) during the EB II- III. To be able to determine the season during which the bivalves were collected, the life-cycle of the bivalve would have to be known (Claassen 1990). To date, the biology of Potomida littoralis has not been studied in detail, and, therefore, a seasonal study could not be conducted as yet. 2. Isotopie studies. Assuming that Potomida littoralis was indeed exploited for consumption, further evidence should be sought to support this. A study of the Strontium isotope in human remains from the EB I and EB II- III at the site (to date, there is one burial attributed to the Early Bronze Age [Sabari and Smith, this volume]) could determine whether freshwater molluscs constituted part of the diet (A. Sillen, personal communication). 3. Assessment of the place of shellfish in the diet of the Tel Qashish inhabitants, compared to other food residues from plant and animal resources over time. As mentioned above, although the caloric and protein values of freshwater bivalves are not high, they are rich in minerals, such as iron, phosphorous and calcium (Parmalee and Klippel 1974; Claassen 1991). According to studies concerning Early Bronze Age economy, animal husbandry (sheep, goat, and cattle) was common by then, and the animals were used for meat, milk, and other dairy products, as well as wool and possibly hide (Sherratt 1983; Horwitz and Tchernov 1989). Fruit trees and grain and pulse cultivation were common as well (Stager 1985; Liphschitz 1989), and the remains of wheat, vetch, and olives were found at Tel Qashish (Liphschitz, this volume). Climatic conditions were wetter than they are today, especially at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (Rosen 1989), which implies that water for crops would be abundant, as would pasture for the herds. Most of the human skeletal remains from this period, however, show signs of malnutrition (Smith 1989; Sabari and Smith, this volume). This supports the suggestion that the population needed dietary supplements and might have turned to shellfish exploitation. The reason for this situation, however, probably lies in social structure, rather than avail- ability of resources. There seems to be a decrease in the quantity of freshwater clams between the EB I and EB II- III, implying improved nutrition from other sources, despite the fact that climatic conditions worsened towards the end of the Early Bronze Age (Rosen 1989). This could have been the result either of a lack of clams due to over-harvesting or of the introduction of a somewhat better, more "just," division of resources due to the prosperity of the dominating city-state at the time (e.g., Ben-Tor 1992:97). All of these suggestions are viable, assuming that there was no change in population size or density. The absence of freshwater clams in all the later periods (Middle Bronze through Persian) at Tel Qashish could be a reflection of the introduction of new laws or taboos forbid- ding the consumption of shellfish (such as kashrut laws), or the result of different collection strategies employed in the excavation of the Early Bronze Age and later strata. It is clear from Graph 5 that the majority of the shells from Tel Qashish derive from Area B, because the excavations in Area B covered a much larger area than those in Area A. This applies especially to landsnails and freshwater clams. In the EB II- III, however, marine shells are more numerous in Area A, in inverse relation to the extent of the excavated area. The difference between Areas A and B attested by the architec- ture reflects possible social differences among the inhabit- ants of the site. The architecture in Area A seems to be more massive (Ben-Tor and Bonfil 1988). Thus, in the supposed habitations of the "rich," more shell beads (made of marine shells) were found, while the supposedly "poorer" area produced more remains of clams, representing food needed by the poor to supplement their diet. The absence of shells from Stratum XIII in Area B should be mentioned, especially in light of the numerous shells 421</page><page sequence="456">CHAPTER 25 present beneath and above this stratum. Stratum XIII, however, was poorly represented in the excavation and no associated floors were found. Marine shells have been used as beads/decorations in the southern Levant since the Paleolithic period (Bar-Yosef 1989b), and Tel Qashish is no exception in this respect. However, there is a sharp increase in the presence of marine shells over time: a total of 1 1 shells in the EB I, as opposed to 107 in the EB II- III. This might indicate a rise in the use and manufacture of crafts, and thus an amelioration in socio- economic conditions, or an even deeper hierarchy within society, with certain individuals using shell beads as a status symbol (as indicated by the concentration of shell beads in Area A, the "rich" habitation quarters). Finally, the large group of Cerastoderma glaucum deserves special attention. This species resembles in dimen- sions Glycymeris violacescens , and the two are often found side by side at archaeological sites (Bar-Yosef 1989b: 172), as well as on the shores of the eastern Mediterranean. In the EB III at Tel Qashish, however, there is a clear preponder- ance of Cerastoderma glaucum , yet another characteristic of the uniqueness of the site in terms of shell exploitation.

The average rainfall is 600 mm. The native arboreal climax vegetation is of Quercus calliprinos (Kermes oak), Pistacia palaestina (terebinth), and Olea europaea (olive). MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant material was collected during the excavations (Tables 3 1-32). Charred pieces of wood and charred fruit and seed remains were found in strata dating to the Bronze Age: 55 samples were from the Early Bronze Age, three from the Middle Bronze Age, and only one from the Late Bronze Age. More than half of the botanical material was comprised of charred pieces of wood (32 of the 55 samples collected). Some of the material was collected by means of flotation. Samples of charred wood of 1-2 cubic cm were taken for identification. The samples were aspirated in absolute ethyl alcohol, dipped in methyl-benzoate-celloidin solution for 24 hours and in benzene for 20 minutes. Thereafter, the samples were transferred to 50°-55°C paraffin for 48 hours. Blocks were prepared and 10-15 micron sections were cut with a sliding microtome. Cross, as well as longitudinal, tangential and radial sections, were prepared. The anatomical identifi- cation of the wood was made from these sections by compar- ison with reference sections of systematically identified species. Excavated fruits and seeds were compared with recent fruits and seeds. Specimens were identified and clas- sified according to species, locus, and basket. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Three species of trees and three of edible plants were found in the material collected at Tel Qashish (Tables 31-32). Of these, the olive {Olea europaea) was the most common: 50% of the wood samples ( 1 6 of 32) and 55% of the fruits ( 1 5 of 27 baskets). Olives characterize the Mediterranean area and today grow in the mountainous regions throughout the country, both by cultivation and as escapees. Before human interference, olives were native to this area. Today, however, it is impossible to distinguish between wild and cultivated specimens according to the wood structure, either from recent material or from excavated remains (Liphschitz et al. 1991). Olives were found to be most common also at 424 neighboring sites in Jezreel Valley, for example, at Tel Qiri 3000 years ago, where they constituted around 45% of the wood collected (Liphschitz and Waisel 1987). At Tel Taanach, olive stones and wood were the most common remains from the Early, Middle, and Late Bronze Age, as well as the Iron Age strata (Liphschitz and Waisel 1980). Olive wood constituted 59 of the 73 wood samples collected at the site. At Tel Megiddo, olive wood and stones were the most common remains from the Chalcolithic period and the Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age, as well as in the Iron Age strata. Olive wood remains constituted 85 of the 151 samples (Liphschitz 2000). At Tel Yoqne'am, olive was found to be common during the Iron Age (Liphschitz 1986-7), as it was at Tel Jezreel (Liphschitz 1991; 1992; 1994). Another wood species identified at Tel Qashish, consti- tuting some 40% of the wood samples gathered, is Quercus calliprinos (Kermes oak). Quercus calliprinos is the main constituent of the maquis, together with Pistacia palaestina. This association was found to be the dominant arboreal climax community of the Mediterranean region in antiquity (Liphschitz and Biger 1990). Four samples of Quercus calliprinos from the Middle and Late Bronze Age were iden- tified at Tel Taanach (Liphschitz and Waisel, 1980); 18 samples from the Chalcolithic period, Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age, as well as from Iron Age strata, were iden- tified at Tel Megiddo (Liphschitz 2000); five samples came from Iron Age strata at Tel Qiri (Liphschitz and Waisel 1987); and 32 samples were found at Tel Jezreel (Liphschitz 1991; 1992; 1994). Twenty samples of Quercus calliprinos wood remnants originated from these archaeological levels at Tel Yoqne'am (Liphschitz 1986-7). A few samples (3 of 32) of Pistacia palaestina were found in the Early and Middle Bronze Age strata at Tel Qashish. A single sample was found at Tel Qiri (Liphschitz and Waisel 1987), and a few samples at Tel Taanach (Liphschitz and Waisel 1980), as well as at Tel Yoqne'am (Liphschitz 1986-7). Sixteen wood samples of this species were found in the Chalcolithic, Early, Middle, and Late Bronze Age, and Iron Age strata at Tel Megiddo (Liphschitz 2000), and 25 samples in Iron Age strata at Tel Jezreel (Liphschitz 1 99 1 ; 1992; 1994). Olea europaea, Quercus calliprinos, and Pistacia palaestina represent Mediterranean climatic conditions. These three species constitute 100% of the wood remains at Tel Qashish; 91% (1 1 of 12 samples) at Tel Qiri; 89% (65 of 73 samples) at Tel Taanach; 78.8% (119 of 151 samples) at Tel Megiddo; 78.8% (123 of 156 samples at Tel Jezreel; and</page><page sequence="459">ANALYSIS OF THE BOTANICAL REMAINS FROM TEL QASHISH 88% (73 of 83 samples) at Tel Yoqne'am. Their presence in archaeological strata suggests, therefore, that the same conditions as today's prevailed in the area in antiquity. Among the edible fruits, olives were most common, and stones were collected in 1 1 loci (15 baskets) at Tel Qashish. The same applies to the other, neighboring sites. In the Iron Age strata at Tel Qiri, olive stones were found in 25 loci (29 baskets); at Tel Yoqne'am in 23 loci (35 baskets); at Tel Taanach in 26 loci (52 baskets); at Tel Megiddo in 21 loci (25 baskets); and at Tel Jezreel in 43 loci (60 baskets). Seeds of wheat ( Triticum ) and vetch (Vicia) were found at Tel Qashish and were collected at the other five sites as well, though in only a few loci. The presence of edible fruits may indicate dietary habits of the time (Liphschitz 1989). The environmental conditions that prevailed in the vicinity of Tel Qashish enabled them to grow in the area of the site. The fact that the same plant species that exist in the area today were also present in the past supports the conclusions already drawn from other dendroarchaeological investiga- tions, namely, that the flora was stable. The macroclimate of the entire area has remained the same for the last 10,000 years (Liphschitz 1986; 1988). Table 3 1 : Wood remains. Area Locus Basket Period Species Remarks A 446 6081 EB?

The site is located in the Mediterranean phytogeographic region, on the north bank of the Kishon River, and receives ca. 600-700 mm of rain per annum (Orni and Efrat 1980). As Tel Qashish was occupied over a long period, it offers an excellent opportu- nity to examine diachronic trends in animal exploitation in this region. The faunai remains described here originate from two excavation areas, A and B, and represent a consecutive sequence spanning the EB I through the Persian period (with the exception of the Iron Age III, from which no animal bones were recovered). Much of the material derives from loci that were stratigraphically unsealed, such as fills and pits. Because of the small size of the animal bone samples recovered in each area, the assemblages from both areas were combined and are described below by period. In total, 1495 animal bones from the site were identified to taxon. They are generally well preserved and the assemblage comprises mainly large pieces and relatively complete bones. This bias results from the fact that the assemblage was almost entirely hand-collected and systematic sieving was carried out only for the Early Bronze Age levels. This may explain the rarity of remains of smaller species (rodents, reptiles, birds, small carnivores and fish) from later periods. For each species, the total number of identifiable bones (NISP) was summed and converted into frequencies. Morphological criteria given in Boessneck (1969) and Prummel and Frisch (1986) were used to distinguish sheep from goats. Ageing was accomplished with reference to epiphyseal fusion (fused or unfüsed) and dental eruption (Silver 1969: 285-286). In addition, dental attrition stages were scored for teeth in the lower jaw, following Payne (1973) for sheep (Ovis aries) and goat ( Capra hircus ) and Grant (1982) for cattle (Bos taurus) and pig ( Sus scrofa). Skeletal elements were grouped into five categories following Horwitz et al. (1996). It must be emphasized that * Special thanks to Prof. A. Ben-Tor for allowing me to study the Qashish fauna and to Ms. Ruhama Bonfil for her invalu- able assistance in organizing the material and providing the necessary stratigraphie information. the meager size of the bone samples for each period limits in- depth interpretation of management strategies, such as the construction of age profiles, for most periods. Bone measurements follow those outlined by den Driesch (1976), with additions noted in the text where relevant. DOMESTIC TAXA PERSIAN PERIOD The animal remains from this period comprise 94 identified bones and 34 unidentified fragments. Domestic species represented in descending order of importance (Table 33) are sheep/goat, cattle and a single bone of a chicken ( Gallus gallus). In the southern Levant, remains of chicken are rare before the Roman/Byzantine period; an example of published material predating that from Tel Qashish is an isolated chicken bone from the Iron Age II levels at the City of David (Horwitz and Tchernov 1996). Of the separated sheep/goat bones, remains of goats were the most common (Table 34). The sheep/goat component was made up mainly of forelimb and hindlimb elements (Table 35a), which are rich in meat. Age profiles indicate a predominance of immature animals, with 75% of animals being slaughtered below 2 years of age (Table 36a). Dental attrition scored on isolated sheep/goat teeth supported the bone fusion data, with a predominance of young animals: deciduous m3=Stage B (2-6 months), M3=pre-Stage D (less than 2 years) and Ml=Stage C/D (less than 2 years), while a left adult jaw (Stage G) was aged as 4-6 years. A predomi- nance of young animals suggests exploitation of animals primarily for meat (Payne 1973). In terms of skeletal elements, the cattle sample shows an even distribution (Table 35b). The cattle sample comprised mainly bones of immature animals, 50% of which were slaughtered below 3 years of age (Table 36b). Attrition stages scored on three isolated cattle teeth gave the following scores: M2=Stage K; Ml=Stage C; deciduous m3=Stage J. Cut marks were observed on the ventral surface of a cattle rib, in the form of two parallel cut marks immediately below the proximal epiphysis. They probably represent dismem- berment of the rib rack. 427</page><page sequence="462">CHAPTER 27 Table 33.

Cattle bones were slightly more common than those of sheep/goat, while pig constituted a minor element (Table 33). Goat was twice as common as sheep (Table 34). Sheep/goat remains were characterized by a majority of meat-rich trunk and limb elements (Table 35a). Based on bone fusion, some 50% of sheep/goat were killed below 2 years of age, with only 25% surviving into adulthood (Table 36a), supporting a model of exploitation aimed at meat production (Payne 1973). Dental age supported the bone fusion data and was assessed for two isolated sheep/goat teeth: a deciduous m3=Stage C (6-12 months) and an M2=Stage D (1-2 years). In addition, two adult left jaws could be scored, one with an average of Stage E (2-3 years) and the other assigned to Stage F (3-4 years). The most common cattle bodyparts were those of the meat-rich trunk, followed by the hindlimb; this pattern, together with the high immature cull, is typical of herds raised for meat (Table 35b). For cattle, dental attrition scores for a right jaw were Ml=Stage K and M2=Stage G, while isolated teeth had scores of M3=Stage G and M3=Stage F. Bone fusion data indicates that 50% of animals were slaugh- tered below 3.5 years (Table 36b). Few modifications were observed on the Iron Age II bones. Cut marks, all associated with carcass dismember- ment, were observed on only four bones (2% of identified material): in the area immediately below a sheep/goat proximal rib, in two instances just above the epiphysis of a distal cattle humerus on the anterior aspect of the bone, and below a cattle proximal scapula, also on the anterior aspect. Four unidentified bone splinters, two cattle bones (a 1st phalanx and a tibia shaft) and a gazelle horncore were burnt. This is only 1 .5% of the identified remains and 2.4% of all bones in this sample. IRON AGE I A small sample of 6 bones derived from an Iron Age I context (L. 374) in Area A comprised sheep/goat, pig and cattle bones (Table 33). LB II From this period, 87 identified bones and 29 unidentified fragments were recovered. Domesticates represented were sheep/goat and cattle, the latter (67.8%) in the majority (Table 37). One locus yielded an adult male goat horncore with a twist typical of domestic goats. Remains of sheep were also identified. Skeletal element representation is relatively even for sheep/goat, while limb and foot bones are the most common elements for cattle (Table 35a, b). Bone fusion calculated for the LB II sample indicates that all cattle were killed by 4 years of age, though sample sizes are extremely small (Table 36b). One jaw fragment has a PM4 just erupting, repre- senting an immature animal. Sheep/goat constituted only a minor element (17%), with 100% killed before 2 years (sample size, however, is small) (Table 36a). No dental attri- tion/eruption data were available for sheep/goat. One cattle calcaneum exhibited cut marks on its distal tip. No burnt bones were found in this sample. LB I From this period 129 identified bones and 44 unidentified splinters were recovered. Sheep/goat remains were the most common, followed by cattle and a few remains of pig (Table 37). For cattle, trunk elements are the most common bodyparts (Table 35b). The few cattle bones that provided age data indicate that 40% of remains belong to animals culled at less than 3 years (Table 36b). A cattle lower M2 had Stage B wear and is derived from a young animal. The distribution of sheep/goat skeletal elements is rela- tively even, with a marked paucity of foot bones that is probably due to incomplete bone retrieval during the excava- tion (Table 35a). By 3 years, 50% of sheep/goat had been culled, rising to 83% by 3.5 years (Table 36a).Two complete sheep/goat jaws gave dental attrition scores of Stage G (4-6 years) and another Stage F (3-4 years). Isolated teeth that could be scored were an M2=Stage C (6-12 months) and an M2=Stage D (1-2 years). Pig remains included a maxillary Ml not in wear and a Table 37.

No longbones could be aged. Three sheep/goat bones exhibited butchery damage: a goat horncore with a deep chop mark just above its base resulting from an attempt to remove the horn, a proximal metacarpal with parallel cut marks that are associated with skinning on its proximal end, and a lumbar vertebra cut verti- cally through the centrum, probably during carcass division and dismemberment. One of the unidentified splinters and a sheep/goat proximal humerus were burnt. MB IIC* The assemblage associated with this period comprised 71 identified and 40 unidentified bones. Sheep and goat remains clearly dominate the assemblage, followed by cattle (Table 38). Pig is represented by only four bones. Two other domestic species represented were a small equid, probably a donkey ( Equus asinus), represented by an upper molar which was not in wear (with a basal measurement of L: 23.6 and B: 24.2), and an isolated distal humerus of a domestic dog ( Canis familiaris) measuring: Bd: 30.4. BT: 20.7 and HT: 12.8. Sheep/goat and cattle skeletal elements showed little selection for particular elements (Table 35a, b), while the data for pig were too scanty for analysis (Table 35c). Sheep/goat epiphyseal fusion data illustrate that 67% of the animals had been killed below 3 years (Table 36a), while 67% of cattle were slaughtered below 3.5 years (Table 36b). This indicates a slight emphasis on the exploitation of young adults, with over 33% of animals surviving into adulthood (though note the very small sample size). * Stratum VIII, defined here as "MB IIC," is defined as "end of the MB IIB" elsewhere in this report. Few modifications were found on bones in this sample. A sheep/goat rib was burnt, as was an unidentified splinter. Fine cut marks evident on the shaft of a sheep/goat tibia, about one third of the way up from the distal epiphysis, may represent filleting marks. A pig lumbar vertebra exhibited cut marks on the centrum that may be associated with removal of the rib rack. MB IIA-B The MB IIA-B sample comprised 292 identified bones and 65 unidentified fragments. The economy at the site in this period is one based on sheep/goat followed by pig, with cattle constituting a minor component. In addition, a wide range of wild animals is found (Table 38). With respect to sheep/goat bodyparts, meat-rich trunks and limbs predominate, while cranial and foot elements, which are usually discarded at butchery as they have less meat, are poorly represented (Table 35a). For cattle, trunk elements are the most common bodyparts, while for pig, cranial and trunk elements are the most abundant (Table 35b, c). The high frequency of less meaty bodyparts for pig and cattle suggests that they represent primarily butchery refuse or poorer meat cuts, while the sheep/goat remains reflect meat-rich consumption debris. As a large part of the assemblage is derived from a street between houses and hence represents refuse resulting from multiple activities, this may account for the observed inter-specific variation in skeletal element representation. As documented in Table 36a, few sheep/goat were slaugh- tered before 1 year. There was, however, selective slaughter of immature animals, with 72% being culled before 2 years and a slight increase to 75% by 3.5 years. Dental attrition data are limited to scores on two jaws, one aged 6-12 months (Stage C) and another aged 3-4 years (Stage F). In addition, Table 38.

The dental data corroborate the findings based on sheep/goat bone fusion, reflecting an emphasis on the exploitation of young animals. The small cattle samples (Table 36b) show the presence only of adult animals in the sample, while pigs show an inverse pattern, with a 100% cull of immature animals (Table 36c). Modifications associated with carcass dismemberment were observed on four bones. A sheep/goat femur had parallel cut marks across the proximal epiphysis, a sheep/goat cervical vertebra was severed horizontally through the centrum and a cattle proximal humerus had a cut mark across the epiphysis. In addition, a fallow deer distal radius had multiple and deep chop marks where the ulna had been fused onto the shaft, probably in an attempt to separate the bones. Four sheep/goat bones (two proximal scapulae, a metatarsal shaft and a tibia shaft) and four unidentified splin- ters were burnt. EB III The EB III assemblage comprised a sample of 236 identified and 121 unidentified bones. Cattle remains are twice as numerous as those of sheep/goat. Other domestic species identified are a small equid, probably a donkey ( Equus asintis), represented by an upper molar, and an isolated bone of a domestic dog ( Canis familiaris). A wide range of wild taxa was also found (Table 39). For sheep/goat, five of the four bodypart categories are represented in similar frequencies. The fifth category, foot bones, is rare (Table 35a). Slaughter of 40% of sheep/goat had taken place by 1 year of age, increasing to 50% by 2 years and 60% by 3.5 years. The remaining 40% of animals were kept into maturity and probably represent reproductive females (Table 36a). Dental attrition scores show that one complete tooth row is from a mature animal aged 3-4 years (Stage F), while the other is from a juvenile aged 2-3 years (Stage E). Isolated teeth gave an age of 3-4 years for an M3 (Stage F) and 1-2 years for an M2 (Stage D). For cattle, meat-rich limb and trunk elements are the most abundant bodypart categories (Table 35b). Few cattle were slaughtered below 2 years of age, but by 3.5 years, 50% of cattle had been culled; however, the remaining 50% survived into adulthood (Table 36b). Taken together with the high frequency of cattle remains in this assemblage (56%), this mortality profile fits well with a husbandry strategy aimed at raising beasts of burden, primarily for agricultural work. It is probable that most of the 50% of animals slaughtered for meat when immature were young males. Table 39.

Only three bone splinters were burnt. EB II The faunai assemblage from the EB II comprised 252 identi- fied bones and 174 unidentified fragments. The overall pattern for the EB II is an assemblage dominated by sheep/goat, followed by cattle. Pig and wild taxa play a minor role in the subsistence base (Table 39). The only other domestic animal remains recovered from EB II deposits were 21 longbones and vertebrae of a domestic dog 0 Canis familiaris), recovered in a single locus. Measure- ments taken on the bones were: distal humerus Bd: 29.3; BT: 2 1 .0; Ht: 12.6; distal tibia Bd: 20.9; Dd: 14.9; calcaneum GL: 39.3. For sheep/goat and cattle, trunk elements are the most common bodypart category (Table 35a, b) and may represent consumption discards, while the pig remains are too meager to facilitate analysis. Some 25% of sheep/goat were killed below the age of 2 years, increasing to a 72% cull by 3.5 years (Table 36a). Consequently, only some 30% of animals survived into adulthood. Four isolated sheep/goat teeth gave ages ranging between 1-2 years (two M2s with Stage D attrition), 2-3 years (an Ml with Stage E attrition) and 3-4 years (an M3 with Stage F attrition). A similarly high juvenile cull is found for cattle, with 67% being slaughtered by 3.5 years (Table 36b). Such a mortality pattern is consistent with culling aimed at meat production (Payne 1973). Two burnt sheep/goat bones and nine burnt splinters were identified. EB I The assemblage of this period comprises 131 identified bones and 92 unidentified splinters. Sheep/goat remains are twice as numerous as those of cattle, while pig remains are the third most common taxon. No otljer domestic taxa were recovered from this assemblage, but it contains a broad spectrum of wild species (Table 39). For sheep/goat, trunk elements are the predominant bodyparts, while for cattle and pig a more even representa- tion of elements is found, though sample sizes are very small (Table 35a-c). Bone fusion results indicate that 67% of all sheep/goat were slaughtered below the age of 2 years (Table 36a). The single sheep/goat jaw that was scored gave an age of 1-2 years (Stage D). No bone fusion data were available for cattle. The pig remains in this period were all immature animals aged less than 2 years (Table 36b), though the small sample sizes should be noted. This pattern indicates a selec- tion of animals for meat. Though no cut-marked bones were found in this collec- tion, a sheep homcore fragment and a sheep/goat rib were burnt, as were two unidentified bone splinters 434 WILD TAXA (Tables 33, 37-39) ARTIODACTYLA Three phalanges, because of their extremely large size, have tentatively been identified as belonging to the aurochs (Bos primigenius) (see measurements in Appendix A). A second phalanx was found in an MB IIA-B context (L. 228), a first phalanx in an EB III context (L. 5 1 8A) and a third phalanx in an EB II context (L. 402). Measurements for all three bones fall outside the range of the other cattle bones from the site and within the size range of aurochs from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B site of Kfar Hahoresh in the Lower Galilee (Horwitz and Goring-Morris submitted). Aurochs have been identified from several later Iron Age contexts in the southern Levant at sites such as Tell Hesban (von den Driesch and Boessne^k 1995:88) and Kamid el-Loz (Bokonyi 1990), and consequently their presence at Tel Qashish during the Bronze Age is not surprising. Despite the widespread distribution (even today) of wild boar (Sus scrofa) in the Galilee (Mendelssohn and Yom-Tov 1999), and the proximity of the site to suitable habitats for wild boar such as forested hills, the Carmel mountain range and the banks of the Kishon River, only three remains could be ascribed to this taxon: an astragalus from the LB I (L. 381), an upper first molar from the EB III (L. 523 A) and a second metatarsal from the EB III (L. 345). The scarcity of this species may be due to methodological problems in iden- tifying wild boar, as most of the pig remains at the site are those of immature animals. These unfiised bones do not facilitate the use of metrical parameters to determine their domestic status (e.g. following Payne and Bull 1988). Consequently, the possibility that some of the immature specimens at Tel Qashish represent boar rather than domestic piglets cannot be ruled out. A total of 15 bones was identified as belonging to the mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella). Their remains are found from the EB I to the Iron Age II. Gazella is the most common wild ungulate still found in the Mediterranean zone of Israel, especially in the Lower and Upper Galilee (Mendelssohn and Yom-Tov 1999). The Iron Age II (L. 205) and EB II (L. 441) remains include horncore fragments of adult males. The other remains are longbones and phalanges of mature animals. Remains of the Persian fallow deer (Dama dama mesopotamica ) were found in all periods at the site. This is the only cervid species identified, and it is most likely that the undetermined cervid remains found in several strata also belong to this species. The remains include two naturally shed antlers (L. 400, EB III; L. 371, LB IIB), fragments of antler tine and various post-cranial elements (Appendix A). The LB IIB fallow deer remains belong to a robust individual, probably a large male. The fallow deer, which inhabited the woods of the Galilee and Mount Carmel, fell victim to the introduction of firearms into the region and became extinct in the early 20th century (Yom-Tov and Mendelssohn 1 988). CARNIVORES The red fox (Vulpes vulpes ) is represented by only five</page><page sequence="469">FAUNA FROM TEL QASHISH lumbar vertebrae from a single MB IIA-B locus (L. 312) and an isolated canine from the EB II (L. 447). This species is probably the most common carnivore in Israel and has a wide geographic distribution (Mendelssohn and Yom-Tov 1 999). A single distal humerus of a badger was found in an EB III context (L. 346). Two species of badger are known today in Israel, the common badger and the honey badger. The Tel Qashish remains most likely belong to the common badger {Meles meles), which even today occurs in the area of the site (Mendelssohn and Yom-Tov 1999). A left ulna of a bear ( Ursus sp.) was recovered in an EB III context (L. 327). It belongs to an extremely large adult animal. Although not a common taxon, bear remains have been found in several sites in the region, including in the EB III levels at the site of Qiryat Ata (Horwitz in press). The Syrian bear ( Ursus arctos syriacus ) inhabited the southern Levant into modern times, with the last animals being reported from Mount Hermon in the 1950s (Yom-Tov and Mendelssohn 1988). LAGOMORPHA The Cape hare ( Lepus capensis) was represented by a single distal humerus with a fiised epiphysis recovered from an EB I level (L. 534). The remains have the same patina as the other bones from this deposit, indicating that they are not intrusive. RODENTS The Palestine mole rat ( Spalax ehrenbergi ) is a common intrusive element in archaeological sites in the Mediterra- nean zone, as it is known to burrow up to 1 .5 m underground (Mendelssohn and Yom-Tov 1999). All the rodent remains from Tel Qashish are attributable to this species and all are fresh in appearance, indicating that they are not associated with the archaeological deposits. BIRDS Remains of three species of wild bird were identified at the site, all from Early Bronze Age levels. It is likely that since other deposits were not systematically sieved, many bird bones were not recovered. The rock dove {Columba livid) was represented by a distal humerus from an EB II context (L. 437), and a proximal coracoid and proximal ulna from EB I deposits (L. 534, L. 575). A distal ulna and a proximal furcula of the mallard duck {Anas platyrynchos) were identified in an EB I context (L. 534). The mallard is essentially a wintering duck in Israel, though some are passage migrants and others breed here. Breeding areas include the Jezreel Valley around Lake Kishon (Paz 1987). A proximal tibiotarsus of a large raptor belonging to the Falconiformes family, possibly an eagle, was identified in an EB III context (L. 346). In addition, several fragmented longbone shafts that could not be identified to taxon were recovered. They are listed in the bird sp. category in Table 39. INSECTIVORES A lower jaw fragment and a maxillary fragment of the East European hedgehog {Erinaceus concolor) were found in the assemblage. This nocturnal species is found throughout the Mediterranean region. Both items were recovered from MB IIA-B contexts (L. 313, L. 250). They belong to two different animals and may represent more recent intru- sions. REPTILES The spur-thighed tortoise {Testudo graeca) was primarily represented by carapace fragments and two pelvis bones and was found in LB II, EB II and EB I levels. Tortoise remains were especially abundant in the EB I levels. Since the patina on the bones suggests that they do not represent later intru- sions, the possibility that this species was a dietary item cannot be ruled out. FISH (by O. Lernau) Ten small fish bones were identified from the Early Bronze Age strata at Tel Qashish. They represent two marine fish, the gilt-head sea bream {Sparus aurata ) and the flat-headed gray mullet {Mugil cephalus), and one freshwater fish, the Nile catfish {Ciarias gariepinus). The Nile catfish inhabits the coastal rivers of Israel, such as the Yarkon, as well as the Jordan River (Goren 1983). It was probably fished from the Kishon River, which flows near the site. Both the sea bream and gray mullet are common in the Mediterranean Sea and are found along coastal inshore waters (Golani 1997). They are highly valued as food. All fishes in the Qashish sample were small in size. EB III A tooth of the Sparidae family, probably Sparus aurata, was recovered from L. 583. EB II A left articular of Ciarias gariepinus, giving an estimated standard length of 42 cm, was found in L. 447. EB I Fish bones of three species derive from a single locus of this period (L. 526). The first species, the Nile catfish {Ciarias gariepinus Clariidae), was represented by a right articular with an estimated standard length for this fish of 40 cm. In addition, two small skull fragments probably belonging to Ciarias gariepinus were also identified. The second species, the gilt-head sea bream {Sparus aurata Sparidae) was identi- fied on the basis of a right dentary. The estimated standard length of this fish is 19 cm. Remains of a third species, the flat-headed gray mullet, Mugil cephalus (Mugilidae), were also present. It was represented by a left hyomandibular giving an estimated standard length of 35 cm. Other fish remains of the EB I comprise a right ceratohyal of Ciarias gariepinus and an unidentified tail bone (L. 568), and a caudal vertebra of the Mugilidae family giving an esti- mated standard length of 31 cm (L. 579). 435</page><page sequence="470">CHAPTER 27 CRUSTACEA Claws of the freshwater crab (Potamon potamios ) were recovered from EB II and EB I levels. Together with the presence of remains of the freshwater mussel, Unio (Bar- Yosef, this volume), they attest to the exploitation of fresh- water resources from the Kishon River. Whether the crab remains represent dietary items or accidental manuports is difficult to determine, although the paucity of these remains would suggest the latter. Graph 6. Relative frequencies of the three main categories of domestic taxa represented at Tel Qashish: sheep/goat, cattle and pig (data derived from Tables 33, 37-39). DISCUSSION In order to examine diachronic trends in animal exploitation at Tel Qashish, the relative frequencies of the three main domestic animal categories (sheep/goat, cattle and pig) exploited over time at the site were tested using a chi-square test. Graph 6 and Table 40 illustrate the diachronic patterning, summed for the different periods as the total number of bones for these domestic taxa, excluding domestic equids, birds and carnivores and wild fauna. Chi- square tests were carried out on sequential periods (e.g. Persian-Iron II, Iron II-LB II, LB II-LB I, etc.) With the exception of the MB IIC-LB I and Iron II-Persian periods, all other periods show significant differences in species composition (P&lt;0.000) from the immediately preceding period, attesting to marked diachronic shifts in animal management strategies. It has been proposed by Redding ( 1 993) that communities which invest in intensive agriculture will keep many cattle and fewer pigs, while the sheep/goat to cattle ratio in these economies should fall within the range of 1:1 to 1:10. Bearing Redding 's model in mind, three main animal management strategies which characterize different periods may be defined at Qashish: 1 . The first strategy fits Redding's definition of economies aimed primarily at agriculture and is exemplified by the EB III and LB II assemblages. Both are periods in which cattle numbers are double those of sheep/goat and pigs are absent (LB II) or present in low frequencies (4% in the EB III). 2. The second management strategy, which characterizes the EB I and the MB IIA-B, reflects an economy with a focus on pork and to some extent also on wool production. This is attested to by the relatively high frequency of pig, mainly immature animals (19% and 34% respectively), while sheep/goat constitute about half the remains (57% and 55%). Sheep:goat ratios are high (Table 34). In the MB IIA-B, cattle frequencies are very low (11%), indicating little activity relating to cultivation, while they are higher (24%) in the EB I, suggesting some investment in agriculture in this period. 3. The third strategy is one based on sheep/goat exploita- tion, mainly for secondary products (milk and its products, wool). It is accompanied by some investment in agriculture but little pig keeping. Periods which fall into this category are the EB II, MB IIC, LB I and possibly also the Persian period. In all of these assemblages sheep/goat predominate and constitute between 56% and 67% of the bone assem- blage, followed by cattle, which range from 27% to 39%. Pigs are a minor component and make up the remaining 5% or 6%. A variation on this strategy is the Iron Age II sample, which has equal numbers of sheep/goat and cattle but almost no pigs. The absence of pigs in this period may however reflect ethnic affinities rather than economic choice (Hesse 1990). Distinguishing sheep remains from those of goats is noto- riously difficult on fragmented and incomplete bones. As shown in Table 34, separation was attempted on a limited number of elements, while the bulk were placed in a combined sheep/goat category. The results indicate that in all but one period represented at Tel Qashish (the EB II), goats are slightly more abundant than sheep (Table 34). However, throughout the Early Bronze Age and until the end of the MB IIA-B, sheep numbers are high and almost equal to goat (40% or more). In the EB II, sheep predominate. Although the size of the samples of separated bones is small, these results corroborate a general trend which has also been found at other Early Bronze Age sites in the southern Levant Table 40. Relative frequencies of the three main categories of domestic taxa represented at Tel Qashish: sheep/goat, cattle and pig (data from Tables 33, 37-39). i EBI I EBII I EB III MB IIA-B I MBIIC I LB I I LBII I Iron II Persian s/g 57 56 32 ~ 55 67 61 28 49 " 64 cattle 24 39 64 11 27 34 72 50 36 pig 19 I 5 4 I 34 6 I 5 0 ļ 1 0 436 MB ||C 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100*/ ■s/g □cattle Hpig</page><page sequence="471">FAUNA FROM TEL QASHISH (Horwitz and Tchernov 1989; Grigson 1995; Hesse and Wapnish 2001 ; Wapnish and Hesse 2000; Horwitz in press). In these studies, it has been noted that sheep are more abundant than goats in Early Bronze Age assemblages, a trend that has been associated with the development of large- scale wool production, possibly for sale in markets. Goat- dominated assemblages are interpreted as typical of house- hold economies aimed at local production and consumption of meat and milk (Redding 1993), a husbandry strategy which characterizes the LB I through Persian period occupa- tion of the site (though probably not the LB II, which reflects an extensive investment in agriculture). When the relative frequencies of animals are converted into animal protein as dietary items, it should be borne in mind that a cow provides a markedly greater quantity of meat than a sheep, goat or pig. Consequently, the predominance of sheep/goat in most periods does not imply that they were the major meat source at that time. Furthermore, the quantity and quality of milk produced by these species differs, as do the secondary products obtained from each. Moreover, a cow kept for labor can also be milked, as can a female sheep raised for wool. For a better understanding of how the different taxa were exploited, we have to turn to their mortality profiles and skeletal element representation. Interpretation of the kill-off patterns for Tel Qashish is confounded by the small number of bones and teeth that could be used to construct age profiles (Table 36a-c). The general trend for sheep/goat in all periods was of ca. 65-75% of the animals being slaughtered before adulthood, when all longbones fuse (i.e. 3.5 years), with only some 25-35% surviving past this age. These probably represent ewes which served as breeding stock. This pattern is consistent with a subsistence economy aimed primarily at meat produc- tion, and less at secondary products (milk, milk products, wool). However, the EB I, EB III and MB IIC, which have the lowest proportions of immature mortality (60-67%), also have the highest frequencies of sheep remains. Such a mortality pattern would typify a management strategy aimed at wool production. For cattle the picture is less clear, due to the extremely small sample sizes. In all periods represented at the site, there is a trend of 50-65% of animals being slaughtered before adulthood, with 35-50% surviving into adukhood. These probably served as beasts of burden and for tasks such as plowing. There does not appear to be any correlation between periods with the highest frequencies of cattle and low immature culls, but the small sample sizes may mask such a pattern. In contrast, for pig a clear and cohesive pattern is observed for all periods, with the overwhelming majority of animals culled by their second year. Such a mortality profile is consistent with a species that is exploited solely for its meat, fat and skin. Although it is difficult to assess the domestic status of the immature pigs through the application of metrical parameters, it was assumed that most represented domesticates. This, as a high immature cull, is characteristic of meat production under conditions of animal husbandry (Meadow 1989). Diachronic changes in the representation of sheep/goat skeletal elements were tested using paired chi-square tests for the total number of bones per species and bodypart category in each period in the same manner as cited above. The results show that, with the exception of the EB III-MB IIA-B (which gave a rather low P value of P=0.04), no significant inter-period differences were found in the relative proportions of the different bodyparts. For sheep/goat, all bodypart categories are represented in all periods. Trunk elements followed by fore and hindlimbs are generally the most common, and cranial and foot elements the least. This indicates a selection of the meatier parts of the skeleton and is consistent with consumption debris. The quantity of trunk elements may be slightly inflated due to the inclusion of frag- mented ribs and vertebrae, while the scarcity of foot bones is probably related to the fact that much of the assemblage was hand collected and not sieved. Cattle remains showed a more mosaic pattern. Significant differences were found between the Iron II-Persian period (P=0.04), LB II-Iron II (P=0.000) and LB I-LB II (P=0.000). In the LB II cattle sample forelimb and hindlimb elements were markedly higher than in the LB I, while the Iron II assemblage contained markedly more trunk elements than the LB II and Persian period samples. For most periods, however, a relatively even representation of all bodyparts was found, suggesting access to complete carcasses and possibly on-site slaughter of animals. As for sheep/goat, all samples suffered from under-representation of foot elements (phalanges), probably a result of the collection methods during the excavation. Table 41 .

In the Persian period this increases slightly to 8%. Associated with the decrease in the relative frequency of wild fauna is a diachronic decrease in the number of taxa. Although sample size is known to play a critical role in determining species richness and diversity (Grayson 1984), the trend observed at Tel Qashish does not appear to be dictated by sample size, since similar-sized or larger assemblages, such as those of the Iron II (NISP=199) and LB I (NISP= 1 29), have markedly fewer taxa than the EB I sample (NISP=131) (Table 41). It is tempting to conclude from the relative proportions of wild to domestic taxa at Tel Qashish that from the MB IIA-B onwards, the subsistence base at the site focused more on domestic animals and much less on hunting, trapping and fishing. However, since only 437</page><page sequence="472">CHAPTER 27 the Early Bronze Age deposits were systematically sieved, this finding may have been biased by bone retrieval methods. Although the sizes of the faunai samples recovered during excavations at Tel Qashish are small, the broad spectrum of species recovered illustrates the richness of the environment around the site. Due to the perennial flow of the nearby Kishon and Na'aman Rivers, it would have been extremely suitable for raising domestic animals, such as cattle and sheep, which require a stable water supply. Grazing for domestic herds would have been available on the slopes of the neighboring Shefaram, Iron, Menashe and Tivon hills, as well as the Carmel mountain range. Moreover, both the Zebulon Valley and the adjacent Jezreel Valley, which are extremely fertile and suitable for intensive cultivation, could have offered seasonal grazing for herds following harvest. Hunting and trapping of wild taxa could have occurred in the forests and Mediterranean scrub on the surrounding hills and wadis, as well as along the river courses, while fishing and collecting of freshwater resources took place in the nearby rivers. It is also likely that many wild species were attracted to the cultivated fields in the valleys, as these would have served as an accessible source of food.
