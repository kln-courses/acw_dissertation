MEGLIN Before she dreamt of her mission to create the American bal let in Chicago, Ruth Page traveled the world in search of styles. She was already a highly proficient dancer, having toured South America with Pavlova, performed as Adolph Bolm's partner in his Ballet Intime in London, New York, Chicago, and Buenos Aires, successfully auditioned for Diaghilev in Monte Carlo, and been appointed as ballet director of the Ravinia Opera Festival, just out side Chicago. On her way to ballet Americana in the late 1920s and early 1930s, this native of Indianapolis went through a number of choreographic phases that mirrored larger currents in American society in general and the dance world in particular. The time was ripe for a feminist, a liberated and cultured woman, and most of all a dancer to travel to Asia. Invited to per form a series of concerts for the coronation ceremonies of Em peror Hirohito in Tokyo in October 1928, she proceeded with her mother and father on a five-month tour of Japan, China, Cambo dia, Siam, Java, Bali, Burma, India, and, on the way home, Spain. Like a budding dance anthropologist, or at least an American dancer in search of new choreographic material, Page took dance lessons wherever she could, kept notes from the field on classes around the world, and had films made of dance performances and learning practices. Her meticulous note-taking is clear in a collec tion she published in 1984, Class: Notes on Dance Classes Around the World, 1915-1980} Sixty-one pages are devoted to "ethnic dance," thirty pages to the German modern dance, specifically classes by Mary Wigman and Harald Kreutzberg (selected from more than seventy manuscript pages), and seventy-seven pages to ballet, from a cast of stars, both internationally known (Bolm, of course, and Enrico Cecchetti) and local (a number of Chicagoans) .2 Page saw 439</page><page sequence="2">440 Dance Chronicle the study of dance from other cultures as essential to a dancer's education, helping the dancer to understand "what the human body can really express. "3 She recommended that the dancer "shop around" for teachers who could teach not only technique, but also "the expressivity we found in dance styles around the world." She herself had learned from teachers who were "the greatest living exponents of their particular dance style" or endowed with "the passion of a national ethos."4 Thus, Page had private lessons with Mitsugoro Bando in Japan and I Ketut Mario in Bali. She witnessed the Granada Gypsies in bare feet "dancing out their fire and passion on the hard earth of their primitive caves" before they had become a "tourist attrac tion" dancing on wooden floors.5 In spite of assumptions (perhaps extrapolated from domestic "melting pot" ideologies) that an am bitious young American dancer could learn with particular alacrity the dance forms of other cultures, she communicates a genuine enthusiasm and valuing of world dance forms. Still, the purpose of all this research in the field was to cultivate one's own artistic sensibility, range, and self-knowledge.6 That Page would then apply the cultural idioms she had stud ied during her tour to concert dances was inevitable. She learned how to manage the Japanese draping sleeves, kimono with train, and fan, and to stamp on a hollow wooden floor, and she was given a solo, which she performed in a solo concert as Japanese Print to original Japanese themes arranged by Walter Goodell.7 "Haifa dozen delicately tinted pictures," said a Chicago reviewer shortly after the August 15, 1929, premiere at Ravinia Park, "[were] made to move and live, but remotely and with the most delicate accent."8 "It was the first and last time I ever tried to be authentic."9 (Not exactly, as we will see.) Also entering her repertoire at the time was The Flapper Goes Oriental}0 If this dance was anything like the title suggested, it fused jazz (African American) and Asian idioms. Per haps it realized the jazz inflections the American dancer brought to her descriptions of Asian dance: cross-cultural comparisons to shimmies, shuffles, the Charleston, and jazz drummers.11 Like Ted Shawn, Page wrote articles on the dance of other cultures for magazines.* One in the June 1926 issue of The Dance, Page continued this practice throughout her dance career, at times playing the foreign correspondent for John Martin of the New York Times. Approximately one-third of her book Page by Page comprises articles written between 1926 and 1975 on "Dancing Around the World."</page><page sequence="3">Choreographing Identities Beyond Boundaries 441 well before her Asian tour, had a title designed to cultivate her reputation as an international dancer: "My Side of the Footlights: An American Ballerina Analyzes and Compares Dance Audiences on Three Continents," focusing on dance in three cities: Monte Carlo, Buenos Aires, and Chicago.12 Another, "A Balinese Rhap sody," appeared in the November 1929 issue of Theatre Arts Monthly, well timed for release in the same month as the New York pre miere of a solo she had prepared with a similar title.13 Two Balinese Rhapsodies, including a religious dance and a pleasure dance (a distinction also made in her article), was shown at the Chicago Woman's Club on November 1,1929, and along with Japanese Print on November 17 at the Guild Theatre in New York. Although the piece incorporated "original themes" arranged by Louis Horst and was performed in "authentic" costumes, a New York Times reviewer found it "devoid of style."14 Nevertheless, Page's written descriptions of Balinese dances are quite specific by anthropological standards of the day.15 Cos tumes and headdresses are described in all their intricacy, and a photograph of Page in Balinese headdress and earrings completes the assimilation.* Indeed, the uses to which Balinese art may be put by an American dancer are implicitly stated in a summary para graph: To me, all of Bali seemed like an orchid-haunted garden of dreams_I am tempted to say of Bali that its music, people, and flowers are imbued with a single enchanting spirit which haunts them all. And though I can recall quite accurately the days of my enchantment in Bali, to me their reality is but the outward expres sion of my dream.16 In 1932, to music by the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa Lobos, Page choreographed Possessed, a work that would later be set on Talley Beatty.^17 Film footage of this solo, with Beatty *A similar photograph sits atop the roster of coming events in John Martin's piece in the New York Times, "The Dance: Master's Work," December 8, 1929 (ProQuest Historical Newspapers). ^Beatty performed a solo, Canto Indio, in his Tropicana concerts (1949), which may have been Page's Possessed under a new title.

He swoops and turns, opposing leg and torso, extending one half of his body while contracting the other half. In the so-called "primitive" style of the 1930s, the dancer alter nates between taut suspensions and sudden snaps?thunderclaps of movement.19 In a commercially produced videotape on Page, Studs Terkel uses another clip of the same dance as performed by Beatty to illustrate the abstraction of emotion?"frenzied emotion" physi cally expressed20?for in the early 1930s Page's work had taken a decidedly abstract turn. In 1930 she had taken classes with Mary Wigman in Dresden and Berlin and in 1932 with Harald Kreutzberg in Salzburg. She also very likely saw them perform in Chicago, Wigman in 1931 and 1932 and Kreutzberg (with "Yvonne Georgi) between 1929 and 1932. Probably also motivated by the American moderns' works of primitive religious fervor, including Martha Graham's Primitive Mysteries and Doris Humphrey's The Shakers, and coached by Louis Horst,* she approached world dance idioms in a new way: as primitive templates with which to abstract profound, universal emotion. A second piece in this genre, Tropic, to music by Cyril Scott, invariably garnered good reviews in this country and abroad. Film footage of Page performing this dance outdoors at her Hubbard Woods studio shows her never leaving a blanket set on the grass with scrub as background.21 She wears an impressive Javanese mask, bracelets coiled up her forearms, and halter-top and legless pants designed by Nicholas Remisoff. The dancer's rooted, earthbound quality recalls Wigman's Witch Dance II or even a modern-day butoh solo. The torso thrusts away from the limbs, rather than limbs from torso, thighs open and close bracing against pelvis, arms wind in As modern dance's mentor, Louis Horst played a significant role in the musical choices and artistic stewardship of the modern dance pioneers. Page worked with Horst as her accompanist and musical director in this period and they shared an affectionate correspondence.</page><page sequence="6">444 Dance Chronicle Ruth Page in Tropic by Ruth Page (ca. 1933).

"R. T." of Dance Observer'noted in this work "a distinctive flow and succession of pat tern which capture and project the languid, undulating rhythms" assumed to be emblematic of the tropics; a mask that emphasized the "impersonal nature of this projection" (shades of Wigman); and a "remarkable fecundity of pattern invention."22 A critic, pre sumably from Shanghai, exclaimed, "One scarcely breathed as the sinuous figure, surmounted by a Javanese mask, packed deliberate fate and concentrated horror into each movement."23 Tropic might have been inspired by a passage from Lafcadio Hearn, whom Page had read in 1926 as she wrote a scenario for the ballet La Guiablesse: "This tropic Nature appears to call into being nothing ordinary: the shapes which she evokes are always either gracious or odd? and her eccentricities, her extravagances, have a fantastic charm, a grotesqueness as of artistic whim."24 Indeed, the dance seemed to evoke the thick, twisted convolutions of tropical plant life and un dergrowth. As is clear from these early solos, Page seriously applied her lessons learned abroad. One Ballet's Multifarious Makings: La Guiablesse and Lafcadio Hearn, William Grant Still, and Katherine Dunham La Guiablesse (1933) was in some ways left over from this period of foreign fantasy and primitive abstraction. It remains the most famous of Page's quasi-anthropological choreographies because of Katherine Dunham's performances in it and the eventual in clusion of the work in her own touring repertoire. The idea for the ballet was originally Adolph Bolm's, after reading Lafcadio Hearn's collection of travel sketches and transcribed folk tales of Martinique in Two Years in the French West Indies. Returning by ship from Buenos Aires in 1925, the story goes, Bolm got so excited by the material that he tried to persuade the captain to drop him off in Martinique.25 Shortly after, he asked Page to write the scenario and the African American composer William Grant Still to write the music. Lafcadio Hearn (1850-1904) was a journalist, novelist, and folklorist. Blinded and disfigured in one eye as a result of a child hood accident, he was shy, sensitive, fiercely independent, a flouter of convention, and a constant seeker of the outsider role. His biog rapher, Paul Murray, paints him as a global gypsy, driven by a quest</page><page sequence="8">446 Dance Chronicle for identity that would reconcile his divergent strands of Irish and Greek descent?a polarity that Hearn equated with temperate tropical climates and occidental-oriental cultures.26 There is no doubt, as well, that Hearn was influenced by nineteenth-century discourses of the fantastic-frenetic; he was a self-confessed "ghoul" with a fascination for the morbid and gruesome that ripened into a fine sensibility for the sublime.27 Hearn is most famous for tran scribingjapanese oral folk tales, but he was equally adept at captur ing the Creole folkways, legends, and ghost stories of New Orleans and the Caribbean.* He visited Martinique in 1887, publishing Martinique Sketches as part of Two Years in the French West Indies in 1890. Illustrated by sketches and photographs of various racial mix tures, dress, shrines, landscapes, and street scenes as well as musi cal examples of Creole melodies, it saw many editions, including a 1923 one, which was likely the one Bolm and Page read. In a forward to a recent edition, Raphael Confiant sug gests that Hearn was an early exponent of "multiple identity" or "creoleness."28 In Cincinnati, Hearn had married an African Amer ican ex-slave at a time when interracial marriage was outlawed there.^ Although this union did not last, his marriage to ajapanese woman after he had immigrated to Japan did. His writings also suggest that he was powerfully attracted to the progeny of racial mingling. Confiant credits Hearn with penetrating Creole wisdom "that the secret spirits of the countless thousands of Caribs and Africans who perished under European colonization are still pro tecting us, the Creole people."29 That Hearn respected the power of ghosts rings true with one of his most remarkable sketches in the collection, "Un Revenant." The essay begins with an allusion to Le Pays de Revenants, Martinique's nickname with a double en tendre: the country that beckons return visitors and "The Land of Ghosts."30 The revenant is Pere Labat, whose brutality and cru elty to slaves was legendary. Ironically, concludes Hearn, Labat's *In spite of Hearn's obvious attraction to black people and culture, Murray notes condescension in his writings, an identification with the antebellum South (he was an antiquarian at heart), and a belief in Herbert Spencer's evolutionary philosophy (social Darwinism). tAfter marrying Alethea "Mattie" Foley, a mulatto woman, in 1874, Hearn found himself "ostracised, tabooed, outlawed." The marriage seems to have cost him his job at the Cincinnati Enquirer. Hearn, quoted in Paul Murray, A Fantastic Journey: The Life and Literature of Lafcadio Hearn (Sandgate, Folkestone, Kent: Japan Library, 1993), pp. 45, 40-51.</page><page sequence="9">Choreographing Identities Beyond Boundaries 447 vicious persecution of African so-called sorcery won him a place in the people's pantheon of evil spirits. Hearn seamlessly introduces "La Guiablesse," the folk tale that supplied the pretext for Page's ballet, so that it seems to emerge from the very landscape. "In the North a tree is simply a tree;?here it is a personality that makes itself felt; it has a vague physiognomy, an indefinable Me, it is an Individual (with a capital I); it is a Be ing (with a capital B)."31 Tangled, grotesque, gnarled vegetation with the power to swallow up human beings easily translates into ballet scenery (capable of harboring "evil Personalities," in the words of the program).32 The She-devil of the title (guiablesse is a dialectic corruption of diablesse) is equally fantastic by virtue of her super/natural movement, as Hearn puts it, "a black poem of art less dignity, primitive grace, savage exultation of movement." He captures her snakelike carriage of the head in Creole and alludes to a serpentine walk: "with each long full stride, an indescribable undulation seems to pass ... with us only a finely trained dancer could attempt such a walk."33 The frisson of the devil-in-disguise of a female beauty concurs with nineteenth-century French Romantic sensibility, adapted so readily to the ballet stage. Indeed, Page's scenario evokes the sylph of the Romantic ballet, at least as indicated by the program notes for the ballet: "Though disembodied, she wails for an earthly love." The alchemic notion of sylphs as disembodied beings (elementals) seeking hu man hosts is tacked on to Hearn's original characterization of the She-devil/Zombi.* The scenario itself may be read on a copy of Still's orchestral score housed in the Music Division of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.34 Presumably writ ten in late 1925 or early 1926, it dramatizes a fantastic encounter between human and inhuman in a picturesque Caribbean market. Children are playing downstage center, while elders look on and converse idly. Yzore and Adou enter with a group of young couples and Yzore, a favorite with the children, joins their games. Now enter Les Porteuses carrying baskets on their heads filled with madras, fruit, and sugar cane. Buyers cluster around and haggle over prices. A love duet for Adou and Yzore ensues. Next, comes the ridiculous march of a mettlesome gendarme, followed by the parody of a mimic. The people dance a spirited dance. A prelude devoted to questions and stories about Zombis precedes the narrative proper of Hearn's tale.</page><page sequence="10">448 Dance Chronicle On an overhanging ledge La Guiablesse appears clad in a white robe, hair hanging to her waist. She pantomimes an eerie song. Descending a path with sinuous movements she feigns an innocent maiden for two young men, who wisely withdraw in fear. But Adou is unwise, as in Hearn's story, and becomes enthralled by her. When Yzore attempts to intervene, the evil spirit hypnotizes her. La Guiablesse sheds her robe, revealing a "bronzed body," in the words of the scenario, "bare except for a silver girdle about her waist." She dances a seductive dance and when Adou pursues her, remains just out of reach, sylphlike, and places a kiss on his forehead. He casts off the men who try to hold him back and follows the mountain spirit. Now that he has lost his way, La Guiablesse reveals herself in her true form: a horrible hag with the grimacing face of the fiend. Too late Adou retreats; the She-devil embraces him and he falls unconscious into the abyss. Two points are worth noting here. First, Page captured the folkloric spirit of Hearn's tale of the Martinican She-devil, even while reconciling it with ballet conventions. She did this in part by liberally borrowing from other episodes or sketches in the collection?"Les Porteuses," for example, and "La Verette." Les porteuses were the female carriers who carried large loads on their heads for great distances. It is the very first chapter that takes you into the interior of the country with the lithe walk, swift and steady, of one of these women: Six feet tall?strength and grace united throughout her whole fig ure from neck to heel; with that clear black skin which is beautiful to any but ignorant or prejudiced eyes; and the smooth, pleasing, solemn features of a sphinx,?she looked to me, as she towered there in the gold light, a symbolic statue of Africa.55 Meanwhile, Yzore is a character from "La Verette" who does not appear in the main tale from which Page derived the ballet. La verette is the pestilence that afflicts St. Pierre one carnival season, decimating the poor black population, which seems to be partic ularly susceptible to the disease. The real-life story is a Martinican version of Giselle, with young girls stricken by the disease, find ing it impossible not to dance and being carried off in the con tagion.

She dies, but not before one of her children has a pre monitory dream of a sinister ball attended by cardboard, hollow people. Yzore's childlike innocence lent itself to the ballet, provid ing a love triangle to render physical the metaphysical "La Guiab lesse." Likely, the pathos of this story, the climax of Hearn's col lection, also provided the seed for "Yzore's Waltz" in Still's ballet score.* The second point of importance is that Page wrote the sce nario, as delegated by Bolm, with the idea that she would play the part of the She-devil.36 Writing in early 1926, she conceived of her stage body as exotic, racially malleable, and beautiful through terms of "bronze" nakedness. On the one hand, bronze connoted a sculptural, statuesque quality; on the other, it brought to mind Bronzeville, the symbolic and cultural center of Chicago's "Black Belt" South Side. How Page represented Martinican identity in La Guiablesse would shift between the ballet's inception and its final realization, as will be seen. William Grant Still was rising to prominence during the Harlem Renaissance when Bolm approached him to write the mu sic for the ballet. Gayle Murchison, his biographer, sees Still, who grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas, attended Wilberforce University, played violin, oboe, clarinet, and cello, and worked as an arranger for W. C. Handy, as a "Harlem Renaissance Man," a composer whose work "reified the visions" of writers like W. E. B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, and Langston Hughes. Like Du Bois, Still grappled with the irony of being black and American?the disparity between democratic ideals and racist realities?out of which came a "dou ble consciousness" and, as a member of the "Talented Tenth," a sense of moral obligation to represent the Race and improve race relations. Like Locke (a friend and mentor), whose northward mi grating "New Negro" was exhorted to cultivate artistic products to help combat racial myths and stereotypes, Still was invested in African American idioms and how they might be incorporated into *But note also that in Hearn, Adou is female, the daughter of a woman who rents Hearn a room in a mountain cottage, while the mother is a storyteller who relates tales of Zombis in a prelude to "La Guiablesse." Who actually tells the story of the She-devil remains ambiguous; it emerges, as it were, from the countryside, a technique that honors its collective folk origins.</page><page sequence="13">Choreographing Identities Beyond Boundaries 451 forms that aspired to the highest artistic levels. Like Hughes, he considered not only spirituals but also blues and jazz as authentic and inherently valuable African American folk sources.37 Verna Arvey, Still's second wife, relates that itwas through John Alden Carpenter that Still met Bolm and Page.38 Besides being a fine composer, Carpenter was founding director of the Chicago Allied Arts, whose purpose was to give Chicago a ballet dedicated to the production of works of living composers, international in scope. In its three-year existence (1924-27), it was as innovative and experimental as its central collaborators?Carpenter, Bolm, Page, Remisoff, and the conductor Eric DeLamarter?and the only organization of its kind in the United States at the time. Carpenter was an early creator of ballets punctuated with jazz?Krazy Kat (with Bolm) in 1922 and Skyscrapers in 1926 (with Sammy Lee)?and in the same year he set poems of Langston Hughes to music. He thought Still a "very interesting talent" on the American scene.* Bolm approached Still, considering him the only composer who could capture the "subtle magic" of Hearn's prose and loaned him the book, earmarking the tale "La Guiablesse,"39 sometime be tween November 1925 and April 1926.^ The composer accepted the commission and proceeded to do research on West Indian sources, before deciding "to rely rather on his own invention and imagination."40 At the time Still was shedding the "ultra-modern" influence of Edgard Varese, locating his own voice, and deliber ately adopting a "Negroid idiom."41 Still wrote to Page on May 6,1926, noting that he had gleaned much valuable information from Hearn's book regarding "native customs, La Guiablesse, The Calienda, Bele and the drums."42 In deed, Hearn describes the caleinda and the bele as old African dances danced to drums, documenting their structure and man ner of playing as well. The caleinda, he says, "is danced by men only, all stripped to the waist, and twirling heavy sticks in a mock Howard Pollack, John Alden Carpenter: A Chicago Composer (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2001), pp. 382-4, 194-201, quotation p. 401. According to Pollack, Page's early jazz-inspired ballets with music by Clarence Loomis, as well as her later collaborations with Aaron Copland and Jerome Moross, also owed much to Carpenter's tastes and support, t If Bolm heard Still's mystical From the Journal of a Wanderer, played by Frederick Stock and the Chicago Symphony/North Shore Festival Orchestra in Evanston sometime in 1926, likely his instinct would have been confirmed. See Verna Arvey, William Grant Still (New York: J. Fischer 8c Bro., 1939), pp. 17, 48.</page><page sequence="14">452 Dance Chronicle fight."*43 Writing later, Page referred to "several dozen cane poles required for the action and the atmosphere" of the ballet, which suggests that Still's score may have incorporated such a dance.44 Still was likely moved by what later came to be known as "African re tentions," for increasingly in his music he sought inspiration from African American blues as a result of what he considered to be its pure African pedigree. In any case, Still's letter averred that Page's scenario would give him the opportunity "to write that type of mu sic which I know best and love?music of the primitive, elemental sort." For Still primitive meant elemental?essential, fundamental, modernist. In a letter dated October 8, 1926, to Thomas Fisher, an attor ney, secretary for the Chicago Allied Arts, and also Page's husband and agent, Still acknowledges receipt of a check for his compo sition and expresses his hopes for the success of the production. However, the demise of the Allied Arts the next year forestalled the creation of the ballet at that time (although not before Bolm, upon seeing the score, had suggested revisions, especially shortening) ,45 Nevertheless, the correspondence reveals something of the chore ographer's working process, as Still notes that he has been unable to locate the two men from Martinique with whom Page might con sult on the dances of that land. And a letter dated June 7, 1928, from Louis Horst to Page, stating that the musical adviser has "not yet stumbled across any possible Martinique music," suggests that the choreographer continued to scout out authentic examples.46 In 1928, however, Page and Bolm went separate artistic ways, and Bolm soon left Chicago for Southern California, sidetrack ing La Guiablesse, as did Page's travels to Asia and Europe and later her Japanese Print, Two Balinese Rhapsodies, Iberian Monotone, Tropic, and Possessed, as well as some early jazz Americana pieces. Meanwhile, in 1932 Still completely revised La Guiablesse. By this time he was actively engaged in creating what Murchison calls "the racial idiom," in writing "a history of African Americans in mu sic," and in depicting the psychology of the race.47 In 1930 he had written his African American Symphony, with the first move ment's principal theme based on the blues idiom reappearing throughout the entire work. Indeed, he considered the blues to *There are a number of variant spellings of the calenda dance besides those used by Hearn, Still, and Page, including calinda, kalinda, and kalenda.</page><page sequence="15">Choreographing Identities Beyond Boundaries 453 be even purer in African essence than the spirituals, although his works were often deeply spiritual. Other orchestral works?this was his medium?bore evocative titles: Darker America (1924), From the Black Belt (1926), and Africa (1930). He had also set poems by Paul Lawrence Dunbar and Langston Hughes and created an other ballet, Sahdji (1930), set in "ancestral" Africa, with a libretto by Richard Bruce and Alain Locke.48 Verna Arvey's biographical brochure on Still for J. Fischer and Bro., published in 1939 and considered to accurately reflect the composer's recollections and reflections on his own compositions, states with regard to La Guiablesse. "Still studied West Indian and Creole musical material, but finally determined to create his own themes as being truer to scene and mood."49 One may infer that Still reverted to the idioms of his own early experience?blues and jazz?to evoke a truer sense of the mystical island and its inhabitants. The first performance of La Guiablesse, on May 5, 1933, dur ing the Festival of American Music at the Eastman School and played by Howard Hanson leading the Rochester Civic Orches tra, was not choreographed by Page, but by Thelma Biracree, who performed the title role with dancers recruited from her classes in Rochester. A member of Graham's first ensemble, Biracree im ported Evelyn Sabin, also from Graham's trio, to perform the pas de deux of the lovers and "a typical Martinique legendary dance" of "the Cloud Maiden." The auditorium was filled to capacity and the composer was "heartily applauded." The reviewer for the New York Times found the music to possess "progressive dramatic interest and action," "incidental variety," and "lyric charm." "Something of the veritable atmosphere is attained on the stage, while the dance of the water carriers is especially effective."* This section of Still's score is full of life and open-air activity, giving the sense of the marketplace with its rich orchestration.50 Clarinet melodies weave their wayjazzily through percussive, brassy bursts and slides, cymbals coming in to cap the sound. One seems to hear the jaunty, syncopated stepping of individuals amid * "Rochester Hails Ballet by Still: Music by Negro Composer Is a Feature of Last Program at Eastman Festival," New York Times, May 6, 1933, p. 11.

The orchestration shows the influence of jazz bands?horns, woodwinds, percussion?against the back drop of strings, even as blue notes give African American inflec tions within a frame of French impressionist color. One imag ines the women water carriers winding their ways?each a unique portrait?through the variegated textures of a tropical town. The copy of Still's orchestral score, housed in the Music Divi sion of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, reveals several things.51 First, one sees numerous indications for the use of mutes?cup mute, straight mute, harmon mute, and "soft hats over the bells [of trumpets and trombones]"?and techniques like "flut ter tongue," attesting to its jazz orchestral elements. Second, one is struck by the conscientious rendering of Page's ballet scenario, which is typed neatly above the musical staves to coincide with key moments of the music. Comparing the score/scenario to a record ing of the music, one experiences the dramatic arc of the ballet. A set of compact vignettes?prelude, children's dance, Yzore's waltz, entry of lesporteuses, pas de deux, gendarme (a march), and spirited dance?provide the structural upbeat for the structural downbeat: an entree and sirenlike solo (cello and strings attenuated by harp) for La Guiablesse* segue into the finale and denouement, last ing for eight minutes of this eighteen-and-a-half minute ballet. The sustained climax, with Adou following the temptress up the mountain, and she, unmasked as the fiend, embracing him un til he tumbles into the abyss, is depicted in the music by esca lating themes (Yzore's and the She-devil's leitmotifs), dissonant sforzando clashes, falling glissandi, flutter tongue, tremolo, and rolling timpani. According to Arvey, Still inserted into the ballet, with few changes, an earlier piece (probably written in the early 1920s), the "Dance of the Carnal Flowers."52 Judging from the title of the piece, one surmises that he might have been inspired to do so by Hearn's anthropomorphic and spirit-filled descriptions of the Martinique tropical countryside. A program note for Page's ballet would also evoke Hearn's lush, impressionistic, ambiguous prose: Arvey notes that an opening theme (La Guiablesse) recurs throughout the ballet like a leitmotif and finally in a funeral march at the end; the She-devil herself appears accompanied by "an offstage contralto solo, a haunting, wordless melody" (William Grant Still, pp. 31-2). Mayble Roberts Walker sang in the Century of Progress production and the mezzo-soprano Maria Matyas in the Chicago Grand Opera production.</page><page sequence="18">456 Dance Chronicle The scene is an island where tropical heat incubates a world of awesome and vaporous beings. It is a writhing garden of the earth wherein the twisted rocks, the fleshy plants, and swaying trees are evil personalities which terrify the simple folk. Here sunset explodes with quivering colours that stupefy the mind; here a population of spirits disturb the night. Men are never secure. Even at dazzling noon stroll the most sinister of all?beings who work ruin with the appearance of beauty.53 Still's music caught this animated and animistic spirit, if the Chicago review quoted by Arvey is any indication: "It is far above the average ballet music ... both in quality of invention and in the value of its themes and imagination. It is a highly-colored, vivid, evocative, gorgeous score."54 When La Guiablesse had its Chicago premiere on June 16, 1933, at the Auditorium Theatre in conjunction with A Century of Progress, the Chicago World's Fair,* six weeks after the Rochester premiere, Page did something unimagined by Biracree. A note on the program states, "the Girls and Boys of the cast are drawn from the Negro Folk Play Group of Bertha Moseley Lewis, and the Children through the cooperation of Hazel T. Davis." This same folk-play group had provided "Members of [the] Negro Cast" for the Chicago premiere of Louis Gruenberg's The Emperor Jones with baritone Lawrence Tibbett (appearing in blackface), produced by the Grand Opera at the same theatre on May 2 and 5, perhaps sup porting (only six weeks later!) her decision to incorporate mixed casting and pursue racial if not cultural verisimilitude.^ She re membered an attractive young dancer she had met earlier through the Chicago dancer and poet Mark Turbyfill?Katherine Dunham. Turbyfill had envisioned Dunham as prima ballerina of a Negro classical ballet company and had wanted Page's assessment. Three The Chicago Friends of Music (with Carpenter on the executive committee) spon sored the series of Chicago Symphony Orchestra concerts associated with the Fair, including "Ballet Night[s]" upon which La Guiablesse, Bolero (Iberian Monotone), and Laurent Novikoff's Chopiniana appeared, conducted by Isaac Van Grove. TMoreover, the African American tenor Roland Hayes appeared here with Frederick Stock and the Chicago Symphony on June 15. Page astutely judged the cultural climate in Chicago.

(Page's memory conflates events here, since Beatty did not join the cast until the following year and Savage never did;56 nevertheless, her description of scouring the South Side reveals something about her approach.) Martin notes that by this time Dunham was studying anthropology at the University of Chicago and pursuing a career as a dancer in a unique approach, theatrical in style and anthro pological in conception.57 Dunham (1909-2006), whose ancestors were Indian, French Canadian, English, West African, and Madagascan, had grown up in Chicago and Joliet, Illinois, witnessing racial tensions among her extended family. According to Joyce Aschenbrenner, her bi ographer, the liberal, interdisciplinary, and cosmopolitan atmo sphere at the University of Chicago, and the holistic and human istic orientation of the Department of Anthropology in particular, provided a perfect environment for nurturing Dunham's talents, and Robert Redfield especially encouraged her unique direction, speaking about the relationship between dance and culture, as well as African retentions in dances like the Lindy Hop and the Cakewalk.58 Encouraged by her brother, she moved into Bronzeville, where she performed with the Cube Theatre, an ex perimental "little theatre" group. She also studied a blend of mime, acting, and ballet with Ludmilla Speranzeva, ballet with Bolm (Turbyfill's teacher), Spanish dance with Quill Monroe (partner of Argentina), and Balinese, Javanese, and East Indian dance with Vera Mirova.* Dunham soon began to teach dance, mentored and sometimes financially assisted by her brother, Speranzeva, Turby fill, and Page. A first group, named Ballet Negre, debuted at a Chicago Beaux Arts Ball, but eventually disbanded, and a second group called the Negro Dance Group floundered. It was still two years before her landmark trip to the West Indies in 1935, when she worked with Ruth Page on La Guiablesse. Like Page, she shared Vera Mirova had traveled extensively throughout Asia after fleeing the Russian Rev olution, and became known in Chicago as a fine interpreter of "Oriental dancing." As a young dancer, Page idolized Mirova and Speranzeva.

Talley Beatty described his recruitment for the 1934 revival of the ballet this way: "[I was doing] street dancing, like every body else, which was tap, soft shoe. In Chicago, I lived at 46th and Vincennes. Then Dunham had a studio [in a] carriage house at 48th and Vincennes [and] a friend of mine took me by ... they were doing La Guiablesse [for] Ruth Page, and she [Dunham] asked me to participate in it as a mise-en-scene ... extras, I guess you call them."59 Page and Speranzeva, Dunham's main teacher, helped her to obtain studio space, despite a climate of racial dis crimination, and promoted her career,60 as Dunham, in her own right, was becoming a force in Chicago. La Guiablesseproved a coup for Page. At the suggestion of the management, it was revived for the 1934-35 season of the Chicago Grand Opera at the Civic Opera House, where she now served as ballet director. As Page tells the story, she was immersed in the choreography for a new piece, Hear Ye! Hear Ye! to a score com missioned from Aaron Copland, and so asked Dunham to serve in her stead as rehearsal director and leading dancer of the ballet set in Martinique. Page wrote that Dunham "remembered every single detail," that she "remembered every step." Moreover, Page obliquely took credit for introducing Dunham to West Indian ma terial: "It is interesting that after La Guiablesse she turned more of her attention to the dances and culture of the displaced Africans in the West Indies."61 Aschenbrenner notes that Page was "not entirely accurate" on this score; however, praise from the critics for Dunham's performance in the ballet "did reinforce her grow ing sense that her mission lay in seeking out and presenting new cultural forms."62 Dunham for her part found Page "inventive."63 La Guiablesse could be packaged within Page's identity as American ballet impresario, as is clear from the weekly Chicago Leaders preview article on the November 30, 1934, concert (one reads the press release between the lines): "Ruth Page, besides being premiere danseuse and director of ballet for the Chicago Grand Opera Company, is also the only professional impressario [sic] of American training and activity who is giving all-ballet programs." The newspaper credits Page with libretti and pan tomime, and, somewhat ambiguously, choreography in all four</page><page sequence="21">Choreographing Identities Beyond Boundaries 459 ballets comprising the program. "Moreover," the article contin ues, "Miss Page has not hesitated to call to her aid dancers trained in other schools. Thus, she brings for 'La Guiablesse' Katherine Dunham and her corps of Negro dancers, both adult and juve nile." Here, likely "other schools" refers, in the specific sense, to Dunham's school, rather than, in the more general sense, to an emerging African American school of dance. But might there have been an unconscious implication of such a school? Yielding insight into Dunham's rising status, the article notes that she "became an identity last August at A Century of Progress, where she and the Mundy Jubilee Singers combined one night in a program of danc ing and camp-meeting songs that registered as one of the red-letter events of the summer in the Hall of States."64 A review of the revival in the Chicago Tribune, with the headline "Critic Praises Innovation of Ballet Night," waxed ecstatic about Dunham and her troupe of dancers: "It was an astonishing per formance, both last year and last night. The ease and grace that this Negro group put into their evolutions, the eloquence of their swaying bronze bodies, made a perfect performance of this tale of the Martinique siren, or Lorelei, or what you will."65 The Chicago Defender, one of the leading black newspapers in the United States, focused on William Grant Still, at this point a Guggenheim Fel low, who would be in attendance at the performance. Subtitled "Katherine Dunham to Dance Main Role," the piece referred to Dunham as a "dancer of fame and an accomplished teacher," not ing that she was "supported by a group of dancers of our own race." It indirectly quoted Still as saying that this was "the first time Negro dances [sic] have handled the pieces."66 Since African Americans had performed at the World's Fair the year before, perhaps Still was indeed referring to dances, rather than dancers, to Dunham's di rectorship and what he may have anticipated as African retentions in the movement. A photograph in the Chicago Times meant to promote the Civic Opera House performances shows Dunham as La Guiablesse hov ering threateningly above a kneeling Jordis McCoo (Adou), whose hand shields his eyes from her dazzling spell, while Frances Alexan der (Yzore) gently draws him away from behind. The tableau cre ates a sharply descending scale from skyward to earthward, the She devil being associated with the heavens and the good soul being connected to the earth, as if to evoke an African cosmology. The</page><page sequence="22">460 Dance Chronicle caption reads "HIGH POINT IN BALLET," names the dancers, and states that "La Guiablasse" [sic] will commence an "all-ballet series."67 McCoo wears a loincloth and Dunham wears panties, a halter-top, and a cape?bare skin and Dunham's feathered ankle bracelets are vaguely reminiscent of costumes in contemporary "black and tans"?the floor shows, flagrant sounds, and intercul tural mingling going on in South Side entertainment venues that attracted blacks and whites alike?quite a departure from what might be expected to open an all-ballet series, even if it was one of four ballets.* A She-Devil Crosses the Color Line: Ballet as a Ritual of Race in Chicago, 1933-34 While a photograph suggests that Ruth Page "blacked up" in one of her early solos (Bayou Ballads), indirect evidence points in the opposite direction with regard to her performance in La Guiablesse. Turbyfill's program note for the Auditorium premiere says, "Such a Being is La Guiablesse who, with her white deceit, comes to separate and destroy dark-skinned lovers" (emphasis mine). Such language could have been poetic license or even political sentiment on Tur byfill's part, but characterization that highlighted color differences would have not only been dramatic, but also evoked the ghost of the notorious Pere Labat from Hearn's book. One might also com pare the Hollywood construct of the light-skinned mulatto, for ex ample, in King Vidor's 1929 film Hallelujah, where the high yaller (light-skinned) Chick inevitably leads Zeke to self-destruction.68 It is noteworthy that in Cyril Beaumont's 1938 Complete Book of Bal lets, where the ballet's description is obviously an edited version of Turbyfill's program note, "white deceit" is changed to "subtle deceit."69 Conceivably, Page reviewed the material before sending it off to Beaumont and decided that with Dunham playing the leading role the original wording no longer made sense. The very fact of a white woman (portraying a villainess, yet) sharing the stage space with an otherwise all-black cast was radical *On this program Hear Ye! Hear Ye!, a ballet commissioned from Aaron Copland, depicted a court-room trial of a murder, which was reconstructed to take place in what was presumably a "black and tan." Gold Standard, choreographed to music by Jacques Ibert, also had its premiere, while Iberian Monotone, set to Maurice Ravel's Bolero, completed the program.</page><page sequence="23">Choreographing Identities Beyond Boundaries 461 in a society where segregated ballrooms and beaches, restaurants and hotels, theatres and restrooms were the norm. As a matter of course in the mid-1920s through the mid-1930s, blacks were pro scribed from participation in mainstream concert dance studios. In the early 1930s Talley Beatty, for example, had to take class in an adjoining room, outside the classroom proper, in order to study at a Chicago dance studio.70 However, another theatrical context bedevils La Guiablesse from the point of view of the present, the practice of white pro ducers exploiting black talent, which went into high gear in the 1920s. From Florenz Ziegfeld and George White, who bought and borrowed dances from African American sources, to Lew Leslie, who imported the performers themselves, revue producers prof ited from this practice.71 Thus, when Page imported dancers from Chicago's South Side, including Katherine Dunham and Talley Beatty, she was repeating another time-venerated convention. In "scour[ing] Chicago's South Side for black dancers, male and female,"72 she sought signifiers of cultural authenticity, no mat ter that the ballet originated in the folklore of Martinique. These signifiers would have been recognized by anyone familiar with Chicago's jazz scene in the 1920s and early 1930s, when this city was a hub of jazz. As jazz tremors radiated throughout the city, the South Side operated like a seismic center. Thus, a third per formance context? the "black and tan"?is key to understanding the received meanings of Page's cross-cultural ballet. The allure of jazz, its sirenlike call, was not unlike the She devil, luring men to unearthly limits of the exotic and erotic, at least from the perspective of balletgoers of the time. As David Lev ering Lewis describes the Chicago jazz scene in the 1920s, "the real jazz was still on Chicago's South Side"?it was "hot, loud, impro vised, and with more of the wail of the blues in it than its New York counterpart."73 William Howland Kenney remarks, "Chicago's rel atively freer interracial mingling in the clubs was an essential part of its reputation as [an earthier, more] elemental jazz city than New York."74 On the Chicago jazz scene the racial cordon between blacks and whites sometimes relaxed; the commerce of entertain ment lent incentives. Part of the attraction of these South Side establishments, ar gues Kenney, was the spectacle of interracial dancing going on? blacks and whites shimmying shoulders, rolling hips, and "getting</page><page sequence="24">462 Dance Chronicle down" in close proximity?on the dance floor. After the floor show, the space was yielded to paying customers, who imitated the sounds and movements they had seen earlier in the evening, performing a sort of racial pantomime.75 Given the fact that this risque per formance context was the only other site of interracial dancing at the time, it is safe to assume that Page's choreographic exper iment mimicked, albeit in a muted way, the real-life jazz scene, where bona fide source materials and dancing bodies were on dis play. The choreographer and impresario, whose theatrical savvy has never been doubted, sought to instill her ballet with this "racy" ambience. On the other hand, she probably viewed the collaborative ven tures of La Guiablesse as a gesture and sign of philanthropic race relations. Historical groundwork was laid here as well. During the Harlem Renaissance, there were frequent collaborations between whites and blacks in literary, musical, and visual art spheres.76 By incorporating a young South Side dancer named Katherine Dun ham, her troupe, and new recruits into the ballet, Page was acting like a talent scout across racial lines, not unlike Carl Van Vechten. Also of note during this period were the plays with themes related to African Americans and all-black and interracial casting, which achieved critical and box-office success. In 1923 Eugene O'Neill's All God's Chillun Got Wings premiered and The Emperor Jones was revived, both starring Paul Robeson. David Belasco's Lulu Belle and Paul Green's In Abraham's Bosom came in 1926, followed by DuBose and Dorothy Heyward's adaptation of Porgy into a play in 1927. The long run of Marc Connelly's The Green Pastures began in 1930.77 Finally, the operatic version of The Emperor Jones, first pre sented in January 1933 by the Metropolitan Opera with Lawrence Tibbett, which brought high praise to its African American chore ographer Hemsley Winfield and his company,78 may have clinched Page's theatrical venture into the Caribbean and her collaboration with Katherine Dunham and company. In this venture Page probably saw herself as in the vanguard of improved race relations. Her collaboration with William Grant Still certainly did not fall into the dichotomy of black talent pro jecting on stage and white authority operating behind the scenes in a creative capacity, or, for that matter, vice versa. At the same time her usual canny intuition in theatrical decisions was at play: a star white ballerina performing opposite an otherwise black cast</page><page sequence="25">Choreographing Identities Beyond Boundaries 463 would provoke curiosity; indeed, this was the aspect of the ballet promoted in advertisements. The gulf between the races provided a theatrical space for fantasy. The World's Fair performance con text for the Chicago premiere of La Guiablesse opened up the space for exotic concoction: South Side blacks, the jungle sounds of jazz pervading a classical music score, a tropical island paradise, a conte fantastique from Martinique. Many years later, in Island Possessed, her memoir about her trip to Haiti during 1935-36, Dunham remembered Page's cast ing of La Guiablesse. The young ethnographer, who had just fin ished her fieldwork, including undergoing a lave-tete initiation rite into Vaudun, was preparing a solo concert for Port-au-Prince society: I suggested to M. Charlier support by a corps de ballet of my friends from the Cul-de-Sac. I could see no reason why traditional material done by those most accomplished in its execution could not be presented at the Rex Theatre in Port-au-Prince if Ruth Page, then ballet mistress of the Chicago Opera, had chosen to rally untrained dancers from the south side of Chicago for group effects in her ballet La Guiablesse, in which she starred and in which I danced the supporting role.79 In a society of intense class segregation between blacks and mu lattos, the Haitian theatre management was strictly opposed to presenting these perceived amateurs from the black community. As Dunham was on the verge of formulating her essentially an thropological approach to dance theatre, her reference to Page's ballet in this context is intriguing. Does her comment conversely imply a greater participatory role than usually ascribed to per formers in the authorship of "traditional material" by the "rallied" African Americans from Chicago's South Side? Does it suggest as well a lesser authenticity in Page's production, which would pale in comparison to one danced by the very people depicted? Mar tin claimed of La Guiablesse that "the plot itself was less important than the jungle rituals and mating dances it gave rise to," hint ing that group scenes and dances were central to its success.80 Perhaps with Dunham and the troupe of African American per formers from the South Side, Page felt that she had somehow surmounted the basic problem and obstacle to the production of</page><page sequence="26">464 Dance Chronicle the ballet: lack of examples of authentic Martinique dance. For one thing, she had never been there or, the evidence indicates, found any examples in America. Likely, she reasoned that as close cousins African American idioms might serve. After all, this was what William Grant Still had done, mingling blues motifs and jazz orchestral techniques with classical form to create "primitive, ele mental" music. Meanwhile, John Martin's column in the New York Timeswoxxld have urged her to tap into native sources?Indian and Negro dancing?to forge an American identity in dance.81 When the ballet was remounted the following year on an all Page ballet evening at the Civic Opera House, the choreographer, out of practical necessity, went farther: Dunham was given the lead ing role that Page had danced the year before and also became the rehearsal director for La Guiablesse, while Page immersed herself in the choreography for her new ballets. She later reflected, "Imag ine in those days having an entire company of black dancers at the Opera House!"82 Eventually, sensing the impracticality of keeping the work in repertory, Page gave the performance rights to Dunham and her company. As John Martin notes, "The work, with its all-black cast, was not practicable as part of the opera's regular repertoire, but it was excellent for Katherine's own touring company, where it was a feature of her programs for several seasons. It was the first of Ruth's ballets to be taken over by another company."83 A clipping from one of Page's scrapbooks with "[Chicago] News" and a date of January 30, 1937, scribbled atop notes that Dunham and her dance troupe would perform excerpts from the "Page-Still ballet," along with "Haitian ceremonial dances," a tango, Falla's "Ritual Fire" dance, and "Tropics," "a series of impressions and realities" at the Abraham Lincoln Centre.84 Dunham seems to have been at an intermediate point, recently returned from her 1935-36 fieldwork in the Caribbean and still a year away from the premiere of her first full-length ballet, LAgYa, itself a magnificent fusion of forms set in Martinique. Page would go on to choreograph pieces that drew upon African American ambience (a court-room investigation of a mur der in a "black and tan" in Hear Ye! Hear Ye!, 1934), genres and dances (tap dancing and the Charleston in Americans in Paris, 1936), popular dance motifs and vocabulary (An American Pat tern, made with Bentley Stone in 1937), and subject matter (the</page><page sequence="27">Choreographing Identities Beyond Boundaries 465 well-known ballad for Frankie and Johnny, also with Stone, 1938). She worked with white composers (Aaron Copland, George Gersh win, and Jerome Moross) whose music was inflected with jazz tonalities and rhythms?urban and urbane without reference to assimilated cultural elements. The segregated stage practices of musicians and dancers fostered the sense of two separate worlds that did not overlap. In the 1930s Ruth Page both challenged and conceded to the status quo. The Arvey pamphlet makes a point of Still's mixed ancestry? African, American Indian, and Irish?and suggests that such mix tures comprise the true American: "The America of tomorrow will be even more of a mixture of races, of creeds and of ideals than the America of today. Moreover, because they will have progressed so far in each other's company, they will have lost some of their identities."85 Today we might say that we have gained some of our identities from each other. La Guiablesse was quite a feat of intercultural identities: a Martinique folk tale was recorded by an immigrant European American folklorist, envisioned as a ballet scenario by a globe trotting Midwestern female choreographer, given life as a ballet score by an African American composer with classical and jazz roots, and made into choreography by a process that blurred own ership between white choreographer and African American per former plus troupe. Each collaborator ventured into an intertex tual no-man's land?across the color line. For her part, when it came to making dances Ruth Page knew few boundaries of geog raphy or genre.
