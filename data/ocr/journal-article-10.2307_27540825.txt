<plain_text><page sequence="1">MALRAUX'S METAPHYSICS OF ART By JOSEPH FRANK Tout passe.?L'art robuste Seul a l'?ternit?. Le buste Survit ? la cit?. ?Th?ophile Gautier FEW books published in the present century have aroused more interest, and elicited more diverse reactions, than the succession of Andr? Malraux's works on art?first The Psychology of Art, then The Voices of Silence, and, more recently, the first volume of The Metamorphosis of the Gods. Everyone, to be sure, has paid some tribute to Malraux's coruscating style, epigrammatic flair, and esthetic sensibility; but this agreement about Malraux's gifts by no means extends to the works on which they have been lavished. Malraux's admirers tend towards a wholly uncritical and sometimes incoherent enthusiasm. His detractors, who include a number of our most eminent art-his torians, zealously pick holes in his documentation and regard him at best as a "charlatan of genius" (a phrase coined by Irving Babbitt about Spengler). In short, opinions about Malraux oscillate between adoration and apoplexy; and neither extreme really does justice to a great work of synthesis which, like all such works, is not without its blind spots and its deficiencies. One reason for this situation, it may be suggested, is that very little effort has been made to grasp what Malraux is really trying to say and what he has tried to do. Nor has Malraux m!ade this task any easier by his maddening penchant for alluding to ideas rather than elucidating them. But let us see, nonetheless, whether we can lay the foundations for a more balanced judgment by first endeavoring to disengage, as precisely and as soberly as possible, the conceptual structure of Malraux's key work, The Voices of Silence.</page><page sequence="2">JOSEPH FRANK 621 /. The Imaginary Museum The first book of The Voices of Silence is called "Le Mus?e Imaginaire," which for some unknown reason, in Stuart Gilbert's translation, emerges as "The Museum Without Walls."1 One would imagine from this that Malraux were talking about some open-air exhibition; but by "the imaginary museum" Malraux is ?f course referring to the photographic processes which have made available?first for the scholar, now for the public at large?the immense kaleidoscope of world art. No visual memory could ever have contained the impressions of so many forms, themes and particularly colors, scattered everywhere on the face of the globe. Photography has thus transformed the relation of modern man to his past, so far as that past is crystallized and preserved in architecture, sculpture, painting and the whole gamut of minor arts which, as a result of enlargement and isolation of detail, can now be studied with greater accuracy than ever before. But this transformation is qualitative as well as quantitative. For the pos sibility of seeing all the works of a great artist, or the greatest works of a single style, as a whole, gives us a new sense of the com mon quality in each and of the manner in which a tradition of forms persists, evolves and mutates.8 Technology, then, furnishes a necessary condition for the exist ^This is only a minor example of the liberties (sometimes wholly unjustified) that Stuart Gilbert takes with Malraux in his very free translation. On the whole Mr. Gilbert does a good job; but he has a disconcerting way of leaving out qualifying or amplifying phrases and clauses when they make it difficult to turn Malraux into "read able" English. I have used Mr. Gilbert's translation of The Voices of Silence, New York (Doubleday and Co., Inc.), 1953, but have altered?and particularly added?to bring him closer to Malraux in a good many of my quotations. Malraux's notion of the importance of the imaginary museum has been much mis understood. Claude-Edmonde Magny, in a perceptive but malicious article obviously inspired by antipathy to Malraux's Gaullism, accused him of wishing to turn world art into a "Buchenwald" where nothing would be left but lifeless photographs. It is regrettable that Etienne Gilson should have added the weight of his name to this in vidious charge. See Claude-Edmonde Magny, "Malraux le fascinateur," Esprit, Oct., 1948, p.525; Etienne Gilson, Painting and Reality, (Meridian Books), 1959, p. 379. It seems hardly necessary to object that such an interpretation is sheer nonsense. Malraux is not advocating a. program but trying to explore a fact of contemporary culture. Rather than praising or decrying its existence, he wishes to understand its significance.</page><page sequence="3">622 MALRAUX's METAPHYSICS OF ART ence of the imaginary museum. But contrary to the popular view, photography is not by any means the "cause" of its creation. To understand what this "cause" is, from Malraux's point of view, we must first highlight a central point about his whole approach to art. Like Hegel and Nietzsche, but in opposition to the entire tradition of modern esthetics, Malraux views art primarily in a religious or metaphysical perspective. Differences in style reflect differences in metaphysical Weltanschauungen-, and Malraux con stantly employs a fundamental dichotomy derived from Worrin ger's categories of immanence and transcendence. "An art that favors the earth" Malraux writes, "finds its greatest strength in its harmony with man; an art of the world of eternity and destiny, in its disharmony with the human." The first type of art gives us the anthropomorphism of the Greco-Roman style, with its continuation in Western art from the Renaissance to the mid-nineteenth century; the second, all the non-naturalistic styles ranging from the primitivism of Africa and the South Sea Islands to the sophisticated and elegant deforma tions of Egyptian, Byzantine, and Romanesque art. Each style reflects one or another type of communal response to the ultimate problem of la condition humaine; and for the greater part of the history of mankind, "art" in the modern sense was unknown be cause it had not yet been separated from cult and ritual. Only when "art" becomes a self-contained and autonomous activity is any museum possible at all; hence one cause of the imaginary museum is nothing less than the "real" museum itself. So far as modern culture is concerned, the idea of "art" as a specific value arose in the Italian Renaissance. But this idea was linked with the revived prestige of the Greco-Roman style, and with the realm of what Malraux calls "poetry" or "fiction," i.e., a repertory of mythological and symbolic imagery through which the artist projected his vision. Hence the Renaissance idea of art, in its rejection of Gothic and Byzantine, clearly lacked universality. And while the world of "poetry" it conjured up</page><page sequence="4">JOSEPH FRANK 623 was no more "realistic" than the idealized humanity of Greek sculpture, the search for verisimilitude in the Renaissance paved the way for the fatal identification of art with illusion and the imitation of natural appearance. Moreover, the art of the Renaissance was still in the service of religion. Even when this bond became looser and more secular ized, as it did very quickly, art remained in the service of the state. Whether a painter glorified God, or dignified the power of the ruling monarch, the importance of his art still derived from what it portrayed. "Until the nineteenth century, a work of art was essentially a representation of something real or imagin ary, which conditioned its existence qua work of art." The real museum emerged on the scene only in the eighteenth century, when art finally became detached from any religious or cultural extra-esthetic value. "For this concept [i.e., 'art'] to come into being" Mal raux notes acutely, "works of art needed to be isolated from their functions. What common link existed between a 'Venus' that was Venus, a crucifix that was Christ crucified, and a bust? But three 'statues' could be linked together." The creation of the real museum reflected this process of metamorpho sis by which crucifixes, altarpieces, commemorations of great events and symbols of power all became "works of art." But the real museum still imposed certain limits on this metamorphosis?limits determined by the hegemony of the Renaissance tradition. So long as this tradition reigned unchallenged, the very notion of a "work of art" was synonymous with the creation of a semblance of reality. Nor was the real museum broadened in scope when it began, in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, to include Byzantine, Romanesque and Egyptian art; for these styles were considered curios of historical interest, not rivals to the master pieces of the Renaissance canon. This situation continued until the rise of modern art, which reflected the artist's growing awareness of his change of status. 7</page><page sequence="5">624 MALRAUX's METAPHYSICS OF ART Such awareness, indeed, had betrayed itself a good while before modern art properly so-called arrived on the scene (Malraux dates modern art from the first important exhibitions of Manet). Delacroix, Constable and Corot, for example, all showed a distinct preference for the sketch over the "finished" picture?or at least for certain of their sketches, which were clearly not conceived only as the preliminary stage of a larger work. These sketches allowed the painter "oblivious of the spectator and indifferent to the 'realism' of the picture, [to reduce] a perceived or imagined scene to its purely pictorial content: an aggregate of patches, colors, and movements." Beginning with Manet, this dominance of the "purely pictorial" became the rule rather than the excep tion; modern art subordinated the whole realm of "fiction" or "subject-matter," which had ceased to have any real meaning with art's loss of function. Malraux thus defines modern art?in a sentence that has already become classic?as "the annexation of forms by means of an inner pattern or schema, which may or may not take the shape of objects, but of which, in any case, figures and objects are no more than the expression." By re-discovering the power of art to transform the world in dependently of verisimilitude or representation, modern art be came the chief architect of the imaginary museum. For the stylizations of the moderns showed that past non-naturalistic styles also created "works of art," and were not simply examples of cultural inferiority or deficient craftsmanship. No longer was it taken for granted, as it had been in the seventeenth and early eighteenth century, "that the Gothic sculptor aimed at making a classical statue, [and] that, if he failed to do so, it was because he could not." The latter half of the nineteenth century, guided by the experience of modern art, instituted a revision of all a priori theories of esthetics based on accepting one or another school of post-Renaissance painting as a norm. For when con fronted with Byzantine, Romanesque, Gothic and Egyptian art, "idealized faces, realistic faces, Raphael, Rembrandt and Velas</page><page sequence="6">JOSEPH FRANK 625 quez were all grouped together in one collective style, and against this the 'accents' of the newly found arts were calling for a totally new conception of art." This new conception ceased to equate "style" with the Greek or Renaissance tradition, and art with the creation of illusion or the search for "beauty." These are the schematic outlines of Malraux's theory of the imaginary museum, which, for any one acquainted with modern art criticism, is constructed out of fairly familiar materials. Mal raux's re-definition of "style" is precisely what Alois Riegl meant by his much-discussed and very influential concept of Kunst wollen, i.e., a will-to-art all of whose forms were equally valid expressions sui generis. Riegl's work inspired the scholarly effer vescence in Germany which led to a re-evaluation of what, from the Greek and Renaissance point of view, had long been con sidered "backward" or "regressive" styles. Nor does Malraux's analysis of modern art, scintillating as it is, offer anything star tlingly original. Roger Fry and Clive Bell had codified the lessons of C?zanne, Gauguin and Van Gogh in their theory of "significant form"; and so had the French painter and critic Maurice Denis, whom Malraux quotes (though somewhat inaccurately). Even Malraux's key idea of the "metamorphosis" of art through loss of function and the rise of the museum is probably developed from hints in the essays of Paul Val?ry and the important but little-known Walter Benjamin.8 Nonetheless, by bringing all these currents of thought together, Malraux creates a powerful and very original synthesis that strik ingly illuminates the historical situation of modern culture. Mal raux takes the universal relativism of styles out of the art # 'Benjamin's influential essay, "The Work of Art in the Era of Technical Reproduc tion," first appeared in French in 1936 and is cited by Malraux in a speech given in the same year. Benjamin points out that reproduction deprives a work of art of its "aura" ofunicity, which is linked with its value in cult and ritual; and he argues that this constitutes an epochal transformation in man's whole relation to art. But Benja min does not develop the implications of this idea, and goes on to discuss the movies and their relation to the masses. I do not know whether a translation of Benjamin's essay exists in English. The German original may now be found in Walter Benjamin, Schriften (Suhrkamp Verlag), 1955, Vol. 1, pp. 366-397.</page><page sequence="7">626 malraux's metaphysics of art seminar; refracts it through the experience of the autonomy of modern art; and then links both together through the key concept of "metamorphosis," whose effects are intensified and magnified by the imaginary museum of photographic reproduction. Only the combined influence of these phenomena can adequately explain the unique historical situation of modern man. Scholarship can? and should?help us to understand the metaphysical sources of style; but if we really could feel like the first spectators of an African fetish or a Byzantine Christ, it would be impossible, Mal raux argues, to endure their co-existence in the museum. All our knowledge of the past, however, is "filtered" by our experience as moderns?that is, by the experience of the complete autonomy of modern art from extra-esthetic values. Hence we are the first culture in history to have completely broken down the barriers between conflicting stylistic traditions, and to have achieved the possibility of making contact with the entire range of mankind's artistic creations as a totality. This description of the modern historical consciousness seems to me a definitive insight of permanent value, one of the few really original contributions to contemporary self-awareness. But whether, as Malraux also believes, it enables us to perceive the essential unity of a universal "quality of man" remains to be seen from the remainder of his great work. It is not difficult, how ever, to indicate at this point the major intellectual obstacle in his path. This obstacle is nothing less than the diversity of his torical cultures, and, more particularly, his own basic opposition between humanistic and non-humanistic styles. Modern art, to be sure, presumably dissolves this opposition by its "metamorphosis" of extra-esthetic values; but Malraux does not use this latter concept unequivocally. For the most part, it means the approach to past styles as "art," free from extra-esthetic values; not always, however. But though a Gothic crucifix [he writes] becomes a statue,</page><page sequence="8">JOSEPH FRANK 627 as being a work of art, those special relations between its lines and masses which make it a work of art are the creative expression of an emotion far exceeding a mere will-to-art. It is not of the same family as a crucifixion painted today by a talented atheist. ... A Gothic head that we admire does not affect us merely through the ordering of its planes; we discern in it, across the centuries, a gleam of the face of the Gothic Christ. Because that gleam is there. Malraux, as we can see, does not wish to surrender extra-esthetic values entirely (we shall understand why later). Meanwhile, let us simply note his oscillation on this crucial issue as the thread of Ariadne that will help to guide us through the labyrinth of his bewilderingly rich excursuses and developments. II. The Metamorphoses of Apollo Malraux's book is not composed in any strict order of expository sequence; and it may appear at first sight as if his second volume, "The Metamorphoses of Apollo," has very little to do with the first. Nothing further is said about the museum or about modern art. Instead, we are suddenly embarked on a vast survey of muta tions in style which ranges in time from Alexander the Great to Giotto, and in space from India and China in the East to Ireland in the West. But while there is no strictly logical connection be tween the first and second books, there is most emphatically a thematic one. Malraux has postulated that "style" is primarily an expression of metaphysical and religious values; and the whole of his second volume is a perceptive demonstration of this thesis. Also, the analyses here further illustrate the general action of "metamorphosis," i.e., the fashion in which one culture selects, filters and transforms what it receives from another in terms of its own values. Limiting ourselves to the major articulations of Malraux's argument, we can say that the first metamorphosis of Apollo began when the forms of Hellenistic art were brought by Alexander the Great to the frontiers of India. Here they met the religion of</page><page sequence="9">628 malraux's metaphysics of art Buddhism; and this produced one of the most remarkable events in art history. For the first representations of the Buddha were created by the Greco-Buddhist sculptors of Gandhara. It required the Greek spirit, as Malraux remarks, to breathe life into the figure of the Sage, and replace "by his bodily presence the vacant throne which until then had symbolized the Illumination." But these Greek forms were subtly changed, as time went on, to con form to the Buddhist sense of values. Buddhism is dominated by the "tranquil picture of a meditation. Thus, throughout the cen turies of the 'high' periods of Buddhist art, we find a gradual lowering of the eyelids, a tightening of the face that seems, as it were, to seal it fast upon the Buddha's musings." This Greco Buddhist art eventually travelled through India and China; everywhere it produced ever-new incarnations of the tender smile of pity at the vanity of human life which is the antithesis of its starting point?the Greek joy in the beauty of the human. Greco-Roman art was metamorphosed in the Far East by Buddhism; in the Near East by a Christianity which Malraux rather dubiously sees as more allied with Islam than with Latin Christendom in the West. Christian art, to be sure, began in the Roman catacombs; but there is no style of catacomb art. Here Malraux finds the concept of "regression" to be applicable, despite his constant search for positive value in styles diverging from the classical norm. It was only in Byzantium that Christianity suc ceeded in creating its first great style?a style in which man was again negated by the Eternal, as in Buddhism, but with a differ ence. "The spirit of Byzantium is all a fixed resolve to escape from the mirage of appearances and an aspiration towards a Nirvana in which, however, man attains God instead of submerg ing his personality in the Absolute." Malraux's remarks on Byzantine art, however, lack the precision and surety of his best pages; and one misses any allusion to the Neo-Platonic and pa tristic background, which is probably omitted to heighten the con trast between East and West.</page><page sequence="10">JOSEPH FRANK 629 Much superior are the chapters devoted to the evolution of Christian art in the West. For Malraux, the progress of Western Christian art is essentially conditioned by its apprehension of destiny as the unique burden of each individual soul. Greek sculpture had never been concerned with individuals, and Roman portraits are character studies but not biographies; they lack any trace of inner life. "Confronted with any prophet whomsoever, Roman patricians have the shut-in faces of prematurely aged children." Christian art in the West, for the first time in history, infused these forms with the unique stamp of sin, suffering and moral struggle. "It was the individualization of destiny, this in voluntary or unwitting imprint of his private drama on every man's face, that prevented western art from becoming like Byzan tine mosaics always transcendent, or like Buddhist sculpture ob sessed with unity." Romanesque art, compared with the Byzantine, already shows the first steps in this re-appearance of the human under Christian auspices?though the God who dominates the Romanesque tym panum is still awesome, and the ecstatic elongations of Roman esque sculpture aspire to the transcendent. But in Gothic we find the exclusive majesty of the Romanesque Christ now blending with the rest of the composition, and endowed with the emblems of earthly royalty as the Christ-King. God and man come to gether again as once before in Greece; and "once again sharp ridges were to disappear, draperies and gestures to grow supple." The Gothic artists did not imitate the classical style but they could understand it at last; and they put it to use "in the struggle with Byzantium and even Romanesque magniloquence much as, at a much earlier day, it had served to combat Egypt and Baby lon." The Gothic sculpture at Rheims has the calm serenity and dignity of the classical style; but its sacred figures radiate an indi vidual soulfulness unknown to antiquity. "The wheel has turned full circle and the smile was coming back into its own, winning admittance to the City of God."</page><page sequence="11">630 MALRAUX'S METAPHYSICS OF ART The culmination of this development is the art of Giotto and the early Renaissance. Malraux sees Giotto primarily in the light of his relation to Gothic sculpture; he even prints a detail from The Resurrection of Lazarus upside down to bring out Giotto's quest for three-dimensional volume rather than for perspective. Giotto took the decisive step in humanization by substituting psychological for symbolic expression, and by grouping the hither to unrelated Gothic statues into carefully composed dramatic scenes. Inspired by the spirit of St. Francis, he imparts to his best works an accent of "vast compassion" which for Malraux is "Christianity incarnate." "A metamorphosis of Byzantine paint ing in terms of Gothic sculpture, this art is no less a metamorpho sis of Gothic sculpture in terms of the new Christianity, which was to end up by destroying it." With Giotto the art of the Renais sance begins; his innovations revolutionized Western painting and started it on the search for verisimilitude whose consequences were traced in the first book. Hence at the conclusion of "The Metamorphoses of Apollo" we return to the starting point of the tradition whose secularization and ultimate loss of function was to lead to the rise of the museum. What is style? Malraux asks in summarizing the results of his inquiry. And the answer is that "painting centers much less on seeing the 'real world' than on making of it another world; all things visible serve style, which serves man and his gods." By this time Malraux has amply earned the right to his definition; but we must note that he has made no progress in overcoming the dualism of his basic categories of immanence and transcendence. On the contrary, he has now depicted the whole history of art as a constant struggle between these two fundamental forms of the sacred. Moreover, even from the very first book these categories had been associated with the values of liberty and humanism on the one hand (immanence), and submission to the absolute or anti humanism on the other (transcendence). "By contrast with the</page><page sequence="12">JOSEPH FRANK 631 cowering immobility of Asiatic statuary" wrote Malraux, in a typical passage, "the movement of the Greek statue?the first movement known to art?-was the very symbol of man's emancipa tion." Malraux's aim, however, is to prove that liberty is just this "quality of man" which emerges from the juxtaposition of all styles in the imaginary museum. And his problem, accordingly, is to turn the values of liberty and humanism, which historically have been expressed only in styles of immanence, into a universal category that can embrace styles of transcendence. This is the task he begins to undertake in his third volume, which turns away from style as a collective expression and focuses on the individual artist. 777. Artistic Creation Malraux's second volume has admirably succeeded in dissociat ing art from imitation?not only, it should be noted, the imitation of the world of appearances, but also the imitation of art itself. New styles are never the result of a passive assimilation of an old style (or a foreign one) which has been haphazardly "re discovered" or encountered. No style is ever reborn as it was, or taken over unchanged; it is always re-created in terms of new values that metamorphose it into new forms. The forms of classi cal antiquity had existed in plain sight all through the Middle Ages, but were not "re-discovered" until Christianity evolved to the point where it could enter into a dialogue with Greece. Indeed, one of Malraux's most original insights is to have seen this connection between the esthetic theory of imitation and the historical theory of "influences"; and he carries on a simultaneous polemic against the two all through his book. Both are efforts, whether consciously or not, to submit a creative response of the human spirit to the causality and determinism of nature?in the one case of nature as geography or "environment," in the other of nature as history. And this same effort, which has been all-per vasive in relation to the problem of style as a whole, has also taken</page><page sequence="13">632 malraux's metaphysics of art tenacious root in a stereotyped image of the psychology of the creative artist. In his third volume, then, Malraux returns to attack these same errors so far as they have crystallized into a false notion of the creative process. Simplest of all to dispose of is the obvious fallacy that any artist ever directly imitates anything that can be called "nature." For the vision of every artist is always oriented by an already existing tradition interposed between himself and a hypothetically "pure" visual experience. "We know nothing of what a great artist would be like who did not know any works of art, and found himself only face-to-face with living forms." One might reply that child art is an example of such a situation. But Malraux counters that precisely for this reason child art is incapable of de velopment: the child who becomes an artist must first master the forms of his tradition. Nor does Malraux have much more re spect for the popular idea that "folk-art" or naive Sunday-paint ing awkwardly (though charmingly) reflects what the artist "sees." A comparison of Russian Greek Orthodox and Polish Catholic folk-art, geographically separated by less than a hundred miles, instantly reveals the grip of traditional styles on the folk vision. And the style of le douanier Rousseau, the greatest of the "naive" painters, is incontestably a carefully developed creation which, as he remarked himself, was "the result of persevering toil." A more sophisticated variant of this theory links art with re ligion, as Malraux does himself; but makes art merely the in stinctive expression of religious emotion. This Romantic cult of "inspiration," which first arose in connection with Gothic art, has since been appropriated by the Surrealists and transferred from the cathedral to the fetish. It is not difficult, however, to un mask its implicit absurdities once we take it seriously. If "tech nique" means nothing and purity of spirit everything, then St. Francis, as Malraux notes acidly, would clearly have been a greater painter than Giotto. And how can we explain the con</page><page sequence="14">JOSEPH FRANK 633 tinuity of style in primitive arts if savage artists merely "express ed" what they felt? Why should they always "feel" in forms whose relationships have created the various clearly marked primi tive styles? Malraux traces the persistence of this inspirational fallacy to two causes. One is the hegemony of the esthetic theory of beauty or the imitation of nature. A style whose merits we recognize, but which belies our esthetic categories, is attributed to "inspira tion" because it eludes our conception of "technique." Also, we tend to confuse the level of culture in which an artist works with his consciousness as an artist. Obviously a primitive Negro sculp tor, or a barbarian designer of Celtic coins, did not exist on the same cultural level as Phidias ; but his works exhibit no less a de gress of artistic awareness and intelligence. An artist, then, does not begin by imitating "nature" or by giving free reign to his instinct. But what does he do? Malraux replies in a key passage, which outlines his conception of the truly creative artist?the inventor of new forms, whom he carefully distinguishes from the craftsman or epigone who merely carries on an existing tradition. A man who is destined to become a great painter [he writes] begins by discovering that he is more responsive to a special world, the world of art, than to the world he shares with other men. He feels a compelling impulse to paint, though he is well aware that his first work doubtless will be bad and there is no knowing what the future has in store. After an early phase of pastiche, during which he usually copies near contemporary masters, he becomes aware of a discrepancy be tween the nature of the art he is imitating and the art which one day will be his. He has glimpses of a new approach, a program that will free him from his immediate masters, often with the aid of the masters of an earlier age. . . . Once he has mastered one by one his color, drawing, and means of execution?once what was a schema has become a style?a new plastic interpretation of the world has come into being.</page><page sequence="15">634 malraux's metaphysics of art This passage, however, takes on its full significance only if we use it as a focus to catch the scattered rays of Malraux's metaphysics of art, which now assumes a markedly different aspect. For while hitherto the metaphysical value of art had derived from its link with one or another historical form of the sacred, we find Malraux here attributing such value to the function of artistic creation in itself. The artist, he tells us, begins by discovering that he prefers the world of pictures to that of reality; and this, whether the artist is aware of it or not, constitutes, in Malraux's opinion, a meta physical choice. For all art, as Hegel had also remarked long ago, is a reduction of the world of reality to one or another significance imposed on it either by the artist as individual or as representative of his culture. "Thus styles are significations" Malraux explains, "they impose a meaning on visual experience .... always we see them replacing the uncharted scheme of things by the coherence they enforce on all they 'represent.' " Life as a whole is stronger than man because implicit in it are chaos and fatality from the human point of view; "but, taken individually, each form of life is weaker than man, since no living form in itself signifies life." When he feels the attraction of art, the destined artist is inserting himself into the realm that endows the chaos of appearances with significance. Only from this point of view can we truly understand the passionate insistence with which Malraux hunts down every variety of theory that would confuse art with nature (whether as external nature, or as natural instinct). All such theories enslave the artist to nature, while art is born, Malraux contends, "from a desire to wrest forms from the real world to which man is subject and to make them enter into a world of which he is the ruler." The apprentice artist chooses the realm of freedom?not, to be sure, as the result of a rational, self-conscious decision, but as the effect of an irresistible passion. But while he may exist in a realm of freedom relatively to the non-artist, he "is born prisoner</page><page sequence="16">JOSEPH FRANK 635 of a style." Now begins the struggle to free himself from his masters?a struggle imposed by a new signification of the world which the artist feels obscurely germinating in himself, and which he knows only as a dissatisfaction with the already existing forms of his tradition. And if he succeeds in incarnating this new signification into a coherent system of forms, then he takes his place among the masters. The great artist, then, asserts his freedom not only generically but specifically, in terms of his personal conquest of a signification of the world; and he becomes a symbol for Malraux of the meta physical power of man himself to create a meaningful human world. "So far as he is a creator, the artist does not belong to a collectivity that merely sustains a culture but to one which de velops it, whether he cares about doing so or not. His creative faculty does not submit him to a fatality become intelligible; it links him to the millennial creative power of man, to cities rebuilt from the ruins, to the discovery of fire." It is in defense of this metaphysical value of freedom that Malraux rejects all efforts to "explain" a great artist's conquest of his style purely in terms of historical conditioning. Malraux's arguments have aroused a storm of righteous indignation among art-historians, who have taken his remarks as an attack on their discipline and have not hesitated to accuse him of intellectual obscurantism. This merely proves that people who carefully study works of art do not always devote the same attention to words and ideas. As a matter of fact, Malraux never denies the importance or the value of the historical study of art; indeed in some ways he makes it more important than do the historians themselves. For Malraux, the "historicity" of a work enters as an integral component into our esthetic judgment; it is only against the background of a style taken as a whole, or against the entire corpus of an artist's production, that we can truly gauge the new signification embodied in the greatest works/ *This is the basis for Malraux's interesting discussion of the problem of fakes. Why</page><page sequence="17">636 malraux's metaphysics of art What Malraux does argue, somewhat analogously to Bergson, is that the conceptual patterns imposed by the historian ex post facto, helpful though they are, do not adequately grasp the exis tential reality of the creative process. By confusing one with the other, we fall into the illusion of believing that the creations of genius are the natural and inevitable result of a particular his torical sequence, as if "values always produce their own art as an apple tree its apples." If a great work were suddenly to dis appear, however, it would be impossible to predict its creation de spite all our knowledge of the historical conditions in which it could come to birth. History, to use Malraux's formulation, calls forth a response from the artist but does not determine it; each artist responds to a different aspect of his time in terms of his personality (El Greco and Tintoretto were contemporaries, and both studied with Ti tian). But this does not mean either that the personal biography of an artist "determines" his response; nothing about an artist's life can ever account for the quality of his creations. The works of a great artist thus always preserve a margin of ind?termination and mystery?the mystery of human liberty that Malraux cele brates on a different level in The Walnut Trees of Altenburg.K And his third volume culminates in a veritable hymn of praise to the great creator, whose art presents man with the incarnation of his own supreme attribute. should a work hailed as a masterpiece one day be relegated to the junkheap the next if it is found to be a forgery? Malraux replies that,a once known as a forgery, the work can no longer be felt as part of a historical tradition of forms expressing a particular significance of the world; and the great work no longer appears as the personal conquest of a new variety of such significance. Etienne Gilson has objected to Malraux's view as^ too "literary" and "historical," and has written instead: "It is not true that the intrinsic value of a work of art, taken qua work of art, should be in any way affected by the answer given to the problem of its authenticity." See Painting and Reality, p. 94. Malraux's argument at least has the merit of trying to explain an observable and omnipresent phenomenon. Gilson's attempt to rule out all "knowledge" in determining "intrinsic value" strikes me as self contradictory. Without some "knowledge," how would we even know we were looking at a work of art? Perhaps the real answer to the problem lies in economics rather than esthetics; it is scarcity that increases value. But in any case, it is amusing to observe Malraux the novelist and intellectual amateur arguing on the side of knowledge and history, while the learned historian of medieval thought champions the purity of ignorance.</page><page sequence="18">JOSEPH FRANK 637 If now we compare Malraux's point of view in his third volume with that in the first and second, we become aware to what extent (and without any overt warning to the reader) his metaphysics of art has shifted its ground, "Within every artichoke is an acanthus leaf" he wrote in the first volume, "and the acanthus is what man would have made of the artichoke, had God asked his advice. Thus, step by step, Greece scaled down the forms of life to man's measure, and similarly adjusted to him the forms of foreign arts." The "humanization of the world" here is ex clusively the work of Greek art and its tradition of immanence; but in the third volume, this "humanization" has become the apanage of art as a whole. "Every true style" Malraux now writes, "is the scaling down to our human perspective of that eternal flux on whose mysterious rhythms we are borne ineluctably, in a never-ceasing drift of stars. Apollo, Prometheus?or Saturn; Aphrodite, or Ishtar; a resurrection of the flesh, or the Dance of Death." Malraux thus wipes out the distinction between styles of immanence and tran scendence, humanism and anti-humanism, by considering all art a reduction of the chaos of nature to a human perspective in dependently of the cultural values it may express. Far from solving his problem, however, this inconsequence only makes it more acute. For now the abyss of an unmediated contradiction yawns between his historical categories on the one hand, and his view of art as identical with the metaphysical value of liberty on the other. The problems posed by this contradiction are accord ingly taken up in the fourth and final volume; and Malraux attempts to resolve them in the light of modern art and its "meta morphosis" of the past. IV. The Small Change of the Absolute With his fourth volume, Malraux finally returns to the com plex of problems broached in his introductory volume on the imaginary museum. Earlier, Malraux had discussed the evolution</page><page sequence="19">638 malraux's metaphysics of art of modern art largely in terms of the esthetic revolt against imita tion?its rejection of the quest for illusion, and the triumph of formal schema over subject-matter. This had been linked with art's loss of function and its total secularization, but since Malraux had not yet established his theory of style as a function of chang ing crystallizations of the sacred, he had kept this explanation in the background. After his depiction of "The Metamorphoses of Apollo," however, Malraux could assume that he had firmly established his position; and so now he goes back to pick up the thread of historical evolution at the point where secularization first became clearly perceptible. This point is the definitive break of Dutch painting in the seventeenth century with the idealization of Italian Baroque. Dutch painting of the great period was the first style to abandon Christian iconography on a large scale, and to turn to subject matter that was totally secular and mundane. This was the his torical moment when the artist began to become alienated from his public (Rembrandt was the first peintre maudit), and when, as in Vermeer, we have those first intimations of a "pure" painting which has made the latter one of the godfathers of modern art. No one was yet aware, though, of what had really occurred?the beginning of the end of culture's age-old involvement with the absolute. Always in the past the waning of one religion had meant the rise of another; but this was no longer true. "The cult of Science and Reason that now ensued was not just another metamorphosis of the religious sentiment but its negation. . . . What is here in question is not the form assumed by a religion, but that impulse of the soul which wrests man from his life on earth and unites him with the Eternal." Western culture was thus losing its relation with any supreme metaphysical or religious value; and without such a value, which forms the basis for spiritual communion among men, no true cul ture is possible. But this loss was masked for two hundred years, first by the deification of Reason in the eighteenth century (which</page><page sequence="20">JOSEPH FRANK 639 gave men a new Gospel around which to rally, and led to Robes pierre's cult of a Supreme Being), and then by the exalted po litical hopes of the nineteenth. "Modeled no less than the gods of Greece on human values (though on very different lines), the political deity of the nineteenth century stepped into the place of the God of the Jesuits." The triumphant bourgeoisie, however, did not bring any values with it except secular ones. And while the bourgeoisie had triumphed in the past?in Holland, in Flan ders and the Florence of the Medicis?this was the first time it had done so in a world that had lost all metaphysical coherence. No one felt this loss more acutely than the artist, whose func tion had always been to express the highest values of his culture. And when the bourgeoisie demanded an art of delectation, amuse ment or servile flattery, subject to no order of supreme values, the true artist refused to truckle to this debasing demand. In stead, we get the break between the artist and society which is one of the most striking and unprecedented aspects of modern culture. With Manet, C?zanne and Impressionism, this break was at first only a rejection of the confusion of art with illustra tion; but with Gauguin, Van Gogh and the whole development of modern art leading up to Picasso, it became an attack on modern culture. This culture was one in which, as in the Hellenistic period of the ancient world, a metaphysical humanism had lost its religious impetus and was running out into the sands of sensualism and self-indulgence. And the modern artist reacted by rejecting humanism in all its forms, bringing back to life instead all the styles of transcendence in which man had either been denied or negated. Malraux had argued, in his first volume, that the imaginary museum potentially places us in contact with world art as a whole; but he now recognizes that, under the influence of modern art, it has been oriented in the direction of "a barbaric Renaissance." No art that bears the stamp of humanism or civilized refinement really appeals to our sensibility; it is all the others that we hang 8</page><page sequence="21">640 malraux's metaphysics of art in a place of honor. And along with these anti-humanistic styles, we are once more becoming susceptible to the values that brought them to birth. "Many of our resuscitations" writes Malraux, "call into question not only painting as we know it, but man as he is today." What has been called into question is the optimism and rationalism, the belief in science and progress, the refusal to face the ineluctable truth of man's fate which marked the nine teenth century. To challenge these dogmas modern art has revital ized all styles which contain either a streak of the diabolic or a spark of the divine; and more the former than the latter. Indeed, the spectre of modern art hangs over a Europe which has lost faith in itself and its time-honored humanistic concept of Man. The conflict between Malraux's metaphysics of art and his historical categories thus re-appears dramatically within the con text of the problem of modern art and modern culture. More over, it re-appears in a form that seems to land Malraux in a hope less impasse. For how can he continue to identify artistic creation with the metaphysical value of liberty, when modern art?the most liberated that the world has ever known?has only used this liberty to revive the anti-humanism of styles of transcendence? Is not Malraux's own analysis of the meaning of modern culture a refutation of his attempt to make artistic creation a wellspring of metaphysical humanism? At this point Malraux the thinker ir resistibly reminds us of one of the heroes of his own novels, facing the dark threat of fate and destruction and striving to assert the dignity of man in the teeth of everything that grinds him to dust. And just as his heroes rise to the full splendor of their humanity only at this moment of crisis, so Malraux gathers together all the conceptual strands of his book to confront the dilemma that he has stated so forcefully and so candidly. V. The Two Metamorphoses Malraux's solution is carried through by means of the concept of metamorphosis?but only a constant overlapping of the two</page><page sequence="22">JOSEPH FRANK 641 uses that we have distinguished. Sometimes Malraux stresses the divorce of modern art from all extra-esthetic values, which allows us to metamorphose past cultural antagonisms into one uni versal "language." Whether originally savage, humanistic, or transcendental, all past styles have now become metamorphosed into so many systems of esthetic forms. "Provided we have art, not culture, in mind, the African mask and Poussin, the ancestor and Michelangelo, are seen to be not adversaries, but polarities." It is easy to understand, however, why Malraux could not rest content with this solution. For one thing, it fails to explain the orientation of modern art toward styles of transcendence. If all styles are only purely formal systems, why should the modern sensibility prefer one system over another? And even more important, this metamorpho sis of styles into "forms" would undermine the very metaphysical value that Malraux wishes to attribute to art?a value that derives historically from the connection of art with the sacred. By strip ping art of all extra-esthetic value, Malraux overcomes the dual ism of his historical categories; but he turns his metaphysics of art into a gratuitous assertion without any real support. To support his metaphysics Malraux has recourse to the alter nate significance of "metamorphosis," which then leads him to a much more subtle and profound view of modern art. Far from being merely the assertion of the hegemony of technique over theme, form over content, modern art is now seen as controlled by a fundamental extra-esthetic value. "For there is a funda mental value of modern art," Malraux asserts, "and one that goes far deeper than a mere quest of the pleasure of the eye. Its an nexation of the visible world was but a preliminary symptom of the ancient desire for an autonomous world for the first time re duced to itself." Modern art thus re-affirms art's age-old relation to the sacred, without, however, possessing any positive version of the sacred to express; it insists on continuing to exercise a</page><page sequence="23">642 MALRAUX^ METAPHYSICS OF ART metaphysical function, although deprived by modern culture of any religious substance. Styles of transcendence have always expressed art's relation to the sacred most forcibly; and this explains the paradox of modern art, which unites the utmost freedom of the artist with his preference for styles in which freedom has been negated. "Akin to all styles that express the transcendental and unlike all others, our style seems to belong to some religion of which it is unaware. Yet it owes its affinity with the former not to the ex pression of faith in an unseen world, but, rather, to the absence of such faith, and is as it were a photographic negative of the styles of the transcendent." In modern art, freedom becomes an at tribute of styles of transcendence; it is modern art that reconciles Malraux's metaphysics and his historical categories. By projecting this reconciliation of modern art back onto the past, Malraux arrives at the most brilliant single stroke of con ceptual intuition in the entire book. Modern art has revived our sense of art's relation to the sacred per se, without committing us to any of its historical forms; nor does its latent anti-humanism negate the individual freedom of artistic creation. Hence it en ables us to appreciate sympathetically the values of all the spirit ual communions of the past. And we see their art, on the analogy of our own, as differing but essentially related responses of human freedom and creativity to the eternal question of man's fate. For since the great languages of the past reach us only by way of a metamorphosis, they are no longer the original languages; each masterwork, in transmitting one of these languages, gives us the impression that this was the language of a single artist, unique creator of all the spiritual values he expresses. Though we know that behind a Khmer head lie centuries of Buddhism, we look at it as if its spirituality and complexity must have been the invention of its maker. It con veys to us a 'relativised absolute.' In short, we look at great</page><page sequence="24">JOSEPH FRANK 643 works of the remote past?whether their purpose be cosmic, magical, religious or transcendental?as so many Zarathus tras invented by so many Nietzsches. In other words, we do not feel past styles primarily as products of conflicting cultural traditions?any more than we feel Van Gogh and Matisse to be mutually exclusive despite the clashing spiritual worlds in which they live. On the contrary, we unite them both as differing expressions of creative freedom; and, in Malraux's opinion, we do the same with the art of the past. The absolutes of history have become "relativized" into symbols that retain their expressive significance as confrontations with the sacred; but the conflict between such modes recedes before our apprehension of the liberty of the creative process. "In ceasing to subordinate creative power to any supreme value, modern art has brought home to us the presence of that creative power throughout the whole history of art." It is in the light of this latter metamorphosis that we must understand Malraux's cryptic but extremely suggestive conclud ing remarks on the philosophy of history. Malraux, it should be stressed, does not believe anything as puerile as that art "frees" man from time or history; he ridicules this very popular pseudo prof oundity in The Walnut Trees of Altenburg and he explicitly says the opposite in The Voices of Silence. "Art does not deliver man from being only an accident in the universe" he emphasizes, "but it is the soul of the past in the sense in which each ancient religion was the soul of the world." Religion, by defending man 5In the famous^ colloquy at Altenburg, Count Rabaud says: ". . . the great artist, gentlemen, establishes the eternal identity of man with himself. By the manner in which he depicts such and such an action of Orestes or Oedipus, of Prince Hamlet and the Karamazov brothers, he brings close to us those destinies otherwise so distant in space and time; he renders them fraternal and revelatory. Thus certain men possess this great privilege, this divine spark, of finding within the depths of themselves? and presenting it to us as a gift?that which delivers us from space, time and death." The narrator, who speaks for Malraux, comments ironically on this position: "The idea he had just developed, subtly banal, was then popular among a good many intel lectuals." This idea is then rejected in the course of the debate as inadequate to the tragic reality of the human condition. See The Walnut Trees of Altenburg, Part II, Ch. iii.</page><page sequence="25">644 malraux's metaphysics of art against destiny, had formerly given a soul to the world. But modern culture has no religion; and destiny, too, has now assumed a new guise. "Whenever becoming or fatality usurps the place of being, history usurps that of theology"; it is history which has become the destiny of modern man, who no longer sees himself in the perspective of any religious eternity but exclusively in that of time. Destiny has become the Hegelian intuition of history as an all-engulfing and all-destroying process which, once divorced from Hegel's belief in the Absolute as Spirit and hence as free dom, has culminated in Spenglerian pessimism and in the various other types of historical determinism that rule the modern con sciousness. Against this background, the metamorphosis of the imaginary museum takes on an extraordinary importance. For in Malraux's opinion, this metamorphosis enables us to feel all the great cul tures of the past as symbols of a creative power which continues to exist in our own day, and which testifies to the ability of man to create a world of human values asserting his spiritual autonomy. Malraux has been consistently misinterpreted to mean that the mere survival of works of art somehow accomplishes this feat; but since a good many things besides works of art have survived from the past, this reduces Malraux's thought to banality. Art occupies a privileged place because, unlike an ordinary artifact, it bears the impress of man's encounter with the sacred; because we can experience this encounter directly, without the necessity of the translation or erudition required by literature; and because the metamorphosis of the past by modern art enables us to transform this experience into that of human liberty defend ing itself against destiny. Hence art allows us to confront his torical relativism on its own terms and, while accepting its conclus ions, to turn them into a source of inspiration rather than of de spair. In this sense modern culture is heir to all the ages?"not so much of this or that value in particular (or of each and all) as of something that runs deeper: that under-current of the stream</page><page sequence="26">JOSEPH FRANK 645 of human consciousness which brought them into being." All art is thus, as Malraux writes, "an anti-destiny." It has become the "soul" of a modern world which accepts no absolute other than history and time, but which, if it is to continue to survive, must struggle to preserve its faith in the creative power of human liberty. VI. The Quality of Man Malraux's Voices of Silence is such a grandiose and impressive achievement, it is conceived on so majestic a scale and carried through with such mastery and brio, that one's first reaction can only be an admiration that far outweighs all criticism or reserva tions. Nor is this reaction belied after the first impact has begun to wear off. Not since Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy has there been any work on art which can even remotely begin to compare with Malraux's; only its great predecessor combines such depth with such range, or unites so passionate a sympathy for the modern with so penetrating an understanding of the past. And the comparison of Malraux with Nietzsche can be extended a good deal further. Nietzsche wished to sweep away all merely "esthetic" interpre tations of Greek tragedy so as to re-establish its relation to the religious and the sacred; and Malraux does the same for the entire realm of the plastic arts. Wagner's music-drama provided the contemporary point of departure for Nietzsche's reflections, while Malraux starts from modern art and the esthetic of Post Impressionism; and where Nietzsche exploited the fruits of a half-century of German classical scholarship, Malraux utilizes the efforts which two generations of art-historians have devoted to the study and re-evaluation of transcendental styles. Finally, both writers are concerned with the problem of the nature of art primarily as a clue to the more important question of the con dition of modern culture. But while Nietzsche, at the time he wrote The Birth of Tragedy, saw hope for the future only in the</page><page sequence="27">646 malraux's metaphysics of art re-awakening of the German spirit by the metaphysical pro fundity of Wagnerian music, Malraux sees modern art as the herald of a universal humanism founded on the metaphysical dignity of man as creator. Nietzsche's uncovering of the Dionysian roots of Greek tragedy has become one of the permanent acquisitions of modern culture; and the same, we may predict, will prove true for Malraux's in terpretation of the significance of modern art. By placing the adventure of modern art in the context of the millennia of history, Malraux illuminates its problems in a remarkably original fashion. For while modern art has hitherto been considered the most radi cal break ever made with tradition, Malraux reveals it to be, on the contrary, an unprecedented effort to restore art's immemorial link with the sacred in a desacralized world. The usual views of modern art are that it either tries to incar nate the visually paradoxical theories of modern science, or to explore the irrational depths of the psyche. Both explanations are related, as we can see, by the effort to penetrate beyond the surface world to some underlying principle that supports and sustains the visible. Etienne Gilson has acutely spoken of abstract art, with its acknowledged theosophical roots, as an invasion of art by the ancient spirit of Pythagorean mathematical mysticism; and the same mysticism is evident in the exploration of the self, which becomes the vehicle through art for man's contact with the abso lute. Malraux's theory provides a common category for both interpretations, and places them in a definitive historical per spective. "In this context" he writes, "the religious vocabulary may jar us; but unhappily we have no other. Though this art is not a god, but an absolute, it has, like a god, its fanatics and its martyrs and is far from being an abstraction." Does Malraux, however, really succeed in overcoming the opposition between his metaphysics of art and his historical cate gories? How convincing are his final arguments, which we have presented without any criticism? To answer this question we must</page><page sequence="28">JOSEPH FRANK 647 make a distinction, which Malraux regrettably never makes him self, between the view that all art is a human response; and the related, but not identical, claim that we experience all these re sponses throughout the whole range of world art as equal expres sions of man's freedom. It is certainly true, as Malraux points out, that the combined influence of modern art and art history has taught us to see all styles as human responses. None are relegated any longer to the realm of merely instinctual barbarism or savagery; all are felt as expressions of values. But it does not follow that we have ceased to feel the differences between the values expressed in styles of transcendence from those expressed in styles of immanence. This is the point at which Malraux tries to prove too much, and where, in my opinion, his thesis ultimately breaks down. It may well be that this breakdown is concealed from Malraux himself because of the ambiguity in his idea of metamorphosis. For if all the art of the past were metamorphosed into "esthetic forms," then, as we have already noted, it would be true that we could feel them all as an undifferentiated unity; but this unity would have no metaphysical value because the forms would not endow nature with any "significance." On the other hand, once Malraux concedes that we feel the metaphysical quality of past cultures in their styles (and this position is not only necessary for his argument, but certainly corresponds far more closely to the facts), then he re-introduces the felt disparity between humanistic and non-humanistic styles that he wished to eliminate. To get around this difficulty Malraux occasionally implies that the masterpiece somehow conveys man's creative power in a pure state: but this contention cannot be taken seriously. Even a work of genius comes to us as a particular historical incarnation, which expresses a certain level of cultural development and a certain type of response to destiny. "If an art associated with the most hideous sacrifices holds our interest" Malraux asks, "is this be cause of the glimpses it gives us of a world of elemental chaos?</page><page sequence="29">648 malraux's metaphysics of art Or is it, rather, for its expression of man's ability to escape from chaos, even though the way of escape lies through blood and dark ness?" We can follow Malraux in choosing the second alternative to this question, without agreeing to his unconvincing corollary that such an art ranks with the classical Greek as an expression of man's freedom. One has the feeling that Malraux drives his argument to this extreme only because his two meanings of meta morphosis keep blending into each other, and he never really succeeds in disentangling all their divergent implications. Malraux ultimately fails, then, to dissolve the disparate quali ties of historical cultures and their styles into the universal ap prehension of the liberty of the creative act. But this by no means invalidates his major argument as a whole; it merely shows that he has been trying to perform an impossible task. What he has done is to prove that all art, to use Ernst Cassirer's term, is a universal "symbolic form"; and perhaps the best way to evaluate Malraux's achievement is to compare his main thesis with the startlingly similar one of the greatest modern philosophers of cul ture. "Every authentic function of the human spirit" Cassirer has written, "has this decisive characteristic . . . [that] it does not merely copy but rather embodies an original formative power. It does not express passively the mere fact that something is present, but contains an independent energy of the human spirit through which the simple presence of the phenomenon assumes a definite meaning, a particular ideational content. This is as true of art as it is of cognition; it is as true of myth as of religion."0 No better definition could be given of Malraux's central concept of "style"; and it may not be too fanciful to suggest that, probably without any knowledge of Cassirer's The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, Malraux has nonetheless added a fourth volume on art to Cassirer's three on language, myth and cognition. However that 8Ernst Cassirer, The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, New Haven (Yale University Press), 1953, Vol. 1, p. 78.</page><page sequence="30">JOSEPH FRANK 649 may be, Malraux certainly shows us man everywhere behaving not only as a symbolic but also as a metaphysical animal, eternally confronting the problem of destiny with a world of values of his own creation. Malraux's mistake, however, was in wishing to press this functional unity of the spirit too far, and to turn it into the sub stantial or ontological unity of a universal "quality of man" (though Malraux's position is even more complicated because he appears to recognize that such an ontological unity is an historical "myth," arising only as a result of the metamorphosis of the past by modern art). But no such ontological unity can be asserted if, like Cassirer and Malraux, one honestly faces the enormous range of man's historical diversity rather than indulging in the currently fashionable Existentialist sport of postulating pseudo universal categories. Schooled in the intricacies of Kantian specu lation, and far more aware of this pitfall, Cassirer limits himself carefully to asserting only a functional unity, and grapples su perbly with the formidable task of tracing the various stages of development within each of the great cultural forms. Malraux, it seems to me, could well have done the same with out contradicting the true logic of his fundamental position. For to recognize that the human spirit has been more or less free in the course of its history, and that art expresses its temporary de feats and abdications as well as its victories, does not cancel out the qualitative separation of the spirit from nature or the impos sibility of explaining its creations as the product of purely natural or non-human causes. But Malraux refuses to admit any overt principle of cultural evolution in his book?perhaps because he felt too acutely the danger of implying that a humanistic culture would necessarily produce an esthetically more valuable style. Or perhaps, just as he finds it impossible in his novels to represent any character who is basely and inhumanly evil (a point per ceptively noted by Claude-Edmonde Magny), so in his thought he instinctively refuses to acknowledge that the "quality of man"</page><page sequence="31">650 malraux's metaphysics of art has not always been equal to the highest potentialities of his free dom. There are certain failures which, by their very magnitude, dwarf any number of smaller and more timid successes; and after all the objections have been made to The Voices of Silence, the first im pression of a towering achievement still remains the only adequate response. Malraux has incontestably written one of the great re affirmations of humanism in our time?a re-affirmation all the more valuable because it breaks through the bounds of the Greco Roman tradition from which humanism sprang, and attempts to endow its ideals with universal meaning. Like Freud, Thomas Mann and Cassirer, Malraux has refused to surrender the ideal of man inherited both from the classical tradition and the eighteenth century Enlightenment; but he has tried to widen and deepen this ideal by overcoming its opposition to the primitive, the irrational and the nominally anti-human. Freud gave us a new understanding of the dream, the uncon scious and the sexual; Mann projected a "dream poem of hu manity" that would synthesize the Dionysian and the Apollonian; Cassirer extended Kantian categories, derived from the episte mology of the natural sciences, to the irrational realms of lang uage and myth; and Malraux struggles to show us man affirming his humanity in the fetish, the painted trophy of the head-hunter, and the grinning death mask of the Aztec crystal skull. No more important task could possibly be undertaken in our time, when Heidegger has denied the value of even attempting to restore the ancient lustre of the word "humanism" and Sartre has appropri ated it for a philosophy in which ethics is declared an impossibility. If we are to look anywhere in modern culture for a truly great expression of an Existentialist humanism outside the fold of dogmatic religion, it is to Malraux's novels and his books on art that we shall finally have to turn.</page></plain_text>
