<plain_text><page sequence="1">PREDICTING MAIZE AGRICULTURE AMONG THE FREMONT: AN ECONOMIC COMPARISON OF FARMING AND FORAGING IN THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST K. Renee Barlow Variation in the costs and benefits of maize agriculture relative to localforaging opportunities structured variation in the rela- tive intensity of agricultural strategies pursued by prehistoric peoples in the American Southwest. The material remains of Fre- mont farmers and horticulturists, long identified as the "northern periphery" of Southwestern archaeological traditions, are examined as a case representing extreme intersite variation in the economic importance offarming. New data quantifying the energetic gains associated with maize agriculture in Latin America are compared to caloric return rates for hunting and col- lecting indigenous foods. These data suggest that prehistoric maize farming was economically comparable to many local wild plants, but that intensive farming practices were most similar to very low-ranked seeds. The model predicts a continuum of pre- historic strategies that included horticulture within a system of indigenous resource collection and high residential mobility at one end, and at the other sedentary farmers heavily invested in agricultural activities with residences maintained nearfields dur- ing a significant portion of the growing season. Differences in agricultural strategies should have been strongly influenced by the effects of local ecology on the marginal gains for time spent in maizefields and the abundance of key, high-ranked wildfoods, not harvest yields per se. Increasing agricultural investments are expected with decreasing opportunities to collect higher-ranked foods, while decreases in time spentfarming are expected only with increases in alternative economic opportunities. En este articulo propongo que la variacion en los costos y beneficios de la agricultura del maiz en comparacion con las oportu- nidades de forrajeo local propicio la variacion en la relativa intensidad de las estrategias agricolas seguidas por los antiguos habitantes del suroeste norteamericano. Los restos materiales de los agricultores Fremont, identificados como la periferia norte de las tradiciones arqueologicas del suroeste, ilustran un caso de extrema variacion entre sitios en cuanto a la importancia economica de la agricultura. Se comparan nuevos datos que cuantifican las ganancias energeticas asociadas con la agricultura en America Latina con conteos cal6ricos de comestibles cazados y recolectados. Estos datos sugieren que la agricultura prehist6rica de maiz fue econ6micamente comparable con muchas plantas silvestres locales, pero que las practicas agricolas intensivas dieron resul- tados mas similares a las semillas de bajo rango cal6rico. El modelo predice un continuum en las estrategias prehistoricas que por un lado incluyeron horticultura dentro de un sistema indigena de recoleccion de recursos y una alta mobilidad residencial, y por otro lado se constituyeron de agricultores sedentarios con mucha inversion en la agricultura y con residencias cerca de los campos agricolas por lo menos durante la temporada de crecimiento. Las diferencias en estrategias agricolas debieron haber sido influenciadaspor los efectos de la ecologia local en las ganancias marginalesprovenientes del maizy en la abundancia de comestibles silvestres de alto contenido cal6rico. La inversion en la agricultura esta inversamente relacionada con la disponibilidad de plan- tas silvestres alimenticias y de otras alternativas econ6micas. F remont assemblages are found throughout much of Utah (Figure 1). The Fremont cul- ture region extends from Idaho south to the Colorado River, and from the Green River in north- western Colorado to the Great Basin in eastern Nevada. Fremont sites are contemporary with archaeological assemblages in the Anasazi, Hohokam, Mogollon, Sinagua, and Patayan regions, and most sites date to between A.D. 700 and 1200 (Marwitt 1986; Massimino and Metcalfe 1999; Tal- bot and Wilde 1989). The characteristics that dis- tinguish Fremont material culture from other Southwestern traditions include a local variety of 8- to 14-rowed dent maize, often hafted on sticks (Fig- ure 2); ceramics that are usually plain grayware but sometimes decorated with applique, indentations or painted designs (upper left); small, regionally dis- tinctive projectile-point types; a single-rod-and-bun- K.

Corn cobs dating from approximately 100 B.C. toA.D. 500 have been recovered from a few locations (e.g., Geib and Bun- gart 1989; Jennings 1980; Madsen 1989; Wilde et al. 1986; Winter and Wylie 1974), and there is increasing evidence that maize may have been a pri- mary source of food in the diets of some individu- als by this time (e.g., Coltrain 1996; Geib 1993; Talbot and Richens 1996; Wilde et al. 1986). How- ever, assemblages with Formative characteristics are comparatively late in the Fremont area, well after major changes in diet and land use are indi- cated in BasketmakerAnasazi assemblages (cf. Mat- son 1991; Matson and Chisolm 1991; Smiley 1994). Apparently prehistoric inhabitants of the Fremont region did not produce assemblages with distinctive Fremont characteristics until some 600 years after maize was introduced locally (for similar arguments about the transition to maize agriculture elsewhere in the Southwest, see Minnis 1992 andVWills 1995). Fremont architectural features include pithouses, granaries, and multiple-room surface structures con- structed of mud and pole, adobe, or stone masonry. Many residential sites are located on alluvial sedi- ments conducive to crop production. Substantial habitation and storage facilities suggest sedentism during at least some portions of the year. Evidence of irrigation features at some locations further sug- gests the possibility of intensive agriculture (Metcalfe and Larrabee 1985; Morss 1931; Talbot and Richens 1996). Maize remains and grayware ceramics are</page><page sequence="4">68 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 67, No. 1, 2002 ubiquitous, and large trough-shaped metates (Figure 2, lower right) and loaf-shaped manos are often highly worn, indicating intensive processing of cereal grains (Hard et al. 1996). In addition, isotopic ratios in human skeletal remains from Backhoe Village, Evans Mound, and Caldwell Village are comparable to those from burials in the Anasazi region (Coltrain 1993; Decker and Tieszen 1989; Matson and Chisholm 1991). Clearly, maize farming was an important component of Fremont subsistence in some areas. Excavated sites important to interpretations of Fremont lifeways (Figure 1) include the Bear River sites, the Great Salt Lake Wetland sites, Willard Mounds, Hogup Cave, and Grantsville near the Great Salt Lake (Aikens 1966, 1967; Judd 1926; Sharrock and Marwitt 1967; Simms 1999; Steward 1933a); Nephi Mounds, Pharo Village, Topaz Slough, the Bennett Site, Nawthis, Baker Village, Backhoe Vil- lage, and Five-finger Ridge in the Sevier drainage (Barlow 1997:18-19; Madsen 1979; Marwitt 1968; Metcalfe and Heath 1990; Shearin 2000; Simms 1986; Talbot and Wilde 1989; Wilde and Soper 1994); Paragonah, Evans Mound, and Median Vil- lage in southwestern Utah (Berry 1974; Dodd 1982; Judd 1919; Marwitt 1970); and Whiterocks Village, Caldwell Village, Steinaker Gap, the Cub Creek sites, Nine Mile Canyon, Windy Ridge Village, Joes Val- ley Alcove, Innocents Ridge, the Turner-Look sites, Snake Rock Village, the Old Woman site, Triangle Cave, the Alvey site, and Cowboy Cave along the Green River drainage of the northern Colorado Plateau (Aikens 1967; Ambler 1966; DeBloois et al. 1979; Geib 1996; Jennings 1980; Madsen 1975; Miller and Matheny 1990; Schroedl and Hogan 1975; Talbot and Richens 1996; Taylor 1957; Wormington 1955). Nearly all assemblages include maize and plain gray pottery, but the frequencies of decorated Fremont wares, Utah-type metates, stone balls, fig- urines, and other unique Fremont artifact types vary between sites and geographical subregions, some- times dramatically. While some sites contain dozens of pit structures or surface rooms, many others yield only rock art, the remains of an isolated granary or hearth, or a few surface artifacts. Still others are rock- shelters with hearths and storage cists or open sites that consist of the remains of highly ephemeral fea- tures similar to the wickiups used by Paiute and Shoshone-speaking Native Americans through the late 1800s (e.g., Morss 1931; Simms 1986). The Fremont Problem In spite of its similarities to other prehistoric South- western traditions, the most remarkable aspect of Fremont material culture is the diversity it presents in the importance of maize farming relative to hunt- ing and gathering (Barlow 1997; Madsen 1989; Mad- sen and Simms 1998; Simms 1999). Originally designated "Puebloan" in recognition of assemblage characteristics like those in the Anasazi, Hohokam, Mogollon, and Patayan regions (Judd 1926), and long identified as the "northern periphery" of South- west material culture (Cordell 1984; Jennings and Norbeck 1955; Steward 1933a, 1933b; Wormington 1955), Fremont was also the first regional variant named in the newly defined Southwest "Pueblo" tra- dition in the early 1900s (Barlow 1997). Of the dis- parate sites, assemblages, and culture regions now subsumed within the Fremont archaeological tradi- tion, Noel Morss originally proposed the name "Fre- mont" for Formative sites along the Fremont and Green River drainages, noting that this distinctive culture relied on both agriculture and hunting, and was much more "primitive" and mobile than other Pueblo II cultures (Morss 1931). Similarly, Jesse D. Jennings initially suggested the label "Desert-culture Horticulture" to describe what he felt was largely an Archaic lifeway in the eastern Great Basin but with the addition of maize horticulture (Jennings and Nor- beck 1955). Each recognized that ecology strongly influenced the archaeological record of these for- agers and farmers, and each attempted to reconstruct the roles of migration, local adaptation, and the dif- fusion of technology in shaping the archaeological record of the Fremont. Perhaps better known for his work at Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon, Neil Judd conducted six field seasons of reconnaissance and excavation in Utah between 1915 and 1920 (Cordell 1984; Plog 1979). After investigating dozens of sites, he concluded that the material remains represented: homes of ancient Indians who were agricultur- ists after a fashion, and in consequence chiefly sedentary in their habits. But these prehistoric dwellings and the cultural objects found in them are not always the same. We note changes in the type of habitation as we pass from one valley to another, and changes in the character of the utensils employed daily by the occupants of those habitations.... That culture may have originated within the drainage of the Rio San Juan, or it may have come into being on the</page><page sequence="5">Barlow] MAIZE AGRICULTURE AMONG THE FREMONT 69 northern and western borders of the Great Interior Basin. But it is Puebloan in fact; it is definitely and directly related to those pre- Pueblo and Pueblo cultures represented by the prehistoric ruins of northern Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado [Judd 1926:152]. In contrast with the Anasazi, Mogollon, and Hohokam regions, the primary source of inter-assem- blage variability in the Fremont area is spatial rather than temporal (Barlow 1997; but see Talbot and Wilde 1989). Proposed developmental sequences are rare and are only described in a few sites after about A.D. 800 or 1000. These consist of the addition of corrugated or decorated ceramic wares, a shift from circular to rectangular pithouses, and the addition of coursed adobe or masonry surface structures. Such developments are broadly similar to those seen between A.D. 700 and 1100 throughout much of the Southwest (Marwitt 1970; compare with Cordell 1984; Kidder 1927). Most Fremont sites located in the vicinity of the Great Salt Lake (Figure 1) are very different from those in southern Utah, the Uintah Basin, or the Green River drainage. Areal classifi- cations of Fremont material culture, or proposed "variants" based on geography and the spatial dis- tribution of culture elements, are numerous, and Aikens (1966), Marwitt (1970), and Madsen (1979, 1989) have produced excellent summaries. Inter- assemblage variation is so great that local archaeol- ogists have had difficulty consistently determining the range of sites, assemblage types, and even geo- graphical areas to include within the definition of Fre- mont. In some cases, apparently contemporaneous sites within close proximity yield as much variation in assemblage composition as is common between Basketmaker and Pueblo sites in the Anasazi area, or even broadly between Fremont sites versus the Anasazi, Mogollon, or other culture regions (e.g., Ambler 1966; Barlow 1997; Madsen 1989; Marwitt 1970). This diversity is now thought to indicate funda- mental variation in prehistoric subsistence practices, particularly the importance of maize agriculture rel- ative to hunting and collecting wild foods (Madsen 1979, 1989). Archaeologists are concerned with identifying whether prehistoric inhabitants modified their economic focus from year to year, or whether several contemporaneous strategies of diet and land use were maintained by groups occupying the region simultaneously (Berry 1974; Madsen and Simms 1998; Simms 1986,1999; Simms et al. 1997; Zeanah and Simms 1999). In fact, "understanding adaptive diversity" has been the principal axiom guiding local studies during the last decade (Madsen and Simms 1998; Simms 1986; Zeanah and Simms 1999). In a comprehensive examination of the behavioral impli- cations of Fremont material remains, Madsen and Simms (1998) argue that maize agriculture was never the defining core of Fremont behavioral systems. They propose that while the importance of maize dif- fered from site to site, and was certainly a subsis- tence focus at some locations, "it is evident that resource choice and settlement patterns were not uni- versally centered around farming at any time during the Fremont period" (Madsen and Simms 1998:296). It is suggested here that the archaeological record of the Fremont simply represents a continuum of variation in the economic importance of maize and in the degree to which people inhabited central places or employed residential mobility to exploit maize fields and wild food procurement areas. The farm- ers and foragers who produced Fremont artifacts probably spent only a limited amount of time in maize fields during the growing season (perhaps sim- ilar to that spent in slash-and-bum agriculture in Latin America). However, local farming strategies during the 800-year Fremont period likely varied from horticultural to full time, from foragers har- vesting maize from small stands scattered among wild resource procurement areas to farmers spend- ing much of the growing season cultivating a num- ber of different fields. Rather than viewing farming as a cultural complex or way of life that individuals either embraced or rejected, Fremont agriculture is seen here simply as a composite of economic behav- iors associated with the production of food that var- ied in intensity and complexity from case to case. Using the concepts of human behavioral ecology, I propose that maize horticulture was highly ranked relative to most plant foods within local Archaic adaptations, but that decreasing energetic yields for hunting and gathering was the stimulus for increased investment in maize fields and increased sedentism at some sites between A.D. 700 and 1100. In the fol- lowing analysis I examine whether spatial variation in the costs and benefits of various farming activi- ties, coupled with differences in costs and benefits of collecting readily available indigenous plant foods, are key factors structuring intersite variability in material remains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,</page><page sequence="6">70 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 67, No. 1, 2002 this analysis leads to the prediction that the aban- donment of farming villages ca. A.D. 1300-1350 in the Fremont area was the result of increased avail- ability of alternative, higher-ranked wild foods, and not the result of decreasing maize harvests per se. The Benefits and Costs of Farming An economic assessment of farming and foraging in the prehistoric Southwest requires a methodology that allows archaeologists to compare the two modes of subsistence. Anthropologists who employ opti- mal-foraging theory to assess diet choice among modern foragers and horticulturists have shown that differences in the food energy gained during time spent collecting and processing various resources strongly influence subsistence patterns (e.g., Bayham 1979; Hawkes et al. 1982; Keegan 1986; Kelly 1995; O'Connell and Hawkes 1981; Simms 1987; Smith 1983; Winterhalder 1981; Winterhalder and Smith 1992). Mathematical models predict behavioral strategies that will maximize the rate of food energy gained per unit energy expended to collect and con- sume it. Based on the theory of natural selection, the underlying tenet of optimal-foraging theory is that individuals who employ efficient strategies in hunt- ing and food collection produce more offspring or more successful offspring because they gain extra resources to invest in their family, offspring, or mates. Optimal-foraging models are powerful tools for anticipating the behaviors of individuals and, sur- prisingly, are sometimes even more accurate in pre- dicting the collective diets of people operating as hunting or foraging groups. The same principle is applied here to the Fremont case. Maize farming is seen simply as a series of activities that yield an expected or average return, like hunting or collect- ing wild seeds. Foragers are expected to invest time in a particular farming activity (e.g., planting maize, weeding or watering maize fields, or harvesting the ripened ears) rather than foraging (e.g., hunting ante- lope, deer, or jackrabbits, or collecting pine nuts or wild seeds) only when doing so will result in an over- all increase in the net energy gained during all time spent hunting, gathering wild foods, and farming. People should spend their time in agricultural activ- ities, pursuing and collecting available wild foods, or both, depending upon which strategy will yield the most food gained during all time invested in sub- sistence pursuits. Within this behavioral framework, the time costs and energetic yields of maize farming are compared to those for collecting wild foods available in the eastern Great Basin and northern Colorado Plateau. Horticultural or agricultural strategies that yield a net increase in harvested food energy are expected to become more frequent relative to subsistence prac- tices that are less productive. Potential agricultural activities include various types of land preparation, the intentional sowing of indigenous or domesticated crops, weeding, fertil- izing, moving or watering young plants, harvesting, transporting and storing crops, and processing them for consumption. Among modern subsistence agri- culturists, these activities are often scheduled within a much larger complex of behaviors that may include hunting, collecting wild plants, manufacturing crafts, working for wages, and a variety of other important economic and social pursuits. Table 1 reports data detailing the average harvests gained in maize fields (bu/acre) and the labor costs associated with maize production (hr/acre) for maize fields in 29 Latin American communities. These data are from pub- lished observations of maize farming in Zinacantan, Chiapas (Cancian 1965), Panajachel, Guatemala (Tax 1963), and northwest Guatemala (Stadelman 1940), where farmers continued to cultivate maize using simple technology (Barlow 1994, 1997, 1999). Data for 106 cases are divided into three ecological settings: high elevation, or tierra fria; temperate zones, or tierra templada; and lowland fields that are often near rivers in tropical or semitropical ecolog- ical situations and referred to as "hot-country" or tierra caliente. Maize Harvests Without the aid of draft animals and animal or chem- ical fertilizers, maize harvests in Guatemala and southern Mexico range from approximately 10-50 bu/acre (Table 1). Most full-time farmers produce 12-33 bu/acre annually. Household gardens and newly cleared fields in wooded areas generally yield more abundant harvests than other field types, but the overall ecological settings of communities appear to have the greatest influence on harvests. Yields are generally highest in lowland tropical situations and river deltas, and lowest in high-elevation settings. Annual harvests of 40-50 bu/acre were reported in Santa Ana Huista and San Ramon in the tierra caliente and, surprisingly, also in household gardens</page><page sequence="7">Barlow] MAIZE AGRICULTURE AMONG THE FREMONT 71 Table 1.

The poorest maize harvests were obtained in the tierra fria communities of San Rafael La Independencia and San Juan Ixcoy in northwest Guatemala. Agricultural Costs Farming costs in Table 1 are reported as person- hours per acre (hr/acre) in agricultural activities, and include time spent clearing land of trees, brush, or old cornstalks, sometimes burning brush or spread- ing composted plant material over fields and tilling it into the soil, planting maize, re-seeding, cultivat- ing, and weeding young plants, and harvesting maize. Although some fields are not tilled prior to planting, others are tilled one, two, or three times. To calcu- late return rates that approach those achieved by pre- historic agriculturists, only cases reporting exclusive use of hand tools (e.g., machetes, axes, hoes, and dig- ging sticks) were used (Barlow 1997). Data for the few fields that were plowed or fertilized using draft animals were excluded from this analysis. It is impor- tant to caution that most of these estimates are based on the average number of workdays reported by farmers, not actual work times observed by anthro- pologists. Nevertheless, the variation is remarkable, and although all cases represent full-time, subsis- tence maize farmers, the amount of time invested in fields varies dramatically between communities and field types. In these cases, time spent working fields with hand tools ranges from 133-772 hr/acre annu- ally. There is no single, average field-investment strategy that typifies maize farming. Cost/benefit data were also calculated for five dif- ferent types of maize fields located in a high-eleva- tion valley in the Peruvian Andes (Table 2). Hastorf reports that these people, although not full-time maize farmers, work an average of 105 person-days per hectare in maize fields (Hastorf 1993:124-131). Harvest yields were reported in the gross kilocalo- ries produced per hectare in "bench, irrigated valley,</page><page sequence="8">72 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 67, No. 1, 2002 Table 2.

Conversion factors of 9 hours per per- son-day, 85,680 kilocalories per bushel of maize, and .4 hectares per acre were employed to convert these data to bu/acre and hr/acre for comparison with data from Guatemala and Mexico (Barlow 1997:114-116). Maize harvests in this region are generally poor, with "intensive" and "extensive" hill- side fields yielding only 2-3 bu/acre, and 7 bu/acre in irrigated valley fields. Caloric Return Rates Table 3 reports energetic return rates for farming maize in terms of kilocalories per hour (from Bar- low 1997). Each estimate is the food energy gained during time spent clearing, hoeing, planting, hilling, weeding and harvesting maize fields, and shelling dried maize and grinding it into meal. These rates were calculated simply by determining the food energy gained from maize per acre of cultivated land, and dividing that by the sum of hours per acre spent in each field activity during the growing season and the total time required to process the harvested maize: Maize Farming Return Rate (kcal / hr) [x bu / acre] [25.2kg bu] [3550 kcal / kg] ly hr / acre + [x bu I acre * 43.55hr / bu] where x bu/acre = reported bushels of shelled, dried maize kernels harvested per acre (Table 1); 25.2 kg/bu = the average weight (kg) of shelled, dried maize kernels per bushel (from data in Burns 1983:59; Castetter and Bell 1942; Stadelman 1940: 133); 3550 kcal/kg = the caloric value of shelled, dried maize kernels per kilogram (FAO 1953; see Barlow 1997:198 for discussion); ly hr/acre = the sum of time spent in all field activ- ities (e.g., clearing, planting, weeding, harvesting) per acre during the agricultural cycle (Table 1, from data reported in Barlow 1997 and Stadelman 1940); and 43.55 hr/bu = the time required to grain, pound, and grind one bushel of the harvested, dried maize into meal using stone manos and metates (from Adams 1989; Barlow 1997; Cancian 1965). For these cases, average maize yields and field times (Tables 1 and 2) were employed for the vari- ables x and y. However, where available, observed harvest yields and field times should be substituted. In calculating the 43.55 hr/bu post-harvest process- ing costs, graining costs were estimated from rates obtained by Tzotzil-speaking Mayan farmers in Chi- apas, Mexico (Cancian 1965). Grinding-cost esti- mates were borrowed from rates achieved during maize-grinding experiments in an investigation of ground stone assemblages in the American South- west (Adams 1989). This results in total processing costs of 1.73 hours per kilogram of harvested maize. This estimate is comparable to others calculated for processing cereals and seed foods (Barlow et al. 2000; Simms 1987; Wright 1994). If correct, it sug- gests that when yields ranged from 10 to 50 bu/acre, Latin American farmers using stone manos and metates spent an estimated 435-2,000 hr/acre, or 1-5 hours per day, processing maize for consump- tion (Barlow 1997:133; compare with Hard et al. 1996). In these cases, processing accounts for 45-90 percent of all time spent farming.

Economically, this is clearly within the range of wild plant foods available to the Fremont, many of which are common in archaeological sites and were important to the Paiute and Shoshone- speaking inhabitants of the region at the time of Euro- pean contact. In Figure 3, caloric return-rate estimates (kcallhr) are plotted against average annual maize harvests (bu/acre). The vertical columns of points at 12, 16.5, 25, and 33 bushels per acre (bu/acre) represent cases where people reported dif- fering amounts of time in maize fields, but the same "usual" annual maize harvests. The gray, curving lines represent sets of maize fields in Panajachel, Guatemala, Zinacantan, Chiapas, and the Upper Mantaro Valley in Peru, where one community-wide, average-work-effort estimate was reported, but vari- ation in maize harvests was measured. These data highlight several important aspects of the economics of maize farming and are particularly interesting in light of hypotheses concerning the spread and demise of Formative archaeological traits in the Fremont region. First, expected economic suc- cess for farmiing varies not only with harvest yields, but also with time invested in field activities. A strong, positive relationship between energetic returns and harvest yields would be indicated by a linear or increasing function. Instead, the observed</page><page sequence="10">74 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol.67,No.1,2002 . -s-no 2i- -in.

Caloric return rates for me ag culture with hand tools in Latin Amer relationship in Figure 3 is a diminishing returns curve. At best, maize agriculture in Latin America yields about 1700-1 800 kcaL/hr whether harvests are 10 or 50 bu/acre. The highest returns are associated with field investments of approximately 100-250 hr/acre and are found at the top of the graph. Those points in the lowest portion indicate investments of approximately 400-800 hr/acre.-The effects of work effort on return rates are most dramatic in regions with low-to-moderate expected harvests. For exam- ple, when production averages 12 bu/acre, farmers may experience energetic returns of 700-1650 kcallhr, depending on how much time is invested in fields. Doubling the expected harvest to 24 bu/acre (a very high yield for subsistence farmers without the aid of chemical or animal fertilizers or plows), anticipated energetic returns increase to 1200-1800 kcallhr. At 50 bu/acre, expected returns vary from 1770-1830 kcal/hr. Minimum expected returns increase significantly with better harvests because they are limited by high field costs, which are amor- tized over greater yields. However, maximum ener- getic gains change very little because maximum rates are constrained by high post-harvest processing costs. Second, the effects of climate change on caloric return rates will be most dramatic in regions with very low annual maize harvests. The gray curving lines in Figure 3 represent changes in return rates with increasing harvests when the same field-investment strategy is maintained. Again, these are based on actual data from cases in Zinacantan, Panajachel, and the Upper Mantaro Valley. The lowest curve rep- resents maize farming in Peru with an annual field investment of 383 hr/acre and maize harvests of 2-22 bu/acre (Table 2). This is a moderate field-investment strategy, with most Latin American maize farmers spending 200 to 600 hr/acre. The two overlapping curves near the center represent sets of fields in Pana- jachel with field investments of 334 and 384 hr/acre (Barlow 1997:109-1 10). The short gray curve near the top of the graph indicates three cases in Chiapas with annual investments of 104 hr/acre, and harvests of 12-17 bu/acre (Barlow 1997:113). This repre- sents a low investment, "slash-and-burn" agricul- tural strategy. These functions suggest that farmers</page><page sequence="11">Barlow] MAIZE AGRICULTURE AMONG THE FREMONT 75 experience smaller and smaller marginal gains with increased harvest yields even if no additional field costs (not even time spent harvesting and husking the additional grain) were associated with higher yields (see Barlow 1997:108-117). They are partic- ularly interesting here because they indicate maxi- mum expected increases or decreases in return rates when extrinsic factors (e.g., differences in soils or changes in growing season precipitation or temper- atures) influence expected annual harvests. For example, energetic returns could increase from about 1000-1300 kcallhr if greater growing season pre- cipitation or increased temperatures resulted in maize harvest increases of approximately 10-15 bu/acre. It is in these settings that spatial and temporal vari- ation in climate or ecological setting would likely have the greatest impact on the overall success of var- ious farming strategies. Not surprisingly, the highest observed energetic returns in Latin America are associated with "slash -and-burn" agriculture, in which brush-covered or wooded land is cleared and/or burned (Barlow 1997; compare Boserup 1965). Maize is planted and har- vested, but very little effort is invested in fields dur- ing the growing season. In low-investment agricultural strategies like these, return rates of 1650 kcal per hour may be obtained for yields as low as 12 bu/acre (Figure 3). This rate is comparable to the rates achieved in many fields yielding 16,20,30, and even 40 bu/acre. Based on these data, I propose that prehistoric for- agers and subsistence farmers in the Fremont region experienced only modest increases in economic suc- cess by investing additional time in field activities. Rather than intensifying efforts to produce an extra 2-5 bu/acre, Fremont farmers would have maxi- mized energetic returns by investing only small-to- moderate amounts of labor in individual fields. Increasingly intensive field strategies should be asso- ciated with increasingly lower marginal returns and lower overall economic success. Potential crop yields alone are insufficient predictors of the intensity of investments in farming activities among maize agri- culturists. In fact, in areas where average yields are consistently high, farmers will always do better to adopt an extensive strategy of planting more fields, rather than intensifying labor investments in a few fields. Consequently, hypothesized changing pre- cipitation regimes, new varieties of maize, or the development of local farming strategies are not nec- essarily complete explanations of transitions to For- mative lifeways in the American Southwest or the apparent abandonment of large portions of the region by full-time farmers after A.D. 1250. Figure 3 fur- ther suggests that if greater sedentism is associated with more intensive field investment, the appearance of fully "Formative" assemblage characteristics may be indicative of greater economic stress during time spent in food procurement and production, not nec- essarily increasing success in farming. Figure 4 illustrates the results of a preliminary test of the common archaeological hypothesis that farm- ers intensified maize production when greater har- vests were possible. The relationship between time spent in fields (hr/acre) and harvest yields (bu/acre) among subsistence farmers in Latin America is plot- ted using the data presented in Table 3. Instead of the expected positive correlation, the points are scat- tered throughout the range of the graph. The data actually yield a slightly negative regression statistic of -.067, with an r2 value of .005. Values in this range generally do not indicate a significant relationship. The most interesting information conveyed in the graph is simply that most modem subsistence maize farmers in Latin America gain between 10-40 bu/ acre, and farmers generally spend between 200 and 600 hr/acre (or 22-68 workdays) in their maize fields during the growing season. Note that the greatest time investments in Figure 4 are actually associated with fields that yield low- to-moderate annual maize harvests. Rather than spending more time in fields that produce fantastic amounts of maize, farmers tended to gain greater energetic returns when they minimized investments in moderate-to-rich agricultural settings. The most time appears to have been invested in locations where community averages for all fields were relatively poor, rather than in those locations that were pro- ducing "enough" maize. This suggests that increas- ing investment in farming is most common in communities with the lowest overall economic success. Farming Versus Foraging Time invested in maize agriculture should be strongly influenced both by the increases in maize yields expected with various field activities and the poten- tial economic gains associated with local hunting- gathering opportunities. If so, associations between maize harvests and prehistoric agricultural strategies</page><page sequence="12">76 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 67, No. 1, 2002 r = -0.67, r2 .005 800 - _ 0*i * * 3 600 -: Average Time * Invested in---*3**?

The relationship between time spent in maize fields and average annual maize harvests. may be a great deal more complex than anticipated by simple "opportunity" or "necessity" models (see discussions in Hard 1986; Hard and Merrill 1992; Hitchcock and Ebert 1984; Minnis 1985; Wills 1995). To explore this relationship for the Fremont case, estimates of the costs and benefits of maize farming are compared to those for hunting and col- lecting indigenous resources available to prehistoric foragers and farmers in the Great Basin and north- ern Colorado Plateau. In addition to maize, the remains of many wild foods are found in archaeo- logical assemblages throughout the Fremont region. Figure 5 illustrates energetic return rates for both. Most of the values for indigenous taxa are taken from post-encounter resource rankings in Simms's (1987) landmark study of the behavioral ecology of forag- ing in the Great Basin. However, estimates for cat- tail roots, pine nuts, local acorns, and Indian rice grass have been modified with supplementary data from other published studies (Barlow and Metcalfe 1996; Barlow et al. 2000; Jones and Madsen 1991; Mad- sen et al. 1997; see discussion in Barlow 1997:180, 200). Wild resources are listed in rank order with those yielding the highest gross caloric return rates at the top, corresponding to the scale (Kcallhr) on the y- axis. These return rates are based on reported caloric gains (kcal) per hour required to pursue, collect, and process each resource after it has been encountered by the forager (after Simms 1987); search times are not included. Resource rankings are entirely inde- pendent of the abundance or frequency of potential foods in the foraging environment. For ease of exam- ination, the y-axis is scaled logarithmically, such that higher values are compressed while lower values are spread out. The diet-breadth model predicts that the highest- ranked foods (e.g., bighom sheep, antelope, jackrab- bit) will always be pursued when encountered. With estimated post-encounter gains of 13,000-31,000</page><page sequence="13">Barlow] MAIZE AGRICULTURE AMONG THE FREMONT 77 | Energi ~~~~~~~~~Retunu -or Forawgm g andFa 1"0000 13*0606113to . ,~~~~~~9.0000-..11,00@ 1,0000 -., -RaI l . . 0 D _k _ . kcal/hr, lower-ranked potential foods should be ignored when local wild sheep, antelope, and jackrabbits are so dense that a forager cannot take a step without encountering one of them. Any addi- tional resource would lower overall energetic returns. On the other hand, when these resources are scarce the forager may spend so much time searching for them that overall return rates with search time included are lower than the post-encounter returns for hunting gophers and cottontails. When overall return rates fall to 9,000-11,000 kcal/hr, the forager will increase overall energetic return rates by hunt- ing all five potential prey items. Resources like cat- tail pollen, ground squirrels, and ducks should be included when local foraging rates drop to approxi- mately 3,000-6,000 kcallhr, and so on (Simms 1987). Estimated return rates for maize agriculture (kcallhr) are plotted alongside those for wild foods using four gray curves. As with the curves in Figure 3, these functions plot return rates with increasing maize harvests but no additional field time. Note that maize harvests on the x-axis apply only to agricul- ture, while wild foods are ranked independent of their own abundance. Although a continuum of vari- ation in field investment is actually expected, the four strategies are designed to simulate varying lev- els of investment seen among modern foragers, hor- ticulturists, and subsistence farmers. For this discussion, the four strategies represent the poten- tial range of prehistoric farming tactics using digging</page><page sequence="14">78 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 67, No. 1, 2002 sticks, hoes, manos, and metates: 1) Plant and harvest maize investing only 50 hr/acre, or about 5 to 6 person-days/acre; 2) Slash-and-burn agriculture investing 200 hr/acre, or 20 days/acre; 3) "Typical" subsistence agriculture with field investments of 400 hr/acre; and 4) An intensive maize agricultural strategy of 800 hr/acre that includes soil preparation before plant- ing, tending and weeding young plants, and various field activities throughout the growing season. Rates are calculated for harvests of 1-20 bushels per acre, and include estimated maize processing costs in addition to projected work effort in fields. The range of potential harvests was chosen based on Burns's (1983) reconstructed maize harvests in southwestern Colorado during the 700-year period from A.D. 650-1350. Using tree-ring data, one of Burns's data series predicted annual prehistoric maize yields of approximately 12-13 bu/acre, with a range of 6-21 bu/acre (Barlow 1997:183-190). This range actually approximates harvests in the Mesa Verde region of the Anasazi culture area. It is suggested that this range may represent maximum yields in the Fremont region, as few locations har- bor the rich soils and relatively high summer pre- cipitation that characterize the Colorado study area. Based on these data, maize farming with simple technology is economically comparable to collect- ing and processing a variety of eminently storable wild seeds and nuts. In southern Mexico and Guatemala, where today maize farming continues to be a common subsistence strategy, fields with har- vests of 6-20 bu/acre yield energetic returns of approximately 800-1700 kcallhr. Modern fields in Peru with harvests of less than 6 bu/acre yield returns of about 300-500 kcallhr. These estimates indicate that maize agriculture in Latin America generally yields much lower energetic returns than hunting game animals, but overlaps a wide range of wild plants available in the Great Basin and Southwest (see Jones and Madsen 1991; Kelly 1995; Simms 1987). In the Fremont area, high-ranked plants like pinyon pine nuts (Pinus monophylla) and bullrush seeds (Scirpus) should have become important wher overall foraging returns averaged about 1,200-1,70C kcal/hr (other varieties of pinyon available in the Southwest, like Pinus edulis and Pinus cemboides yield smaller, thicker-hulled seeds and consequently may yield lower energetic returns). A variety of loca] berries like wolfberry (Lycium), chokecherry (Prunus), hackberry (Celtis), and squawbush (Rhus), and perhaps some high-ranked native root foods like yampa (Perideridia), bitterroot (Lewisia), and camas (Camassia) may also be included in this group, but comparable data on the costs and benefits of their exploitation are not yet available. Important local plant foods in other regions of the desert Southwest, such as mesquite, agave, and some large acorn-yield- ing species (Barlow et al. 2000; Diehl 1997), may also yield return rates in this range. These foods are particularly interesting in light of the caloric return- rate estimates for maize agriculture, as they overlap projected returns for time spent just planting maize with digging sticks and harvesting the ripe ears. Many small seeds typical of historic Native Amer- ican plant-food collection in the Great Basin and Southwest, and also common in archaeological sites (e.g., saltbush, wild rye, tansey-mustard, blue grass, wild sunflower, and Indian rice grass and small local acorn-bearing species like Quercus gambelii and Q. turbinella), yield energetic returns comparable to "slash-and-burn" or "typical" maize investment strategies common among modern Latin American subsistence farmers. The lowest-ranked seeds (e.g., drop seed, pickleweed, squirreltail grass, and foxtail barley) are economically comparable to "intensive" maize agriculture in Latin America, but many of these were dropped from Native American subsis- tence practices by the early-to-mid-1900s (e.g., Bar- low and Metcalfe 1996). Initially, a maize cultivation strategy that includes minimal field investment is predicted among hunter- gatherers collecting high-ranked local plant foods like pine nuts and bullrush seeds. Greater field invest- ments are only expected with decreases in the avail- ability of higher-ranked wild foods, and consequently decreasing return rates for foraging efforts. Intensive maize agriculture should be associated with very broad diets, in the sense that even the lowest-ranked indigenous seeds are collected. The diet-breadth model does not speak directly to the issue of dietary importance, but predicts that all resources that are "in" the optimal diet should be pursued or collected at every encounter. In effect, foragers and farmers operating near the bottom of the chart in Figure 5 should work much harder than those at the top, since they spend more time pursuing opportunities that yield increasingly lower energetic returns. Con- versely, low-ranked seeds and intensive farming</page><page sequence="15">Barlow] MAIZE AGRICULTURE AMONG THE FREMONT 79 practices should be abandoned whenever the encounter rates of higher-ranked wild foods increase, or whenever opportunities to engage in less inten- sive farming systems arise. Expecting Farming among the Fremont Southwestern archaeologists often assume either that farming yields so much food that opportunities to farm structured the timing and intensity of agricul- ture (e.g., Berry 1974, 1982; Minnis 1992; Van West 1994), or that farming is so "expensive" that the abundance of wild foods determined when and where maize was adopted to supplement hunting and gath- ering (e.g., Hard 1986; Madsen 1982; Wills 1988). The analyses here suggest that both views include elements important in understanding prehistoric tran- sitions to agriculture. Maize fields can yield large quantities of harvestable food energy. However, a variety of alternative local wild foods yield energetic benefits that are comparable to maize farming, even in optimal conditions in Latin America. The inclu- sion or exclusion of maize farming should therefore not vary simply with anticipated harvests, but also with the kinds of wild foods available (Barlow 1997:159-97). In fact, there is no economic basis for the position that maize farming intrinsically pro- vided more food or a more stable subsistence for pre- historic people than could be obtained by hunting and gathering. 1. "Plant-and-Harvest" Strategy. The proposed minimal "plant-and-harvest" strategy in Figure 5 captures the very lowest level of field investment possible with maize horticulture. Simply planting maize using a digging stick without prior field preparation requires approximately 25 hr/acre and low estimates for harvesting maize fields by hand range from 20-28 hr/acre (Barlow 1997). Although not seen in ethnographic cases in LatinAmerica, the hypothesized 50 hr/acre "plant-and-harvest" strat- egy simulates one type of maize horticulture reported in southern Utah and northern Arizona in the early 1900s (Kelly 1976) and may approximate maximum potential energetic returns for the initial adoption of maize into Archaic hunter-gatherer sys- tems (e.g., Flannery and Reynolds 1986; Minnis 1992; Wills 1988). According to a San Juan Paiute informant, maize or "kumi" was planted in a suit- able location with a stick. A small ditch was dug by hand to divert water from a nearby spring and the planted area was left until harvest time (Kelly 1976:192). A variety of wild foods were collected and stored during the summer. Low-investment agriculture is generally associ- ated with low absolute harvests, but estimated ener- getic gains of approximately 1,300-1,700 kcallhr are anticipated with annual harvests of approximately 2-5 bu/acre. This strategy is not unlike that reported for some bushmen groups in the Kalahari desert who cultivate maize, melons, and other foods within a sys- tem of hunting-and-gathering and high residential mobility (Hitchcock and Ebert 1984), and perhaps also tropical foragers like the Hiwi ofVenezuela who obtain most of their food energy from hunting and collecting wild taxa (Hurtado and Hill 1989:305). By scattering small plots of maize throughout the for- aging environment, hunter-gatherers may increase overall energetic returns without substantial changes in diet, foraging practices, or settlement patterns (compare Cordell 1984; Minnis 1985). The diet-breadth model predicts that prehistoric foragers in the Fremont region should have adopted low-investment maize horticulture whenever high- ranked plant foods like pine nuts were included in diets, or when foraging yielded average returns of about 1,300-1,700 kcalhr. High residential mobil- ity and the use of small maize patches in numerous locations with conditions "suitable" for maize hor- ticulture are expected. In similar land-use systems among Southern Paiute and Kalahari horticulturists, wild foods and cultigens alike were cached in stor- age facilities near numerous collection areas and cul- tivation patches (Hitchcock and Ebert 1984; Kelly 1976). The diet-breadth model also predicts the con- tinued use of high-ranked plants such as pine nuts, bullrush seeds, and perhaps locally available berries and root foods. Other, similarly high-ranked wild and cultivated plant foods should also be included, but many low-ranked seeds should be ignored unless overall energetic returns are low enough to warrant substantial agricultural investments. Storage struc- tures and processing/camping facilities near maize fields and wild-food collection areas are expected, but not seasonal or long-term habitations. This expec- tation is consistent with recent arguments that the nascent spread of agriculture may have been rapid and difficult to track archaeologically (e.g., Smiley 1994), initially involving only a slight dietary shift with the addition of cultigens to indigenous land-use systems. It is suggested that Cowboy Cave (Jennings 1980), many Archaic cave sites in the Southwest</page><page sequence="16">80 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 67, No. 1, 2002 (Smiley 1994), Formative-age Fremont sites like Topaz Slough and the Bennett Site in the west desert (Barlow 1997; Shearin 2000; Simms 1986), the remains of campsites in Skull Valley (Smith 1994), rockshelter sites with storage cists along the Fre- mont River (Morss 1931), and numerous sites in the Uintah Basin (Marwitt 1986) may be associated with similar levels of field investment. 2. Slash-and-Burn Strategy. "Slash-and-bum," or shifting cultivation systems, appear to yield the great- est energetic returns among full-time subsistence farmers in Latin America today. Maize farmers in Santiago, Jacaltenango, La Democracia, Cuilco, Santa Ana Huista, San Ramon, and Zinacantan employ slash-and-burn strategies in some fields, investing approximately 100-250 hr/acre for harvest yields of 12-50 bu/acre and gaining energetic returns of 1400-1800 kcalVhr (Barlow 1997). Slash-and- burn strategies are most common in tropical lowlands or ecological situations that favor maize and facili- tate the growth of dense indigenous vegetation. Field investment is generally limited to land-clearing and soil preparation before planting, without substantial investments in fields during the growing season. In the Fremont region, similar field investments in rare, relatively high-yield locations might have produced harvests of approximately 5-15 bu/acre, with for- agers that farm gaining energetic returns of approx- imately 1100-1500 kcalhr. Temporal and spatial shifts from foraging/horticulture land-use systems to slash-and-burn agriculture are predicted with decreases in the availability of important, high- ranked plant foods like pine nuts. The collection of additional local foods like saltbush or shadscale (Atriplex), wildrye (Elymus), and tansey mustard (Descurainia) are expected. Sedentism during the growing season would not be necessary, but foragers are expected to invest more heavily in habitations and storage facilities near field locations. Several weeks or more of occupation are expected in the spring, with more time in autumn to harvest and store the maize, and perhaps during the winter months to consume harvested produce or transport it to a winter habita- tion. Local shifts from "plant-and-harvest" maize horticulture to "slash-and-burn" field-investment strategies may actually represent the most dramatic transition in diet and lifeways that occurred during the prehistoric period (compare Wills and Huckell 1994). A number of "Formative" pithouse villages throughout the Southwest may have been associated with agricultural investment strategies similar to those used in shifting cultivation systems in tropical Latin America. Sites in the northern Tucson Basin (Roth 1992) may represent a local, early develop- ment of this kind. Farmers are not expected to have invested large amounts of time in any single field location. As foraging return rates diminished, pre- historic farmers initially would have gained higher economic returns by investing minimal efforts in additional maize fields in "suitable" locations, rather than intensifying labor in one or a few fields. Sug- gested sites associated with "slash-and-burn" agri- cultural locations include the SU site (Martin 1941; Wills 1989, 1996), the Cienega Creek sites (Diehl 1997; Huckell 1995), Basketmaker II sites on Cedar Mesa (Dohm 1994), Shabik'eschee Village (Wills and Windes 1989), and Evans Mound and Five- Finger Ridge in the Fremont region (Berry 1974; Dodd 1982; Talbot and Wilde 1989). Although these clearly are substantial occupations, the model sug- gests their repeated use by farmers cultivating maize in nearby fields and numerous other locations, in addition to hunting and collecting wild foods. Smaller Fremont habitations like the Bear River sites, Innocents Ridge, Backhoe Village, some temporal components of Nawthis village, and perhaps many small sites dating to later Pueblo or Classic periods in the Southwest, may also represent the locations of short-term habitations associated with locations suitable for low-investment, "slash-and-burn" agri- culture and/or the collection of wild foods (e.g., Kohler 1992; Sullivan 1987) 3. "Typical" LatinAmerican Investment Strategy. Greater farming investments, or intensification, are only expected with decreasing overall return rates, suggesting decreases in the availability of higher- ranked foods and better farming patches (sensu Hard 1986; Janetski 1997; Madsen 1979). The amount of time spent cultivating maize should vary with the range of alternative subsistence pursuits available during the growing season and aspects of the local ecology (e.g., soils, precipitation) that influence the marginal gains for various farming activities. Fea- tures of the archaeological record that indicate inten- sive farming efforts should be associated with evidence of decreases in the availability of less costly foods, and may be accompanied by other indicators of decreasing foraging efficiency or increasing nutri- tional stress.</page><page sequence="17">Barlow] MAIZE AGRICULTURE AMONG THE FREMONT 81 "Typical" subsistence agriculture in Latin Amer- ica includes field investments of approximately 400 hr/acre. Farmers in Chiapas, Guatemala, and Peru spent 300 to 500 hr/acre in about 60 percent of the cases examined in this study (Tables 2 and 3). In real- ity, farmers without the aid of draft animals, irriga- tion systems, or chemical fertilizers generally invest 30-50 person-days per acre laboring in maize fields during the growing season. Annual maize harvests range from 2-50 bu/acre, and farmers gain energetic returns of 300-1700 kcalhr, depending on harvest yields and level of field investment. If "typical" cul- tivation systems in southwestern Colorado yielded average harvests of 12-13 bu/acre and energetic returns of 700-900 kcalhr from A.D. 650 to A.D. 1350, farming in the Fremont region likely yielded even lower returns (see discussion in Barlow 1997:183-190). Nevertheless, with typical Latin American investment levels and predicted maize har- vests of 2-20 bu/acre, the model anticipates energetic returns of 300-1100 kcalhr. This suggests that in the Fremont area there may have been little advantage for increasing field investments two-fold over slash- and-burn agriculture. If, for example, a Fremont farmer could increase average harvest yields from 12-15 bu/acre by spending 400 rather than 200 hr/acre in fields during the growing season, a gain of 3 additional bu/acre per the additional 200 hr/acre required to achieve it would yield a marginal gain of about 800 kcallhr. Overall energetic returns for time spent farming would drop from approximately 1400 to 950 kcallhr. Of course, the actual marginal gain would depend on the particular field activity in ques- tion (e.g., tilling the soil, irrigation, weeding) and its effect on harvest yields given local conditions for growing maize. In some areas, time spent irrigating or weeding may result in substantial increases; in oth- ers, improvements for the same activities would be much less dramatic. In general, however, increasing field investments will be indicative of decreasing foraging and farming returns, and should be associ- ated with increasing sedentism during the growing season. "Typical" field investments are predicted in the Fremont region only when opportunities for col- lecting higher-ranked foods or engaging in more profitable activities are limited. Again, nutritional stress is expected with evidence of increasing seden- tism and investments in maize fields. Farmers should continue to collect pine nuts, bullrush seeds, berries, and other high-ranked plants during the growing sea- son, but the range of species collected should increase to include locally available bluegrass (Poa), wild sunflower (Helianthus), Indian rice grass (Oryzop- sis), and similar resources. Given the frequency of this type of strategy among modem maize farmers, it is likely that many historic and prehistoric pueb- los throughout the American Southwest are associ- ated with farming investments of approximately 400 hr/acre. Fremont sites that may be indicative of "typ- ical" farming strategies include Nephi Mounds, Baker Village, Snake RockVillage, Caldwell Village, and the Turner-Look Sites and perhaps some occu- pations at Evans Mound, Nawthis Village, and Five Finger Ridge. Although adequate cost/benefit data are not yet available, it may be that indigenous species of amaranth (Amaranthus) and chenopod (Chenopodium) also yield energetic returns similar to wild sunflower, Indian rice grass, and maize farm- ing with "typical" levels of field investment. If so, comparable estimates of energetic yields for these foods may allow archaeologists to develop infer- ences about larger patterns of diet, farming strate- gies, and overall nutritional welfare based on their presence and apparent dietary importance in South- western archaeological sites. If prehistoric farmers operated under constraints similar to modern subsistence maize farmers, they may have employed several field-investment strate- gies simultaneously in different ecological settings (e.g., Table 1). Scattered granaries positioned in obscure locations or on escarpments high above canyon floors, like those in Nine-mile Canyon and along the Green River and its tributaries, may be associated with "plant-and-harvest" or "slash-and- burn" levels of investment along river channels, even if they were part of a larger system of land use that included greater labor investments and seasonal or long-term habitation structures at some locations. 4. Intensive Farming Investments. The "intensive" agricultural strategy predicted in Figure 5 represents the maximum level of field investment observed among modern full-time subsistence farmers. This strategy is only expected when overall returns for for- aging and farming are very low. Although field investments of 500-700 hr/acre are not uncommon in high elevation, wooded fields in Latin America, investments of 700-800 hr/acre are extremely rare. Only maize farmers in the high-elevation, tierrafria community of Colotenango invest at this level, and</page><page sequence="18">82 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 67, No. 1, 2002 then only in one type of field. Perhaps not surpris- ingly, average energetic returns of approximately 850 kcallhr are among the poorest for maize farm- ing in Guatemala. Intensive maize agriculture is only rarely expected in the Fremont region and Greater Southwest, and should be associated with use of the lowest-ranked wild food plants. To the extent that these plants were naturally abundant in local forag- ing environments, they may constitute a major dietary component. However, extreme nutritional stress is indicated, and intensive farming practices should be dropped from local subsistence strategies whenever energetic return rates for foraging or farm- ing increase (sensu Boserup 1965). It may be that the complex irrigation systems at Chaco Canyon (Vivian 1990) and the "pebble-mulch gardens" of the Rio Grande basin (Lightfoot and Eddy 1995) are indicative of such levels of field labor. It is suggested here that few, if any, Fremont sites represent field- investment strategies of greater than 600 hours per acre. Sites associated with field locations requiring major land-clearing activities, like those in heavy brush or woodland settings, would be the most likely candidates. A Gender Issue These return-rate estimates also raise questions about the role of women in transitions to agricultural in the American Southwest. Potential male/female differ- ences in the relative advantages of farming versus foraging have been ignored in this discussion. Instead, attention has focused exclusively on eco- nomic success as measured by average return rates and the circumstances when time spent producing food would result in more food acquired overall. However, it is a truism that men and women operat- ing in the same foraging environment focus on dif- ferent sets of resources. Although time/energy studies among the Ache of eastern Paraguay and the Alyawara of arid Australia indicate that the range of potential wild foods included in the diets of hunter- gatherers generally meet predictions of the diet- breadth model (Hawkes et al. 1982; Kaplan and Hill 1992; O'Connell and Hawkes 1981), variation in the types of resources taken by female and male foragers indicate marked gender differences in foraging goals. For the most part, the foraging behaviors of women appear to be most strongly conditioned by the eco- nomics of provisioning offspring, while men's strate- gies may be influenced more by potential social benefits associated with capturing large resources that are widely shared. Whereas the variance asso- ciated with hunting game animals results in the cap- ture of one large "package" of food energy that is returned to camp and quickly distributed among all individuals, resources like berries, root foods, palm starch, and seeds can usually be collected by any indi- vidual on a daily basis (Hawkes 1990). As a conse- quence, women generally distribute the latter foods primarily to children and other family members. Maize is most similar to the kinds of foods taken by women foragers worldwide. Although farming may produce a very large patch of food energy in a predictable location, the expected energetic returns for spending the time required to do so are much lower than those calculated for pursuing, capturing, skinning, gutting, and butchering animals. Even though heavy field work such as fertilizing, hoeing, tilling, and plowing with draft animals are "tradi- tionally" male activities, women in Latin America often plant and harvest maize, sometimes engage in field labor during the growing season, and perform nearly all the necessary maize-processing tasks. To the extent that the time required to collect and process agricultural products for consumption is considered labor, prehistoric women were likely the driving force that enabled "agricultural revolutions." In most contexts in theAmerican Southwest, the initial adop- tion of maize into Archaic foraging strategies may simply have been an extension of womens' every- day foraging decisions. Whether it was most often used to provision offspring or attract potential mates is beyond the scope of this discussion. The planting and harvesting of small patches of maize, like the scattering of wild seeds in the Great Basin (e.g., Steward 1938) or the cultivation of melons and maize in the Kalahari desert (Hitchcock and Ebert 1984), would likely result in resource collection, storage, and distribution tactics similar to those used for other plant foods. Consequently, it is hypothesized that initially women foragers, not men, would have gained the greatest economic advantage for adding maize and other cultigens to Archaic food collection strategies. A Proposed Archaeological Test In the American Southwest, the expansion of pre- historic farmers, as indicated by the frequency and spatial distribution of habitation sites with Forma- tive assemblage characteristics, is generally thought</page><page sequence="19">Barlow] MAIZE AGRICULTURE AMONG THE FREMONT 83 to have been positively and strongly correlated with ecological situations that favored high harvest yields. This assumption is also prevalent in hypotheses developed to explain the increase in farmers or farm- ing technology in the Fremont culture region, as well as spatial variation in the importance of maize and the apparent demise of Fremont material culture after A.D. 1350. Whether this latter transition is best accounted for by local or regional abandonments, the replacement or absorption of people that produced Fremont assemblages by immigrating, Numic- speaking foragers, or an adaptive shift back to full- time hunting and gathering, most archaeologists assume that the ultimate cause is decreasing maize yields, rather than any ecological or technological factor that might have influenced efficiency in hunt- ing or collecting wild plant foods. However, "typi- cal" maize agriculture in Latin America is low ranked relative to nearly all Great Basin hunting opportuni- ties, most insect foods, and many fruits and nuts. In general, it yields energetic returns comparable to moderate- and low-ranked plant foods collected by women worldwide (e.g., Hawkes et al. 1982; O'Con- nell and Hawkes 1981; Simms 1987; Winterhalder 1981; cf. Kelly 1995). Furthermore, in the ethno- graphic cases reviewed here, there is no obvious increase in field time with greater average maize yields, and in fact, no apparent relationship exists between the two variables. Time invested in maize fields does not increase with average harvests (Fig- ure 4). This result at least suggests that the amount of time farmers spend in agricultural activities is influenced by factors other than the abundance of maize at harvest time. Even in locations where har- vests are relatively high, the inclusion or exclusion of maize in diets is expected to vary not simply with maize harvests, but also with the kinds of wild foods available locally and average return rates for alter- native subsistence practices. Greater investment in maize farming, or "intensification," is only expected with overall decreases in energetic efficiency. Fremont archaeological assemblages may pro- vide an important test of this hypothesis. Agricultural intensification, manifested by greater investment in agricultural features and habitation and storage struc- tures, should be associated with a broader diet (com- pare Diehl 1997). In locations where acorns, bluegrass, sunflower, rice grass and chenopod were abundant, such resources should be represented in summer habitations by large quantities of seeds, chaff, or other processing wastes. In addition, the logistical and intensive use of nearby patches of pine nuts, acorns, and seeds should be indicated by col- lection sites with processing facilities like fire hearths, ground stone, and perhaps storage architec- ture (e.g., Barlow and Metcalfe 1996; Barlow et al. 2000). Increasing complexity in site structure, includ- ing greater accumulations of secondary refuse, gen- eral intra-assemblage variability, and micro-refuse patterns that suggest increasingly specialized use of areas within habitations, are expected with greater lengths of time spent in fewer residences (e.g., Met- calfe and Heath 1990; O'Connell 1987; Schiffer 1972). Conversely, "slash-and-burn" maize agricul- ture, or low-to-moderate field-investment strategies, are expected in richer settings (sensu Madsen 1979). Foragers employing this type of farming strategy should have had greater opportunities to encounter higher-ranked wild foods, including both game ani- mals and "preferred" or higher-ranked plants. Even though maize would have been a major part of sub- sistence in locations favoring high yields, diets should have been narrow in the sense that a smaller number of low-ranked taxa were included. Greater residential mobility, or a greater number of resi- dences associated with groups of fields and wild food collection areas, are predicted. Less investment in architecture is expected at each location, and farm- ing foragers should have been more robust and healthy than counterparts that engaged in intensive cultivation practices. Hard et al. (1996), Simms et al. (1999), and Odell (1998) have recently suggested additional lines of archaeological evidence that may correlate with dif- ferences in agricultural investment. Hard et al. (1996) argued that inter-assemblage variation in mano size, differences in the ubiquity of maize in human copro- lites and bulk soil samples, and differences in human bone chemistry (coupled with variation in the pro- portion wild C3 to C4/CAM plant remains in macro- fossils assemblages) all indicate increasing reliance on maize agriculture. A comparison of the surface area of ground stone would provide an interesting test for the Fremont case. Once again, however, it is argued here that the increased use of certain wild plant foods, particularly abundant small seeds and other foods that require extensive processing, should accompany intensified agricultural effort. Using bone chemistry, it may also be difficult to sort out the con- founding issues of diet versus labor investment</page><page sequence="20">84 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 67, No. 1, 2002 among subsistence agriculturists, since some "slash- and-bum" farmers with high-yield fields in Chiapas spend very little time in maize fields during the grow- ing season (104 hr/acre). Yet these farmers consume as much or more maize annually than those invest- ing 600-700 hr/acre in fields in northwest Guatemala or 380 hr/acre in Peru. Other evidence from plant macrofossil assemblages, such as the ubiquity of low-ranked seeds in bulk soil samples or the num- ber of low-ranked taxa represented in cultural con- texts relative to those available in local prehistoric environments, might be an indicator of intensity in field labor. Similarly, degree of investment in ceramic wares measured through analyses of vessel wall thickness and temper size may provide collaborating evidence about the degree of sedentism among Fremont farm- ers and foragers. Simms et al. (1987) have taken a first step in developing a methodology to quantify differences in sedentism by measuring the amount of effort invested in the production of pottery. To the degree that these differences correlate with invest- ment in agricultural fields, they may aid in defining regional and temporal patterns in Fremont subsis- tence. Although largely untapped as a source of infor- mation about prehistoric behavior, Fremont lithic assemblages may also provide important insights about degree of investment in agriculture. Odell (1998) found decreases in the use of bifacial tech- nology with increasing sedentism during the Holocene in the Illinois River Valley. Although not a statistically significant pattern, some documenta- tion for increases in the kinds of tools and usewear expected with increasing agricultural efforts (e.g., hoes, hoe-sharpening flakes, chopping, and wedg- ing usewear) was also recovered from at least one Middle Woodland site. An auxiliary and more rigorous test of the behav- ioral implications of the foraging/farming model would employ ethnographic observations of modem subsistence maize farmers that utilize relatively sim- ple farming technology and continue to collect wild plant foods (Barlow 1999). Scan surveys and focal follows of individuals engaged in field labor, as well as documentation of harvest yields and processing costs, would permit robust estimates of the costs and benefits of maize farming relative to alternative foods. By observing relationships between actual differences in maize harvests and time spent in var- ious farming activities among subsistence farmers, archaeologists would also be in a much better posi- tion to understand the costs and benefits of various types of field-investment strategies. At a minimum, this will require quantifying variance in work effort and harvest yields of maize fields in close proxim- ity, as well as groups of fields in differing environ- ments. When studied within the context of modem opportunities, we can then support or falsify hypothe- ses about the causes of increasing or decreasing field investments with behavioral observations. Recent time/energy studies have proven the usefulness of this approach to understanding synchronic variation in diet, time spent foraging, and time spent in agricul- tural activities among modem foragers and horti- culturists (e.g., Johnson and Behrens 1982; Keegan 1986; Lee 1968; O'Connell and Hawkes 1981; Hawkes et al. 1982; Hurtado and Hill 1989). Addi- tional studies of this kind among small-scale sub- sistence agriculturists (cf. Wilken 1987:7-14) will likely provide important insights about field-invest- ment strategies among modem foragers and farmers as well as prehistoric foragers that farmed. Acknowledgments.
