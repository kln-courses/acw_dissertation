<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jeffrey Wills Callimachean Models for Ovid's 'Apollo-Daphne' After creating the world afresh in the first book of the Métamorphoses, Ovid begins a séries of amatory taies with Daphne and Apollo, prototy- pes for the many lovers who follow. Ovid's mémorable story (l, 452-567) has a straightforward plot: the arrows of Cupid, belittled by Phoebus, simultaneously incite the god to pursue Daphne and the nymph to flee, until appeals to her father Peneus change Daphne imo thè laurei tree. As the first love escapade, Daphne-Apollo holds a recognized impor- tance in the study of the structure, genre, and tone of the Métamorphoses. Particular attention has been given to the passage's relationship to the opening 450 lines. A génération ago, Brooks Otis discussed éléments of comic déflation; later, W.S.M. Nicoli argued for the Apollo-Cupid épi- sode as a variation on the recusatio motif; most recently, Peter Knox has elaborated the Alexandrian taste for setting elegy after cosmogony, and he has discussed the prominence of this épisode in establishing Ovid's programmatic opening1. This attention to the stylistic register has been useful, but issues of genre need to be discussed with a fuller awareness of thè background lying be- hind the narrative hère. Parthenius (Erot. 15) prepared a brief version of the Daphne story for Cornelius Gallus, but Ovid's version is appa- rently independent of this tradition2. Parthenius' Leucippus assumes wo- men's clothes in order to accompany Daphne (daughter of Amyclas) but is undone by Apollo, who then pursues her. Only the end of Parthe- nius' summary prépares us for the Daphne of the Métamorphoses: 1. B. Otis, Ovid as an Epie Poet, Cambridge 19702, 91-127, 357-9; W.S.M.

This is in fact thè basic story Ovid tells, but with thè addition of Peneus as her father and thè récipient of her pleas. We almost fail to recognize thè similarity of thè two versions, however, because Parthenius' brevity contrasts sharply with Ovid's hundred lines of chase and escape. If thè literary antécédents of these distinctive features - Daphne's prolonged flight and her relationship to her father Peneus - are not apparent from Parthenius' account, I think we would be wrong to attribute them to some conveniently lost Hellenistic myth of Daphne. Mere translation was never Ovid's practice. Combination, collation, correction and cross-pollination abound in Augustan poetry, producing narrative as well as linguistic variano. It is well known that for many myths Ovid avoided following a single source, but thè usuai accompa- nying assumption is that he combined and varied two or more treatments of thè s a m e myth. To be sure, there are stories like that of Polyphe- mus in Book 13, where thè existence of several predecessors allowed am- pie opportunity for combination, but such cases are thè exceptions. Not only are two extant sources usually rare, but even one substantial source is sometimes hard to find. The solution to thè problem of thè disappear- ing source lies in a more complete concept of a 'source*. As Stephen Hinds argues in his study of Ovid's Persephone, «the obsessive concern with the reconstruction of lost poetry has led to the undervaluing of the mo- re accessible parts of the literary tradition»3. Récent readings of Ovid re- mind us of his stylistic and Callimachean focus at every turn; it was careful poetry that inspired him, it was learned poetry he evoked4. We do not fret long over mysterious lost Republican versions of the Dido legend, when we hear Calypso, Ariadne and Medea in Virgil's poetry. Likewise, it is conceivable, indeed probable, that much of Ovid's Daphne is ano- ther woman's story5. A few Callimachean quotations in this épisode hâve long been recog- nized, especially Daphne's request for perpetuai virginity, echoing that of Artemis at the beginning of Hymn 3, and Frederick Williams has re- 3.

S. Hollis, Ovid: Métamorphoses, Book VIII, Oxford 1969, p. xxi. 5. Although he often limits his search to sources hearing characters of the same name, Otis does note that Calvus' Io appears both in Ovid's Daphne and in his Io and that the Parthenian Daphne appears in both his Daphne and Callisto: Otis, p. 352.</page><page sequence="3">Callimachus and Ovid 14-5 cently pointed out more Hellenistic motifs6. However, a fuller study re- veals not only more Callimachean expressions but also a Callimachean model for thè narrative line. My principal aim, therefore, is to lay out thè allusions to what I believe is an important literary background for thè Apollo-Daphne épisode: Callimachus' Hymn to Delos (Hymn 4), in which thè poet apostrophizes thè island that favored thè distressed Leto, when Hera hindered her from hearing Apollo. The hymn opens with thè landscape of Delos and her state as a floating island, originally called Asteria. When Leto sought a piace in which to give birth to Apollo, lands and rivers fled before her. Eventually she implored thè Thessalian nymphs and their father Peneus, who were willing to help but whom Leto was unwilling to endanger. Leto passed through other islands until Asteria gave her sanctuary. For this benevolence Delos is now sacred to Apollo. That a hymn for Apollo should lie behind Ovid's Apollo story is har- dly surprising, nor that Callimachus' Hymn should provide features of Ovid's Apollo. More importantly, however, features unrelated to thè god but spécifie to Ovid's treatment have seeds in Callimachus' Hymn. Most obvious of these are thè dramatic use of flight and thè role of Peneus. Much of thè Hymn to Delos relates how Leto seeks refuge but always finds desired sanctuary fleeing from her. Ovid has transferred this situa- tion to thè next génération, as Apollo pursues Daphne and she flees from him. The thirteen instances of forms of fugete etc. dominating Ovid's story écho eight instances of φεύγει within 35 lines in Callimachus7. The fleeing rivers and hüls of Callimachus are now combined in Ovid's swift- flying nymph Daphne. Indeed, thè opposition of Cupid's arrows in Ovid 1, 469 (fugat hoc, facit illud amorem) defines Daphne primarily as one in flight from Apollo. In Callimachus, moreover, Leto's journey is also that of thè unborn Apollo, so thè frustration of Ovid's Apollo echoes not only Leto's exper- 6. Cf. Met. 1, 486 and Hymn 3, 6 (δός μοι παρθενίην αίώνιον, αππα, φυλάσσειν) discussed most recently by Garth Tissol, Narrative Style in Ovid's «Métamorphoses» and the Influence of Callimachus, Diss. Berkeley 1988, pp. 64-6, in a section on Ovid's treatment of the Hymn to Artemis. Artemis' subséquent request (και πολυωνυμίην, Ινα μή μοι Φοίβος έρίζη, 3, 7) in- troduces the thought of striving against Phoebus, particularly appropriate for Daphne, as F. Williams notes, art. cit. p. 250. In generai, I am following the avenue of A. G. Lee on Met. 1, 486: «O. must have known Callimachus' poetry well. If more of it had survived, we should no doubt have been able to recognise many more réminiscences of this sort». So also Otis, cit, p. 352, «Callimachus was a generai source. Certain or assured Callima- chean réminiscences in these épisodes are from the Hecale... and the Fifth Hymn». T. Eggers (Die Darstellung von Naturgottheiten bei Ovid und früheren Dichtern, Paderborn 1984, pp. 160-9) discusses the Hymn to Delos for its nature deities but makes no connection to Ovid's Daphne scene. Particularly relevant is Minos' chase of the nymph Britomartis in Hymn 3, 190-203 and that nymph's association with the myrtle. 7. Forms of φεύγειν, Cali.

The Callimachean Apollo is well aware that he causes others to flee and even expresses confidence in his speed (φεύγε πρόσω· ταχινός σε κιχήσομαι, 95). Ovid can hardly have been una- ware of Callimachus' extended flight and chase scene8, and thè plea of Ovid's Apollo to Daphne could just as easily have been made by Calli- machus' Apollo: nescis, temeraria, nescis, quem fugias, ideoque fugis: mihi Delphica tellus et Claros et Tenedos Patareaque regia servit; Iuppiter est genitor. (Met. 1, 514-517) His argument against flight is a listing of cult sites and his parentage from Jove - the very stuff of the Hymn to Delos9. In Callimachus there is a chain of flight: Peneus and other local gods flee Apollo and Leto, as they in turn try to flee from thè power of Hera. In her desperation, Leto appeals to Peneus. In Ovid, Daphne flees Apol- lo, set in motion by thè power of Cupid. In her desperation, Daphne too appeals to Peneus. On one hand there is a literary parallelism, since in both poems wherever Apollo goes, what he désires flees before him; but there is also a redistribution: the desperate role of entreaty is trans- ferred from Apollo's behalf (by Leto) to Apollo's frustration (by Daph- ne). In the setting of the Métamorphoses, Cupid has taken on Hera's role as the instigator of the pursuit and flight, but Apollo has also become a powerful god himself, so Daphne has now assumed the role of helpless Leto, seeking haven with Peneus to avoid a greater deity. Hence an Ovi- dian irony: Apollo whose expérience in the Hymn to Delos should have taught him a deep appréciation for sanctuary refuses to grant Daphne a moment of rest. Ovid's version of Apollo-Daphne is the first one extant with Peneus (not Ladon) as Daphne's father, and the Thessalian (instead of Arcadian) locale is probably also an innovation10. The prominent role of the new 8. The Homeric Hymn to Apollo also cataloguée! Leto's wanderings, but P. Bing, p. 116, properly points out that in Callimachus, «thè story of Leto's journey (v. 70-204) is more ecumenical and almost nine times as long as its archaic counterpart». I have not tried to disentangle Callimachus' use of the Homeric Hymn, Ovid's reworking of Callimachus's use and Ovid's direct acknowledgements of the Homeric Hymn. The existence of a Helle- nistic treatment does not negate additional Ovidian allusion to the Homeric Hymns, as dem- ostrated by Hinds, but surely the colorful narrative and digressive quality of the Callimachean journey are thè more immediate source for Ovid's pursuit of equal length. 9. F. Williams, art. cit. p. 251, compares the list of Apollo's technai at Met. 1, 517-21 with Callimachus' summary at Hymn 2, 42-6. 10. Charles E. Murgia (Ovid Met. 1.544-547 and the Theory of Double Recension, «Classi- cal Antiquity» 3, 1984, pp. 207-35) gives the most récent summary: «A lack of apparent motive for any poetic predecessor, and a complete ignorance among ancient Greek witnes- ses of Ovid's version, amid a fairly rieh quantity of attestation of Apollo's relationship to Daphne, makes the theory that Ovid originated his variant the one best supported by cur- rently available évidence», p. 227. Another récent summary of thè scholarship (which re-</page><page sequence="5">Callimachus and Ovid 147 father Peneus in Ovid's account effectively gives us a sensé of Daphne's psychology and the extent of her distress. Yet a scholarly focus on Daphne has hindered interest in Peneus; but if he is an innovation, why so? Charles Murgia suggests the appeal of Thessaly: «Ovid had a special need for the change of locale, both to reconcile the différent aetiologies of the crown- ing with laurei and to provide a connection with the slaying of Python and Io. By choosing Peneus over Ladon he was also able to draw on a relatively rieh Latin poetic tradition, including Catullus 64, 285 ss. and Verg. G. 4, 317, 35 1»11. But more important than locale are the charac- ters which the Georgics provides - Cyrene, a nymph, daughter of Pe- neus, who was Apollo's primus amor according to Pindar Paian 9, and a young man (hère her son Aristaeus) pleading for help. In particular Georg. 4, 355 s. (tristis Aristaeus Penei genitoris ad undam/stat lacrimans) suggests Virgil is an intermediary in the development of Peneus' rôle. Richard Thomas rightly comments: «The words would be suitable to a treatment of Daphne, the daughter of Peneus, who reaches his banks and asks for help»12. Since Cyrene lives in the river Peneus (thalamo subflu- minis alti, Georg. 4, 333), Ovid's new genealogy sets Apollo wooing Daph- ne on the same banks he wooed Cyrene. But what is the tradition of Peneus as a character? Apparently no one has noted that he is already well developed as a helper of the refugee by this Callimachean Hymn. When Peneus Starts to flee from Leto (in the last of the 8 occurrences of φεύγειν in the hymn, for in both épisodes thè climax is reached when Peneus décides to answer the plea made of him), she beseeches him and his daughters: Νύμφαι Θεσσαλίδες, ποταμού γένος, είπατε πατρί κοιμήσαι μέγα χεϋμα, περιπλέξασθε γενείω 110 λισσόμεναι τα Ζηνος εν ΰδατι τέκνα τεκέσθαι. Πηνειέ Φθιώτα, τι νυν άνέμοισιν ερίζεις; ώ πάτερ, ου μήν Ι'ππον άέθλιον άμφιβέβηκας. ή ρά τοι ώδ' αίει ταχινοί πόδες, ή έπ' έμείο μοΰνον έλαφρίζουσι, πεποίησαι δε πέτεσθαι 115 σήμερον έξαπίνης; Perhaps most important is Leto's regard for Peneus as 'father'. Seeing the river, she begins by asking the nymphs to talk to their father (είπατε πατρί, 109) and a few lines later she addresses him with the title directly volves around 1, 544-547) is J.

Thomas, Georgics, Cambridge 1988, s.v. 4, 355.</page><page sequence="6">148 Jeffrey Wills (ώ πάτερ, 113). In this way Leto is a model for Daphne, tired from flight, imploring Peneus' aid13: viribus absumptis expalluit illa citaeque 543 vieta labore fugae spectans Peneidas undas 544a «fer, pater» inquit «opem, si flumina numen habetis. 546 qua nimium placui, mutando perde figuram!» 547 The visible and parallel rôle of Peneus, 'father' to both Leto and Daph- ne, helps effect Ovid's altération of Callimachus. Daphne's conditional {si flumina numen habetis) may even jest at what would hâve happened if Callimachus' Peneus had obeyed Leto's request that τα Ζηνος εν υδατι τέκνα τεκέσθαι (111). Peneus who was willing but unable to help Leto when pregnant with Apollo (122-132), now readily assists Daphne in escaping Apollo. Or does he? Peneus changes her figura, but not the appealing aspect of it (qua nimium placuit) which Daphne speeifieally cited. The well-intentioned ineffectiveness of Peneus we see in the Hymn to Delos seems to carry over into the Métamorphoses. But his effort at flight is trans- ferred to his daughter. Leto asks Peneus why he strives with the winds (τι νυν άνέμοισιν ερίζεις; 112) - is it only in flying from her (έπ' έμεΐο μουνον)? No, Ovid might answer, for his daughter flies just as fast from her son (fugit odor aura, 502) 14. After finding Peneus unresponsive, Leto continues her plaint (118-20) Πήλιον ώ Φιλύρης νυμφήιον, άλλα συ μεΐνον, μεΐνον, έπεί και θήρες εν ού'ρεσι πολλάκι σεΐο ώμοτόκους ώδΐνας άπηρεισαντο λέαιναι. Compare thèse Unes with Apollo's opening address to Daphne (504-6): nympha, precor, Penei, mane, non insequor hostis; nympha, mane, sic agna lupum, sic cerua leonem, sic aquilam penna fugiunt trepidante columbae 13. Daphne's pallor (expalluit, 453) may look back to the colorless cheeks (ύπόχλοον εσχε παρειήν, 80) of a Callimachean nymph frightened when Helicon refuses Leto. Contrast Daph- ne's earlier blushing request of Peneus for virginity (pulchra uerecundo suffunditur ora rubo- re, 484). The text of 544-7 is much disputed - whether Daphne addresses Peneus or Tellus (vieta labore fugae, Tellus ait, bisce, vel istam/quae fach ut laedar, mutando perde figuram) or both. See Murgia, art. cit. and Blansdorf, art. cit. for the latest discussions. If correct, the parallel with Callimachus supports the authenticity of fer pater etc. (which is not much doubted since Peneus's relationship to Daphne is mentioned from beginning to end, at 452, 472, 481-2, 504, 525, and 569 ss.). For our purposes, a double appeal to Tellus and Peneus could be seen as imitating the structure of Leto's double appeal to the nymphs and Peneus. 14. In a long and famous simile (533-8), Ovid also compares Daphne to a canis Gallicus; perphaps it is only a coïncidence that a simile in the Hymn to Delos compares Iris to a hunt- ing dog of Artemis (288-236). Apollo overcame Iris, as he is about to overcome Daphne. For the infrequency of extended similes in Callimachus, see Bing cit., pp. 123-4.</page><page sequence="7">Callimachus and Ovid 149 Apollo's words to Daphne, mannered with parenthèses, separated imper- atives, and a literary sophistication which the ordinary woodland lover in pursuit might hâve omitted, include the same répétition from Cali. Hymn 4 (μείνον, / μείνον) and a self-comparison with lions.15 Leto asks merely for equal treatment with lions; apparently in response, Ovid gi- ves Apollo exactly that, equal treatment with a lion. In the end, Leto excuses Peneus with the pardon «may you not suffer sorrow on account of me» (151-2): σώζεο* μη συ γ* εμεϊο πάθτ)ς κακόν εΐ'νεκα τήσδε άντ' ελεημοσύνης* χάριτος δέ τοι εσσετ' αμοιβή. These Unes are changed imo Apollo's concern for Daphne (508-9): me miserum. ne prona cadas indignaue laedi crura notent sentes et sim tibi causa doloris. The two-line sentence structures here are similar: exclamatory appeal, prohibition reaching imo the next line, the conséquences {sim tibi = τοι εσσετ'). The fulfillment of Leto's final promise to Peneus, that she will return his kindness, is left unexpressed in Callimachus. However, Ovid would seem to satisfy this promise a génération later by Connecting the Leto-Peneus story to Apollo's dévotion to thè laurei tree - that is, her son's dévotion to his daughter. Ovid's reattribution of Daphne as a daughter of Peneus (rather than of Ladon) introduces an anachronistic irony into our reading of Calli- machus. Leto's plea to the daughters of Peneus must now, for the Ovid- ian audience, include a plea to Daphne. Accordingly, we see a possible effect of Ovid's allusion to Callimachus: the nympha Daphne has fled from Apollo before. Ovid establishes his originality by telling a story that is new and simultaneously old, but old only because his new genea- logy has changed Callimachus' characters, allowing us to reread the Hymn to Delos with Daphne as one of the Νύμφαι Θεσσαλίδες. Since the new laurei serves as Ovid's first metamorphosis of a god's beloved, we should not omit a look at the thème that frames Leto's flight: the metamorphosis of Asteria into Delos. Near the beginning of Calli- machus' hymn we are given Asteria's aetion at lines 36-8: οΰνομα δ' ην τοι Άστερίη το παλαιόν, έπεί βαθύν ήλαο τάφρον ούρανόθεν φεύγουσα Δ toc γάμον αστέρι ίση. So the hymn's prelude to Leto's flight is the flight of Asteria from Zeus, 15. F. Williams, art. cit. pp. 250-1, notes the use of the analogy from the naturai world as a commonplace from pastoral poetry (e.g. Theoer. Idyll 10, 30 s.).</page><page sequence="8">150 Jeffrey Wills strikingly similar to that of Daphne fleeing marriage to Apollo (490)16. In fact, Ovid teils us that Daphne 's eyes were sideribus similes (499), a possible écho of αστέρι Ιση. As Asteria tells us herseif at thè end, she will now be honored by Apollo, and no more shall wander (και εσσομαι ούκέτι πλαγκτή, 273). Could thèse not be thè words of Daphne? Like thè story of Daphne, the Hymn to Delos is essentially a metamorphosis of flight into stability accompanied by Apollo's dévotion. In both cases flights arose from the amorous attention of an Apollo or a Jupiter. Both the hymn and the Daphne épisode end with Apollo's récognition of new cuit associations - Delos and thè laurei - but Ovid reverses the détails of Callimachus' ending. Asteria's proclamation of the end of her wandering elicits Apollo's silent approvai at the breast (266-73). Ovid, how- ever, suppresses Daphne's voice after her transformation, so Apollo must give the paean, after which the embraced Daphne silently consents17. «...et visent longas Capitolia pompas. 561 postibus Augustis eadem fidissima custos ante fores stabis, mediamque tuebere quercum. utque meum intonsis caput est iuuenale capillis, tu quoque perpetuos semper gère frondis honores». 565 finierat Paean. factis modo laurea ramis adnuit, utque caput visa est agitasse cacumen. Thus, Ovid's taie ends with thè new laurei nodding her head in consent to Apollo's vow (567). Anthropomorphic trees are ordinary features of the Ovidian landscape, but it may be worth comparing a similar Calli- machean action, reversed of course. In response to Leto's entreaty, Heli- con is seen to shake its foliage in refusai with similar words (ως ιδε χαίτην / σειομένην Ελικώνος, 81-2)18. When Helicon shakes, a Callimachean nymph dancing around a coeval oak grows pale19. At the end of Ovid's taie we find the nymph Daphne guarding the oak {mediamque tuebere quercum, 563) and shaking her own foliage. The laurei which never loses 16. Bing cit., pp. 96-110, provides a füll study of Callimachus' treatment of thè Asteria myth. Note that Asteria's desire for purity, her independence in refusing Zeus, her leap into the waters, and her final stability ail hâve parallels in Daphne. 17. Callimachus' fourth Iamb. (fr. 194, 24-36) provides an example of the encomium the laurei could give itself. See F. Williams, art. cit. pp. 254-5 for Ovid's use hère of that passage and thè politicai iconography. 18. These words hâve sometimes been taken as indicating that Helicon also Starts to flee, but I follow Mineur, Callimachus: Hymn to Delos («Mnemosyne» Suppl. 83), Leiden 1984, s.v. in assuming only a sign of refusai (opposite Ovid's adnuit). The linguistic parallelism of mountain and tree is clearly demonstrated when Ovid reuses caput and cacumen in 4, 659 to describe Atlas. 19. Some take Callimachus' δρυς as a generic tree, but Ovid read it as an oak when he used the dryads dancing around the oak of Ceres in his Erysichthon épisode (Met. 8, 746, 777-9), which is also verbally connected hère (adnuit... capitis, 8, 780).</page><page sequence="9">Callimachus and Ovid 151 its leaves (tu quoque perpetuos semper gère frondis honores, 565) explicitly reverses Callimachus' oak without leaves (Νύμφαι δ' αύ κλαιουσιν, δτε δρυσιν ούκέτι φύλλα, 85)20. There is also a Callimachean parallel for Ovid's nodding tree: Οίον ο τώπόλλωνος εσείσατο δάφνινος δρπηξ, οία δ' δλον το μέλαθρον έκας έκας όστις άλιτρός. και δή που τα θύρετρα καλώ ποδί Φοίβος άράσσει* ούχ όράας; επένευσεν ό Δήλιος ήδύ τι φοίνιξ (Cali. Hymn 2, 1-4) When transferred to Rome, the opening of Callimachus' Hymn to Apol- lo becomes an excellent sacral ending for Ovid (561-7), with the trem- bling laurei (laurea), the shrine (Capitolia), the doorframe (postibus Augustis... ante fores) and the nodding tree (adnuit)21. Although Ovid's Daphne narrative may draw more from the Hymn to Delos, it is not atyp- ical that Ovid's ending combines images from several Callimachean sour- ces. Rome, it would appear, is the successor to both Delos and Delphi. We hâve discussed the reasons for thinking Ovid introduced Peneus into the Daphne story on account of his rôle as a sympathetic character. His importance is seen by thè fact that he actually outlasts Daphne as a character in Ovid's epic, for he serves as a bridge to the metamorpho- sis of another river god's daughter (Inachus' Io). After the metamorpho- sis of Daphne, Ovid gives us a description of Peneus' valley and of the mighty river sitting among his nymphs for fifteen lines (568-582). Ovid paints Peneus in the same language with which Callimachus first intro- duced him (uocant Tempe; per quae Peneus... uolvitur, 569-70; Πηνειός έλισσόμενος δια Τεμπέων, 105). There other rivers come to visit him, with a typical Ovidian touch, not knowing whether to congratulate or con- 20. Ovid's répétition of Nympha in 504-5, noted above, further suggests référence to lines 84-5. As Bing states (cit., p. 41), «With the symmetry of thèse verses, Callimachus stresses thè special sympathy between nymphs and trees». Ovid also leads into the Daphne épisode by mentioning a progression from the oak to thè laurei (aesculeae capiebat frondis hono- rem. /nondum laurus erat, 449-50). Why this oak at the beginning and end? Perhaps because Callimachus' nymphs worship the oak, since before Apollo's birth there cannot yet be a laurei. Cf. Borner on 1, 449 «Eine Parallel-Überlieferung über den Eichenranz in Delphi ist mir nicht bekannt»; Lee on 1, 450, «The détail about the oak-wreath seems to be an ingenious invention of O.'s to pave the way for the next metamorphosis». The Augustan associations of the oak (on which see B. Curran and F. Williams, Laurel Boughs, «Liverpool Class. Monthly» 6, 1981, pp. 9-12), which frames the Daphne épisode (hère and line 563), do not preclude a literary association as well. 21. Shortly before this, in Met. 1, 553-6 Apollo touches the still-trembling laurei (cf. Cali.

Five Thessalian rivers meet him but not Inachus (579-80); thèse parallel thè five Boeotian rivers which flee Leto, in addition to Inachus (75-8)22. We also see this tradition of river catalogues in VirgiPs list of 8 rivers {Georg. 4, 363-73, thè longest sen- tence in the poem) and Ovid's extended treatment of 27 rivers when Phae- thon lost control of the sunchariot (Met. 2, 241-59). Callimachus' prose work on the rivers of the known world was a leading example of this tradition and probably influential on thèse Augustan passages23. But Ovid has also wandered into this terrain before the Métamorpho- ses. In Amores 3, 6, 23 ss., the poet uses examples of rivers which hâve fallen in love to try to persuade the river which impedes him from his beloved to abate its flood. Κ. Sara Myers and E. Courtney hâve sugges- ted that the mention of both Peneus and Inachus in a setting where a river is asked to subside may be an allusion to Callimachus' Hymn 4, 68 ss.24. Apparently Ovid early found the Hymn to Delos of literary interest and was particularly engaged by riverside appeals. Jupiter, Io and Callisto In the weave of the Métamorphoses no story stands by itself . In particular the acknowledged inteconnections of the Daphne, Io, and Callisto épi- sodes would suggest that a source for one may become a source for the others25. It should not be ignored that the parallelism of Apollo and Ju- piter in thèse taies plays on their kinship, "tel fils, tel père", a father-son relationship treated in Callimachus' Hymn to Delos and its Homeric pré- cèdent. When Ovid begins his amatory epic with a story of Apollo, he knowingly violâtes the conventional primàcy of Jove (in time and de- gree) in the sphère. If we can also read primus amor Phoehi with an objective genitive26, then there is a jest that Phoebus' own parentage ac- tually takes chronological precedence as a story of love (luppiter est geni- tor, 517); Leto certainly ranks ahead of Daphne as a divine concubine, and ahead of Io and Callisto as a mate of Jupiter. When Ovid is finished with the Daphne épisode, he continues to bor- row from the Leto story. The transition to thè story of Inachus' daugh- ter Io is accomplished by a gathering of rivers at Peneus' cave, from which 22. That the two river gods Peneus and Inachus both pour out tears is noted by Eggers cit., p. 167. 23.

As, for example, in ingemuit cari grauiter genitoris amore (Aen. 10, 789).</page><page sequence="11">Callimachus and Ovid 153 the absence of Inachus must be explained. In Callimachus' collection of rivers in the Hymn to Delos, Inachus is highlighted as particularly belong- ing to Hera (74); this détail becomes ironie in Ovid's story of Inachus' daughter Io, persecuted by Juno. Io, in the pattern established by Daphne soon fiées from Jupiter (ne fuge me! fugiebat enim, 597) and the literary legacy of Asteria-Leto con- tinues. In fact, the narrative mechanism of flight (with its elegiac overto- nues) unités the divine love escapades. As subjects oifugere, etc., we find Io (597, 600, 641); Syrinx (701); Callisto (2, 443, 492); and Coronis (2, 576, 594)27. What most propels the plot of the Hymn to Delos is Hera's jealousy at a rival bearing Zeus' son. Although irrelevant to Daphne's story, the stories of thè pregnant Io and Callisto can take füll advantage of it. The Hellenistic poet sets forth the situation in an address to Delos (55-8): ούδ' "Ηρην κοτέουσαν ύπέτρεσας* ή μεν άπάσαις δεινον έπεβρωμάτο λεχωισιν αϊ Ad παΐδας έξέφερον, Λητοΐ δε διακριδόν, οΰνεκα μούνη Ζηνί τεκεΐν ήμελλε φιλαίτερον "Αρεος υια. Since Asteria (Delos) and Leto are clear prototypes for the situations of Io and Callisto, Ovid can exploit the parallels with little effort. Heavy with Apollo and hated by Hera, Leto vainly Stretches out her arms for help (106-9): "Ηρη, σοι δ' ετι τήμος ανηλεές ήτορ εκείτο ούδε κατεκλάσθης τε και ωκτισας, ηνίκα πήχεις αμφότερους ορέγονσα μάτην εφθεγζατο τοΐα' «Νύμφαι Θεσσαλιδες, ποταμού γένος είπατε πατρί...» Like Leto, Callisto is bearing the son of Jupiter against Juno's will. The persecuted Callisto also Stretches her arms in vain, only winning them black hairs (2, 477). Poor Io's effort is yet more frustrated, for she lacks both Leto's arms and voice (non habuit quae bracchia tenderei Argoy/et conata mugitus edidit ore, 1, 636 s.). Like Leto, raped by Jupiter and harassed by Juno, Io appeals for help to daughter nymphs and a river god who does not hear (Νύμφαι 27. In the intervening (but not unconnected) tale of Phaethon, we even find the Nile in flight from the chariot of Apollo (Nilus in extremum fugit perterritus orbem, 2, 254) - a possible allusion to the rivers fleeing Apollo's birth in the Hymn to Delos. See the discus- sion above about Callimachus' catalog of rivers. Additionally, in the Hymn to Delos (185-7) Ptolemy's rebel mercenaries perished by fire along the banks of the Nile - Ovid's Nile may not want another tragic pyre. The Callimachean connection of Delos or the Inopus with the Nile is also made at lines 206-8 and 263 (see Bing cit., pp. 136-9), suggesting a paral- lelism between the persecuted Io resting at the Nile and persecuted Leto at the Inopus. Ovid has also verbally connected the Nile's flight at line 2, 254 with Io's flight: profugam per totum terruit orbem. / ultimus immenso restabas, Nile, labori (1, 727-8).</page><page sequence="12">154 Jeffrey Wills Θεσσαλιδες, ... Πηνειέ... ό 8' άνήκοος; cf. Naides ignorant, ignorât et Ina- chus ipse, 642). The river gods, Peneus and Inachus, are both willing to help but are prevented from doing so by Juno's mountain-top guardians: Argus watching Io and Inachus (1, 666-7): ipse procul montis sublime cacumen occupât, unde sedens partes speculatur in omnes. Ares watching Leto and Penus (4, 62-4): ό μεν πέδον ήπείροιο ήμενος υψηλής κορυφής επι Θρήικος ΑΙ'μου θοΰρος "Αρης εφύλασσε It is hard to believe that Ovid's Argus did not take lessons from Calli- machus' Ares28. In thè end, however, Juno's guardians do not prevent either lady from hearing thè child of Jupiter any more than they prevent- ed Leto from hearing Apollo. Hymn to Delos We mentioned at thè outset thè importance of elegy and recusatio in thè Daphne épisode. But now we might further consider thè genre of hymn, already a flexible medium in thè hands of Callimachus. Not only was thè subject matter of thè Hymn to Delos appropriate to Ovid's tale, but thè form could serve as a model for aetiological metamorphosis. With- in a few hundred lines, a poet such as Callimachus could compose an épisode of divine adventure, with witty narrative leading to a semblance of final solemnity. To some extent, thè coment of Ovid's story properly constitutes a hymn to Apollo, with a listing of his attributes from his own mouth: lord of prophecy, thè lyre, thè arrow, medicine and even Capitoline processions (515-522, 558-565)29. One might say that Ovid has also createci an aetiological hymn to Daphne parallel to that of Delos, explaining how thè laurei rather than Delos carne to be associated with Apollo. In fact, thè épisode ends with Apollo's paean to Daphne (557-565); in traditional fashion this first paean begins with repeated second person pronouns (semper habebunt / te coma, te citharae, te nostrae, laure, phare- trae, 558-9)30. 28. Likewise Peneus points out thè vigilant Ares, still seated on thè mountain top (125-6): άπαύγασαι, οΐος εφεδρος/οΰρεος εξ υπάτου σκοπιήν έχει. The Callimachean version is, as Bing cit. p. 109 points out, itself an inversion of Pindar Paian 12, where Zeus sits atop the moun- tain to guard Leto against Hera's wrath. 29. Similarly, Jove introduces himself with relative clauses of self-praise: nec de plebe deo, sed qui caelestia magna/sceptra manu teneo, sed qui uaga flumina mitto (595-6). 30. Cf. Iris' mini-hymn to Hera at the end of Leto's travails (218 ss.), also with repeated 'Du-Stil der Prädikation'.</page><page sequence="13">Callimachus and Ovid 155 Although we might expect to find some attributes of Apollo mention- ed in any two Apollo stories, the éléments of Callimachean narrative reem- ployed by Ovid in the Daphne épisode are not the common stock of Apollo stories31. The fatherly figure of Peneus and Daphne's long flight from Apollo are conspicuous parts of Ovid's story which are shared with Callimachus' Hymn to Delos. When Ovid created a taie of Apollo's pri- mus amor, he naturally included the amor involved with Apollo's begin- nings (ah love) and the combined pathos and comedy of Apollo's swift mother Leto, echoed in the Daphne épisode32. The story's opening identifies the characters in terms of the two par- ents we see in Callimachus (452-4): primus amor Phoebi Daphne Peneia, quem non fors ignara dédit, sed saeva Cupidinis ira33. Delius hune, nuper vieta serpente superbus... Daphne is introduced with a patronymic Peneia, evoking Peneus from the Hymn to Delos04. Delius similarly recalls a parent of Apollo - his mother Leto, whose flight is known from that same hymn. More preci- sely near thè end of Callimachus' hymn, Asteria announces that Apollo will be called Delius and will love her above all others (268-73): αλλ' άπ' έμείο Δήλιος 'Απόλλων κεκλήσεται, ουδέ τις άλλη γαιάων τοσσόνδε θεώ πεφιλήσεται άλλω, ... 31. The claim that the fleeing nymph and her father Peneus are allusions to the Hymn to Delos does not erase the Delphic associations of other Apollonian motifs in the Ovidian passage. These verbal Delphic références, however, may also suggest the spécifie wording of the Hymn to Delos. Ovid keeps the same progression from Python to laurus (Pythia ρ e r - d ο m i t a e serpentis nomine... nondum laurus erat, 447-450) found in Calli- machus (ουδέ xi πω τέθνηκεν δφις μέγας... έρέω τι τομώτερον ή άπο δάφνης, 91-4) with transferrai of ουδέ τί πω to nondum. Of course, the generai combination of Delian and Delphic attri- butes is as old as the Homeric Hymn to Apollo and is not a special connection in itself. 32. The wit and amusement of Callimachus, sometimes forgotten amidst the learning, are explicated in regard to this hymn by K. J. McKay, Erysichthon: A Callimachean Comedy, («Mnemosyne» Supp. 7), Leiden 1962, pp. 146-86. For Ovid's debt to Callimachus' combi- nation of comedy and hymn, see Tissol (note 6 above). 33. It has been suggested by O. S. Due (Changing Forms. Studies in the Métamorphoses ofOvid, Copenhagen 1974, p. 112 note 98) that thèse opening lines may vaguely recali the exordium of the Aeneid. If so, the replacement of saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram by saeva Cupidinis ira may highlight Ovid's revision of Callimachus. Now it is Cupid not Hera who troubles Apollo's life. 34. Twice Daphne addresses her father, perhaps because her strong association with her father prevents other attachments. Such références to Daphne's father and to Apollo's birth- place Delos may even remind us of Apollo's own father Jupiter, présent directly or allusi- vely throughout the first book. As the first father we meet, Peneus is a Jovian parallel and contrast. Cf. Peneus' fatherly kindness in the metamorphosis of Daphne with Jupiter's treat- ment of Epaphus and Arcas.</page><page sequence="14">156 Jeffrey Wills ώς εγώ Άπόλλωνι* και εσσομαι ούκέτι πλαγκτή. Ovid's immediate use oiDelius seems designed to undercut thè episode's opening assertion oiprimus amor, alert us to further allusion to Callima- chus, and anticipate Daphne's similar end of wandering. We may see ano- ther possible référence to Callimachus in thè phrase primus amor Phoebi, which readers of Pindar's Pythian 9 would use to describe Cyrene, fami- liär to Roman poetry as thè eponym of Callimachus' homeland35. Thus not only thè wanderings of Leto, but also Delos' flight from Ju- piter's love and her later stability are backgrounds for thè metamorpho- sis of Ovid's Daphne36. Nicoli has asked «why Ovid selected thè Apollo-Daphne in particular to initiate thè 'Divine Comedy' rather than for example - working on thè principle of ab love - a story involving Jupiter37». An answer might be that Ovid acknowledges Jupiter 's prima- cy by allusion. Indeed thè conjunction oiprimus amor and Delius implic- itly recalls thè chain of Zeus' loves (Zeus-Delos must precede Zeus-Leto, Zeus-Leto précèdes any love of Apollo), so that with Apollo-Daphne Ovid rather properly launches his amatory epic in médias res. We hâve reason to think that as early as Amores 3, 6 Ovid found thè character of Peneus in thè Hymn to Delos of literary interest and that he was particularly engaged by riverside appeals. He surely knew thè as- sociation of Peneus as thè father of Cyrene, Apollo's first love in one version, and Virgil's treatment of an appeal beside thè river Peneus in Georg. 4, 315 ss. In writing his own story of Apollo's first love, it is not surprising that Ovid introduced Peneus as a new parent for Daphne and exploited thè parallelism that innovation created with Leto as parent of Apollo in Callimachus' Hymn to Delos: Daphne flees Apollo as Peneus fled Leto. In thè intervening génération, however, Apollo has grown in- to a powerful god, like Hera who persecuted his mother in Callimachus' Hymn. So Leto's appeal to Peneus for help in escaping from Hera is now ironically reassigned to Daphne, as she appeals to Peneus for help in escap- ing Apollo38. University of Wisconsin, Madison 35.
