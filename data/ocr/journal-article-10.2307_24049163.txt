Sites such as Shatial, Oshibat, Chilas Bridge, Alam Bridge, and Hunza-Haldeikish at pivotal river crossings on intra- and transregional routes attracted numerous visitors, but they were not exclusively Buddhists. Images of ornate stüpas, Bodhisattvas, and narratives of the Bud dha's past and present lives were dedicated as "religious offerings" in Brähml and Proto-Säradä inscriptions from the fourth through the seventh century by local patrons such as Kuberavähana and Sinhota at Thalpan and Chilas. Just as in Gandhära and along the "vieille route," localiza tion of the Sibi-, Vyäghri-, and Rsipancaka-jätaka stories transformed the landscape into a sacred geography. Illustrations of primary events in Säk yamuni's religious biography and portraits of previous Buddhas and prominent Bodhisattvas served as types of commemorative relics at way side shrines (caityas). Reports by Faxian and Xu anzang of a colossal wooden image of Maitreya indicate that this area was not merely a transit zone, since travelers and regional inhabitants worshipped at Buddhist shrines in the valleys and side valleys of the Upper Indus, Gilgit, and Hunza rivers. Buddhist Sanskrit manuscripts and bronze sculptures from the period of the Palola Sähis in the late sixth through the early eighth century reflect high levels of literary and artistic production with the support of élite patronage. During this late phase, Buddhist monasteries in Gilgit and the surrounding valleys were in con tact with the wider Buddhist world, particularly with Buddhist centers in Khotan, Baltistan, and Kashmir, and possibly with Bämiyän. As monks, pilgrims, merchants, soldiers, and other wayfar ers crossed permeable geographical and cultural boundaries between South and Central Asia by following a network of shifting routes, lines for the transmission of Buddhist art, texts, ideas, and practices frequently overlapped and crisscrossed one another. Conclusion Routes through the Karakorum mountain range in northern Pakistan provided alternative paths for the transmission of Buddhism to the "Vieille Route" across the Hindu Kush of Afghanistan. The model of gradual diffusion of Buddhism through Bactria and western Central Asia via the Silk Routes to China does not sufficiently explain links between Gandhära and eastern Central Asia exhibited, for example, in a version of the Gän dhäri Dharmapada imported to Khotan and in the use of the Kharosthi script and Gändhäri lan guage for literary and administrative documents in the southern Tarim Basin until the middle of the fourth century. Petroglyphs, inscriptions, and other materials from the Upper Indus and Gilgit regions show that pathways from Gandhära, Swat, and Kashmir to Xinjiang were utilized by Indian, Sogdian, Chinese, and (of course) local travelers. Therefore, diffusion of Indian Bud dhist architecture and iconography from western Central Asia to eastern Central Asia is an un necessary assumption, since more direct lines of transmission were available. This point is not in tended to deny the fact that significant cultural exchanges took place between western and east ern Central Asia evident, as in the adoption and transformation of Iranian motifs in paintings at Khotan and Miran. However, the flow of long distance trade and religious texts and images re flect complex lines of long-distance transmission to and from many points across interconnected capillary routes rather than unidirectional diffu sion along a few major arteries.

Hinüber in his presentation on "The Cultural Context of the Inscriptions from the Upper Indus" at the 13th World Sanskrit Conference (Edinburgh, Scotland, 13 July 2006). An inscription on the pedestal of an image of Prajnäpäramitä records a religious offering of Paramadevî sri Mangalahamsikä (Sotheby's Indian and Southeast Asian Art auction catalogue, April 1, 2005, p. 60, no. 50). A pedestal in scription in the Rubin Museum of Art records another religious offering of Paramadevî Mangalahamsikä to gether with srï Patoladeva Säha Vajrädityanandin, sri Torabhatärikä, and Mahägamjapati (treasurer) Ranä dhïra. Queen Mangalahamsikä (Mamgalahasirikä) and King Vajrädityanandin also appear in a manuscript col ophon (Hinüber, ANP 5, pp. 24-2-5, no. 9), but the text to which it belongs is uncertain. 102. Hinüber, ANP 5, pp. 28-31, no. 11 (Bronze of Varsa), Abb. 3; pp. 48-52, no. 22 (Hatun inscription), Abb. 18-19. 103. Ibid., pp. 52-57, no. 23 (Danyor inscription), Abb. 20-23. 104. Ibid., pp. 31-42, nos. 12-14, 16, Abb. 4-5, 7. 105. The figure of Prajnäpäramitä depicted in a sculpture donated by Paramadevî Mangalahamsikä also holds a manuscript in her left hand with namah prajnäpäramitäya inscribed on its leaves (Sotheby's Indian and Southeast Asian Art auction catalogue, April 1, 2005, p. 60, no. 50). Although the donor Man galahamsikä is not depicted, this image may also sug gest a link with Palola Sähi patronage of the copying of Buddhist manuscripts, which included Perfection of Wisdom texts such as the Astädasasähasrikä Prajnä päramitä (Hinüber, ANP 5, pp. 17-21, no. 6). 106. O. v. Hinüber, "Die Bedeutung des Handschrift enfundes bei Gilgit," pp. 49-50 points out that a donor holding an incense burner and kneeling below a seated Buddha image on one of the Gilgit manuscript covers resembles the depiction of the donor Sinhota kneeling below the image of Vipasyin in a petroglyph at Chilas Bridge. D. Klimburg-Salter observes that "The painted covers . . . would have served also as 'religious gifts', deyadharma, and in this sense would be analogous to the other devotional images . .
