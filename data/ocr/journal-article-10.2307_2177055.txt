Ph., XXVII, IO, PP. 329-358; XXVII, II, PP. 504-5i6. This inquiry naturally falls into two parts: first, an objective study of the activity of matter, organic as well as inorganic; and secondly, a study of the nature of knowledge. (I) In the first division of the inquiry, appeal is made to the atomic theory, the fruitfulness of which has demonstrated its legitimacy. No matter how far the division of a homogeneous and con- tinuous substance, like the imaginary substance of mathematics, is carried, the parts remain identical in form and behavior with each other and with the whole. The unit of measure is conventional, and a certain volume is great or small only in comparison with bodies arbitrarily chosen. But the case is different with certain other bodies, e. g., water. At a certain point in the process of division, water changes its properties, becoming something which is not water. It is possible, then, to find for water an absolute unit of measurement. This brings us to the molecular hypothesis of the struc- ture of bodies like water. A drop of water consists of a number of mole- cules which cannot be divided without losing their characteristic proper- ties. Of the inner structure of matter, this hypothesis teaches us nothing; only from the chemist do we learn to divide water into simpler elements, hydrogen and oxygen. We find it difficult to represent decomposition to ourselves, because we cannot compare it to any of the phenomena which we directly apprehend by sense. We instinctively represent atoms as motionless bodies, and think of movement as molar movement, forgetting that it is only by its molecular movements that matter manifests itself to us. Many are astonished at the apparent spontaneity of movement in living beings, when, as a matter of fact, it is only the result of a transformation of molecular into molar motion. Connected with the instinctive belief in the immobility of bodies is the anthropomorphic conception of force as a static source of activity. The truth is, that there are np static forces, but only transformations of motion. So the agencies at work in decomposition are</page><page sequence="2">344 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XII. not of static origin. Only in their reactions, however, do the chemical properties of bodies manifest themselves; we give the name of chemical repose to the periods separating the reactions, because during those periods the internal movements of the molecule are a sealed book to us. Action at a distance is an illegitimate conception, which gives support to the theory of vital forces in biology. Only by the transfer of motion from one to the other can there be a relation between two distant bodies. Biology has shown that every living being is constantly changing. This alone renders experimental proof of freedom impossible, showing, consequently, that a vitalistic theory cannot be based on the apparent spontaneity of animal movements. Animals, like other natural bodies, are transformers, not creators, of motion. We find in physics and chemistry all that is neces- sary to an understanding of vital phenomena; and, on the other hand, the belief in immaterial principles comes from inexact physical notions, e. g., the notion of force as static. The distinctive property of living bodies is a chemical one, namely, assimilation. Assimilation differs from chemical reaction in purely physical bodies in that it is marked by a reconstruction of molecules identical with those broken up. Life, then, is essentially chemical in nature. (2) The great law insisted upon in the second part of this inquiry is that we know only the movements of matter. If we have knowledge of a body which appears motionless, it is because its molar re- pose conceals its molecular motion. Our knowledge of a distant object results from modifications of our substance by movements carried from that object. In dealing with the question: How can a modification of out substance give rise to a sensation in us ? we ought to confine ourselves to verification, and not make any attempt at explanation; human explana- tions are only comparisons, and we can compare the faculty of knowledge with nothing but itself. Knowledge is limited on one side by the very great, and, on the other, by the very small. Beyond these limits lies the un- knowable, a domain indifferent to man, since only the knowable can act upon him. M. S. MACDONALD L'Idee d' objet. E. CHARTIER. Rev. de Met., X, 4, PP. 409-42I. To perceive is to know an object as the one source of manifold sensa- tions, to know something which no single sense can experience. There is for us no other object than the bond uniting the several sense-images into a unity. Thus, to know a so-called thing is to know a law, since a thin- is nothing but the image of a relation between our sensations and our movements. A being possessing only the sense of touch could reason about, but never perceive solidity. For such a notion supposes the activity of sight, by which to imagine the interior parts of a solid body which are not immediately tangible. But sight alone is equally helpless. To per- ceive a plane surface is to realize -through the suggestions made by the eyes -that any movement in a given direction would be accompanied by an impression of constant resistance. Otherwise expressed, a visual image</page><page sequence="3">No. 3.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 345 is the anticipation of a tactile impression. In the same way, to hear or taste is to be aware that we may see, feel, etc. That is, to perceive the universe at all we must tizik it, not merely theoretically but practically. Thus, perception depends upon the laws of the mind, rather than upon the properties of the senses. Only by showing that nature itself presupposes - if it be presented to consciousness -the principles found in knowledge, can the final agreement between mathematical deductions and experience be explained. Since to know the position of a body is to know the movements necessary to reach it, Kant's paradox, " space is before things," holds good. And as the precondition of the idea of any object is the idea of the whole universe, of indefinite space, it follows that space is indivisible. For if the knowlege of it as a whole precedes the knowledge of any particular point in it, space cannot be regarded as a sum of parts. A. D. MONTGOMERY. The Non-Existence of Matter. A. S. HAWKESWORTH. Westminster Re- view, CLVIII, 4, pp. 382-390. Metaphysical matter, as opposed to common matter that we feel and see, cannot exist. The atomic theory, as a theory of ultimates, evidently ab- stracts into meaningless absolutes, properties which have only a meaning as relatives. It speaks of only one matter, when all that we know are many matters. We cannot know the atomic matter, nor can the atom account for the outer world of objects. Our sensations of color, light, and heat, are, as shown by science, only produced by wave motions. Nothing else can affect our senses, and yet we term the synthesis of all our sensations mat- ter, while sensations are in reality subjective and caused by these wave motions. Moreover, atoms as dead matter can never produce these wave motions, nor again can any matter be conceived as causing them, for sensuous matter has been shown to be the product of these wave motions, and hence we cannot predicate them as its product. A transcendental theory of matter is also useless, for matter is what we touch and see. We may term the cause of the motions God or simply x, but we cannot employ the sensuous term ' matter' in this connection. R. B. WAUGH. Ueber segenannle relative Wa/irheiteit. K. TWARDOWSKI. Ar. f. sys. Ph., VIII, 4, PP. 4I5-448. Absolute truths are those judgments which are unconditionally true for all times and places, without any restrictions whatever. Relative truths, on the other hand, are such judgments as are true only under definite con- ditions and restrictions; they are not true always and everywhere. The fact that this is the meaning of the terms ' relative ' and ' absolute' is shown by the way in which these words are applied to other spheres than that of truth, e. g., beauty. In regard to the existence of relative truths, few people express doubt; many, indeed, maintain that relative truths are the only ones attainable by man, and that there are, for man at least, no</page><page sequence="4">346 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XII. such things as absolute truths. In opposition to this wide-spread view, the writer upholds the thesis that there are no judgments which would be true only under certain circumstances and conditions, and which would cease to be true and become false when these circumstances and conditions are changed; that, on the contrary, every true judgment is true always and everywhere, and, therefore, that judgments which are ' relative ' in the above sense never are, never have been, and never will be true. The relativists, or advocates of the theory of the existence of relative truths, base their arguments upon examples which seem to manifest only condi- tional truth. But closer analysis shows that the relativistic position rests upon a confusion of an inaccurate verbal proposition with the judgment itself as a psychic activity. The expressions chosen to illustrate the rela- tive character of truths are in fact nothing but abbreviations for the real judgments which they represent. If one says, for illustration, that 'this flower has an agreeable odor,' that ' cold baths are salutary,' or that ' it is raining,' the verbal statements omit essential elements that enter into the judgments of which they are the expression. The judgments themselves are but imperfectly or elliptically represented, since they include the so- called conditions as vital or essential parts of the psychic activity. No one but a I relativist' ever supposed that the statement, ' it is raining,' could ever become false; the judgment never implied that it was raining always and everywhere even when no conditions are mentioned. The judgment, when expressed exactly, would read that it is raining here and now, in a definite place and on a definite date, when one reckons according to a conventional calendar. The point to be noted is that such a judg- ment is either true or false. If once true, it can never become false. The so-called circumstances are not extraneous to the judgment, and the judgment, when exactly stated, is always true or always false. The application of such a logical criticism to 'relativistic ethics' is obvious. Every ethical judgment or moral norm, if once true, is always true, in spite of the fact that certain principles, which at one time and in certain states of society are regarded as moral, are at other times and under other circumstances condemned as immoral. Likewise, in the sphere of logic, when the relativists say that an hypothesis or theory is true only under certain circumstances, and may become false with a change of the conditions, the argument rests upon a confusion. An hypothesis is either true or false from the beginning, If it were false at the time of its assump- tion, it nevertheless appeared at that time to be the most probable of all possible hypotheses, on account of an incomplete knowledge of the facts. But if false, the identical hypothesis can never become true. Finally, rela- tivism cannot find support in epistemological subjectivism, i. e., it cannot be deductively proved from the nature of the psychophysical organism. A.

The problem indicated by the title of this article may be considered from the standpoint of genesis, or of validity. The notion of inner as opposed to outer reality, since it implies conceptual thinking, can only be developed by intersubjective intercourse. But the germ of the distinction is found in that experience of individuals which among all primitive peoples gives rise to animism. The theory of ' introjection to account for the process of 'inreading' is plausible but unconvincing: to say that internality is first assumed of the mental life of fellow beings, and then by analogy trans- ferred to personal experience, is to presuppose the original psychic impulse. As to the validity of the distinction, Kant maintains that outer sense is a necessary postulate: the contrasted permanence given by external percep- tion conditions the recognition of inner changes, and so the determination of ourselves in time. Dr. Caird's supposition is that inner is merely outer experience at a more highly articulated stage. But this overlooks the important qualitative difference, and inverts the order of development. The elementary fact is an active self, which gradually distinguishes its environment, and, by conceptual thought, postulates part of its total experi- ence as external. Reference of the percepts of various individuals to one and the same thing is only explicable upon the hypothesis of a transsub- jective reality. For obviously there is no constraining power either in the individuals themselves or in their abstract common experience as such. Thus, although objects are admittedly ideal constructions, these construc- tions can only be valid interpretations of an independent existence. A definite conception of reality is formed, and the unsatisfactoriness of Mill's 'permanent possibilities' and Kant's 'things-in-themselves' is avoided, when we, recognizing other human subjects as centres of thought or will, acknowledge manifold spiritual substances or causalities - subjects at lower developmental planes - upon whose activities the qualities of the known world depend. A perceiving subject can only represent the mutual deter- mination of different spiritual substances under the form of space, and must postulate time as the sole common term to which his own mental states and those of others can be reduced. So much validity has the spatial-temporal reference, involved in the dichotomy of phenomena. This account avoids the two errors of treating space and time as independ- ent reals or as mere subjective fictions. ANNIE D. MONTGOMERY. PSYCHOLOGY. Eine Wi'llenstheorie vomn volmntaristzschen Standtunkte. N. LOSSKY. Z. f. Ps. u. Phys. d. Sinn., XXX, i ti. 2, pp. 87-I33. Voluntarism may be defined as that tendency of psychology which de- clares that all phenomena of mental life which relate the individual con- sciousness to the ego take place according to the pattern of voluntary acts,</page><page sequence="6">348 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XII. that the acts of will are typical forms of conscious processes. In other words, in the realm of the ego there are no permanent states but only pur- posive acts. This commonly accepted definition, since it does not definitely outline its position, is held but tentatively. It is the business of voluntar- ism, as an empirical tendency, to more clearly define every one of the ex- pressions used, to precisely determine just what should be included under the concepts will, acts of the will, and ego. The acts of choice are taken as a starting point, since they contain the most highly differentiated ele- ments, and are therefore peculiarly characteristic. The analysis of typical instances shows that we may designate as voluntary all acts containing the following elements: (i) ' my' striving, (2) the feeling of ' my' activity, and (3) the changes which appear entirely, or partly, as the result of ' my' ego, although it is not always ' my ' state of consciousness. Each of these elements in turn must be analyzed before there is afforded a starting point for a theory. According to Pfdnder, one can designate as striving only those conditions of consciousness which have as their characteristic element a peculiar unanalyzable feeling of ' crowding in' which he called the striv- ing feeling. Efforts (or strivings) may be of three kinds: (i) those appar- ently proceeding directly from the ego and having the characteristics of freedom, decision, spontaneity, which may be called 'my ' efforts; (2) those ultimately proceeding from the ego, but occurring under the pressure of outside influences, which may be called efforts ' forced from me'; and (3) those which do not seem to originate in the ego at all, and can be designated as mine only in so far as my attention is directed upon them. These are termed efforts ' given me.' Further examination shows that, in one class of conscious states related to voluntary acts, the effort is accom- panied by a relatively pleasurable idea of the event which is the object of the impulse, while in another the anticipation of the resulting experience does not take the form of an idea, but is mere undifferentiated conscious- ness. The former, the 'known' effort, is a characteristic of impulses in general, while the latter, the ' unknown ' or merely conscious effort, occurs abundantly in mental life in the form of blind impulse. Passing to the feeling of activity, which is the connecting link between the effort and the corresponding change, it is found that, like all conscious states, it may have the character of being ' mine' or being ' given to me,' the former, or feel- ing of inner activity, characterizing voluntary muscular action, and such mental processes as reflection, recollection, etc., and the latter, or feeling of external activity, accompanying perceptions of the external world and many organic sensations. Analysis further shows that these feelings are distinct and separate, that the feeling of inner activity can in no sense be derived from the feeling of outer activity, neither is it a constituent part of the motor sensation, as first stated by Miinsterberg and others, but after- wards modified by him so as not to be contradictory to the purpose of voluntarism. The change which follows my effort and the corresponding feeling of activity is threefold: (i) one in which the change throughout</page><page sequence="7">No. 3.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 349 its whole extent appears to be ' mine,' ' my internal act'; (2) one in which the elements ' mine' and ' given me' are mingled, ' my incomplete inter- nal act'; and (3) a change in which the elements appear to be wholly ' given,' ' my external act.' The last-mentioned change is to be carefully distinguished from one which may be designated as an inner psycho-reflex act containing the idea which is the object of the effort, the feeling of effort, and an unconscious change corresponding to reflex action. Some psychol- ogists designate such phenomena ideo-motor acts ; but this term is too broad for the purpose of this article, since it may include all acts follow- ing upon the motor idea, and also too narrow, since it excludes psychical changes which are not accompanied by corresponding changes upon the periphery of the body. A complete analysis of the individual conscious- ness shows, in addition to the above described acts of the will and internal psycho-reflex acts, a third class of phenomena designated by the author as conscious states. To show the ultimate I Willenscharakter' of all mental life, there remains yet to consider only this last group of phenomena. A detailed examination of the cases to be considered leads to the follow- ing generalization: Each conscious state, in so far as it is perceived as 'mine ', contains all of the elements of voluntary acts, viz., ' my' effort, the feeling of ' my' activity, and a change accompanied by a feeling of relative satisfaction ; and it appears to be produced by me. A more careful survey of the general field also shows that, of all the elements of volitional acts, effort is the only one which can be perceived as ' mine' when not ac- companied by the others, which leads to the belief that it gives to the others this coloring, and forms a starting-point and cause for all psychical processes perceived as 'mine.' Growing directly out of this observation is the ultimate generalization and final definition of the position of volun- tarism, viz: All conscious processes, in so far as they are perceived as mine, contain all the elements of volitional acts and are the result of my effort. That what we may conveniently call the will sustains a causal relation to all such processes, would appear to be further substantiated by the fact that voluntary acts bear not only all of the marks claimed for the causal relation by empirical science, but also contain in addition the three following still more important characteristics : - (i) The relation here found not only preserves the chronological ordering of its events, as demanded by empirical science, but is also perceived immediately in the feeling of activity. (2) There occurs a peculiar correspondence be- tween cause and effect which justifies the designation of voluntary acts as purposive acts. (3) This relation always sustains a creative character. Thus the immediate feelings seem not to have deceived us in indicating the ultimate volitional character of the conscious life, but are corroborated by the results and inherent nature of purest induction in giving first place to voluntarism among the psychological tendencies. CLARENCE E. FERREE.</page><page sequence="8">350 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XII. Laehenseesans iznages. A. BINET. Rev. Ph., XXVIII, 2, Pp. I38-I52. This paper is an account of experiments made to determine the role played by images in ideation. The conclusions drawn from the experiments are as follows: The image is only a small part of the complex phenomenon to which the name thought is given. The illusory belief in the importance of representation for thought is due largely to the ease with which the mental image can be described. The psychology of Taine has popularized the idea that the image is a repetition of the sensation, and that we think in images. Moreover, the clinical studies of Charcot on aphasia have shown the distinction between visual, auditory, and motor images, and have in- creased the importance of the image in psychology. There is, no doubt, a sensory element in thought; but it is a mistake to over-emphasize its im- portance. To materialize thought is to render it unintelligible; the laws of ideas are not necessarily the laws of images; to think is not simply to be conscious of images; to attend is not simply to have one image stronger than others. The experiments have shown that certain thoughts occur without images; that in other thoughts the images illustrate only a small part of the phenomenon; and even that the image may not be coherent with the thought - one thing is thought and another represented. Added to, but separate from, the preceding discussion, is an hypothesis as to the mechanism of thought. Words presuppose a prior thought which directs and organizes them. On the other hand, words react on thought, giving it a precision which it would otherwise lack. Thought is an unconscious (in the sense of imageless) act of mind, which becomes fully conscious principally through the aid of words and images. But however difficult it may be to represent to ourselves a thought without the help of images, such a thought none the less exists. It constitutes a directive and organizing force comparable to the vital force which models the form of beings, and guides their evolution. M. S. MACDONALD. ETHICS AND /ESTHETICS. Die role de la logique en morale. F. RAUH. Rev. Ph., XXVIII, 2, Pp. I 2 I-I 37. An honest man aims at a certain unity in his acts, at logical consistency in his conduct. In morals, as in science, conceived systems of unity stand in need of experimental verification. This verification does not at all con- sist in the agreement between our ideas and a certain objective fact, but in the agreement between those ideas and a certain moral experience. In a book soon to be published, the author will show the conditions of this ex- perience, an undertaking which is as distinct from an analysis of the moral life as the rules of experimental method are from the work of the labora- tory. In this paper no more is aimed at than a glimpse at moral experi- ence. To be logical is (i) to be consistent in action, and (2) to persist in a belief, if there is no other reason for change than egoism or interest. Upon this principle is based a part of man's duties to himself and to oth-</page><page sequence="9">No. 3.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 3 5 I ers. It is not even necessary that the contents of an action be morally qualified, in order that a contradiction without reason or motived by inter- est appear immoral. We regard as despicable a man who changes his habits or clothes simply to please a superior. The cause is not far to seek. The tendency of a thought to maintain itself corresponds to a duty, namely, the duty of non-contradiction. The habitual or dominant in consciousness is for us the reasonable, which we cannot contradict without good grounds. Accordingly, the 'sentiment of rationality,' and, therefore, the conscious- ness of duty, can arise from any feeling or act whatever. The feeling of right arises in the same way. It is a feeling of expectation, the expecta- tion that others will do their duty towards me, springing, like the feeling of obligation or of rationality, from habitude or repetition. The rule of non- contradiction can, then, be laid down as an essential rule of moral thought. But this rule is subject to one condition: the moral belief in which one perseveres will always appear true only if opposed or limited by no other belief. In a conflict of duties, our decision is based, not upon any supposed superiority of one set of duties to another, but upon an experience which varies with the time and place. In such a case, the question which con- cerns the honest man is whether, in limiting one principle by another, a concession is made to reason or to interest. The name logic designates an operation different from that just described. I reduce two beliefs to a common belief, or extend to one domain of life a belief used in another. This principle of logical extension is distinct from the principle of non-con- tradiction. Logical extension, when really necessary, is to go no further than is required by objective experience in the theoretical, and by moral experience in the practical, sphere. It is often artificial. One belief can be attached to another by a characteristic which is common but superficial. This artifice may be resorted to for the purpose of self-deception. But it may also have a higher object, as when, to avoid disturbing accepted be- liefs, new ideas are disguised in the dress of the old. In this replacing by artificial synthesis the contradictions and the profound syntheses of belief, there lies the danger of perverting conscience and substituting Pharisaism for life. M. S. MACDONALD. La derriere dole (Elude sur la II Personnalife Divine"). ABBE M. HEBERT. Rev. de Met., X, 4, pp. 397-408. Modern thought protests against Christianity's last idol, a transcendent God. The fallacies of ecclesiastical logic -especially the a priori con- clusions of faith and desire - are strikingly illustrated in Thomas Aquinas' s proofs of the existence of a personal Deity. In his argument for God as a prime mover, the question is begged three times: (i) in the absolute separation of natura naturans from natura naturala; (2) in the spatial reference to a series of objects, each communicating its motion to another; (3) in the unwarranted substitution of movement ab alio for movement a se. The second proof- God as an efficient cause - makes cause synonymous</page><page sequence="10">3 52 THE PHIL OSOPHICAL REVIEW. with condition, while the arguments for a necessary cause, an ultimate reality, and a governing mind tacitly assume a supernatural being. But there is no authority for thus separating Deity from things. Reason pos- tulates, instead, a divine force, distinguishable from, but immanent in, nature, constantly striving towards perfection. Reality is its own law of evolution. The category of the ideal is not 'The world is God's realiza- tion,' but ' God is.' Such an objectification of the intrinsically unknow- able is excusable as being our only escape from subjectivism. Primitive despotism is largely responsible for the notion of a Divine Ruler; its gradual elimination is paralleled by the change from an implacable Jehovah to a heavenly Father. Yet Divinity is conceived of as personal through perfectly legitimate demands of the religious consciousness. Only thus does the notion become accessible to the masses. Metaphysics freely admits the practical advantages of such a representation, but rejects it as intellectually dangerous and not ultimate, pointing out its threefold error. (i) Reason is thereby dethroned in favor of faith. (2) A knowledge of the human personality is presupposed. Again, even granting such a knowledge, the denial of some human attributes to Deity invalidates the predication of any. (3) In the usual statement of the problem: Do con- sciousness, will, and personality properly pertain to God? the creator is already isolated from the creatures, and so the moot question is assumed. Yet theology and metaphysics are not mutually destructive. They satisfy distinct, but equally persistent, longings of humanity to know one inex- haustible truth. The danger is that the symbol should become an idol. A. D. MONTGOMERY.</page></plain_text>
