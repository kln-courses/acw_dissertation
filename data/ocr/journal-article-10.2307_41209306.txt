Because of space limitations, we cannot guarantee to print all letters received. - Editor Whatever destroys the qualitative (sometimes, by reducing it to the quantitative) is antihu- manistic, because humanism is predicated on the idea that man is not the sum of his parts. But mechanistic biology destroys the qualita- tive, denying that there is any element in or- ganisms other than those described in chemistry and physics. Therefore, mechanistic biology is antihumanistic. The biological orientation of René Dubos ["Humanistic Biology," AS: Spring, 1965] is es- sentially mechanistic. He wants no "surrender to hoary vitalistic theories." Accordingly, it is really an antihumanist biology. It has some teleological touches simply because Dubos al- lows himself to disregard the consequences of his fundamental orientation now and then. In the last resort, however, his article says that the biological governs the psychological - the oppo- site of what a humanist would say. Robert B. Nordberg Marquette University • • • Dr. René Dubos published a fascinating ar- ticle about humanistic biology in your Spring issue. I wish that he had given his views about the relevance of behavioral research to all this. Does he imply that only humanists would deal with such matters? Does he imply that this sort of thing is for the loner as opposed to the teamer? I assume that the answer to both of these questions is "Yes." Behavioral research, as applied to education, psychology and sociology, has standards for validity and objectivity that make these things outside the province of "science." If even they are sqeamish about such things, how can Dubos expect biologists to follow his suggestions? Does he expect them to do so? Perhaps, his article appears in this particular publication because its readers would be willing to study these matters integratively. I realize that Dubos is suggesting that he would define science in such a way as to in- clude these matters. If so, how is he to satisfy the scientists that whatever is concluded is proved? Does he really expect them to lose caste and break faith with the basic tenets of science? No doubt, there are biologists who would be willing to step out of the role of scientists and try being humanists. In this new role, would they be able to compete with the humanists? Dubos did very well indeed as one; he failed, however, to come to terms with the question of the techniques to be employed in the new kind of science that he proposes. If Dr. Dubos would now tell us just how one goes about what he proposes, without duplicating the efforts of the behavioral sci- ences, he would deserve to be heard by people in all the fields involved. He, certainly, should give it a try. James W. Russell Loyola university ♦ ♦ ♦ Reprinting the Phi Beta Kappa-Sigma Xi ad- dress of René Dubos before the American As- sociation for the Advancement of Science was a distinct contribution to anyone who is trying to find his way into the future. When I read Dubos' statement that "aes- thetic consciousness depends on innate faculties which are biological in essence," I was reminded of my vain search for musical criticism which, beyond evaluations of style, technique, tonal equipment, et cetera, would take off from the impact of sound waves on the human ganglia and the rhythm of the heart beat. Someone once long ago said to me (it may 509</page><page sequence="2">THE READER REPLIES have been Max Eastman) that the effectiveness of the Funeral March in the Chopin В flat minor Sonata arises from its direct impact on the viscera - the collection of ganglia behind the stomach called the Solar Plexus. But that distinguished critic of his time, James Huneker, in his introduction to the Sonatas in the Schirmer 1895 edition, was con- tent to say "... Chopin has seldom been so realistic as here; the bell-like basses and the morbid funeral coloring." A Washington Post critic, passing on the merits of Schuller's "Music for Brass Quintet," speaks of "that obvious neuroticism that seems to be the blatant mark of our generation." Perhaps someday the critic will be equipped to go on from there. Ralph Block Washington, D. С * * * Ihab Hassan deserves all praise as a critic of contemporary American letters, but I must protest that in "The Novel of Outrage" [AS: Winter, 1964-65] he is making a metaphysical mountain out of an old American tradition. The force that pervades and connects most of the books he treats of is only an aggravated case of the same gynephobia that has run through American romance since its beginnings. Writers, particularly Americans, who hate women indulge in fantasies of annihilation and union with a threatening void. The imagery of sterility with which Mr. Hassan clothes his con- clusion appears to indicate that he knows as well as anyone that sex antagonism is the source of these ideas, but prefers not to say so. Rather more tentatively, I question the sug- gestion of Sade's influence of these writers. Their attitude appears to me less the aloofness of the magnificently contemptuous aristocrat ♦♦♦*♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦•♦♦*♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦ $ AU European Cars :*: V Send for free master catalog about buying or rent- Y V ing a car for Europe.

The middle classes have pretty well cornered contempt, in current society. Finally, while I do not suggest that anyone "ignore their lurking presences/' and while I am aware that it would be gross stupidity to discount the homosexual element in the Amer- ican creative consciousness, I am surprised that Mr. Hassan blames it on intellection. The con- clusion sounds better suited to a country editor than to a leading intellectual. Whatever the faults of the American intellectual community, no very great part of it moves to the melody the fairy pipers play. John T. Flautz Cedar Crest College • • • I am writing to you with reference to Ernest Werner's very excellent essay, "Remod- eling the Protestant Ministry," in the Win- ter issue of the Scholar. As I am not one who indulges himself ordinarily in letters to the editor, let me first, as a Protestant minister, express my appreciation for the publication of such an articulate and passionate treatment of a well-known problem. That a journal whose appeal is primarily to the academic world takes such serious notice of the ministry of the Prot- estant church is not only surprising and flatter- ing, but deeply encouraging as well. You have my gratitude. Thomas W. Clayton Jasper, Indiana • • • Ernest Werner's "Remodeling the Protestant Ministry" [AS: Winter, 1964-65] is an outstand- ing article in an issue even more thought- provoking than usual. Mr. Werner observes: "The minister's difficulty is that he does not know in any serious or joyous way where to find the community he still believes in." It is my conviction that such community is closer to achievement than Mr. Werner implies. Forty or fifty years ago there was a revolution in language at least as far-reaching as the pres- ent revolution in mathematics. Schools are now discovering that children cannot communicate with their parents about arithmetic. Is it not possible that changes in the meaning of words used to describe religious experiences erected similar barriers between generations which have not yet been broken down? If this had occurred, the result one would expect is the very situation Mr. Werner so rightly deplores. Religious ex- 510</page><page sequence="3">THE READER REPLIES penence has largely dropped out of the ma- terial of contemporary communication - even between ministers and their congregations. But this state of affairs is not necessarily permanent. We expect that some children taught "new math" will eventually become mathematicians and teachers, even though they now have difficulty in discussing fractions with their parents. A generation of young people has now grown up to whom the revolution in the language of religion is history. It is their op- portunity to develop the new spiritual vo- cabulary by creative scholarship and teaching. Mr. Werner's article is an encouraging exam- ple of the thoughtful questioning that can reopen communication about religious mat- ters, and thus begin to create the community he is seeking. Alice P. Kenney Cedar Crest College Ernest Werner in "Remodeling the Prot- estant Ministry" in the Winter Scholar deals with the problem of the secularization of modern life. Walter Goodman's review of Cold Friday does the same from another angle. Both essays evade, I think, the crucial issue although Goodman admits the existence of the basic symptom of modernity, the worship of the machine. The unanswered question re- mains: should this or should it not be con- sidered a poor solution? What is wrong with worshiping Machine? (Machine of all Machines. The ideal: Platonic, distant, abstract.) It is after all only another metaphor for God. In the past gods had to be anthropomorphic because there were no ma- chines upon which to base a religious vision, but times have changed. Goodman asks ". . . who, after all, would give up his life for a gasoline engine ... ?" The carnage on our roads provides the answer even though an automobile is not the Machine of Machines, only a concrete example of the ideal. I would wager that even Goodman himself has at times felt or spoken of himself and his car as a single unit. ("Oh, I get thirty miles a gal- lon," et cetera.) This is a minor point but es- pecially important because it is minor. On a higher theological plane there remain of course the rituals dealing with the sacrificial rite of grand prix racing. I am not suggesting that Werner go out and organize a Church of the Machine and re- vitalize his ministry this way, although I expect he would achieve great success along these lines; 3he Most LDisíínguíslzeo Jnark in ^jraíerniti] Jewelry OFFICIAL JEWELER TO PHI BETA KAPPA CÍ^/¿)mMá/umpam A 1 1 L t Б О К 0, // MASSACHUStítS ¿/ ALLEGHENY COLLEGE Home of Eta of Pennsylvania, Phi Beta Kappa Bentley Hall, named for the Reverend William Bentley of Salem, Mass.

Since I do not own a functioning crystal ball, hence do not know what the future will be, I cannot comment upon the desirability or the undesirability of these trends. After all, the best poets of our age have remained neutral also. Yeats's Second Coming may be a phenomenon arousing the emotions, but he does not judge it; and Spengler introduces his concept of the New Religiosity in almost an offhand fashion. All in all, an interesting issue. VALDIS A. AUGSTKALNS North Adams, Massachusetts • • • Kathleen Molz's article "The Public Library: The Peoples' University?" in the Winter issue is beautifully done. It's such an important message for the general literate public that I began to feel impatient while I read it that it was not going to a wider audience. Yet it is worth remembering that such audiences as that of The American Scholar are more in- fluential than we often surmise on the basis of numbers alone. Everett T. Moore University of California, Los Angeles ♦ ♦ ♦ It is particularly unfortunate that the article on "Volcanoes, Nuclear Explosions and Ecol- ogy" should appear in The American Scholar [Winter, 1964-65], for just by this fact its con- clusions will take on an entirely unwarranted authority. Nearly all of the articles that grace your pages are carefully and cogently argued, and where scientific evidence is wanting the author generally suggests caution, or at least exhibits a humane set of values. In this article, on the other hand, the author states at the outset that we have "no large- scale studies of ecological effects of nuclear ex- plosions," and then, after describing the 1883 eruption of Krakatau, she concludes, on grounds that beg the question of (to name but one factor) radioactive fallout, that ecological recovery from a nuclear explosion of compara- ble magnitude "might be expected in a shorter period of time than the thirty-six years it took Krakatau to recover from the volcanic erup- tions of 1883." By association with articles whose authors treat honest doubts honestly, this article will strengthen the hand of those irresponsible people who would test nuclear explosives in defiance of our well-established inability to predict results. The unpredicted results of nuclear explosions have all been unfavorable to man (and what predicted result, for that matter, has been favorable?) and to many, if not all, other forms of life. The mindless arrogance that says we must go on with the testing of nuclear explosives because we have them - "because they are there" - ought not to find any comfort or en- couragement in your pages, for there are few enough voices as it is that speak out for restraint where ignorance is so deep as it is in the technology of radioactive wastes. It is ironical that we must thank the Rus- sians rather than a responsible scholarly com- munity for the present lag in "Operation Plowshare," which would, amongst many more outrageous projects, blast new harbors ("ur- gently needed") all around the shores of the United States. Eugene S. Ferguson Iowa State University • • • Mrs. Ingersoll replies: Mr. Ferguson does not address himself to the point of the pub- lished article but to collateral problems. It would appear that he finds dishonest and in- humane any discussion dealing with nuclear effects that does not demand the abolition of nuclear testing or offer solutions to hazards accompanying utilization of atomic energy. I must say that I believe Mr. Ferguson is doomed to a series of disappointments, for the literature on nuclear effects is augmented continually by people who believe, as I do, that facts are often fully expressive and generally rather more useful for the same ends than is moralistic ex- hortation. As for the comparison of volcanoes and nuclear explosions, I would be astonished to learn that anyone had drawn the conclusion from the facts presented that devastation from either cause is desirable, or that there is no need to be concerned about nuclear effects be- cause ecological recovery from a nuclear ex- plosion on Krakatau might come about in a shorter length of time than occurred following the volcanic eruption. In addition to what I consider to be irrele- vancy on Mr. Ferguson's part, it seems to me that he has rather energetically misread the article if he means by "begging the question" that I have avoided mentioning the factor of radioactive fallout; on the contrary, I point out (pp. 76-77) that radioactive fallout is one of the essential and critical differences between volcanic and nuclear explosions. 51*</page></plain_text>
