<plain_text><page sequence="1">FAR EASTERN ART To walk from the galleries of Western art to the Far Eastern section is to experi- ence an abrupt change in point of view. For, instead of our own familiar tradition and walls covered with oil paintings that span a few centuries, one sees a remote and unfamiliar culture. Forty full cen- turies are represented by different sorts of objects, from elaborate bronze ritual vessels, prehistoric grain jars and ancient jades of cunning workmanship to reli- gious sculpture, brilliant porcelain, and landscape painting. Many are objects of paramount archaeological interest, but others are more obviously aesthetic. And here we can make no distinction between the fine and the applied arts nor the major and minor ones. In the corridors about the main court six table-cases show early Chinese bronze weapons and jades. One of these is de- voted to a range of bronze axe-heads and spears, most of which come from the exca- vations of the ancient capital city of the Shang-Yin Dynasty, An-yang, abandoned according to some scholars about 1122 B.C. Early as these are, they include some of the most accomplished and intricate bronze casting known. The tiny clear-cut cells in which minute blocks of turquoise are set look as precisely defined as chisel cuts in cold metal, but in reality these bronzes were produced from wax models about which were formed clay moulds to receive the moulten metal. Smooth jade points and spear-tips were hafted in em- bellished bronze sockets to be set over wooden shafts. In Gallery Iv, devoted mainly to bronze and jade, a generous anonymous donor and the bequest of Grenville L. Winthrop, Class of i886, have provided us with one of the largest and most care- fully selected collections of Chinese ritual bronze vessels known (plates 1-7A). They cover some twelve centuries ending with the second century of our era. Among them are smaller objects of gilt bronze and gold such as buckles and belt-hooks set with jade and with glass beads made three centuries before Christ, not long after the art of glass making appeared in China from the Near East. Among the elaborate bronze mirrors of complex pat- tern is one, perhaps unique, on the back of which is painted in bright color a gala procession, mounted and afoot (plate 2B). Two other mirrors are precisely dated in the first century and are among the few documents of the period on which our knowledge of the bronze style of those decades is based. The lacquered table top between the windows is a remarkable example from the excavations of a first century Chinese colony in Korea. In the small room beyond (Gallery v) are shown an intricately engraved ivory tusk from Shang Dynasty China, where no elephants have been since those dis- tant times, and two severely carved horses' heads of green jade in the style of the time of Christ or a century later. Small jade figures from the very dawn of history presumably were fetishes carried on the person. In contrast to the ritual vessels are gilt bronze figures some seventeen centuries younger, which, though anthropomorphic in shape, are symbols of the same Buddhist abstractions seen in the next gallery (vi) where stone, clay, bronze and wood figures are collected (plates 7B-10). Many of the stone sculptures, largely from the Grenville L. Winthrop bequest, have come from the rock grottoes of China, hollowed during the years when Buddhism was still fresh from its deliber- ate journey from India through Afghan- istan, across the central Asian deserts skirting the Gobi and the Tibetan pla- teau, down to the fertile valleys of the Yellow River and its tributaries where Chinese culture was already vastly an- cient. Here again is a gallery where one must not make the mistake of fetching his aesthetics over from the rooms of Western art. For, unlike the sculptured gods of Greece and Rome, these are not superhuman deities fashioned to be like classical athletes and maidens. Rather 74</page><page sequence="2">FAR EASTERN ARTr they are stark symbols or abstractions, never intended to cheat us with delight nor to introduce the foreign and disturb- ing notion that "correctly" modelled bodies can ever be symbols of Buddhist abstractions or to suggest the dwellers on Olympus. Also in Gallery vi are three of the fragments of Buddhist wall paintings (plate 12) brought back from beyond the Great Wall by the first Fogg Museum Expedition to China. They are among the few dateable Chinese paintings of the T'ang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.) and the only examples of T'ang wall painting in any museum. The polychrome statue in unbaked clay of a kneeling deity (plate 1i) shows the shift from formal symbolic sculpture to a humanity and beauty more acceptable to most Western minds. It was brought from the same grottoes as the wall paintings. In Gallery vii are hung eleven paint- ings, dating from the xiii to the xviii centuries, examples of the work on which we base our respect for the amazing accomplishment of Chinese painters and draughtsmen since mediaeval times (plates 13 and 14A). In the same gallery are two cases filled with carved jades from the xvii and xviii centuries. These are but a small propor- tion of our large collection from the Ernest B. (Class of 1892) and Helen P. Dane gift and that of Mrs. George Agassiz in memory of her brother, Charles Ritchie Simpkins. This great gift of the Danes is also represented by a case full of various sombre black and brown wares of the xi to xiv centuries known as Chien and Honan black wares. But even more sig- nificant are no less than twenty-four speci- mens from the Danes' unexcelled group of xII-xIII century Chun ware, the rare blue and raspberry colored plant jars of the imperial palace for which the Chinese nobility squandered their wealth (plate 14B). Two cases of highly decorated Ming porcelains from the bequest of Samuel C. Davis, Class of 1893, illustrate the devel- opment of overglaze enamels from the xvi and xvii centuries (plate 15). At one end of the room is a group of early wares ranging from one specimen of the prehistoric painted pots brought from Kansu Province by the Fogg Mu- seum's second China Expedition, to the three-color ware of the T'ang Dynasty (6i8-907 A.D.). At the end of the North wall is a case of terracotta figurines, glazed and unglazed, which show to the very life the costumes and customs of the men and women in whose graves of the Iv century B.c. to the ix century A.D. they were found (plates i6 and 17A). In Gallery viii there are objects from Japan and Korea that show an obvious kinship to China (plates 17B-20). Several Japanese paintings, from the mediaeval period to the xviii century, a case of Japanese dramatic masks of wood, a group of Korean celadons of the xII-xIv centuries, and, seldom seen outside of Korea, a particularly significant series of xv-xvIII century Korean pots, of which one at least (plate 17B) is comparable in grandeur and subtlety to the great wares of Sung Dynasty China. Last of all is one case (plate 20) of lively and decorative Japanese household pottery, examples of a folk art which is among the most re- markable in the Far East and which is now in total eclipse. Naturally, five galleries do not contain our entire Oriental collection. Visitors are invited to pursue their inquiries and to consult the library in the Rubel Asiatic Research Bureau.
