<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vetus Testamentum XXXII, 1 (1982) THE COVENANT RITUAL IN EXODUS XXIV 3-8 by E. W. NICHOLSON Oxford I It is widely agreed that Exod. xxiv 1-11, which brings the Sinai pericope to its conclusion, comprises two originally separate tradi- tions, the one contained in vv. 1-2, 9-11 and the other in vv. 3-8. My main concern here is with the latter of these two passages, though I shall turn briefly to the former at a later stage in this article. Several problems arise in the study of vv. 3-8: first, its unity and the Penta- teuchal source or sources to which it belongs; secondly, its antiquity; and thirdly, the meaning of the ritual it describes. With regard to the first of these, opinion has been divided. The unity of the passage (with the possible exception of "and all the judgements" in v.3aB) is accepted by, for example, Driver, Eissfeldt, and Beyerlin, who ascribe it to E 1), by S. Mowinckel, who assigns it to his Jv source2), and by M. Noth who associates it with the Book of the Covenant 3). More recently, D. J. McCarthy too has defended its unity, though he regards it as deriving from a source independent of the main Pentateuchal sources whilst reflecting the same tradition represented by them (especially E) 4). Others (for example, Kraetz- schmar, Dillmann, Holzinger, Baentsch, Beer, Hyatt) regard vv. 3ap, 4aoc ("And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord") and 7 as redact- ional, without agreeing to which redactor they are to be attributed, 1) S.

None of these commenta- tors severs the connection between the sacrificial offerings described in 4ar-6 and the ritual described in v. 8 6). Both Perlitt and Zenger, however, have severed this connection, arguing that an earlier tradition of sacrificial offering (4ar-6 [Perlitt] and 4aB-5 [Zenger]) has subsequently been reinterpreted by a Deuteronomic redactor as a covenant rite 7). I shall return to this later. At an earlier stage in Old Testament study when many leading scholars argued, following Wellhausen, that the notion of a covenant between God and Israel was a late development, any suggestion that this passage preserves an ancient tradition of the making of such a covenant was rejected.This view was succinctly stated by, for example, Kraetzschmar in his well-known monograph published in 1896 (p. 84). He assigned the passage, with the exception of 3aB, 4ao, 7 which he regarded as insertions by a Deuteronomic redactor, to a late E stratum (E3) which he dated circa 700 B.C. He argued that the late- ness of the scene described is indicated by the fact that Yahweh him- self does not participate in the ritual in person; a covenant mediator has become necessary. This contrasts with the covenant ceremony in Gen. xv in which Yahweh is described as participating directly. Ac- cordingly, Exod. xxiv 3 ff. represents a much less anthropomorphic concept and is therefore to be assigned to a relatively late period in the development of Israelite religion. Today, however, there is widespread agreement that this passage embodies an ancient tradition. Decisive in this respect, as far as most modern commentators are concerned, was an article by C. Steuer- nagel published just a few years after Kraetzschmar's work 8). Against the latter Steuernagel argued that in describing "the young men of Israel" (v. 5) as having offered the sacrifices here mentioned this 5) R.

W. NICHOLSON passage reflects a tradition which pre-dates the rise of the Levites as the accepted priesthood of Israel. He argued that since already by the end of the period of the Judges the status of the Levites as Israel's priesthood appears to have been established-the narratives in 1 Sam. i ff. are evidence for this-and since even earlier, as the narrative in Judg. xvii indicates, Levites were already favoured as priests, the tradition in Exod. xxiv 3 ff. must have originated at a still earlier period when the Levites were either unknown as priests or at least were not yet preferred as such (pp. 348 ff.). Steuernagel went so far as to suggest that the tradition may reflect the actual course of events at Sinai, but he refrained from pressing this beyond a possibility. Whilst not necessarily commiting themselves to as early a dating of this tradition as Steuernagel proposed, most modern commentators have agreed with his basic argument concerning its antiquity. Perlitt too has conceded its antiquity, though he limits the tradition in its earliest form to the account of the sacrifices offered in vv. 4ar-6 and regards its covenantal application (v. 8) as the result of later Deuteronomic redaction (pp. 190 ff.). There has been general agreement on the significance of the blood rite described in this passage. Particular importance has been attached to the division of the blood into two halves (v. 6), one half being thrown against the altar, the other half upon the people (v. 8). By this means a communio sacramentalis was created between the two partners to the covenant, Yahweh and Israel, Yahweh being repre- sented, it has frequently suggested 9), by the altar. In support of such an understanding of this rite reference has then usually been made to the evidence adduced by, for example, Robertson Smith, Wellhausen, Trumbull, and earlier scholars, from ancient Near Eastern and classical texts concerning a similar use of blood as a means of creating covenantal brotherhood between individuals or groups 10). II As the references already made to his work indicate, Perlitt has rejected the long established understanding of this passage as pre- 9) e.g. Driver, p. 253; Noth, pp. 160 f.

Wellhausen, Reste arabischen Heidentumes (Berlin, 1887), p. 120. 76</page><page sequence="4">THE COVENANT RITUAL IN EXODUS XXIV 3-8 serving an ancient covenant tradition. In this he has been supported by Kutsch who has at the same time advanced a new interpretation of the meaning of the blood rite it describes 11). Both have argued afresh the view, more characteristic of an earlier period in Old Testa- ment study, that the idea of a covenant between God and Israel was a creation of the Deuteronomic movement of the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. With regard specifically to Exod. xxiv 3-8, their views are briefly as follows. Perlitt argues that an earlier tradition of the offering of sacrifices, described in vv. 4aB-6, has subsequently been worked over and recast by a Deuteronomic redactor as a covenant ritual (pp. 190 ff.). Since his argument here depends partly upon his understanding of Exod. xix 3b-8, we must first note his view of the origin of this latter passage (pp. 167 if.). Following many commentators, he regards it as a Deuteronomic insertion which he dates to the exilic period. In support of this he draws attention to the following: the expression "you have seen" (v. 4a) or similar expressions (e.g. "what your eyes have seen"), when used of what God has done on Israel's behalf, is especially characteristic of the Deuteronomist (cf. Deut. iv 3, 9, x 21f., xi 7, xxix 1; Josh. xxiii 3); the imagery in v. 4b ("I bare you on eagles' wings") is similar to that in Deut. xxxii 11, another later addition to the original book of Deuteronomy; the description of Israel as Yahweh's "peculiar possession" (segullah, v. 5b) is found in Deut. vii 6, xiv 2, xxvi 18; in Deuteronomy also Israel is described as a "holy people"-the fact that Exod. xix 6 describes Israel as a "holy nation" (goy) indicates not a non-Deuteronomic hand but only that its Deuteronomic author wrote against the background of the exile when Israel found itself numbered amongst the nations (cf. the use ofgoy in the Deuteronomistic passage Deut. iv 6-8); the expression "for all the earth is mine" (v. 5b) also fits an exilic background and echoes the world of Deutero-Isaiah (cf. for example Isa. xlii 5), whilst the des- cription of Israel as "a kingdom of priests" echoes the Trito-Isaianic text Isa. lxi 6 ("But you shall be named the priests of the Lord"). Thus, according to Perlitt, late Deuteronomic, priestly and prophetic currents of the exilic period run through this passage. Turning to Exod. xxiv 3-8, Perlitt finds similarities in structure and language between vv. 3, 7 and xix 3b-8. In both passages Moses 11) E. Kutsch, Verheissung und GesetZ: Untersuchung zum sogenannten "Bund" im Alten Testament, BZAW 131 (Berlin and New York, 1973). 77</page><page sequence="5">E. W. NICHOLSON comes to the people (wayydab' xix 7a, xxiv 3a)and declares to them what Yahweh has said ("all these words which Yahweh had commanded him" in xix 7b; "all the words of Yahweh" in xxiv 3a; "the book of the covenant" in xxiv 7a); in both passages the people respond unanimously ("And all the people replied together" in xix 8a; "and all the people replied with one voice" in xxiv 3b) pledging themselves to obey ("all that Yahweh has spoken we will do" in xix 8a and xxiv 7b; "all the words which Yahweh has spoken we will do" in xxiv 3b). On these grounds he argues that Exod. xxiv 3, with which he associates v. 4ao ("And Moses wrote all the words of Yahweh"), and v. 7 are, like Exod. xix 3b-8, from a Deuteronomic hand (p. 192). What of the material that remains, that is 4a(-6, 8? From this Perlitt isolates the description of the offering of sacrifices in 4a3-6 which he regards as an originally independent unit and which, in view of its reference to "the young men of Israel" as having offered the sacrifices, is of ancient origin (p. 196). It begins with Moses building an altar and concludes with v. 6; that is, it is a self-contained account of a sacrificial offering, nothing more and nothing less, which requires no accompanying words, whether delivered orally or read (p. 196). It is a mistake, he maintains, when scholars, anticipating v. 8, regard the dividing of the blood in v. 6 as a preparation for a covenant ritual. In reality, the blood as a whole is already disposed of in v. 6, one half being thrown upon the altar, as cultic practice required, the remainder being placed in the vessels mentioned, that is, also disposed of; no one has succeeded in associating these vessels with a covenant ritual (pp. 198 f.). Further, the other half of the blood is no longer mentioned in v. 8 which refers simply to "the blood", that is, all the blood. Accordingly, this verse, Perlitt argues, is a secondary addition construing the sacrificial offering in v. 6 as a covenant rite. Its concluding words ("in accordance with all these words") betray its dependence upon the terminology if vv. 3 and 7 and with them it too is to be ascribed to a Deuteronomic redactor who has thus recast the old tradition in vv. 4a(-6 to make it read as a cove- nant-making ceremony. Unlike Perlitt, Kutsch regards this passage as a literary unit 12) no part of which is pre-Deuteronomic (p. 89). His understanding of the ritual it describes is bound up with his understanding of what the 12) He excludes only the phrase "and all the judgements" (v. 3a) as a secondary insertion (p. 80 note 161). 78</page><page sequence="6">THE COVENANT RITUAL IN EXODUS XXIV 3-8 word berit means. According to him, it does not mean "relationship" (Bund), but "obligation", "duty" (Verpflichtung). As such it can be used to designate (a) an obligation which one making a berit takes upon himself in favour of another (Selbstverpflichtung), that is, a prom- ise; (b) an obligation which one making a berit imposes upon another (Fremdverpflichtung); (c) an obligation mutually assumed by two or more parties who make a berit (eine wechselseitige Verpflichtung), that is, promises mutually given and received; (d) an obligation which a third party imposes upon one party in favour of another in making a berZt between such parties (pp. 6 ff.; see his summary on p. 27). For the understanding of the ritual described in Exod. xxiv 3-8, Kutsch, like many before him, points to the analogy of such rites in ancient Arabic literature, specifically to description of rituals in which the parties involved dip their hands in the blood of a sacrificial victim (p. 86). But as a particularly clear example of such a ritual, which Kutsch interprets as a means of taking a solemn oath, he draws attention to a passage in Aeschylus's The Seven Against Thebes, lines 42-8 13): Seven warriors, impetuous leaders of their companies, shedding a bull's blood into a black-bound shield, and touching with their hands the victim's gore, have sworn an oath by Ares, by Enyo, and by bloodthirsty Rout, that they will bring destruction on the city of the Cadmeans and ravage it by force of arms, or in death imbrue this land of ours with their blood. Kutsch sees clear parallels between what is recorded here and what is described in Exod. xxiv 3-8: in both cases the groups mentioned are placed under obligation by means of a solemn act; according to Exod. xxiv 7b (cf. 3b) the assembled Israelites declare "all that Yahweh has spoken we will do, and be obedient", and Moses thereupon places them under solemn obligation; similarly the Greek commanders take upon themselves the solemn commitment to destroy Thebes; in both passages the blood of sacrificial victims is placed in containers and, again in both passages, the groups mentioned are brought into contact with this blood. The only difference is that in Exod. xxiv 3 ff. the obligation is placed upon the Israelites by Yahweh through the mediation of Moses (it is a Fremdverpflichtung), whilst in the pas- sage in Aeschylus the warriors impose the obligation upon themselves 13) The translation here given is from H. W. Smyth, Aeschylus, The Loeb Classical Library (London, 1922). 79</page><page sequence="7">80 E. W. NICHOLSON (it is a Selbstverpflichtung) (p. 87). As in the case of the Greek warriors, so in that of Exod. xxiv 3 ff. it is not a matter of creating a "relationship" (Bund); rather it is a matter of the Israelites being solemnly placed under an obligation (and only they and not Yahweh). That is, the application of the blood of the victims in Exod. xxiv 3 ff. accom- panies the taking of a solemn obligation, as it does amongst the Arabs and the Greeks. The rite described signified an act of self-impreca- tion: as the blood of the sacrificial victims has been spilt, so would the blood of those be spilt who break their obligation, that is their oath (p. 87). What is explicitly stated in the passage in Aeschylus is implied in Exod. xxiv 8. III In my opinion there are serious difficulties in the way of accepting either Perlitt's or Kutsch's understanding of this passage. To con- sider first Perlitt's view, it is at least doubtful whether he has done justice to the reference in v. 6 to half the blood of the sacrificial victims being placed in vessels. In no other text describing a similar sacrificial offering (for example, Lev. i 5, 11, iii 2, 8, 13, vii 2, 14) is the blood of the victims described as having been disposed of in such a manner, some being cast upon the altar, the remainder being placed in vessels (and then what?). Was normal cultic requirement here being contravened? If so, why? If not, why has the author felt it necessary to add what, on Perlitt's view, would have to be regarded as a rather pedantic detail (supplied in no other text describing a similar sacrificial scene) concerning the "disposal" of that half of the blood which had not been or could not be dealt with in the same manner as the other half, that is, thrown upon the altar? 14) Further, why this apparently exact division of the blood into two equal halves? In view of the references elsewhere (e.g. Exod. xxix 12; Lev. iv 6 f., 16 ff., 25, 30, 34, v 9, viii 15, 23 f.) to part of the blood of a sacrifice being used for some specific purpose, whilst the remainder of it is thrown upon the altar or at its base, does it not seem likely that here too in Exod. xxiv 6 a similar use of some of the blood is envisaged? This surely accounts more plausibly for the 14) As Perlitt himself acknowledges (p. 201), it is purely hypothetical to suggest that the half of the blood may, at some stage in the history of this tradition, have been intended for casting upon the "twelve pillars" referred to in v. 4 which would then be regarded as representing the people at Sinai.</page><page sequence="8">THE COVENANT RITUAL IN EXODUS XXIV 3-8 exact description of the blood being divided into two halves. In short, Perlitt's argument at this point is rather forced. Zenger avoids this difficulty by maintaining that v. 6 also comes from a Deuteronomic redactor, and that what is here described prepares the way for the ritual in v. 8, which he ascribes to the same redactor; on this view the original tradition ended with the offering of the sacrifices in v. 5. Two observations may be levelled against such a view. First, it is clear that in the narrative as it now stands the offering of the sacrifices is subordinate to the blood ritual; it is upon the latter that the emphasis lies, whilst the former is but the necessary prelimi- nary to it. Zenger would not dispute this; his argument is simply that this was not always the case and that at an earlier stage the passage described only a sacrificial scene. Against this, however, it may be argued that a particular feature of v. 5 already suggests the subordinate role of the sacrifices here described, that is, that they are preliminary to some further action. The feature in question is that these sacri- fices ar offered by the na'are beneyisra'el. In my opinion the word ne'drim here is not to be understood as "youths" but as a technical term designating subordinate cultic officials, "Priest's servants" as in 1 Sam. ii 13 ff. If this is so, the scene described portrays these cultic officials as the subordinates of Moses whose implied role is thus that of priest proper. To these subordinate cultic officials is assigned the subordinate task of immolating the sacrificial victims, whilst to Moses is assigned the task of manipulating the blood of these sacri- fices upon which the emphasis lies. The separate functions of the na'are benyisira'el on the one hand and of Moses on the other are portrayed in vv. 4aBb, 5, 6 which, contrary to Zenger's view, must therefore be seen as belonging essentially together. In short, v. 6 is the necessary continuation of v. 5 and is anticipated by the latter. Second, the view that v. 6, and v. 8 with its description of a cove- nantal blood ritual, are from a Deuteronomic redactor runs into a further serious difficulty. It is that the making of a covenant by such ritualistic means is very un-Deuteronomic, as D. J. McCarthy has pertinently pointed out 15). Or as A. D. H. Mayes, commenting on the phrase "the blood of the covenant" in v. 8, has put the matter, such a phrase "with its clearly ritualistic presuppositions ... stands 15) "berit in Old Testament History and Theology", Biblica 53 (1972), p. 117. 81</page><page sequence="9">E. W. NICHOLSON in complete contrast with the deuteronomistic emphasis on the words or the law by which Israel's relationship with Yahweh is established"'6. For these reasons Perlitt's separation of the sacrifices described in v. 6 from the use of the blood of these sacrifices in v. 8 may be rejected as being forced, whilst the covenantal application of this blood in v. 8 cannot plausibly be regarded as the notion of a Deutero- nomic redactor. Similarly, Zenger's view that v. 6 as well as v. 8 derives from a Deuteronomic editor is unconvincing. How are we to understand this ritual described in v. 8? It does not seem to me to be correct to understand it on the analogy of the re- lationship of friendship or "brotherhood" created between unrelated groups or individuals by means of the blood of sacrificial victims, as described in ancient Arabic literature. The Old Testament itself affords no evidence of such a use of blood for creating such friend- ship or "brotherhood" between individuals or groups. For example, David referred to Jonathan as his "brother" (2 Sam. i 26), but the covenant which they made with each other makes no mention of any blood ritual (1 Sam. xviii 3 f.). More significant, however, is the fact that wherever the Old Testament speaks of kinship, it does so with the terminology of "flesh and bone" but never with that of blood (cf. Gen. xxix 14, xxxvii 27; Judg. ix 2; 2 Sam. v 1 [= 1 Chron. xi 1], xix 12, 13; Neh. v 5). Evidently, ancient Israel did not think of kinship in terms of blood-relationship, and this renders it improbable that the sacrificial blood in Exod. xxiv 3 ff. was conceived of as effect- ing a sort of covenantal "kinship" between Yahweh and the Israelites. As for Kutsch's suggestion, there is likewise no evidence whatso- ever in the Old Testament of self-imprecation rites by means of blood, and it is surely inadmissible to have to go far afield as Aeschy- lus in order to understand a ritual in ancient Israel. One might add that the context in each case is strikingly different: in the one case that of preparation for war, in the other the meeting between a people and its God for quite other purposes. Sound method requires that we attempt in the first instance to understand the ritual described 16) Deuteronomy (London, 1979), p. 67. McCarthy's and Mayes's observation on this point has persuaded me to revise my view, expressed in an earlier work, Exodus and Sinai in History and Tradition (Oxford, 1973), p. 72, that v. 8 derives from a Deuteronomic editor. I am currently preparing a longer study of covenant in the Old Testament and therefore wish to reserve judgement at this time on the extent to which Deuteronomic redaction may be discerned in this passage (see below p. 84). 82</page><page sequence="10">THE COVENANT RITUAL IN EXODUS XXIV 3-8 in Exod. xxiv 3 ff. on the basis of what we know from elsewhere in the Old Testament concerning the use and significance of blood in Israel's cult. Prominent is the belief that blood is holy; that is why, for example, the blood of sacrificial victims is devoted to God. Further, blood conveys holiness to that with which it comes into contact. Thus, for example, it is used as part of the rite whereby Aaron and his sons are hallowed, consecrated as priests (Exod. xxix 20 f.; Lev. viii 22 ff.). Given this, an explanation of the ritual in Exod. xxiv 3 ff. readily suggests itself: half the blood is thrown upon the altar, devoted to God (cf. Exod. xxix 16, 20; Lev. i 5, 11, iii 2, 8, 13, vii 2, viii 19, 24, xvii 6; Num. xviii 17, etc.), whilst the other half, so carefully noted as having been set aside, is cast over the assembled Israelites who are thereby consecrated as Yahweh's holy people. Thus, in addition to whatever else it entailed (see below p. 84), the making of the cove- nant here was also a matter of Israel becoming Yahweh's holy people. IV In my opinion some additional support for such an interpretation of the significance of the blood rite in Exod. xxiv 3 ff. may be adduced from Exod. xix 3b-8. This passage is regarded by most commentators as having been secondarily inserted into this chapter and as being an anticipatory summary and interpretation of the Sinai pericope as a whole, which begins with this chapter and culminates in the record of the ratification of the covenant in xxiv 17). Perlitt has shown that there are some points of contact between Exodus xix 3b-8 and xxiv 3-8. Childs too has noted an important relationship between them: chapter xxiv "brings to completion the sealing of the covenant which had been first announced in 19.3. The repetition by the people of the same response (19.8 and 24.3, 7) marks the beginning and end of one great covenant event" (pp. 502 f.). In the light of the suggestion made above concerning the signifi- cance of the ritual described in xxiv 3 ff., a further way in which these two passages may be related is as follows. Exod. xix 6a states that Israel as God's covenant people will be to him "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation" 18). If Exod. xix 3b-8 as a whole is an anticipatory 17) See for example, B. S. Childs, Exodus (London, 1974), pp. 360 f. 18) As Childs (pp. 367, 374) points out, the various parallelisms in Exodus xix 5-6 render questionable the suggestion made by various scholars (e.g. W. L. Moran, "A Kingdom of Priests", in J. L. McKenzie [ed.] The Bible in Current 83</page><page sequence="11">E. W. NICHOLSON summary and interpretation of the nature and basis of the covenant, it may be suggested that the statement in xix 6a was intended by its author as an interpretation of xxiv 3-8 (cf. Kraetzschmar, pp. 84-5); the author of xix 3b-8 understood Israel's status among the nations in a similar way to that of the author of Isa. lxi 6 ("you shall be named the priests of the Lord") and saw Exod. xxiv 3 ff. as a record of Israel's consecration as such which he wished to be understood after the analogy of the consecration of priests. Thus, what is set out in programmatic manner in Exod. xix 3b-8 is finally completed in xxiv 3-8 where Israel gives its pledge accepting the words of the covenant and is then constituted as Yahweh's holy people, that is, in terms of xix 6a, as his "kingdom of priests and a holy nation". Further, taken together, both passages are unambiguous concerning the significance of the covenant which, on the one hand, is seen as constituting Israel as God's holy people, his "peculiar posession" among the nations, but also, on the other hand, as the solemn comissioning of Israel as a holy nation, obedient to God's holy will and functioning among the nations in the manner that a priesthood functions in a society. Thus the covenant confers a status but no less an obligation upon Israel. I reserve judgement on the problem of the authorship and date of both these passages, involving as it does a number of questions: are they both from the same hand, or does Exod. xxiv 3-8 contain a nucleus of older tradition which the redactor responsible for xix 3b-8 has edited? Is Exod. xix 3b-8 correctly regarded as a Deuterono- mic composition? Is the ritual described in xxiv 3 ff. necessarily an ancient tradition? With regard to this latter question, it may be argued, against Steuernagel, that it was evidently still possible at a relatively late stage in Israel's history for non-priestly figures to offer sacrifice (Elijah does so in 1 Kgs xviii). Further, if, as suggested above, the word ne'rim in Exod. xxvi 5 means not "youths" but something like "cultic attendants", "priest's servants", what difference might this make in discussing the origin and dating of this passage? V I venture one final suggestion as possible further support for the interpretation of the significance of the ritual in Exod. xxiv 3 ff. Catholic Thought [New York, 1962], pp. 7-20) that the phrase "a kingdom of priests" does not refer to the totality of Israel but only to part of it, the priesthood, and that this phrase is to be understood in some such way as "a royalty of priests". 84</page><page sequence="12">THE COVENANT RITUAL IN EXODUS XXIV 3-8 advanced above. It arises from Exod. xxiv 9-11 which marks the conclusion of the pericope as a whole. Although from a traditio- historical point of view this tradition was originally probably unre- lated to that describing the covenant ceremony in vv. 3-8, both have been brought into close relationship with each other by an editor, so that vv. 9-11 with their introduction proper in vv. 1-2 enframe the covenant rite in vv. 3-8. It is usually argued that the passage in vv. 9-11 preserves an alternative tradition of the making of the covenant-in this instance by means of a meal eaten in the presence of God upon the mountain- to that recorded in the immediately preceding verses. In my view this is incorrect. Rather, this tradition properly understood is a theophany tradition; its whole emphasis is upon the visio dei which the representatives of Israel upon the mountain experience 19). The remarkable contents of this passage and its redactional relation- ship with the description of the covenant ceremony in vv. 3-8 suggest that it is intended as a description of the very crowning of the cove- nant which has finally conveyed Israel to God as his holy people. The otherness of God is not infringed: the description of the visio dei is noticeably restrained. Yet the contrast with Exod. xix is unmistak- able: in it the people are forbidden on penalty of destruction even to touch the mountain; an unsanctified people is to prepare itself for the coming of God; there is the ritual cleansing of clothes, and the order to abstain from sexual relationship. In Exod. xxiv 9-11, by contrast, the representatives of this now consecrated people are invited to ascend the mountain, there to behold God. The statement that no danger befell them, that God "did not stretch forth his hand against the leaders of Israel" serves to emphasise further the contrast: there is no terror here, such as is implied or expressed in chapter xix, but only the brightness of God's presence to the eyes of these repre- sentatives of his holy people. There could be no more decisive a portrayal of God's drawing near to his people than this; there could be no more vivid a sign of their acceptance by him than what is now vouched to them through their representatives. With the making of the covenant, which involved Israel's consecration as God's holy people, Israel's election is completed. 19) See Perlitt, pp. 181 ff., and cf. E. W.

NICHOLSON VI The main points of this article may be summarized as follows: (1) Perlitt's separation of the sacrificial offerings described in Exod. xxiv 4a3-6 from the covenantal application of the blood of these offerings in v. 8 is unwarranted. Further, against both Perlitt and Zenger, such a covenantal ritual cannot plausibly be regarded as the notion of a Deuteronomic editor. (2) Kutsch's view that the rite here described is to be understood as a rite of self-imprecation, on the analogy of the ritual described in Aeschylus's The Seven Against Thebes, lines 42 ff., is to be rejected. There is no evidence in the Old Testament of such a use of blood in ancient Israel. Further, the widely held view that this blood rite is to be understood on the analogy of the use of blood for forming re- lationships of friendship or "brotherhood" among groups or indivi- duals, as evidenced in ancient Arabic texts, finds no parallel in the Old Testament where blood is never used as a term for describing kinship, whether between naturally related groups or individuals or between those who have made a covenant with each other. (3) The blood rite in question is best understood on the analogy of the use and significance of blood elsewhere in the Old Testament where it is held to be holy, to belong solely to God, and to convey holiness to people or objects. In Exod. xxiv 3-8 Israel is consecrated as God's holy people. (4) Exod. xix 6a, belonging to a passage (vv. 3b-8) which is best under- stood as an anticipatory summary and interpretation of the Sinai pericope as a whole, may be understood as an interpretation of the ritual in xxiv 3 ff.; specifically, it understands this rite as constituting Israel as Yahweh's "kingdom of priests and a holy nation" (cf. Isa. lxi 6). (5) Exod. xxiv 9-11 may offer some support for such an under- standing of vv. 3-8, whilst the editorial relationship of vv. 9-11 with vv. 3-8 may in turn be partly illuminated by such an interpretation of the latter. It is an honour and a pleasure to dedicate this article to Professor George Anderson and to record publicly my own debt to him for his great generosity to me over many years. 86</page></plain_text>
