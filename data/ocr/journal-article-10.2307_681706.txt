Anthropomorphism is by itself a sweeping topic with fuzzy edges and a history of lop- sided treatment in anthropology, but Guthrie handles it with originality and-clarity. He may also overpromote its place in the origins of religion. By skirting a tautology (if in fact he really does miss it) and by covering so much disciplinary ground, his thesis is bound to be picked at. Nevertheless, he has posed it with such detail that any successful criticism of it will surely advance our knowledge of the whole topic. Feminist Messages: Coding in Women's Folk Culture.Joan Newlon Radner, ed. Urbana: Uni- versity of Illinois Press, 1993. 324 pp. RUTH SAI.VAGGIO University of New Mexico This timely collection of essays explores feminist acts of coding, the various messages that women communicate through covert forms of expression. Grounded in the disci- pline of folklore, most of the essays investigate the dynamics of coding in women's folk ex- pression, notably in their stories, crafts, and songs. The essays cover a broad range of material, from messages coded in the Anglo- American child ballads to those in African- American women's rap music, from feminist stories embedded in quilts to those coded in dolls, from Native American narratives about healing to feminist renditions of the Grimms' fairy tales. Recognizing that such coded mes- sages are generated from particular women's cultures rather than from some essential fe- male community, the essays shed light on how women's communication, like gender itself, is constructed through the social relations of specific communities and cultures. At the same time, they suggest that women share some common signifying practices whose meanings are not always accessible to men, practices that define a series of coding strate- gies revealed both in women's folk expression and throughout women's expressive culture, from everyday communication to fine art. The collection is divided into four sections showing how women code messages within the patriarchal household, among them- selves, in the larger community, and through interpretations of their own stories. An open- ing essay on "Strategies of Coding," by Joan Radner and Susan Lanser, provides the con- textual framework for the volume by deline- ating a "provisional typology" of coding strategies that are characteristic of women's cultures. These strategies include appropria- tion (exaggerations of male forms or materi- als) ,juxtaposition (the ironic arrangement of texts, artifacts, or performances), distraction (drawing attention away from the subversive power of feminist messages), indirection (ambiguous or equivocal modes of expres- sion), trivialization (adopting forms of ex- pression considered unimportant by the dominant culture), and incompetence (de- nying expertise in order to express resistance to patriarchal expectations). These coding strategies can work in a variety of ways, such as when women appropriate and invert the image of innocent "Sunbonnet Sue" in their quilt work to show their resistance to domi- nant cultural norms; or when they claim do- mestic incompetence to subvert the ideology of domesticity; or when they emphasize am- biguous and equivocal messages in folktales to transform ostensibly misogynist stories into narratives of female empowerment. In a fascinating example of coding through appropriation, Barbara Babcock shows how Indian Pueblo women have taken back the power of storytelling by crafting "storyteller" dolls, thus reclaiming the power of discourse that had originally belonged to them in ma- trilinear pueblo culture. Such examples of coding share insights with much recent femi- nist theory and scholarship that call attention to women's distinctive uses of language within patriarchal cultures that deny them the opportunity to express themselves openly and directly. They also clear the way for other investigations of coding, such as covert mes- sages exchanged in lesbian cultures, an area of study that, as Radner points out, has yet to receive attention from folklorists. While the very acts of coding remind us of the numer- ous ways in which women's language has been curbed and suppressed, the feminist mes- sages contained in these codes show how women have also long resisted and attempted to subvert dominant cultural values and dis- course. As Radner and Lanser explain, under- standing these codes in the context of femi- nism "may help bring about a social order in which coding may no longer be necessary" (p. 24). At the same time, I would add, we can appreciate the necessity of coding-both within feminism and elsewhere-in continu- ally resisting the potential for language to become the property of dominant groups</page><page sequence="2">466 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [96, 1994 and in maintaining its subversive and trans- formative powers. The Future of Ritual: Writings on Culture and Performance. Richard Schechner. New York: Routledge, 1993. 294 pp. 01GA NAJERA-RAMiREZ University of California, Santa Cruz Schechner, an established performance theorist and theater director, has written ex- tensively on performance and ritual. His lat- est book consists of a collection of essays (most of which have appeared previously in other versions) that take up various aspects of performance as a subject of serious scholarly study. Based on his observations and experi- ences of a range of performances (i.e., includ- ing ritual, play, and art), Schechner makes many claims, some substantiated, some illus- trated with close analysis of a particular ritual (his most detailed discussions are on the Yaqui Waehma, the Ramlila of Ramnagar, and the Wayang Kulit), and others simply laid out for the reader to ponder. The result is a highly provocative book rich with ideas. At times, Schechner's thoughts seem dif- fuse and contradictory, especially in estab- lishing absolute definitions or in explicating the relationship among play, performance, and experience. He expresses many thoughts, but they do not always crystallize, at least not immediately. Like his charac- terization of ritual, play, and performance, Schechner's thoughts come across as multi- ple, complex, and ever-changing. For in- stance, his essay on play identifies "dark play" as a subversive, deep, and creative dimension of human expression, because the play frame is "absent, broken, porous, or twisted" (p. 41). As a result, he explains, some players tend to be unconscious of their own participation, thereby adding to the danger or "kick" of dark play. Yet, after devoting much of the essay to explaining "dark" play, he ends this section by calling for more scholarly attention to the process of play rather than to the genre of play. His own work seems to demonstrate that only by comparing different forms of play can one understand the process of play in general. Schechner's work achieves a con- stant (and productive) tension by working toward and resisting generalizations simulta- neously. Thus, searching for hard and fast conclu- sions is probably the wrong way to approach this book. Instead, the reader must engage with the process Schechner intricately un- folds. Throughout the book, Schechner al- lows the reader to see him grapple with issues, to analyze rituals, to draw conclusions (how- ever tentative or contradictory) on the nature of performance. In order to agree or dis- agree, I found myself applying his ideas to performances and scenarios with which I was familiar. That, I believe, is the power of the book--it is good to think with. Any gaps or cracks in his thinking are as stimulating as are the "deep truths" he reveals. Indeed, this is the kind of book that will draw the reader back to reconsider his musings and to con- template along with Schechner. Schechner's concern is to demonstrate that performance is intimately tied to the essence of humanity. While other animals may engage in ritual and display activities, only humans weave together experience, knowledge, fantasy, and intention in their performative behavior. He thus concludes that "the future of ritual is the continued encounter between imagination and memory translated into doable acts of the body" (p. 263). Schechner succeeds in producing an im- portant contribution to performance studies because he tackles a wide range of critical issues concerning the politics of culture, that is, issues concerning power, authority, authenticity, tradition, nationality, and iden- tity-issues that are currently at the heart of anthropological inquiry. As such, this book will have widespread appeal and may prove extremely useful as a classroom text. Mimesis and Alterity: A Particular History of the Senses. Michael Taussig. New York: Rout- ledge, 1993. 299 pp. ROBERT A. PAUL Emory University This brilliant book presents a series of re- flections from that house of mirrors which anthropologists once took for solid ground: the space created when the Western ob- server-try as she or he might to be otherwise, still a stepchild of colonialism-encounters, observes, and tries to comprehend the Other, construed as such by the ideology of "Primi- tivism." The other is here represented by the Cuna Indians of the San Bias Islands off the Panama coast, whose distinctiveness in the ethnographic record consists, for most of us, in their having maintained their "Indianness" more successfully than most down to the pre-</page></plain_text>
