ISBN 0-300-1039-5, $28, hardcover TAi Tolves have historically been one of the most maligned and despised of wild animals, yet certain VT s societies regard them highly, and the dual exis- tence of these attitudes indicates a cultural, rather than an intuitive human response to the wolf. With a foundation of fairy tales where wolves lie in wait for children in dark forests it is easy to blame our European ancestors for creating and transporting their negative attitudes about wolves from the Old Country to the New World. This idea may appear overly simplistic, but as a mammal ecologist with the Wisconsin DNR whose programs include management of gray wolves, I found myself wanting to learn more. Jon Coleman illustrates in his book, Vicious: Wolves and Men in America, that the original European immigrants to North America brought with them negative attitudes about wolves that persisted for generations. Coleman explores how these attitudes were part of a complex setting of religion, culture, economics, social stratification, politics, and environment. For example, Euro- pean immigrants maintained the common practice of allow- ing livestock to roam freely, making them susceptible to wolf attacks. As a result, "biblical visions of wolves with [a] focus on greed, corruption, and theft flourished." Although not condoning the cruel behavior that humans have displayed toward wolves, Coleman sets the stage to explain that behavior. He describes the circumstances in which these behaviors occurred, without being overtly judg- mental of the people who displayed them. Often he contrasts the struggle of the two species, humans and wolves, attempt- ing to adapt and adjust to changing environments. He com- pares the two in reference to territoriality, spacing, communication, and social systems used by each species to adapt to the environment and adjust to each other. For exam- ple, wolves mark their territory with scent marks, and howl to ward off neighbors, while European Americans marked their territories with signs and fences, and used musket fire to declare their property. Coleman explores the relations of Euro-Americans to wolves by examining three case studies of human-wolf rela- tions. He initially focuses on the interactions and attitudes of the early colonists of New England toward wolves. From New England, Coleman follows settlers west into Ohio and describes the political and economic systems that continued to encourage persecution of wolves. In the third case study, he follows the Mormons from the Midwest to Utah, and despite some initial attempts to develop more positive attitudes toward wolves, the hardships the Mormons faced during their travels ultimately caused them to also adopt negative attitudes toward wolves. The final two chapters in the book detail the govern- ment programs that eliminated wolves from the west, and the changed attitudes toward wolves in the twentieth century that eventually lead to their restoration in part of the west. I was intrigued by Coleman's treatment of people's claims of being surrounded by ravenous wolves, despite the lack of documentation showing that healthy wild wolves in North America kill and eat people. It appears that the theme of a hero being surrounded by wolves was common, climaxing with a last-minute escape. The fables or cautionary tales lived on in the culture. In my own work, I receive reports about wolf attacks that often prove to be exaggerations of minor, or non-existent events, showing that the human imagination is still strong when it comes to interactions with wolves. Not all of Coleman's work is about imagined encounters with wolves. Coleman illustrates the wolves' adaptability to a changing environment during the decimation of bison herds in the nineteenth-century west. Although the sound of gun- fire alerted wolves to the dangerous presence of human hunters, it also signaled the presence of bison carcasses left rotting on the prairie. Wolves did not remain in the area to attack humans, but rather to use the human's actions to pro- vide themselves with food. Modern versions of similar phe- nomena in Wisconsin include wolves attracted to areas with a concentration of deer hunters where unretrieved deer serves as wolf food. As a Wisconsinite, you won't read anything about the Bad- ger State in this book. Coleman incorrectly states that in 1950, wolves existed only in Michigan and Minnesota (Wisconsin held about fifty wolves at the time, about the same number as in Michigan). Although Wisconsin is absent from the book, the attitudes about wolves in Wisconsin were probably very simi- lar to those of early settlers of New England and Ohio. Yet atti- tudes have changed in Wisconsin in recent decades. Wolves have recolonized in the state and their numbers are nearly four hundred. But in recent years some negative attitudes toward wolves have resurfaced, and it is important to remember how these negative attitudes have had such a drastic affect on wolf populations in the history of America. I really enjoyed reading this book, despite its absence of 50 SPRING 2005</page><page sequence="2">WISCONSIN MAGAZINE OF HISTORY Wisconsin-specific material. Coleman has a very pleasing writing style and provides his historical accounts in a smooth, narrative style. In some portions of the book, Coleman becomes a little anthropomorphic, but it provides a contrast between human and wolf behavior that is interesting. His book provides a good perspective of how attitudes toward wolves, other wildlife, and the environment are shaped by cul- ture and the environment where people live. ADRIAN P.
