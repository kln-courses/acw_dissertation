MIRCEA ELIADE Chairman of the History of Religions Field, University of Chicago COSMOGONIC MYTH AND 'SACRED HISTORY'1 It is not without fear and trembling that a historian of religion approaches the problem of myth. This is not only because of that preliminary embarras sing question: what is intended by myth? It is also because the answers given depend for the most part on the documents selected by the scholar. From Plato and Fontenelle to Schelling and Bultmann, philosophers and theologians have proposed innumerable definitions of myth. But all of these have one thing in common: they are based on the analysis of Greek mythology. Now, for a historian of religions this choice is not a very happy one. It is true that only in Greece did myth inspire and guide epic poetry, tragedy and comedy, as well as the plastic arts; but it is no less true that it is especially in Greek culture that myth was submitted to a long and penetrating analysis, from which it emerged radically 'de-mythicised'. If in every European language the word 'myth' denotes a 'fiction', it is because the Greeks proclaimed it to be such twenty-five centuries ago. What is even more serious for an historian of religion: we do not know a single Greek myth within its ritual context. Of course this is not the case with the paleo-Oriental and Asiatic religions; it is especially not the case with the so-called 'primitive' religions. As is well known, a living myth is always connected with a cult, inspiring and justifying a religious behaviour. None of this of course means that Greek myth should not figure in an investigation of the mythical phenomenon. But it would seem unwise to begin our kind of inquiry by the study of Greek documents, and even more so to restrict it to such documents. The mythology which informs Homer, Hesiod and the tragic poets represents already a selection and an interpretation of archaic materials, some of which had become almost unintelligible. In short, our best chance of understanding the structure of mythical thought is to study cultures where myth is a 'living thing', where it constitutes the very ground of the religious life; in other words, where myth, far from indicating a fiction, is considered to reveal the truth par excellence. This is what anthropologists have done, for more than half a century, 1 This article represents the slightly modified translation of a public lecture given at the XIII Congress of the 'Societes de Philosophie de Langue Frangaise', Geneva, 2-6 September I966. Hence the style of the spoken word. I have to thank my student, Mr A. Hiltebeitel, for correcting and stylistically improving the text.</page><page sequence="2">I72 MIRCEA ELIADE concentrating on 'primitive' societies. We cannot here review the contribu tions of Andrew Lang, Frazer, Levy-Bruhl, Malinowski, Leenhard or Levi Strauss. Some results of ethnological research will have our attention later on. We have to add, however, that the historian of religions is not always happy with the approach of the anthropologists nor with their general conclusions. Reacting against an excessive concern with comparison, most of the authors have neglected to supplement their anthropological research with a rigorous study of other mythologies, for example those of the ancient Near East, in the first place of Mesopotamia and Egypt, those of the Indo-Europeans especially the grandiose, exuberant mythologies of ancient and mediaeval India-and those, finally, of the Turco-Mongols, the Tibetans, and the peoples of South-East Asia. A restriction of the inquiry to 'primitive' mytho logies risks giving the impression that there is no continuity between archaic thought and the thought of the peoples who played an important rBle in ancient history. Now, such a solution of continuity does not exist. Moreover, by limiting the research to primitive societies, we are left with no measure of the role of myths in complex and highly developed religions, like those of the ancient Near East and India. To give only one example, it is impossible to understand the religion and, in general, the style of Mesopotamian culture if we ignore the cosmogonic myth and the origin myths preserved in Enuma elish and in the Gilgamesh Epic. At every New Year the fabulous events related in Enuma elish were ritually re-enacted; every New Year the world needed to be re-created-and this necessity reveals a profound dimension of Mesopotamian thought. Moreover, the myth of the origin of man illuminates, at least in part, the tragic world-view and pessimism characteristic of Meso potamian culture: for man has been moulded by Marduk from clay, that is, from the very body of the primordial monster Tiamat, and from the blood of the arch-demon Kingu. And the myth clearly indicates that man has been created by Marduk in order that the gods may be nourished by human labour. Finally, the Gilgamesh Epic presents an equally pessimistic vision by explaining why man did not, and could not, obtain immortality. This is the reason why the historians of religions prefer the approach of their colleagues-a Raffaelle Pettazzoni or a Gerardus van der Leeuw or even the approach of certain scholars in the field of comparative anthro pology, like Adolf Jensen or H. Baumann, who deal with all categories of mythological creativity, those of the 'primitives' as well as of the peoples of high cultures. While one may not always agree with the results of their researches, one is at least certain that their documentation is sufficiently broad to permit valid generalisations. But the divergences resulting from an incomplete documentation do not constitute the only difficulty in the dialogue between the historian of religions and his colleagues from other disciplines. It is his very approach which separates him, for instance, from the anthropologist or the psychologist. The</page><page sequence="3">COSMOGONIC MYTH AND 'SACRED HISTORY' 173 historian of religions is too, conscious of the axiological difference of his documents to marshal them on the same level. Aware of nuances and distinctions, he cannot ignore the fact that there exist great myths and myths of less importance; myths which dominate and characterise a religion, and secondary myths, repetitious and parasitical. Enuma elish, for example, cannot figure on the same plane with the mythology of the female demon Lamashtu; the Polynesian cosmogonic myth has not the same weight as the myth of the origin of a plant, for it precedes it and serves as a model for it. Such differen ces may not be important for an anthropologist or a psychologist. For instance, a sociologist concerned to study the French novel in the nineteenth century or a psychologist interested in literary imagination might discuss Balzac and Eugene Sue, Stendhal or Jules Sandeau indifferently, irrespec tive of the quality of their art. But for a literary critic such conflation is simply unthinkable, for it annihilates his own hermeneutical principles. When, in one or two generations, perhaps even earlier, we have historians of religions who are descended from Australian, African, or Melanesian tribal societies, I do not doubt that, among other things, they will reproach Western scholars for their indifference to the scale of values indigenous to these societies. Let us imagine a history of Greek culture in which Homer, the tragic poets and Plato are passed by silently while the Book of Dreams of Artemidorus and the novel of Heliodorus from Emessa are laboriously commented on, under the pretext that such works better illuminate the specific traits of the Greek genius and help us to understand its destiny. To come back to our theme, I do not think that we can grasp the structure and function of mythical thought in a society which has myth as its foundation, if we do not take into account the mythology in its totality and, at the same time, the scale of values which such mythology implicitly or explicitly proclaims. Now in every case where we have access to a still living tradition, and not to an acculturated one, one thing strikes us from the very beginning: the mythology not only constitutes, as it were, the 'sacred history' of the tribe, not only does it explain the total reality and justify its contradictions, but it equally reveals a hierarchy in the series of fabulous events that it reports. In general, one can say that any myth tells how something came into being, the world, or man, or an animal species, or a social institution, and so on. But by the very fact that the creation of the world precedes everything else, the cosmogony enjoys a special prestige. In fact, as I have tried to show elsewhere,' the cosmogonic myth furnishes the model for all myths of origin. The creation of animals, plants or man presupposes the existence of a world. Certainly, the myth of the creation of the world does not always look like a cosmogonic myth stricto sensu, like the Indian or Polynesian myth, or the one narrated in Enuma elish. In a great part of Australia, for example, such 1 See especially The Myth of the Eternal Return (translated from the French by Willard R. Trask (New York and London, I954); Myth and Reality (New York and London, I963).</page><page sequence="4">174 MIRCEA ELIADE cosmogonic myths are unknown. But there is always a central myth, which describes the beginnings of the world, that is, what happened before the world became as it is today. Thus, there is always a primordial history and this history has a beginning: a cosmogonic myth proper, or a myth that describes the first, germinal stage of the world. This beginning is always implied in the sequence of myths which recounts the fabulous events that took place after the creation or the coming into being of the universe, namely the myths of the origin of plants, animals and man, or of the origin of marriage, family and death, etc. Taken all together, these myths of origin constitute a fairly coherent history. They reveal how the cosmos was shaped and changed, how man became mortal, sexually diversified and compelled to work in order to live; they equally reveal what the supernatural beings and the mythical ancestors did, and how and why they abandoned the earth, and disappeared. We can also say that any mythology that is still accessible in an appropriate form contains not only a beginning but also an end, determined by the last manifestation of the supernatural beings, the cultural heroes or the ancestors. Now this primordial, sacred history, brought together by the totality of significant myths, is fundamental because it explains, and by the same token justifies, the existence of the world, of man and of society. This is the reason that a mythology is considered at once a true history: it relates how things came into being, providing the exemplary model and also the justifications of man's activities. One understands what one is-mortal and of a certain sex-and how that came about, because the myths tell how death and sexuality made their appearance. One engages in a certain type of hunting or agriculture because the myths report how the cultural heroes taught these techniques to the ancestors. I have insisted on this paradigmatic function of myth in other publications, and consequently I do not need to repeat the point again. I would like, however, to amplify and complete what I have said, having regard mainly to what I called the sacred history preserved in the great myths. This is easier said than done. The first difficulty which confronts us is a material one. To analyse and interpret a mythology or a mythological theme conveniently, one has to take into consideration all the available documents. But this is impossible in a lecture, or even in a short monograph. Claude Levi-Strauss has devoted more than 300 pages to the analysis of a group of South-American myths, and he had to leave aside the mythologies of the Fuegians and other neighbouring peoples in order to concentrate primarily on the origin myths of the Amazonians. I must therefore limit myself to one or two characteristic examples. I will examine primarily those elements that seem essential to the myths of aborigines. Of course even such resumes might appear too long. But since I am dealing with rather unfamiliar mythologies, I cannot be content with mere allusions to them, as I could in</page><page sequence="5">COSMOGONIC MYTH AND 'SACRED HISTORY I75 the case of Enuma elish or the Greek, and even Indian, myths. Moreover, any exegesis is grounded in a philology. It would be pointless to propose an interpretation of the myths I have in mind without providing at least a minimum of documentation. My first example is the mythology of the Ngadju Dayak of Borneo. I have chosen it because there is available a work about it which deserves to become a classic: Die Gottesidee der Ngadju Dajak in Sad-Borneo (Leiden, I946) by Hans Scharer.' The author, who unfortunately died prematurely, studied these people for many years. The mythological documents which he collected, if ever printed, would cover I 2,000 pages. Hans Scharer not only mastered the language of these people and thoroughly knew their customs, he had understood the structure of mythology and its role in the life of the Dayak. As for many other archaic peoples, for the Dayak the cosmogonic myth discloses the eventful creation of the world and of man, and, at the same time, the principles which govern the cosmic process and human existence. One must read this book to realise how much everything attains consistency in the life of an archaic people, how the myths succeed each other and articulate themselves into a sacred history which is continuously recovered in the life of the community as well as in the existence of each individual. Through the cosmogonic myth and its sequel, the Dayak progressively un veils the structures of reality and of his own proper mode of being. What happened in the beginning describes at once both the original perfection and the destiny of each individual. At the beginning, so the myth goes, the cosmic totality was still undivided in the mouth of the coiled watersnake. Eventually two mountains arise and from their repeated clashes the cosmic reality comes progressively into existence: the clouds, the hills, the sun and the moon, and so on. The mountains are the seats of the two supreme deities, and they are also these deities themselves. They reveal their human forms, however, only at the end of the first part of the creation. In their anthropomorphic form, the two supreme deities, Mahatala and his wife Putir, pursue the cosmogonic work and create the upperworld and the underworld. But there is still lacking an intermediary world, and mankind to inhabit it. The third phase of the creation is carried out by two hornbills, male and female, who are actually identical with the two supreme deities. Mahatala raises the tree of life in the 'Centre', the two hornbills fly over towards it, and eventually meet each other in its branches. A furious fight breaks out between the two birds, and as a result the tree of life is extensively damaged. From the knotty excrescences of the tree and from the moss falling out from the throat of the female hornbill, a maiden and a young man come forth, the ancestors of the Dayak. The tree of life is finally destroyed and the two birds end by killing each other. 1 The book has recently been translated into English by Rodney Needham, Ngaju Religion. The Conception of God among a South Borneo People (The Hague. Martinus Nijhoff, I963).</page><page sequence="6">I 76 MIRCEA ELIADE In sum, during the work of creation, the deities reveal themselves under three different forms: cosmic (the two mountains), anthropomorphic (Mahatala and Putir), theriomorphic (the two hornbills). But these polar manifestations represent only one aspect of the divinity. Not less important are the godhead's manifestations as a totality: the primordial watersnake, for instance, or the tree of life. This totality-which Scharer calls divine/ ambivalent totality-constitutes the fundamental principle of the religious life of the Dayak, and it is proclaimed again and again in different contexts. One can say that, for the Dayaks, every divine form contains its opposite in the same measure as itself: Mahatala is also his own wife and vice versa, and the watersnake is also the hornbill and vice versa. The cosmogonic myth enables us to understand the religious life of the Dayaks as well as their culture and their social organisation. The world is the result of a combat between two polar principles, during which the tree of life-i.e. their own embodiment-is annihilated. 'But from destruction and death spring the cosmos and a new life. The new creation originates in the death of the total godhead.'1 In the most important religious ceremonies birth, initiation, marriage, death-this creative clash is tirelessly reiterated. As a matter of fact, everything which is significant in the eyes of a Dayak is an imitation of exemplary models and a repetition of the events narrated in the cosmogonic myth. The village as well as the house represent the universe and are supposed to be situated at the Centre of the World. The exemplary house is an imago mundi: it is erected on the back of the watersnake, its steep roof symbolises the primeval mountain on which Mahatala is enthroned, and an umbrella represents the tree of life on whose branches one can see the two birds. During the ceremonies of marriage, the couple return to the mythical primeval time. Such a return is indicated by a replica of the tree of life that is clasped by the bridal pair. Scharer was told that clasping the tree of life means to form a unity with it. 'The wedding is the re-enactment of the creation, and the re-enactment of the creation is the creation of the first human couple from the Tree of Life.'2 Birth also is related to the original time. The room in which the child is born is symbolically situated in the primeval waters. Likewise the room where the young girls are enclosed during initiation ceremonies is imagined to be located in the primordial ocean. The young girl descends to the underworld and after some time assumes the form of a watersnake. She comes back to earth as a new person and begins a new life, both socially and religiously.3 Death is equally con ceived as a passage to a new and richer life. The deceased person returns to the primeval era, his mystical voyage indicated by the form and decorations of his coffin. In fact, the coffin has the shape of a boat, and on its sides are painted the watersnake, the tree of life, the primordial mountains, that is to 1 Hans Scharer, Ngaju Religion p. 34. 2 Ibid. p. 85. 3 Ibid. p. 87.</page><page sequence="7">COSMOGONIC MYTH AND 'SACRED HISTORY' I77 say the cosmic/divine totality. In other words, the dead man returns to the divine totality which existed at the beginning. On the occasion of each decisive crisis and each rite de passage, man takes up again ab initio the world's drama. The operation is carried out in two times: (i) the return to the primordial totality, and (2) the repetition of the cosmogony, that is to say the breaking up of the primitive unity. The same operation takes place again during the collective annual ceremonies. Scharer points out that the end ofthe year signifies the end of an era and also of a world;' the ceremonies clearly indicate that there is a return to the pre-cosmic time, the time of the sacred totality embodied in the watersnake and in the tree of life. In fact, during this period, sacred par excellence, which is called helat nyelo, 'the time between the years', a replica of the tree of life is erected in the village and all the population returns to the primeval (i.e. pre-cosmogonic) age. Rules and interdictions are suspended, since the world has ceased to exist. While waiting for a new creation the community lives near the god head, more exactly lives in the total primeval godhead. The orgiastic charac ter of the interval between the years ought not to obscure its sacrality. As Scharer puts it, 'there is no question of disorder (even if it may appear so to us) but of another order'.2 The orgy takes place in accordance with the divine commandments, and those who participate in it recover in themselves the total godhead. As is well known, in many other religions, primitive as well as historical, the periodical orgy is considered to be the instrument par excellence to achieve the perfect totality. It is from such a totality that a new creation will take place-for the Dayaks as well as for the Mesopotamians. Even this imperfect resume of an immense amount of material has enabled us to grasp the considerable r6le that the cosmogonic myth plays in an archaic society. The myth unveils the religious thought of the Dayaks in all its depth and complexity. As we have just seen it, the individual and collective life has a cosmological structure: every life constitutes a cycle, whose model is the sempiternal creation, destruction, and re-creation of the world. Such a conception is not restricted to the Dayak, or even to peoples having their type of culture. In other words, the Dayak myth reveals to us a meaning which transcends its ethnographic frontiers. Now, what is striking in this mythology is the great importance bestowed upon the primordial totality. One may almost say that the Dayaks are obsessed by two aspects of the sacred: the primordiality and the totality. This does not mean that they belittle the work of creation. There is nothing of the Indian or gnostic pessimism in the Dayak conception of the cosmos and of life. The world is good and significant because it is sacred, since it came out from the tree of life, that is to say from the total godhead. But only the primordial total god head is perfect. If the cosmos must be periodically abolished and re-created, it is not because the first creation did not succeed, but because it is only that 1 Hans Schairer, Ngaju Religion pp. 94 ff. 2 Ibid. p. 97. B</page><page sequence="8">I78 MIRCEA ELIADE stage which precedes the creation which represents a plenitude and a beatitude otherwise inaccessible in the created world. On the other hand, the myth points out the necessity of creation, that is, of the breaking up of the primeval unity. The original perfection is periodically re-integrated, but such perfection is always transitory. The Dayak myth proclaims that the creation-with all that it made possible: human existence, society, culture cannot be definitively abolished. In other words, a 'sacred history' has taken place, and this history must be perpetuated by periodical reiteration. It is impossible to freeze the reality in its germinal modality, such as it was in the beginning, immersed as it were in the primordial divine totality. Now, it is this exceptional value conferred upon the 'sacred history', ground and model of all human history, that is significant. Such attribution of value is recognisable in many other primitive mythologies, but it becomes parti cularly important in the mythologies of the ancient Near East and of Asia. If we examine a mythology in its totality we learn the judgement of the particular people upon its own sacred history. Every mythology presents a successive and coherent series of primordial events, but different peoples judge these fabulous acts in different ways, underlining the importance of some of them, casting aside, or even completely neglecting, others. If we analyse the context of what may be called the myth of the estrangement of the creator god, and his progressive transformation in a deus otiosus, we notice a similar process, involving an analogous choice and judgement: out of a series of primordial creative events, only some of them are exalted, those in particular which are of consequence for human life. In other words, the coherent series of events which constitute the sacred history is incessantly remembered and extolled, while the previous stage, everything which existed before that sacred history-first and above all, the majestic and solitary presence of the creator God-fades away. If the High God is still remembered, he is known to have created the world and man, but this is almost all. Such a Supreme God seems to have ended his role by achieving the work of creation. He plays almost no role in the cult, his myths are few and rather banal, and, when he is not completely forgotten, he is invoked only in cases of extreme distress, when all other divine beings have proved utterly ineffectual. This lesson of the primitive myths is particularly revealing. It not only shows us that man, turning toward the divinities of life and fecundity, became as it were more and more incarnated. It also shows that early man assumes already, in his way, a history of which he is at once both the centre and the victim. What happened to his mythical ancestors became, for him, more important than what happened before their appearance. One can illustrate this process with innumerable examples. I have discussed a number of such myths in previous works.' But I would like to examine now the 1 See particularly Myth and Reality pp. 92 ff.</page><page sequence="9">COSMOGONIC MYTH AND 'SACRED HISTORY I79 mythical traditions of a people who for more than half a century have enjoyed a considerable vogue among anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists, namely the Aranda tribes of Central Australia. I will draw exclusively from the materials collected by T. G. H. Strehlow,' the son of the famous missionary Carl Strehlow, whose writings gave rise to heated controversies in Durkheim's time. I think I choose the best living authority, for Aranda was the first language spoken by T. G. H. Strehlow, and he studied these tribes intensely for more than thirty years. According to the Aranda, the sky and the earth have always existed and have always been inhabited by supernatural beings. In the sky there is an emu-footed personage, having emu-footed wives and children: it is the Great Father (knaritja), called also the Eternal Youth (altjira nditja). All these supernatural beings live in a perpetually green land, rich in flowers and fruits, traversed by the Milky Way. All of them are eternally young, the Great Father being in appearance as young as his children. And all of them are as immortal as the stars themselves, for death cannot enter their home. Strehlow thinks that it would be impossible to regard this emu-footed Great Father as a supernatural being analogous to certain celestial gods of South-East Australia. Indeed, he did not create or shape the earth, nor did he bring into existence either plants, animals, man, or the totemic ancestors, nor did he inspire or control the ancestors' activities. The Great Father and the other inhabitants of heaven were never interested in what happened on the earth. Evil-doers had to fear not the celestial Great Father but the wrath of the totemic ancestors and the punishment of the tribal authorities. For, as we shall see in a moment, all the creative and meaningful acts were effected by the earth-born totemic ancestors. In sum, one can see here a drastic transformation of a celestial being into a deus otiosus. The next step could only be his falling into total oblivion. This probably did happen outside of the Western Aranda territory, where Strehlow could not find any comparable beliefs in sky beings. Nevertheless, there are some characteristic traits which allow this otiose and transcendent Great Father and Eternal Youth a place in the category of supreme beings. There is, first, his immortality, his youth and his beatific existence; there is then his ontological anteriority with regard to the totemic heroes; indeed, he had been up there, in the sky, for a long time before the emergence of the totemic ancestors from under the earth. Finally, the religious importance of the sky is repeatedly proclaimed: for example, in the myths of certain heroes who conquered immortality by ascending to heaven, in the mythical traditions of trees or ladders connecting heaven and earth, and especially in the wide-spread Aranda beliefs that death came into 1 Especially his Aranda Traditions (Melbourne, 1947) and his recent article 'Personal Mono totemism in a Polytotemic Community' in Festschriftfuer Ad. E. Jensen (Muinchen I964) pp. 723-54; cf. also 'La gemellite de l'amehumaine' inLa TourSaint-Jacques (Paris, I957) nos. 11-I2, pp. 14-23.</page><page sequence="10">I8o MIRCEA ELIADE being because the communications with heaven had been violently inter rupted. Strehlow recalls the traditions concerning a ladder joining the earth to heaven, and describes the sites where, according to the legend, there grew gigantic trees which certain mythical ancestors were able to climb to heaven. Similar beliefs are to be found in many other archaic traditions, particularly in myths relating that after the interruption of the communications between heaven and earth, the gods retired to the highest sky and became more or less dii otiosi. From that moment on, only a few privileged personages heroes, shamans, medicine-men-have been able to ascend to heaven. We do not know how much of this mythical theme was familiar to the Aranda. But the fact is that, despite the reciprocal indifference between the Aranda and the celestial beings, the religious prestige of heaven continues to survive along with the haunting memory of a conquest of immortality by an ascen sion to heaven. One is tempted to read in these mythical fragments a certain nostalgia for a primordial situation irretrievably lost. In any case the primordium represented by the celestial Great Father does not have any immediate significance for the Aranda. On the contrary, the Aranda seem to be interested exclusively in what happened at a certain moment on the earth. Such happenings are supremely significant, that is to say, in our terminology, they have a religious value. Indeed, the events that took place in the mythical times, in the dream time, are religious in the sense that they constitute a paradigmatic history which man has to follow and repeat, in order to assure the continuity of the world, of life and society. While the Great Father and his family lived a sort of paradisiacal existence in the sky, without any responsibility, on the surface of earth there existed even from time immemorial amorphous, semi-embryonic masses of half developed infants. They could not develop into individual men and women, but neither could they grow old or die. Indeed, neither life nor death was known on earth. Life fully existed below the surface of the earth, in the form of thousands of slumbering supernatural beings. They also were uncreated (as a matter of fact they are called 'born out of their own eternity', altijirana nambakala). Finally they awoke from their sleep and broke through the surface of the earth. Their birthplaces are impregnated with their life and power. One of these supernatural beings is the sun, and when he emerged out of the ground the earth was flooded with light. The forms of these chthonian beings were varied; some emerged in animal forms, others as men and women. But all of them had something in common: the theriomorphic ones acted and thought like humans, and those in human forms could change at will into a particular species of animal. These chtho nian beings, commonly designated totemic ancestors, began to wander on the surface of the earth and to modify the land, giving the central Australian landscape its actual physical features. Such works constitute properly speak ing a cosmogony; the ancestors did not create the earth, but they gave form</page><page sequence="11">COSMOGONIC MYTH AND 'SACRED HISTORY' i8i to a pre-existent materiaprima. And the anthropogony repeats the cosmogony. Some of the totemic ancestors took on the roles of culture heroes, slicing apart the semi-embryonic aggregate, then shaping each individual infant by slitting the webs between his fingers and toes and cutting open his ears, eyes and mouth. Other culture heroes taught men how to make tools and fire and to cook food, and they also revealed social and religious institutions to them. As a result of all these labours, an extreme fatigue overpowered the ancestors, and they sank into the ground or turned into rocks, trees or ritual objects (tjurunga). The sites which marked their final resting places are, like their birth places, regarded as important sacred centres, and are called by the same name, pmara kutata. But the disappearance of the ancestors, which put an end to the primordial age, is not final. Though reimmersed in their initial slumber under the surface of the earth, they watch over the behaviour of men. Moreover, the ancestors reincarnate themselves perpetually; as Strehlow has shown,' the immortal soul of each individual represents a particle of an ancestor's life. This fabulous epoch when the ancestors were roaming about the land is for the Aranda tantamount to a paradisiacal age. Not only do they imagine the freshly formed earth as a paradise, where the different animals allowed themselves to be easily captured and water and fruits were in abundance, but the ancestors were free from the multitude of inhibitions and frustrations that inevitably obstruct all human beings who are living together in organised communities.2 This primordial paradise still haunts the Aranda. In a certain sense, one can interpret the brief intervals of ritual orgy, when all the interdictions are suspended, as ephemeral returns to the freedom and beatitude of the ancestors. Such a terrestrial and paradisiacal primordiality-which constitutes both a history and a propaedeutic-is the one that interests the Aranda. In this mythical time man became what he is today; not only because he was then shaped and instructed by the ancestors, but also because he has to repeat continuously everything that the ancestors did in illo tempore. The myths disclose this sacred and creative history. Moreover, through initiation, every young Aranda not only learns what happened in principio, but ultimately discovers that he was already there, that somehow he participated in those glorious events. The initiation brings about an anamnesis. At the end of the ceremony, the novice finds out that the hero of the myths just communicated to him is himself. He is shown a sacred and well guarded ritual object, a tjurunga, and one old man tells him: This is your own body!-for that tjurunga represents the body of one of the ancestors. This dramatic revelation of the identity between the eternal ancestor and the individual in which he 1 Cf. 'Personal Monototemism in a Polytotemic Community' p. 730. 2 Ibid. p. 729. Cf. also Aranda Traditions pp. 36 ff. on the 'Golden Age' of the totemic ancestors.</page><page sequence="12">182 MIRCEA ELIADE is reincarnated, can be compared with tat tvam asi of the Upanishads. These beliefs are not exclusively Aranda. In North-East Australia, for instance, when an Unambal proceeds to repaint the image of a Wondjina on the rock wall (the Wondjina are the equivalent of the Central Australia totemic ancestors), he says: 'I am going now to refresh and invigorate myself; I paint myself anew, so that the rain can come'.' To the irrevocability of death, as a result of the brutal interruption of the communications between earth and heaven, the Aranda replied with a theory of transmigration thanks to which the ancestors-that is to say, they them selves-are supposed to return perpetually to life. One can distinguish, then, two sorts of primordiality, to which two types of nostalgia correspond: (i) the primordium represented by the celestial Great Father and by the celestial immortality that is inaccessible to ordinary human beings; (2) the fabulous epoch of the ancestors, when life in general and human life in particular was brought about. The Aranda yearn above all for the terrestrial paradise represented by this second primordium. Such a process is also known in other religions, even in the most complex ones. We may refer, for example, to the primordiality of Tiamat and the passage to the creative primordial epoch represented by the victory of Marduk, along with the cosmogony, anthropogony, and the founding of a new divine hierarchy. Or we might compare the primordiality of Ouranos with the establishment of Zeus' supremacy; or point the passage from the almost forgotten Dyaus to Varuna, and later still to the consecutive suprema cies of Indra, Shiva, and Vishnu. In all these cases one may say that the creation of a new world is implied, even when there is no question of a cosmogony properly speaking. But it is always the emergence of a new religious world that appears to be in a more direct relation with the human condition. What is significant in this substitution of an existential primordiality for a rather speculative one is that this process represents a more radical incarna tion of the sacred in life and in human existence as such. Of course, this process is fairly common in the history of religions, and it is not completely foreign to the Judeo-Christian tradition. One may say that we have in Bonhoeffer the most recent example of the incarnation of the sacred in the profane existence of historical man; one may also identify in the most recent American theology, the god-is-dead theology, yet another variant, drastically secular ised, of the myth of deus otiosus. Thus, we can distinguish two types of primordialities: (i) a pre-cosmic, unhistorical primordiality, and (2) a cosmogonic or historical one. In effect, the cosmogonic myth opens the sacred history; it is an historical myth, though not in the Judeo-Christian sense of the word, for the cosmogonic myth has the function of an exemplary model and as such it is periodically reactualised.

Eliade, 'Australian Religions: An Introduction' in History of Religions, VI, 1966-7.</page><page sequence="13">COSMOGONIC MYTH AND 'SACRED HISTORY I83 We can distinguish also two species of religious nostalgias: (i) the longing to reintegrate the primordial totality that existed before the creation (the Dayak type of religious nostalgia); and (2) the longing to recover the prim ordial epoch that began immediately after the creation (the Aranda type). In this latter case the nostalgia yearns for the sacred history of the tribe. It is with such myths of the sacred history-still alive in many traditional societies -that the Judeo-Christian idea of history has to vie.</page></plain_text>
