Forma tive chronologies, distributions, interrelationships are reviewed in the light of Pre-Hispanic occupations in El Oro Province. Previous investigations on the Ecuadorian littoral are examined. Results indicate (1) Valdivia and Machalilla are part of the same ceramic tradition and (2) the interrelationships of these complexes to Late Formative Period ceramic sequences are more complex than previously assumed. (3) A major adaptive shift related to an increased dependence upon agriculture occurred during Valdivia VI-VIII, and contin ued into the Late Formative with the widespread distribution of Chorrera related material culture. (4) Long-distance interaction with the Ecuadorian highlands resulted in the spread of what may be termed a Chorrera horizon and formed the basis of subsequent Andean cosmology where it was symbol ically represented according to local and regional artistic canons and over a vast area of Andean South America.

It was the pioneering research of Estrada, Evans, and Meggers that greatly revised our understanding of the prehistory of coastal Ecuador (Estrada, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1962a, 1962b; Evans et al, 1959; Evans and Meggers, 1958; Evans and Meggers, 1982; Meggers, 1987; Meggers et a/., 1965; Meggers and Evans, 1962). In their investigation of archaeological sites in coastal Guayas Province, these archaeologists recorded a previously unsuspected chronological depth along the littoral, documenting the exis tence of precocious ceramic innovation associated with the Early Formative Period Valdivia Phase. Much has been written about the origins and devel opmental associations of the Valdivia Phase and of the Formative sequence of Ecuador in general. Recent research in various subregions of the coast has greatly revised our understanding of these developmental relationships and it is for this reason that this synthesis has been generated. With the goal of facilitating dialogue among specialists in the field, discussion of the Valdivia Phase in this study will be in terms of the eight phase ceramic sequence of Hill (1972/74) since it is the most widely cited chronology by Ecuadorian specialists. The Hill seriation is based upon ceramic diagnostics from a num ber of sites in the Santa Elena Peninsula and the coastal regions of Guayas Province (Fig. 1, Table I). It should be stated at the outset, that the geology and geomorphol ogy of coastal Ecuador are tectonic and at times highly active and have over the course of time affected sociocultural development along the lit toral, sometimes in dramatic and highly significant ways (Damp et a/., 1990; Issacson, 1994; Staller, 1994); however, the extent to which such geomor phological evidence has been integrated into archaeological reconstruction is limited compared to coastal Peru (see Moseley, 1983; Moseley et ai, 1981). These differences in research foci are perhaps due in part to the extensive prehistoric irrigation canals in coastal Peru. Detailed analysis of irrigation networks has called attention to geomorphological changes through their effects upon such systems. Irrigation features are absent in coastal Ecuador except for the lowlands of the Gulf of Guayaquil, where they appear with Milagro Quevedo culture as extensive networks of raised fields (Denevan and Mathewson, 1985). Despite the fact that tectonic events, including ig neous volcanic eruptions, coastal uplift as well as subsidence have dramati cally altered the coastal landscape during different times in prehistory, the timing and nature of such geological events and their consequences for so ciocultural development are only now being more closely examined.</page><page sequence="3">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 195 COASTAL PROVINCES OF ECUADOR sP O LO M B IA N Esmeraldas Esmeraldas m -1 IRfo Jamay -Equator Quito * Cotocollao 1?

However, the origins of these ceramic phases were initially interpreted before regional-temporal variations in settlement patterns, ce ramic attributes, and the associated cultural chronologies were firmly estab lished. Consequently, the origins of the Ecuadorian Formative were initially perceived as a result of diffusion, migration, or invasion (Uhle, 1922c, 1923, 1924). Meggers, Evans, and Estrada (1965, pp. 157,167-168) interpreted ce ramic innovation in the Valdivia Phase as a result of diffusion, in this case transpacific contact from the Jomon culture of coastal Japan. In support of this hypothesis, Meggers, Evans, and Estrada (1965) illustrated striking sim ilarities between Valdivia and Jomon diagnostics (also see Estrada et ai, 1962; Evans and Meggers, 1966, p. 63; Meggers, 1987). The Valdivia ceramic tradition was subsequently credited with having influenced similar techno logical processes elsewhere in the hemisphere through stimulus diffusion (Ford, 1969). The Middle Formative Period Machalilla Phase was similarly perceived as the result of migrations of ceramic bearing cultures from re gions outside of the coast (Meggers et al., 1965). On the basis of excavations at La Chorrera, the elaborately crafted zoomorphic and anthropomorphic vessels and whistling bottles of the Late Formative Period were similarly in terpreted as having Mesoamerican origins (Evans and Meggers, 1957,1966, 1982; Meggers, 1966, pp. 61-62; Meggers and Evans, 1962, see also Uhle, 1920b, 1922c, 1924). Other scholars projected a variety of different routes and historical factors surrounding the spread of Formative pottery tech nology to and from the Ecuadorian coast (Bischof, 1967,1972,1975,1980; Coe, 1960; Collier, 1968; Grove, 1982; Lathrap, 1963,1967,1970,1973,1974; Lathrap etal, 1975; Uhle, 1923). On the basis of these various interpretations, the Formative of coastal Ecuador was initially conceived of as transplanted from other regions and environments that supported more complex forms of social organization. Remnants of such diffusionary explanations of the past remain. Table II summarizes the most recent archaeological evidence regard ing the developmental interrelationships of the various cultural sequences. POLITICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL SUBREGIONS OF COASTAL ECUADOR In the following analysis, coastal Ecuador has been divided into various archaeological subregions (Fig. 2). Archaeological research on Ecuadorian prehistory has generally been discussed in reference to provincial boundaries.</page><page sequence="6">198 Staller Table n.

I have identified a total of six subregions. They include (1) SW coastal Ecuador, which incorporates the Santa Elena Peninsula and SW coastal Guayas Province, especially the area between the Rio Verde and Rio Valdivia, and coastal regions to the SE. It is this subregion that has received the most attention by archaeologists and contains late prece ramic and the earliest Formative occupations. In fact, the late Preceramic Period Las Vegas complex is peculiar to this subregion (Stothert, 1976,1983, 1985). The Formative ceramic sequences derived from this area of the coast constitute the most detailed database of what has been published regard ing the Ecuadorian Formative. (2) Southern Manabi Province refers to the area around the towns of Manta and Machalilla as well as La Plata Island and the coastline and coastal hills extending to Bahia de Caraquez and the area around the Rio Chone. Southern Manabi has also been extensively investigated and the settlement patterns and ceramic diagnostics indicate an intense post Early Formative Period occupation. (3) Northern Manabi</page><page sequence="7">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 199 Fig. 2. Various archaeological subregions of Ecuador discussed and defined in this study.</page><page sequence="8">200 Staller Province refers to the regions between the Rio Chone to the provincial boundary with Esmeraldas Province. Archaeological research in this sub region has been for the most part concentrated along the Rio Jama. (4) Esmeraldas Province has been the subject of extensive archaeological re search by various scholars but is in a general sense environmentally and cul turally distinct from the rest of coastal Ecuador. (5) The Gulf of Guayaquil, which refers to those regions, river valleys, inlets, islands and coastlines that empty into and surround the gulf to the regions north of the Straits of Jambeli. The Gulf of Guayaquil includes portions of Guayas Province and in this analysis incorporates the Guayas Basin as well. In the later periods this subregion is climatically, developmentally, and culturally distinct from the other subregions within Guayas Province. Archaeological research on the Formative has been rather sporadic, primarily focused on Puna Island and in and near the cities of Milagro and Guayaquil. Our understanding of the prehistory of this region has generally lagged behind other areas of the coast. Survey and excavations on Formative Period sites have been largely focused within the immediate vicinity of the Rio Daule and/or Rio Babahoya. How ever, the Punta Arena Peninsula was the focus of concentrated research in the early 1960s to the mid-1970s (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, the area north and east of Guayaquil, especially the regions between the eastern side of the Colonche Hills and the yungas along western corridor of the Andes Moun tains have received only limited archaeological research. (6) Coastal El Oro Province refers to the barrier island estuary of the Straits of Jambeli, specif ically the area between the Rio Jubones near the city of Machala, and the border of Peru at the Rio Zarumilla. Most archaeological research in this subregion has been relatively recent and centered in the vicinity of the low lands and coastal hills between the Rio Arenillas and Rio Buenavista. These various subregions directly correspond to areas of archaeological, environ mental, and climatic variability. All the aforementioned subregions except Esmeraldas Province are di rectly pertinent to this synthesis of the Ecuadorian Formative. Archaeolog ical research in the Santiago-Cayapas Region of Esmeraldas Province ap pears to reflect a prehistory largely distinct from the rest of coastal Ecuador (DeBoer, 1996; Ferdon, 1941a; Ferdon and Corbett, 1941; Saville, 1909; Uhle, 1923; Valdez, 1987, 1992). These distinctions are evident in the material culture, which in later periods appear to reflect stylistic influences from Mesoamerica and Colombia and such affiliations are also implied by var ious technological innovations as well. Complex sociocultural development appears to have been for the most part post-Formative (DeBoer, 1996). However, when evidence of complexity does appear in the archaeologi cal record it is in the form of earthen mound constructions, finely crafted ceramic vessels and figurines, and personal adornments made of precious</page><page sequence="9">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 201 metals (Ferdon and Corbett, 1941; Jijon y Caamano, 1941; Saville, 1909, 1924; Valdez, 1992). As a result, archaeological sites in this subregion have been extensively looted and constitute major collections in museum exhibits. This is particularly the case with ancient objects associated with the La Tolita culture, which is renown for the finely crafted objects of precious metal as sociated with funerary and ceremonial contexts (Ferdon and Corbett, 1941; Saville, 1909,1924; Valdez, 1992). Although such technological innovations have much in common with pre-Hispanic cultures of Colombia, the finely crafted anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vessels of the La Tolita culture also have clear stylistic affinities to assemblages from other subregions of the Ecuadorian coast (Ferdon and Corbett, 1941; Valdez, 1992). Valdez (1987) also carried out excavations at the type-site and the chronology developed from this research is presented in Table II. Although the Formative base in Esmeraldas Province has been designated as the Chorrera Phase, it is as yet not well defined in terms of diagnostic attributes. In a synthesis of the most recent archeological evidence from the region, DeBoer, (1996, p. 68) has stated that the evidence for Early Formative occupation consists of two sherds which are "vintage Valdivia" from a mixed deposit. DeBoer (1996, pp. 68-70; Fig. 4.2) states that one of the sherds was found near a site with a 3580 b.p. date, but the contextual association and the dated deposit are prob lematic. The earliest established ceramic horizon in Esmeraldas Province dates to the latter half of the third millennium b.p. Most of what is known about the Formative of coastal Ecuador is de rived from archaeological investigations centered in S W coastal Ecuador and S Manabi. As research has spread to other subregions our understanding of the pre-Hispanic sequences has become increasingly complex in recent years. Early interpretations of Formative prehistory were perceived as a result of migrations and diffusion. The more recent ceramic and archaeological ev idence from coastal El Oro and northern Manabi have challenged most of these interpretations. Since the initial perceptions of these Formative cul tures to one another and to prehistoric cultures in other regions were based upon diffusion and migration as primary causal factors in culture change, few syntheses have appeared that incorporate more recent results. The pri mary objective of this analysis of the Ecuadorian Formative is to reassess the pre-Hispanic sequence in light of the most recent research. CLIMATE, ENVIRONMENT, AND ECOLOGY IN COASTAL ECUADOR The primary factors effecting the climate and environmental zones of coastal Ecuador are the cold Humboldt Current which runs along the eastern</page><page sequence="10">202 Staller Pacific and variations in the geographic distance of the Andean Cordillera to the coast lowlands. Annual precipitation patterns over most of SW and S coastal Ecuador depend upon the changing ocean currents that push moisture in the form of clouds along the western edges of the Andean Cordillera. When the cold water of the Humboldt Current comes into contact with the warm tropical air temperatures near the equator, it condenses into fog (garua) and forms low lying clouds that move to the east toward the coastal hills and foothills of the cordillera. In SW coastal Ecuador, the clouds usually dissipate east of the coastal hills but reform along the western edge of the Andean Cordillera where they build up and release moisture in the form of precipitation in the high sierra. The precipitation is carried as fresh water by stream channels or absorbed into the groundwater and underground aquifers that feed into the lowland savanna (pampa) and eventually empty into the sea. The Humboldt Current generally runs parallel to the western coast of South America until it reaches the Santa Elena Peninsula at about 2? South Latitude in SW coastal Ecuador. The ocean currents then flow westward toward the Galapagos Islands, and beyond along the equatorial South Pacific. During periods of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, the cold water of the Humboldt Current is initially replaced by the warm water of the El Nino countercurrent along western South America in the area of the Santa Elena Peninsula. ENSO has a history of greatly affecting the climate, ecology (both marine and terrestrial) and the human carrying capacity over a vast area of western South America (Fagan, 1999; Holmgren etal, 2001; Kerr, 1999; McPhaden, 1999; Zuta etal, 1976). Although all of coastal Ecuador is to some extent affected by ENSO, the subregions most directly affected are S Manabi, SW coastal Ecuador, and coastal El Oro Province (Rollins et al., 1987; Sandweiss, 1986, p. 18; Zuta et al.91976 ) (Fig. 2). Since the archaeological subregions along the Ecuadorian coast de scribed above also roughly correspond to regions of climatic and environ mental variation, they are discussed below in terms of the distribution of Formative archaeological remains, and in terms of their carrying capacity and potential for agricultural intensification. Esmeraldas Province, Northern Manabi, and the Gulf of Guayaquil are the wettest subregions of coastal Ecuador, while S Manabi, SW coastal Ecuador, and coastal El Oro are the most arid (Jijon y Caamano, 1952, Fig. 2, map 1). The climate in S Manabi, SW coastal Ecuador, and coastal El Oro is characterized as semiarid, distinguished by marked annual variation of rainy and dry seasons (Canadas Cruz, 1983; Ferdon, 1950). The natural vegetation has been classified as dry tropical forest, with hygrophytic or dry premontane forest in higher elevations (&gt;100 masl), and concentrations of diverse tree species and shrubs along the banks of the major coastal streams</page><page sequence="11">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 203 (Canadas Cruz, 1983; Jijon y Caamano, 1952, Fig. 2 map 1). The vegetation regimes in these regions of coastal Ecuador consist of a dry tropical xero phytic formation, made up of a variety of succulents, trees (Jacuinia and Capparis spp.), shrubs, and a diverse array of columnar cacti (Canadas Cruz, 1983; Ferdon, 1950; Parker and Carr, 1992). The coastal ecology over most of Ecuador is characterized by a high incidence of endemic plants and animals (Parker and Carr, 1992, p. 39; Svenson, 1946, p. 415). In SW Ecuador, the coastal streams are for the most part seasonal. The shoreline in SW coastal Ecuador, and N and S Manabi, are separated from the Andes by a range of coastal hills referred to as the Cordillera de Colonche and ranging between 100 to 300 masl (Fig. 3A). In the Gulf of Guayaquil, coastal El Oro Province and the regions north of the Rio Chone in N Manabi, the various stream channels flow year-round. Differ ences in stream flow in N Manabi and coastal Esmeraldas Province are related to a higher (&gt;1000 mm) average annual precipitation in those re gions (Delavaud, 1982; Zeidler and Kennedy, 1994). Consequently, Northern Manabi and the Gulf of Guayaquil are much more adapted to year-round plant cultivation. Differences in annual stream flow in these various subregions are also related to the geographic proximity of the Andean Cordillera to the coast line. In areas of coastal Ecuador where the coastal lowlands are separated from the cordillera by coastal hills there is greater variability in precipita tion (Fig. 3A). In coastal El Oro and the lowlands to the north in the Gulf of Guayaquil the foothills of the cordillera begin their ascent only 15 km from the seashore (Fig. 3B). The topography and geography of these regions of coastal Ecuador more closely approximate the conditions in far north coastal Peru (see Burger, 1992, Fig. 10). The proximity of the cordillera to the coast and differences in over all oceanic depth in these subregions has significance for the distributions and densities of maritime species at different periods of the annual cycle. They also have important effects upon the lowland vegetation, since many endemic species are adapted to the moisture provided by the coastal fog. These geographic differences also have variable effects at the top of the food chain especially upon human adaptation and population density. The Andean Cordillera represents the dominant physiographic feature in western South America and is generally a formidable dispersal barrier for plants and animals (Fig. 4). However, just south of El Oro Province, be tween 4? and 6? S Latitude, the spine of the Andean Cordillera shifts from a northeast-southwest to a northwest-southeast direction. Botanists and ge ologists refer to this area of the cordillera as the Huancabamba Deflection or Depression (Sagastegui et a/., 1999).

The local geography, ecology, and environ ment of coastal El Oro and the eastern portion of the Gulf of Guayaquil subregion provide an ideal setting for the movement of human populations and cultural plants between the coast, western highlands (yungas), and the Upper Amazon (ceja de montana). Species diversity and a high incidence of endemic plants and animals (Parker and Carr, 1992, p. 39-40) characterize the ecology in the southern re gion of the Ecuadorian cordillera. Such ecological complexity is believed to</page><page sequence="13">TOPOGRAPHIC PROFILE OF THE ANDES CORDILLERA IN ECUADOR Vertical exaggeration is approximately 185 times masl=meters above sea level 0 kilometers 320 640 960 1260 (Source: Institute Nacional Geografico Milltar del Ecuador) Fig. 4.

The Huancabamba Deflection is the only area of the Andes where related Amazonian and Pacific versants have been reported on both the western and eastern sides of the cordillera. The environmental zones in coastal El Oro Province and the eastern portion of the Gulf of Guayaquil are more "tightly packed" than in SW coastal Ecuador or S Manabf. Such environmental and ecological differences have important implications for settlement patterning and population densities, as well as long-distance exchange with inland so cieties. Various lines of botanical and archaeological evidence suggest that the environmental and ecological conditions that characterize the Huan cabamba Deflection appear to have facilitated the long distance exchange, plant cultivation, and movement of plants and subsistence resources on both sides of the cordillera. Coastal El Oro Province, SW coastal Ecuador, and S Manabf are arid coastlines distinguished by a marked variation of dry and rainy seasons. Coastal El Oro is somewhat distinct since it has a true transitional envi ronment or ecotone (Staller, 2001). Rainfall significantly increases north of Machala into the tropical lowlands of the Guayas Basin, and becomes increasingly arid towards Peruvian border (Table III, c-e). A rainfall gradi ent also exists from east to west exemplified by a 30% reduction in annual precipitation between Machala and Puerto Bolivar despite an overland dis tance of only 5 km, and a 75% annual reduction between Puerto Bolivar and Zorritos, Peru, a N-S distance of only 35 km (Staller, 1994). Over 90% of the annual precipitation along the coast occur during the 3-month long rainy sea son. The growing cycle in coastal El Oro, SW coastal Ecuador, and S Manabf is limited by the dry season, which extends from early April to late December (Table III). The precipitation cycles in coastal El Oro, SW coastal Ecuador, and S Manabf are normally insufficient to sustain year-round cultivation with out irrigation and detailed analyses of aerial photos and systematic regional Table in.

Average annual temperatures: Manta (24.6?); La Libertad (25.9?); Machala (24.7?); Puerto Bolivar (24.7?); Zorritos, Peru (24.7?). surveys indicate an absence of pre-Hispanic irrigation technology in these various subregions. However, artificial earthen retention ponds referred to as albarradas have been identified in SW coastal Ecuador and appear to date to the Late Formative Period (Stothert, 1995, pp. 148-149). Such features prob ably provided year-round water for consumption, but were apparently not designed for agriculture. In the wetter, more semitropical Gulf of Guayaquil subregion extensive systems of pre-Hispanic raised fields have been identi fied but are believed to be post-Formative (Denevan and Mathewson, 1985; Marcos, 1987). The average monthly temperatures throughout coastal Ecuador are sta ble ranging from 22.7 to 27.1?C and average 24.7?C (Table IV), and the rel ative humidity in these latitudes generally ranges from 70 to 90% (Cafiadas Cruz, 1983; Delavaud, 1982, p. 19). The general stability of the air temper atures is directly related to the cold Humboldt Current, which produces a dense fog most of the dry season throughout all of coastal Ecuador. Even during the driest months, cloud forests along the lower western slopes of the Andes trap and recycle huge quantities of moisture (Lippi, 1998, p. 52). In coastal El Oro, such conditions maintain a high water table, which also plays a role in the year-round discharge of the local streams. These geographic, climatic, environmental, and ecological conditions select for a high degree of economic flexibility and played an important role in the early development of sedentism, complex social organization, and long-term subsistence adap tation. This detailed discussion of the coastal climate, environment, ecology, geography and geomorphology is in response to much of what has been writ ten in the archeological literature regarding pre-Hispanic Formative adap tation, diet, and settlement patterns. These factors have historically shown a selection for adaptive flexibility rather than intensification and specializa tion and such long-term adaptive patterns are supported by the ethnographic literature. Coastal and inland societies in the various subregions of the Ecuado rian littoral show a clear pattern of economic interdependence (Lathrap et al., 1977; Staller, 1994,2001). Seashore fishing communities are primarily</page><page sequence="16">208 Staller adapted to maritime and aquatic resources, and carry out reciprocal ex change and resource sharing with agricultural communities dispersed fur ther inland along the coastal streams. Such cultural and economic interde pendence has been recorded ethnographically over most all of coast and various lines of archaeological evidence suggest that such a pattern may be of great antiquity (Damp, 1984a; Lathrap etal, 1977; Raymond, 1988; Staller, 1994,2000a, 2001). The seasonal availability of maritime and terrestrial plant and animal resources are complimentary in various ways. Such adaptive in terrelationships are evident by the cyclical variations in annual subsistence strategies in coastal El Oro reconstructed on the basis of ethnographic ev idence generated in the field by the author and illustrated in Fig. 5. The ethnographic evidence suggests that the availability of seasonally specific resources is in various ways complimentary, and is adjusted by either so lar and/or lunar cycles. The near-shore mangrove and estuary environments along S Manabf and SW coastal Ecuador are not of the scale and density as those of the other subregions, and consequently appear to have maintained lower population densities. Archaeological evidence and stable carbon isotope data derived from pre-Hispanic skeletons at numerous coastal sites indicate a distinct pat tern. They suggest that the archaic Las Vegas culture and the early Valdivia I?III adaptation was primarily focused upon hunting and seasonal gathering (van der Merwe et al, 1993). During the later portion of the Early Forma tive Period, sedentary pottery-bearing societies along the coast had vari able adaptive patterns, but were more focused upon maritime resources and small-scale plant cultivation. Furthermore, once the overall adaptive pattern shifts to sedentism along the coast, the economic and cultural interdepen dence between maritime societies and inland farmers appears to increase and then become stable. This pattern of interdependence exists in the present, and it may extend back to the Early Formative Period (Damp, 1984a, 1988; Lathrap et al, 1977; Meggers et al, 1965; Raymond, 1988; Staller, 1994). In fact, various lines of evidence suggest that the economy that formed the ba sis for sedentism along the Ecuadorian coast involved the year-round avail ability of maritime resources, seasonal hunting, and small-scale cultivation (Estrada, 1956, 1958; Lanning, 1967; Meggers, 1966; Meggers et al., 1965; Staller, 1994,2001). CRITICAL RESOURCES AND PATTERNS OF EXCHANGE IN COASTAL ECUADOR The economic terrestrial and aquatic resources along the coast are distinct from those in the highlands and such differences appear to have</page><page sequence="17">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 209 Human Adaption in the Straits of Jambeli and Estuary of Southern Coastal El Oro Province: Annual Subsistence Cycles Location: 2?

Ex change in cotton, salt, fish, and certain species of marine bivalves provided an early stimulus to interaction with the inter-montane and highland valleys (Staller, 1994, p. 186). Domesticated cotton has ancient origins in coastal Ecuador and was no doubt essential in the manufacture of fishing nets and</page><page sequence="18">210 Staller textiles (Damp and Pearsall, 1994; Marcos, 1979, p. 18; White, 1985, p. 50). Consumption of maritime and aquatic resources provides the necessary io dine lacking in the bland high carbohydrate diets of agricultural populations living inland from the coast or in the Andean highlands (Burger, 1992, p. 32; Knapp, 1988). Salt is another important source of iodine and was often used as a preservative for meat and fish. Salt occurs naturally on the salt flats (sal itrdl or pampa) and inter-tidal zones throughout SW Ecuador and coastal El Oro. Maritime commodities and salt appear to have been exchanged with highland populations for a variety of resources (both economic and exotic sumptuary goods) adapted to or derived from higher elevations as well as the tropical forest in the later periods. The earliest direct evidence of lowland highland interaction is in the form of obsidian flakes derived from outcrops near the valley of Quito (Asaro et al, 1994; Burger et al., 1994). Highland obsidian has been found in various Valdivia VI-VIII sites in coastal El Oro, SW coastal Ecuador, and N Manabi (Burger et al, 1994; Staller, 1994,2001; Zeidler et al., 1994). In the highlands, evidence of exchange appears in the form of marine shell and ceramic diagnostics with clear coastal affinities at sites such as Cotocollao in the valley of Quito, and at Cerro Narrio and Pirincay in the southern near Cuenca (Bruhns etal., 1990; Collier and Murra, 1943; Villalba, 1988). Certain indigenous species of marine shellfish such as the Thorny Oys ter (Spondylusprinceps), and the Strombus Conch {Strombus gaieatus) were central to Andean cosmology and religion (Marcos, 1978; Marcos and Norton, 1981; Paulsen, 1974). Such species were probably exchanged along with salt as sumptuary items in long-distance interaction between the coast, highlands, and ceja de montana. Ethnohistorians and archaeologists (Marcos and Norton, 1981; Norton, 1981; Salomon, 1977/78,1986) have documented the existence of an institution of status traders (mindald) who carried out long-distance interaction between the coast and the highlands in the later periods, although the antiquity this Andean institution has yet to be deter mined (see also Norton 1981). Salomon (1985, Fig. 23.1) introduced a spatial and hierarchical model of uses of goods and exchange for highland societies involving direct access to commodities in terms of their material constituents and intrinsic and eco nomic value. The framework for analysis involves the extent to which goods are locally available, or arrive into the center from distant peripheries. The patterns of exchange are then categorized as an indirect reflection of the de gree of complexity of the societies involved in the long-distance interaction. Commodities from the center included locally available consumables, maize, wood, etc., at one end of the spectrum to exotic sumptuary goods that con note rank and "generosity" usually brought in from different environmental</page><page sequence="19">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 211 zones in distant peripheries. Sumptuary goods from remote regions are gen erally associated with the elite and closely involved in religious cults and the legitimization of social rank. According to Salomon (1977/78,1985) the necessity for direct access to such commodities created a vested interest for extra cordillera linkages with the tropical forest (selva tropical) and the littoral. ARCHAEOLOGICAL THEORY AND CULTURE PROCESS IN COASTAL ECUADOR Some archaeologists held that the early origins of pottery technology in coastal Ecuador the result of stimulus diffusion. Ceramic innovation was initially perceived as spreading from regions of greater social complexity, such as the Andean highlands, to areas thought to be peripheral sociocultural complexity, such as the tropical forest and coastal lowlands (Estrada, 1958; Estrada et al, 1962; Meggers, 1971,1987; Meggers et al., 1965; Meggers and Evans, 1966a,b; Uhle, 1922a,b, 1923,1924). Ceramic technology has generally been perceived as a marker of seden tary village life and an agricultural economy (Ford, 1969; Lathrap, 1970; Willey, 1971). The great antiquity of Valdivia ceramics therefore conflicted with the preconceptions of many in the field regarding the necessary precon ditions for Formative development, since it was apparently associated with a nomadic fishing and shellfish collecting culture (Estrada, 1956,1957; Ford, 1969; Meggers et al., 1965). Andean archaeologists generally perceived complexity as synonymous with urbanization. Their focus was usually based upon environmental dif ferences seen as the key to understanding sociocultural development and interpreting culture change. The general consensus had been that only the wetter, more densely vegetated lowland regions of Esmeraldas Province and the Gulf of Guayaquil were amenable to intensive agriculture, and there fore social stratification and cultural innovation (Evans and Meggers, 1957; Meggers, 1966; Raymond et al., 1980; Saville, 1909). Early sedentism along the Ecuadorian littoral was perceived as directly related to the year-round availability of maritime resources (Meggers, 1966, pp. 20-21,1971). After these pioneering studies, a large body of archaeological data was reported establishing the existence of early sedentary populations associ ated with the Valdivia culture (Damp, 1979, pp. 10-11,13-14,1984a, p. 106, 1984b, pp. 574-576; Damp and Vargas, 1995, Fig. 13.2; Lathrap et al., 1977, pp. 6-7; Raymond, 1989, pp. 9-12,1993; Stahl, 1991; Stahl and Zeidler, 1990; Zeidler, 1977, 1984, 1987). Archaeologists also recorded direct evidence</page><page sequence="20">212 Staller of the remnants of Valdivia domestic structures and reported in detail on various related household activities (Damp, 1979, 1984a, 1988; Stahl and Zeidler, 1990; Zeidler, 1984). A number of archaeological investigations at sites such as Real Alto, San Isidro, San Lorenzo del Mate, and La Emerenciana also presented evidence of artificial earthen mounds and long term continuity in associated ceremonial and ritual practices (Cruz and Holm, 1982; Damp, 1979, 1984a, pp. 574-576; Damp and Vargas, 1995, Fig. 13.2; Lathrap et al, 1977, pp. 6-7; Marcos, 1988a,b; Marcos et al, 1976; Marcos et al, 1999; Raymond, 1989, pp. 9-12,1993; Stahl, 1984,1985,1986, 1991; Zeidler, 1984, 1987; Staller, 1992/93, 1994; Zevallos-Menendez and Holm, 1960). Archaeologists digging at Real Alto, recorded a "U" shaped site plan consisting of domestic habitations surrounding a central plaza (Lathrap et al, 1977; Marcos, 1988a,b; Marcos et al., 1976). Similar site plans were later identified in Upper Upano drainage of eastern Ecuador (Salazar, 1998). Linear riverine distributions were reported for Valdivia settlement patterns in various subregions of the coast (Damp, 1984b; Raymond, 1989; Stahl, 1981; Zeidler, 1977). These lines of evidence supported the assertion of an agricultural Valdivia economy based upon the cultivation of maize (Lathrap etal, 1975,1977; Marcos etal, 1976; Marcos etal, 1999; Raymond, 1988; Zevallos, 1971; Zevallos etal, 1977). Maize kernels were found to have been used to create stylistic patterns on Valdivia VI pottery (Lathrap et al., 1975; Zevallos et al., 1977) and was implied by the numerous milling stones (manos and metates) found in excavation and on the surfaces of various Valdivia sites (Lathrap et al, 1977; Norton, 1982). However, such imple ments have never been examined as to what kinds of plants were being processed. Many in the field challenged evidence of a Valdivia subsistence economy primarily based upon the cultivation of domestic plants. More re cent, stable isotope analysis of Valdivia skeletons and ethnobotanic analysis of carbon residues on Valdivia VII-VIII sherds indicate that the integration of maize in the subsistence economy was during the final part of the Early Formative Period and that it was a secondary plant central to rituals of ex change (Staller, 2001; Staller et al., 2000; Staller and Thompson, in press; Thompson and Staller, 2001). PLANT CULTIVATION IN COASTAL ECUADOR Later archaeological evidence for the precocious development of plant domestication, particularly the early introduction of domesticated maize into South America, were derived from the analysis of plant microfossils from archaeological soils (Pearsall, 1978, 1979, 1992, 1993, 1994; Pearsall</page><page sequence="21">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 213 and Piperno, 1990; Piperno, 1991,1994). These data suggested maize was in troduced into coastal Ecuador as early as 8000 B.P. and that it was present in the Ecuadorian Amazon by 6000 B.P. with at least two species exist ing on the coast by 5500 B.P (Bush et a/., 1989; Pearsall, 1978, 1979, 1991, 1992, 1993; Piperno, 1991, 1994). Subsequent isotope and ethnobotanical research has challenged the contextual and methodological evidence for an early introduction of maize in coastal Ecuador (Staller et al, 2000; Staller and Thompson, in press). Early Ecuadorian dates for maize have also been challenged by data from other regions. Although AMS dates (dendrocali brated) and morphological analysis of maize cobs from the Coxcatlan levels at Tehuacan suggest it was fully domesticated before about 3540 ? 40 B.C. (Benz, 1998; Benz and Iltis, 1990; Benz and Long, 2000, Table 1, p. 461; Long et al, 1989; Smith, 1998). Rates of change slowed considerably during the period 4770-1850 B.P (Benz and Long, 2000, Fig. 1, G-C, C-D). Un der conditions of incipient cultivation increased grain number would only enhance fitness when there was deliberate human intervention (Benz and Long, 2000). An implication of this evidence is that there was not deliberate selection for certain varieties in these early time periods. The contextual, chronological, and methodological issues surrounding the introduction of maize into South America remain unresolved, but it is generally accepted (because of the great antiquity of ceramic innovation) that plant cultivation has relatively ancient origins in coastal Ecuador (Lathrap, 1970; Zevallos, 1971). The most recent interpretation regarding early plant domestication sug gests the Valdivia economy was mixed, based upon plant cultivation, hunting of terrestrial mammals and birds, and the intense exploitation of maritime resources (Stahl and Zeidler, 1990; Pearsall and Piperno, 1990; van der Merwe et al, 1993). Early sedentism appears to be largely related to a rich, stable maritime resource base, hunting of terrestrial fauna, and some small-scale cultivation, supporting earlier interpretations of the subsistence economy (Lanning, 1968, pp. 77-79; Meggers, 1966, pp. 34-37; Meggers etal, 1965). THE FORMATIVE OF COASTAL ECUADOR Most research on the Formative of coastal Ecuador has been focused upon the Early Formative Period Valdivia complex. Despite the intensity of research on Valdivia, the chronology and range of material culture diagnostic of the final portion of the sequence were established only recently (Marcos, 1989; Marcos et al, 1999; Staller, 1992/93, 1994, 2001; Zeidler and Sutliff,</page><page sequence="22">214 Staller 1994). Moreover, the developmental relationships of the various Formative cultures remain unclear, as did their origins. It is the Early Formative Period settlement patterns and ceramic diagnostics that are the most extensively documented and the Valdivia chronology is now firmly established. Although various ceramic seriations have been reported for the Valdivia Phase (Damp, 1984a; Lanning, 1968; Meggers et al, 1965), the most widely accepted analysis is the eight-phase sequence developed by Hill (1972/74). This sedation was based upon the analysis of surface and excavated col lections from SW coastal Ecuador (Table I). However, the final portions of the Valdivia sequence, Phases VI-VIII, have not been well established in this subregion. The most recent ceramic evidence suggests considerable regional variability in stylistic and formal attributes during the final portion of the sequence (Marcos et al, 1999; Staller, 2001; Zeidler and Sutliff, 1994). Such regional variability continues into the later periods and has important ramifications for interpreting the developmental relationships of the various Formative culture complexes and their chronological extent in the different subregions of the coast. Victor Emilio Estrada (1956, pp. 9-10,1958, pp. 7, 12, 21, 24-29) first identified the Valdivia Phase from investigations at the type-site and cor rectly surmised that the ceramic tradition represented the Early Formative Period. Subsequent 14C dates supported his conclusions, and but further revealed Valdivia as one of the earliest ceramic complexes of the pre Hispanic New World (Bischof, 1972, pp. 269-273, Fig. A, 1980, p. 335; Bischof and Viteri, 1972, p. 549; Damp, 1979, pp. 15-26,89-109,1984a, p. 106,1984b, pp. 573-574; Damp and Vargas, 1995, pp. 157, 159-160, Figs. 13.3, 13.4, Table 13.1; Estrada, 1956, pp. 9-10,1958 pp. 21-42; Evans et al, 1959, pp. 7, 15-17; Evans and Meggers, 1962, p. 182; Ford, 1969; Hill, 1972/74, p. 7; Lanning, 1967, pp. 76-77,81,85,1968, pp. 10-11,37-42; Lathrap et al, 1975, p. 16; Lathrap etal, 1977, pp. 6-7; Marcos, 1978,1988a,b; Marcos etal, 1999; Meggers, 1966, Fig. 4; Meggers et al, 1965, p. 149; Norton, 1972,1977,1982; Raymond et al, 1980, p. 701; Raymond et al, 1991, p. 9; Stahl, 1984, pp. 190 226, Figs. 61,62). An analysis of the Valdivia diagnostics stored at the Museo Antropologico in Guayaquil by the author indicate that the initial exca vations carried out by Estrada at the type-site were primarily taken from a late (Phase VI-VIII) occupation layer. Estrada (1958, pp. 7, 12, 1962b) initially considered the diagnostics to be contemporaneous with Initial Pe riod cultures at Anc6n and Guanape in the Viru valley of coastal Peru (see, for example, Willey and Corbett, 1954). Most of the subsequent research on Valdivia has until recently been primarily focused upon determining the origins of the culture sequence and the earliest pottery diagnostics ( Damp, 1979,1984a, 1988; Damp and Vargas, 1995; Lathrap etal, 1977; Marcos, 1978; Meggers et al, 1965; Raymond et al, 1991; Stahl, 1984).</page><page sequence="23">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 215 THE VALDIVIA TRADITION: DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES THROUGH TIME AND SPACE The earliest Valdivia pottery was well made, aesthetically pleasing, and exhibits clear stylistic and formal standardization among distinct vessel shape categories (Lathrap et al, 1975; Meggers et al, 1965). It was in part due to these characteristics that Meggers et al. (1965) interpreted the origins of the ceramic tradition as being derived from outside of the Ecuadorian coast. Even the so-called "pre-Valdivia" pottery excavated by Bischof and Viteri (1972) at San Pedro is not technologically simple. Although the San Pedro assemblage consisted of only 27 sherds, this pottery, like other early diagnostics, shows no indication of any experimentation, but rather gives the impression of a fully developed ceramic technology. However, Damp and Vargas (1994, Fig. 13.4) have identified Phase II diagnostics in excavations at Real Alto that are identical to the San Pedro diagnostics and they concluded that these sherds were intrusive. Phase I pottery from the Valdivia sites of Real Alto and Loma Alta con sists of untreated or red slipped open bowls and jars with constricted or con cave necks, and fine line incising in geometric motifs (see Damp and Vargas, 1995, Fig. 13.3). Four distinct bowl forms have been identified and they are differentiated on the basis of the angle of the vessel walls and rims. Fire clouding on some of the basal sherds of such bowls indicates they were used in food preparation and do not only function as serving vessels. Perhaps the most detailed description of the stylistic characteristics of the Valdivia ceramic tradition was presented by Lathrap et al, (1975, pp. 27-33), who emphasized a conceptual distinction between open bowls and jars with con stricted necks (see also Staller, 1996b). Such forms occur throughout the entire ceramic sequence but are temporally differentiated by their associ ated stylistic attributes. Phase II is characterized by the presence of large engraved open bowls with low tetrapod feet, found at various sites in SW coastal Ecuador (see Lathrap et al, 1975, Fig. 19; Meggers et al., 1965, Plate 103). Other Phase II diagnostics include cooking pots with piecrust rims and shoulder bosses and elaborately decorated jars with castellated rims (Meggers et al, 1965, Plate 103). Phases I and II diagnostics represents a long-term stability in the technological and stylistic development of the ceramic tradition relative to the later portion of the ceramic sequence. These early phases comprise a period of over a thousand years, essentially constituting over half of the ceramic sequence and are all derived from sites in SW coastal Ecuador. The middle portion (Phases III-V) of the Valdivia ceramic sequence was also primarily defined on the basis of diagnostics from SW coastal Ecuador. There is a proliferation of Valdivia settlements inland in SW coastal Ecuador</page><page sequence="24">216 Staller and also evidence of expansion into other subregions, particularly S Manabi, the Gulf of Guayaquil, and coastal El Oro during this portion of the culture sequence. Valdivia III-V pottery is characterized by a conspicuous elaboration of stylistic motifs and a dramatic increase in vessel shape variability in both bowl and jar forms (see Hill, 1972/74, Plate V and Plate VI, Figs. 40-47; Marcos et al, 1999, Figs. 2c, and 3a,b). Distinctions include an increase in open bowl forms, some with cut and beveled as well as undulating rims, and concave bottoms and the appearance of anthropomorphic motifs (see Lathrap et al., 1975, p. 28, Fig. 20). Anthropomorphic motifs on Valdivia Phase III-V open bowls often mimic stylistic patterns found on the facial treatment of the fig urines. Some bowl forms are also clear imitations of halves of carved bottle gourds (Lathrap et al, 1975, p. 29). Stylistic motifs primarily consist of geo metric designs. However, the design motifs on bowls were usually made when the clay was leather hard, while those on jars were made when the clay was still moist (Staller, 1996b). Color differences are also evident. Open bowls are generally brown slipped while jars are red-or maroon-slipped (Staller, 1996b). Such technical and stylistic attributes are particularly characteris tic of the decorative treatment of ritual and ceremonial bowls and jars and may have metaphorical reference to the Spondylus/Strombus dyad (Paulsen, 1974; Staller, 1996b). The contrasting use of red slip zones and intentional smudging also begins to appear during the middle of the Valdivia sequence and continues with later Chorrera ceramics. Cooking pots (ollas) and storage vessels of Phase V of the Valdivia sequence introduce tall neck forms with geometric motifs and externally thickened rims (Marcos etal., 1999, Fig. 3b). Frequently, both sides of the rim are treated with a red or maroon slip while the rest of the vessel is the natural color of the fired clay (Lathrap et al., 1975, Fig. 21). Jars with constricted necks continue from the earlier phases, but the associated stylistic trend changes to incorporate patterns found on bowls. During the final portion of the culture sequence Valdivia settlements expanded inland in the subregions of SW coastal Ecuador, the Gulf of Guayaquil, coastal El Oro, and S. Manabi (Fig. 6). In N Manabi, there is an occupational expansion along the riverine environments during Phase VIII. Ceramic diagnostics pertaining to the final portion of the Valdivia sequence indicate considerable stylistic and formal variability among subregions. Valdivia VI-VIII diagnostics indicate an even greater variability in ves sel forms and stylistic attributes than the middle portion of the sequence (Fig. 7). Jars with cambered rims and deeply concave necks and jars with loop handles appear during Phase VI and continue to Phase VIII over most of coastal Ecuador. However, after Phase VI striking technological changes occur, including a proliferation of composite forms, and a shift from a strictly coiling based technology to forming techniques that include the</page><page sequence="25">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 217 DISTRIBUTION OF EARLY AND LATE VALDIVIA OCCUPATION COLOMBIA Manta La Plata Island Loma Alta Valdivia Punta Conception Real Alto Equator - International Boundary Provincial Boundary Provincial Capital Early Sites (3500-2200 BC) Late Sites (2200-1500 BC) Modern Cities Pre-Hispanic Site 300 Meter Contour Fig. 6.

Such technological changes are most apparent in coastal El Oro and the Gulf of Guayaquil. It is also in these subregions that the earliest bottle forms appear in association with Valdivia VII-VIII diagnostics at sites such as La Emerenciana, La Cadena, Milagro I, and San Lorenzo del Mate (Fig. 8). The three basic shapes of Valdivia VII-VIII bottles are long neck single spouts, carinated spouts, and stirrup spouts (Gonzalez de Merino, 1984, p. 97; Marcos, 1989, p. 16; Marcos et ai, 1999, Fig. 4; Reindel and Guillaume-Gentil, 1995; Staller, 1994, Figs. 45-53, 2001, Figs. 22-28). Single spout and carinated spouts were identified at La Cadena, Milagro I and at San Lorenzo del Mate, while all three kinds of bot tle forms are present in the Jelf Phase complex from La Emerenciana. From a developmental standpoint, single spouts are diagnostic of the later Chor rera and related ceramic complexes, however stirrup-spouts were initially thought to be solely restricted to the Machalilla tradition (Lathrap etal., 1975, Fig. 31; Meggers et al., 1965, Plate 155). Phase VII-VIII diagnostics also</page><page sequence="27">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 219 b.) Fig. 8. Diagnostic vessel forms from the Valdivia VII-VIII component at San Lorenzo del Mate located in the Rio Mate Valley, within the Gulf of Guayaquil subregion and the Phase VII component from Real Alto located along the Rio Verde in SW coastal Ecuador, (a) Phase VII diag nostics (b) Phase VIII diagnostics (after Marcos et 0/., 1999, Fig. 4). include bowls and jars with externally everted rims and hollow stirrup han dles, bowls with vertical walls and flat bottoms, as well as constricted bowls, bowls with pedestal bases and plates with out-flaring walls (Lathrap et al, 1975, p. 31, Figs. 38,43,44; Staller, 2001, Figs. 16b, 17,19-21,27c, 29; Zeidler and Sutliff, 1994, Fig. 7.1a,b). Pedestal bowls continue to be manufactured with the later Formative assemblages, as do the externally everted jars and open bowls with vertical or slightly incurving walls. Neckless cooking pots (ollas) or tecomate forms also appear in SW coastal Ecuador, the Gulf regions, and coastal El Oro for the first time during Valdivia VI-VIII (Marcos, 1989, p. 16; Marcos et a/., 1999, Fig. 4; Meggers et al, 1965, Plate 99c; Staller, 2001, Fig. 18). Such ollas are found with the Machalilla Phase (Lathrap et al, 1975, Fig. 29) and are diagnostic of early Initial Period pottery from the North and Central coast of Peru. Phase VII VIII stylistic and decorative trends include zoned punctation and incision, step motifs, shell scraping, engraving, brushing, combing and the earliest evidence of polychrome decoration on bowls, and shoulder bosses, nubbin appliques, and applique fillet strips on jar forms. All of these attributes ap pear during Phase VI and continue to the end of the sequence in coastal El Oro and the Gulf of Guayaquil. Other distinctive Valdivia VII-VIII attributes in these subregions include the use of post fired paint, red slipped bands, and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic effigy vessels. Effigy vessels are the hallmarks of the later Machalilla and Chorrera ceramic complexes, and the use of post fired paint and red slip bands are particularly diagnos tic of Machalilla. The stylistic and technological attributes that characterize Valdivia pottery from the subregions of SW coastal Ecuador, coastal El Oro</page><page sequence="28">220 Staller and the Gulf of Guayaquil strongly suggest that the various Formative ce ramic traditions are developmentally related. Valdivia VIII Piquigua Phase (3700-3570 B.p.) pottery from the Rio Jama drainage in N Manabf has developmental similarities to late Valdivia pottery from coastal El Oro and the Gulf of Guayaquil, but is also distinct in various ways (Zeidler, 1992,1994, Table 6.2; Zeidler and Sutliff, 1994, Fig. 7.1). It is clear that the Piquigua Phase complex is directly derived from the earlier, more well known Valdivia VIII diagnostics from S Manabf and SW coastal Ecuador. Zeidler and Sutliff (1994, pp. 112-114, Fig. 7.1) have identified six vessel shapes associated with this component (Fig. 9). All but the curvilinear ollas with nubbin appliques on the shoulders and neck are present in the Jell Phase ceramic complex from coastal El Oro. However, the elaboration of Fig. 9. Diagnostic vessel forms of the Valdivia VIII Piquigua Phase complex at San Isidro and related sites of the Rio Jama Valley in N Manabf (after Zeidler and Sutliff; 1994, Fig. 7.1).</page><page sequence="29">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 221 decorative techniques and the predominance of motifs consisting of zoned incision and punctation (especially on bowls) and the apparent absence of any bottle forms or neckless ollas distinguish the northern tradition. Other distinguishing features include elaborately incised cooking pots with un dulating rims and decorated ceramic lids such as those from San Lorenzo del Mate (Fig. 8). Stylistic attributes associated with Piquigua Phase pot tery include, certain bowl forms, and decorative attributes such as post fired paint, shell scraping, red banding, and fillet appliques. However, associating Piquigua Phase diagnostics to the later Tabuchila Phase ceramic complexes is more problematic than with the Valdivia VI-VIII traditions from the Gulf of Guayaquil and coastal El Oro. Developmental discontinuity is related to a presumed 500-year hiatus resulting from a volcanic eruption (Issacson, 1994). Furthermore, Machalilla sites have not as yet been identified in this subregion. Valdivia diagnostics pertaining to Phase VI-VIII indicate greater re gional variation in formal and stylistic attributes in the subregions (Cruz and Holm, 1982; Jadan, 1986; Marcos, 1989; Porras-Garces, 1973; Spath, 1980; Staller, 1994; Zeidler and Sutliff, 1994). When attempting to explain this some archaeologists have cited environmental differences, culture drift, or diffusion and migration (Lathrap, 1970; Meggers et a/., 1965; Spath, 1980). On the Punta Arena Peninsula, and at El Encanto on Puna Island Phase VI-VIII Valdivia sherds were examined by Spath (1980, pp. 71-74, 167) and interpreted as a regional variant of Valdivia. Technological and stylis tic differences from the better-known Valdivia diagnostics of SW coastal Ecuador and S Manabf were initially perceived as related to economic dif ferences. Societies adapted to the Gulf of Guayaquil were "more dependent" upon maritime resources than Valdivia societies in SW coastal Ecuador and S Manabf who were perceived as almost totally dependent upon plant cul tivation (Lathrap et al., 1975; Marcos et al., 1976; Marcos et al, 1999; Spath, 1980; Zevallos et al, 1977). Valdivia occupation in the Gulf of Guayaquil was interpreted as an example of cultural drift, a regional variant affected in various ways by independent historical developments (Porras-Garces, 1973; Spath, 1980). Rather than focus upon sociocultural development, chronology, or culture process, most archaeologists implicitly assumed that the total range of vari ability for the Valdivia tradition had been already documented (Ledergerber, 1983). However, the notion that regional differences in the Phase VI-VIII pottery assemblages from the Gulf of Guayaquil were a result of greater maritime resource exploitation was contradicted by faunal evidence, which shows a continued maritime focus (at least by coastal communities) in SW coastal Ecuador and S Manabf (Byrd, 1976; Lanning, 1968; Meggers et al, 1965; Staller, 1994). The most recent evidence from faunal analysis, analysis</page><page sequence="30">222 Staller of shellfish, and site distributions in the various subregions, during differ ent periods suggest the Valdivia economy was always mixed, involving the exploitation of a variety of distinct environmental zones, during different seasons. In a study of the development of pottery technology in the New World, Hoopes (1994) maintains that with increasing information regarding specific regional sequences, the ability to make broad comparisons among pottery sequences significantly declines. Such regional diversity is already apparent by the final portion of the Valdivia Phase and unequivocal by Late Forma tive times (Beckwith, 1996). The most recent analyses of Valdivia VI-VIII pottery from outside SW coastal Ecuador indicate that ceramic innovation was influencing and influenced by a variety of diverse historical and cultural processes beyond the Ecuadorian coast (Staller, 1994, pp. 391-399). Some time between 4200 and 3650 B.R ceramic innovation spread throughout the lowland and highland regions of western South America. It is also at this time that the first clear evidence of complexity appears in the archaeological record of the Andes. Most specialists on the Ecuadorian Formative recognize a significant technological and stylistic divergence in Valdivia ceramics during and after Phase III (Lathrap et aL, 1977; Marcos and Manrique, 1988; Staller, 1994; Zeidler, 1984) featuring increased variability in vessel shape and in the degree of elaboration of decoration and stylistic attributes. In southern El Oro and the Gulf of Guayaquil there is also a dramatic proliferation of composite forms after Phase VI characterized by a shift from a coil based ceramic technology to a variety of different forming techniques during the final portion of the ceramic sequence throughout coastal Ecuador (Staller, 1994, 2001). However, such technological changes were not as apparent in the Phase VII-VIII diagnostics from SW coastal Ecuador and N and S Manabi. The differences between Phase VII-VIII diagnostics from differ ent subregions in part explain why a developmental transition between Val divia and the later Formative ceramic traditions was so elusive for so many years. Another important factor influencing the regional variability evident during Valdivia VI-VIII is related to changes in the subsistence adaptation. Geographic expansion by Valdivia populations into the Gulf of Guayaquil and coastal El Oro after Phase III, and into N Manabi after Phase VII im plies a greater focus upon plant cultivation by riverine communities located inland. These subregions have a higher average annual precipitation than SW coastal Ecuador and are generally more amenable to agriculture. An other important factor affecting the regional variability and is related to long-distance interaction and the development of more complex forms of social organization (Staller, 1992/93).</page><page sequence="31">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 223 The early settlement surveys in SW coastal Ecuador and southern Manabi indicated that Valdivia VI-VIII sites were fewer and smaller than sites with earlier occupations (Damp, 1984a; Estrada, 1956; Lanning, 1968; Lathrap et al.91977; Schwarz and Raymond, 1996). For example, Meggers et al. (1965) emphasized pottery diagnostics from late Valdivia sites in the Punta Arena Peninsula to define their Period D. They explained these occu pations as a result Valdivia migrations from SW coastal Ecuador into the Gulf of Guayaquil. Later, Columbia University surveys in S W coastal Ecuador un covered similar chronological patterns in Valdivia settlement and indicated that Phase VI-VIII sites were rare, and restricted to small coastal localities (Lanning, 1968). Although Lanning (1968) isolated Phase VI diagnostics he found them to be rare in the Santa Elena Peninsula. Later investigations in this subregion (Damp, 1984a; Damp et al, 1990; Ferdon, 1981; Schwarz and Raymond, 1996) imply that the rarity of post Phase V occupations may be reflecting a reduction of mangrove habitats due to either ENSO, geomor phological change and/or human overexploitation (Staller, 1994). Today, the mangrove formation that once existed in SW coastal Ecuador has all but disappeared. The apparent ancient degradation of this habitat supports the premise that coastal populations continued to exploit maritime resources even after inland populations had shifted to a mixed economy partly based upon plant cultivation. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS AND SUBREGIONAL CHRONOLOGIES The Valdivia Phase was originally divided into four subphases desig nated from early to late as Periods A-D (Meggers etal, 1965). Subsequently a number of other chronologies were presented (Table V). The most recent research indicates that these various chronologies may be reflecting dif ferences in the intensity of archaeological research as well as pre-Hispanic occupation in the various subregions (Staller, 1994). On the basis of regional survey and laboratory analysis of artifact collections of Formative material culture from SW coastal Ecuador, S Manabi, and the Gulf of Guayaquil, Lanning (1968) proposed a preliminary ceramic sequence of nine phases. Lanning (1960,1963,1968) had a regional perspective unique among Andean scholars of his generation. He was the only North American archaeolo gist to study the early Formative pottery of coastal Ecuador, as well as the earliest Initial Period ceramics from far north and the North and Central Coasts of Peru. On the basis of this analytical background, he correctly surmised that Valdivia pottery technology was a precocious coastal phe nomenon that evolved in situ and, furthermore, despite an absence of direct</page><page sequence="32">224 Staller Table V.

Later, Hill (1972/74) reanalyzed the Columbia University collections and presented a revised eight phase (Phase I-VIII) ceramic seriation. This analysis was based upon stylistic attributes, vessel forms, themes, and decora tive patterns (see Rowe, 1960,1961). Hill found a discontinuous frequency curve between fillet applique and brushed attributes when attempting to merge Period C diagnostics from Buena Vista, with those excavated at the Valdivia type-site (Hill, 1972/74, pp. 19, 24). She attributed the discontinu ity to mixed layers in the Cut 1 excavations at the site of Buena Vista by Meggers et al. (1965). The Cut 1 excavation was in arbitrary increments on a sloping river terrace at the base of a steep hill (Meggers et al, 1965, p. 18). Hill (1972/74, pp. 19-20,25) further contended that inverted stratigraphy or secondary deposits indicated that late Period C diagnostics were in fact early Period C or Phase VI. The preference for the eight-phase sequence over the Period A-D se riation is related in part to the recognition that Period C at Buena Vista actually corresponds to Phase VI (Fig. 10). On the other hand, weaknesses with the Hill seriation, include small sample sizes, and an absence of strati graphic evidence and dates to establish phase distinctions due to shallow, disturbed archaeological deposits, which Hill (1972/74, p. 15) mentions in the published report.

The middle portion of the sequence (Phases III-V) was based upon surface finds from four disturbed middens west of La Libertad (Hill, 1972/74, pp. 20-21). Phase divisions were arbitrary since reliable temporal differences were stylistically based primarily from surface collections (Hill, 1972/74, pp. 13,15). A series of 21 uncalibrated 14C dates ranging between 4950 and 2950 B.P. initially established the Valdivia cultural chronology (Evans et al, 1959; Meggers, 1966, pp. 34-42; Meggers etal, 1965, pp. 149,151). Columbia Uni versity excavations at two sites (G-42A and G-172) reported dates ranging from 4750 to 3250 B.P. (Lanning, 1967, p. 85; Willey, 1971, p. 270). However, later dates from Loma Alta placed the beginning of the culture sequence to between 5450 and 5250 B.P. (Damp, 1979,1984a; Norton, 1972,1977,1982; Stahl, 1984). Early estimates for the end of the ceramic sequence were based upon several Machalilla14 C dates, as well as some Chorrera dates (Meggers, 1966; Meggers et al, 1965). Phase VII and VIII of the Valdivia culture sequence was tentatively postulated by Hill from two corrected dates from site OGSE-46B, a 2870 1940 B.C. [L-1232H; 3900 B.P. ? 150 years] date, and another 2570-1740 B.C. [L-1232I; 3750 B.P. ? 150 years] date associated with Phase VII pottery (Hill, 1972/74, p. 21). These dates were rather imprecise, suggesting the culture sequence ended sometime after 4250 B.P. (Hill, 1972/74). A shell sample from Buena Vista with a date of 1890-1620 B.C. [SI-69; 3450 B.P. ? 50 years] still placed the end date at ca. 3650 B.P. (Meggers etal, 1965, p. 149). Despite a paucity of 14C dates for the end of the culture sequence, most archaeologists have contended Machalilla was later than and probably a developmental outgrowth of the Valdivia tradition (Bischof, 1967, p. 217, 1975; Lanning, 1967, p. 9,1968, pp. 39,41-42; Lathrap, 1971, pp. 84-85; Lathrap et al, 1975, pp. 16,33-34; Lathrap etal, 1977, p. 6; Pearsall, 1979, p. 6). The dividing line between Valdivia and Machalilla Phase cultures was initially estimated at ca. 3450 ? 200 B.P., with Machalilla terminating at ca. 2950 B.P. (Willey, 1971, p. 353). Geographic, cultural and developmental factors explain the difficulty in documenting the end of the Valdivia culture sequence. Most of the early research was confined to the SW coast where settlement surveys and excava tions recorded the presence of the earliest Valdivia occupations (see Fig. 6). It is now possible to see the relative scarcity of late Valdivia occupation in SW coastal Ecuador as related in part to a reduction of the mangrove formation, and to settlement expansion after Phase III to the N, S, and SE, and finally into N Manabi (Staller, 1994,2000a). Changes in the geographic distribution</page><page sequence="35">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 227 of Valdivia occupation is suggested to be related to an increased dependence upon plant cultivation by inland populations especially after Phase VI, when maize appears in the various subregions (Staller and Thompson, in press). The 14 C measurements of samples from the site of San Isidro in N Manabi Province give an end date for the Valdivia Phase of between 3500 and 3630 B.R (Marcos, 1988a, p. 79; Zeidler, 1994, p. 107). These dates are consistent with those reported from Valdivia VIII contexts at site of Ayal&amp;n and the Anllulla shell mound in the Gulf of Guayaquil (Lubensky, 1980, 1995). Similar results were also derived from 14C assays and AMS dates from Phase VII-VIII layers at La Emerenciana in coastal El Oro. The calibrated 14C measurements and AMS dates from La Emerenciana suggest an end date of ca. 1450 B.C. for the Valdivia culture sequence (Staller, 2001, Tables 1 and 2; Staller and Thompson, in press). All of these calibrated 14C measurements taken together suggest an end date ranging between 1650 1450 B.C. (Table VI). Table VI.

Most of the initial hypotheses regarding sociocultural development of the Formative cultures of coastal Ecuador were ensconced in a cultural-historical diffusionary framework. Technological innovations were assumed to be based upon a Formative substrate reflected by the degree of stylistic and formal similarities among the various Formative ceramic com plexes (Hoopes, 1994). Such reasoning led to many differing interpretations. For example, Lathrap (1970, p. 67) suggested that the Machalilla culture was of tropical origin, citing stylistic affinities between Machalilla and late Tutishcainyo and Sanidine pottery in the Ucayali valley, and sherds from the earliest levels at the southern highland site of Cerro Narrio (Collier and Murra, 1943, Plates 16-17). However, the stylistic trends and distinct vessel forms that differentiated Machalilla from Valdivia, such as red slip bands, engraving, post fired paint, ceramic bottle forms, and a proliferation of composite forms already begin to appear in the Valdivia VI-VIII diag nostics from the Gulf of Guayaquil and coastal El Oro subregions. In other publications, Lathrap has stated that Valdivia and Machalilla were both a result of a diffusion of floodplain farmers from the tropical forests east of the Andes (Lathrap, 1971,1973,1974). Linking the Valdivia and Machalilla complexes to the early ceramic cultures of the tropical forests was at the time a provocative alternative to traditional ways of thinking about diffusion and migrations, but little was known about the antiquity of pottery bearing cul tures in eastern Ecuador. Recent research has indicated that Machalilla related sites are solely re stricted to the subregions of S Manabi, SW coastal Ecuador, and the Punta Arenas Peninsula in the Gulf of Guayaquil, and coastal El Oro (Fig. 11). It is precisely in these subregions that Meggers etal., (1965) concentrated their research, and it has been assumed that Machalilla and Valdivia related sites were similarly distributed. The research has now indicated that the chronol ogy and distribution of Machalilla related sites are much more complex than had been thought. Moreover, there is strong stylistic evidence that the early pottery at Cerro Narrio and Cotocollao in the Ecuadorian Andes has strong affinities to Machalilla (Lathrap, 1970, 1973; Lathrap et al., 1975; Villalba, 1988). The Machalilla Phase was initially identified by Bushnell (1951, pp. 17-21) from excavations at two sites near La Libertad on the Santa Elena Peninsula. Machalilla ceramic diagnostics were later described by Estrada (1958, pp. 13, 53) from excavations at the type-site (M-24). Numerous Machalilla shell middens have been identified in SW coastal Ecuador and S Manabi Province (Estrada, 1958; Meggers etal., 1965, Fig. 2). He (Estrada, 1958, pp. 55,94) assigned Machalilla an intermediate chronological position</page><page sequence="37">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 229 Fig. 11. Distribution of Machalilla Phase sites in coastal Ecuador.</page><page sequence="38">230 Staller between Valdivia and Chorrera, asserting that red banded and engraved sherds represented a single ceramic complex. Estrada (1958, pp. 55, 111) ini tially interpreted Machalilla as a developmental outgrowth of the Valdivia tradition, and later speculated that the corrugated wares were stylistically similar to those from the mouth of the Rio Amazon. Machalilla was later seen as a result of the diffusion of pre-Hispanic societies from Mesoamerica into coastal Ecuador at approximately the same time that Valdivia mate rial culture was disappearing from the region (Estrada et al., 1962, p. 174). Therefore, Machalilla was perceived as having Mesoamerican origins, and several archaeologists took an identical position for the succeeding Chor rera Phase (Bushnell, 1982; Coe, 1960, pp. 368-369; Evans and Meggers, 1957, p. 243,1966, pp. 203-204; 1982, p. 125; Lathrap, 1960, p. 126; Meggers, 1972, pp. 74-75). Hie most recent evidence from coastal El Oro and the Gulf of Guayaquil indicates Machalilla and Chorrera developed out of the Valdivia tradition. Such a developmental scenario is also consistent with evidence from coastal El Oro and the Gulf of Guayaquil, but is more problematic in N Manabf, where Machalilla is apparently absent and there is a hiatus between early Chorrera and Valdivia VIII. Although most Ecuadorian specialists now per ceive Valdivia and Machalilla as part of the same ceramic tradition, a devel opmental transition has yet to be identified in SW coastal Ecuador. A transition was elusive because early Machalilla ceramic diagnostics were absent at the type-site and at La Cabuya (G-159) (Meggers and Evans, 1962). Meggers et al. (1965) defined the Machalilla tradition on the basis of type frequencies, dividing the sequence into three subphases A to C, ranging between 3950 to 3000 B.P. (Table VI). A14C assay [W-630; 4050 B.P. ? 200 years] taken from late Valdivia lev els thought to contain Machalilla trade sherds indicated a date for the pre sumed arrival of Machalilla migrants into coastal Ecuador (Meggers et al, 1965, p. 172; Meggers and Evans, 1962, p. 191). The presence of presumed Machalilla "trade" pottery in late Valdivia stratigraphic layers at both La Cabuya and Buena Vista led to the conclusion that the two earliest Machalilla subphases (A and B) were coeval with Valdivia C and D (Meggers etal., 1965, p. 87). Meggers et al. (1965, pp. 173-178) further suggested that Machalilla was coeval with and chronologically later than Valdivia, a result of a cultural diffusion from an undetermined region beyond the coast (see also Meggers, 1966, pp. 47-51). Despite a presumed overlap of some 600-700 years, stylistic and technological similarities were surprisingly absent, and Machalilla cul ture was interpreted as completely distinct from Valdivia (Estrada, 1962a, p. 64; Meggers, 1966, pp. 47-51,62; Meggers et al., 1965, pp. 18-21,110-146; Meggers and Evans, 1962, p. 191). Stirrup-spout fragments and sherds with red slip bands from the surface and uppermost layers of the Valdivia type-site</page><page sequence="39">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 231 also supported their hypotheses regarding the origins and developmental re lationships of these culture phases (Estrada, 1958, Cuadro 2; Meggers et al, 1965, pp. 110-146). Machalilla sherds in the uppermost levels of Period D Valdivia occupation layers were considered to represent the early portion of the ceramic sequence (Estrada, 1958; Hill, 1972/74; Meggers et al., 1965). The chronological range for Machalilla was therefore initially established by 14C measurements from samples taken from Valdivia C and D deposits. The presumed early Machalilla diagnostics were likewise sherds taken from late Valdivia occupation layers. On the basis of the ceramic evidence from coastal El Oro and the Gulf of Guayaquil, it is now apparent that what were initially assumed to be early Machalilla diagnostics could just as well have been late Valdivia. Many archaeologists challenged the assertion that Valdivia and Machalilla were coeval, maintaining instead that the presumed overlap was rather a result of mixing or inverted stratigraphy (Bischof, 1967, p. 219,1975, p. 50; Collier, 1968, p. 271; Hill, 1972/74, p. 19; Lanning, 1968, p. 47; Lathrap, 1967, p. 98; Paulsen and McDougle, 1974, pp. 4-5). Some cited the excava tions at Buena Vista, which was dug on a sloping river terrace at the base of a hill, and pointed out that only 21 of the 9800 sherds recovered from below 80 cm were Machalilla diagnostics (Hill, 1972/74, pp. 19-20; Lathrap, 1967, p. 98). Rather than representing an intrusion, the evidence could also infer that Machalilla succeeded Valdivia chronologically (Bischof, 1967, p. 217; Hill, 1972/74, p. 19; Lanning, 1967, p. 9,1968, pp. 47-50; Lathrap, 1967, p. 98, 1971, pp. 84-85; Lathrap et al., 1975, p. 33). Moreover, 14C measurements at La Cabuya are inverted, also suggesting the possibility of mixing in those ex cavations (Meggers et al., 1965, pp. 149-152). Furthermore, Machalilla layers at many sites in SW coastal Ecuador were unusually thin, ranging between only 5 and 25 cm in thickness and they were often separated from underlying Valdivia deposits by a thin sterile layer (Lippi, 1983). The presumed mixing of Machalilla and Valdivia layers was attributed to these typically shallow occupation layers (Estrada, 1958, p. 55; Lanning, 1968). Early estimates for the end of the Valdivia sequence were also indirect, based upon a series 14 C measurements of samples taken from Machalilla layers at the sites of La Libertad and La Cabuya (Meggers et al., 1965; Meggers, 1966). A dividing line was arbitrarily placed at 3450 ? 200 years, with Machalilla terminating at ca. 2950 B.P. (Meggers et al., 1965, p. 149; Willey, 1971, p. 353). Some scholars were concerned with the possibility of a developmental link between Valdivia and Machalilla. One of the first and perhaps most successful tests of the hypothesis was by Bischof (1975, p. 51). The focus of his investigations at Palmar 3 (G-88) a locality near Valdivia (G-31) was defining early Machalilla diagnostics. However, this goal was complicated by a stratigraphic separation between the Valdivia and Machalilla occupation</page><page sequence="40">232 Staller layers at that site. The total absence of early Machalilla diagnostics made the results of this research inconclusive (Bischof, 1975, pp. 54-55). Using ceramic diagnostics and radiocarbon dates, he divided Machalilla into five 150-200 year periods, with an initial date at 3750-3550 B.P. for Phase II (Bischof, 1975, p. 51). A hypothetical transition consisting of stylistic attributes such as fil let applique, brushing, red slip banding, and shell scraping was presented. Significantly, the Jelf Phase diagnostic attributes and 14 C measurements from La Emerenciana are to a large degree consistent with such a transition (Staller, 2001), and the single and stirrup-spout bottles, carinated jars, and constricted bowls identified with the Jell Phase complex appear to provide a developmental link between these ceramic components (Staller, 1994, 2001). Paulsen and McDougle (1974,1981) also reported a stratigraphic sepa ration between late Valdivia and early Machalilla at two sites in SW coastal Ecuador. On the basis of their excavations they subdivided Machalilla into five subphases (Table VI) ranging between 3250 and 2850 B.P. (Paulsen and McDougle, 1974, pp. 7-14). Supporting Lanning (1968) and others (Bischof and Viteri, 1972, p. 549; Lathrap, 1967, p. 97) Paulsen and McDougle (1981) contended they were not coeval, but rather chronologically distinct cultures. Archaeological investigations at two sites in SW coastal Ecuador by Lippi (1982, 1983) produced radiocarbon measurements ranging between 3150 and 2750 B.P However, the excavations at Rio Per dido and La Ponga also recorded a stratigraphic separation between Machalilla and Valdivia layers (Fig. 10). On the basis of this inconclusive evidence Lippi (1983, p. 39) concluded that Machalilla was an in situ development representing the Middle Formative Period, and presented a cultural sequence ranging between 3350 and 2750 B.P. for SW coastal Ecuador. In the context of this research he introduced a revised pottery seriation subdividing Machalilla ceramics into eight phases averaging 50 years each (Lippi, 1983, p. 354). The difficulty in documenting a developmental transition between the Valdivia and Machalilla ceramic complexes was related to a number of fac tors: (1) One of the critical factors was where the early research was concen trated. There appears to have been a clear disjunction between late Valdivia early Machalilla site locations in S Manabi and S W coastal Ecuador and most all of the early research on the Ecuadorian Formative was restricted to these subregions. Changes in late Valdivia and early Machalilla settlement patterns in these subregions appear to coincide with the disappearance of Valdivia diagnostics and predominance Machalilla material culture particularly along the S Manabi coast. Stratigraphic and faunal evidence from La Emerenciana suggest that such widespread changes in site location may be related in part to climatic and environmental factors, perhaps to ENSO. Stratigraphically, the uppermost layer at La Emerenciana represents a sudden transgressive</page><page sequence="41">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 233 event in what is an overall progradational stratigraphic sequence. A dramatic reduction in the distribution and size of various marine shell species associ ated with this uppermost layer infer climatic and environmental changes to a calibrated date of approximately 1450 B.C. (Staller, 2001, Table 1; Staller and Thompson, in press, Tables 9A and 9B). (2) Changes in coastal geomorphol ogy may be another primary factor affecting the changes in site location. SW coastal Ecuador and S Manabi have undergone significant geological changes since the beginning of the Holocene (Damp et al, 1990), related to periods of intense flooding, short-term changes in sea levels brought on by ENSO cycles, as well as tectonic uplift and subsidence. Such changes could have a profound effect on the hydrology and consequently on pre-Hispanic site location. It is apparent from the Machalilla occupational debris found on summits of steep cliffs along S Manabi Province that such geomorphological changes coincided with this time period. Such geological changes may be in part responsible for the disappearance of the mangrove formations (Damp et a/., 1990; Ferdon, 1981; Staller, 1994; Willey, 1971, p. 247). (3) There was a gradual, but nevertheless widespread adaptive change to a greater depen dence upon agriculture throughout the coast between 4150 and 3500 B.P. (4) Finally, the prevailing theoretical assumption that culture change and the spread and early development of technological innovation was directly related to migrations, diffusions, and invasions. Another assumption was that the spread of technological innovation was from regions of greater so ciocultural complexity and richer more highly productive environments to areas with more limited carrying capacity and less complex forms of social organization (Hoopes, 1994). Archaeological research in the subregions of coastal El Oro and the Gulf of Guayaquil has greatly revised our perceptions regarding ceramic development during the final epochs of the Valdivia tradition, particularly the investigations by Cruz and Holm (1982) at the Valdivia VII-VIII cere monial center at San Lorenzo del Mate. This important site is on an ancient beach terrace on the eastern banks of the Rio Mate (Cruz and Holm, 1982; Marcos, 1989; Staller, 1998,2000b). An artificial earthen mound measuring 8 m in height and 60 m in diameter called attention to the late Valdivia component and the Phase VII-VIII diagnostics have affinities to the Jelf Phase at La Emerenciana (Marcos 1989; Marcos et al, 1999; Staller 1998, 2000b). When these are compared to the ceramic diagnostics from San Isidro it is obvious that the final portion of the ceramic sequence represents a dra matic technological and stylistic departure from diagnostics pertaining to the earlier part of the sequence. A significant developmental trend is the appearance of composite forms including a variety of ceramic bottles and a shift from a strictly coil based technology to a variety of forming techniques. Such technological changes also appear in the Valdivia anthropomorphic</page><page sequence="42">234 Staller figurines (Evans etal, 1959; Lathrap etal, 1975; Marcos and Manrique, 1988; Meggers et al., 1965). Valdivia figurines were initially manufactured using a double coiling technique, while the torsos and heads of Valdivia VII-VIII Fe line Style figurines at San Lorenzo del Mate are made of composite parts and like later Machalilla figurines have eyes made from clay coffee bean applique pellets (Staller, 1998, 2000b, Figs. 8-10). Such technological characteristics and stylistic attributes indicate a clear developmental link to later Machalilla and Chorrera anthropomorphic figurines, further supporting an in situ cul tural development for the Ecuadorian Formative (Staller, 1998,2000b). THE LATE FORMATIVE PERIOD Chorrera Phase represents the Late Formative Period of coastal Ecuador. Many stylistic and technological elements found in Chorrera and Chorrera related ceramics have their basis in the earlier Machalilla and Valdivia Phases (Bischof; 1982; Evans and Meggers, 1982, p. 122; Lathrap et ah, 1975, p. 34). Most scholars perceive Chorrera as the artistic pinnacle of pre-Columbian Ecuadorian ceramic art (Estrada, 1958; Lathrap et al, 1975; Meggers, 1966). The tradition incorporates a wide variety of sophisti cated and finely crafted bowls, whistling bottles, and elaborately constructed zoomorphic and anthropomorphic effigy forms (Lathrap et aL, 1975, p. 34). Because of the aesthetics of the pottery and figurines much of what is known about Chorrera Phase comes from unprovenienced private and museum col lections. Relatively little is known regarding regional settlement patterns, subsistence, or sociocultural development (Beckwith, 1996, p. 1; Engwall, 1995; Weinstein, 1998). This also led scholars of pre-Columbian art to form distinct opinions with regard to the appearance of Chorrera material culture. More recent research has shown that Chorrera Phase, as currently defined, is much more variable in terms of certain vessel forms and associated deco rative motifs (Beckwith, 1996). Such regional differences in Late Formative pottery may be seen as a direct outgrowth of the regional variability initially manifest during Valdivia VII-VIII times, indicating the developmental in terrelationships of the Formative Period cultures of coastal Ecuador are extremely complex and highly regional in nature. These regional differences are primarily present in the utilitarian vessels, cooking pots and particularly bowls (Beckwith, 1996). It is however the stylistic and symbolic similari ties in the whistling bottles, effigy vessels, and anthropomorphic figurines that appears to unite the Late Formative regional phases ideologically and stylistically. Bushnell (1951) initially reported on the Late Formative Period from excavations at the Engoroy cemetery in the Santa Elena Peninsula, and</page><page sequence="43">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 235 classified the ceramic complex as the Engoroy Phase (see, also, Zevallos, 1965/66). Later, Evans and Meggers (1957) defined the Chorrera Phase from excavations at the Hacienda La Chorrera located along the Babahoya River. Estrada (1957,1958,1962a) carried out extensive research on Late Formative Period sites in various subregions classifying the ceramic complexes in the N and S Manabi coasts, as well as on the western cordillera (yumbos) near Santo Domingo de los Colorados as, Olon, Veliz, and Tabuchila. On the basis of this research, Estrada (1958, p. 69) concluded that regional ceramic complexes such as Engoroy, Olon, and Tabuchila shared broad stylistic characteristics, which were subsumed under the single rubric of Chorrera Phase (also see Meggers, 1966, pp. 55-61; Evans and Meggers, 1954, 1957, 1982, p. 124). Although this was meant to be a heuristic device, it has become reified over time into a concept of a Chorrera style (Cummins, 1992, pp. 67-78; Engwall, 1995). ORIGINS AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE CHORRERA PHASE Initially, Estrada (1958) perceived Chorrera as the quintessential Ecuadorian pottery complex but later, along with Evans and Meggers in terpreted Chorrera culture as a migration from Mesoamerica on the basis of stylistic similarities to Ochos Phase pottery from coastal Guatemala (see Coe and Flannery, 1967). Subsequently, archaeological investigations on the Chorrera Phase have focused upon the recovery of artifacts from single sites throughout coastal Ecuador and the Guayas Basin. Principal contributions have consisted of descriptive studies of Late Formative Period material cul ture and the establishment of local chronologies (Aleto, 1988; Beckwith, 1996; Bischof, 1975; Cummins, 1992; Engwall, 1992, 1995; Marcos, 1982; Parducci and Parducci, 1975; Paulsen and McDougle, 1981; Simmons, 1970; Zedeno, 1985,1987; Zeidler and Sutliff, 1994; Zevallos, 1965/66). Late Formative Period sites classified as the Tachina Phase have also been identified in the north in coastal Esmeraldas Province (Lopez y Sebastian and Caillavet, 1979). However, inland sites have yet to be identi fied in that region (Engwall, 1996). With the exception of the recent research in northern Manabi, the relative paucity of systematic large-scale research on the Late Formative Period is surprising given the elaborate Chorrera material culture and the fact that it is the most widespread complex in pre Hispanic Ecuador (Cummins, 1992; Engwall, 1995; Estrada, 1958). Veliz Mendoza (1990, p. 31) and Staller (2000a) indicate that Late Formative oc cupations are distributed throughout the river drainages in the Guayas Basin extending south to the Peruvian border (Fig. 12). In Far North Peru, Izumi and Terada (1966) have identified the Pechiche Phase ceramic complex,</page><page sequence="44">236 Staller DISTRIBUTIONS OF CHORRERA PHASE OCCUPATION Late Cotocollao Arenillas Phase Engoroy Phase Pechiche Phase Early Narrio Early Jubones Chorrera Phase N Equator - Pacific Ocean 0 Kilometers 1_ Archaeological Sites 300 Meter Contour Fig. 12.

Although the Late For mative Period Arenillas Phase, and Jubones Phase are undefined in terms of stylistic and technological attributes, these finely crafted ceramics have similarities to what has been reported from La Chorrera (Fig. 10) and may be seen as regional expression of a Chorrera style (Staller, 1994, 2000a). The early diagnostics from Cerro Narrio and the nearby site of Pirincay also have clear affinities to late Valdivia-early Machalilla and Chorrera related assemblages on the coast (Bruhns et al, 1990; Collier and Murra, 1943). When archeological investigations were being carried out at Cerro Narrio the antiquity of the early occupations at that site was unknown (Collier and Murra, 1943, pp. 11-15). More recent comparative analysis by the au thor of the Cerro Narrio collections has indicated that ceramic innovation in highland Canar and Azuay Province shows stylistic and technological influence from the Valdivia VII-VIII Jell Phase complex from coastal El Oro and that such stylistic affinities continued throughout the Late For mative Period. In the valley of Quito to the north, Formative pottery at Cotocollao also indicates strong stylistic influences with coastal assemblages from various subregions (see Villalba, 1988, p. 241, Figs. 92-93, 95, 114 115,134-135). The Chorrera style, thus, is a widespread phenomenon and that it may be properly defined as a horizon (Meggers, 1966, p. 65; Willey, 1962). Having established Chorrera as a widespread entity (Estrada, 1957, 1958,1962a; Evans and Meggers, 1954; Meggers, 1966), Meggers etal (1965) explained the dispersal in terms of a bifurcated wave: one extending along the coast and another wave extending inland along rivers with rich alluvial soils and ample precipitation. Chorrera migration was assumed to have been rapid, constituting a horizon style (also see Meggers, 1966, p. 65). Another inference drawn for a "horizon" is that the spread of material culture is in some way related to religious or cult activity which is culturally integrated by disparate populations (Burger, 1988; Cummins, 1992; Willey, 1962). Chor rera style is a horizon to the extent that the ritual and ceremonial vessels and figurines appear to have considerable symbolic homogeneity among different regional phases, a pattern consistent with an interregional integra tion of a cult or set of religious beliefs (Cummins, 1992, pp. 15-18). Signifi cantly, many Chorrera effigy vessels and polished stone mortars suggest the consumption of a variety of psychotropic plants consistent with shamanic practices (Cummins, 1992, Illustrations 33, 35, 37, 46, pp. 68-73; Weinstein, 1998). However, it is at this point premature to make any general state ments about cosmology before a regional synthesis of the ceramic style has been published. If Chorrera is a horizon style, then it begs the question of what makes up its material constituents. Bowls with annular bases, and thin,</page><page sequence="46">238 Staller highly polished, red slipped vessels are widespread, but attributes and fea tures which can be designated as widely distributed chronological markers are still unidentified (Engwall, 1996). One characteristic that distinguishes Late Formative pottery from the late Valdivia and early Machalilla wares is the thinness of the vessel walls and their overall fine craftsmanship, even of the utilitarian vessels. Such technological distinctions point to the develop ment of full-time craft specialists. Lanning (1968) was among the first to object to the notion of a Late For mative horizon, classifying Engoroy as a distinct regional entity. Lathrap and others (1975, p. 15) concurred maintaining Engoroy was unrepresentative and a less elaborate, variant of Chorrera. Subsequently, a number of schol ars have come to prefer to discuss the Late Formative pottery complexes in terms of regional manifestations rather than under the rubric of Chorrera (Aleto, 1988; Beckwith, 1996; Bischof, 1975; Cummins, 1992; Engwall, 1995, 1996; Lippi, 1983; Paulsen and McDougle, 1981; Simmons, 1970; Stothert, 1995). However, given the previously outlined regional distributions and developmental affinities, the regional variability of the pottery style may be explained to chronological and developmental differences. Estrada (1958) excavated more Late Formative Period sites than any other investigator before or since, and therefore had a breadth of knowledge regarding the regional assemblages that was unique among archaeologists. Estrada chose to label these regional phases under the rubric of Chorrera. As with ce ramic complexes of the earlier periods, the most complete descriptions of the Late Formative pottery come from sites in SW coastal Ecuador and S Manabf (Beckwith, 1996; Bischof, 1975; Bushnell, 1951,1982; Paulsen and McDougle, 1981) biasing the archaeological record. CHORRERA CHRONOLOGY The chronology of the Late Formative Period of coastal Ecuador was initially based upon forty-four 14 C and obsidian hydration dates from var ious subregions (Meggers, 1966, Fig. 4). Meggers derived a chronological range on this basis (Meggers, 1966, pp. 55-66). However, the 1840 ? 540 b.p. date was derived from obsidian hydration, and the earliest 14C measurement 2800 ? 115 b.p. has been questioned on contextual grounds (Meggers, 1966, Fig. 4; Meggers etai, 1965, Table H). Subsequently, the chronological range for the Late Formative was challenged. Archaeological investigations at San Isidro produced a [2845 ? 95 years AA-4140] date from the earliest Chorrera securely excavated contexts (Zeidler and Sutliff, 1994, p. 115). Bischof (1982, p. 162) also places the end of the Machalilla Phase and beginning of the Late Formative at approximately 2850 b.p, pointing out that the 2800 ?115 b.p.</page><page sequence="47">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 239 date from Veliz that may actually be derived from late Machalilla occupa tions at La Cabuya. Paulsen and McDougle (1974,1981) also report similar early dates for the Engoroy occupation at OGSE-46D and suggest a chrono logical range of 2850 to 2250 B.P. for this subregion. Along the Jama River in N Manabi, Engwall (1995) obtained a [2500 B.P. ? 160 years; ISGS-2377] date from a layer of volcanic tephra to mark the end of the Tabuchila Phase. This date agrees with the terminal date for the early estimates. Excavations at Dos Caminos (M3D2-008) produced three of the earliest dates for any Late Formative Period complex. The uncalibrated dates [ISGS-3308; 2930 B.P. ? 80 years], [ISGS-3309; 2930 B.P ? 80], [ISGS-3310; 2880 B.P. ? 70 all point to an initial date of ca., 2900 B.P. (Engwall, 1995). Zeidler (1994) concludes that the Late Formative Period Tabuchila Phase also begins at around this time and ends at about 2300 B.P. This estimate is based upon the presence of volcanic tephra overlying Tabuchila Phase occupation layers. In N Manabi, Valdivia VIII and early Late Formative Tabuchila Phase layers are strati graphically separated by a tectonic event (Issacson, 1994; Zeidler, 1994). In SW coastal Ecuador and southern Manabi, Late Formative occupa tions most often directly overlay Machalilla Phase occupation layers (Bischof, 1975,1982; Estrada, 1957,1958,1962a; Evans and Meggers, 1957; Lanning, 1968; Paulsen and McDougle, 1974,1981). However, in coastal El Oro and the Guayas Basin Late Formative Period occupations tend to over lay late Valdivia layers (Gonzalez de Merino, 1984; Reindel and Guillaume Gentil, 1995; Staller, 1994,2000a). In coastal El Oro, Late Formative Period Arenillas Phase occupations are reported and associated with multicomponent sites with Valdivia VII VIII occupations (Staller, 1994, 2000a). At La Florida, Late Formative Arenillas Phase deposits are directly superimposed upon Valdivia VII-VIII Jell Phase and early Machalilla occupations (Staller, 2000a, pp. 250-251). Moreover, stylistic similarities in a number of vessel forms between these var ious components appear to reflect developmental continuity (Staller, 1994). In the Guayas Basin at Penon del Rio, a diverse ceramic assemblage has been reported, including evidence of mound building and domestic habita tions (Muse, 1989; Zedeno, 1985,1987). Despite an extensive Late Formative occupation in this very large site, there is no evidence of Machalilla material culture. Similarly, Evans and Meggers (1957,1982) did not report any evi dence of Machalilla occupation at La Chorrera, and Late Formative occupa tions are directly over a Valdivia VIII occupation at Milagro I (Gonzalez de Merino, 1984). On the basis of this archaeological evidence we may infer that Machalilla style pottery does not appear in this subregion and is marginally represented in areas to the south. The evidence from the eastern portion of the Gulf of Guayaquil and coastal El Oro suggests a direct development from Valdivia VIII to Chorrera.</page><page sequence="48">240 Staller In conclusion, early estimates suggest a chronological range of 3500 2500 B.P. for the Late Formative Period (Meggers, 1966, Fig. 4), while the chronological range for the Engoroy complex is placed at around 2750-2050 B.P. (Paulsen and McDougle, 1981). On the basis of radiocar bon dates Currie (1985, 1992) estimates the end of the Late Formative at around 2250 B.P. in coastal El Oro, and Zeidler (1994) reports a compara ble estimate for Tabuchila Phase occupation in N Manabi. The continuous Formative occupation in coastal El Oro and the Gulf of Guayaquil supports an estimated range of ca. 3400-3250 B.P for the beginning of the Late For mative Period in these regions. Over the rest of coastal Ecuador, specifically in areas of Machalilla related material culture, or in N Manabi where there is a chronological hiatus, the Late Formative appears to begin at ca. 2950 2750 B.P. Some have dismissed the obsidian hydration date from La Chorrera as due to a fault in dating technique (Beckwith, 1996, Table 2.1, pp. 15 18). However, given the apparent absence of Machalilla in the Jama River drainage, and the brief duration of occupation of the complex to the south in El Oro (Staller, 1994, 2000a), it is possible to explain such seeming dis crepancies in the archaeological record in other terms. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Previous analyses of Formative chronologies, ceramic seriations, and settlement patterns suggest the earliest ceramic occupations are coastal and concentrated between the Verde and Valdivia Rivers in SW coastal Ecuador. This subregion represents the nucleus of Valdivia sociocultural development (Fig. 6). Valdivia regional surveys further indicate a decline in settlements related in part to an adaptive shift during the final portion of the Valdivia culture sequence. This change in site locations strongly suggests a greater reliance upon agriculture, and may be related in part to climatic, environ mental, and geomorphologic changes after Phase V times (Staller, 1994). The only Valdivia VI-VIII ceremonial center in SW coastal Ecuador is La Centenela. However, the diagnostics and stratigraphic occupations of this in land site have not been reported in any detail. A seeming absence of Valdivia VIII ceremonial centers in SW coastal Ecuador and S Manabi suggests on going changes in population density reflecting a reduction in the mangrove formation, and changes in the environment and in the subsistence economy (Ferdon, 1981; Staller, 1994). In contrast, major Phase VII-VIII ceremo nial centers are present in coastal El Oro, the western side of the Gulf of Guayaquil, and N Manabi, supporting the hypothesis of fundamental</page><page sequence="49">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 241 changes in the geographic locus of sociopolitical development. Changes in settlement to a more inland riverine pattern, and expansion into N Manabi, the Guayas Basin, and southern coastal El Oro in part also explains why documenting a developmental transition between Valdivia and the subse quent Machalilla culture complex was initially so elusive, because most of the early research was concentrated in SW coastal Ecuador. During Phase VII-VIII there appears to have been a relative decline of previously established long-distance maritime interaction along the coast, and a concomitant intensification and elaboration of long-distance exchange with the northern and southern highlands of Ecuador and northern highlands of Peru (Staller, 1992/93,1994,1996a, 1996b; Villalba, 1988; Zeidler, 1988, 1991). Complicating the issue of a transition were thin layers of Machalilla refuse with almost all late Valdivia occupations south of the Rio Valdivia and north of the Rio Verde (Bischof, 1975; Cliff et al, 1987; Lanning, 1968; Lippi, 1982, 1983; Paulsen and McDougle, 1981; Schwarz and Raymond, 1996; Zeidler, 1977). The archaeological patterning in SW coastal Ecuador had a profound effect upon hypotheses regarding a developmental link be tween the Valdivia and Machalilla Phases. The ceramic evidence presented here indicates substantial regional diversity by late Valdivia VI-VIII times and dramatic technological changes during Phase VII-VIII. Current ceramic data suggest that the cultural history of late Valdivia societies in coastal El Oro, the Gulf of Guayaquil, and N Manabi were developmentally, and to some extent, chronologically distinct from those of SW coastal Ecuador and S Manabi. However, during the final portion (Phases VII-VIII) of the se quence, it is the continuity in stirrup-spouts, carinated vessels, composite forms, and stylistic attributes such as fillet appliqu6, zoned punctation, fine line incision, and excision, as well as the figurines from Chacras, San Lorenzo del Mate, and other sites, that link the Valdivia and Machalilla traditions (Staller, 1994,1996b, 1998, 2000b, 2001). These Formative components can therefore be seen as derived from a single tradition. The regional Late Formative complexes appear to have developed di rectly from a Valdivia VIII base in some regions of the Ecuadorian lowlands and from Machalilla in other subregions (Staller, 1994). Pedestal bowls, ev erted jars, and single spout bottles of the Jelf Phase complex suggest a contin uous tradition associating Valdivia with the Late Formative components in southern coastal El Oro and in the Gulf of Guayaquil (Staller, 1994,2000a, 2001; Weinstein, 1998). On the other hand, the developmental association is with Machalilla in SW coastal Ecuador and S. Manabi. These regional dif ferences beg the question of how Machalilla should be understood in terms of Ecuadorian prehistory both from a historical as well as a cultural stand point. I suggest that Machalilla may be seen as a chronological and cultural</page><page sequence="50">242 Staller extension of Valdivia (see also Lathrap et aL, 1975). In N Manabi and over most of the Guayas Basin, the Valdivia-Machalilla traditions develop di rectly into what may be properly termed a Chorrera style. The transition in these subregions and in areas to the south, as far as the Piura coast in Peru, appears to be much earlier dating to ca. 3400-3250 b.p. although this estimate is not directly based upon dates from Late Formative contexts. Machalilla occupation is most intense and of longest duration in the areas around the Rio Valdivia and further to the north in S Manabi especially in the imme diate vicinity of the coastal village of Machalilla (Estrada, 1958; Evans and Meggers, 1958; Meggers et ah, 1965). It is in precisely these areas that the Late Formative regional phases begin to appear at about ca. 2950-1700 b.p. Similar early dates for the Late Formative Period appear to characterize N Manabi, but here the reasons are not so much developmental as they are environmental and geological. With regards to Valdivia, the regional chronological patterns suggest a spread into N and S Manabi Province but this radiation must be understood in terms of factors related to the decline of mangrove and geomorphologic change in the coastal areas of SW Ecuador and S Manabi. The areas of most intense Machalilla occupation coincide with those portions of the coast in which tectonic uplift has occurred, but where mangrove formations per sist along the coastal lowlands, and where aquatic and maritime resources are most accessible. The adaptive pattern of coastal populations appears to have been focused upon maritime resources and small-scale farming and this pattern is essentially a continuation of the earlier Valdivia VII-VIII adaptation. Future investigations should more closely analyze the development and integration of ceramic innovation in other regions of the Ecuadorian low lands as being derived from the Valdivia-Machalilla tradition as Lathrap and others (1975) had suggested. Such phasing will then encompass the greater portion of the Ecuadorian lowlands (south of Esmeraldas Province) more precisely, since all but the Tabuchila Phase appear to be directly derived from this ceramic tradition. The extent to which Tabuchila is derived from Piquigua Phase Valdivia VIII components is at this time problematic given the hiatus in occupation in this region. If the Tabuchila Phase is not derived from a local Early Formative Period tradition, we must consider the pos sibility that it may have originated in this region from the spread of Late Formative Period agricultural societies from the eastern side of the coastal hills and ultimately from the Guayas Basin. Since regional variation in the Late Formative ceramic complexes is only now beginning to be understood, such developmental connections need further consideration as more system atic research is undertaken.</page><page sequence="51">The Formative of Coastal Ecuador 243 Although the role of the Valdivia ceramic tradition has generally been overlooked by scholars who focused upon the later periods, the impor tance of other aspects of the ritual complex which included Spondylus and Strombus shell, psychotropic (San Pedro Cactus) and narcotic plants (coca, Datura spp.), feline and avian symbolism, ritual consumables (red pepper, maize, and salt), and various ceramic bottles is apparent (Staller, 1994, Tables 9 and 10). It was initially assumed that Valdivia ceramics played a ma jor role in the development of ceramic innovation outside of the Ecuadorian lowlands. As more research on the final portion of the Valdivia sequence be comes available, it will be increasingly apparent that the Valdivia-Machalilla ceramic tradition was central to the development of ceramic innovations and incipient complexity in other regions of western South America. In conclusion, the synthesis of Formative Ecuador presented here sug gests the following: (1) A regional divergence in Valdivia material culture during Phases VII-VIII directly supports the premise of a ceramic transition linking Valdivia to the subsequent Machalilla Phase and demonstrates these complexes are part of the same ceramic tradition. It is now apparent that the Valdivia-Machalilla transition is characterized by a proliferation of distinct vessel forms and stylistic attributes, as well as changes in the pottery technol ogy. (2) A major adaptive shift occurred during Phase VI-VIII times. The changes in subsistence are related to an increased dependence upon agricul ture by inland Valdivia populations. During this adaptive shift there is a con comitant reduction in hunting and gathering of wild plants and animals and an increased dependence upon estuarine and maritime resources by coastal populations. (3) In association with changes in the subsistence adaptation is a reduction of Valdivia settlements in SW coastal Ecuador between the Rio Verde and Valdivia, related in part to geomorphologic changes and a re duction or possible extinction of the mangrove forest around Phase V times. Changes in the distributions and densities of Valdivia settlement correspond to chronological and regional differences in the locus of sociocultural devel opment. (4) There is a developmental link between the Valdivia-Machalilla ceramic tradition and the Late Formative Period sequences in far north Peru, coastal El Oro, the Gulf of Guayaquil as well as the northern and southern highlands of Ecuador. (5) These developmental associations are related to the establishment of long-distance interaction with the Andean highlands and later the ceja de montana of eastern Ecuador. A central feature of this interaction was the spread of a ritual and religious cult expressed archaeo logically by Chorrera related material culture over a vast geographic area. The ritual complex associated with the spread of this cult also involved a cos mology associated with the Strombus galeatus and Spondylus princeps dyad, and included various consumable and sumptuary plants and resources. The</page><page sequence="52">244 Staller sudden appearance of finely crafted polished zoomorphic stone mortars con taining feline and avian symbolism indicates that some of these plants were associated with Andean ritual ceremony. Similarly, the ideology and cos mology of this early cult is also symbolically expressed in the finely crafted zoomorphic and anthropomorphic ceramic bottles and serving vessels. The early spread of ceramic innovation associated with Valdivia VII-VIII and Chorrera related material culture is evident archaeologically by the inte gration of composite forms such as constricted jars, elaborately decorated open bowls with vertical walls, and ceramic bottles (especially stirrup spout and single spout forms) and elaborate mold made effigy vessels over a large geographic area (Fig. 13). It is suggested that the ideology associated with this ritual complex formed the basis of Andean cosmology over a vast area of western South America in subsequent periods where it was symbolically La Emerenciana (OOSrSr-42) Fig. 13.
