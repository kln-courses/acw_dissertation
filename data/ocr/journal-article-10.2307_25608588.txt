Prior to the present study, one was published as a human figurine (Coqueugniot 2000: 70). Similar objects, dated to the Khiamian and Pre-Pottery Neolithic A periods (10,000-8700 cal. b.c), have been recognized at Tell Mureybet in the same region. Analysis of 22 specimens from Dja'de elMughara reveals morphological variability and different styles of shaping within the sample. Anthropomorphic figurines in the prehistoric Near East have been approached as a dis tinct group of representations, often considered in terms of symbolism. Rarely are the raw materials (mainly clay and stone), technology of manufacture, and variations in fashion considered. Here, the major steps of figurine manufacture from whole proximal phalanges of equids atDja'de elMughara are described and a classification system based on technolog ical and morphological criteria is proposed. It is hoped that this presentation of the Djayde el Mughara bone figurine sample will stimulate recognition of analogous finds at other pre historic sites in the Near East. Introduction In 1997, the discovery of a carved, whole, proximal (or first) phalanx of an equid at Tell Dja'de el Mughara in the Middle Euphrates Valley, Syria (fig. i) provided evidence for the working of phalanges into human figurines during the Early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) period (Co queugniot 2000: 70; Gourichon 2004: 314). Between 1998 and 2007, an additional 24 specimens were recov ered from various levels of the site, ranging in date from the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) to the end of the Early PPNB (ca. 9300-8200 cal. b.c). Similar ob jects have been recognized at Tell Mureybet, about 100 km south of Dja'de el Mughara (fig. i), dated to the Khiami an period and the PPNA, between 10,000 and 8700 cal. b.c. (Gourichon 2004: 222). Outside the Euphrates Val ley, close parallels dating to the Early Chalcolithic, span ning the first half of the 6th millennium cal. b.c, have been found at Tepecik-Qiftlik in central Anatolia (fig. i) (Bicakci 2001: 28). Worked first phalanges of equids are also known from other regions and cultural periods. For example, ornately incised specimens have been identified in Epigravettian contexts in Romania (Otte and Beldiman 1995; Otte, Chirica, and Beldiman 1995) and in Ene olithic contexts in Kazakhstan. No definite function has been assigned to the Palaeolithic specimens. The Eneolith ic examples have, in the past, been variously considered to be female figurines or gaming pieces; Sandra Olsen identi fies them on the website describing her research in Kaza khstan (accessed 5 July 2009) as female figurines.

Most of these ar tifacts and their imitations in stone, clay, and ivory occur in burials. Flattening of the proximal phalanges of horses ob served in Hungarian Bronze Age specimens, typically along the medial and lateral sides following the mode ob served on the talus and the first phalanges of red deer, sheep, goat, and pig (Choyke 2005: 137), provides anoth er example of the shaping of the first phalanges of equids. Contextual data strongly suggest the use of the bones with flattened sides in rituals (Choyke 2005: 137). In the Near East, Pre-Pottery Neolithic shaped pha langes of equids are not associated with funerary contexts or with ritual objects and deposits. In contrast to the elab orately worked and highly decorated specimens from Eu rope and Kazakhstan, the Near Eastern examples are rela tively simple creations. Some preserve deliberate indica tions of sex and other human anatomical features that in vite comparison with the stylized stone and clay represen tations of the lower part of the human body, with or with out secondary sexual characteristics, and standing upright or seated, which characterize those in the Khiamian and PPNA (Kuijt and Chesson 2004: 157, table 8.1, fig. 8.2, 2007: 214, figs. 16.2,16.3; Rollefson 2008: 390-394; see also Cauvin 2000: 25-26, 36, figs. 6, 7.1, 8.3-8.4, 13). These indicators of human features, the choice of a bone with an anthropomorphic aspect (e.g., Dive and Eisen mann 1991: 284, 286), which is emphasized by its sym metry, and the use of certain conventions common in the modeling of the human form in clay and stone, place the Pre-Pottery Neolithic shaped phalanges on the list of rep resentational figurines of this period. The Pre-Pottery Neolithic shaped phalanges differ from Epipaleolithic and Pre-Pottery Neolithic zoomorphic rep resentations, which include heads of animals carved on bone tool handles and on stone rods, and stone and clay figurines depicting the bodies or body parts, such as the lower limbs, of various mammals, birds, and reptiles (Cau vin 2000: 17, fig. 3; Coqueugniot 2003; Rollefson 2008: 388-399). In these figurines, quadrupeds and birds are de picted as recumbent or as standing on parallel legs. Exam ples are also preserved on stone of engraved and relief de pictions of parts or all of the animal body (Coqueugniot 2003: 42; Rollefson 2008: 390-394). Humans and ani mals are occasionally represented on a single object, and there are numerous examples of unidentified figures (Kui jt and Chesson 2004: 157,161, table 8.1,2007: 214-216; Rollefson 2008: 388-403). The categorization of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic worked equid phalanges as anthropomorphic figurines separates human from zoomorphic figurines. As discussed below,</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 34, 2009 321 the indecisive contextual associations might not support this distinction. At present, there are no archaeological data that allow us to tackle this question. On the other hand, if one is concerned with human representation as a practice (cf. Rosemary Joyce in Lesure 2002: 603), a clos er look at the production and appearance of figurines is useful. Imagery in the early Neolithic sites of the Near East was diverse and prolific (e.g., Cauvin 2000; Hauptmann 1999; Helmer, Gourichon, and Stordeur 2004; Horwitz and Goring-Morris 2004; Peters and Schmidt 2004; Rollefson 2008; Verhoeven 2002). Human representations in gener al, and anthropomorphic figurines in particular, have at tracted attention because they have been interpreted as a behavioral corollary of long-term ideological and econom ic transformations at the dawn of the Neolithic (Cauvin 2000). Discussion of the figurines has frequendy been fo cused on gender depiction, human/animal associations, symbolism, and their ritualistic use (e.g., Cauvin 2000; Kuijt 2008; Kuijt and Chesson 2004,2007; Morsch 2002; Rollefson 2008; Schmandt-Besserat 1997; Verhoeven 2002). At present, the production of these objects, usually in clay and stone (Rollefson 2008), is not documented ad equately for the region (cf. McAdam 1997; Schmandt Besserat 1997). The anthropomorphic figurines made from proximal phalanges of equids constitute a novel ele ment for research. This paper presents the first analysis of 22 specimens from Dja'de el Mughara, dated to the Early PPNB, focusing on the techniques of manufacture and the forms produced. Criteria for recognition of these figurines are defined in discussion. The Site The prehistoric tell of Dja'de el Mughara, 5 m high and 1.5 ha in area, is located 100 km ne of Aleppo, on the west ern bank of the Euphrates River. Over 9 m of well-strati fied deposits of a settlement dating from the end of the PPNA through the end of the Early PPNB were explored during 10 excavation seasons between 1991 and 2003. These deposits, dated by a series of 30 radiocarbon dates to ca. 9300-8200 cal. b.c, were direcdy overlaid by suc cessive layers of Pre-Halaf habitation, which is dated to the end of the 7th and the beginning of the 6th millennia b.c., based on the ceramic finds. The site was reused as a necrop olis in the later Early Bronze Age, after which it appears to have been abandoned. The excavations at Dja'de el Mughara were undertaken within the framework of an international salvage project in the Tishrin Dam area. Work continues at this site, which escaped inundation, and is concentrated on the earliest oc cupation levels. At present, Dja'de el Mughara contains the only com plete stratigraphy for the 9th millennium cal. b.c. in the Euphrates Valley, providing an opportunity for research into Early PPNB economy and society from 8700 to 8200 cal. b.c. This poorly defined period (Edwards et al. 2004; Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 1997; Kuijt 2003) is cru cial for the understanding of the transition from a hunter gatherer economy to the adoption of agriculture and ani mal husbandry in the northern Levant. Pre-Pottery Ne olithic finds from Dja'de el Mughara include extensive col lections of animal bones and tools; a variety of ornaments and figurines made from stone, gypsum, chalk, clay, and bone; evidence for feasting; and human burials (fig. 2a), as well as architectural remains including an 11,000-year old communal circular building with wall paintings (fig. 2b), the earliest now known in the Near East. The Figurines The specimens described here were made from whole phalanges, and were freestanding objects. The proximal epiphysis (or base) of the phalanx, presenting two sym metrical articular cavities separated by a sagittal groove (fig. 3), provides a broad base that assures the stability of the object when standing upright. The distal epiphysis (or head) of the phalanx, which consists of two condyles sepa rated by a sagittal groove, and the shaft (or body) of the bone, whose concave sides slightiy narrow toward the head, resemble the head and body, respectively, of a human figure. The raw material for the figurines was probably ac quired from animals brought to the site. The faunal re mains from Dja'de el Mughara show that equids, together with gazelles, were the most frequendy hunted animals, and that the processing of carcasses took place at the site (Gourichon 2004: 317, 332). Apart from the traces of tooling to shape the phalanges, toolmarks observed on the proximal phalanges of equids of Dja'de el Mughara include transverse cut-marks on or near the extremities and on the shafts that indicate disarticulation and skinning. The biometrical study of the faunal bone from the site is in progress, and the location of the member?anterior or posterior?and the equid species used for the figurines are not yet defined. Anteroposterior and interspecific differ ences are difficult to assess on Equus bones from Near East ern Neolithic sites due to the low degree of variation in morphology and size among the species recognized: E. hernionus, E. africanus, and probably E. hydruntinus (Gouri chon and Helmer 2008). Fragmentary and worked speci mens are even more difficult to differentiate. For the mo ment, our identifications of the worked phalanges are lim ited to age class. Our sample includes four phalanges</page><page sequence="4">322 Neolithic Figurines Manufactured from Phalanges of Equids, Syria/Christidou et al. mmmm^mmmmmmmmmmlmmmm^mmm^mmm^mmm^mmmmmmmmmmmw** ^jfiflHHmHH A B Figure 2.

Fortunately, the only severe surface damage among the specimens was confined to the anterior side and the base, respectively, of two specimens (R108 and R121), which elsewhere preserved manufacturing traces. Study of the specimens was facilitated by the low degree of fragmenta tion of the sample. Specimens R105, R108, Rill, and R118 are almost complete.

Flakes were detached from the margins of the proximal and distal extremities of R108 and R118, respectively. The sample includes two distal (R115 and R117) fragments and one proximal (R121) fragment. R115 and R121 pre serve the epiphysis and a portion of the body on which modifications by shaping could be analyzed. Finally, spec imen R120 was identified in two non-joining fragments that preserved the epiphyseal surfaces. Except in two cases (R105 and R108), the breaks are recent. Damage on R105 and RIO8 may have occurred postdepositionally. Each object was examined at low magnifications (10 60 x) with a stereoscopic microscope. These magnifica tions permitted us to recognize prominent traces of manu facture as well as use wear. The localization and extent of these modifications were recorded. Identifications were based on experimental data (Campana 1987, 1989; Chris tidou 1999; D'Errico, Giacobini, and Puech 1982-1983; Newcomer 1974; Stordeur 1980, 1988). The analytical data collected show that scraping and grooving were employed in order to shape the figurines. The same techniques were also used to produce and curate the majority of the bone tools of Dja'de el Mughara. As a rule, the shaft of the phalanx was thoroughly scraped in a direction oblique to or along its long axis (figs. 4A-b). Chatter-marks occur frequendy (fig. 4a). In several cases, intersecting and well-marked striations of varying widths and depths, sometimes curved, cover the surface (fig. 4b)</page><page sequence="6">324 Neolithic Figurines Manufactured from Phalanges of Equids, Syria/Christidou et al A B C D Figure 4.

Scale: 1 cm. suggesting the incising of multiple deep strokes and the use of the irregular edge of a stone tool. Sometimes the bor ders of the epiphyses were scraped perpendicular to the long axis of the bone in an attempt to smooth them or to remove soft tissue. On one phalanx (R118), transverse scraping was employed to fashion specific traits (see below, "Category 3"). Such traits were also shaped by longitudi nal and transverse grooving (fig. 4c). For this technique, the cutting edge of a stone tool was used in a sawing mo tion. In one instance (R112), grinding was performed in combination with scraping. The shaft of the phalanx was first scraped longitudinally, and then was rubbed oblique ly and perpendicularly to its long axis against the grinding stone, resulting in the formation of macroscopically visible, spindle-shaped, superimposed striations (fig. 4d). Except on a few phalanges (R103, R105, and R109), the shaping marks appear more or less dulled by use-polish (fig. sa). Based on the extent and type of modification of the bone by shaping, three major categories of figurines were defined within the sample.

The naturally rough surface is worn and smoothed. Scale: 1 cm. studied, Category 1 contains four; Category 2, 12; and Category 3, five items (table i). The distal fragment Rl 17 (see above) was not classified. Category 1 This category includes minimally modified phalanges (R101, R102, R104, and R105). Shaping consists of scraping longitudinally the anterior (or dorsal) surface of the bone (fig. 5). On one specimen (R105), the medial and lateral borders of the phalanx were also thoroughly scraped; on another (R104), only light scraping was ap plied to the anterior side. The surfaces of specimens R101, R102, and R104 macroscopically appear polished and smoothed, probably through use wear (fig. 5A). Dorsal (anterior) scraping may be related to removal of muscle attachments and smoothing of the surface. The ab sence of scraping marks on the other parts of the phalanx suggests that the bones chosen were practically free of soft tissue. After skinning, brief burial and exposure of the pha langes to worm activity, for example, could have provided the craftsmen with raw material requiring little modifica tion prior to use.</page><page sequence="8">326 Neolithic Figurines Manufactured from Phalanges of Equids, Syria/Christidou et al. r i ml / r R114 liJAii LSD B R116 Figure 6.

The smaller arrows indicate v-shaped traits on specimens R114 and R116. Category 2 The Category 2 specimens had been further modified. Scraping was applied all over the shaft of the phalanx. With one exception (R103), the rough area of the trigonumpha langis (fig. 3) and bovmding ridges on the posterior (or palmar/plantar) surface of the bone were completely re moved by scraping; on six phalanges (R107, R108, R109, R113, R114, and R115), this aspect was thoroughly worked and flattened (figs. 6a, 7A-b); on five specimens (R106, R110, Rill, R112, and R116), a convexity was fashioned below the head of the phalanx (figs. 6b, 7c). On the phalanges with flattened posterior surface, scraping extends over the two distal condyles on that same side. With one exception, this modification was not ob served on the phalanges with a posterior convexity. The shaping of three phalanges included more actions. On phalanx R113, flattened on the posterior side, the base was scraped and considerably reduced (fig. 6, upper right, and figs. 8a-c); the cancellous bone was uncovered and smoothed during the work. On phalanx R114, after the posterior surface was flattened, two longitudinal grooves were cut on the same side, above the proximal sagittal groove (fig. 6, center right, and fig. 8d), by means of the cutting edge of a stone tool used in a sawing motion. On the same side, in the middle of the proximal sagittal groove, a short v-shaped trait was cut using the same tech nique. On phalanx R116, which had been modified to pre sent a posterior convexity, the distal end was beveled from the dorsal (anterior) side (fig. 6, lower right, and figs. 8e-f). The technique that was employed to shape the bev el, which is convex from side to side, cannot be identified,</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 34, 2009 327 A B C - Figure 7. Category 2. A-B) Specimen R107; C) Specimen R110. Scale: 1 cm. since the beveled surface was carefully finished by scraping. On this surface, the scraping marks have a medio-lateral orientation. A v-shaped mark, similar to that on phalanx R114, was incised on the posterior edge of the proximal sagittal groove. Category 3 The main characteristics of the phalanges of Category 3 (R118, R119, R120, R121, and R122) are that they were intensively scraped and the "waist55 of the shaft was accen tuated (fig. 9a). The cortical bone was considerably thinned. In one case (R118), the bone wall had been so thinned that a flake was removed (fig. ioa). Three variants were defined on the basis of the fashioned features. variant 3.1 On three specimens (R118, R119, and R120), a bevel was shaped on the anterior side at the distal end (figs. 9B-c, 10) and the base was also worked. The beveled sur face, after being cut flat, was thoroughly scraped. Scraping marks and subsequent use-polish masked the traces of the technique used to form the bevel. With respect to the shap ing of the base, on phalanx R118 the sagittal groove was scraped more widely and deeply from the posterior side, and the left and right extremities of the base were shaped into rounded points resembling feet (figs. 9b, ioa). On the dorsal (anterior) side, the convex edge of the base was scraped perpendicular to the bone's long axis, from the center of the edge toward the medial and lateral borders of the phalanx, and a shallow inverse v-shaped cut was formed at the midpoint (fig. ioc). This part of the figurine re sembles the rear aspect of the human pelvis. The base of phalanx R120 was shaped in the same way on its posterior side (fig. 9c); the dorsal (anterior) aspect was scraped perpendicular to the long axis of the bone, but no v-shaped trait was made. Only traces reminiscent of the enlargement of the sagittal groove can be observed on the posterior side of phalanx R119. The proximal epiphysis, unfused, became detached after the object was discarded; it was not recovered during the excavation. variant 3.2 In contrast to other Category 3 specimens, phalanx R121 presents a posterior convexity that was accentuated during the scraping of the shaft. Phalanx R121 is fragmen tary and lacks the head (figs, iia-b). Moreover, its base is damaged and modification similar to that seen on pha langes R118 and R120 (Variant 3.1) cannot be assessed. This posterior convexity, recognized only on phalanx R121, resembles a swollen belly. variant 3.3 This variant is also represented by a single phalanx, R122 (figs, iic-e) (see also Coqueugniot 2000: 70). This phalanx resembles some figurines in Category 2 in that it is not shaped on the base and the head, and displays a con vexity scraped on the posterior side (figs, iic-d). This working extends over the distal condyles on the posterior side, where the cancellous bone was exposed and scraped (fig. iid). The cancellous bone was also scraped on the an terior side of the bone (fig. he). On the posterior con vexity, specific traits were fashioned. First, a deep longitu dinal groove was sawn all along the length of the convex part of the surface by use of the edge of a stone tool.

Scale: 1 cm. an equally deep transverse groove was cut, in the same way, immediately below the convexity (fig. iid). Discussion The low degree of modification of Category 1 objects distinguishes them from those in the other two categories, in which traces of working are macroscopically more ap parent and more detailed. Specific actions and conventions were employed to render details on Category 2 and 3 spec imens. In the specimens of Category 3, effort was invested in shaping slender forms out of the stout phalanx. The recurrent use of specific actions and conventions observed in specimens of Categories 2 and 3 include the following: the beveling of the anterior side of the distal epi physis of the phalanx; the cutting of a v-shaped trait on the posterior edge of the sagittal groove of the proximal end (base) of the phalanx; the enlargement and deepening of this groove by scraping on the posterior side and the shap ing of feet on the same side; and the flattening of the pos terior surface of the shaft of the phalanx or the forming of a convexity on it. The beveling of the distal extremity (head) of the bone is observed on Category 2 and 3 specimens, but is a pri mary feature of Variant 3.1. The posterior convexity takes the shape of a round, swollen belly only on the thinned body of phalanx R121 (Variant 3.2).

Neither of these two phalanges bears any specific traits in the epiphyseal areas. The most-worked pieces exhibit an evident desire to dis play features of the lower part of the human, probably fe male, body, particularly the stomach, pelvis, and feet</page><page sequence="12">330 Neolithic Figurines Manufactured from Phalanges of Equids, Syria/Christidou et al.

The upper part of the human body was indicat ed by the beveling of the distal end of the phalanx and, in one case (R122, Variant 3.3), by the grooving of the pos terior convexity to represent the torso, probably also that of a woman. As yet, there is no evidence for chronological differenti ation among the three categories of figurines. Differences in figurine shaping are not related to particular contexts of the site. The figurines have not been found in groups, but were recovered as isolated finds from midden and fill de posits. Detailed study of the variations among these de posits and their contents is pending, and data are at present inadequate to define patterns of use and discard of the ob jects on the basis of their spatial contexts (cf, Voigt 2000; see also Hodder 1987; Moore 1996). Morphological and technological data provide the basis for the present discussion. The rendering of selected attributes of the human body by use of specific actions and conventions is recognizable on figurines dated prior to the PPNB. In the region of Dja'de el Mughara and adjacent areas, human features were rendered on stone and clay figurines as early as the the Khi amian and the PPNA. A v-shaped trait such as that cut on the edge of the proximal sagittal groove of some phalanges studied here has been interpreted to indicate sex on Khi amian figurines made from limestone at Tell Mureybet and, more distandy, in the Jordan Valley (Cauvin 2000: 25, figs. 6.4-6.5).

Such grooving was also used on an Early PPNB figurine carved out of a bone fragment at Dja'de el Mughara. This specimen, which is unpublished, has not been analyzed. The base of a PPNA stone figurine from Tell Mureybet (Cauvin 2000: 25, fig. 7.1) resembles a smoothed proxi mal epiphysis of the first phalanx of equids studied here. Feet in the form of divergent straight points with rounded ends, as are seen on the Variant 3.1 figurines from Dja'de el Mughara, appear on clay specimens from Tell Mureybet that are dated to the PPNA (Cauvin 2000: 25, fig. 8.). The striking resemblance of the shape and features of two PPNA figurines in clay, one from Mureybet (Cauvin 2000: fig. 8.3), the other from Netiv Hagdud (Cauvin 2000: 36, fig. 13) in the southern Levant, to the shaped first pha langes of equids from Dja'de el Mughara points to a per vasive figurative style. The emphasis on certain anatomical features on the most elaborately worked phalanges from Dja'de el Mughara should not minimize the importance of less de tailed representations, such as Category 1 specimens (R101, R102, R104, and R105) and Category 2 pieces that lack specific traits and posterior convexities (R103, R107, R108), which, taken together, constitute seven out of the 19 specimens sufficiently preserved to allow recog nition of specific attributes. The fragmentary nature of phalanges R115 and R117 and the detachment of the un fused base of R109 do not allow such an assessment (table 2). This prevalence of less-worked specimens might attest to the recognition of the proximal phalanx of equids as a reliable human representation, suggesting the possibil ity that unworked phalanges were also used as figurines. Since the classification of an unworked bone as an artifact is dependent on the presence of use marks, we examined the unworked proximal phalanges for use wear. Currendy, the relation between the different species of Equus or parts of their bodies, on the one hand, and hu mans, on the other, during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic would be a matter of speculation. Among the abundant an imal representations (e.g., Helmer, Gourichon, and Stordeur 2004; Peters and Schmidt 2004; Rollefson 2008), equids appear rarely, if at all. Reliance on equids for subsistence in varying degrees and long acquaintance with these animals, as observed at Dja'de el Mughara as well as at Epipaleolithic and Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites in the vicinity (Gourichon 2004; Gourichon and Helmer 2008; Helmer, Gourichon, and Stordeur 2004; Legge and Row ley-Conwy 2000; Sana Segui 1999), might have shaped particular concepts regarding the meaning of their bones, as observed in hunting and pastoral societies (e.g., Birtalan 2003). Substantial additional zooarcheological and tapho nomic data, including evidence for hunting practices, butchery, carcass-processing, and bone discard, will aid in vestigation of these symbolic connotations. For now, the proximal phalanges of equids can be recognized as a suit able and reasonable medium for the representation of humans. The figurine-makers5 decisions to vary the silhouettes they created and to shape specific traits on some figures raises further questions (cf. Joyce 1993). The worked spec imens do not stress the same bodily characteristics, such as body shape, sex, or even pregnancy and age. For example, R121, which presents a swollen belly, may be that of a pregnant female; the slender forms of Variant 3.1 and the stout ones of Categories 1 and 2 may indicate differences in stature and age; and the presence or absence of posted</page><page sequence="14">332 Neolithic Figurines made from Equid Phalanges, Syria/Christidou, Coqueugniot, and Gourichon or convexities on figurines in Category 2 may indicate two different states of the human body. Such differences are suggestive of physical and/or social condition. As noted above, the available stratigraphic data do not document chronological or contextual differentiation between the most detailed and realistic and the most abstract represen tations. Shaped phalanges of all categories are present throughout the stratigraphy of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic at Dja'de el Mughara. Furthermore, the variability observed between and within the categories examined does not sug gest preferential use of the proximal phalanx for a single type of representation. Table 2 shows that various features could be omitted or combined for a given object. Although some of the features fashioned on the speci mens indicate sex, the differences among the objects can not be described in terms of sexed/unsexed and male/fe male dichotomies. Human figurines, including those dis playing female characteristics, for example the vulva, the swollen stomach, and the torso, need not be the expression of the same concept (e.g, Hamilton 1996: 284-285; Ucko 1996). Overall, the diversity in the degree of fashioning and in the features shaped on or omitted from the pha langes studied here suggests that one of the aims of the production was to express physical differentiation. The preference for depiction of feminine sexual characteristics on some phalanges, a choice also observed on PPNA fig urines made from other raw materials (Kuijt and Chesson 2004: 161, 2007: 224; Rollefson 2008: 394), does not necessarily mean that all figurines represent females, how ever. One should also not assume that the aim of the man ufacturers of the figurines was to differentiate sexes. The most striking feature of the Dja'de el Mughara bone fig urines is the morphological variation in the rendering of the human body. One wonders whether the various repre sentations played a role in some kind of performance, ritu alistic or other. Since ancestry seems to have played a role in the construction of memory and identity in the Ne olithic Near East (Kuijt 2008; Peltenburg 2003; Verho even 2002), variations in representation may indicate dif ferent ancestors. Whatever differentiating principles guid ed the shaping and use of these objects, the analysis of the objects has showed that the same raw material and a few simple common techniques were employed, and it seems that the efforts of the figurine-makers were focused on the forms represented. The use of technical actions and con ventions appears to have been rather flexible. Although precise contextual data are lacking, the state of the preservation of the specimens affords some hypotheses about the use of the objects. Unlike figurines made from other raw materials and deliberately destroyed (Rollefson 2008: 410; Verhoeven 2002: 237, 251), the ones made from proximal phalanges of equids seem to have suffered little if any damage before deposition. This circumstance might be related to the actual uses these artifacts served. The representation of a specific form, gender, age class, physical condition, or appearance could only have been useful for a certain period of time; after that, when its meaning was lost, the object could be discarded or aban doned (McAdam 1997: 136; Rollefson 2008: 410). Moreover, the similarity among figures, particularly among the simplest and more frequent forms, could have been provisional or transitory. Finally, whether the fig urines were used in performances or were merely dis played, the end of their use-life did not involve deliberate destruction or burial in special contexts (McAdam 1997: 136; Rollefson 2008: 406; Schmandt-Besserat 1997: 54); hence their state of preservation suggests loss of meaning and utility (Lucas 2008: 62-65). These hypotheses present only some of the possibilities regarding the disposal of these figurines. Systematic study of the deposits in which the figurines were recovered, combined with a thorough study of the degree of use of the objects through high power microwear analysis, may help to further refine the observed pattern. The identification of figurines on proximal phalanges of equids at Dja'de el Mughara raises the issue of their scarci ty on early Neolithic sites in the Euphrates Valley. We have noted that similar artifacts are known only from Tell Mureybet. It is perhaps unwise, in light of the small sam ple, to speculate further. It must be noted, however, that the PPNA levels excavated at the site of Jerf el Ahmar, 30 km south of Dja'de el Mughara (fig. i), provide no evi dence for utilization of first phalanges of equids as artifacts (Lionel Gourichon and Daniel Helmer, personal commu nication 2008). The rarity of finds might be due to practi cal factors, such as lack of exploration of middens and fills where the figurines from proximal phalanges of equids seem to occur. One may wonder, also, if the scarcity of finds is due in part to insufficient knowledge of the modi fication of the bone during manufacture and use, particu larly in the case of moderately and minimally worked spec imens. Slight modifications of bones are often difficult to recognize (Lyman 1994: 339-343), especially during ex cavation (Choyke 2005: 133; Christidou 1999). On the other hand, influences on bone preservation (e.g., weath ering, formation of crusts on the surface, and fragmenta tion) can hamper recognition of bone artifacts, even though first phalanges of equids resist fragmentation. Conclusion In our discussion, we have looked at the possibilities of fered by a single group of figurines for exploring technical</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Field Archaeology [Vol. 34, 2009 333 and symbolic decisions of die Pre-Pottery Neolithic inhab itants of Dja'de el Mughara. The analysis showed that the choice of the same bone and the employment of a few sim ple techniques and symbolic markings functioned to high light different aspects of the human body and perhaps dif ferent moments of life in general or for a specific individ ual (Bailey 1996). Here, these decisions have been tenta tively related to the use-life of the figurines. More detailed analysis of the technological, morphological, and tapho nomic aspects of the figurines will contribute to a better knowledge of the rationales behind their use and produc tion. It is suggested that more specific interpretations re garding the possible role of representation in the construc tion and assessment of identities in the early phases of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic can be sought within the social and economic settings of Dja'de el Mughara through compar isons with other finds, such as human burials and figurines made from other raw materials. The recognition of figurines made from first phalanges of equids adds to the documentation of diversity in Pre Pottery Neolithic figurine production, which reached a peak during the Middle PPNB (Rollefson 2008: 405). Concurrent changes in this production and in its socio economic settings recommend a social approach to the study of the figurines (Lesure 2002). The figurines presented here illustrate increased use of imagery in the settlements of this period, which were the centers for multi-level and gradual transformations of the economy and of the society (e.g. Cauvin 2000; Helmer, Gourichon, and Stordeur 2004; Rollefson 2008). Social roles were constandy redefined, distinctions between indi viduals and statuses drawn, and symbols explicated and challenged. Simple means of representation, such as those presented here, could have helped to reiterate or transform distinctions and ideas at the local or domestic level, or within a still wider context. Use of common techniques and symbolic conventions promoted the figurines, made from proximal phalanges of equids, as an effective means of expression.
