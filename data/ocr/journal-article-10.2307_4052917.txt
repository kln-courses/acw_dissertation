ISBN 0-521-77198-6. With the help of superb historical detail, John King shows us a Paradise Lost teeming with "corrosively bitter and astringent wit" (p. 2). The target of Milton's satire is Catholicism and what King designates the "formalism" of Laud and his Restoration descendants. Through a study of broadsheets and title pages, King recovers Milton's deep engagement in his poetry with the "controversial merriment" of contemporary, popular polemic. "Controversial merriment," the title of the first chapter, is Samuel Johnson's phrase, reflecting his disapproval of the rough humor in Milton's prose. King demonstrates that the satire often noticed in Milton's religious polemics is equally present, though largely unremarked, in Paradise Lost. This valuable addition to Milton criticism, however, must overcome Johnson and his neo-classical predecessor in reception, Addison, who turn away from the poem's coarse wit in the name of decorum. The most helpful guide in this project turns out to be Patrick Hume, who, writing prior to Addison in 1695, is one of Milton's earliest commentators, and therefore nearest to the world of polemic and broadsheet which informs King's readings. Indeed, it is only from within a nuanced picture of seventeenth-century religious contro- versy that the full extent of Milton's satire becomes visible. King reproduces a broad array of illustrations, many for the first time, and transcribes several in an appendix. Such popular anti-Catholic and anti-formalist productions connect Milton to Spenser, via Phineas Fletcher, by the common thread of militant Protestant politics. So King reads Lycidas alongside Spenser's May Eclogue by teasing out the various uses of hungry wolves in anti-clerical polemic. (He also points out that a Latin translation of the Shepheardes Calendar substitutes the name "Lycidas" for "Piers.") And so King reinvigorates Milton's well-known allusion to Spenser's Errour by showing how both Errour and Sin make use of the grotesque, raped mother to parody Catholicism. This historical perspective pays its best dividends in a reading of the Paradise of Fools (or Limbo of Vanity, in Paradise Lost, Book Three). Beyond the</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 653 explicit satire-"relics, beads,/ Indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls" (3.491-92) blow through this middle realm of vain ideas-there is revealed a network of anti-Catholic witticisms surrounding Milton's use of such loaded words as "trumpery," "wicket, " and "hypocrisy." In broadsheet and in Paradise Lost the humor quickly becomes scatological, and King unearths a surprisingly large sample of such carnivalesque language-notably in the descriptions of the apostate' s gunpowder and in "their engines and their balls/ Of missive ruin" (6.518-19). An extended consideration of Milton's coarse humor leads naturally to the persistent problem of God's laughter-and King's rich historical foundation amply refutes Empson's claim that such laughter negates theodicy, showing instead that "the anthropomorphic trope of divine mirth functions as a gratingly harsh element of contempo- rary religious controversy" (p. 113). King has occasion to refer to Bakhtin, but his approach to satire is generally free from theory. With regard to Paradise Lost, his argument makes "no claim to evaluate Milton's poem in its totality" (p. 22). By resisting the temptation to construct larger interpretive patterns, this study protects its history: it does not arrange facts to meet ideas. King's history instead sheds genuinely new light on an impressive gathering of individual passages. Nevertheless, the reader may feel some disappointment at this safe approach. King, in fact, does move from Book One to Book Twelve of Paradise Lost, and could have chosen to reflect further on how Milton's controversial merriment plays out over the course of the poem-or on why it has so little place in Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes. Similarly, he might have placed the religious controversy in a broader historical perspec- tive-his claim that Milton's earliest readers better got Milton'sjokes suggests, for example, that deism, with its corrosive wit aimed at religious formalism, may also matter. Surprisingly, Alexander Pope receives little mention. Still, as the exciting and detailed handling of passages accumulates, any disappointment dwindles in the rearview mirror. Unfolding the various associations of keywords (printed in boldfa ce), King's research ultimately enriches what readers of the poetry most value: Milton's language. Fine readings of the use of "transubstantiation," and "altar," of "fruit" and of "idolatry" fill out Milton's parody of Catholicism and formalism in the later books of Paradise Lost, and have already been put to good use in at least one classroom.
