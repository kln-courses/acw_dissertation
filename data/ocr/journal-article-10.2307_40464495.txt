Through consideration of a diverse se- lection of representations related to the killing of dugong and pigs, this essay suggests that asymmetric roles of men and women in the social relations of hunting realized a broad pattern of simultaneous antipathy and affinity between hunting and procreation. Through animal signs, Kiwai recognized inter- connections between human reproduction and human mortality while simultaneously repressing unacceptable aspects of this interconnectedness. [South coast New Guinea, animal symbol- ism, anthropomorphism and the margins of the social world, embodiment, hunting and gender] Rupert Stasch, Ph.D. candidate, University of Chicago, is con- ducting dissertation research on Korowai social organization and material life in the southern interior lowlands of Irian Jaya, Indonesia. 1. Introduction: Mortality, Reproduction, and Anthropomorphic Animals In an extended parenthesis on the meaningfulness of animals in "Les deux sources de la morale et de la religion," Henri Bergson (1932: 192) postulated that, relative to our perception of fellow humans, we tend to perceive an animal less as an individual than as an instantiation of a type and a quality (cf. Boas 1940: 485). Lévi-Strauss has subsequent- ly suggested that this tendency makes animals powerful signs for thinking about the constitution of social differences within human communities (1962b: 132-136) or even the ultimate disconti- nuity of reality in general (1962a: 178-181), but this is perhaps to neglect the importance of animals in the constitution of the category of "humanity" in particular. In interaction with an animal, hu- mans may also perceive themselves more starkly as tokens of a species, not only because the animal other is so different that in interaction with it cer- tain of the human self's type-level qualities may stand out more sharply than in interaction with other humans, but also because, in their species- specific ways, an animal and a human share in common their condition of embodiment. Animals and humans alike are possessed of a definite corpus of living matter, and are bound to organic pro- cesses such as alimentation, locomotion, growth, sexual reproduction, and death by virtue of which this corpus exists through time and space as an individual instantiation of a species-type. In this paper, I hope to show how for Kiwai of south New Guinea about one century ago, culturally-ordered apperceptions of sexual reproduction, death, and species as aspects of individual animal bodies were themselves formative of ongoing experience of sexual reproduction, mortality, and species as aspects of human embodiment. Kiwai communities are found on the islands and banks of the Fly River estuary and in the adjacent coastal region southwest of the Fly delta and north of the Torres Strait. In this paper I will consider in turn the hunting of dugong and pigs, among the most important and most anthropomorphized animals in Kiwai thought - though it should be particularly noted that, while pigs and pig-hunting have been pan-Kiwai interests, dugong are marine animals, hunted only by coastal Kiwai, not by Fly River Kiwai. Dugong and pigs approximate the gross size and shape of humans more closely than do other south New Guinea animals, sharing with humans such distinctive mammalian features as pregnancy, live birth, and lactation. Several sirenian characteristics are particularly evocative of human reproduction: dugong have two pectoral teats, and a female bears one calf and attends to it closely for a year or longer, frequently appearing to carry this single young on her back. Kiwai them- selves have remarked that the length of gestation is the "same as people" (Eley 1988: 316). Such traits help explain why Kiwai have tended to associate dugong with human sexuality and childbearing, just as the notorious strength and dangerousness of wild boars helps explain why Kiwai have tended to associate pigs with warfare and homicide. Yet these biological and behavioral anthropomor- phisms are material anchors in much broader pro-</page><page sequence="2">360 cesses of moral and semiotic anthropomorphism. Kiwai, like other hunting peoples, frequently rep- resent and experience their prey as "reactive so- cial others" (Brightman 1993: 2), coparticipants in a common social universe (e.g., Schiefflin 1976: 94 f.; Silberbauer 1981: 67; cf. Luckmann 1970; Landtman 1934: 112). These relatively ex- plicit representations of animals as human-like subjects are one extreme in a spectrum of more dif- fuse semiotic humanizations in which objectified anthropomorphic significance is invested in animal beings. In the Kiwai context, representations of species difference and human-animal relations lead again and again to issues of gender difference and intrahuman relations of sexual reproduction, and it is to the comparative problem of the ar- ticulation between sexual differentiation and the killing of animals that my concluding theoretical suggestions will be addressed. While the relation between gender and hunting is well-recognized as a crucial ethnographic issue and has received many important treatments (e.g., Rosaldo and Atkinson 1975; Testart 1986a; Brightman n.d., and localized studies cited therein), the Kiwai literature holds some uniquely extreme constructions on the theme; I only hope I may be forgiven for enisperhaps inflicting some uniquely extreme constructions of my own on the reported facts, especially consider- ing that I presume to discuss gender difference when voices of Kiwai women are virtually unrep- resented in the sources. The interpretations pre- sented here are an attempt to indicate something of the complexity of interconnection discernible in even a very small selection of extant details con- cerning a single facet of Kiwai life at a particular ethnohistorical moment (cf. Knauf t 1993: 26-31, 241 fn. 4) - a complexity of interconnection that in general has not been explicitly indicated in the source descriptions and has found only occasional recognition in secondary studies (e.g., Reschke 1938; Wood 1974; Knauft 1993; cf. Mauss 1969). 2. Dugong "Dugong hunting is what we Kiwai do" (Noel Mapa, quoted by Thomas Eley, 1988: i). Men of coastal Kiwai communities harpooned dugong from the bows of outrigger canoes or from stationary platforms. In platform harpooning, the tall wooden frameworks were assembled at positions on a reef frequented by the feeding animals at night. Harpooners stationed themselves on these platforms, while other men waited in Rupert Stasch canoes. When a dugong approached, the harpooner struck out by moonlight and phosphorescence with his harpoon, throwing himself off the platform as well to generate enough force to drive the harpoon head through the animal's thick hide. The harpoon shaft would separate from the harpoon head, and the dugong would flee out to sea. If the harpoon line was not earlier secured to the platform, the harpooner himself grabbed the line and was dragged along after the animal. The canoe crew chased the stricken dugong, drowned it bloodlessly, and tied it to the canoe to be brought to shore in the early morning (Landtman 1927: 125 f., 139; Riley 1925: 132-136; Olewale and Sedu 1982: 253; compare Haddon 1912: 166 -168, plate 23; Raven 1990; Thomson 1934). Kiwai have not hunted dugong from platforms since before World War II, but harpooning from canoes and other vessels has continued to be of great social importance in the coastal area (Olewa- le and Sedu 1982; Eley 1988). Here I will be con- cerned with harpooning as documented for an ear- lier time. The physical and technological encounter between harpooner and dugong was conceived and represented as a social relationship, itself infolded within a wider field of relations including not only the harpooner' s immediate attendants but other fel- low humans not visibly present on the harpooning scene: wives, children, and even deceased parents. In this social field, events of dugong death were se- lectively and alternately represented as comparable to human events of sexual intercourse, parturition, and death, affording animal-mediated representa- tions of the interrelationships between sex, birth, and death as human events. 2.1 Harpooning as Sex In many of its constitutive representations, har- pooning was eroticized. The long lines by which stricken dugong were reined in were plaited around a central strand called the "penis" (Landtman 1927: 124; cf. Eley 1988: 229), while the per- sonified and highly valued long wooden harpoon shafts were invested with intense phallic signif- icance. For example, when a man had selected a tree from which to make a harpoon shaft, he would press "his body against the trunk, with his member pointing towards the top of the tree, thus in statu erectionis symbolizing the straight and perfect harpoon-shaft which will be produced from the wood" (Landtman 1927: 120; cf. 122). However, overt identification of a harpooning in- strument with a penis also had its limits, as in Anthropos 91.1996</page><page sequence="3">Killing as Reproductive Agency the story of a man who, having spotted a dugong but with no harpoon close at hand, followed his naked wife's suggestion of spearing the animal with his erect penis. Successful, the man continued harpooning in this way for several days, until he was killed by a shark, after which his bereaved widow burned down her house, with herself in it (Landtman 1917: 435; cf. Eley 1988: 114). The causal relation between the man's unconventional use of his penis and his violent death is but one reminder that identification of harpooning with sex was incomplete and relative, not absolute. Sex and harpooning are in themselves complicated sociological activities, involving many different objects and many different categories of actors. Any given mode of identifying harpooning with sex involved identifying particular role relations of sex with particular role relations of harpooning. While only men harpooned dugong, their wives contributed importantly to the success of expedi- tions, in part through preparatory sexual rites. In one rite, harpooner and wife had sex on a path leading to their village, with the harpoon head, as well as the cord used to tie together the harpooning platform, lying upon the woman's body, and with the woman holding certain leaves in her hands and armpits (Landtman 1927: 128). Back in the village, the lethal end of the harpoon shaft was rested on some of these leaves. Before the harpooner set out, the woman sat with her legs spread, and her husband inserted some of the other leaves into her vagina. She removed them and put them into the hole in the flared end of the harpoon shaft, where the harpoon head would later be inserted. When the platform was assembled on the reef, leaves were removed from the hole in the harpoon, chewed, and spit onto the first support pole (Landt- man 1927: 132). "The idea is that the perfumed leaves impart their nature to the sticks and board of the narato [platform], and that this perfume at- tracts the animal and lures it to certain destruction" (Riley 1925: 134). Remaining leaves were also chewed and spit out by the waiting harpooner, with the objective of luring dugong (Landtman 1927: 132). Artifacts and leaves served as material media by which harpooning acts were tied to sexual acts, iconically by virtue of shape or relative position and indexically by virtue of spatiotemporal con- tinuity (cf. Peirce 1955: 104-108). A harpoon head and shaft in use on the platform signified a penis, and the bulbous hollow end of the shaft a vagina, by virtue of both formal resemblance and prior participation in coital rites. More globally, the act of harpooning itself signified (inter alia) Anthropos 91.1996 361 sexual intercourse, both iconically as an act of penetrating a body with a shaft and indexically through artifact-mediated spatiotemporal contact with prior marital sex. Below I will repeatedly characterize representational relations as forms of "identification," meaning that between the recip- rocal signs and sign-objects so identified (e.g., harpoon and penis, harpooning and intercourse, human body and animal body) there exists a "tropically complex" (Turner 1991: 147) arrange- ment of crosscutting iconic and indexical links such that the global standing-for relation appears multiply determined and naturalized. The efficacy of the rite described above rests in linking kill- ing of dugong to the morally viable precedent of marital sex, by making sex an indexical icon of harpooning and harpooning an indexical icon of sex: mutually diagrammatic likenesses wrought in contiguous media (cf. Turner 1991: 148 f.). Of particular concern will be iconic and indexical relations in the medium of role categories, such that one or more of the terms is a human actor and the sign relation is also an "identification" in the more Freudian sense of subjects constituting and transforming themselves in assimilating them- selves to objective others (Laplanche and Pontalis 1973: 205-208). In the rite already summarized, it was the harpooner himself who had sexual intercourse with the wife, implying an identification of the harpooner' s wife with the dugong, the wife's partic- ipation in the sexual rite offering a precedent for the dugong' s anticipated participation/ in the act of harpooning. Likewise, once on the platform, one way a harpooner would avoid explicit ver- balization of the creature's dugong identity was to summon the animal by his wife's name (Landtman 1927: 132). However, in another preparatory sexu- al rite described by Landtman, the harpooner asked a friend to have mock intercourse with his wife. In this case, too, the harpoon head was placed upon the body of the woman. Her husband stood by, and then held the head in his right hand while his wife anointed it with her vaginal fluids and squeezed his hand, with the intended effect that the harpoon would be thrown straight and the head fixed firmly in the prey's body (Landtman 1927: 129). The structure of role relations in this second rite implies an identification of sex and harpooning in which the dugong was represented not as a woman but as a man, for here it was not the wife herself but her male lover who most directly stood for the animal. "By-and-by dugong come same fashion along narato (the platform), he want that thing along my woman. All same that man (the assistant</page><page sequence="4">362 at the rite), all same dugong he come alongside my woman, he follow that woman" (Landtman 1927: 129). 1 A similar construal of the dugong as male, and as lover of the harpooner's wife, occurr- ed in a woman's exhibitions of coital accessibility while her husband was on the reef. She wore her grass skirt loosely during the day, and slept nude at night. "Sometimes in the night she lies down naked on her back at the door through which her husband has passed out, holding her feet widely apart, one at each doorpost. This causes the dugong to come" (Landtman 1927: 138). Representations of the dugong as the wife's lover implicitly identified the animal prey with the harpooner himself as well, by virtue of shared sexual relation to one woman. A more explicit identification of harpooner and dugong with each other vis-à-vis sexual access to the wife occurred in a rite for restoring a man's capacity to capture dugong when it had been disrupted "through some deficiency on the part of the woman." The husband and wife went to a creek or swamp, and the harpooner lay down in the water in front of his wife and crawled between her legs, "all same dugong walk about," thereby overcoming what- ever obstacle had blocked his harpooning success (Landtman 1927: 129 f.; see also 133 f.). Alternately both woman and man, both har- pooner's wife and harpooner, across these various representations the dugong prey was a multivocal sign, its death at the hands of humans more com- plex still. In representation, the harpooner penetrat- ed the animal as he penetrated his own wife, yet the animal had sex with the wife as the harpooner's friend did, or passed between the wife's legs in the person of the harpooner himself. Nor were hus- band and wife the only roles implicated in this pro- cess of crosscutting anthropomorphizations. The hollowed and bulbous front end of a harpoon shaft, for example, was associated with the breast of the harpoon-maker's wife, and the harpoon head with her nipple (Landtman 1933: 27), implying identification of harpooning with breast-feeding. Addressing a dugong, the harpooner would some- times refer to his own wife as "mother belong you," and describe leaves on the platform post as food left by this mother for the dugong (Landt- man 1927: 132). Dugong were in such respects Rupert Stasch represented as children of human mothers and their harpooner husbands (cf. Landtman 1917: 236 f.), another identification of the killers with the killed, but one that drew harpooning into comparison with not just a human sexual encounter but the larger social process of human sexual reproduction. 2.2 Harpooning as Parturition Killing, conceived as a social relation between two subjects, involves some sense of reciprocity of perspectives (after Schutz 1967: 10-13, 126, 312-329), but has irreducibly asymmetric aspects. An unexpected reversal might be possible, but in the event one being kills and one is killed. In the world Kiwai shared with the dugong they hunt- ed, the hierarchical implications of killing were especially intense in connection with parturition. A parturitional condition was evaluated very dif- ferently depending upon whether it was predicat- ed of humans or of dugong (the killing species or the killed one), and depending upon whether, among humans, it was predicated of women or of men. A waiting harpooner might summon a dugong to his platform by saying "You come, piccanin- ny [child] you got inside, I want kobori [copu- late with] you" (Landtman 1927: 132; see also p. 141). Kiwai have preferred to harpoon female dugong because females, especially pregnant ones, are fattier, tastier, and easier to kill than males (Nietschmann and Nietschmann 1981: 57; Olewale and Sedu 1982: 253; Eley 1988: 234-237). Fur- thermore, dugong fetuses have been considered "a particular delicacy" (Landtman 1927: 141), and "excellent food for older people, being very soft and easy to eat when cooked" (Olewale and Sedu 1982: 253). But given identification of harpooning with sexual intercourse, quantitative or gustatory motives for preferring to harpoon pregnant females cannot be easily separated from simultaneous telic significance of sex during pregnancy. Kiwai notions of human fetal development stressed the importance of coital contributions by the father throughout the greater part of pregnancy. Without regular sexual intercourse between husband and wife, the fetus would not develop normally and the delivery would be difficult (Landtman 1917: 460 fn. 1; 1927: 230). With harpooning presented as coitus and dugong prey identified as the harpoon- er's wife, the preference for harpooning pregnant dugong implies similarity between the purpose of having sex during pregnancy and the purpose of stabbing a dugong. Dugong destruction was drawn Anthropos 91.1996 1 At the time Landtman' s fieldwork from May 1910 to May 1912, many men in coastal Kiwai villages could speak an English-based pidgin learned through labor on pearling boats in the Torres Strait (cf. Mühlhäusler 1978). Landtman transcribes this pidgin using English orthography. Paren- thetic glosses are Landtman' s own; I have elided a few with- out notice. Square brackets indicate my own interventions.</page><page sequence="5">Killing as Reproductive Agency into parallel with human procreation, as though killing dugong and making healthy human babies were somehow two aspects of a single kind of ac- tion. Along convergent lines, it is remarkable that a harpooner would verbally declare his filial relation to his son at the very moment that he struck out at a dugong' s life. As a man leapt from the platform to penetrate the animal's body, he yelled out his son's name, calling for example "I am Waiba's father, Waiba, Waiba!" (Riley 1925: 138, 140, 266; cf. Haddon 1912: 171). Not only was pregnancy a valued condition of dugong prey, but cross-generational transmission of harpooning ability was itself celebrated as a form of male parturition. A young man returning to the beach after his first dugong kill underwent a ritual birth. The carcass was laid out upon the ground, and the boy's father, mother's brother, or other senior male relative stood astride it, facing the animal's head. The boy crawled from back to front between the man's legs and over the dugong. When the boy's own head was directly over that of the animal, the boy's mother fed him various materials evocative of predatory animal behavior. "Thenceforth the boy will become a strong and successful harpooner of dugong and will not be afflicted with any sickness" (Landtman 1927: 140). The young man's close horizontal passage over the killed dugong was an enactment of bodily identity (cf. Rasmussen 1931: 167), as is suggested in part by the fact that it was the conjunction of human and dugong heads that cued the boy's ingestion of beneficial substances. Yet this identification of harpooning boy and harpooned dugong coincided with a passage between the legs of a senior male. In this rite the boy passed between the man's legs from back to front, whereas in the rite of reopening the "road" to harpooning success discussed earlier, the harpooner passed through his wife's legs from front to back, reflecting the contrasting direc- tionality of birth and sexual intercourse, the two respective bodily activities upon which the rites were apparently modeled. In the first-kill rite, the boy's success in dugong hunting was tied to his birth as dugong-child from the loins of his senior male relative. Lacking wombs in their own bodies, men were able to match the procreative ability of women, reproducing their own sex as killers independently by means of an external womb, the appropriated body of the animal they kill - a body that, as seen, was ideally possessed of a uterus, enclosing a fetus. Although this first-kill rite presented an intense identification of boy with dugong and killer with killed, the dugong' s life had already been ended, Anthropos 91.1996 363 while the boy acceded to adulthood empowered to kill again. If harpooners identified with their prey, it was only long enough to kill a dugong side of themselves, and be reborn more human for having done so. The relation between human and dugong remained hierarchical, for the two species were not identified absolutely but aspec- tually. The relation of sameness was not simply between humans and dugong, but between human reproduction and dugong destruction. Moreover, this relation was directional. Sexual intercourse between husband and wife supported dugong de- struction, and dugong destruction supported male filiation, but human heterosexual reproduction did not support harpooners' efforts to destroy dugong. On the contrary, inasmuch as the existence of men rested in the wombs of women, men could not kill dugong at all. Someone could secretly compromise other men's abilities to take dugong by performing rites and spells representing them as having returned to the wombs of their moth- ers (Landtman 1927: 135 f.). The sharpest expres- sion of incompatibility between sexual reproduction and male hunting ability, however, was the stip- ulation that a man could not harpoon dugong or otherwise participate in harpooning expedi- tions while his wife was menstruating or preg- nant (Landtman 1927: 114; Riley 1925: 119, 132; Beaver 1920: 67). This contrasts tellingly with the valorization of harpooning pregnant dugong: females of the killed species should be pregnant, but females of the killing species must not be. Dugong may have been identified with humans, a man's dugong prey identified with his human wife, but the procreative ability of women was actively withheld from these identities. A woman's vital sexual participation in her husband's harpooning efforts had to be free of overt procreative con- tent, as though openly recognizing the similarities between dugong pregnancy and human pregnancy would be recognizing too much. If a man violated the prohibition on hunting during his wife's pregnancy, he would be himself injured or killed, as in the story of a certain Gatori, who complies with his pregnant wife's request that he try to get her some dugong meat (Landtman 1917: 369). Gatori harpoons a pregnant dugong, but his genitals become entangled in the harpoon line, and when the dugong pulls the line tight they are cut off. Gatori sinks to the bottom, dead. The members of his crew, incapacitated by grief, are blown away by the wind and suffer further tragic misadventures. When the only two survivors final- ly make it home and report Gatori' s fate, they are clubbed to death by Gatori' s father, who then goes</page><page sequence="6">364 on to club Gatori's wife, and finally throws himself onto a spear in the middle of a large fire.2 The narrative thus presents a striking inversion of the desired relation between the hunting species and the hunted one. Rather than a pregnant dugong being killed through a conjugal act of spearing on the part of a man, a man is killed through an act of castration on the part of a pregnant dugong. Rather than the dugong' s death furthering the lives of humans and supporting the harpooner's filial generativity, the father of the harpooner ends up slaying his emasculated son's fecund mate (whose non-herbivorous cravings prompted the transgres- sion in the first place), and then mortally harpoon- ing himself as well, negating all past and future hu- man reproductivity. The precision and complexity of these inversions suggests that both the prohi- bition itself and the destructive consequences of its transgression were alternative resolutions of a single underlying problem. Between the killing of dugong and the sexual reproduction of humans there were both profound similarities and profound differences. The similarities could be exploited to human benefit, as when sex between husbands and wives helped men harpoon, or when harpoon- ing empowered men in their project of pseudo- parturitional generation of powerful sons. Through these various representations, the radical asymme- try in the normal organization of human-dugong relations - human hunter routinely prevailing over animal prey - was made morally acceptable by appeal to intrahuman precedents of sex and sexual reproduction. Killing dugong was paradoxically construed as more like sex than death, more like making human life than taking it. Yet on the other hand, absolute recognition of the similarities be- tween dugong mortality and human reproduction, with suspension of all differences, would produce a self-contradictory condition in which the dis- tinction between humans and animals and the dis- tinction between killing and reproducing were both entirely collapsed. Gatori, in killing a pregnant du- gong, would have been at once striking a blow for human reproductive potency and killing the double of his own pregnant wife. At crucial moments the similarities between the killing of dugong and the sexual reproduction of humans had to be repressed and the differences stressed, whether through the Rupert Stasch observation of a taboo or, in the face of human indiscretion, through the automatic consequences believed to result from the taboo's transgression. In particular, men's capacity for lethal penetration of dugong bodies depended upon a decomposi- tion of the usual intrahuman relationship between sexuality and procreation, men and women having sex so that, among other things, women would give birth to babies. Within the wider, interspecies field, intrahuman sex was denied any immediate human heterosexual reproductive implications, even as the penetration of dugong bodies, supported as it was by husband-wife sexuality, was ultimately con- strued as effecting a kind of sexual reproduction exclusive to men. 2.3 Harpooning as Death The efficacy of the representations discussed thus far turns upon displacement or denial of the idea that harpooning a dugong causes the animal to die, and the animal's death is comparable to hu- man death. However, a further side of harpooning practice remains to be considered, in which sim- ilarity between dugong death and human death was clearly recognized. Kiwai believed that assistance from deceased human forebears was crucial to har- pooners' success (cf. Landtman 1917: 159-164, 184 f.; 1927: 141, 259-262), and this conviction motivated an elaborate annual ceremonial event meant to renew ancestors' beneficence. For about six weeks at the beginning of the dry season, coastal villages staged a complex series of dances in front of the horiomu, an arrangement of tall co- conut leaf screens on the beach (Riley 1925: 179 f.; Landtman 1927: 328 f., Fig. 95, 96). The perform- ers were ostensibly visitors from the land of the dead far to the west. For the entire duration of the ceremonial period, men of the community lived in the company of these many visitors in the screened horiomu space. For particular dances, women and children living in the village were summoned to the ceremonial grounds, where they sat as au- dience, prohibited from entering the internal back- stage area. Men generally remained on the enclos- ed bush side of the screens. Although women and children believed, or were only mandated to be- lieve, that the dancers were visitors from the land of the dead, it was the living men themselves who emerged in costume to perform (Riley 1925: 187, 300; Landtman 1927: 335). In the most important episode, enacted repeatedly throughout the course of each year's celebration, these men impersonat- ed particular recently deceased individuals of the Anthropos 91.1996 2 The events of this narrative were set in the western Torres Strait, although the story itself was related to Landtman by coastal Kiwai men. The entire technology of harpooning and much that went with it was imported by coastal Kiwai from their western Torres Strait neighbors (Landtman 1927: 126 f., 329 f.).</page><page sequence="7">Killing as Reproductive Agency community, covering their own bodies with char- coal, feathers, twigs, leaves, and other vegetation and dancing for several minutes in front of the deceased's mourning female relatives (Landtman 1927: 334-336). To sustain the impression that it was the dead person who actually appeared, men displayed distinctive ornaments of the deceased, ensured that impersonators were of correct height, and made a point of asking women for extra food for themselves beyond that brought to give to the visitors (Landtman 1927: 333, 335). Following the first performance of the dance commemorating the recently deceased, men went on dugong expeditions, and were expected to do particularly well (Landtman 1927: 335). Killing dugong was an integral part of horiomu celebra- tions, not only in the alternation between dance performances and harpooning expeditions over the course of the ceremonial period, but also in the form of the performances themselves. The ho- riomu enclosure originated as a special place for butchering dugong and turtles (Riley 1925: 178 f.), and the ceremonial area was in many respects a dislocated simulation of the harpooning platform and surrounding sea of dugong death. At the onset of the ceremonial period, the horiomu was invest- ed with sexualized dugong food. Sea grass was brought back from a harpooning expedition, and an old man and woman had sex at the entrance to the screened off space, smearing the grass with their genital fluids and then planting this food at various places in and around the enclosure. This was done shortly after sunset, "at the time when the dugong generally appear before the harpooners waiting on the reefs: the people 'want learn (teach) him dugong he come quick; no good man wait him long time'" (Landtman 1927: 334). The spatial distribution of harpooning gear inside and around the screens throughout the ceremonial period is also suggestive: harpoon heads and platform ropes on the ground within the enclosure, harpoon shafts leaned against the inside of the screens, and plat- form support poles against the outside (Landtman 1927: 328, 341), implying an iconic transposition of the vertical plane of the harpooning platform onto the horizontal plane of the horiomu grounds. The internal space of the enclosure was like the platform upon which the harpooner waited, the horiomu screen was like the horizontal surface of the platform, and the outer performance area, where women and children sat, was like the water in which the dugong swam and into which the harpooner dove. Even apart from dances in which performers carried harpoons and used them mi- metically (Landtman 1927: 341 f.), the implication Anthropos 91.1996 365 is that women and children in the external space were like dugong, and impersonators who emerged to perform before these women and children were in a sense "harpooning" them. At the same time that horiomu performances in- corporated these harpooning references, trappings of horiomu performance were incorporated into the conduct of harpooning. Most notably, the presence of human dead on the harpooning scene was en- acted during a special dugong expedition mounted near the end of the horiomu period, an expedition once again expected to be particularly successful. Men set out with their harpooning instruments in an organized march directly from the internal horiomu space, and once on the reef harpooners ascended their platforms, and leapt from them to strike their prey, wearing the same "grass shrouds" they had been wearing as costumes during the rites (Landtman 1927: 346 f.). The positive effects of horiomu performance on harpooning fortune were thought to follow from the satisfaction experienced by the dead in seeing living relatives commemorate them. Men, for all their dissimulation, were quite certain that the dead were present at horiomu performances (al- beit invisibly), and that particular dead would later help harpooners get dugong if enough effort was put into performances in their honor (Landtman 1927: 332, 335, 348; Riley 1925: 300-302). The imputed ability of the dead to help the living get dugong would itself seem to presuppose a special parity between humans who had died and dugong who were to be hunted. This assumption of parity can be discerned in a number of different horiomu contexts, but it is particularly explicit in the person of mum, one of the most important among a vast range of stereotypical characters who appeared in full horiomu performances. Muru danced with his body covered in harpooning gear, and brought suc- cess to harpooners who later used the objects he carried (Landtman 1927: 341). On the closing day of the horiomu period, when men of a neighboring village were brought in to impersonate the mass of departing figures so that the local men could sit in the audience alongside of the women (to further the impression that the performers had truly been visitors from the land of the dead), muru was the last to emerge from the screen enclosure, and as he came out in full harpooning regalia and walked off a man standing at the entrance of the horiomu yanked him backwards off his feet by pulling on a rope tied to his belt, iconic of the reining in of a harpooned dugong. The more sparks fell from mum's firebrand as he was jerked backwards, the more dugong would be captured</page><page sequence="8">366 on that night's harpooning expedition, the sparks themselves associated with harpooners diving from their platforms (Landtman 1927: 348). Harpooners collected the fallen muru and carried him back into the horiomu. He remained motionless, "for his purpose is to 'teach' the dugong to allow them- selves to be caught quietly after being harpooned" (Landtman 1927: 347). Inside the horiomu, har- pooners reclaimed their gear, and tied pieces of muru' s decorations to their harpooning implements and their bodies. Muru remained inside the enclo- sure during that night's expedition, and as dugong were harpooned and the grass decorations broke off from plummeting harpoons and harpooners, he himself was supposed to feel a twitch on the part of his body where he had earlier worn those particular decorations (Landtman 1927: 348). At once a deceased human, a walking pile of har- pooning equipment, a trammeled dugong, and a conglomeration of body parts and bodily exten- sions multiply evocative of the event of harpoon strike, muru was thus also the one visitor from the land of the dead who stayed behind when the others went home, forcibly detained by the living in the same manner by which dugong were forcibly detained for death and consumption. In this sudden passage from honored guest to passive prisoner, muru condensed in his very person a principle that, in more diffuse form, undergirded all assistance thought to be given to harpooners by deceased humans. The dead were the only kind of people who, in intending the death and bodily disintegra- tion of dugong, were wishing on the animals a loss or surrender of self-determination that they themselves had experienced. As already seen, though, this recognition of continuity between human death and dugong death itself depended crucially on the mediation of a deceived female audience to supply food, earnest mourning, and a negative cpunterimage against which the "truth" of men's own belief in the presence of the dead could be affirmed and pre- supposed (cf. Mannoni 1969: 16, 33). The rep- resentational ties between sexual differentiation, horiomu deception, and the killing of dugong were particularly direct in the sociology of perpet- uating ritual secrecy through time. The horiomu performances, like other secrecy-imbued collective Kiwai events, had an initiatory component. When boys were initiated, they underwent a radical sep- aration from their mothers and all other women (Riley 1925: 189 f.; Landtman 1927: 237). A boy's initiation into horiomu secrecy in particular was preceded by a rite of departure from the long house of his mother. His mother lay down on the veranda Rupert Stasch of her house, with her head on the threshold and her feet directed towards the ladder. The son exited the house by walking through the door and over his supine mother, treading with one foot on her abdomen: "what place boy he come from that time he born, he finish now along that place" (Landtman 1927: 345). This arrangement of bodies contrasts sharply with the pseudo-parturitional first-kill rite, marked by horizontal passage between the legs of a standing senior male. In leaving his mother's womb and domestic space, the boy did not crawl between her legs while she stood, but rather walk- ed over her as she reclined. While birth between the legs of a senior male signaled a youth's bodily dependence on men's ability to generate filiation by killing dugong, in the act of leaving the house of women and children, the youth was made to assert that his mother's womb was no longer a condition of his existence and had only a negative or subordinate place in his passage to adulthood. Immediately after this rite, initiates were taken by their mothers' brothers to the horiomu area. Brought within the screened space for the first time, the boys were shown that performers were actually living humans. A youth was qualified to hunt dugong only after this transition away from maternal residence and the maternal body that bore him; soon after horiomu initiation, expeditions were organized for the initiates to learn the tech- niques of harpooning and achieve their first kills (Riley 1925: 200). Deceiving women was a con- dition of killing dugong not just in the communal efficacy of horiomu but also in the biography of the individual hunter. In sum, horiomu deception enacted in role re- cruitment over the life course principles of sexual differentiation similar to those more schematically operative in the first-kill rite and the everyday organization of harpooning. In and through their hunting actions, men expropriated not only the form but also the (male) progeny of women's reproductivity. In the everyday eroticization of harpooning, dugong were, in a sense, "deceived" into believing that being harpooned was like en- gaging in sexual intercourse, with the effect that men could use this sexualized activity of harpoon- ing as a means of quasi-procreative reproduc- tion of themselves and the sexually differenti- ated collectivity in which they existed - even as women were paradoxically made marginal to the "procreative" aspect of dugong death through their exclusion from the actual act of killing, through the suppression of their own reproductivity from the sexualization of harpooning, and through their instrumental deception in the course of horiomu Anthropos 91.1996</page><page sequence="9">Killing as Reproductive Agency commemoration. The animate or de-animated du- gong body, as a social other marginal to human- ity, and as the focal object and product of the total social act of harpooning, was itself eminently qualified to signify in naturalized form the many crosscutting human identities and processes that were simultaneously implicated in this same act: women's bodies, harpooners' bodies, children's bodies, the life course of hunters, male and fe- male sexual organs, sexual difference, deception of women, human death, and, especially, the unity and uneasy differentiation of mortality and sexual reproduction. 3. Pigs ". . . car il lui semblait que du meurtre des ani- maux dépendait le sort de ses parents" (Flaubert 1956: 108). Although individual Kiwai men routinely hunt- ed pigs during the day with the aid of dogs and at night by lying in wait or stalking, the mean- ingfulness of killing these particular animals was most elaborated in a ritual called moguru, an ex- tremely important collective event and a crucial step in the sequence of initiations undergone by maturing boys.3 During the wet season, the ritual was a prerequisite to any head-hunting raid, and was usually staged several times (Riley 1925: 208; Landtman 1927: 350). In what follows I will con- sider only the outlines of the most important epi- sode of this ritual, with little to say about routine, non-ritual pig hunts - although my presumption is that even ritually unelaborated events of killing and consuming a pig would have been in one sense diminutive moguru performances, with im- plicitly much the same meaning. The ritual was itself a reenactment of inaugural events recounted in an extremely important narrative about a hero named Marunogere or "old [ancestral] Maru" (cf. Landtman 1927: 10, 357 f.; Riley 1932: 107 s.v. maruu, 1 1 1 s.v. nogere), and it is with this secret narrative that any discussion of the meaningfulness of pigs in Kiwai thought should perhaps begin. What follows is my paraphrase of the longest available version of this story, told to Landtman by a coastal narrator but set in lasa, a center of wet season ceremonial life on Kiwai Island in the Fly estuary (Landtman 1917: 340-344; compare pp. 344 f.; Riley 1925: 276 f.). 367 Marunogere instructs the people of lasa to move out of their holes in the ground and build a men's house. Then he wants to hold a moguru ceremony, but he does not know what to use. He tries, in succession: arrows, coconuts, fish, a pandanus mat, firewood, and crabs and shellfish. Each time, the people tie the objects to the central post of the new men's house and dance all night. However, when they go to attack another village after each of these successive efforts to perform the ceremony correctly, they are defeated and suffer heavy losses. After thinking the matter over at length, Marunogere has the women cook a lump of sago for him, which he swallows whole. Upon passing the lump intact in the bush the next morning, Marunogere sees that it has become a small pig. The pig grows quickly, but its body lacks features. Using the parts of a coconut he has carried with him, Marunogere gives the animal hair, a tail, tusks, teeth, ears, eyes, and a mouth, and also assigns it various words for "pig," as well as his own name, "Marunogere." Marunogere the man returns to the village, telling the pig to stay behind and not bite the people when they come out to get him, for the people are all his brothers. Sending the people out to retrieve this new animal, Maruno- gere tells them not to kill it, but does not identify the animal for them. The people do not get the right species at first, bringing home in succession a small monitor, a large monitor, a rat, a wallaby, a kangaroo, a cassowary, and a monitor-like monster. These animals are tossed aside with the discarded objects from prior unsuccessful moguru performances. At last the dogs find the pig. The people, terrified of the animal, call to Marunogere for help. Marunogere tells them that he cannot come to help, reassures them that the pig will not bite them because it is their little brother, and reaffirms that they must not kill the pig but are rather to bind it and bring it back to the village. The people do as they are instructed, but just as they have tied up the pig, Marunogere' s youngest son approaches and shoots the animal dead with an arrow. Marunogere is very angry, and asserts that now everyone will have to die. If the pig had been kept alive, there would have been no death among humans. The pig is decorated, carried into the village, and placed on a platform near the central post of the men's house. Without the knowledge of the women, young initiates are made to crawl from behind through the legs of the older men and over the pig. Finally, a dance is held. Had the pig not been killed, it would have been allowed to escape into the bush, and Marunogere himself would also have lived. Instead, Marunogere and his wife die. Marunogere returns to life briefly, instructing the people to cut up his wife and the pig, and mix the blood of the two. On the night after the ceremony, Marunogere enters the house where the women sleep. He bores a hole in each of them with a bone dagger - "before this the women's vulva had no opening" - and pours some of the mixed blood into the hole. "When the women woke up in the morning one after another of them said, 'I got blood! You got blood? You got hole?' 'Yes,' they all whispered." Subsequently, Marunogere pairs the people off, they learn to have sex, and the women become pregnant. Worms with arms and legs breed in the remaining blood, which has been left in a basin in the bush. The worms escape, and some of them become the people of other villages on Kiwai Island, while others become the pigs. Marunogere sends his men to fight other people, and they are successful and kill many victims, demonstrating to Marunogere' s satisfaction that the pig is the correct moguru object, and also demonstrating, contrary to his initial conviction, that killing the pig, rather than sending it back to the bush alive, is the correct procedure. Marunogere then dies permanently, and small pieces of his flesh, his wife's flesh, and the flesh of the moguru pig, as well as fragments of the various ineffective and discarded moguru 3 Knauft (1990) corrects Herdt's (1984: 18-20, 76 fn. 17) mistaken claims that moguru initiation involved homosex- ual anal intercourse. Anthropos 91.1996</page><page sequence="10">368 objects, are preserved for use in promoting garden fertility and harming other people. While it is not my purpose to attempt a full in- terpretation of even this one variant of the Ma- runogere narrative, the story is presented to help unify the wider discussion of the social and ritual meaningfulness of pigs to follow. Conversely, the discussion that follows will at least help clarify why this seemingly heterogeneous array of inau- gural events (construction of the first men's house, creation and destruction of the first pig, first effi- cacious performance of the moguru ritual, onset of menstruation and sexual reproduction, onset of mortality, etc.) might be brought together in the causal order of a single Kiwai myth (cf. Nadelson 1981; Knauft 1993: 136-171). 3.1 Hunters and Mothers in the Body and Blood of a Boar The common identity of pigs and humans was a recurring Kiwai preoccupation. Landtman reports, for example, that "some people wonder whether the real form of a ghost is like that of a man or a pig, for it appears as one or the other" (1927: 281; cf. p. 112). Similarly, at the end of one story involving pig-human intermarriage and transformation of humans into pigs, Landtman' s narrator remarked that "when we eat pig we are in fact eating human flesh" (1917: 293). This identity of human and pig is a central issue in the story of Marunogere as well. The hero asexually trans- forms sago into a pig by passing it into and out of his own body by ingestion and anal birth (cf. Sapir 1977). He gives the pig its external features, shares his own name with the animal, stays away when the pig is captured, and dies as an entailment of the pig's death. This identification of the human hero with the first pig becomes, in the causal course of events, a more general identification of the paired protagonists' respective species, as when the pig's death entails the mortality of all humans, and when the mixed blood of the pig and Marunogere' s wife yields the multitudinous people and pigs of Kiwai Island. However, the most powerful expression of the bodily identity of pigs and humans is the postulate that women's menstrual blood itself also derives from the mixed mortal blood of the mo- guru boar and Marunogere' s wife. This continuity between menstrual blood and pig blood is very paradoxical, because on the one hand menstrual blood was anathema to men's ability to kill, while on the other hand, as is apparent in the actual Rupert Stasch content of the moguru ritual, the slaughtered boar itself was the ultimate epitome and source of male fighting strength. When moguru was to be held, hunters left in the predawn hours to capture a wild pig. Ideally, a boar was taken, and taken alive. The animal was stunned and tied up (Landtman 1927: 356 f.; Riley 1925: 209). He was painted black, white, and red, outfitted with male funeral ornaments, and placed on a wooden litter, in all respects treated like a man's body after death (Landtman 1927: 254, 257, 357). With women and children shut away in their houses, and drums beating and conches blowing, the animal was covered with leaves and carried in a procession into the men's house, where he was placed on a platform in front of the central post. Terrified initiates were brought to see the moguru pig for the first time. Arrows, clubs, beheading knives, and head-carriers were placed on the platform alongside the pig's body. The pig was killed, and his blood sprinkled on these weapons and on the central post of the house. The adult men then stood with their legs spread in a single line leading to a ladder at the rear of the platform on which the pig lay (Landtman 1927: 358). Sometimes, one man lay prostrate on top of the pig, his own head over the head of the animal. The initiates were made to crawl from behind between the legs of the standing men and over the pig (and simultaneously over the prostrate man, if present). Each boy's mother's brother walked alongside of him, and when the boy's head was over the head of the pig he was fed a packet of "'wild' or 'fighting things': a poisonous centipede, an ant, wasp and mosquito, a thorn of a certain creeper, a bone of ... [an anthropophagous monster], the flesh of a fish, where it has been bitten by a shark, [and] a little of the whiskers and nail-parings of a 'big fighting man'" (Landtman 1927: 359). The boy sometimes also had to bite the pig's head. After the initiates had all passed over the pig, the animal was butchered, cooked, and eaten by the oldest people present, with small pieces fed to the boys (Landtman 1927: 359, 378). Various unconsumed parts of the pig, such as the head, were kept for use in promoting horticultural fertility, strengthening the men's house, and dam- aging enemies (Landtman 1927: 360 f.). As the initial trial and error sequence in the Marunogere narrative illustrates, the goal of the moguru ritual was to empower men to carry out successful head-hunting raids. '"Every time people make him moguru,' . . . 'people want blood; altogether thing belong fight he make him hot'" (Landtman 1927: 359). The pig's efficacy as the Anthropos 91.1996</page><page sequence="11">Killing as Reproductive Agency central object of the ritual resided in the animal's characteristic ferocity, which was for Kiwai hunt- ers the most conspicuous and admirable of its qualities. The wild boar "is the principal symbol of fighting among the people, more especially in respect of the stubborn courage it shows when it turns at bay against the attacking dogs" (Landtman 1927: 359; see also p. 12). The pig's dangerous- ness when cornered or wounded was particularly associated with its "powerful head," which it often turned against pursuers with catastrophic conse- quences (Landtman 1927: 443). Passing over the just-slain pig, and ingesting "wild fighting things" with their own heads inclined immediately over the boar's head, even biting this head, youths assim- ilated the pig's strength, even as the pig and its imminent death were assimilated to the boys and their imminent lives as killers. These assimilations were achieved through the ritual act of close bodily passage over the creature, and through the larger contestatory process of subduing, killing, decorating, embracing, and consuming the strong and fierce animal (cf. Valeri 1994b: 113-115). The vanquished pig was at once extrahuman embodi- ment of valued qualities and testimony to human attainment of those qualities. This incorporation of pig ferocity into human agents proceeded not only by anthropomorphiza- tion of wild boars but also by theriomorphization of humans, apparent in the "man bites pig" trans- position and horizontal cheek by jowl intimacies of the moguru passage, in the fact that men imitated the grunting of pigs as they attacked their victims during head-hunting raids (Landtman 1927: 158), and perhaps also in the fact that moguru, mimetic of parturition as it clearly was, was a multiparous birth of an entire cohort of young killers from a collective body of adult men. Consistent with Bergson' s theme, the moguru pig was the matrix for the reproduction of not just a singular human but a whole class of humans, the individual boar standing in a transparent type-to-token relation to its species quality just as the initiated boy stood in a type-to-token relation to manhood and as the particular moguru performance stood in a type-to- token relation to Marunogere's precedent. It is also notable that the theriomorphization of hunters was most extreme precisely when pre- paring to prey upon the ultimate anthropomorphic being (cf. Descola 1994: 268). While details and organizing principles of precolonial Kiwai intra- human killing are beyond the scope of this paper, many aspects of Kiwai head-hunting were contin- uous with the hunting of wild animals (cf. Rosaldo and Atkinson 1975: 58-64; Valeri 1994Z?: 126-130). Anthropos 91.1996 369 It is particularly relevant that juvenile males on their first head-hunting expedition underwent a rite very similar in form to moguru initiation before returning to the home village, the severed heads of just-slain victims occupying the place held by the boar in the moguru ritual proper (Landtman 1927: 161; cf. p. 160). The formal similarity be- tween this rite and the passage over the moguru pig, and their temporal order, suggest that the heads were a kind of material transformation of the mo- guru pig, the killed boar's ultimate humanization. Of more importance, though, is the shared form that suggests such a conjunction in the first place. A boy's accession to lethal manhood through bodily identification with vanquished prey was concurrent with his birth from the loins of senior men. Wild boars and severed heads were implicitly compared not just to each other, but to a third term: if not newborn babies (a head, like a newborn, was product of bloodshed and bodily severance) then at least, more diffusely, the bodily reproductive potential that produced newborns, concentrated in wombs of women and visibly indexed by blood that flows from these wombs. The paradoxical unity of pig blood and reproductive blood is thus paralleled by the paradox that although the moguru rite was itself a hypermasculine enterprise with the purpose of turning boys into men (and men-killers) by separating them from maternal women, as in other such rites the initiate's main patron was typically the most maternal among men (the mother' s brother), and the form of the rite was iconic of the prototypically feminine activity of childbirth. The exclusion of women from moguru was itself even directly likened to the exclusion of men from menstruation and childbirth. "All matters connected with birth are kept more or less from the men," for as one man told Landtman, they are "'moguru belong all woman'" (1927: 230) - though it should not be lost that the two "exclusions" had very unequal backings, the one enforced by supposed automatic and lethal bodily consequences of male contact with reproductive blood, the other by men's will-mediated obligation to kill women who came into contact with moguru performances. Men as destroyers of life were counterposed to women as mortal life's creators (cf. Rosaldo and Atkinson 1975), each the other's undoing. Consistent with the narrative representation of the vagina as a wound cut by Marunogere using a bone dagger (Landtman 1917: 343; cf. Riley 1925: 277, Landtman 1927: 250), warfare-related representa- tions described being mortally wounded as being "afflicted" with feminine reproductivity (Landt- man 1927: 158 f., 278), just as more positively a</page><page sequence="12">370 woman's ability to bear and raise a child to re- place someone killed in warfare was instrumental in arranging peace between hostile communities (Landtman 1927: 166). However, while the prob- lem of differentiating mortality and reproduction was generally assimilated to differentiation of the sexes, the association of reproductivity with wom- en and killing with men (and the opposition be- tween these two poles of association) was far from absolute. For example, wives sometimes went on head-hunting raids with their husbands and used their digging sticks to help dispatch the wounded, indicating that women as such were not incompat- ible with successful head-hunting, but only wom- en in their sexually reproductive aspect (Beaver 1920: 172; Landtman 1927: 149). Conversely, a husband's obligation to give wergeld-like compen- sation to his wife's family if she died in childbirth, and the belief that a man grew thin if his wife was pregnant with a son, also imply recognition that men, too, were irreducibly implicated in the pro- cess of sexual reproduction (Landtman 1927: 171, 230). Of most note in the present context, though, are the couvade-like restrictions on a man hunt- ing while his wife is pregnant or menstruating, pertaining not just to dugong but to all species of animate prey, pigs and humans included. With reference to dugong, I have suggested that this prohibition represses an unacceptable representation of the animal prey as a double of the hunter's bleeding wife, a representation that turns upon the hunter himself and his inherent participation in his wife's reproductive condition. A vivid sense of such participation is conveyed by the idea that the husband of a woman in childbed was himself covered with her blood, although only visible to pigs and dogs (Landtman 1927: 272). Indeed, if the prohibition were actually violated, in theory it was the hunter himself (rather than his would-be prey) who would end up bleeding. He would be killed by a shark, a pig, or (in the case of head-hunting raids) an enemy warrior, or "meet with some other calamity," and "the blood flowing from his wounds in such a case is associated with that of his wife" (Landtman 1927: 114, 149) - suggesting that if anything, the "bleeding prey" was a double of the hunter himself as much as of a menstruating or childbearing woman. Moreover, in the Marunogere narrative the reproductive blood that flows from women's wombs is itself secret- ly represented as continuous with the blood of pigs, and Landtman' s male consultants explicitly alluded to this when accounting for the restriction on hunting pigs during menstruation or pregnancy (Landtman 1927: 114). In these coexisting repre- Rupert Stasch sentations of the consubstantiality of the blood of dying pigs, reproductive women, and hunters, this fluid that courses through bodies but also passes out of or between them is the concrete vehicle of an experience of childbearing, killing of animals, and human mortality as all fundamentally similar and fundamentally related - an experience that cuts across the identities of particular individuals, gen- ders, and species, and across the formal integrity of their bodies (cf. Testait 1986a, 1986e). The paradox of using a pseudoparturitional form to make boys into homicidal men, along with the paradox of the origin of menstrual blood (debilitating to men as it was thought to be) in the homicidally-empowering death of a boar, must be situated in the broader context of this gender- mediated antithetic unity of killing and reproduc- tion. The two paradoxes were alternate aspects of the moguru pig's meaningfulness, the one turning upon the pig's body as iconic locus of formal resemblance and the other turning upon the pig's blood as indexical locus of substantive continuity. Through the slain pig, it was known that ultimate- ly the blood of reproduction was the blood of mortality, and reproductive birth was the birth of death and killing. However, this recognition of the interconnectedness of reproduction and killing was qualified by two hierarchical divisions, one be- tween men and women, and one between humans and pigs. First, while the exclusion of men from childbirth and women from moguru presupposed profound similarity between the two activities, it also consolidated profound difference and asym- metry. In a stimulating unpublished comparison of Kiwai and Marind-Anim initiation rituals that an- ticipates several themes of the present discussion, Michael Wood has argued that the pig moguru and Marunogere narrative sought to deny or overcome the problematic experience that women produce and mediate difference by giving birth not only to females but also to males. Through a ritual mimetic of childbirth, men claimed an exclusive ability to convert death into life to reproduce their own differentiated sex, an ability that encompassed the female uterine potentiality by which these same men have come to exist (Wood 1974: 31-55). In excluding women from participating in or knowing about the moguru ceremony, birth-from-women's form was subordinated and appropriated by killing and the construction of manhood and male fili- ation, at once asserting the unity of reproduction and killing and displacing this unity onto a division between the sexes. Further, recognition of the unity of killing and reproduction was qualified by the animality of the focal sign in which this unity was Anthropos 91.1996</page><page sequence="13">Killing as Reproductive Agency vested, the disjuncture between animal signifier and human signified. Again, killing and reproduc- tion were not identified as such, but rather the killing of pigs was identified with the reproduction of humans. The capacity to kill is achieved through birth, but this birth's womb is unhuman. The ca- pacity to reproduce comes only through mortal bloodshed, but it is an animal who dies and bleeds. The ultimate sequitur, that pig death and human reproduction are themselves displaced moments of human mortality, is buried in the fetishized body of a living creature close enough to humanity to signify the being of humans themselves, but distant enough that recognition of the humanness so signi- fied can be interminably hedged (compare Turner 1985: 104 f.; Valeri 1985: 48). It is this ongoing internalization, projection, and deferral of the unity or similarity of mortality and reproduction that was perhaps at issue in the initiatory human-animal en- counter, in the bodily conjuncture and parturitional passage, in the biting and eating, and in the intense suspense and secrecy surrounding the narrative and ritual knowledge that the efficacious animal was precisely the most human one. 3.2 Mortality and Otherness The spatial organization of food procurement, sex, killing, and other Kiwai life-furthering pro- jects consistently involved transformative move- ment from outside of communities to within them. Dugong, pigs, and other animals were hunted and killed beyond the village, and their meat, like vegetal foodstuffs, was brought into the village and its dwellings from without for distribution, preparation, and consumption. Likewise, just as the typical occasion for sexual intercourse between husband and wife was on the way back to the village after garden work (Landtman 1927: 68, 229, 249), the rite of coitus between a harpooner and his wife before a dugong expedition was performed on a path leading to the village, the partners returning home along this path with the wife carrying the sex-imbued leaves and harpoon- ing implements "in the same way as she holds her child" (Landtman 1927: 128). The pseudopar- turitional rite of passage following a head-hunting raid was staged along a path leading home from the raided village, the newly severed heads and newly "born" killers soon to be incorporated into the home village in further support of the community's internal vitality (cf. Riley 1925: 268; Landtman 1927: 163). In the hunting of animals, this pattern of transformative movement from "external" to Anthropos 91.1996 371 "internal" pertained not only to the geographic space of the village, but also to the somatic space of species difference. Wild animals that hunters killed and ate were doubly external, living not only beyond the conceptual and physical bound- aries of the village but also beyond the conceptual and physical boundaries of the human. Even in the racism of head-hunting, the model victims were inland-dwelling "bushmen" marginal to Kiwai standards of full humanity and individuation (e.g., Landtman 1917: 275 f., 391; 1927: 154, 249; Riley 1925: 149). The pig moguru ritual and the men's house were closely related to each other, and had special importance in this wider process of appropriating exogenous life to reproduce local communal vi- tality. The dwelling and the ritual were necessary to each other's full realization, moguru normally taking place in the men's house and completion of a new men's house requiring an inaugural moguru performance, as Marunogere understood (Landt- man 1927: 350). Construction of a men's house, like performance of the moguru ritual, involved physical incorporation of the preeminent anthro- pomorphic animal sign of strength and ferocity: Parts of the body of a wild boar are ... inserted in different places in the superstructure of a [men's] house. The four feet are put in the four corners of the house underneath the floor, the jaw is put under the threshold of the principal entrance, and the skull in the gable over the same entrance. The vertebrae are tied here and there along the ridge- spars, and ribs, fastened together in pairs, are hung over the spars, one pair at each end of the house and another at the centre. Between one of the longitudinal beams of the roof and the supporting pile the builders insert a strip of skin from the back of the boar. Another piece of pig-skin is wrapped round the midrib of the first slab of thatch, and the first layer of nipa leaves is stitched to that midrib with a small rib of a boar used as a needle; this piece of thatch is put on the centre of the house (Landtman 1927: 14 f.; cf. 1917: 116). Through this iconic reconstitution of the pig's dis- membered body, men effectively dwelled within the inner cavities of a gigantic boar, in eucharis- tie fashion incorporated within the body of their church even as they periodically incorporated their church's body within themselves. The house, like moguru performances staged within it, incited men to ferocity and killing, by virtue of the domestic ubiquity of not only the boar but also an extensive further array of indices of animal prédation, body parts of slain enemies, and potent bodily and domestic substances pilfered from other villages, all prescriptively included in its construction. The men's house stood within the village space as monumental testimony to the on- going accumulation of vanquished outsiders (e.g.,</page><page sequence="14">372 Landtman 1927: 17 f.), experienced by residents as a living imperative to appropriate heads, and impinging upon them from without. Among the tribesmen their darimo [men's house] represented a perpetual instigation to fight. "All time," so the natives say, "darimo he wake him up man, push him go. Man he no can sleep, something he jump inside, he think, 'I go fight, kill him bushman!"' Strangers visiting a darimo and remaining there some time ran a great risk of being killed by the people, who gradually became incited by the warlike associations of the house. The people say that they could not be blamed for killing visitors in a darimo, it was the house which compelled them to do so (Landtman 1927: 21). These statements describe for the experience of permanent dwelling space what I have earlier sought to indicate about the more occasional cor- poreal encounters of moguru. Ferocity, the im- perative to kill, and perhaps mortality itself were posed and experienced as forces alien to humanity, emanating from an augmentative superagen- cy brought into the human community (and into or around the human body) from without. In a parallel manner, perhaps, the belief that women's menstrual blood derived from the mortal blood of a slain pig (mixed with the blood of the foremother who died as an entailment of this pig's death) construed women as more the hosts than the agents of the human-reproductive processes that took place through their very bodies. While the men's house and moguru rite together constituted a central nexus in the collective media- tion of alienness across species lines (humanity as empowered, invaded, or constituted by qualities emanating from an external animal or architec- tural entity), they were simultaneously central to the mediation of human-internal alienness across lines of gender. With the notable exception of old women responsible for various tasks of ritual do- mesticity (e.g., cooking the moguru pig, or tending fires while men were away on raids), women and children could not normally enter a men's house, and were excluded both from participation in the pig moguru and from knowledge of the ritual's content (Landtman 1927: 8, 157, 359). The identity of the central object of the rite, the pig itself, was the paramount secret (Landtman 1927: 173, 358). Landtman records three narratives in which women learn that it is a pig that is at the center of the moguru, and in all three the breach leads to the extermination of the entire community at the hands of men from other villages disturbed by their neighbors' lapse, reversing the sought mor- tal relation between the internal community and its external others (Landtman 1917: 345-348). In one transgression narrative, the breach of secrecy Rupert Stasch is precipitated precisely by failure to use a wild pig from outside the village. Tired of searching unsuccessfully, the men use a domesticated pig instead, tying it up, painting it, and carrying it into the men's house. Not only were the few domesticated pigs tended primarily by women, but a woman domesticated a pig in the first place by mixing her own nail clippings, vaginal secretions, and other bodily residua into the animal's food (Landtman 1927: 443; cf. Wood 1974: 41). To use a domesticated pig in moguru would thus have been to use an animal that had been divested of its wild ferocity and toughness through nurturant bodily relations with women, for a mortal bodily encounter with the goal of investing men with that animal's original wild ferocity and toughness. In the narrative under consideration, the unsuitability of such a substitution is confirmed by the cata- strophic dénouement. On the morning after the moguru performance, the woman who owns the pig calls its name in order to feed the animal (thinking it has only wandered into the bush), and the still-living creature breaks free and runs out of the men's house in full view of all villagers. The men push all of the women and children into a deep hole and bury them, before being themselves attacked and killed, at their own behest, by men of neighboring villages. That the domesticated pig's inappropriateness rested in its association not only with women but with the local community as such (in contrast to association of feral pigs with forces beyond the community) is indicated by the fact that the proper name by which the owner fatefully summons her pig is also the village's name (Landt- man 1917: 345 f.). The narrative draws particularly direct attention to the ongoing link between the exteriority of the animal to which men assimilat- ed themselves and the exclusion of women from knowledge of this animal's identity. Original determination of the identity of the central object of the moguru rite is of course the definitive concern of the Marunogere myth. In the initial state, Marunogere' s people do not know what the correct object is. Only after two extended paradigmatic sequences of mistaken identifica- tion do they secure the creature that will make their moguru efficacious, enabling them to kill ^people in other villages. Exclusion of women in the ritual present recapitulated this initial state of ignorance, making possible the ongoing pas- sage of juniors (and through them, adult men at large) from ignorance to potency by providing the negative foil against which the truth of the pig's efficacy could be affirmed. "You come man now," initiates were told after they knew the secret of Anthropos 91.1996</page><page sequence="15">Killing as Reproductive Agency moguru' s content, "before you all same woman" (Landtman 1927: 358). In its sociological form, moguru secrecy, like menstrual and parturitional taboos on hunting, enforced a gender-mediated separation of the two parallel dimensions of the tie between humanity and the pig: the blood of sexual reproduction that passed from slaughtered pigs to living women, on the one hand, and the ca- pacity for fierce killing that passed from the pig's body (including its blood, but especially its head) to living men, on the other hand. Through this segregation, men, killing, ferocity, and mortality could appear as exogenous aspects of humanity relative to women's nonparticipation in the cult of the wild animal, just as women, childbearing, and the origin of menstrual blood in a slaughtered wild boar could appear as exogenous aspects of human- ity relative to men's nonparticipation in childbirth and menstruation. By associating the relationship between killing and reproduction with the rela- tionship between the two sexes, and by making the sexes mutually external to each other through secrecy and taboo, killing and reproduction were themselves, as aspects of humanity, separated and externalized. Yet the actual content of moguru secrecy belied this very sociological form: what exclusion from moguru (and exclusion from fa- miliarity with the Marunogere narrative) denied women was precisely the knowledge that their own menstrual blood was the blood of the wild pig that empowered men to kill, that boys passed into lethal manhood through a parturitional encounter with the mortality of a wild animal that was hu- manity's double, and that ritual diremption of the human community ultimately celebrated not the separation of mortality and reproduction, and their exteriority to humanness, but rather their unity and interiority. This idea that the alien boar was a covert rep- resentation of the interconnectedness of human reproduction and human mortality - and also that the "covert" or theriomorphic character of the rep- resentation was itself motivated by this same ap- parent interconnectedness - is supported indirectly by the fact that, apart from exogenous beings such as dugong, wild boars, and "bushmen," an old man and woman from within the local commu- nity, addressed as mother and father, were also occasionally designated to die for the sake of the ongoing vitality of younger generations, in connec- tion with both men's houses and moguru rituals. In an episode of prolific sexual intercourse carried out at intervals in association with performance of the pig moguru, an old husband and wife sexually initiated the cutting of the sago tree from which Anthropos 91.1996 373 a receptacle for collecting coital fluids would be made, and later initiated the cutting of the mature trees fertilized with the coital fluids (Landtman 1927: 351-356). The prosperity of the palms was attributed to the two, who were expected to pass away shortly after the trees had been harvested. An old couple was similarly selected to supervise the construction of any new men's house, sexually mediating the collection and incorporation of the many required elements. The house was completed "at the cost of its two real creators' lives" (Landt- man 1927: 10). They are expected to die shortly after the first captured heads have been brought into the new darimo [men's house]. When first selected for the undertaking they did not show any signs of sorrow, but at the completion of the house they rub themselves with mud and weep, "Close up me finish now, me two fellow die." They are not killed, and the actual cause of their death is not clear to the people, but there seems to be an understanding that the endowment of the house with its various magical properties has consumed their vitality. In the same way Marunogere died after having built the first darimo (Landtman 1927: 22). Indeed, in the same way that the moguru pig and Marunogere himself were by some accounts killed against Marunogere' s will by his own son (Landtman 1917: 342), the old man and woman were recruited to their roles in renewal of sago fer- tility or construction of a men's house not by their own consent but by the remorseful consent of their eldest son (Landtman 1927: 10, 356), reversing the emphasis placed in other contexts on generation of strong sons through the hunting exploits of fathers (e.g., Landtman 1927: 248 f.; Riley 1925: 49, 266). The uniqueness of the elder couple as endogenous victims, and the uniqueness of the "old darimo women" who entered men's houses freely and knew about the use of boars in moguru performances, perhaps rested in their postreproductive condi- tion. In the cult of the pig, the focal human participants were children and adults immediately and individually implicated in the ongoing sexual reproduction of living human bodies, and the mortal and reproductive aspects of humanity were ambig- uously held apart by species difference, menstrual and parturitional prohibitions, and secrecy. In the elders' death, by contrast, the close connection be- tween mortal and reproductive aspects of human- ity was a matter of publicly perceptible asymme- tries of age and corporeal periodicity, the elders themselves the vehicles of collective recognition that success in external life-furthering projects was achieved on the condition of mortality and oedi- pal succession within the local community's own being. Designated postreproductive women might know the content of moguru because their bodies</page><page sequence="16">374 were no longer imbued with the very capacity for childbirth that it was the clandestine business of moguru to appropriate, animalize, and interpret - one more indication that women were associated with "reproduction" not absolutely but aspectually (cf. Meigs 1976). Yet even in the old couple's pass- ing, unity of death and reproduction was mediated by the intentionalistic implications of the elders being consciously "killed" (albeit without physical violence) by and for their own son and the wider community of juniors. Likewise, the Marunogere narrative claims that human mortality and human reproduction were together brought about through a human act, the killing of a certain first pig who was the animal double of his human creator. From the perspective of this narrative, it is through the ongoing reiteration of the intentionalistic act of killing such an animal being, at once self and not-self, that one's own mortal condition can be transformed into new human life. 4. Conclusion: Killing as Reproductive Agency While Kiwai, like other hunting peoples, clearly countenanced in their own particular theology of action what Brightman (n.d.) felicitously char- acterizes as a "metaphysical antipathy" between hunting and procreation, it is also apparent that this antipathy coexisted with an equally pervasive sense of metaphysical affinity. Menstrual and parturi- tional restrictions related to hunting are among the starkest formulations of "antipathy" touched upon in this paper, but, as Brightman argues compara- tively, the sexual division of labor itself (it tends to be men who are taught, equipped, and warranted to hunt and kill animals, particularly when the prey have large bodies or the hunting technique involves flesh-penetrating projectiles and visible bloodshed; cf. Testait 1986a, 1986t; Tabet 1979; Estioko-Griffin and Griffin 1981) must be under- stood as in part a manifestation of this same cul- turally constructed metaphysical antipathy. Divi- sions of ritual, spatial, and epistemological labor attested in the Kiwai situation, such as exclu- sion of women from male initiation practices, resi- dential segregation of adolescent boys from their mothers, and deception of women concerning the content of hunting-related rituals and narratives, present further variations on the antithesis, fun- damentally continuous with the division of labor in its technology-centered form. A simultaneous metaphysics of "affinity" or "attraction" between hunting and procreation, on the other hand, has Rupert Stasch been evident in sexualization of harpooner-dugong relations and the strong influence of wives on hunting success, in representations of hunter-prey interaction as a filial encounter, in use of par- turitional forms for hunting-related male rites of passage, and in identification of hunting blood with reproductive blood. Indeed, even prototypical expressions of antipathy between procreation and killing, such as menstrual and parturitional taboos or the sexual division of labor in its categorial aspect, also imply some degree of covert construal of procreation and killing as like each other. Any representation of childbirth and killing as mutually exclusive activities (whether a relatively passive, socialization-driven trend in allocation of labor or a rigorously sanctioned rule of separation), directly suppressing the idea that childbirth is comparable to killing, covertly presupposes the very similitude and parallelism that it overtly denies (cf. Hyppoli- te 1988). In taboo and allied phenomena, affinity and antipathy are symbiotic, each presupposing the other and providing the other's necessary ground (cf. Valeri 1990: 247 f.). The salience of this relation of antithetic unity between hunting and procreation in the compar- ative ethnographic and ethnohistorical record is well known, even as this same record discloses a dauntingly complex range of constructions of the theme (see Rosaldo and Atkinson 1975; Testart 1986¿r, Brightman n.d.; and citations in those es- says). Among attested forms of "attraction" or "af- finity" between procreation and hunting are: eroti- cization of hunter-prey relations (e.g., Brightman 1993: 195 f.; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971: 218-225), wives' roles in attracting animal prey and fulfill- ing postmortem obligations to them (e.g., Boden- horn 1990; Fienup-Riordan 1994: 88-142), central place given to meat in constructing and sustaining events of marriage, childbirth, and initiation (e.g., Atkinson 1990: 70-72; Biesele 1993: 1 f.; Gillison 1993: 38; Kelly 1974: 220; Lee 1979: 240-242; Collier and Rosaldo 1981), ritual and mythical rep- resentations of hunting as fertility-promoting (e.g., Heusch 1982: 144-170; Friedberg 1980; Geirnaert 1987), and use of menstrual or parturitional forms in male hunting rites of passage, or other gener- al parallelisms between hunting and menarche or childbearing (Fienup-Riordan 1994: 163, 249 f., 266-298; Overing 1986: 143-150). "Antipathy," on the other hand, is most easily discerned in diverse beliefs and rules surrounding incompati- bility between hunting and menstruation or hunt- ing and parturition (e.g., Biesele 1993: 92 f.; Boas 1901: 120 f.; Brightman 1993: 124-132; Rasmus- sen 1931: 66, 166, 173, 258-262; Valeri 1990; Anthropos 91.1996</page><page sequence="17">Killing as Reproductive Agency citations in Frazer 1935: 156-223). What is per- haps most comparatively striking, and what I hope to have demonstrated clearly for Kiwai representa- tions, is the consistency with which the antipathies and attractions tend to be asymmetrically ordered. Representations of hunting as a kind of procreative or fertility-promoting activity are relatively abun- dant, while representations of childbearing as a hunting-like activity are relatively scarce, or even actively suppressed (Rosaldo and Atkinson 1975). Men in hunting big game accrue to themselves something of the form and significance of the childbearing actions to which they are otherwise relatively marginal, while women in their child- bearing aspect are denied comparable participation in the form and significance of killing.4 While the technology-based sexual division of hunting labor "recreates and reverses" the asymmetric division of procreative labor (only women bear children) by restricting women to a marginal or ancillary position in the most socially valorized of food- producing activities, with acute political causes and consequences (Brightman n.d.), the asymmet- ric metaphysics underwriting and emerging from this technological division goes still further in a wider field of representations by claiming that through their hunting men are not ancillary but in fact uniquely proximate to eminently "reproduc- tive" forms of action - even as women's procreative actions remain not just ancillary but even danger- ous to the hunting project. Rosaldo and Atkinson (1975) offer an interpre- tation of how it is that such asymmetry might so persistently exist within and across societies widely dispersed in time and space. They suggest that the essential kernel of the opposition between male killing and female childbirth is a contrast in the kind or degree of self-determination inhering in each of the two kinds of bodily acts: "the critical difference between giving and taking life is rooted in the fact that a man's killing is always an act of will, directed towards a body other than his own; giving life through childbirth, on the other hand, is a natural function of a woman's own body, and usually is something over which she has little intentional control" (Rosaldo and Atkinson 375 1975: 70; emphasis added). By way of drawing out what is most insightful about this interpretation, it is worth taking at least brief notice of certain potential commonalities that may bring killing and childbearing into conjunction and opposition in the first place (whereas to Rosaldo and Atkin- son any given association or lack of association between killing and childbearing would not seem to be particularly motivated except as a matter of metaphor or its absence). First, as Testart (1986&lt;2, 1986Z?) has discussed, hunting, menstruation, and childbirth all involve flow of blood. However, all of the complex permutations of the relationship between blood of killing and different kinds of reproductive blood cannot be satisfactorily reduced to a single generic ideological imperative to avoid the accumulation of similarity by preventing any and all flowing blood from coming into contact with more of itself (cf. Valeri 1990: 247 f.). In any given cultural context, for example, what is the particular significance of even the very gross fact that the flow of menstrual blood tends to be repre- sented and conceived as involuntary while the flow of hunting blood is the immediate consequence of some person's intentional action, or the fact that menstrual blood flows from the human subject's own body while hunting blood flows from the body of an animal upon which the human subject has acted (Valeri 1994«: 93)? The substance alone is not sufficient to account for the meanings that it may bear, but must be considered in relation to the bodies through and from which it flows, and in relation to conditions of bodily animacy that dif- ferent kinds of flow complexly index, as different kinds of breaches in the integrity of the bleeder's bodily existence (cf. Ortega y Gasset 1972: 105; Testait 1986«: 38). Shedding of blood is a point of concrete and substantialized continuity between killing and reproduction within a broader spectrum of body-based similarities and differences. The broader background of continuity between hunting and reproduction does find elliptical re- cognition in Rosaldo and Atkinson's (and others') glosses of hunting and childbearing as (respec- tively) forms of "life-taking" and "life-giving." These glosses are somewhat imprecise (see Testart 1986a: 25 f. against the regrettable oversimplifi- cations of Sanday 1981: 89 f., in what is none- theless probably a too hasty discounting of the issues such labels could evoke). Given frequent conceptualization of hunting as a social engage- ment, to refer to killing as "life-taking" assumes what is an unduly anthropocentric perspective on the event, foregrounding the killer's side of the hunter-prey encounter, to the neglect of the prey's 4 For some potentially exceptional (if somewhat oblique) examples of situations in which feminine menstruation and childbearing may indeed be represented as like hunt- ing and killing, or as having a positive relation to hunt- ing and killing, consider Barnes 1992: 39-41; Barton 1930: 169; Fienup-Riordan 1994: 90, 94-107, 180-183, 251-252; Overing 1986: 147-149; Vernant 1991; and Wil- son 1928: 168 f., commented on by Lévi-Strauss 1962a: 69 -71). Anthropos 91.1996</page><page sequence="18">376 side (as represented in particular cultural contexts) and to the neglect of the further human relations also implicated in the hunter-prey dyad. Life that the hunter "takes" is very often conceived to be in some sense "given" (voluntarily, unwittingly, coercively, . . .) by the animal itself or by some superordinate entity with power over the hunt, and is further given, through the mediation of the hunter, to other humans and to humanity at large. Conversely, while Rosaldo and Atkinson describe childbirth as "life-giving" (cf. Bataille 1988: 35), is not an infant's bodily existence in some sense "taken," or at least "received," from its parents, especially its mother? The real possibility of death in childbirth is perhaps only the most extreme face of this more general presence. Giving and taking of bodily life are typically construed and experienced as not simply opposites but mutually indexical correlates (cf. Testait 1986a: 26; Bright- man 1993: 129). This is not to suggest that precise contextu- al differences between hunting and childbearing are mere illusions. Both activities involve forms of bodily penetration, and this shared asymmetry is one important element in understanding why the perennial "underequipment" (Tabet 1979) of women so often revolves around denying them access to flesh-penetrating weaponry, but concrete differences between sexual penetration and mortal penetration - such as the grossly schematic fact that, in its reproductive aspect, sexual penetration normally leads not to dissipation of the penetrated body's animacy (and subsequent dismemberment and ingestion of the de-animated body) but rath- er to the eventual externalization of an other, newly animate body - are equally important. As a comparative hypothesis, I suggest that a core nexus of similarity and difference in the relation- ship between hunting and childbearing resides in the circumstance that while both activities in- volve a transformation between the existence of two animate bodies (plurality) and the existence of one animate body (unity), from the perspective of an acting subject, childbearing, which proceeds in the direction of from one body to two, with no species level disparity between the two bodies, is in this sense less mediated, such that the presence of mortality in childbearing is threatening to the subject in a way that the presence of procreation in hunting is not. A mother is irreducibly proximate to childbirth, because the event of externalizing a nascent living human other occurs through, as Rosaldo and At- kinson note, her own body. A hunter, by contrast, acts upon the body of another being, killing an Rupert Stasch animal whose body (and flesh) is doubly distinct from his own, in both an individual and species sense. This point of contrast has important im- plications if conjoined with something like the Hegelian interpretation of sacrifice articulated by Bataille (1955, 1990), according to which intense identification of human killers with their animal victims allows them to experience their own mor- tality in these animals' deaths. Self-consciousness presupposes consciousness of the subject's own negation, yet subjects can have no direct experi- ence of their own deaths. It is in the representa- tional "subterfuge" (Bataille 1955: 32 f.) of iden- tifying with the animals they kill that subjects can experience the negation of their own animal and mortal aspects, introjecting "death" as a meaning- ful concept. Such, at any rate, seems consistent with the perplexing regularity with which Kiwai rites of passage construe killing as a form of parturition, achieved through ritual and narrative identification of the human killers with the killed prey: hunting is a more-than-metaphoric modality of sexually reproductive agency in that it con- tributes to the socialization of children into fully human autonomy and fully human sexual identity by giving them self-consciousness of life vis-à- vis death and self-consciousness of humanness vis-à-vis animality, and by differentiating gender- ed categories of actors and investing them with specialized agentive qualities. As for actual child- birth, it might be supposed that here, too, subjects experience something of their own deaths. But if the hunter creates himself and his humanity in the subterfuge of sacrificing the life of his displaced animal self, in childbirth there is little subterfuge. The mother's creation constitutes the beginnings of another bodily self from within her own bodily self, violently breaching the boundaries of both the creating and created subject and underlining embodiment as something over which the bounded human subject exercises only relatively limited ex post facto determination. Against this, the Ki- wai narrative of Marunogere proposes that even women's reproductive anatomy and reproductive physiology originate in and with the killing agency of men. To represent the ongoing killing of animals as a parturition-like mode of male reproductivity similarly asserts that parturition (and the condition of embodiment more generally) can be created and mastered by acting upon another's body. However, in representations of the opposite sort, in which the bearing of children is construed as similar to the killing of human-sized animals, it is the animal prey's total loss of bodily self-determination - rather than the hunter's ability to act upon the Anthropos 91.1996</page><page sequence="19">Killing as Reproductive Agency animal body - that perhaps dominates the compar- ison, ultimately construing birth (for parent or for child) as even more like being killed than it already is. Such representations are not only scarce, they are actively denied (but also presupposed in the course of their denial) by the categorial separations institutionalized in ritual secrecy, parturitional and menstrual taboos, and the sexual division of hunt- ing labor, all of which seek to keep the activity of killing animals and the activity of bearing children separate by keeping them from being predicated of the same category of subjects. I have sought to suggest that the mediation of an animal signifier and its death is instrumental to the achievement of this politically-loaded "slippage" from act to actor, even as it is in these same animal signs that the would-be separation of mortal and re- productive acts constantly undermines itself. The killing of large anthropomorphic animals was in itself powerfully constitutive of the experience of being human - that is, being Kiwai - in the period considered, not just because these animals were the concrete embodiment of a species concept in opposition to which a comparable concept of the human could be formed, but because killing was a hierarchical act of transformative negation, suited to the formation of a concept of the human itself divided into male and female aspects and itself lacerated by mortality and reproduction.
