<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vigiliae Christianae 43 (1989), 248-281, E. J. Brill, Leiden QUOSDAM PLATONICORUM LIBROS THE PLATONIC READINGS OF AUGUSTINE IN MILAN * BY PIER FRANCO BEATRICE 1. Plotinus or Porphyry? More than a century has elapsed since M. N. Bouillet tried to identify the Neoplatonic books read by Augustine in Milan immediately before his conversion, in the summer of 386.' Today one no longer discusses the problem-which has been shown a false problem-whether Augustine converted to Neoplatonism, as Alfaric supposed,2 or to the Catholic faith of Monica, as Boyer main- tained,3 and no one dares anymore to question the authenticity of Augustine's Christian conversion.4 Notwithstanding this, the literary problem about the Neoplatonic works which, as Augustine himself tells in the Confessions, he had in hand in Milan, has remained still unresolved: procurasti mihi... quosdam Platonicorum libros ex graeca lingua in latinam versos.' One can, for convenience, distinguish three interpretations upheld by the numerous scholars who have toiled over this enigma. A first group of erudites, the most compact and certainly the majority, have opted for the Enneads by Plotinus. It will be sufficient here to remember the names of Grandgeorge,6 Alfaric,7 Norregaard,8 Henry,9 Testard,'1 Hadot," O'Connell," all convinced asserters of the exclusive or preponderant Plotinian influence, only to be divided afterwards about the number and titles of the Plotinian treatises read by Augustine and effectively utilized by him. A position with more nuance, which leaves space for Porphyry too next to Plotinus, was maintained for a long time by Pierre Courcelle,'3 who with his numerous works has exercised a profound influence on the research of the last decades, specially the one in the French language.'4 This opinion, generally widespread, was however disputed by Willy Theiler, who identified the Platonic books as the exclusive work of Por- phyry,'5 the disciple of Plotinus who edited and commented on the</page><page sequence="2">QUOSDAM PLATONICORUM LIBROS Enneads; '6 and according to John J. O'Meara, Augustine would have read only Porphyry's Philosophy from Oracles! 17 In the midst of so much uncertainty and variety of scientific opinions, it does not appear presumptuous to try to reexamine the issue. Without claiming to reach some apodeictic conclusions, it seems reasonable and above all useful to illustrate the considerations related to the method to put into practice. Two things have to be stated at the beginning of the analysis and borne in mind as we continue. First of all, with the term Platonici Augustine meant to designate a precise group of thinkers, followers of Plato, but chronologically nearer to his time (recentiores), that is, three Greeks: Plotinus, Iamblichus and Porphyry, and a bilingual African like Apuleius.18 Only among these philosophers could one seek the author or the authors of the books read by Augustine in Milan. Iamblichus, however, is to be excluded from the beginning, since Augustine, not mentioning him elsewhere, shows that he is not acquainted with him, and we can therefore be sure that he had never read any of his works. On the contrary, his compatriot Apuleius of Madauros, whom Augustine knew very well, cannot be considered among the authors of the libri platonicorum for the obvious reason that-and this is the second basic principle of our research-these are Greek books translated into Latin by Marius Victorinus, the famous African rhetorician converted in old age to Christianity.'9 By exclusion, the only possible authors remaining are Plotinus and Porphyry! As a first conclusion, one must say that all of the Neoplatonic philosophical material, used in the writings of Augustine in the course of his extensive literary activity in Latin translation, was a part of the libri platonicorum and that in these books Augustine found all those texts with which he compared his Christian thought for his whole lifetime. Up to here no particularly serious difficulties have come out. The problem becomes more complicated when one goes on to the analysis of the contents of these Neoplatonic works by Plotinus and Porphyry translated into Latin, and when one tries to discover their exact title. From a methodological point of view, two different types of approach have been adopted. Several scholars have committed them- selves to the research of indirect citations, of wordcastings, of allusions, of Plotinian and/or Porphyrian reminiscences eventually present in the 249</page><page sequence="3">PIER FRANCO BEATRICE youthful writings of Augustine preceding the Confessions, to evidence the Neoplatonic sources which inspired him in his early years of activity.20 Following an even longer and problematic path, Theiler theorized, in his famous Arbeitssatz, that all those doctrines found both in the postplotinian Neoplatonists and in Augustine, but not equally present in Plotinus, are to be considered to be of Porphyrian origin.21 But it is easily understood that in this way, side by side with particular observations of great value, one runs the risk of seeing something that does not exist and of giving free rein to fantasy. The textual and doc- trinal comparisons between the youthful works of Augustine and the Neoplatonic literature, unless strikingly evident, do not lead to anything but to an insurmountable uncertainty and to the consequent uncon- trolled multiplication of more or less probable hypotheses. In facing an exceptional personality, as that of Augustine, who reads, and in rethinking them, transforms and adapts his Neoplatonic sources to such a point as to render them unrecognizable, we consider it wise to refer exclusively to the direct citations of Plotinus and Porphyry scat- tered throughout his complete works. We do not consider illegitimate, then, to project the result so obtained onto the libriplatonicorum of the Confessions and from there onto the writings of the first period (386/97). 2. The quotations of Plotinus. The formal and direct witness of Augustine leads one to consider that the impression which most affected his mind was exercised by some writings by Plotinus: Lectis autem Plotini paucissimis libris... sic exarsi, ut omnes illas vellem anchoras rumpere....22 The same experience was described in analogous terms in Contra Academicos II, 2, 5, where Augustine speaks of the incredible conflagration caused in him by some libri quidam pleni, which emit the perfumes of Arabia and distil pretiosissimi unguenti guttaspaucissimas: evidently Augustine was deal- ing with the same books by Plotinus with which he must have been becoming acquainted, even if in a fragmentary manner.23 Moreover, Augustine does not refrain from praising Plotinus in the writings of the same period: for him Plotinus is the reincarnation of Plato himself;24 he compares his own thought about God with Plato and Plotinus;25 his language is so saturated with Neoplatonism that, 250</page><page sequence="4">QUOSDAM PLATONICORUM LIBROS according to Nebridius, his letters resound with Christ, Plato and Plotinus.26 The important and numerous citations of the Enneads, concentrated mainly in Books IX and X of De Civitate Dei, testify to the great influ- ence exercized on Augustine, still quite a number of years later, by the Plotinian readings of the period spent in Milan. To dwell on literally cited texts, Augustine certainly read the following passages of the Enneads among the libri platonicorum: 1) Enneads I, 2, 3 (On Virtues);27 2) I, 4, 7 (On Happiness); 28 3) I, 6, 7 (On Beauty);29 4) I, 6, 8;3? 5) I, 8, 13 (On the Origin of Evils); 3' 6) III, 2, 13 (On Providence); 32 7) III, 4, 2 (On Personal Demon); 33 8) IV, 3, 12 (On the Soul); 34 9) V, 1 (On the Three Basic Hypostases); 35 10) V, 1, 10.36 This catalogue of citations constitutes the secure basis on which to develop a wider differentiation of hypotheses and conjectures about the use of the Enneads by Augustine.37 Expressions like the following: Saepe multumque Plotinus asserit, sensum Platonis explanans..., make one think that the Plotinian texts at Augustine's disposition were in reality numerous enough and that, because of the enormous impression that they had on Augustine's mind at the vigil of his conversion to Catholicism, contributed in a decisive manner to his detachment from Manichaean materialism and dualism. We should then be able to retrace significant tracks of them in the telling of the Confessions concerning the libri platonicorum. In effect, the summary and approximative description of these books contained in Conf. VII, 9, 13-1438 shows clearly that Augustine was almost thunder-struck by the Plotinian doctrine of the three hypostases, which he assimilated to the Christian Trinity according to the actual for- mulation of the prologue of John, and by the statement-also contained in the Plotinian treatise on the three basic hypostases, Ennead V, 1- that the soul should not be identified with the light by which it was created, that is, with the Word himself.39 Here, as later in De Civ. Dei 251</page><page sequence="5">PIER FRANCO BEATRICE X, 2, the Plotinian theory of the Intellect is harmonized with the pro- logue of the gospel of John (consonans evangelio),40 according to an hermeneutic procedure which had already found supporters in the same Neoplatonic tradition, from Amelius 4 to the unknown Platonicus men- tioned by Simplicianus.42 Obviously, in these books Augustine could not find (non ibi legi) the annunciation of the typically Christian doctrine of the Incarnation of the Word and of His kenosis up to the death on the Cross.43 In any case, nothing authorizes us to think that Augustine had at hand a complete edition of the Enneads translated into Latin by Marius Victorinus. The Plotinian citations, surely numerous and important, all seem to be conveyed through other works, precisely the libri platonicorum, in which they were set like precious fragments of the Greek wisdom in substantial agreement with the Christian faith. In fact, there are other aspects of the libri platonicorum described by Augustine that, in order to be explained, demand that one refers not only to the Enneads, but to different works and authors. I want to say that the idolatry present in these Neoplatonic books, at least according to Augustine,44 is not found in the Plotinian tracts, which just very soberly reutilize the terminology of Isis' mysteries in a philosophical key.45 At this point it is necessary to bring in Porphyry, the other author certainly read by Augustine in Latin translation. 3. Porphyry and idolatry According to Augustine, Neoplatonists succeeded in reaching the natural knowledge of God, which is certainly to be ascribed to their merit. However, instead of offering God the true worship, they foolishly fell into idolatry because of their intellectual pride, just like the pagans mentioned by Paul in Romans 1, 21-25.46 In the libri platonicorum Augustine found that the glory of the incor- ruptibility of God had been changed by these philosophers in idola et varia simulacra. There are two types of idolatrous statues built to meet the characteristics of pagan religion: statues with the appearance of human beings (in similitudinem imaginis corruptibilis hominis) and those ones with the appearance of animals, still more degraded, accord- ing to the typical zoolatry of Egyptian religion (et volucrum et quadrupedum et serpentium, videlicet Aegyptium cibum).47 It is true that in this context Augustine regards the biblical symbolism 252</page><page sequence="6">QUOSDAM PLATONICORUM LIBROS of Egypt as the cause of the idolatry of the Chosen People, the firstborn who loses his rights in favour of the Church originating from the Gen- tiles. The same thing happened to Esau, who lost his primogeniture in favour of Jacob, the former having eaten lentils, Egyptian food par excellence and the symbol of idolatry itself.48 However, Augustine's discourse on Egyptian statues is not just a generical condemnation of the pride, the so-called "Self-idolatry" of the Neoplatonists.49 The literal value of the text is to be defended in all its documentary importance. Friederich W6rter50 and, later on, Etienne Gilsons'-the latter with no connection to the former at all-have suggested we should refer the Augustinian information in Conf. VII, 9, 15 to some passages of Por- phyry's De abstinentia, where the Neoplatonic philosopher actually deals with Egyptian zoolatry and the statues resembling animals erected by the Egyptians to worship their gods.52 The affinity considered is certainly striking and should be taken into account. Unfortunately, there is no evidence at all of any translation into Latin of the De abstinentia by Marius Victorinus which could have been read and understood by Augustine! Thus, without a priori excluding these highly significant comparisons, we think we have to resort to other Porphyrian texts which, as far as we know, have not yet been utilized in the proper way within the scope of our research. In the fragments of a work published by Bidez with the title nhep &amp;ayaXp,aov (On the statues of the gods),53 Porphyry enlarges on the explanation of the allegorical meaning of the statues of Greek and Egyptian gods, respectively reproducing human and animal forms.54 This distinction exactly corresponds to the one made by Augustine in Conf. VII, 9, 15, on the basis of Rom. 1, 21 ff., and in other texts, such as Sermo 197, 1 55 and Sermo 241, 3.56 Moreover, we can be sure that Augustine knew this work in its Latin translation because in De Civ. Dei VII, 25 he took up again from it the Porphyrian interpretation of Attis's castration, which becomes the symbol of flowers falling before yielding their fruits.57 Also the etymology of the name of the goddess Hera is probably drawn by Augustine from the same work.58 On the whole, we can assume that whenever Augustine polemizes against the pagan inter- pretation of the simulacra, he has exactly these Porphyrian texts in mind.59 One should therefore conclude that Augustine found a Latin transla- tion of Porphyry's treatise On the statues of the gods among the libri 253</page><page sequence="7">PIER FRANCO BEATRICE platonicorum. However, Eusebius of Caesarea who, in Book III of the Praeparatio evangelica, includes the Porphyrian fragments in question, says that he has drawn them from a work entitled Philosophy from Oracles.60 It is important to note that Eusebius criticizes the Porphyrian inter- pretation of pagan statues basing himself upon the authority of Rom. 1, 21 ff., the same Pauline text Augustine often invoked in the context of his anti-idolatrous polemics.6' This seems to us a relevant argument in favour of the identity of the Porphyrian work criticized by Eusebius with the one criticized by Augustine. Consequently, the whole question gathers around the Augustinian quotations from the Philosophy from Oracles, the important work of Porphyry which, unfortunately, has almost completely been lost. 4. Porphyry's "Philosophy from Oracles" in Augustine Only once does Augustine transcribe the original Greek title of this work: Nam in libris quos ix Xoyiov cqXtoaocpoc appellat (Porphyrius), in quibus exequitur adque conscribit rerum ad philosophiam pertinentium velut divina responsa, ut ipsa verba eius, quem ad modum ex Graeca lingua in Latinam interpretata sunt, ponam... Deinde post hos versus Apollinis, qui non stante metro Latine interpretati sunt, subiunxit adque ait... .62 The information is important, since it allows us to understand that in this work Porphyry dealt with philosophical subjects, mixing them with oracular texts. Therefore, this would be the pudibunda disputatio where, according to Augustine, Porphyry is wavering between the vitium sacrilegae curiositatis, which is connected with the exercise of theurgical practices, and the philosophiae professio under the inspira- tion of Plotinus.63 Eusebius of Caesarea gives us identical evidence when he asserts that recent philosophers like Porphyry mingle (aunX,eXat) the good and truthful Platonic philosophy with the theology of the Ancients.64 More- over, Porphyry himself, in his introduction to the Philosophy from Oracles, assures that his collection of oracles will contain the exposition of many philosophical doctrines (7oXXOv ,L?v Tiv xaCxa ptXoaopav 8oyLea0Tov &amp;avapalpOiv) as well as a limited use of the oracles (i' 6Xtyov be xal Tig Xp7:T&amp;x7 a46tiO0a TpaylxaT?oas).65 Yet, Porphyry adds that the 254</page><page sequence="8">QUOSDAM PLATONICORUM LIBROS purpose of his collection is to help those who suffer in their search for truth and soul's salvation.66 If Porphyry's Philosophy from Oracles is characterized by these specific connotations, then it can be admitted that this work is present in all the contexts where Augustine refers to Porphyry's use of oracles, though it is not mentioned directly, as for example: De cons. evang. I, 15, 23;67 De Civ. Dei X, 23; 68 X, 27; 69 X, 32; 70 XVIII, 53, 2; 71 XIX, 22-23; 72 XX, 24;73 XXII, 25.74 Moreover, the wealth of philosophical materials in this work makes it plausible to think that through it Augustine came in contact with wide fragments of Greek philosophical works, especially by Plato75-apart from what he already knew from other Latin translations76-and Plotinus.77 At least twice does Augustine directly compare Plotinus's thought with that of Porphyry, as if he had a Porphyrian work at hand, which reproduced Plotinus's point of view about the three principal hypostases and the metempsychosis in order to modify it: Postponit quippe Plotinus animae naturam paterno intellectui, iste autem (scil. Porphyrius) cum dicit medium, non postponit sed interponit; 78 and with regard to the metempsychosis: Nam Platonem animas hominum post mortem revolvi usque ad corpora bestiarum scripsisse certissimum est. Hanc sententiam Porphyrii doctor tenuit et Plotinus; Porphyrio tamen iure displicuit.79 This is not surprising if we consider that also Aeneas of Gaza, at the end of the fifth century, records how Porphyry, in the Philosophy from Oracles, interpreted the Plotinian Ennead On the origin of evils (I, 8) to maintain that matter is not an ungenerated principle.80 Finally, the religious purpose of the Philosophy from Oracles explains the attention given to it by Augustine when he dealt with the problems of man's salvation and the mediation between God and man. If to all that we add the fundamental remark that exactly this work of Porphyry was available to Augustine in a Latin translation,8' we cannot but conclude that precisely the Philosophy from Oracles, and no other work, was read by Augustine in Milan in the Latin translation by Marius Victorinus, and through this work he came to know the passages of the Enneads upon which he was to meditate all his life. In this way it is possible to see the substantial correctness of O'Meara's hypothesis, according to which the libri de regressu animae, 255</page><page sequence="9">PIER FRANCO BEATRICE from which Augustine says he very often drew quotations,82 should be identified with the Philosophy from Oracles or a part of it, and, there- fore, they would not be an independent work with this title.83 Yet, if all the Porphyrian texts known and utilized by Augustine in Marius Victorinus's Latin version are to be attributed to the Philosophy from Oracles exclusively, it is inevitable to conclude that also Por- phyry's letter to Anebo must somehow have been connected with the Philosophy from Oracles: it is no chance that this letter is mentioned in De Civ. Dei X, 11 in the midst of the discussion of the Philosophy from Oracles! Another still more complex and ticklish question is that of the Augustinian quotations of some passages from the Latin translation of the Hermetic treatise Asclepius in De Civ.Dei VIII, 23 ff. Nowadays, it is commonly agreed that this Latin translation dates back to the middle of the fourth century and it was written by a learned pagan of African origin.84 We wonder how this translation came into Augustine's posses- sion, and why it is mentioned in the context of the uncompromising anti-Platonic polemics of De Civ.Dei VIII-X. Some considerations would lead us to think that also the Asclepius was in some way included in the Latin translation of the libri platonicorum which we have previously identified with Porphyry's Philosophy from Oracles. Augustine intends to quote the words uttered by the Egyptian Hermes called Trismegistus, in the Latin version he knew: Nam diversa de illis Hermes Aegyptius, quem Trismegiston vocant, sensit et scripsit... Huius Aegyptii verba, sicut in nostram linguam interpretata sunt, ponam... .85 It is important to note that Porphyry certainly was acquainted with the A6oyos TSXXto, the original Greek text of the Asclepius, dating back to about the middle of the third century.86 In this way the deep affinities can be explained, which link the Neoplatonic thinker to the Hermetic treatise on the themes of the theurgical cult of the statues of the Egyp- tian gods87 and the spiritual cult which resolves in vegetarianism.88 Moreover, the prophecy of the Asclepius, where the author reproves the fact that the Christian cult of the martyrs will eventually overcome the ancient idolatrous cult practised in the Egyptian temples,89 could not escape such a controversialist as Porphyry, the sagacious collector of anti-Christian oracles.90 Anyway, Augustine himself points out the fact that the Hermetic tract Asclepius belongs to the spiritual world of idolatrous 256</page><page sequence="10">QUOSDAM PLATONICORUM LIBROS Neoplatonism, when he writes that: Erat enim de his, de quibus dicit Apostolus, quod... (the quotation from Rom. 1, 21-22 follows), directly reconnecting Asclepius with the libri platonicorum mentioned in Conf. VII, 9, 14-15.91 With all the due caution in such intricate questions, it seems to us that it is not excessively imprudent to affirm that through the Philosophy from Oracles, translated into Latin by Marius Victorinus, Augustine acquired that knowledge of Neoplatonic and Hermetic literature which he then displayed in De Civ.Dei. In short, we think that all the Por- phyrian fragments de regressu animae, the fragments on the statues of the gods and the letter to Anebo have to be linked to the Philosophy from Oracles. We also think that, through the Philosophy from Oracles, Augustine came to know Porphyry's religious thought and then, thanks to him, he discovered wide fragments of the philosophical and religious literature of the Greeks, from Plato to Plotinus and Hermes Trismegistus, all of them being highly considered by Porphyry. What we are asserting is confirmed by this parenthetical remark, which is often misunderstood: per quendam hominem immanissimo typho turgidum.92 We must obviously exclude certain explanations which would identify the mysterious person with some Neoplatonist of the Milanese circle93 or even with Manlius Theodorus, who would have actually handed the Platonic books to Augustine!94 The general mean- ing of the passage is that the grace of God did turn even pagan works, such as the libri platonicorum, whose author distinguished himself for his exceptional intellectual pride and his adherence to idolatry, into spiritual nourishment for Augustine's salvation. According to common knowledge of that time, pride (u~PoS;) is characteristic of Platonic philosophers.95 In this particular context, typhus stands for the haughty and contemptuous attitude assumed by Porphyry in the Philosophy from Oracles, as can be seen through the illuminating comparison with an information given by Eusebius of Caesarea. In the latter's opinion T6cpo and &amp;aXaovoia characterize the method of the cpuatoXoyta used by Porphyry in the Philosophy from Oracles: this method consisted of a mixture of Platonic philosophy and the theurgical religiousness of the oracles.96 We can therefore conclude that Porphyry was the real "mediator" or "conveyer" of Neoplatonic philosophy from Plotinus to Augustine and that he was the author of the books which conveyed that philosophy.97 257</page><page sequence="11">PIER FRANCO BEATRICE 5. The anti-Christian polemics in the "Philosophy from Oracles" Two further questions are: why did Augustine not mention Por- phyry's name in the Confessions? and, if he really read the Philosophy from Oracles in the summer of 386, why then did he wait fourteen years before openly mentioning him and quoting his books in De consensu evangelistarum, which dates back to 400? 98 These questions represent the most delicate, but also the crucial point to understand the intellectual experience which preceded and in some way produced Augustine's conversion. One answer to these disturbing questions could be that the Philoso- phy from Oracles was generally known to be too imbued with elements of anti-Christian polemics to allow Augustine to declare openly that he had been deeply influenced by it in his conversion to Catholicism! This fact would have cast a dangerous shadow of serious discredit on his public image of a neo-converted and then a presbyter. Only after many years, when he was protected by his authority as bishop of Hippo, did he dare to pronounce the abhorred name of Porphyry the Sicilian, obviously, not to acknowledge the debt he had contracted to him, but to condemn his criticisms of Christian gospels. Following this interpretative criterion, we would like to be allowed to go as far as bringing up the question if the Philosophy from Oracles, which was read by Augustine in the Latin translation by Marius Vic- torinus, is not to be identified with Porphyry's lost work Against the Christians. Harnack's authority has imposed the opinion that Augustine would never have known, if not indirectly, Porphyry's anti-Christian work.99 This opinion has been generally accepted so far,'0? with the remarkable exception represented by Dyroff.1?0 We believe that this opinion is a completely unfounded scientific prejudice and that an unbiassed reading of Augustine's writings can demonstrate with remarkable cer- tainty the essential identity of the Philosophy from Oracles-which was surely read by Augustine-with the Kaa&amp; XPLaTLtavcv. Since the first mentioning of Porphyrius siculus in De cons. evang. I, 15, 23, it has been clearly evident that Porphyry, in the books known to Augustine, made use of pagan oracles which praised Christ, attributing him a superior, even though simply human, wisdom, whereas they hurled heavy insults at the Christians, accusing them of ignorance and corruption.'02 Certainly influenced by the oracles pro- 258</page><page sequence="12">QUOSDAM PLATONICORUM LIBROS duced by Porphyry, Augustine in Milan incurred the "Photinian" mistake of thinking Christ merely as a man endowed with exceptional wisdom.'03 These are the anti-Christian oracles reported by Porphyry in the Philosophy from Oracles and known to us through the quotations of De Civ.Dei XIX, 23.1'? Moreover, it must be borne in mind that all the doctrines attributed by Augustine to Porphyry in the crucial texts of Book X of De Civ.Dei sound deeply anti-Christian. In fact, Porphyry refuses to recognize that Christ is the Principle who, by means of His Incarnation, purifies men, and compelled by his pride, he despises the humble "Mediator".'05 Filled with the pride generated by a vain learning, Porphyry despises Christ for His virginal birth and His infamous death on the cross.'06 Since Porphyry refuses to acknowledge the redeeming value of the Incarnation, he cannot find the right way to get to the heavenly home where we must return, even if he is able to see it.'07 In the same way, the Resurrection seems like an absurdity to the philosopher who builds up his soteriology and eschatology on the strict principle: omne corpus esse fugiendum, ut anima possit beata permanere cum Deo.108 In these texts of De Civ.Dei X there are thoughts which were also expressed in Conf. VII, 9, 13 ff., where Porphyry's typhus,'09 his refusal to accept the humility of the incarnate Word,"0 and his subse- quent inability to find the way to the heavenly home ' are stigmatized. Besides, looking through previous works, it is certainly to Porphyry and his philosophical pride that Augustine is alluding in De ordine II, 5, 16, when he writes that true and genuine philosophy teaches the Trinity in the same way as the venerable mysteries of faith do, without any confu- sion and, above all, without any pride (nec contumeliose); he also writes that the fact that such a great God assumed the form of a human body, insofar as it seems something unworthy, is even more filled with a mercy which is inaccessible to the pride of the intellectuals (ingeniosorum superbia). "2 Augustine himself, as can be seen, had almost wasted all the advan- tage acquired by the reading of the libri platonicorum, since he had fallen a prey to the intellectual pride conveyed to him by Porphyry.'13 The Divine Providence's will was that he came across the Platonic books first, and then the Scriptures, as otherwise he might even have lost his faith because of the great influence exerted by Porphyry, or he might have fallen under the illusion that the fundamentals of devotion could originate also from the reading of those pagan texts! 114 259</page><page sequence="13">PIER FRANCO BEATRICE The broad hints of the first dialogues are therefore directly connected with the narration, in the Confessions, about the libriplatonicorum and the systematical and explicit polemics in De cons.evang. and De Civ.Dei. As time goes by, the shadow of Porphyry becomes more and more definite and clear-cut, and in Augustine's mind the Christian answer in opposition to what he had read in the Philosophy from Oracles becomes clearer and clearer. Besides, Augustine openly declares that De Civ.Dei, as a whole, was conceived and written in order to defend the City of God, namely, His Church, from the slanders of the pagan philosophers who, making a boast of their knowledge, deride the Christian doctrine according to which the separation of the soul from the body is to be regarded as a pain or as a punishment; to them, on the contrary, blessedness exactly consists in the liberation of the soul from the bounds of the body."5 The Books VI-X of De Civ.Dei are written against those qui se adversus salutarem doctrinam tumidius et inflatius extollentes ad beatitudinem, quae post hanc vitam speratur, etiam per daemonum multorumque deorum cultum existimant pervenire: this is the portrait of Porphyry and the concise description of the anti-Christian intent of the Philosophy from Oracles! In fact: Ubi et nobiles eorum philosophi tribus in his quinque sed ultimis libris refelluntur a nobis, that is to say, in the Books VIII-X where the criticism of Neoplatonism, especially Porphyrian Neoplatonism, is developed."6 According to Augustine, Porphyry did not want to surrender to the Christian religion (ne a Christo vinci videretur), so he promised everlasting blissfulness to wise men, with no return to the previous miseries of this world. Moreover, in order to contest the Christian doc- trine (ut Christo adversaretur), he denied the resurrection of the imperishable bodies to assert that the souls of the saints would live forever with no body at all."' Augustine synthetically defines Porphyry as magnus eorum philosophus .................. Porphyrius, fidei christianae acerrimus inimicus; 8 doctissimus philosophorum, quamvis Christianorum acer- rimus inimicus; "9 the anti-Christian oracles, which praise Christ whereas they vituperate the Christians, could have been made up by Porphyry himself, ab homine callido eoque Christianis inimicissimo. 20 Reading such eloquent expressions, how can one deny that Augustine was acquainted with Porphyry's anti-Christian literary activity? It is true that in the Retractationes (426 A.D.) Augustine denies that the 260</page><page sequence="14">QUOSDAM PLATONICORUM LIBROS famous Porphyrius siculus was the author of the six questions to which he had answered in Epist. 102 to Deogratias,'21 and which had then (406/12) been put to him as if they were extracted de Porphyrio contra christianos.'22 Nevertheless, Augustine's attitude can be explained if his supposed mistake is attributed to the reluctance typical of a person who, like him, did not want to reveal his knowledge of that terrible work and even his admiration for the author, a pagan philosopher so abhorred in Christian surroundings! 123 Moreover, I am inclined to believe that the expression contra chris- tianos in Epist. 102, far from designating the title of Porphyry's work in Latin translation,124 simply indicates its intent or essential contents, in the same way as de regressu animae in De Civ.Dei X, 29. These are not the Latin titles of two different works of Porphyry, but two dif- ferent ways by which Augustine individuates qualifying aspects of the same work, the Philosophy from Oracles. The anti-Christian purpose of the Philosophy from Oracles is still more definite in another passage from Augustine: Iste vero philosophus (scil. Porphyrius) vel potius qui talibus adversus christianos quasi oraculis credunt.125 Nobody would say that in this passage the two words adversus christianos designate the title of a work by Porphyry! The same should be said, I think, for contra christianos in Epist. 102. Once again, in the Retractationes, where Augustine expresses his regret for having given too much credit to Neoplatonism when he was young, we find the final confirmation of the fact that in Milan he had read a Neoplatonic work marked by an unmistakable anti-Christian attitude: Laus quoque ipsa qua Platonem vel Platonicos seu Academicos philosophos tantum extuli, quantum impios homines non oportuit, non inmerito mihi displicuit, praesertim contra quorum errores magnos defendenda est christiana doctrina.26 Against whom should the Christian faith have been defended if not against Porphyry, who had attacked it so violently?127 6. Usus iustus It may at first seem paradoxical that Augustine adhered to Catholicism through the reading of a pagan work so fiercely anti- Christian as Porphyry's Philosophy from Oracles. Courcelle wondered how Augustine could have been led to Christianity by the reading of the Kara&amp; XpLtToav&amp;v, and finding this hypothesis even daring, he also denied 261</page><page sequence="15">PIER FRANCO BEATRICE Augustine's knowledge of this work.'28 Yet, if it is true, as we believe to have proved, that Porphyry's anti-Christian work is to be identified with the Philosophy from Oracles, the paradox will naturally disappear. From the beginning Augustine realized what enormous intellectual wealth the divine grace offered him through the reading of this work which, with its powerful contents of Neoplatonic spiritualism, freed him definitively from Manichaean materialism and dualism. However, at the same time, he must have felt a sense of dismay and bewilderment before the idolatrous orgy which filled the same Porphyrian texts. So he felt the need to turn to Simplicianus for enlightenment and for the necessary encouragement.'29 After these conversations Augustine was convinced of the existence of an essential agreement between the Christian trinitarian theology and the Neoplatonic doctrine of the hypostases, because the libri platonicorum, as Simplicianus pointed out with clear satisfaction, inculcated God and His Word in every way.'30 Consequently, Augustine was able to proceed toward the definition of a programme of theological research based on the principle that faith in the auctoritas Christi must be laid as the foundation of learning; as far as the use of ratio is concerned, he thought he would find in the Platonic doctrines some speculative elements which would not be in contrast with the Christian revelation.'3' In this way, since his first writings of Cassiciacum, Augustine had adhered to a "philosophical eclecticism" which put him in consonance with a long and rooted tradition of the ancient ecclesiastical thought; 32 he was therefore entitled to discern, within the Philosophy from Oracles, the precious contributions of Platonic and Plotinian thought, mediated by Porphyry, from the idolatrous and theurgical aberrations the latter had not been able or had not wanted to resist. Augustine refers to this complex and hazardous enterprise when, in Conf. VII, 9, 15, he places himself among the pagans who, by God's order, have the right to take possession of the Egyptians' gold, as the Hebrews had already done (Exod. 3, 22; 11, 2; 12, 35 f.), because gold belongs to God, no matter where it is. The Apostle Paul had made a missionary speech in front of the Athenians, in which he maintained that we live, move and exist in God, sicut et quidam secundum eos di- xerunt; his position was therefore in keeping with the thought of some pagan philosophers.'33 Basing himself on such an authoritative teaching, also Augustine found it correct to utilize the treasures of 262</page><page sequence="16">QUOSDAM PLATONICORUM LIBROS Neoplatonic thought (intendi in aurum), yet he did not nourish himself with Egyptian food (inveni haec ibi et non manducavi) and neglected also Egyptian idols (et non attendi in idola Aegyptiorum). Thus, also the following sentence can be explained, which has been lively discussed: et utique inde erant illi libri. Certainly inde is not referred to the Egyptian home of Plotinus,'34 nor is to be referred to Athens, the city where Longinus, Porphyry's first teacher, taught;135 moreover, it is not even referred to the gold of the Egyptians.136 It more simply indicates paganism as the original cultural place of the Platonic books. After all, Augustine himself came from paganism (et ego ad te veneram ex gentibus).'37 The principle of the rightful use (usus iustus) of pagan philosophy from the Christian point of view is clearly expressed in a text which is contemporary to the Confessions, namely, De doctr. christ. II, 40, 60: to Augustine, if what philosophers, and first of all the Platonists, have said about the Godhead is true and in harmony with the Christian faith, not only is there no need to fear their doctrines, but these doctrines must be appropriated again, taken away from the wrong owners and brought back to their rightful Christian use. Just like the Hebrews, by God's order, took away the precious gold and silver treasures from Egypt, so, in the same way, the Christian, leaving idolatry behind, must take from paganism the gold and the silver of the liberal culture and the theological truths which are to serve the right purpose of the preaching of the gospel.'38 Usus noster, usus iustus, usus christianus: with this purpose in mind, Augustine can widely justify his personal behaviour toward the libri platonicorum.39 Refusing to adhere to the idolatry contained in these books, Augustine, in a way, redeemed the Neoplatonic theological heritage, making it definitively suitable to the Christian thought. With regard to the utilization of the theme of the "spoils of the Egyptians", Augustine had been preceded by other Christian thinkers such as Origen 40 and Gregory of Nyssa.141 More generally, however, a decisive influence was exerted on him by Simplicianus's tale of the conversion of Marius Victorinus. In fact, Augustine saw the pains and the conflicts of his personal experience reflected in the African rhetorician converted to Christianity thirty years before. All the things we have been saying so far acquire their full meaning only if it can be made credible that the libri platonicorum were nothing but the Philosophy from Oracles, namely, Porphyry's great anti- 263</page><page sequence="17">PIER FRANCO BEATRICE Christian work, and that exactly this work had been translated by Marius Victorinus into Latin at the time of his fervent adherence to idolatrous paganism. 7. Porden pelusiam Unfortunately, we have no outside source confirming Augustine's report on the conversion of Marius Victorinus. The scholars who too hastily identified the libri platonicorum with Plotinus's Enneads have been led to admit, without asking themselves too many questions, that Marius Victorinus had translated into Latin the whole of Plotinus's work, and consequently they tried to find some Plotinian quotations in the preserved works of Marius Victorinus. For example, according to Henry,142 Marius Victorinus would have literally quoted Plotinus, Ennead V, 2, 1 in his Adv. Arium IV, 22, 8.143 Yet, Hadot proved that not even this quotation can be considered a tex- tual one and that the formulation of Marius Victorinus does not refer to Plotinus, but to a Porphyrian paraphrase of the text by Plotinus.'44 Marius Victorinus's interest in Porphyry rather than in Plotinus is well known and documented. The Latin translation of Porphyry's Introduction (Eisagoge) to Aristotle's Categories was done by Vic- torinus.145 Victorinus's assertion: multi in anima corpus esse dicunt,"46 refers to a Porphyrian paraphrase of Plotinus.'47 Those to whom the assertion is referred are the doctissimi homines criticized by Augustine in De quant. animae, that is, Porphyry.'48 If Marius Victorinus mediated the knowledge of Plotinus in the Latin West, he very probably carried out this important cultural undertaking not by means of the translation of the Enneads, but of some work of Porphyry which contained and commented on some extracts from Plotinus. Yet, there is something more and it is of considerable importance. In his comment upon Cicero's De inventione, Marius Victorinus asserts that truth is hidden from men, who have to rely on conjectures, and therefore there is no cogent argument. Men regard as necessary only what is generally accepted by the current opinion. As evidence of that, Victorinus gives the example of the Christians who, against the normal logic, do not regard the following reasoning as necessary: "If the woman has given birth to a child, she must have made love with a man", or: "If he was born, he also has to die". To the Christians, it 264</page><page sequence="18">QUOSDAM PLATONICORUM LIBROS is normal to think that a man was born without a father and did not die! 149 The biting anti-Christian irony of this passage reveals Marius Vic- torinus's cultural likings and religious interests. There is evidence, here, of how closely he followed Porphyry's anti-Christian arguments.150 Therefore, we are allowed to think that he was the author of the Latin translation of Porphyry's work against the Christians which we have identified with the Philosophy from Oracles. Only by placing Victorinus within his contemporary pagan culture, so deeply influenced by Porphyry's thought, can we fully understand the meaning of his biographical data in Augustine's Confessions. Still advanced in years, Victorinus was a venerator idolorum and took part in sacrilegious pagan rites (sacrorumque sacrilegorum particeps) almost the whole aristocracy in Rome was very fond of (inflata spirabat). Rome was the city where Victorinus taught rhetoric until a statue in his honour was erected in the Forum.'5' Moreover, his public conversion to Christianity was delayed because he feared that his former friends, the proud worshippers of demons, would become his enemies. 152 Yet, which divinities aroused so much enthusiasm and were firmly defended by Victorinus for so many years? Most of them were degraded and shameful Egyptian gods, such as Flatulence, the goddess of Pelusium,'53 and divinities with every sort of animal and monstrous appearance, such as the barking Anubis with a dog's head.'54 They were exactly those Egyptian gods-and this is the irony of history!-that long before had taken up arms to fight against the power of Rome: now Rome was invoking them, though they were long subject to its military power. 55 The criticism of Christianity and the philosophical renewal of tradi- tional idolatry-especially in the version offered by Egyptian zoolatry-were the aspects of Porphyry's work which must have attracted Marius Victorinus's attention to the extent that he saw the utility of translating the Philosophy from Oracles into Latin.'56 Firmicus Maternus, a Christian apologist who lived in the same period as Victorinus (middle of the fourth century), and also turned to Christianity, indirectly confirms our reconstruction when he quotes an oracle of Serapis-the famous Egyptian god mentioned by Porphyry- in order to explain the pagan, and at the same time anti-Christian, nature of the Philosophy from Oracles. '5 265</page><page sequence="19">PIER FRANCO BEATRICE Marius Victorinus was then a persevering and proud supporter of pagan idolatry as seen by Porphyry. Yet, if, in spite of all that, he bowed to the yoke of humility at the end, bending his head in front of the abomination of the Cross, and through the Neoplatonic metaphysics he fought against the Arian heresy, why couldn't Augustine follow the same spiritual path? This seems to be the right meaning of the story of Marius Victorinus's conversion in the Confessions: by reporting such a famous and authoritative example, Augustine, with the support of Simplicianus, was allowed to justify his Neoplatonic likings and, above all, to defend the critical and eclectic use, the usus iustus-which he had already theorized in the writings of Cassiciacum-of the tremendous anti-Christian work written by Porphyry, that is, the Philosophy from Oracles. 8. The consequences We have exposed an attempt to interpret the Augustinian expression libri platonicorum. This attempt throws a new light on the real process of Augustine's conversion to Catholicism. This conversion was certainly genuine and deep and was made easier, at the intellectual level, because he had abandoned Manichaean materialism thanks to the enlightenment produced in his mind by the spiritualism of Neoplatonic metaphysics, which was common to Plotinus and Porphyry. Yet, Augustine found himself involved in a really ambiguous and awkward situation, because the Neoplatonic doctrines which played a decisive part in his abandonment of Manichaeism and his definitive adherence to Catholicism were found by him in Marius Victorinus's Latin translation of a work which was deeply imbued with pagan idolatry and ruthless anti-Christian sarcasm: this work was Porphyry's Philosophy from Oracles! This ambiguity lies at the root of Augustine's conversion and it left clear evidence throughout his works. Only this ambiguity can, on one hand, explain Augustine's long silence on Porphyry from 386-when he read the Philosophy from Oracles-up to 400, when he mentions him for the first time in De cons. evang., and, on the other hand, the critical indulgence later showed by Augustine toward the Neoplatonic thinker. Augustine could freely speak about Plotinus within the Milanese cir- cle, where the Egyptian philosopher was openly appreciated-one need hardly mention Ambrose and Manlius Theodorus-, but he had to 266</page><page sequence="20">QUOSDAM PLATONICORUM LIBROS speak ill of Porphyry, as all Christians at that time did. Yet, out of an unconfessed gratitude, he could not help speaking well of him, to a cer- tain extent, acknowledging him as having even been superior, from some points of view, to Plotinus, his master, in the process of approaching to Christian truth. Ten years ago I managed to bring to light the remote but genuine Encratite origins of the Augustinian doctrine of the original sin.'58 Today I think I can say that Porphyry's Philosophy from Oracles was the anti-Christian work which opened up the treasures of Neoplatonic wisdom to Augustine, hastening his conversion to Catholicism, in spite of its idolatrous contents! This means that the Augustinian Quellen- forschung can still reserve great surprises in the future. On the other hand, the conclusions of our research do not seem less relevant to understand the literary and religious contribution of Por- phyry, the most imposing but also the most mysterious personality of the late Greek antiquity so far. The Augustinian utilization of several Porphyrian passages allows us to include with sufficient certainty the fragments De regressu animae, the fragments on the statues of the gods and the letter to Anebo in the Philosophy from Oracles. The relation of this work, which has been reconstructed in this way, to the De abstinentia should be more carefully examined and clarified, but the most important thing herewith is that there is a whole series of elements which seems above all to justify the identification of the Philosophy from Oracles with the lost work written by Porphyry against the Christians. Obviously, the demonstration of such identity, in order to be accepted unreservedly, should be carried out through a wider and more complete documentary evidence than the one offered by Augustine. To reach this aim, we should examine all the Christian apologetic writings which, more or less on purpose, were directed against Porphyry's polemic attack from the end of the third century up to the middle of the fifth century, that is to say, from the date of the publication of the Against the Christians until its destruc- tion, ordered by the Catholic emperors. Within this long series of authors and works, running from Methodius of Olympus to Theodoret of Cyrus, Augustine is actually entitled to an outstanding position. If we are not mistaken, his witness leads us to conclude that the Philosophy from Oracles was the anti- Christian work by Porphyry. 267</page><page sequence="21">PIER FRANCO BEATRICE List of abbreviations AHAW Abhandlungen der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften AKPAW Abhandlungen der Koniglich-Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Aug St Augustinian Studies BA Bibliotheque Augustinienne CChL Corpus Christianorum, series Latina CSEL Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum EPRO Etudes preliminaires aux Religions Orientales dans l'Empire Romain GCS Die Griechischen Christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten Jahrhunderte Med St Medieval Studies Mus Helv Museum Helveticum PL Patrologia Latina REA Revue des Etudes Anciennes REAug Revue des Etudes Augustiniennes Rech Aug Recherches Augustiniennes RHPhR Revue d'Histoire et de Philosophie religieuses SCh Sources chr6tiennes Vig Chr Vigiliae Christianae NOTES * Parts of this discussion were read at a symposium on Augustine held at Toronto in May 1987.

Henry-H. R.

See also Eunapius, Vitae sophistarum IV, 1, 11 (ed. J. Giangrande, Romae 1956, p. 8): "But Porphyry, like a chain of Hermes let down to mortals, by reason of his many-sided culture expounded all subjects so as to be clear and easy of comprehension". '7 This is his new interpretative suggestion contained in the book: Porphyry's Philoso- phy from Oracles in Augustine, Paris 1959, and developed in the article: Porphyry's Phi- losophy from Oracles in Eusebius' Praeparatio Evangelica and Augustine's Dialogues of Cassiciacum, RechAug 6 (1969), 103-138. 18 De Civ.Dei VIII, 12 (CChL 47, 229): ?recentiores tamen philosophi nobilissimi, quibus Plato sectandus placuit, noluerint se dici Peripateticos, aut Academicos, sed Platonicos.

I will interpret the very controversial passage in this way, taking ton Chaldaion ta logia as the general title of Porphyry's work, corresponding to the better known Philosophy from Oracles, in which Porphyry commented on a text by Plotinus according to the general approach of his Chaldaean philosophy. As a matter of fact, we know that in the Chaldaean Oracles the eternal, but not uncreated substance of matter was affirmed: see John Lydus, De mens. IV, 159 (ed. R. Winsch, Lipsiae 1898, p. 175). The information given by Aeneas is to be related to De Civ.Dei X, 31 (CChL 47, 309). For the discussion of Aeneas's passage see the contributions by M. Wacht, Aeneas von Gaza als Apologet.

In reality, one must interpret it as follows: "This doctrine of metempsychosis was held (tenuit) also (et) by Plotinus, Porphyry's master". 136 Against Testard, Saint Augustin et Ciceron, I, p. 169, note 1; Te Selle, Porphyry and Augustine, 114 f. 137 So, rightly, Gilson, Egypte ou Grece? 48; Courcelle, Recherches, p. 132, note 2; Pepin, Ex Platonicorum persona, p. 267 f. 138 De doctr.christ.

His opinion, which is set forth in the Scritti di erudizione e difilologia, II, Roma 1958, pp. 219-227, is justified by a piece of information given by Jerome, Comm.Es. XIII, 46, 1 (CChL 73 A, 516): "et crepitu ven- tris inflati, quae Pelusiaca religio est". See also Minucius Fel., Octavius, 28, 9 and Ps. Clem., Recogn. V, 20. For other suggestions it would be useful to see also the contribu- tions by J. Preaux, Pelusiota, in: Hommages c Max Niedermann (Coll. Latomus 23), Bruxelles 1956, pp. 286-295, and Courcelle, Confessions, pp. 75-88. 154 On this Egyptian god see now J. C.

Hagendahl, Augustine and the Latin Classics (Studia Graeca et Latina Gothoburgensia XX), Goteborg 1967, I, p. 358; II, pp. 398 and 609. 156 Thus, we think that Hadot's radical scepticism on the possibility of saying something about the libri platonicorum translated by Marius Victorinus, is completely unjustified: Marius Victorinus, pp. 201-210. 157 Firmicus Maternus, De errore prof. rel.
