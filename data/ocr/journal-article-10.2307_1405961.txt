<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mendelian Evolution and Mandalian Involution: Speculations About the Foundations of Cultural Change Thomas J. Musial and Julian R. Pleasants YOU must pardon our audacity in presuming to say anything Yof substance about the foundations of cultural change in such brief space. Our apology for undertaking such a task lies in part in our spirit of adventure, and in part in our qualified inten- tion to be suggestive rather than comprehensive. We are not aim- ing at conclusive scientific or scholarly documentation. We are being speculative, as scientists and scholars are sometimes prone to be when they are away from the laboratory or library, or when they are nagged by some of the nettlesome questions they feel com- pelled to come to terms with as men, but which professional pru- dence generally forbids them to talk about in formal conference or print. We would also like to make public our belief in the deep friendship between the sciences and humanities by unabashedly talking to each other in public, proclaiming common interests in common problems, and suggesting that in collaboration we will find the best basis to our problems' solution. Our thinking about the basis of cultural change began in a discussion of Carl Jung's Memories, Dreams, Reflections with three colleagues in architecture and the engineering sciences at a 1971 summer workshop in the humanities at Notre Dame. We were exploring Jung's claim that "our souls as well as our bodies are composed of individual elements which were all already present in the ranks of our ancestors," and that "the 'newness' in the indi- vidual psyche is an endlessly varied recombination of age-old com- ponents." As we will indicate later, such a claim opens up sur- prising possibilities in the light of the principles of Mendelian genetics and Neo-Darwinian evolution, even though it might strike many an educated person as an unsupportable claim. Actually, Jung was trying to establish a theory about psycholog- ical evolution. He was arguing that despite man's presumed 20th- century sophistication, man is psychologically still pretty close to classical antiquity and the Middle Ages--if not, in fact, just a thin veneer of civilization away from primitivity. Jung was making a case for the historical roots of body and soul, and for the way 154</page><page sequence="2">Mendelian Evolution 155 violent departures from one's past give rise to the "discontents" of civilization. He was calling attention to the psychological dan- gers of cultural uprootedness. He was chiding man for rushing impetuously into novelty, driven by a mounting sense of insuffi- ciency, dissatisfaction, and restlessness. He was trying to indicate that wholesale societal reform by mere new methods or gadgets is dubious, dearly paid for, and, on the whole, grossly inadequate to satisfy a man's fundamental peace or happiness. He concluded that "inner peace and contentment depend in large measure upon whether or not the historical family which is inherent in the indi- vidual can be harmonized with the ephemeral conditions of the present."l Jung's position prompted considerable discussion and created a frame of reference which we found of inestimable value in de- veloping our position on different aspects of cultural change. We believe that what we have to say is pertinent to any discussion of cultural change and thus of general concern to all who enter into discussion on matters relating to this topic. We believe that our remarks will provide a possible basis for understanding whether our country is currently experiencing a decisive cultural change, not experiencing such a change, or whether it is about to experi- ence such a change in the near future. Whatever one's position might be on this issue, we would like to suggest that certain models of biological change may be used for their heuristic value in under- standing the very principles of cultural change. Thus we see our essay as a prolegomenon to the whole question of cultural change. First it is necessary to have a frame of reference with respect to the use of the term culture, for there are different uses of the word and the different uses correspond to different notions of what culture is. The distinctions that we would like to make roughly correspond to the differences between the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities as areas of study. It is possible to speak of a culture, as the natural scientists do; cultures as the social scientists do; and culture as the students and purveyors of the humanities do. For the natural scientist, a culture is essentially an enhanced process of growth, proliferation, or increase. It is the manifesta- tion of vigorous life; it is production, incremental development; 1 C. G. Jung, Memories, Dreams, Reflections (New York: Vintage, 1961), pp. 235-236.</page><page sequence="3">156 THOMAS J. MUSIAL AND JULIAN R. PLEASANTS organic increase in magnitude or quantity. In this sense, the term culture is related to its fellow term "cultivate" as it involves the literal and physical husbanding of the soil or plant or animal life so that there might be an abundance of whatever organic matter is to be multiplied in a way that is most conducive to its multiplica- tion. In this sense of the term we can speak of the culture of grass, corn, mosquitos, bees, or the cultured pearls of oysters. We can also speak of the work of Beadle and Tatum who utilized cultures of the mold Neurospora crassa to study the relationships between genes and enzymes, or the work of Lederberg who used cultures of the intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli to study the genetic constitution of one of the few bacteria in which sexual recombina- tion has been demonstrated. For the social scientist, culture is the interplay of human atti- tudes, values, customs, and institutions, as reflected in the observa- ble behavior of a given people. In this sense, we speak of culture in the plural, and we identify African cultures, preliterate cultures, Eskimo culture, the culture of the inner city, Mediaeval culture, or the culture of Smalltown, U.S.A. Through the social sciences, we have been able to learn of countless observable and definable com- binations of human attitudes, values, customs, and institutions. Insofar as each of these is definable, it is possible to speak generi- cally about different cultures, and more specifically, about corre- sponding subcultures. The social sciences, however, possibly be- cause they are descriptive rather than normative, refrain from any account of a "locus" in "the nature of human beings" which is the basis for normative value formation or any essential "givens" of man's spiritual, intellectual, social, or physical life which account for the observable behavioral consistency and diversity in human activity. Such a normative study of man is the province of the humanities and gives us our third concept of culture. In the humanities, culture is a refined human ideal that em- braces the whole nature of man. It is the legacy of those human achievements which give us a basis for understanding man's various and possible perfections. The humanist's view of culture is not a scientific knowledge to be gained, but a wisdom to be acquired. The wisdom honors facts, but within the purview of overriding values - values, moreover, which go beyond the particular beliefs, attitudes, customs, or institutions of any given person or society in any given time. In this frame of reference, language, art, reli-</page><page sequence="4">Mendelian Evolution 157 gion, literature, and philosophy seek to give intelligibility, meaning, and purpose to the life of Man, a being with an essentially unchang- ing nature. Thus the poetry of Homer, the sayings of Buddha, the philosophy of Aristotle, the theology of the Church Fathers, the teachings of Mohammed, the architecture of the Gothic cathedrals, the discipline of Zen, the symphonies of Beethoven, the novels of Dostoevsky, the thoughts of Gandhi, and the essays of Ortega y Gasset furnish instances of culture as human ideals -- models which serve the purposes of education by providing examples of refined or heightened achievement of mind, imagination, taste, pleasurable sensation, or style. Such models help discerning men to understand what is good, and thus how best to live a rewarding life. It is important to speak of these three different conceptions of culture in view of the general agreement of natural scientists, social scientists, and humanists that man is an intelligent, social animal. Indeed, he lives his life in each of these modalities. Because he is intelligent, he exercises his reason and imagination in such a way as to develop a quality of living. In this sense, man lives in a world that is directed by his intelligence. He dreams, and hopes, and formulates ideals. He celebrates life in art and ritual. He derives moral standards. He accounts for the ultimate ground of his being in terms of religion and metaphysics - and not always as a mere abstraction, but usually in some form of living relationship with his God. Because his daily actions take on the form of specific relation- ships with others, man can be studied as a social being. He works, he spends money, he marries, he organizes institutions, he goes to war. He raises a family, he provides food for his young, he partic- ipates in group customs, he develops manners (ways of doing things), and, in general, interacts in a variety of social, psycholog- ical, political, and economic ways with other men. Because he is a biological organism, there are a number of "givens" that determine the physical limits of his abilities within which he must live. Human customs, institutions, and styles will change. In some ways, so too will ideals and values. But they can only change within the framework of man's given morphological and genetic composition. With these distinctions in mind, we come to our more important purpose to look at certain models of biological change for their</page><page sequence="5">158 THOMAS J. MUSIAL AND JULIAN R. PLEASANTS heuristic value as they suggest principles of cultural change. The first biological model that we would like to cite is known by the technical term succession. The principle of succession was dis- covered about 75 years ago at the Indiana Dunes. It is easy to describe. For many centuries the wind and waves have been add- ing new land to the southern shore of Lake Michigan. Because of this, one can walk back from the beach, through a dune, to a forest. As one does this, he is, in a sense, walking backward in time as he goes from what is now bare sand, to what was once bare sand a century ago, to what was bare sand two centuries ago, to what was bare sand a thousand years ago. As he walks this distance, he is aware of a definite pattern of succession: bare beach begins to sprout dune grass; scrub cherry, pussy willow, and cottonwood intrude on the dune grass; evergreens like pine and hemlock succeed the cottonwoods; oak and hickory replace the evergreens; and finally, beech trees and maples take over to produce a majestic climax forest, like that at Warren Woods. There is a principle that becomes manifestly clear in this trip from the shore- line inland. For all the stages preceding the climax state, every form of life that succeeds another form is in turn itself succeeded by still another form. In fact, it is each form's very achievement that leads to its replacement in that locality. Succession, in this technical sense, is not the same as the succession of forms which occurs during evolution, when one species becomes another species over a tremendously long period of time. In microbial succession, for example, it may take only a few hours for the first dominant species to change the environment so much that a previously un- important species becomes dominant. Succession means new rela- tions of importance or dominance among already existing species. With as much literal truth as poetic image, the first colonizers, dune grass and small shrubs, are called pioneers. In the most inhospitable of soils, bare sand, they send out hungry rootlets to seek every molecule of useful mineral. They are constantly turning air and sunshine into more rootlets which can exploit these meager resources. It is their wonderful productivity itself which brings about their replacement. Their decaying leaves and roots provide a concentration of minerals, organic matter, and moisture for plants that could not grow on bare sand, but can grow better than dune grass in the environment which the dune grass has created by its pioneer virtues. The pioneers move on, as the Ameri-</page><page sequence="6">Mendelian Evolution 159 can pioneers did, to new land, and the second stage of succession takes over where they did their work. We acknowledge the anthro- pomorphic nature of the language used to describe this phenom- enon. We further believe this use of language is significant in that it points to correlations between human values and how they are often derived from or reflected in biological models. Needless to say, there are cultural implications in such a model. For now, let us simply cite one which takes some of the bitterness out of the debate over what technology has done to civilization - a theme which the countercultural exponents Theodore Roszak and Charles Reich have made most of us aware of. If we regard technology as the extension, by machines and other concentrated energy sources, of the pioneer virtues, a worthy successor to a plow that broke the plains, we can see in our principle of succession that the very success of technology is the reason why it will be succeeded by another stage which utilizes its accumulation of goods, knowledge, and method to produce another kind of life style. This doesn't mean that succession is inevitable. Vast pine forests are often kept from going to the next stage of succession, the hard- woods, by such factors as fire and logging. These acts of man or nature periodically destroy or remove the accumulations of humus that would make life better for the hardwoods than for the pines. Analogously, and speaking of culture as the social scientists do, the technological societies, by destroying their excess productivity in war, or by exporting it to countries still in the pioneer stage, could stave off the next stage of succession until the rest of the world reaches the total utilization of the technological stage. Or one country could go ahead to the stage beyond technology even while much of the world is struggling through a difficult pretech- nological pioneer stage. This possibility could be a service to the rest of the world in that the advanced country could serve as an example of a future stage of succession to the less advanced, giving the rest of the world some idea of what to expect as they approach similar stages. Succession, then, describes the process by which a genetic or cultural diversity which has previously evolved can bring about rapid adaptation to a changing environment. Resources which are al- ready present in a community or in an individual but which have been latent or playing a minor role, can assume increasingly domi- nant roles in the life of the community or individual. And this</page><page sequence="7">160 THOMAS J. MUSIAL AND JULIAN R. PLEASANTS occurs precisely because the previously dominant trait or group, by its success in altering the environment, has made the environ- ment unsuitable for itself and more suitable for another group. In looking at cultures the way the social scientists do, to find the life style that would be dominant in a new stage of succession, we would have to look among those cultural and genetic enclaves or individuals which were not successful in the present stage but may possibly have the combinations needed for success in the next stage. The assumption is that people adapted to the stages of the future already exist among us. In raising the question of whether or not we are currently ex- periencing any decisive cultural change, it may also be useful to be aware that our ideas of culture themselves may be unconsciously influenced by hidden biological models, models which could be helpful to our understanding, but which could also be misunder- stood and misapplied. We have already pointed out the use of anthropomorphic language in describing the principle of succession. We shall also acknowledge that the very term culture goes back to a biological, agricultural analog, even though the term is now used in different senses by the biologist, the social scientist, and the humanist. From the cultivation of crops comes the root idea that man's work in controlling the environment of a living organism can greatly enhance its ability to grow and develop and multiply. Nevertheless, it is recognized that the biological potential of the organism is a given, and that man does, in a way, place himself at the service of that given, even though to a great extent he is able to put his environment to his own use. For example, when we inoculate Staphylococcus aureus into a culture medium, or work out the nutritional requirements of germfree mice in order to raise them as a pure culture, we are working towards a form of life and growth which may never have been realized under natural, uncontrolled conditions, but which is still very much determined by the genetic constitution of the organisms, as well as by the en- vironment we create. It is clear that even in the sense in which the biologist speaks of a culture, the human race is a culture, whose growth and de- velopment and multiplication are enormously enhanced by the physical and social environment which man himself creates. But American culture in an almost unique way resembles a culture in the microbiologist's sense of the term. America started like a</page><page sequence="8">Mendelian Evolution 161 small inoculum placed into a tube of rich medium containing few competitiors. What followed was a rapid and relatively even expansion of many different types of Americans into the available resources. This corresponds to the logarithmic growth phase of a bacterial culture, during which period they show a characteristic morphology. Similarly, American culture shows the psychological and sociological characteristics of this virtually unlimited expansion, so that growth has become the means by which we solve or post- pone all problems. The demand for rapid growth has become the dominant feature of our society, determining its economic, social, political, and international policies. This characteristically American approach was recently ex- pressed clearly and approvingly by the distinguished analyst of American culture, Zbigniew Brzezinski. In his Newsweek column (March 27, 1972), attacking the politics of zero growth, he told the American people: S. .. economic growth is about to join science and technology as the be^te noire of our time. It is, therefore, worthwhile to ponder briefly the likely political and international consequences if zero growth were to become the dominant outlook of a country like the United States. That inequality exists in the United States is indisputable. However, what has made inequality bearable is that in the Ameri- can tradition (as well as myth) it is balanced by opportunity. Opportunity requires flexibility and mobility, and these are created by growth. Growth - through inventiveness, initiative, creativity -makes it possible for an individual to rise or at least entertain the dream of rising. Those promoting zero growth as a means of advancing egalitari- anism in American society have probably not considered the de- gree to which American capitalism might become openly coercive without further economic growth.... The result would be loss of liberty and opportunity, unless one assumes that without growth the system would collapse. The other alternative for America would be stagnant socialism. Equality would be attained through massive redistribution of wealth. However, it is unlikely that massive redistribution could be attained without recourse to violence - especially if there is no compensating growth. .... In brief, zero growth is not the solution. However, the alterna- tive to zero growth is not massive, undirected growth, but planned, purposeful growth. We do need to define for ourselves more pre- cisely what kind of a society we wish to build, in which direction we wish the world to head, and what ecological concerns humanity</page><page sequence="9">162 THOMAS J. MUSIAL AND JULIAN R. PLEASANTS shares in common. The answer to that will be provided, in very large measure, by further economic and scientific growth, but growth geared to more deliberately defined objectives than has been the case in the past. In a later model, we will question the effectiveness of growth, even planned growth, as the ultimate problem solver, especially when growth is defined in purely quantitative terms, with no at- tempt to include growth in personal maturation, interpersonal rela- tionships, or other qualitative changes. What is alarming is that unnecessary growth does not represent mere waste which can easily be discarded, but becomes itself another problem. It repre- sents, rather, in terms of another biological model, a cancer which can cause the death of the organism which produces it. We do not even need to go outside the university to see the problems created by reliance on growth to solve all problems. The universities relied on endless growth to supply their faculties with security for the old, opportunity for the young, and improved com- pensation and facilities for all. When an end to quantitative growth appears on the horizon, we are precipitated into a crisis which seems to have no humane solution. For example, the structure of graduate education was built on an impossible rate of exponen- tial increase in Ph.D.'s, impossible, that is, if the function of most Ph.D.'s is to produce more Ph.D.'s. For example, Notre Dame produces new Ph.D.'s at a rate (1971) which would double the number of Ph.D.'s in three years. If only half the new Ph.D.'s become producers of more Ph.D.'s, this still means a 15 per cent annual increase in academic Ph.D.'s. At that rate, Notre Dame's progeny of Ph.D.'s would in 30 years be 66 times their present number on the faculty. Besides this emphasis on quantitative growth, other influences of biological models have left their mark on our thinking about culture. Controversies between the social scientist and the human- ist over the meaning of human culture still echo the nature-nurture controversy of early evolutionists. Some of the modern controversies seem consciously or unconsciously based on some early Darwinian ideas which have since been corrected by means of Mendelian models. The term Mendelian evolution in our title, rather than Darwinian evolution, was not chosen solely for the sake of making a pun with the term Mandalian, which we borrowed from Jung's symbol for the integrated psyche, the Mandala. The rediscovery</page><page sequence="10">Mendelian Evolution 163 of Mendel's laws of inheritance around 1900 constituted a revolu- tion in evolutionary thought which nonbiologists seem to have missed. Darwin's own theories of heredity, including a blending of maternal and paternal characteristics, and pangenesis, with its inheritance of characteristics acquired by the parents, was a mech- anism so fluid that it could not have sustained evolution as we know it. Genetic characteristics have, in fact, an extraordinary stability, only occasionally changed by mutation. What Mendel and his successors did was to explain the obvious diversity among individuals in terms of new combinations of very stable, though still mutable, hereditary units. The new molecular biology has reinforced this view of relative stability by referring it to the chemical stability of DNA and the conservative force of natural selection with regard to successful strategies. For example, in Scientific American (April, 1972) R.E. Dickerson provides an easily understandable demonstration of the extraordinary stability of the gene for cytochrome c in all oxygen-using organisms. The parts of this molecule which determine its energy-producing func- tion have not changed in an estimated 1.2 billion years. They are exactly the same in microbes and man. Other parts, which are mere filler to build up the molecule to adequate size, show changes whose number seems determined by the time elapsed since the divergence of their ancestors. Thus there are no differences even of filler parts between man and the chimpanzee, but 44 differences between man and bread mold. Nevertheless the cytochromes of man and mold will react with the enzymes of either species, for there is no difference in their functional parts. Thus Mendelian genetics, unlike the genetics of Lamarck or Darwin or Lysenko, establishes a fixity in man's genetic make-up which is not absolute, but is so stable relative to cultural change that it becomes a practical fixity. It was this which Jung realized when he postulated a similar fixity of psychic elements: Just as the body has an anatomical prehistory of millions of years, so also does the psychic system. And just as the human body today represents in each of its parts the result of this evolution, and everywhere still shows traces of its earlier stages - so the same may be said of the psyche. Consciousness began its evolution from an animal-like state which seems to us unconscious, and the same process of differentiation is repeated in every child. The psyche of the child in its preconscious state is anything but a</page><page sequence="11">164 THOMAS J. MUSIAL AND JULIAN R. PLEASANTS tabula rasa; it is already preformed in a recognizably individual way, and is, moreover, equipped with all specifically human in- stincts, as well as with the a priori foundations of the higher func- tions.2 In this context, Mandalian involution would be a retracing of cultural evolution within the individual psyche, discerning there the common elements which have been inherited with virtually no change except in their combinations. It is ironical that in 1910, John Dewey, in order to free him- self from any "restraint" of transcendental determining ends (Aristotle's Ei8o0), was proclaiming evolution as the end of all fixity3 just about the time that the laws of Mendel were demonstra- ting the remarkable stability of genetic units despite the great diversity of their combinations. So it seems to have happened that while Dewey was removing final determining causes as principles of stability in successive generations of biological organisms, Neo- Darwinians were establishing a pragmatic basis for this fixity by applying Mendelian concepts to the evolutionary principles of Dar- win. Their studies imply a rate of mutation and selection so slow in the genetic factors that affect human experience as to give no evidence of significant differences in the various ways men have experienced reality within the few thousand years of recorded his- tory.4 Twentieth-century cultural experience seems to confirm this inference. Men still respond to the plays of Aeschylus, Soph- ocles, and Euripides in basically the same way as did the theater- goers of fourth- and fifth-century B.C. Athens. In fact, this similar- ity of human experience over several centuries was an important factor in the empirical psychology of Sigmund Freud. Freud be- lieved, for example, that If the Oedipus Rex is capable of moving a modern reader or play-goer no less powerfully than it moved the contemporary Greeks, the only possible explanation is that the effect of the Greek tragedy [depends] upon the peculiar nature of the material [of the play] . . . . The fate of King Oedipus moves us only be- cause it might have been our own, because the oracle laid upon us before our birth was the very curse which rested upon him .... 2 Jung, op. cit., p. 348. 3 John Dewey, The Influence of Darwin on Philosophy (New York: Henry Holt, 1910), pp. 1-19. 4 G. G. Simpson, Biology and Man (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1969), pp. 118-119.</page><page sequence="12">Mendelian Evolution 165 As the poet brings the guilt of Oedipus to light by his investigation, he forces us to become aware of our own inner selves, in which the same impulses [of Oedipus] are still extant, even though they are suppressed .... 5 While biology no longer provides any support for a metaphys- ical or absolute human "nature," Mendelian or Neo-Darwinian evolution provides full support for a genetic stability within the brief span of recorded history which fully justifies the humanist concern for finding, in the full range of historical time and space, resources for an understanding of what fulfills man. There is strong reason for suspecting that the more the future deviates from the present, the more likely it is to resemble some aspects of the past. There is every biological justification for the right of the humanist to judge either present or future in terms of values which men of many times and many places have found fulfilling of them- selves and others. It is at this point that we can introduce our final biological model, that of the climax state. Certainly we cannot set any limits to the genetic evolution of man, but it is safe to assume that genetic evolution is such a very slow process, made even slower in man by man's ability to control his environment, that for practical purposes it is unchanging, even in the flow of almost limitless genetic re- combinations. Assuming that man's customs, institutions, manners, styles, indeed, his very values and ideals, must build on the rela- tively stable product of genetic evolution, we might question whether cultural evolution (in any sense of the term) is an endless frontier or whether it has not in fact reached a stage that resembles a climax state. The distinguishing characteristic of the climax community (again, we speak here of the biological model) is that it is in bal- ance. The producers produce no faster than the consumers con- sume. The climax state is a closed circle. Materials recycle within the system and energy is taken in only to the extent needed to maintain the cycles. Has man ever culturally existed in such a state? It sounds utopian. Does he have the potentiality for such a state? A de- batable point. What are the desirable combinations of diversity within the parameters of his fixed context? The answer to that 5 Sigmund Freud, "The Interpretation of Dreams," The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud, trans. A. A.

PLEASANTS question, we believe, lies in the humanist's frame of cultural refer- ence, but let us be discreet in saying who must assume the respon- sibility of answering this question. We do not mean to imply that any class of designated or self-proclaimed enlightened Grand In- quisitors are to inherit the charge of providing for the happiness of mankind by some means of manipulating masses to achieve the programmer's sense of the best values, order, and balance for society. Desirable human values and the preferable forms of social, political, economic, psychic, rational, imaginative, celebrative, lov- ing, and spiritual (that is to say, in every respect, the good human) life will be found in the domain of the humanities, and the answers to these questions are every man's responsibility. No man is exempt from coming to terms with the great moral questions. No man is free from living within a frame of value reference, and the better he understands his values and their consequences, the better equipped he will be to meet life's complex demands. No machine, or modern gadget, or communication medium, or form of transporta- tion, or harness on nuclear or solar power has freed him from the need for self-knowledge, or the knowledge of his life's pur- pose, nor has it brought an end to the succession of questions which keep man asking "why?" Culture, as the humanist studies it, is based on the innumerable and seemingly endless variety of ways that men have viably an- swered these fundamental questions and demonstrated the fruits of their answers in their achievements. Some men have reflected their answers in artistic images, in forms of celebration, ritual, dance, and song. Some have shown us how to examine life ratio- nally to make it worth living. Some have left records and testimonies of their experience of divinity. Some have furnished models of human communion with nature. Some have formulated principles by which men can live in peace with their fellow men. Some have simply provided dramatic narratives of how men act and show the various consequences when some act in one way and others act in another. All these examples are records of some form of purposeful human ordering, which, if taken together, and intelli- gently appraised with reference to the present, give man the basis of viable values which can in turn provide an individual ordering principle for a rewarding and self-fulfilling climax state. In other words, in the realm of the humanist's concern (which is everyone's human concern) where we find models writ large (world views)</page><page sequence="14">Mendelian Evolution 167 and small (personal examples) of various human ideals, we find, even amidst conflicting and ambiguous claims, the basis for wis- dom - a wisdom which can guide man in the actualization of his personal or societal climax state. The climax community is the biological model of balance and integration. The Mandala is Jung's analogous symbol on the per- sonal level of the balanced and integrated individual. Without attempting to key on the Jungian corollary, however, it is now possible to explain the second part of the obscure title of our essay. Mandalian involution, as we use the term, designates that con- stantly changing (or combination and recombination) of factors which constitute purposeful order, peace, harmony, and balance, whether on the individual or societal level, whether reflected in art, or systematic analytic thought, imaginative ideals, morpholog- ical forms of nature, institutional organization, or social interaction. The Mandala is the symbol of integrated order. Involution is the principle of change, but change with reference to some pattern, or purpose, or fixity. It might involve growth or incremental de- velopment, not necessarily in a simple linear fashion, but rather in a complex pattern which can turn back upon itself as one of its etymological roots (vol-, to fold) indicates. It could also involve the decreasing of some aspect of life after it has served its purpose, as the uterus is said to involute to its former size after the end of pregnancy. Hence, as we see the phrase, mandalian involution represents balanced, harmonious individual or cultural change, guided always by some ordering principle, possibly itself one that is ever-changing. If we now turn directly to the question of whether there is a decisive cultural change, we could answer in our frame of reference in the following way. If decisive cultural change is viewed in terms of the emergence of a new man, Homo novus, consisting of an essentially new genetic composition, the answer must be no. We see no evidence for such change. "Point omega from the test tube" is an interesting thought, the possibility of which has recently come into man's mental frame of reference, but to date all focus has been placed on the test tube and still too little is known about such matters as the regulative feedback mechanisms involving compli- cated patterns of numerous genes. Further there seems to be little attention, if any, given by those who speculate on the possibilities of genetic programming, to what characterizes "point omega."</page><page sequence="15">168 THOMAS J. MUSIAL AND JULIAN R. PLEASANTS The bosom of Abraham, the state of Nirvana, the Beatific Vision - even the universal man, or the classless society, are not subject to the criteria of operational definitions or measurable by evidence of mere empirical behavior. Besides, we are still a long way off, as Malachi Martin tells us, from discovering and validating how the memory, imagination, and other human faculties function in either behavioristic or genetic terms: We do not yet know how to trigger heroic behavior, self-sacrifice, denial of felt but hurtful desires; how to control the megalomania of an egoist, to stimulate the humor and wit of human conversa- tion, the flow of ideas, respect for others, reverence for the aged and weak and young, patience under provocation, magnanimity in victory and success, or sharing with others. It is all very well to teach a dog to lift its paws when it has a visceral change or to instruct a child to write "I am" instead of "I is." But there is no scientifically verified way in which all men can be conditioned by behavioristic principles to forsake war, love their neighbors, or build a Taj Mahal.6 The difficulties of such programming are no less for the genetic manipulator than for the behaviorist. In any event, the wisdom of such a controlling value would come not from the knowledge of the scientist's laboratory, but from the humanist's value-sense of culture. And there seem to be no new dimensions to the age-old problems of man's essential meaning or the purpose of his life. We are still the sons of Noah finding our father naked and learning that he is both ennobled and victimized by this humanity - phys- ically strong, but spiritually overwhelmed by his appetites and his difficulty controlling his will. We are still the sons of Moses stand- ing in admiration of our father's vision, and standing in respect of his laws, but still troubled by his doubt and wrath. We are still the children of Adam, still murdering our brothers, still lying to our Gods (when our Gods still live), and still founding our paleo- technic cities, which, for all their sophistication, are still full of violent inhumanity. From both these points of view, then, the biological and the humanistic, the words of Ecclesiastes suffice: What has been is what will be, And what has been done is what will be done, And there is nothing new under the sun. 6 Malachi Martin, "The Scientist as Shaman," Harper's, March, 1972, p. 59.</page><page sequence="16">Mendelian Evolution 169 But obviously there are respects in which man is always chang- ing, minute by minute, day by day, year by year, epoch by epoch. Every moment is unique. Every experience is different. New cells constantly renewing. New life arising out of the old dying genera- tions. The question thus becomes, "In what general sense is man today different from what he was last month? a generation ago? a century ago?" To answer questions of this sort requires that we define contexts and compare particulars. Does a certain class of men in 1970 exhibit more socialistic tendencies than a similar class of men in the same geographic area in 1870? Is there more evi- dence of otherworldly self-denial in the 13th century than in the 20th? Is there a love of natural beauty and propensity for shaman- istic magic among college students in the late 1960's that may be meaningfully compared to a pragmatic and technological set of values generated three decades earlier by their parents? These are the kinds of questions that the social sciences deal with. They are, in our frame of reference, questions of ephemeral change in man's habits and sensibilities. They are not, in our estimation, fundamental or decisive changes in the nature of man. They are, rather, like the manifestations of the particular changes which constantly go on within the climax-state forest; and like the climax-state forest, they all find their equivalents in the past. They are all instances of the ever-changing recombination of age-old factors within a general frame of reference which is, for all prac- tical purposes, unchanging. Our own thoughts thus force us to take some exceptions to and make some qualifications on Professor Brzezinski's criticism of the politics of zero growth. Growth of a single kind cannot go on indefinitely. There necessarily comes a time-even though some may weep about it like the Great Alexander-when there are no more worlds to conquer. This means that growth in one area must be compensated for elsewhere. For this reason we believe it is in- evitable that America will change from a culture dominated by the drive for constant expansion of production to a culture based on other factors of balance. This change, for America, would be a major change in our culture as the social scientist defines it. The culture of the future will not merely be able to achieve a state of balance with the physical and biological environment as the eco- logical movement demands. It will involve moving to a stage of development in the individual, in society, and in international re-</page><page sequence="17">170 THOMAS J. MUSIAL AND JULIAN R. PLEASANTS lations, in which production of goods ceases to be the dominant and controlling aspect of culture for the simple reason that the problem of production has been solved. To be endlessly productive is now counterproductive. Men will soon discover that the dominance of production is no longer necessary, and that the fruits of material production are not fully satisfying. When they see this, they will then move to the next stage of succession in which they can come to terms with other aspects of themselves, and with other types of relations to one another. It is not necessary to say that such a change would be a change to permanent climax. Successional changes as such are changes toward climax, with an unbalanced excess of productivity serving as the selective force that brings about the next and more nearly balanced stage of succession. American culture has succeeded in the goals it set itself, and for that very reason it will be succeeded by a culture which can integrate the fruits of that success into a balance within and among individuals. Here we are speaking of cultural change as the social scientist defines it. But like a microbial culture in an exponential growth phase, the cultural change requires restraints, and the restraints will properly be determined by a cul- tural frame of reference in terms of the way the humanist defines culture. Where do such changes begin? The first and most appropriate step in anticipation of a new American culture is taken at the level of individual action. It is not beyond the ken of most people to set their own house in order. In fact, to fail in this responsibility in mild form is neurotic; to fail completely is sheer madness. Despite man's myriad inconsistencies and fragmented knowledge, the char- acter of civilized man---indeed, whatever it is that we mean by human culture-is reflected in the way individuals order their experience, their knowledge, and their means and style of living. Work toward the order of a viable future cultural climax state can and must begin for every man in his own life. To be sure, this is not saying anything new. The principle of ordered living is one of the oldest concepts in man's historical cul- tural traditions, and it is hard to think of a time when it has not been in evidence. What is new is our awareness of how principles found in the biological model of the climax state correlate with and can be applied to forms of personal and cultural change. Ordered living, we discover in our new frame of reference, is no less valid</page><page sequence="18">Mendelian Evolution 171 for our time and the foreseeable future than it was for our ancestors thousands of years ago. The Greeks of the fourth century B.C., for example, held the concept of balance, measure, and harmony to be inseparable from their ideals of human excellence and virtue. The good man and the happy man was the whole man, the well-rounded man, the man with equally developed and properly integrated body, spirit, and mind, living in harmony with his society and his natural environment. The principle of self-regulation which was both rigorous and flexible, and which took into consideration changing circumstances and foreseeable consequences, was called reason, the distinguishing mark of man's intelligence. Through its power, man was able to prevent things from getting out of balance, both personally and socially. We can conjecture on the basis of our frame of reference that the efficacy of reason and an ordered life will, in the years to come, give further testimony to the basic similarity between future human experience and that of men 2,500 years ago, despite the countless differences among individual men over this long period of time. It thus seems to make sense to say, in conclusion, that the quality of human living for the future depends, as it has in the past, on a knowledge of the physical nature of man and the world, a knowl- edge of the particular facts of current human attitudes, customs, and institutions, and a reliance on man's reason and good will to regu- late these factors in the innumerable ways which demonstrate viable human values in practice. We believe these all-important values can be found recorded in the humanistic traditions of man's cultural past in both the Eastern and Western worlds and we believe the stability of future cultures will reflect them, in new combinations, in ways analogous to the principles of permanence and change found throughout generations of biological organisms. Putting one's life in order is no small task. It is a project which is truly a life-long endeavor. Some men never succeed. Others never even take up the challenge. A new politics of a new climax state suggests staggering difficulties, and we are not now about to say what the prerequisites are for its success. But we are sure that we would all rest a bit easier at night if we knew that each of us had done just one more thing during the day to set our own hearts at peace.</page></plain_text>
