<plain_text><page sequence="1">GRAFFITI OF THE PRIESTHOOD OF THE ELEVENTH DYNASTY TEMPLES AT THEBES H. E. WINLOCK The simple, unpretentious inhabitants of Thebes during the Middle Kingdom have left very few records of their lives. It is seldom that so much as a line written spontaneously by any of them has survived the accidents of the four thousand years between their days and ours; and even when, on very rare occasions, some of them did scratch their names on the temptingly smooth, soft limestone of their native cliffs, they affected a minute, cramped, practically hieroglyphic hand which is far less likely to attract attention than the flowing hieratic of Rames- side scribes. Thus it is that comparatively few Middle Kingdom graf- fiti have been noticed among the hundreds of later scribblings on the rocks of Thebes today. The earliest known of these graffiti are near the temple of King Neb-hiepet-R~c Mentu-hotpe at Deir el Bahri. If one climbs as high as he can on the rocky spur which extends along the south side of the temple forecourt (Fig. 1),1 to the point where the cliff rises sheer above him and where the temple site lies some eighty meters below to the right, he will find scratched on the rock: "Horus Neter Hedjet, King of Upper and Lower Egypt (Neb)-hepet-Rc?, Son of Re2C Mentu- hiotpe; (written) by his beloved Wenenef-Rac's son Nenen-R" (Fig. 2).3 Here we have a man who writes his king's name in the fashion common to the sculptors of the shrines of the princesses in the temple below and who must, therefore, have lived in the earliest years of the reign of Neb-hepet-RIc.4 Near by Nenen-R'c scratched his name once 1 This is the light-colored tongue of rock projecting from the cliff in the right of Fig. 1 -a photograph taken in 1919 by the late Harry Burton. 2 Written within the cartouche. 3 Spiegelberg's copy-No. 1054 in his Graffiti, cited below on p. 148-is here reproduced as I emended it on the spot. 4 For the king's name on the shrines see Naville, XIth Dyn.

These few, obliterated scribblings are scattered sparsely along the rocks, and there are probably few others to be discovered in the whole necropolis except in one rather confined neighborhood. But in that neighborhood-on the cliffs behind Sheikh cAbd el 1Kurneh hill and above the little valley where the royal mummies were discovered in 1881-more than a hundred still legible Middle Kingdom signatures can be found even today. Ica~r t~ &gt;_X I O -4f S FIG. 2.-Graffito of the early years of Neb-hepet-Rec Mentu-hotpe These graffiti appear to have been noticed first in the winter of 1895- 96 by Wilhelm Spiegelberg. At that time he made squeezes of over eighty different graffiti, but it was not until 1920 that he prepared them for publication as Nos. 920-85 in his Agyptische und andere Graffiti aus der thebanischen Nekropolis.7 Unfortunately he had never been able to collate his squeezes with the originals, but nevertheless his atlas of large plates, presenting full-sized facsimiles, shows excel- lently the general character of these often careless and sometimes il- literate scrawls. With these, for the most part adequate, reproductions available I did not deem it necessary to make facsimiles again, hoping that where my transcriptions do not agree with Spiegelberg's the new readings will be accepted as justified by my own copies from the orig- inals, often controlled or emended by my colleagues. Ambrose Lansing had rediscovered these graffiti while excavating in 7 Those which appear in Spiegelberg's publication are marked "S" with the number given in his plates, below on Pls. 1-6.

I made copies of most of them in 1921-22, in some cases with the help of Battiscombe Gunn.9 In 1924-25 Walter Cline, who was on the Metropolitan Museum Expedition that winter, searched the whole neighborhood to make sure that we had noted all the graffiti, and as a result of the combined efforts of all of us we added about two dozen to those which Spiegelberg had seen. More recently I have incurred further debts to my colleagues in New York in prepar- ing my field copies for publication in the following pages. Ludlow Bull and William C. Hayes have both made numerous and extremely ingenious suggestions for the solution of some of the queer puzzles pre- sented by these often clumsy scrawls, and Lindsley F.

One can ascend the easy slopes at the end of the rocky spur which makes the valley's southern or left-hand side, past the forecourt of an Eleventh Dynasty tomb on its tip,10 and thence along the almost level top of the spur to the next, and more difficult, ascent. At about the 194-meter contour" the path turns to the north of a tongue of rock on the sheer wall of which there are scratched at least thirteen graffiti within the next fifty paces, or until one has ascended to the 200-meter contour.'2 8 In the excavations described by him in M.

The path then ascends to the rocky shelf at the 230-meter contour, where it passes out of sight in the photograph to the left of the promi- nent crag at the end of the cliff. Here there are sixteen more graffiti along the steep face of the rock ;13" four by priests of the one king and a like number by priests of the other; all within easy reach of the present path except three, which are some three or four meters above it and on the eastern face of the rock. Beyond this point the graffiti stop, and probably the path did too, for it must be remembered that in the Mid- dle Kingdom, when the Valley of the Kings was still wilderness, few could have had any object in making the dizzy scramble the rest of the way to the top.14 If, after one has passed the first group of graffiti, he turns to the right over the slopes between the sheer cliff above and the drop into the valley below, he will come eventually to the projecting bastions of the mountain in the center of the photograph. Here, at about the 190-meter contour, the cliff is thickly scribbled over with some seventy graffiti, all within a score of paces along the path, except one small group about four meters up the rock.'5 Since all the rest are within easy reach from the path, and one is actually within 12 cm. of its present level,"' it is obvious that this part of the mountain has changed but little in the last four thousand years, and, since today one cannot approach this group of graffiti from the north, perhaps it has always been inaccessible from that direction. However, it is only for a very short space that the way from the north is impassable at present, and it is conceivable that the narrow gully which cuts the approach in that direction has been eroded by the occasional torrents which have fallen over the cliff since the Middle Kingdom. Were that narrow space passable, one could leave the fore- court of the temple of Neb-h.epet-R~c at Deir el Bahlri by the postern gates in its south walls, ascend the rocky tongue of mountain in the right of the photograph, and thence proceed directly across the valley 13 Nos. 1 (name only), 14, 16, 21, 25, 34 (one), 41 (one), 45, 48, 52, 64, 75, 77, 82, 85. 14 See n. 8 above. 15 Nos. 6, 7, 28, 54. 16 One of No. 78 not seen by Spiegelberg.</page><page sequence="6">THEBAN GRAFFITI 151 head to the graffiti. Such easy accessibility would explain why the majority of the names of those connected with Deir el Bahri are at this point. Although the lay of the land makes these graffiti appear to be in three groups, they obviously should be considered as really but one. They are all within easy hailing distance of one another; they are clear- ly all of one period; and at least three of their writers appear in more than one group. Nofer-ebod wrote his longest graffito in the third group and left his name in the second;1' the name of a certain Reni- sonbe is found in the same places;18 and Mentu-ihotpe's son Se'n- Wosret wrote his name in all three groups, but most often on the path to the highest point where the graffiti are found."9 Of the writers whose signatures are still decipherable, all but a very few were members of temple priesthoods. The greatest number belonged to the priesthood of Neb-h1epet-Rec; about half as many to the clergy of Scankh-ka-Rec; seven to that of the god Amfin; and over a score have titles of temple priests and doubtless belonged to one or the other of these three hierarchies but have neglected to mention with which they were connected. A few, however, name the actual temples to which they were attached. Three were priests in Glorious are the Seats of Amiin, the mortuary temple of Neb-hepet-R?c at Deir el Bahri.20 Another priest of the same king calls that temple The House of Montu of Khacy-kau-[Re'], in obvious reference to the bene- factions conferred upon it by Se'n-Wosret III.21 The tomb of Scankh- ka-R~c must have been given the name Shining is the Pyramid, and we have one of its priests recording that name, although neither pyra- mid nor temple had ever been erected. Another priest less definitely indicates the same foundation by the common ideogram for a shrine.22 Two-thirds of these priests bore the title W?b23'-"the pure," so called because their first duty was to cleanse themselves before pro- 17 No. 1. 18 No. 41. 19 One of No. 34 and four of No. 35 in the first group; one of No. 34 in the second; and No. 33 in the third. 2o Nos. 2-4.

They were the junior grade of the hierarchy, but some of those whom we meet here had also acquired the additional titles Heru-hebet or Imy-set-ca, and one that of Scribe,24 and another that of Embalmer.25 More than one writer in four was a Lector or a Chief Lector--Heru- hebet or Heru-hebet heri-tep-whose duty it was to read the liturgies in the temple services. And then there were the few who bore the well-known title in the temple hierarchy-but of unknown meaning- Imy-set-ca. Half of these last were also WBcb-priests, and at least one was a Lector. Of the handful of graffiti remaining after those of the temple priests are counted, four appear to have been written by simple, unofficial citizens,26 and three give the names of functionaries connected with the necropolis in general. Two of these last followed the calling of Embalmer (Wet), one of whom-as has been noted-being in addi- tion a Wecb in the phyle of priests in some temple.27 The third was a certain Se'n-Wosret, "The Chief Ka-servant of the Divine Father." He was probably a mortuary priest attached to the tomb of the Di- vine Father, Prince Intef, the heir of Neb-hepet-ReC who died before succeeding to the throne, and who seems to have been buried near his father's temple at Deir el Baihri.28 Finally, there was the Lector Sobk-co, who is described by his son as having been in charge of the necropolis linen stores.29 It is noteworthy that in the score or so of cases where the writers name their forebears, only a third of the latter are designated as having been priests themselves. This may have been because the religious founda- tions of Thebes were new in the Middle Kingdom and their priest- hoods were of necessity largely recruited from the laity. It is typical, for example, to find that the Wecb-priest cAm was the son of an Over- seer of Magazines, and that another Wicb, Shed-Ptah., was the son of a Steward. In passing, it is worth noting that these two priests ap- 24 No. 69. 25 No. 79. 28 Nos. 83-86. 27 Nos. 79-80.

" The second takes the form of a crudely scratched memorial stela in honor of the obviously dead father, "which his son Sobk-co made for him."32 In the middle stands a figure, presumably of the father, from whom seem to issue the words: "The Chief Lector -he is the one over the linen of the necropolis33-Sobk-co, the Lector. He says: 'I did that which my Lord praises, and I satisfied his spirit.' [A boon which the king gives ....] thousands of bread and beer, thousands of beef and fowl, thousands of bread, thousands of beer, and all things good and pure (for) the Lector, deceased. Everything in this tomb is for the spirit of Sobk-co, the Lector, deceased." In the middle of this already confused inscription the son has unexpectedly introduced the name of that "Mentu-ihotpe's son Se'n-Wosret" who was a W?cb-priest of Scankh-ka-R'c and whose name we have already noticed some half-a-dozen times on these rocks.34 The great majority of the graffiti are limited to bare signatures, with a title and sometimes with the father's name for identification- rarely with the name of a grandfather.35 As we have already noted, these were priests of subordinate grades, and they do not give us a very glowing picture of the literacy of the general run of their order in Thebes during their generation. A glance at Spiegelberg's facsimiles inspires us with no very high idea of their calligraphy, and sometimes we may even doubt whether their often meager abilities could carry them beyond signing their own names-and very crudely at that. As was the style of the day, they usually wrote from right to left and 30 Nos. 8-9. These are late Twelfth Dynasty graffiti and not Nineteenth, as Spiegel- berg believed.

About one in four drew lines to sepa- rate the columns or scratched a frame around their writing, and a certain Wecb-priest Mentu-hiotpe had the effrontery to draw a royal cartouche around his name and title."3 About a dozen others drew very crude pictures of themselves, sometimes, like Nofer-ebod,"3 with- in a shrine. The most interesting peculiarity of the orthography perhaps origi- nates in a contemporary idiom of the spoken language. It would seem that the name of the sun-god Rec as an element of names was often left unpronounced in the current speech, for King Neb-h1epet-RT' is here sometimes simply called Neb-hiepet,3 and those named after him were often called likewise;39 and Scankh-ka-REc, both as a king's name and as a personal name, was often similarly clipped in the local dialect. 40 From the parts of the cliff where these graffiti are to be found there is a wide panorama of the distant eastern bank of the Nile, easily taking in all of Middle Kingdom Thebes where it was clustered about the temple of Amfin at Karnak and northward beyond the probably more ancient and then larger temple of Montu. On the west bank the whole plain is visible, from the early Eleventh Dynasty cemetery along the desert near the ferry landing-which must have crossed direct from Karnak in those days-southward to the Deir el Baliri avenue.41 It was obviously for this view that the writers of the graffiti made the breath-taking scramble up the cliff, for one of them luckily recorded not only his name but the occasion and the reason for his making the climb.42 He wrote: "The W'cb-priest Nofer-ebod; 36 No. 57; Spiegelberg, P1. 103, pp. 924 f. 37 No. 1; Spiegelberg, P1. 107, p. 968. 38Nos. 10, 16, 17, 33?, 47. 39 See below, "List of Personal Names," pp. 161 f.

In the Eighteenth Dynasty the landing stage opposite Karnak was called Kheftet-hir-neb-es- "Opposite to her Lord" (see Winlock, Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, X [1924], 224, P1. XIII). In the Middle Kingdom the river was surely nearer the Intef tombs than it is in the map there (which is based on modern conditions), and Kheftet-hir-neb-es probably should be about 1,000 meters further northeast. 42 No. 1.</page><page sequence="10">THEBAN GRAFFITI 155 giving praise to Amfin and kissing the ground before the Lord of Gods on his festival,43 the First Day of Shamu, when he crosses over on the day of voyaging to the Valley of Neb-bepet-Rec; by the Wgcb-priest of Amian, Nofer-ebod." The "Valley (in.t) of Neb-hepet-R'c" was clearly the popular name of Deir el Bahri in the Twelfth Dynasty,4 and the "Feast of the Valley," which here finds its earliest mention, became one of the chief religious holidays of Thebes, familiar to us from the Eighteenth Dy- nasty to Greco-Roman times.45 It was the day when Amfin's statue was brought out of the sanctuary in Karnak in its sacred bark, ferried across the river in a larger ship, and borne on the shoulders of priests from the landing stage on the western bank up to the temple of Neb-hepet-Rec, there to pass the night. Even when in later dynasties new temples had been built in western Thebes and the pilgrimage was made to them, it was still under the name of the "Feast of the Valley," though the later temples were in the plain. Since at Deir el Bahri the ferry from Karnak was probably hidden by the Dirac Abu n Nega hill, it would be only natural to send some- one up on the near-by cliffs, where the crossing from the city could be seen and where ample warning of the start of the procession could be shouted down to the priests waiting below. There are several places near Deir el Bahri which would have served as excellent lookouts, but the choice was given to a spot halfway between the temple of Neb-bepet-R~c and the site chosen for that of Scankh-ka-R'c. It is surprising that the priests of the latter's unbuilt temple were so inter- ested in the god's pilgrimage, but to judge from their numerous graffiti they obviously were, in spite of the fact that they had no shrine in which the bark of Amtin could actually have spent a night, 43 Actually written in the plural. 44 So on the stela of Se'n-Wosret III found in the temple (Naville, XI Dyn.

In any case, priests of both kings shared in the vigil, and some- times they must have had a long wait of it before the procession set out from Karnak. Then it was, while idling away his time up on the height, that some watcher picked up a bit of flint and scratched his name beside him on the rocks. In ancient or in modern times it has always been the same. One name scribbled on a wall has always been an irresistible lure to the next comer, and as long as there were priests coming year after year to the lookout, new names were constantly being scratched beside those already there. Sometimes the same priests came back a second or a third year46 and, as we have already noticed, not always to exactly the same spot. Occasionally, however, they seem to have had their favorite places, as did Ren-ef-res, whose name is written six times-perhaps on six different visits-but all within a fairly small area. On the other hand, we must realize that in many cases where the same name is found again and again, we are probably dealing with several different individuals. This is especially the case with those named Mentu-hotpe, many of whom had recogniz- able peculiarities of writing. The remarkable thing is, however, that not one writer took the trouble to do a presentable inscription, although often enough they must have had plenty of time while they were wait- ing for the procession to start out on the other side of the river. As for the exact dates of these graffiti our evidence seems at first somewhat vague, but there is actually reason enough to give us a very strong assurance that all belong within the Twelfth Dynasty. It was, I should judge from the handwriting, perhaps the Wacb- priest Shu-Amfin, watching from the highest lookout point, who scratched the rather amateurish version of the cartouche of a King Amen-em-h.ft near his own name.47 We have already noted that an- other priest calls the temple at Deir el BahIri The House of Montu of Khacy-kau-[RJe], and his graffito could not have been written before the reign of Se'n-Wosret III, from 1887 to 1849 B.C., during the second half of the Twelfth Dynasty.48 Another writer who should be dated to the Twelfth Dynasty is the Chief Lector Mentu-hotpe whose grand- father was named after Neb-h1epet-Rec, doubtless because he was 46 Nos. 1, 3, 11, 33-35, 39-41, 74, 78. 47 Nos. 14, 82. 48 No. 5.</page><page sequence="12">THEBAN GRAFFITI 157 born in that king's reign.49 If so, many a year must have passed be- tween the naming of the grandfather and the grandson's signing him- self "Chief Lector" up on the cliff, and the case is only slightly less convincing where a writer's grandfather was a WTcb-priest of the same king.50 It is even likely that in the dozen cases where the writers' fathers, and where even the writers themselves, were named after Neb-h1epet-Rc, many lived into the following dynasty, and it is cer- tain that where the writers were named after Scankh-ka-Rec they did not attain adult years until the Twelfth Dynasty was started. Fi- nally, choice of the lookout points, midway between the two royal burial places, would only have been made after the priesthood had been organized to serve the tomb of Scankh-ka-Re?, and this last con- sideration together with all the others seems to make it safe to date the whole group of graffiti to the Twelfth Dynasty. On the other hand, we have the case of one writer whose career clearly started in the Eleventh Dynasty. His graffito reads: "The Chief Lector, the Favored of Neb-hepet-R?c, Mentu-hotpe,"5' and here there can be no doubt that we have one who actually received favors during that king's lifetime. But even in this case it is perfectly possible that his graffito was written in the Twelfth Dynasty. Even if this Mentu-h.otpe was a grown man at the death of Neb-hepet-Rc- and that is the reasonable assumption in view of his claim that that king honored him-he could easily have survived the nineteen years remaining to the Eleventh Dynasty,52 but hardly the whole of the thirty-year reign of Amen-em-het I which followed. The earliest of these graffiti date, then, from the reign of Amen- em-het I; we have arnother which is at least as late as the reign of Se'n-Wosret III; and perhaps others should be placed later still in the Middle Kingdom."3 Among them we meet seven priests of Ammin and a dozen other persons whose names were compounded with that of Amtin,54 a god who was the patron of Thebes in the Twelfth Dy- nasty but was of minor consequence in the Eleventh. 49 No. 27. 50so No. 12. 51 No. 15. 52 Scankh-ka-RMc reigned twelve years, after which followed seven years of anarchy.

Perhaps from a later genera- tion there is another reference to the temple of Amfin on a fragmen- tary stela in the cemetery where Wah-cankh was buried.59 The Lady Amfinet-namesake of that goddess who was the feminine counter- part of Amfin-must have been born and named in the early years of Neb-hiepet-R~c,G and later in the same reign was born that Amen- em-lbt who survived the Eleventh Dynasty to occupy the throne himself for thirty years. Beyond this little we know nothing of the god before the Twelfth Dynasty. Sethe would have it that Amfin-even granting that he was men- tioned in the Pyramid Texts61-was only introduced to the Thebans by their prince, the Horus Wa.-cankh Intef-co, as a result of his vic- tory over the Heracleopolitans. Sethe seems to assume, since there is no contemporary evidence of the fact, that the Theban conquest some- how extended as far north as Hermopolis, where Amiin had been among the local eight deities-a god of the elements, anthropomorphic 15 I do not include in the Eleventh Dynasty a man named Amiiny as does Sethe, -Achtung feindlicher Filrsten, p. 63, since he was a contemporary of a certain SeJhetep-ib (ibid., p. 67), who must have been named after Amen-em-h.t I and hence was of the Twelfth Dynasty. See Edgerton, JAOS, LX (1940), 492, n. 44, who says these ostraca cannot be before Se'n-Wosret III. 56 Lange and Schifer, Grabsteine, 20512, 11. 1 and 6; Sethe, Amun und die acht Urg6tter, ? ? 9, 54. In one instance in 1. 1 the names of Amfin and Amfinet seem to have been erased under Akh-en-Aten, and later Am-in's alone was restored.

But, on the other hand, it never seems to have been the offi- cial religion of the Eleventh Dynasty kings, and it was only with Amen-em-h.t I-and probably because of some personal or family reason of the new king's-that AmiIn came into his own. Then, how- ever, his reputation grew apace, and very shortly afterward he was even identified with the Old Kingdom sun-god as Amen-RC.63 It would have been natural for the new ruler to do everything he could to strengthen his owpn position by increasing the prestige of his patron god. There seems to have been something in the earliest The- ban ritual of Amfin involving journeying by boat,64 and that prob- ably made it very easy for his namesake, Amen-em-h.t, to establish a new festival of the "Voyaging to the Valley of Neb-hepet-RWc," the Theban king who had united the Two Lands. It is obvious that Neb- hepet-R?c himself never could have anticipated such a pilgrimage, or his architects never would have designed a temple so ill adapted to processions. Its narrow doors and the forest of columns around its pyramid seem purposely contrived to make difficult the passage back into the sanctuary of such an object as the bark of Amln. In fact, the bark and its bearers could have measured no more than about 350 cm. in length and 90 cm. in width, if they were to negotiate the narrow doors and sharp turns in the ambulatory around the pyramid. This would have meant that one row of bearers would have had to leave the litter as it entered the first doorway of Neb-h.epet-RWc's temple, if, as seems probable, the earliest bark had three carrying poles for three bearers 62 This thesis of Sethe, in Amun und die acht Urg6tter von Hermopolis, is reviewed rather caustically by G. A. Wainwright in JEA, XVII (1931), 151. 63 Sethe (Amun, ? 236) quotes examples of the name Amen-R~c from the reign of Se'n-Wosret I. Lange and Schlifer, Grabsteine, 20754, mentioning Amen-RWc, is also of the Twelfth Dynasty and not of the Eleventh, as Sethe thought. The stela invokes Neb- bepet-R6c as dead and deified, and it must be remembered that within a score of years of his death Amen-em-lbt I had founded the Twelfth Dynasty. 64 Sethe, A mun, ? 54.

Nofer-ebod fixes the Voyaging to the Valley as taking place on the first day of Shamu, and in the days of Amen-em-h.t I that should have been in the first week of August.66 This was not a season of any significance in the ordinary agricultural life of the Nile Valley, be- cause farming is then at a complete standstill, while the river has a long way yet to go to be in full flood. The first of Shamu was, how- ever, preceded in the Eighteenth Dynasty calendar of the Ebers Papy- rus by the Feast of Khonsu67-Pachons-another god of the Theban pantheon. In subsequent calendars the Feast of the Valley-Payni- follows just one month after Pachons, at the beginning of Shsmu. Khonsu himself is known as early as the Middle Kingdom,6s and if his feast had long been kept where we first find it in the calendar, it would appear that these two festivals of Khonsu and Amiin were both part of a holiday season in Twelfth Dynasty Thebes. The first was of un- certain age perhaps, but the second was organized in all probability by the founder of the Twelfth Dynasty. It followed the next month on the day which up to that time had been dedicated to the Heracleo- politan god, Khent-ekhtay. Thus, in these graffiti we have been dealing with the names of priests of two religious foundations of western Thebes who were sent 65 The Chapel of Se'n-Wosret I at Karnak and the straight processional way of Ijat- shepsilt in her temple at Deir el Bahri both provide room for a bark with three rows of bearers who would require an avenue no more than 3 cubits, or about 156 cm., wide (Legrain, Bull. de l'Institut Frangais d'Archdologie Orientale, XIII [1917], 12; Chevrier, Annales du Service des Antiquitgs, XXXIV [1934], 172, Figs. 6-8). Legrain's suggestion that .jat-shepsiit's bark probably had only three bearers abreast was confirmed by the discovery of the stairways on the ramps at Deir el Babri (see M. M.A. Bulletin, March, 1926, Part II, p. 15, and March, 1932, Part II, p. 24.). 66 In 2773 B.c. the First Day of Akhet (New Year's Day) came on June 23; the First Day of Sh6mu (241 days later) was then on February 18. After four years the First Day of Sh6mu was on February 17, etc. Hence, at the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty, in 2000 B.c., it was on August 8, working back toward early June at the end of the Middle Kingdom.

Admittedly they were priests of lesser grades, and at first thought it may seem that the perpetuation of their names here is more a matter of sentiment than anything else. However, they actually give us an opportunity of emphasizing certain historical facts about the Egyptian Middle Kingdom. First: Only the hierarchies of two Theban rulers of the Eleventh Dynasty-those of Neb-hepet-R~c and of Scankh-ka-Ric-played an important part in the affairs of western Thebes under the Twelfth Dynasty.69 Second: The cult of Am-in-at least in so far as concerned his voy- age to the West-was not officially recognized by those two kings dur- ing their own lifetimes, nor was it planned for by the Eleventh Dy- nasty architects of Deir el Bahlri. Third: The voyage of the god to the temple of the Theban hero who had united the Two Lands was instituted in the reign of Amen- em-h1t I, obviously to enhance the importance of his patron deity, and thus indirectly as propaganda in his own favor.
