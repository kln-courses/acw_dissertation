<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME LV, No. 26 DECEMBER 18, 1958 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY WHAT IS OBJECTIVE RELATIVISM? IN his review of L. W. Beek's Philosophic Inquiry, Virgil Aldrieh describes Beek 's general position as "the spittin' image of Dewey's, couched at times in the vocabulary of objective relativism and of MIurphy's The Uses of Reason." He also identifies objec- tive relativism with "critical naturalism." 1 Aldrich's use of the name is only one of many it has received since A. E. Murphy coined it in 1927. Characteristically, these uses have presupposed agree- ment on the meaning of "objective relativism." Aldrich's use is no exception. Aldrich's identification of objective relativism with Dewey and philosophic naturalism is also a characteristic use of the name. Whitehead and E. B. McGilvary are two other figures often identi- fied as objective relativists, usually because of their critiques of bifurcation.2 On the other hand, it is common to encounter ref- erences to "objective relativism" and "objective relativists" with- out further identification of the philosophies or philosophers being referred to. Here Beek himself is no exception. But the application of the name seems to know no bounds. Wit- ness J. H.

But this might be said of many who were so named. After the many times he had been tagged an objective rela- tivist, Dewey used the term only once or twice to my knowledge. Those other two notorious objective relativists-A. N. Whitehead and E. B. Mc- Gilvary-never did mention the name in their writings as far as I can determine. 3 J. H.

At first it was most often linked with "naive," "direct," "presentational," "neo-," "natu- ralistic" or "natural, " or " perspective" realism. Sellars once called it a "half-hearted qualification of neo-realism," singling out thinkers "like Whitehead and Murphy" who had fallen back upon it "in despair" to avoid the difficulties in the naive position of neo- realism.7 And there is Lovejoy's famous identification of objec- tive relativism as the second phase of the "revolt against dualism" (the first being neo-realism).8 Other writers have associated or directly identified objective relativism with Relativity Theory, the objectivity of relations, philosophical relativism, pluralism, and the critique of bifurcation. Hahn suggested that "objective rela- tivism is far from being a single specific doctrine or set of doc- trines," but rather contains "within its ample domain a host of differing views." 9 Little wonder, then, that Pratt should suggest that objective 5 Clyde Kluckhohn, "Ethical Relativity: Sic Et Non," this JOURNAL, Vol. LII, No. 23, November 10, 1955, p. 675. 6 Ernest Nagel, Sovereign Reason (Glencoe, Free Press, 1954), p. 53. Nagel points out that the identification with pragmatism should be limited to the historical roots of contextualistic naturalism. Pragmatism is the matrix out of which it has emerged. Nagel is correct in identifying objective rela- tivism as an American contribution. Very little use of the term has been made in connection with non-American philosoplhers. 7 R. W.

Their agreement rests in a "common revolt against the traditional dualism" more than in their respective programs for replacing it, he claims.</page><page sequence="3">WHAT IS OBJECTIVE RELATIVISM? 1119 relativism might be little more than a proposal for a new terminol- ogy in which the prefix "ob" would be substituted for the prefix "sub." 10 Murphy himself, some ten years afterward, cast doubt upon the legitimacy of the child he had baptized-and on the bap- tism itself-when he noted that philosophizing in America had be- come too much a matter of defending positions instead of adding substantially to our knowledge, and that if one did not like any of the traditional "isms" there was "always a possible new one, 'ob- jective relativism,' for example, to enliven the discussion."" 1 If the name is applied to those philosophies that are in "com- mon revolt against the traditional dualism," then objective rela- tivism goes back at least to Spinoza. If it is applied (as it some- times is) to not only anti-dualistic but non-dualistic philosophies as well, then objective relativism goes back to the Pre-Socraties and writers of the Old Testament. Certainly the widespread use the name has received is the result of just such an application. This, however, has tended to obscure something more important about objective relativism: its alternative theory (or theories) to bifurcation. The possibility of there being more than one such theory has added to the confusion. But a greater source of con- fusion, one which has undoubtedly most influenced subsequent writers on the subject, is Murphy's own writings on objective rela- tivism. The alternative theory Murphy saw in the objective rela- tivism of Dewey and Whitehead is ambiguously set forth in these writings, and later writers have reflected the ambiguity. It is the intention of this paper to point out this ambiguity and to attempt to identify the unique nature of objective relativism as an alternative to bifurcation, basing the identification on what Murphy called its "most original and most controversial" element.'2 II Although Murphy said that "objective relativism" was the name of "the common tendency" in Dewey and Whitehead to unite "as prophets of the new gospel," he also gave the name to that new gospel. Negatively, the new gospel was a critique of bifurcation. Positivelv, it was "an alternative theory grounded upon the ulti- 10 J. B.

His conclusions would be most pertinent to this question and the writer takes this opportunity to urge Professor Murphy to undertake his proposed restudy of the problem.</page><page sequence="4">1120 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY macy of the relative." 13 The name "objective relativism" sug- gests both the critique and the alternative theory, and the constit- uent terms of the name indicate the "most original and most controversial" aspect of the new gospel: It attempts to unite two propositions which have uniformly been taken to be incompatible. (a) The objective facts of the world and of reality are the very 'apparent' and relative happenings directly disclosed to us in per- ception. (b) In spite (or beeause) of such objectivity such happenings remain ultimately and inescapably relative. Such relativity is hence an ulti- mate fact about the objective world.14 At least two questions are in order: (1) What does "in spite (or because) of such objectivity" mean? and (2) Relative to what? The way in which these questions are answered determines the meaning of Murphy's two propositions and, therefore, the meaning of "objective relativism" itself. But nowhere in his writings does Murphy indicate that these questions needed asking. When we ask what the "very 'apparent' and relative happen- ings directly disclosed to us in perception" are relative to, we can find in Murphy's writings at least two answers. At times he says such happenings are relative to one another. Here the incompati- bility he speaks of presumably would be the incompatibility of being objective and being related. But at other times Murphy says such happenings are relative to mind or a perceiver. In this case, the incompatibility would be traditional incompatibility of objectivity and subjectivity. (A further complicating factor arises in the use of such terms as "perceiver" and "organism" when rela- tivity to the body and relativity to the mind are not distinguished.) It is obvious that these are two quite different answers, and that quite different consequences follow from saying " happenings " are related to one another, and saying they are related to a mind or perceiver. But both answers are found in Murphy's writings. Thus some writers were led to identify objective relativism with a theory of the world as related or interrelated, or with a view of the objectivity or objective reality of relations. Other writers, how- ever, identified it with a relativity to mind, or philosophical rela- tivism. The first identification I propose to call relatedness, and the second identification I will call relativism. Actually, as will be seen, both are elements in-though not equally unique to-objec- tive relativism. 13 A. E.

The same event is here and there, now and then, and naturally so. The fact is not compre- hensible apart from its relations, and there is no reason why it should be. For relatedness is of the very essence of a world of events, of interaction.1' And here is a statement of relativism by Dewey: That an individual, possessed by some mode and degree of organized unity, participates in the genesis of every experienced situation, whether it be an object or an activity, is evident. That the way in which it is engaged affects the quality of the situation experienced is evident. That the way in which it is engaged has consequences that modify not merely the environ- ment but which react to modify the active agent; that every form of life in the higher organisms constantly conserves some consequences of its prior experiences, is also evident. The constancy and pervasiveness of the opera- tive presence of the self as a determining factor in all situations is the chief reason why we give so little heed to it. . . . Only in pathological cases, in delusions and insanities and social eccentricities, do we readily become aware of it. . . . Yet till we understand operations of the self as the tool of tools, the means in all use of means . . . science is incomplete and the use made of it is at the mercy of an unknown factor. . . .16 When Murphy says "such relativity is hence an ultimate fact about the objective world," he seems to be referring to relatedness. Again, he notes that the "misnamed 'theory of relativity' " fur- nishes another instance of the combination of objectivity and rela- tivity. If that theory proves anything, he says, it proves space and time are ultimately relative, not to mind, but to a given ref- erence system.17 And finally, Murphy tells us that "the foundation of the whole affair" (i.e., objective relativism) is an "inversion in the relation of objects and events." 18 Traditionally, events have been the characters of objects, and objects have been considered substantive and primary. Because of the assumed incompatibility of the objective and relative, however, no alternative to this notion was thought possible. Thus objective reality is assumed to be complete in itself, and the fact of happening, of occurrence in a given situation or context, is extrinsic to it. . . . The theory we are considering transposes this relation- ship. For it the event is substantive and objects are characters of events. 15 A. E. Murphy, " Substance and Substantive, " in University of Cali- fornia Publications in Philosophy (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1927), Vol. IX, p. 83. 16 John Dewey, Experience and Nature (Chicago, The Open Court Pub-- lishing Co., 1926), pp. 246-247. 17 Murphy, " Objective Relativism, " p. 123. 18 Ibid., p. 125.</page><page sequence="6">1122 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Thus relatedness, in all its complexity and interconnection, is made basic for the objective world.19 Any doubt that Murphy is referring to relatedness (and not rela- tivism) is dispelled when he points out that the consequences of this inversion are the same for Whitehead and for Dewey: the inter- relatedness of the world, and context and process. Thus the in- version is expressed by Dewey in terms of context, and by White- head in terms of perspectives: The relatedness which a perspective sums up and the centeredness to which it bears witness are facts about the world, and basic facts. For they express the very interaction of existing events which is the stuff of reality. . . .[objective relativism] affirms and expresses precisely such interaction. The fact of relativity is here no other than the fact of relatedness.20 But Murphy gives another answer to the question, Relative to what? He has identified perspective, relatedness, and interaction with relativity, as well as context.2' For Whitehead, "significance is the relatedness of things," and this, Murphy claims, is Dewey's contextualism. Both view the conditions and basis of meaning as the fact of relatedness or interaction. No quality, then, in and by itself is a meaning. Meaning, he says, is an "objective natural fact." Note that Murphy means here that relatedness or interac- tion as the basis and condition of meaning is a relatedness or inter- action independent (at times, at least) of relatedness or interaction with mind or a perceiver. But then he brings in the "organism": [Characters] belong to the given event in a context and their occurrence is significant of that context. They mean an external world because they are qualities of the world in its relation to the organism, they belong in that relation.22 Dewey is cited in support: Qualities have reference or meaning be- cause they never were in the organism in the first place, but were always of interaction; as much qualities of things as of organisms. It isn't clear in Murphy's reference to "organism" whether he has in mind the body of the organism, or the mind, or both. He does appear to restrict the relativity to the body. Adjectives or mean- ings, he claims, may belong to events without reference to mind; there are adjectives independent of relation to human beings but not independent of some relatedness.23 Whichever it is, this is certainly different from a relatedness between events. 19 Ibid., p. 126. 20 Ibid., p. 132. 21 Ibid., p. 135. 22 Ibid., p. 137. 23 Ibid., p. 137n.</page><page sequence="7">WHAT IS OBJECTIVE RELATIVISM? 1123 Murphy claims that Dewey was not content to merely recognize the relativity of meaning to a context; he persistently made it rela- tive to a human context. For Murphy this meant Dewey was taking one class of objects, namely, those which function in human use and activity directly, as primarily and ultimately important. That all objects occur as meanings in the interaction of events is true enough. That the interaction must be social and relative to human use is another matter.24 Dewey 's instrumentalist interpretation of science reflects this tendency, Murphy thinks, to treat scientific objects as relative not just to a natural (physical?) context, but also relative to human contexts as tools. "And this seems not true and certainly not con- sistent with the theory in question." Events, Murphy says, inter- act in other contexts than the human: like electrons. When this context is restricted to the human, a privileged context is set up. Murphy is ready to agree that only humans, perhaps, use meanings. But Dewey tends, Murphy thinks, to reduce meanings to the hu- man context. This is the "anthropomorphic bias " in Dewey which, Murphy claims, may very well open the door to "an inevit- able suggestion of 'idealism.' " And if Dewey's naturalism has been suspect, "this plainly is the reason. " 25 But it means something worse for Murphy: Dewey and White- head had not freed themselves "from the flesh-pots of bifurcation in a full and unambiguous way"-especially Dewey. In "bring ing" mind back into nature they had tended to spread indiscrimi- nately over the whole of nature a "bifurcated, arbitrary, and abso- lute 'human standpoint.' 11 26 That is, since all events manifest a very definite sort of relativity to their context and conditions, all "must perforce be sentient in some general sense," for such rela- tivity appears in human experience in the form of perspectives and in this special form presupposes "sentience," "apprehension," and the like. This extension of "the special feature of human relativity" to "nominally inanimate nature" is a result of the reac- tion to the old. dualistic view.27 24 Ibid., p. 141. 25 Ibid, pp. 142-143. By 1939, however, Murphy had switched his tune- or Dewey had lost his bias: " Mr. Dewey has no leanings toward animism or other such attempts to reduce the world to the human scale " (Murphy, " Dewey 's Epistemology And Metaphysics, " in P. A. Schilpp, ed., The Philosoph'y of John Dewey, New York, Thp Tudor Publishing Co., 1939, p. 223). Unfortunately we are not told what it is that led to this change. 26 A. E. Murphy, "The Anti-Copernican Revolution," this JOURNAL, Vol. XXVI, No. 11, May 23, 1929, pp. 282-283. 27 Ibid., p. 285.</page><page sequence="8">1124 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY It would seem, then, that Murphy wishes to restrict relativity to the organism to a relativity to the body of the organism but not the mind. Murphy identified Whitehead's relativity as interrelated- ness, and Dewey's as context. But Dewey's context is always a hu- man context. Hence, according to Murphy, Dewey's anthropomor- phism, animism, and idealism. For Murphy context is no different from any other interrelatedness. But if context and interrelated- ness are the same, and if context is human, then all interrelatedness is human. This is the outcome of Murphy's failure to distinguish relatedness and relativism. It is clear that Dewey had something more than interaction or interrelatedness in mind when he talked about context. Context included for Dewey what he called "back- ground and selective interest. " 28 And that aspect of context which he called "interest" is "known in philosophical terminology as the 'subjective,' " though it is not to be equated with the "ism" of subjeetivism.29 If Dewey were to extend context to include any and all cases of interaction or interrelatedness (as Murphy does when he identifies context and interrelatedness), then he would certainly be aware that it would not be a human context in all cases: Interest, as the subjective, is after all equivalent to individuality or unique- ness. There is no reason to limit its presence alnd operation to the organic and mental, although it is especially exemplified there. Everything whiclh exists may be supposed to have its own unduplicated manner of acting and reacting. . . . It is not a part or constituent of subject-matter; but as a manner of action it selects subject-matter and leaves a qualitative impress upon it.30 Murphy continued to fail to distinguish between relatedness and relativism. Whitehead and Eddington are charged with animism for their mis-use of the analogy of human perspectives as a means of understanding the "physical meaning and status of relativity in all events." 31 Again, in a series on Alexander, Murphy pointed out how Alexander had established the objective relatedness of the world, with knowledge as a specific case of this relatedness. This was a major contribution, he thought, because knowledge had been an anomaly when seen to be itself quite clearly relative and yet in a world of absolutes. Knowledge is relative, yet we ought to know objects in themselves. "Either its relativity or its objective valid- 28 John Dewey, "Context And Thought," in University of California Publications in Philosophy (Berkeley, The University of California Press, 1931), Vol. XII, pp. 212-213. 29 Ibid., p. 216. 30 Ibid., pp. 216-217. 31 Murphy, " The Anti-Copernican Revolution, " p. 287.</page><page sequence="9">WHAT IS OBJECTIVE RELATIVISM? 1125 ity must apparently be surrendered."82 But what does Murphy mean by "relative" here? Does "knowledge is relative" mean knowledge is of things-in-relation, or perhaps of the relations them- selves, or does it mean knowledge is relative to mind? There is even a third sense of "relative" suggested by his reference to absolutes. He could be saying knowledge is not absolute, but "relative. " But now Murphy may be thinking of relativity as something other than relatedness-though nowhere does he explicitly dis- tinguish it from relatedness, and certainly he never calls attention to how the distinction might bear on objective relativism. He reiterates that relatedness is the basic fact about reality. But knowledge is compresence, interaction, and in such interaction mind is together with things from its own standpoint. Hence no mere registration of an external environment is to be expected, much less the fabrication of a new one.33 Murphy is aware now that relativism in the sense of an interaction of mind with things from its own standpoint is not the same as mere interaction or relatedness. It is the difference, he notes, between a two-term and a three-term relation. On the latter-" relativistic" -view, even illusion is not error: A further relation is introduced and we have to deal with the peculiarities of individual minds. But once more, in that context the given object is real, it is a fact about the world in its relation to a given mind and follows from the connections of that mind with the world.34 This suggests that the interaction or relatedness that is a related- ness to mind (relativism) is not the same as the interaction or re- latedness between other things (relatedness). Murphy criticizes Alexander, in fact, for restricting the knowledge relation to one of " mere contemplation, " a " simple occupation " that makes no difference: Mind is merely 'together ' with things in an external f ashion and such 'compresence ' is taken to be the essence of knowledge. . . . If knowing be mere togetherness, then knowing adds nothing at all to the pre-existing reality which is simply alongside it.35 Murphy expanded this idea in a defense of objective relativism against Lovejoy's attacks, but the ambiguity in his use of "rela- tivity" continued. Objective relativism, he said, was the theory 32 A. E. Murphy, "Alexander 's Metaphysic of Space-Time, " The Monist, Vol. XXXVIIT, January, 1928, p. 22. 33 Ibid., p. 22. 34 Ibid., pp. 23-24. 35 Ibid., pp. 36-37.</page><page sequence="10">1126 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY that recognized the distinctness of the plurality of types of objects within a single world of interacting events, each quite real and ultimate in its own kind, which grounded our knowledge of them in the occurrent reality of the perceptual situation itself and which dis- covered in the effective relatedness of objects a valid clue to their objective nature.36 In the following year, Murphy wrote an introduction for G. H. Mead's The Philosophy of the Present in which it is quite apparent that the relativity being referred to is now relativism: The various theories of knowledge that were phases of the 'revolt against dualism' all sought to objectify those features of experience which a dualistic philosophy had regarded as merely subjective. This meant that what had previously been allocated to 'mind' must now find its place in 'nature' and that nature must be reconstructed accordingly. And finally, in the extension of relativity to the objective world, a criticism was required of the notions of 'perspective,' 'time-system,' 'sociality' and the like, in order to show how these notions, purified of their merely subjective connotations, could take their place in a system of categories as the pervasive characters of reality.37 Later, Murphy explicitly identified this with the relativism of ob- jective relativism when he looked back upon the use of the name in academic discussions as a means of stressing the fact that the experienced world is at once in some of its major features dependent on and conditioned by the special relations in which sentient (and more particularly human) organisms stand to their environment and also a direct presentation of that environment itself, or the order of natural events, as it is under such conditions.38 III It is clear, then, that objective relativism was not only a critique of bifurcation, but also an alternative theory to it. It included a theory of the objectivity of relations and a view of the world as interrelated, but its unique contribution was its relativism. Murphy's failure to be specific as to what this was a relativism of or to tended to obscure the objective relativist critique of such ab- 36 A. E. Murphy, " Mr. Lovejoy 's Counter-Revolution," this JOURNAL, Vol. XXVIII, No. 3, January 29, 1931, p. 71. 37A. E. Murphy in the Introduction to G. H. Mead, The Philosophy of The Present (Chicago, The Open Court Publishing Co., 1932), p. xv. Murphy notes that Mead's philosophy of the present was an important contribution to objective relativism as a revolt against dualism. A more recent expression of this metaphysics of objective relativism is to be found in T. T. Lafferty, "The Metaphysical Status of Qualities," this JOURNAL, Vol. L, No. 11, May 21, 1953, pp. 313-328.

It is not until this critique is seen that the "most original and most controversial" element that Murphy referred to is also seen: the union of the al- legedly incompatible objectivity and relativity. (Actually this union would be more apparent had Murphy called it "objective subjectivism.") The question is, What is the exact nature of that union? Numerous individuals generally identified as objective rela- tivsts were, at one time or another, concerned with the objectivity of relations and the relatedness, or interrelatedness, of the world. But as that avowedly non-objective relativist, A. 0. Lovejoy, indi- cated, objective relativism by no means had a monopoly on the view that relations are objective, or that existence is in some sense fundamentally related.39 But often this concern led writers to identify it as objective relativism. Thus one of the earliest state- ments of the objectivity of relations-F. E. Abott's "Scientific Theism"-is called by Schneider "an excellent exposition of ob- jective relativism. " 40 The critique of bifurcation in objective relativism certainly viewed relations as objectively real in opposition to the classical empiricist and 17th-century dualist notion that relations (and the qualities dependent on them) were apart from nature as products of an isolated mind. As one objective relativist pointed out, this was replaced by a non-bifurcated world of interrelated events "whose mutual influence determines their character." 41 This committed the objective relativist to the view that things can have different natures because they can be in different relations with other things, and that this possibility of different relations was an aspect of an ever-evolving plurality of worlds and processes.42 But something more is implied. Theories of objective relations and the interrelatedness of the world lead to relativism. In the late E. B. MeGilvary's "Perspective Realism," Postulate 2 states: Every particular in the world is a member of a context of particulars and is what it is only because of its context; and every character any member has it has only by virtue of its relations to other members of that context.43 39 Lovejoy, The Revolt Against Dualism, pp. 86-87. 40 Herbert Schneider, A History of American Philosophy (New York, Columbia University Press, 1946), p. 326. 41 S.

MeGilvary, Toward A Perspective Realism (LaSalle, The Open Court Publishing Co., 1956), p. 17.</page><page sequence="12">1128 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY If this is so, something more is implied when the interaction of mind and nature is viewed as an instance of this interrelatedness: Not only are particulars in general found in contexts . . . but it is a familiar fact that many of their empirical characters vary with the varying relations in which they are found. The tables and chairs and trees and mountains we see have different seen shapes and sizes according to the dis- tances and directions in which they stand to Us.44 That this is something more than a suggestion of mere physical or bodily perspective or relativism is suggested in MeGilvary's Pos- tulate 3: In the world of nature any 'thing' at any time is, and is nothing but, the totality of the relational characters, experienced or not experienced, that the 'thing' has at that time in whatever relations it has at that time to other 'things.' 45 In MeGilvary's objective relativism, then, both relatedness and relativism are indicated when he refers to his "theory that every- thing in Nature is relative and that consciousness is one of the natural relations, occurring under natural conditions." 46 By its theory of objective relations-or "universal objective re- lativity "-objective relativism "returned" man to nature. But if this is done, then surely it must follow that the old distinctions be- tweell subjectivity and objectivity disappear. Gone is the familiar bifurcation of qualities: for an objective relativist like MeGilvary a "physical thing" is defined as nothing but the totality of the physical relational characters it has at that time, but this definition of a physical thing does not preclude such a thing from having other characters in whatever non-physical relation it stands at that time to other things . . . when some physical things come to stand in non-physical relations they acquired certain non-physical qualities in these latter relations. But these acquisitions were as natural under the conditions under which they arose as the previously existing physical things.47 The new acquisition MeGilvary refers to is what once went by the name of "subjectivity" and was viewed as something to be avoided or perhaps even excluded (because unreal or non-existential). But it is a new element that expanded the physical world into the world of nature: With this expansion something new occurred but not a new world set over against the physical world with a gulf between the two.

Let us call what is new in this world the world of mind.... Mind is a physical organism when conscious. Thus the world of mind is not separated by a logically impassable gulf from the world of physics. The connection between the two consists in the fact that certain physical processes in physi- cal organisms give rise to the epiphysical world of mind.48 Dewey said the same thing in his Experience and Nature: Philosophers, and strangely enough philosophers who call themselves realists, have constantly held that the traits which are characteristic of thinking, namely, uncertainty, ambiguity, alternatives, inquiring, search, selection, ex- perimental reshaping of external conditions, do not possess the same ex- istential character as do the objects of valid knowledge. They have denied that these traits are evidential of the character of the world within which thinking occurs . . . that such things are only personal or psychological in contrast with a world of objective nature . . . [But naturalistic metaphysics maintains that] The world must actually be such as to generate ignorance and inquiry; doubt and hypothesis, trial and temporal conclusion.49 But if we agree with this re-definition of "subjectivity"-the restoration of subjectivity to the same existential status as objec- tivity-then "objectivity" must also be re-defined. If, for ex- ample, subjectivity is as real as objectivity, then objectivity can no longer be thought of as the exclusive domain of reality. Lovejoy once claimed that the real issue between objective relativism and dualism was this: "can the things which are by both doctrines de- clared to be 'relative to percipient events' be considered 'objec- tive.' " 50 The trouble was that a definition of what objective relativism meant by "objective" was needed. Indeed, Lovejoy felt that the objective relativist polemic had been "much facili- tated" by its neglect in defining "objective" and "subjective." 51 While many have set forth new definitions of "subjectivity," few have explicitly proposed a new definition of "objectivity." Even those sympathetic to objective relativism (like Beek) often fail to see the full import of the objective relativist critique. Beek, to be sure, does note the importance of distinguishing between the "relation of an object to the perceiving person and its relation to other objects." The object's qualities, he says, depend not only on the "highly variable relation" to the perceiver, but also "upon its more stable relations to other objects in its context." This is, of course, the distinction between relativism and relatedness. But then Beek goes on to do the same thing many other relativists do: he plays down the relativism in favor of the relatedness.

Qualities dependent upon the relation of an object to the nervous system and mind of the organism that responds to it are secondary qualities, and those that depend upon relation to other objects are primary. To be sure, Beck has not returned to the dualist posi- tion completely. Though the mind may be necessary to the emer- gence of a secondary quality, that quality is no more "in the mind" than the weight of an object is "in the earth." 53 The difference between the two is that the "most important kind of relativity in establishing the properties of an object" is "the relativity of one object to another, and not its relativity to us." 54 It appears that Beck sees the critique of bifurcation in objective relativism, but he fails to see the new meanings-or suggested meanings-that objective relativists gave to objectivity and sub- jectivity. He doesn't specifically define these himself, but it is clear he is identifying the "objective" in objective relativism with relativity to objects, and this relativity is independent of mind. It would follow, then, that "objectivity" for Beck means indepen- dent of mind," and "subjectivity" means "dependent upon mind" -with the added proviso that this dependence does not involve anything like the second world of subjectivism. If I read Beck correctly, it appears he has failed to see-or to indicate-that ob- jective relativism involves a utnion of objectivity and subjectivity (or relativity). For surely he must show how objective relativism makes sense if the "'objective"' in it means "'independent of mind," and the " relativism " means " dependent on mind. " It would therefore be meaningless for an objective relativist to make the distinction Beck does as to which relativity is the most important "in establishing the properties of an object." They are equally important. Whatever Murphy means by his proposition that "In spite (or because) of such objectivity such happenings [the objective facts of the world of nature disclosed to us in perception] remain ulti- 52 L.

If so-and I believe this is what Murphy referred to as the "most original and most controversial" element in objective relativism- then the relativism of objective relativism is at least as much re- sponsible for its name as is its relatedness. Beek does see that the objective relativist insists upon subjectivity and objectivity having the same existential basis. But he does not see that the objective relativist also claims that objectivity no longer involves indepen- dence of mind; i.e., the objectivity is relative (or subjective). That Beek may still be thinking of objectivity (and subjec- tivity) in terms of bifurcation is illustrated in his exposition of the objective relativist position on values. Beek claims that values are, for the objective relativist, distinctly dependent upon human need or interest. And then he quickly points out that being "re- lational" to a subject or person does not mean being subjective.55 But the objective relativist claims that values are subjective-i.e., re- lativity is subjective. The objective relativist further claims that the obloquy and horror traditionally directed toward the subjective, when objectivity was equated with reality or perhaps truth, is un- warranted. The subjective (or relative) is something that must be taken account of not only in value situations, but in descriptive or factual situations as well. Just as we cannot fully interpret the value situation apart from questions of subjectivity (or relativity), so too must our interpretations of factual or descriptive situations include serious consideration of the subjective. This brings up a second point about Beek's exposition of objec- tive relativism. It is customary among relativists to claim a sub- jectivity or relativity for value but to disavow that there might be any such thing in the descriptive or factual. But the objective relativist would ask, Why is it that the subject or person must be taken account of in the first ease, but not in the second? Does the person (or subjective) disappear, or hold itself in abeyance, or cancel itself out, or what? Can relativity to mind be confined to value? Put another way, Does being objective mean being indepen- dent of mind? The failure to distinguish relativism and related- ness in objective relativism enables the would-be relativist to have his relativity in both the value and descriptive or factual situations. But he is surely not the same kind of relativist in both cases. But it must be admitted that objective relativists have not al- ways been clear in their answers to these questions, and they have often raised more questions than they have solved. Clearly, the 55 Ibid., p. 213.</page><page sequence="16">1132 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY objective relativist is distinguished by his attempt to get all of the active mind, self, or person into all human situations without a return to the mentalism of idealism. Since so much of what domi- nates philosophizing today looks to Hume for its inspiration, this attempt is either considered subversive to empiricism, or it is con- spicuous by its absence. But it is possible that this "de-personal- ized" philosophizing is on the wane. Even our analytic brethren in their preoccupation with language talk these days about the use of language, and not just language itself. Who knows but what some day they will agree that language-as well as meaning-ex- ists only in the context of its being spoken and heard by-of all things-persons. And it is possible that objective relativism can still contribute to the philosophical rehabilitation of the person and his subjectivity without the gloom of Kierkegaard or the obscurity of Heidegger.
