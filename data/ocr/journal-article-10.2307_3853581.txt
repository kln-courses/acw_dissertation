<plain_text><page sequence="1">286 BIBLIOGRAPHY 1917-18: ANCIENT EGYPT BY F. LL. GRIFFITH, M.A. LETTERS have appeared in the newspapers urging that the British Government should give support to Egyptology, and in particular advocating the creation of a subsidised British Imperial Institute of Archaeology in Egypt. The present is a moment when the Empire must feel deeply its responsibility for the safety of the monumnents in Egypt, the scientific control of its exploitation and the recording and garnering of its marvellous treasures of art and history. A letter on this subject addressed to the Times by our President is reprinted on p. 217 of the Journal. The work of the Egypt Exploration Fund 1882-1918 is a brief review, in seven pages, with illustrations, of what the Society has accomplished in the thirty-six years of its existence. The publication of Ancient Egypt has been suspended since the end of 1917 owing to the war. The first volume of Oric BATES' Harvard African Studies is reviewed by SELIGMAN, Man, 1918, no. 44. May we express the hope that this promising enterprise will not be allowed to lapse, but may become what its lamented author evidently desired it should be, a permanent repository for research in a wide field aroun(l the great centres of early civilisation in Africa ? An influential committee at Khartoum, headed by Mr J. W. CROWFOOT, has founded a magazine entitled Sudan Notes and Records. The first number, which appeared in January 1918, contains interesting and valuable articles on the Ancient History (by REISNER), anthropology and natural history of that country. Subsequent numbers are not less valuable in their contents. Subscribers who send half-a-guinea to the Secretary, Sudan Notes and Records, Law Courts, Khartoum, will recognise that they are aiding a worthy enterprise, one which will improve our knowledge of a substantial portion of the British Empire and will help forward its scientific development. We may here call attention to FLINDERS PETRIE'S Eastern Exploration, Past and Future, three lectures delivered at the Royal Institution dealing with Jerusalem and Palestine, Syria and Mesopotamia; their historical importance at all periods; how to preserve their archaeological records; how to establish an efficient Department of Antiquities and satisfactory laws in regard to the handling of discoveries and treasure trove; and what pitfalls to avoid. In a report on repairs by BARSANTI at Sakk.areh (Serapeum, etc.), Thebes (Ramesseum and Tombs of the Kings) and Nubia (Abusimbel to Philae), it is stated that the relief in- scriptions reached by the reservoir water at Philae, etc., are doomed to gradually disappear, Ann. du Serv., XVIII, 8, 11, 14.

Prof. REISNER describes the results of his excavations of 1916 in the Barkal temples, giving in detail, with numerous plans, the architectural history of the rear part of the Great Temple, Journal, IV, 213: of the Meroitic temple 600 with reused blocks of Tuthmnosis IV: by the side of it was the larger temple 700, partly buried by a fall of cliff, which smashed it yet kept the fragments safe; here remains were found of a Meroitic portico (containing inter alia a statuette of Amenhotp III duly defaced by Akhenaton); the temple was founded by Atlanersa and added to by Senkamanseken. A paved roadway, short and curved, was found in front of 700, op. cit., v, 99. The Boston Museum publishes an illustrated account of REISNER'S discoveries in the Pyramids of Nufri, especially from the point of view of finds of objects and royal names. The former included a vast number of stone ushabtis of Tirhaka and faience ushabtis of Senkamanseken; the ancient plunderers, cruelly systematic though they were, had left behind several interesting specimens of work in gold and silver, besides commoner materials which they despised. Foundation deposits were discovered under the corners of most of the pyramids. The chief pyramid was that of King Tirhaka, surrounded by the small pyramids of many of the later queens: a little to the west stood the pyramnids of Tirhaka's fourteen successors down to Nastasen. Boston Mus. Bulletin, xvI, p. 67 (Oct. 1918). KURRU. A pyramid, on excavation, proved to be of late Ethiopian age; about another lay fragments of ushabtis of a king Piankhi whom Reisner identifies with Piankhi II; there are also grave tumuli.

In January to March 1918 three members of the Institut biblique Pontificale de Rome excavated a portion of the island, keeping careful record of the finds. Amongst the finds was a fragment of an Aramaic stele which seems to show an early type of writing. STRAZZULI, BOVIER-LAPIERRE and RONZEVALLE, Ann. dit Serv., XVIII, 1. THEBES. After sketching the history of the Thebais under the Romans, LEGRAIN describes the condition of Luxor and the progress of excavation there down to 1915, when the houses on the river bank to the west of the temple were expropriated. After this had been accomplished sebakh-digging was systematically permitted under inspection. The result has been the gradual uncovering of a Roman forum with monuments including two inscribed bases for columns dedicated to " Caesar" (perhaps Julian the Apostate) by Aurelius Ginus, prefect of the Thebais. LEGRAIN gives a plan of so much as had been cleared. Ann. du Serv., xvII, 49, also in Bull. Inst. Eg., v ser., I, 241. 287</page><page sequence="3">F. LL. GRIFFITH FOUCART publishes some frescoes discovered in clearances of tombs made by the French Institute in 1917. At Kurnet Murrai in tomb no. 16 of Amenem6net (Dyn. XIX) are unusual scenes of (1) the conveyance of the mnummy by four bearers, (2) the funerary cult of Amenophis III and queen Taia, and (3) offerings to king Menthotpe and queen Neferys (sic). In the last the queen's name is new; both king and queen are coloured black. A tomb of Dyn. XX near Der el-Medineh of a certain Khabekhonit, with worship of deceased kings as in a homonymous tomb long since known to science, gives a most remarkable scene in which a great mummied fish called abt is upon the bier tended by Anubis. This fish must be a symbol of Osiris and is the text for a long discussion of the origin of the Christian fish-symbol. A connexion is suggested with the fish as a symbol of Hathor or with the abdu fish of the Osirian mysteries. Bull. Inst. Eg., v ser., xi, 261. After an introduction by LYTHGOE, LANSING reports on the excavations at the palace of Amenophis III in 1916-17, when the work reached the northern limit, so that one more season would complete the exploration of this important site. Here a great court was revealed and at the west end the foundations of a pillared hall surrounded by chambers; this was identified by inscriptions on jars as having been built or at least used for the celebration of the second sed-festival of Amenophis III, which is now found to have taken place in his 34th year. DAVIES reports on the completed restoration and copying of the tomb of PuyemreC and figures an ideal reconstruction of one of the decorated doorways. He also illustrates a number of interesting and finely executed hieroglyphs and fragments of scenes from the tomb of Kenamuin, keeper of the cattle of Amun, whose magnificent sepulchre evidently suffered from the displeasure of his royal master Amenophis II.

FISHER notes that he arrived in Egypt on Dec. 15, 1915, the day when it became a British protectorate, in order to take up work for the Eckley B. Coxe expedition of the University of Pennsylvania. At Memphis, where a building with columns of Meneptah had been discovered, as well as colossi of Ramesses II, he began a large clearance which exposed the whole eastern wing of a palace of Meneptah with remains of numerous columns. The throne room could be identified by its sculptured dais; there were also recognised the vestibule, paved court with remains of painting, and small rooms at the 288</page><page sequence="4">BIBLIOGRAPHY: ANCIENT EGYPT back including bath room, the inscriptions inlaid with faience.

ERMAN gives the history of two obelisks originally designed to be erected in Rome, and prints and translates the inscriptions upon them. (1) The so-called Pamphylius of Domitian, the inscriptions of which follow the ancient Egyptian scheme; this obelisk was restored in the seventeenth century and the smaller fragments were replaced by imitations in which the injured hieroglyphs have been much distorted; ERMAN considers that it belonged to a temple of Isis which Domitian is reported to have built in Rome. (2) The obelisk of Antinous, of a more original and interesting character. The translation of this curious inscription shows a remarkable advance on that which the same scholar gave some 20 years ago; but the materials for establishing the text of each obelisk are still unsatisfactory.

REISNER is contributing to the Sudan Notes and Records a very instructive sketch of the history of the Sudan. The first section (vol. I, p. 3) treats of the periods before Dyn. XII, the second (p. 57) deals with the conquest by Dyn. XII and goes onward to the Hyksos period, the destruction of the Kerma fort at the Third Cataract marking the end of the first Egyptian occupation of the Sudan. The third (p. 217) deals with the Hyksos period and the New Kingdom. REISNER points out that the first province organised in the Empire of the New Kingdom was that of Wawat or Lower Nubia, in the reign of Amosis I. This section contains an estimate of the revenue derived from Kush and Wawat by Tuth- mosis III and a valuable list of the viceroys under the Empire. SETHE upholds his view that the words according to which Nefermaat was son of king Senefru by his eldest daughter Nefertkau are to be taken literally, Zeits.f. aegypt. Spr.,LIV, 54. MORET discusses the evidence regarding the administration of Egypt under Dyn. VI to be gathered from the inscription of Kara, nomarch of Edfu. On the strength of this he would interpret the tombstone records of generosity of the nomarchs as referring, not to any private generosity, but to their praiseworthy employment of public funds called per- det, Comptes Rendus, 1918, 105. REISNER proves beyond dispute by the inscriptions of two statues found in the great tumulus of Kerma at the Third Cataract that it was the burial place of Hepzefa, long known as the proprietor of the largest and most magnificent of the Siiut tombs and nomarch of the Lycopolite nome, but now revealed to us as governor of the south. In this light he reexamines the Siut tomb with its decoration and inscriptions and re-translates the long text of the ten contracts made with the Siut priests and officials for the service of his ka. He considers that there is evidence not only that the tomb was left unfinished, but also that considerable alteration took place in the plan of the decorations and inscriptions when Hepzefa received his appointment in Nubia. Journal, v, 79. 38-2 291</page><page sequence="7">F. LL. GRIFFITH WEILL supplements his study of the period between Dyn. XII and Dyn. XVIII by a full catalogue of the known kings and their monuments grouped according to the results of his researches, a table being prefixed to show the succession or parallelism of the eleven groups which he has formed. Weill attaches little importance to the order observed in the Turin Papyrus and other traditional documents, and bases his system mainly on the forms of the prenomens and personal names. For more than half of the period dealt with he shows two contemporary dynasties and for a brief space three, and he adheres to the "short chronology" of MEYER. Journal Asiatique, XI ser., t. ix, 193. GUNN and GARDINER re-translate all the texts relating to the expulsion of the Hyksos, with critical discussion of their historical value and import, Joturntal v, 36; also the in- scriptions of Sethos I in the temple of Wady Abbad (Redeslyeh) on the road from Edfu to the goldmines, op. cit., IV, 241, with photograph of the temple. DARESSY, describing the mummy of Meneptah and the history of his reign, throws serious doubt on the theory that he was Pharaoh of the Exodus; this event would rather have taken place in Dyn. XVIII.

The fifth volume of GAUTHIER'S Livre des Rois d'Egypte contains the names and titles of the Roman Emperors down to the latest of those found in hieroglyphic (Decius), including Greek demotic and Latin examples in abundance. It will be especially useful as bringing together the Egyptian and Graeco-Roman sources. The volume is complete in itself with indexes, and apparently the end of the whole of this voluminous and most useful under- taking has now been reached. [The unidentified name at the end of vol. v is evidently Nero, but apparently the examnple named, if genuine, was not included in HILTON PRICE'S Catalogue nor in the catalogue of his sale.] GEOGRAPHY. On the precise situation of the old town of Takinash, in Arabic Diqnash, DARESSY, Ann. du Serv., XVIII, 26. M. DARESSY has also published elsewhere many important remarks on the geographical names belonging to Middle and Lower Egypt, see above pp. 289-90. GARDINER discusses in detail the residences and temples named after Ramesses II and III, in connexion with the site of the Biblical store-city of Raamses and the Lower Egyptian capital of the Ramesside kings, Journal, v, 127, continuing with a chronological series of references to or descriptions of the great royal residence of the Ramesside kings in the Delta, translated from papyri and the monumnents, beginning with the eighth year of Ramesses II, op. cit., 179. The city-name usually read Gesem or Qesem, and equated with the Biblical Goshen, should in reality be read Shesmet. It seems to have belonged originally to the mining region of Sinai and was transferred to the capital of the Arabian nome owing to its connexion with the god Sopd, with whom Shesmet was associated in Sinai. GARDINER, Journal v, 218. 292</page><page sequence="8">BIBLIOGRAPHY: ANCIENT EGYPT Dr W. F. HUME gives a brief history of the city of Pelusium and its neighbourhood. As the key of Egypt it was usually the first goal of the invader. In 1118 it was burned by Baldwin I, king of Jerusalem, and it is mentioned in the crusading annals down to 1169, after which, though it still appeared on maps, it seems to have passed out of existence and is not referred to in the invasion of 1515, which gave the Turks possession of Egypt.

ELLIOT SMITH puts forth the theory that the use of incense and libations in worship must have originated in Egypt, where it was due to the attempt to preserve in its entirety the living body-its form, scent and suppleness-after death and to re-endow it with vitality; and that from this curious beginning, first pointed out by Dr BLACKMAN, it developed in Egypt and was widely spread abroad, especially in China.

DARESSY publishes a fragment of a statue in the Cairo Museum from Aswan, apparently of late period, with a non-Egyptian inscription, Ann. du Serv., XVII, 81. The writing on this is identified by Pere RONZEVALLE as Aramaic and discussed with another from the same source previously published by LIDZBARSKI.

RONZEVALLE criticises this, op. cit., 261. HOLLINGWORTH finds traces of revolt in Syria in the Egyptian records of Amenophis III and suggests that the Amarna tablets which refer to invasion and revolt belong to the early years of Amenophis III (who reconquered the country with the diplomatic aid of his minister Amenophis son of Paapis) rather than to the reign of Akhenaton.

WIENER examines the Egyptian and Biblical evidence for the date of the Exodus, associating the defeat of the Israelites by the Amorite in Deut. i, 43 et seqq. with the record of their enfeeblement in the stele of Meneptah. Bibliotheca Sacra, 1916, 154. From the Garden of Eden to the Crossing of the Jordan, by Sir Wm WILCOCKS, is a pamphlet full of fresh observations and inferences. Our great authority on Mesopotamian irrigation has formed on the spot, in Egypt as well as on the Tigris and Euphrates, a very clear view of an historic basis for the early Mosaic tradition. With the late Mr Cope- Whitehouse he places Avaris at Hawara, at the entrance of the Fayum, and there are doubtless other identifications which a scholar cannot admit; but the scholar cannot fail to profit from reading this suggestive essay. The last chapters, on the Plagues (rationalising the miraculous account in the Bible), the Passage of the Red Sea (located in Lake Serbonis as by Brugsch), and through the Wilderness and the Crossing of the Jordan, are reprinted (with corrections and additions) from the Bulletin of the Institut Egyptien, vol.

Unfortunately only the first two chapters and a fragment of the third exist, in which the alphabetic signs are divided into consonants proper, vowels, and sonants. No trace even of the plan for the continuation of the work is to be found, Gomptes Rendus, 1918, 167. A treatise of over 100 pages on the Nominal sentence in Egyptian of all periods in- cluding demotic and Coptic, a precise classification with numberless examples. SETHE, Der Nominalsatz im Agyptischen und Koptischen (Abh. Kon. Sdchsischen Gesells., Bd. xxxIII, no. III). In 1900 ERMAN explained the common verbal form sddmf as a participle with pronoun "hearing is he." In 1910 SETHE devoted a few sentences to explaining sdmnf and other related forms on similar lines: thus sdm-n-f hrw "to him is heard the voice" ="he has heard the voice," although when the form was well established it came to be used in ways at variance with its origin.

Beitrdge znum demotischen Worterbuche aus den Papyrus Insinger (Prag, 1916). Nubian. Professor SCHAXFER of the Berlin Museum has published a substantial memoir containing 230 pages of modern Nubian texts with translations and notes. In the intro- duction he sketches the work of his predecessors in recording the dialects and manners of the people of Nubia (beginning with CARREDORI'S vocabulary of 1650), and explains how he made his own collections. The latter consist of sentences, narratives, discussions and letters written by a remarkably intelligent native who has adopted Christianity and in the course of a varied life has enjoyed the advantages of a European training for mission work. In spite of all this SAMUEL, like the rest of his travelled countrymen (whose foreign ex- periences however are generally confined to Egypt), is devoted to his native sands and palms and is enthusiastic for his mother-tongue. Before 1902, while in the German Protestant mission at Aswan, he translated St Mark's Gospel into Nubian, writing it in Arabic characters, and from 1908 onwards has frequently aided SCHAFER and JUNKER in their linguistic studies in Nubia and in Berlin. Exclusive of remnants of the language in the Nuba hills of Kordofan and Darfur, there are two main linguistic divisions of Nubian in the Nile valley. To one belong the Kunuzi in the north about the First Cataract and the Dongolawi in the south about Dongola; the Kuniuzi and Dongolawi are separated from each other by the other division, the Mahas, spoken in the central portion between Korosko and the Third Cataract. Every village area however has its own peculiarities of sound and speech. SAMUEL belongs to the village of Abuhor, speaking a pure Kuncuzi dialect, and knows no other. The sentences and narratives spoken by him were written out in his presence by SCHAXFER in European characters; they deal with household life, marriage, agriculture, boating, buying and selling, religion, sickness, death, etc. and have the double purpose of philological illustra- tions and of displaying the life and occupations, manners and customs of that northernmost group of Nubians whose home is now so rudely flooded and destroyed by the great Nile dam. The accomplished editor has addressed himself to his task with enthusiasm and has produced a work which places our knowledge of this somewhat neglected dialect on a much sounder footing than before. He promises to give us a grammar of Kunuzi in the near future. H. SCHAFER, Nabische Texte im Dialekte der KunAzi (Mundart von AbAhor) Abhandl. of Berlin Acad., 1917, no. 5.

MAX MULLER of Philadelphia has written an interesting treatise on Egyptian mythology and religion, showing boldness of view and great learning in Egyptian and other texts. Full use is made of the pictorial representations of the deities, which in some cases represent the ideas of priests and people concerning the deities more fully than the texts. Numerous elaborate notes and a bibliography are appended, making it a useful work of reference. The Mythology of All Races, vol. xii, Egyptian by W. M. MULLER, Indo-Chinese by Sir J. G.

SETHE discusses the Introduction to chapter xcix of the Book of the Dead, containing the interesting spell for bringing the ferry boat. GRAPOW's edition of the difficult text comprises a translation, but SETHE corrects GRAPOW'S version in very important points and pretty certainly proves that the whole text is made up of four similar but independent spells which copyists in the Middle Kingdom linked together with slight modifications to improve the "fit," Zeits. f. aegypt. Spr., LIV, 1. Continuing, SETHE shows that when the hesitating ferryman objected that the deceased could not count his fingers, the latter proves his good education by counting them in ten sentences which rhyme in pairs. Rhyme had not previously been recognised in any form of Egyptian literature. The sentences play on the names of the successive numerals and refer in antique language to the treatment of the Eye of Horus by Thoth, ID., op. cit., 16. SETHE also discusses the first sentence of the important chapter xvii, the original form of which he traces in some early texts (with a slight but highly significant variant not noted by GRAPOW), proving that it bore the meaning: " to me belonged all, whereas I was alone "-very different from that attributed to it by later scribes and interpreters, namely "I am Atum who was alone," op. cit., 40. These articles of SETHE are of first-rate importance.

Dr BOESER has published two more parts, the ninth and tenth, of the great photo- graphic description of the Leyden collection, continuing the series of coffins of the New Kingdom. The former number is reviewed by GRIFFITH in Journal, IV, 283. The tenth part contains the coffin of Zemont (var. Zemontefonkh), a priest of Ammnon at Thebes, son of the priest Zekhons(efonkh). It may be attributed to Dyn. XXII or later, and is very elaborately decorated in good style with religious figures and inscriptions, the latter consisting mainly of prayers for the future existence of the deceased. (This fine coffin was elaborately figured by LEEMANS in the earlier publication of the Museum under the number M. 3, but his plates were very ill drawn.)

The Catalogue of Egyptian Antiquities of the New York Historical Society, published in 1915, gives an idea of the importance of the collection owned by that society, which in- cludes the fine though little known series of antiquities got together by Dr Abbott in Egypt towards the middle of the last century. Most of the catalogue consists of a reprint of Abbott's catalogue of 1854, but other smaller collections received at various dates are included, the chief of these being the Edwin Smith collection (1907), which amongst other rarities contains a medical papyrus of 22 pages, practically complete. Miss Caroline RANSOM (now Mrs Grant WILLIAMS), late of the Metropolitan Museum, New York, has undertaken to superintend the conservation and rearrangement of the Egyptian collections, and a catalogue raisonne is promised. As a sample of the collection Mrs WILLIAMS figures a statuette of a royal scribe named Senu, of a very rare and interesting funerary type found occasionally in the New Kingdom, in which the deceased is represented grinding corn, N.Y. Historical Society, Quarterly Bulletin, I, 34. In a second paper she describes the collection of ushabtis, which is now definitely arranged for exhibition, and figures several specimens of exceptional interest and beauty, op. cit., 91, and further publishes a selection from the bronze statuettes, viz. a " Soul of Pe," cow-headed Hathor, cat- and human-headed Bubastis, group of cat and kittens, throne of Harpocrates supported by lions with worshipper, and Harpocrates with case for amulet on ground in front; also a negro captive and a priest, op. cit., II, 43. The Metropolitan Museum has set aside a special room for the exhibition of objects illustrating the daily life of the Ancient Egyptians.

The deer and its congeners are discussed at some length by BPN1DITE, who shows that the Barbary deer vanishes early from the Egyptian monuments, while the Mesopotamian fallow deer takes its place.

They were probably gathered from far and wide by Ramesses II to adorn the temple of his residence at Tanis. Apart from this, the absence of stone quarries in the N.E. Delta makes a local school of sculpture very unlikely. Moreover the strongest type of " Hyksos" sculpture has been found in the Faytum and even as far south as El-Kab. Ann. du Serv., xvII, 164.

Zeits. f. aegypt. Spr., LIV, 140. Prof. PETRIE has published the catalogue of a very important section of the Egyptian collection at University College. Tools and weapons have been a favourite subject with the author from his earliest years of exploration. The objects treated of here are those in metal and wood; flint and stone weapons are reserved for another volume. The catalogue is illustrated by 2000 drawings of tools and weapons from all countries and in many collec- tions; it thus presents a view of the whole subject so far as it can affect Egypt. The text is very concise. A conclusion well brought out is that, so far as the evidence at present goes, the main Egyptian types in the several classes are found but little outside Egypt. Egypt and the surrounding countries had each its well-developed culture and style, and the patterns of tools in any one of them generally resisted the encroachment even of ad- vantageous features possessed by those of neighbouring countries. This is a fact which may be usefully remembered in discussing the history of invention and the spread of civilisation. Tools and Weapons, by W. M. Flinders PETRIE.
