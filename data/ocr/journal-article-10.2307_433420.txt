<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS IN HERDER'S THOUGHT. V Chap. III HERDER'S PSYCHOLOGY Every historic epoch embodies a new and particular philosophy of life. It has, as it were, an individual character and mind by which it differs essentially from every other epoch. The representative literary and artistic products of an epoch comprise all its higher efforts to interpret its personality and char- acter. Historic literature and art, as the authentic expression of the fundamental intentions, the creative impulses and ideas, the integral soul, of a collective individuality, therefore must be in a large sense always didactic. The great movements in literature, those of the Old and the New Testaments, of the Greek Classical Age, and thence down to the ages of Shakespeare, of Corneille, Racine and Moliere, of Herder, Goethe and Schiller, have been consciously and deliber- ately embodiments of distinctive historic generalizations concern- ing the foundations of life. A historic literary utterance is, then, saturated with a character- istic theory of reality. Now, in analyzing and generalizing the his- torical and philosophical relations in which this saturation becomes both effective and expressive, one is forced to make, not indeed abso- lute and irrevocable choice, but primary and specific distinction between two modes of procedure: the rationalistic or absolutistic and the genetic or relativistic. The former is deductive, the latter inductive. Historical Rationalism, contending that general terms are primary, would place the most abstract expression of a conception of reality at the foundation of all the manifestations of the spirit of an epoch. The genetic-inductive view, on the other hand, of which Herder is the leading modern representative, seeks the fundamental factors of reality in the concrete individual data, and regards all gener- alizations, whether they be abstractive or collective, as secondary. [MODERN PHILOLOGY, August, 1923] 29</page><page sequence="2">30 MARTIN SCHtTZE The theory of reality, characteristic of this view, would not have the absolute force of a primary and mandatory law, but merely the relative validity of a summary; it would be limited by its concrete content, which is its primary substance. The conflict between Nominalism and Realism, though its terms have partly exchanged, partly modified, their original meanings, is still as fundamental and irreconcilable as it was in the Middle Ages. The age of Herder, Goethe, and Schiller was a true epoch. It developed an original and characteristic conception of reality, both synthetically, in its collective conduct and creative utterance, and analytically, in its theoretic formulations. The latter were completed in the critical conclusions of Herder. The former attained their historic features most consummately in Goethe's, and next to him, in Schiller's literary creations. Both suffered a progressive decay in the egocentric vagaries of the Romantic movement. Herder's theory of individuality developed from a new analysis and combination of the primary factors of reality. By his conception of personality as specific, total, organic unity of mechanism and spontaneity, he created the distinctive focus by which the view of reality embodied in his Age is fundamentally determined. The historical result of this new perspective was a final clarifica- tion of a turmoil of philosophical ideas, the range and complexity of which had not been equalled probably since the later days of antique Athens. The multitude of questions, which had agitated the philosophical mind of the Renaissance, were now all seen to be variations of the one main problem of the relations of spontaneity and mechanism. It was now understood that that problem had underlain the historic revolt of individualism against every form of external restraint, whether that restraint took the form of absolute ecclesiastical authority or of absolute universal reason, of absolute mechanistic or "automatic" determination, or of absolute subjecti- vistic fatality; or of any of the innumerable local or otherwise relative forces of coercion controlled by the institutions inherited from the past. Herder was indefatigable in assembling all the principal historical ideas, and incomparably sagacious in seizing upon their specific relations to the main problem. Gradually and abundantly, he constructed the main parts of the conception of reality which has dominated the modern view of history.</page><page sequence="3">THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS IN HERDER'S THOUGHT 31 By basing reality primarily on his organic conception of person- ality, Herder brought about a revision of the philosophical prob- lem of reality. He drew that problem from its sovereign isolation of absolute metaphysical objectivity ("Ding an sich") and subor- dinated it to the characters of concrete genetic individuality. He reversed the traditional, rationalistic approach to the foundations of reality by substituting inductions based on demonstrated data for the deductions of formal logic. He established thereby the depend- ence of any theory of reality upon empirical psychology. When, in Kant's attempted reconstruction of Rationalistic absolutism, the principles of formal logic, the "pure forms" of thought, vested with the authority of "Pure Reason," were sublimated into super- empirical premises, primary beyond any conceivable degree of pri- macy, absolute beyond any conceivable projection of absoluteness, eternal beyond any conceivable extensions of time, space and validity --into infinitely primary, absolute, and eternal premises--of all pos- sible perception, Herder, in his controversy with Kant, formulated the fundamental arguments on which rests to this day the case of demonstrable knowledge against rationalistic speculation.' THE PHILOSOPHICAL ANTECEDENTS OF HERDER'S PSYCHOLOGY2 Herder's fundamental conception is the historic synthesis of the ideas of two centuries and more, concerning a genetic view of the primary factors of reality. A survey, in which these ideas will be brought into the perspective of Herder's theory, will not only reveal new and interesting aspects of well-known generalizations, but will change many traditional definitions and shift many points of empha- sis. The principal types of philosophy entering essentially into Herder's conception of man as an organic unity of spontaneity and mechanism, can be comprehensively grouped as follows: As to the theological tradition, Augustine's conception of per- sonality and the relation of man to God was dominant, essentially unchanged in the Catholic, and but slightly changed by Luther's protestant-individualistic doctrine in the Protestant, world. Herder I This controversy will be the subject of the last chapter of this study. 2 Cf. for the periods of the history of philosophy covered by the following account.

This, the theologi- cal relation of Herder's ideas, will be discussed in the next chapter. The philosophical antecedents proper of Herder's psychology form a multitude of ideas that at first sight seem to defy orderly arrangement. It is possible, however, to group them in three prin- cipal movements, namely, the deductive-dialectic-absolutistic doc- trine of Rationalism, beginning with the system of Descartes, and its two opposites, namely "Empiricism" and the theory of "feeling," "Gefiihl." Empiricism rests on the assumption that not abstract "a priori" ideas or "universals" are the primary factors of knowl- edge, but the concrete data of sense perception, and that abstract ideas, all truth and knowledge, are derived from these. Induction, instead of deduction, is the logical method, and relativity, specific perspective, the measure of validity, pertaining to Empiricism. The two principal types of empiricism between the age of Descartes and that of Herder were the "natural" or physical sciences, which attained a phenomenal development both in range and method; and the various types of formal psychology grouped under "Association- ism." Science, by constantly improving the technique of demonstra- tion and induction, ultimately absorbed all the other branches of empiricism. The theory of "feeling," "Gefiihl," is founded upon the belief in the primacy of immediate, integral, inward sensibility or " Geftihl." "Gefiihl" was conceived as the total essence of individual being, both in knowledge and in action. The doctrine of "Gefiihl" was in all its phases the specific theoretical expression of the movement of individ- ualism. The extreme, religious form of this theory was religious mysticism. Beside these three principal movements, a few words will have to be said about the various notions of reality, forming spurious com- pounds of the three fundamental conceptions, which are grouped under the name "Aufkliirung." I. RATIONALISM Descartes The modern form of philosophical curiosity concerning the rela- tions obtaining between mechanism and spontaneity begins with Descartes. Taking over the characteristic medieval dualism of the</page><page sequence="5">THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS IN HERDER'S THOUGHT 33 flesh and the spirit, but discarding its animistic-moralistic purport, he arrived at the purely intellectualistic opposition of mind and matter, which is an essential premise of all subsequent rationalistic theories of reality. Descartes, following Augustine,' based his theory of reality on the immediate subjective certainty of existence inherent in consciousness. "Cogito, ergo sum." Consciousness is the primary reality. What- ever is " clearly and distinctly" perceived through conCciousness must be innate in the mind, i.e., primarily real. Descartes defines as "clear and distinct" all that is distinguished from something else and defined by analytical discrimination. Consciousness is thus identified with the ratiocinative reason operating on the subjects furnished by "intuition," i.e., with the deductive or syllogistic pro- cess of thought. This reason is, according to Descartes, the "lumen naturale," the reason governing man, and in his world and for him ruling as the supreme and absolute principle of truth. However, it is the light only of "nature," of finite being. Beyond it and wholly incomprehensible to it, is the mind of God, the absolutely absolute, the "ens perfectissimum." This human reason, which he named "res cogitans," the thinking reality, was to him one part of reality. The other was all that was not conscious. This he called "matter." He defined it by its most universal attribute of spatial extension, as "res extensa." Matter then consists, according to Descartes, of bodies that can be reduced to quantity. These are the two primary realities. Both are absolute; the one, living, free, spontaneous; the other, dead, mechanical or, as Descartes called it, "automatic." Owing to his limitation of consciousness to ratiocination, he had to exclude all living beings below man, even the highest animals, from the living reality. Animals were forms of "res extensa," "automata." They had no "souls." The origin of Rationalism is thus subjective and empirical. It was only by a blind leap that Descartes passed over the gulf separ- ating the introspective inference, on which his primary assumption rested, from the doctrine of an absolute, deductive, metaphysical reason, the validity of which was prior to empirical reality and unlim- 1 Herder also accepted Augustine's first premise. See "Dber Erkennen und Emp- flnden," in the following number.</page><page sequence="6">34 MARTIN SCH{tTZE ited by concrete experience. This miraculous transition is the para- dox at the core of all rationalism. Descartes was not aware that he had not proceeded from the one to the other by a proper philosophical bridge. It was the dominant intellectual conviction of his age that the laws of the syllogism as embodied in mathematics were the one avenue by which absolute and eternal truth penetrated uncorrupted and uncurtailed into the concrete experience of man. Logic, as far as it was sustained by mathematics, was regarded as absolute and eter- nal. By limiting consciousness to that which was perceived "clare et distincte," i.e., by identifying the spontaneous, or as it was then called, the "immaterial" part, or the soul, of man with the processes of mathematical logic, Descartes and his contemporaries and fol- lowers felt justified in assuming that consciousness, although itself the conceptual product of concrete inductive analysis by means of introspection, was yet the agent of absolute and universal reason. This fundamental identification of the inward limits of empirical consciousness with Absolute Reason is essential to historical Rational- ism. Rationalism as such is not restricted to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is one of a few fundamental frames of mind, of a few primary types of outlook on reality, which transform and succeed one another in response to changes in the complex physical and mental environment to which human society is unceasingly subject. It is not necessary here to analyze in detail the concrete historical environment of which Descartes' system of Rationalism was the abstract expression. Obviously not only the vast enhancement of man's confidence in his particular powers and importance, an enhance- ment that inevitably attended the phenomenal inventions and dis- coveries, which had ushered in the Renaissance; but also the political, social, and, not least, the ecclesiastical conditions prevailing in his own country, which attained to the most intense form of centralized absolutism in: governmental and administrative organization, con- ditioned inevitablyiboth the centralization, and the confidence in the absolute authority, of the human reason, which form the fundamental character of Descartes' system. With Descartes modern Rationalism attained its typical expres- sion. The history of ideas since the time of Descartes has been, in</page><page sequence="7">THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS IN HERDER'S THOUGHT 35 its negative aspect, the record of the gradual retreat of Rationalism before an ever greater mass of assailants arising in every quarter of thought, from Rationalism itself to its extreme opposites of empiricism and emotionalism. This retreat has given the most interesting mod- ern instance of the type of curve, with its characteristic variations and temporary checks and accelerations, in which the philosophical mind, yielding both to the pressure of its historical environment and to its own spontaneous rhythm, swings from one theoretic limit to another. Rationalism is in principle the belief in a Reason which is human yet immaterial, absolute, primary, universal, transcending the limi- tations of concrete perception. Reason is conceived as the perfect organ of formal logic. The "soul" is the "locus" of Reason, and likewise immaterial, absolute, primary. It is "res cogitans." It has only one function: formal logic. It is an abstract personifica- tion of the principle of formal logic; formal logic endowed with spon- taneous motion. Reason, then, is life, spontaneity. Spontaneity is therefore immateriality. Everything material, "res extensa," quantity, is the opposite of life, soul, spontaneity. In regarding spontaneity as no more than formal logic in motion, Rationalism divorces it from individuality. In such a deductive absolutism, individuality is not merely a secondary, but a disturbing factor. In as far as it is at variance with the universality of formal logic, i.e., in as far as it is primary, just in so far it must be judged a partial negation, a limitation, not the positive principle, the source, of reason. The principles of individuality and logistic absolutism are incompatible. In an absolutistic conception, be it of the state, of society, of per- sonal conduct, of aesthetic values, forms and rules, of humanity, of faith, and ultimately, in its most abstract form, of reality as such, individuality, particular personality, is a delinquency, a disloyalty, a principle of sedition, immorality, barbarism, heresy, ugliness, and ultimately, unintelligence. In the absolutistic conception of the state, the citizen, the pri- mary active embodiment of sovereignty, sinks to the status of the subject, whose first duty is conformity and obedience to universal authority.</page><page sequence="8">36 MARTIN SCH{UTZE In aesthetic theory Rationalism manifested itself as neo-Classi- calism, the "Classicism" or "Pseudo-Classicism," which attained its highest development and most expansive power in the rationalistic century in France, and was not expelled from German literature till the last generation of the eighteenth century. Subordination of individual impulse, perception, standard of form, fitness, beauty, value in general, temperament, will, mind, character; to formal ratiocinative deductions and universal rules, is the essential character- istic of pseudo-classical aesthetics. The rationalistic standard of beauty is the uniform and mandatory rule derived from a supreme universal faculty of truth, a deductive "causa sui," a metaphysical fountainhead of authority-an abstraction which attempts once more the feat of lifting itself out of the concrete-the overwhelmingly con- crete!-by its boot straps. From the identification of ratiocination with reality, it follows that Rationalism must conclude that logical distinction is identical with essential difference. Rationalism is an absolute, deductive atomism. It must interpose an absolute gulf between each two primary units of definition. Continuity, synthetic unity, is for it negative; the infinitesimal limit of a series of diminishing distances. In its psychology, therefore, Rationalism is compelled to inter- pret the "soul" in an atomistic, formal manner. It is bound to an absolutistic conception of "faculties of the soul," or, in Kant's tau- tological expression, "Grundkriifte der Seele." As many forms of the process of logic, as many "faculties." Reason, intuition, memory, comparison, distinction, and so forth, become each a different mental unit. Rationalism can conceive of each faculty only as something abso- lutely simple, enclosed in an absolutely thought-tight compartment, from which it mysteriously issues its inscrutable decrees. The more the mind's activities and functions become known and defined, the more it comes to resemble, in the rationalistic view, a honeycomb of such thought-tight cells. The more rationalistic psychology pro- gresses, the farther it must recede from the conception of a positive unity of the mind. Descartes distinguished two primary sources of truth: human consciousness interpreted as ratiocinative deduction from intuition; and divine revelation, removed absolutely beyond the analysis even</page><page sequence="9">THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS IN HERDER'S THOUGHT 37 of reason. Intuition meant to him a perception exclusively inward. Every other form of mental process, i.e., every form of consciousness which was not ratiocinative, was considered as mechanistic, or in the Cartesian term, "automatic." Reason, "lumen naturale," was thus an absolute intellectual reality, which had nothing in common with the divine spirit, on the one hand, and with "matter," on the other. Descartes' dualistic assumption of mind and matter as two substances involved the con- clusion that there could be no direct relations between them. For two "substances" cannot have any character in common. In order to bridge this absolute chasm, Descartes resorted to the expedient of assuming the universal and miraculous mediation of God. This supreme deus ex machina, removed from all human analysis into the sphere of religious faith, served Descartes also as a shield against the suspicions of the church. As every speculative makeshift, so this attempt to unite two absolutely disparate substances by a third one, had fatal theoretic consequences. Descartes' rationalistic successors of the eighteenth century, forgetting the absolute, substantive differences of which Descartes was always aware, even though he blurred them by his divine intermediary, proceeded on the assumption that the gap between Reason and Matter had been properly filled, i.e., that unity of mind and external reality had been achieved. This unity they interpreted in this manner, that every event of the commonest sort could be converted directly into a generalization, and that each generalization, no matter how shallow and flimsy, how common and irrelevant, how temporary or local in substance, was an expression of "Absolute and Eternal Reason." The rule of the "Common- sense," the "Aufklidrung," the platitudinous, pragmatic, utilitarian mediocrity of the eighteenth century, a caricature, indeed, of true Rationalism, could trace through Descartes' "deus ex machina," one line of descent to the doctrine of absolute "Reason." Descartes was brought up in the Augustinian tradition, which was and still is dominant in the orthodox forms of Christian theology, and found it natural to accept Augustine's belief in a personal God who maintains constant, direct, and efficient though incomprehen- sible contact with the temporal world. Yet Augustine's conception was essentially disparate from the one inherent in Descartes' Rational-</page><page sequence="10">38 MARTIN SCHtuTZE ism. Augustine's doctrine had marked the decisive departure of medieval theology from the more abstract classical Greco-Christian theology. The Greek idea of God was primarily the logistic one of absolute universal truth, of ideas of Reason. This classical logistic tradition has left distinct traces in the Gospel of John.' Augustine's idea, on the other hand, was the dynamic conception of absolute will. He carried it consistently to the point of complete subjection of the human will to the ceaseless active causation of the will of God, which he formulated in his theory of predestination. It was only in this manner, in the identification of will with the principle of reality, that Augustine could maintain the unity of reality which he had won in his hard inward and outward struggle with Manichaeism. But he had to postulate not Reason but Faith as the primary source of knowledge. Descartes, on the other hand, based all knowledge on Reason. His position was not dynamic, but logistic. Augustine's conception of the rule of God in the temporal world, which was consistent with his system of faith, became a makeshift and an evasion in Descartes' system of Reason. Spinoza Spinoza started with the Cartesian dualism of mind and matter, "res cogitans," and "res extensa." But he drew the new and impor- tant conclusion that since neither could affect the other in any way, neither could be conceived as standing even in the relation of pri- ority of time or cause to the other. The apparent connection between the two can be interpreted only as a parallelism, which has to be accepted as a fact. This parallelism seems to point to Leibniz's pre-established harmony. Concluding further that God, as the only absolute substance, cannot be dual, and must therefore contain both the principles of mind and extension in absolute unity, i.e., not only so that the two in God cease to be different, but so that all the "moduses" in which the two principles have being, i.e., the infinite moduses of any possible reality, must be not merely the attributes but in their totality the substance itself of God; or, in other words, that God cannot be conceived as a separate being, as the creator of all things, as solely "natura natu- I Carl Weizsitcker, Das apostolische Zeitalter der christlichen Kirche, 2d ed. (Freiburg, B., 1892), pp. 513 if., especially 532-38.</page><page sequence="11">THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS IN HERDER'S THOUGHT 39 rans," but as the universal essence of all things. "Natura naturans" and "natura naturata" are in Him one. The relation of God to nature is not that of cause and effect in any derivative sense, but that of the triangle to its attributes-absolutely inherent. God is all, both positive and negative. This absolute logical pantheism is Spinoza's attempt to overcome the metaphysical aspect of Descartes's dualism. It is the essential opposite of Augustine's and Descartes's (and also Luther's) doctrine of the active personality of God, which in Spinoza's logic would appear as merely an anthropomorphic embodiment of some particular "modus" of empirical being, of a personification of some particular form of will, and by that specializa- tion be excluded from the very essence of the divine substance, the totality of all the moduses of being. The orthodox persecution of Spinoza and the charge of atheism leveled against him are readily understood. God is thus, according to Spinoza, both the totality itself of the infinity of the "moduses" of mind and the totality of the infinity of the moduses of matter, in absolute inconceivable identity. Each individual human mind must therefore be a modus of God. Now, a less acute mind than that of Spinoza would have concluded from this, as many followers of Spinoza did, that therefore each individual mind, each soul, was a participant in God. This was actually the conclusion of Malebranche, who postulated God as the "Raison Universelle," and interpreted that term as the "locus" of all finite minds. He meant by it that the essence of each individual mind could not be individual but must be of the mind of God himself. This assumption leads to the conclusion that by virtue of its "participation" the indi- vidual mind would attain to identity with God through intuition. Malebranche's conception has the identity of the individual with the divine mind in common both with the earliest Renaissance philos- ophies of nature, which culminated in Giordano Bruno's cosmic vital- ism, and with the even more personalistic tradition of late medieval and early Renaissance Christian mysticism, represented by Meister Eckhart and Johannes Tauler. The difference between the latter two groups lies chiefly in this, that the naturalistic philosophy stressed more the cosmic, the mystical doctrines more the divine nature of the all-inclusive spirit. In the former this supreme spirit was rather a personification of the universe, an animistic vision of</page><page sequence="12">40 MARTIN SCHiJTZE the cosmos. The macrocosm was the chief symbol of Bruno's poetical pantheism. In Christian Mysticism, on the other hand, the universal cosmic perspective was lost in the visionary conception of complete ecstatic surrender to the ubiquitous, all-pervasive and all-peractive, spirit of God. These two conceptions found a historic synthesis in Jakob Boehme's panpsychistic vision of the universe as the organic body of the divine spirit. It was the addition of the organic char- acter, embodied in his symbol of the living world-tree, in his "Aurora," which made his combination of the early nature pan- vitalism and the mystical panspiritualism possible, and built the bridge between his age and that of the psychistic monism of the German Romantic Movement. It was this panpsychistic tradition together with, but predominating over, the more rationalistic con- ception of totalistic intuition (on which rested Malebranche's doc- trine of "universal reason," and "participation)," grafted upon the native tradition of Puritanical religious mysticism, which produced the movement of "transcendentalism" in America.' Goethe's early nature pantheism, as it appears in "Ur-Faust" and the philosophic poems of his pre-Weimar period, was dominated, his acquaintance with the Christian mysticism of the Herrenhuter notwithstanding, by the pananimism of the nature mythology of Paracelsus, the subsequent pan-vitalism of the early nature philosophy which culminated in Bruno, and the naturalistic individualism of the eighteenth century. It was not until about 1800, after the rise of Schelling, that Goethe yielded decisively and in considerable measure to the Romantic panpsychism.2 Spinoza avoided the confusion of the two spheres of empirical and metaphysical reality by applying to them the mathematical prin- ciple of the incommensurability of the finite and the infinite. This principle had been introducdd into metaphysics first by the German bishop, Nicolaus Cusanus (of Kues, near Trier), who lived in the fifteenth century. He represents one of the principal stages in the transformation of the medieval into the modern mind. By using this principle as a criterion for the essential difference between the universal and the individual, and thus fundamentally transforming 1 Cf. Emerson's " Oversoul." 2 See my introduction to my edition of Goethe's Poems (Ginn &amp; Co.), pp. lxi-lxx; and my forthcoming study on Faust and Wilhelm Meister.</page><page sequence="13">THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS IN HERDER'S THOUGHT 41 the scholastic controversy between the "Realists" and the "Nominal- ists," he gave to the awakening spirit of the Renaissance its first philo- sophical and theological means of safeguarding individualism against the authoritarianism and universalism of the orthodox "Realists." Spinoza, following Cusanus, concluded that the human soul can be only the mental entity corresponding to the physical entity of man, but cannot be identical, can have no essential part or connection, with the infinite mind. The human mind is, according to him, no more than the "idea," in the sense of the absolutely separate immaterial parallel, of the human body both of the individual man and of the generality of men. The relations between man and God, then, must be, according to Spinoza, those of a totality cut in half by the logical incommen- surability of the finite and the infinite. Each individual is one of the infinite number of moduses, which in their absolute totality are God. But the reciprocal relation, characteristic of the personalistic conception of totality, in which the whole is inherent in each of its moduses or parts, is excluded. It was Spinoza's uncompromising Rationalism, his strict adher- ence to the identification of mind with ratiocination, which forced this schism in his conception of the unity of all things. The concep- tion of every part containing the whole is itself commensurable only with an uncompromising monism. Historically, it has been par- ticularly the psychistic monism of the Romantic view, which has developed without qualifications the reciprocally identical relations of part and whole. This conception acquired, in the Romantic minds, an extraordinary facility in the manipulation of that identity in all its principal applications, in religious, ethical, aesthetic, or generally cosmic, transcendentalism. However, a mechanistic monism, as was shown by its represen- tatives in the nineteenth century, also encounters no insuperable difficulties in an imaginative vision of reciprocal, mechanistic iden- tities between finite and infinite, empirical and absolute, "forces." Nor would a consistently empirical or hypothetical dualism find it impossible to accept evidence of reciprocal relations of totality between finite things and things real yet not demonstrably finite. It is only a dualism postulated as absolute, i.e., Rationalism, which must consistently stop at the gulf revealed by Spinoza.</page><page sequence="14">42 MARTIN SCHUiTZE There are, however, contained in Spinoza's absolutistic formula- tions, some ideas and suggestions which were to develop into impor- tant factors in the overthrow of Rationalism. Each individual, according to Spinoza, being one of the infinite moduses of God, must live to the full extent of all his powers. He must not set himself aims which are in conflict with his nature. For his soul, being only the soul of his body, must be fundamentally in harmony with the latter. Asceticism, suppression of natural impulses, purposiveness which would do violence to the natural character, is evil. Further, each being, as a mode of absolute God, must, if true to himself, be complete and perfect within himself, and so absolute and, formally, eternal. The perfect is beyond time, which is change. This idea influenced deeply the ethical and aesthetic thought of the age of Herder and Goethe. It finds beautiful expression in the lines of Goethe's "Das Gattliche:" Nur allein der Mensch Vermag das Unm6gliche. Er kann dem Augenblick Dauer verleihen. These three ideas of the duty of the individual to live himself out to the full range of his nature; of the duty not to set himself aims but to understand and obey the fundamental demands of his nature, i.e., to view all the operations of life, as Goethe says,i "zweck- los"; and of the identity of perfection with eternity, were, indeed in modified forms, among the most vital parts of the later anti-rational- istic theories of spontaneity and individuality, in which the German classical movement was partly rooted. The doctrine of the native goodness, the primary divinity of the natural man, the deification of spontaneous impulse, which was the central teaching of eighteenth- century Naturalism, was original with Rousseau only in as far as it substituted an opposite principle, that of "feeling," for the rational- 1 " Wilhelm Meister's Lehrjahre, Bk. 11, chap. 2. The motivation, particularly of the first four books of the Lehrjahre, which is a fundamental concrete embodiment of the necessity of obeying the "dunkle Drang," the obscure spontaneous impulse of one's nature, is a comprehensive application of Spinoza's doctrine transformed, in accordance with eighteenth-century naturalism, into an expression of an anti-rationalistic conception of reality. For a detailed discussion see my forthcoming study of Faust and Wilhelm Meister.</page><page sequence="15">THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS IN HERDER'S THOUGHT 43 istic principle of ratiocination as the primary motive and standard of spontaneity and individuality. Despite, or perhaps rather in consequence, of the extreme ration- alism of his methods and formulations, Spinoza, by his implied doc- trine of the passive autonomy of the principle of individuality, deprived Rationalism of much of its substance. But even the rem- nant proved irksome to an age which had become intensely inter- ested in the world about it, which, as it were, was awakening from a sleep that had darkened its senses for centuries, and was experiencing something of the ecstacy of men opening their eyes on the first morning of the world. This generation was not satisfied with mediate ways of contact with a world of which they felt themselves intensely and intimately part. The rationalistic dualism of mind and matter; the helpless attitude of Rationalism toward the problem of how that world outside could get into this world within, a helplessness of which Descartes' continuous and miraculous intercession of God, or Spi- noza's equally miraculous parallelism were obvious disguises; the dogmatic condemnation of this living, glowing, life-sustaining world of "facts," which the naive mind found it impossible to distinguish from abstract "matter," to primal lifelessness- all these "realities" of Rationalism faded into shadows before the sense-intoxicated vision of the new generation. 2. EMPIRICISM Sense-ism, Science, Associationism The inductive method of empiricism had been established by Bacon. It has remained the method of science. By applying, though in a very rudimentary and partial form, this method to the problem of the source of knowledge, Locke became the founder of empirical psychology. Locke's teaching, especially in the forms which it took among his followers, was called by English writers "Sensualism." The odious connotation of this term, which may have pleased the partisan feelings of its rationalistic adversaries, and of the more "idealistic" of its adherents among the associationists, renders the term unjust and misleading. The term "Sense-ism," preferred among the French writers of the eighteenth century, is more correct.</page><page sequence="16">44 MARTIN SCHuiTZE The sense-istic movement took a great variety of forms, which are at times difficult to define, except by their common aim of seeking the source of knowledge in the senses. All sense-istic theories are bound to the empirical method of approaching reality through con- crete evidence. They can, however, be divided into two main groups. The scientific group developed the inductive-quantitative method and technique of demonstration, and came more and more to inter- pret psychological processes as physiological functions. It inclined in its progress more and more toward the mechanistic hypothesis. The extreme wing of this group, the mechanistic monists, turned the hypothesis into an absolute doctrine. The other group interpreted psychological processes as typical associative manifestations of inner faculties. Its methods and technique were introspective and qualitative. It created the move- ment called Associationism. In the final outcome, the scientific movement prevailed. Sense- ism was absorbed by physiological psychology. Locke The founder of associationistic sense-ism is Locke. He attacked the rationalistic dualism through a criticism of the empirical content of consciousness. The soul at birth, he assumed, has no content, but is as a sheet of white paper "void of characters." There are no "innate principles" in the mind, neither theoretical nor practical principles, not even the idea of God. It can be proved by concrete evidence that there is no "consensus gentium " on any principle. All the ideas then are acquired by the soul after birth. Locke divided ideas into two classes, the "simple" and the "complex" "ideas." The simple "ideas" have as their sources "sensation," or outer perception, and "reflexion," or inner perception. The former precedes the latter.' The "complex," i.e., abstract ideas, "made by the mind out of simple ones," the products of reasoning, 1 Hume amended Locke's terminology by naming the former's simple ideas "impres- sions," and limiting, the term "idea" to Locke's "complex" ideas. Otherwise, Hume's scepticism, which is chiefly a criticism of the logical methods of rationalistic epistemology, has no direct bearing on our problem of the relations between spontaneity and mechanism. Berkeley's "objective idealism," as it is called by Kant also can be left out of account. Berkeley indeed denied all objectivity, placing reality wholly within the mind. But by subjecting the operations of this mind in turn to the demonstrable "laws of nature," he left the problem of the relations of spontaneity and mechanism really unchanged except in so far as he supported in principle the scientific method of induction and demonstration.</page><page sequence="17">THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS IN HERDER'S THOUGHT 45 are, like reflection, as to their content primarily based on sensation but presuppose certain "faculties of the soul," such as memory, combina- tion, distinction, comparison. Every general idea receives its par- ticular meaning, not from an absolute reason which functions through "intuition," but from the concrete data which it summarizes. Locke undertook to develop a system of "signs," especially those of language, for ascertaining the real meanings and relation of ideas. Locke's assumption removed the rationalistic conception of mat- ter from the problem of knowledge. The "mind," consisting wholly of associative sense processes, can contain nothing except sense "ideas," i.e., the various types of forms assumed by sense data in accordance with the formal nature of the mind. But it was inevi- table that a movement of such historical importance and extent, as Rationalism, kept for a long time a hold on important departments of thought, even among its principal adversaries. Locke retained, as is apparent, essential rationalistic ways of thought. But he restricted Rationalism to the most general conceptions of formal logic. Des- cartes' "lumen naturale," the absolute generator of ideas, shrank to Locke's "light of nature," the mere agent of formal logic.' But though Locke by annexing rationalistic "matter" to the inner reality of his "ideas," rejected the dualism of "matter" and mind, he was compelled to assume an objective principle of reality, which he called "facts" and by which he judged conclusions. Here lies the sense-istic root of the "Aufklarung," the commonsense doctrine of immediate certitude, which made part of the thought of the latter eighteenth century a bog of smugness, platitude, and mental inertia. Locke's attack on Rationalism was limited to the "contents" of the mind. These, which Descartes had assumed as made, so to speak, of the stuff of Reason, had, according to Locke, a purely empirical origin and had to be accepted as given. But as to the functions of the mind, they were assumed by Locke in essential agreement with Rationalism, to be those of formal logic. However, the logic essential to Rationalism, was deductive, whereas that essential to empiricism is inductive. The empiricist has to begin every mental process with an analysis of concrete data, whereas the Rationalist assumes that the primary data are inherent in the reason.

The material part of the Rationalistic reality becomes, in Locke's conception, personalistic. Locke's empiricism involves a modification of the conception of spontaneity. In strict Rationalism spontaneity is identical with Reason, i.e., formal logic. In Locke's empiricism, the emphasis falls on the perceptual function. The logistic part becomes subordinate. The individualistic essence of spontaneity is beginning to emerge. Leibniz It is customary to count Locke's great critic, Leibniz, the mathe- matician and statesman, among the Rationalists. And in a general history of philosophy he would belong largely among them. For in his formulations, reality is determined by ratiocinative logic, i.e., the soul is subordinate to reason, and his primary data are absolutes. But in an account of the conceptions of the relations between spon- taneity and mechanism, and particularly of the progress of those conceptions toward that of organic unity, the later works of Leibniz, the "Monadology " and the "New Essays," are of decisive importance. The "New Essays" were the product of his critical study of Locke's essay, and of his attempt to fit his conception of the "monad" to Locke's empiricism. Leibniz is therefore here more properly grouped with Locke. While in his earlier theoretical formulations he followed the rationalistic tradition and technique, with the substance of his later ideas he battered as wide a breach into Rationalism as did Locke. Leibniz shifted the entire problem of reality from that of knowl- edge toward that of activity. In his view, spontaneity is not, as in strict Rationalism, including Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, limited to the initiation of the ratiocinative process, but endowed with the universal dynamic function of serving as the first active cause to every part of life. Noting that acting is a more general expression of life than "thinking," he concluded that not "res cogitans" but "Kraft," power, or better, specific energy, is the primary factor of life and the essence of the "soul." In estimating the values of this "Kraft," however, Leibniz followed the rationalistic tradition. "Kraft" is subject to the formal judgment of deductive logic.</page><page sequence="19">THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS IN HERDER'S THOUGHT 47 Leibniz retained Descartes' distinction of "clear" and "distinct," "klar" and "deutlich." But he modified these terms in accordance with his conception of the primary unit of "Kraft." An appercep- tion according to him is "clear" if it is so precisely distinguished from all others that it assures the recognition of its object, i.e., if it is properly described in its concrete appearance; it is "distinct," if its "clearness" extends to the analytic discernment and compre- hension of its component parts, i.e., if it is logically classified with reference to its constituent elements. Any conception, which is both "clear" and "distinct," is named by Leibniz an "apperception," every conception falling short of clear- ness and distinctness, any notion, perception, obscure intimation, bare sensation, and thence down to the infinitesimal limit of exist- ence, comes under the head of "petty perception." Each integral unit of "Kraft" must be "substance," i.e., pri- mary, indivisible, absolutely distinct from every other unit. Each must be a primary unit of some degree of individual spontaneity. Each one of these units Leibniz named a "monad." These monads he arranged in accordance with their greater or less degree of "clearness" and "distinctness" in a series of infinitesimal calcu- lus, one end of which extended upward through all the possible gradations of active human intelligence to God as the supreme limit, the divine. "monad" or universal power; and the other downward through all the possible gradations of infinitesimal diminution of energy toward the infinite lower limit of absolute nought of "Kraft." Leibniz expressed his conception of the absolute individuality of the monad by the metaphor: "Monads have no windows." By virtue of its absolutely integral character, no monad can communicate with any other. A monad cannot give to another nor receive from it. It cannot even be aware of any reality outside of itself. The life and development of each monad must proceed therefore absolutely as an unfoldment of its inner nature. No monad can be influenced, favorably or unfavorably, by any external condition or circumstance. A genetic environment and organic relationship with Nature or the world, is non-existent for the monad. The inevitable result of this absolute isolation of each individual unit of spontaneous "Kraft" would be cosmic anarchy, a chaos of ceaseless collisions between these infinite numbers of self-sufficient</page><page sequence="20">48 MARTIN SCHtUTZE integral forces. Leibniz found no way out of the dilemma except by the device of a re-creation of the rationalistic "deus ex machina,"or personification of an absolute "first cause." This device was the "Pre-established Harmony," by virtue of which each individual con- tained within itself the sum of the universe and therefore acted spon- taneously in harmony with the divine order established in the best of possible worlds. The fiction of the Pre-established Harmony was the price exacted by the rationalistic absolutism in which Leibniz clothed his idea of the monad. Stripped of the rationalistic formalism, the theory of the monad means the substitution of the principle of specific individu- ality for that of formal abstraction as the primary factor of reality. Leibniz overcame the rationalistic dualism of living mind and dead matter by identifying the latter with the lower and the former with the upper orders of the continuous hierarchy of monads. The "res extensa" of Descartes' and Spinoza's dualism ceases to exist. A universal vitalism of infinite gradations of individual "powers" embraces all reality. Each definable integral principle of reality is a living entity, which cannot be duplicated or replaced in all space and time. This primacy of individuality, conceived as absolute, dynamic, specific spontaneity, with all its faults of rationalistic absolutism and intellectualism, was the first attempt to give comprehensive and origi- nal expression in German philosophy to the principle which was to dominate modern humanistic thought. However, the traditional scholasticism of Leibniz' methods and conceptions, of the "substances," "essences," "absolutes," the logis- tic formalism of his analysis, soon lost their hold upon an age char- acterized by a self-confident, passionate, energetic sense of concrete individuality--the same sense which must have been the creative motive, working obscurely beneath the rationalistic forms, of Leibniz' thought. His followers, and particularly Baumgarten, the inventor of the term "aesthetics," Bodmer and Breitinger, and above all, Herder, were to develop the idea of dynamic individuality to its full significance.
